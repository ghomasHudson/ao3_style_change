“Let it go, Cas” Dean says, spitting out another mouthful of blood. He’s flexing his hands against his sides and breathing heavy, puffs of breath dissipating into the night. He stands facing the street, squinting into the headlights, not moving, just breathing. Cas can’t even get a word in before he’s halfway across yellow lines, flipping off a honking driver.
“I think I’ve waited longer,” Dean says, pulling Cas back up to lock lips again, deepening it now. Cas slides his fingers in between Dean’s and pins Dean’s hands above his head, pushing further into his hips. Dean groans and bucks forward. Dean nearly bites off Cas’ tongue when Sam raps sharply on the greenhouse window. The two of them turn in shock and with the biggest shit-eating grin, Sam gestures dinner’s ready and then immediately flees.
“I’m really sorry Dean I don’t get what it is.” Cas says, turning over the Polaroid in his hands again and again, looking at the buttons and flash and trying to figure out its purpose.  Dean’s heart collapses only for a second, before he realizes he’s being stupid, and that will love his gift once he understands how it works.
“Yea well, that too,” Dean says, stammering. “Shut up,” he adds, just for good measure, but it’s an empty jibe. Cas just shakes his head.
“Dean what if I crash it?” Cas asks, already feeling sick at the thought of ruining something Dean holds so close to his heart.
Cas swallowed. “Do you think he—” but Dean was already getting up, moving away from the couch towards his room.
“Well, I’m glad you like it Cas,” Dean said, sitting up a little. “It’s a...it’s a fun holiday time.” A fun holiday time? Pull it together, Dean he thinks. Somewhere between Dean’s brain and his mouth his words were corrupted by Cas’ gaze, garbled, ruffled through and spit out. And that was Dean sober.
“It’s okay, I didn’t mind. The radio was nice. Let me think for a while” Cas says. Dean’s legs intertwine with Cas; Dean hisses when he meets Cas’ freezing feet. The abominable Cas-man, as Dean calls him. Cas is still trying to figure that one out.
“Wait-what the fuckno thatss so stupid Cas don’t t-think your not awesome because you did-dnt get invited to prom,” Dean said, taking off his shoes. “You’re like the coolest person I know.”
“In fact, name one person who you think would want to go to Prom with me. One” Cas said, arms crossed.
What he found was a group of kids smoking who knows what, so he left. He was running out of places to hide. Plus, Dean was probably wondering where he was.
That night they kiss and talk for hours, Cas taking multiple photos of Dean. All of which Dean is happy to smile for because for once in a long time he is finally happy and he’s glad Cas can say the same. They sleep in the same bed that night, Dean falling asleep on Cas chest, finding comfort in Cas’ even breaths. He falls asleep planning on Cas’ gift for his next birthday, because he was to be damned if it isn’t as good as this years.
“Well, Cas, nobody asked you to. I don’t know if you noticed, but you’re not my fucking babysitter.” Dean spits. Dean turns on the music. blaring it. Cas turns it off.
They spend the rest of the day lounging around. Dean throws on Die Hard—”Die Hard is a Christmas movie, Sam”—but they’re only half watching. Dean sneaks a kiss with Cas in the kitchen while Sam’s passed out in the living room later in the evening and Dean rides that high until the sun comes down. He finds Cas later in the greenhouse, trying to nurse the crushed orchid back to the land of the living.
shoulders and using a finger to tilt Cas’ chin up before he places his lips on Cas’.  At first, Cas leans back from the kiss, staring Dean in the eyes, utterly
“Shhhh,” Cas said, lifting Dean’s chin to kiss him again. They went slow, Cas’ tongue running along Dean’s bottom lip and yes, please, now, Dean opened deeper for Cas. Cas’ hips slowly pushed down into Dean, and Dean bucked into the pressure. Now was not the time to be coy, Dean thought, and grabbed a handful of Cas’ ass. Cas’ was trailing down Dean’s neck now and Dean slowly started lifting Cas’ shift off his back, Cas’ shuddering against the cold air—
“Fine.” Dean said, reaching into his pocket to pull out his phone.  Cas eyed him with a look of confusion and apathy, unable to fathom how his phone would ever make Cas go to Prom. He turned back to the TV.
“Oh okay, yeah sure. I figured you’d have to learn sometime, so I guess now is as good a time as ever.” Dean says, getting up and throwing the blanket on him aside.
“Dean, I don’t want to play, please,” Cas says, a huff of annoyance. Dean swipes his hand at the air, rejecting Cas’ rejection. Dean wasn’t aversed to forcing Cas to play pool with him, much to Cas’ complaints. Sometimes as bait when hustling, to lure in some sucker from the bar to bet against Dean. But other times, Dean just wanted to play. Like tonight.
Dean came back from the bathroom and poured them all shots. Lisa politely declined, but Cas accepted. Dean took Lisa’s shot for her, tossing it back without even a wince.
“Dean this is incredible. I don’t know what to say,” Cas says, dropping the blade to wrap his arms around Dean. Dean oofs, but then wraps his arms around Cas for the hug. Dean can smell Cas from the crown of his head, patchouli and dirt. Cas pulls back.
Dean’s lips are soft, but they go still under Cas’. Cas pulls back. Fear flashes across his face, his toying grin having fallen flat. He goes to blurt out an apology but Dean silences him, slamming his lips back into Cas’—greedy and needy and wet. The tube drops out of Cas’ hand and ricochets off of Dean’s shoulder but neither of them notice. Dean’s arm has already wrapped around Cas’ waist, pulling him completely flush against his own body. Cas feels himself go completely lax, feels himself fall into Dean, let’s Dean completely surround him with his arms. His hand comes to wrap around the back of Dean’s neck and grip there and Dean moans into Cas, breathless and wanting. It sets something off in Cas immediately and he pushes into Dean. They slam back against the bathroom wall. The sink is digging into his lower back but it’s a far off echo against the feel of Dean’s body. Dean’s tongue flicks across Cas’ lower lip and Cas opens instantly, letting Dean in.
“Hey there you go,” Dean says, still holding onto the car door incase Cas suddenly slams on the brake.
Soon they arrived back at the bunker, and Dean got out of the car, but Cas was having a tougher time. The seat belt wouldn’t unclick and a growingly frustrated Cas met Dean when he popped his head back inside.
“Dean,” Cas says, standing. His tone stops Dean, pausing him with his hand on the door handle, having turned it just slightly. Dean braced for impact, braced for the yelling, braced for the storm of Cas’ anger, for the telling off, for the guilt to bear down on him, to crush him into darkness.
“Dean, I’m so confused, is it a printer?” Cas says, truly puzzled. “And I don’t understand why someone would want such a small piece of paper-“
“No time,” Dean says but of course there was time. There was time for coffee because Dean had cooked a huge breakfast. Eggs, sausage, pancakes, hell, he even made biscuits.
Cas follows through and sinks the seven, sending the cue to tap lightly on the eighth. Dean lets out the breath he didn’t realize he was pulling and pulls himself off Cas. Cas is smiling, clearly happy with himself, maybe a little embarrassed to be proud.
“Just shut up and watch what happens you doofus.” Dean says, handing Cas the Polaroid. Soon enough the image of Cas with a very confused and slightly scared expression forms alongside Sam’s smile. Cas eyes widen at his realization of the capabilities of Dean’s gift. He watches the image fully form in complete silence, Sam giving Dean a look like he’s insane because he’s smiling so wide and Dean only smiles wider at that, even if he didn’t think being happier than he already was could be possible.
Dean slams down his gun onto the table. “Exactly! You shouldn’t have to! Damnit Cas. Everybody—every. single. person—I have ever loved I have gotten killed or watched die. I am not going to let that be you. ” Their voices echo off the bunker’s tall walls, parroting them back in distortion. “You deserve better, you deserve a real life, not this. Not hunting, not dying, not this."
“No, not like that.” Cas said, pulling Dean’s arms around him tighter. “Just thinking about us. About you. How much I love you” he says, burning his nose in Dean’s chest. The words don't sting like they used to. Dean does not recoil, does not wince, does not fight Cas and himself. Instead he pulls Cas closer, hand nudging Cas’ jaw upwards and now they’re kissing. It’s short and soft, Dean’s thumb rubbing along Cas’ jaw. His other hand sweeps up Cas' back, palm splayed. Cas leans harder into Dean, pushing himself flush against all that he is, all that is holding the edges of Cas’ existence into place, shielding him from everything beyond the space between them now. Dean pythons his arms around Cas, pulls him on top of him, runs a hand down to the small of his back. Dean’s tongue skims Cas’ bottom lip, Cas teases back, Dean opens the kiss. It’s slow and lazy, sleep winking in at the corners. Dean breaks off to run kisses down Cas’ neck, circling back to press one to his forehead. Cas collapses back onto Dean, runs his arms up around his neck, one slipping under a pillow.
Cas speaks between panting breaths, “I, I thought you regretted it, uhh, you didn’t speak to me, uhh, for three days” and Dean’s heart collapses in on itself. He pulls back, gazing deep into Cas’ eyes.
Wait, fuck. Dean thinks. Cas kissed him. Cas kissed him. First. Dean’s realization brought him to the fact that maybe Cas liked him back and before Dean knew what he was doing he pulled him back and crashed his lips on Cas’. They’re lips began sliding in rhythm easily, their breaths becoming short and shallow. It was hot and heady, and Dean felt like he was drowning. And in the best way possible. Cas’ tongue began to find it’s way into Dean’s mouth, and vice versa. They were kissing hard and Cas was pushing back into Dean, and Dean met his movements, becoming flush onto the driver door while Cas crawled onto his lap. Unknowingly, Cas elbow came to rest on the horn and-
“They’re lucky it was you,” Cas says. “I probably would’ve just smited them.” Dean chokes on nothing, then bursts out laughing. He’s doubling over again, nearly driving them into oncoming traffic. He straightens the car, laughing still, running his hand down his face. He glances over at Cas again. Cas is trying to hide a grin by looking out the window.
confused beyond belief. But then he surges forward, crashing his lips on Dean’s. Dean’s heart begins to race at a thousand miles a minute because he’s kissing
Finally Sam finished eating, (“You can’t eat to fast, Dean. You won’t properly digest”- Ya ya ya)(a bunch of bullshit if you ask Dean) and they got to presents.
“Yea, I’m good,” Dean says, the tension falling out of his shoulders. Cas smiles himself now. Leans back a little. It’s dark but Cas can see a soft smile flash quick across Dean’s face.
“They were too pricey and they were ugly too, come on, we’ve still got to grocery shop so stop dilly-dallying,” Dean said, pushing open the door. Sam just rolled his eyes; he didn’t have the energy left to fight.
“Absolutely not. No fun today. We’re going to put up the tree and I’m going to hate it and you’re going to hate it and we will never celebrate Christmas again,” Dean said, pushing the eggs around in the pan.
“You said you were cold last week in town, I thought it would help,” Cas says and Sam smiles. “Thank you! It’s a great color, Cas, I love it,” and Sam throws it on for good measure.
It’s not the first time Dean’s done this. Got wasted at some bar, riled up some biker or some townie, hit on their girlfriend, nagged them into a fight. At first Cas thought it was an accident, a drunken night gone south.
Cas is driving down a desert road, squinting into headlights as they pass. It’s midnight, or at least a little past. The stars are shimmering like rippling heat, but it must be freezing right now (Cas can’t feel it) because Dean is shivering. He’s sitting shotgun, asleep, his head propped against a flannel bundled loose. His hands are twitching in his lap, he’s curled in on himself. Cas passes a hand over his shoulder, letting a little grace slip out from his fingers as they graze Dean’s shirt. His shivering stalls and he shifts in his seat, murmuring a hum of nothing. He breathes a little deeper. The hunt had gone well enough, simple Salt n Burn of some ghost upset over a mine shaft out in the middle of—as Dean calls it— “butt-fuck nowhere”. Sammy was back at home, arm still in a cast from the last hunt gone south. Just Cas and Dean this time. Cas has been driving for an hour but the hotel’s at least another 30 minutes out, if he even finds it. It’s cacti and desert road and the occasional snore from Dean. He hits the stereo’s nob, keeping the volume low so it doesn’t wake Dean. Dean never plays the radio, only his tapes. They are great, Dean’s tapes, but they never change. The radio is nice. A commercial fades and a piano starts flickering in. The radio’s cutting in and out but a girl’s singing now, lilting above the piano’s falling notes.
“Okay, well, come get me when you’re ready,” Cas said, drifting out of the room. “I’ll be in the greenhouse.”
“I know, it’s just I feel bad taking gifts from you guys, you already do enough and you’ve helped so much and I just don’t feel righ-“
“Okay then,” Cas says, unwrapping the gift after taking it from Sam. He tore back the paper to reveal a leather journal, with an intricate design on the front. Swirls and lines stretched along the border, while a small latch that locked it closed sat in the center.
The trunk clips close as Dean grabs their bags, barely shaking off the sleep lingering around his eyes. If Cas doesn't hurry with the keys he’s going to fall asleep standing up like a horse.
Cas turns and leaves, heading back to his room. He tried to make burgers for Dean; a stupid apology that’s so little compared to how fucked up his fuck-up was that it was borderline insulting. He can’t stand the silence, Dean’s silence. It was like a bore drilling him between his eyes, a pain he was forcing himself to bear because of course, Dean had every right to be upset. He spends the rest of the night in his room sitting on his bed in the dark, hand over his mouth so he doesn’t scream, rocking back and forth. He's punching his thigh with a balled fist, though he doesn't notice. A bruise will form, dark and blotchy. It blooms against the pallor of his skin, rising to the surface, as if the blood was leaking out from the inside, from internal wounds. It hurts but not enough, never lessening the nerve-decay settled deep between his ribs.
. Then there was a second. A third. By the fourth, it was clear. They were a punishment. A punishment Dean incited on himself when he couldn’t find the words to say sorry. An equalizer for all the fuck ups, all the people he’d let die, a punch for for every one he couldn’t save. Sometimes he punched back, murmured lost names between swings. Others were spoken out in the crack of a jaw, the slap of skin on skin. The snap of a rib, when Dean had gone too far.
. Suddenly, just being here with Cas, who’s wearing one of Dean’s shirts because his own was torn by the cabra, feels like a dagger piercing through his sternum.
“Hey, quit it, you sound like Sam,” Dean said, plating the eggs and bacon. He handed Cas a plate. Cas thanked him and they got to eating, silently digging in.
“I’m good,” Cas says. “Are you good?” He looks over, eyebrow cocking slightly. Dean quickly turns his head, staring to the road. His hands’ grip on the wheel just slightly relaxes.
“Oh shut up and just open the damn thing,” Dean says, “before I take it back.” Cas pulls the gift away from Dean, fake-shielding it. He slowly unpeels the wrapping paper—just to tease Dean, he knows—and flicks open the cardboard box.
He steps forward, swallowing Cas in his arms, pulling him tight. “Hey, hey, Cas, come on Cas,” but Cas was pushing his arms into Dean, fighting against him. Dean only held on stronger and now Cas was punching his chest in little fists, tears pulsing down his cheek. He eventually caved, folding into Dean, full sobs raking up and down his spine. They slide to the floor, Dean cradling Cas now, tears welling up in his own eyes.
“The Christmas Tree lot, duh,” Dean said, fake pulling Cas up by his shoulders. “We have to go now and get a good one before it’s only Charlie Browns left.”
Cas makes a show of flopping over his book. “Well, we gathered and read scripture, yes. I always enjoyed our tradition.” The book flip backs up.
Cas shrugs. “If I understand this correctly, resolutions begin on New Year’s Day. Which is tomorrow. I’ve still got”—he checks the car radio—”two hours.”
“Right,” Sam said, backing out. Abort, abort abort currently blasted through his head. He held up his hands. “Sorry, I’ll ugh, let you too get back to it then,” he said. He fled the room but the awkwardness remained, hanging in the air, thick.
So that’s how it was settled. Cas would be going to prom.  He hated even the idea of it, but Dean had seem so hellbent on it that maybe he’d go for an hour or so then leave. Dean would understand.
Sam’s present was delicately wrapped, much to Dean’s resentment, as Dean couldn’t wrap for shit, and Cas accepted the gift with a little hesitancy.
“I thought there'd be more,” Cas said, lifting his hands towards the fire. He settled deeper into the couch. His knee brushed against Dean’s more fully, settled against his. Dean wrapped his arms around a pillow to still them. His hands were begging to reach forward, run themselves under and up Cas’ shirt, dig through his hair. The fire popped, snapping him back.
“Yea, it was” Cas said, smiling to himself. He didn’t lie this time. Being along with Dean actually made Cas estatic. Being with Dean always did.
“Dean slow down” Cas said, putting his hand over the shot Dean was about to down. Dean simply smiled and took it regardless.
“I don’t know. Just thinking. About us,” Cas says, planting a kiss against the Dean’s throat, nosing right under his ear.
. Dean slots his hands under Cas’ knees, hoisting Cas higher up on the bed. Cas scrambles back towards the headboard and Dean climbs over him, slotting himself between Cas’ legs. Cas pushes up, just slightly, but it’s all the invitation Dean needs to grind down into him. Cas moans and Dean takes his chin in his hand, tilting his head sideways to kiss hard down his neck. Cas squirms under Dean, bucks up against Dean’s hips, desperate for pressure. Dean just continues down his neck, breath hot and warm and kissing hard as he pulls Cas’ collar down lower, exposing his collarbone.
“Well then let’s fix that. Pick a date. Any one Cas. Doesn’t matter.” Dean says, already plotting about gifts and coordinating with Sam about the cake and other celebratory customs.
“Hmmm? Oh” Dean says, rubbing his eyes and then his arms. Damn, it was cold. He gets out, stretches his limbs.
No, Dean was caught off guard by just how...easy it was. When they’d both gotten off their briefs and were finally naked, neither squirmed or turned away. They’d both just taken a moment, sat back, breathing each other in and just looking. It was the feeling of falling apart and together at the same time. Gravitating to one another in the soft light of the motel lamp, just an extension of the clothed dance they’d been playing for years.
Dean comes outside and finds Cas sitting shotgun in his car. The thing was a wreck, and Dean was not about to let Cas learn to drive with some shabby pimp ride. He pulled open the driver door and stuck his head in.
“What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” Sam said in defense. He knew Dean was just fronting, knew he was embarrassed to be taking so long for a sweater. Sam wasn’t stupid: when Cas said it was his first Christmas he knew Dean would take it and run. He didn’t think it would be this bad.
“I'm so sorry, Cas. I...I” Dean said, nudging the crown of Cas’ head with his cheek. “I just, I just, I just fuck everything up. I fuck it up. I won’t let myself hurt you again. But I will. I will. I'm not good for you, I'm not enough” Dean says.
“Fine, what are yours then?” Cas asks. He smirks when Dean is silent, when he blanks. Of course, Dean didn’t have any resolutions himself. He’d been busy! He hadn’t time to think. They’d been on a hunt, give a guy a break for once.
The game is going well. Cas has gotten somewhat better, even if he pretends he hasn’t. He can sink a given shot. But he isn’t thinking ahead, isn’t picturing the end-placement of the cue.
He’s cut off midthought as Cas’ lips meet his, and for a second Dean can’t even comprehend what’s going on. Soon enough his mind catches up to his lips and he backs up quickly, racking his mind for an excuse as to why he kissed Cas, even if he doesn’t remember doing it. Maybe he did it subconsciously or maybe his hand slipped on the seat and he fell forward.
Dean lifted his head from where it’d been resting on the couch. “I don’t know, uhh, we have to make a snowman, and uhhhh, go caroling and then...uhh” Dean rubbed his eyes. Those five—six?—old fashioneds had really snuck up on him.
“No it’s fine Dean,” Cas asked, trying to stop Dean from getting to heated. Dean was standing up again.
Cas kisses him again, slow and thoughtful. Dean cups his face and wraps his arm around Cas’ waist, pulling him in tighter. They kiss for a moment longer and Cas pulls back, leaning his forehead against Dean’s. Dean reaches up and kisses it and Cas sinks back down on Dean’s chest.
“What do you do with mistytoll?” Cas replied, his hand now rested on Dean’s thigh, inching across a line.
“Yeah. You’ll be ready to drive anywhere really soon. You can count on it.” Dean says, bringing his eyes back to the road. He doesn’t see the smile that grows on Cas’ face. Dean being proud of him gave him a sense that maybe he was overreacting earlier with the whole key thing. Or maybe he’s overreacting now, thinking a simple compliment meant that’s all those nights spent awake wondering whether or not Dean felt about him was the same way he felt about Dean meant something. Cas shut down those thoughts as quickly as they sprung up, not wanting to dive deeper into something he new wouldn’t go anywhere.
The punch bowl was full when Cas arrived, grabbing himself a plastic cup and pouring the dark red sugar water into it. He then scanned the crowd, looking for any familiar face that would provide an escape route of this hell via conversation. He saw no one but Dean and Lisa, who looked like they were having the time of their life. Hell, they probably were.
“Sorry I’m not swept up in the ceremonials patterns of the human race Dean, I’ve been a little busy.” Cas said, trying to pick up his book again.
“Uhh...sometimes you hang mistletoe,” Dean said, licking his lips. He watched Cas watch him, watched his eyes flicker down again. Dean, stop. But Dean was in the backseat now. Drunk Dean steering the boat, flying the plane. He hoped it wouldn’t crash land.
“Cas, I know that,” Dean says, coming around and opening Cas’ car door. He gestures for Cas to get out, and when he does, Dean points to the Impala.
“So we going out tonight or what?” Dean asks, running a hand through his damp hair. Now it’s his turn to feel exposed, the towel slung low across his hips. He tries to act casual, tries not to shy away when Cas turns to look at him, catalogs when Cas’ gaze lingers just a second longer, just a flash downwards.
“Fine,” Cas says, letting Dean drag him along. “But you’re buying,” he adds, grinning. Dean scoffs and holds open the door.
—but when it doesn’t shake the second week, it’s all very real to Dean, who brings Cas tea without being asked and secretly searches online for kittens to adopt.
playing with—” he ducks the swing he anticipated from the shorter one. Dean’s fist is already driving up and through before he’s stood back up. It connects with the guy’s jaw with an audible crack and the guy staggers back. His weight carries him back as tumbles over his stool. The taller one lunges but Dean sidesteps under and around him, hooking his foot under the guy’s boot and shoving him forward. He trips and goes down hard and fast, head slamming on a table’s rim. He’s knocked out before he hits the ground. The third guy freezes. Don’t be stupid, now, Dean thinks. He backs off, hands up, knocking into the table behind him. Dean stands for a moment, breathing. The bar’s gone dead quiet. He can feel 30 stares on him but he doesn’t care, just turns and walks off. He tips over someone’s old beer, letting it slowly pour off the table’s edge and onto the taller one’s face as he slowly comes to.
For kissing you, For not being who you need me to be. For not being strong, open, willing. Dean thinks. But that is now what he says.
Cas closed his eyes when Dean stirred in waking, pretended he was asleep even though Dean caught him. He caught him every time.
They talk about a possible hunt in Cheyenne. They talk about Sam, about new parts Dean needs for Baby, about plans for winter in the bunker. About Cas’ garden and the greenhouse they were building. Cas had protested to Dean’s help at first since he didn’t want to bother Dean but Dean had insisted. He wouldn’t let Cas
“Nothing, Sammy,” Dean said, pulling out another sweater. He set it down, looking around the store. “Let’s just go,” Dean said, pushing past him.
Dean asks before he can stop himself. He knew it was a risk—this was so new—but so far, the world was still standing. Nothing had fallen apart. Cas was still right there, still scratching his chest, still faintly smiling.
Then only half the lights would turn on, because, of course. Dean ended up breaking four ornaments himself, which meant they were then only left with six. The garland only made it a foot up the bottom too because Dean had only bought one pack. In the end, it looked….kinda fucked.
“Dean you’re drunk,” was all Cas said, knowing fully that tomorrow Dean would be sober and in love with Lisa and Cas would be nursing a hangover. And that’s it.
Cas catalogues Dean’s tenderness. “Coffee for Cas. One ice cube. Three sugars.” A rub on the shoulder. The better side of the motel bed. The better side of his anger, when he should be mad, but he isn’t. A missed call. A voicemail. “Come back from your cloud in the sky Dumbo.” What’s not said, if only because it’s shown. Things Dean takes: punches from a vamp, Cas’ sour moods, the tomatoes out of a burger. And what he doesn’t: Promises for granted. The kitten Cas finds outside the bunker that he nurses back to health. The kitten Dean is actually allergic to, the one Cas is sure Dean will send out for adoption but
“I’m sorry, Cas,” Dean said, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, “what’d you say?” Cas sets his shoulders and stands tall before reciting his demand again, firmer this time.
He must have. An alarm sounded somewhere in the back of Dean’s mind but he tried to ignore it. Tried to relax.
Cas slowly tilted the glass back, letting the bourbon flow down his throat as he swallowed the drink whole. A little caught on the corner of his lip. He wiped it with the back of his arm, reaching forward again to set down the glass on the table. Dean’s eyes were open as wide as his mouth, which he quickly tried to close. Everything was happening too quickly and yet he swore time froze as Cas’ head tipped back, his neck arching, his adam’s apple bobbing up and down.
sticks all by ourselves.” One of them glances at the other. The shortest turns red, crossing his arms. Dean just goes on. “No one to sink any balls with, fill all those holes” he says, dragging it out, laying it on thick.
, that nobody forced to give up everything but that I did because I wanted to? Why can't you just accept that? Why do you think you don’t deserve to be loved? Every time, you think that the rest of us would all be better if you were dead. I would die tomorrow. I would fucking die tomorrow if you ever pulled something like that. Don’t you ever fucking tell me that I deserve better than what I
They turn to Dean, who has fallen silent, the gift laying partially unwrapped in his lap. He finally speaks but all he says is “Cas”, very softly. He holds up the original signed copy of Slaughterhouse Five, delicate in opening the cover. Cas doesn’t even try to hide his smile.
The drive into town is only 15 minutes long but the minutes are crawling on. Cas isn’t saying much. Dean knows he’s giving him space and he silently takes it, thanking Cas in everything but words. They hadn’t talked about it yet; he doesn’t know if they will. It’s not that Dean is
see this though,  and only says a quiet “never mind forget the picture” and starts in the direction of the car. Dean quickly catches up to Cas, grabbing his
Their steps were heavy to the door, sand scattering out of laces across the pavement. Dean could feel a sunburn creeping across his neck from their afternoon spent out in the desert boonies. Normally they didn’t take chupacabra cases; they were light work for local hunters. But this one was particularly nasty. It’d caught a drunk girl wandering off from a campfire. Her friends found her before she bled out, luckily, but they rarely attack humans. Alas, enter Dean and Cas. They’d found its den, shanked the damn thing, and still had time for dinner.
“Oh, shit. Sorry,” Dean says, slipping himself under the covers. He pulls them up and over them. “Should’ve stayed awake. Kept you company.”
“Tell me you would have said ‘Yes’” Dean said incredibly close to Cas.  “Tell me if I asked you to Prom you would have said Yes,” Dean repeated, a pleading look in his eyes.
Dean orders them beers. Before Cas could sit down Dean grabs him again, directing him over to the back. He sighs. He knows where this was going.
“Really?” Cas asked. Dean thought he was going to smell the liquor on his lips, he was that close. His face was red from the alcohol flush, but he definitely was not blushing. No, not blushing. But just as quickly as Cas was there he was leaning back, pulling out the glass Dean had been trying to hide out from behind him back.
“I…” Dean says, feeling awkward now that he’s standing above Cas. He sits down beside him, close but not close enough for Cas to reach. Cas wants to but Dean is so cagey, so flighty that he thinks if he even breathes the wrong way Dean will bolt. So he doesn’t say anything.
“I don’t know, maybe an hour?” Cas says, nuzzling his nose into Dean’s chest. Dean starts peeling Cas’ big jacket off, big hands making quick work. Cas settles back in, feels Dean’s heartbeat against his cheek.
Okay, so Cas just had to tell Dean he wasn’t feeling well, and that he was going home. Problem solved.
“We decided to watch a movie instead,” Dean snapped out, way too quickly. Sam glanced at the TV. It was off.
“Have I celebrated Jesus’ birthday before? Yes, we had a yearly gathering in heaven.” Cas says, his eyes staying nestled in his book.
“Huh...” Dean says. “So, two hours to be bad, huh?” he adds, grinning. Cas head turns so he can shoot Dean a
“Yes Dean?” Cas replies, his eyes still entranced on Slaughterhouse Five. Dean had recommended it too Cas one day about a week ago, and Cas hadn’t liked the book at first, but with a little persistence Dean managed to make him recognize it’s genius.
“Come here,” Dean says, pulling Cas down onto the bed. He wraps his arms around him, pulling him flush against his chest. He nuzzles the crown of Cas’ head. Motel heater be damned, Cas thinks. Dean is warm enough. “Thank you for driving,” he says, yawning.
“I don’t know how.” he finally admits, quietly, almost to himself. Cas’ tears have run dry but he’s silent, gone still now in Dean’s arm. “I love you, Cas. Of course, of course I love you. I love you. I need you. I need you every day. I need you so much it terrifies me. It terrifies me.”
“Umm, yea, they were out of Sam’s hair gel,” Dean quipped and Sam just furrowed his brow. He didn’t even bother remarking how little that made sense.
“You ready Cas?” Dean asked, from the other room, trying to get dressed in a rush. He was gonna be late to picking Lisa up. Cas wasn’t surprised.
Dean soon returned to Cas’ lips, and smiled into the kiss. Cas broke it off to look at Dean, a pair of green eyes meeting his in the darkness. Cas decided that if Dean was being serious, then they could wait till morning. He didn’t want to rush this. Plus, if Dean wasn’t being serious, then taking it too far could mean their friendship was at stake, and that was too important to Cas to lose over making out drunk.
Now Cas rolls his eyes, steels himself against a grin. Something had really gotten into Dean tonight. He was clearly feeling bold. Sometimes when Dean got drunk he let things slip, or teased a little harder, or let innuendos hang in the air. But tonight he was sober. He wonders if it would last.
“Okay then, November 23rd it is.” Dean says, happy with Cas’ answer simply because Cas was happy with it. Whatever made Cas happy made Dean happy. Simple as that.
when he hears the snicker. It’s followed by a jibe Dean doesn’t fully hear but instinctively recognizes. It slices a knife through his stomach, His shoulders tense but he doesn’t turn around. He doesn’t want to give them the satisfaction of rousing a reaction. He just slowly scans the bar, ignoring Cas’ question until he spots them, standing a couple tables over. There’s three of them, maybe mid 30’s, already worse for wear, each more drunk than the last. Cas looks over Dean’s shoulder until he spots them. The bikers from before. The way Dean had stilled, eyes glazing dark; Cas immediately knew something was off.
He’s laughing so hard he has to lean over, his hand against the Impala’s roof to get air into his lungs. Cas starts laughing too, shaking his head.
“Try me, and if I smile, then you can get your damn picture and we can leave,” Dean says, leaning back against the car.
“Dean,” Cas says. Dean doesn’t respond. He knows he overreacted; he knows he should’ve just let it go. He didn’t have to edge them on, get them to swing so that he ‘d have an excuse to swing back. On the surface, he doesn’t have a real excuse for why he did it. He hadn’t thought, just acted. Just acted on the anger, that red-hot rage they’d lit so easily into a burning flame. With just a single word. He’d always hated that fucking word, hated it when Dad used to say it, hated hearing it in the hallways of whatever high school, hated, hated, hated it. He could bulllshit something to Cas that they were looking for trouble anyways, but Cas would see right through it. He probably already could. He knows Cas knows he edged them on. He rolls down the window.
“This must have cost a fortune,” Dean says, closing the book to run his fingers over the cover. “Cas you shouldn’t have, I….Thank you, Cas, really, thank you.”
“Make me, Winchester” Cas said, crossing his arms. Cas knew he was being a little bit bitchy but Dean should have seen this coming or at least have been respectful of his decision.
Dean stops talking, stares down at his hands. Cas stares forward in the road, unflinching when the headlights blind him.
“Hi,” Cas says, placing down the pot. Cas is seated on the floor, surrounded by scattered dirt and bits of leaves. He takes off his gloves. He has a smear of dirt across his cheek. Dean resists the urge to wipe it away.
“You are not leaving Cas. I know you lying. Now stop being such a pity party and dance.” Dean said, pulling Cas onto the dance floor.
“I need you.” Cas snaps back. Dean is kneeling, bloodied eyes pleading to Cas. Pleading for him. Cas hears the drop of the blade before he’s realized he has let it go. He flees.
“Oh shit, haha sorry” Dean said putting his hands on Cas chest to help push himself up. He lingered for a second, but then made his way back over to the other side of the couch. Cas noticed but blamed it on the alcohol pulsing through Dean’s veins.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Cas, you’re supposed to say work out or eat healthy or something stupid.” Cas eyebrows knit together. “Besides, you’re already those things anyways and therefore, you’re cheating.”
He ate dinner alone. Cas joined him, briefly, pushing his food around his plate but Sam didn’t think he ever actually took a bite. Sam didn’t want to press him about it, but if he was suspicious before, he knew something had happened now.
Cas is looking over too now, faintly smiling. He knows Dean expected a telling-off—he probably deserves it anyways—but Cas can’t summon the energy. Or the will to care. In fact, he doesn’t tell Dean off because he doesn’t really want to.
sat right next to him; he remembers the brush of Cas’ thigh against his own. Remembers when Cas hadn’t retreated from the touch, just let the electricity dance between their skin. That is,
“You’re an idiot,” he mumbles, trailing kisses down Dean’s neck. Dean roots his hands through Cas’ hair.
“Dean,” Cas called out but he kept his head down, didn’t look back as he rounded the corner. “uh...goodnight Cas,” Dean choked out.
Prom was just liked Cas had imagined. A bunch of awkward high schoolers dancing to songs Cas hated. Yea, an hour was gonna be a long time. Dean seemed excited though, pulling Lisa into the crowd to dance. Dean beckoned for Cas, but Cas simply replied he was gonna grab a drink and then meet them in a few.
“Dean, it’s okay.” Cas said, placing a hand on Dean’s knee. “You don’t have to be sorry. Besides, Christmas on Earth is...good. It’s great actually. I like it. Thank you for introducing me,” Cas said, wrapping the blanket closer around him. Warmth spread through Dean. The fireplace and the bourbon were no match to the sheer heat radiating of Cas’ body. Here on the couch, orange flickers of soft light caressed Cas’ face, illuminating his eyes as they held Dean’s gaze. God, in the light Cas was so beautiful. He always stunned Dean. No matter what time of day. Even in the mornings, with his bed head and baggy pajama bottoms. It wasn’t even the skin peeking under his sleeping shirt that always stirred Dean. Just the sight of Cas comfortable, sleepy, home, threw Dean everytime. Of course Cas was beautiful during the day, working in the greenhouse, reading his books, his hands attentive to book and flower with the same gentle caress. Right now, with the sparks of a fire dancing in his eyes— those eyes that were holding Dean’s, holding true, not breaking— Dean’s breath was catching in his throat.
the eight, and trap Dean. Cas comes around to where Dean’s standing and Dean can see the moment it clicks. But when Cas leans over the table to take the shot, his shirt—
“Sorry about the third wheeling” Dean said, standing up but swaying way too much to be safe. Cas grabbed him to ground him but Dean fell, landing in a heap on Cas.
“Actually yea,” Cas said, loosening up a bit. The worst part was over. Now he could just relax, hang out with his friends, and get wasted.
“And where did you even get the money?” Dean says, remembering that Cas, you know, doesn’t have a job.
Now that Cas was human (for now, Dean told himself. He was working on it.) Dean finally had an excuse to go all out. On one hand he felt childish at the idea of decorating the bunker in kitschy Christmas bows and ribbons, stringing up lights, posting a tree up in the corner. On the other hand, seeing Cas among the Christmas trees, fingers stretching out to graze their pines, stopping to smell each one, made a warmth was spread through his chest. They’d been through so much this year; together and separately. Dean had to make it up to Cas. He had to give him a proper holiday.
“Uh, we could make snow-angels or uh...” Dean said, immediately regretting it. The Cas-being-human thing was still a fresh wound and Dean hated prodding it. But Cas didn’t even wince, like he might have in the beginning.
It was quick. Tentative. Cas was struck, he couldn’t even begin to think that after all these years Dean could somehow have felt the same.
They’re both exhausted and they know it, shuffling quietly through the room with heavy feet. Dean is taking off his boots on the edge of the bed, rubbing the bottom of his feet.
“Stop, I know you don’t believe me Cas” Dean said, sitting up to look Cas in the eyes. “It’s bullshit no one asked you”
“A very long time,” Cas says, a smile creeping back over his lips. “...you?” He knew the answer but he wanted Dean to say it, to vocalize it.
“Oh yea,” Cas said, standing up a little too quickly to meet Dean. He swayed as Dean tried to steady him but Cas brushed him off. “If people ‘like me so much’ then why did I not have a date Dean? Huh? You keep saying
“Alright Cas, time to pop your Christmas cherry, then,” Dean said, rebuking a look from Sam. “We’re going to do it right this year, you’ll see,” Dean said, hand lingering down Cas’ shoulder blade to the back of his chair.
Dean had been tasting the bourbon before Cas wandered into the kitchen. Well, tasting in a glass. Drinking it. It being 3 Old Fashioneds.
“....Personal space,” Cas had said, his mouth teasing up into a grin. Dean blurted out a laugh, his head falling forward to rest on Cas’ shoulder.
“This is the wheel, the gas, brake, and gear” Dean says while pointing out all the corresponding parts. Cas just nods in agreement and tries to absorb everything Dean says.
When it’s all said and done, when the haze of greed and lust and need clears, when the room falls silent except for their even breaths, Dean closes his eyes. He waited for the shoe to drop, for the air to be sucked out of the room, for Cas to pull off and turn in shame or regret or embarrassment or whatever. But Cas doesn’t move. Neither does Dean. They only lie there, Cas’ fingers trailing slow circles over Dean’s chest. Dean brings his hand to scratch through Cas’ hair and Cas sighs so slightly. The fear Dean expected, the nuclear fall-out, the fighting, the
And Cas was right. Cas takes the picture out of his pocket, and clear as day, Dean is smiling while kissing Cas, caught in a moment of pure joy, unfiltered bliss, and Dean can say now he isn’t afraid to hide it.
“Oh c’mon Cas if you’re going to learn to drive properly, you’re going to learn in a real car, not this thing,” Dean says, taking a look at the rugged interior.
—but Cas was right. Cas did know him. He could recognize what Dean said when he couldn’t speak. He knew his every tell—for better or worse. When he was lying. When he was asking for something but too scared to vocalize it. When he was telling the truth but pretending to be lying, to save face. From what, Cas couldn’t always understand. But right now, he understood that Dean would say something, joke about the moment, deflect when he was ready. And Cas would laugh, because the joke would probably be funny anyways. Cas knew when to push and when to wait, when to let Dean navigate to him, to reach out to him, to trust Dean to trust himself to do it. When they were together, there were many things unsaid, of course, but nothing gone unnoticed. Each lingering touch, each just-because coffee, each here, I’ll drive, you sleep—each one emboldening the next, cementing the last in a language they shared but did not speak aloud.
look and Dean’s cheeks go hot. Yea, what was that supposed to mean, Dean thinks. Tonight his mouth and hands have spoken before him, moved on their own, acted independently. He doesn’t know what’s happened, why his filter up and left, why he can’t keep his hands to himself. It’s almost terrifying him but he can’t stop. He felt it in the bar. It’s simply adrenaline, pure and raw and coursing. It’s fighting a werewolf with a broken stake in a dark den. It’s being a teenager all over again, riding his motorbike too fast, corn fields blurring into streaks of tan beside him. It’s a space where actions precede thought, where he cannot second guess but only react, move forward, keep pushing. He knows it’s about Cas—it’s always about Cas—but tonight it’s different. So often Dean has to hold himself back, has to think and think and overthink before he speaks. If he speaks at all. He has to restrain his hands from reaching out, has to keep a pained distance, has to think three steps ahead. Tonight, he isn’t. He isn’t thinking. He isn’t wondering what Cas is thinking. He’s only acting, reacting, leaning into the adrenaline of flirting with Cas, teasing the line, shifting into third gear.
Dean understood that Cas had had enough and simply nestled himself between Cas’ arms, letting the vodka pull him into sleep. Cas wrapped his arms around Dean and leaned back, resting his head against the couch. Soon enough he was drifting, the sound of Dean snoring lulling him into dreams of prom dates with green eyes and more freckles than he could count.
“These are—” Cas holds up a pair of red long socks, with a blue stripe that cuts across the top. “....These are great Dean, thank you.” Dean just kinda stammers, sputtering like a stalled engine. “Yea, I—uh yea, I, I just saw them and I..I thought you would like them.” Sam’s eyebrows cock to the sky and he shoots Dean a look of Really? Dean ignores him.
“Hmmm, think again,” Dean says, right as Cas is about to shoot. Cas looks up, catches Dean’s eyes, brows furrowed.
“Alright, let’s bounce,” Dean says, shuffling out of the seat. He pays at the counter and they head out. Cas starts towards the car but Dean grabs him, dragging him across the street. “Dean,” Cas moans, “what now?”
“Hmmm,” Cas says, eyes sweeping upwards. “Well, I’d think I’d like to be more compassionate. Be more open minded. Perhaps more patient.”
“There’s one more thing, but I was saving it for later,” Dean said. His words rang out before he thought them, the booze speaking for him. Dean, slow down.
Dean pressed his lips onto Cas’. They were rugged, just as Dean had imagined, but soft, slow, even sweet. Then Dean caught up with his drunk body in real time, realizing that fuck, these were Cas’ lips. But Cas’ arm only slowly wrapped around Dean’s neck, pulling him in further. Dean’s breath hitched in his throat as they deepened their kiss, hitching again when Cas rubbed a thumb down Dean’s jaw. Dean realized his hands were still planted by his side and when he wrapped them around Cas and Cas moaned so slightly into Dean’s mouth, Dean thought he’d nearly crush him pulling him closer. Cas crawled forward into Dean’s lap, straddling him now as he leaned Dean back into lying down. Dean bit a little on Cas’ bottom lip and Cas pushed down into him, running a hand down his chest. Dean pulled off to mouth kisses down Cas’ neck, starting at his ear and working down to the hollow of this throat.
Dinner is a little- no a lot awkward, but Sam says he’s okay with it, just as long as he doesn’t catch them doing anything that he would regret seeing for the rest of his life. Dean tells him to shut up and Cas laughs.
“It’s your first time, it’s not going to be perfect,” Dean says. “Hell even I sucked my first time,” Dean says. This earns him a small grin from Cas who is relieved by Dean’s attempt to calm him. Cas’ grin sends a fleeting sense of happiness though Dean, and Dean sets him up to try again.
“I need you.” Dean’s voice cracks. The blade falls, sinking into his chest. It hits bone and diverts, slicing through an artery, blood pooling down Dean’s chest. It runs across Cas’ hand, warm and slippery. He pulls the blade out and Dean slumps down, head falling forward before his whole form falls back. There’s a crack of his head on the concrete, but it doesn’t register on his face. His eyes are closed. They stay closed.
“I’m sorry about the orchid,” he says. He is sorry; it’s completely crushed. Well, not that sorry. Collateral damage. Friendly fire.
“I don’t know,” Dean nearly whispers. He pinches the bridge of his nose. He pauses, hand propped up in the air before letting it fall. “I don’t know, Cas, I just…” He turns to the window again.
That night they fall asleep together, curled up in a tangle of limbs. Cas’ head is resting on Dean’s chest and Dean falls asleep to the sound of Cas’ light snoring.For once it's perfect for Dean, and he falls asleep happy.
Now they’re sitting, waiting. Dean takes a swig of his beer. Cas eats a tortilla chip. He’s learning to eat, slowly, learning to recognize flavors. Salt is easier, since it’s basically a mineral. The fajitas he eats are supposed to taste like cumin, as Dean tells him, but he doesn’t expect he’ll get much out of it. He usually just eats to make Dean feel comfortable. Dean hates eating alone. After Cas has pushed his food around, Dean will probably just finish off whatever’s left anyways. And Cas will let him, feigning fullness.
“God those were supposed to be for Sam. I panicked, okay?” Dean says, shielding himself from Cas’ little punt to his shoulder.
“This looks great, thank you Dean,” Cas said, filling a cup of coffee. Someone’s in a nice mood, Dean thought. Cas was usually overflowing with grump in the morning, typically biting off toast and the occasional head, if he could.
But it fell away at night. It slipped away in lying down, in hearing Dean’s breath ebb and flow like the lapping tide. He hated his body until Dean touched it, until electricity danced in the wake of rough fingers sliding soft. Hated the shiver of goosebumps across his arms until Dean handed him his coat —”take it Cas, I’m not cold”—and then goosebumps gave way to warmth and the smell of leather and Dean. He hated waking up unless Dean was there, unless Dean’s warmth reached out across the sheets like Cas wished he could so many times. But it was still early. So Cas just watched, watched the rise of Dean’s back, studied its slope into the sheets that pooled around his waist. Counted freckles on Dean’s arm. Worried when Dean’s brow furrowed in a dream—
“I hate the desert,” Cas says, his voice gravelled and dry. Dean looks over, sees the sunburn beginning to settle across Cas’ cheekbones. He just hmm’s, too tired to speak. Cas eventually rises for the shower. Dean drifts off.
let him help and finally Cas caved and they were driving an hour each way to Home Depot on the weekends. Cas was helpless—he didn’t know the difference between a screwdriver and a saw—but Dean answered every question he had, even the stupid ones. Cas wondered where Dean had even learned all of this carpentry. He asked Sam but Sam had only looked confused—
“No, you shut up! Just listen to me for one second, god” Sam said, in that tone Dean hated. “I don’t care about you and Cas. Well, I do care in that I’m happy for you but Dean, you cannot avoid this. You have to talk to him,” Sam said. He could feel the temperature of the room drop, could see Dean’s knuckles go white on the machine’s rim.
“Nah, it just, it just has character, that’s all,” Dean said, rubbing his hand across his jaw. He leaned forward to adjust an ornament that hung on a weak branch, pulling the small twig down with its weight. As soon as he touched the branch the ornament slipped off, shattering on the ground.
“You did good today,” Dean says, stealing a glance at Cas, who’s unraveling a string on his jacket. He felt upset Dean had pulled away so quickly when he gave him his keys back. It’s not like they had an issue with touching each other. Dean always gave him a pat on the back or a fist bump occasionally. Whatever,         he thought. If Dean had a problem with it, then that’s exactly what it was. Dean’s problem.
Cas, something he only ever dreamed about a million times, but this time it was real. And Cas’ was serious, and Dean was serious, and fuck Cas’ look of
“You’re pretty quiet there, Cas, you okay?” Dean says, almost on cue. Cas smiles to himself faintly. He knows Dean is teasing himself by teasing Cas, poking at what’s hanging in the air between them without bothering to cut it down.
Cas pulled the blanket around him, ran his hands across his face. He looked up, stared into the fire, watched it slowly lick up the fireplace walls. The bunker was silent, apart from the crack of the fire as a log split. He watched it, watched it until the log’s fell apart. Watched it until the embers glowed low and then not at all, the room slowing plunging into darkness.
Cas flips the leather journal open, hands skimming across the blank pages. “It’s beautiful Sam, thank you. Really.” Dean reaches out and Cas hands it to him, standing now to gather his gifts from under the tree.
“I’m sorry for ignoring you. For acting like a total dick.” he says, smoothing down his jeans. He still can’t meet Cas’ eyes. “For, you know...” Dean trails off.
“Good,” Cas says, still staring. Dean looks over and smiles fully now, the hint of a blush splattering across his cheeks.
“Don’t ever think for one second I don’t,” Dean says, closing his eyes and leaning his head back against the window.
“I thought you regretted it. I thought you’d hate me,” Dean says and Cas is flipping them, pushing Dean against the wall.
“Look, Cas, if you’re gonna preach to me, save it,” Dean says, the words ringing out harsh—harsher than he’d intended.
they’ve seen it before. The memory flashes, that night Dean fell asleep on Cas’ shoulder. He woke up sometime later in the early a.m., eyes dry and scratchy, but he was tucked under the covers. Cas was sitting at the motel table reading something on a laptop, his brow furrowed. Dean remembers his breathing hitching, his effort to even it, his heart hammering. He tried not to move or catch Cas’ attention.
. But Dean was a great teacher—when he wasn’t busy watching. He watches Cas bite his tongue before each shot. Watches his hands rack the balls. He usually tries to not to peek when Cas bends over, leaning across the table, ass backing out but other times, Dean can’t resist. When he was being good he stood to the side, watching each of Cas’ biceps tense. Cas, on the other hand, was less cognizant of personal space, always standing just a hair too close. If it was anyone but Cas, Dean would’ve elbowed them off. But Cas was oblivious. And warm. And Cas.
“Shhh,” Dean said, his left hand rubbing up and down Cas back. The skin was taut under his shirt, hard muscle meeting smooth skin as Dean slipped his hand under the hem. He ran his nails down Cas’ back and Cas arched, exposing more of his neck to Dean.
Cas does as he’s told and the car jerks forward and stops abruptly, yanking both Dean and Cas in their seats.
It didn’t surprise Cas when she left not 30 minutes later. Dean would have to fix that later. Probably flowers. No, more like earrings.
“Order whatever you like, Cas,” Dean says over his menu. “It’s on me tonight. We’re celebrating.” Cas furrows his brow, gives that Cas look, even tilts his head to the side. Sometimes Cas does it for Dean’s amusement; sometimes he is really that confused.
Of all the horrible and idiotic things Cas has done in his life, and there have been many, this had to be the worst. Agreeing to go to Prom was not the worst part, hell it wasn’t even the second worst. The worst was the fact that he’d be third wheeling Dean and Lisa.
“What if I told you I loved you?” Cas said, completely serious but quietly. Dean didn’t think he’d heard him right. If Cas was being serious, even though Dean didn’t think he was, then Dean didn’t know what to say.
“I ain’t playing no pool,” the larger one says, “and I ain’t playing with no fucking faggots.” He’s stepped up now to stand next to the shorter one. He’s got a few inches on Dean but Dean doesn’t waver, only furthers his shit-eating grin. He’s fought off a hell of a lot worse than three bikers. And won, too.
Dean speaks first. “I just…” He says, putting the plate down into the sink, placing his hands on the counter’s rim. He glances at Cas, who’s staring down. They both staring down.
“Dean, they’re all great choices,” Sam said with a sigh. They’d been inside the store for over twenty minutes, some little boutique downtown that Dean had always walked right past on the way to the grocery store. He was supposed to be grocery shopping with Sam, but he just wanted to see if they had anything after catching a glimpse of a mannequin with a deep blue sweater. He was trying to pick something out for Cas but Sam was ruining it. Not only because he was there, which made Dean feel self-conscious that he was in a boutique anyways —let alone buying something for Cas—but also because he had no opinions. Not that Dean wanted them anyways.
“Happy New Year’s Eve,” the motel clerk says as Dean pushes out the door to leave. Dean pauses, faintly repeating it back as the door shuts behind him.
Cas stops punting to look down at the box in his hands. It’s heavy. He makes a show of holding it up to his ear and shaking it. “I hope it’s another pair of socks, I was really hoping for some blues ones—”
“Merry Christmas Cas!” Cas wakes up because Dean is shaking him, standing by his bed in his pajamas.
“Okay so when you start the car, which you do by putting the keys in the ignition, you always have your foot on the brake. Okay, Cas?” Dean says, hoping to get a nod or reply from Cas. Cas nods, and Dean continues.
About a month later, Cas and Dean are coming back from a hunt they completed, driving down the road with Led Zeppilin playing lightly through the speakers. Cas is reading Catch-22 in the passenger seat, while Dean simply drives and hums along to the familiar tune. Cas looks up for a minute when he suddenly spots a field of orange coming up ahead between the trees. He demands Dean pull over, and Dean complies, with a little confusion but overall carefree attitude. Once the car stops, Cas jumps out and runs to the trunk to grab his Polaroid. He runs past the trees and finds himself greeted by a field of orange poppies. They grow in every direction outward, and over the rolling hill in the distance. Cas felt the need to stop and just take in the scenery, too beautiful of a moment to pass up. Soon Dean catches up with him and just stands next to him in silence, admiring the view as much as he is admiring Castiel. Not sexually, because in stolen glances Dean gets enough of that, (well if it was Dean’s choice he’d had a lot more), but in a loving way. Cas seems just so at peace to Dean, the wind lightly blowing his hair and ruffling the expanse of Poppies that lay for seemingly endless miles ahead of then. It’s right then Dean decides he’s going to tell Cas he loves him. He doesn’t know how, when, or whether it’s even a good decision, but damnit Dean’s waited long enough and if he doesn’t tell someone he’s going to die a thousand deaths.  The sound of the Polaroid brings him out of his daze as Cas takes a shot of the field, waits a little, then plucks the film from the camera. They stand quietly and watch it develop right there, and when it does, Cas simply puts it in his pockets and smiles. It subtle, but it’s there. Dean puts his arm around Cas’ shoulder and directs him back to the car, hating to leave the view but knowing they should return to Sam. Cas agrees and heads back to the car, but not before demanding he get one of Dean and the Impala in front of the field. Dean tries to get out of it, hating the idea of being put on display like a model for a photo shoot, but does it anyway because it seems important to Cas. Cas directs Dean where to stand and to smile, and Dean does stand where Castiel places him, but the smiling is a little more difficult. It feels to fake for Dean; too rehearsed.
Lifted the sheets higher over Dean when the stupid A/C kicked in, drafting frigid air across the room. Almost tasted the sun as it danced across Dean’s neck, licking little sandy blonde hairs into fiery spires.
“How long was I out?” Dean asks, rubbing one hand along Castiel’s back. His nails are trailing up and down Cas’ left arm. Cas’ hair tickles under his jaw.
Cas springs his wish upon Dean on a quiet Sunday, both of them resting after a regular Salt & Burn that ended last night.
That sound you made when you had your first sip of hot chocolate. “Nothing, just thought it’d be fun,” Dean deflected.
Tonight, Dean tells himself to behave. He makes it through the break easy, giving Cas pointers from across the table. What he really wants to do is teach Cas right, teach him old fashioned. Get behind him, lean over him, take his hands in his own, and line up the shot. But he keeps his hands to himself. He fiddles with his beer. Picks at the label. Finishes it quickly. He orders another.
“Oh, just thought I’d say hi, make friends,” Dean says, mocking sincerity with a dazzling grin. “My partner and I need a team to play against.” He flicks his thumb at Cas. One of them scoffs, the other puffs. He doesn’t quite know where “partner” came from but he doesn’t stop to think. He only digs in his heels, doubling down. “You know, it’s hard playing pool alone. Holding those
That was another thing. Going to prom wasn’t just a nightmare because he was third-wheeling, it was a nightmare because somehow along there 6-going-on-7-year friendship, Cas had wound up in love with Dean. Dean didn’t know, nor would he ever, but seeing Dean in a suit and the idea of Prom filled his stomach with lead. He wished it were himself in the front seat, not an empty space that Lisa would soon take. He wanted nothing more than for Dean to have showed up one night with flowers and a sign that said “Prom?” but instead every night he was met with only a chorus of crickets. Cas had adjusted though. Made peace with it. But that didn’t make it any easier.
“Now, to make the car move, you take your foot off the brake and put it on the gas, just like this. See?” Dean says, making the impala crawl forward extremely slowly. Cas nods again and Dean gets out of the car, pops open the hood, and places the stick in place to keep it up. Cas follows suit and meets Dean at the front. Dean gives him a brief lesson of all the parts and how they work and what to do if your car over heats and whatnot.
“I was only going to ask if you were okay,” Cas says. He notices the swelling rising in Dean’s hand. He reaches over, brushing his fingertips from the knuckle down to the wrist. Dean’s skin is hot, nearly vibrating. It stills under Cas’ fingers, wisps of grace lick licking across Dean’s skin. They dance light blue across the back of Dean’s hand, somehow warming and cooling in the same breath. Dean says oh and then thank you, flexing his hand.
“I don’t know, how about we start with you not dying, huh? Seems like a good reason to me?” Dean says. Cas’ eyes flick over the menu.
He knows the inevitable drop-off will come, when he’s taken it too far, when he freaks Cas out. He thought it might have been just now, but Cas had just laughed. In fact, he’d laughed hard all night. Smiled more. Stood closer. Dean could’ve swore he might have leaned into his touch when he’d wrapped around him at the pool table. He thought he heard Cas’ breath hitch at first. But then he relaxed so slightly, became pliant in Dean’s hand, let himself be touched and guided, and brought his arm to rest against the length of Dean’s. Dean looks over at Cas now but he’s looking out the window, chin resting on his fist, the faintest smile hooked in his lips.
“Here just wiggle it like this,” Dean says, shaking the thing. He gets it undone and pushes it back across Cas chest to the side of the car. He looks up as he’s done and meets Cas’ blue-enough-to-paint-an-entire-sky eyes, whose pupils are full on dilated and Dean thinks ‘fuck it’. He’s done being a coward about his feelings for Cas and being unable to act on them and having this prolonged agony through fleeting touches, like today’s keys mishap. Dean thinks those are the only things he can smile about; times when Cas hugs just a little longer or when their fingers brush, and Dean knows Cas thinks nothing of it but to him they’re everything and-
The floor is hard. The cardboard is doing nothing to stop the chill that’s raking its long fingers up and down Cas bones. His back is throbbing, a dull ache that shoots every time he turns over. He’s turning over a lot. He feels like throwing up but there’s nothing in his stomach; there hasn’t been for three days.
“Fine. But breakfast better be more than amazing,” Cas said, slowly sliding out of bed to Dean’s relief. Dean left him alone to shower and change and then it was time for presents and breakfast.
“Dean,” Sam said, standing before the door. Dean had his back to him but he tensed, hand gripping a shirt.
“Okay well before you start, what do you do?” Dean says, quizzing Cas as to make sure they aren’t going to crash within the first three seconds Cas is behind the wheel.
By the time they made the eggnog and drank it all (the cookies didn’t make it farther than preheating the oven) they were properly trashed. Thankfully, Sam was out at some book signing or something nerdy. They spilled onto the couch, limbs tumbling into cushions and onto each other. Cas’ foot was brushing against Dean’s shin, just light enough to tickle. Neither moved away. Dean had lit a fire under the TV but neither of them got up to turn it on. They sat in silence for a moment, Dean scratched his arm. It was his nervous habit; Cas knew it well.
Breakfast was great, they mostly chatted about small stuff, but soon Dean was getting more and more eager to open presents, hoping-no, knowing Cas would love his present.
“Okay.” Cas replies, beginning to think and ponder certain dates and whether they were better than others or whether he should just pick any random date on a calendar and call it a day.
Inside it’s your typical Southwestern fare; turquoise motifs, poorly painted navajo designs, chips at the table. Dean goes to get them a table. There’s a young brunette as a hostess tonight, but the restaurant’s not too full. She’s flirting with Dean until Cas comes up behind him, leans in very close, whispers something dry in Dean’s ear. Dean pushes him off, laughing, apologizing to her. Her eyes widen a hair. She kinda flusters, says a quiet "if you’ll follow me" and disappears. They follow her and Dean sorts laughs to himself—it’s not the first time they’ve been treated as an item—but when Cas follows closely in tow, hand bumping into his, Dean’s mind circles back.
“Wait Cas...have you had a Christmas before?” Dean asked, leaning forward over the table. Their shoulders brushed as Dean propped his arm up to rest his head on his fist.
“It’s okay, Dean, I understand. I’m sorry I shouldn’t have done that,” Cas whispers, turning to leave the car and a very confused Dean.
Though they weren’t really talking right now, in the Impala, it wasn’t awkward. Dean never felt awkward around Cas.
In the car Dean’s adrenaline is still blazing through his veins. He’s wringing his hands on the steering wheel and gritting his teeth. His breaths are coming out deep and low.
In the morning he runs into him in the kitchen. Cas freezes and Dean goes rigid at the kitchen sink, his back tensing under his shirt. Cas stands there silently. Dean lowers the plate in his hands.
“Really?” Cas says, having expected Dean to laugh in his face, saying something like he’d never drive, or that their was no need for him to learn, or whatever. Cas grins slightly, and turns around to walk off towards the entrance to the bunker.
Sam smiles. “Glad you like it. And that’s a journal Cas, so you can write whatever you’re feeling or your day or whatever you like.”
“Yea, since when did you bake, Dean?” Sam said, mocking sincerity. It was a fair quip; Dean had been jabbing at him all day.
“Good,” Dean says. He bends his arms to rest between them on the top of the seat. His elbow brushes Cas’ shoulder, just barely.
“I....fuck, I” Dean says, staring at his hands as they fidgeted in his lap. His face was flushing again and he cursed under his breath.
The din of their hyena laughs fall flat as Dean steps up to them, putting his hands in his pockets, nodding his chin at them. Each turns to face him, ruddy faced, slightly sweating, their greasy hair slicked back. Dean thinks they’re too young to be real bikers. Probably couldn’t tell a muffler from a spring fork. They’re just shadows of forgotten fathers, still playing with their toys in the street. Children having grown old and big and drunk.
“Hmmm, I’d like to be a better cook. Keep the bunker cleaner. And maybe eat healthier, I don’t know.” Dean trails off at the end, returning to his menu. Cas expected the first two, even if Dean is already a great cook and keeps the bunker meticulously spotless. For leaving a coffee mug out here or there, Cas has become the resident slob—according to Dean. The last one surprises him, though. Dean’s poor diet had  always been one of the founding pillars of
“No I’m not you’re fucking babysitter, Dean. Because unlike a babysitter, I’m not getting paid to take care of you.”
“It wasn’t so much kissing as making out Dean,” Cas says with a grin, “and yes I did. You didn’t smile in the other failed picture, but I’ll be a damn idiot if you’re not smiling in this one.”
“I want you to always carry it. I never want you stuck somewhere without it. I blessed it and carved the sigils, so you should be the only one who can touch it.”
But Cas cannot shake Dean’s coarse edges, the bits that snag Cas’ skin, cut him in passing. Wounds that he will pick at. Pick at if only to test that they still hurt. “Cas, buddy, You can’t stay.” A betrayal. A miscommunication. The refusal not to understand. Eyes that do not meet. Hands that flex at Dean’s side, hands that shake Cas, knuckles kissed before they make contact with Cas’ jaw. A week without speaking. Bristling tension, skin that burns at the touch, a pot boiling over in the kitchen, a fight in the bunker’s living room. Thoughts made manifest into words, words that should have stayed thoughts. A lie. An omission of truth. Landmines hidden in plain sight, self-fulfilling prophecies, traps Dean sets so they can be sprung. The same wound tearing open and open again although it bled dry years ago, but the pain is somehow always a surprise. Always fresh.
“Come on, Cas, it’s New Year’s Eve! That was just dinner,” Cas sighs but eventually gives in to Dean’s pull. Dean was really in a mood now—he was rarely this excited, especially after a long day in the grueling heat. He was usually dead in the motel, three beers in, face down in the bed, clothes still on.
“Hey, I’m back!” Sam called from the top of the stairwell. FUCK. Limbs slammed into limbs as they scrambled apart, Dean’s hand knocking Cas’ across the back of the head. They just made it to opposite ends of the couch as Sam turned the corner, signed book in hand.
“Oh, you guys just took longer than unusual,” Cas said over a bite. Sam just laughed. Dean became suddenly very interested in the milk carton’s ingredients. Ingredients: Milk.
“Why wouldn’t I be?” Cas replied, not even looking away from the TV. It was just Prom. It wasn’t a funeral. And Cas hated dances. Dean knew that. They’re 6-going-on-7 year friendship meant that Dean had found out every quirk, pet peeve, and disgust Cas had. And Dances were the top of the disgust list.
“Hey did you know it was New Year’s Eve?” Dean says, reaching out for his bag from Cas hand. Cas passes it over.
“I thought this one would work?” Cas said, standing in close to Dean. Dean nodded, walking around the tree in fake inspection.
Dean tried making conversation with Lisa, but his words were slurred and honestly Cas felt pretty bad for Lisa. He boyfriend was shitfaced and now she was stuck with him acting like a fucking dumbass.
“Hey baby,” Dean said snapping Cas out of his thoughts. Lisa climbed into the Impala, looking absolutely amazing, before giving Cas a wave. Cas nodded and smiled weakly, and she turned back to Dean. Dean smiled at her and then drove off, whether to their high school or Hell Cas couldn’t tell anymore. At this point though, they were the same thing.
“No way Cas. There’s no way your gonna spend you birthday in bed. Come out, we’ve made you breakfest, and then we’ve got more things to do. And sleeping in bed all day is not one of them.” Dean said, pulling the covers off Cas’ body. Fortunately, Cas slept in only boxers, and Dean quickly stole a glance at that perfect ass before Cas turned over and Dean looked away. There was nothing more that Dean wanted then to just climb inside the bed and cuddle with Cas all day, but this was Cas and he had feelings, and none of them were for Dean, and Dean wasn’t going to fuck it up because he was a hopeless romantic for someone he couldn’t have.
Dean can’t even remember the last time they had a tree. They never really had them as kids—Christmas was not exactly a Winchester affair. Dad was gone most of them anyways. Dean had always tried to do something for Sam but with no money and being a kid, it was mostly just watching motel TV and seeing snow, if they were lucky. It’s why Sam’s never big on Christmas every year; always brings back shadows of sorry memories. Dean always went with the flow, didn’t want to push Sam, but he always secretly wished Sam would budge and maybe one year they’d get a tree. Do more than just get wasted on eggnog, eat take-out, exchange gifs wrapped in newspaper, and pass out early. Gifts from Sam were always small and practical; Dean’s were wildly immature.
“So you won’t be mad….if I have it then...since it’s not yours,” Cas said, bringing the glass up to his lips.
“Jesus Cas, that’s not Christmas, that's Bible Camp,” Dean snorted. “You guys didn’t do anything fun? Give gifts? Get hammered?”
I have never needed someone more in my entire life and every moment without you feels like I’m suffocating.
“You don’t have another car, but I do,” Dean says on his way to the Impala. He slides his fingers across the back before giving it a light bump with his fist.
Dean pulls into a restaurant that looks decent enough but not too nice. Dean wishes they could afford better but this stolen card is at the end of its road. He wishes Cas and him could have a nice meal for once. Eat something real. He imagines Cas across from him, reading over the menu. Maybe someplace where they put a candle on the table.
“Cas…” Dean says, trying to stop Cas’ mouth, which is running a hundred miles a minute. “Cas, it’s okay!” Dean says, grabbing his arm. Dean’s touch anchors Cas and he calms a bit.
“Yea what the fucks up with that? Dude Cas, you’re a total catch,” Dean said before taking a gulp of a clear liquid. Vodka or water Cas had no idea.  Hopefully it was water.
So Cas doesn’t say anything, he just joins Dean at the counter, pours himself a coffee. He turns and leans back against the counter and thinks of something else to say, something that he hasn’t already said a hundred times. He stares at his reflection in the coffee's surface, watch it dance in distortion. He doesn't recognize himself in the rippling surface. Or even the mirror, he thinks.
“Good,” Cas says, teasing grin on blast and he has to duck from Dean’s fist as he tries to lightly punch Cas’ shoulder. Dean lets out an exasperated sigh, another
Dean’s eyes burned from the residual desert heat. He felt dirty. He looked it too. Sand was gritting across his skin in places it had
One night he was standing behind Dean as Dean leaned down to take a shot, his chest laying nearly flush with the table. He felt Cas hovering and when he looked back and saw Cas standing over him, saw his ass backed up to Cas’ crotch, saw Cas leaning with one hand on the table, Dean’s arms jerked through the shot. His arms had practically gone soft; all the blood had rushed south. Cas shot him a confused look—Dean almost never missed—but Dean was busy ignoring him as he chugged down his beer.
“Hey before we go,” Dean says, pulling Cas in, “Just one more.” Cas of course agrees, and what was supposed to be a little peck turns into a full out make-out session. They kissed longer, deeper, and soon enough a rap on the window broke both of them from the haze of shallow breaths and quick heartbeats to the real world. Sam was outside, already turned back to the front door and walking that way.
“God Dean what the hell is wrong with you” Cas asked, plugging his nose before gulping his down. He immediately felt the burn and grimaced, to which Dean bellowed at, only handing Cas another shot.
“Now we go back, get wasted, and put it up,” Dean said, grinning across to Cas. Now it was Cas’ turn to roll his eyes.
Cas’ hands are hiking up under Dean’s shirt, not lifting it off yet but simply scratching long trails across Dean’s shoulder blades. Dean rolls Cas over and now Cas is on top, straddling Dean. He maneuvers back and lifts Dean’s legs, letting them wrap around his waist. Dean tenses at first, surprised. The shock is replaced by a new heat tumbling down towards his dick. He grabs a fist full of Cas’ shirt, yanks him down towards him, tightens his legs around Cas’ waist. Cas starts rolling his hips into Dean’s ass and Dean moans into Cas’ mouth, unapologetic and loud.
“Cas, stop staring” Dean would say. The softest hint of a smile? On that mouth, that mouth pressing deep into that pillow. Pressing deep against Cas’, in every day dream, hinted in every hitched breath when Dean stands a little too close, licks his own. Dean pushed Cas’ shoulder with his hand, not bothering to open his eyes.
“Hey, let’s get you cleaned up,” he said. Cas nodded. The stillness of the air gave way to movement, the heat returning to the room, and the moment had passed—whatever it was. Dean’s hand still rested on Cas’ shoulder as he guided him out.
“Yea. It’s New Year’s Eve, let’s go out. Come on, it beats sitting here all night,” Dean says, grabbing a change of clothes. Dean thinks Cas might put up a fight, moan about being tired—Dean is beat too—but he only shrugs.
Please be patient with me. I know I’m fucked up and I will probably screw this up and hurt you and I don’t want to do that. Please don’t let me do that.
“Cas, this is—where did you find this?” Dean asks, slowly flipping through the pages. He looks up at Cas now, his face equal parts surprise and holy fuck, how are you, you and Cas just shrugs.
“Hiyaa Cas,” Dean said, trying to shelter the glass from Cas’ view by moving in front of it. His movement was a little too quick and somehow also too slow.
Dean wanted to talk to him. He did. He had a million things to say and a million things to regret. How do you say:
Dean’s heart was already beating hard, but when Cas settled back and laid his hand to rest against Dean’s knee, just so slightly, Dean felt it skitter out of rhythm. In the light and the silence, Cas’ face flushed. Dean told himself it was the booze, that Cas was just a lightweight, and that he was being a fool by sitting forward, propping an arm behind him. Cas’ sleepy eyes widened just slightly as Dean inched forward.
“Then don’t speak.” Cas is kissing him now, softly, but Dean pulls back. His eyes widen because fuck, Cas just kissed him. While sober. In the daylight. In the greenhouse. Cas kissed him.
“I’m sorry, I was just drunk and I, I, I crossed a line. I won’t do it again,” Cas reached out to touch Dean’s hand but Dean was already standing, already backing out. He’d said about all he could. Every word was like a fresh brand into his side. He was trying, he was, but there was only so much a guy could take.
Cas couldn’t dance. In fact, he was horrible at anything involving coordination. But Dean didn’t care, he just tried to make Cas enjoy himself.
Dean notices Cas’ surprise. He waves his hand. “I don’t know, I’m not twenty anymore.” He says, shrugging. “Even if I still look like it,” he adds, winking at Cas with a shit eating grin. Now Cas really rolls his eyes. He flags down a waitress.
“You’re kidding.” Dean says, putting his hands on Cas shoulders. “Please tell me you did not just take a picture of us kissing.” Dean says, sliding a hand down his face.
“Thank you,” Dean says, after a while. “For coming and getting me, Cas. Thank you, I...I’m sorry...I’m sorry...I’m trying."
“Dean I’ve been alive for millions of years, the last thing on my mind is my birthday, but to answer you’re question, well…I don’t know” Cas says, putting down his book, “I’ve never really thought about it”
Dean’s attention is still rapt on the book when Sam coughs and when he looks up, he realizes they’re waiting for him. He gently places the book on the coffee table and gathers his gifts, passing them out.
“What? Are you okay? What hurts?” Dean said, running his hand over Cas’ arms, touching his shirt, pulling it back expecting to see red.
“Let me grab my jacket and keys, and I’ll meet you outside, okay?” Dean says as he rounds the corner for the hallway to his room, his voice light and quite from the distance.
God Cas was such an asshole. Dean was clearly just trying to have goodtime, maybe even with Cas there, and he was acting like a fucking dick. He was being such a downer, when clearly this meant something to Dean. Fuck, he was such an idiot. Cas felt like he needed to make it up to Dean, so he danced, and smiled. And acted like it was fine. And with Dean and Lisa dancing with him, it sorta was.
He leaned back in and then they were kissing rough, Dean reaching up to thread his hands through Cas hair. Cas sat forward and placed a hand on Dean’s chest. Dean only leaned in harder, crushing Cas’ lips with his own. The smell and taste of Vodka reminded Cas this was all so fragile, only the next morning would let Cas know if any of this was anything at all, or simply Dean letting off steam he lost when he blew his chance with Lisa.
“It’s okay, I’m sure it understands,” Cas says with a slight grin. Dean chuckles. In the silence, he pulls his hand out from behind his back. It’s a gift wrapped box—it even has a bow—and he hands it to Cas. He scratches his arm.
“Get in the car I’ll meet you out there!” Dean yelled, rushing across the living room to a Sammy’s room.
“I just....need time, Cas. I just need time.” Cas is about to say something when Dean puts his hands on his shoulder,
“Alright let’s go I don’t want to keep Sam waiting,” Cas says, leaving Dean to slide towards the passenger door. Dean agrees with a little bit of defeat in his voice.
Dean freezes. Cas comes to stand up behind him and Dean can feel his breath on his neck. Cas raises his hand to Dean’s elbow, his hand just lingering, barely there. Dean turns to Cas and his eyes meet his, ice blue and lined with hurt. Dean swallows.
The blade is heavy. Fingers feeling cold, metal feeling warm. It is still in his grip. It does not vibrate like before.
Knowing he’s about to get thrown out, he grabs his jacket, Cas, and they bolt. Cas is wide-eyed but doesn’t waver, simply let’s Dean drag him out of the bar as the manager appears in the corner. They’re in the Impala and skidding out of the parking lot before he can even get their plates.
and when Cas remained completely lax, head rolling, Dean had taken him up in his arms and hugged him, gripped him so tight, his breaths coming out ragged, his eyes misting over. Cas had slowly come to, stirring in Dean’s arms and Dean sighed out in relief, but didn’t let go for a moment longer, just squeezed his eyes shut and Cas tighter. He thought he felt Cas’ hands softly tighten around him but soon panic turned to worry and he pulled back. He searched Cas eye’s—blue as a stove top flame— for hurt or blood or a sign that Cas was okay.
“Well Mr. New Year’s Eve, what are your resolutions then?” Dean asks, pulling down Cas’ menu with the tip of his finger. Cas reads the menu all the way down to the table, fascinated by the "nacho-quesso-rrito".
“Dean,” Cas says, looking up from the fully developed Polaroid, “it’s absolutely perfect.” Cas says, taking the Polaroid in his hands and trying to figure out how he can take a picture himself.
Cas is watching a police rerun Dean’s sure he’s already seen when he steps out. He’s changed now, out of his dirty clothes and into jeans and a t-shirt. It’s bizarre seeing Cas casual sometimes. Dean knows he can’t wear the trench coat everywhere, especially trudging through the desert, but seeing Cas in jeans and tee just seems,
He’s taking forever, he knows. The water’s already gone cold. In the frigid stream, he crosses his arm across his face so he can bite into the skin. He doesn’t think about Cas. Well, he tries not to think about Cas. Tries not to think about his taut skin, how the water kissed his chest, the little tufts of hair peeking out above his jeans. He bites down harder now, suppressing the whimper that’s rising through him. The orgasm rocks through him hard, leaving him weak in its wake. He has to lean against the shower wall, take a few breaths. He turns the shower off.
Cas doesn’t know what to say. He had so many words to explain what he was thinking in teaming with Crowley, so many sentences that made sense, motivations that were pure. They were pure once but they soiled, ran rancid, rotted in the distance between then and now. They fail him as he stands there. Like he failed Dean. Another apology would only drive the knife deeper, anger Dean until the plate was flying at the wall and shattering, porcelain shards scattering across the tile—a mocking applause. Cas would bend to pick them up and Dean would yell something like “You’re not the fucking maid! Just go.” and Cas would go and lock himself in his room again and turn off the lights and wait.
“I guess I just lost track of time,” Dean says, crossing the lot towards their room’s door. New Year’s Eve must explain the motel’s business; they only had a single with a queen.
“Don’t do this to me Dean. Don’t fuck with me like this,” Cas said putting his head in his hands. Why Dean would think that pretending to actually romantically like him made him want to punch him square in the jaw. In fact, Cas planned on it. He turned to look at Dean before he swung, but Dean was 3 inches from his face.
“So I’ve heard,” Cas says, laughing. He steps in. It was a typical dive bar, no rougher than places they’d been before. There were two underaged girls nervously standing around at the front, a couple of guys throwing darts, a rowdy group of bikers in the back.
They spend another hour or so on the road, Cas learning to park and reverse and turn and a few other things. The sunlight begins to fade and Dean checks his watch. 6:30.
“Dinner’s ready,” he says, leaning against the frame. His hands fumble over themselves, his mouth fumbles over what he can’t say. He waits. He knows Dean is on the other side, he’s been inside his room all day. Another minute.
“How long?” Dean says, so quietly Cas almost misses it. Cas looks back at him now, a seriousness settling in his gaze. He pushes himself up on Dean’s chest a little.
“No Dean really I feel sick,” Cas said, “I think I’m just gonna call my mom to come pick me up,” Cas said, fishing out his phone. Dean grabbed it before he could even unlock it, and put it in his coat pocket.
“Hey,” is all he starts with. Cas looks up from the plant he’s potting, surprised widening in his eyes. Dean hates himself immediately, hates every second he spent ignoring Cas, hates that he kissed him, hates that he hates that he kissed him. Hates that he never kissed him years ago.
“I gave everything for you. I sacrificed Heaven, my grace!” Cas was starting to yell, anger pulsing through him all the way to the tips of his fingerprints. “I fell for you, I killed so you could live, I died for you.” Tears were creeping in at the edges of Cas’ eyes now, but he couldn’t stop himself. His mouth was speaking from his heart, direct line. “I did all of that for you!”
“So I’ve heard,” Dean replies, grinning against the roll of Cas’ eyes that he can’t see but can seriously feel anyways. Cas just laughs. Dean reaches down and pulls the covers over them, settles in, and turns off the lamp.
“Smiling is hard Cas.” Dean says, making up the shittiest excuse, so maybe Cas will realize it just will not happen and that’s that. If Cas wants a picture, then fine, but smiling was never part of the deal.
Cas knew that was coming. He sat back down on the couch, starting to regret everything about this night. Once again he’d made it all about himself. God, why did he have to be such an assho-
“Earth to Cas. You done?” Dean asks, looking at Cas’ plate. Cas realizes he’d drifted off a little. “Yes, sorry, go ahead.” Dean pulls the plate over and eats a little off it.
“God, you are so infuriating. Did you ever stop to think maybe I fucking wanted this? That I want to be here, that I want to be with
“My dads out of town and there’s a handle of vodka in the cabinet. So get comfortable kids, because were about to get wasted.” Dean said, running to the bathroom. Cas simply laughed and sat down on the couch, loosening up his tie. Lisa sat down next to Cas, taking off her heels.
Dean hears the sound, breaking the kiss and swiveling his head around until he comes face to face with Cas’ camera, outstretched on Cas’ hand. Cas clearly caught them on camera making out, and Dean was speechless. Cas simply grinned and put the ejected film into his pocket.
Cas is staring at the glimmering stars. The feeling he had earlier is returning, that particular warmth, settling in deep somewhere within his ribcage. Of course, Dean didn’t have to fight those guys. He shouldn’t have walked over to them in the first place. But he did. He did because they were teasing Cas. Because he hated it. Because they were teasing
, never comes. The adrenaline that had coursed through Dean all night, that caused his skin to sizzle under Cas’ touch, to hum, had receded. It left him exhausted in its wake, the heat of the day sinking deep into his bones. But so did Cas’ warmth, radiating into his chest as Cas’ breath slowed, eyes closing.
Cas looked wiped too, slumping against the doorway as Dean slid in the key. They fall inside and into the A/C, Dean moaning as he collapses on the bed. Cas sits down in the chair, leaning back, pinching the bridge of his nose.
It dawned on Cas that Dean was actually way out of his element but was faking it, only pretending he knew what he was doing. He guessed Dean must have found help online or called Home Depot when Cas wasn’t paying attention.
“No Cas! Stop saying that! Why do you think like that? Cas anyone would be lucky to have you as a date.” Dean said, pacing the floor. Cas was getting a little annoyed at Dean. Why couldn’t he just accept the fact that no one like him and move on? Cas already had. He knows hes awkward and nerdy. Everybody does. Why did Dean always have to insist the otherwise?
Dean can’t read Cas’ face because he’s looking down into the box. He keeps looking down, slowing reaching in to pull out the 5 inch knife. The knife is a typical hunter’s knife but the blade is sturdy, a beautiful walnut shade. It is not the color that stops Cas but the intricate carving, the swirling celtic knots that run down the handle’s spine. They’re delicately intertwined but meticulously carved, stained a little darker for contrast. On each side are anti-demon and anti-monster sigils respectively. but Carved at the bottom of the handle are Cas’ initials in Enochian.
Putting up the tree took longer than Dean had anticipated. First, they couldn’t decide where to put it.
shirt—inches up his back to flash a strip of skin. Dean swallows hard. He tries not to look down, tries to focus on Cas’ shot. The angle’s all wrong though; Cas will hit the eight instead. It happens subconsciously: Dean leaning over him, sliding his hand down Cas’ arm to rest lightly on his hand. He doesn't even realize he’s doing it until he’s there, until Cas is warm under his chest, until Dean can smell patchouli and pine, until Cas’ hair is tickling his cheek. He tries not to think about it, tries to keep enough distance between them so that Cas can’t feel his heart hitched beat echoing in his ribcage.
