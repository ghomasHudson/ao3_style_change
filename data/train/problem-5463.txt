“Castiel showed up.” Dean answered.
Colette sent.
There was a knock, eventually, on the closet door, “Gabriel? We’re finished closing up, just wanted you to know.” Hannah’s voice called from outside the door. Gabriel reached up and pushed the door open, “Thanks Hannah, I appreciate it. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Like fuck you will.” Bobby huffed, “Work on Cain’s cars if ya need to stay busy. But if you come in, I’ll throw you out.”
“C-College.” Dean managed to say, feeling tears build up again quite without his permission. His chest felt too tight.
him. Like-
Dean glared at her
Gabriel’s entire demeanor changed. He slid closer to Dean, glaring at the photo, “Looks like a cunt—Meg, you got shit taste in women.”
“If that’s ok with you, Dean?” Colette asked.
“Of course he can.” Missouri argued, “You got the mark on your arm to prove it. Looks like he bit it again recently?”
The noises only got louder and the smells got weirder. Dean couldn’t open his eyes, his hands over his face. Everything smelled like distress, but his
Dean couldn’t quite believe it. Sure, their house was nice. Cain had a few cars. But it wasn’t
Dinner was fantastic. The wings were some of the best that Dean had ever had and it was the most relaxed he felt in a while. He was proud of himself for being coming this far. At the end of dinner, Ana went for the side exit—complaining about too many alphas crowding the front. Dean followed her. He had too many wins to count, he didn’t need to prove a point by walking through the now massive crowd of people watching the football game on the TVs up front.
“I’m serious. You know I will. Dean, ain’t nuthin’ wrong with focusing on yourself for a bit.” That was his therapist talking, but Dean wasn’t going to say that. Bobby’s therapist had been good for him, slowly dragging him out of the depression that gripped him so tight Dean thought he might lose him. Karen died of pancreatic cancer six years ago and Bobby hadn’t been the same since. It was only a year and a half after Dean and Sammy had started living at their house. It was similar to John’s depression in that Bobby found comfort at the bottom of a bottle. However, Bobby hadn’t turned to anger. He soldiered on as best as he could—going to Sam’s basketball games and going to work. But Dean knew that he was barely keeping it together. Dean had started taking over a bit more at the garage, helping him organize employee schedules. Dean was worried they wouldn’t listen to an omega, but no one had given him flack, “I know it’s hard to talk when you’re like this, but if you
“I know—I wouldn’t mind being in the middle of that sandwich.”
Then the whole story about his panic attack.
Dean’s whole body hurt when he woke up. His cold and unfriendly walls made him want to curl back up in bed and not get out. The heating pad on his bed was cranked up, which meant Bobby had come in to check on him and couldn’t get a response. Dean looked at his phone and it was eleven, so Bobby had tried to get him to go to work. He hated days like today. Where his body would just shut down and refuse to work for him. And he was angry.
“Is there a car you ain’t good at workin, cher?” Benny asked.
Dean’s hand was sweaty from how long he had been holding Castiel’s hand. It was also stiff from gripping so hard. Dean slowly let go, looking over to Castiel’s bright blue eyes.
“Wh-whats gunna hap-happen to us?” Dean asked.
“I can go get some.” Dean said, “What do you guys want?”
Then one morning, a new car was in the garage that Dean had not worked on. It wasn’t a classic, but it was still a very expensive ride. Dean saw a note on his work bench.
“Well, if I ever meet that boy, smacking him is the
“Your ARS got worse once Sam left?” Dean nodded, his throat closing up, “It’s alright, sugar. We don’t have to talk about him until you’re ready.” Dean nodded.
“Wish someone did that while I

wasn’t fair.
He tried to go back to sleep, closing his eyes and willed everything to go away. He ached. He rolled over so he was on his stomach and had to bite back a groan. His hips couldn’t help but twitch again, enjoying the friction. Dean’s breathing escalated.
“He—Cain—” The words stuck in his throat. He glared at the tree line in front of him like it was its fault that words struggled to come out. Bobby was patient, as per usual, just content to sit and wait until Dean could say what he needed, “S’weird.”
The alpha left. Because of course he did. That’s just what happened.
“H-how l-long wi-will I st-stay here?” Dean asked.
Dean nodded, “Cain worked for them. They’re your b-brothers?”
It was a bit chilly outside and he could smell the pine trees. He took a deep breath, willing himself to calm down. His first breath was shaky, he couldn’t get a deep enough breath. He let it out slowly, his breath visible in the slight chill. It took a while since his chest was still too tight around his lungs but it was still faster than he expected. It was proof that his body was already adjusting to an alpha, because he already felt like his breaths were deeper than what they had been in years. He hated that it was this quick. This
“I moved out here basically as soon as I could. I was lucky enough where my parents funded my college—I think it was more to get me out of town as well. But I came out here, I met people that supported me and helped me figure everything out myself.” He smiled brightly, “It helped me talk to my parents in a much better way. Teenage angst man, I couldn’t talk to my parents in a productive way. It took time, and it took me apologizing too. Not for what I am—but for how I spoke. They apologized too! We all went to therapy together, we had to put in work to love each other again. It was difficult. Now I work in finance for a music production business out in LA. No one back home ever believes I work in finance looking like this, but in California they don’t really dress in suits, you can wear whatever you want. My parents come in visit, this is a picture of us last week.” The screen showed two parents looking ridiculously proud. His mom was kissing Billie’s cheek, squeezing him tight. And his Dad was laughing, one arm wrapped around Billie as well.
“No—you’re not.” Dean agreed, “You’ll probably present soon.”
“Come on.” Cain pulled him close, making Dean huff.
“Your l-little b-brother is y-your alpha?” Dean asked Gabriel. He felt like he was going to throw up.
Dean and Castiel spent the rest of the afternoon stripping down the Ford pick-up, after they had taken around a hundred or so pictures. Dean was careful to get all the rusted details. Upon further inspection of the vehicle, Dean found a few problems with it that were pretty massive. Castiel had probably over paid for it, but he wasn’t going to let him know that. Dean was a bit worried that the alpha would rattle on, but they worked in companionable silence. Castiel asked questions occasionally, and let Dean answer them slowly. Though his stutter had massively improved, it hadn’t gone away completely.
“Nearly eleven.” Colette responded, “Missouri got here a little bit ago. I told her we were letting you sleep.”
“You ok?” Cas appeared next to him and Dean relaxed a bit. The four alpha males at the table the waitress had picked the drink up from were all staring at him. Dean didn't realize how conscious he was of their presence until Castiel was there.
Sometimes you have a plan, then that plan doesn't happen so you have to immediately throw it out the window.
“You more of an ass or dick guy during heat?” Gabe asked.
“The meds help with the woozy feeling.” Cindy told him, showing him the items she had collected for him, “There are a few heat packs in there as well.”
“Dean.” Colette grinned as Dean walked into the kitchen, “How are you feeling?”
“We’ll come join you and Colette after this. I have a few discussion points.” Missouri told him. Cain nodded, sliding the door closed again.
“To put it mildly.” Judy said with a kind smile. They walked back into the main living room; Jody plopped down on one of the chairs and Ana sat near her.
Dean opened a closet door and was grateful it was a small closet. He dropped down to the floor, putting his head between his knees. He put his hands over his head, trying not to hear all the thoughts in his head.
“Will you text me when you work on the car again?” Castiel asked.
“Word has got out, I am afraid.” She said with a laugh, “I was telling Ana about this car, how it was almost done. I showed her pictures and she asked who was helping you, since she knew Cain wasn’t doing the work.”
“And the other alpha?” Castiel asked.
brother
Another bit Dean noticed was that he was still very anxious around unknown alphas. He wasn't sure what would help him relax more, but he noticed the closer he was to Cain the better off he felt. Cain admitted that he was a bit territorial, so he usually put an arm or hand on Dean when around a bunch of alphas. It helped Dean when they were in the grocery store together.
. Someone was grabbing him, but he couldn’t breathe. Everyone was staring at him. He couldn’t protect Sammy.
.” Dean begged, “I’ll be good, I swear. I swear it.” Dean cried into his hands, tucking in on himself.
“Of course, I got work in my office.” Cain said.
Gabriel brought back three glasses of scotch on the rocks and an entire tray full of sweets. Dean sat on the floor, eating and taking small sips. He still wasn’t drinking too much, but now it wasn’t nearly as bad as it used to be. Gabriel told stories about customers, making Dean cry from laughter. The tightness in his chest loosened as Gabriel told stories. Dean couldn’t remember the last time he laughed that hard. Gabriel knew he had an audience, so his stories became more and more dramatic.
“You are suffering from a severe form of ARS—Alpha Rejection Syndrome.” He didn’t say it coldly, or with an overly sweet voice.
Dean opens up a bit more.
. No matter how many times Dean read through different books, no one had figured out when a person would present. It was infuriating. He walked through the small stash of food for Sammy he had set aside in case Dean went into heat. Sammy was aware enough to know the basics. Dean didn’t know whether to be relieved or not as he started his freshman year of high school without presenting. Nearly all his classmates already had.
“I’ll call when I receive the paper work.” Karen said. Bobby nodded, then walked out the door.
to kiss him again. For being a bit shorter, Castiel sure did know how to dominate a kiss. Dean couldn’t help but wind one hand into his thick hair that had been
“Are you sexually active?” Missouri asked.
Cain made an unpleased grumble that made Dean wince, “Please stay here, we can take care of you until you feel well enough.” Dean whined without his permission again, “My dear boy.” Cain huffed, wrapping his arm around Dean as well. Dean had no idea how long all three of them sat on the floor. Cain purring, Colette rubbing his back. His legs were locked into place for so long that they ached.
“Hey!” Ash smiled brightly, moving around the bar to Dean.
“I can introduce you, if you’d like.”
“Sure boss.” Came the reply.
“Ok, I got you a set of heat ones here.” Cain pulled a set out of the linen closet, “Or, not me, Colette did. But I told her to order them because she knows which ones are best.” He confessed.
He didn’t want to think about the dried bits in his hair.
it. The muscles in his back slowly relaxed as he leaned closer to Cain. He finally was able to pull his head up a bit, but seeing both Colette and Cain under the blanket with him sent another shock of shame through his system. He pulled his legs in tighter.
“Stick your needle in me, Doc.” Dean waggled his brows.
“It doesn’t stop you from having them, however. Many patriarchal bull shit alphas point to those studies and say an omega could have shut down their estrus if they truly ‘didn’t want it.’ It’s all nonsense, obviously.”
“Baked for Baked.” Dean said.
“Shit—sorry Dean. You surprised me.” Castiel let out a slow breath.
“What happened to your alpha?” Cain asked as he slid over the best bacon and egg sandwich Dean had ever seen with a side of home fries. Dean glared at him, knowing he wouldn’t be able to resist such a tempting offering. It was a peace offering as Cain asked a question that Dean didn't want to talk about. And Cain
Dean definitely went back to work with a pep in his step.
“Nest.” Cain grumbled sleepily.
. She took it all in stride, now texting Dean if she would be even thirty seconds behind schedule. Sharing her location on Find My Friends also helped. Dean could tell when she was
Dean huffed, putting his head between his knees. He put his hands over top of his head, wishing the floor would swallow him up. This was
“Dean?” Cain looked back. Dean had turned back to the car, determined to get a few more things done, “Colette should be home soon, but we had planned for you to stay for dinner if you can.” Dean nodded and Cain’s eyes brightened before he closed the garage door behind him.
“You’re awake?”
“Can y-you take it to Bobby’s? On m-main street?”
being abused.” Dean huffed. Castiel smiled, placing a kiss on top of Dean’s head. Dean flushed pink, his entire body warming up again as Castiel walked out of the room.
“That Bobby?” Cain asked; Dean nodded, “You tell him about what happened?” Dean nodded again as he sat down on a bar stool.
He heard a loud bang, which made him jump, “Sammy?” Dean called out again. It was coming from the direction of the bed rooms. Maybe someone had broken in?
“Dean and I are going to talk alone first, if the two of you don’t mind. We’ll all come together for a talk after a while.” Missouri looked to Colette and Cain.
It was difficult to get out of bed in his weakened state, so he knew Colette was right. She helped him into the bathroom, guiding him to sit down on the toilet once they got inside. He was already exhausted from walking the few short steps. The massive bathtub filled with water since this was a bougie bathroom with a standalone tub. Colette had to help him take off his t-shirt, which even he could smell because it was so horrible. He took his own socks off, then waited for the tub to fill enough so he could get in. His hair felt like it was slicked to his head.
“It’s alright.” Dean said, placing the now empty glass on her tray. She gave him some napkins, which helped soak it up. Whatever the drink was, it had some sort of syrup in it because it smelled sweet.
“I don’t know what I would do without you.” Cain agreed seriously, “Your work has brought all of these cars to life.” He waved at his garage. There were four classic cars, including the one Dean was standing in front of, that Dean had worked on for Cain.
want to lose someone like that ever again.” Dean felt his eyes start to burn and his throat close. Cain held out one hand to Dean’s left arm, “Can I?”
“Must serve God and your country.” Castiel’s voice was low, “Even if you have second thoughts.”
“Yes, he’s just sick. I want to make sure everything is alright for him.” Dean said stubbornly. The elder man smiled kindly.
“We’ll see.” The doctor said, “It’s a bit out of my hands anyway. Depends on what the cops say.”
“Her BMI—”
“Cas?” Dean asked.
“She told me she took pictures to entice you. I know she can be pushy when she gets her mind to something, I can tell her to bug off if you prefer.”
. I got vegetables on it, just like you tell me to.” Sam said proudly.
He needed the knot.
I have ever met.” Colette said passionately. Dean wouldn’t look at her, but he knew she was crying, “One day, an alpha is going to treat you the way you deserve to be treated. And I hope, one day, you will believe it when they tell you that you make the
Dean felt something heat up in his chest. He couldn’t quite understand why Cain wanted to do this. Have some kid stay in his house indefinitely? That didn’t make any sense. His chest got tight, wondering when he would be abandoned again. If he had an end date, at least he could prepare for it. With this? This could mean a week, or a month. There was no way for Dean to steal himself against the inevitable rejection.
. Love for his wife. A sadness. Love for
“I have my appointment scheduled for tomorrow with a Doctor Billie?”
“Oh child, you are.”
Dean snorted, “Trust f-fund?”
“Who’re you?” Dean asked.
A deep growl ripped him from his thoughts, terrifying him. Dean pressed his back against the wall, covering his head.
“Come on. I’ve seen enough junk that I promise you—what you got won’t scar me” She winked at him, which made Dean snort. He reluctantly stood up, pushing his sweat pants and boxer briefs down in one go. He stumbled a bit as he tried to work the elastic over his foot. He knew his face was bright red out of embarrassment, trying to get into the tub faster. Colette steadied him, “I’m not going to stare at it.”
, but Dean never felt more cared for in his life. They bought him new sheets, a new quilt and a duvet. They bought him extra blankets and extra pillows, because Colette knew that sometimes your bed had to be an actual nest. They never let him think about the price tag, and were sneaky about when they caught Dean looking at something—it would magically end up in the cart.
The symptoms hadn’t gotten any worse, but they hadn’t gotten better either. The doctor told him they wouldn’t, not unless he bonded with an alpha. Alphas had let him down—so he wasn’t going to do that. It was better to be alone than to go through that ever
“I think I’m going to
“Cassie has his own garage. Colette said you work on site?” Dean frowned, his hands shaking as he gave back the phone.
“Yeah.” She whispered, tears in her eyes as she moved to sit on the bed. Dean turned over to see Sam missing. He pulled the blanket tighter to his chest.
“Go to sleep, Dean.” Cain whispered. The smell of alpha curled around him. It was like bourbon on a cold night in front of a fireplace. Dean was asleep in minutes.
. It was destroyed. His

a knot.
“Y-you're h-horrible.” Dean said.
“Hate it.” He managed to say between clenched teeth.
“This morning.” Castiel answered, “Came into my office until I gave him enough candy to go away.” Cain laughed, and it seemed Castiel had passed some sort of test as the two made their way into the house. Cain was still sure to put himself between the two of them.
. He wasn’t locked in his room. It was overwhelming. Cain kissed the top of his head, “Eggs and sausage sound good?”
“Colette says you have a safe place to stay?” Jody asked Dean, who immediately started nodding, “Ok, I believe you. But this is a place you can come if you want to have support—we have group therapy, and mostly just use each other for support.”
He dialed 9-1-1.
“May I?” He asked.
“I could take your blood.”
“It’s stupid.” Dean grumbled into his arm.
Dean vomited.
“You’ve come to the right place—come on back.” Gabriel flipped open the counter with a spin, motioning to the back. Castiel waved with his arm, so Dean followed Gabriel to the back. It smelled delicious—like caramel, sugar and pastry. Pastries were resting on racks, or covered in plastic.
“He’s now getting into shipping stuff nationally. It’s been quite the ordeal, but he is excited.” Castiel was beaming with pride.
“Cassie!” A shorter man popped up from behind the counter, “Hannah, can you cover for me?”
Dean slid down, his legs shifting in the stirrups a bit as he did. He tried not to think about how his legs were wide open, should he close them a bit more? That would probably be counterproductive.
Dean nodded, “His wife is on her way, so she will be here in about five minutes.”
“Ash.” Mullet guy introduced himself as he sat down at the counter.
“I-I’ve b-een there.” Dean perked up, “B-best p-peach p-ie I-I’ve h-had.” Dean said excitedly.
in pleasure. Dean’s breaths were coming up short as his cock dribbled pre-cum down his length. He pushed up the knot a bit more, “Oh
“Ok, so about your living arrangements.” Cain started, “Bobby brought some stuff over, but we can go back and get the rest of it this week? If that’s alright with you?” Cain asked Dean, “We can wait until the end of the week where you’re stronger, or you can just make me do all the work.” He winked.
“He doesn’t understand, baby.” She said, scooting closer, “but you are perfect, just the way you are.”
“But slick?” Dean managed to ask.
Dean let out a whimper before he could control it, “I can’t.” He answered, his throat closing up. Cindy clutched his arm, squeezing it softly.
“No—I think—I w-want to get wings.” Dean said and Gabe laughed. The omega had his arm wrapped around Dean’s back, rubbing it back and forth. The sugary smell was pleasant, sort of like pie. Ana gave him a water bottle.
“Nuva Ring has a few wonky side effects for some male omegas.” Castiel said, “In my opinion, they need to tweak the formula for them. There are a wide variety of pills as well. IUD is more invasive in the beginning, but ends up with less impacts usually overall.”
Dean laughed loudly, “That is fair enough.” Cas was staring at him, his blue eyes sparkling. The needle was nearly painless, and he quickly filled up a few vials for testing. He bandaged it up after, placing the band-aid on carefully.
“What if I wake up later and—” Dean couldn’t say it.
“Shit.” Dean pulled back rapidly, his heart pounding in his chest, “I’m sorry. I’ll go to my room I swear—please don’t get rid of me.” He felt like he might vomit. They were supposed to talk to Missouri before he had his heat. This wasn’t supposed to
When Dean woke up again, he felt disgusting. His half-ass job of cleaning definitely needed work. The knot toy was lying abandoned between the sheets; Dean half remembered when he pulled it out once it deflated. He definitely would have to increase the time. When he sat up, the heat was still curled in his body but it wasn’t arousal. He felt a little wobbly as he got up. He needed to wash his sheets and a shower. He stripped his sheets before going into the bathroom. Dean looked in the mirror, still half expecting his body to look different. The shower felt
to play, even if his heart broke every time the baseball coach asked. Dad would still get mad if he tried to decorate, so he just made the decorations easy to hide. It wasn’t as if it was ever a secret when his Dad was coming home—he was too loud arriving in the driveway. Sometimes Dad was gone a few days, but those were the best weeks in Dean’s opinion. It was easy to breathe when he wasn’t around. Sammy took to school like a fish to water. Even though Dean helped him a bunch in the beginning, it got easier as the years went on.
“We can introduce you to some of the people that live here.” Jody said, sitting up, “There’s only three of two of them here today—plus myself and Ana, so hopefully it won’t be too overwhelming.” Dean flushed, looking down at his hands.
“Don’t leave me.” Dean said before he could help it.
you fucking fag!” The blow Dean would have seen coming if he could keep his head up. He knew it wouldn’t help, but he just couldn’t help himself from exposing his throat in submission.
“IUD has some reports of effects on heats, but they are minimal compare to others. Birth control pills have varying effects on heat. Some report complete dry up of slick, other’s report too much. IUD has those reports as well, but farther between and a lesser degree. Then, of course, the usuals of weight gain, mood swings, rare blood clots—
Dean hopped onto his feet, “So I will see you Friday?” Castiel asked.
.” Cain’s voice was calm, “
If you need a warning, things start getting spicy in this chapter. Not with Cas... but you'll see :)
. He let his eyes flutter closed, knowing he wouldn’t be able to sleep but it helped him dream—dream of aloe that would soothe the burn beneath his skin. The shame of his nest. Something to expand his chest that was too tight. Every heart beat felt like it dragged on forever. The only thing that kept him going was that he had been here before and gotten out. When he looked at his phone again, it had only been a minute. He wanted to growl, he wanted to scream or cry. But he just glared at the ceiling and focused on his breathing. An eternity later, he heard the door of his bedroom open. He smelled Pam before he felt her get into bed with him, curling up under the blanket.
“Can we still game together on Tuesday?” Ash asked.
“Nearly midnight.” Colette said, “Time for bed.”
“Heard you got your own alpha.” Ash said with a smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh child, I am sorry you had to deal with that.” Dean shrugged, “And how did Karen factor in?”
to get the absorbent towels seemed too far away at the moment and impossible. He needed to burrow. His hands were still shaking as he guided the toy towards his ass. His cock already seemed to be on board, twitching all over the place.
“I do not accept those terms.” Gabriel said haughtily. He opened the door in a grand gesture, waving the two inside. Dean was not prepared for how it looked on the inside. It felt more like a hippy coffee shop than a sex shop. There were plants everywhere with natural shelves that stocked product. There were little signs next to product on how it worked, or how it should be applied. But there was also a big sign behind the check out that said in script
“I-I-I-” Dean tried to talk but the words died in his mouth. It was like his throat was closing in on itself.
get better Dean.”
“T-turns up the L-Louisanna accent w-when he’s flirting.” Pam told Dean, “but he-he’s mated. D-don’t let him f-fool ya.”
“Colette is smart, I don’t work with her much, but when I have— she is on it.”
“Colette? You’re here!” A woman with long dark hair bounced around the corner. Her scent was warm and spicy.
“You will need to go get some heat supplies, I am assuming you don’t have any?” Dean shook his head. He hadn’t really needed them—his libido had sort of disappeared.
Dean turned bright red, “Yeah.”
“Seattle.” Bobby answered.
“Would you like me to accompany you to get your blood work done today?” Cas asked, as he took Dean’s hand in his own.
“Dean.” Missouri gripped his arm, forcing him to look at her, “You are
“Yeah. My brother’s place is down the street—his is definitely worth the trip.” Cas paid the bill, even though Dean tried to stop him. Cas waved him off, saying that it was part of his down payment on the car anyway. They slid out of the booth and walked down the street, Dean was glad for a moment to stretch his legs.
Cindy frowned, putting the items in a small bag for Dean, “Sweetie, you really shouldn’t be walking around with your heat.” It was quiet, but the attitude in the room shifted. It wasn’t like it was a secret that Dean’s father never came to any parent teacher night.
“Hey Castiel.”
Dean rolled over feeling vaguely gross. He wasn’t sure why. He glanced over at his phone which read 4:00AM but no missed calls or any reason why he had woken up. He took a sharp breath, sitting up again and his head felt like it was swimming. He grabbed his water bottle by his bed and chugged it, wiping his mouth and putting it to the side.
?” His alpha pulled on him roughly, slamming him into the wall.
“Oh shit—you knew her before.” Meg said, her tone serious.
Tugging at the laptop not too far away, he flipped it open. He scrolled to YouTube, listening to Paterson’s advice. It wasn’t like there was anything better to do. And it might help him take his mind off of things.
“Dean?” Colette poked her head out the door. Her head was damp, but she was wrapped in a new sweater, “Fuck it’s cold. Breakfast is ready.” Dean nodded, following her back into the house.
The alpha smiled, taking in a breath, “Oh—Dean—are you feeling ok?” He asked, turning a bit red. It was like as soon as he asked the question, Dean felt weak at the knees. The swirling feeling in his head wasn’t elation at getting a good grade, it was like he couldn’t see outside of the fog. His body ached.
like he had a pup running around at home, “And you are?” He looked at Dean.
“If it helps, he has some really nice cars according to Ana.” Colette said, “And it’s her alpha. Ana’s been through some shit—I don’t really know the particulars. But she always has something good to say about her brother.”
“You wouldn’t be able to tell.” Castiel said skeptically.
“Yessir.” He saluted Bobby before heading off into the garage.
“Yeah. Missouri made the appointment for me. I just have to show up.”
“My family grew up around here, so my parents weren’t very accepting—shit, I didn’t really make it any easier. But there are videos online—he did one too—called It Gets Better. It’s a bunch of YouTube videos where people like you tell their story—about how it gets better.” Dean stared out the window refusing to acknowledge the burning of his eyes and his throat. He just wanted to keep from crying if it was the last thing he did. Dean pointed at the house that was his, not sure if he was glad to get out of the car or not.
“Birth control.” Dean turned bright red as he said it. Castiel squeezed his hand.
He curled up under the weighted blanket and was asleep in moments.
“It isn’t
The rest of dinner was less serious. Dean laughed and carried on conversation like he wouldn’t have been able to dream of just a few months ago. His stutter still happened every once and awhile, but he had his
. He was so shocked that he didn’t really feel the first blow. He heard Sammy start crying, and that brought him to his senses.
“I got a laptop.” Dean answered. He got it for homework. It was one they were selling at a second-hand shop that was a few years old. Dean hated it, but it wasn’t like he could afford anything else.
“Ana?”
“Dean?” Colette called out the door, “We’re thinking about going to the Roadhouse for dinner—hey Castiel, you get your car fixed up?”
“What’s in his trunk?” Colette asked.
“Jesus.” Gabriel growled.
“Hey Novaks.” A woman walked up with a devil-may-care attitude.
Dean didn’t respond as he got out of the car. He wasn’t an ‘LA’ type of guy. Billie had gone to California, which was a perfectly acceptable thing to do if it’s what you wanted. He struggled to walk the few steps from the curb to the front door, his hands shaking as he pushed open the door.
“I’ll write a report here, you will schedule it on your way out as well as your blood tests. Do you have any other questions for me?”
“Yeah.” Dean said with a smile. Sam snuggled in tighter to Dean, he hadn’t done this since he had been young, “You used to snuggle like this when you were a baby.” Dean whispered.
Castiel laughed. It was deep, gravely. Dean had made him laugh like that, he was a bit proud of himself, “No, I have a few scrubs in the back.”
“Sammy is too, right Mama?” Dean asked.
Dean shook his head, “Not been sexually active since last test.”
Dean’s jaw dropped. Cas-Cas
“Absolutely not. You’re your own person.” Justin said forcefully, “As alphas, we gotta do a better job of making sure we stand up for omegas too—and recognizing when they are being slighted. I’m not always good at that one.” He blushed, “But I’m learning.”
“Colette.” A woman with short cropped hair came up with a grin.
“L-last T-Tuesday?” Dean said again, looking to Cain.
Colette helped get all the condiments out on the table while Cain gave Dean a beer. Soon, they were all gathered around the table. It looked like Red Robbin with the tall stack of onion rings and the huge bowl of fries.
“Yuck!” He wiped it off, but Dean just rolled his eyes.
Dean was going to die. But Gabe was right.
Dean couldn’t breathe, but he spared a glance at Colette who looked like she was holding back tears, “I just know you deserve an alpha who will take care of you like you take care of everyone around you. You deserve an alpha who respects how hard you work, who helps you achieve your dreams. You deserve an alpha who wants to build you up. I know alpha’s have proven themselves a waste of time for you, but
“B-b-better.” Dean said. The bond was humming beneath Dean’s skin. He could feel—he could feel everything. He could feel Cain’s concern, his
His vision was caving in, Cain smelled panicked—he
“I might have another project? If I can show you?” Castiel asked hopefully. Dean nodded. So Castiel pulled out his phone, clicked around before moving closer to Dean, “I got a classic Ford pick-up truck. Not in great shape.” Castiel wasn’t lying. He showed pictures of parts of it rusted up a bit, other parts completely missing. The interior clearly belonged to a smoker at some point, “Ideally, I would like it to have a classic feel but have all the modern luxuries—like a sound system that connects to my iPhone. Good speakers.”
while Sammy got covered in blood, “You did!” Sammy smiled brightly, it made his split lip bleed a bit more, “We’re going to go to the hospital now, ok?” Dean tried to nod, but he couldn’t. He didn’t know why his mouth tasted like blood. Sam wrapped him in a blanket that smelled like them both. It went over his head enough so he couldn’t see the rest of the room—the blood smeared on the floor. Dean hadn’t realized the room was so loud with whining sounds were coming from him, “We’re ok Dean.” Sam nuzzled close to him, wrapping his arm around his shoulders.
The closet door opened and closed again. The sugary sweet smell was back as Gabriel sat down next to him. Dean was tense, not sure what the omega was going to say.
.” Dean whispered, it was overwhelming. His cock was already starting to twitch again, growing even though it was a bit painful. He didn’t think he had ever experienced a heat quite like this before.
Cain smiled, “I can be a good alpha.” Dean had never felt this through a bond before. He could tell Cain
“Of course. Come on in, I have a good scotch or two we can discuss it over. Or do you share your brother’s taste for tequila?”
Dean woke up a few hours later to a slightly burnt smell. Karen was growling, clutching onto Bobby’s arm. Bobby was staring at his cell phone which was held up between them.
“Yeah.” Dean murmured, blood pouring out of his mouth. Someone stepped up and Dean growled.
“N-no. I l-like the p-pictures.” Dean said with a slight smile, which made Castiel smile.
“A lot of them live in California. They say it’s a lot better than here. No one makes fun of people like me—or less people do.”
“I’m home!” Cain called out, “It smells
“Anything else?”
Dean hit the steering wheel in anger, “C-can’t m-make a-a-a- n-nest. N-n-n-no go-no good.”
Back at home, Dean covered the two beds with the sheets. He had pinned up a few pieces of art that Sammy had made in the coloring book. It wasn’t much, but it was good enough for the two of them. Dean had taken the radio from the kitchen and plugged it in their bedroom.
“What brings you here?” Cain asked.
Dean moaned quietly, two fingers pushing down further. He shot off as soon as those fingers pushed inside slick heat. His hips arched up off the bed as pleasure overwhelmed him, his hand on his cock not even pausing for a second.
Charlie’s squealed even louder this time, pushing over Cas to hug Dean. Panic surged through his system; it freaked Dean out to have her so close. He reached out to grab Cas’s arm, resisting the urge to throw Charlie off of him. Charlie let go as quickly as she attacked, sitting back down before she noticed Dean’s anxiety.
“Ah, did Cain come out and protect you?” Colette asked with a twinkle in her eye. Dean huffed, nodding. She laughed, “Doesn’t matter if you’re pack or not, Dean. Cain will always see you as his.” Dean chuckled.
to purr. He hadn’t purred in years.
He pulled his fingers out and gasped at the pain of the loss. Sticky with sweat and slick, he managed to crawl out of his nest. Everything felt horrible as he did so, he wanted to crawl back into his nest as quickly as possible. He grabbed the knot and the paper with directions. His hands were shaking as he flipped through, trying to figure out which vibrated and which inflated the knot as he crawled back into his nest. He slipped off his boxers, tossing them somewhere. There were six buttons. One that started the vibrate, one the knot. One increased and one lowered the vibration, and the other inflated and deflated the knot. It seemed pretty simple enough. He pressed the buttons a few times just to make sure they worked.
They wandered out to the dinner table where Cain and Bobby were already seated with food on the table.
“Just—here is something for the blood.” Dean didn’t really look at his face, but Sam grabbed the gauze and pressed it to Dean’s mouth. They managed to walk out the front door. The lights on multiple cop cars were on, lighting up the entire street. Neighbors were out in their front lawns, staring. Dean pulled Sammy closer.
“Technically yes—but if you’re asking me if I have any control over him the answer is no.” Cain and Colette both laughed loudly at that.
“New Alpha.” Ash pointed over to the older woman on the other side of the bar, “Ellen’s my new alpha. Just got my new bite a month ago.” It was right around Dean got his.
is a good doctor. But instincts are sometimes dumb that way—” Dean pushed back the curtain and pressed a kiss on Castiel’s lips before he could ramble on any longer.
“That’ll w-work.”
“Few years—guess it first came out in—was it 2017?”
“I never even—he couldn’t talk about it. I asked if we could visit her grave—he just walked out of the room.” Dean learned not to ask any questions about his mother, not to talk about her. Walking out of the room was the kindest of John’s responses to inquiries about his Mother.
Mr. Paterson chuckled, “I know, we’re almost there.” They huffed the last few yards into the nurse’s room, “Cindy?” Paterson called out as he eased Dean into one of the nurse’s chairs. The nurse popped up from her office in the back, “Dean is in heat.”
“What are you watching?
“I’m getting better at being more –tactful.” Castiel said proudly, “Ana is helping me. She says that being right doesn’t have to overlap with being rude.” Dean smiled.
. It means we’re there for each other. Thick and thin.” John and Sam’s pack marks had disappeared. John’s wasn’t anything deep in the first place, it hadn’t been reinstated since he was ten or so. Sam only bit him the first time.
Bobby just raised an eyebrow, “Idjit.” He declared, then kissed his mate’s forehead.
“Yeah.” Dean murmured back. She shampooed his hair while he took a washcloth and cleaned his body. He was grateful she didn’t try to do that, though she teasingly offered it. Her fingers running through his hair nearly made him
“No—she has the late shift today.” Cain said as Dean plopped the box down on the ottoman.
“Dean?” Jody’s voice called to him, but he couldn’t answer, “Talked it over with Missouri, can she come in?” Dean couldn’t respond, but he tried to nod his head.
He had been doing so
“I’ve heard so much about you.” Ana smiled. She looked to be about ten years older than Dean. If he could recognize luxury brands, he was sure that what she was wearing would make more sense. It was clear she came from money. Her dark hair was braided down her back, but a few pieces were pulled out in front. Dean nodded his response, “Colette told me not to, but I am going to show you pictures of my brother’s cars to tempt you.” She said as she pulled her phone out.
“Just so if you get a text, you know who it is.” Paterson explained, handing it back, “it
“Just about how much everyone around you cares, sugar.” Missouri said with a smile. Dean sighed, “Now, we have a few things to go over now that Dean is here.” She pulled out a folder from her purse. It had the logo of the Omega House on the front, “Same checklist we give every new alpha.”
that he was an awful omega, “N-no. I’m g-going.”
Dean hung his head, “I’m sorry.”
He was just finishing off his sandwich when Garth popped into view. Dean jumped.
“Four years ago?”
“N-never s-seen some-something so f-ancy in my l-life.” Dean said back, “thought y-ou would e-eat me n-ext.” Colette laughed, grabbing one of the wine glasses from the cabinet.
.” Dean whined.
It ended up happening on a great day. He had gotten a test back with a nearly perfect score. He did a dance when he saw the looped ninety-six on the top of his page. He was
. You’re going to be an
“John!” She called after him, but the sound of the front door slamming was her only answer. His mother was crying as she walked up to Dean, who was still holding Sammy close to him. She kneeled in front of the chair, one hand reaching out.
“S-sorry.” He whined.
“Positive.” Colette answered sleepily, curling up into Dean’s shoulder, “Might snuggle you myself.” Dean gave a weak laugh. Cain’s purr got louder, as if he was trying to lull them both asleep. Dean felt his body tension lessen, his eyes drooped closed, “Goodnight Dean. I am happy you’re here.” Colette rubbed her fingers along his pack mark before closing her eyes.
“First one.” Dean admitted. Cindy didn’t smell any better. She smelled like antiseptic and old peppermints. She pulled out a few supplies.
Dean presenting was an elephant in the room that his Alpha decided not to talk about. Dean figured it was better to continue to not bring it up. His father started coming home less and less, being away for longer stretches of time. Dean took a job at the local diner to help get some money, since his Alpha did not do a great job of making sure he and Sam had enough food or money to last while he was gone.
“I’m serious!” Colette argued with a laugh.
“We can build something custom in the back, make it easier for you to get things in and out.”
Dean couldn’t really believe his own luck. It was halfway through his junior year—just about a year and a month they could be free. They were so close to getting away from Alpha. Dean had nearly refused to call him
“Order online.” He answered behind his hands.
Dean kept grinning, “When did you turn sentimental, old man?”
“Yeah.” Dean paid for it. It wasn’t too expensive just to have wifi in their house every month. Dean knew his Dad’s social security number to set it all up.
“You’re pretty.” Sammy’s little hand patted his back.
because I
“I’m a billionaire, Dean. Why the fuck not spend it?” Cain asked. It was news to Dean that Cain was a billionaire, so he googled his net worth at the end of the day. Dean found him on the top 100 Billionaire’s list at 23.2 B. There were many articles discussing his philanthropy. How the ‘Devil had a Change of Heart’.
“Did Cain start on dinner? I’m starved.” Colette said.
“Very good.” The Doctor smiled, his teeth blindingly white, “When ARS starts to happen, the Alpha and the Omega need to re-bond. If they don’t, then the omega has to find an alpha that can better suit her—or him as the case may be.” He winked at Sam, “Now you, Dean, are a very interesting case. It should have happened years ago—perhaps. But I believe you and your bond with Sammy here kept you safe.” He patted Sammy’s leg, “Because you both have been such good brothers to each other. And you, young man, are most likely going to be an alpha. If you had been an older brother, this might not have happened at all.”
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel said, offering up his button-down covered arm, “If it is too much, just squeeze my arm and I will get us out.” Dean took his arm, holding his breath as they started to move. Castiel went towards the back wall, furthest away from the bar where there were less people. It also meant that Dean didn’t feel too surrounded. Dean stared at Castiel’s shoulder as they walked through so he didn't look at the other alphas. He could still smell them, but Cas's scent was closer. It felt like forever, but soon they were on the other side.
Christ.” Dean groaned. It felt so
“Of course you were. Cain just likes to make sure you don’t have to lift a finger other than to work on his cars.” She said with a smile, which made Dean laugh, “Come in. I hope Cain told you that we made dinner for you?” Dean nodded, “Oh good. You can use our guest room to shower. I don’t even know what fluids you have all over you.” Dean snorted, “Yeah, I walked into that one didn’t I.”
“Do you have protein bars in your room? Electrolytes?”
“I kn-knew wh-what I-I-I was do-doing.” Dean told him.
“Nu-uh” Dean rebutted.
“No! No, I can walk.” Dean stated strongly, “I only live on Maritime Street.”
“Y-you h-have a 1957 Jaguar XKSS.” Dean said, relaxing a bit. Ana hadn’t divulged the nitty gritty of her whole story to him, but most of it. He knew that Ana loved Castiel as her Alpha. They had a difficult beginning, but had worked it out.
“If you feel like staying, we’re having a chef come in to show us how to make apple pie.” Ana said, “If you can stay?” Dean nodded immediately, before looking at Colette to make sure it was alright.
“I got that one.” Castiel said back evenly.
“Yeah.” Dean nodded, already feeling a bit better.
hated it. His inner omega was in pieces; his heart felt like it was caving in his chest. He could barely breathe. But Dean could smell Sammy’s blood and he couldn’t keep himself from whining. Warm hands grabbed his own.
“Then we get both.” Gabe said, “And lube—you need lube.”
“Eat.” Sammy demanded.
“You got it!” He winked, letting go of Dean.
“Ra-a-a-ad. N-ew d-ude.” Another guy walked in with a mullet. Dean was pleased that he wasn’t the only male omega.  The doorbell chime made Dean jump.
“Time’sit.” He slurred.
Dean sighed, “I was planning on telling you first—Christ, I haven’t even told Missouri. But I—I knew it was the right place with the right people.” He was crying a bit. Cain took one of the napkins that was in the Baked box and dabbed Dean’s face, wiping up the tears. Dean didn’t think anyone had done that since he was a pup.
“I-I-C-C” Dean couldn’t get a word out, his brain felt like mush.
“Nice.” Ash said with a smile, pushing back his hair a bit, “Ju-ust m-met my po-tential new alpha, she’s pretty rad.”
be cornered into calling his alpha. He had an option out, and he would take it. Plus, he
“I thought you were more of a Talking Heads kind of guy?” A familiar line and a familiar voice called out. Dean popped his head out to see Castiel standing in the open garage bay. It suddenly clicked that this was
“I am glad you made friends with Gabe and Ana—for the desserts alone—but it’s good to have friends.”
“L-last night. T-told me b-bout his p-past.” Dean looked down at the mark on his arm, already starting to heal. There was ointment on it that someone must have put on while he was sleeping, “N-never h-ad an a-a-a-alpha bite-bite me tw-twice.”
“I’m sure you were at his age. It’s just around the corner, he will be fine.” Paterson said assuring, “And I’ll ask him if he is ok with it.”
“Dean.” Dean answered.
“You’re not the first, or the last alpha to growl at me today.” She said with a smile, “Ok, take a deep breath for me—there we go. We’re going to try again.” The gloved hand moved closer again, feeling along the pelvic bone. Dean was tense, but she moved quickly, “That was great, Dean. Now we’re going to insert the speculum in to get a look inside.”
“Yes, you are, Dean. Dad’s an asshole.”
complement him as she did, “He works on my mate’s classic cars, they are his favorite.”
“Ripping out stuff will do that to ya.” Dean said, wiping off his brow. He looked at the clock and it was nearly seven, “I’ll let you go.”
—garage. He put the tray of Gabe’s treats on the counter, most of the house lights were off when he came in.
“Hey, it’s ok. You’re with people who know what you’re dealing with.” Ana said softly, “I used to have a routine of when I woke up every morning of rubbing my arms four times—eight if it was a bad day, to hug myself. Used to only wear sweaters, even in the summer time to keep warm. My speech wasn’t as bad as yours, but I couldn’t even be in a room like this—used to make my ex furious.” Ana smiled, “It gets better though.”
Dean huffed again, “Non-negotiable, Dean. I’m excited about this one.” Colette said with a smile.
“Six.” He usually hovered at a five, so he could deal with six.
Pack. As they should be.
“Sorry, sorry.” Dean let out.
“Were we all supposed to change once we got our food?” Gabe asked as they sat down.
Dean was holding him just as tightly back. He was crying a bit too much; he was surprised he had any tears left to cry after such an emotional day already. Cain scent marked behind his ear, gripping him like he might disappear. Dean had no idea how long they remained like that, but after a while, Dean pulled himself away. Cain grabbed his arm with the pack mark.
“I like you too.” Dean said. Castiel’s hair was a bit all over the place from running his fingers through it during his rambling.
“Want any?” Dean shook his head. He had nearly stopped drinking completely. It just wasn’t worth it to become a mess again. Pam sent him a ton of articles on why alcohol specifically messes with Omega hormones in ARS. Her stories of drinking with ARS were more embarrassing than Dean’s, not that he ever said that to her.
“Having a heat is part of a normal, healthy life for an omega. I have been expecting once since you moved in.” Cain said.
The sound of his alpha’s voice immediately had an impact. He could feel some of the tension leaving his body. He was
“Oh.” Castiel was pink.
“Inspiration comes in many forms.”
And while Dean would swear that the Roadhouse did make better burgers, he was quite sure that this place did have better fries. And the burgers were pretty damn good. And all the dipping sauces were perfection.
“I wonder if they have pie.” Dean said, looking over at the counter.
“Cheeseburgers on Friday? At 7?” Castiel asked.
“Fun?”
Came the quick correction.
“Eleven.”
Dean gets used to being in his new pack.
Billie laughed, “Birth control has a lot of side effects. I know it is rather normal to accept them, but I would rather my patients know the facts.”
“Wow! That’s awesome—you any good?” She waggled her brows.
He had his pie as he walked to the Impala with Colette. It was quiet as they got into the car, Dean put the pie in the back seat and wedged it so it hopefully wouldn’t slide around.
Charlie furrowed her brow, “Are you Impala67?” Gabriel snorted.
“C-Can I g-et you anything?” Pam asked. Dean shook his head even though he couldn’t see her, “T-text me if you d-do. Okay?” Dean texted her back ‘k’ from underneath the blanket. She left him alone, but he didn’t feel any better.
“Alright if I bring your alpha back in for the end bit? You can go ahead and sit up. Just a few more questions.”
He wished he could say that things got better with his Dad over the years, but they didn’t. Dean was more than willing to get beat up if it meant having a better home for Sammy. All the teachers said Sammy was bright, so Dean made sure they practiced at home. Sometimes his teachers got mad for not doing his homework, but it was important that Sammy did his too. He tried to make sure he did his own, but he got tired.
Dean had no idea how long he read, but it felt like it was hours. It seemed that it wasn’t making Dean’s ARS any worse, but it wasn’t making it better either. The alpha eventually moved to be by his head. Dean was nervous at first even though he was protected by the blanket over his head, scared what the alpha would do—but he seemed content to just read out loud. He
(See the end of the chapter for
had just asked about sex.
“Love you.” Dean murmured into Sammy’s leg.
“Good—less gross.” Dean said with a sigh, sitting down across from them.
Dean got to the garage early the next day. Castiel wouldn’t be there for a bit, but that made it easier to set everything up. It was Sunday, so the garage was empty. Bobby had kept the garage on on-call only on Sundays. Not that Bobby was particularly religious, he just liked having a built-in day without having to deal with ‘idjits’. Dean was fine with that. Though it didn’t occur to him until he got to the garage that Castiel and Dean would be by themselves. He thought about calling Colette, but he didn’t want to make it a big deal. He trusted Castiel—probably. Hopefully.
from your
He bumped up the vibration a bit and moaned. The smell of sex only fueled him on. Each movement of the vibrator went along his prostate and sang deep in his bones. The slick sound plus vibration sounded dirty, and oh so arousing, “Shit.
They put him in a room and told him to undress completely, then to put on a paper robe that ties in the front. There was a paper blanket to put around his legs when he sat on the chair. Dean was shaking a bit as he completely stripped, putting his briefs underneath his pants like it mattered at all to the doctor if his underwear was seen when she was looking all up in his bits.
“So I started the summer of 2017.”
Sometimes people came into talk to him. He couldn’t really answer back, but he appreciated the company. Ash talked to him more about Moondoor, sat on his laptop by Dean’s feet for a while and played. Pam came back in and tried to get him to eat. It didn’t work, but he appreciated the effort.
“Nice to meet ya cher.”
“Yes. Two. At least.” Missouri said calmly. Dean scowled as he took a bite of his sandwich, but the bacon did wonders to his demeanor. He eased up slightly, “Then, you should all go shopping to help Dean decorate his room.”
“I’ll text him. Thanks Colette.”
“Where did you find all this shit boy?” His father demanded in his alpha voice. Dean tried to think of how he got it, but he
Dean stiffened, realizing all his toys were left out charging, “I think I actually might die.” He turned bright red, pulling away from Cain and covering his face. Cain was already laughing, refusing to let go. When Dean tried a bit harder, Cain just tackled him, pulling him back into the nest. He dragged the blanket over the both of them, facing Dean, “Gabriel.” Is what Dean said as his explanation.
Castiel jumped, surprised to see Dean in the corner. His eyes flashed and he gave a bit of a growl, so Dean backed up, his heart pounding with his hands up.
omega?
“Alright, well eat some of this first, then you can head on back to your home. You sure your Alpha is there?”
When Dean opened the door, he recognized the scent immediately. It was a cool scent, like pine in the winter. It was the alpha that sat with him in the Omega house. Dean eagerly got to work, happy to help the guy who sat with him for hours. The man clearly kept a clean car, the tune up not so long ago that Dean needed to worry when he got underneath. There was still a limit of all he could do at Cain’s, but he had a feeling that was going to change soon. He connected his computer into the center console, humming along to the music playing through the garage speakers.
“Nearly eight.”
“I’ll find him on my own, egg his apartment or wherever he lives on campus. Make sure he can never find any matching shoes. Dump water in his bed.” Dean snorted.
, he could have gotten away with a quick wank and be done with it. This was sharp, overwhelming heat that curled deep in his stomach. He sat back on his heals again, letting out another slow breath as he tried to feel more in control. He pushed his hair back that was damp with sweat. His right hand was positively covered in cum, his stomach as well. He really wished he brought the towels into his nest. He looked down at his angry red cock, hoping this round would satiate him enough to go to bed. In the back of his mind, he worried it wouldn’t be enough. He took another deep breath, reach down between his legs to increase the size of the knot.
And Sam.
Castiel’s grin took Dean’s breath away, “Ok. But I want a cheeseburger.”
“It is. But it will get better Dean. This part sucks, for sure. I won’t try to pretend I understand. If you want, I can have my brother reach out next week?”
“Hi Benny!” The cries came out.
“I thought I was.” Dean said blearily, "They-they made me feel crazy."
“I trust him.” Dean stated, he would
“Sure dude.”
When Dean woke up, he was alone. His nose was buried in Cas’s shirt, his entire nest smelled like Cain and himself. It was nearly perfect. It was the best nest he had ever been in, that was for sure. He reached for his phone on the bed side table, pulling it into his nest. He let out a breath of disbelief, it was nearly one in the afternoon. He hadn’t slept so many hours since he was a teenager. His heat didn’t feel as intense at the moment. When he sat up, his stomach grumbled. He slipped out of bed, feeling a bit woozier than he originally thought, but still not too bad. When he went to put on his shirt, he nearly crawled out of his skin. It was too itchy. He ripped it off, shivering a bit. He grabbed a shirt of Cain’s and pulled it on—it still didn’t feel great, but he didn’t want to walk out into the kitchen half naked.
“Do I smell coffee?” Colette asked, sitting up behind Dean, turning a bit over the back of the couch, “Hot damn, you look handsome.”
“Dean! We got food!” Sam cried out excitedly as soon as he slid the door open. There were a few bags, “He went to
“Right on.” Gabriel said with a smile, plopping down in his own chair.
“I used to be like you.” Gabriel said lowly, “Stutter really bad, flinched at nearly every alpha I saw. I broke the bond with my mother and ran away. It hurt like fuckin’ hell and I thought I was going to split apart. But that was
She cat called as he stood up, rolling his eyes as he did so. Colette looked exhausted, just coming off a twelve-hour shift. He was certain that he didn’t want to know the stains that were on her scrubs.
Dean ate his breakfast for a bit, Missouri eating an apple next to him.
“The percentage of omega’s with ARS that lose their fertility completely is less than 5%. The odds of that happening aren’t zero, but you have beaten worse odds.” Dean nodded, looking into Cas’s crystal blue eyes. He liked that Cas wasn’t
Dean huffed, “He said forever!”
All the irrational questions that plagued Dean’s mind all last night, this morning, and in the waiting room suddenly vanished, “Don’t think so.”
“This is quite a lay out—should your pick up have a plan to have this type of situation in it?” Dean asked.
“You’re a good big brother.” The man told him, sighing and rubbing his face a bit, “Alright kid, but you come to me if you need anything.” He plopped down two plates, then set on the ground next to Dean’s feet a bag of sheets.
.” The next blow Dean saw coming. He tried to back away, but his father yanked him up and shoved him to the ground. He slid back, knocking his head against the wall. It was silent for a moment, with the exception of Sammy’s cries.

in size. And you are anything but dumb Dean. Whoever told you that deserves to be smacked.”
“Asked you first.” Dean said with a snort, moving back to slip on his work boots.
“You are being a drama queen. Packs share heats—your first one back is probably not going to last as long and more than likely won’t be too horny anyway.”
But I was still so angry at them for so long.”
“What time?”
“Yeah.” Rufus had answered, sounding a bit uneasy. There was a moment where he looked like he might say something more, “I can give you a job, kid.”
He loved Missouri, but her voice sounded like it was underwater. Her scent was comforting, so he curled up close. Her finger ran through his hair, and he felt a bit like a pup. Jody came back in after a while and tried to get him to eat. He managed a spoonful before he fell back asleep. The smell of pine filled his nose from a new blanket that was added to the mix, he liked that one the best so far. The cooling scent felt like balm. It allowed him to eat a bit more, Missouri encouraged him.
“I did. I managed to rope Dean into another project.” Castiel grinned, adjusting his trench coat, “But I do have to get going. Ana is making dinner tonight, so I have to make sure she didn’t burn the house down. I’ll call you tomorrow, Dean?”
He pulled on his absorbent briefs when he got out and a shirt of Cain’s. His sheets from the day before were out of the dryer, folded neatly. He threw the gross ones into the washer, taking his new set and putting them on the bed.
. Colette answered.
.” Cain said deeply, making Dean whimper, “You are not going anywhere.” He pulled Dean into his lap on the floor, grabbing the weighted blanket and pulling it over the two of them.
“Yeah, you need to snuggle up to that
“Launched the end of 2016.” She answered.
“Older alpha brother could have challenged your father. Even if he didn’t necessarily win out, you still could have been
“This is 9-1-1, what is your emergency?” The scuffle was loud, Sammy was yelling. Dean felt like his heart was being ripped in two, “The emergency services are being dispatched. What is your address?” The woman on the line sounded concerned, “I need you to take a breath for me, you are doing the right thing for your pup.” Dean took a shaky breath, hearing he was doing the right thing soothed him in a way he didn’t quite understand, “You are protecting your pup. You can tell me where you are located.” Dean mumbled out the address, his teeth gritting so hard that he couldn’t quite spit it out, “You are doing so well honey.” The woman said calmly on the phone, “Help is on the way.” She made soothing sounds as he sat on the floor, his hands above his head.
“You sure you don’t need any help, young man?” The older man asked. Dean didn’t like being around so many smells, but he knew it was necessary for Sam. The older man ran the shelter, but he had kind brown eyes that Dean knew would treat them both well.
