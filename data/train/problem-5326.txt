"Yeah," Steve says, playing along. Of course he does, it's for Tony. Well, for the kittens too. "I'm very worried."
He says his goodbyes to the delightful Dina, who blushes even pinker when Tony lays it on thick and kisses her hand. It's adorable.
"I have nothing to do with that," Tony says, crossing his heart over his black t-shirt. It's a nice one, looking new, and fitted just right to showcase Tony's shoulders and arms. "They're decent people, deserving of funding for their good deeds."
The Sovereign are assessing them right back, that much is clear. In his previous life, Tony might have showboated about the Avengers' accomplishments, especially the win against Thanos. Heck, having the bigger stick than the other guy and only having to fire once was his motto for a long time. Now? He's trying to make Earth seem uninteresting and feeble.
"Don't worry, Morgan," Pete says with confidence as they get in position. "I'm a lot stronger than he is."
“A children’s daemon changes species at will and tries multiple permutations until their host reaches puberty. Only then do they take their ultimate form, true to their character.”
When Tony catches Steve staring, he doesn't look away. And neither does Tony as his babbling tapers off. It's the moment of truth, most likely. And being half drunk makes Steve bold enough to push it.
"They are. And it's nice to see you again, too," Steve says, pleased when it makes Tony beam at him.
Which is true: adding romance to his relationship with Pepper had been a complication, as much as Tony longed for them to work. He isn’t even shocked that she'd moved on rapidly and is happy for her since Pepper deserves the best.
It's tentative at first, but Tony angles Steve's head just right to take control and the kiss rapidly becomes more heated. After a few fleeting touches, belying his hesitation, Steve's hands settle on Tony's hips. They fit together effortlessly, trading deep and wet kisses that make Tony wish for a lot more.
"It's all right, buddy," Tony says with the little breath he has left, tapping Thor's back. The hug doesn't abate. "I'm fine. It's great to see you too."
"I guessed as much," Steve says. Work is how Tony deals with most problems. "Thanks for helping me with this. I won't insist on staying if he wants me gone."
"Ready to go?" Tony asks when he raises his head and sees Steve in the doorway. He's working on Rhodes' armor again.
"Bullshit," Steve protests with a scoff. "You know how to navigate those people with your eyes closed."
The sudden pain, added to the desire in Tony's eyes and the confidence he projects, sends a bolt of lust to Steve's core. He moans as he realizes that yes, this works. This works so much, Steve craves to do whatever Tony wants.
"Gosh, that's my line!" she says with a light laugh. "I'm so, so happy you're back. We really thought that was it, this time."
"The Supreme Intelligence has a plan for order, for all people, all planets, you know that. You can help, Anthony. Go get the light-speed drive and join us. Make a difference in the Universe, not just on this inconsequential planet."
"They're preoccupied with the balance of power between developed planets. Before our fight with Thanos, Earth was a non-entity on the universe's checkerboard, but we caught the Sovereign's attention by killing the Mad Titan, Thanos, who’s been a major player for decades."
"I hope you don't mind, but I read the report on Santa Cruz and La Paz. Looked like a pain in the ass," Tony says,
There is another daemon in the room, Tony realizes. It's even bigger than Thor's, also part big cat with wings, but with an eagle's head and talons for front paws. A massive griffin, with piercing eyes that has remained unflappable during the commotion. Tony immediately understands that it's Heimdall's.
"Platypus!" Tony exclaims, walking towards Rhodey with open arms, though he's met with lit up repulsors and an array of weapons aimed at his person instead of a return greeting.
There it is. As far as Tony can detect, Steve's offer comes from a genuine desire to help, and not only because he seeks the high of a vampire bite. He might be curious about that, too, judging by his reaction to the fangs. Tony has taken too long to reply and Steve is now beet red and trying to backtrack.
"Hey guys!" Steve exclaims. There's a row of glasses with frozen fruit smoothies on the counter, Tony pouring the last drops. "Nice! Do you need any help with that?"
For a second he worries that Steve will suggest some activity or other, since they've already watched this movie together a few months back. Perhaps he'll want to train, or go out to eat instead of re-watching The Return of the King.
"Please hurry!" Tony had said before hanging up. Steve had started running, hoping he wouldn't be too late.
Nebula glares at Carol; heck, she moves slightly between them too as if to protect him. But Tony grins at the joke: he's always loved smartasses.
Tony rolls his eyes at the dig but before he can protest Steve is kissing him, soft but insistent. Despite the numerous first kisses of Tony's life, this one is special and makes the past feel inconsequent. There's a wonderful combination of strength and delicateness in Steve that touches Tony's old battered heart and makes it sing. Steve's too good of a man to tangle with the likes of him, and way too young even though he's in his thirties, but right now Tony feels selfish. He thinks they could be great together—for a little while at least, nothing lasts. True happiness is extremely rare, enough that Tony's learned to hoard every second of it.
There is not a moment to lose, so Tony leans fully into his powers as he practiced with Carol on the trip over. He achieves binary mode in seconds, flames dancing down his arms and hands, and pushes against the wall. It rapidly heats up, becoming red and then white. Tony then presses into the softening metal with the tips of his fingers until he feels the coldness of the air inside the control room. That shit is thick, bomb proof indeed, but it's no match against the relentless intensity of focused cosmic energy. Tony pushes his hands apart, opening a hole in the surface. Fortunately he did it quickly, and by the time Zemo turns around, maybe sensing the heat, Tony has the space to fire a photon blast that knocks the gun out of his hand.
"Nothing good," Frigga says. "Another piece of advice that is so ingrained that we did not think to warn you about it, is that the link between your souls means one cannot survive the other’s demise."
"We eventually tracked him down with the stones’ energy signature. Mind you, we only succeeded because the six stones were in the same place. Their frequency showed on Carol's radar when she passed near Thanos's retirement planet."
"I'm fine, sweetheart." The endearment comes so easily, and thankfully Tony doesn't balk at it; he leans into Steve's touch even more. "I'm here."
"—Hela. Apparently Odin imprisoned her in Hel for millennia so Thor didn’t know she existed, but she escaped and wanted to control Asgard and bring Ragnarok. Thor killed her, but Asgard was destroyed."
Foolishly, he had thought Steve would announce that Bucky and him were a thing in the old days, so now that the love of his life was back, he was leaving Tony. A theory that still hasn't been disproved, but that was not the bombshell that Steve dropped.
Tony had had a real bomb blow up in his face in Afghanistan, and still this came as one of the biggest shocks of his life. He had wondered what Steve was talking about, as it made no sense. They'd gotten into an accident. Howard hit a fucking tree.
Anthony opens his eyes a crack once more; it's definitely darker and easier to blink and take in his surroundings. A lot of equipment, a screen, and he's secured on a machine hooked to computers and monitors. It takes a second to recognize the woman before him as Vers. She's not in her bastardized Kree uniform anymore, but a t-shirt and sweatpants, hair pulled back in a ponytail. She looks young and familiar in a way that she never did on the videos and background files Anthony studied. There are Skrulls with their ugly green faces behind her, and Anthony instinctively snarls.
"Thanks, it's appreciated," Rhodey says. "And please, no more flying off the handle at a moment's notice; we need an united front. I would have understood about Barnes, if you'd just told me. I know what it's like to lose your best friend and find him back after he's been tortured. How you'd do anything to protect him."
Tony has a massive headache, and he's not in the mood to focus on that and be hit by the memory of his latest kidnapping.
Which brings Tony to his next move. Steve was right to stop them from hooking up on Iantus. Regaining his memories of the last eleven years, or at least enough to have more context, means that Tony can consider getting together with Steve with the correct mindset. But when all is said and done… knowing their history changes nothing.
"Alright, you cornball. What happened to the stiff-upper-lip Captain America I knew? That's what I'm wondering."
"It can wait. I consciously choose to not know, ergo it's not your choice to hide it, whatever it is."
It feels like years, but he finally sees the Bayside Cemetery, Crescent street, the house itself, and there's even light at a window upstairs. Tony's flight is uneven and inelegant, but he manages to land on the porch's roof next to the second-floor windows. He groans in pain once immobile, every muscle aching. He wants to lie here, face down, and close his eyes to rest, but he can't or he will die. Gathering the strength he has left, he crawls until he smashes his nose against the window plane.
"Shush, I am going somewhere with this." Tony lets his arm fall down his body and forces a more relaxed pose, careful not to be too accusatory. "So, as I said, Steve told me."
It's been a while since Tony played for actual money and with an audience. He spent many nights in his dissolute past in various gambling establishments and ultimately ended up with an understanding with most of the big casinos on Earth. Tony Stark gives a show and attracts high-paying players and beautiful women who want to brush elbows with him. That the casino owners love. What they like a lot less is losing money. So they'd perfected their relationship: Tony would play a couple of rounds of poker, blackjack, or craps when he arrived because it draws a crowd, but never for too long. He'd then transition to roulette and eventually loiter by the slot machines because it's fairer to the bank that way. See, it's not that Tony tries or even
That's true. It makes no sense. Tony shudders at the idea of being light-years away from Cora. Hell, Frigga's boar isn't in the room, and Tony wonders how she can be so calm without seeing him.
The overload builds fast and the words "Not again!" ring clear before everything goes blue and the memory spittles off.
"No. No, I can't." He raises a hand to pet Lilly gently. Steve looks totally smitten, which is a good look on him.
"The Accords are tying your hands and we must act fast," Steve says. He makes a small grimace. "Plus, we need a Quinjet."
As Carol said, each one of them is gold, but so is almost everything else. The palace and its landing pad gleam in the sunlight, and the gold is also predominant in the interior decor. Unsurprisingly, the vast dining room where they end up with the high priestess and dignitaries is more of the same, from floors to furniture, plates and cutlery, et cetera. They’re even served food that fit the color scheme. Tony wonders if they shit gold too.
"Helping others find the redemption you were lucky enough to find. Makes sense to me. What I don't get is why you have to do it
There's always a level of flirty subtext with Tony, but it's rarely this overt. It could also be just friendly teasing, so Steve doesn't quite know if he should take it as interest. He'd love for it to be, as he's been nursing a crush on Tony for years.
Thor, Steve, and Tony get in position by forming the vertices of a triangle and grab Mjolnir's handle. The crackle of electricity and power is palpable as the Bifrost lights up. It sucks them into a tunnel of light and energy, pulsing with color as they travel between stars and galaxies. It's downright amazing.
"The Krees sent me on a mission to kill Vers- I mean, Carol. I was still brainwashed at the time. I almost got her, but she captured me instead."
"Sorry I'm late," he says anyway. It doesn't hurt to be polite. After all, the man saved his life during that fateful attack years ago. Anthony owes him.
His prayers are answered when Steve turns to look in his direction with a frown. Encouraged, Tony increases his efforts and cheers as Steve finally gets out of bed to investigate.
"Oh Jesus," Natasha says, before briefly covering her mouth and throwing a look at Thor, then inhaling slowly and looking back at Steve. "I'm sorry, this is a lot. I didn't expect you to go this traditional on me, Sunshine, but then again I'm also not surprised and I love it. You, Steve Rogers, are everything I ever hoped for too. I feel as if I've loved you my entire life. Your heart is my home and your arms my shelter. You are my better half and my very best friend. I take you, Steve Rogers, on this day before men and gods alike, as my beloved husband. Whatever the universe throws at us, I swear I will love you and cherish you until my very last breath. I am forever yours."
Twenty minutes is a long time, and they stay silent for it. Flying like this isn't conducive to small talk, anyway. Frankly, Tony can't stop thinking about the universes they had a glance at. He's not surprised that Steve was part of his life in many of them. And he's still insanely envious of Natasha Stark, that's for certain. In an effort to stop playing those vows and the kiss in a loop, Tony checks his emails, answers a few, and discards the others. It's not good enough. No, he needs a real distraction, physical exertion to clear his head. A good session on his wooden Wing Chun dummy should help. He's planning the rest of his day—go change, drink a Gatorade, the gym, shower, maybe a few hours on the new armor—when the compound appears into view.
He squeezes her hand and brings it up to his lips to kiss. She shakes her head, charmed, and then leaves towards the party. Maybe it was rude not to say goodbye to more people over there, but Tony's got the feeling that if their chancellor is on their side, they’re alright.
"Everything looks fine," she says after moving the device near his face for a few seconds and shining a bright light into his eyes. It makes them water, and Tony has to blink away black spots when she stops. "How are you feeling?"
"Shhh," Steve tells her when he’s halfway through with the first baby. "It won't be long, darling." Her sister is gulping down the formula fast, as she's been doing from the start. She's one ravenous kitten, that's for sure.
The express permission takes care of his vampire-specific needs and of the protection wards. Tony face plants inside, and with the momentum rolls forward and ends up on the floor. His total mortification is mitigated when Steve is immediately by his side and gently picks him up.
"Hey, little one!" Sam says when Snowball stops to sniff his hand. Callie, on the other hand, is stretching in the crook of Steve's arm, and he bops her pink nose. She's purring, which thrills Steve to no end. She remembers him and wants her cuddles.
Steve disappears in the bathroom, and Tony's pretty sure that his head barely has touched the pillow before he's out.
"The strength of the link to daemons varies by race, and sometimes with the person's powers. In some worlds, as here on Asgard, witches, or warlocks, can sustain long distances, while non magic users need to stay close. I am afraid Midgardians cannot be more than a few meters away. Maybe because you are usually fusional."
"Iron Man, there's a fight going on here," Steve interjects. They're back to back, having fallen into that position instinctively to protect each other.
"Hello, Captain Rogers," Tony's new AI answers. It's still striking to hear a feminine voice. "What can I do for you?"
This is a new chapter of their story, long overdue in his opinion, and possibly made sweeter by the obstacles they had to overcome first. This part they'll write together, though, hand in hand, and Steve already knows that he's aiming for a happily ever after.
"I don't mind if a nap makes you grumpy, baby," he says, kissing the top of Tony's ear. It's all he can reach because Tony is hiding his face in Steve's neck, as he's bound to do when in need of reassurance.
The numbers lit up on Tony's wall says it's four AM, but he can't wait for morning to see Steve. He's vibrating out of his skin, knowing that he can have him if he asks for it. Tony's head still hurts, and reminiscing has given him some emotional whiplash, but that doesn't matter one bit. He takes the time to brush his teeth, but then he's out on a mission, hurrying towards Steve's room. Tony wonders if Steve can hear the way his heart is beating against his ribs as loudly as the rapping of his knuckles on the door.
Hair rises on Tony's arms as Gandalf guides Shadowfax through Minas Tirith. It always gives him goosebumps, even if he's watched this movie at least twelve times.
Steve insisted on announcing their engagement too, which sure added to the media storm. The conservatives weren't ready for a bisexual Captain America, but Tony knows that Steve enjoys the pearl-clutching. They haven't gone on a date that didn't end up with a dozen cameras on them yet. Not that they go out much with everything they have to prepare. Plus the Accords.
It disarms Tony, the way he can’t bear to see Steve like this even if a part of him insists that Steve
"Anyway," Tony says, gesturing as if saving the universe was just a fluke, "we're sure glad it worked out. And thank you so much for your invitation; it's been an honor to meet the great Sovereign people. Everything I've seen has been more impressive than we'd even heard about."
They stop talking about young strangers flirting after that. Their focus is on the problem at hand: the six Krees at the door, or nearby, and the eight or more outside. It's second nature to fight in sync with Steve, and they’re kicking ass. They don't even have to talk—just a nod or a glance, and they read the other's intentions. It makes for fluid fighting. Tony’s also having a blast pushing the nanite armor to do new fun and dangerous things. Anything he thinks up, it can do, or close enough anyway.
Pleasure is coiling like a spring in his gut, and it's good. So good. He reaches to press on Steve's perineum with his free fingers, to stimulate his prostate from the outside, but Steve swiftly captures Tony's hand to bring it up near his head too. Yep, manhandling is definitely working for Tony and he doesn't want to fight it even though he longs for a fist around his cock. Right now all the friction he gets is against Steve's washboard abs, which is fantastic but not enough.
"Quite a trip, huh?" Tony asks. "And not just the rainbow bridge, if you catch my drift." He's still working on accepting this daemon thing.
If her report is correct, this place has no government to speak of. It’s mostly composed of the workforce extracting material from the remains of the Celestial, which is illegal, and the society that built up around that industry. Which, Tony read, leans heavily towards excess in the form of many opportunities for intoxication and gambling and a blooming sex work industry.
"He did, a few days ago in fact." Tony's heart flips at that, but Rhodey doesn't expand on the subject. "That's for my own story, later. So you fought with Steve, but how does that lead you to drop everything to go to Asgard?"
Tony's never seen Steve like this, speaking fast and halted, almost babbling. It's painful, and Tony takes a deep breath to slow his racing heart. He tries to sound calm and collected.
"In the flesh. Here," Steve says, extending a paper bag with bacon cheeseburgers and fries to Tony, who takes it without a fuss. That he's learned to trust Steve enough to take things directly from his hand is still a thrill, a year in.
Tony works hard in his smithy, and it's clearly reflected in his toned arms and muscled back and shoulders.
"Sure," Tony says, casual as anything while Steve is on the verge of a heart attack. Tony, who was rubbing his nose on the baby's cheek, then stills and looks up at Steve with widened eyes. "Wait a second; take me out? As in a date?"
Unfortunately, Anthony's ego proves to be his downfall. Vers is not dead at all. She’s back on her feet and hands charged. As soon as Anthony flies over the crest of the crater, he's met with a powerful photon blast to the head, then another. As he falls to the ground, rolling in the dirt, he sees several Skrull soldiers flank Vers with their weapons trained on him.
He's been walking for less than five minutes when he freezes. Something moved on his left, he's certain of it. Whatever it is, it's big, and Tony's heart is now hammering in his chest as he un-holsters his gun. The moon is bright, but the forest is still mostly shadows, and even if Tony strains his eyes, he can't see anything. Maybe it's nothing. It might have been a deer, as startled as he was and now long gone. Tony waits a moment more and starts moving again, listening with attention. That's when he realizes something that has been nagging at him since he entered the forest: it's way too quiet. There should be a background buzzing of insects and crickets, the shrill call of frogs, maybe an owl hooting. But there's only the sound of his own steps and, further, the echoes of the soldiers' campsite.
"What?" Steve appears at his back, looking over Tony's shoulder. He also circles Tony's waist, who leans back into Steve’s chest.
In his late teens, Tony thought about becoming an astronaut. In the end, he didn't apply because Howard insisted he work at the company, but he wonders how his life would have turned out. Obie would have had free rein over Stark Industries, with no need to take him out. Surely, Tony would never have become Iron Man. Even though he's dreamed about going to space, now that he’s here Tony feels a deep malaise over how boundless it is. He doesn't flash back to the wormhole in New York all that much: there were tons of ships then, and it wasn't this empty. But the vastness outside the cockpit window almost gives him vertigo, and a strong impression of déjà vu, nonetheless. Unsettled, Tony rubs at his chest and has another brief moment of surprise at not feeling the arc reactor there. He keeps forgetting he got rid of it.
"Really," Steve defends himself, bristling. "They still need to be fed around the clock. I think Tony deserves a break after looking after them alone for two weeks."
he's called Carol Warbird before. Even remembers her pleased little smirk the first time he used it. "Looks as if stuff is now slowly coming back to me."
"You want to see the babies again?" he asks. DUM-E chirps with enthusiasm. "Fine. Easy does it, like last time."
Steve shivers, because that's not something he's used to. Sex's always been fast and secret while barely undressed, which was exciting in its own right. But Tony seeing all of him, and even better enjoying all of Tony, will be a luxury. While Tony takes care of the lamp, Steve gets rid of his clothes, including the undergarments. The hungry gaze he gets when Tony turns around and finds him naked makes Steve's stomach somersault. The slow up and down lingers on Steve's hard cock for several seconds, Tony even wetting his lip.
Steve giggles and blushes, which is so adorable that Tony can't resist one more second. He grabs Steve's upper arm to halt him, then steps close, chest to chest, only to raise his other hand to cup Steve's cheek. He can feel the werewolf's pulse racing under his pinkie finger.
"Yeah?" he asks again, but a smile is blossoming on his face now, wide and happy. It makes Tony's stomach do somersaults.
"I'm conducting a study on the variables that influenced the Superhero Registration program. The Civil War event, as it's called in many universes," Richard says.
"FRIDAY, wake me at twenty to seven," Steve says. "But Tony, go to bed right after the five o'clock feeding, don't wait for me."
The sun is up now, and Tony hears movement in the kitchen. The girls are up. They're expected for breakfast with the Iantusians, so Tony will have to deal with his emotions later. For the moment, he’ll stuff everything into a neat little mental box and do what has to be done.
"They've gotten big! Well, bigger," Rhodey says, scooping Snowball up. "How are you doing, Drama Llama?" On cue, she meows in return, making everyone laugh.
Steve is just out of the room when he hears the conversation between Sam and Jim pick up. They don't realize he can hear them from that far away and through a door.
Tony rolls his eyes because how can Other-Steve not notice that his double is practically falling apart?
Steve comes back, looking annoyed, and stares at him again. Tony continues hitting the glass with his wings. Eventually, Steve unlocks and pulls up the window.
Steve's begging and pleading, humping up and Tony magnanimously slides forward to grind his sadly clothed ass against Steve's hard cock. He wants him so much, and can't wait for them to do this naked, fusional in every way. It's going to be fantastic if a simple feeding feels so good. The new stimulation makes Steve go frantic and irregular in his thrusts, bucking under Tony, until he shouts and comes in his pajama pants. It's difficult for Tony to pace himself, he's already addicted to the richness of Steve's blood. But even though the wizard has a robust constitution, Tony has to be careful not to exaggerate. With reluctance, he withdraws his fangs from Steve's neck and firmly presses his tongue against the punctures to close the wounds and stop the flow.
"You're going to be a handful, are you?" Tony murmurs, cupping Steve's cheek, but then grabbing his chin firmly. A reminder he's in charge here. Steve wasn't expecting it, and it's a thrill. "It's not a problem," Tony adds. "I like a challenge."
The fake story isn't that interesting, but he's still got the Sovereign in earshot drinking in every word.
"I'd like to try a game," Tony says, sliding into her place before anyone else makes a move for the seat. "If you welcome newbies."
At last, Steve puts his hands on Tony's strong thighs and mouth at his shaft, then twirls his tongue around the head, gathering precome. He's been taking mental notes about what Tony prefers, so he pokes in the slit with the tip of his tongue for a few heartbeats. When he takes Tony's cock in his mouth, Steve sucks hard and slides down as much as he can on a first pass.
Tony looks their way and immediately scowls, and that's when Steve sees that Snowball is in the pool. His own reaction is immediate protectiveness and anger too. How dare they put her in the water?
There was no mistaking it; the brazen little hussy was showing off. Not that Tony blamed her; he'd love to capture Steve's attention like that. And it was almost as if he could feel Steve's gentle fingers on his own skin as he caressed Cora's primary feathers, and it felt wonderful.
"Ah man, is this about Captain America again?" He sounds exasperated. Which… is fair to a certain degree. Tony's been obsessing for months.
"Thank you. Rhodey told me you don't agree with the Accords, but we'll have a serious conversation about them, at the very least."
And he won't fail. Not when he finally has a chance to face Vers and make her pay, not to mention please the Supreme Intelligence at the same time.
They'd been together after that, in an undefined way that somehow worked. They kept hanging out as usual, but now they also kissed and had sex. Hot, mind blowing sex, but where they never spent the night with each other. Steve had left Tony's bedroom after the first time they'd made it to a bed, with a kiss on the cheek and a thank you for the good time. It had been a disappointment, but pretty clear. Tony had only followed his lead from then on.
The room is beautiful, with a fifteen feet high ceiling, impressive gilded windows with what promises to be an amazing view… and only one bed. It’s huge, for sure; it looks bigger than an Alaskan King. Tony supposes another door he sees in the back leads to a separate bedroom.
What they can see differs completely from their current setting. Tony wonders if it's just a distinct location in the same universe, or if what he thought was an identification number for the proposed reality is not that at all. Or maybe it's the same reality, but at a different time, which Tony doesn't even want to think about because it would make finding their home at the correct time very daunting.
"Holy shit, oh my God," Tony says, throat tight as he fights with his white shirt. The damn garment isn’t a traditional hospital gown; it has snaps in the front that Tony opens until he can see his chest. The arc reactor
"Sam, Bucky, come back immediately." He also lets his shield fall to the ground, where it lands with a sharp metallic sound. "Stand down."
Tony whips his head around and there is naked relief on his face when he sees Steve. He's strikingly beautiful, as always, which Steve chides himself for noticing (it's so not the time for his crush to manifest itself).
What happened in eleven years for Steve to look at him like that? Sure, they got under each other's skin from day one; it was obvious to them and the world at large. There was animosity at first, then a subdued rivalry in the months Tony remembers, but there was a spark of
"No, lies are everything that Yon-Rogg and the rest of them told you since they took you. Let me guess, you don't remember a single thing from before a supposed accident. The Skrulls killed your family-"
The voices are distracting Tony from the visions. He's not only lived through them, a while ago, he's also seen fragments of them through flashes in his nightmares in the last few years. With more, always more, including diverting a nuclear warhead through a wormhole and an alien army waiting in space to annihilate them all.
"Yeah, I know, I don't want to leave them either," Tony says, when Steve doesn't immediately agree to go to bed. "But what's the use of having two people to care for them if we both stay up? It's past 1 AM, and I'm used to working until sunrise. You can come back for the 7 AM feeding and I'll catch some shut-eye then."
"They are so adorable," Wanda says, sitting by Steve's side. "I understand better why you go to the Tower so much."
"My pleasure," he answers with a grin. He'll have a weird story to tell his friends, about superheroes dumpster diving to save animals. "I hope they make it."
Tony chuckles, gulps down his whiskey in three swallows, then gestures at the bartender to give him more. "Could be."
Steve smiles, cupping the side of Tony's face with care. "Where I finally got to kiss you, I recall."
"Alright, give me the CliffsNotes version. What was that about saving the universe? They came back, didn't they?"
DUM-E goes back to helping Tony, and Steve keeps his phone propped against a pillow, watching them work. The sounds from the workshop and the incubator are soothing, and Steve feels his eyes getting heavier at last.
Tony feels the need to chime in. “Pardon me for saying this. I mean no disrespect, but for some people I can see the link with the animal form of their daemons more than for others.”
"You bet. I won't let 'em do anything to the babies," Steve says, rocking Callie in demonstration. Tony smiles and does a finger gun, then leaves on Rhodes' heels to get a bathing suit.
The word 'avenge' makes the hair on the back of Anthony's neck rise. He guesses he's been waiting two years to do just that.
"You can talk it out when we're back where we're supposed to be," Sue says. She takes her husband's hand and grabs her brother's sleeve, who is holding up Electro with Grimm. "Everyone grab your neighbor, we're going through."
Tony sighs, leaning back in his chair and stretching his arms over his head, then forward. He often makes Steve think of a big cat. He can be so graceful.
With a hard suck Steve pulls off, and even though he asked for it, Tony almost protests at losing the hot, wet heat around his dick.
The guests immediately begin filling the chairs, which unfortunately means that several people pass through Steve and him on the way. It's just as disturbing as when Cowboy-Steve did it earlier.
Steve flinches at his last name; it's the first time Tony hasn’t called him Steve since he woke up in the hospital on Banturia. Well, at least this explains why Carol said that was the way Tony addressed him.
Tony would prefer getting his bearings before that conversation. "Not right now, but I'll call her soon, I promise. What about—"
It's great to see them getting along so well; Tony must be delighted about it too. Steve knows that Tony thinks of Peter as nearly a son, and right now they absolutely could pass as siblings or cousins.
He whines when Tony pushes him back a few inches, intentionally catching Steve's eyes to gauge his reaction.
Steve's eyes had been wide with fear, somehow. Tony didn't understand why, and it was so frustrating.
Tal has redirected Kol away from Tony and then Nebula, and even if he's not a skilled fighter, he can hold his own. It wouldn't surprise Tony that this is a great excuse for the people present to act on old grudges because a lot of patrons are enthusiastically targeting each other. A brawl like this, on the other hand, is an exercise in restraint for the Avengers, because they don't want to seriously injure or kill anyone accidentally. It's almost fun, until a sudden blast to Tony's right makes the Navive table explode into tiny pieces and has everyone startled. By reflex, Tony asks for the helmet and the HUD.
He's clearly on an adrenaline high, eyes sparkling and with a smile that won't quit. He's so handsome that it takes Steve's breath away even more than usual.
He doesn't know if he's in the mood for schmoozing, but eight-thirty is ten hours away. He has time to think about it.
"I don't know, that magenta nurse was lovely," Tony says, reminiscing. In his active playboy days, he would have tried to seduce her for the thrill and novelty alone. Maybe slightly crass, but it didn't hurt anyone if the attraction was mutual. But a possibility suddenly occurs to him and halts his musings, and he feels like a complete tool. "Um. Did I leave a girl back on Earth?" He thinks of Pepper, but the last time she called them off, it felt irreconcilable.
The Krees had to be expecting the Avengers to be present. But it's Avengers and friends today, and it's beautiful to see.
Tony could feel the store's magic from a coffee shop situated one block away, and it's the closest he'd gone to it. Steve's boutique is powerfully warded, and he wouldn't have been able to enter without permission, anyway. Tony soon began spending time at the coffee shop, curious if he'd spot the new wizard or any magic user drawn to the proximity of good supply. The day Steve walked in for a tall Americano, his power was so evident it was as if it covered him in glitter. Since Steve and Natasha became friends, Steve has toned it down a lot. She must have convinced him it is safer; some hunters don't discriminate between white and dark magic.
"True, I'm tired. But I'm still strong enough to take on Victor with a few friends, and I need an experienced crew on this." He sees that Steve is about to protest—of course—and adds. "I'm not against you getting involved in the future once you've trained with us. But not today."
“Surely this has been a lot to take in,” Frigga says. “Thor, would you show them their quarters, so they can rest before dinner?”
Let's just say his fiancé has a gift for hyperbole. It was Tony's cue, who flew over and made a showy Iron Man landing between War Machine Captain America.
"Have I told you how much I love you today?" Steve asks once they slip under the sheets and tangle together.
He'd like very much to go back to fooling around and hopefully getting off soon. On Hala, he almost hooked up with a few people, but never went through with it. He wonders if it was his subconscious balking at the idea that it wasn't Steve. Tony doesn't think he wants to know if Steve slept with anyone else—which he wouldn't blame him for, after all he thought Tony dead—but somehow he thinks not.
"I suppose you need to get your armor for patrols?" Steve asks. "I saw it yesterday, from afar. So cool."
Maybe Steve's a bit of a thrill-seeker, after all, but that's fine. Tony loves people who know what they want, especially if it's something he can give them.
"Yeah. Also, don't freak out if I bleed green, it's the new normal." Tony places a kiss under Steve's jaw and rejoices when he feels Steve have a full body shudder in reaction. Yeah, he's still got it, and remembers just how to make Steve's body sing.
Grinding his hips against Tony, making his eyes roll back in pleasure, is a good way to answer in Steve's opinion. "Do I look unsure?"
He's reversing their positions so that Steve's leaning against the counter now. With his index finger, Tony scoops up some of the come on Steve's face and feeds it to him. He's avoiding touching anywhere else, though, and it's a torture of its own.
He's interrupted when a tall man with sunglasses, a puff coat with the collar popped up, and a beanie opens the door. He strolls in as if he owns the place, and Tony immediately recognizes Fury by the way he holds himself.
Gosh, it takes a second, but it comes to him. "Pretty great. The Air Force has recently promoted him to colonel. He pilots the War Machine armor I made for him."
"You guys did an outstanding job down here too," Tony says. "Any pressing problems to take care of?"
That distracts Tony for a second. Steve is jealous? He can't help but feel a thrill over that and lets his lips curl up.
They move to the sofas and Tony unashamedly snuggles into Rhodey as Carol takes a seat in front of him.
"Okay, so I think there's nothing more to do but to press some buttons and hope for the best," Tony says, examining the remote.
Tony should call Rhodey, have him round up a posse to go kick Victor's ass and say he'll meet them later. It would mean stop touching Steve, though, which he can't find the will to do as they slowly make their way to the second floor. They keep stopping to kiss, getting lost in each other before one of them makes them move again, only to get sidetracked again a moment later. Steve's kisses are addictive, his magic the equivalent of champagne bubbles against Tony's tongue.
"Krylorian? Like Bereet, Rhomann's wife?" Steve says slowly, as if surprised that Tony doesn't get it. "We met them on Xandar."
"I don't feel so good." Tony is desperately scanning the sky, hoping to spot his daemon. But the night is dark and he can't see Cora at all, which makes his anxiety spiral. He's not imagining this; he's hurting more and more with every second he doesn't see her. "Cora?"
Rhodey huffs in amusement. "He's hella smart and needed a suit. I just gave him the means to make himself a good one."
But moving through space on the Rainbow Bridge while following a mythical hammer? That is putting his—and Steve's—safety in the hands of 'magic', and Tony is not a fan.
Tony rolls to his belly and cries out in relief. "Yes, it's me! Thank goodness!" Not that Steve can understand him, but he hopes the reaction is the answer Steve needs. It seems to do the trick.
"True, but he's clearly been through a lot." It seems as if a stiff breeze would make Other-Steve fall over.
"They won't. And they need the Quinjet, anyway. If they dare try to steal it from me, they're in for a surprise."
On the dance floor, Carol has persuaded several Iantusians and Steve into a basic line dance. Steve is surprisingly inept at first, but he soon catches on and then follows Carol with ease. They’re having fun, being silly and playfully elbowing each other. If Tony hadn't caught Steve looking at him earlier, he'd wonder if they were an item again. And then Tony remembers how it's supposedly Rhodey who has a thing going with Carol... The sudden need to see Jim and lean on him as Nebula is currently doing with him is overwhelming. God, he misses his Rhodey.
"Same," Tony says. "When we're done with those stupid super soldiers, and hopefully the Krees, we're taking a week off, just for us."
"It's a shame. She's magnificent." Tony reaches to pet Hildr's enormous head, but the lioness recoils before he makes contact, eyes panicked.
"I know, I know," Tony says. "Speaking of cheating, you're not supposed to use your super strength, Pete!"
"I flew for hours. In fact, I realized I was over Nevada before turning back because I didn't want to face Pepper in California at the time. She would have had one look at me and made me talk about it."
Tony blinks. "Really?" Before Steve feels self-conscious, Tony drags him down in a heated kiss. "Oh, Sheriff, it will be my pleasure to rock your world," he purrs when they separate and it makes Steve's body hair stand on end.
"Yes. It was ideal: a fantastic project, millions of miles between me and Steve, and no temptation to do something rash like go after Barnes. I figured it would let me cool down."
"I'm certain many people are armed all the same," Nebula says as Big Purple passes a detector up and down her body. He gestures at her to go through and starts on Steve next. Tony's been focusing on Nama, but the purple bouncer is so tall and large, Steve almost looks like a child in comparison.
It's hard not to focus on Tony's smile and grin like an idiot in return, but Steve thinks he manages. Peter once again easily climbs up the hill with Morgan and their tube. As they approach, it's crazy to see how much Tony's girl has grown in the seven months since they left the hospital for the cabin. She's as cute as ever though; the spitting image of her father, with huge liquid brown eyes (which Steve is unsurprisingly partial to).
Even more than the armor, the thought of his best friend works wonders to calm Tony's racing heart. Rhodey has always been there for him, including finding him the desert post escape; he'd felt safe for the first time in months in his friend's embrace. Sure, they don't always agree, and once fought each other in weaponized suits on "Another One Bites The Dust" by Queen. But Rhodey is his rock, has been for a long time.
He's home (Steve. Steve is home), and he's safe. It's the best thing in the world to tip his head up and meet Steve for a kiss, affirming and sure.
"It's important that you all follow the plan." Yon-Rogg looks at everyone in the team, but his gaze stops on Anthony purposefully.
He's about to take off for the entrance to his lab, where he stores the armor, when Steve grabs the suit's wrist.
Victor tried to zap him out of the sky, but Tony got away. And then flew for hours towards the closest magic user he hoped would help; it happened to be the cute wizard that caught his heart over the last six months. A splendid choice, because Steve is now gathering what he'll need for the counterspell.
Vers makes a face that is mostly a guilty wince. "Can't do that right now. But I will, once I explain."
Tony looks to the side where both Steve and Barnes are staring right at him; clearly they've been eavesdropping. He raises his eyebrows in a question,
"I'm sorry we're keeping you from your regular patients," Steve says. They did barge in and commandeer this man's time.
"I'll take it as a compliment. It was a pleasure talking to you," he says honestly. And not just because she appreciated his kid; there’s deep kindness in her and he can feel it.
"I think I need to process this first," Tony says, raising the phone to show a picture of Pepper, Morgan, and him. God. They had a baby together. He still can't wrap his head around that.
A tall, blond man, in light armor and a red cape, throws his arm around Anthony's shoulder with a wide grin. "I have no doubt my friend!"
"Call Pepper. She can put SI's legal team on it and spin the situation. Carol, if there's any sign of the Krees, I want to know."
Steve is bad at Half State… because that's pretty much what a centaur is, by nature. He can't totally change into a horse the way Rhodes does, for example. For Steve, it's either human or centaur, and he's fine with that. As a centaur, he has the advantage of competing in Full Shift all the time, so at complete strength, which makes him a star left-fielder in SHIELD's Shifter baseball team. The rest of his teammates mostly play in Half Shift, unless they can use their Full Shift to their advantage.
It's not entirely true. At the time, Steve got along with Howard fine, but he wouldn't say they were very close friends either. He sure values Tony as a person a lot more.
And that's another thing. Steve is furious that Howard used him, and the whole Captain America schtick, to bring down a young Tony. He hates it more than pretty much anything else in the world.
The doctor, regular-toned this time, tells Tony that it's uncertain that he'll get all of his memories back. Even advanced alien races find the consequences of traumatic brain injury strange and unpredictable. They treated the neuron and mild axonal damage, plus the bruising of his brain, and mitigated possible secondary symptoms such as headaches, nausea, fatigue, concentration issues, irritability, depression, and the like. But everything about how Tony's brain manages the information, old and new, is out of their hands. The doctor advises him not to force himself to remember as it's too early. Tony's brain needs rest, and the best strategy is to let memories come back to him a bit at a time. Getting told stories and looking at images is alright, but he has to stop if his head hurts. Tony's sure that the hole in his memories is going to drive him crazy, to be honest.
For a second Tony worries Steve will come over to ask what's wrong which wouldn't be good. He isn't ready for what could be a game changer. Tony is just starting to enjoy a simple life, and feelings are complicated. He turns back to tip the barman and grabs his glass and the Cosmo he ordered for Cherie.
"Okay then," Tony says when they separate. He slides a hand up to cup Steve's cheek, and is endeared when he turns into it to kiss Tony's wrist. "Maybe I'm less jealous of myself now."
"They were here for you, ready with those darts." Tony doesn't even voice it as a question; it's fact.
"That's an excellent idea, whoever you are, thanks." Bucky then hurries to lock himself in the front of the plane.
tired, but wired all the same; it's been a surreal day. He hoped that bringing Tony lunch would give him a few moments of his time, and unexpectedly, it turned in twelve hours with the man, and more to come. It's like a contact high, which makes Steve snort at himself. He's so gone, it's almost sad.
Around them the lights come on, and the yellow glow in the capsules shows that they indeed hold five bodies. The unexpected thing is that they each have a bullet in the head.
"Daemons interact with other daemons as their persons would do. They sometimes touch each other, and are playful if friends, but will sneer and fight if they are enemies. But people touching each other's daemon is completely different. It is repulsive if your daemon touches a stranger, or even a friend. But it is quite intimate with partners or lovers." Thor inclines his head towards Lilly, who while listening hasn't moved an inch, still firmly on both Steve and Tony.
"Doesn't know shit," she interrupts, rolling her eyes. "With him it was always 'let go of your past', 'control your emotions', 'anger only serves the enemy' and assorted 'beat me as yourself' crap."
They stay silent for a minute and Tony's chest is constricting just thinking of it. God, not Natasha. They'd come a long way since she infiltrated Stark Industries, and he thought of her as the sister he never had. Steve looks shaken too.
Those two have been heavily flirting—maybe more—and Tony is a bit torn about it. They'd make a fantastic couple, and seem to get along great, that's not in question. But with Carol's work that is mainly in other galaxies, it would be quite the long distance relationship, which wouldn't be easy. Then again, it's their problem; who is Tony to judge?
Dina smiles reassuringly. "I believe you. We'll do more tests," she promises before leaving the room.
"You were going in the wrong direction," Steve says. "I wanted to circle around and nudge you towards the village when I realized there was a Hydra camp."
Steve steps in to pull Tony into his arms and they hug for a long minute. Tony relishes how solid Steve is, how tall, strong, and protective. It's done now. The Krees tried to take him again but failed, because Tony had his team, his friends, at his back. For the first time since he returned to Earth four weeks ago, Tony allows himself to relax.
"You're very intimidating," Steve murmurs as he leans down, but halts and smiles widely, eyes dancing with mirth. "When not a small ball of fluff, that is. I think it helped."
"Or maybe a shelter?" Steve adds as he throws the last of the garbage back in the bin. The ASPCA is further up the Upper East Side, but there must be something closer.
"Oh, I forgot about the peanut gallery for a second there." Tony pauses. "Comments? Remarks? Plans to go hide the bathroom for a while?"
And that's the beauty of it, isn't it? They're safe here in Steve's bedroom, with no need to worry if they'll get caught. He won't, at least not today, but Steve could keep Tony on the edge all night.
Tony finds it easier to take hold of Electro too and instinctively extends his other hand to Steve, who grasps it tightly. They're soon on the other side, and it might only be wishful thinking, but Tony feels as if Steve holds on longer than necessary, then squeezes before letting go. It thrills Tony to see that they aren't shimmery anymore. It's the correct reality then, which is excellent.
"Steve. Steve?" The trapped Steve frowns and blinks his eyes open, making WIM-Tony exclaim, "Holy shit, you're alive!"
When Tony left, Steve tried to be as supportive of his choice as possible. He understood that Tony was tired, overworked and overstressed, especially with the guilt that came with Ultron's havoc. Steve hadn’t helped at all with his quick judgment and constant accusations at the time. But when everything’s said and done, all that Steve wants is for Tony to be happy. If Tony believes that he needs a break from the superhero life, so be it.
It seems they're witnessing a battle between a robot and… kids? A boy with an orange hoodie and sunglasses shocks the robot with live wires, but unfortunately a girl next to him in a red and white costume gets zapped too. Suddenly, a big green bean-like… toy? Is that a plushie that flies? Whatever it is, it resembles the Hulk, with a smaller bean in a Captain America suit riding on his back, and they plow down the robot away from the kids. Oh dear. There are several flying beans in various costumes, including a Loki. They don't seem to be toys, after all, but very much alive.
She leaves with a wave, taking small, fast steps towards the Capitol. Caly inclines her head slightly.
"Oh for sure. You're both terrifying and lovably fluffy. But I wasn't talking about the wolf." Steve looks up in surprise and their eyes hold for a long charged moment. "Just saying it as I see it," Tony adds with a wink.
"Language!" Steve cries out, putting his gloves near his mouth to channel the sound. It makes Tony laugh heartily, which he is extremely proud of.
"Oh, wow," Tal breathes out as Tony rearranges the tiles in order, and a murmur runs around the table. Nebula grabs Tony's forearm and squeezes, and he looks up to see that she has a proud look in her eyes.
Tony kisses him, soft and loving, hoping that his regard is clear. Steve delightfully yields into it, giving back in kind.
"Clearly you'll be an awesome dad, Tony. But maybe just not right now." They're still at the Academy, and way too young to care for kids, in Steve's opinion.
Tony lets his eyebrows rise; not to toot his own horn, but that's pretty impressive. Fucking time travel. "Well, would you look at that?"
It should be frustrating, but it only ratchets Steve's excitement; Tony knows what he's doing. It's amazing that he's always so sure of himself in giving pleasure, and insecure when it comes to feelings and emotions. It's fine though, Steve is thoroughly enjoying the former and will help Tony with the latter, as much as he can.
"I want to see you, too. Please." Steve reaches for the buttons of Tony's shirt again, and together they make fast work of taking off his clothes.
She nods and after lightly tapping Steve's arm, to comfort him too, Tony retreats to his quarters to find the privacy he so badly needs right now.
There's a numeric keyboard, two arrows pointing away from each other (towards the right and the left of the device), and, at the top, a small display that currently discloses '15920'. Having no idea what the numbers mean, and what he'd need to type to go back home, Tony pushes the arrow aiming towards the left. Hopefully it's to backtrack to the previous universe the remote has been into.
"She does," Steve agrees with a wink at Tony, while kissing Callie's head. A Tony who looks extremely pleased with himself, it has to be said. He's rolling back on his heels with a smirk, knowing the punchline is about to come.
He sure hopes not, because that would practically be a death sentence. Or, if they live forever like this, a likelihood of never going home while haunting a reality not their own.
Anthony would tolerate the interminable training sessions if he could spend the rest of his time working on the Kree fleet's drives and engines. He loves it even more than the little fighting he's been allowed to do, but Anthony can't focus on that either.
"Yeah. Mostly," Steve confirms, while not looking that thrilled about it. It's surprising to Tony; with how close they've become, Tony imagined he'd be more… creative. "But you haven't called me Capsicle in years, no."
Steve is certain that Jim has detected his crush on Tony, and has known for a while. That he shares the photograph like this feels like a blessing of some sort, and it makes Steve inordinately happy. And Rhodes isn't a cruel man, far from it. He wouldn't encourage Steve's infatuation if he thought there was no chance of an eventual reciprocity, right?
That doesn’t calm down Kol the slightest bit. In fact, he takes a step forward until he's almost bumping into Tony.
There's way too much text blacked out for a soldier simply writing to his friend. Tony is certain that it has to do with Captain America and a secret mission.
"Privacy settings scrambled parts of the footage of the cargo bay by default, unless otherwise instructed."
Meanwhile, the vet is on the phone with someone he knows, talking about the future care of the kittens.
It's simple: Tony needs to get in, and he wants Steve to turn him back to his human—or rather vampire—form. But Tony cannot enter Steve's home because he was never invited explicitly, and how can Steve fix him if he doesn't know Tony's in trouble in the first place? It's so, so frustrating, and Tony starts hitting his head against the window frame.
"No. I still have nightmares about Afghanistan, but this was nothing. Well, the blast on Asgard was bad, but that's it. Pretty sure the whole shit show was worse for you guys."
Steve, who's been fighting next to them and laying out people cold left and right, reacts to that. "Fuck off,” he says with feeling, scowling at Tal.
"There's no rush," he reasons as she sucks determinedly. Steve's more confident now, but during the first few feedings, he was terrified that she'd take too much and choke.
"That's because you’re a good man, Steve, all lapses in judgment aside," Tony says, squeezing Steve's wrist. He believes that with all of his heart.
When Anthony focuses, the blond man in a cape reappears on the screen, making Carol nod. But that's not who Anthony was talking about.
When the clock shows one-thirty and sleep still eludes him, Steve gives in and opens his new kitten app. There are the babies, sleeping soundly, and being their awfully cute selves. It's probably only because of his enhanced hearing, but Steve can hear the drum of the fake heartbeat, the swish of the water circulating, and sounds from the workshop.
"Of course." The armor is a part of him, and all the Avengers know how he feels about people taking his stuff without consent. Which brings another question to mind. He points at the reactor now in Steve's big hand. "It responds to you too, right?"
"Fine. I'll feed them this time, but set the timer and Sandra will have to do it next, if they aren't gone by then."
Tony got over this anger and feeling of betrayal once; he can do it again. The circumstances are different too, as Steve was honest when Tony asked instead of hiding a devastating secret for years. But honestly? Tony would love for his damn memories to return and not have to start anew. The lack of progress on his amnesia worries him too. He hasn’t gotten a single memory back since he woke up in that hospital on Banturia, not even a flash of one.
"Yes, they're two or three days old, tops. Do you have a nursing mother?" A pause. "Too bad. Could one of your foster families take them in? Okay, call me back. Thanks."
"It would be. But just friends is great too, I swear." To Tony's surprise Steve kisses his cheek before he goes on his way, maybe a little faster and stiffer than if they hadn't had this encounter.
"Give your boss what's needed to patch up the place, understood? We Avengers don't like having debts. If there's money left, keep a twenty-five percent tip and give the rest to Tal."
No objection there, Steve's been feeling trapped in his jeans since the start of this conversation. When his pants are down his thighs with his boxers, Steve goes to fist his dick—he's so hard!—but Tony stops him, tutting.
While coming back to Earth, Tony had worried about many things. That the army he saw in space had returned and taken over the planet. Pepper having had trouble with Stark Industries for a bit after his 'death' before making it better than ever. Maybe that SHIELD or whatever replaced it had done a poor job in maintaining the Avengers’ gear and someone had gotten hurt, or even worse, died. Steve being secretly relieved that Tony was gone and now living in bliss with Bucky. He'd never thought he'd find a fractured team because of politics.
"For fuck's sake!" Tony had finally snapped when Steve had once again said Tony shouldn't waste his time on searching for Hydra intel. "I'm just trying to help! Why don't you let me?"
Well, at least there’s that, Tony thinks. Not every Avenger was against him. Maybe because they weren't there, who knows, but he'll selfishly take it.
There are only two soldiers still standing, both left with rifles empty of darts and terror on their faces. The wolf makes a sharp move forward as if it's going to attack, and the Hydra men turn around and start running for their lives. Tony half believes the beast will follow, but it quiets instead and turns its massive head to look at Tony.
He can already picture himself lounging the sun, watching Steve slicing through the infinity pool in a tiny speedo. Or maybe in nothing at all.
Tony squints up at Steve, as if disappointed by the question. "Why would I call Janet or Pepper? Because they are women?"
"Maybe you—" Tal begins to suggest, but without waiting for the advice, Tony flips a tile from the dealer. "Oh, bummer."
Steve picks her up and affixes the leash, but when he puts her down outside of the pen she just… stays there. Even when Steve gently tugs at her.
Having amnesia sucks. That's another thing for which Anthony resents Vers. Not only did she kill his family in that terrorist attack with the Skrulls, Anthony has no points of reference for his life from before. Which means he doesn't even know who the guy that appears for him as the Supreme Intelligence actually is.
Steve is so engrossed in listening to Tony and watching the kittens that he doesn’t notice DUM-E's approach. He jumps in surprise when the robot's head gently whirs near his ear.
When he took on the kittens, Tony had said that he'd help foster them until they could find the sisters a new home. Frankly, Steve doesn't see him giving the kittens away, he's too attached; but this could very well be a bubble out of time for Tony too. He's a successful businessman, with an agenda that would make a world leader cry. Before long, he might not have time to devote to pets.
"Don't say that. And, well"—Steve pauses for a second, his cheeks reddening—"there's always the armor." He bites his lip as his eyes drop to the arc reactor.
Tony had the advantage at the moment, even as he protected his head from being slapped by feathers. Cora did not try to peck at him or scratch him with her talons, which they both knew would hurt. Lilly, now fully awake, was trying to intervene.
"It's alright. It's the risk of the job; we all know that. Though admittedly I seem to almost die a lot." Afghanistan, the reactor theft and fight with Stane, the palladium poisoning, the Battle of New York, now this...
"Nama of Broldu," the bouncer says, giving him a shake. "My son and many more are back thanks to you, so the pleasure is mine."
Steve shakes his head no. So whoever their travel companions are, it's not anyone that Tony remembers.
They all agree and thank him while sitting down in the Adirondack chairs circling the fireplace. Rhodes distributes mugs, then carefully pours the hot chocolate. There's even a bag of mini marshmallows that they pass around, and once satisfied with his drink Steve sits back, legs stretched towards the fire. He ditches his gloves to feel the heat from the ceramic and savors the rich flavor that coats his tongue with every swallow. They're all quiet after the excitement, but it's comfortable. Easy. On the other side of the fire, Morgan has climbed on her father's lap, and Steve can't help but to look at them with longing. Maybe, if the stars align, he'll be able to be part of their family one day. He wishes for it with everything in his heart.
"Only sayin' it as I see it," Steve mumbles, a lot shyer now that they're face to face. He busies himself by shoving his feet into boots he appropriated, ones that sadly look too small.
Fuck, Tony hates this. He doesn't want to give Steve false hope, but this isn't a black or white situation either. "You are a great guy, and I like you a lot. But I am not sure if I want—"
Steve can feel his cheek and ears heating because it might have been a factor, yes. He's trying to adapt his way of thinking, but it's sometimes easy to fall back on what he learned.
There are heavy steps as Steve comes up the stairs again, and he seems both perplexed and relieved to see Tony where he left him.
The praise makes Tony fidget, looking down as he preps the kitten formula. He uses a lot more than they did when Steve last was here – another thing that changed. And is Tony blushing? It's the first time Steve notices a slight tint to his cheeks. It's the cutest Tony has ever looked, and Steve marvels at it. Who would have thought that the way to make Tony Stark blush was to compliment him on his kitten parenting skills?
The offer of feeding on Steve is a gift, but not the only thing Tony wants from this either. He would love to start a relationship with Steve, and he was gearing up to ask him out too. To make his intention clear, Tony trails his hand up to Steve's neck as he takes a step forward until they are chest to chest. In return, Steve carelessly drops the grimoire to the floor and closes his arms around him. It's been a long time since Tony's been this eager for a first kiss, and he is ablaze with want.
Tony eagerly takes out his phone and shows Chancellor Almar pictures and videos, proud as a peacock when she keeps praising Morgan. They've been at it for a few minutes when someone clears their throat, making them look up. It's Caly, who has been herding the Avengers around all day, looking sheepish but determined. Tony checks past her and sees that Steve has disappeared from the steps.
Steve startles at the knock on his door and a bullet rolls off the table and under the cupboard. He swears under his breath and hurries to assemble his pistol, half cleaned. It's late, too late for a courtesy visit, which only means trouble is afoot. It's unfortunate: he was about to go to bed after an uneventful evening, just as he likes them these days. At least he's still dressed, even only in his undershirt and jeans. After reloading his gun, Steve walks to the door, weary.
Van-Igha shakes her head. "I've always said that you're too smart for your own good, Anthony. You had a great life with us—"
Once they have immobilized and disarmed the spaceships, Carol and Tony start flying through them, not unlike hot knives through butter, making them explode. Thankfully, they're distant enough from Earth that the debris shouldn't fall through the atmosphere and cause problems. Tony does mentally apologize to astronomers everywhere though, who will have garbage in the way of their observations. On the other hand, he plans to salvage a lot of the material; the Krees use a metal that has no equivalent on Earth. But that's a job for future Tony. Right now he's pure destruction, though they let the manned space pods get away. They'll report to the Supreme Intelligence; hopefully the warning not to mess with Earth is clear.
It was just a brief flashback or two, and even if it was unsettling, it was clearly due to getting hit in the head
"Look at you," Tony says. He's definitely pleased by what he sees, which makes Steve proud. "You'll see, baby, I'm going to take good care of you."
The guy is cute, with nice shoulders and striking purple eyes and short black hair. He also looks about twenty-five years old in human age, and Tony is flattered but not interested. By his side, Nebula is squinting at the newcomer, distrustful. It's tempting to look back at the alcove to see if Steve has noticed and how he's reacting to the situation, but Tony doesn't dare.
"I am very happy by this outcome too," she says, covering his hand with hers. "I think you Terrans will be good for us. Add a little spontaneity to our old ways," she adds, inclining her head towards the dance floor.
Steve freezes in surprise when the fake fabric shifts against him, but he leans slightly backwards to observe, eyes dark with desire.
Steve evaded most of his day job for a week, but the vacation is over. They break up the bioweapon deal, and take down the organization behind it, but it doesn't stop there. There is one crisis after the other, and Steve barely sleeps. It's for the best, because he doesn't have the occasion to sulk about the end of his time with Tony and the kittens too much.
It's true that the Kree training regimen—and, probably, the transformation and effects of Yon-Rogg's blood—produced excellent results. Tony has bulked up a little, muscles more defined. He has a six pack now! Not a Captain America physique, but not bad at all.
"Could you repeat that please?" Tony asked, gripping the front of Steve's t-shirt. "I'm not sure if I understood everything."
It must be a rhetorical question as it's two in the afternoon, on a Tuesday. Tony's still in pajamas, feet up on the coffee table.
There's a knock on the inside door, and Viv comes in with what the doctor ordered. The heating pad is in a box, ready to receive the kittens. The vet deposits the black one in it, but keeps the white sister for now. He places her on her belly on the tea towel and holds her little head with his thumb and index finger.
It's the first time Tony's entered his home, and he's looking around with obvious interest. The illustrations on the walls might be a surprise, but not the low bookcase filled with dime novels. At least the place is clean, as Mrs. Urich passed through in the morning to help tidy up, eager to assist in his recovery.
Surely they set the program up in part with Tony's money from their first visit, so to say he has nothing to do with it is probably a lie. But Steve lets it go.
"The Guardians had a contract with the Sovereigns where the payment was Nebula. The Sovereign captured her while she tried to steal a power source. Batteries. The Guardians did the job, picked up Nebula, but then stole the batteries too," Carol says.
Thankfully Steve knows how to slow down a descent from his multiple dives without a parachute, and Tony's tech is awesome. Once he reaches him, Tony matches their speed to minimize the impact, then smoothly rolls to slide under Steve's falling form. They're thirty-seven feet from the ground when he locks Iron Man's arms around Steve's torso and then shoots back up.
It's a good thing they're on the phone and not on a video call, because Steve can feel his cheeks heat. He can't invite himself to the Tower, right? Would that sound too desperate? But then again, Tony assured him he could come back anytime.
In the box, the kittens are bumping into each other, searching for Tony, maybe. From the documentation Steve and Tony got from Doctor Martin, they mostly use touch and smell to navigate the world around them, and their eyes won't open for another week or so.
Steve listens and stays put but isn’t happy about it. Clearly he doesn't think Tony can hold his own, which is ridiculous. He has his armor, for God's sake.
Obviously the high priestess wouldn't have bet on that outcome (which, to be fair, never happened). She glances at Tony's hand.
"The only way to get the Soul Stone on Vormir is to sacrifice someone you love. I'm still surprised that it worked for Thanos."
One loss too many, it seems. Steve always walked a tightrope mental-health wise. Clearly traumatized—who wouldn't be, with what he went through?—and too proud to ask for help.
"Wherever you did, it's working," Steve says, smiling at him. "You have such a way with kids. Peter also worships the ground you walk on."
Steve misses having Tony around for many reasons, but his insights on recalibrating field situations onto a larger political chessboard is definitely one of them. He often has interesting points that they've all overlooked.
"That is so disturbing." Steve grimaces. "Just my luck that Loki is the one with a crush, and not—" He shuts his mouth closed when he realizes he's about to say 'you', and can feel that his face is definitely tomato red now. Oh jeez.
In reality, in this timeline the stones don't exist anymore since Steve took them back to the past where they belonged. None of them miss the stones. They were nothing but trouble. Magic is a pain in the ass like that.
Agreeing to this space road trip and hoping that it would put to rest the last of the unease with Steve.
And fine, maybe Tony intentionally paid a couple of drinks to Colonel Phillips, who also frequently appears adjacent to Captain America information. Unfortunately, Phillips played stupid when Tony tried to ask about him. But the Colonel gave Tony the mail, including among others an envelope with Phillip's wife's name on it. When Tony had seen "Dernier" in the lot, it was too much of a temptation. He's always been weak for a good mystery.
As for Tony's vampire identity, since Steve realized who he was at the window and judging by the pile of books on the table that feature his kind, he figured it out too. Tony crawls closer to the mess and there are old spell books, newer ones, reference material on the supernatural and vampires, and even novels and DVD cases. If Bram Stoker's Dracula and Nosferatu are, even with all their faults, classics, Tony can't help but snort when he sees Twilight and Interview With The Vampire. He throws a disbelieving look at Steve, who has pinked up.
He gestures, and a white string comes out of a little device on Peter's forearms and wraps around Tony's wrists. When he tries to separate his arms, the bond is very strong. Enough that Tony needs to use his super strength and heat to break it. He can't wait to look at what it's made of.
Tony can't swear that he remembers everything in perfect clarity, but a lot has come back. The memory of the Avengers—the Battle of New York, the skirmish with AIM, Thor's run in with Malekith—insisted on playing behind Tony's eyes as he lay in the quarters Talos gave him. How the Avengers gradually went from coworker to teammates, and, in the two years between forming the band and the accident on Asgard, what Tony thought of as his slightly dysfunctional family. Not to dismiss his friendship with Bruce, Nat, Thor, and Clint, but that particular series of flashbacks also meant remembering Steve.
The look of alarm on Yon-Rogg's face is highly satisfying. It comes to reason, since having a way to control Tony's powers is certainly a big part of the Kree's strategy for this battle.
He's staring. Tony can feel his gaze, but he's too curious about the child to look back. The phone must recognize Tony's biosignature because it unlocks. The background has that little girl again, but in Pepper's arms this time, both smiling at the camera.
Tony has deviated to go around the bin but stops when Steve opens the lid and peers in. The smell of garbage is terrible, not helped by the hot weather, but the sound is clearer now.
and he can’t stop grinning. It feels as if there aren’t any problems that matter anywhere. Everything is alright. With a giggle, Tony concludes he hasn't been this high in years. Maybe that’s behind the success of this planet: really, really good drugs. He sure hopes the morning after isn't a bitch.
"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't want to believe it either, but he did. Well, Hydra forced him to do it, it wasn't Bucky's choice—"
Callie isn't interested by the pool at all, no matter what Sam does to entice her. Steve is thirsty and eventually gives his girl to Wanda before seeking a drink in the compound. He can't help but stop and smile at Thor, who's cradling a sleeping Snowball – surely she's exhausted by all the excitement.
Steve shakes his head. "No. He wasn't on Earth when the Avengers split. Neither was Thor. They came back at the same time as Thanos."
It takes a dozen strokes and Tony starts coming. Immediately Steve pulls off so that the jizz covers his face, keeping his mouth open and tongue out. It's gratifying that Tony curses loudly.
"Carol," he replies, but it doesn't fit. He rarely calls people by their given first names. "I'm curious, what do I usually call you?"
"Fair enough," Tony says. He turns in his chair and rests his chin on his hand, watching her straight on. "I'm sorry I forgot." He feels as if he's letting Nebula down somehow.
"Get out of here." He needed time to process, and Tony didn't want to say or do something he wouldn't be able to take back. Like punching Steve in the face.
Tony has his footing back, and this time his laugh is amused, though not mocking. He cards his fingers through Steve's hair, pulling him forward for a brief peck on the mouth.
"I'm not letting you go in there alone, Tony!" Steve says, not pulling so hard anymore but still not releasing him. "Sam, do what you can, but do not, I repeat, do not touch what looks like a hologram." A pause. "I have to, Sam, I really do."
Steve opens and closes his mouth like a fish several times, at a loss to say anything that isn't cursing on Tony's behalf. Not distracted from his work at
"I gotta agree with you on this one," Steve says, eyeballing the gyrosphere, its door twisting open and letting a cloud of mist escape. It unfolds, revealing a well built shirtless man inside, strapped to a contraption that keeps him standing.
One moment everything is fine, they have the last of the bad guys mostly rounded up and cornered on the roof of a skyscraper on Park Avenue that is thankfully not his own. Then a ray gun hits Steve in the chest and he tumbles off the edge.
"It was just a fright, no worries. We should have warned you that humans and daemons cannot separate."
His heart starts beating faster because he didn't hear the alarm. Shit. Pepper will be disappointed again.
She's in Steve's bubble, a hand now on his shoulder. He might look perfectly fine with the attention to any strangers looking, but Tony wants to laugh at the way Steve's ears are pinking up.
The server they flag for their request bows his head and promises he'll be right back. Off the dance floor the music's volume is a lot lower, which is a welcome change. Maybe it's the drinks that are now hitting differently, it's late—whatever time it is—or it’s just his age, but Tony realizes he's tired. Nebula also seems exhausted and has tilted to lean into his side. When Tony curls an arm around her to show he's fine with the contact, Nebula delicately rests her head on his shoulder. There is immense trust in the gesture, which warms Tony right up. From the little he knows, Nebula has had a rough life. That she can take comfort in his presence like this is precious and can’t be taken for granted. Hell, Tony figures he might have the parental gene, after all.
Family, gosh, isn't that the dream? He wishes that it would be like that so much; him, Tony, and their fluffy children. Maybe real ones in a few years. One can hope!
"Glad you could come," Tony adds, offering his mechanical hand at his turn. The strength and feel of the grip is perfect, of course.
"No worries. He has strict instructions never to move if either of the girls is less than a foot from him. I made it hard coding, and FRIDAY has overrides to stop him too. Same for U."
"Ah, no, come on," Steve says, taking pity on DUM-E, who looks inconsolable. "I agree that he can't touch them before they're bigger, but he could watch them at least?"
"The wedding tells this world that the Avengers, and the whole superhero community, is standing united," Sue explains.
Tony frowns. "You don't have to do those, you know. Even if the reporters are nice and have good intentions."
Steve's expression, which had been pretty easy going and open until now, suddenly goes blank. His mouth pinches and he gets up, wrapping the blanket around his hips.
"That's high praise, Bodhi, I am honored!" Tony says. "Everyone, meet Snowball and Princess Bella Calliope."
"I disagree," Steve chimes in. "You rotate between Marvel, The Marvel, emphasis on 'The,' or Captain. But never Cap."
So Steve finally reunited with his buddy. Too bad he'll end up in jail for terrorism, unless his lawyers can prove that he's still brainwashed.
“Thank you, friends. It is an honor to count you as Shield-Brothers.” Thor embraces his mother again before they leave Frigga’s chambers.
"And then she abandoned you here on her home planet, one that she clearly doesn't care about," Yon-Rogg says, making Tony roll his eyes.
He puts the sleeping kitten next to her sister in the third incubator, which they built in between feedings. It has the heartbeat noise, precisely heated water circulation, an extra soft lining, and Steve even has an app to see the kittens' live cam on his phone. It looks very comfortable. Steve has seen Tony do manual work often, it's what he does, but it's the first time that Steve has been so involved in a project. As a sounding board, yes, but they made the hotbed together, and he's very proud of the result. Steve wouldn't be surprised if Tony already has ideas to improve it, though.
"I'm interested!" Tony blurts out, which is a relief. "Of course I'm interested," he adds with a widening smile, though Steve would argue that it wasn't obvious at all.
"It's great to meet you, Peter. As for your first question, when you got here, the Krees are the ones who kidnapped me two years ago. They're probably on their way to grab me again."
Steve is blushing, but looks Tony in the eyes. "If you feed on me, it will bring you back to full strength, right?"
"Yeah," Steve says, carding his fingers through Tony's hair. He's looking at him with so much fondness, it makes Tony feel even warmer than gorging on his life essence. "I keep bumping into an incredibly attractive billionaire. Renowned tech genius, funny, mysterious, and possibly not entirely human. Way out of my league, but it seems he might like me back."
"Yes, thank you for the wonderful welcome," Steve adds, and raises his mug at his turn. "Here's to a long and fruitful friendship between our two peoples, and to many more victories! Skol!"
Hydra-U bought along several bus loads of their fans today, and they're packed in that very section, waving ugly octopus foam mitts. Steve has a moment of moral weakness where he wishes for the foul to hit one asshole in that group in the face. In the end everyone is safe, apart from spilled drinks. Bummer. The Hydra fans have been rowdy all game long, from throwing trash on the field to insulting Steve by calling him a cheater for constantly playing in his Fully Shifted form. It's fine, Steve's used to it. Shifters and Regulars have coexisted forever, but there are still debates about what is acceptable or not in the name of 'fairness'.
"I was getting some fresh air, flying around, and I patrolled the perimeter. That's when I saw a bundle of cloth near the Time Fog, back by the Classified Zone. It turned out to be this little guy, all alone. Who does that, leave a kid out there?"
Steve is gazing in the distance, subdued. Probably taking in how much Thor lost. Tony wonders if Steve was witness to any of it.
"Yep." He has no one to answer to and is taking advantage of it. A day off just because he feels like it.
"Absolutely certain." He looks resolute, so Tony takes him at his word. At one point you have to let people be in control of their own agency.
"He knows the trigger words to activate the Winter Soldier," Steve explains, and his shoulders relax when Bucky has finished gagging Zemo.
He flies towards where she crashed to pick up the body and bring it back as proof of his success. Gory, but necessary.
"You know, all three of us have been able to start over, at one point or another. The circumstances have been different… but there's one thing that's the same. None of us did it on our own."
They exchange rings and Thor joyously declares them husband and wife. The crowd cheers when Steve dips Natasha—armor and all—for their first kiss as a married couple. Tony can't help but smile, too, and he really, really wishes his lucky counterpart a long happy life.
When Steve steps out of the car, he hears laughter and high-pitched cries of joy. The immediate smile in reaction is impossible to stop: Morgan must be playing outside. Steve puts on his hat and gloves and investigates instead of knocking on the door.
Steve shakes his head, still looking like someone punted his puppy, but after a long moment, he looks at the device and prompts, "Make a gauntlet."
"It all came back. Enough, anyway. And I’m not going to let it poison our lives for one more second. It took way too many years away from us, Steve."
"I knew you'd change my life the very first second I saw you, Natasha," Steve says, hands in hands with his bride. "And you did, for the better. You are everything I ever hoped for, and exponentially more. I vow to support you, and to always have your back. I take you, Natasha Stark, to be my wedded wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death do us part, according to God's holy ordinance; and thereto I pledge thee my faith."
The nickname makes the side of her mouth curl up again, but this time in amusement. It was low-hanging fruit; she probably heard it from him before. She flicks the mock football and spins it in a perfect arc, right between his thumbs.
He'll never tire of the way Steve says his name. And hearing that Steve returns his feelings, and that it's not just infatuation or desire, is the best feeling of all.
The examination room in question is small and smells quite a lot like disinfectant, but that might only be to Steve, who's very sensitive to those chemicals. There's a stainless steel table to deposit the animals, but Tony doesn't relinquish the kittens. He’s opened the bundle and is whispering to the cats about how they are wonderful babies and how the doctor will be here soon. Frankly, Steve couldn't be more smitten if he tried. He knew he had a crush on the guy the size of the moon, but this is just too much. Steve takes the liberty of going to the sink, where he wets several paper towels and tries to clean his shoes and pants.
"Fuck," Tony swears again as adrenaline floods his system. He needs to get away from whatever beast this is right now.
Tony can't look away from the pure mind-boggling sight of Knowhere through the cockpit window. He read the intel prepared by Carol and Nebula on the mining outpost so in theory he knew what to expect, but there's a difference between words on a screen and actually seeing the gigantic decapitated head of a Celestial floating in space. Clearly, it's the same for Steve.
"On top of a traumatic brain injury seven days ago. Those things add up." Nebula’s lips are a thin, stern line.
It gets predictably darker when Tony slips under the cover of the forest, but it's still possible to follow the trail without tripping. Maybe he should have brought a lamp, even though it would have made him very easy to spot if he's not alone in the woods. There are almost no sounds this late, but infrequent peals of laughter from deeper in the forest draw Tony in like a moth to a flame. It's a particularly good idiom, since that's what Tony finds. A hundred feet away from him, men are playing dice next to a few tents and a campfire. With his scope, Tony carefully checks out the soldiers. He is thrilled to see Dugan, Morita, Falsworth, Barnes, and Jones. But… there's no one else, and none of the men are captains. It's an enormous disappointment, and it makes Tony reconsider his whole quest. Was he wrong about everything? Is Captain America just a tale after all?
Tony's angry, still. Furious. But what’s certain is that Steve is full of regrets. On top of that, no matter the story he's been told, Tony knows Steve glossed over a lot of things. He can't imagine splitting the Avengers over a disagreement on oversight. It must have been more complicated than that. And if they actually fought? He would have had a reason. It convinces Tony that he's not white as snow in this clusterfuck.
Steve just finished wiping his little charge, the black one this time, and makes a non-committal sound. The last ten hours have been fantastic, and Steve loathes having to leave the bubble of care they’ve built here in Tony's workshop. Steve's joke about having a favorite has prompted Tony into feeding the kittens alternately, to ensure equal bonding. Steve keeps saying it's to spread the love, which makes Tony grin.
Indeed, Zemo might look even more surprised by that than by Tony's earlier powers, which has him snort in amusement. Since he hasn't kissed Steve in what is criminally too long—okay, since they exited the Quinjet—and it's fun to rub it in Zemo's face, Tony gets on his tip toes and does just that. Steve doesn't miss a beat, taking Tony in his arms and deepening the kiss. It's very nice.
"I can't—" Tony takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly. His heart is racing so fast, he's afraid he's going to burst into flames (literally). "I can't believe I got everything so wrong. I thought you were leaving me for Bucky."
"Shhh," Steve repeats. It's not that loud, he knows, but he wouldn't want her to wake Tony. "I've got you. Here we go."
"Very much no," Steve insists. "In fact, I think there's something brewing between Carol and Rhodes."
Carol nods, approving. "Full bird?" Tony grins proudly, and she smiles back. "Good for him. You mean a suit like that little red and gold number I saw?"
“Pleased to meet you,” Frigga says afterwards. “Thor has spoken highly of you both, and of the rest of your group.”
"I didn't stay," Carol cuts in, "and continued to help the Skulls against the Krees. Which I've been doing ever since."
"Lower the lights," the woman demands. "Hi there. You're restrained, and we blocked your powers for the moment, which sucks, I know. But we need to talk whenever you're ready."
"That's good, quick thinking as always, I expected nothing less. Thank you, J. My personal override code for the suit, when I left for Asgard, was Charlie Alpha nine two nine Sierra Tango. The media say DUM-E was my first learning bot at 16, but I started working on you first, three years before that, on my Commodore 64. The prologue comments on your current code aren't just references to legacy coding. The first string of letters between dashes spells out 'I am proud of you' with a Vigenere Cipher where the key is 'Friend'." He pauses. "Look, my 30 seconds are probably up, but you're my greatest creation, J, even more than Iron Man. When I returned to the Malibu house, after Afghanistan, you told me that you'd calculated the probability of my safe return at 0.25%. I don't know what your numbers were for this one, but yes, I've defied death again, I'm really back, and I've missed you, buddy. Do you have questions for me?"
Tony would propose Bruce, but they haven't seen him since the Ultron fiasco. Hell, Tony's barely on speaking terms with Steve himself. It's only been a few weeks since the rogues came back to the United States, following the Accords being amended and Barnes’ pardon. Saying that it's strained at the Avengers compound is an understatement. They still fight well together, though, as evidenced by the robots the Avengers easily kicked out of Miami a week ago.
He trails off, and Tony understands with perfect clarity that Steve has been blaming himself for Tony's presumed death all of this time.
When they get back to Leipzig, the Joint Counter Terrorist Center branch of the CIA under the command of another Ross, Everett this time, is present to collect Zemo. Fortunately, this more sensible Ross agrees to listen about the potential Kree problem before arresting the Avengers. He therefore accompanies Steve, Bucky, and Tony as they rejoin the others, who've commandeered a meeting room in the airport.
"No," Rhodey shrugs. "I just felt that I had to say something, but I'm good with that plan. Are you sure you're okay to work with Rogers and Barnes?"
Tony raises his hand to stop him. "Hey, no. I'll be fine. And if I'm not, isn't that why we're here anyway? I'll be right there."
"If you don't want me to come in your mouth, pull off now because I'm close," Tony warns. His balls are tightening, and his voice is low.
Somehow Steve squeezes harder. "Rhodes argued and argued with Thor that it wasn't possible you'd die in a lab accident. He wanted to search for you. And I did nothing. Just like with Bucky."
They were expecting the kittens to open their eyes any time now, as they're almost a week old, but it's thrilling nonetheless.
"Of course." Steve seems contrite and looks at the floor. Tony feels very protective of him and squeezes his hand. His heart is also full to bursting with love for Rhodey. Tony would do anything for him, too.
"Ah." Tony pauses but doesn't seem too put out. "No worries, bumblebee. We'll figure it out," he then tells the little boy.
"Let him play," Nebula says, jerking Tal away. It's only when she does that that Tony realizes Tal was practically glued to his back.
Steve had said nothing, in fact. Instead, he'd cupped Tony's face with his large hands—oh so careful and tender in that moment—and he'd kissed him. A firm press of lips, impossible to misinterpret but for a declaration of intent. Just like that, Steve had rearranged Tony's world and made it better.
"We work on appointments," Viv says slowly, throwing a nervous glance to an old man and his dog in the waiting room. At least the clinic doesn't seem too busy at the moment.
Once released on the floor, Snowball starts crouching very low to walk. Hell, she's crawling, which is indeed funny. And she seems mortally offended by the whole situation, with long pitiful meows.
He tightens his hold a little more and pulls Steve down firmly. Without even thinking about it, Steve fluidly goes to his knees. Holy fuck, but this works for him indeed. There's something so sexy about Tony being in control; of course he's into that. Kneeling on the tile floor means he's eye-level with the bulge in Tony's trousers, and he reaches for his belt with hands made clumsy by overpowering desire. Steve needs Tony in his mouth yesterday.
. It's been so long since he's been fucked that Tony’s almost forgotten the feeling of intrusion before it turns really good. Again Steve is cautious, though, pushing in slowly while scrutinizing Tony's face for any sign of discomfort. It's his "I-have-a-battle-plan-and-I'm-sticking-to-it” expression, and a laugh bubbles up in Tony's chest.
The voices are getting clearer and sharper, and less like Antony is hearing them as if in a dream. He only needs to open his eyes, just a tad, and—bad idea. The bright light is akin to a stab to his brain, and Anthony shuts them again while stifling a groan. He's in enemy hands, and his only advantage on whoever caught him—Vers, the Skrulls, he remembers now—is that they don't know he can hear them.
“Thank you, Hildisvini. It also signifies stubbornness, conflict and disorder, which are things I have had to work on all of my life,” she adds with a self-deprecating twist of her lips.
The War Machine opens up and a second later Rhodey is jumping into his arms with a whoop of joy. His hug is tight and Tony is verklempt, tears coming to his eyes.
"Don't worry, I've got you," Tony reassures, eyes catching Steve's. He gives him a devilish grin and then secures both hands on Steve's hips and pulls him forward, inviting him to sink in the wet inferno of his mouth.
"As Fury's assistant, Miss Potts generally knows what is going on around here, I am just saying," Steve replies, badly covering up.
"We do, to my surprise," Nebula says with a huff. "And now that we’ve exchanged platitudes, you should rest." She grabs Tony's upper arm and tugs. "Come, I'll guide you to your quarters."
Steve watches Callie being dragged, as previously described, like a fluffy mop on the pristine – thank God! – workshop floor. Meanwhile, Snowball is army-crawling like a goof. Heart full to bursting, Steve shakes his head.
Nama scoffs loudly, not believing Carol one bit, but with some affection. "Yeah, yeah. I still need you and your group to leave all weapons either in your ship or at the check-in desk. It has to be fair to everyone."
"Hey, Tony. We're taking you off the machine now. Hang in there. You're safe, I promise. We're friends."
"So much," Tony says with pride. DUM-E makes a joyous sound at that. "Gimme," Tony tells Steve, asking for Callie's leash. "
Tony grins, opening his eyes to see Steve stretched out too, facing him but comically far away. Not how Tony sometimes imagined ending up in bed with the man, but it's all right.
He is sitting on one of the cargo hold's benches and watching Tony approach with resignation. He looks very different from the Bucky Barnes Tony knows from the pictures of the Howling Commando; long hair, stubble, black leather jacket, and combat boots, and a shiny metal arm that raises a million questions. Very handsome, which Tony hates himself for noticing. Couldn't blame Steve for being hot for the guy, on top of him being his best friend from the past. Tony stops before Barnes and crosses his arms over his chest.
"So how did we end up in space with those two gals?" Tony asks. Carol said they didn't know each other much, and Nebula almost treats Tony like a child. On the other hand, there was good banter between the two captains earlier. "Are you and Carol together?"
"I don't care to stay here more than we need to either." Tony gives Steve the VHS tape. "JARVIS, can you document the room please?" They'll want as much data on the threat that those soldiers were as possible.
He won't guilt trip Tony like that, though, so he keeps the words in and grabs his backpack instead, making for the door.
He turns around and forces the shift, leaving Steve's house in the form he arrived, but in diametrical contrast when it comes to spirit and energy. Victor better watch out because Tony is motivated to come back to his wizard as promptly as doable.
"I'm fine, Neb. I just need to rest a bit." He squeezes her hand. "FRIDAY will watch over me. She knows what to monitor."
They all got in through the window, and they leave the same way, which is funny if only for the face Richards makes. Also Steve says he's alright to be flown all the way back to the compound. It should be a twenty minutes ride at a speed that won't be too uncomfortable for him, they've done it before. Tony locks one of the suit's arms around his waist as Steve holds on right back, face tucked against the armor's neck to avoid the worst of the wind.
"Okay, so," Steve pipes up. When Tony glances up, Steve is a mix of amused and embarrassed. "I'd appreciate the privacy, Cora, if you don't mind."
Tony has so much love to give, and Steve has dreamt of having some of it for himself for a while now. Maybe it's not meant to be; Steve doesn't know if Tony is interested in him at all, but he'll never be certain if he doesn't risk putting the offer out there. It is high time Steve mans up, and he vows to himself that he won't leave Stark Tower before asking Tony out, for better or for worse.
Anthony has made his opinion on said plan clear and how it is, without a doubt, doomed to fail. Vers just annihilated two Kree ships as easy as breathing, which Anthony had to respect. She goes binary at a strength that he admits he can't quite match, so the only way to fight her is by using the element of surprise. The stupid trap Yon-Rogg is trying to set won't work. They have to act now, when she recently spent a ton of energy, and before she charges up again.
The entire team whoops in delight when the ref shouts that Rumlow is out, and the SHIELD fans in the stands go wild. Hell, Steve imagines his mother is freaking out right now, she's always been a very vocal supporter. It always feels extra good to beat Hydra, and this is a beautiful ending to a harshly disputed game. Steve trots to the infield where his teammates are celebrating, ruffling Bucky's hair as soon as he's in range.
"It was a mistake. I know it was. I didn't want to hurt you like this, but I did. I'm so sorry," Steve says, voice hoarse.
It's like a direct punch to the gut. He blinks again and again, stupidly, trying to make sense of the words as he's transported back to December 16, 1991, learning that his parents died in an accident.
It's heartwarming to find out they’ve become such good friends. Rationally, Tony knows that he should insist that Steve get some rest too, but it's reassuring that he'll stay right here.
"Yeah, and you died," Tony says, still distressed about it. "I didn't like that one, even if some of the flying beans were cute."
The Siberian bunker seems empty, at least at first. They follow Barnes, who even with his machine gun looks borderline skittish, which reinforces the aura of danger they're facing. Tony could have gone in only in his undersuit—he doubts whatever awaits them can withstand his powers—but he preferred putting on the armor to have JARVIS with them. It proves to be a great idea when they enter a vast chamber with a circle of capsules holding what can only be the super soldiers.
"What are you going on about?" Tony asks, rolling his head to the side to squint at Steve. His face is blurry, and that's when Tony realizes he's crying.
"Come on, Daddy, hurry!" she demands as Tony and Rhodes huff and puff to get to the top at their turn.
Thor laughs. "There is a gray area for legendary heroes," he says with a wink, before turning serious. "I am ashamed that they captured you in my home, without being detected."
He reaches and cups Tony's ass, a long time dream of his, and finds it as firm and perfect as he ever thought. Tony steps forward as they embrace, but bends to kiss the ugly red scar on Steve's chest, where Lester's bullet exited. He's reverent, the kiss lingering, and Steve shushes and reassures.
He thought he was the only one turning in, but the others are following them. Earlier Nebula looked just as tired as he was, which makes sense, but he doesn't want to cut short what has been an enjoyable party for Steve and Carol.
"Of course." Steve turns on his heel and hopes that Tony will follow as he walks towards the kitchen.
"Sure it can. I must have a brain implant to control it by thought alone, but hold it in your hand and ask for something. I bet it’ll work."
He’ll never escape his warmongering legacy, no matter how much good he does with Iron Man. In retrospect, Tony should have kept the thought quiet, because Cora’s whole posture droops. He feels terrible about it, but if she knows anything about him, the self-hatred can’t be a surprise.
