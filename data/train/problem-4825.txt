"Tony, wait," Steve pleads, surprising the both of them as he grabs the brunette's wrist. Tony's heart jumps as he finds himself looking into a pair of pain-filled blue eyes. "Please, just stay."
"A-Are you sure?" Steve glances at his best friend whose eyes are now closed and his face in a grimace.
The crowd laughs again making Steve go beet-red but the interviewer simply raises an amused eyebrow.
"I can't do this right now," Tony mutters under his breath with a shake of his head; the whole situation is giving him anxiety and looking at Steve is not helping him calm down. The last thing he needs is more confusion.
"I know you love Steve," Bucky continues as if Tony never cut him off to begin with. "And that it'll always be Steve. But I love you," Tony holds back sobs by biting his own lip, running his hands through Bucky's damp hair. "I love you. And you should know that."
"Me?" Steve frowns, a worried expression instantly on his face when he realizes he'll have to leave Bucky. "Why? I can't leave Bucky."
What's worse is that Steve knows, he knows how much Tony resents his father for how he treated him. No one ever brings up Tony's family because despite Stark's annoyingly arrogant personality, they all know how much Howard still impacts him to this day.
"All of which your father gave to you," Steve responds, immediately wishing he could take it back when he sees the look on Tony's face. The calm facade falls away instantly, revealing all of the vulnerability he usually keeps hidden.
"You're adorable, but you talk too much," Tony shrugs, trying to act cool despite being jittery with butterflies. "I like you, too."
"Shit, fuck," Tony looks into Bucky's worried blue-grey eyes and his heart jumps. "Get Banner. And Steve. We need to figure out a cure."
"No," Tony insists through a muffled sob wrapping his arm tighter around Bucky and pulling him closer. "No you don't."
"You know what?" Steve smiles fondly at the the brunette who gazes up at him with warm brown eyes. "I think I actually like interviews."
"Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist," Tony responds calmly, slowly losing his patience. Contrary to popular belief, he hates fighting with Steve but sometimes he feels it's the only way the other man will talk to him.
"It's okay, Buck," Tony manages a shaky whisper. "I forgive you," he grabs Bucky's clammy hand and runs his thumb mindlessly across the top. And he does. Tony really does forgive Bucky.
Steve doesn't know what upsets him more: the fact that the whole time he's been secretly falling for the genius, he's also been hurting him or the way Tony can't even look him in the eyes.
"How do we even know what they're going to ask?" Steve asks still just as nervous as before. "How do you even prepare for an interview?"
Within seconds Bucky's skin regains color and blue-grey eyes find warm coffee brown and the view makes Bucky's heart surge. If he's dead then that's okay because this is a heaven he could damn well get used to.
"Big man in a suit of armor, take that off and what are you?" Steve spits out angrily and all heads turn towards the kitchen; Steve and Tony arguing is no surprise but this one seems to be worse than usual.
caught up in the lab that you can't spend some time with the team?" Steve yells at Tony, his voice laced with pure anger and disgust. The younger man was used to this though; after all, this isn't the first time he's been yelled at.
"Because it is," Tony chirps from behind Steve's shoulder. "Just answer whatever questions they ask honestly and confidently, it'll be over before you know it."
"I think I can make a cure," Bruce states firmly and Tony prays he's right. "But I'll need to go to my lab to do it. And Steve, I'll need you to come with."
"Uh.. I'm sorry," he grins sheepishly and runs his free hand through his short blonde hair. "What was the question?"
, but some of our talents weren't created by a serum!" Tony returns the blonde's anger with his own.
"It's the poison, you're hallucinating," Tony explains quietly, carefully taking small steps towards the cowering soldier. "That wasn't you. None of the violence, the killing... none of it has ever been you."
And Bucky does love the small brunette. He doesn't know when it happened but somewhere in between watching Tony work in the lab rambling aimlessly about equations and theories Bucky will never be able to understand  and watching him be the most compassionate person not only to Steve but to the other Avengers, Bucky fell hard.
"Tony, leave!" Bucky moans painfully and Tony scoops him up as best as he can, laying him on the couch in the corner of the lab. "Please, I don't want to hurt you."
"Oh, horseshit, Steve. Sounds like you're talking destiny and predetermination. Didn't think you believed that."
At that moment Stark seemed to remember the Captain was there at all. A flicker of an eye back at Steve, barely perceptible; and then he wrapped up the sentence and turned back. Twisted a corner of his mouth up, at Steve, in a manner that didn't seem quite mocking, but didn't seem quite
I apologize for adding to the number of planned chapters, constantly. But I keep thinking I'll be able to wrap it all up in two chapters, but the things keep happening, the plot keeps happening. This chapter was unplanned, but felt totally necessary. The ending is in sight, I promise!
"Actually," Tony said, "it's statistically improbable there would be two axe murderers in one car, and since you are one..."
And then, frantically, Tony was untucking Steve's shirt from his pants, burning, dying to feel skin under his fingers, to dig them into Steve's ribs, to drive his nails into Steve's back and leave marks. He couldn't stop his hands from moving, touching everywhere, the shoulder blades, then down, down, along the ribs and up again, pulling at Steve, pressing himself against him even though there was nowhere left to press. And Steve's skin was smooth and searing hot, and it was everything Tony had ever dreamed of.
It was the next morning. This time around Tony recruited both Jessicas, Luke, Bruce and Quentin Quint (whom no one liked much, so mostly everyone referred to him by his full name, even though there were hardly two Quint's to be found in the remnant of the fleet, let alone two Quentins). All of them, plus Sam, who seemed to be their senior buddy that morning, were circling the tech deck at a moderate-to-very-decent pace. They were all getting better, fitter, faster. Tony wondered what the prank would be this morning, when the creeping smell of –
Tony: I know this is entirely subjective, but you know how I felt in those months before we started talking? And afterwards too. I felt like I'm not worthy of anyone's time. I didn't count. I was okay to leave behind. Even though I made my choices, obviously; that's still how I felt. I just didn't matter. And you know what, I was beginning to accept the fact. I was making my peace with it.
Tony: And – yeah, see, you're interested already – and, in any case, I'm standing here and I'm thinking how much you would love it, and really, you gotta see this.
I took him in my arms then and told him he didn't have to ask. He buried his face into my neck, and for a moment I thought he was crying, but he wasn't. I honestly think he was too exhausted to bother.
touched him, when he leaned down like Tony wouldn’t have dared and put his lips to Tony’s, and sealed Tony’s world to himself... All of it had left Tony on the verge of tears; it was too much, it was all too much.
thought sent a mental hot shiver trough him all right. Steve's eyes went marginally wider at that very moment. Which was... interesting.
"That was probably triage," Tony said sharply, coming over. More sharply than he intended, as a matter of fact, but he was now close enough to see Steve's eyes, rimmed with red. After a fire, that wasn't such a great sign. Just like the hoarseness, it meant the protective helmet had failed to do its job properly. The fact made Tony strangely pissed. "Triage," he repeated in a tad softer voice, because he wasn't pissed at
With a few quick strokes, Steve sketched a picture of a viper on his instruction board. "Who can tell me why vipers are shaped like this?" he asked with an inner sigh.
He blinked one more time. His arms hung limply in mine. "You're insane," he stated, which wasn't very encouraging. And then: "Okay if I hold you for a bit?" he asked, which only served to show how tired and heavy-hearted he was.
Tony: Although, hurling myself into Europa is probably heteronormative or something, so maybe I'll pick Ganymede after all, just out of spite and to shock everyone.
And despite the pretty words, a wave of sickly yearning, of a hope gone stale was so overwhelming Tony thought it would strangle him (turned out it was his covers that had somehow got rolled under his chin). And as he was waking up, he heard Barnes say: "Maybe you should talk to Stark."
Right about that time, a new problem presented itself. It was a creeping awareness that he was lying there, entwined in a most intimate cuddle-puddle with Steve Rogers. Back when he was undressing him, all he could think was how discolored Steve's skin looked, and how limp his body was; and Tony was shit-scared. But now that Steve's limbs had started feeling warm and alive next to Tony's, with his face only inches away from Tony's, there was a certain...physicality, that now arose and colored the situation. Once Tony started thinking about it, it became impossible to ignore. Tony immediately felt like a creep, and tried to turn his mind to other things.
Tony: It's got to do with the Accords. But only tangentially. Also, I said okay to doing it because I was okay with it. Don't worry about it.
Then, after he sent it, he came up with 32 different ways Steve could misinterpret it, 24 of them offensive. For a short while he contemplated finding Steve and somehow stealing his phone – deleting the messages – crushing the device – buying the mobile provider and deleting the texts from the servers...
Tony lifted his visor just to be able to arch a sarcastic eyebrow at Steve, then let it drop again. "Kings who sleepwalk themselves out of their own castles and into enemy hands aren't allowed to be sassy." Natasha wondered if the others had noticed the carefully concealed haunted look in Tony's eyes.
STARK: Oh, sorry. Not a weapon company any longer, please. You can access our mission statement on our official site. It's very informative. In case you've lived under a rock on the other side of the galaxy for the past ten years, that is.
Tony's bones are jelly, but he manages to prop himself up on an elbow and look down into Steve's face. He can't really read it, though.
“Look,” Tony said, still gently, and once he’d made an effort to open the tap, the words started practically chasing one another. “I haven’t had a real vacation in years, Cap. The last time Pep and I were going to get some downtime in Malibu, my house got blown up by terrorists, which, yeah, my own fault, I know, but
They still didn't talk more than necessary, but in the darkness of the simulator, the touches grew bolder. All of a sudden, Tony sported more bad flying habits than ever. Abruptly, there was a need for Cap to lean over him, place his hand over Tony's on the control stick, show him how to steer. Tony wasn't sure any longer which one of them instigated this. But in two seconds flat it would all go away, flicker off as if it never happened, and he thought he must be going crazy. Reading into things.
"I hadn't been back here since mom and dad died, I couldn't stand it", he heard himself confess. Where the hell was that coming from all of a sudden? And then, the compassion that shone in Steve's face was too much, and a quick step back for Tony was in order, a retreat into the practical. "There used to be electricity here and everything," he added hurriedly. "There's an old TV – a huge, thick one, you've never seen anything like it, I think – it's in their old bedroom. And a VCR. That's... never mind. The wiring must've gotten screwy at some point. I felt too shitty to look into it today. But I didn't think the place would look like this. I could have had someone refurbish it, get new furniture..."
Pieces of the conversation come back to Tony, and they fall together, and he realizes he's been using past tense too much.
After a short consideration, Steve apparently decided not to comment on this last statement. Instead he said: “Yeah, but the stim.”
All the tiredness fled Tony's joints when Steve's hand encircled his waist; Tony's arm was thrown over Steve's shoulder as Steve effectively half-carried him, even though Tony never needed help walking less than at that moment. His feet felt light as a hummingbird's wings. No one would have thought he spent the day drinking and shooting and raising his old life from the dead as if he were a magician. A stab of nausea would spoil the fest now and again – an awareness of what could have happened if Tony ha been just a second too late, if Fury and his crew had been just a light minute too far. Still, it only emphasized the fact that everything had worked out, somehow, and they were gloriously alive, and Steve's arm around his waist was warm and solid and fit there perfectly, as if it was meant by the 'verse to be there at all times.
You should be happy, he reprimanded himself. Tony was all right. What Steve came here to do was accomplished. And still, something in him longed for the intimacy of a shared blanket, even in a prison cell; something in him couldn't help but remember how it felt to have Tony pressed warmly against his body, as well as the familiar, safe certainty that Tony had his back in a fight.
", Tony interrupted. "You'd have to be made of stone not to be traumatized after everything that happened to you." He jumped up from the chair, started to pace, changed his mind. "Nothing wrong with admitting it."
"I will not be separated from my boyfriend!" Tony insists loudly. (Steve flinches.) "This is preposterous. We reserved tickets months in advance. I insist you find a way to seat us together!"
“You asshole,” he said, but it came out with far less viciousness than what burned inside Tony. And then, calmly: “Breathe. Can you breathe through it?
” Tony said, but it was more for show than anything else, because the pain took a mere seconds to turn into a yummy ache in his gut. He reveled in the feeling of fullness, of being thoroughly stretched around Steve. And Steve seemed to read him better now. He rotated his hips once, vigorously. His eyebrows danced for a moment. Then he came down to rest on his elbows, staring down into Tony’s face.
Some of the tension left Steve’s shoulders at that, and he nodded. "I am. I won't let anything happen to him." With that, he straightened up and walked over to his general, smoothly maneuvering him away from the new armorers, who were beginning to look terrified.
Tony: Is it sick that I find it kinda heartwarming that you get angry at me for what you perceive as my self-harmful behavior?
going to have this after tonight – this moment of easy camaraderie amidst wanna-be angry sex – and how
Needily, Steve moans, not caring any longer, and bucks up, trying to follow his fingers, to pull them back in, somehow, to suck them into himself.
"The animal will freeze to death. It had been in the water for some time. It was soaked through." Underneath the laconism, Tony recognized an echo of terror in Steve's voice, a hint of frantic look in his eyes. Suddenly he understood Steve's horror at the prospect of another living creature freezing to death like he almost did, understood what had probably propelled Steve to jump into the water to try and save the animal.
me." As if they had all the time in the world to tell each other things, as if they wouldn't die in the next ten minutes or so. To his own ears, his voice sounded more tired and imploring than anything else.
some time." It seems to him he's loved Steve since forever, in one capacity or another,  in one way or another, reluctantly, bitterly, uselessly, as a friend, an adversary, a polar opposite, someone who let him down and whom he let down in turn. But not like this, not romantically, not hopefully, not with a view of the future. It's never been like this before, with Steve, he's never felt quite like this. It's as if he had to have all the other boxes checked first, with him, to be able to have this, in the end.
One moment Tony was warm, mellow even – which had immediately mellowed Steve in turn, he realized with chagrin –  just to grow cold again in a matter of minutes. Back and forth, back and forth. Like a pendulum. For a few beats there it had been almost homey, sitting there, talking to Tony; more normal then their normal. And then back to the stand-offish, all guards on positions, man the cannons.
how it was done, she suppressed a smile. "He's alive, Steve. And we're here to keep it that way." Something urged her to continue. "
“And you’re always Steve,” Tony murmured, only half aware his words didn’t make much sense to anyone but himself.
"The functionality of the elevator is dependent on the equilibrium of the gravitational fields, both the one it's departing from and the one it's arriving into."
Steve took a deep breath. "Tony, I..." He swallowed. This had to be done. "I love you." These may have been the hardest words he'd ever said. Considering whether to go on at all, he decided to plunge in. Nothing to be lost now that already hasn't been. "I have loved you for... a very long time." It felt like letting go of a ballast. " I... I didn't think it
Meeting Steve's eyes across the room was like zeroing in on a target and scoring a superb hit, like playing the piano and finding that perfect rhythm, the perfect mood, the one you suspected the composer had had in mind when he wrote the piece. In that moment, Tony thought everything made sense and everything was going to be okay.
Steve wasn’t exactly changed, but there was a certain weariness visible around his eyes. A new softness too, Tony could have sworn, although it wasn’t so apparent at the first glance.
Someone was robbing the diner, and Steve was going to intervene, for sure, and somehow, somehow, a bullet would find its way and Steve would die the stupidest of all stupid deaths, because that was how these things happened, that was just Tony's luck, and Tony simply couldn't live with the possibility.
Tony: It's too early for this. In the morning, I mean. Did you see the secretary of defense resigned, first thing today?
Also, this infatuation business had to stop ASAP. It was going nowhere. He needed to focus on other things.
It wouldn't be tactful to ask, so Steve shut his mouth. Tony apparently sensed the unspoken question, though.
The song of the ship's engines was a multilayered symphony. It was their constant companion, day and night, and people mostly stopped noticing it. Still, Tony found himself listening to it often. It kept reminding him of how flimsy the ship was, how tiny and human-made and fragile the thing that kept them all from dying. But, however delicate, the hum also reassured him everything was still okay, everything was still in order. He was used to listening to the buzz of various engines since the days he raced on Virgon, since the days he test-flew his own new models, too.
"I'm.. not that much of a stickler for rules and formalities, actually" Rogers said, more mildly. Tony's first impulse was to snort, or it would have been, talking to anyone else. Bu there was something so genuine about Rogers at that moment, and he looked so young all of a sudden, that Tony swallowed. He wasn't sure why it mattered, but it did. He kept silent. "And it's not as if I can't take a joke," Cap went on, "as long as it's all in good fun."
He shook his head. He was trying not to appear desolate, I could tell, but his eyes looked wounded. I needed to go to him, and I also needed to think before I spoke and to not say things I wasn't absolutely sure of.
Steve paused to throw a few bites into his mouth, and then, when he'd swallowed, he answered the question carefully, "I think you love your daughter very much. And I think you are feeling guilty about the divorce. Jus like anyone would. So, about spoiling her – yes, you are? Maybe? A little?" Steve smiled. "But it's understandable. It's nothing to worry about."
Just their usual banter, really. He must have imagined Steve’s sudden blush. It must have been a reaction to the cold. Because what the man said was an almost insolent: “Promise?”
That memory is still eating Steve from the inside, hollowing him out like a diligent woodworm, even though Tony is right there. It will take time to heal.
Tony had come to the same conclusion himself. Frantically, he carried Steve to the couch, gently laid him down, propped his feet up with a bunch of pillows and blankets to stop the blood pressure from dropping further. But no –
to go and ask the hard question, did he? Tony presses the stop button. He looks into the mirror, and meets the serious and unblinking eyes of Steve's reflection. He sighs.
No one there. There was no one there, but when he looked back, Steve's grin was melting away already, turning into an uncomfortable, controlled expression.
Steve was standing there like he was frozen, but still firm, still not budging an inch. Suddenly, he seemed to Tony as if he was about to face down another batch of miscreants and not a, well, a semi-tipsy mechanic.
As he slowly pulls his pants down, he's already fully erect, pulsing and beautiful and itching for a touch. Tony would swallow him whole, excruciatingly slow, if only he could.
feel like an alien nowadays. At least he was a free alien, here. At least he wasn't an experiment, again, and no one was using him.
Tony: Look, I feel fucked up, Steve. In general, just fucked up. I don't know how else to acknowledge that. I feel really broken and screwed up in a way other people just aren't. And I can't just pretend it's not there. I mean, I mostly do, but at least with my friends, I can't. Feels like deception. I think I'm
Steve's phone was off, for better or worse. There was also a normal-person option of finding Steve and actually striking up a conversation. And he did intend to do it, he
It was so frank and earnest that Tony had to stop for a moment. To swallow. To recalibrate. He stood there blinking for a second. "Yeah, all right," he blurted. "Doable."
Okay, not nothing, it was sweet and it was kind; and Tony had no idea whatsoever what to make of it or where to file it.
Tony: By which I mean cutting off gangrenous parts while you still can, the way I was given to understand.
In this kind of weather, however, his first thought was that someone might need help. He activated the suit. As the nanites enveloped his body, he was outside on the porch already, at a run, and he took to the air, towards the place where the alarm was tripped. It was probably a deer, but it didn't hurt to check. He had a strange, disconcerting feeling about this, the heart fluttering in his chest telling him something was very wrong.
But that was a long time ago, and everything is changed, and he really shouldn't be thinking about this.
"Well, then," Tony says lightly, "I suppose we get ready to die here, eh?" Because, as much as he might want Steve, he doesn't want a reluctant Steve, he doesn't want a coerced Steve. He'll think of another way out. There must be something.
be a mortal wound. And then Thanos reaches out to touch Tony with his ugly big hand, and Steve is able to move again. All of his desperation and pain and stubborn refusal to give in come together, congeal into that one moment. Steve is between them, now, and he's pushing back,
Their eyes met. Electric shock was an old metaphor, but at least one aspect was sure true: it's generally impossible for the shock victim to let go of the energized object. They were glued to the spot.
"Try the latter and I will light you on fire," the furry guy says pleasantly. Tony gets a feeling they would get on splendidly if they got to know each other, but perhaps he's just in a charitable mood.
Then, Tony again. (He was always the more talkative one anyway.) "Look, what I wanted to tell you is... I really don't have the time for this."
Steve hid a smile. And then he looked down at the mug in his hands, then up through the shading of his eyelashes, right at Tony. A tiny blotch of color blossomed in his cheeks. If he wasn’t doing it on purpose, Tony mused, it was doubly unfair.
As he burst into the landing bay area, the scene he found was better than he'd feared but worse than he had hoped. There was smoke everywhere, thick and worrisome. It crept around his legs, lapping at his knees, but further ahead it resembled a full blown cloud descended into the ship, gray and dense. The bad thing was, it was the smoke of burning engine. The good thing was, the people Steve could see were all wearing either the protective suits like his own, or at least breath masks, and they were fighting the fire. The first person he recognized was Hope Van Dyne, a brilliant but reticent engineer who kept mostly to herself; she'd served on the
Tony: But you did plenty by capturing the serum. What happened to it, by the way? Hopefully you destroyed it? Also, I have to say that Madripoor makes way more sense now.
The point I was trying to make, though, is that we still tiptoed around each other. I didn't want to pressure him into anything and I didn't have the stomach to be irritated with him even when I was rationally aware I normally would have been. He later admitted that the idea of ever  yelling at me tied his guts into a knot.
Tony had gone to bed, and just left him here; to Steve it had looked more like an escape than anything else. Closing your postern gate and retreating into the citadel.
"They're almost here," Tony said, although he had no idea why he was whispering. And he turned to Steve, opening his mouth to say something... something
"If you say so," Tony allowed noncommittally. "Either that or your grandmother has a really wild imagination. And you must love her very much, to wear that in public. Must be nice." Steve thought he heard a wistful note in that last sentence, but then it disappeared and he figured he must have been mistaken.
That was all the encouragement I needed. "It feels great," I said with complete honesty. The points of physical contact were brightly lit in my consciousness. It was as if warmth and life radiated from them, waking me up, melting me down.
(because that would be the third time he asked, and really). No, scratch that, maybe even politics could work.
Tony didn't give a... Well, okay, he was running out of coital comparisons for the moment, but he still didn't care one bit.
Steve rubbed his forehead for a second, as if looking for lost words. The gesture was so spontaneous and somehow endearing that Tony softened immediately. He couldn't quite look away. His throat was tight and his mind was a little foggy; he felt frozen in place. Every step they took lasted years. Steve was too close for comfort.
The irregular meals were pushed through the tiny flap at the bottom of the cell door. That was all the contact he had with the outside world. So far, no one had required him to do anything, no one ordered him to make weapons, make the suit, make a bomb, make love not war, make a fool of himself, whatever.
The atmosphere in the elevator is all electricity and live wires, but they are not looking at each other. Neither of them is saying anything. It just... sizzles.
Then, a certain dampening in the sound. A series of low thuds from above. As if a party on the upper floor of the dorm had gone over into a too wild a territory; drunken redecorating, pushing furniture about, wrestling in spilled potato chips, things like that.
Tony: For the life of me, I don't know why I'm even talking to you, but fine. I'm taking Imitrex. Why?
, the scotch in Howard's breath had asked over and over again, like drunks do, not even listening to Tony's attempts to wheedle his way out.
"Really, Cap? I had no idea you were a cuddler." It sounded forced. He could practically feel Steve roll his eyes on the other side of the cell.
Tony Stark was... brilliant. And completely unsuitable for the army. And such a talented pilot that Steve had to
"No one ever comes," Tony said. "Sometimes they push food through the kitty door. Sometimes not. At irregular intervals, I think. Haven't really figured it out." He paused, wanting to ask what date it had been when they got Steve, to ask how they got him, but other matters were more pressing. "Listen, are you in pain? Did they beat you?"
It was almost ridiculous, how much they had to say now that time was running out, how words were finally tumbling out.
"But you don't go running with the nuggets?" he asked. She gave him a covert look, arched an eyebrow, as if she knew he was angling up to something. Steve smiled to himself.
Touching and exchanging shy caresses all the while, they'd picked up their things, scattered around, and dressed. Steve had found Tony's jacket, tossed on the floor. He had shook it out and held it out to Tony as if they'd done this a million times. And Tony had smiled to himself, so sweetly and sadly, like, Steve suspected, he never would have if he didn't feel so safe, enveloped in the hiding darkness.
He wondered if he should invite the new cadets into the pilots canteen that evening – all of them. As the captain, he could break the unwritten rules. Still, it was never a good idea for the ranking officer to interfere with the ranks' traditions and small games. Like the hazing, for example. You didn't step in unless it really got out of hand – unless it turned to outright bullying or if real aggression was springing from it. This time around it didn't happen because the nuggets had diverted the effort into the war with the tech. No-interference policy was sometimes for the best. The guys needed to find their own balance, their own dynamics. Things seemed to be working too. Both Clint, Sam and Natasha thought it was all going well.
"Right," Steve said. He was all business. "In that case, Thor, you take the right hand corridor," the one where the dorms were as well as Darryl's office and berth, Tony noted – "If it's blocked, try to clear out the rubble as much as you can. Try to get through."
, you know. Since you are already here and all.” As he spoke, Steve’s eyes had gotten rounder with understanding. “Which, Cap,” Tony said, emphasizing every word, “is what I meant in the
“Tony are you all right?” Steve’s voice sounded worried, somewhere out there, both far away and tantalizingly near.
This is Scarlet Witch, although you can't see her face; as you can see she is floating people out of a burning building. She's not... The big red bubble you can see, that's her power, that's what she does. She's using it to protect the people from the fire. There's some more of the similar, mostly photos, as you can see. That's Falcon, also doing damage control, rescuing folks. You know what, maybe it's not such a good idea to point us out here, but since the whole world is already pointing an accusatory finger at us, here, you can add our own finger to it. Take that any way you like.
"It's Carter, actually." Steve's voice was bright and calm and careless. It had a sharp edge that was new and, for Tony, nearly gut-wrenching.
And I can tell you what happens in book three if you're interested. Scoot over. What have you got there?"
Because, of late, he really didn't. After the demerit and with the relations with the tech getting into the whitely heated area, he'd stopped going to the illicit bar. Since the cadets still weren't welcome in the pilots' R&R, he didn't even drink. Unless Rogers was going to lay into him for the war with the tech, in which case... okay. Tony'd handle that too.
What I'm trying to say is, when it exploded, it really exploded. We'd been together for a few months already – seven, to be precise. I don't know why I'm even pretending I don't remember the exact dates; that day turned out to be quite memorable. Ridiculously enough, I can't for the life of me remember what the fight was about. I'm pretty sure it was benign enough to begin with, and then it just escalated. It lasted for hours. Everything, everything was coming out. We screamed, literally screamed  into each other's faces. There were occasional lulls, and then we would start shouting again. We went from room to room yelling at each other on top of our voices. I was about to start punching walls. Tony was shaking from rage. And, hours later, as the fight was finally beginning to peter out, what was left in its wake was coldness in my stomach. I was at the point when you have to fight to keep yourself angry, because that's easier than actually having to think:
Tony rolled his eyes. "For the tenth time, I was high on adrenaline at the time. You can't take that seriously. Besides, if you'd come back earlier, maybe. As it is, I aged out of clubbing in the meantime. I had to get out before it got embarrassing."
"It's already 10, Steve. You hate sleeping in," Tony tries to negotiate but Steve's ocean eyes remain closed.
"I do, Tony, and that's okay," Bucky opens his tired eyes, a small smile forming on his lips as he relishes in the feeling of Tony's skin on his. "Because if I had chosen differently then I wouldn't have met you."
Sure, Steve and Tony don't get along all of the time.. okay, most of the time. But when they aren't arguing, looks of longing are exchanged as well as suggestive comments (though those are mostly made by Tony). By now, they're the only ones who haven't picked up on their feelings towards one another.
"G-Get away from me!" He demands, pushing himself against the wall and as far away from Tony as he can get. "I'll hurt you!"
"Sir, it seems as though there is poison in Mr. Barnes' blood. Based on my calculations, it has been there for quite some time."
Tony finds Bucky's eyes, tears falling freely down both of their cheeks. Tony doesn't know what to say. No, he doesn't love Bucky— it's Steve, it's always been Steve— but he would be lying if he said there wasn't something there. He'd be lying if he said he didn't feel something whenever Bucky complimented his work or accidentally grazed his skin with his own.
Bruce looks over Bucky's blood pattern curiously, tapping the holographs obsessively for minutes until he pulls away with a grim, straight-lipped expression.
"Hold still, Grease Lightning," Tony mutters as he tightens a part of the new arm he had made for Bucky. "I almost think you'd rather be armless then strut around with my wonderful creation I so nicely constructed for you."
"That's the response I was hoping for! So the audience sent in a few questions for you all prior to this show. How about answering the public's most burning questions?"
"Definitely him," Bucky confirms, smirking as he hits Clint with a blue shell to knock him out of first. "Though Steve would never admit that."
"Hey, look at me." The pain in Steve's voice makes Tony tilt his head up to meet those ocean blue eyes hesitantly, and Steve reaches across the table to grab one of Tony's hands. "The truth is... I've liked you this whole time. More than like, really..." Steve mumbles, his cheeks flushing as he looks at their clasped hands, running his fingers over Tony's absentmindedly. "You're brilliant and beautiful and I guess I was just scared that-"
Before Tony can respond, the waitress returns with the check and the pair wait expectantly as she sets the check in front of...
"I've made a lot of choices that have gotten me here," Bucky whispers, giving into the idea that he's going to die. "I deserve this. I deserve to die."
"You've been spending a lot of time with him," Steve opens his eyes finally, a frown on his lips and evident jealousy written across his features.
It's no secret that back in the good ole' days, Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes were the best of friends. Scratch that, the two boys were more like brothers. Sure, they fought like animals but at the end of the day Bucky would die for Steve and Steve for Bucky.
Tony would let him go and he'll cherish the memory of this short time they'd spent together, and, ultimately, that was all that he could have in the end.
Steve blinked at him. Then his eyes softened. "Of course," he said. Tony replied with a small almost-smile. They, it seemed, had a truce.
The comms in the suits were of low quality. The thick, metal bulkheads interfered with the signal. Everything on
. "Doesn't mean you're fine. Means you're more fine than some of the other walking charcoal sticks. I know you
Tony made himself stop. Sat down. Met Rogers' gaze halfway. What was it that made him feel this way? The fact the Cap held Tony's fate in his hands? No, it wasn't that. Everything in Tony reeled in protest at the thought. This was just a nervous reaction, probably. An acute fear of dying out here, in this space bucket, without ever seeing the stars again. Something understandable like that. Hangover. Lack of sleep. (That one was always a good excuse.)
"Never better," Tony shot automatically, but Rhodey just closed his eyes and snorted lightly. "What's with you tonight, sweetcakes?"
And that's what makes Tony break, the dam full of tears finally leaking out of his coffee brown eyes as they drip freely down his shoulder. He can't bring himself to speak, he only nods.
"It's an honor to be here," Tony flashes the woman his signature publicity grin that's all white teeth and Steve actually thinks the interviewer might faint.
It had gone on long enough and the rest of the team was sick of it. They could hear the yelling from the living room where they sat: Clint, Bucky and Bruce playing Mario Kart, Natasha watching, giving the occasional pointer and Thor relaxed on the sofa with a huge mug of coffee.
"This is all my fault," Tony mutters under his breath, forcing any tears out of his eyes as he doesn't need another distraction. "If I had just-"
a chance to back out if he wants? Or did they misunderstand each other, back in the elevator? True, not much was said, but...
Gently, Steve set him back on his feet. "Thank you," he said, which made absolutely no sense to Tony.
And he knew how petty it was, so he stopped with that, stepped back, had to keep himself in check, had to keep it down, had to...
"Sorry?" Steve said. "What did you say?" His voice was a little strange, and a little quivery, and Tony very much wanted to kiss his face at that moment: not just the mouth, but the nose and the cheekbones and the eyes (those perfect, stubborn eyes!) and that brow of his that was always covered in floppy hair. Yes, he wanted to sleep with Steve. He also wanted to hold him in his arms all night, and to talk to him for hours, and to play with his hair, and to spend a day reading a book, head pillowed on Steve's stomach.
It shot through Tony like a thrill, like a lightning, and he felt it in his chest, and he felt it in his groin, warm and tight. The words that could set him on fire in two easy seconds. Pity that wasn't ever happening, eh?
"You're allowed into the kitchen," Tony now said. He was wearing a soft gray sweater and a pair of oil streaked jeans, and seeing him so relaxed and domestic, fussing around the kitchen, made Steve's heart do a crazy dance in his chest. He'd never wanted to hurt him.  If only he could make Tony understand that, if he could only make him believe him.
In a flash, Tony remembered the strange defensiveness in Steve's voice as he told Tony he was going to be volunteering tonight. Tony instantly felt like shit – what else was new? – for thinking Steve was simply being a righteous ass about it. "Like your work at the soup kitchen or your support group?" he asked softly. It was about time they stopped assuming what the other would say; it was high time they started actually talking to each other. Really talking. Even if nothing happened tonight – which would probably be for the best, anyway. Even in that case, they couldn't let this chance slip away. At least they could use it to repair what they'd lost. They obviously meant something to each other. They could at least relearn how to be friends.
Then he realized he despised himself with every ounce of his being for doing that, so he deliberately let the stupid thing slide to the floor.
kept ringing in his ears during Stark's lecture e made himself sit through. And he couldn't but notice how Stark's voice kept breaking with strain towards the end.
After maybe ten minutes of an inevitable discussion of scientific methods, validity and who's a bigger jerk, he strapped Tony into a piece of his own equipment, and after some more squabbling and several hours of uneasy sleep (because by this point Tony could pretty much fall asleep anywhere, anytime, he was so tired, but staying asleep was a wholly different matter), they had a set of results.
The woman standing behind them in line giggles. She was at the airport. She was on the plane. She is
– and he craved more of Steve’s body, and clothing was in the way, and... and he must have been muttering some of it into the kisses, because he heard Steve say: “Okay... all right...” (It sounded very near and very, very far away at the same time).
"And I'll owe you a solid," Tony finished before it fully registered with him what Steve had said. Then, "You'll do it?"
into custody, that would be fabulous." And then he pointed at the place where the one they called Grizzly had knelt until very recently. Now he was sprawled on the ground, with a trickle of blood down his temple, his hand still clutching the gun. Tony looked back at Steve, whose eyebrow twitched in response.

Tony: No, wait, can I change my reply? Here: It gets restocked automatically. I didn't cancel the order in time. I just found them sitting there in the kitchen. Screw you.
"Want me to put some more wood on the fire?" Steve asked. The flames looked vigorous enough to Tony. When he'd come here, that morning, it was ice-cold in the house and it smelled of agedness and dust. Fire smelled new.
Cap started towards him, looking as if he wanted to say something. Crowd parted for him almost by default. He gave Tony a perfectly serious, perfectly straightforward once over – so serious and straightforward, actually, Tony thought, that it must have been an act. It was illegal, of course, to brew spirits, let alone sell or buy them. Still, if you did it off duty, officers looked the other way. That was the reason they didn't come here in the first place. Easier to ignore the practice that way, and people needed the booze in order to let off some steam. But if Cap wanted to push it, he could get Tony disciplined for being here, of course. Tony was becoming too aware of the drink in his hand, so he gave a defiant shrug and downed it. It was his third cup.
The room is sealed, by magic or an alien technology Tony cannot fathom, at least not from the inside. There are no windows, no vents, no secret passages that they can find. If Tony had his suit on, maybe he could, but it malfunctioned earlier and he had to leave it behind. The walls are solid, the door unbreakable. They try repeatedly, but the truth is, they are stranded inside.
"Well, the beard's sure new," Tony managed, in his best casual voice, because changing the topic to something nonsensical seemed like a stellar idea right then.
Overall, if they could get any help, that would be good, but there was no time to focus on that. He needed to go on. For all Steve knew, life support could give out at any moment. The important thing was to get to the landing bay. He 'd find the techs on shift there, if they were alive. He suspected he'd find Darryl there as well, which was precisely why he'd sent Thor the other way; if something irrevocable had actually happened, Thor could live without seeing it first-hand; he'd lost too many close friends lately.
Now that he had a moment to look at it, Tony could say the dog was too large for a husky. It was probably a mixed breed. Despite its size, it definitely had a doggy build – broad hips, powerful shoulders, and it wasn't lithe like a wolf. Still, in the darkness and the blizzard it was an easy mistake to make. No, really, sprawled in front of Tony's fire the beast looked humongous;
"I see it!" he yells into the phone in order to be heard over the din. No intro is needed. The masonry is raining down, and everyone is running in the opposite direction from Steve. Of course he knows why Tony is calling.
He sat there, very still, absently toying with my fingers . He eventually said: "I couldn't figure out what you wanted."
Steve hesitated for a moment. Tony could have sworn the man was staring intently at his lips. But Steve tore his gaze away, shook it off, whatever it was, and pointed to his left. “There.”
Steve doesn't know why, but the idea of Tony walking away from him again is the worst thing he can imagine. To the Captain's surprise, Tony sits down in one of the chairs, hands out gesturing for Steve to sit across from him.
He closes his eyes and waits for the oxygen to run out, not wanting Bucky to have to see the light drain from his eyes when it does. But it never happens. Bucky's hand falls limp from Tony's neck and the younger man eagerly gasps for as much air as he can get.
"You did this to us!" Bucky yells knocking Tony hardest against the wall in the process. "You created the serum! Steve just wanted to be normal! I wanted to be normal!"
Steve finds Tony's surprise completely adorable, appreciating the way his eyebrows scrunch together and his nose crinkles.
"I'm so sorry," Bucky mumbles, never breaking eye contact with the brunette situated above him. "I've done so many things to hurt you."
"But I think we can expand it to the whole team," the interviewer continues making Tony pout. "Loraine from Colorado is wondering if any of you are seeing someone special?"
"Poison?" Tony exclaims, heart pounding painfully when he sees the purple-black color that surrounds the area where Bucky's arm and the metal usually meet. "From HYDRA? How did S.H.I.E.L.D. not catch that? Shouldn't your version of the serum be fighting that?"
Neither Steve nor Tony move to sit down, avoiding eye contact altogether. Of course this is something the team would do, especially Clint. Not only are they fed up with their fighting, but they love to pull a good prank especially at Steve and Tony's expense.
"Okay, clearly we're missing something here," the interviewer shakes her head. "Who are the two lucky people getting to date Iron Man and Captain America?"
"T-Tony?" Bucky groans, falling into a coughing fit as soon as he says a word. Blood splatters onto his hands and shirt making Tony cringe.
Another fit of coughing causes Tony to sit on the couch with Bucky practically laying on him as he attempts to pat the sweat away with a wet washcloth. Tony whispers reassurances in Bucky's ear, things he has no right to say and things that certainly may not be true. Things like it's okay, you'll be fine, there's a cure.
"I believe that Stark and the Captain have traces of unresolved... tension," Thor tries to find the right word, but the rest of the team furiously nod their heads in agreement.
"Chill, Cap," Clint claps the taller blonde on his back, a signature grin on his lips. "You look good and everyone already loves you, you'll be fine."
"Well you would know," Tony shakes his head, a bitter smile on his lips. He's hidden the pain again with a new, careless mask, but Steve knows it's there. "You were his favorite son, after all."
"Yeah," Bucky forces a smile onto his lips for Tony's sake. "I guess we do have a bit of an understanding."
"Thanks," Steve says honestly, gaining a little confidence. "And to answer your previous question: yes, I am seeing someone."
"You should have met me in the 1930s," Bucky smiles softly, remembering how he was back then. "You would have liked me then."
"I mean I'm not a good person. I've done things, hurt people. Fuck, Tony, I'm still a master assassin for crying out loud," Bucky tries to keep the emotion out of his voice but finds it wavering against his will. "Even Steve can hardly stand the sight of me. So, why are you so nice to me?"
"Well, I'm certainly old enough, aren't I?" Steve challenges, a smirk that makes Tony's heart flip forming on his face.
"Clint is an idiot and I don't know how anyone would date him," she smirks and Clint feigns hurt even though the humor is clear in his eyes.
But see, that's the problem. Steve doesn't want to answer any questions or talk to any people; he would prefer it if he could just watch the rest of the team do the interview from the comfort of the couch in Avengers Tower.
"And what about you, Mr. Captain America?" The interviewer turns to Steve who is still absorbed in his drawings on Tony's hand.
Steve looks between Bucky and Bruce with a conflicted frown, only pausing when his eyes find the warm, brown ones of Tony.
A few days later, Bruce manages to get Tony out of the lab to go to a "team dinner." Bruce had been the only one allowed in the lab and even then, Tony remained relatively silent. Needless to say, he wasn't too thrilled about being dragged away from his work, or forced to interact with Steve for that matter.
"Steve, just let Tony do the talking," Bruce shakes his head in disbelief. The dude is Captain America and he's scared of an interview? "If you don't want to talk, you don't have to."
"I know, I know," Steve concedes and stands up, walking over to Tony and wrapping his arms around the shorter man's waist. "But are you sure you can't stay awhile longer?"
"Steve, I love you, but if you don't calm down you're going to make me pass out," Tony shakes his head with a small smirk on his lips, pressing a quick kiss to his boyfriend's cheek as he walks by.
The pair had lost track of time, both having finished their meal more than an hour ago. The night has only confirmed everything Tony had already thought about Steve: he's wonderfully moral, kind and protective. However, Tony never let himself see through the Captain America part; Steve is actually quite insecure which Tony finds absurd.
"Bucky?" When Tony hears a mumbled response he rushes over to the older man's side, eyes widening considerably when he sees Bucky's pained expression. "James, what's wrong? Are you alright?"
The blonde smiles triumphantly as Tony fights a smile on his own lips. Maybe this night won't be as bad as they both thought.
"Where are we going?" Tony asks innocently which Steve knows to be fake as he rolls his eyes, snaking a perfectly toned arm around Tony's waist.
"Excuse me, can we please get two scotches on the rocks," Steve flashes a white-toothed smile at a waitress walking by, making the girl's cheeks blush bright-pink as she manages a shaky nod.
"They'll probably ask the normal, boring stuff," Nat adds with a rare genuine smile. "Like how does it feel to save the world? What would you say to your fans? That kind of stuff."
"Uhm, I'm sorry, miss. There must be a mistake," Steve rubs the back of his neck awkwardly, trying to be as polite as possible as Tony gapes open-mouthed at the small table for two in the back of the restaurant.
"True," Nat nods with a smirk. "The person Tony is dating is much worse than the person Steve's dating."
"No, he's serious," Tony smiles— a genuine smile that he only shares with the team and Steve usually. "And he's quite good. Here, zoom in on this." Tony holds up his hand proudly for the cameras revealing a mini Captain America suit, Tony's arc reactor, Clint's bow and arrows and a half-completed Mjolnir etched on his skin.
"What's going on?" Banner asks in concern meeting Tony by a table full of syringes and dozens of holographs.
The second Tony lays eyes on the older man, he wants to curse the thoughts that cross his mind. Somehow, Steve manages to make a simple white t-shirt and blue suede jacket look so damn good. The second Steve's eyes meet his, Tony turns his head away.
And even though Tony has learned to hate his father his whole life, he's never hated Howard more than he does in this very moment. He wants to comfort Bucky, to take him into his arms and tell him it's okay, that Howard was an ass and ruined everything he touched, but Tony can't even get air into his lungs, much less form a coherent sentence.
There's a beat of silence between the two before Steve's eyes glow dark blue with mischief and he stands up, Tony instantly mirroring his actions.
Tony's grip on his tool slackens and he tries to fight off the wave of color that's surely attacking his face.
"What about you, Tony?" The interviewer turns to the billionaire with a smile. "What do you think of Steve's significant other?"
"Okay, but seriously, is Steve mad that Tony won't hang out with us or him?" Bruce looks away from the video game for a split second, trying to gauge everyone else's feelings on the subject.
Tony doesn't know what comes over him or what possesses him to make his next move. He doesn't love Bucky, no. He belongs to Steve in every sense of the word. Surely it's because Bucky is dying on the couch next to him and because he just admitted that he loves Tony. But Tony does feel something for the former Winter Soldier, something more than casual conversations in the lab and side glances in the kitchen. And maybe if he would have met Bucky first then things would've been different.
He leaves the kitchen with his head down, going straight to his bedroom and ignoring the eyes of the rest of the team.
"See, that wasn't so bad, was it?" Tony squeezes Steve's hand and presses a soft kiss to the taller man's cheek as soon as they're off stage.
On that note, Tony walks away, retreating to the lab where he plans to lock himself for a few days. He knew Steve hated him, but he never realized how much until tonight. What hurts even more is that he knows Steve is right-- Tony isn't and won't ever be half the man he is.
At this point, Steve is a bit of a nervous wreck. He has to fight to keep his leg from bouncing up and down, opting to rapidly drum his fingers on his thighs instead.
"Because you and I have something, Buck," Tony shrugs carelessly, his response bringing Bucky out of his thoughts as he stares at the brunette curiously. "We get each other. We have an understanding. You're Steve's best friend and that means something to me."
"You're seriously going to drink with me, Rogers?" Tony raises his eyebrows in surprise, completely taken aback by Steve's request. He's not sure he's ever even seen the Captain touch alcohol, let alone drink it.
"JARVIS, run a full body scan," Tony orders with a shaky breath already going to work on removing the Stark Industries arm from Bucky's flesh.
"Oh, that.." Bruce trails off sheepishly. "I work in the lab a lot though Tony constantly tries to aggravate me." This earns a wink from Tony and laughter from the audience. "But I'm usually good. Nat actually keeps the rest of us in place so even if things get out of hand, she shoots us down."
"That I'm dating Tony Stark, yes," Steve finishes for the interviewer, allowing Tony to happily intertwine their hands.
The two brothers loved each other dearly but fought over the simplest things. Unfortunately, men and women happened to be one of them. It all started with a joint crush on a very beautiful, very unique woman named Peggy. Bucky had loved her first, naturally, as Steve wasn't always the super-soldier he ended up being, but at the end of the day, Peggy chose Steve.
Steve shivers violently. A wave of pleasure rushes to his cock, on the verge of enveloping him whole, but it subsides before it gets there. He throws his head back in frustration.
Steve picked that moment to look up at him with something in his eyes that, in someone else, would have been bordering on panic.
, though," he said, getting back to the previous conversation. "So, you can't blame me for misunderstanding."
"You're a pretty fast reader," he commented casually, turning back to the book. "I thought I was going to have to wait for you for ages to turn a page, but you're actually not bad at all."
Before he could think about what he was doing, he bent down and pressed his lips softly to Tony's forehead. It was almost like someone else was doing it. But as he lingered there for a second, his lips against Tony's warm skin, a wave of thrill shook him. He stepped back quickly, flushed, opened his mouth to say something, to apologize.
Tony: And we can learn to talk. I mean, I learned to water-ski when I was 32. I can learn this too. It’s not rocket science.
They stared at each other in silence. Still, Steve was painfully aware  that, unless he said something very soon, Tony would go. This time it may really be forever, this time he might never see him again. Tony had come all this way to help him win his battle. Now it was Steve's turn.
Tony: He's alive. He's all right. I made him braces for walking. So don't with the sorries, just don't.
Tony pretends he's dozing off, head on Steve's shoulder. He fervently hopes he's making him profoundly uncomfortable.
Steve opened his mouth, then seemingly changed his mind about what he was going to say. Just: “Occasionally.”
Her hand is ruined, just like Bruce's, but Steve has a feeling that, with time, they will both heal, and the same goes for the rest of the world.
? It must be some in-joke, some private teasing. To his well tuned ears, there were a few strands of something forced in the merriment, and he knew how to read that too: is the laughter at our expense? Are the superheroes mocking us? Is this funny or rude? (If the audience pretended it was funny, they didn't have to deal with rude.)
"If everything is in order over there, round up some people, have them put the suits on and send them over to help out," Steve told him as the man hurried off. "Send someone up to inform the bridge of what's going on as soon as you can."
As Tony's back disappeared into the right hand corridor, Steve promptly put the helmet back on (well, it was a sensible thing to do). He checked if the comm was working. Mostly white noise, and then quiet but distinct muttering.
Steve was stumped for words. He didn't know how else to tell Tony the simple truth, so in the end he opted for honesty. "I couldn't get through to you. I got worried."
. Or... Well, that wasn't quite fair. Tony's behavior was nothing if not friendly, and that kept a part of Steve on edge. It was as if he kept waiting for something bad to happen, just because this was too good to be true.
Steve shrugged one shoulder minuscully. "I'd rather have you do it than the medic." A small smile was playing around his lips, and it had to be the painkiller, it just had to be. If Tony thought those soft looks were coming from  Steve himself, he might have kissed him on the spot, everything be damned.
Tony: You mean, if the people are mostly decent, and won’t physically betray you and such, it’s easier to be friends when you are desperately fighting a common enemy. You have a common cause. Nothing disputable there.
"That's another thing I need to talk to you about. Look... this is the part where I say 'You ever heard of the multiverse', and you shake your head, yeah? And then I say 'Wow, I'm too drunk for this', although, in all seriousness, I'm really not."
"I gotta see if Darryl's okay." Thor sounded breathless. Steve nodded. Tony fought off a stab of untimely jealousy, because his own reasons for wanting to go down were so much better and so much less purely personal than Thor's.
