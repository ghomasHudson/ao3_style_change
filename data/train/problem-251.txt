He opened the door and stood there in the early morning light, then turned away again. I got up and moved behind him, pulling him tight to my chest, bending my head down over his shoulder, left hand on his scar, right hand on his heart.
“Mycroft—I don’t know what your definition of surveillance is, or how you select the people you hire to do it. But it does your agency no credit whatsoever.”
He managed to make that sound rather suggestive, and I imagined doing what we had done last night up here, on the terrace, in the open air. The thought was alarming, not arousing at all. Whatever else I was going to discover about myself as a sexual person, it was unlikely to be that I like to be observed during the act. John would say that anyone who goes about wrapped in a sheet is an exhibitionist, but for all his vaunted “emotional intelligence” John can be simplistic about human personalities. (Stop. Go away, John.)
We were the focus of a great deal more attention than I was accustomed to in London. This was in part because Italians have no scruples about overtly inspecting each other, and in part also because we looked like something of a matched set. Roberto was insistent about touching my hand, my arm, my elbow, my shoulder, the small of my back, and once, as he backed me up against a pillar, my cock.
“No, actually. No one deserves what he was about to do.”
“That’s enough for me, then. She does seem ... exceptional. That
“You don’t need ... backup?” He looks ill at ease. But he hates dance clubs, and John in places and situations he hates is not honestly much help.
John takes a few minutes after his dance with Donovan, less to catch his breath than to order his thoughts about what she’d said.
Bees. By all means, let’s pick up the pace.” John tugged his arm and turned from admiring the glistening bay.
The image stayed with him: Roberto’s lean figure gliding into the light and out again, kinetic and graceful, expression intent, capably gripping a handgun angled toward the floor. His clothes blue-black in the watery light of the warehouse on the docks. “Dead sexy.” Sherlock was beginning to agree.
“Ash. You’re not the first married person to have a fling, and I promise you won’t be the last. It happened, it’s a shame, you’re sorry, and it’s over. You can both move past it.”
Sherlock is detained on his way over by a hand on his arm, a starry-eyed bearded man with a rather glaring wardrobe error Sherlock seems to be vigorously shaking his head “no” to. John gives a secret grin at the thought that Sherlock would dance with anyone wearing a floral Ascot with a tux, then shakes himself—he might be mocking another unexpectedly accomplished dancer. There's no way to find out, as Sherlock shakes his head again firmly, nods in John’s direction, and nearly bows in his haste to get away.
I made a list. Couldn’t remember anything without writing it down. Hid the list in a folder I labeled “RAMC files.”
Chapter title is from a traditional ballad; the last line of the chapter is from Paul Simon, "Further to Fly."
This wasn’t cleansing or cathartic; this was dangerous. I’d wanted John to see that this was my fault, all of it; instead John was convincing himself that it was
I didn’t answer, and that was answer enough.
Walking, and talking. Silence, and sleep. There was something about Sherlock’s mere proximity—there always had been. A magnetic tug that gathered everything around him into orbiting satellites, John among the rest. He’d always thought it was surface allure: cosmetic features like verbal virtuosity and intensity and speed, charisma and sheer physical beauty, class and accent and clothing. The sum of these things had always dominated John’s reactions to Sherlock’s appeal.
Burning beneath the blue steeples of the larkspur,
The doorbell was ringing when I finished, but had stopped by the time I shrugged into a bathrobe and pulled the door open. No one was there, but a floral delivery the size of a very large dog was sitting in the corridor. It couldn’t be—
John wasn’t with him in Baker Street, of course, and couldn’t be available for cases had there been any. He had a job to do, a child to bring up. But he brought Watson round, some afternoons, and then Sherlock could take the perfect little armful from John and walk her round the flat, telling her detailed stories about this or that object, lowering his voice so John could relax in his chair, close his eyes for fifteen or twenty minutes. The drone of Sherlock’s voice seemed to soothe both his guests, so he kept it thrumming at low volume, murmuring to Watson about bats, and belfries, and books, and Bluebell the bunny, and bees, concentrating on getting consonants and words into her head, thinking that one day he’d have her say them back to him until she grew bored.
The words are tumbling out, now, and John’s steady left hand is still trapping Sherlock’s, his voice low but intense. Sherlock is staring at Rosie asleep on the floor, his face impassive as he listens, neither reacting nor disengaging. John slides his right hand up to grip Sherlock’s arm above the elbow.
Dear God, John. Stop looking inside me. Stop looking. Stop.
Six songs, then, six mournful goodbyes set to music; regrets (
“What—um,” he got out, before his voice cracked. “What—um, do you think Sherlock—” He stopped there.
By the time I got them back to 221B, I knew it was a terrible idea. They always say a puppy is not a Christmas present. A puppy is not a good thing to surprise someone with. And two puppies are three times as annoying as one, as everyone riding the tube with us that night can attest.

“Perhaps his survival is also his penance. To be responsible for so much loss and sorrow would surely be enough to make a man hate his own life.”
“Bless you for sparing me the dinosaur socks.”
Finally the glass doors opened for John, and his smile when he saw Sherlock blazed so brightly that playing it cool was his absolute last priority. John’s either, apparently. He strode over, set down his cases, and pulled Sherlock into a bone-cracking hug.
Something was hovering at the outer limit of his attention, but he couldn’t put his finger on what it was. Ash was directing quizzical glances his way—what was that about? What was he missing?
All I had to do was stand by his side, which was always my honour and privilege; look proud; and admire his way of answering a question with a bland insult which landed on his interlocutor but took some time to fully sink in. If Kitty Riley was there, though, I’d be hard put to it to keep a leash on my temper.
And he leaned close and kissed me (oh the taste of him, so sweet), nudging my face up to meet his eyes.
It was still two months out when Holmes told me that Watson was doing some of the dance lessons. His face went soft when he said it.
I knew who that was, and I didn’t want him in the room tonight. Maybe some other year. Some other decade. I'd be ready to learn more about James Sholto’s hold on John’s heart, when I could be more confident about my own.
“Why were you there?”
— Enormously. Painfully. JW
221B took on a school-centered routine; Sherlock took on more cases, and I at least saw more of Sami, who by now spoke almost exclusively French with Rosie. He was a gentle young man, studying speech therapy as a profession and well up on related fields like linguistics, anatomy, and psychology. Sherlock trusted him, and so did Rosie, so I did too.
He’d pounce on the title, connect it back to the Blind Banker case. He wouldn’t try to use the actual London A–Z, of course. He wouldn’t have much to go on at first, but it wouldn’t take him long to figure out that the date identified a line number.
“Even pre-emptively, Doctor Watson?” Mycroft calls me that to get under my skin, the bastard.
These words, seemingly an afterthought, occupied and consoled John for hours. Only toward dawn did he remember that Sherlock hadn’t asked about Mary.
Is “perfectly certain” sophistry?
The others present I didn’t register as thoroughly; I was almost certain I remembered to greet them all, and said their names (John’s training). But if I hadn’t, I’d make it up to them later, at the flat. I was getting a bit nervous, glancing at my watch and wondering if John would call everyone to order.

Sherlock still looks and sounds nervous, as though he’s trying to thank John for a reaction John couldn’t conceal if he tried.
“I brought you here because you said I wanted Rosie in school so she wouldn’t grow up like you. Or something like that. And it showed me that we were so far from understanding each other that we needed a seriously focused talk. No distractions.”
Fair enough. When I was dating I didn’t announce it to him, either. Never needed to, for that matter. He’d always beat me to it. “Date shirt, I see.” “For pity’s sake, John, with
He can feel two sheets in the envelope, no more. One cover sheet, single-sided. One inside sheet. He lifts the envelope to his nose: Mycroft’s signature cologne, the smell of the Diogenes Club furniture polish, a faint whiff of a menthol cigarette. But something else, too. Something fresh, green.

He went on, “You’ll spend two more days here, under the radar. Then we’ll spring the trap.”
Well, at least I had a new word to apply to Sherlock, and could mentally dodge “death” and “suicide.” It was the Incident, now.
We got back to 221B well after 1 a.m., and Sherlock was knackered. We both were, but I was also jittery, far too wound up to consider going to bed. The flat was dark, and Rosie was sleeping downstairs with Mrs H and the nanny, and I was going to take advantage of the privacy to start a conversation. It might not go well, but it seemed urgent and, in a way, hopeful.

When I jumped off the roof of Barts it was precisely because I couldn’t conceive of living in a world that no longer contained you. I didn’t stop to think that inflicting on you a pain that I myself couldn’t endure was a proof of selfishness, not of love; but I honestly never imagined that you would grieve as you did.
Ashford-Warrington (how to think of the man? The surname alone was a mouthful) looked engagingly earnest and entirely unaware that his proposal was appalling. Systematising a set of course materials for spotty undergraduates would be bad enough; he remembered all too well that they weren’t really there for the education. But delivering such materials in real time, in either lecture or seminar form—he could not repress a shudder.
I could’ve just asked him. “Where d’you go, the evenings you go out? What do you do? Who with?”
Sherlock’s been dreaming of this, fantasising about this, scheming for this for literal years, and at last, at long last, it’s happening. John betrays no anxiety, no second thoughts. Quite the contrary. In the half-dark his smile is all but predatory, his skin is gleaming, and eventually Sherlock remembers that he can touch John too.
“Wrap presents in those totally gay colours.”

Her reassurance irked John. He found it officious: he and Sherlock needed no intermediaries, thank you very much, Mary. But that was unfair, and he kept it to himself. She was being kinder than either of them deserved
The dog hadn't finished spreading his good cheer. He was a one-man dog but had curiosity to spare. The young man kept his eye on him lest he annoy anyone, but the dog had the discretion to insist only with the passengers who were receptive.
Only sometimes he did think:
Maybe I’m not supposed to reason it out, though. Maybe I’m supposed to listen. Listen to John and not talk over him, or talk down to him. But how can I listen if he won’t talk?
Passed through four decryptions, it read
Sherlock has clearly planned this evening down to the last detail, and what he hasn’t planned he’s predicted. “The way you changed my life: no, no, they can’t take away from me.” The key modulates and Louis Armstrong’s growly rasp gives a different tenor to the whole song: if he and Sherlock don’t have a proper conversation after

“Don’t show me anything more. He—deserves his privacy.”
He’d kept making his oblique blog posts from the road on the very slim chance that his quarry might be reading them. He’d disabled the comments to keep himself from looking obsessively for a response, from Sherlock or anyone else.
That made me gasp. I knew Sherlock was thinking of himself standing on the roof at Barts, his phone to his ear, uncertain that he actually would survive that desperate jump or the undercover life that came after; he was thinking of me after his “death,” bereft of him and blaming myself; he was thinking of Will, of Heather, of what he could possibly say to a man who had lost his wife to such grisly violence.
“Welcome back, brother mine. Interesting choice of coiffure. Are you really going to keep it?”
Sherlock is a magnificent liar, always has been. An escaped serial killer who targeted children—had to be an eight at least. Although we’d promised not to lie to each other and this was a whopper, all I could do was press my lips together and try not to let him see my smile.
“Go over what you recall of the conversation, and I’ll ask clarifying questions if necessary.”
— You taught me to care. SH
Assuming it was him, he was confirming what I had hesitantly, hopefully extrapolated from my series of unsatisfactory enquiries.
“Dodgy? How, pray tell?”
“Because this is where we came together. Where we told each other everything. Made love. Made promises. And if you’re going to leave me, this is where you’re going to do it. In this city. In this bed.”
Lestrade had called Mycroft even before calling Interpol, and Sherlock had been summoned to NSY to brief the team of officers assigned to the suddenly-expanded investigation. High stakes, top secret. Ridiculous to insist on a real-time briefing—but he didn’t have that much on, and the cab was practically waiting for him in front of 221B, so he might as well.
The laughter that arose sounded like complicity, not derision. His life
John never noticed; it was his turn to be comatose but he fought it. He took Sherlock’s hand and pulled him up close, muttering “Oh, love, oh, fuck, I’ve never... I never even imagined, you are... amazing, brilliant, fantastic,” and Sherlock’s neural circuits lit up with memory, oh
did you try to tell me? Besides when it was too late, I mean, at the wedding.” I rake my fingernail along his backbone and his shiver is gratifying.
“This. What is this?”
The sensation electrified John, who found his hands running up and down Sherlock’s back and arse, grasping and clutching as he kissed Sherlock’s mouth, tasting his breath, licking and sucking his lips and tongue. This had never felt so good, never with
Moriarty’s vicious crime cartels one by one. Probably without anyone beside him who could shoot his way out of a wet paper bag.

Then there were the boots. It had cost him a pang to discard the coat again, and he missed it in the harsh winter, but it was far too distinctive for his new identity and far too smart. So he’d attached himself to the boots, instead. They were custom-made for his unusually long and narrow feet; the cuffs came up well above the ankles.
“Oh? You didn’t mention it.” It wasn’t like Sherlock to play engagements close to the chest.
My voice is relaxed now, confident, though almost wheedling. A beat. Another. Then it’s obvious from the relaxation of tension that I’ve won him over. He opens his arms, waits while I move into them and lie back against him. We’ll be fine. I have to control this. I have to learn not to punish him, or myself, for what I regret. I have to.
“Quite a lot, but so far only on a theoretical level.”
“Unhand me in half an hour, then. Do your worst. I can take it.”
At first, Mary was a great help. For her part, she’d perfected the art of patching up a battered John Watson and bringing him back to life. Week after week she consoled him, made him buck up, started a list of action items with him, helped him map a possible itinerary for visiting the places Mycroft had said were most meaningful on Sherlock’s mental map. Places he’d been during his absence, but also places from their childhood, from his stormy years at uni. John added a couple of locales that Sherlock had eyed with interest in Bond films or travel programmes.

He groans. And just like that we’ve gone from cold and weary and lost to rock-hard and intent. I’m touching him lightly, just brushing my fingertips against his cock, his bollocks, as he pushes his arse back against my groin, then thrusts his hand back between us to grip me hard. I bend my head to kiss his ear, his cheek, his lips, and when we shift in the shower to angle the water to our other, still-icy sides, we’re face-to-face and kissing hungrily. For a warm-up shower this is proving a spectacular success.

I put on my haughtiest and most impenetrable stare, which made it all the more disconcerting when John laughed and said, “Nice try. Won’t work on me, though.”
But now he wants me to leave him alone. His voice was icily quiet when he told me to do so, in fact. He stomped upstairs in a towering rage and gritted out “Don’t even think about it, Sherlock,” when I turned toward the stairs to follow him. That... hurt. I’d hoped that when we were back here, after everything we’d been through, we’d be done with sleeping apart. But when I thought about going upstairs anyway—I stopped. Thought for a moment. Can I
So I just said: “I don’t know how people stand it, Sherlock. I wasn’t able to. But you need to know that I love you, that keeping away from you was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I’ll never be able to apologise enough for it.”
He wished he’d invited them to come to his parents' home for the day after all. He’d supposed it would be too vivid a reminder of another Christmas, with Watson and no Mary. No Magnussen either, which had to count in the positive column. But still: an immense hole in John and Watson’s life that no Sherlock Holmes could ever fill.
he could swear he'd felt John’s tortured bliss in his own body, at the cellular level. When John had recovered himself a bit, returned to himself, he’d turned to Sherlock with a look of clear intent. Hauled him up by his shoulders, literally lifted him to lay him down and pay him in the same unhurried, electrifying coin.

Life without a mobile is ... different. If a piece of information is missing, Sherlock looks it up in a book or lets it go. This is not an option he’s accustomed to, but it doesn’t feel like a deprivation;  it feels like a choice. The information he was constantly feeding into his brain: is it fuel for a fire? Would suspending it make the fire burn out? Or would it burn hotter for being smaller? (Is the analogy useful at all? Not scientific, so probably not.)

“I’m sorry, sorry, I’ll tell you about it later, for now just let me look at you. —No, never mind, kiss me again.” Minutes go by and Sherlock can hear the next fast train coming into the station beneath them, a cacophony of whistle and brakes and echoing loudspeaker announcements. Still they stand there suspended over the station, as though being together will not survive coming back to earth, leaving this bubble and going—

His obvious admiration was flattering, if nothing else. Initially Sherlock hadn’t been particularly stirred, though Roberto was certainly the closest thing he’d seen to a potential romantic partner since he’d started ... looking. But the evening at the French restaurant had been appealing—both comfortable and intriguing. A straightforward declaration of interest. —No, of infatuation. An invitation to Rome. A proposition that seemed urgent yet unselfish: to take his time, to wait and see.
He made the offer warmly, if not quite sincerely. He was hoping rather desperately to be invited back to the little house that Aislinn had said “Scotty” lived in.
— Where do you get these lurid notions? SH
I fell for it, of course. My ego was flattened along with my heart. I thought if I ever gave Sherlock a chance to hurt me again, it’d kill me. Mary was part of my armour against him, against my own stubborn longing to be close to him again; and when I walked back into Sherlock’s flat to work the Magnussen case with him, she shot him. Not to protect herself from exposure—not really. To protect herself from losing me to him.
“Trust you to know about accents. Is it harder to understand?” There was no denying it: I’d always loved to impress John.

he’d said. —When, exactly? He’d have to find a way to tell me. But I knew I’d be going back to Barts.
“Well, that’d be no lie.” Sherlock was doing the same.
But the revelation that he had been cleared and vindicated had been coordinated among various government offices, including the Met, with carefully curated press releases. And now a media “appearance” was scheduled for 2 p.m. at the very door of Baker Street, to reveal that he was not, after all, dead.
I was right.
The day dragged excruciatingly, like slogging through treacle. I couldn’t concentrate enough to start a new experiment, and there was nothing case-related to take my mind off the bizarre case of John. I knew he loved me. He knew it, too. But waiting outside his closet door for him to figure out that he wouldn’t explode if he walked out of it—that was getting me absolutely nowhere.
If Sherlock had been an option I’d have been thrilled, but I was still far from certain that he was completely clean. Whether he was or not, he’d been back at work for weeks now—back to a life of unscheduled time, bouncing unpredictably between crisis and tedium, reflection and furious activity. No room for a baby in that, even if he’d offered.
“Good, darling. We miss you. Say hello to—the Zanardis for us.”
Before I’ve finished speaking he’s thrust his hand down to his cock and begun to stroke. Too hard, too fast. I grab his hand. “Slow down. Ease up. We’re taking our time, tonight.”
After that I spent a week gritting my teeth and wondering every minute what John would make of that, how he would reply.

But the song was ... the song was

Whether he was alive or not, I was going to talk to him. Reach out to him. Systematically. The same time, same venue, regular schedule. From John, to an absent friend. Not just every four weeks, either: every second Sunday, 6 p.m. He would figure out I was leaving him a Sunday to answer. He was a very clever man, after all.

not-good, this was engaging in unauthorised sexual fantasies in the very presence of the—fantasee?—who had suddenly come to life and was staring at him in sharp perplexity.
On the one hand I had my work, with the real consequences of the joint operation successfully concluded in London: new leads at this end, criminal trials pending or in progress to modify with new evidence. New work teams to form and train, which always required more diplomacy than the U.N. Endless paperwork: forms, reports, requests. If I’d stayed at work fourteen hours a day it wouldn’t have been enough, so I didn’t.
This wasn’t the reunion of a love story or a spy thriller with a romantic side-plot, all gold lighting and soft focus and violins swelling in the film score. It was the return of a man who had never hesitated to do a full-body dive into a skip in search of evidence, and thought nothing of contaminating a refrigerator with severed body parts.
The next morning, as we breakfasted in the hotel, along with the coffee and crêpes our waiter brought a business card which he held out to John. “From a gentleman in reception.”
I suited him. He could not only endure my company but enjoy it. I almost never set his teeth on edge as so many other people did. It helped him think, talking things through with me. He trusted me, let me see him in the deepest confusion, without the mask of infallibility that he used to protect himself from the world. And he was faithful to his choices. He never varied in his clothing, his hair rituals, his eating habits, his patterns (that only seemed patternless). So there was that.
“Just let me know when to expect you. We can pick you up wherever you’re arriving, or you can come straight to Baker Street, whichever you like.” The warmth in his tone was unfeigned; he hadn’t let himself realise how much he missed her company, until it was imminent.

The door closes and Sherlock’s back hits the wall again, both impacts making a bit more noise than John would’ve liked, but needs must, he supposes. His hands land on Sherlock’s waist to steady them both, but he doesn’t squander the chance to explore, down Sherlock’s hips and back to his arse, just as lush as he’s always suspected. Pulling Sherlock to himself John whispers “Take it off, take it off, take it
John brought in mugs of herbal tea and muttered something wistful about single malt, but didn’t sound discontented. They settled in on the sofa, where Sherlock had no intention of letting John sleep that night or the next. He might never have another chance at this.
“Well, I’m glad you appreciate him more now. And I’m glad you can dance with him. That was quite a show you put on, earlier. But don’t think you're going to be his partner anywhere but on the dance floor. Find your own genius to solve crimes with.”
John was there, encouraging, running interference, occasionally consoling even before Sherlock knew he needed solace. And it was John—conductor of light—who put together two entirely unrelated pieces of data and asked,
John’s eyes nearly start from his head, and I have to turn away to conceal the smile. He doesn’t know what to think when I wrong-foot him like this.

It promised to be the very opposite of
“’Your eyes in stars above’”—John continues, and Sherlock knows,
“Oh, you wish.”
Sherlock’s voice came tight and low, but happy, in John’s ear, pressed to Sherlock’s back. “I don’t know how I’m meant to sleep in this state. I feel far too... much, to sleep.”
Everything seemed very near the surface that day, very poignant. Sherlock’s family had forgiven me for so much, and now his father was...
“Asperger’s. That really hurt.” I remember that moment as clearly as if it were yesterday: in Grimpen village. I’d said it to Greg as though it was a clinical fact, as though he and I were part of Sherlock’s care team. I wince in contrition.
I thought it was going perfectly. And then one day John said he wanted to send Watson to school a full year early. So that she would not be—of course he never said this, but I seemed to hear it like a siren—a Freak. And from the time he mentioned it, it wasn’t a proposition to discuss and consider and resolve together; it was a fait accompli. The school was chosen, the Open Day attended, the decision made while I was still reeling at the distrust revealed by both the impulse to send her away from my influence, and the autocratic decision that made it a settled thing.
“I’m glad you meant to call me in. The thought of you escorting a prisoner like that alone makes my blood run cold, and not for the right reasons. Your gun safety protocols are appalling.”
Later Roberto had run his hands and mouth over me again, this time as I lay face down beneath him. By then the room was dark, and I felt his hands hesitate and return to the places on my back that his fingertips had sensed were marked, damaged. This time I was ready, and let him touch while I focused on his fingers. The doors that led to the places where I had got those marks were firmly closed. No monsters roaring out, no poisonous smoke seeping around the edges. Those doors were secure.

And he was staring. That wasn’t surprising—I was staring, too; Sherlock was especially gorgeous that evening, long-necked, tousle-haired, glass-green-eyed, with a slight flush on his cheekbones that slowly, to my surprise, began to spread over his entire face. Constantine was turned toward us as he played and Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, his languid slouch straightened up, the way he did when suddenly wary or intrigued. I all but ground my teeth. Yes, the man was attractive, but Sherlock could show
“Not even in that way. I’ll never understand it, but you seem to have been made for me. It’s you who must wish me different, not the other way round.”

“I know, Sally. And I appreciate it. I hated you for a long time, you know. Years. And after that—after Sherlock came back—I just resented you."
That was sobering. Dear God, I hoped never to hear any more about Roberto Zanardi ever again, let alone the massive amounts of information I’d asked for and been given back then.
I couldn’t believe my good fortune: after all these years, John Watson was looking down at me with unmasked love. I struggled to find my train of thought again, and asked, slowly,
Just to be sure, I texted Sherlock:

As Roberto speaks he periodically places a hand on Sherlock's leg, forearm, cheek, as though trying to gauge his response—or to placate him? The latter possibility is somewhat unnerving. Placate him for what? If Roberto is bisexual—and he clearly is, it now seems—had he been afraid Sherlock would be less impressed by his own infatuation, and willingness to act on it?
“John, your idea of drawing Miss Morstan here turned out to be inspired. It didn’t leave her or Moran the time to deploy backup around Baker Street; even crime lords don’t keep snipers on standby on the off chance, after all.

And still no deductions. Very … uncharacteristic.
As we walked it hit me that I was never going to be able to work in Italy, never. I was hamstrung by the unbending foreignness of my experience, and by the irrelevance of so much of my knowledge. While I was away, after Barts, I’d lived this partial and unsuccessful immersion in enough places that I should have known that transplanting myself to Rome could never work. I wasn’t myself there, not the world’s only consulting detective, and I never could be.

Once Sherlock had come to in the oily, icy bilge of a cargo ship hold, it had taken him precisely 43 minutes to organize the other eleven men and boys into a ragtag resistance—despite having no language common to all. The plan would have worked, too, but for one generous, confident, daring young man, a boy, really. He’d caught Sherlock’s eye with a conspiratorial glint, tilted his head toward the guard with the gun, and created a diversion that allowed the other captives to jump the man. But not before the guard had slid a knife between the boy’s ribs and into his heart. Sherlock had held the boy up as he died, the light fading from his bright blue eyes, his face and physique and hair so like John’s, what John must’ve looked like twenty years ago.

Sherlock went rigid with surprise, then remembered there was a protocol for this kind of thing. Fighting off  the sensation, the scent, of John, he hugged back, then patted John gingerly on the shoulder.
Lover: the word is complex, and I’m not sure it will ever apply to him or to me.  He called me things in the night that I was not ready for. He did it again in the morning, when he woke up. Talking about names worked like a screen for the discomfort of finding myself in his bed in a flat I don’t even know.
Fully three days later—Friday afternoon—we spun to a stop, took a look at each other and our watches, blurted “Rosie!” and “Watson!” in unison, and raced for Baker Street. I was covered in blood, fortunately not mine. Still, I didn’t want Rosie to see it, or even smell it.
I thanked Fred with all the earnestness I could spare from the task at hand, which was to get Sherlock cleaned up and comfortable and settled as soon as I could. Fred, bless him, said, “You need a hand here? Would it help if I took Rosie over to mine, let her play with the kids for a couple of hours? They should be back in—fifteen, twenty minutes.”
Ah. Truce over, then. I look away to hide my rueful grin.
In fact, over breakfast John looked sunnier than he had so far. The shadow of thinness and strain that had been so striking that first night had dissipated, replaced by a measure of energy and direction that was new. What was John planning?
, for instance."
With some anticipation I left the taxi and entered the terminal. Roberto was indeed there, looking tense, perhaps uncertain. I did not feel uncertain, nor for that matter tense—just fatigued from two days wrestling with emotions, with words. But I was also determined, and curious about how this meeting and the rest of the evening would proceed. Not to mention the rest of the night.
“Of course not. Well, there’s already too much email in the world, isn’t there? Perhaps I’ll hear from you next year, then.”

He looked grave and said, “You do realise that if you’re right, and she’s been put there on purpose, that represents a substantial investment of resources by the organisation Sherlock has been combating all this while. They must be almost certain he’s alive, if they’ve have placed a spy at your elbow. I will indeed look into her, and inform you when I learn anything.”
Came into the bedroom freshly showered, to find him standing, still dressed, and staring at the framed photographs of us on the wall. Two re-writes, overwrites, of surveillance photos he’d seen showing me and Roberto together, almost four years ago now.
He makes a show of turning off his mobile, then reaches for John’s hand, catches his little finger, and carries it to the seat between them. They’ll be home soon enough.

He’d had little enough on him when he was abducted—nothing more valuable than a fake Australian passport, a cheap low-tech flip phone, and a wallet holding a thin sheaf of business cards, post-its, a few Australian dollars, a tiny photograph of John taken in a booth in 2010, a scrap of paper with some musical notation but no staves. Some stamps, as if he were a tourist who meant to send postcards. An ATM card, also in his assumed name of Joshua Benjamin Travers. A condom. Camouflage only, from a vending machine at a highway rest stop in France.

“I don’t know many small children, John. But I’ve never seen Watson lie, or be markedly manipulative. I probably shouldn’t have encouraged her to keep a secret from you. Even an innocuous birthday secret might be a bad precedent. But the calculated performance that was Mary’s whole life—there’s been no sign of anything like that, I promise you.”
