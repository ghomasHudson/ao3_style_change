“This” John responded, gesturing down to their joined hands, his left cupping over hers and the silver band around his ring finger shining in the hotel lighting
There was a smile in her voice
John knew that feeling all too well
“My personal feelings on the matter are hardly important. Who my sister chooses as her partner is entirely up to her. And you seem as good a candidate as any” he said, his all seeing gaze ranking up and down his figure, and John knew he was stripping apart his life story just as Sherlock was so fond of doing, peeling back layers and leaving him exposed
“Mike’s right! You outta visit more often!”
With that, Sherlock turned, not bothering to pay any mind as she went for the exist, what appeared to everyone as normal and controlled was slightly hurried, her pace quicker than usual
“But I’m the real detective!”
After what felt like an eternity held against the wall for support, she broke away again, running her long fingers through his hair and breathing out “Bed?”
Later that night, when she was shirtless in front of him as he dipped a needle repeatedly into her flesh to close the unattended wounds, she kept her eyes to the floor, unable to look at him, and it was the closest thing to an apology as he was going to get
“Well, you are the father”
The silence that hung through the air was deafening, but Sherlock didn’t seem to notice, just fell quiet and waited for the information to process
“He…” John paused, going over her words again in his mind to make sure he understood correctly “He dumped you because you didn’t want to sleep with him?”
The boiling of the kettle broke his thoughts, and he poured some of the water into a heat pack, making sure the temperature was fine before wrapping it in a thin washcloth
John let out a defeated sigh. It felt like an eternity before he said anything else. He hated himself for even asking Mycroft out of all people but he had no one else.
“You know me all too well, my dear Watson.”
“Ah! Those merciful statues, such a beautiful way to die, don’t you think? You think your dead, you wish to be deceased, but you instead find yourself in a field unknown to you. You could be anywhere, you’re not certain. Heaven, Hell, wherever. You feel dead, but you’re not dead.  You’re in a time distant from your own, alone, and scared. You want to go home, you want to be alive again, but you can’t, and you’re not. Instead you find yourself growing weaker, watching as the wrinkles of age come to your face, not knowing that you’re food to the murderers that put you there. You grow old and die, isolated, helpless. What poetic creatures, the angels are. Don’t you think?”
"Lestrade just sent me a text. We're needed."
John was trying to calm him down as much as possible. He didn’t feel like being at the center of the public’s attention at the moment.
“It does not matter which animal I have designated you as. All that matters is who triumphs, and wins. I could be the cat, and ensnare you in my claws, you little puny thing, or I could be the mouse, and have you chase me all over London until you get distracted or lose me and then I remain unseen. Of course, there are some cases where the cat ends up in a pool of its own blood, while the mouse scurries away joyous over its victory and off to begin the cycle anew.”
John stared at the note through misty eyes. It came to this, he actually had to write himself a reminder to take care of his daughter. Maybe Social Services would do better than him. He looked back over on the bed and saw her sleeping still. She looked more fragile than ever. He placed his fist up to his mouth to stop himself from breaking down. He can't do this for much longer. He isn't as strong as he thought he was.
We both had a reaction to that. Lara shrugged.
John laughed and planted a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek.
“I’m afraid not, Holmes. What did you hear?”
Watson shrugged.
He checked his watch, he was wasting too much time. He looked out of the window and saw Mycroft’s car waiting out front for him. He made his way downstairs. The car ride was solemn, and the only noise was the soft humming of the car’s engine. John would notice the driver look at him through the mirror, and looked like he had something to say. John was glad that he didn’t. They pulled up in front of Mycroft’s house, and John was out of the car in an instant. He walked to the front door and knocked. It was Kylie who opened the door, with Mycroft standing behind her.
“We’re just not sure where you fit into the picture. And by that, I mean, disappearing for days on end fighting in the inquisition or watching Marie Antoinette get decapitated, or meeting a real life alien.”
'John!' I heard you shout again, you failed to see me standing in the doorway yet again because you were preoccupied with the towel. I walked over to you and grabbed your hands.
'Of course I listen to you, John. Well, not all the time, but most of the time I do.’
"Shh, hush, John, don't talk."
I’m sorry we didn’t get more time together. I’m sorry that you got sick.
Watson rose back up with that same warm smile and retired to his room, leaving Holmes to his thoughts about their conversation.
Sherlock stopped him.
“I admit I spent a little longer in the shop than ordinary people do. I got distracted a few times along the way and bought somethings for Rosie. Of course, I hadn’t realized just
'Adoption,' I interrupted.
“And that Watson is….your John.”
John removed himself from the door and stepped back to give the person a wide berth so that they could come in. The door swung open. John and Watson both narrowed their eyes so that they could get a better visual on their target. The lamp was utterly useless. With each step the stranger took, John's hand started to clench into a fist, and Watson set his jaw and posed in an intimidating stance.
“Sorry?”
“May as well have.”
I'm updating rn cause NaNoWriMo is going on, and I'm trying to figure out my story while also somehow writing it, it's a very stressful situation..
She stepped forward and placed her hands firmly on his shoulders, holding to keep him from shrugging her off
“I wasn’t worried, Sherlock” he said softly, his fingers tracing down her skin to weave their hands together “I just wanted to feel closer to you. After finding out about Victor…I guess I just realized I don’t know anything about your past, and you knew mine within seconds of meeting me”
He snorted, and she turned towards him, a smirk on her lips
“Obviously” she rolled her eyes, before narrowing her attention to the collection of dust on her fingers
Visual aid! Sherlock's dress(and also her body type, kinda):
“I don’t want him here!” Sherlock spat out, pointing her free hand towards the door and speaking through clenched teeth, her eyebrows furrowing as more and more sweat built on her brow
She bit her bottom lip, pinching the full red flesh between two perfectly white rows of teeth, and John’s eyes immediately dropped to them as planned
“Mycroft has hired a Wedding Planner who will contact us via text should she need any information, which is unlikely seeing as my brother will be providing it” she adjusted her scarf “Really, John, our first case together in over half a year and this is all you have to talk about?”
“Alive” Her response was curt, much more harsh than usual. Her annoyance having reached its peek about an hour ago was ready to be directed at anyone who spoke of anything but work
“This…suits you, you know.”
His cheeks were still flushed, from embarrassment and left over arousal
“Who’s going to watch Junior?”
See but not observe
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tell us about yourself, John” he recognized the voice from the earlier gossip and his lip twitched at an awkward attempt at a fake smile, seeing as how the woman basically called him a midget not even 2 minutes ago, he opened his mouth to start, the usual ‘I’m a doctor’ piece he handed off to anyone who asked, when Sherlock beat him to it
Be sure to check out my
“Was I speaking too quickly for the lot of you?”
It's a lil short
All in all, it seemed Sherlock, though insist on the oddest and most inappropriate locations, was still very careful about others knowing
“Jealousy is not befitting of you”
“W-W-wait, wait” John gasped, head hanging and lips remaining parted, he forced his eyes open to meet hers, her annoyance at being stopped clear on her face
“Was that enough?” John’s voice lowered, making Sherlock’s smile widen to its limits.
“I bet I know more songs than you.”
John's hand started at the base of Sherlock's forehead and then slowly made its way back into the dark tresses that was his beautiful hair. His eyes were fixed now on his slumbering fiance whose chest rose softly before dropping down again. Everything was quiet, even the air. For a moment, John felt like he would lose his mind with the deafening silence in the room, in the whole house, he was sure that Holmes and Watson were done squabbling for the night and decided to retire for the evening, or just stew in their anger until the next day where they would resume their fighting. Sherlock and John have done that before, it never ended on a good note. It's even gotten so bad that they've almost broke up. Thank god for that case, he didn't want to stop loving Sherlock, not ever. The Doctor walked over to Sherlock and sat down on the tiny bit of space the detective left for him and rubbed soothing circles on his back and gave a small smile of reassurance to John.
“Uncle Mycroft didn’t tell you? Whenever you lose your teeth the tooth fairy comes and gives you money.”
John's heart stops for a second. His eyes widened. How long had she been standing there? When did she leave her room? Why did she have to ruin everything? The hand that was holding Sherlock's wrist is empty now. So is his body. He turns around and faces Kylie, who is staring up at him with an expression he cannot place. She must have seen him, she wouldn't be acting this way if she didn't. God, how does he explain this to her? Why couldn't she have just waited in the room for a bit longer? John thinks back to the post-it he made. He inhales deeply and gives her the widest, fakest smile he can muster.
So, Scotland Yard had their annual Secret Santa yesterday, but it’s a week-long process to give people time to get gifts and covertly, not actually covertly ask their person what they want. Well, earlier in the week, Sherlock and I went to drop off some solved case files to Lestrade and, right before we could leave he pulled out a hat and told us to pick a name. There weren’t many names left, but I went first. Sherlock, of course, refused to take part in Secret Santa and deemed it as yet another “mindless, and idiotic indulgence of materialistic greed” I had to promptly remind him that he spent £100 on a shirt because he thought he looked good in it, although he claimed that it would help him on cases where he had to “seduce” yeah right. After my astute observation, as he would say, he rolled his eyes and pulled a name out of the hat. When we were in the cab, I peeked at the name and it was Greg. Sherlock looked over at my name and scoffed. When I asked to see his, he didn’t show me and said that it defeats the purpose of the secret. I had a feeling he peeked while we were leaving the building and wasn’t telling me because he wasn’t happy with his choice, which could have been anyone in the whole police force.
At the threat of John’s life, Sherlock shut up and continued walking. When they reached their destination (another dark room) Moriarty released them from his grip which was surprisingly strong for an older man.
John smirked and began to help collect the silverware and soiled napkins, since Sherlock ran off with their plates in a haste. It seemed like an eternity between them. Sherlock took the pots and began washing them, and John walked around him, storing the leftovers of the food, placing the silverware in the sink, and binning the used napkins. He rested his back against the counter next to Sherlock, and crossed his arms. Sherlock scrubbed furiously at the clean plate. John placed a hand on Sherlock’s back.
From that moment on, John kept checking his watch, and counting down until he could go home to tell Sherlock the good news.
“I don’t think I’ll be joining you to the Secret Santa this Wednesday, John. Give Greg my regards when you see him, good night.”
Sherlock sighs softly and paws at his face. John looks at his own body. He was naked, but his sheet covered his lower regions. He looked up at the ceiling and smiled. He had never felt that intimate with anyone, sorry Mary. That was more than sex, it was more than lust. They made love last night. It was wonderful and everything John thought it would be. Sherlock’s moans, his whimpers, the way his face looked when he finally came. It was too beautiful for words. John looked back over at the brunet, and rested a hand on his back. His skin was so soft, he worried that if he held him too tight he would bruise. And that
"What?! Really?!"
Sherlock’s skin was pale, but he looked like a porcelain doll that was greatly cared for by the owner, even if there are a few flaws. Sherlock’s lips were taut, and his face was gaunt, making his cheekbones all the more apparent. Holmes was done with his facial features and moved on to his hands. Hands can tell a lot about a person.
“You can start with a candle for the table.”
John was crying. Sherlock was crying too, but his tears were silent. John’s were sloppy and all over the place.
"Should I not be saddened by the death of my husband? If I recall, you were saddened as well."
The Doctor swung the door open and it revealed another Weeping Angel inside who was instantly locked in a staring contest with the other. John immediately hit the floor and managed to get out of their line of sight. Just like that, The Doctor closed the door and the three of them examined what just happened.
"...And then you broke down again about a week later. This time it was when you were in the bath. You could move by yourself, Sherlock, but you would eventually need somebody to help you around the house and that somebody was me. You needed a bath, you didn't bathe for several days, and I wanted you to take care of yourself or else you would get worse, but you weren't having any of it. I helped you off the bed and let you support yourself on me as we walked to the bathroom. I told you that I prepared your bath already and you shrugged. When we got to the bathroom, I let you stand as I started to take off your clothes. You batted me away with your hand.
I didn’t want you to bring it up. Those awful two years you spent away, away from me. I was so alone, Sherlock, and I’m sure that you were too. Nothing killed me more than thinking that you were gone from me. I opened my mouth, my lips were quivering, but I found the strength to answer.
But, it seemed, even John could tell today was a bit not good.
It was going perfect, all well, John stepping in rhythm, nothing too fancy to attract attention or too stiff to be noticed, and Sherlock staying close to Sally, dancing face to face with her, both of them falling into character easily
“Quite right” Sherlock smiled, again, “though you’ve missed the fifth. He’s the husband; the others are his son’s, her stepchildren. They’re attempting to locate a piece of vintage jewelry judging by the victims thus far, a piece legally sold at auction but most likely belong to the leader’s family at one point. They mean no harm, and steal nothing at all, only trash the place in an attempt to locate the family heirloom that was more than likely stolen from the generation before her, be it mother or father’s side. I have no doubt she married the man for his previous involvement with the law, break ins, petty robbery, the sons are an added bonus in case they were to run into the home owners. Though from their lack of weapons it’s obvious they have no real plan for if such a thing were to happen. More than likely had a victim walked in they’d just restrain them and demand the location of the heirloom, leave when they find they do not have it.” Sherlock turned to Lestrade to say the rest to him “She’s taller than John; roughly 5’7” judging by her shoe print, average weight, the men are closer to 6’5”. You’ll hardly have trouble finding them in the system, and it would seem” She paused, pulling out her magnifying glass and crouching down, retrieving tweezers to pluck a single red hair from the floor, short like that of a cat “His DNA has been left behind, there is no doubt in my mind he is already in the system. Take the father in for questioning, have the sons and wife in separate rooms. The sons will sell out their stepmother in an attempt to cut back the time for their father. You can take it from here, I assume” Sherlock said, dropping the hair sample in a plastic bag the forensic analysis handed to her without a word, helpful and actually admiring of Sherlock’s work unlike the previous one who had long since moved away to a different city in an attempt to save his marriage
Then raised the question on whether or not she should keep it. Surely, someone in her situation wasn’t fit to raise a child, and if she went through with the pregnancy, John would never let her drop it off at Mycroft’s and let him deal with it. But, on the other hand, she was healthy, and carried desirable traits that would best be passed down to the next generation
And he found himself wondering exactly how much was in that duplicate Baker St, and what exactly about him did Sherlock find worth remembering?
topic like that, but he always just assumed Donovan’s hatred of Sherlock was rooted to just envy, of her brains, her looks, or something equally as petty, the idea of anyone hating her at her core was too far stretched to him. Sherlock, though a lot of things, was not someone to hate, just somewhat annoying
“Of course not, it’s ridiculous, as if I have any need to appear taller as is” she responded with a shake of her head “I’m 6 feet tall, John, hardly in need of an extra three inches”
“Mycroft” she wrinkled her nose, not bothering to move an inch even as footsteps could be heard climbing the stairs to her flat and her landlady’s voice cut through the door
“Enough” Lestrade cut in, “Sally, leave the room and give Sherlock some space”
John sighed, but followed her
“John, good, you’re home. Did you get the toaster? I’m having another craving. It seems the child wants jammed toast and onions” she wrinkled her nose slightly “I don’t suppose you’ve purchased whipped cream by any chance? With Vinegar crisps”
“Have you told the father the joyous news?”
“Still gaining, nausea has subsided for now, but the pain has not”
“Same thing” she said, with a dismissive wave of her hand, and John just sighed
“Oh, this is good!” she replied, shoving the file back at the DI and heading towards her room to change
“What are you doing here, Freak?”
It's an end of an era, I'm sad to see it be over, but I'm glad y'all followed it til the end, even when I dropped off the face of the earth for all that time after my accident
Satisfied that she wasn’t hurt, he frowned “why? You already know more fighting styles than I do”
“Fine”
“And whether she will admit to it or not, they are so much more to Sherlock than she would have you believe. So I will entrust you with her safety on this as well…”
And he wouldn’t have her any other way
“Hardly”
“That obvious then?” he blushed, shifting the way he held the infant to cradle him in his arms
“Dammit Sherlock! One night! I asked for one bloody night and you can’t even give me that!”
Ah yes, that’s why
Anyways, comment if you like the story thus far, I love reading what you have to say
Again, y'all can check out my
___________
He didn’t say anything, simply folded his paper and gave her the look that said ‘explain’
By physical means, at least
The frantic removal of his pants ended when she felt him pressing, hot and heavy against her, hesitant as if asking permission one last time. When her only response was nails dipping into the strong expand of his back, he pushed in, causing her lips to part and a huffed moan to escape as neglected muscles stretched to accommodate his length
Finding a flatmate was miserable, especially for a wounded solider like John Watson
There had to be a logical reason behind it, something stupid and outer-worldly that he would have never linked to it in a million years
He moved, arms snapping up and gripping her forearms hard enough to leave bruises as he switched their positions, pushing her against the wall and crashing his mouth against hers. He swallowed the startled yelp that left her at the sudden movement and twinge of pain she hadn’t expected
“Who else was there to ask, Gary?”
“Alright? Are you alright?” she asked, yanking the explosives from his body and sliding it across the tiled floor
“Wait…!” She broke apart with a gasp, her pupils blown so big there was barely any gray left to see, her cheeks and neck flushed beautifully pink and her breathing sending shock after shock straight to his groin
I have a TKR coming up so for the most part I may start updating sooner than later, again I finished this story ages ago but I do need to go back and make slight edits since I wrote this fic 3 years ago and my style has changed a bit
Only 6 more chapters to go
----------------
“You heard about it?”
I'm gonna post an update tomorrow as well but tbh they might slow down cause NaNoWriMo is almost here and I'm gonna be writing my fantasy novel
The second the mad man left, she got to work, dropping down on her knees in front of him. As her fingers fumbled with the bomb jacket strapped tight around his chest, as her hands shook, he looked down at her. Never thought for once she was capable of the expression she wore, the tension that radiated off her, the desperation of each movement.
“I know…I know…I just… I worry.”
She squeezed her eyes shut and let him do as he wished because this was NEW
Followed quickly by a purchase conformation number and an address, and a third text reading ‘Have fun, Dr. Watson’
___________________
As if on queue, a message alert tone chimed in Sherlock’s pocket
She didn’t reply, simply draped her arm over her eyes to display just how eager she was to talk to him, how much his opinion mattered
Sherlock Holmes didn’t like not knowing things. Secrets, puzzles, she’d go at them with every bit of relevant information she held in that magnificent brain of hers, stripping it all apart for new information that may be useful, dismissing all she didn’t care for. If anything held an air of mystery, like his middle name, she’d pull out all the stops in satisfying her curiosity, and it was almost compulsive, like an addictive need to know anything and everything
“No, wait” he smiled mischievously, leaning forward in his chair and resting a hand on her knee “Leave them on”
“It was only a matter of time before your impulsive and irresponsible behavior had life altering consequences…There is no simple solution to this” he waved his hand in her direction, specifically, her stomach
“Well? I’m giving you free range to ask what you want, and do make it quick.”
“Nothing to be ashamed of? Honestly, John, surely you don’t believe that? After seeing what addiction has done to your sister, you think she’d be so willing to share the details to any future partners?” she shook her head, “If you knew half the things I’d done during those times, the trades I made for a simple fix, I doubt you see it as anything short of shameful” with that, she looked up, her eyes dark with an emotion he couldn’t place, only knowing he didn’t like the way it played across her features
The ceremony dragged on
He hated the idea of her not seeing him as anything more than a loyal dog to call upon, or a release of tension, but even if she did, he knew it wouldn’t change anything, it would hurt, and hell it already did just wondering, but he couldn’t see himself loving her any less, the feelings that wormed their way into his heart were taking root, and he was too far gone to turn back now
Sherlock stood there in shock, his heart clenching as he looked up at the Cyberman that was once John. His eyes blurring with tears as he shook his head. There were so many things he hadn’t said to John, so many things he should have said but he couldn’t because His John was gone.
‘Mister Holmes, I’m sure you know the reason for me calling you back here.’ The doctor said with a raised eyebrow. He expected you to know the answer.
So Janine sold him the cottage she lived in? She used the money she made from the media to buy it then. John remembered reading it, he remembered being very upset and even a bit jealous. Sherlock told him all those years ago that he wasn’t into women; he should’ve known those tabloids weren’t true. It took him some weeks to get over those bold letters; he even stopped reading the paper for a few days. But John couldn’t believe it, Sherlock was gone. But he could still get to him. He had to.
“No no no…” he breathes, “No…John….”
John glared at Mycroft, but continued to speak about the tooth fairy. He could see Kylie’s eyes light up once he said “fairy” and “money” in the same sentence. She beamed, showing her missing teeth clearly now.
“Either Mycroft helped you pick this out, or you have an eye for wine.”
The day it happened, the day you realized that you had no choice but to go to Barts, you were sat on the bed recovering from your shouting match. I stood in front of you shaking my head at your stubbornness. At this point, I was angry, not as much as you, but I was pretty ticked.
They were right, weren’t they? He was dangerous, some people feared him, he’s blown up planets, and he’s had people die for him when they only knew his name. Most of his companions either got out with their lives, or they died. He’s seen more deaths than a man should, especially the deaths of the ones he cared about. Of course they would opt out, they liked living, and they would rather perform the same morning ritual rather than risk being shot at by Daleks, or turned into Cybermen. But he hated being alone. The TARDIS is so much better with people in it, not a lone space man with too many memories he could do without. But he still managed to give one of those goofy smiles and prayed silently that they didn’t look directly into his eyes and see through him.
You shouted, 'Bill Waters!'
“Adding extra ‘spice’ to your wine, Greg?”
“That day where you showed up on the crime scene, A Study in Pink, as John titles it, and you were with this stranger. I’ve never seen him before, and I’ve no idea who he was, hell I couldn’t even remember his name.”
Sherlock's brows furrowed as he listened to the Doctor's angry whispers.
Still, even though Sherlock didn’t move much lately, and missed nearly all their lunch dates, he still managed to keep a steady and watchful eye over John.
“As I was saying,” Moriarty interrupted, “The door swung open to reveal things that I could never hope to think of in my mind. So much technology, things that are not even close to being thought of here! I’m sure you hear this a lot, Doctor, but it is bigger on the inside.”
"While it may be good from a lot of stuff, opening wooden doors is not one of them. This is also one of the reasons I prefer to be in the future and not the past!"
Mycroft, as cool as ever simply kept his hand up and pointed at the vacant seat. John still refused to sit. They were staring at him with sullen faces, well Greg and Sally were. Finally, Sally spoke.
"And what about John and The Doctor?"
John sat up and wiped the tears from his eyes.
Like a petulant child, Holmes rolled his eyes and then nodded. Watson was highly satisfied with that.
John's breath hitched in his throat. He looked at Kylie, who shrank into her chair. She looked absolutely terrified.
"John, I barely celebrate my own birthday, I could care less if you threw me a party."
“This is really good.”
"Oi! I have never been to the loony bin in my life! Well, if you don't count that one time where I had to do that thing that I can't tell you about because all of time and space relies on it, but other than that, I have never been there, now are you coming or not?!"
“Doctor is it? How much longer must we keep this up? I doubt our eyes shall let us keep them wide open like this any longer,” Watson said.
Holmes was beaming.
Sherlock’s eyes watered up again but he managed to fight the tears.
I don’t think anyone’s ever just
“What is it?”
There are a few grumbles in the audience, and Sherlock tries his best to ignore it.
"Why am I here?"
“Sir?”
"I'm sorry, Watson. I was only just waking up."
“We chatted a bit on the phone, talked about her new job and whatnot. She’s stepping up in the business world, I’m proud of her. She asked me out for a cuppa a few days ago, I declined. I didn’t want her to see me like this, I wanted her to see me as the Harry she fell in love with all those years ago. I think I’m ready to see her now, I want to see her, and I miss her.”
“Are we feeling a little impatient? Couldn’t wait your turn, huh?”
Holmes gave a faint smile and assumed the praying mantis position.
John rolled his eyes.
“So that means that you’re…you’re me.”
“Aren’t you going to ask me?”
Greg gave a half-smile. No doubt this was because of the special event that was about to take place. Mycroft looked indifferent, but he was proud of his little brother. And he was happy with the choice of partner, but he would never say that to Sherlock's face.
He had to put Rosie down as Sherlock locked himself in the bathroom while he howled at his joke.
How could I process that? I almost wanted to ignore the question completely and huddle in on myself and sleep, but I didn’t want you to feel like you overstepped some sort of boundary. As much as I didn’t want to answer, my mouth opened and out spewed the words.
Watson's face was growing with anger.
“Are we on for lunch today?”
There they were about half an hour later walking through the cobblestone streets of London, enjoying the nice weather and the company of each other. They would’ve been out faster, but Sherlock wanted to look as “presentable” as possible, what he really meant was that he wanted to look gorgeous. John knew that there were some self-esteem issues tied to that reason, but he would always tell Sherlock how good he looks when he’s in clothes, and when he’s not. The blush that reaches Sherlock’s cheeks is one of the things that keep John going.
“Do we still have the ice cream?”
I told her that Kylie was in the room, asleep. Molly seemed disappointed at that. But then I told her that she should be waking soon, but we wouldn't be here for that. You watched as I told her where all her stuff was, when to feed her, when to put her to sleep. It made me feel...I don't know how to say it, proud. Being a parent, it gives me a sense of pride, Sherlock. I love it. And I love Kylie.
“If I was in your place I would. I’ve a special place in my heart for you, Holmes.”
The Doctor huffed and turned around.
He watched as Sherlock turn, his long neck elongating and filling him with the desire to kiss that long slender neck, and his jaw, and other areas. Sherlock’s smile was small, and whatever was on his mind prevented him from looking John in the eyes.
He hasn't seen Greg in some time. Does Greg even know what Kylie looks like now? He barely saw her when she was a baby because, well, John didn't have the luxury of parading his baby around like new parents usually do because he was tending to his terminally ill husband around the clock. Molly hasn't seen her since the funeral. She would fawn all over Kylie as soon as she laid eyes on her. Maybe it wasn't for John to decide. With a sigh, he turned towards his room and called Kylie's name. In no time, she came running out of the room and right into her papa's arms. He smiled and kissed her head, and then her cheek. God he loved her so much.
Holmes sat back again and folded his hands together.
“It is unfamiliar to me as well.”
The crowd started clapping and Sherlock was still laughing. It made John so overjoyed to see Sherlock like this. He never had enough happiness in his life.
Holmes didn’t respond and only moved away from Watson and tried to look as detached as possible. But Watson has lived with him for so long that can look past the man that Holmes wanted people to think he was, and the man that Holmes really was.
It was some time before Holmes heard the door open again and saw Sherlock walking out. He stopped in front of the chemistry set in front of Holmes and stared at it for a while. Holmes tried to ignore it but eventually, he couldn’t stand the eyes anymore.
You let out a sigh, like you preparing to head out into the void. You opened the door, my eyes landed on the taxi that was waiting outside of the flat. I grabbed your hand and gestured towards the vehicle with my head. You blinked at me, but you didn’t move yet.
Even Sherlock seemed remorseful, as if he spoke John’s words.
"I'll be out in a moment, Mycroft; you may take your places while you wait. Keep the crowd entertained for a moment longer."
That night, after I put Kylie to bed and got my pyjamas on, I lie down; you were already in bed because you didn’t leave the room ever since our meeting with the others. I could hear Mrs. Hudson crying softly downstairs, and I felt awful. Knowing that you had the illness, and being a doctor, made me worry for you so much, because I know what cancer can do to people, I’ve seen it first-hand. I didn’t want that to happen to you, Sherlock. I wanted you and me to be together for as long as time would allow us.
"Yes...time-traveling stuff."
“Everybody’s gone.”
“Now, come on, I’m sure Holmes and Watson are awake, let’s go see what they’re up to.”
John's silence only validated his deductions. Sherlock's silence made John nervous, but he expected it. Sherlock knew why John had the gun when they moved in with each other, he was the one who told him that he needn't use it unless either of them was in danger and had to. He promised Sherlock that he was only going to use it for its intended use.
‘I told her that we were close with him and she still didn’t let us in! Why, John?’
“Sherlock, why didn’t you tell me sooner?”
"Doctor! What brings you here? I thought you said that you had something to do."
The Doctor.
‘Like I said, she made bad choices.’
'I can't even eat food anymore, John!' You sounded so pained. You weren't one for eating but this, I never thought that I would see you upset over food. It took me nearly twenty minutes just to get you to eat a piece of toast! This was...it was horrible...I knew why you were so upset. You were upset because you weren't going to be able to be your own person anymore, you didn't want me Mother Henning you twenty-four seven, you weren't going to be you anymore and it terrified you. You leaned on me and then you closed your eyes. You weren't sleeping, but it was very taxing on you. You threw up all of the food you ate. I knew Sherlock, I knew that this was the beginning of the end.
"I'll worry about that once I find Sherlock."
Sherlock snorted and took another helping of his food. “Maybe, John.”
She shrugged.
He finished the breakfast in no time. It was a platter; he made enough for the both of them since he knew there was no way Sherlock was going to eat all of it. He could barely eat toast sometimes. The grand breakfast consisted of; two slices of ham, Sherlock's had a slice of pineapple on it so that it would be easier to differentiate. He made two fried eggs, though Sherlock liked his yolk a bit more runny, four slices of toast with beans on the top of two slices and strawberry jam on the other. Sherlock isn't picky with his toast; he'll probably eat them both. There were some bangers on another smaller plate, and to top it all off, he had two plates with their teacups resting on it.
‘Where are you, exactly, Mycroft?’ I asked. He must have liked Batman when he was younger; he acts like him at times.
He turned to the right to see Sherlock sitting there with his coat on, smiling at him.
That’s when The Doctor interrupted the conversation, probably for the better too. He threw his arms around the both of them and had a wide smile plastered on his face.
I know that, John. I’m not a child.’
Sherlock’s eyes squeeze shut as he hears the gun go off. He’s covered in oil and there’s the sound of an explosion.
“Fuck…” Was all John could say as Sherlock took his cock into his mouth. It didn’t take Sherlock long to make John hard. As soon his tongue touched the tip, it rose. Sherlock looked up at John with a smirk and said, “Were you looking forward to this?”
Sherlock shook his head. It made him sick just to think about eating his favorite Chinese meal. John tsked.
He changed her diaper before he put her new clothes on, thankfully it was only pee. He’s scarred from their previous time together. When he held her up to blow a raspberry to her stomach, she kicked in him in throat and he thought he was going to die.
‘Would you like to see her? I have a picture.’
John’s heart was saddened for what Sherlock must have gone through. He knows how much Sherlock loved her, even if he never expressed it as much as he would like to. Oh god, how could he be so disconnected from his friend for so long? How could he miss the chance to help him through his loss, to try and rekindle what they once had? How could he leave Sherlock alone to go through such a dark time?
‘It’s nothing, John, don’t worry about me.’ You told me with a soft voice. I had to believe you then, what choice did I have? If only I saw through you early on…
‘You’re tired, John…’ I heard you squeak. ‘Your eyes…they’re a bit low…and your breathing is slowing down…’ I shushed you and told you to save your energy because you weren’t looking too hot either. You were quiet for a whole minute. Then you said, ‘Lay with me.’
"Jesus Christ it gets so lonely without you, Sherlock. You have no idea how bad it gets. Why'd you have to get sick? Why'd you have to leave me alone?"
I reached out and grabbed your hand. I was grateful that you welcomed the contact.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but John could hear him blush through the phone. He waited a bit before he heard Sherlock singing to the baby.
John was the one who spoke up.
Watson thought. His hand clenched as he pieced together a response. It seemed like an eternity before he responded.
Mycroft looked disappointed to hear that much. I asked him what did he expect from you, and he didn’t know. He probably knew that you were sulking; he just didn’t want to believe it. You’re his little brother, and no one wants to hear that their little sibling has cancer. Not even Mycroft. He wanted to know when you would be out of surgery, and I told him that it shouldn’t be much longer now, probably an hour or two. The sun was almost set.
Sherlock stopped scrubbing and looked up at him with sad, glassy eyes. He just stared at John for a while before he muttered, “I’m sorry.”
Not really hearing Sherlock's question, he rested a hand on his prominent chin and started muttering to himself.
"Oh, Holmes, you always manage to give me more work than is necessary."
“Right, are you hungry? I don’t think I have much food here but we can order takeaway and watch Bond movies. Have a sleepover of sorts.”
John's feet shuffled.
"Who are you talking to?"
"It's open!"
“I will explain everything when we get back, for now, take slow steps backwards and keep your eyes fixed on that angle statue, do not blink. Do not blink until you cannot see that statue anymore, do you understand?!”
“She’s talking at an accelerated rate, and most times I think I hear her try to enunciate words.”
"Alright."
Watson’s smile seemed to beam even more. John knew that it was because Holmes was actually being compliant for a change; he felt the same way whenever Sherlock agreed with him. Turning back to Sherlock and John, Watson said, “Now then, you two should go and clean up a bit, you are not suitable company for the outdoors with your clothes all disheveled. Have you nothing to change in?”
“Are you sure that we aren’t imposing?” Watson asked.
‘Yeah, I guess.’
John’s voice was careful, but he repeated himself. “Are we on for lunch today, love?”
I took a deep breath.
Holmes just smiled.
Holmes’s shoulders shook as he gave a quiet laugh.
Until the day I walked to your room to find all of our friends parked outside of your door looking as pissed as ever.
“Let’s get out of here, I think we’re more than clean.” He moved to shut the water off. Sherlock looked confused and stepped out with him. John took the towel and dried himself off and Sherlock too. Sherlock went to put his clothes on but John shook his head.
"That's good to hear. You've been working?"
John's smile was weak, he was tired.
"Don't blink, John! Whatever you do, do not blink!"
Upstairs, Holmes and Watson were also preparing for bed. Holmes was sitting in his armchair with his nightwear on and Watson emerged from the bathroom. He saw Holmes sitting and he stopped in his tracks.
Sherlock jumped in.
With a sigh, Moriarty began to talk.
Holmes smirked.
“Where would I go, John? Have you forgotten why I’m here in the first place?” There was humor in Sherlock’s tone. It made John feel stupid for thinking such things.
John, John on the other hand, he noticed the sharp decline in Sherlock’s spirit and so he spent every day since it’s appearance trying to help. He tried to remind Sherlock to bathe when he got particularly smelly, he even bathed him sometimes, washing his hair so it wouldn’t become a tangled mess in the future. He tried to spend every minute he wasn’t at work with or around Sherlock. He would take all his meals with Sherlock in the living room. Their dinners mostly consisted of just John eating while Sherlock laid on the couch, ignoring the freshly-made pumpkin soup that John was trying out. John wasn’t mad, he wouldn’t be able to call himself a doctor if he got mad at Sherlock. Depression was a very real illness, and he figured out quite early on in their time together that Sherlock suffered from it often. John had been just as depressed before meeting him. His diet only consisted of two bites of an apple and maybe a glass of water, he laid in bed because the pain in his leg was too much for him after his discharge, he doesn’t know how much longer he would have made it without meeting Sherlock. While his boyfriend had always tried to twist the words, he knows that Sherlock had confessed to him that he felt the same. But now things are different, Sherlock is not okay, the worst it had been in a while for John. It worried him a lot, and so he nearly begged for his boss to let him take time off, his boyfriend’s mental health came first.
After Sherlock's nightmare.
"But since this is all solved, let's get to the singing and the eating and all that stuff associated with parties. I'm feeling rather peckish at the moment."
“I think she wants to hear your voice. Let me just quiet her down for a second. Are you busy right now?”
Thanks again!
“Well I have the address he gave me, for when the movers came, I think I left it…hold on a minute.”
Holmes's face straightened.
This was all uncharacteristic for you, but I knew why you were doing it. You wanted reassurance that you were still you, and who better to tell you than me, right? I chuckled and told you that you were still you, no illness could ever change that. I told you that you were my Sherlock, and that I loved you and that we would make it through this together. I told you that it was just the two of us against the world, because frankly, I felt like the world was being pretty vindictive at the time. Your eyes danced away from mine and you looked like you were processing what I told you. You were mine, love, no matter what, you will always be my brilliant Sherlock.
‘Sherlock.’ I uttered. You sucked your teeth this time.
"Good morning gentlemen! How is everybody today?"
“Nonsense, I’m only telling you the norms of our society and how they differ from yours. There’s no harm in that. But I will tell you one thing, I envy you, only just a little bit, but my happiness outshines any feeling of jealousy.”
I couldn’t say that I had. I spent so many days angry at you for your cold, distant, behavior. Harry took the silence as a yes.
The door opened to reveal Greg. He was dressed in one of his finest tuxedos, Mycroft came in after him. Sherlock smirked.
I'm sorry Sherlock, I need a minute to compose myself...."
“I know what?” His brows were furrowed. John took another sip to gain the courage to tell him.
He could tell she was affected, however, regardless of what she tried to let other’s believe, even with a face of indifference and a tone as steady as stone, John could see it in the slight stiffness in her stride, feel it in the tension during the cab ride home, hear it as she slammed the front door shut, so loudly Ms. Hudson came out, fusing, which Sherlock ignored as she climbed the 17 steps up to their flat two at a time
Ridiculous, thinking that a bra and HIS boxers were what she considered appropriate attire to parade around in in front of her male flatmate
“Yes, fine, fine…” Sherlock answered with a dismissive wave of her hand, though the lie fell flat when she turned abruptly, facing as much away from the body as she could manage and expelling the toast and tea John had forced her to eat that morning onto the cold floor
“But I need it! The cravings are worse than nicotine, and it’s not as if there is a patch for that sort of thing”
had an eruption of butterflies dancing in her stomach that had no business being there, her heart pounding with almost uncontrolled emotions was very much
“I want him arrested!” The man cried out
She blinked a few times, shifting their stances so the obvious bulge of John’s tented trousers wasn’t pressed against her thigh so prominently
John didn’t bother to speak, or even ask how the man knew in the first place when he and Sherlock went out of there way to hide their little encounters, keeping them strictly out of view of CCTV cameras and displaying no added affection in their daily routine
“Hmm…” John hummed, rocking his son and keeping his eyes on the slowly resting face “You shouldn’t feel obligated, you know…just because I…I mean…I wouldn’t mind…I could handle it…”
And he bit back a groan realizing it wasn’t even a challenge, his choice was decided the second Sherlock had walked into and took over his life
“Er…yeah…” He said shyly, a guilt building in his stomach that had no business there
“A Holmes isn’t being born today!” Sherlock hissed in response
She took it back and her eyes darted off to the side, before resting on the doors again
Granted, he never planned on sharing a flat with a woman, not one he wasn’t romantically involved with at least, but it would seem, even that would change with time
People never spared them a second glance when her head was rested on his shoulder or his arm wrapped possessively around her slim waist. No one would ever think them to be one of the most dangerous duos in all of England; a genius detective and her solider/doctor guardian.
But, of course, John, being as sentimental and surprisingly average at times, wanted something traditional, with the tux, and the dress, and the photographer capturing every awkward and forced moment; with food, and family, and ‘friends’; crowds of people, loud and obnoxious, and everything she dreaded in life topped with a lacy bow.
She subconsciously tightened around him, earning a hiss in response
“I can care for myself” she added angrily, dropping the now trash into the bin with enough force to echo through the kitchen and shatter the glass
Deceiving
They sat through Mike’s rather embarrassing best man speech on how introducing the two of them was entirely intentional, that he had known the entire time that this was where the two would end up
Time had flowed by, leaving him with a few extra wrinkles and his ashy blonde hair with more ash than he liked, he was pushing 50, and his physical condition was steadily declining, their cases becoming more private with light leg work than highly dangerous chases like they used to be when they first started, but neither of them seemed to mind.
“We still have to send out all the inventions, there are a lot of people we need to text, write, phone” John said as he hurried along her side, trying to keep up with her brutal pace as she took advantage of her seemingly endless legs to go much faster than a casual walk for him
“Nothing new” John sighed, punching the pillows to try and soften them as he slipped off his slippers and tried to get comfortable on the narrow space the sofa provided
“Harriet, I presume. John was certain you wouldn’t come” Sherlock said, noticing how the woman was dying for a drink but holding herself back, probably because of the wedding and visit with her estranged brother
Be sure to check out my
“Sherlock…?” He asked cautiously, taking note that she hadn’t brother to remove her coat as he pulled off one of his jumpers
The woman, April, played a little with what remained of her salad, her candy apple eyes dancing along the plate before coming to meet John’s
Lestrade quickly picked up on that fact, but said nothing. It wasn’t his place to get in between them during a row, just let it take it’s course, where by the end, John would forgive whatever mistake Sherlock made, and she wouldn’t apologize for it and continue on as if nothing had happened
“No, I was simply pointing out traits you possess that are desirable in our future generation. Though I don’t approve of who would father any child as of this moment should you get pregnant” she said, before dragging her eyes over her “Hmm, I’ve misspoken, it would seem you have moved onto greener fields”
She stared at him for a few seconds, as if trying to understand something, before clearing her throat. “Yes. Um, very well, we’ll depart for my parent’s estate come morning” with that she walked towards her room, and shut the door behind her
“Nothing serious”
Most of the guests were John’s additional invites, even extending a hand towards some of the less obnoxious Yarders who sat and looked rather out of place
After a few minutes of the young lad walking around, careful to avoid stepping on anything or disturbing the scene, his lips moving with silent thoughts as his eyes darted back and forth a few times, he turned back to them
for the Google Doc link
“Happy birthday, Sherlock”
“My apologies.” She said after a few seconds of awkward silence
“Your dilated pupils and increase respiratory rate are marks of arousal. You really should be more honest of your attraction to me, however disgusting and unwanted it may be” Sherlock rolled her eyes, turning towards Lestrade before the forensic analysis could reply
John opened and closed his mouth a few times before shaking his head, muttering ‘brat’ under his breath
“Won’t leave you alone then?” Sally asked, peering over John’s shoulder as he read the most recent texts received, his phone chiming every other minute as while he was at the crime scene, taking in and writing down as much details as he could to bring home to Sherlock
“Uh…Congrats Mate” Lestrade said with a vague gesture towards John, who seemed frozen in place, still staring at Sherlock, because, really, leave it to the consulting detective to announce such an important event with the same voice used to read out an ingredients label
After waking him one random night from a rather nasty nightmare a few months into their friendship with the sound of rather sorrowful music at 2am, it became a bit more of a regular occurrence. Gradually, as if she was easing him into it, or perhaps herself, and it wasn’t until a few weeks after that did she continue the play upon him entering the room, no longer stopping to put it away, and slowly he won the rights to concerts in the sitting room, a cuppa in his hand and no longer bothering with a book he pretended to read, he’d just watched, as she moved to the rhythm, her body swaying like rivers at times or tensely straight with violent thrusts of her bow as sweat built on her brow. Just like the work, it seemed, whenever she played, she gave it her all, and it was break-taking to watch
Sherlock let out a low hum, deep from within her chest, rumbling out almost like a cat’s purr
“You’re…. okay with this…?” He asked, hesitating, as if the second he allowed himself to relax, Mycroft would strike with armed forces
“I can’t keep feeding you junk food, Sherlock…” John sighed, heading towards the kitchen to drop off the bags
“Like there are many. Mycroft barely meets the requirement” she replied, and with that they entered
How in the hell did she think it was even remotely acceptable behavior?
“Of course.” She responded, turning back towards Ms. Hudson and extending her arm to allow her landlady to better adjust the white lace sleeve “I am Sherlock Holmes after all”
What other choice did she have? Drugs to offer relief for an instant as the needle dug into her flesh and the release pumped through her veins? So short lived and so destructive, yet besides the work, it was the only thing she could do to just STOP
He had his mother’s curly hair, her intense eyes, her pale skin, not a trace of John in those chubby and rounded features, a Holmes down to the bone
It didn’t matter that he was once a solider, was still a doctor, that he’s killed people and spends his evenings chasing down criminals in the depths of London, at first glance he was nothing more than a short man in a knit jumper
Sherlock wrinkled her nose at that
“I know plenty of people who would disagree with that statement” Sherlock replied, rolling her perfectly lined eyes
She watched him go, confused by the sudden air of distance between them
for the Google Doc link
Guilt?
“John…” She moaned when he licked the pulse point of her neck where his teeth had been a few moments before, but that wouldn’t do, when she said his name, spoke at all, the anger in the pit of his stomach grew, and he growled into her skin, pulling down her pajama bottoms and pants all in one smooth motion, and they pooled around her ankles as he curved his hand behind her knee, pulling her leg up and to her stomach, hooking it over his good shoulder. The frantic sound of his fly being undone punctured the air otherwise filled with their heavy breathing, and he pulled himself out from within the confines of his jeans, pushing in rather roughly, and groaned when her body accepted him easily.
He froze, hands still cupping her small breasts, panting out and hoping she wouldn’t reject him just then, not after he just got a taste, a feel of what being with Sherlock would really be like, only to have it so cruelly yanked away at the last second
“We were barely speaking, Sherlock…” He replied softly, hunching his shoulders slightly as if embarrassed
Anyways, yall can catch me on Tumblr StonerBrujx to remind me, I'll just uploading a chapter maybe again in one or two days to space them out, or comment so I'm also reminded, I love reading y'all's thoughts
“How is he?” She asked
“The jewel thief was subdued, you’ll find him handcuffed to a railing inside” Sherlock tone was calm and cool as always, causing John’s fingers to curl like hooks into his palms, biting into the flesh so hard they shook with tension
But she couldn’t argue that he wasn’t right. John would love any child of his, regardless of the mother to whom it was born or the circumstances in which it was conceived, dangerous sentiment that tied Sherlock’s hands and decided her fate the second that damn stick turned positive
“We’ll be home by dinner”
Strangely enough, though, Sherlock never said anything. She would continue on, not correcting a single assumption made about the two of them, and he wondered if she truly couldn’t care what people thought, or if she couldn’t be bothered to correct the rumors because she knew John would get to it
“It’s not as if it’s false. I don’t see why you didn’t just allow us to home school Junior, even with the Work, he’d learn much more. Here, his brilliant mind will go to waste.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Because” He breathed again, his eyes moving down her figure without shame, though it wasn’t lustful, but loving “You’re beautiful” he caressed her cheek, his smile soft and shy “And you’re my wife, now”
“I’m sorry, what?” He asked
The flat was…tense
She gave a satisfied hum that soon turned to soft breathing and he realized she, Sherlock Holmes, had found her will to sleep when using him as a pillow
Tw for: suicide mention, death, and angry sex
“She doesn’t tell me things” Molly replied with a sad smile
It truly hit her then that this was her HUSBAND, John Watson, perfect, complex, ever interesting John Watson, the man that limped into her life and changed everything
“She has always struggled to connect to other people.” He continued and John straightened his posture “and what may come easily to you, she cannot fully understand”
“You want to get married.”
“I would assume it would be obvious with his coming of age”
(See the end of the chapter for
for fanfics I don't publish on AO3
“Yes, but they proved to be rather useless our last case, the results of being held captive could …”
His thrusts were deep, and she looked up at him with half lidded eyes, watching his face twist with pleasure as he drove in and out, his hips trembling every so often as he held himself back, trying to keep from slamming into her like he normally would
When Molly had brought Jim Moriarty over, introducing him as her boyfriend with obvious eyes roaming over Sherlock to look for some sort of reaction, the detective didn’t move
“Ready?”
What else was there to do?
John had gone through quite a bit of trouble to just do a simple gift giving like she’d done for him. He sent a text to the number that had magically found it’s way onto his mobile the day he met Sherlock, and was surprised by the immediate response
“I’ve already told you why! My family is insufferable when it comes to my relationship status, as if the lack of husband at my age is the worst possible thing to bestow on the Holmes’ family”
If you have any chapter suggestions to give, like ideas for short chapters, I'd be happy to accept them!
“Sherlock!” A woman called from the seemingly endless table “How long did you plan to make us wait?”
If you wanna hmu, you can message me on my
“Leave it, John” He heard Lestrade radio in from the earpiece, and he bit the inside of his lip, keeping himself from barking out a curse in response, something along the lines of ‘fuck off, that’s my wife’
John snorted, “Usually children get their father’s last names anyways, so seems like Mycroft will be the only one to pass it down”
This chapter is NSFW
“When did you…?”
Hope y'all enjoyed the story thus far
“At your brother’s expense, I’d have thought you’d gone all out”
“Not good. Boundaries, Sherlock”
He never been so happy before in his life
Okay so I recently picked up all my old fanfics I abanaded back in 2014, but literally like.. none of it is Sherlock, it's all nerd shit like Harvest Moon, Teen Titans, AtLA, and Naruto, if any of y'all wanna read them, I posted a few here and the rest are on my old FF account, I go by FFK there, too, since it's like my brand I can't get rid of, even tho I've moved onto a different handle (StonerBrujx or just Brujx)
“We almost got caught last time!” He shook his head, standing up and shit, his legs felt like jelly
Donovan hesitated, before shaking her head “Does he know you plan to drag your little protégé in?”
Watching her play, with emotions playing across her face, the obvious language of her body, he smiled, because she was exposing herself, pealing back layers to give him a peek, something so rare and he knew he was one of the only, if not only, person Sherlock would be so open to
Sure, she’d make a show of how put upon she was whenever John forced her to eat something on a case before she passed out or chided her for doing something particularly dangerous, but if she were to be completely honest with herself (and she always made an effort to be brutally so) she’d admit that it was a nice change of pace to have someone worry about her just because they enjoyed her company
John flexed his hand that was in Lestrade’s grip, before letting out a shaky sigh, and nodding for the DI to release him as he got off
“Hmm, don’t give up just yet. Some cases are difficult at first” She replied, ruffling his short curls with a tender smile
She continued looking at him, staring, like she could will the answer to her unasked question by her gaze alone
Her hand pushed back her curls, raking through her hair as she leaned forward and thought of the best way to explain it all
“Get him OUT!” Her cry echoed throughout the entire floor of the hospital as the vase of flowers John had bought her was flung across the room, smashing against the door with impressive force, nearly hitting it’s target and shattering instantly
