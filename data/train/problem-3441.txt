“Dude.  She has crazy eyes,” Dean states as a matter of fact. The fact does little to iron out that crease between Cas’ eyes.
“I dunno,” he shrugged a shoulder, trying to sweep the question under the rug, but Castiel offered nothing else in return.  “I guess--”  Clearly nervous, Dean swallowed, throat clicking, and wiped his sweating palms on his thighs before he confessed, “...I guess ever since you came to town?”
“Sam, I said drop it,” Dean warned.  “We came here to get you safe and that’s what we’re gonna do, so sit there and eat your goddamn pancakes.  I gotta go make a call.”
Still suspicious, Dean set his other things down at the end of his bed and slipped his shoes off, eyes flitting between Castiel’s and his precariously perched laptop, but the peculiar smirk didn’t leave, if anything it only grew wider.
Castiel averted his eyes, not allowing himself that latent feeling of jealousy forcing itself up between his ribs.  What did he have to be jealous of anyway?  Dean wasn’t his, and Aaron wasn’t anything to write home about either.
He isn't wrong though.  Dean’s eyes are bloodshot and the dark stains pulling under his eyes after two nights without sleep aren’t helping anything.  His hair is sticking in a million different directions and, were it longer, he'd probably look similar to Cas.
They found a lonely table outside to eat their breakfast and sip their coffee and maybe in some alternate timeline Castiel could pretend this was a date or something, like they were a couple that did this all the time, but as it stood, it wasn’t a date and Castiel felt pathetic just for having the notion.  He poked at his soggy cereal with his spoon as Dean bit into his bacon.
He didn’t bother to turn his head, choosing to rest against the railing as he continued brood out here in the dark.  He knew it was rude not to, but he was desperately trying to maintain his own serenity out here and poor jokes at his expense, that he didn’t understand, weren’t helping.
“Um,” he wets his lips, drawing his attention to where his hand is resting on Cas’ bare thigh. His skin is warm under Dean’s fingers and he can feel the intake of breath Cas takes when he pinches the skin because Dean has to take one too. The shot is over in mere moments, but Cas shuts his eyes and bites his lip the whole way through. Extracting it carefully, Dean tosses the sharp in the bin on the counter, smiling broadly up at Cas. “There,” he says, “Now, that wasn’t so hard, was it?”
Scratching the hairs at the nape of his neck, Dean blushes when the only thing his puny brain decides to cough up is the thought of Cas’ big blue dildo again. “I dunno, I—” He inhales and releases the rest in the same breath— “I thought I was fine with it, but— man, I dunno what’s wrong with me— but it’s like every time he brings a guy back to the apartment I feel like I’m crawlin’ outta my friggin’ skin.” He doesn't know why it bothers him so much.  Before now, it’d never been a big deal to him, gay, straight, whatever, but maybe it’s different in theory than it is when it’s right down the hall. “Cas suggested it, and at the time I thought it was crazy, but it’s been eating at me all week, Charles, and I can’t help thinking... maybe he’s right, y’know? I’ve never felt like this before. Not even with Mega Bitch. I don’t like it.”
Dean’s eyes were trained on him in shock, the sting of tears residing in the corners of his eyes, as Cas’ deft fingers found their way to his belt buckle. He inched the zipper open, sliding his suit pants down below his ass, down past his knees. He let them puddle around his ankles, preening at the look of abject desperation shining in Dean’s eyes while a new challenge ignited behind his own. Dean had never been good at taking all of him this way. Cas was simply too big and they both knew it. But Dean leaned in, resolved, face close enough to feel the heat from Cas’ groin as his heavy cock stood at attention between his thick thighs. Dean’s mouth was watering despite himself.
Suddenly, there was cum filling his mouth and shooting down the back of his throat.  Some even dribbling out the corners.  Castiel relished all of it with a pathetically needy moan and he drank it readily, hungrily, like Dean was bestowing the holy sacrament upon his tongue.
Dean regards Cas’ soft mop of hair spilling over between his fingers and his lips softly part to speak. He doesn’t know what to say though. It’s the most Cas has said to him in days and he doesn’t want to screw up a good thing just by being himself. “That’s, uh, that sucks, Cas. So, no more of that gel crap then?” he wavers instead.
Castiel scrunched his nose in distaste.  “My condolences.  I'm truly sorry your sex with the troglodyte was so poor.  If it's any consolation, you could definitely do better.  Now, up,” he said waving him away.
“Uh, y’know, I don’t actually know.  Too long, I s’pose.”  Dean gave a huff of a laugh and thumped his head against the wall of the confessional.  “You tell me,” he joked uncomfortably.
Coming back up, his head was spinning and he pinched his eyes against the woozy head rush, but when he opened them again the sight of his bleeding
Charlie afforded him a withering look as they came to rest in a nice, grassy area under the big tree.  “You’re hilarious, Dean.  Aren’t you gay too?”
Dean knew he was being creepy now just standing there, watching him.  He used to get annoyed with Castiel for doing exactly this back in the day.  Now here he was, being a hypocrite.
“Hey,” Dean said to garner his attention again,  “You look like you know a thing or two about this stuff.  Can I ask you somethin’?”
“But you’re not gonna find ‘em in here.  You have to actually leave the dorm every once in a while.”  He slung a clean towel over his shoulder as he headed for the door.
“That’s not my name.”  He fumbled with it, trying to get it back into the wallet slot, as he made his way further into the darkened club.
“Sam said he thought there might be some in here, so here we are,” explains Cas. Dean isn't surprised Sam has catalogued this box of crap too. Not in the least.
As they closed the car doors on rusted hinges, they walked in step with each other.  Both ambling forward, but neither seeming to want to walk faster to get there.
Rolling his eyes, Crowley motioned for Castiel to stay put and directed Meg under his breath.  “Well, don’t just stand there!”
Dean startled out of his silent brooding.  His eyes were automatically drawn down to the hand in question.  To the toilet paper sticking to the drying blood caked on his knuckles.  They were the color of the bricks he’d punched.  He’d been avoiding acknowledging it, hoping maybe Sam just wouldn’t notice.  He snorted to himself at that, at Sam not noticing; the kid could notice a shift in the breeze a mile out.
“It means,” Balthazar started, grabbing Castiel by the shoulders, “that my dear friend Cassie is finally going to get fucked tonight!  Or you know, whatever.”  He gave a flippant hand gesture before Castiel was being pulled in for a tight embrace, feigning a sob and a sniffle into his shoulder, murmuring something akin to ‘they grow up so fast’.
Castiel pathetically sobbed when the pad of his thumb skimmed over that one spot again.  “Why won’t you just leave?”  He forced himself to growl.  Forced himself to fight through the pleasure that was all too abruptly morphing into pain.
Castiel turned his cellphone off to avoid the inevitable call he would receive from Balthazar for ignoring his messages.  For added precaution, he tossed it across the living room floor and groaned, spooking Michelangelo who had been lazily grooming himself without a care in the world, all while it seemed Castiel’s world was crashing down around him.  Alright, maybe that was actually a bit dramatic.  Afterall, he didn't know Damien-- Dean-- was a student -- his student.  He could barely piece his face together at the time as it was.  In fact, he could barely piece together a large portion of that sequence of events.  If this were an after school special, Castiel would be the lesson in why one should say ‘no’ to drugs.  What was the worst that could happen?  This was probably the worst case scenario he hadn't even anticipated.
“I am yours for the night.”  Castiel smiled.  “However, I think we should get cleaned up first, don’t you?”
Hesitantly, Dean gripped his hands under the crook of his knees, inhaling deep through his nose, before his legs fell apart, feeling more vulnerable than he’d ever felt in his life.  The subtle fluttering of butterflies filled his stomach as the cold air caressed his taint, but he told himself it was a good feeling.  He wanted this, even if he was legitimately terrified, and he didn’t want Castiel to think he was some inexperienced virgin either, because he wasn’t a virgin, he’d just never done this.
He moved him over with ease and Dean lied saying the show of strength didn't send blood to the southern part of his body.
The two of them waited leaning against the counter as the air grew colder and the yellow lights danced driven by the wind. In the background, only the sound of the fryer and an old radio.
In my defense, it was a really tough chapter to traduce and I had to make some adjustments, but it was worth the effort.
"Fuck!” Cas voice sounded shattered, his breathing got louder and occasional small moans started leaving his mouth.
. Judging by what Castiel had said and done the other night, the feeling was mutual.‘You drive me crazy,’ he’d told him in a voice wrecked by desire.
Dean yelped. "C-as...nngg...we should be doing pancakes!" He said so, but he reached out and gripped Castiel's raven hair in his fingers, encouraging him to go on. The boy's erection pressed insistently against the curve of his ass.
At that moment, he remembered the night before, when Cas had started painting him, when desire had taken over and the boy had taken him right there, on that couch. The image was still vivid in his mind. Cas’ strong arms around his waist, the rough mark of his fingers on his thighs, his hoarse voice to spur him to meet his thrusts and get up again and again, impaling himself on his cock.
Overcoming his initial surprise, Dean turned towards him with a wide smile. He felt his cheeks flush slightly, like Cas', except he wasn't trying to hide it by turning his face away.
Dean was about to move his hand over his cock and come for the second time that night, but Castiel pulled it away.
He drove his thoughts away. "I don't think there'll be a second round, shower sex is complicated, isn't it?"
“He’s a good kid and he’s a fucking genius. He already knows what he wants to do with his life and I’m damn proud of him.”
He'd wanted to ask it and stay close to him until those blue eyes lit up again, but Cas moved away from him, and Dean couldn't find the courage. He only nodded at him and Cas closed the door.
At the third finger, Dean completely lost his mind and pushed his ass back trying to make those fingers reach even deeper. "Uh-uh," Castiel laughed softly at Dean’s desperate attempt and pinned his hips down.
Hades brings the scythe to touch his heart, it's a moment, the time of a breath and Dean dies. His body turns to stone and now nothing more shines in hell.
"All this to say that maybe, that angel's there after all." He met Cas' gaze, those blue eyes finally disarmed. They were beautiful, emotional, sincere.
"Anyway, if you really want to repay me for the damage, Dean,” Castiel's face came dangerously close to his. "I know better ways than money to make amends.”
He unzipped his pants and took hold of himself, slowly. He shuddered when his erection made contact with the air and he bit his lip to not let any sound out.
Discouraged, he threw himself into the bed only to get up the next second to answer his phone, which, ironically, had started to ring.
“Nothing new there. See you, Loosechester,” she said walking away. Dean laughed, then put his hand in his pocket.
Dean smiled. Maybe that was the worst hangover he'd ever had in years, and maybe the future encounters with Castiel would have been a little more embarrassing from now on, but Dean realized he’d have changed nothing about that night.
Castiel turned around to study the backseat. Dean saw out of the corner of his eye the boy smirking.
The Beatles played in the background. “Hey Jude” would have calmed him down. A few seconds and he relaxed completely on the seat, he closed his eyes and without realizing it, started to sing softly.
Dean smiled and then felt his heartbeat grow louder as Cas started to run a hand through his hair. From time to time the metal of Cas’s rings would tickle the warm skin of his cheeks.
On the first day, Cas pointed out that Dean still owed him a blowjob. Dean managed to pretend he wasn't the least interested for the first five minutes. Things changed quickly. He still remembered the weight of Cas' cock on his tongue, its taste, the frantic thrusts, the wild eyes, and the boy's destroyed expression as he pushed again and again in the heat of his mouth. In short, that day they found out that Dean on his knees for Cas was something both of them liked a lot.
“Are you really walking around with that thing on your neck?” He finished the question with a disgusted smile.
Cas had laughed heartily when reading the phrase 'kiss the cook' on the apron. Dean had smiled openly at him while saying 'So you'll have an excuse to kiss me.' Cas had laughed even louder at that, throwing his head back and baring the white skin of his throat, his shoulders slightly shaken with laughter.
Cas smiled at him, his white teeth sharp and uncovered like those of a shark. Needless to say, Dean was the fish.
“Hm, you still talk too much for my taste, sweetheart,” and with that, he spread his buttocks and sank a finger inside. Dean arched his back and Cas took the opportunity to play with his sensitive nipples. He then set an incessant rhythm and suddenly added a second finger, twisting it inside along the other. The burning sensation only served to fuel the desire.
The grip was firm but when he met his gaze, Dean saw that his eyes had softened and showed a similar vulnerability to when he'd taken him to the stand by the sea not long ago. His hair, however, remained wild, his bare chest drenched in sweat. Dean had an urge to lick it off, savoring the boy's salty skin under his tongue.
When the room fell silent, Dean realized he was alone at a college party, drunk in a bathtub and with his cock out. Perhaps it was time to review some of his life choices, especially those that had led him to that particular moment.
“Dean...fuck.” He dragged a hand through his hair. “I...” he sighed. “I did it all wrong with you, green eyes, didn’t I?”
Cas smiled at him and Dean kissed him passionately, his fingers gripping the black locks and his hands feeling the warmth of Cas' skin, the beat of his heart beneath his chest.
He got up from the couch and before Dean could protest, he loaded a tape and came back with a little book in his hands.
"Pornographic sounds? You could try to contain a bit of sexual tension, you two. We’re in a public place, after all.” Meg's voice was behind him and a slender arm twisted around his shoulders.
“Cas-Cas, I'm-" Cas gripped his own cock then and began to thrust relentlessly in his fist, desperate to seek release. His eyes were closed tight, his lips were parted wide, his breath hot and uneven on Dean's mouth.
Dean stood up, took his lunch bags, and was about to leave when Castiel grabbed his shoulder. "Where are you going?”
The boy smiled devilishly at him, winked and left as he had arrived, quietly and yet with everyone's attention.
Dean looked up and said his name in a pleading voice again and again as if it were a prayer. Castiel's tongue passed over his stomach and dipped into the curve of his navel. He bit down on the tender hips and Dean let out a groan.
Cas turned to him, looking surprised. He composed himself right after, masking every emotion on his face.
Hi! Sorry, I'm late, seeing how things are going, It'll be more likely for me to update once every two weeks.
He went without looking back, not making sure Dean followed. Maybe because he knew he wouldn't have to, Dean was already two steps away from him.
Since seeing him for the first time that day in the library, Castiel hadn't been able to think of anyone else. He’d asked around. The green-eyed boy's name was Dean Winchester and he was a first-year engineering student.
Dean considered himself a mature person. He still gave Cas an incredulous look as if to say ‘you’re one to talk’ and gave him the finger. In return, Castiel flashed him a smile that was all teeth.
"Oh, Novak, didn't know you were fuckin’ him. You could still share him, though. I mean, it ain’t the first time-"
He’d tried asking around at the university. At lunch, he'd snuck out into the backyard to see if Cas had shown up, but he hadn't seen him anywhere, not even with his friends...Dean would have to point out to Cas sooner or later what a bunch of assholes he was hangin’ out with...
"Oh, finally. You’re awake. How you doin’?" Benny walked into the room with a look of sympathy on his face. He put a glass of water and aspirin on the nightstand.
“Come on,” he said trying and failing to free himself from Cas' arm. For someone half asleep, he sure had a steel grip. “Caas.” The only answer was just another grunt.
That was the first revelation he’d had upon crossing the threshold to his apartment Saturday morning.  In fact, despite everything, he was feeling better than he had in a very long time.  You know, generally speaking.  He just didn’t care to analyze why that was.
“Is that supposed to make you less interesting?”  Aaron asked with a slight blush and a teasing smirk.
He popped the cap on the lube and squirted too much on his fingers, but he didn’t care.  He reached behind, wiggled two fingers inside himself in an attempt to be thorough, but decided he couldn’t take much more waiting.  He lubed up Dean’s cock with the excess and scooted himself further up into Dean’s lap.
When Dean came up to take his spot, Michael sneered. “Finally decided to join us, Winchester?”  He had a smug expression, and Dean didn’t really know what it was about him, but every time that kid talked he had an all-consuming desire to punch him in the face.
“What?” he practically hissed under his breath and Charlie mouthed back what looked like “Don’t be such a bitch.”
The young man simply chuckled like he hadn’t noticed a thing, or was pretending not to for Castiel’s benefit.  “It’s a date,” he said, retracting the paper from Castiel’s grip, something playing at the corners of his full lips.
Still snuffing his anger with disbelief, Dean skimmed over what he thought was sloppily thrown together prose, and read through Castiel’s margin notes on each page.  They weren’t overly complimentary, in fact most of them were pointing out his grammatical errors, of which Dean wasn’t surprised, but overall they were succinct and the summation at the end simply said, “Analysis needs improvement, but comprehensive of the subject matter overall and interesting, personal approach.”
He heaved a sigh and sat down on the couch in the small living room. It was crumpled and the patch was ruined. He opened a bottle of whiskey, he had only that and poured some liquid into the glass.
When he brought his thumb to stroke a nipple, Cas took a deep breath and began to move over him, frantically making their dicks meet.
Dean looked at her, gaping like a dying fish, then did a couple of mental calculations and realized those were Castiel's socks. Dean would strangle the boy with his own smelly socks.
He caught the boy greedily looking at the connection of their bodies. Cas stroked his thumb over Dean's hole, stretched around his cock and still damp from yesterday's lube.
He took the keys to the Impala. He'd go for a ride, driving baby had always calmed him down. He prayed it wouldn't be any different this time.
Cas chuckled and leaned his neck to rest on the back of the couch, perhaps the smoke was starting to kick in. "I know what you're thinkin', someone like me named after an angel is almost laughable."
He moved his hands to test the grip Cas had on his wrist and let out a groan when he felt the boy's hand tighten even more, fingers pressing into the skin. Cas pulled away and Dean tried to chase him, their lips still connected by a string of saliva.
He would have said more, but there were so many questions on his mind that he didn’t even know where to start.
“Anyway, you could have waited for me," Castiel said taking a bite out of a taco after dipping it in the extra spicy sauce, the all thing under Dean's astonished gaze.
Dean took a breath and looked at her seriously. "Charlie, I know, but it’s something stronger than me, I don’t—I can't stay away from him ok? I just can’t.”
His plan seemed to work because Cas laughed softly, shaking his head. Then, his hands began to move decisively on the white canvas and he began to draw as if he’d never quit.
He hated that Meg was right. That phone call made his desire for Dean even greater. He never expected the boy to actually call him, especially not on Halloween night and not being that drunk. Dean had managed to surprise him. Castiel hated things he couldn’t control and apparently, his desire for the freckled, green-eyed boy was one of them. So, that same day, when Castiel met Dean’s gaze during lunch break, he acted as nothing had happened. No winks, no mischievous smiles, no condescending gestures. Nothing.
Castiel's breath was immediately on his neck and the boy's chest molded to his back. “I said I’d take my time...” Dean swallowed and closed his eyes. “But I don’t think I can stand more foreplay right now, not with you lookin’ like this, ready under me.”
Castiel widened his eyes and kissed him even more fiercely. Dean could only succumb to him, as he’d done since the very start.
Dean swallowed the last piece of bread. “Cas, I already told you, I...I don’t expect anything, I just need what we have.”
Cas looked at him like he was about to take one of the kitchen knives and commit murder. Dean only felt slightly embarrassed. "Um, hi, I'm-"
For the first time, Charlie answered with a forced smile. “Dean, I’m sorry but I don’t really like to talk about it. There’s not much to say anyway.”
Then, finally, Cas grabbed the short hair at the base of his neck and crushed their mouths together.
His dreams were once again haunted by Castiel and the next morning he still seemed to remember the angelic taste of those lips.
Dean turned badly. The car scratched Castiel's motorcycle, emitting a screeching sound, and nearly crashed into the pavement.
He drove and drove with Led Zeppelin in the background and without even realizing it, he ended up parking in front of the beach where he and Cas had been.
Dean was mortified. He wanted to keep hiding his face under his scarf and pretending to be dead, but the more time went on the more he realized he was still on top of a poor soul.
They moved slightly away to catch their breath and Cas looked at him. Dean could see the effect his touch and kisses had on him. His cheeks were red, his plump lips swollen and glistening, his eyes dark.
Cas smirked. “You’re right, after all in that car we had some nice moments. We’ve known each other in the biblical sense, all night while-"
Cas said nothing, just stared at the mixtape Dean was holding like it was the most interesting thing in the world.
Cas chuckled, the sound making his skin hot. “My best quality,” he whispered while guiding a hand under Dean's shirt, then lower, to tease his erection.
It looked like he had been carved out of marble. He should probably be in a museum being revered as well.
Ken, that was a good nickname. Dean’s face was synonymous with perfection. His green eyes were large and emotional, his dark blond hair looked soft and Castiel wanted to run his fingers through it to find out, his jaw was sharp and his lips...Castiel would have wanted to draw the perfection that was Dean Winchester’s face over and over again until he’d have achieved a resemblance. He knew it would be impossible to paint him as he was.
Speaking of wonder... big shoulders, narrow waist, tight leather jacket around the biceps, jeans that wrapped muscular thighs. This was the sight that awaited Dean Winchester outside college on Monday morning.
Dean wished he could feel Castiel's skin under his, push him to orgasm with his own hands, finally know the taste of those lips.
The library finally fell silent, (or maybe it was just Dean's head) when around the corner came the most handsome boy he’d ever seen. The steps were firm, the black lines of tattoos contrasted on his tanned skin, his eyes thundering with deep blue, dark hair, defined cheekbones and sharp jawline.
Hands shaking, Dean pulled a mixtape out of his jeans pocket. It was a Led Zeppelin playlist which included his favorite songs.
The car windows started to fog and their breaths got heavy, then Dean screamed. Cas had found his prostate.
Dean cracked a smile. Then he fell back to the ground, his face down and his mouth eating sand. He felt a weight over his back and heard Cas laughing. He lifted his head from the sand and felt the weight disappear. Suddenly, a long tongue licked his face. "Oh for fuck's sake!" He tried to repair himself with his hands. "Gross!"
"Dean, time with you was...I'm glad you came, really...you...I ask, uh, just a little time. That's all." The blue eyes were dull, the smile forced.
For a moment, he was distracted by those who supposedly were Castiel’s friends. They didn’t seem too friendly, they already had a mocking look on their faces hearing him talking.
Dean felt himself being consumed, sinking into the desire and warmth that was Castiel's body. His rough hands, his long and strong fingers were like flames that danced on his skin, leaving indelible trails behind and Dean felt himself ruined, ruined for anyone but him.
Castiel stepped back from him and spanked his round ass. Dean jumped forward in surprise and yet visibly excited.
Castiel has built a reputation on campus, thanks to all his conquests, and his fame wasn’t for nothing. After all, he had slept with half the students, men and women alike. Castiel had kissed a lot of people in his life, buried himself in the heat of countless bodies, but no one seemed like Dean’s.
The two bumped fists and exchanged amused smiles. Then Charlie got more serious. “I know we don’t really know each other very well Dean, but you can talk to me, if you need to. I want you to know that.” She smiled openly at him.
Needless to say, after such a meeting, he managed to follow little or nothing in class. In the notebooks, instead of notes, a telephone number was written over and over again. If anyone had found those pages, they’d have locked him up in an asylum without asking questions first.
"Dean, go change first," Cas replied staring right at him, not even blinking. Dean blushed, remembering his condition and the fact he was still wearing Benny's apron.
His grip on Castiel’s hair got stronger, thrusting his dick even deeper in the heat of that gorgeous mouth.
Castiel raised an eyebrow. If he noticed the shiny eyes, he didn't show it. “Are you serious Freckles?"
He brushed his thumb over the back of Cas' hand and prayed the boy wouldn't freak out from the touch and pull away.
His face reddened at the thought and Cas seemed to notice, but fortunately he didn’t say anything. Instead, he stood silent and took the note out of Dean's hands, studying it.
Dean managed to wrest the arrogant smirk from the girl’s face, but his victory was short-lived because Meg’s eyes lit up again and she leaned forward on the table. “Oh, there’s nothing to be jealous of, little Dean-o. Believe me. I’m the one he called the other night. It’s my name he shouted while he fucked me in his-“
Cas didn't say or do anything to push his hands away, but then Dean smiled at him and his heart beat impossibly faster. Freckles scattered across his skin, his eyes green and vibrant, his lips red and puffy, the blond hair shining like gold in the sunlight. Castiel thought he saw an angel, one of those he hadn't painted in years.
“Shh! Don’t yell. It was years ago. As you know, I’ve always lived here. At the time, Castiel was new to school. We became friends and then, uhm...we drove apart...Anyway, point is, I know he won’t be here because at this time of the year he always goes to his family, in Illinois.”
Dean saw Cas’ eyes turn an even deeper blue, his slender, tattooed hands dancing softly on the canvas, his lower lip caught between his teeth, and his hair falling messily over his forehead. Dean watched him silently. His heart was pounding every time Cas met his gaze, and he was afraid that the loud noise of its beat would be heard all over the room.
When Castiel pulled away from her, he looked at him for a moment, his face unmoved, his eyes emotionless, as if made of stone.
Dean ran a hand through his hair. This time there wasn’t that fucking drink to help him find the courage. He was alone and sober and Dean Winchester didn’t do stupid shit without the influence of alcohol. Okay, maybe that wasn’t entirely true. Still.
Castiel grinned at him and then continued to mark his skin and muscles with the touch of his hand as if to memorize every part of his body.
"Little brother???" The two couldn't be more different, physical aside, from what he'd witnessed their personalities were about as compatible as oil and water.
Cas shrugged and his gaze wandered a bit as if searching for the answer in some of his papers scattered around the room. “It's not necessarily a light that never goes out that's highest. Dust and shadow, I can imagine it now, I can hear the cries of the arena, the men sitting before a fight whispering dust and shadow, dust and shadow, like a mantra." His blue eyes were more alive than ever and Dean was silent, watching in fascination a smile graze Cas' lips, listening to his words...suddenly it was as he said, it was like being there.
“-Yes, I know, you just keep saying it but don't ask me to pretend, Cas, don't ask me to pretend that I don’t give a fuck.”
Cas chuckled and the gravelly sound made his skin shiver. Looking at him, the boy’s eyes darkened with lust and he ran the tip of his fingers over Dean’s neck, where lingered the marks of the hickey he’d left him days ago. Dean could only watch, completely enraptured by the movement of those longs fingers on his skin. He gulped.
"Oh don't worry, Scarlett Joahnsson is still my wet dream. That doesn't mean I can't appreciate something aesthetically appealing, Dean.”
On Castiel’s uncovered wrist, he recognized the tattoo he’d glimpsed in the library. It was an angel fiercely raising a sharp sword, shedding blood from the eyes. Higher up, coiled around the arm, a snake.
“-I’d restrain your hands so that you couldn’t do a thing but watch quietly my head disappear between your legs.”
“Don't you dare keep quiet, green eyes. I want to hear every single sound you make. Now go on, move your hand. Slowly.”
"No, I guess I'm not..." He cleared his throat. "It's a phrase, an ancient one, as you may have got from the Latin words. I actually don't know why I had it tattooed, I-I just liked the idea, thought it was kinda poetic. In ancient Rome, gladiators used to say those words before going to fight."
Hades narrows his eyes, twisting his mouth in a grimace. "You know it's impossible for me to blush."
He didn’t know what he’d have done if the library hadn’t started filling with people. He’d probably have taken Dean right there against those shelves, making him scream with pleasure and pain to the point of losing his voice.
“They’re cute and mind their own business by not coming in people’s homes to annoy them. Now, do you want the bread, Winchester, yes or no?”
“There are more in my room. Drawings, paintings...all angels. They used to fascinate me, more than that actually. I used to have faith, in them.”
“Mechanical engineering. I can build a car from scratch, piece by piece. The passion for cars has always been with me and I don’t see why it shouldn’t also be in my future.”
The boy was also quick to shed his boxers and pants, then the shirt followed and Dean found himself naked as well, his skin clinging to the fabric of the couch. Cas’ warm breath was immediately close to his ear. "Now, baby boy, I want you to fuck me like you mean it, okay?"
He had already taken off his shirt and Dean’s hands eagerly explored the uncovered skin, traced the ribs, the black marks of the tattoos, the shoulder muscles.
“Bullshit. Let’s go,” he said so and walked away, not turning to check if the girl was following him.
Dean had only pity for the man trying to do his job in the stand behind them. But Cas didn't seem to share his concern, for he suddenly invaded his space until warm breath tickled his ear.
He leaned his head against the door, breathing deeply. "While you're at it why don't you piss on me?”
Dean looked down and he was done for. Those blue eyes were pointed seductively at him, bright in the shadows of the car, the messy hair clenched in his finger, spit and pre-cum on the sides of swollen lips. The image of the boy in that condition was enough to make him come, hard, and Castiel swallowed every last drop as Dean's vision filled with black dots.
Castiel's door was open and he was leaning nonchalantly against the doorframe. He was smoking. It had been so long since Dean had seen him with some weed, that he believed he'd quit.
Suddenly, Cas arched his fingers and Dean felt overwhelming pleasure running through his whole body. He screamed.
Maybe talking wasn’t exactly the term...The third time he called, with three fingers buried deep in his ass and Castiel's voice urging him on, Dean managed to cum in less than three minutes.
Castiel...sometimes he wished he'd never made that call, never got closer to that boy. Part of him, his wounded pride probably, hated the fact that he’d fallen into the net like everyone else. Another drove him to seek out those blue and haunted eyes again and again. It probably was the part of him that had realized he fell in love.
He took them with him and threw them in the bag. He would have asked around where Cas lived to return them, absolutely not because he was already missing him like crazy.
The two burst out laughing as they looked at each other. The sound of their laughter mixed with Miracle's barking.
⚠️**I have to remind u to read carefully the tags and warnings, this story deals with heavy themes that not everybody might enjoy.**
Dean pretended he hadn't heard that and leaned over to pat the dog. He had no collar, his bones protruded beneath the pile of fur and he was trembling slightly from the cold, his eyes empty and sad. It was truly a miracle to have found him, Dean certainly wouldn't leave him there or abandoned him alone in a kennel.
Yet, Dean felt himself quiver and his insides burn, thinking about what had happened the night before. It’d been a long time since he’d felt such strong emotions and they haven't even seen each other, not even touched yet. Dean couldn't imagine what it would be like to feel the warmth of those rough hands on his body and that gravel voice whispering the filthiest promises in his ear.
When he turned his gaze away, he realized Gabriel was looking oddly at him, something like surprise on his face.
Dean smiles weakly at him. "I give life and I more than anyone know how important it is that there's also death."
Maybe it was the voice in which Cas said it, sincere and broken, maybe it was the leg next to his that was shaking all the time, but Dean couldn’t ignore it. So he turned to him and met his gaze, mirroring himself in the depth of those blue eyes.
He watched curiously Cas opening the door and immediately heard the chirpy voice of a man on the other side.
It had been a long time since Castiel had spent an afternoon like this, talking and joking with someone without wearing a mask, without pretending to want to be there.
"That's what it says." He pointed to the Enochian writing, the one that followed the line of the left pec.
Dean dropped his head back as Castiel finally, finally slipped a hand into his pants to cup his member. Dean let out moans of pleasure, interrupted only by the demanding kisses, as Castiel's rough hand worked him with firm, fast thrusts. Then, those skilled fingers suddenly released their grip on his cock and the heat of Castiel's body went away.
Dean confidently smirked at him and Cas threw the shirt in his face. Dean hoped (or maybe not, to each his own kinks) that Cas hadn't already used it to clean himself.
His mood changed as soon as he took notice of Cas’ face. His sapphire eyes seemed lost gazing at the ocean, his hair was slightly blown by the wind, his jaw was relaxed and his lips parted.
"We-" Cas gestured pointing a finger first at Dean and then at himself. “-We're not in a relationship and this isn't a date.”
Dean looked at his cell phone and smiled to himself. “Benny, would ya lend me your apron? The one that says kiss the cook.”
Dean's muscles relaxed and he leaned back exhausted against the shelves, the books pointing annoyingly at his back.
"Don't look at me like that. I never use them, I can't cook for shit. The only thing I can cook is bread and honey."
Castiel went completely out, and Dean was about to complain when Cas buried himself again inside his body and set up a brutal pace, pounding mercilessly into him.
“Dam it, Cas. My heart can’t stand this shit any longer, we should put you a bell around that neck”, he said slurring a few words, his cheeks still full.
“Do you want a date, green eyes? You should work on expressing yourself, less fuck and asshole. Try with...darling.”
"Let me finish," Dean smiled softly at him and playfully punched him on the shoulder. He then placed his head on the boy's chest.
Instead of apologising right away, Dean got lost for a while admiring those blue eyes, the unruly hair, the sharp line of the cheekbones. The boy had the same shred-leather jacket he’d seen him wearing in the library.
The perpetually amused expression vanished from Gabriel's face. His eyes hardened and his lips became a thin line. “We have to talk, whether you like it or not. I can even do it in front of the kid, It's up to you." Castiel's eyes widened and his hands clenched into fists.
"My father...,” he looked at the ceiling, pausing a little. The eyes hazy, the dark strands falling messily, the lips hanging open to exhale white swirls of smoke...“He was a great lover of the Bible, of God and his angels. Whether for his studies or faith I have no idea. I don't know what was going on through that man's head,” he said, his voice rougher than usual.
Dean had been looking at his phone without doing anything for over half an hour now. He was sitting on the floor in the living room, cell phone in his hands, his gaze fixed on the screen and his legs gangrenous. If he ever got up, he'd have probably needed a wheelchair, which was a shame, because certain activities, those that included Castiel for example, would have a bit more difficult to practice.
He closed the door to his bedroom, leaving Dean sitting in the living room, alone with his own thoughts.
Castiel clenched his jaw and fixed Dean with a threatening look that nearly made him cream his pants.
His breath stopped and he looked at Castiel in alarm. In response, the other boy spread his legs gently, his fingers pressing on the skin of his inner thighs. Then he crawled between the opening of his legs and leaned his chest against him.
“We are in a university library, so, yes, already. I remind you that you were the one begging me on your knees and telling me- "
Castiel was alone, listening to Metallica with his headphones. It was still early in the morning and he’d recently come back from Illinois. He hated that place. It forced him to face reality and it was getting harder and harder to pretend he didn't care about his life. It was getting harder and harder to look Gabriel in the eye.
"And you are?" The blond said, leaning his arm against the doorframe as clearly interested eyes studied his body from top to bottom.
They arrived at the party when it had already begun. People were shouting and laughing. Some were drinking, others were dancing to the beat of the music and Dean saw people already being busy and forgetting entirely the meaning of public decency.
His face didn't have time to catch fire thinking back to Friday night, that Castiel's eyes turned cold.
“Can't make any promises,” he said with a shrug, face scrunched, eyes half-squinting against the sun.
Bringing a hand up to cradle Castiel’s face, Dean takes him in fully now.  “Cas, I- I never got to tell you then.”
Just as suddenly, he couldn’t breathe at all and things were starting to go dark, like really fucking dark, and it had only just occurred to him again that he didn’t have any fucking legs, and even if he did, he never learned how to swim.
“I should probably shower first,” he says, hanging his damp shirt by a hanger. “Between you and me, I think Flipper was getting a bit too friendly with me earlier on that dive.”
There was a tenuous moment where nothing happened. The click and snap of the lubricant bottle filled the silence and the squelch of cold, wet lubricant against his rim sent a tingle up his spine.
Dean breathed out a laugh and shook his head, he really was getting out of shape sitting on the couch eating cheese curls for the last few weeks.  “It’s been brought to my attention that this whole thing was a set-up.  Were you hip to all this?”
Reaching for his clipboard, Ash scanned over the sheet for the name ‘Damien’, squinting to see through the red light.  “You got two.  Congrats, amigo.”
“First time, actually.  Not for lack of trying,” Castiel mused with a chuckle.  Balthazar never shut up about this place since it opened at the beginning of the year.  He could see the appeal now that he was here; it was nice, if not a little too much everything.  “It’s awfully… clean,” he added, for lack of a better word.
Once fully slicked himself, he wiped the remainder along the crack of Dean’s awaiting ass and smirked when Dean whimpered even at this.  He was always incredibly responsive, but tonight he seemed especially so.
“Listen,” Charlie shouted close to Castiel’s ear, her hand gripping the bend of his elbow, “I’m gonna go get us some drinks, okay?  Don’t go anywhere!”
But John only grunted an affirmative as he continued to do a half-assed job at cleaning down the kitchen.  For the moment, Dean could breathe, but he didn’t let it linger.  Hesitantly, he broached the elephant in the room.
“Aw c’mon, it’s better than I could do at least.”  Dean untied the flannel around his waist and shrugged it over his shoulders, but not before Castiel noted the goosebumps raising on his forearms.
Eyes never leaving his, Castiel brought his free hand to his lips, sucked two long fingers into his mouth, and led them down to encircle his hole.  He pressed the tip of a finger in and had to bite his lip to contain himself as it slipped in deeper.
“Oh, fuck,” Dean whined, teeth gripping his lower lip to fight off another sound at the sight of those pink lips wrapped around him.
True to his word, Balthazar arrived outside Castiel’s apartment door in just under ten minutes.  Castiel groaned as he got to his feet to let him inside, but once Balthazar was assuredly heading up the stairs, he made his way back over to the couch, pathetically slumping into the cushions.  Balthazar came through the door carrying a bottle of high-end reserve wine.  How he had time to stop for that, Castiel will never know.
When they come to the door, Cas pulls out his wallet and rifles through for the room key. “Are you tired?” he asks, gaze focused resolutely on the task at hand.
“Oh, god, leave it to anyone but Crowley—” He was being shushed over the line again.  He bit his tongue, albeit painfully.
“Their eyes,” he asserted at the end.  “That’s how you’ll know.  They change.  They’re not human, they look like you and me, but they’re not like us at all.  You can only see them if you’re looking for them, but you’ll know when you do.”
“Oh, hell no.  I’m drivin’ home.  You drive like a blind person goin’ to church at night.  I’d like to make it to Lebanon some time today, Grandma.”
Another pained whimper caught in Dean’s throat as he pulled away from the kiss, mouth agape against Castiel’s, breath hot against his skin at the feeling.  His breathing hitched against Castiel’s jaw.
Dean let out one brief, bitter laugh and shrugged.  “I know what I saw, Charles.  They’re a thing.”  Darling.  Pressing his back against the bricks, he let his head fall back with a dull thud, watching the blinking cursor on the screen, and then glancing back to Charlie’s over-invested expression.  She looked like she was about to shit rainbows or something.  “Why are you so happy about it?”
Before he could reply, Dean’s mouth captured his again in a searing kiss.  The feeling was heady and, with the insistent warmth pressing against his cock, Castiel opened for him easily.  His hands slid up to cup Dean’s sharp jaw as he licked into his mouth.  It struck him then, he’d always been drunk for this.  Even now, despite not having a drop to drink, he was starting to feel a little drunk on the feeling.  In some desperate way, he needed this, needed Dean, more than he was ready to admit to himself while being this sober.
Let’s be real, he was watching it for Matt Brody just as much.  What could he say?  He was a sucker for dark hair and light eyes and that guy had both in spades.
But Dean craved more.  And just for the fact he asked at all, Dean lifted his head to give a flimsy nod, the feeling unsteady on his neck.
Cas blushes and scratches the hairs on the back of his neck and Dean just snorts to himself and fills his face with more pizza. “Um, we’ll tell you when you're older, Jack,” answers Sam, awkwardly. Sam levels Dean with a glare just for making him have to deal with this whole thing in the first place.
The cashier smacked his gum as Cas held out the crumbled bills and change.  They dropped onto the conveyor belt with a ping and the cashier’s face read unimpressed. “You’ll have to put something back then,” he suggested, motioning to the next person in line.
Dean cleared his throat after they drank.  “Actually, I’d like to make another toast...  To Cas, for saving my life, I guess.”  He gave a sheepish smile.  “I don’t know where I’d be without you.  Probably dead, or worse.”
He blushed then, suddenly embarrassed about how reckless he always seemed to be around this man, and flexed his sore fingers.  “Yeah, I guess I should explain that too.”
“Understatement.”  Castiel groaned and rubbed at his bleary eyes.  “There’s a reason all my classes are scheduled in the afternoon.”  He slid his palm under the hem of Dean’s oversized t-shirt to rest on the small of his back.  The skin there was warm and welcoming.
Aaron was fumbling his way through a rather pathetic offer to take Dean across the green to grab coffee from the cafeteria.  Dean seemed to hesitate at Aaron’s offer, turning it over in his mind as he heaved the heavy strap of his bag higher on his shoulder, until he gave a breathy, “Sure, okay, why not?”
There was the sound of someone fumbling with something on the other end of the call.  A tissue box, he realized once there was a soft trumpeting of someone blowing their nose.  Castiel furrowed his brow and waited.
Just then, there was a knock at his office door.  Three quick raps of a knuckle and it faded to white.
To everyone's relief Cas actually passes a turn, but then that motherfucker Jack swoops in with some bullshit word.
Someone was calling his name, but it sounded a lot more like a drunk “Deeaannnnn!”  High pitched and piercing.
Cas rolled his eyes.  “No,” he sighed. “But I- I’ve never ‘celebrated’ Valentine’s Day,” he said, complete with finger quotes.  “This is my first one, I suppose, and I guess I was curious what it is you humans do to… well, celebrate.”  The smile spreading across Sam’s face only grew to irritate him.
The first time it happened, it could have been brushed off as merely an accident.  A weakening of wills, succumbing to their baser instinct.  But one could repent and dole out their Hail Mary’s and one could be forgiven as if it never happened at all if they really meant it.
“...No,” Dean said, eyebrows screwing up, “What are you even still doing with her anyway?  She’s bad fucking news.”
“I don’t know yet, it’s too early to tell.  I’d wanted to tell you a couple weeks ago when I missed my period, but I wasn’t sure how, and then with the new project at work you haven’t been around much, and well, I wanted to make sure it would stick this time--”
,” Dean griped. “Please don’t make me wear this thing that long. I want it, Cas. Want you. I wanna be good for you. You know I do. I just— want you so bad sometimes I can’t wait. I won’t fuck it up again, I swear.”
According to the clock, it’s 7:03AM.  Dean’s not really surprised that Sam hasn’t come knocking yet, only because they didn’t get in until late last night, but it’s not like he can pretend to just go back to sleep either.  He wasn’t asleep in the first place.  And Cas knows that, which is why when Dean tosses him a cursory glance over his shoulder, he’s giving Dean that look.  You know, the one where he’s resting his chin on his thumb, one finger pressing into his cheek, with an expectant eyebrow lifted in the air.  That look.  But Dean hopes Cas knows him enough not to press yet, so he thanks whatever absent god is listening up there for the present silence.  Cas can sniff out whatever lies he wants, as long as he doesn’t call Dean on them before he’s at least had his morning coffee.
“I’m bi, actually.  Thanks for askin’.”  Dean grinned like a brat as he bit into his apple, hoping it would hold him over till his shift at the Roadhouse later.  He was practically dreaming of a free cheeseburger.
Pushing the door open on its hinges, Castiel stood there in the doorway, but this time Dean was there too, sat in his padded chair with his legs kicked up on the edge of his desk.  A smug, knowing grin spread across his face in greeting when he looked up from the textbook he was pretending to read.
The music on the speakers upstairs switched over.  This was the end of the line, so to speak, and Castiel had bought the last dance of the night.  Technically all Castiel was doing right now was preventing Dean from going home, but he couldn’t let the night end here.  Not on this note.
The apartment resembled something like a three ring circus what with all the absolute fucking clowns that have come parading through the front door.  There was sweater vest guy, the guy with the snake tattoo, the guy that looked like he belonged to the yacht club in the middle of Kansas, the art school dork, the pretentious musician, and now from the sounds of it some smarmy British guy.  Those are the few he could list off the top of his head anyway.  And Dean’s played his part of being unseen and unheard to the best of his ability, even invested in the damn headphones just to be respectful, but he’s tired now. He’s fucked out without even getting fucked himself. This is how he knows there must really be something to this whole gay thing though because he knows this apartment is shit, and he knows the walls are practically made of paper, but he’s never heard anything come close to the obscene sounds coming out of his friend right now when he was fucking Sister Christian, or granola girl, or that goth bitch Meg.  These sounds are different.  These sounds are filthy and raw and…
“Have a nice weekend, Professor,” the young man said, practically beatific, not waiting around for a response.  He slapped a palm on the door frame as a parting gesture before leaving altogether.
“I didn’t need to!  I know you better than you know yourself, Bal.  It was never going to work, not when I don’t feel that way towards you.  We are friends, colleagues, but I can’t be anything else for you, and I think you know that, despite whatever it is you keep trying to pull.  My answer is never going to change.  I don’t know how many times I can make myself clear to you!”
“You come here often, mate?  I’ve never seen you here before,” Mick said.  He was leaning into Castiel’s space, his elbows planted on the bar while he waited for the bartender to come back.
The second Chuck started trying to puzzle together the side of Dean’s face he looked away.  Dean absently watched the burgers cooking on the grill until Jo came pushing through the swinging door like her ass was being chased with a chainsaw.  “Whoa, where’s the fire?”  She didn’t answer and ran towards the emergency exit leading to the dumpsters.  As soon as the top half of her was out the door, she was leaning over the step heaving next to the trash can.  She waited a few minutes in case she wasn’t finished, but when she seemed certain she wasn’t going to hurl again she closed the door and leaned against it looking pale with a thin sheen of sweat on her upper lip.  “What the hell, Jo?  You tryin’ to fertilize the garbage or something?”
“The Dean that you know is a spineless milksop who wouldn't know his ass from his elbow,” he spat in defiance, “Besides, I never intended to harm the child, I was merely trying to cut him out.”  His harsh tongue emphasized the ‘T’s.
“Just calculating how many years in prison I’ll get for murdering John Winchester with my bare hands.”
“Hey, Sammy,” said Dean, attempting to feign happiness.  “It can’t be that late, why you sleepin’ already?”
He wouldn’t lie; he was fucking terrified of what he might be like upon waking, but he tried again, voice as gentle as ever.  “C’mon, Cas... Please get up.  Please.”
And Castiel had blindly returned to Dean Winchester’s home for the first time since the last, but when he got there he hadn’t been primed for any of it.  The way Dean’s blackened eyes seemed to darken even further whenever Castiel stepped nearer.  Dean hadn’t been violent towards him though, so Castiel suspected that just maybe, despite all evidence to the contrary, he was simply ill.  Some form of brain sickness that could be the result of any number of things.  It wouldn’t be so unheard of, he thought, and he’d advised Sam to telephone the local physician for a mental health evaluation and that would put an end to that.
Charlie’s answering groan turned into a small smile.  “You could always just try flashing Professor Novak your goods and not even worry about the paper,” she said, smothering a laugh with the palm of her hand.
“So is that why you never get any?” he snarked to the front seat, adjusting himself in his pants.  “Thought it was just your personality that deterred everyone, didn’t realize it was a hard rule.”
Just then, a matted orange cat slinked between the furniture and hopped up on the table by the door to eat from one of the set out food dishes.  A low growl emitted from the furry beast.  Blinking suspiciously at Castiel and the other man.  The cat twitched its tail before deciding he was worthy of ignoring altogether.
They move on to the next room. More of the same. Papers, cobwebs, dust. They go through two more offices like that. Checking desk drawers and doing quick sweeps.
Wordlessly, Dean jerked his head to refute it.  “No,” he said, “No, it’s not.  You were right, Cas.”
Something was warring behind Dean’s expression and his lips parted and closed like he couldn’t decide whether to voice it or not.  Ultimately, he did.  Voice going softer, he said, “I actually... I blamed you for a while.  For my bad mood that night.  For letting you get in my head.  And then that night at the Roadhouse, when you… when you grabbed my wrist.  The guy he--”  Dean forced the words back down with a dry swallow, mouth like sandpaper.  Castiel tracked his free hand coming up to rub his throat as though he were reliving past torments, but it was gone just as quick.  “I mean, it’s not my first rodeo.  Hell, probably not even my last.  I was just- I was stupid.  Plain and simple.  I was ignoring my gut cuz I wanted his money.”
The restroom was the first place he checked.  It was empty, minus one man in obnoxiously plaid pants that startled the second Castiel came stumbling through the door.  “You're not my friend,” he said more for himself than the other man.
Sam turns his sights on Cas who is now sitting precariously on the end of one of the full size beds, hands clasped together.  Not quite in prayer, but more like an overly proper house guest.  “Are you sure you didn’t see anything?  I mean, I get it.  It’s Dean’s head, privacy is important.  Besides, I probably wouldn’t want to see half the stuff that goes on in there…” Sam trails off with a disgruntled shake of his head, but comes to again, “But I don’t know, just, are you sure you didn’t see anything?  If neither of you have ever seen it before then what the hell could it be?”
“Alright, that’s it,” Dean seethes, slamming his pen against the pages of his splayed notebook.  He tears his headphones off and throws open the door to his own room, stomping the few feet down the hall to Cas’ door.  This isn’t the first time tonight he’s interrupted to tell them to shut up either, but this time he finds himself banging on the thing like a house on fire without having thought of what to actually say once it opens.  Though that doesn’t seem to be a problem because the next thing flying out of his face is a startled, “Jesus fucking Christ, Cas!”
He thought back further to before, remembering the museum bench.  The heat between their thighs pressed close.  It felt more intimate than the day Castiel had appeared on the sofa at the club.  How that was possible through layers of denim, Dean didn’t know, but he’d gotten up anyway for that exact reason.  And then he saw the drawing on the other side of the room.  It felt like it was pulling him across the floor by magnets.  Madonna and Child.  The mother Mary and her infant son.
Dean swiveled his head and heaved an exaggerated sigh at the request. “Yeah, fine, but you fuckin’ owe me, Ash!  I’ve driven your ass around at least five times this week.  So either pay up or you’re buyin’!”
Patting down Castiel’s drenched pockets, Dean came up with a soggy wallet, a dead phone, and a prescription pill bottle that rattled in his shaking hands.  It was too dark to read the bottle, but he recognized the name ‘Nancy Novak’ on it with little to no problem.  He grabbed for the phone first and tried to turn it on to no avail.  It wasn’t a reach that his own phone was probably no better off.  Digging through the billfolds in the wallet, Dean hoped to find a phone number he could call, anything really, anyone better than the scum he came here with, but all he actually found was twenty bucks, an expired condom, and loose change.
“Technically, I was here first so you’re the one that’s out here sitting with me,” he countered, brow raised.
Dean doesn’t have any trouble imagining that. Mostly because he’s had to listen to it all in Dolby Digital surround sound for the last month, but also because Cas is really easy to look at, even when he’s as ruffled and angry and in Dean’s face as he is right now. Maybe especially then.
The only answer he gets from Rowena however is a prissy pout and a raised eyebrow.  “If I found something, Samuel, don’t you think I would have shared it with the class?” she snips.  “Magick takes time.  Powerful magick takes even longer.  You’ll do well not to ask questions.”
Cas snaps out of his train of thought before it consumes him and swallows dryly.  His lips fall open, searching for an answer to Sam’s question.  One that can help.  One that isn’t an apology or a dismissal.  But he isn’t thinking of anything particularly useful, not unless Sam is curious about the dark freckle Dean has on his inner thigh.  “I’m sorry, Sam,” is all he can say.  “If I think of anything of import I won’t hesitate to share, but otherwise, most of what I saw I don’t believe Dean would be comfortable with my sharing.  It’s not my place.”  Cas purposely leaves out his place in the entire ordeal.
Sliding a hand into his pocket, skin damp and pocket damper, Castiel pulled out his phone.  It wasn’t as if he were actually expecting to receive a text or a phone call from Balthazar.  Knowing him, he was already over the entire situation and found someone in the bathroom to keep warm for the night.  Castiel wouldn’t be the one to apologize.  He had nothing to be sorry for.  He meant what he said and he needed to stick to his convictions.
He should have presumed Dean would still be angry.  The fight hadn’t left him.  It was simmering just under the surface waiting to pounce.  The ever-present vigilance of a soldier waiting for a fight.  He reminded Castiel of David, though the only weapon Dean had in his arsenal here was his sexuality.  That would make himself Goliath, Castiel noted idly.  After tonight, he had little trouble believing he’d been the villain all along.
“I’ll text you about the Art History paper later so we can screw it up together.”  Walking backwards, she gave him a Star Trek salute, which Dean returned to the best of his abilities, before she continued down the sidewalk.  Dean just shook his head with a fond smile as he opened the entrance.
“Hannah, what are you doing?” he groaned as she tugged at his tie and slid it off.  She went for his belt buckle next, sly smile never leaving her face.
“I thought I might lay the cards on the table,” Balthazar continued, “That is, before I made my appeal for a better research partner.”
The rustling of paper started up again, envelopes being strewn across the slide of the tabletop.  The creaking of a chair as John got to his feet and pulled out the junk drawer by the refrigerator, the one that always stuck a little on the first try, as his father went through that too.  Apparently, whatever he was looking for wasn’t in there either.
“I’m your best friend, of course I get to have an opinion.  This beer is awful by the way.”  He kept drinking it anyway.  “Why are you flipping, Cassie?  There’s plenty of fish in the sea!”
“Shit,” he panted out.  His cheeks were flushed from exertion or embarrassment as he realized his error.  “Sorry,” he murmured almost shyly, as he scrambled for the tissues on the side table.  He did his best to clean the front of Castiel’s lap, but Castiel just giggled.
“Oh, yeah?”  Thrusting the bulge in his jeans against her lap, he asked lowly, “How nice do I have to be?”
“I want you to look me in the eye and tell me you didn’t do something so completely and utterly foolish,” he demanded.  “And please, for the love of God, Castiel, do not try to lie to me.”
“Mmh.” Carefully, Castiel folded up his pocket knife and slipped it back into his boot.  “Well, newsflash, Jockstrap. Unlike you, I don’t care what Ms. Barnes thinks and I really can’t stand you. So… What’s in it for me?”
They’d done much better on the chiaroscuro assignment, he thought to himself as he slurped the last drop of chamomile tea from his mug.  It was a cheesy one someone gave him at an office Christmas party once.  Secret Santa.  The Mona Lisa with a scribbled beard, or something.  Castiel had no doubt in his mind it was from Balthazar.  It was also his second cup of tea and he couldn’t hold it anymore.  He’d held it simply because the custodian had barred off the basement bathroom for cleaning, but they had to have been done by now.
Curiously, his head tilted in that slightly endearing way it had most of the evening.  “Dean?  What is it?”
“What was that?  What the fuck just happened?” gasps Dean on his hands and knees, interspersed through wet coughs.
“Nah, Cas, we’re good,” Dean said, “Diner food sounds pretty good right about now, actually.”  He stood and drained his coffee, placing the mug beside Castiel’s in the sink.  “Did you, uh, want to come with us?  To the diner, I mean?”
When Dean’s beer is drained and Cas’ takeout container is picked clean, Cas let’s out an enormous yawn and Dean has to fight the one he feels buried just below the surface.  Cas gets up to get ready for bed and Dean can’t help himself. He’s been thinking about it for the last hour now and he’s got to know.
Dean ends up holing himself up in his room after raiding the contents of the fridge for more beer.  This kind of thing is the exact reason why he hates board games.  He lost and ended up leaving the table feeling like the world’s biggest loser, regardless of how he got there.  It's not sulking, but it's pretty close.
Castiel spoke English.  At least, he was pretty sure, but he was having trouble listening, watching instead the fascinating way his friend’s mouth was moving upside down.  Unless Crowley was speaking a different language that Castiel suddenly understood now too...
Castiel was already heading across the street when Dean got out of the car to follow after him.  “Cas, wait up!”  He looked both ways before he crossed the street and jogged up to him on the sidewalk.
He waited for what felt like... too long.  Minute upon minute passed without any sign of Dean.  Maybe they were bickering again, he figured.  His fingers were going numb so he stuffed them into his pants when distantly there was a crash and a shatter  that came from somewhere inside the home.
“Look, pal, I don’t know what you think this is, but it ain’t that kind of place.  I don’t do that.”
“No, I mean, dude didn’t seem to be in the chatty kind of mood.  He basically dismissed me before I even set foot in his stupid office.”
Dean pretended to consider the jab seriously, lips turning down in the corners.  “No, not really,” he said, “Still working on World Peace, but I’ve always considered myself kind of a renaissance man.”  He grinned and turned to face him then, slipping his wallet and keys into his jacket pocket.  “Sooo.. how do I look?”
“Yeah. I, uh, didn’t sleep.  Not really,” Dean admitted.  “Was thinkin’ too hard, I guess.”  He let out a sigh and took another long sip of coffee.  “Been doin’ that a lot lately, to be honest.”
Castiel shut his eyes and breathed to calm himself, but just the idea of the woman calling him James had him shrinking.  Even the sound of his own first name was grating against his nerves and she hadn’t even come to the door yet.
Castiel approached him from behind, slipping on his pair of white boxers over his hips.  “PB&J sounds perfect,” he replied, settling his hips to lean against the counter.  A warm expression coloring his features.
“Oh, could ‘one’?  How convenient for you.”  Glowering at him from across the room, Dean angled himself to lean against the wooden frame of the door like he was giving himself an out, arms wrapping against his chest protectively.  Castiel could respect that.  He hadn’t left yet, afterall.  He was still willing to listen.  “Well, what the hell are you waiting for, an invitation?  Let’s hear it.”
He heard her give an acknowledgement outside the door, “Good evening, Professor Roche.”  Castiel was alone for barely a minute before Balthazar slipped into his office, not bothering to knock.  Balthazar wordlessly took the seat across from his desk with the ripped leather cushion as he usually did because he claimed it was actually comfortable.  He crossed his legs and stared at Castiel over the desk.  Castiel afforded him one glance before returning to his analysis of the students drawing in front of him instead.  He looked like he was gearing up to watch a soap drama unfold before his very eyes.
Sam sighs.  “Sometimes doing what’s best for someone requires lying,” he says after a moment.  “Lying isn’t good, Jack, so I don’t want you to think it’s the right way to do things… Just sometimes, if your intentions are good, it’s best to leave out parts of the truth.  Especially when it comes to Dean because he’s stubborn as hell.”
Castiel huffed a sleep-weary sound.  Something like a laugh.  “I’m not so sure about that, but I’ll see you soon.”
“Right,” Dean gulped, awkwardly scrambling to right himself.  There was no denying the fact his blood had been flowing south for the majority of his meal and it was no thanks in part to the rapt way Cas had been eyeing him for most of it.  He didn’t know about all the aphrodisiac stuff and he doubted it worked through osmosis, but if Cas wanted to do him and this holiday right, Dean was in no position to argue.
“I’m sorry, but I’m not sure what you’re talking about.  You must have me mistaken for someone else.”  Fight or flight, so they say.
That wasn’t the route Dean was expecting to go down, but he took the out anyway and suddenly he was feeling even more grateful than he’d ever been to have Charlie as his friend.
It wasn’t a long drive across town.  Castiel watched the barren trees planted along the curbs as they traveled through suburban back roads.
Dean righted himself only to shoot Benny a withering glare. “Oh you mean the time I lost my v-card to Lisa Braeden in the backseat of my dad’s Impala and all you fuckin’ assholes decided to open the door right when I blew my load?  Huh, I dunno.  Vaguely rings a bell."  That was one memory he definitely tried to push into the far recesses of his mind.  Well, the Benny part, not the Lisa part.  She’d been really bendy and forgiving.  And Dean really missed that damn car all of a sudden.
The guy’s face turned a similar shade of beet red to the painting in front of them and just then, out of the corner of his eye, Dean saw Sam and Jess excitedly approaching the two of them with actual amused grins on both their faces.  “Cassie!!” squealed Jess, and when they got closer, she flocked to the blushing guy, throwing her arms around his neck and smacked an overzealous kiss to his cheek.  “This is Sam’s brother Dean, but I can see you two have already met!”
“Oh for fucksake. You’re jealous!” Kevin supplies easily, as if he didn’t just hit Dean over the head with a sledgehammer.
The night felt like it was dragging, but at least Crowley let him do a solo; he always made more when he did solos.  Like paying for a front page ad, or taking a test drive.  They always got the customers shelling out.  He knew he did well tonight too.  He was still riding on the coattails of his earlier adrenaline, but for now: he was waiting.  Biding time until he got that tell-tale knock on the door.
They decided to hit Wendy’s house early in the hopes that they could get back on the road and head home after lunch, but when Sam tried her phone number back at the motel, it only kept ringing.
“Stop,” Castiel said through gritted teeth.  The knife traveled its way to land underneath the crook of his throat.  Steeling himself, he foolishly said, “If you’re going to kill me, just do it.”
Cas’ gaze is sharp and Dean’s hesitant to hold it for too long out of fear.  Just as Dean is about to dribble out some poorly manufactured excuse, there's a solid knock on the motel room door that can only be interpreted as none other than Sam.  Dean releases his held breath in a long, drawn out exhale and ducks his chin to excuse himself out from under Cas’ microscope.  Swinging the door open, he’s greeted by Sam and Jack carrying their duffles and a couple extra steaming coffees for himself and Cas.  They must have checked out at the desk and had time to run for coffee.  “Ugh, thank god.” Dean groans reaching for the warm cup Sam's holding out.  “Saved by the bell,” he mutters around the mouth of the lid before taking a slow sip to really savor that backwash flavor.
“Hey, Cas.” His lips curl up in a seductive smile, his green eyes shine and Hades' stomach twists. There was an expression...men use it often...having butterflies in the stomach. Hades never understood it, but if he were to associate it with anything, he would do it for this moment, no, for every time he sees Dean come up to him and say his name, his real name.
Castiel was on him in a moment, and Dean tried not to be overwhelmed by the intoxicating scent, the deep blue of those eyes, the power of his presence.
Castiel held his palm up and Dean shut his mouth.  “Dean, it’s not a problem.  I was simply going to ask your brother if he preferred the couch or the bed.  You two look as though you could use the sleep more than me.”
Castiel turned his gaze to some foggy middle point in the center of Dean’s chest, murky resolve soaking his features.  “Nothing, I suppose.  You don’t owe me an explanation; I know I haven’t earned the right given my recent behavior.  I’m simply concerned for your safety.”  His eyes flashed to Dean’s again to collect whatever unreadable expression Dean knew he was doling out.
This was the first time Dean wouldn’t be there for the bad ones and that feeling of guilt was gnawing at him more than it ever had, but that was its own can of worms entirely, and certainly not one that Aaron or Charlie needed to crack open, so he decided to stuff his face in lieu of talking.
The second was just as nefarious as the first, but there was no way to twist it into an altogether prettier picture.  Intentional or not, it happened, and Castiel wasn’t sure Hail Mary’s applied to people like them anymore.
Honestly, the best night’s sleep he could recall having lately was the night he and Castiel shared a bed.  The thought warmed him and he cleared his throat with the hopes of clearing the distracting thoughts that accompanied the memory.
It doesn’t come to him instantaneously, in one moment or the next, but there is something inside of him drawn to the depths of the ocean in the other man’s eyes.  And it’s foolish and impossible, but Dean remembers on some subatomic level.  He remembers this.
When he walked through the door before the 15 minute mark, the students groaned, probably hoping they’d get to skip class in his absence.
It wasn’t as though Castiel could remember, but he found he believed him anyway.  He looked to the asphalt then, nostrils flaring Dean’s to match.  “I need a ride,” he snapped, voice strained.
Abruptly, Dean cleared his throat and looked at his wringing hands.  “Look, Cas, I know this is a lot to spring on you outta the blue and I can explain--”  His leg stilled the second Castiel laid a warm, reassuring hand on Dean’s knee.
Draping himself over Castiel, Dean’s sweaty skin sticking to his back, he hummed along to another discordant melody, before he positioned his lips just shy of Castiel’s ear.  Their eyes still locked in the reflection, Dean’s black and shiny.  Poised and dangerous, compared to Castiel’s blue ones colored with desperation.  “Are you sure?”
“Me?”  Castiel felt like he got the wind knocked out of him.  He knew he’d been rude to her, but ending a potential relationship with someone over their roommate’s shitty behavior seemed melodramatic at best.  “What’d I do?”
“Man, I don’t think you wanna know.  Like horror movie type shit, right.  Suicide, I think.”  The man grimaced.  “You ever seen that one movie… man, what the fuck was that movie?
Charlie settled her notebook back onto her lap and dramatically turned her head to Dean, eyes wide.  “Of course I have… Don’t tell me you haven’t even started.”
Dean rolled his eyes, but smiled all the same.  “Sure I do.  It’s Lisa.  She does yoga.  She’s very bendy,” he added with a suggestive leer and Castiel rolled his eyes right back.
Instead, Dean simply sat back and observed and took notes and whispered to Charlie like everything was the same, so Castiel tried to act like everything was the same too, despite everything being wildly different.  Because apparently they were two people that have had sex with each other, which was a fact sober Castiel was still struggling to process.  And right now, Dean was staring at him like the cat who caught the canary and whom was taking great pride in watching the thing squirm before putting it out of its misery.
Cas slinks up the bed, arms trapping Dean in on either side.  Dean sinks a little further into the pillow, but who could blame him?  Cas is kind of terrifying when he takes control, in the hottest way possible.  He's hovering over Dean, blue eyes dark with want and staring at his mouth like he wants to devour him.  Dean is unequivocally on board.  “Don't ask stupid questions,” Cas orders, before crushing their lips together.
“Oh, oh, oh, and then that time with Rhonda fuckin’ Hurley when we pantsed you.”  His shoulder were practically vibrating with restraint. “You got so spooked you almost sprained your damn ankle.”
“Yeah, me too.”  Self-consciously, Dean scanned the street before tugging Sam into one of those awkward one-armed bro hugs, but it meant more than that, he just didn’t have the words to say it.  Whatever it was, Sam got it.  He always did.  “Night, Bitch.”
Mary shook her head and resumed her washing as she continued, “Anyway, Nancy and I got to talking and it reminded me of that barbecue we had way back when and it just got me reminiscing is all.  He really was such a sweet boy.  If you see him around, you tell him I’d love to see him some time.  See how he’s doing.”  Like that was ever going to happen, but Dean didn’t have it in his heart to tell her to her face how much he’d changed. .
“Yeah, John, I hear you,” he sneered, but was cut off by the sound of vacuous dead air on the other end of the line.  “Loud and fucking clear.”
Cas rolls his eyes at the affront, unfazed. “I'm just playing the game like you wanted, Dean. I learned it from you. You shouldn't have taught me how to play if you didn't want me to get better at it.”
It was a weird thing to ask, and really, Dean had no reason to after everything, but Castiel had shown up.  He was here, so Dean found himself nodding along anyway without even giving it a second thought.  “Yeah,” he breathed.
It was his last class of the day: a one hour seminar on Roman Sculpture.  One more hour and the first week of classes could be marked off in his planner.
They miraculously managed to make it through dinner without mentioning fucking football.  Almost.  The second John’s fork clattered against his empty plate, he was leaning back in his chair, spinning his beer bottle between his fingers, and eyeing Dean before he fixed his attention on Bobby.
“I couldn’t do it,” Dean rasped, sucking in a harsh breath.  “I couldn’t do it anymore, Cas.  Not without you with me.  You left and I never got to tell you.  I never got to tell you I—”  His fingers tangled tighter in the familiar trench coat, not wanting to let go yet, never wanting to let him go, before Cas pulled back to look him in the eye.  But even still, even now, the words were lodged in his throat.  He swallowed harshly around the lump when Cas laid a soft, shaking palm to his cheek, meeting his sparkling wet eyes.
On autopilot, he hung his trenchcoat by the door and slipped out of his work clothes on his way towards his bedroom.  He showered quickly tonight and changed into an especially worn set of pajamas.  They were comfortable, he always defended to anyone that had seen them, and it wasn’t as though anyone were seeing him now.  He very pointedly wasn’t wallowing, but even if he were, sue him.  And then, mind forcibly blank, he prepared dinner for himself and Michelangelo.
It only occurred to Dean he was crying in Castiel’s bedroom when Sam stopped talking and sat up.  His face was wet and itchy, but he was overcome with a wave of emotion so strong he couldn’t do much to contain it.  He blinked hard and scrubbed a hand over his eyes, sniffing back whatever was left when he finally mustered the courage to look his not-so-little brother in the face.
“No,” they say in unison, before cleaning up and departing to their separate sleeping quarters for the night.
“Where’s Cas?” Dean asks, hand scrubbing over his face, in an attempt to be casual as he pours himself a cup.
“That’s right.  My apologies.  Next time, I’ll make sure I drown to spare you the trouble of driving me home again,” Castiel replied wryly.
The factory excursion was a bust.  Well, nearly a bust, with the exception of finding the mostly charred remnants of the hex bag Dean had destroyed.  The rest?  Scrubbed clean.
The late afternoon sun was blazing down, warming the asphalt as Castiel made his way towards the bike rack.  As expected, detention was utterly pointless.  He spent the time folding origami out of his notes and flicking them in the trash barrel at the front of the room, all the while feeling Dean Winchester’s unrelenting gaze pierce the back of his head.  When they were dismissed, Castiel bolted to avoid him, but it didn’t work.
“The best ones usually are,” Charlie laments almost wistfully. “But okay, fine, I’m listening. Go ahead.”
Mick was leaning in to say something along the lines of “do you want to get out of here” against the side of Castiel’s face when there was suddenly a body pressing against Castiel’s back.  Warm hands pressing themselves down and gripping onto Castiel’s shoulders.
“Balthazar!”  Castiel pulled the covers off his head, only further disheveling the mess of hair, to toss an affronted scowl over his shoulder.
“This is the place,” Dean announced almost as an afterthought, although this place was nothing like how he’d imagined.  What he imagined he couldn’t really say, it just… wasn’t this.
Dean’s chest arched off the mattress and fell back with a thud, but it punched another laugh from his chest.  “Uh-uh,” he clucked his tongue against his teeth.  “I wouldn’t do that if I were you,” he taunted.  “It’s against the rules!  Why, you could hurt Dean!  And then what would keep your cock warm?”
“Hold up, loverboy!”  Once they were cleared of the library exit, she breathlessly exclaimed, “You need to tell him how you feel!”
The corner of Dean's lip curled again as he let out a soft snort.  "How do you suppose it would look talkin’ to one of your students alone in the bathroom?"
Carefully extracting himself from the tangled mess of limbs, Castiel stumbled his way through the apartment, shoulders bumping against unfamiliar architecture, as he headed for the toilet.  Once he found it, he fell to his knees on the porcelain tile and slumped over the bowl.  Waiting.  The sensation of saliva coating thick the inside of his mouth.  That same familiar feeling of unease needling the pit of his stomach.  There was no doubt he was going to vomit, but he didn’t think he’d been that far gone to warrant it.
“The way you answered the phone tonight?  Professor Roche?  Aaron told me about his paper.  You been acting off for a bit.  And trust me when I say, I know a thing or two about not being fine.”
“I just mean, who cares what he thinks, anyway?  Whatever he says is bullshit and it always has been.  You shouldn't let him get to you like that,” Sam said, gesturing to Dean’s bloody, clenched fist.
I'm sick again, my beta was high while reading this, and I'm in over my head here, but are you guys ready to toss this fruit salad or what?
Dean was practically glued to the spot watching Castiel walk away.  He hadn't paid it much mind before, but those jeans were hugging all the right places and that blue shirt definitely wasn't hurting anything either.  “See ya, Cas,” he absently murmured, clutching the leather jacket between his fists.
“Funny seeing you surrounded by guys,” Castiel retorted flatly.  “Do you all take turns being on the bottom, or…?”
Tossing a cautionary glance down the hall, Castiel set his sights on the darkened nursery room, on the crib casting barred shadows on the floor.  He approached the edge of the crib warily and looked on as baby Benjamin chewed his lip and rubbed his tiny fingers together.
Sam parks the Impala in the center parking space between their two rooms at the “Pink Flamingo”.  The only rooms available when they checked in this afternoon were on opposite sides of the motel strip, so the middle just makes the most sense.  They all reach for their respective door handles at the same time.  All taking great relief in the fact they can shower and lay their sorry asses down on actual beds that are only a mere fifty feet away in either direction.  Well, everyone except Cas because Cas doesn’t need to sleep.  It was just understood that he would be ‘bunking’ with Sam and Jack, as per the arrangement at check in.
“I still don’t know where you work.  You said you washed dishes, but I don’t know what dishes you’re washing this late.”
He emphatically ground the front of his jeans against her lap and she pulled him down by the back of his neck into a kiss.  They moved against each other within the cramped confines of the backseat, his hands wandering lower to grope at her ass pressed against the cloth interior, and her fingers automatically going for his belt buckle, undoing it teasingly slow.  Sliding past the hem, she finally took him in her hand and Castiel bit his lip in an effort to stifle the low moan building in his throat.
“No, you don’t. You proved that when I came home to find you fucking yourself after i expressly told you to abstain,” he derided. “I could leave you untouched for hours if I wanted to, you know. Build you up and leave you here for God knows how long. Don’t think I haven’t considered it,” he spoke lowly, inching closer, within reach. “Would you like that better?”
Instinctively, Castiel began to loosen his tie and Dean paused to watch his deft fingers work the knot.  “We’ll see.”
“Me too,” he admitted softly, running his fingernails through Dean’s short crop of hair the peculiar way Dean liked.  “But then, I’d never leave.”
Meandering down the hall to the kitchen, he sets to work rifling through the fridge and a couple of the metal shelves serving as a makeshift pantry.  They don’t have much.  Dean hasn’t gone to the grocery store in over a week and it occurs to him in his search that they are indeed out of coffee.  Apparently his subconscious got that right too.  He groans to himself at the prospect of having to endure Cas and Sam for the rest of the evening without caffeine, and what’s worse, waking up tomorrow without any too.  Oh well.  He manages to scrounge together the makings for a poor excuse at Bobby’s Special Chili, which really just consists of a couple cans of premade chili he found on the shelf.  The special part being the leftover hot dogs Dean found in the fridge.
After a minute, Dean stood and decided to busy himself.  He puttered around the room cleaning up astray clothing.  “So, to what do I owe the honor of your company?  Or maybe, to whom.”  As he folded things, he avoided Castiel’s patented look of concern and found a pair of underpants to adorn himself with; not that it mattered, the shirt was so big he was drowning in it.
When the door finally opened, Castiel opened his mouth to speak, but the words died on his tongue.  The ambiguous stench was overpowering.  There was a man in a white hazmat suit too, the hood unzipped around his shoulders.  He was just staring at Castiel like he was growing a second head.
“Shhh,” Castiel soothed, “I’m coming back.”  Then the sound of a foil packet ripping between teeth cut the air.  There were the sounds of Castiel rolling the condom on and the click of the lubricant bottle filled the room, then he warmed it between his fingers.  He was kneeling at the end of the bed while he did, taking in the sight of Dean’s exposed hole waiting for him, his flushed cock lying heavy against his stomach.  “You’re beautiful,” he said, as if in awe, and Dean could feel the heat spreading across his face and down his chest at the mere suggestion he was anything close.
Balthazar’s gaze was hazy and drifted off out to sea.  He cleared his empty throat a bit, before opening his mouth with the intention to say more.  He looked as though he were still trying to formulate how best to deliver his message, lest it be ill received.  Based entirely on that look alone, Castiel knew it would be.
Feeling newly confident in himself, Cas set about getting his ingredients together.  It was quite a lengthy list and he couldn’t really fathom how tasting that many complex flavors at once could possibly yield to an enjoyable experience, but Dean had stuffed his face with more things in one sitting than this, so Cas felt rest-assured that Dean wouldn’t find the meal too off-putting.
The two started walking along the shore and Cas told him that when he was younger he’d swum so far, the lifeguards had to chase him with the boat. He’d been grounded for two weeks.
“Cas, don't- don't get mad, all right? You went to the bathroom and I saw a couple of papers among the books on the table and...” Castiel sighed. "Dean. I'm not mad."
Gabriel, as Castiel had called him, was a man in his thirties, or so it seemed. The childish and amused gaze might have well belonged to that of a child. He was short, hazel eyes, light and fairly long hair. A lollipop in his mouth and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes, which turned even more heated as soon as he noticed Dean's figure standing behind the counter.
He shifted, not so gracefully, (in his defense he was still more asleep than awake) and his elbow collided with something in the process, probably the nightstand.
He brought his hands to grip tightly Cas’ hips, digging his fingers into the skin. Feeling his touch, the other boy suddenly pulled away and Dean used the opportunity to catch his breath.
Dean's eyes grew bright and his smile mischievous. Castiel wanted to take him right now, right there on that table.
“Meg, what the fuck are you doing here?" The girl just smiled at him, her eyes black and mischievous. "Why? I can't talk to a..." Her gaze slid longingly down the length of his body. “...friend?"
"Many kisses, Cas." His mouth curves into a smile and his eyes point again to the sky, he knows it would have been easier for Hades.
Hades remembers the first time, he was in the human world after so much of that time...He had seen Dean’s skin bathed in the orange light of the sunset, he had seen the gentle smile, the eyes of a green so vivid and deep...he had taken the boy with him without thinking, but Dean had stayed.
“Hm.” He said nothing more, he just threw out the smoke and watched it mingle with the morning humid air. He felt himself relaxing.
The hand woven into the hair on the back of his head loosened and was displaced to cup Dean’s cheek, pulling his face up to meet him.  A silent request to look into Castiel’s eyes, but Dean couldn’t answer the call yet.  He didn’t want to for fear the needling in the backs of his eyes would turn into something liquid and leak.  He couldn’t cry like a child in the lap of the man he’d just asked to fuck him.  He couldn’t do that here.
“Maybe?”  Dean reflects back to the occasional bouts of sleep he must have gotten if the few minute intervals in the alarm clock were anything to go by.  “No dreams, but I guess that ain’t such a bad thing, eh?”  He sucks down more of the coffee while the other three shoot him their best constipated faces.
So he really was going to leave, not that it was at all surprising. Dean wasn’t that naive.  He suspected as much, it just sucked to have tangible evidence.  Then again, most people didn’t feel compelled to get fully dressed just to get a glass of water.
Dean growled in his ear and pushed back to undo his own fly.  He didn’t even bother undoing the buttons of his shirt.  “Turn over,” he instructed, as he kneeled back.
“I don’t know.”  Aaron shrugged, but his cloying, oblivious smile said everything.  “I mean, I have a dorm.  We could work on the Art History paper or something.”
“Aha!” Sam snakes his arm out of the box clutching a board game. When he blows the dust off the game box, Jack sneezes, but Dean figures it's too on the nose to say bless you to a half angel kid. Cas says it anyway. “Check it out! Looks like we're good to go, guys.”
“C’mon,” he said, rising from the bench, “Time to move.”  He pocketed his phone and they walked over to the crosswalk, Sam trailing closely behind and looking just as lost as Dean felt right about now.
Castiel popped one himself before pocketing the bottle as he started for the door.  Grabbing a sweatshirt on his way there, he paused just short of it, and rounded back to take the half-drunk glass of vodka from her hand to wash it down.  He shot it back with practiced ease and plunked the empty glass on the side table with a subtle hiss.  And just for safe-keeping, he pilfered the half-drunk bottle too.
“Dean, wait,” Castiel pleaded, getting to his feet, like his subconscious made the decision to go after him.  “Please.”
Desperate to cut the tension in the air, Dean attempts a joke.  “Yeah, you should see the other guy.”  It’s the wrong way to go and the nervous energy Cas was giving off in waves before slinks it’s way back in.
Castiel dragged himself up slowly, rubbing the sleep from his still-hazy vision.  It took him a few minutes to notice the ibuprofen and full water bottle placed on his nearby desk with a note that simply read ‘TAKE ME’ in Dean’s messy scrawl.  Smiling weakly to himself, he did as he was told.
Castiel mistakenly allowed himself one disapproving glance as he turned the page.  Their eyes met.  Dean grinned knowingly.
The news sat with him in all the wrong ways, but he certainly couldn’t show it.  And at the insistence of Lisa, Dean invited him to dinner for the following weekend as a ‘thank you’ and to meet their newborn son.
Castiel pulled back, face almost puzzling, like he’d actually forgotten he was still fully clothed.  “Right, fuck.”  Reluctantly, he dragged himself away.
The slow grind of their hips moving together was enough for a while, until it wasn’t.  Castiel’s skin was slick with sweat as he attempted to control his pace to accommodate Dean, but Dean didn’t want to be accommodated for anymore.  Dean needed more.  He needed to feel closer.
Just what Castiel needed.  Two accents having some sort of pissing contest over him at the too-sterile bar on the rich side of town.
She was fine, he decided at the first sign of life.  Just high off her ass on… What was it this time?  He reached for the orange bottle and turned it in his hands to read the label.  It was dark in there too, the only light source coming from the intermittent blue glow of the TV set on commercials.  He had to squint to read it.  Some kind of painkiller.
Now, Castiel stood in front of his mirror in the basement of the parish adjusting his clerical collar and laying his shirt buttons flat.  Reaching for his jacket, he shrugged it on and went into his office to grab his well-loved edition of the King James from his desk, the special rites, and to pocket a vial of holy water.  The book felt almost like a mockery under his hands, the vial a lead weight, but he carried it under his arm dutifully as he made his way out to the parking lot and he slipped his rosary around his neck like a noose.
He’d only been outside for perhaps five minutes, before the music was swelling behind him once more.  The opening notes of Michael Jackson’s Thriller pumping through the house.  It faded out again just as quickly.  There was some rustling of a leather jacket behind him and the telltale flicking of a lighter before the pervasive smell of cigarette smoke wafted in his general direction.
Their eyes met and they exchanged equally sheepish looks until Castiel’s sights shifted over Dean’s shoulder.  Dean sucked in a deep breath like he’d forgotten to breathe.  Maybe he should’ve mentioned he wasn’t alone…
Dean looked at Castiel as though he were the densest human to have ever walked the Earth.  “Is that what you really came here to talk about?  What the hell does that matter now?”
Mounting the steps to head back to Dean’s room, Cas catches sight of the clock on the wall and has to look twice.  He finds himself frowning.  It’s almost 9 o’clock in the morning.  Nine hours of sleep seems excessive for a man accustomed to four, but then again, Dean was sleep deprived and exhausted.  Still, he can’t help wonder.
Sam leaned in then and chuckled.  “You’re in luck, Cas.  That’s pretty much the only decent thing to eat here.”
I know my boy cas isn’t about to be responsible for no cis man’s feelings 😤😍 always pee after sex 👌🏻
With a wet screech, the train came to stop just beside the platform and the second the doors folded open Castiel was throwing himself inside.  It was nearly empty, sans an older woman with a plastic bag wrapped around her head to protect her curls and what looked like a businessman with an expensive briefcase over on the far side.  Castiel took a seat closest to the door just because it was there.
“What?”  Cas snaps out of wherever he went.  “Um, no, I’m afraid I didn’t get a good look at it before I shot it.”
Decidedly, Castiel wanted to see the look on Dean’s face when his fingers found their way under that top hem and he plunged his hands in to grasp at the warm flesh of Dean’s bare ass, manipulating Dean’s hips forward in his lap until their groins met.  Fingers teasing over the cleft and spreading.  The visual didn’t disappoint.  Dean’s tongue darted out to wet his pink lips, his teeth grazing till the thin skin turned white.  Castiel pulled him in again, pushing his own hips up to meet him with a sure thrust, and Dean strangled a grunt, his hands gripping tightly to the faux-leather sofa back.  And again.
"Yes," he smiled at him. "I forgave him, Sam is still working on it. We're saving some money, I'm at my dream University when I didn't even think I'd make it through high school, and Sam's doing well, as he should."
Dean smiles but his eyes weep. Hades bends down to see his face, the wrinkles hide many of his freckles, but the eyes...the eyes are still the same, a pure green, the color of grass moved a little by the wind, pools of gold scattered in the iris, the color of the sun. His heart beats fast, he always loved those green eyes. All Dean had to do was point them at him, and Hades would be clueless, his stomach in turmoil.
Dean noticed that everyone in the library was looking at him with a mixture of wonder and suspicion. “So, this guy...?”
Dean felt his stomach growling just at the smell of what the cook was preparing. He was a lovely old man with rosy cheeks and a few extra pounds. He seemed to know Castiel.
Dean didn't have a smart answer for that either, but this time he said it anyway. "I've discovered the art of meditation, Benny.”
"Fuck, Cas!" But Castiel didn't care. He kissed him even more fiercely and his hands were suddenly everywhere. To feel the skin under his shirt, on his ass, on his chest.
After a session of languid kissing, with the potential of becoming so much more, Dean pushed him away and Cas went back to sit on the table stool to watch him cooking and steal a few pieces of food when having the opportunity. At some point, Dean was even forced to hit him with the spatula. "You don't help me like that."
Dean hated seeing someone drink alcohol so casually, like it was water. Probably because of his father, the man who not so long ago drank at all hours to the point of puking his guts out at the end of every day.
It was rougher than usual. Castiel had been probably sleeping and Dean had woken him up. And yet, he didn’t feel guilty. After hearing that voice after too damn long, he was feeling fuckin' horny.
Cas brought his hand up to touch the spot where he'd been kissed. He looked at him in disbelief and Dean doubled up with laughter.
He thought back to Meg's question and studied the lighter in his hand as if it were the most interesting thing in the world. He tried to hide it, but he didn't like talking about Dean to his "friends.”
