For once, her mind lingered not on the spirals containing her coursework or her thick, fascinating pages, but on the dilemma that phrase created.

"As much as I care for you, Sherlock, tea is a high priority."
"Nonsense. We have a capable doctor on our hands - you would survive the shock," he intoned, dismissing the thought as though the very notion was preposterous. "And in the unlikely circumstance that you needed resuscitation, I have the necessary implements for the procedure on hand. You'd be absolutely fine." she glared fiercely, anyhow.
"Rosamund," he begins cautiously, pulling away slightly. "When did you get to be so damn
What an interesting predicament.
"A look that says what?"
"Is that a compliment I detect, Sherlock? Marriage has already softened you."
"Never," he responded instantly, frowning without a hint of offense.
"Of course. Rather effective in keeping you quiet, I must admit."
Now it is just her and Rosie, alone with a stack of Doctor Who programs.
"I don't know what you were thinking, but I am not the type to take things lightly in a relationship. I'm rather all or nothing, I'm afraid. A bit of a turn off for all the girls I used to go with," he said, pausing as if sorting through memories. "It rarely lasted wrong. I'm not going to lie, I'm rather new to this. Never really considered blokes. But I'm here, until the finish line, if you are." There was an unspoken question lying in the air, and '
This was only one of many games, though.
It's odd, trying to get your fathers, the men who raised you side by side, to fall in love, but their family was never anything less than odd, anyhow. And this really would tie up so many loose ends nicely. John and Sherlock already shared the same room and had a common job and routine, and her dad already admitted that he loved her father, so half the work was done. And the tall, brooding - yes, it really was such a wonderful word,
With baleful eyes, two rugby girls sat behind a foldable white table with an enormous dispenser in the middle. A stack of white cups were held behind their operation.
"You know, one of these days you're going to have to come up with a new source of bait material. As genius as you are, brother dear, I believe the rest of London has already grown accustomed to your oh so witty cracks on my physical appearance," the man mused. "Be more creative."
The teenager couldn't possibly know what she was offering to do. Reyna hadn't lived in a household that studied dead organ tissue for fun or chased down muggers as a hobby. She hadn't experienced a murder scene or uncovered ancient chinese dialects or decoded a thousand number cipher. She had normal parents, universities lined up, a healthy career ahead of her without all of this. Reyna had a shot at regularity, minus staples in the forehead and revolvers to the skull.
"And there we are again, your old standbys," he said, not quite sighing but glaring at his brother as if he very much wanted to. "For sake of queen and country, Sherlock, I merely meant to ask if you were okay. If you were alright, still. Things for us are known to . . . degrade, over time." Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
The fifth marks a solid fifteen forays, many of which Molly has 'babysat' for.
"Oh, you've delivered far better." Sherlock smirked in response.
) because she never got to miss it, but perhaps this was all because Molly made sure that she wouldn't have to go without anything. Molly is safe, and loving, and
In a surge of endorphins (he refuses to admit that chemical balances may have had nothing to do with it, so endorphins it is), he propels his face upwards in order to capture John Watson's lips.
It was fascinating, actually.
"Sherlock . . . "
John never shoved him off or frowned or jerked abruptly in surprise at these strange notions. Instead, he reveled in them, savored them, the acts of acceptance and enjoyment written in everything he did.
"Rosie, bored? Reminds me of another person I know."
"Nothing special, but I have survived this long. It's no trouble, actually."
'Auntie Molly' wasn't exactly having the best day.
"What's wrong with that?" Holmes questioned, raising an eyebrow. Watson shrugged.
Her fathers kept bickering in the cab over "no, we're not getting a dog" and "why are we not talking about
They were living together in her flat, now, as they had been for almost the last year. It had simply made sense for Greg to move in with her; her flat was the biggest of the two, in relatively close proximity to his work, very clean and tidy, and only a five minute ride from 221B given good traffic. There wasn't a need to search for available listings or start looking into new buildings; what they had, much like their relationship, worked. That was all there was to it.
For the longest time, she enjoyed complex words, the ones with pretty notations. Brooding, in particular, was such a funny one. Prerogative, derivative, inclination, prose, meandering, hydrogenous - there were so many beautiful, multifaceted notations to choose from. Collecting words had become a bit of a game for her, over the years, but elementary was the one she liked being called the most. There was something odd about it, something ornamental and antique yet soothing, endearing, even, that drew her in.
This is why Molly found it so amusing that Rosie started playing rugby.
"I'm going to have to start walking around shirtless, soon."
The next part of the epilogue will (hopefully) be coming out next week. I swear, I've labored over it for months and it's still at a disappointing 5.2k words. However, I'm steadily adding to it again. Hopefully my readers on fanfiction.net will be pleasantly surprised when the story finally marks itself as 'complete'.
It's sweet, she thinks. It's nice to see them happy.
"And do you, John Watson, take Sherlock Holmes as your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, til death do you part?"
"Yes, John, don't act so surprised," the detective responded, though he sounded far more
After many hours of dedicated contemplation, Sherlock Holmes did the unthinkable with this memory - he replayed it, over and over, before carefully shutting its door. Some things, despite his vast grasps of the explained and the deduced, could remain mysteries.
a conniving arse, John. And a sociopath, a consulting detective, and I've been called a prick on numerous occasions. Obviously, though, I have my charms, or you wouldn't be here with me."
"Thanks, Greg," she muttered, her face already filling with red at the sudden warmth. The hot chocolate was sure to be scalding, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing given the weather. "I'll pay you back." He waved her off.
This is why he is so confused when the little girl that calls him Dad is looking so out of sorts this afternoon.
"Why, consulting detective, of course. I'd imagine I'd be a great one, too, with enough practice, and with Sherlock Holmes and John Watson as my private mentors . . . well, Scotland Yard always needs a helping hand, right?" Molly grinned right back because
But eventually, as they are simple organisms at their heart of hearts and they require oxygen for biological sustainment purposes - how dull - they end up pulling away, gasping for air. John's lips are puffy in a way that they haven't been in years, since long before his wife died, and it gives the detective an inexplicable wellspring of pride to know that he was the one kissing Watson senseless.
Not takeout.
I was, Sherlock?" he says, and suddenly John Watson looks downright murderous. Normally, this wouldn't threaten Sherlock, as John was John and very unlikely to start a physical altercation, but seeing as he was lying in a hospital cot at the moment this could turn to the problematic. "I was here by your bed for a whole bloody
"Yes, but technically this
How ridiculous, that concept, but how very fitting.
"Well, then, thank god for that."
"Well? Go on."
Of course Rosie wouldn't pass up the chance to further the bonding process while she wasn't around. Naturally, this would have been made into a date of sorts.
If he didn't have his occasional moments of usefulness (and if his family - parents
"Sherlock! Oh my god, what was that for?" the woman says, trying to catch her breath after jumping back almost three feet. John looks just as startled, but the pale white of fright seems to have canceled out the rosy tones of before, and his skin appears nearly normal now.
"Why are you so sure, John?"
And now, the game is afoot!
Fat lot of good that would do, though, to get John to admit to anything. He really thought they could manage to cultivate something without the press or the investigative team or even
later this afternoon," she groaned, already anticipating the nip of the frigid air.
"You would have done the same for me, John. You know you would have. In fact, Mary
"It's subtle is the problem. I'm starting to think it's more of a conspiracy theory than anything else."
"Well, maybe bringing Ro to the place where a family was just brutally murdered several hours ago didn't have much appeal." Sherlock snorted loudly.
"Partners, Ro?"
"It doesn't make a difference at all. I just figured we could give our daughter the option," he had retorted, crossing his arms over his chest. "I know
"Sod off, Ro." The lock clicked in a rather satisfying fashion and Rosie stood up, grinning triumphantly.
Why is he in a hospital, though? He doesn't recall being sick, or much of anything that would lead to a sick visit.
"What? You

"Still, you read the Bible. You."

"Both." And just as he had arrived, he had left, leaving the flat with a bang of the door and the click of fine leather shoes.
or injured myself or . . ."
"I told you I'm bloody awful at this. It took you less than fifteen minutes."
"Well, we shouldn't let you get bored at 221B by yourself. I can hardly blame you for wanting to see your parents at work," he responds, the false innocence dripping off of his sentences like honey, and she passes him a devious, lopsided smirk. He exchanges it with fervor.
I've gone back and forth on adding these so many times but, who knows, maybe someone out there would like to read them and if not you can just skip it.
She stares at the well manicured lawn below as she grips the course gray stone of the balcony tightly between her slender fingers.
But before Sherlock can think on it more John is smiling at him again.
He tries to see if he recognizes Mike amidst the sea of bodies surrounding him.
Away.
He must have known.
John can't help but laugh at the innocence of the request.
Seated up there the players on the field would have a hard time spotting him and he could make his retreat before they see him if he ended up feeling uncomfortable.
'Is there now?'
Where Molly Hooper had been sitting with her aunt there is now only the aunt left. She's lying face down on the table. One arm stretched out in front of her. A half empty glass still clutched in her other hand.
I tell people: “I don't do goodbyes” and “until next time” even when I'm fully aware of the chances of that ever happening being probably close to zero.....or less even.
I just don't know if John wants to as well.
They worm their way into her mouth and eyes.
John leans in closer in an attempt to keep the rest of their conversation private.
“Alright”, Nighthawk says, “sounds like an adventure.”
“Are there any more boys that you kissed or that I should know about?” John asks.
He cannot remember the last time he has been this high.
But later.
Mary moves closer and looks over his shoulder to the room beyond.
It manages to dull the sharp edges of the world somewhat but from the corners of his eyes he can still see them.
The room grows dark as evening falls around her.
He has a very peculiar way of looking at things.
He makes sure to speak his next word slightly softer.
Maybe that's why it has taken them as long as it has to get together.
.....or....
I, of course, follow up on exactly none of them.
“But who....”
“Good night, Sherlock. Sweet dreams.”
About what they are to each other now.
But at this point he finds he no longer cares.
'Obvious?'
Can I deliver a message for you?”
“I followed them one night”, Miss Hooper continues, “it was difficult but I managed it. I found their master.....they belong to the King.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nods.
Letting in all the magic and wonder he had been so blind to previously.
He does not remember now what he had been thinking about.
“Maybe it's the remains of that spell I was under.”
At this moment John finds it hard to believe that there is something out there in the world....some great evil....something set on destroying them....on destroying everything. For the moment the world around them is tranquil, calm, a couple of birds are starting to wake up as they greet the first hesitant rays of sunshine with some faint titters that echo above their heads.
“I don't think you're allowed to smoke in here”, John says.
I wish I had taken his hand then and had told him.
'I didn't mean...'
I'm not sure if I'll be able to handle it if he decides to take all of this affection and closeness away from me again.
'Definitely not.'
John swallowed and looked around him uncertainly. 'I see the field', he ventured.
He decided he was not taking the bait.
Sherlock sighs again and carries on painting.
An older lady named Mrs. Hudson lets them in and introduces herself as Sherlock's landlady.
When they reach the table Watson's concern is for the lady as he checks her breathing and her pulse and, having confirmed that both are still present, lets out a relieved sigh.
The man is surprisingly tanned for the time of year and so his teeth shine like white pebbles amidst his darkened complexion when he smiles at John.
My mother looks sad a lot of the time. This evening she looks exceptionally sad.
“Great....yeah.....I'll write you down the time and address.”
He decides he doesn't really have a whole lot to lose and so he just finishes the last of his beer and leaves.
“Easy, easy....are you alright?' John asked again.
John feels like taking on the world. He feels capable of anything with Holmes by his side once more.
“In a good way”, John continues, “your hair is as bit longer, you're taller, you're more proportional than you used to be.....when we were young.”
So much of what he carefully hides away when John isn't around.
At first the footsteps drew nearer to where he was at work, but then they just....stopped.
Its pale long fingers outstretched towards Molly's shoulder.
It will create chaos.......it will create trouble.......confusion.
'Inside.'
This is just fluff.
Although....not consciously at least. It was a warmth that started in his chest, but quickly moved to his lower abdomen.
Just for a moment I feel jealous and betrayed and it's as if I'm splashing cold water on my face all over again but then I notice his body language.
Perhaps he's giving away too much but apparently the alcohol has gotten to him too. He finds himself much more loose-lipped than he usually is. He also finds he doesn't care.
A strange expression briefly flits across Holmes features but his mind is still far too foggy and unclear to accurately place its meaning.
There's water in  his eyes, on his lips. He feels as if he's drowning. As if he can't breathe.
Thinking back on it now it must have felt an awful lot like a break-up.
He really hopes his own inexperience hasn't put John off.
Sherlocks smile faltered for a moment, but was back again before John had time to properly register the emotion that briefly took its place.
There is a plea and a warning hidden within the tone of his voice but I heed neither.
**************************************************
Now that Sebastian is gone all Sherlock's confidence seems to slip way from him at once.
“I meant at my house”, John says, “plenty of coffee there....and my parents aren't home....so...”
But there was one thing he had to do first.
“Oh....”, she says, “why of course.....I have some paper and ink right here in my desk. You could use some of it if you like.... Is it an important message you need to write?”
The sky around us grows darker and darker as the sun dips below the horizon, pouring out her honeyed, heavy light into the sea where it gets swallowed by the waves.
This Holmes should be the right one.
hasn't blinked.
Molly's vision blurs as tears fill her eyes. She doesn't want to cry. She just can't help it.
Killing an elf is not an easy feat but he had been pretty sure he would manage.
His words have left him.
John chuckles again but there is a slightly nervous edge to the sound this time.
Just know that, whatever happens, this will never become an abandoned work because I've put way too much time into this already.
In the end he just decides to use spit.
He had known it might rain today but he had not expected the weather to change quite so quickly or so violently.
And, not in the least, giving Holmes a little bit of time to come to terms with all that has happened these last couple of days will hopefully also make him a little less reluctant to take John to the Order.
He laughs again and, once again, it makes him wince.
“I'm always alright”, he says, “go back to sleep”, but his own voice sounds frail and far off to his own ears.
But just as the man was about to head outside he turned back once more. 'It was lovely meeting you', he said as he licked his lips. 'Such, such an improvement over that old, senile man.'
I lay awake that night with  my phone in my hand.
His vision is slowly going black as he feels Morgana trying her best to pull her form out of him guided by his own magic.
he heard himself say in a recent memory.
Mrs. Hudson had been right. He should talk to Mary as soon as he had a chance. Clear the air between them. After all, he had been the one that had initiated the kiss. Once again he felt his face burn with shame. What had he been thinking? Clearly he hadn't been thinking. Mary deserved better than this. He loved her, but he could never love her the way she wanted him to. And the reason why....he couldn't tell her. Men like him.....they weren't exactly accepted in society. When he had been together with James they always had to be so very, very careful. Stolen, hushed moments in dark corners. Not at all what love was supposed to be, but all they had been able to get all the same.
Another moment of silence passed and just when it seemed he was about to say something more the sound of dogs barking in the distance reached them.
Suddenly the swaying of hips in skintight dark jeans stops while the music still pounds on.
“By who?”
Introducing Finn. There will be more of him so I really hope you guys like him. I like him.
“So why were you trying to cross the Veil anyway?”
'It's fine', he could not bear to look at Sherlock right now.
'I doubt all those lords and ladies will like having me snooping around the ballroom, Mary.'
He can't even make out the opposite side of the room.
Neither of them ever seems to gain anything from it.
Held.
Something about the way Sherlock said that rubbed John the wrong way. Over these last couple of weeks he had come to see Sherlock as an interesting, funny, on occasion kind and handsome young man. Someone he had come to see as a friend.  And to hear someone talk him down like that, even if it was Sherlock himself, just didn't seem right. But before he could say anything about it Sherlock continued talking.
There is a reason why they call her 'The Spider'.
I stare at the light of the screen until my eyes start to water.
'I told you. She's not good enough for you.'
And he can hardly wait.
That settles it.
(Disclaimer: I am no scholar on this subject. I'm not even a native English speaker. I just love folklore, fairies and Scotland. So if I get anything wrong by accident, please don't hate me for it.
Startled, John stepped back, a stinging pain in his left leg the result. He hadn't really realized how much he'd been on his feet this evening until now.
Finally he turned his face towards his friend. Sherlock had put his coat on again. On his face a slightly concerned expression.
“I'll tell you when you're older too, little ghost.”
Carefully John slipped the chain around his neck and slid the medallion underneath his shirt. It felt heavy and cold against his skin.
John has always been the only one who was able to bring that out in him.
Left to himself and his own gloomy thoughts John feels unsure.
He wishes he knew what it means.
The Watson family was getting into their car now. Sherlock decided to follow.
“So, what did you think?” he says.
It is a sharp contrast to the girl who faced the hellish magpies and their king in the same nightmarish dream-scape he has experienced several times. He is having a hard time believing this is even the same girl. She looks so young....
He hopes Sherlock hasn't noticed.
Just look what all this knowledge has done for John.
Sherlock tries to avoid the elf's eyes but even when he's not looking at him he can still feel their fiery spark on his skin.
Mycroft opens the door and gets out and Sherlock walks up to him.
She tilts her head to the side, I'm expecting her to give me one of her own sad smiles but instead she just frowns at me.
And as Sherlock retracted his hand the wall started to emit a soft glowing light making the unseen seen.
Unsure.
Where, not even in his wildest dreams, Sherlock had ever expected to see him.
********************************************************
John can't help but smile at him endearingly.
“Just what I thought too.....”, it is as if Holmes wants to say more but he quickly closes his mouth again and glances at John.
Is this angst? This might be angst.
He's let her down so many times by now.
And with that the family enters the carriage as John holds the door open for them.
A long arm was draped around him and John nestled his face in the crook of Sherlocks neck. He sighed contentedly. 'You smell nice.'
Once again I'd like to take the opportunity to thank all my readers. You are all amazing. And your kind words and support mean the world to me.
The soldier's death follows him still.
John squeezes his knee again, turns his head and presses a soft kiss to the tip of Sherlock's nose.
“Hello?” he says. Briefly he wonders if he should have added his name but if John is calling
“You don't have to worry”, he hears himself saying, “I might be an addict but I'm not an idiot. I know where I get my supplies and I get tested regularly. I never gave you any....diseases.”
John furrowed his brow as he once again rolled over to his other side. The room around him had gone completely dark by now. He guessed it must be well after midnight.
“Sure. Just fine.”
*******************************
He slides his food to the other side of his plate once more for good measure and when he sneaks a peek at his brother from underneath his fringe he finds that Mycroft is giving him a questioning look.
He feels lighter than he has done in a long time.
***********************************************************************************************
“You cannot just give that away”, Sherlock protests.
At 9pm I get so desperate that I actually decide to call him. He doesn't answer. The phone just rings until it goes to voice-mail and at that point I don't really know what I wanted to say anyway so I just hang up.
And I know this might not be completely fair to him.
Even Mike had told him about them.
Sherlock had denied it then. He denies it still. He will only believe it when he sees Mycroft's corpse with his own eyes.
The sounds from her vision are muted as if they are coming to her through several thick layers of blankets.
This time he nods.
He often found himself closing his eyes and retreating into this most private part of his psyche when he had a difficult decision to make.
“Duly noted, Mrs. Hudson”, he says, “I can assure you I only have his best interest at heart as well. I would sooner kill myself than bring him harm.”
Like a wounded animal.
He could vaguely remember a dream he had that night. It had not been his usual nightmare, but something else entirely.
Very nice.
Holy cow did this chapter get away from me!
The walls of the room she is in crack and shatter as she screams again.
'More John.....Uhn....more.....just....more', was all Sherlock managed to say.
We never talked about our actual lives......we never......
It had been brilliant.
There's a clock on his bedroom wall.
He's not sure what else to say.
He shakes his head and gives me the barest hint of a smile. In the depth of his eyes there is a sudden softness just waiting to bubble up towards the surface if only he would let it.
John is beautiful, his eyes a mesmerizing shade of cobalt and he looks so young and carefree and perfect.
Hiding just at the fringes of her own mirrored image....of her own being....trying its very best to stay unnoticed until its too late....
Intimate.
I dread the thought of having to stand outside with him in a couple of minutes stammering some kind of awkward goodbye. Maybe I'll even be dumb enough to try and lean in and kiss him because that's just how he makes me feel and I used to be able to do that before but now he'll most likely recoil and I might see the lights in his eyes dim and then we'll still have to say goodbye and maybe he'll never ask me to go out with him again.
The advantage of being a spider is having multiple threads to the web you weave.
To his credit Sherlock looks just as shocked as John feels when he confronts him but he quickly regains his composure.
And, with the worst of Sherlock finally laid bare for him to see, how could he have done anything else.
Fanfiction trope ahoy!
“Sherlock.....”, he says and then stops speaking. He's gone back to speaking in fragments. I don't like it when he does that. I don't like to see him struggling and fighting to keep these parts of him inside. I wish he trusted me enough to let me hold these broken parts of him as well without fearing I'd just break them even more.
“We won”, John says.
Mary's bitter smile widened. Her lips pressed so tightly together that the blood drained from them.
“You might just be bad at cards.”
****************************************
I give him a small smile as I take a sip from my mug. The tea is still too hot to drink and it numbs my tongue and throat a bit as it goes down. I blow on it impatiently.
For John to see.
John feels his heart sink.
******************************************
Holmes still sleeps on.
“Follow me and you'll find out.”
“You need to leave”, he grits out, “my girlfriend is here.”
But there is no air and he feels himself drowning.
I takes me a couple of embarrassingly long moments to recognize her but then I do.
All my love, Vanimelda.
“Why would
'Where are you going, John?'
A dark expression on his face while blue lights swim through his irises in a chaotic pattern.
Had he remembered not only the strange, dark king with his disappearing bird, but also the cards that came after he might have been able to discern a glimpse into his future from them.
Once again Miss Hooper looks small and very young.
'I know what you're going to say and it's better if you don't', she said, 'let's just leave it at this, yeah?' a pained and forced smile was on her face. 'We'll talk about this when we're both sober again.'
So I failed my test on purpose.
“I.....know......?”, all John manages to say. He's confused beyond words now.
And now I'm second guessing having done so.
The room around us is dark and quiet and if I concentrate I can almost hear the sound of his beating heart like a murmur just underneath our joined breaths.
He tells himself he chooses to not have friends. So he can study. Become top of his class. Make something of himself.
Why does he like Hamlet so much?
He cannot think of John.
His mind should be racing with concern but instead it’s as calm as a placid ocean underneath a cloudless sky. Which in itself is odd because the mind of Sherlock Holmes is always racing. He himself has often compared it to a runaway carriage. Its destination only becoming clear once he reaches it.
Better.
I understand.
He spends his morning packing his bags and the last place he visits are these rooms.
Maybe it's why he leaves every night and locks himself away during the day.
“Maybe we both knew”, John says and he kisses him again.
“What's this for?”, she says.
************************************************************
“I know how hard this must be for you, Sherlock......having to say goodbye to John.....to what you two found together this summer.........I.....”
“My ear should catch your voice. My eye, your eye....” John says. They're Helena's lines. Sherlock is surprised John knows these as well. He's not complaining though. John is standing so close to him now that once again he can feel John's breath on his face. Sherlock knows what the next line is and once again a warm feeling spreads from his abdomen all the way to his chest.
But.....it had looked so real.......
There is another oppressive silence between them.
John is completely in his element. He looks so sure of himself. So certain. He is without fear. Without doubt.
His well toned chest and abdomen can be seen as the fabric of the t-shirt stretches over them. His thighs and calves also muscular and tanned underneath his shorts. His hair is a  mess. Just like it was earlier that day.
I really hope everybody who has been reading along has enjoyed the journey and, if nothing else, has gained an interest for the source material.
I'm terrible with endings.
If magic is a sense of wonder and experiencing something you cannot explain or define. If magic is something new and exciting, something that  makes you feel things you hadn't thought were possible.
The second thing holding him back was the fact that, very much like the last time as well, he also might be slightly drunk again.
“Oh”, I say. Because now I
Alcohol made him feel less. Drowned out his thoughts and the memory of a soon to be ghost dressed in black looking at him with sad eyes.
“I'm sorry”, he says, “but what I said is true. There is an image of a bird on your........back......part........Watson found it!”
I am hoping he will text me....or call me.....
This time there's a small smile on Holmes' face as well.
His phone is in his hand.
Hidden in the dirt and weeds that line the side of the house.
The bed he currently finds himself in is made out of shiny polished metal with clean and durable sheets and there is one chair at the foot of his bed.
John pours him a glass and hands it over. Holmes takes a small sip and makes a face as if John has just offered him rancid bog water instead of the fresh cows-milk it actually is.
He has only finished half of his breakfast but he isn't hungry anymore.
He's not sure if he should pick up or not. There's a sinking feeling in his stomach that tells him this will not be good news. Maybe John and Molly are calling him together....asking him to delete John's number....or asking him to not come to the coffee-place next week....
Once again John looks down at his shoes just like he had done right before Molly had hugged him.
Standing in the doorway, silhouetted by the frame of the doors and the cold winter night sky behind it was a black horse drenched in sweat. Nostrils flaring. Hooves covered in mud and dirt. It was clear this horse had ran a long distance at high speed. On its back was the figure of a man. A black cloak on his shoulders with the hood drawn over his face. He was swaying back and forth precariously. About ready to fall off it seemed.
They had both been hurting each other for a long while now. Just in different ways.
He probably doesn't even know his name.
This time I frown at him and that does earn me one of his wonky smiles.
He's rubbing the back of his neck again and he licks his lips as he avoids looking at Sherlock at all costs.
She has grown sick of Holmes.
“You really like him, don't you?”
Holmes chuckles.
He speaks a few words in his own dark tongue and her feet start moving faster.
Even a furious John Watson will be better than no Watson at all.
This time it's Sherlock who throws back his head as he lets out an aggravated groan. The person seated behind them coughs again. Slightly louder this time.
But still together.
But with John's particular set of acting “skills” that does not seem to be likely.
Greg lingers for a bit and then kisses Molly on the cheek before he quickly walks off and joins the others.
“Mycroft, have you seen my....”, Sherlock stops dead in his tracks, “......John......”
John cast his eyes up towards the moon. With it being a full moon the large clearing in the trees before him was bathed in a sickly white, unfeeling and altogether otherwordly light. It made him feel uneasy and restless.
He actually laughs but the sound is just as cold as his body feels.
“Is he upset because you kissed him?”
Gone.
When we finally manage to get out of bed she makes us pancakes.
Before him is not only the expanse of John's naked, muscular chest but also the small details that make him....”him”.
Sherlock is pretty sure John knows exactly what he's trying to say.
“Not much to tell really....same as always....what have you been up to? Must be infinitely more interesting than my life at the moment.”
He brings out both the worst and the best in  me just with a look or a touch or a couple of choice words and I wonder if that's actually what love is like.
I plan to get nothing but mediocre grades at this school.
So instead he just looks down at the floating ice in his drink and shakes his head.
Sherlock closes the window but his cigarette is still lit.
If anything was to go wrong. If somehow this plan did not work. He wanted to keep this moment in his memory exactly as it was now. Them. Together. Warm and comforted. Sheltered within the cave where he had lain with Sherlock so many months ago. Where the harsh outside world did not seem to belong.
Sherlock likes to pretend John works here so he can afford his education.
Asking.
There are, however, many different types of magic and hers is a black one.
He hasn't really been here before.
Mycroft had loved Sherlock.
Leaving will kill him too.
“You think too much”, John says as he carefully stretches out his hand and places it on top of Sherlock's.
“We are still at a ball”, he replies, “we might as well try and enjoy ourselves for as long as it lasts.”
He has probably been sleeping on his arm wrong. And then, of course, there's the day he spent riding on horseback......and carrying Master Holmes to the bath.
Afraid of what will happen if John stays.
The one she has seen in Holmes' mind before.
That we are awake? It seems to me
But he finds that all he can think about now is Watson in his new blue suit. The one made out of expensive fabric. Tight and form fitting. Like a second skin. The colour making the blue of his eyes shine like the sky on a warm summer's day.
But tonight John has pulled them from me with gentle hands.
He'd still been high then.
It does nothing to help John clear his mind.
Just them. Entangled on John's small bed.
I'm just not sure if it's what I want anymore.
The sunburn on the bridge of his nose. Still visible by the warm light of the fire.
My phone is perched on top of a towel beneath the sink on the other side of the bathroom.
Not when he's not here.
John fluffs up his pillow and decides to attempt sleeping on his back.
“Oh, don't worry”, the sound of Sherlock's voice rumbles through his chest and head where their bodies connect and the sensation is both familiar and comforting, “I've had him upgraded to business class.”
The look on her face is inscrutable. It is as if a wall has been drawn up.
Ben scowls at me one last time when he answers John.
“Just a formality, Watson. Consider it your uniform for your new occupation.”
Greg doesn't take his eyes off of the road in front of him, the rain is getting heavier and traffic a bit more busy, but he does smile and shake his head.
He frowns some more as he looks at us.
“I just have to go home”, he says again.
That would make him look even weirder.
Nothing good will come of it.
He just hopes that, in this instant, it is.
John gives him an unsure and slightly worried look.
Running the household is a demanding job after all.
“What?....No!.....No?......Nooooo....walls!” he ended up saying. As if that explained anything.
He has to see this through.
When I manage to wake up sometime pretty close to noon my head is thrumming so painfully and so loud I am afraid the neighbors might hear it.
He is trying.
'Are you alright?' Sherlock asked again. His hands tracing gentle patterns on his back.
Not yet.
How do you not buckle and suffocate underneath the weight of it?
“Care to divulge on that, Watson?”
Mary.
“Well.....this day is just getting better and better. Pour me some milk then.”
Sherlock gives him a curt nod. It's all he is able to do at the moment. Had he thought being forced to spend the day without John was distracting, he now finds that being in close proximity to him is equally so.
Now there were consequences to his actions. Other people depended on him....on the things he did....the things he didn't do.....
As if they have personally offended me now that they are not interlaced with John's sturdy fingers anymore.
“Mrs. Hudson is in there”, she points towards a door in the back of the kitchen. John knows it leads to a large storage room. It's usually used to store large bags of flour or grain, sometimes Mrs. Hudson uses it to cure meat.
I should have gone into one of the stalls....locked the door......given myself some privacy at least......but it's too late now.
I nod but my feelings must be written all over my face because suddenly he is pressed back against me. Another soft kiss pressed swiftly to my lips. But it's too short and fleeting for me to truly enjoy or savor.
She hears the sound her footsteps make on the ground as she is moved forward against her will, her own laboured breath, the wind rustling in the trees ahead....the sound they make once again eerily similar to the buzzing of flies.
It's tradition.
He shakes his head again.
As usual I would like to thank everyone who's been with me on this journey from the bottom of my heart.
She hits the ground hard. The man is still holding on to her right arm and so she can only use her left one and her knees to catch herself.
'I love you Sherlock.'
Sherlock is curious now.
The bruises on my arms and legs turn yellow and green and ugly in a couple of days just like I knew they would.
Greg laughs again: “you have no idea how similar you and your brother are sometimes.”
He kissed John.
God....Mary....
“He goes beyond the Veil not to protect us or to look for clues about the weapon that could save us all if the Veil does break......he's looking for his brother.”
he thought to himself and only just managed to suppress a giggle.
'I'm sorry.'
They both just look so happy in it.
“Then you'll be going alone”, Holmes replied, “and without me you'll be useless there. You need me and my magic to draw upon.”
He nods.
He's had that medallion for years and it has never shown any signs of possessing extraordinary powers.
John twists the curls at the back of his neck around his fingers as Holmes tilts his head forward and closes his eyes.
Sherlock does not answer. He just hugs his knees and stares ahead unblinking.
The small spark shines just a little bit brighter.
Friction between them.
He´s biting his lip. John is pretty sure he´s not aware that he´s doing it.
But she had not seen her own Death.
Will do again.
After John's invitation to come and drink coffee at his house Sherlock had changed from his sweatpants and tank-top into a pair of dark jeans and a light-blue t-shirt. John had waited outside in the hallway while Sherlock dressed. Getting undressed in front of each other is something John would definitely like to see happen sometime but it is a boundary they need to discuss before they actually cross it.
“I.....”, I say again but Andrew just chuckles.
“No need to apologize”, he says, “I'd be happy to teach you.”
He doesn't know what couples do. How they act.
When he gets home this evening he will have to take a proper shower to get rid of it all.
“I love you.”
The light of the screen is too bright for my itching eyes and so I squint as I scroll through the app that handles my messages.
He doesn't look at me. He looks down at his hands.
He wonders if they suspect. If they, somehow, can sense what he is.....what he is not.
Molly would recognize that voice anywhere. On dark and lonely nights when horrid visions of the future kept her awake she would often fantasize about its owner climbing through her bedroom-window once again to keep her company.
Pulling Sherlock on his feet from his supine position on the floor turned out to be something he was still a little bit too drunk for. More giggling ensued as John just ended up falling on top of Sherlock and in the end they just settled for sitting side by side on the floor with their backs against John's bed. Sherlock's coat had been hung up on one of the bed posts.
“I'm sorry”, John says. But he's not really sure what he's sorry for. For his parents.....for crying.....for.....
Makes him want John to touch him.
“Soon.”
He is wide awake now.
One of the last things he does remember is a loud noise drifting up into their bedroom......
“He was so proud of the both of you”, my mother says.
A work of art.
Every mage that wants to join the Order needs to present him- or herself in front of them and is gifted one vision about his or her future.
His sister had been quick to move out and find a job in housekeeping somewhere.
Every other song seems to be a love song.
Nothing.
Mouth-wateringly gorgeous.
You eventually died in 1939.
The apartment number Sherlock gave him is situated on the second floor.
“Must have been a powerful spell you were under indeed”, Finn says, because of course...
John had really hoped the alpha would not think to look for him in the library.
Hospital.
“You're cute”, he says.
Holmes' frown deepens.
I hope this update was still enjoyable!
Molly looks at him from the corners of her eyes.
No matter what those people at the Order have told Holmes.
I'm just still so super pleased that there are still people reading it along with  me.
John was moping? Because
He's so tired but he can't sleep.
It reminds her of blood.
The smile on John's face is now a rather sheepish one as he scratches the back of his neck. It's a rather adorable look on him.
This day has been so utterly perfect so far, he finds he is loath to ruin it by digging too deep into all the events that have led them to where they are now.
Sherlock wasn't sure this place really existed.
He wants it to be fresh and new and....better.
As you once so eloquently put it yourself.
She no longer looks concerned.
“I was hoping you would assist me on a trip once again, I.....”
“You won't be any use to him dead”, Molly continues. This time Sherlock does seem to understand as he slightly raises his eyebrows.
John was always good in coaxing him outside.....on all kinds of adventures.
John's character, Demetrius, and Helena have a lot of scenes together after all.
Sherlock believes that The Order is at fault for Mycroft's disappearance.
At least some of the tension that had held his body in a tight grip over the last days left him, but he needed to know more.
As John climaxes his mind goes blissfully silent.
“We missed you at Eric's party!” Greg says.
I am so lost in my own thoughts that it takes me a couple of seconds to realize his hand is on mine.
He's thought about going in and talking to John so many times but every single time there have been things.....thoughts.....that hold him back.
“I figured as much”, he says, “John has been acting differently ever since you came back this summer.
John just shook his head. 'no...' but his voice was weak and his limbs felt as if they were paralyzed.
“When did you know you were gay?” He looks down at his hands as he asks it. He plucks at a loose piece of skin at the edge of his nail nervously.
He's pretty sure he can't handle another evening like that. He couldn't even handle the last one. That one had ended up with him throwing up all over John, the side of the road and, almost, the inside of Mycroft's car.
He knows Sherlock had felt it too.
And Second:  When, in Gaelic, you want to tell someone you love them you can use the phrase: "A chuisle mo chroí". Which translates literally to "The pulse of my heart."
“You cannot be serious!”
I know I've been terrible with updating this but I do write whenever I can.
******************************************
I've been feeling both hot and cold all day but my body is finally starting to decide on an emotion. I'm starting to get angry.
It makes him fearful of what's to come.
For letting John's outstretched hand just sort of hover there, in the void between them, that has grown greater and greater with every single day he has spent on his own.
John's tender fingers on his wrist, the side of his neck, John's lips on his only to disappear, his strong hands pushing on his chest......
Just as Mary had not been able to see the physical light of Holmes' magic she will also never be able to see the warmth and light that he brings to John's life whenever he is around him.
John smiles as well as he puts the flowers down on the small table next to Sherlock's bed and Sherlock does his very best to preserve every single detail of this moment in the tattered ruins of his mind.
“I've seen that boy before....”, Mycroft says.
He really hopes Greg isn't planning to pull a prank on him..... or spray paint his locker again.
His gaze is held captive by the pools of John's eyes and he finds himself happily drowning there.
He doesn't quite know what to say and so it is John who carries on the conversation once again:
Escaping the confines of Carterhaugh castle seemed impossible and not a day went by when John didn't curse himself for coming back here.
'Will you ever be able to forgive me?'
Time is strange.
He quietly holds his own breath as he waits for Sherlock to continue speaking.
Andrew raises his eyebrows again as he slides the paper back to himself.
To wait until there are enough of them.
I open up my contacts-list.
I don't think Molly is on her first beer.
Even sadder than usual and all of that sadness is directed at me.
**********************************************************************************
Watson does not seem as excited by this news as Sherlock thought he would be and it fills him with a small sense of pride.
John had seen no reason to correct her.
“It's called bioluminescence”, Sherlock had said. Because that summer he had been into big words. He used to sleep with the encyclopedia on his nightstand. Learning at least ten new words every day.
'Are you even listening to me, John?'
“An impossibly big arse.”
Maybe I should try and find Molly.
So Sherlock just answers in the same way he did over a year ago.
He laughs nervously to himself.
I'm all sharp angles where they shouldn't be, I've got my mother's pale complexion combined with my father's dark and messy curls. It makes me look harsh and soft at the same time but in a strange way that seems to fit less and less the more you look at it. I am the worst of both worlds. Sometimes I wonder what other disasters lay hidden within my DNA. Just waiting for time to unearth them and transform me into an even greater mess. But usually I try not to think about it at all.
“This?”
“I'm sorry to hear that”,  John says, “his loss, really.....you're amazing, you know that, right?”
“Andrew and I are just friends”, I say again.
Once again John's voice shakes him from his daydream.
Holmes' own voice is nothing but a hoarse whisper in the space around them but to John's ears it still sounds loud....too loud:
Tonight.
The elf, straight as a statue, staring ahead at the road and John, riding beside him, occasionally rolling his shoulder trying, and failing, to find some relief for his aching joint.
Once again he wonders how he's never seen it before.
And then the space between them gets smaller still as John leans against him. First their arms touch, then their shoulders, then John lifts the hand that is currently not resting on top of Sherlock's on the porch floor and gently cups Sherlock's cheek.
He's not sure he wants to know.
Upon seeing Finn again John wasn't sure how he felt as both hope and dread fought amongst themselves in his chest to gain the upper hand.
'I know.'
“What happened to him?”
To The All.
Anyway, let me know what you think.
“Mary has it.”
Maybe tomorrow he should try and confront Holmes himself.....maybe he should forget about him altogether.....maybe......
And with that the elf gets up and leaves the room. Leaving Sherlock confused, uneasy and very unsure about what that had all meant.
He probably should....
Slowly Holmes' jacket and shirt fell away from his body under John's gentle touch and the pale expanse of his chest was revealed. The skin there was just as pale as his face and John's smile fell as he softly placed his fingers against Holmes' neck in search of a pulse.
They were forbidden to let her see or hear them while they gathered information about her.
Maybe Mycroft has gotten to him.
There is a pull between them that cannot be ignored. It is like a force of nature. Like a storm or maybe the calm before it.
The blue eyes that shone with a light of their own and reminded him of highland waters, pure and bright.
John shakes his head again.
“........perhaps.....too hard on him...”
His older brother is looking at him with a worried expression on his face.
There is nothing to worry about.
And he still has absolutely no idea who it is.
“I bet you don't even know what card it is yourself.”
**********************************************************************
And yet I've got this sense of crushing disappointment.
“That's not how it works John. You can't set me up with a gay woman.”
“I doubt anyone will miss you until at least the afternoon”, he says.
“Where's the key, John”, Sherlock says.
Sherlock didn't like not knowing. Least of all when it came to John.  It was making him nervous. Sherlock also did not like being nervous.
He had sworn to himself that he would make sure to enjoy every  moment he and Mycroft got to spend together and paint the memories of them inside of his mind in the vibrant colours of spring. Every word spoken a melody he would still sing to himself centuries later and every gesture and touch planting a small seed in his heart that he would later make grow under the light of warm recollection.
As their giggles quieted down a bit it seemed as if Sherlock was going to say something else, but just as he opened his mouth the door to the coffee-shop opened again. Someone else craving a late afternoon coffee no doubt. But as soon as Sherlock's gaze met this new customer he closed his mouth again abruptly. Swallowing the words still unspoken and John could practically see all his walls coming back up again as the light in his eyes dimmed and his lips formed a tight expression where once the warm and soft smiles had been.
Sherlock feels uncomfortable and nervous. If the weapon has indeed been activated....if Watson is indeed the only one who
“Watson can hear everything we have to say”, he says, “I promised him I would tell him everything if you lived. And look! You're alive!”
The stranger turns around annoyed. Mouth halfway open. Ready to fling some well chosen curse words at whoever it is that has dared to throw him off his rhythm but as soon as he notices John standing there his mouth closes again.
John smiled as Sherlocks text echoed his earlier words. At least he wasn't the only one feeling miserable.
But then.....why does he still feel so hollow inside.
John will probably think it's creepy.
Awfully nice of John to try and include him a little bit at least but it's not necessary. He'll just not come along if they plan to do this again next week. He knows when he's not wanted. After all, he's got a lifetime of experience of it.
*******************************************
And she had crept in. And she had seen John.
Sherlock panics even more.
Not yet anyway.
He has small snippets of memories, like faded Polaroids, of her favorite blue skirt, back then at eye level for small Sherlock, as it swayed from side to side as she moved her hips to the cadence of the song she was currently humming.
'Beyond the mist', Holmes eyes shone like flashes of lightning now and before John could ask him anything else he had already turned himself around and was making his way towards to great doors that led outside.
The darkness swallows them greedily but I still know they're there. I can feel them at the edges and corners of the room.
Love.....
Sherlock can feel the warmth of his semen as it covers his own groin and abdomen.
At one point or another we all drown.
******************************************
They don't speak much when they are together.
Mike just laughs as he shakes his head.
The fact that Sherlock's brother is just standing there, looking at him, the look on his face somewhere between disgust and mild interest, surely isn't helping John feel any less uneasy.
Sherlock finds he is still not afraid.
to answer him.
****************************************
His plan might have worked, had he been able to keep himself from smiling while delivering it.
His answer is too fast. The explanation too easy. I know I should pressure him more, ask him more but his hands are on the back of my neck now and he's pulling me back against him and suddenly we're kissing again and his tongue slides against the seam of my mouth and I open for him willingly and now
It's why Sherlock tries to stay as far away from him as possible...generally.
John can now definitely still feel the traces of the alcohol he previously consumed coursing through his veins.
“Hey, Sherlock!”
Rain coming down in a blinding curtain. Cold, sharp and unrelenting.
He leans back against the wall, still trying to catch his breath.
“Is he a good kisser?”
Because those lands thrive on pain and misery.
Coming home feels like two pools of celestial blue that look at him as if he is something special and worth holding.
His face is wet and his vision has gone blurry. He can no longer see the shape of John just the blinding light of the setting sun taking his hopes and dreams with it as it sinks beneath the horizon.
Holmes is staring at the ground with a displeased look on his face.
He didn't. He doesn't.
“Please come along, Miss Hooper”, the soldier says. There is no magic in his words. It is just a friendly request but she follows it without hesitation.
I don't know.
Sherlock snorts.
With shaking hands, both from cold and just a hint of fear, he quickly put on some clothes and made his way down the small set of stairs that led from his room to the front of the barn area where the main doors were.
It had been agony.
Mycroft
Sherlock still says nothing. He still stares at the ceiling. Waiting for John.
He bites his lower lip and quickly tucks the dvd away safely in his backpack.
He picks it up for me and hands it back while also giving me a smile with far too much teeth as he slides onto the seat next to me that's usually left empty.
He gingerly makes his way to one of the empty chairs furthest away from the students who are already sitting there, slides it back from the table and sits down himself.
Sherlock finds that, in this moment, there is not a single person on earth he hates more.
These rooms are dusty. There are windows but they are covered by heavy curtains.
They talked a bit more as they rode on. Keeping their conversational topics light. Just something to pass the time. Enjoying each others company. And, John realized, he indeed found Holmes' company enjoyable. Very much so. Removed from the household and its clear hierarchy they felt more like equals or comrades than anything else and it made it very easy to talk to Holmes. Once again he was reminded of his army days. How his friendship with James had started. Friendly conversation to pass the time on their long marches. And over time they both had realized that they had felt more at ease with each other than they had felt with anyone else before. It had been nice. It had felt like coming home. Safe....John shook his head. Thoughts of James seemed to pop up unbidden more and more in his mind these days. He had no use for them now.
“He will be back.”
His cheeks heat up and he feels embarrassed that that's the first thing his mind takes him to.
When he finds out how ordinary John actually is.
There is no evidence of a dog anywhere in the house.
Immediately Sherlock looses what little appetite he has left.
They have to be.
About why he was late.
There is some noise from the background now. Some people shouting and for a moment John turns around and shouts something back. Sherlock can just make it out:
'Am I boring you, John?',  his teacher on omega etiquette asked.
“Tell me about your day.”
Have been before.
Finally it was Sherlock who spoke first.
“Fine.....fine.....you look......absolutely fine.”
- Mention of domestic abuse.
'I will when you get an A.'
He reaches past me and closes the door and locks it.
“Wha....?” Molly replies again. But it only takes her a couple of seconds to snap out of her John-induced haze. Her face lights up and she nods violently.
This....whatever it is....it's just stress relief.....it's just......
“Oh, my bad”, Patrick says, “it's just because you two are always together.”
Once again he is reminded of the fact that he knows nothing at all about Sherlock.
“Yes”, he says, the words half spoken, half breathed into John's own mouth as he kisses him again and again. Neither of them willing to put even an inch of distance between the two of them again.
“I....”  he said. Starting a sentence he had no idea how to finish as the supple curve of Holmes backside lay right before him.
Bill is lowering his voice just as John had done the last time they'd spoken to try and prevent the other recruits from overhearing, but, where John's raspy low voice had made Sherlock feel warm all over, the sound of Bill's nasal breathy whine makes his blood run cold.
'Maybe you should be', Sherlock said as, this time, he did extend both his hands and pulled John against him. Their foreheads once again close together as Sherlock's hands were held securely in the small of John's back and John's hands found their way into the raven curls he loved so dearly.
His brain feels too big for his skull, tearing him apart from the inside out.
He must have imagined it.
Maybe the end is all that matters.
Holmes answers him with a smile of his own and, once again, John can't help but notice what a good look it is on him.
“Oh?” he says again. He doesn't quite know what else to say. He doesn't know a “Miss Hooper”.....
“Yes, Mrs. Holmes.”
Holmes gives him a shrug and a sort of half smile as an answer.
'Well...I  have “a” license.'
And then he sees it.
Maybe he'll find something in there.
I try to take another panicked breath but in my dream I have already drowned.
Damn, chivalrous Rugby John.
Immediately his face turns serious again.
The corners of her mouth quirk up and she looks slightly younger for it.
“It's because you're so good”, he says. Which Sherlock finds a somewhat strange way of reasoning. If he's so good then why would he still need to practice? Would it not make more sense if John did most of the reading.
Mycroft gently nudges him with his shoulder.
It was surprisingly easy.
“Just get the key.”
Being what he was meant to be.
Nice and normal. A lot of people read. This is surely an acceptable answer.
'You don't need books', the alpha said, his voice now positively oozing, as he stepped closer, 'I can teach you a thing or two'.
She's probably just hiding in the back drinking iced-coffee and secretly smoking.
A feeling as if he's being watched.
He's not tired in the least.
A moment away from John and his hypnotizing eyes and the perfection of his smile and the complicated casualty of his company.
There is not much else in the room.
“I won't tell anyone, alright?”, he says.
John shook his head and followed. Sherlock seemed.....interesting.
'Where is your horse, sir?'
John chuckles again and once again a warm tingling sensation spreads from Sherlock's lower abdomen through his chest all the way to his head where it makes his face flush and his thoughts woozy.
“I'm so happy for you two.”
And.....
“Sorry....”
Because, in the end, endings are inevitable.
Miss Hooper's eyes widen in shock.
Of course she was here. It was only natural. Mary was a cheerleader. This is her scene. He watched her as she moved along the throngs of people. Dancing. Hugging someone every once in a while. Smiling....
John shakes his head again. The paramedic turns back to Sherlock.
***************************************************
“Finn.....can we please focus on the more important matters at hand?”
Sherlock is there and the soldier is standing by his side. Molly quickly scans the area behind them but the soldier's personal Death is nowhere to be seen at the moment.
John lives right across the street. They are bound to bump into each other at some point. Maybe John will even try and come over again.
I gently touch his bruised skin with the tips of my fingers, it's barely more than the hint of a touch, but he still tenses up.
John is relieved to find that Holmes is still asleep next to him. He isn't quite sure how he would have explained his presence in the same bed where his master has been sleeping....naked.
John did not reply. He just turned his head towards Sherlock. Acknowledging that he had indeed heard him. Still not smiling. Still miles away. And still all wrong.
That evening I turn myself this way and that in front of the bathroom mirror just so I can get a good look at all the places where John's grasping hands had left their marks on me as he pinned me against the sink.
I don't know what to do.
She gestured excitedly towards the hallway beyond the open door. John followed her inside. His earlier hesitation temporarily driven away by Mrs. Hudsons cheery nature. Good old Mike. It seemed he had taken every precaution to make sure John was well received here.
He had been just a small child himself back then but he is sure it was her.
She giggles again as she hides her mouth behind her hand. The gesture coy and slightly....flirtatious?
All because Greg awkwardly said hi to her once.
Not yet.
The male paramedic is breathing air into his still lungs while the woman checks for a pulse.
His heart beat so loud in his chest he was almost certain the riders would hear it, look in his direction and all would be lost, but the riders just rode on in the same determined pace. None of them looked anywhere but at their hands on the reins. None of them seemed to have noticed anything at all.
Finn had told Sherlock on several occasions that he was afraid Morgana was far too invested in him.
'Sssssh', he soothed, his voice calm and gentle, 'it's alright, John.'
And then, at long last, he was riding again, truly riding. The wind sweeping across his face once more, his horse's hooves thundering below him, making their mark on the frozen ground as the landscape seemed to fly by.
There is music.
Sherlock was standing next to John now as they both looked down at the cross. His arm around Johns waist. Holding him close as John leaned his head against his shoulder.
Intimacy.
Why now.
John sighed again and covered him with as much blankets as he could find. Saving only one for himself. He would sleep downstairs in the barn tonight. He'd make a bed of fresh hay to keep him warm. It would suffice. He'd slept at worse places in the army.
Sherlock should feel excited.
But somehow John does seem to understand the things he finds hard to say.
John liked it that way. His work lay with the horses anyway. Not the people.
“Please stay”, Sherlock says again. The words no more than a whisper in the space between them.
He was only let out briefly for about an hour at most every day and always under the watchful eye of his father.
Before John can give any more thought to this strange statement Holmes moves the conversation along.
As it turned out they had been heading for one of the nearby towns.
He closes it again and throws it somewhere near the pile by his desk.
And I remember yesterday. What he had told me, what I had said to him, what happened before....
Anything.
John smiles nervously and golden sunlight streams from every single pore of his skin as his eyes shine like blue opals inlaid with more gold.
“Why?”
They sit like that for a long time.
“I didn't know you were such a romantic.”
He's not ready for explaining. Not yet at least.
And so, in the end, she just heals him, returns to her own chambers and locks the door behind her.
'Girlfriend? No, not really  my area.' Another page got decidedly flipped.
“I'm sorry”, the woman says, “only immediate family beyond this point.”
James also has a girlfriend.
Too fragile to be spoken as a whole for fear that they might break.
It gives him time to adjust.
In her own dark world she screams in agony and the walls around her shake and tremble with the sound of her voice.
He fears that if he doesn't he might fly away into the night after all.
The candles on the nightstand flickered as he gingerly set himself down on the right side of the bed beside Holmes.
He just hadn't thought
“If it is indeed the Great Weapon and he is indeed the only one who can wield it then that rule shouldn't apply”, Sherlock replies.
Even retiring to a remote cottage in Sussex could not keep her forces at bay.
“I've already got plans this weekend”, I blurt out.
John will tell him he loves him and he will be able to say it back without feeling guilty and unworthy and without the shadows of the past stealing the words from his mouth, tainting them and warping them into something else.
He rubs the back of his neck just as he had done when I first saw him this evening and his shirt rides up slightly revealing a sliver of his abdomen.
He wants....
He wants to tell him but he also knows that what they have between them is still fragile and too much of it all at once might just break it.
Because John is not there.
He breathes in deep and tries to collect himself.
He only succeeds partially.
He tells himself he doesn't know what he wants.
As I get up and move towards the door I can't help but hope.
Apart from Mary there was another visitor John was starting to see more and more of in the stables and that visitor was Sherlock Holmes.
John places his elbows behind himself on the bed now as he lifts his upper body, leaning back. He's looking down at Sherlock who is still lying down. Sherlock's fingers are no longer nervously twisting the blankets. Instead he finds he is grasping onto them with clenched fists. Anchoring himself. John hovers over him and his throat goes dry and he finds he has a hard time swallowing.
John doesn't care.
turn into something else in the blink of an eye. Something dull and cold and unknown. Something that, until this day, had never existed between us.
Immediately John's mood fell again as he was reminded of a swarm of flies and a magpie. And despite the burning sun he felt a chill run up his body.
She doesn't see the soldier's death amongst the crowd.
And maybe I am being too impatient.
But, hey, it's been 40 chapters! The boys needed to get together at long last!
“Everything okay?”, he asks. Because, of course, John has noticed. Sherlock had rather hoped he wouldn't.
Sherlock clears his throat and shakes his head.
It's John.
You all truly keep me going. I am so humbled by all the love my ramblings have been getting.
Today will be....interesting.
Sherlock had laughed as he had tried and failed and, very patiently again, had broken down the names in smaller parts to make their pronunciation easier. John had managed to get a couple of them right that time around, but not many.
A very obnoxious, bratty younger brother.
I told him that I didn't want to be his dirty little secret but after last weekend I'm afraid that that's exactly what I'm starting to become.
And it is in that moment, as that mischievous smile Sherlock has known since the both of them were just children spreads over his best friend's face, that he knows absolutely nothing has changed between them.
Why is Sherlock here?
And....of course I do....because Molly is giving me one of her sadder smiles combined with some very pleading eyes and all I can think of is me telling her her lipstick wasn't fit for school and how happy and 'herself' she had been when we had gone to Patrick's party together and how nobody besides me seems to ever talk to her and calls her 'Crazy Molly' and.....I sheepishly fish  my phone out from underneath the table where it has been hiding on my lap.
The silence between us is awkward and unfamiliar and just as I start considering just forgetting about the bus and walking home he finally starts talking again:
'Has that ghastly fellow ever returned?' Holmes asked. A hint of amusement to his voice.
He opens his eyes carefully but, even though the curtains are drawn, the light in the room is still enough to blind him and send a sharp pain searing through his skull and he groans as he closes them again.
“He has to go.”
He doesn't know what it all means.
Hot damn.
Today was only an introductory class. See who shows up. Get a feel of the material for this season's performance. Tomorrow they will have their first actual class and Mrs. Scott will divide the roles. And after that.....a class every single week.....with John.
He gestures vaguely to where my clothes are in disarray and my curls dangle in front of my eyes because his demanding fingers could not stop pulling on them.
John chuckles once more and Sherlock can feel the vibration of it against his now spit-slicked lips.
Two boys on a beach without end like the coming and going of the tides at our feet.
He takes three more rasping breaths before his breathing evens out to something more calm and less desperate and feral.
His father however had not listened to any of his reasons. He had just shouted his own accusations over anything John had to say.
'No.'
Mycroft's heart aches for the boy.
Sherlock feels hot. He feels uncomfortable.
“Sorry. Continue”.
And he will ask him this time around.
He cursed under his breath.
The man was like one of those ancient statues. Nothing but perfect lines and curves. Not an inch of fat on him and muscles only where it mattered. The effect only enhanced by the pale, almost marble-like complexion of his skin.
He gives her a smile that he hopes is honest and comforting.
He is dying and he knows it.
She had brushed her hair, raised her eyebrows and thought: “that is indeed strange. I shall have to try and clean it off.”
Thankfully Andrew doesn't join us again at lunch-break but Molly keeps asking me if I've called him yet.
At first John had felt relieved, then anxious, nervous and pretty soon, as the hours passed him by, all those emotions melted together and turned into anger.
At this moment they both find the world perfect and flawless.
It had been nice.
The room is silent. The only sound to be heard the sound of their shared breaths, so close together.
'Hey!'
Sherlock started walking again. Making his way towards the light once more.
Its eyes are two pools of utter blackness, for a moment he thinks he can faintly hear the buzzing of flies and the flapping of wings but then the hand releases him and the sensation is gone.
He still looks helpless and lost. Adrift at sea.
Whenever that happens Sherlock usually tries to comfort him, calm him down, he'll talk to him, stroke his face and his hair, it only seems to work half of the time. The other half Watson usually wakes himself up screaming......or, one time, crying.
Humid.
Next chapter: Hooper.......probably.......
And I find I kind of want to do it again.
And she will make him remember that once more.
And so he just smiles in return but Holmes has already moved inside of the carriage.
But he still sleeps on.
John agrees with Mike. Of course he does. The place is a dive that any self respecting health inspector would shut down based on the outside alone. But he can't say that. Mike will never want to come here again. And then he'll never see “Tall Dark and Handsome” again. And so he just shrugs, takes another sip of his beer, pretends to like it and covertly glances at the dancing figure to his left.
At first John had resented her for it. Later he had admired her. That she could free herself so seemingly easily from the shadows of the past and lead her own life was something he desperately wanted to do too, but found he couldn't. However hard he tried.
“Is it Mary?”, he asks, “I bet it's Mary. She's been after me for ages. I bet she started that rumor herself.”
Sherlock just gives a grunt and half of a shrug in reply. He really wishes Finn would drop the subject. Would stop rubbing salt in the wounds. He feels bad enough about it already as it is.
He can't help but think of John.
Tonight, however, he feels he has to drink for quite the opposite reason. Numb himself and his nerves as he's being overstimulated by the presence of John Watson.
This decision, as it turned out, proved to be a good one, because on the fourth day: Finn returned.
He's not dreaming.
Both of them were quiet for a while again. John was suddenly reminded of what the headmaster had said to him. Before he had even met Sherlock. At the moment he had done his very best not to listen to the man and forget everything he had heard shortly after, but somehow this bit of information seemed to still be tucked away in his subconscious somewhere. Choosing this moment to rise to the surface once again.
At one point he hisses: “just shut up, Greg.” After which he actually turns around, looks at Sherlock and gives him a very odd facial expression.
“Yes....yes! Of course. I was just thinking about which spell I should use.”
So instead of talking he gestures for John to come inside.
But I shake my head.
Seeing John like this, on the road to the peak of his potential, he is reminded of everything John has written to him in his emails over the last couple of years.
“None of your business......just...nobody.”
“I don't know.....never?” John tries.
So John formed a tight seal with his lips and started to suck all the while rolling his tongue along Sherlocks shaft as he moved his hands from Sherlocks hips further back. Lightly tracing the seem of his arse still covered by his pants with just the tips of his fingers. This earned him another deep moan and both of Sherlocks hands where now firmly gripping his hair.
Maybe, John.....
Sherlock has been waiting in the dark in this hotel room for over an hour and John has not shown up.
This time John is awake.
Very nice really.
John lies on his back with his eyes closed and his bare chest rises and falls slowly and rhythmically underneath my hand. The motion reminds me of waves rolling onto the shore and the coming and going of the tides.
Sherlock groans again.
A horrible, deafening murmur.
He recognized some medicinal plants. Used for healing wounds, some could be ground up to make a salve that would cool a burn, others could be ingested when you were experiencing stomach cramps.
(See the end of the chapter for
All I've got back from John is a short:
John is more than a little intrigued. He has to admit that it feels really good to finally be completely involved with Holmes' plans and adventures.
Memories.
Fucking great.
Sherlock shakes his head. He's pretty sure he will never ever get a girlfriend.
He gives Greg another weak smile.
This could go all sorts of ways and I'm not sure if I'm ready for any of them.
“I just said that so you would give me the key.”
The smile was a bit more genuine now.
Was it really so wrong that he had followed along with his masters wishes?
But he does promise Sherlock he'll come back tomorrow.
It will be easier to notice him from the field this way though. That part can't be helped.
He is hungry and persistent. Taking everything I give him and more.
“Shouldn't we be watching “A Midsummer Night's Dream” instead?” he asks. Which is probably the least flirtatious thing he could have asked but he's starting to panic now.
John is already sitting close to him, there is not a lot of room underneath the tree, but, if he were to admit to being cold, John might decide to sit even closer.....maybe even put his arm around him.....
Oh great.
Beware, this is where the story earns its "mature" rating.
I can do that for him.
Gaping holes filled with the suffocating black of a starless night.
Sherlock gives him a doubtful look.
John doesn't reply, sensing that words are no longer needed, instead he just shows Sherlock as he softly traces his lips with his own and his searching fingers make a path through his curls.
He is going to hit me.
Far from it.
The same ageless face with the same genderless features looks out seemingly unseeing from underneath seven identical gray hoods.
John gives Mike another only halfway decent smile as he tips his glass towards him in a mock gesture of a toast.
“Fine. Then don't tell me.”
John turned around as fast as he could.
As did Watson. He kept on repositioning his shoulder. Finn had noticed him doing the same when they had ridden in on horseback together. An old wound that still bothered him, he supposes.
Hesitantly John smiled back at him.
Sherlock grits his teeth and drops his hands dejectedly.
He seems to be.....unsure.....uncomfortable?
John doesn't really understand why Sherlock keeps apologizing. He's done nothing wrong. Whatever is making him feel the way he's feeling now....it's all fine.
He probably means nothing to John.
“Are you enjoying our school?”
“Well, now is a bit too late.”
And then he looks up.
It's so blatantly obvious now.
He looks amazing.
'Yes. At all times.' The look on his face simultaneously hopeful and sad. Why did he look so sad today?
Finn just shrugs.
Will or won't Sherlock cross the Veil....
Sherlock's breath left his lungs all at once with a loud “oompf!” as his back hit the ground and John landed heavily on top of his chest.
He hopes he isn't.
Mary takes a step forward and John is only just able to suppress the sudden urge to recoil from her.
This time I do glance his way.
in the closet?”, he asks.
“Do you really think so?”
He feels he's positively vibrating with pent up rage and energy.
John smiles at him and the halo around them bursts into a prism of every color imaginable.
With Sherlock it's usually drugs or sex and with the former ruled out.....well....
Once again: a huge thank you to anyone who is (still) reading. It means the world to me and:
I can't do that to him a second time.
He also hasn't turned over a page in about 15 minutes.
John winces as Greg slaps him on the back....hard.
John opening the door for him.
He kissed Victor on that bed.
Another short silence follows before Bill continues.
But, alas, it has always remained a secret love. A love unrequited.
But the world is an awfully big place.
Mycroft's house, that is.
It might actually snow today.
If John wants to join the army then....that's what he should do. Deep down he knows this. He cannot let his own fear of losing John stop him from following his dreams. It wouldn't be fair. John is letting him go back to Eton. Without any complaints.
A hole just big enough for him to look through.
The tightness of his lips unwinds just a little bit as he does so. As he seems to remember. And the blue around him gains a faint hue of yellow, barely perceptible, around its edges.
He shook his head. It was a sick joke, but it was true.
John turned and handed the gun to Sherlock, “Keep an eye on them. I think Santos got to him first.” He jogged across the room and up the stairs. To his surprised, Lestrade was up and standing, his own gun poised on the missus, “What’s going on?”
As Olive finished answering all of Lestrade’s more burning questions, Anya was escorted into the room. She had tears in her eyes and nearly launched across the room at Olive, “Mi amor!” she cried, carefully wrapping her arms around Olive’s neck.
“It was her idea. I assume you got the profile of him when he got down there? Susceptible. She was the one who started this.” Mrs. Santos smiled wryly, cuffed to the room’s radiator, “Is she still alive?”
He felt Sherlock’s searching his back, “Are you… are you leaving me?”
John stood up, pushing Sherlock’s hand away, “Stay calm? That’s rich coming from the person who was scared to take that final step years ago. You were afraid of nothing when I met you, Sherlock, and then you
John pulled his safety and fired, hitting Mary right under the kneecap. She dropped to the floor like a felled tree, gun skittering away from her. John looked to Sherlock, “Take her gun. Downstairs. Now. Go.” He didn’t argue, “You underestimate me, Rosamund. He’s not my fucktoy and I’m not pining. He’s always been the love of my life. Always has been. He’s just too good of a man for me.”
Mary grinned, her pearl white teeth glinting, “Simple, what I’ve always wanted. You. You, all to myself once and for all. No idiot consulting detective standing in the way.”
John did. He would never admit it, but he knew Sherlock was right. This was the third case they had gone on together this month, John’s only excuse to be around Sherlock. Mary had all eyes on him at all times now. He watched in the mirror as his own face fell, dull eyes and frown lines returning. Sherlock, now dressed in his pants and trousers, walked back over to him, curving a hand around his face.
“And hey,” Greg called after them, making them turn, “I’m happy for you two. It took you long enough to figure it all out.”
Sherlock stood and walked over to John, turning him around, “John, look at me. Please.” John did, “I know there’s turmoil in you brain right now, as there is in mine, but we need to keep ourselves composed. For Rosie’s sake.”
That simple fact made John’s mind up.
Another coughing fit started up as Sherlock continued his research. This time, it’s not a small, speckled petal, but rather what looks to be a few small yellow buds of a larger flower. Acacia.
“Sherlock, do you…” John clears his throat, “do you still have it?”
“How can you compartmentalize this so quick? I understand you have the intellect, but this is my daughter. I can’t do it.”
Molly. It will
wife from his place on the stage, he could feel Molly’s eyes on him. She knew. She could see that every part of this was draining him. But Sherlock kept up a good front. He smiled at John, threw his boutonniere to Janine, and left the wedding early after telling John and Mary the news.
Sherlock held John still as he tried to dive back in to kiss Sherlock again, “I love you, John. I always have. I always will. I love you.”
John twirled the small bloom between his thumb and forefinger, just staring at it, “Alright.” He sounded defeated, “I won’t ask you to.”
He would never get the surgery.
After he met John those dreams became more frequent. Those, and the nightmares he started having after the Pool. The ones where it didn’t end the same way, and the ones where Moriarty succeeded in burning his heart by taking John. He never told John about those, not until years later.
Then he heard a familiar voice. Granted, it was speaking Serbian, but it was still Mycroft. He was here to get him out. Sherlock let the exhaustion and trust for his brother take over.
She babbled nonsense as John slowly walked into the kitchen, firmly placing himself in the role of doting husband. He kissed Mary’s temple, “Sorry, love. Statement took a bit longer than we thought. I got out as soon as I could.”
John’s mind snapped to attention.
“Nothing makes any sense, Sherlock! That’s a fact of our lives at this point!
Olive sat in the middle of the room, bound to a chair, drying blood on her face, eyes closed. Sherlock rushed forward as John heard footsteps behind him. He pulled his gun from his waistband and whirled around, ready to fire. A man, similar skin tone to Olive, stood before him, baseball bat in his hands, “No one was supposed to find her.”
“No, not at all,” Greg said, motioning to the open door, “By all means, take your time.”
“Olive Santos, twenty-two, last seen by her girlfriend Friday morning. Said she was going back home to her parents to try and fix their relationship. The girlfriend, Anya, said that Olive only meant to be gone a few hours, but she had hope that everything was going well. It was when Olive didn’t answer her calls that she got worried,” Lestrade said, handing John a picture and file. He looked to Sherlock, who had his hands already steepled under his chin.
He picked her up and kissed her cheek, “Hello, sweetheart. How was your day?”
Mycroft laughed, “Not quite. Uncle Myc is going to do everything he can to make sure you’re not sick anymore, but you’re going to have to be a big girl. Can you do that, Rosamund?” Rosie nodded, smiling, then putting on her brave face like she did for John and Sherlock the day of her tests. Mycroft smiled back, “That’s my girl. How about I take you back down to Nana Hudson so I can talk to Daddy and Sherlock? I think she was about to bake some biscuits and could use some help.”
“Yes. One thousand times yes!”
“Parents?” he asked. Sherlock nodded vaguely, eyes staring off. John looked down at the file. In the photo, Olive was smiling, tucking a piece of dense, dark, curly hair behind her ear. Dark skin, kind brown eyes, wearing a South Bank jumper, “Have you asked the girlfriend where the parents live?”
Sherlock, with his uncanny ability, caught them a cab in less than a minute, not looking at John as he slid in the backseat. John, in a gesture of solidarity, placed his hand palm up in the seat between them. Sherlock took it, still facing away from him. John could see the tears falling in the reflection in the window.
John sighed, “Good. I don’t want her last memory of her mother to be one where she’s being escorted out in handcuffs.”
“Someone long gone,” he whispered. He took the flowers to the open window and threw up the screen, dropping the blooms to the street below. When Sherlock looked up in the glass pane above him, though, he saw the disdain on Mary’s turned away face. She knew.
John pulled back and cradled Sherlock’s face in his hands, “Do you mean it? Don’t say it if you don’t mean it.”
“John, please don’t be obtuse.” Sherlock was pleading. It seemed to John that he would fall to his knees and fully beg before long.
John nodded, and they exited the car. Lestrade walked up to the door and knocked, “New Scotland Yard, Mr. and Mrs. Santos. Open the door.” The three men stood still for a few moments, waiting for an answer. When one didn’t come, Sherlock nudged Lestrade out of the way, turning the knob. The door opened soundlessly.
John swallowed as tears lined his vision again, “What if she doesn’t get older, Sherlock? What then?”
“You’re right, she’s not, but I vowed to protect her. Albeit this isn’t the threat I thought would come, but nevertheless.” His chest was rising and falling in quick succession, “Before she was born, when she was born, after everything, I swore I would always put her first. Always. Mycroft will give us the best chance. The best doctors, the best treatment, whatever the cost. Please, John. Let me call Mycroft.”
Sherlock leaned across the space between their chairs and placed a hand on his knee, “John, I know your mind is running a million miles a minute, but please, stay calm.”
“Are you serious right now, Sherlock?”
John nodded, placing his ear to Sherlock’s heart, letting everything drain out of him, trying his best to believe the man in front of him.
“No!” Sherlock shouted, standing, looking down at John, “I don’t want to forget, John. Don’t ask me to.”
John shook his head as a million thoughts flew through his mind.
Sherlock shook his head and whispered, “Careless. I don’t think they’re home.” He looked around, taking it all in, “Basement. Quietly. Lestrade, stay by the door at the top of the stairs, John, come with me.” John nodded, following.
It was a few hours until Sherlock was ready to leave the room, only to find John sitting in his old chair, arms crossed, staring straight ahead, blankly, “Good morning. Feeling better?”
Sherlock sat back on his heels and gazed at the floor, slightly crestfallen. He shook his head and stood up, studiously not looking at John, “I’m going to see if Rosie and Hudders need any help.” He left the flat before John could respond. The only thing ringing in John’s ears as he left was his denial of
He’d just walked out of the bedroom, intent on making his morning tea, when the sound of Sherlock’s voice stopped him, “You’re angry.”
“You’ve met my mother, Inspector. And my father. There’s no doubt in my mind.”
Sherlock’s arms tightened around him, “And I want you to stay. I know last week I made it seem like I didn’t but I do. I want you here all the time. I don’t want hotel rooms and lunch break takeaway every other week. I want to be the one you come home to.”
"What's going on here?" came a voice, and in doorway was Henderson, in the flesh. He was taller than Rosamund had imagined, and thicker around the middle, with glasses and thinning hair. In his arms was a gun, held sturdily by an experienced hand, though it looked odd coupled next to the man's bedhead and pajamas.
"Almost." And yet his advanced mind can't help but latch onto the 'our' in that statement. 'Our friends' seems almost resolute, almost like a couple.
After that, Greg made an effort to come to every match, more to watch his top consulting detectives than anything else.
"I want to check in, see how you and the Watsons are holding up. As you already stated, John seems to be doing fine."
"Yes, Rosie, I'm sure Sherlock is very sorry for jutting in," John murmured, sending a pointed look in the genius' direction. An impossibly small shrug, as was customary, was the only response. "And there's no pressure to decide anytime soon. But, if you'd like to be called 'Rosamund Watson-Holmes' on official documents, then we can arrange for that." The teenager stood up and pressed a kiss to the doctor's cheek.
"You're incredible. Absolutely incredible," Reyna said with uttermost sincerity in her voice. "I mean it, Rosamund. You're the most brilliant person I've ever met." The blonde scoffed.
- and brought her revolver down onto the back of their attacker's head with vigor.
But he's John Watson, and therefore the exception. Rosie is going to have not only her father's amiable qualities and kindness, but the Holmes brilliant streak, if the detective has anything to do with it. It's the least he can do, giving her the tools she needs to succeed.
"And I suppose your day was alright, too?"
, John," he said softly, shifting closer still. "I was not going to be the one to take that from you. It was the least I could do, after all we'd been through. You deserved happiness."
Even Rosamund's intense prying couldn't shake their matching grins, though, and as she fires questions at them, John and Sherlock exchange glances in an unspoken communication. Molly can't tell if they're bemused or annoyed or, just possibly, a healthy mix of both, but reading people has never been her strong suit. She will leave that to them.
"Here you are," John interrupted neatly, holding out another steaming cup towards Mycroft, the spoon bobbing along inside. "Do you still need me to leave, or are you done conspiring yet?" The dark haired man nodded.
"Really?" he hummed, starting to laugh. "I've got to see this."
"When I was hanging out with Dad. When I was talking with Aunt Molly. When I was baking with Mrs. Hudson." He nods, ever so slightly, a spark of understanding that she can almost perceive hanging in the air.
"Thank you. I think." Then the consulting detective immediately began to scowl magnificently again, for thanking Mycroft for anything left a rather unpleasant taste in his mouth, much akin to nauseating chemicals in a lab.
"But you enjoyed it."
"Forgive me, Watson, but I actually have no idea why I'm in St Bartholomew. Could you please refresh my memory before scolding me for being unconscious?" With an incredulous, terrified look, John sat on the foot of his bed.
They made due to the best of their abilities, really - Rosie wasn't ever neglected or anything. They tried to give her structured attention and meals and nap times. In fact, John and Rosie had moved back into 221B. This was for a variety of reasons. Convenience of proximity to Sherlock and to work were major factors, Mary's absence another. The army doctor was much better - honestly, he was astoundingly fine, given his easy ability to get attached to everyone - but still, seeing the flat that him and his wife made a life together in caused his eyes to droop, his pace to slow. It dragged him down, every single inch of him, ever so slightly, and Mary would never want him to suffer.
"Too . . . ornamental, I guess. It's all flowery and meaningless and I
An anomaly, his daughter, but had he really expected the spawn of John to be anything less?
"Well, then," the government official said, a grin slowly eating away at his face. "Marriage certainly has changed you. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Watson-Holmes, and try not to muck everything up too soon. The separation paperwork alone would be a nightmare." Encouraging, as ever.
. For someone so smart, he can be so remarkably idiotic.

"It would be a punishment for you, too."
The notion was

working. I'm investigating the dangers this dog would pose to our research. I've come to the conclusion that Bailey is friendly."
"You'd think that after all that trouble he'd ditch the quill and ink he utilized. Perhaps he wanted the option to 'discover' more iconic drafts later down the road. A lucrative scheme, if the first selling went well." With that, Rosamund got up, extending a hand to her best friend. "Come up, Rey, we've got to go talk to my parents now." As Lestrade knew he wouldn't get any more out of either girl tonight - God knew Rosie never did anything she didn't want to - he and his team took over, securing the unconscious body of the historian and carting him into the back of a cruiser. Surely there was more than enough evidence to mark him down as guilty, anyhow.
"An experiment? Just one, really?"
Maybe that was just the wine talking, though. It's entirely possible, after three glasses.
"Your wedding, actually." John's eyelids are no longer drooping.
"To thank them for raising Sherlock

every second she's with Rosie and the little girl loves having her around.
So. Rosamund is finally following in her fathers' footsteps.
The detective almost feels embarrassed, thinking about it.
"Shut up. Stop talking, little girl, or I'm going to fire." Rosamund's eyebrows arched.
"And wouldn't that have been just

"Rosamund," he starts, not really knowing what to say. Her behavior is illogical, without prior pattern, and social interaction has never been his strong suit. Too unpredictable. "What's wrong?"
However, there was one person she knew who was enamored with writing, clever, and would be more than happy to partner up with Rosamund on this endeavor.
"You mean feelings, I take it?" Feelings. Sherlock had never been fond of the phrase. Feelings meant serious attraction, the kind with empathy, and empathy lead to an unbreakable attachment and he really can't stand to loose anybody like that. Anybody he cares too much about, though it may be a little too late for that now. Not saying anything, letting John have his space, hadn't stopped anything from developing, anyhow.
like this is somehow funny, I'm very well aware of what I'm like to coexist with,
"I should hope so, John. For a very, very long while." This was how it started, he thinks. John's descent into a committed relationship once more was a startling, very ordinary conversation, and yet a lever had been pulled.
dating and becoming remarried. We're all over the map. I am an absolute mess of a human being. When I first met Sherlock, I had no idea why I was even still alive. PTSD, bullet wounds, no real connections and a very vague concept of where I would be staying - that was me, when I walked in. I needed a fresh start, but I didn't have anything to believe in. And yet, you, Sherlock, took one look at me and knew everything there was to know. You were absolutely brilliant. You have no clue what you did by just giving me a purpose, by allowing me to be your best friend. You gave me back my life, and from that day onwards, my world started to center on yours. Thank you for being here, for not giving up on my ordinary self through everything - through every argument, every injury, every struggle in raising Rosie. Thanks for choosing me." Molly didn't quite know how, but she had started to clap. A glance over at the other guests confirmed that they were doing the same, though, so she didn't feel too out of place.
Rosamund adored her family dearly, but one thing was for certain; she was going to change things, and she was going to change them whether her fathers wanted it or not.
In the next month, they go out another four times.
This was a strategic move, the end of an era. She might never get married and have children like she's dreamt about as a little girl. Molly Hooper, with her sweet smiles and gentle attitude, was made for motherhood, for nurturing. She quite liked the idea of taking care of people, of being taken care of, and perhaps this was why she had fancied Sherlock Holmes for the longest time. If anyone was in dire need of affection, of being watched over, it was Sherlock, with all of his midnight locks and bright eyes. He was intriguing, a rare and beautiful creature, but a broken one nonetheless.
"Sherlock's still Sherlock," he says, clearing his throat and giving his daughter a sideways glance. "It doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's not exactly a full blown
"That's all I needed to know, Sherlock." He said, despite his brother's sudden glimpse of a steel backbone, smiling slightly and twisting his umbrella authoritatively. "He's never going to stop staying, either. He loves you."
Reyna, though fit for her age, could hardly compete against a fully grown and far heavier adult. She was clearly loosing her once ironclad grip on the tiny pocketknife, but she squirmed and struggled and kicked to the best of her ability, blindly reaching for anything of use on the floor.
"So do you. At least I don't relive it surreptitiously through blog posts, John." There was a moan muffled by the covers.
"I don't need this, I was just guilted into buying it. You could probably use it right now." She blinked before slowly taking the tiny glass from his fingers.
a detective, aren't you?" the eldest stated, letting lose a rare, rather amused smile, as though a puppy had just performed a trick.
with other children, especially - but he always addresses her like she matters, like she's an adult. He leaves her a present on Christmas every year, and if they're lucky he'll deliver it himself. Sherlock always frowns when he opens the door, and the way his face scrunches up at the sight of Uncle Mycroft makes Rosamund giggle uncontrollably, but he always wishes them happy holidays and leaves behind some cookies, which Rosie thought was awfully nice. He's weird, her other uncle, and not so straightforward and pleasant like Lestrade, but she assumes it's because he's just a little lonely.
Surprised.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Jessabelle Norton, actually, but close enough," Rosamund corrected, hefting her duffel bag. "I've got my stuff right here, so just pick me up at noon tomorrow. You have the address, Dad?"
"Logic alludes this, doesn't it?"
"John . . . " Predictably, the detective lost that battle and ended up snatching the glass from his partner's hands in a fit of annoyance. Lestrade shot Molly a glance that said 'you're seeing this, right?' while they bickered.
Suddenly, it clicked.
It was at this time that Molly made her escape, shaking her head and slipping out the door unnoticed.
"Bloody hell, did you seriously shove a
"Very, but can't anything be dull and petty in the right circumstance?" Rosamund scowled, though it didn't reach her eyes.
"Boys, boys, your daughter has the ball," Molly had interjected, effectively cutting off further argument. Then, they had calmed down, but then two weeks later:
John Watson is wearing a nice shirt and cologne.
"You're overreacting, Watson."
"But, to be clear, you'd be alright with it? A date," the brunette added, slightly too quickly, and she silently cursed herself for doing this. Years without romance had obviously robbed her of proper social graces.
"You'd date a man? I thought you were straight."
"Consulting detective, actually," she corrected without turning around. She could hear her best friend's laughter the entire way up the stairs.
"Of course," Reyna intoned, shaking her head. "You enjoy these opportunities to show off, don't you?" Rosie snorted.
Everything is blissfully abnormal again, and it suits their family like a glove, she supposes. Just the three of them.
That had to be the nicest thing he had ever heard his brother say, and it wasn't even a compliment.
Sherlock is almost entirely certain he is in love with his partner, which makes this whole thing so strange. He's been steadily falling for quite a long time, he believes. This is why, after a year of midnight violin practices, silly outings, exchanged snogs, cups of tea, and simply being together, he rolls over in their bed and pokes his significant other awake. He has something he's wanted to say for an achingly great period of time and it's been keeping him up.
"How am I supposed to top that, Sherlock?" he said, trying not to grin uncontrollably. "You realize anything I say now is going to sound weak in comparison."
Perhaps
Somedays, Sherlock wonders if this is the closest he will ever get to raising children of his own. He'd never really given the notion much thought - who would endure marriage to him long enough to produce offspring, after all - but Rosie had long ago started calling the strange man she lived with 'Dad' once the proper syllables were established, and really, Sherlock never bothered to correct her. If it helped, John was referred to as Daddy. Far more use of sentiment, he's certain.
"You're being irrational."
"I'll put on a new kettle. Drop off your bags and we'll get started, then." Reyna shot her a sarcastic salute.
If nothing else, it could be said with conviction that John Watson adored his family, possibly more than life itself.
"Okay, that's pretty amazing."
The thought had never crossed her mind, but were her fathers married? Did they even love eachother, like all the other children discussed?
"Hey, I do, too!"
elementary, weren't they?
"What makes you think I knew?"
"Just a flesh wound?" Watson sprang up, walking to the side of his partner's head in two short strides. "Just a
Besides, their line of work was a heavily demanding profession. Rosamund would soon need more space than just her room; she will need a full office and laboratory for cases and equipment storage, and her own way of storing and analyzing data in depth. And, if Reyna was to be on hand at all times, than she would require a bedroom right next door. It's the most efficient way to have full access to someone at any time.
" The ex-army man shuddered with a frightening, melancholy laughter. "Me, irrational? Sherlock, I thought you died again. I thought I
"True, but then again,
"I hate school," she muttered, crossing her five year old arms.
John Watson, she believes, is
"That doesn't mean you have to be excluded from it, you know. You could have bullied your way back in."
"Of course you'd think so."
As the end notes are enormous, I'll try to take up as little of your time as is humanly possible.
," the young girl groaned, sagging backwards into the giant chair.
, after all. And I gave her permission to come, actually."
About thirty minutes in, Greg stood up and tapped on his glass with his spoon. Many people were confused by this, as there hadn't seemed to be any reason to interrupt the endless eating. However, the traditional speech of the best man wasn't delivered yet, and it had been proposed that it be given in the middle of the brunch so everyone would already be silent and stuffing their faces. Unorthodox, yes, but wasn't everything revolving around John and Sherlock?
"Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back," Rosamund quipped, giving him a reassuring beam.
She sat down at the far end of the bleachers, just like any other time, watching the rugby girls' lucrative business with a chuckle. In another life, they might have been wonderful con artists.
He was actually making an effort.
She had a grandma named Mrs. Hudson who lived right downstairs and bakes cookies with her - from scratch, she might let you know - every weekend, and Rosie's gotten quite good at assisting with shortbread. It's her favorite thing to make, she thinks, because it takes the longest to cook and that means she can bask in the warmth of her grandmother's kitchen, swinging her legs and listening to stories. Some are fairy tales, some are old memories, and some are the details of mysteries long since solved. It's the mysteries she loves the best, she believes, because Mrs. Hudson will talk about a tall man in a silly cap and his wonderful best friend, and Rosie will laugh as she tries to imagine her father doing all of those crazy things. She's not dumb - the smartest in her class, actually, as her teacher says - and she knew from the very start that those made up cases were the adventures of the men living right upstairs. But still, they sound so much
"John's an anomaly," the dark haired man muttered, settling back into his chair and hiding his self inflicted scrutiny with his tea cup. "Not me. He's . . . "
"You're . . . not offended? Not, I don't know, disgusted?"
This time, instead of pushing up, he blindly grabs for a button on the underside of the bed. With a self satisfied grin of success, he pushes the top arrow, and the headrest elevates slowly. A typical feature in the new models.
If you're still with me this far, again, the story will have about three components, it will be uploaded to once a week starting today, and you should really give me feedback because I thrive off of validation. It's one of the things I need to live.
"As miraculous as it is, John, I haven't rested in over three days, and as soon as we get home we'll be back on the case. I'm not getting anything done now, so I might as well sleep."
, for god's sake, was bad enough. Greg Lestrade would be far worse. He could never hide behind stoic attitudes and severity - he would tell her outright that he thought she was lovely, but not in
Giving the medallion back wouldn't work anyway.
They need these borrowed days to extend their own lives.
'Of all the placed to find you', she said and laughed, 'what on earth are you doing in the library?'. The last word coming out as if it was something dirty.
With inhibitions lowered people would be far more willing to accept someone they didn't know yet in their midst.
Holmes has been very quiet on the ride back to the inn.
When he's sure that Sherlock has seen it he gives him a wink and quickly paints over it again.
The sound reminds her of an owl screeching in the night just as it is about to pounce on a field mouse.
Sherlock lets out a shaky breath.
The world outside temporarily forgotten, their cave far too small for its harsh cruelties, sadness and inescapable pain.
Sherlock has come for her. She knew he would.
Of course: there was a version of John in his mind palace. This sleeping, angelic version haloed by moonlight seemed to fit in perfectly. A version of John to calm Sherlock's racing mind. He had pinched himself and had rubbed his eyes until he had seen stars.
'Because people at these kinds of parties tend to do stupid things.'
it cannot be the truth, “She did ask me to get you.....or at least that's what I thought she wanted.....maybe I misunderstood her....you know how hectic things are in the mornings....busy, busy, busy!”
This is usually the case with me.
His eyes were actually cast downwards as he squinted slightly and suddenly John remembered what he had said about the sun earlier that day.
He gives me another smile. There are stars in his eyes. And then the door closes and he is gone.
“Oh...but it wouldn't just be the two of us”, John interjects, “I was talking to Molly about it earlier and she's coming too. We'll be like a study group.”
“Will you teach me how to use your magic?”, he clarifies.
Like a little light that shines from within constantly. Betraying, to Sherlock anyway, who they are.
That last night John had not fucked him. John had made love to him.
“Woah”, John says as his gaze follows the tiny specs of light up into the dark until they fizzle out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Finally Sherlock looked up at him again. A soft smile once again forming on his lips and John not only felt himself fill up with sunlight again, but this time the light seemed to be moving inside of him too as it tickled him just underneath his skin. It was a nice feeling.
This is a message.
He did not however have long to admire the naked body before him, because soon Sherlock's lips were pressed against his own again and John closed his eyes.
There is an arm slung over his chest pinning him to the mattress.
(See the end of the chapter for
He lets out a pained laugh. It sounds cold and harsh in the blackness of his bedroom. It reminds him of a wounded animal.
Sentiment.
John wouldn't miss it for the world.
Night around them is falling fast but has not dropped her inky cloak around the world entirely so for the moment Master Holmes and his horse find themselves enshrouded in velvety dark blues and purples.
What he wants to say but can't say.
The first time he met Greg, Sherlock was being arrested. By Greg.
Miss Hooper looks him over for a moment. Her gaze heavy and almost like a physical weight. It's making John even more uncomfortable. He shifts in his chair once again. Unable to sit still.
That evening Sherlock is quiet during dinner. Once again he's moving his food from one side of his plate to the other without actually eating it.
Everything in his mind-palace is there because Sherlock has willed it to be there.
Like Watson, Sherlock holds it in his outstretched palm and, as before, a whole lot of nothing continues to happen.
'How are you feeling?' dream Sherlock said.
I am surrounded by voices and music from every direction and I feel as if I'm spinning and falling but he anchors me with his thumbs through the belt-loops of my jeans.
he thought.
The wintry chill seemed to have climbed into every fiber of his being as it made a home out of his bones. His leg seemed to have gotten the worst of it and today John found himself unable to do anything more than limp along.
'He gave it to me.'
“I.....”, Sherlock starts but then stops talking. He wracks his brain and memory for a reason but....he just doesn't know......he had a reason......right?......surely he did.....a very good reason.....he just.........”I don't know” he ends up saying.
John chuckles.
He doesn't know what being alone with Sherlock in a room will be like.
********************************
John says nothing as he looks his fill and this silence, only broken by the crackling of the fire in the fire-place covered with the old ashes of a dozen or so fires Sherlock was too lazy to get properly cleaned out, does nothing to calm his nerves.
Oh well......he's never had a magical drink before.
He wonders where exactly John
“Can you stand?”
It had sadness in it and scary bits and fairies and magic.... and love....it was their story.
I reach the supply-closet before John does so I end up hanging around the hallway awkwardly for a couple of minutes.
The lovers that have shaped Watson in this glorious juxtaposition that he is now.
Sherlock stares out of the window at the passenger side as he tries to predict in which pattern the raindrops that hit it will fall while the radio plays in the background.
He had wasted too much time.
I just give a sort of half-shrug in reply and bring my attention back to this letter.
He has a lot of thinking to do himself as well anyway.
I cannot hold them and they cannot hear me.
“Are you alright?” Sherlock says.
“You've changed”, John says.
Not about anything that really matters.
Even though the spell over him seemed to be broken he was still very hesitant to set foot on what had, effectively, been his prison for so many years.
“I'm sorry”, he says again.
It is the place where he stores everything he knows about John Watson.
With his parents always gone, Mycroft is literally all he has.
There had been something between them once, hadn't there?
“I met him at Eric's party”, Molly says, “we....kind of hit it off there......we've only been dating fairly recently though.”
Involuntarily he claws at his flesh and pulls his hair but anything he does only seems to make it worse.
It breaks his heart to have to say no but he positively can
And as always: I love every single person who is reading this story to the moon and back.
It's probably best if he just left.
Part of him doesn't know what he feels.
His fingers desperately trying to remember this.
Have some form of freedom and being his own person before the narrow-minded beliefs of his father and many alpha's with him would condemn him to a life of being stored away like something that was easy to break and have someone else make all his decisions for him.
When they enter Sherlock's dressing room the first thing Sherlock notices is that Mary isn't there anymore.
“If people don't find you in the stables or at breakfast this morning they will probably just assume you've gone out early to get work done in the gardens and orchard. They'll just go on and continue with their own duties as the day progresses....now if people can't find you in the afternoon either....that's when questions will start to rise....”
It was colder than he had expected and his skin turned into goosebumps. He didn't mind much. After the heat of the day it was a welcome cold.
It’s almost as if someone from the other side is helping his magic along. Wants him to travel through….
They spent the rest of the afternoon talking about trivial things. About how warm the sun was that day. About which of the flowers they liked best. About what type of bird they thought they heard singing at the moment.
“Are you that embarrassed about me?”, I say and my words hurt him, I can see that they do, but I'd rather have him hurt than pretend he doesn't feel anything at all.
Sherlock is quiet at dinner.
The reign over all of my lands when they do has to count for something.'
“And the alcohol”, John ventures, “that helped too.”
“Mycroft.....why don't you have a girlfriend?”
“Will you be alright?”
It is part of the mirrored world that lies beyond the glass.
“Myc...”
The class is almost over now.
Not in the least bit because he also completely lacks the nerve to do so.
They have a demon to find and probably kill.
“Hmmmm?”
Perhaps I have been staring at you for a bit too long.
'Sherlock?' his voice soft with a hint of panic barely contained underneath the surface.
'I would have come, had I heard you.'
Once again he looked at their interlaced fingers. Once more he gently squeezed before extracting his hand and quietly getting up.
“Hey, Victor.”
“Why not?”, John gives a halfhearted, blasé shrug.
Maybe....
“Is everything alright, Sherlock?”
(If you like you can visit me on Tumblr. I'm Vanimelda4 there as well)
Like a story already written.
“Fine”, he says, “tell her I will be down shortly.”
He gave John an apologetic smile.
He finds the concept quite hard to grasp.
“Couldn't stop thinking about you all weekend.....”, he says.
To them.
“If I am right, I'm sure it will make an exception this time.”
'No', John replied as he folded his arms in front of him, 'it does not.' He wasn't sure how Holmes knew about his former career, having only been back for a day, but he was not about to play along with whatever game he was playing. If Holmes secrets were his own then certainly so were Johns. He had taken on this job to forget about his past. Not to be reminded of it. If he was about to be fired then so be it, but he would go with his dignity intact.
They need to act fast.
I turn my head to the side and look at John. His back still turned towards me. Strong and straight in every sense of the word.
They always do.
“Wait.....
Somehow it feels more important than any prophecy or impending doom combined.
As if he can barely hold it all.
Holmes cleared his throat again before answering: 'fairly simple too really. The way you stood when you were waiting for me to reply during our...conversation. Like a soldier standing to attention waiting for a command from his superior. Force of habit that all military men develop when they've been in the armed forces for long enough.'
Holmes makes his way back to Holmes Manor.
This time Sherlock actually does look at him. Confused. John can´t exactly blame him.
John can definitely understand why. The display of magic he has witnessed tonight is something he hadn't even hoped to be seeing in his wildest dreams and, if he's being completely honest with himself, he still feels giddy with excitement as a strange buzz runs through his body.
His lashes slowly fluttering open as he groans and rolls his shoulders and neck and the  morning sunlight dips and pools in the hollow at the bottom of his throat.
He can hear them.
It was then that John noticed the crests on the mans coat, cloak and indeed also on the bridle and saddle of the horse. The crest of the Holmes family. This could only mean one thing....
What if this sad, monotonous, lonely life is all John will ever have until the day he dies.
Molly knows this, because she bears them too.
Holmes who seemed to be both amazing, terrifying and inscrutable at the same time.
He doesn't quite know how to answer. How to make John see what he sees and so he remains silent once more.
“And that's also the fifth ace you've played this round.”
“For the first couple of months I just kept on hoping he'd smile at me the way he smiles when he talks about you....but he never did.” Bill laughs again but there's no mirth in it,
Never even a hint of magic to be detected.
For a moment Holmes says nothing. His eyes go wide as he opens and closes his mouth but no sound comes out.
John still doesn't know what he meant by that.
John had laughed then. Actually laughed. The sound had been bright and warm too. John never laughed at him. Always with him.
That lovely Cupid's bow of Sherlock's upper lip was moving against his own. Hungry. Needy. Barriers were lowered and as John felt himself being pulled against sherlock's body even tighter he could feel a hardness akin to his own underneath Sherlock's breeches.
*********************************
Nothing special about him really.
I'm not sure what to do with all that extra time exactly so I just wander around the neighborhood a bit because I'm definitely not going to just stand outside of the theater for 40 minutes.
How can it be best described?
“What if something happens to me”, Mycroft said.
This time
She had reached out to the part of her hidden away in Holmes' mind and had made it cast a spell.
What concerned him more was that there was apparently someone in Sherlock's household who could not be trusted. A mole. A snitch. Someone gathering information about Sherlock that would benefit the enemy and had a way to pass it on.
But he doesn't.
Would that not be a lovely world to live in.
He glances at John.
BUT the ending the story now currently has somehow didn't feel right to me.
he needs to think about John
They should be left to the night and forgotten during the day.
So I'd ran.
The sky above is still far too vast and menacing but for the moment the gentle pressure of John's skin seems to be keeping Sherlock anchored to the ground at least.
He opens his eyes again and the lights are gone. The feeling is gone.
Like darkness that is left when the flame is snuffed out.
“Why are you still here?”, the first thing he says.
Sherlock smiled a wry smile devoid of humor. John hated seeing it on his face. He'd much rather see the smiles that Sherlock had been directing at him these last couple of weeks. The ones that made him feel all warm and fuzzy inside.
He doesn't know which he prefers.
Must she look at him......
“Can't you call one of your rugby buddies?”
Molly does look up then. She would quite like to know
Sherlock attempts to sit up straight but his neck and back are sore from the hours spent in such an unnatural sleeping position and his legs and arms do not seem to want to cooperate fully.
Hidden somewhere in the darkness around you but you still know it's there, you're just not sure when or from where it will inevitably pounce on you.
She means to stop him.
And for the past ten minutes or so that we've spent in here he's been able to open my heart up so expertly and diligently that I can't seem to be able to keep anything inside of it anymore so I say:
But every time we talk about us and what we are to each other he just sort of....breaks down.
John realizes that, for all the magic he's seen Holmes do by now, he's never seen him like this.
In the end they must head upstairs, go to their shared room and their shared bed, or run the risk of falling asleep at the table where they sit.
“Shit...it's my mom.....I should have been home by now.”
And, even though the sun still shines just as bright as it has been doing the entire day,  Sherlock suddenly feels cold.
John is standing by the window, the window is open even though it is February and pretty cold and windy outside still. There is no key in his hand. There is no key to be seen anywhere.
But now the world seems to be made out of far too much space entirely and I still find myself wondering where I even fit into it all.
For now.
“Yes”, the reply.....only, it's too early, Sherlock thinks, that comes later too. But before he can think anything else he finds himself tilting his head forwards as his lips find the spot where his thumb has just been.
John had really hoped he would kiss him again.
She will torment him for a little while instead. Like she has done so many times before.
Death has never given her an answer before, why would it start doing so now.
“It's fine”, he says and John physically relaxes beside him.
Even if he had wanted to speak he finds himself unable to do so as the incense makes his eyes water, his head light and his thoughts woozy.
It's all new to him.
But once he does travel beyond the veil she will be able to acces the part of her she has left inside of his mind fully. She will be able to control him completely then. Make him do exactly what she wants. Make him hurt.....suffer......he will be nothing more than a puppet. A ragdoll for her to play with. To sink her teeth in. To offer to the King. Who will do much, much more unspeakable things to him.
“Why did you ask me to come with you that very first night we met?”, he asks.
Within the sound there are words that drip into his ears like honeyed whispers:
I want to cry.
He really hopes that, for John, this wasn't a one time thing.
There really is no need.
John gave him another tight smile.
It drives me crazy. I wish she would just realize that this.....us......is not something that's going away.
A symbol of things that wither out and die and Sherlock pays it as little attention as he possibly can.
John's blood ran cold.
“You cannot be here!”, John says again, a little bit louder this time. This time a girl in a short skirt and far too much make-up gives him an annoyed look but she quickly goes back to dancing again.
Maybe in time, with gentle persuasion, they might be able to convince Holmes to present Watson and.....whatever he was......to the Order, but not today.
In his head he tries to come up with a non-embarrassing way to mime the phrase: “you are out of toilet paper.”
Just for a little while longer.
He confuses me in a way he never did before.
“I don't think I can be in a secret relationship anymore”, I say, “so maybe we shouldn't be in a relationship at all, but....don't worry, I won't tell anyone about us”,  and then I leave him there.
“What exactly are we doing here?”, he asks.
Sherlock knows what to do.
He is somewhat disappointed about not getting the opportunity to ask Molly about “Person X” but, on the other hand, the thought of getting to spend the entire afternoon alone with John doesn't sound too disagreeable.....not at all.
“It's in the eyes”, he explains.
When he breathes they weave in- and outward along the shape of his chest and lungs.
To Sherlock that's just one step too far.
“Ah, fuck it”, he said to himself, pressed the call button and, with only a slight tremble, pressed the phone to his ear.
“John.....”
“I texted you.....and I called you”, I say, avoiding the subject he doesn't want to talk about but not entirely.
He has told the spider to lay low for now.
Why fate had dealt me this cruel hand I could not say.
For a moment Watson doesn't say anything. Then he puts two and two together and actually throws his head back and laughs.
Mary.
He tries not to think of all the times he has spent here with his brother.
After that they are both silent for what feels like minutes.
****************************************************************
*****************************
I turn up the shower's heat as far as I can bear without literally burning alive.
Holmes gives her another look that, with just a bit of kindling, might be able to start fires.
Maybe she knows me better than I give her credit for or maybe she's just a mind-reader because her face lights up as she smiles and most of her sadness seems to leave her.
John playing rugby is just as amazing as Sherlock remembers it.
He always tended to drink a lot on those evenings.
'Where's this coming from all of a sudden?' Sherlock sounded slightly suspicious.
John wants to tell Holmes that he doesn't always have to be so strong. That he doesn't need to hide behind unfeeling walls of ice. Not around John anyway.
A thousand 'thank you's to you all!
She is braver than I am.
John finds he cannot.
I look around me and the small room is filled with rugby-equipment.
He felt there had been a lot of things left unsaid. Left hanging between them in the air of the small coffee-shop.
He starts stirring underneath the blankets then. Stretching out his long limbs as the early  morning light filters through a gap in the curtains and illuminates his form just so.
'I doubt it'll taste as good coming back up', he said as he pushed his cup to the far end of the table. Even the smell of it seemed to be making his stomach feel all queasy.
He's only known he's bisexual himself for a little bit over a year and he's definitely not “out” yet.
There are certain advantages to being cold.
Two weeks to be exact.
“Well, I'll be damned”,  he said.
I take a deep breath.
“It's been a long day”, she says. Mainly because she just wants to say something. Silence is too much for her right now. A lot of things hide in silences. She finds she really, really wants to drown it out right now. But also because it really has been a long day.
How you look back on the story is solely determined by which parts you remember best.
John swallowed. 'Are you sending me away?'
She has decided to spend the entire carriage ride giving out instructions for their upcoming visit to him and her daughters as well.
I nod.
They see each other from time to time after that over the next couple of years but it's never like the way things used to be between them.
They're just....weird....”eccentric” one might say.
I try and look at them as covertly as I can but I probably fail miserably.
His excitement had been short lived.
Sherlock takes another sip of his coffee. Somehow it doesn't taste quite as good anymore.
“No, sorry man”, the short reply and, to Sherlock's surprise, Bill actually does sound sorry this time. He usually just sounds nonchalant and as if he's only half paying attention to the conversation whenever he crushes Sherlock's hopes.
'What possible use could knowing his name be to you?', all the answer he gave his father.
Sherlock is beyond confused now.
Will Holmes and Watson get to Miss Hooper in time to save her?
Sherlock, in turn, was trying to avoid his eyes at all costs.
It is fragile.
And: comments are appreciated. I love hearing from you!
I wake up sticky with my own sweat and the blankets tangled around my arms and legs.
In the next chapter: we meet Sherlock. And when I say we, I also mean John.
And this time John does look at him. And then Sherlock finally does understand what this is all about.
Had he felt cold just moments before now he feels entirely too hot. His clothes too constricting. Breathing a chore......
John is smiling.
Another voice joins the screaming.
He feels like a caged animal. A wolf trapped in a small cage with a lamb.....only.....he's not really sure if he's the wolf or the lamb in this scenario.
They are about the future.
We get a couple more appreciative nods and then conversations just start up again where they had left off when John and I showed up.
John just shook his head and smiled. 'Anything for you Mrs. Hudson.'
He also finds he would quite like to have another glass.
No.....
Once again he feels more than a little guilty.
John's shift is almost over anyway.
How she loves playing with him.
He remembers fingers carding through hair that reminds him of liquid fire.
Normally he wouldn't want to be caught dead wearing something like this.
Mycroft is a master when it comes to swordsmanship.
Usually he went to the kitchen to eat with the rest of the staff but even the thought of being around other people right now made him feel even more depressed.
He wonders what John is doing now. If he has realized that Sherlock has already left. That all the plans he had been making for tomorrow, things for them to do together, are now completely pointless. He wonders if John is mad at him.
He's been in these rooms before but that was years ago.
“Did you read that in your encyclopedia?” he asks.
The sound now very close to a laugh as her long fingers tighten themselves around the spidery cords that spring from her palms.
pps: Do not worry. My stories always have happy endings. Real life is sad enough as it is.
He sits on a throne that does not yet exist in a room that is still no more than a suggestion.
My skin breaks out in goose-flesh but I'm still so hot.
The first floor of  Holmes manor is quiet.
He's told me as much.
Sherlock seems to understand because he snorts audibly and rolls his eyes.
Underneath his back is a hard and stiff mattress and underneath the fingers of his limp hands he can feel thick sheets.
A physical force holding him back.
Showing him things.
'So John, when do you think your next heat will come on?'
Calloused fingers.
Somehow this seems to be important information to have.
“I'll leave the room”, he says.
I press up against him some more and he leans back until his back hits the duvet.
I already know how he feels.
John swallows again.
His “moves” have, on occasion, been described as “a  tone-deaf, new-born foal trying to escape from a floor covered in tar”.
********************************
The one I awkwardly bumped with my own bag as I hastily made my way to my assigned seat.
Maybe he's healing.
His face remains unreadable but John feels very uncomfortable under his gaze.
“Is this for real? Am I in trouble?”
Holmes face had turned grave and serious and John felt an uneasy feeling rise from the pit of his stomach.
Sherlock has been in love with John for years now.
“Are you ready?”, Sherlock asks.
John decides to nod again.....there's slightly less conviction behind it this time.
”, he says, “she's just upset because you turned her down for a dance.”
They are both silent for a moment. Just long enough for John to think the last couple of weeks over and how he might have....maybe....overreacted just a little bit.
The only woman working at the coffee-place is well in her fifties and as far as regular customers are concerned: people John's age hardly ever hang out there at all. It's mostly businessmen on their way to work. All the “cool” kids seem to hang out at the local “Starbucks”. The coffee-place is usually pretty quiet. Which makes it an ideal location for practicing lines but not so much for meeting and seducing any eligible young ladies.
No sign of the soft curves and relaxed limbs John purposefully chooses not to remember.
*********************************************
What they had and what it had meant and that Sherlock had just been very scared and confused and unable to see in himself what John had seen.
He's never asked anyone to stay the night before.
He silently wishes this was all behind him.
His hands grasping. Urging John on. His Adam's apple bobbing in his throat as he swallows. John kissing his chest, his neck, his lips..... swallowing those eager moans breath by breath.
I don't know what John wants me to do.
The paramedics have now put Sherlock on a stretcher. His naked body is covered with a blanket and he is tightly secured with several straps.
But after all the times Watson had surprised him already had it really been such a shock?
Maybe he's already hurt him.
Cold, harsh and ruthless.
But time is running out.
(See the end of the chapter for
This is officially the worst day of his life.
“Leaving?” John says. He tries to keep his voice as flat and emotionless as possible.
He still doesn't know what it's like to kiss John in the hollow at the bottom of his throat. What that spot just behind his ear tastes like. The lids of his eyes where his golden eyelashes flutter every time he blushes. What his blush tastes like. What it's like to kiss the corners of his mouth as they lift up in a smile....
For every question that got answered at least three more have sprung up.
“Won't you get cold now?” he asked. Slurring the words. Barely able to keep his eyes open.
It had been the day he had first laid eyes on their mother.
'You can't talk to horses, John.'
John decides to stop pretending to be asleep. He is finding it hard to fall asleep tonight anyway.
His muscular arms and legs and sturdy frame....... chiseled like a Greek statue after years of playing rugby almost on a daily basis.
The sign above the door reads: 'Strange Magic Music'. The 'I's' have been replaced by music notes.
He had told Watson too much. He should have never gotten him involved.
“It doesn't matter”, Sherlock says, “the East Wind will come for me anyway.”
A man who introduces himself as “Finn”.
He swallows and quickly gets up.
He just thinks of what it all means.
They were blown wide open. But not by the wind it seemed.
There is something going on but I'm not quite sure what yet.
There is a smug smile on Finn's face. Sherlock does his very best to not immediately punch it right off again.
He decides to break the silence.
“My sister is gay”, he ended up saying. It was meant as some form of clarification, but apparently he was still a bit drunk and the words came out all jumbled up once again.
“I also wanted to apologize to you.”
“Yes....no.....maybe......I don't know”, I supply helplessly. Because I don't know. I really don't know. I could have just lied to him and said 'yes' but somehow when it comes to John I don't want to lie. Not ever.
As if his heart is racing way too fast.
'I'll be extra careful to avoid him then', John replied and bumped her shoulder with his.
He doesn't remember ever playing games with Mycroft....joking with him.....being goofy.
I find I am spellbound.
Sherlock nodded, the movement casting entirely new shadows on his face and the walls around them.
Deep in his heart of hearts Holmes knows.
“I need to get to a funeral”, he says. He really doesn't. But he knows....or rather....hopes...that this will persuade John to give up on this charade, get the key and release Sherlock.
Once again they found themselves sitting side by side on the soft grass. Once again their shoulders, arms and legs almost touching.
Another heavy silence hangs between them for a couple moments more as Mary tilts her head to the side and gives the carriage and horses a scrutinizing look.
"Good, then," she affirms, shooing them away with a flick of her wrist. The entrance slams shut in a rather satisfying manner behind them.
"I do have faith in Rosie, and this isn't some sort of separation anxiety or anything. I'm not a child, but surely you've got to understand that - " The great Sherlock Holmes groaned loudly.
them for anything, would probably drive him up a wall. You'd be sleeping on the couch for a month." Watson ran a hand over his face.
"I care quite a bit about your happiness, brother mine. Otherwise I wouldn't be here today, or in any of the numerous days past." He clicked his umbrella on the ground in a matter one might classify as indignant. "And regardless of what I think of romance, that hardly matters. It does seem impossible for people like us, yes, and I've certainly never found anyone I could consider as a potential mate," he paused, shivering as though the word alone was nightmarish in nature, "but you have, apparently. Haven't you always been about doing the impossible?"
"So, let's all get brunch over with, shall we?" stated Sherlock, absolutely unphased, as he drew back. "I imagine most of you are hungry, as is John, who might be in need of a drink. He looks a little pale." He began to stride off, John quickly following out of instinct, and the other guests got up.
"Yes, John, we happen to be in a committed relationship that is in no way under wraps. Is there a reason this is so boggling to you right now?" he responded, sounding for all the world like a petulant child.
After exactly twenty six months of dating (and good dating, too, even if her date was often called out to work and she ended up accompanying him back to many a grisly crime scene), she had been proposed to. At first, she had scarcely believed it was real, but several a pinch to the arm confirmed the proposal to be reality.
"You wouldn't."
"Quite something, indeed." Rosie clambered into his lap, frowning at the lack of his usual confidence. Still, she remained calm and quiet, waiting for her father to give her an answer. "You're right about it, you know. I think I've made you a little too clever."
He doesn't see much of a point, actually.
"You're not doing all that bad so far. You haven't fallen into a coma of fear yet, so fingers crossed."
"This reminds me of that football movie, for some reason. Sherlock, what was the one about the Indian girl who wanted to play football?"
Whatever he was expecting the doctor to eventually say, that certainly wasn't it.
, other than
For starters, the Holmes family is just not made for love. His parents, being normal enough, managed to be happy together, but Sherlock is utterly convinced that this was a fluke. Him and Mycroft, despite their spheres of influence, would never taste that sort of belonging. They were too distant, too estranged, too eccentric and needy - in other words, too
"I bet you'd understand rugby," she sighs as she prepares another body in the morgue, this one belonging to a slightly heavyset older gentleman. He said nothing in response. "You're probably an expert, huh? Could you, I don't know, give me some pointers? I have a game to catch in another two hours after work and I could use the help."
. A little advanced, sure, but both of her fathers always seemed so proud when she got excited about these novels, when she flipped through them the way she loved to. 'Our little genius', they'd say. So clever.
"Great, I'm being demoted to a glorified headrest."
stupid characters in books. Give me a clever girl who doesn't go into the ominous back room in a horror movie, or a disgruntled teenager that actually listens to their parents when they say 'don't do drugs' or 'don't have sex' or 'don't hang out with them'. When people make idiotic decisions for no reason it's annoying." Reyna shrugged.
It's a little bit adorable, actually.
"I was wondering . . . " Sherlock Holmes set down his newspaper as Rosamund stood next to his chair, gazing at him with intent.
"Well, I've been lucid for all of five minutes, tops, but you are slightly harder to puzzle out. Judging by how easy it was to rouse you, as it only took a few moments, my guess is, at most, a half and hour. If not you would have entered the next phase of sleep, inducing a deeper unconscious state and - "
And then, at the parlor:
"That it does. It's very nice of you - you didn't have to do that, you know."
Serves me right for joining the fandom, I suppose.
And, of course, there is still something to be finished.
"Sit down, it's starting," begs her niece, brandishing the remote much like a sword. "I've got snacks."
"We're learning counting, Dad, and the alphabet. The
The second, slightly more surprising component of Rosamund's identity to any outsider, was her mental capacities. Rosamund was clever to a fault, and her deductions, when she did make them, were almost always spot on. She'd displayed a wonderful eye for details at a young age and, under the care of her guardians, had only expanded upon her capabilities. She was a whiz at chemistry, repeatedly producing perfect grades on all of her exams, and all of her teachers were blown away by her knowledge. Her projects were impeccable, her independent study undertakings even more so. Rosamund was simply brilliant, an absolute genius, with an IQ and a series of breathtaking scores to prove it.
"You're welcome. He tells you the same thing, I'm sure. You shouldn't question it, if you start to over-analyze this - John is a man of his word, and Rosamund thinks the world of both of you. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, but how fortunate for us that we're both geniuses, anyhow." Mycroft got up, sniffing as a new scent had breached his nose. A bloodhound, his brother, when there was food involved. "I daresay the tea is ready."
ever get hurt again. They are his. The mere idea is unacceptable.
"Did you actually make something? For us?"
It's clear, to those who knew where to look, that Sherlock Holmes was letting his guard down for once, allowing the world to know he was smitten as opposed to stashing away his feelings, and John Watson was just as pleased. Of course, it was easy to follow and observe this change in dynamic - many of them had guessed at its romantic inclination over the years, and the fact that it was just now coming to light did little to affect that fundamental. However, their efforts to 'take things slowly' or 'keep it under wraps' seemed to pale, due to this longstanding commitment, but this was their business. Let them handle romanticisms how they will.
"Muffins, John. I'm sending you a gift basket for keeping my brother from destroying the rest of polite society these last many years. You have earned them in full."
Nobody else came to the front.
"Rosie, dear, you said you wanted your da, didn't you?" the brunette repeated, brow knit in confusion.
"Yes, I'm sure John's appreciative," the detective mumbled, shoving his hands into his pockets. The doctor glared at him.
"No, she was nice. She looks like Mrs. Hudson," Rosie said, blowing her hair out of her face.
"We're pretty much out of cups, Mr. Watson, but Rosie saved you two a glass," smirked the girl behind the table, holding up a hand. "You'd better go find a seat." Molly stifled a laugh. Lestrade glanced at her curiously.
"Of course I am, idiot, what would make you think otherwise?" The relief across Watson's face was palpable.
After two hours, she looked out Mrs. Hudson's flat's window, wondering whether or not the boys upstairs were aware that it was growing darker.
"What?"
"I'm picking the lock, obviously."
But, of course, this was all the future, and speculation about that insipid and unnecessary name alteration, no matter how much John and Rosie seemed to like it. Right now, this moment - that's fairly alright, shockingly.
At this point, as they approached Baker Street once again, Reyna leaned over and whispered in her ear.
"It's a different kind of clever. Girls, I've found, are better at it," Rosie stated bluntly before departing, hugging her detectives fiercely. Molly was still ruminating on those words when Lestrade slipped over, grabbing his coat and slipping it on with reluctance. His eyebrows were scrunched, as if he, too, was thinking hard about things and trying to reach a revelation.
"Your vocabulary is worse than Shakespeare's in terms of ornamental, Rosamund." She snorted back, reluctantly laying back onto the bed and continuing with her reading.
"I think you're the one who needs to be worried. Never underestimate the potential for siblings to rag on eachother." Their fingers intertwined, anyhow, and they walked off to their table together.
Sure, there is Aunt Harry and Aunt Clara and Grandma and Grandpa Watson and the rest of the Holmes family tree, but they were not so important, somehow. Rosie loved them, yes, but they were rarely around and she found that she didn't miss them nearly as much after they had left.
And only one week later, something even more elementary than her own intelligence rolls around in the form of a disgruntled Sherlock Holmes, arriving back at 221B after the accident, which he can now recall and recite in depth, perhaps too much so for her other father's liking. He moves around in a slow, even pace, still recovering, and John Watson hovers over him at all times like he's afraid the tall figure is a piece of ceramic about to burst. Rosamund is less worried - the mischievous spark in his eyes is still present, as is the molten steel resolve. Sherlock Holmes is certainly not going anywhere - not her Dad. Not now.
And, strangely enough, both men slept through the entire night.
- detective was so interesting and charming on his own, so surely it wouldn't be so hard.
"Tea would be marvelous, thank you." He gave a lidded smile towards a disgruntled Sherlock Holmes. "As would a conversation with my brother."
Her family was lovely, in her opinion, though she supposed it changed for everyone. Perspective and all. But she, as Rosie, was very lucky indeed.
"Take it as a good thing. You'll be much easier to manage at work, I believe," Lestrade interjected, grabbing his wife's hand. "But don't worry, you're just as brilliant and irritable as ever, I'm sure."
For a brief moment, she wonders if she could have had that, too. With some faceless man, in some indefinite time.
"That too, but about us. I'm the lucky one. You chose me." The officiator took that as que to start speaking again.
" The blonde blinked.
"I don't see anyone complaining."
"I believe you misunderstand, John. I would prefer a conversation with my brother alone." He braced his umbrella on the floor, hands resting firmly atop it, and the younger Holmes realized that this might be the first time in years that he had seen Mycroft without John at his side.
"No, no, I get that part, but why are you leaning on me?"
Though she wasn't an amazing scientist, her dark haired best friend was great at math and the arts, and she could certainly keep up in a chase - she had been on the track team for the last three years. Reyna, who had taken advanced english and conducted many in-depth studies on Shakespeare as a part of her curriculum, would be perfect for this task.
