“So where are you headed, Cas?” Dean asks, breaking their eye contact as he settles back against the wall again.
Charlie smiles, “You’re speaking language, Kev. This place is old, but I think I can MacGyver some tech together. We need specifics.”
Dean paces awhile longer before catching sight of Gabriel standing off to the side. The archangel still looks a little green around the gills, but he had been able to make himself useful when they’d been under attack. Some of his mojo must be back or he wouldn’t have been able to get up off the ground let alone through a fight. After a moment’s deliberation, Dean marches over to Gabriel.
“Must this be so damn messy?” Crowley asks no one in particular as he finishes off yet another demon.
Sam walks into what pains Crowley to call an office. It lacks his customary flair for design, for the moment only consisting of shelves, a desk, and a chair. With zero budget or access to the outside world, he did what he could with it for now, stealing a small potted plant from the library to add a little color. With any luck, he’ll be able to talk Sam into at least letting him put up a few paintings. He considers broaching this very topic as he glances up at the younger Winchester. Sam gives him a smile bordering on apologetic. Crowley returns his eyes to his computer, knowing a lost cause when he sees one.
Everything is pain. It goes on and on, unending. Monotonous, almost boring in its agony. But there’s something else. A sound. It’s loud. Unpleasant. The voice is raw, as if whatever is screaming has been doing so for a very long time. It’s calling out for help. Please someone, help.
Sam is lying, or at least shading the truth. Dean gets the feeling he was out a lot longer than two days. He doesn’t push though. This is the most he’s he's been allowed to question Sam since he woke up in the Bunker.
They glare at each other and Dean knows Castiel is already plotting, certain that once they make it back home, he’ll be able to get Sam on his side and Dean will cave. He’s wrong though. Dean might not know exactly what he’s feeling about Castiel these days, but he knows he’s not going to lose him again, just like he isn't going to lose Sam. He can’t.
Groaning, Dean obeys. He lets his head fall forward, his forehead resting against the back of Cas’ head and eyes falling shut. He struggles to keep up, becoming disjointed in his movements as he gets closer and closer to the brink. Cas is like a man possessed, twisting and writhing, grabbing at Dean wherever he can.
He can hear what sounds like scuffling noises, then the line goes dead. Dean slams the phone shut, jamming it back in his pocket.
Sam laughs at that, Crowley along with him. He would be lying if he said it wasn’t weird to be having an amiable conversation with Crowley, but he has to admit, it's almost enjoyable. It feels like forever since he’d been involved in a conversation bordering on lighthearted. At least what counted as lighthearted for them.
“Beautiful,” Cas murmured as he slowed his movements, gently working Dean through the last waves of his orgasm. As Dean went pliant, Cas pulled out and dipped down to lick and suck the remnants of cum from Dean’s spent cock. Dean moaned loudly and squirmed a bit from overstimulation, so Cas moved on to clean up his stomach before moving further north to kiss Dean’s pouty lips.
Dean couldn’t help but smile to himself as he bounded into the house and picked the phone up from where Sam had abandoned on the kitchen island.
“Cas, stop, ok?” Dean said with authority. “I like to draw. Let’s not make a whole thing out of it. I probably won’t even be here long enough to worry about graduating, let alone trying to get into college nearby.”
“Fuck, Cas… gonna…” Dean choked out before he was coming untouched, spilling between them and covering Cas’ torso in white.
“Dean,” Cas said, turning his attention to the man standing next to him. “I don’t want to do this.” Dean’s head snapped to him in alarm, and Cas spoke again. “Shit, I don’t mean ‘us’” Cas motioned between them. “I don’t want to spend our time together in regret. This is a fresh start for us, and we can’t change the past.”
“Oh fuck,” he breathed out, rolling his hips lazily against Dean as he came down from his climax. He nuzzled Dean’s cheek and Dean turned his face up for a kiss, running his fingers through the sweaty hair plastered to Cas’ forehead to brush it away from his face. “That’s what I’ve been missing?” he said with a laugh before gently pulling out and flopping onto his back next to Dean.
“You can sleep at my house. We can stop and get some of your things. Come on,” Cas tugged at Dean’s hand, only to have it snatched away again.
“Yeah. I’m sure we’ll find some. We have a couple weeks, right?” He flashes a big grin at Cas to reassure the alpha that all is well.
“Dean, I’m gonna…” Cas gasped out as he tried to pull out to finish on Dean’s ass, but Dean’s pushed back again, keeping him right where he was.
Cas laced his fingers with Dean's and pressed the man's arms into the mattress on either side of his head, then ground his hips down, their erections rubbing together deliciously. Twin moans tumbled from their lips, and Cas rolled his hips again, harder this time.
As Cas composes himself, Dean slips his shirt over his head and tosses it aside before dipping down to suck a nipple into his mouth. Dean flicks his tongue over the hard bud and Cas’ hands sink into Dean’s hair to hold him there. Dean isn’t the only one with sensitive nipples. Cas gasps as Dean’s hand slides up his abdomen to pinch the neglected nipple and off in the distance tips keep sounding.
Cas looked over and smirked at him, shrugging again. “You’re going to see me naked eventually anyway.”
A few minutes later, signatures were drying on the forms, money was exchanged, and Dean was leading the man back to his room at the very end of the hall. The door swung open on its hinges and suddenly all Dean could smell was cinnamon, honey, nutmeg and ginger. The scents wrapped around him deliciously and he dropped the client’s hand as he scented the air, nostrils flaring wide to drag in as much of the scent as possible. In an instant, he was transported back in time and reminded of the only alpha he knew that smelled of cinnamon and honey. The only alpha he'd ever known that had such a sweet scent.
Cas stands and hooks one of Dean’s knees over the bend of his elbow before pushing the head of his cock to Dean’s dripping rim. Once the tip pops inside, Cas hooks the other leg over his free arm and slowly pushes inside of Dean. He rests his forehead on Dean’s as he bottoms out and Dean leans in to capture his lips in a sweet kiss.
It’s probably the coward’s way out. There had been times that Dean looked at him with so much affection, Cas could almost believe there’s a chance Dean feels the same way he does. Then Dean would go out to a bar without him and come back home just as the sun was coming up, stinking of whoever he’d hooked up with. Or at least that was commonplace before the fucking plague spread across the country.
“F-fuck, Cas!” Dean said between gritted teeth as Cas took him down to the root and swallowed around him while pulling the plug halfway out of his ass.
Dean wasn’t able to talk about it with his brother, even if he had wanted to, because right then, Donatello came through the door, and a search for Jack began. They disposed of demons and were confronted by the Prince of Hell, Asmodeus, and for a brief moment in time, Dean had a mission. He was on the job and his brain was blissfully silent.
Cas allowed himself to be pulled to his feet by the tug of Dean’s hand, then pulled Dean close and began to sway, dipping his head down to scent the overwhelmingly sweet fragrance that was Dean’s happiness wafting into the air around them. Dean pressed a kiss to the shell of Castiel’s ear and began to sing along softly, the lyrics and the rough caress of his voice drawing goosebumps to the surface of Cas’ skin.
Castiel stared at the large building in awe. Gabriel had expanded over the years, moving into a building that was easily three times the size of the original brothel Castiel had worked in so many years before. In spite of Gabriel’s brash personality, the brothel was classy and discreet on the outside, only the
His bed is stripped of everything but the fitted sheet, and his hamper is open, a few pieces of clothing from inside scattered on the floor. He checks it, empty.
Flames continued to lick the sky, embers floating on the air, dropping onto Dean’s exposed hands, face and neck. He didn’t even feel it. Probably wouldn’t even notice the small, angry red marks they left behind. He could smell the burning flesh on the pyre and taste acrid smoke in the back of his throat. It wasn’t healthy to stay there, breathing it all in, the light of the flames against the darkness burning themselves into his retinas. He closed his eyes and could see the shadow glow behind his lids.
“Nah. I bought this when I was… researching,” Dean answers, taking a small, black box out of the larger shipping box. “It’s a vibrating plug that I can hook up to the site through an app. Like your knot vibrator. Thought it could help me make bank, but now I guess I have you for that.” He shrugs and sets the sex toy aside.
“No, you gotta wake up,” Dean says, managing to knock one of his other self’s legs out from under him.
They take turns moving their pieces, sitting in companionable silence as the conversation finds a natural lull.
“Sam’s been working on it. ‘Course he’s hellbent on finding something that doesn’t mean killing her, or her kid.”
“Cas, trust me, I’ve spent enough time with my own ass to know what I’m doing,” Dean said, rubbing Cas’ arms to calm him.
While I'm feeling inspired, I'm just going to keep powering through. I was hoping to have a final chapter count by now, but I'm having a hard time judging it, still. In the meantime, here's another incredibly unchaste chapter. Things are *heating* up! There's a couple new tags this time too. Enjoy ;)
"Oh sweetheart, that's just sad. Thousands of years old and no one has ever given you a gift. We're going to change that. I'm going to give you everything you could possibly want, baby.”
Castiel laughs softly and closes his eyes briefly. “I don’t think things are ever going to be the same.”
Even after what was then five years since he’d last seen him, he still wondered if he was alright. He checked every social media platform every now and then to see if Dean had left Michael. So far, he hadn’t seen anything. Dean didn’t seem like someone who would post on social media a lot even if he was allowed, but it didn’t hurt to check.
One night, they had come to the club to observe again. Dean always loved to wear a full set of lingerie. It made him feel good when several pairs of eyes were on him. That night, he was in all white. His white panties matched his white garters and stockings. He felt good in them, and could even say he felt pretty.
“Then let me show you.” Castiel gently took the hem of Dean’s shirt and lifted it over his head. He smiled when he saw Dean, running his hands down his sides. “You’re perfect to me.”
“Thanks.” Dean continued up the stairs to his room. He saw that Sam had made the bed and cleaned everything, which gave Dean a light chuckle. He didn’t bother to pull the blankets back. He crawled into bed and closed his eyes, eager to get some rest. Sleep came easily and took over Dean’s body, sending him into a deep state of relaxation.
Castiel gave a small nod. “You’re welcome.” He took the suit out of the bag. “Michael will ask, do your suppressants block your heats? If not, when is your next one? I’m sure you saw on his profile that the family is very anti-sex-before-marriage. He wanted to know when to expect your heat so he could know when to steer clear and avoid any unnecessary situations.”
Castiel pauses, thinking about it. “I dunno. A lot.” Hands hold his shoulders and guide him to sit down on the couch.
Dean starts to feel a little awkward as he stands there stationary. He starts to listen to the music and finds himself enjoying it. Slowly, parts of his body start to move to it. His head bobs, then his shoulders move back and forth.
“Oh, shut up. Fuck being platonic. Look at us.” Dean felt a weight lift from his shoulders as he spoke. “I like you, I’m pretty sure you like me. We have this time together, why don’t we take it?”
He got out of the shower and wrapped himself in a towel to go grab some clean pajamas for Castiel. He ended up grabbing some of his own. He got a big t-shirt, the comfiest pajama pants he owned, and some clean boxers. He brought them back to the bathroom and saw Castiel drying himself off.
The wedding was two weeks away. Dean had his entire outfit ready, had tasted countless meals to decide what would be served, and toured the venues for the service and reception twice. Everything was in order, and Dean was anxious. He knew that the marriage was the whole point of coming here, but it didn’t feel very real until now.
Castiel frowned a bit. “He’s not lying. The memories stop almost exactly a week ago...Someone erased his memories. I can feel it, there’s a gaping hole where they used to be.”
“You need to go see health services tomorrow. Make an appointment now. That can’t be a normal amount of pain for tinnitus.” Dean lets go of Castiel’s shoulder and kisses his wrist before putting it down.
Castiel smiled a bit. “Thanks.” He started reaching back over his shoulder to reach the center of his wings. He strained and did the best he could. “Damn it, I should have brought my brush or something.”
Castiel huffed. “That’s your perspective. Heaven treasured humans. They had their flaws, and that’s what we loved about them.”
“Don’t give me that manipulative bullshit. You married me and you treat me like some lifeless sex doll to bend to your every will, and when I fall slightly out of line, you make me feel like shit.” Castiel was damn-near a tipping point with Luke. If he had somewhere to go, he would be out of there so fast. Also, there was Dean. He’d feel horribly guilty if he left him behind now. He needed to at least support his friend.
Cas looks at Dean and nods. “I do. Sometimes, people are like puzzles to me. I like to solve them before they get the chance to tell me.”
Dean flies up to a sitting position that throws him off the couch. He turns around, grabbing the couch for purchase and his head swings around. His face is twisted in anger, his chest heaving up and down with his heavy breathing.
A static shock burst behind Cas as he touched a finger to Dean’s pinkened hole.  He applied just enough pressure to make Dean squirm, his cock aching and heavy between them.  When he was ready to start begging, Cas somehow knew and slipped one thick finger inside him, slicked with angel grace.
Castiel takes his first sip of his second beer and looks at his hands wrapped around the bottle. “Why are you being so nice to me?  You don’t even know me.  I could be anyone.  I could rob you in your sleep or something.”
.” Castiel hung his head and wrapped his arms around his waist.  “I had no intention of offending you.  I’m truly sorry.  I wasn’t… propositioning you or anything, just—”
“What was that, dude?” Dean laughed, his own embarrassment nothing in the face of Charlie's awkwardness.
Kneeling on the ground before them, facing the altar, is a woman in a rust-colored gown and black headdress. From the back, it’s clear the clothing is even more modest and simple than the nun who brought them in.
“No, no, you go ahead and make out with all the friends you want,” Dean smirked, waiving for the two girls to continue.  He probably should care that his girlfriend was making out with someone else.  Had done so when he wasn’t around and hadn’t told him.  He probably should, but he just didn’t.  Lisa… she was fun and this was hot, but that was really the extent of his feelings on the whole thing.
“So what’s the verdict?” Dean asked when Sam paused in his cleaning.  Sister Veronica appeared next to the bed, a silent guardian at his side.
He opened his suitcase and dressed quickly in the little casual clothing he had, a pair of jeans and a longsleeved Christian Rock band t-shirt tucked in.  He slipped on a pair of sandals and looked around his room one last time.  His room. This could be good.
“So, you know he trusts me and he’d never let anything happen to you.  I know how much he cares about you.  So let’s just go sit outside for a little while, we can share a smoke and you can tell me what’s going on if you want, or we can just sit and wait for Cas.”
The angel was always telling him it was just a vessel, that humans couldn’t perceive his true form. Hell, Pamela lost her eyes for just a glimpse. Dean knew all this. He knew it. But when he looked over the scruffy beard and handsome profile of the man lying on the bed before him,
“Cas, what! Oh!” Dean moaned, sitting up almost all the way and watching with rapt attention as Cas soothed him with kisses and licks.
,” Dean groaned, taking hold of his legs, so Cas’s hands were free to grip and squeeze his thighs and ass before pulling his cheeks apart and exposing his fluttering opening to the room.
Cas raised his hands over his head, impassive as Dean pulled the shirt up and tossed it to the floor.  When he lowered his arms, Dean ran his fingers across his chest, over his shoulders, and down his arms.  At his waist, Dean slipped his fingers into the waistband of the sleep pants Cas wore.
“Yeah, uh, we went out and it was nice and then we didn’t talk again right away.  I saw him last night though.”  Dean felt his face flush with heat as he remembered the morning pressed against Castiel’s chest, feeling so safe and taken care of.
So to reward everyone for their attempt to figure out the big story twist (which is coming, but does not include Luke - sorry) here's a 2ce as long chapter full of smut and sweetness.  I hope you enjoy it!
Once Sam was dressed, they sat over an inhuman amount of Chinese food.  Dean, Sam, Cas, and now and then Rowena recounted the last few weeks.  The longer Sam was conscious, the more he remembered, pieces of his own behavior bringing barrages of unnecessary apologies.  But there was enough guilt to go around. Not a single one of them was free of any fault.  Except maybe Rowena, as she thoroughly enjoyed reminding them.
“He was a son of a bitch.  I shouldn’t fucking care that he’s dead.  I haven’t even seen him in… well longer than I haven’t seen you.”  He exhaled with a wet breath, and Dean dropped his cheek to his brother’s long, greasy hair.
“No, I’m serious.” Sam insisted, turning so one leg came up on the couch, and he could face his brother.  “If you feel like it’s okay for me to not beat myself up for what I did and try to be, I don’t know, a better person, then why can’t the same thing apply to you?  I know whatever you did, even the stuff you won’t tell me about, was either because of Dad being Dad or because you were in so much pain, you didn’t know what else to do.  And now we know Cas did everything he could to get back to you.  And it looks like you’ve forgiven him all that hurt he caused.  So maybe, for once, you could just treat yourself the way you treat the rest of us.”
Dean thrust up with a cry, momentarily releasing Cas’ fingers.  He gripped Dean’s jaw hard and gave him a slight shake before releasing his hold. Cas growled and strong hands grabbed Dean’s hip bones, pushing him into the couch, his thumbs hard and firm, likely leaving behind a bruise.
“Oh, I bought the property once I found out how much scholarship money Sammy was gonna get. He got most of the tuition on scholarship but there was still a bit to cover, books and housing and stuff. So five years ago and then it took about 18 months to build. Although I’m not done with everything yet, still got some plans I’m bouncing around.  ”
“Umm, I’ve had sex with a few guys, mostly one-night stands.  A few friends when I still thought it was under the no-homo guise.  Both of them are still friends but aren’t people I’m interested in.  I’m, ah, usually a top.”
“I guess I’m lucky then. Most of the other students in my program are a good ten years younger than me.”
Dean turned bright red and turned away. “Why are you being nice to me?  Aren’t you supposed to think I’m a degenerate sinner?”
Dean lifted his hips—begging, whining. His free hand gripped the quilt beneath him as his wild eyes stared down at Cas’ pink, kiss heated lips.  “
Cas nuzzled his way south, pressing occasional kisses to Dean’s body as he went.  At Dean’s stomach, his shirt had ridden up, exposing a swath of skin.  Cas licked along the top of Dean’s jeans, leaving behind a wet trail that cooled behind him until he reached a hipbone, surrounded by solid, strong muscle.
When Cas leaned forward again, Dean was practically panting from how much he loved the feeling of being restrained, of warm, strong hands holding him in place.
“Lisa, just fucking do it, alright?  She’s having a panic attack.”  Dean didn’t take his eyes off Meg.  “How can I help?”
Dean stopped him with a brush of his lips.  “Me either.”  He squeezed Cas’ erection and then pushed his own up against the smooth skin, taking them both into his hand for lazy, sensual strokes.
“Vafiel and Lezoul rushed ahead of the man, determined to prove his claim that ten good men could be found.  When they arrived, the streets were littered with trash and prostitutes, and the few men they found were inebriated or smelled of pork meat.  The cities themselves wreaked of the scents of sin. To find even one man who respected the laws of God would be a miracle.  But we watched from a distance, allowing them to make their own fates.
“Ye...Yes.  That would be acceptable.”  Castiel leaned forward slightly, wanting to taste, even if just for a second, the way the sweat had dried on Dean’s upper lip.
“Oh my god!” Castiel said, jumping off his machine and rushing over.  “Are you okay?”  He knelt next to the man and was met with moss green eyes speckled with gold pinched in pain.
Dean nodded, horrified that it had been that bad and at the same time proud that his angel had been the one to save the day.
The first meeting included Michael, Duma, Claire, and her family, Ellen--who turned out to be Jo’s mother, Missouri, Arthur, Zach, and a number of other faces Castiel was still working to remember.  They talked about history, about the bible as a living document that changed with the passage of time, about the art of translation vs. transliteration, and the entomology of language.  Castiel was in his version of heaven.
Cas ran his hand up Dean’s chest, wrapping his long, strong fingers around the hunter’s neck. “I could heal these bruises for you,” Cas wound his other arm under Dean’s waist, palming his cock.  Dean jerked against the touch with a mewling whine. “But I won’t unless you ask me to.  I like seeing my mark on you, even if it’s a temporary one.”  His hand moved along Dean’s color bone until he was gripping the handprint mark.
“Nothing.  It was nothing.  Sometimes who a person is, is so ingrained in their being it doesn’t require any action at all to be true.  I simply was, and the person I was, the person I am, is an abomination.”
He took a long drag and dropped his forehead to his knees.  He was such a fuckup, just like his Dad always said.  That was why they were stuck here in Uncle Bobby’s house with more antique books and crucifixes than food.  That was why Sam always looked a little afraid and sad.  That was why he always felt so fucking alone even though he had friends.
Sam chuckled.  “It’s Sam, Dean.  I’m not a kid anymore.”  Sam patted his brother’s arm lightly.  His touch was tentative and weak, and there was so much they had to talk about, but—
“What do you mean you’ve found nothing?” Dean yelled, pushing himself to stand with barely a wince.  His eye was black and the blood vessels all burst, giving him a demonic look, and his hair was unwashed and sticking out every which way, except for the missing patch that still stung.
“Look,” Crowley’s words practically oozed out of him.  “You have something that belongs to me and I want it back.  I’m not above making a deal or getting in bed with the enemy, especially when the enemy looks like you.  But at the end of the day, I want my girl back.”
Dean stumbled but maintained his balance. “Fuck, you can’t just say stuff like that.  It’s rude as shit.”
She smiled, a gentle and sincere smile for the first time since he’d met her, and Sam was struck by how
“Cas!  Cas, man, this asshole isn’t worth it.  You gotta calm down.”  Dean stepped in front of Cas and kept talking him down.  When he didn't get through, he placed his hands on either side of Castiel’s face and tried to will him into seeing Dean. Cas’s eyes finally drifted down to his, the light softening. “We need to get Meg out of here.  She needs you.  Come on, Cas, this isn’t the time, okay? You need to calm down.”
He woke in the morning to the soft sound of birds cheeping. But there weren’t usually any birds around his apartment. Then he found his phone, lying on the coffee table, singing to him. Meg must have changed his ring tone again.
“Grades aren’t the only kind of smart.” Cas frowned at him and shook his head.  “Besides, I suspect that whatever reason you have access to these wards and books means that Bobby is not just a guy with books, and your Dad wasn’t just ‘into weird.’  So there’s someone who cares about you, keeping you safe.  Even if they’re keeping you safe from me.” Cas looked down and his feet shuffled in an awkward way that looked unnatural on him.
“Uggh, just don’t get shit-faced again, Dean.  I don’t want to have to drive that stupid ass car of yours home.” Lisa whined
Dean’s head spun.  He laid there, taking Cas’s brutal fucking, his head spinning and a sharp pain rattling in his mind.  Was it in his mind?  Or was the sound coming from somewhere else.
Goddamnit if that didn’t give Dean a shiver.  His spine straightened and his chest got a little tight at the sound of such a vulgar word coming out of that mouth using that deep graveling voice.  Well, shit, now he has to fidget to keep his half stiffy from showing.  Not cool.
“No… it’s not that. You seem real good at your job.” Dean looked away and his flush spread down his neck and across his chest.
For a moment, Dean’s heart falls. He can’t be with someone who would diss The Hatchet.  Those movies are classics.  As his mind started to spin in disappointment, Cas interrupted.
Dean was objectively beautiful. Full lips and hard lines, strong and warm at the same time. It was like his whole existence invited Castiel to reach out and touch. Then Dean dropped his hand and smiled, his face brightening up with laugh lines and dimples and fond affection.
“What’d you write so far?” Dean asked, unable to get himself to turn away.  He walked to the edge and balanced himself along the drop-off, arms out.  It gave him something to do, at least.
Sweat beaded on Dean’s forehead and chest, his breath erratic as Cas crawled over him.  He opened his legs so Cas could settle between them, pressing their bodies together.
“Krushnic, I was there this afternoon. She had her hands down your pants and was all over you.  And I’m like 85% sure I’ve seen you two making out in the hall before.” Dean’s suddenly super invested in Castiel’s sexual experience and personal life.  How the fuck is a guy who looks like that, who is for all intents and purposes the definition of tall, dark, and handsome, not getting any?  Fuck, even GARTH was getting some, and that dude looked like a muppet.
“Well, that’s good.  I mean, it doesn’t mean I haven’t had to deal with my share of ignorant assholes, but at least my family wasn’t among them.” Cas said.
He picked up his pace, eager to put his things away in his new home and stretch out on his bed, when a large, no giant, no massive dog came running toward him, barking as if he’d seen the juiciest steak bone that ever existed.
The first time Veronica saw an angel, she was 15. A boy she liked wanted to go to a party, but she had a bad feeling about it and after a decade of watching demons burn through people she knew or push them over the edge into true evil, she had learned to listen to her instincts. The night was fueled by alcohol and there was a car accident. And that boy? He died.
Thank you all so much for the comments, they mean so much to me.  This story has sprung from my head, demanding to be told, and I'm beyond grateful that you are enjoying it as well.
Castiel sat in the mud and ran a hand through his hair before realizing what he was doing.  Now he had mud in his hair and dog spit in his face and his ass was soaking wet and freezing.  At his frown, Dean burst out laughing, an honest to god belly laugh that threw his whole body back.
“Dean?” she paled and her posture slumped. “Are you mad about Ruby?  I thought it would turn you on, be a little fun.  I didn’t mean to hurt you. We don’t have to…”
Veronica? You’re possessing a freaking Nun?” Dean looked up, taking in the flat chest before him. It should be moving, breathing, lifting as his lungs and heart worked. It was so easy to forget what Cas was.
Cas stared wide-eyed for a moment until Dean reached behind him and pulled his shirt off over his head in one smooth movement.  Dean’s anti-possession tattoo, his wing sleeve, the Enochian sigil on his forearm, and now the simple, elegant script tattooed just under his clavicle where no one could see it unless he was shirtless were on display.  A new addition to his collection he’d gotten before all this chaos began.
“Castiel told me there is a warded vault here.  Warded against angels and demons, even more than the bunker itself.  Is that true?”
“Even if they kill me.”  Cas looks at Dean with watery eyes full of so much regret.  “I love you.  I always have.  I think I loved you even as the mountains were growing, even as the ice was melting.  I have loved you since before I knew what love was, and I always will.”
“Dean, it was an onslaught.  There had to have been 50 of them and more coming.  In that tiny chapel, it was like they were everywhere.  Cas honestly did the bulk of the fighting.  Smiting one after the next.  We’re lucky he’s back up to full power, or there’s no way we would have made it out of there.”
He's not a soft and cuddly angel. He led a garrison and slaughtered legions.  His ability to change, his stain of humanity made him different, but the Branch of Truth is attempting to restore him to factory settings and leave him there forever, driving him insane.
“Yes, so you can rest assured I have no interest in your body one way or the other. My only desire is to make sure you don’t get an infection.”
“Veronica?” they asked.  In a crouch they were about the same height as her kneeling.  Without the fire, they were close enough to touch, to offer comfort, but the heat of the flame reminded her of exactly what they have become.
Dean turned off the engine and turned to look at Cas.  “You coming in?” he asked, throwing his arm over the back of the seats.
“I don’t even know, man,” Dean said with a shrug, cutting off any conversation Sam might think they needed to have before heading inside.
When they grabbed their food and glasses of water, Castiel walked past the small kitchen table and into the living room.  Off to one side was a second bedroom Castiel used as an office, and to the other, the master bedroom.  There was a full bathroom by the entrance and another in Cas’ room.  A glass door led to a small patio and grassy area which Cas opened after setting down his food to let Claire out for a moment.  When she came back in she settled in the plush dog bed sitting in the corner and fell asleep.
As Sam laughed, the sound shifted, becoming hysterical with grief and guilt.  His shoulders shook and curled forward, protecting himself from the pain that came from within him as much as he could.  Tears began to stream down his face, and Dean pulled him back to his chest, holding him tight.  “I know, Sammy.  I know.”
That brought a full smile to his face.  A crinkling the corners of his eyes, white teeth flashing, dimples showing, smile.  And fuck if Dean’s breath didn’t catch at the sight.  Cas was… he was stunning.  How had he not noticed before?  How had he been in school with him for the entire damn year and never realized how handsome the dark-haired enigma standing next to him was.
Dean sat slumped in his chair, leaning against the wall and gazing out the window.  Their teacher droned on about
“I love you,” Castiel sighed, pulling her into a hug.  She dropped her head against his chest and the whole mood of the room changed.  Suddenly Dean felt like he was in the wrong.  Before, it was hot and he thought he might get a show to file away for later, but now, there was an intimacy between them.
“And then Charlie laughed!” Dean sat up and gave Castiel big offended eyes. “You gotta help me Cas, this kind of insult can’t go unanswered.”
“Is that what I’m being, Jimmy?” Dean sauntered up to Cas and got right in his face, his mouth curved up in a wicked smile.
“You came,” said the deep husky voice from the phone, the one that made the hairs stand up on Dean’s arms and the back of his neck replied.
“Damnit, Cas,” he dropped his head into his hands, elbows on his knees. “What the hell have you gotten yourself into? What kind of Angel business means you have to drop your vessel like this. It was weird when you first mentioned it and I knew there was something else going on. But you didn’t want to tell us, so I just let it go. I should have asked, but you’re so damn stubborn. Why didn’t you tell us the whole story?”
Dean shook his head and sprinted to the Impala.  What the fuck was wrong with him today.  That was the third time Castiel Krushnic had overtaken his rational brain.  He barely even knew the guy.
“You know, my Dad was not very happy about me being like I am.” Dean started, not really knowing where he was going, but hoping that maybe opening the door would convince Cas to at least consider sticking his head out. “The first time he saw me kissing a guy, whew, I got the shit kicked out of me.  I was black and blue for weeks, broke my nose, and fucked up my knuckles when I tried to fight back. My dad was tough, ex-marine, hard like a rock. The second time, I got kicked out of the house.  He took Sam and drove off to another town, leaving me behind. I had no idea how to find him.  He didn’t come back for me for two months that time.”
Whatever it was that Cas saw in him, he had Dean pinned like a butterfly on a gothic children’s science board.  Everything about the man made him vibrate with need.  The way he talked, so brutally and unapologetically honest, but still never cruel.  Except for when he was and even that was kind of hot.  The surprise on his face when Dean had chased after him, desperate for the older man to know that yes, he would be on board with them fucking.  Very on board.
And like that, Dean’s mind is back to Castiel and how he never wears colors.  Even his jeans are black or so dark they might as well be.  Matched his hair.  And the contrast with his lightly tanned skin made his eyes pop that color blue Dean couldn’t think of the right word for.  Cerulean?  Azure?  He didn’t know, but
The angel said nothing as he gently pulled his fingers out and realigned their hips so the tip of his cock was lined up with Dean’s desperate opening.
Sister Veronica used the last of the bread to scrape out the last of the honey.  She handed it to Castiel, her arm blazing red and beginning to bleed, but she didn’t even wince.
“You’re right, I’m sorry. I… that was totally unprofessional, if you want to report me I’d completely understand. Let me go get another nurse.” He stood and stumbled toward the curtain but Dean’s hand landed firmly on his shoulder before he could leave.
“Dean, really though, you know there’s a whole gay scene in this city that it doesn’t seem like you’re too into, and he’s involved in a lot of it.  If you don’t want
Dean set his plate down on the coffee table and turned to Castiel with a serious look on his face.  He scrunched up his lips and did a mock bodybuilder pose before speaking in an exaggeratedly low voice.  “Time to Slice and Dice.”
He pushed her over to the couch and sat her down, keeping his hands on her the whole time, trying to keep her tethered to the moment. He crouched in front of her, maintaining eye contact and breathing with her.
He felt stupid and childish, brooding over what amounted to a responsibility-free blowjob.  Wasn’t that supposed to be every guy’s dream?  So why did it leave him feeling dirty?
“Dean,” Castiel began to scold and then the man’s eyes lowered with so much passion and lust blasting them out to black, Castiel actually pulled back.
He spotted Castiel and Meg sitting under one of the trees lining the school’s front sidewalk on his way out.  He held her hand in his lap and gazed at it with such intensity you could almost believe he was performing some kind of x-ray vision dissection.  His hands were strong and his bent shoulders were broad.  Why had Dean always thought of him as a skinny little dude?  He was actually pretty stacked.
It reminds Dean of all the early mornings he’d had to rouse a much younger Sam out of bed earlier than he should have been for some hunt Dad needed to get to or because of some emergency. His little brother had never been the easiest kid to get up, but having to drag him out to the Impala at one or two in the morning was always a fight. To make up for it, Dean used to wrap Sam up in a blanket and let the kid cuddle around him in the backseat as they drove through the night off to some new town, Dad silent in the front seat, hands gripping the wheel.
They eye each other, neither backing down. When Dean can’t take it anymore he sighs and lays back down, staring up at the ceiling.
Dean ignores him, “It’s like I try to kiss him, but every time I do, he dodges out of the way or distracts me -”
It’s movement from Castiel’s bed that brings Sam out of his reverie. He stands watching as Castiel thrashes around. He moves to hold the angel down before he hurts himself, but Cain reaches out an arm to stop him.
The way he says it is so matter-of-fact, Castiel could be sitting in on a board meeting in some corporation, making a random comment about stock prices or something. Dean tries not to laugh as Castiel stares at him.
In a last ditch effort, Dean makes his way up Cas’ chest and along his neck, setting a course for the man’s lips with the intent of persuading Cas to turn towards him. Dean gets what he wants.
“Don’t know about you guys,” Ted says, looking at Tracy and Simon, “but I wasn’t doing anything special until we were taken.”
He looks like he’s about to flap the hell away. Dean starts to get up, though what he hopes to do as far as getting Castiel to stay is beyond him. It’s not like he’d be much of a match for even a semi-fallen angel.
Thanks in large part to Dean's rage driving, they make it Salem in record time, rolling into town before sunset. They check in at the Blue Jay motel, stopping at their room long enough to throw their bags inside. They hit the local diner a few streets down, for which Castiel’s stomach is grateful. While there are a multitude of exhausting and monotonous rituals involved with being human that Castiel wishes he was still exempt from, eating isn't one of them. They seat themselves at one of the few empty tables, colorful ads for various local businesses sealed under the clear counter top.
“You have to stop this, Dean. I can’t protect you if you’re going to make yourself an easy target,” Castiel says, lips pressing against Dean’s temple before he continues, “I will not let it take you, but I need your help. All we have to do is get you out long enough to give Cain the Mark back.”
At first, Dean thinks the spirit is conjuring whatever it is, but then the world in front of Jack begins to fracture. A crack taller than Sam runs in a jagged, vertical line, obstructing the view of the field and sky in front of them. Light starts to filter through the break, peaking out in more places as the crack spreads like shattering glass. It goes until the light can’t be held back, the break happening all at once as the field is engulfed in blinding white light. Dean throws an arm over his eyes, unable to look straight at it until they adjust. Once they do, he can’t believe what he’s seeing.
“So…” Castiel says, trailing off as if he’s deep in thought, nodding in some kind of agreement. He nods and nods and keeps on nodding. Dean wonders if whacking the angel on the head to get him unstuck when Castiel finally says, “A streaker is naked.”
“I’m Sandy Iverson and I’m 25,” the tall blonde woman says, flipping her ponytail back off of her shoulder, “I’m an accountant.”
“You have met yourselves right? Everything goes wrong when you two are involved. You’re like the walking, talking, human versions of Murphy’s Law,” Gabriel says.
The directions on the back of the bottle recommends two pills for adults and children over twelve years of age. He is absurdly proud of the fact that he remembered look. There was a time when he would have had to down the entire bottle to get the desired affect. That had been when he still had his grace, faded though it had been. He had still been an angel. Diminished, but angelic none the less. This time, he couldn’t be farther from Heaven if he tried. He can feel the lack of grace like a physical ache deep in his chest. Castiel considers everything that absence will mean from here on out. As he remembers from last time, there is so much more to think about as a human. He will have to do more than just read instructions. He will have to remember to eat. To bathe. To not let things shoot, stab, or otherwise maim him if at all possible.
Castiel closes his eyes when their lips are inches apart, anticipating the feel of Dean’s lips brushing against his for the first time. What he gets instead is something small and hard pelleting his face. Actually, it feels like a thousand little somethings and not only are they hitting his face, but his entire head.
Sam looks outraged. He opens his mouth to say something else, but Dean stops him, grabbing at Sam's arm to get him to keep his mouth shut or hold his little brother back, whichever becomes necessary.
“There weren’t as many blades as we would have liked. We took what we could and used some of the angelic armor to make our own weapons. They seem to work just as well.”
Metatron is only a couple feet away. Dean rushes him, thrusting up with the blade as he goes, aiming for Metatron’s stomach. The guy might not be an archangel, but he’s no slouch. The angel dodges out of the way, producing his own blade as he makes his way down the last few steps. Dean turns, now a few heads higher than Metatron.
A man stands in the middle of what had been an empty stage, staring out over the gathered masses. He is a short, dumpy looking man, with scraggly brown hair and a graying goatee. He’s not familiar to Bobby and a shared look between Ash and Rufus confirms that they don’t recognize him either. The man smiles, hands disappearing into the pockets of his cardigan sweater.
Sam grimaces, running a hand through his hair, “I know. It’s just - You’re really sticking you neck out for us, Crowley.”
“God, Sam is such a girl! He’s probably been planning his wedding since he was a kid. I wouldn’t be surprised if he has scrapbooks lying around somewhere at Bobby’s,” wrapping an arm around Castiel, Dean grins, “Sorry, you have to put up with that, man.”
“Yes,” Castiel and Sam say at the same time, Sam jabbing Dean with his elbow when he starts to protest.
If there’s anyone left to join them. They had taken a gamble assuming that Abaddon wouldn’t sniff out Crowley’s double cross and would send in most of her forces to meet that group. Between the bombs and their three new friends’ powers, they’d hoped it would give them enough of an advantage to take out the larger group of demons. Looking out at the mess of demons standing between them and the library, they may have underestimated how many guards Abaddon would keep for herself.
“I will kill them before this is all over. Slowly, painfully,” Abaddon says, dragging him towards her until she can whisper in his ear, “And if I find out you were helping them, you’ll wish for death long before I give it to you.”
Dean and Castiel wheel around, almost bumping into the chest of a very broad man. Dean looks up at the guy, who might even give Sam a run for his money in the height department. The man reminds him of Santa Claus except for the bright red beard and hair.
There's a visual aid at the end of this one, so don't be surprised when a random picture pops up at the end. Thanks to everyone who has bookmarked, subscribed, kudo'd, or simply taken the time to read! You all rock! All of the above are always greatly appreciated!
Dean and Sam had tried to kill Castiel when he took the souls from Purgatory and, maybe worst than that, Dean had completely given up on him by that point. Sam was the only one who’d held out hope on that front. Once the angel had popped back up, they’d dropped him off at the mental ward with Meg after Castiel had taken one for the team by shouldering Sam’s special brand of crazy. Yeah sure, they’d had their reasons at the time, and some of them were better than others, but it all still amounts to the same thing: Dean leaving Castiel behind in the dust. The same can’t be said for the fallen angel standing in front of him.
Dean stares at him. Castiel seems to steel himself, finally holding Dean’s gaze like he used to. Almost like a challenge. When Dean starts laughing, Castiel is visibly irritated.
“Don’t get nitpicky about the details, Cas,” Dean says, handing it over to him, “So, what do you say?”
Jack runs off towards the towering rock wall at their back, the brown stone streaked through with streaks of gold and a light blue, making it shimmer in the sunlight. Dean turns, taking on the first one of whatever these things are that gets close to him. They’re strong. Whatever it is must be part demon, the eyes flashing between normal brown human eyes and the pitch black he’s all to used to seeing when someone's possessed.
“And it's going to be a long night,” Crowley says, slashing out at two demons trying to attack in his blind spot.
“Please,” Crowley says, raising an eyebrow at Sam as he smirks, “If I had a superpower it would be my ability to cover my own ass.”
“But first, we’ve got to see a guy about opening our next door,” Jack says, beaming as she ducks down one of alleyways leading into the city proper.
There are sigils scrawled on the door and walls of the small room. Some of them look familiar, but many of them he has never seen before. Bobby lowers his mop, but keeps a firm hold on it, eying the stranger.
“Me either,” Dean says, with a snort as he props himself up on his elbows, “but I’m sure you had your reasons. It’s not a big deal.”
“Aw, thanks for the concern Dean, my dear,” Jack says, pinching Dean’s cheek, “but I can handle myself. Now where was I...? Oh yes! Rules. The big one. Well, really there’s only one --”
When Cas realizes what Dean is up to however, he jerks away. Wide, shocked eyes stare at him, “Dean, don’t.”
“Dean, when you’ve been with other people, do you ever feel lost or sad afterward?” Cas tilted his head, still unphased and calm.
Dean had the first round of dumplings started.  Since Cas had already made the filling, it was only a question of cutting and wrapping the dough and then pan-frying them.  He was working on the third round of wraps while the previous round cooked.
“Stop,” she said. “Whatever you’re doing inside your head, stop.  It’s not helping.”  She ushered him back to the chair where she had tended his wounds and replaced his bandages earlier.
After staring at Dean for a moment, he laid an arm over the back of the couch, his hand near Dean but not touching.  He waited, watching as Dean tried to work up to an impossible answer.
Dean exhaled, glad to have at least some things explained.  Cas was sitting up now facing Dean, so Dean carefully slipped his finger’s under Cas’s.  He tensed and looked around them.  A smile danced across his lips before he took Dean's hands in his own.
“From what Michael’s told me, it’s some sort of agreement with their dad, who is the CEO of the company they work for. Also he pays the taxes on this place, which are probably gargantuan.”
“Or what? You’ll divorce me? How’s your nice, conservative family going to feel about that? Think you’ll still be able to live in that big house if you disappoint your father? You’re already on thin ice with him. He’d be so disappointed to watch you fall from grace.” Castiel knew he had the upper hand here. Luke couldn’t get rid of him even if he tried. Chuck had extremely high expectations of his children, so if they didn’t meet them, they’d get the boot. Divorce was very taboo in the Milton family, and it could be just the thing to get Chuck to cut Luke off.
Classes start up again the next day. Castiel rides his bike to campus like he always does. The day is warm and the sky is cloudless. There’s some fear lingering in Castiel’s head. He knows that the angels will come for him, it’s a matter of when. In the meantime, he goes to class.
“Thank you.” Cas walks over to the wall and turns on a string of fairy lights that go around the perimeter of the ceiling. He closes the curtains to his windows, which leaves the room ambiently lit. “I know what the implications of bringing someone home are, but I’m not trying to pressure you into anything. We can just sit and talk if that’s what you want. I can get you something to drink.”
Castiel drives quietly for a minute, then has a thought. “I know it’s not dinner, but we could call this a date. We’re about to be stuck together in the car for at least two hours. Then we’ll have your brother. We can talk like we’re on a date until he gets in.”
“Of course.” Castiel knelt down and put some glitter in Jack’s hair, not bothering to think about washing it out later.
Once Jack and Dean had finished eating, Dean washed the dishes and retreated upstairs to shower. When he was done, he walked back downstairs to check on Jack and Castiel, and to make sure that Castiel left. He didn’t have much of an issue with Castiel staying, but two nights in a row was a little much for Dean.
Ash is practically Jo’s brother, though not by blood. He was adopted by the Harvelle family as a young child, so he grew up in the Roadhouse, Ellen’s bar in Dahlonega, a town in the mountains way up in North Georgia. Dean talked about visiting the Roadhouse as a teenager and how it was the only place he knew in Georgia. Part of his motivation to transfer to UGA was to be in the same school as Jo and Ash.
His classes are pretty close together, so he doesn’t have to go back and forth from the house to campus. He takes his bike out of the trunk of his car and rides it to his first class at 8am. It’s in one of the massive lecture halls, which aren’t his favorite, but he’s willing to tolerate them.
Dean nodded. “Sounds about right to me. I can say with confidence that you’re the nicest angel I’ve ever met.”
Dean was still processing when Luke came home. He looked over at the alpha and searched him for any faults, scrutinizing every detail. Jealousy changed a man.
Dean carried Claire into the bathroom and set her down, only for her to bolt and dive underneath the bed, curling into a ball in the middle. Dean sighed and laid on his stomach next to the bed. He tried to army-crawl under there, but he didn’t fit. “Claire, you need to come out. The faster you get in, the faster it’ll be over.”
It was hard to hear the other conversations going on around the table when Dean was so in his own head, but when he heard Castiel speaking, he listened.
Castiel feels groups eyes on him as he takes the glass from Gabriel. He chuckles to himself and shakes his head before throwing back the shot. He was never the biggest whiskey fan, nor was he very good at shots, so he clicked his tongue and let out a breath through his mouth once it was down.
The only time it got awkward was when Dean walked into the kitchen while they were making out. Castiel was eager to eat, but Luke had other plans as he carried him upstairs.
When Dean started getting delirious and stopped talking, Castiel knew he couldn’t wait any longer. He stuck his head out the door and yelled.
“When they gave you to us, they said that you’d come home to them one day. I didn’t think it would be this soon, but that’s okay. They said that you would join them as an angel.”
Castiel finally sets down the last box against the wall. He looks around the apartment and lets out a long sigh. It’s going to take forever to unpack. The furnishings are bare and the kitchen is empty save for the appliances. The large windows look out on the city skyline and let in heaps of sunlight that spills across the floor.
Dean looked at Castiel, then back at Jack. “I...I’m not sure. Someone’s going to take you home at some point.”
Castiel ate until he finished his lunch. “I know we’re technically at the end of our sex ban, but let’s avoid jumping straight back into it. We’ll just let it happen naturally.”
“You and Dean have a thing going. Don’t think I haven’t noticed. I’ve watched you make love-y dove-y eyes at him since the day he walked through the door. Michael doesn’t pay attention to the scent when you two are locked away during Dean’s heat, but I have. It’s mostly Dean’s heat, but lately, you’ve been mixed in with it. You’re not just helping him out, are you?”
Dean saw the remains of the casserole on the stove. In a glass pan was a black, charred lump of...something.
Once he had his bearings, he was walking with Michael all around the hall. He didn’t speak, just politely smiled and shook hands when introduced to people. He didn’t really feel like himself out there. To all of these people, he was Michael’s meek, silent omega…just another pretty face. Dean wondered if this would be the rest of his life, or worse, he’d become what they saw.
“It was just really rough on me. I got really sick right after the honeymoon. I couldn’t hold down food for the first four hours of every day. I thought it was a stomach bug the first day, but then I knew what it probably was. I went to a doctor a week later and they confirmed it. I was given a bunch of advice for the nausea that didn’t work, but I tried anyway. I had high blood pressure, which was scary. I had a lot of pelvic pain, which sucked. Then when I had her, it was on the bathroom floor in the middle of the afternoon. I kept calling Michael and saying I needed to go to the hospital, but he didn’t believe me. It was way too early. She was born at 30 weeks and only weighed three pounds.”
The door cracked open and Castiel’s head poked in. “Hey, I saw Michael dump you in here. I just wanted to check on you. I’ll be bringing you food and water during your heat. Is there anything I can get you now?”
“Night, Cas.” Dean hid the burner phone under the mattress and went back to Michael’s room. It was easy to slip back into his arms and relax. Fortunately, sleep came easily.
Cas looks carefree as he dances beside Dean. It’s like he’s letting loose. Dean wonders if he’s like this all of the time or if Pride just brings this side of him out.
“We considered staying together, even after that. I wanted to be there for Ben. To me, he was still my kid. Eventually, she decided that she wanted to be with Ben’s biological dad, who stepped into the picture and wanted to be a dad. It tore me apart, man. I lost my girlfriend, who I planned on marrying, and my kid at the same time. I was going to still be in his life, but I screwed it all up.” Dean leans forward and buries his face in his hands.
“Thanks for the offer, but I think I’ve got it. It’s not too tall of an order.” Dean started gathering ingredients and closed the fridge just in time to see Luke picking Castiel up despite their height difference and toting him away.
It finally subsides just as a few friends come over, just Meg and Gabriel. Castiel emerges from his room with bags under his eyes. He’s in old jeans and a t-shirt, which make him look even more disheveled. Meg and Gabriel look at him funny, but stop when Castiel insists that he’s fine.
Castiel smiled softly. “I’m not going to lie, that last line wasn’t very platonic. It sounded a little romantic to me.” He laughed softly when Dean elbowed him, his cheeks red with embarrassment.
Castiel chuckles and shrugs. “I know it’s been a long time for you. Don’t sweat it.” His eyes widen. “Dean.” He turns and runs back to Dean’s unconscious body.
“Clarence! Get over here and greet your best friend!” Meg stands up with a cheshire grin on her face.
Dean swallowed. Castiel’s scent was seeping into the room and it was driving his senses mad. All he could do was curl in on himself. “Some over the counter painkillers.”
Dean frowned. Castiel already noticed that? He would have told him eventually, but this was sudden. “Is it that obvious?”
“You absolutely can get out. Any time you want. If I wanted to leave, I could. If you wake up ten years from now and you hate your life, you could leave. He can’t hold you here against your will. One, it’s illegal, and two, I really doubt he would. He likes you a lot, and he wouldn’t want you to leave, but he has to let you.” Castiel put a hand on Dean’s shoulder.
“Yeah, so you could have led me on even more.” Dean shoved a bite of waffle into his mouth and looked up at Castiel.
“They do. It’s not uncommon for the people with the status the Milton family has. It won’t be frowned upon.”
Castiel sits in the desk chair and takes a deep breath. “I’ve been hearing voices for the past few weeks. It kind of goes with my tinnitus. My ears ring and then I hear them.”
“Of course. The family has its issues, just like any other, but my husband takes care of me as I take care of him.”
Dean got an idea right before he was going to reach for Castiel’s cock. He moved his hand behind himself and ran three fingers over his hole, collecting the slowly trickling slick that was there.
“It is. I like tutoring math. It makes me better at it and strengthens my basics. It’s just stressful when there’s people waiting and I don’t have the time to sit there one-on-one with everyone.” Dean picks at a stray thread on his jeans.
Castiel walked slowly to the living room after a solid 19 hours of rut. Luke was really asleep now, not just napping. Castiel started a new embroidery project to clear his head. Despite the shower, his nose still itched.
Castiel nods. “Yeah, I have one in ten minutes, and it’s a five minute bike ride to the building that it’s in. I’ll see you back at the house tonight.”
“Me either.” Dean sighed, running his hand up and down Castiel’s arm. “I don’t know. Maybe we are soulmates. Who knows?”
“You’ve been around here for a long time. I trust you to take good care of Jack for a little while. Can you do that?” Jody had her signature mom-look on, and it made Dean cave.
Castiel chuckled softly at Dean’s choice of words. “Of course. I think that would be best for everyone involved. No feelings, just...as you said, bros helping bros.”
Castiel feels himself getting nervous about the date, but then he reminds himself that he and Dean were pretty much together already and the date is just a formality. Still, it’s important to him and he wants it to go well.
Castiel took Dean’s phone graciously and waited a few seconds before dialing the number. He kept the call on speakerphone and took a deep breath.
Through the large double doors was a massive banquet hall. There was a bar on the left with many patrons getting drinks, a stage with live music, tables with hors d'oeuvres, and scattered circular tables with name cards, where Dean could safely assume they would be eating.
Michael sat down and opened a bottle of champagne that was in a bucket of ice beside the couch. He poured two glasses and handed one to Dean. “To you, my husband, Dean Milton.”
Dean knocked gently on Castiel’s door. “I’ll just set this down out here and then head downstairs.” He set the bag down and heard footsteps. The smell got more intense and he swore he heard a growl. Dean turned and walked away quickly, hoping he hadn’t upset Cas. He retreated to his own room and found himself faced with a problem: he was horny.
Dean nodded. “You’re right, there’s nothing we can do about it. Besides, it was fun, and we got our chance. Now we can put it to rest.”
Dean smiled. “Dude, I’m so proud of you. Back in Chicago, you wouldn’t have said that. You’ve grown a lot.”
Gabriel nodded, though he seemed to sense that something was wrong, so he walked into the room further with his hands in his pockets. “Where are you from? I know you flew in from Sioux Falls.”
Castiel sits in the library, working on his first essay of the semester. He looks up when someone approaches him. He expects Gabriel, who he had seen a few times in the library before. Instead, it’s Dean.
Dean’s eyes flick from Castiel’s eyes to his lips a few times. They inch closer together, hands still holding each other tightly. Dean closes the gap and kisses Castiel, his eyes flickering shut. The moment is made that much sweeter by Castiel’s arms wrapping around him. Something tickles the back of Dean’s neck, and with a small peek, Dean sees Castiel’s wings wrapping around both of them.
“I think the doctor just said to keep my temperature monitored and if it gets too high again to go back to the hospital.”
Dean hid a frown at that. At least he was being honest about not being able to be there during the day. “Thanks.”
Luke turned around and leaned against the counter. “Don’t worry about it. I’m not working today because of the company dinner. Michael is just a workaholic and can’t stand to be away from the office.” He chuckled. “Cassie tells me you cook a mean breakfast.”
Dean tried to ignore how weird all of this felt. He couldn’t believe that there was an angel and a human in his house right now. Just the thought was enough to unnerve him, but living it was a whole other story.
They ended up watching a second movie after the first one ended. When they went to bed that night, they were both much more relaxed than they had been in the past two weeks. Dean slept better than he had in a long time, his head on Castiel’s chest.
“Then what was it?” Dean takes a slow step forward. His eyes are trained on Castiel’s chest, and he tries to pull them away.
“I know, me too.” Dean gasped softly when Castiel’s fingers slid into him. “Mmm, the return on the magic fingers.”
Michael slid in beside Dean and the driver shut the door. The atmosphere was tense, so no one spoke. Today’s top hits in pop played over the speakers, much to Dean’s dismay. He tried to ignore the music and focus on how he was going to react to Michael’s proposal. He needed to be surprised, definitely happy-surprised. Anything else would seem off. He ran through what he would say over and over in his head, taking time every few minutes to look at Castiel and see if his expression had changed.
