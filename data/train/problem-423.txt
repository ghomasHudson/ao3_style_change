John shuffled a bit closer. Erasing the space between them, he pulled their joined hands onto his thigh and smiled to himself when he felt Sherlock’s head on his shoulder.
Hesitantly, he walked into his bedroom picking up a pack of biscuits on the way.
?” There was mischief written in the corners of John’s eyes. Sherlock tried to gather as much data from his expression as possible.
As always, it was over after a new pile of coins had formed around his feet. The guard that usually stood in front of his chamber came to feed him. Everything went as usual until it suddenly didn’t.  While chewing his fish pie, Sherlock noticed something sharp and metallic in his mouth. Although he attempted to not show it, the guard knew exactly what had happened. Sherlock already readied himself for a struggle when the guard just winked at him.
“You could have told me, you know?”
“I….” Sherlock stammered, creasing his brows in irritation.
“The good thing is, from what I seen, everything seems to be healthy and functional. You can get up and dress now. If it happens again, come to me and we will take a closer look at possible reasons.”
His senses were alight with the knowledge of semi-erect flesh slightly pressing against his backside.
They had been talking for a while now, both of them avoiding the topic of Omega-Heat. John didn’t know how to ask for something that was obviously a precarious subject to Sherlock but what he had read about it had made him curious, uncomfortable and aroused in equal measures.
The only reaction that drew from the grinning man in front of him was a shrug. John had to hold up his hand in a
John watched two men cautiously nearing the illuminated area. They took turns taking the lead by stopping behind everything that could possibly shield them on the way. Both appeared to have evolved differently. The bulky back of one an odd counterpoint to the other's locust-like limbs. John felt a finger brush the back of his hand.
“1. Now, Sherlock!”
“Alright, alright!” John replied amused and lined his cock up with Sherlock’s hole.
Lestrade shook his head looking at him incredulously.
Immediately, John obliged. Pushing his hands under Sherlock’s upper body and hooking them around angular shoulders, he pulled back as far as possible without allowing his cock to slip out completely.
*****
“Do I not look like a monster to you?” Their former client asked with agitation, turning around promptly. “Does this look HUMAN TO YOU?” John stood frozen in his place. He couldn’t answer her. All he managed to do was stare at her back where she had mutilated the new aspects of herself in a horrific way. The doctor could see the small mouth-like slits that once held her tentacles hidden from the world, but now they were burned and seemed like wilted flowers hanging limply from her back. Three of her tentacles were still discernable even after she’d cut most of them off, apparently using a blunt knife or scissors. John was shocked by the evident desperation behind the act.
“Oh, Sherlock..”
Unsure on how to proceed he fidgeted awkwardly with his hands. “So, um, that’s settled then.” He stated uncomfortably. John lay his head to the side, a thoughtful expression on his face.
Slowly, hesitantly the Yard came to life again. All the while, 221b was largely forgotten by the outside world. But not entirely.
“I saved your life, had I not convinced them to send you home they would have had you for life in prison for what you did,” He prepared to go for his gun, surely now he had doomed them both, John cast a glance at Sherlock on the floor, he moved, still alive; good.
Peter sneered at John. Face contorted in a mask of rage and madness, eyes gleaming like a cornered weasel. He lifted the shotgun as if to hit Sherlock again, John saw his chance and took it.
“Now I will kill you John, you and your friend. Did you think I wouldn’t find you or that I would leave you alone just because you make friends with police officers and detectives?”
He crossed the street rummaging in the inner pocket of his coat, earning an angry honk as a car had to brake hard to stop from running him over. Sherlock didn’t even notice, he had only one word running circles in his head; John.
He blows carefully on the surface of his tea, trying to cool it down enough that he can avoid scalding himself. He studies Sherlock over the top of his mug, a familiar tumbling feeling in his stomach so old and worn by now that he hardly registers it. His roommate looks brooding today, a small crinkle between his eyebrows and a faraway look in his eyes; apparently lost to the world. His cheeks are rosy from the cold outside and it lends him an almost healthy glow.
Sherlock signed his recipe and pocketed his card, “Thank you”, he said politely to the landlord who just grunted.
Sherlock obeyed, sitting up and letting John peel the coat off him. As John’s fingers brushed over his shoulders he could feel that he was drenched to the bone, his body shivering from the cold.
Sherlock carefully pushed open the window with his glove clad hand. It was dark inside and seemed empty. But you could never be too careful. He quickly glanced around him, but it was in the middle of the night and not a soul was about, in one swift, graceful motion he was inside, carefully sliding the window shut behind him.
Looking down at himself, he saw John kneeling between his legs and slowly licking over the stark black tattoo he’d put there. The doctor’s hands were resting on his waist while he seemed to appreciate his handiwork in a most singular way. When John looked up, their eyes met over Sherlock’s still naked body.
“What are you dreaming lately?” Sherlock asked, his tone implying that he knew all too well about the explicitness of John’s dreams.
“I suppose when he tended to my wound he somehow shared into my… evolution. I am very sure he has gained mental abilities instead of physical traits. I gained both, apparently. What about you? I didn’t get the impression that your mental abilities are any more impressing as they were before.”
As sudden as the nuisance had started, it stopped. Relieved, the bunkers inhabitants recovered, wiping the wetness from their faces and breathing deliberately slow.
It was 3 am when John woke up to find himself cuddled up against Sherlock. It took him a while to realize that, in the first light of day, this could turn out to be problem. Even though if right then it didn’t feel like one. John felt oddly content right where he was. Sharing a bed with his best friend, felt like a natural progression of their relationship to him. In the evening, John had simply done what the situation had called for, usually that was a course of action that worked out for him. Until there would be evidence to the contrary he wouldn’t make himself regret his behavior. He pushed himself up resting his head on his left hand to look at Sherlock’s relaxed face and rhythmic respiration.
“Sherlock, I…I am sorry, but…oh, fuck!” John let his head fall back. Sherlock thrust into him even harder and faster, at the exact angle that would ensure that he brushed against John’s prostate. With a loud groan, that suspiciously sounded like Sherlock’s name, John came harder than he had done in a long time.
Slowly, Sherlock turned his head towards John and watched his rapid eye movement. He had nearly gotten them both killed. Never before had he experienced fear for another person. He wouldn’t have expected it to be for utterly selfish reasons, but it was. There was no part of his life that he didn’t share with John. No part that wasn’t worthless without him.
“Your physiotherapist will be here in 5 minutes. You’re going to need some space for the exercises.”
Sherlock had slowly begun to come over, mindful of intruding on him but knowing that John preferred not to be too emotional in front of strangers. And there were several grieving visitors scattered all over the cemetery.
Be great in act, as you have been in thought.
John passed Tesco everyday for the next three days. Sometimes he went in, sometimes he didn’t. He knew that his behavior was odd, if not plainly obvious. It had a good effect on his fridge, either way.  John just couldn’t stop himself from searching for contact. He needed to know. He needed to know everything. But the girl didn’t show up again.
“If you won’t help me, piss off!”
“It’s not about what I want. It’s about what needs to be done.” He couldn’t keep the bitterness from his voice.
“Home.” He ordered as he held out his hand for the other to take.
Before he finished his train of thought, Sherlock pulled back.
“OK, guys. That's enough for now. I don't know about you but I don't want to find out what else is hiding in the dark without being prepared for it. Fuck, I don't even know if what we saw was human once. And if it was...” Greg's voice trailed off uncertainly.
Looking up, John wanted to ask what that was supposed to mean when Sherlock turned him around and bend down to whisper in his ear.
“That I rescheduled your physiotherapy doesn't mean we should skip the massage, as well.” John's brain needed a moment to catch up before he nodded enthusiastically.
Sherlock leans back on his bed. That is certainly much more interesting than he thought it to be. After a few seconds of thinking, he knows that this is going to be a great day.
“I…I am ready. Bedroom, now!” He takes Sherlock’s hand, dragging him to the bedroom that is closest. Which means Sherlock’s, of course. John falls back on the bed, pulling Sherlock down on top of him.
“Take a deep breath and close your eyes. 5….”
There was no need to remain silent when Sherlock was so deep in his head that it made him talk out loud. Relaxing further, John hung his jacket over a kitchen chair and put the kettle on.
Taking a seat on the chair in front of the doctor’s desk, John recited the speech he had been repeating in his head over and over again.
“Piss off!” It was everything Sherlock could reply. Prince James repelled him like nobody else had ever done.
“Does it hurt?” He heard himself ask while letting his fingers idly wander over the foreign surface. Sherlock sighed shakily.
When John Watson was 10 years old his mother told him about destiny.
“That was surprisingly pleasant. I wouldn’t mind a repetition.” Sherlock said, as if he was talking to himself but he looked expectantly at John, who immediately understood that there would be no further explanation in the near future. Not a first, when it came to Sherlock’s actions.
“0.2 per cent of the world’s population are Alpha-born. 3 per cent Omega. At least, that’s what my figures say.”
“I see,” he heard Sherlock reply to Lestrade, after he had looked the thing over, he pocketed it. Lestrade just raised an eyebrow, but did nothing to stop him from taking what must be evidence.
John mentally called himself every name he had ever heard of, starting with stupid and ending with not even fit to be the arse on an arse.
“They were all placed to be found, to be a warning both to John and the
“Out,” was all Sherlock said and it was as if speaking freed him from a spell. He shook himself and let go of the door, he walked in and placed the package on the kitchen table. He shrugged out of his coat throwing it over the hanger, it seemed to John like he was trying to avoiding looking at him.
As he cut Sherlock free, pulling the broken vest off him, he couldn’t help but cry out as he spotted the mess of Sherlock’s chest, a mass of angry red bruises and dark blood smeared all over it, covering him in a wide jagged circle across the torso. He felt carefully, fingers trailing the hurt flesh, feeling for things broken beyond repair. He counted six fractured ribs, but none shattered and no actual bullet holes, just skin broken from hard impact.
He stood utterly still, Sherlock still in his loose embrace, moth hovering but not touching Sherlock’s lips. After what felt like a lifetime, he felt Sherlock’s hands at the small of his back, the gentlest of presses but it was enough. His body came alive and a heated burning flared up abruptly in him as Sherlock met him kiss for kiss.
“A deal you broke before it was even made,” Sherlock said and lowered his voice so that even John had trouble hearing what he said, standing right beside him, “It was a mistake to think that you could hurt John and get away with it,” His eyes held a dangerous gleam and Sara grew quiet, unconsciously she backed away half a step and looked suddenly uncertain.
Just before closing the door behind himself, he says almost absently to John, “You take it or throw it away. I normally just burn them but since you have that ridiculous rule about open flames in the flat...” He trails of leaving the sentence unfinished as he closes the door behind him.
“You sure you want another one mate?” The landlord asked, looking suspiciously at John’s slumped figure and creased sweater.
He supposed that maybe this was the reason he felt so protective. John was his after all, this murderer, this man threatening John, it was personal.
“How do you know all this?” John asked.
Sherlock was sitting in the back of a cab, fingers drumming restlessly on his knee, one hand closed into a tight fist resting under his chin. So stupid, John had been right, he was thick. How had he not seen this before, it was so obvious and now his carelessness would get John killed.
The words earlier so eager seemed to dry up and he grew quiet, hoping Sherlock understood what he was rambling on about. The way the man stiffened on the sofa told John he had gotten it.
“Peter,” John said.
The next second he was on him, his own weight toppling them both to the ground and they fell in a pile, riffle crushed between them.
“If you are done joking can we get back to the case...,” He didn’t wait for an answer or finish the sentence but suddenly fixed his gaze on something and taking a steady grip on John’s upper arm pulled him along straight into the dancing crowd.
This just would not do John thought, why was Sherlock trying to do this on his own, didn’t he trust him? John scratched his chin absently, his finger tracing the fine stubble already covering it, even though he had shaved that very morning. He nodded at Mrs Smith who had just said something quite derisive about bus drivers and made a decision: this would have to end.
“Yeah, I think there is no doubt about that one,” Lestrade agreed looking over at Watson. “We should put you in custody for your own safety John. Until this is all over.”
He pulls the man over him, holding him tight as he presses them flush. There are some moments of moaning and reciprocal grinding, breaths hot and lips sliding slick against each other before Jon flips them around and with shaking hands undress Sherlock in full. His erection is as pale as the rest of him, lying flush against his stomach. John eagerly grabs the smooth length and slides his thumb gently across the head smearing out the perfect drop of pre-come resting there.
“What do you want Peter?” John carefully kept his hands steady over his head, he could feel the weight of the gun, he needed a distraction, needed to put Peter at ease.
A lingering flash of panic made him dizzy and for a moment he thought he would throw up, he had to rest a hand against the slick stone wall at the corner.
He squinted at the sun which seemed to get brighter by the minute. Focusing on the pounding of his head as it beat in sync with his steps, making it sound like someone was following close behind. He was glad his legs knew the way, all he had to do was follow. As he approached his bus shelter a black Mercedes with tinted windows came fast towards him, tires screaming as it stopped and from one second to the next everything went black.
“There will be a next time and if we live through that there might even be a time after that,” John looked down, dragging a hand through his hair, words stumbling on each other in their need to be said. “Danger follows you around like a second shadow and so both you and I will always live in its wake. I will not go through this again, to believe that you or I are about to die and wonder what could have happened had I had the courage to act.”
“Does it have to be a connection; could it just be random?” John asked.
“What is that vile thing in your hand?” John jumped as Sherlock suddenly stood beside him, one slim elbow resting on the bar and restless eyes scanning the crowd.
The abandoned countryside yard from earlier, filled with wilting greenery and crumbled red brick walls, was gone and in its place milled at least fifty metropolitan police officers all crisp uniforms and brisk steps. There was even a helicopter hovering above them, its rotor blades spinning so fast that the officers had to shout to make their voices carry over the ruckus. The blinking lights from the police vehicles showered everything in a flickering blue blanket.
John quieted, he had suddenly put words to one of the many things which had hunted him for months, experiences that he still did not know what to do with or how to handle. Things slowly eating him up from the inside out.
“So it seems,” Sherlock answered through slightly blue lips, not moving.
Sherlock for once didn’t know what to say, there were few things that mounted up to this.
The second dead had been the one in charge of sending him to the British army as a civilian nurse. His orders had been to look for the historical treasures of the national museum, which had gone missing sometime during the war.
He got up and dressed in the dim light entering from the window, winced as the sweater pulled across the bruise on his head. His stomach started to protest loudly and he realized that had no notion of when he had last eaten but it felt like weeks, a churning hole in his middle. He padded down barefoot into the sitting room and his nose picked up the smell of curry. Quite correct, a white paper bag of take-away was sitting on the table top and even though it was cold to his touch a sweet smell of Madras was filling the air.
Sherlock laid his hand over John’s stilling it, “Will you tell me what happened?” The question was simple and undemanding, it was only a question and John was free to answer in whatever way he wanted.
“Yes, Sherlock, I’m listening”
“I do not live here,” he tried saying it out loud. But it did not change anything; he had still walked here, without even realizing what he was doing.
Somewhere John found an energy reserve, something his body had been saving for matters of life and death, which surely this was. The distance to Sherlock shrunk as he forced his body onwards, they were running shoulder to shoulder now, he looked over at Sherlock who was smiling a wild, wicked smile as he ran and he realized a similarly mad smile was plastered on his own face.
Sherlock left his untouched coffee cup behind and followed at a distance as she crosses into Regent Street. The city was filled with early Christmas shoppers and Sherlock had no trouble following her unseen, weaving his way between stressed out moms and posh couples. The woman continued in on Burton Street and slowly criss-cross her way along the smaller roads until she reached Park Lane.
He walked in blind, the dark city spinning around him, streetlights and cars illuminating his way.
John carefully lifted Sherlock’s head and met his lips. Tongue entering his hot mouth and kissing him deeply as Sherlock kissed back. For a second he lost himself in the kiss as Sherlock’s dick rubbed, head leaking unconsciously against the crook of his hip.
For once Sherlock looked as tired as him, a flush on his otherwise white cheeks and he was holding on to John’s arm in a mutual attempt at staying upright. John leaned back and let the rough brick wall take his weight, running a hand through his hair as he did. He closed his eyes as he tried to quiet his breathing.
He stopped on the street for a moment, looking at the garishly decorated corner store window, a green and blue blinking snowman was smiling next to a pink, plastic Christmas tree with silver baubles and tinsel. A newspaper stand outside was showing off the latest headline, ‘Mysterious death. Police still clueless!’
Suddenly they found themselves on their knees on the floor, limbs tangled, frenzied hands pulling at garments. John gasped as Sherlock bit his neck, running his tongue down towards his collar bone. A wet, hot trail across his skin which sent goose bumps all down his arms and made him go instantly hard in his trousers.
There was a steady bas beat thumping, the kind you could feel in your entire body luring you away to faraway places. On the dance floor in front of him the young and hip that only came out at night were moving to the music, their bodies sleek from sweat and taking on strange shapes as the different coloured lights swept over their heads. The place smelled of pheromones, alcohol, and sweat; like a piece of metal wrapped in silk.
After the bad guys had been loaded into trucks hh and Sherlock had been driven to the hospital in a waiting ambulance, apparently Lestrade had argued that with Sherlock you never knew. After a brief check-up and some bandages to keep Sherlock’s broken ribs in place which he had tried to insist he didn’t need, they had joined the others here where food had been waiting on them, John ate as if he hadn’t seen a morsel of nourishment in days.
He fishes around in his shoulder bag which is standing beside the armchair and pulls out a present wrapped in a hideous bright green paper riddled with little elf’s in pointy hats dancing with each other. John had chosen the ugliest, most ridiculous paper he could find. He is sure Sherlock will get the point.
-oOo-
He pulls Sherlock to him and kisses him again thinking that a man could die happy like this. Soon they are back to panting, grinding frantically against each other and John falls backwards, dragging Sherlock down on the bed with him.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” He inched over a bit so Sherlock had more room and opened his eyes.
“Oh? Lestrade finds this on a corpse and oh is your answer?” Sherlock looked baffled, leaning over the coffee table towards Watson, intense eyes burning a hole in John’s head.
He rushed back down the stairs, holding the smooth mahogany banister to keep from tumbling over shouting, “Later,” to Mrs Hudson over his shoulder as he ran back out the door.
The place, the physical location, not the metaphorical, was absolutely covered in blood.
“What is it, are you hurt,” Sherlock looked at him, concern shoving on his face but how could John explain what was ailing him.
He could feel Sherlock’s body stiffen under his touch, “Lestrade, the case, off course I need to focus.”
”. The door closed behind a dark haired woman clad in a close fitting, beige trench coat and high heels. She looked mid 30 but it was hard to tell from this distance, she could just be dressing young. She opened her umbrella against the rain and started off down the street with determined steps.
“Oh.”
Then Sherlock is kissing him, lips meeting his and pressing insistently towards him. John realizes dimly that this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity and he should really, really take advantage of it. He starts to respond to the kiss, opening his lips ever so slightly and Sherlock is immediately there, hot tongue darting inside and licking deep into John’s mouth.
John tried with his mind to will the blood away by thinking of football but for some reason that led to locker rooms which led to showers and then he was back where he had started.
“You know this is a sealed environment, you can’t do that. It could contaminate evidence samples.”
Lestrade had been pleased beyond words and Sherlock had been smugger than usual. He had wanted to go out, eat and celebrate their victory, which he enthusiastically had ensured would not have been possible without John. He said this and clasped John’s shoulder, long fingers leaving burn marks through his clothes.
Yet all the time he was still dead; leaving John behind. Alone again. The world should have stopped and mourned, torn its hair and cried salted tears that scourged the earth.
“Oh, someone hit me over the head when I tried to escape,” He smiled bitterly, “It didn’t go so well as you might have noticed,” John tried to flex his arms, pain clear in new lines forming on his face. Sherlock let his hands drop away from him, feeling weirdly forlorn as he lost physical contact with his friend; like he needed to touch him to be sure he was there.
If Lestrade didn’t give the order soon Sherlock thought vaguely that he would go insane, he would cross that fine line between genius and madman once and for all. At that precise moment a radio on the police behind him crackled into life and out over the static came Lestrade’s steady voice, “Team Doyle, the garage has been cleaned you go on five, Stand by.”
Inside the flat it was empty. He was too late. He had tried John’s phone on the way, but no one had picked up.
Bus, off course! The first Mets officer hadn’t even had time to get out of her police vehicle and Sherlock was already running. As he ran his mind worked in highest gear, trying every possibility and rejecting the answers as quick.
Sherlock pulls him close, hands sliding down to grip his arse and John grinds helplessly into his hip as he starts to work Sherlock up and down. Sherlock turn to the side facing him and his lips meet John’s again and it is better than anything John can remember. He lets Sherlock’s dick go and grabs his hips, grinding against him as their mouths fight for possession.
Everything was brown, grey and beige, those winter colours melding into a profile of rolling hills. In the midst of it all was a railway track, cutting a scar through the landscape. It was so human it felt strangely out of place in the cold morning. Tendrils of fog curled around everything, even here between him and Sherlock, making the other man seem farther away than he was, like light years separating the two.
He ignored the rough carpet and the sharp piece of gravel under his shoulder blade, the only thing that mattered was this fragile thing here between them. Pain was inconsequential he thought, pleasure was not the point. The point was something else, more fundamental; closeness, fulfilment, pledging, a promise made in flesh.
He sighed and sat upright and idly watched the grey buildings sidle by. It was almost Christmas or at least the right season. He did his best to avoid thinking about it though, yet it was hard with all the windows done up with lights and colours. It was the time of year when people went shopping with money they did not have, ate and drank too much, and spent time with people they… John stopped himself and shook his head. For a moment he had almost thought about him.
He tried to start,
As he fiddled with the lock Sherlock told him about the tattoo and that it was a mark of membership to a Christian cult, very small, very secret.
Sherlock shakes his shoulders and turns to stare out the window like this, really is very inconsequential and he could not care less. John smiles suddenly and wonders if maybe, just maybe Sherlock is not so ice cold or uncaring about Christmas as he pretends. The burning of presents maybe more about brotherly rivalry than an aversion against the holiday per se.
In a fraction of a second Sherlock was over beside him, untying his hands asking how he was, his voice not at all unsteady, a hand clasping John’s shoulder.
“Not everyone has the sort of control over their bodies as you Sherlock.” Watson answered with just a tiny bit of cynicism in his voice.
Sherlock switched to dead man number one. Inch over inch he searched for that something; that piece of evidence which would let him save John. He was convinced that the murderer was only working his way towards his friend; soon they would make an attempt. John who never judged him and who always laughed with him, at all his weirdness, never at him. John who, for some mysterious reason, got him.
“You never bring work home from the clinic and you have no papers or journals indicating that you would have done so today. This tells me you that by work you mean writing that...” Sherlock paused, “...allegory of our cases.”
Hands trailed up his sides, one stopping at his waist doing circles over his shirt and the other came up to his chin, forcing his head slightly to the side, long fingers on his cheek and in his hair, sending shivers through his body. John’s hands travelled up a naked back, over scars he by now knew by sight but hadn’t touched, not like this. Sherlock’s skin was warm and dry and he could feel the muscles underneath.
He left John and ran two steps at a time down into the sitting room. He was missing something in the case; there was something wrong and not only John’s behaviour.
Nothing had happened? John looked over at Sherlock as he threw away the wig, muscles playing under the skin of his still naked torso. He was giving steady instructions to the driver through the metal grid that separated the two compartments. John took hold on one of the handles hanging from the roof as the van rolled into motion. He watched Sherlock’s profile trying to untangle a very strange sensation in his stomach.
His mind blank he turned around and started walking; things like that was the Police’s problem. It did not have anything to do with him anymore, not his life, not his problem, not his anything.
Hands, strong and delicate flew over the strings and bow. To John’s ears he seemed to torture the poor Stradivarius but Sherlock had ensured him it was supposed to sound like that. He couldn’t tell but he felt like Sherlock had his eyes closed, face serene as he played.
He tried to keep calm but that feeling of impending doom, a black bottomless pit of despair that he had waited for all morning finally descended upon him. His breathing was loud and harsh in his ears as the car swerved through the streets.
The team lead by Lestrade wouldn’t find anything, he was sure of it. But on the other hand it could not hurt to cover all bases so to speak. It was not petty revenge for having had to wait for backup or the ridiculous codenames.
John tried to stop Sherlock, surely this couldn’t be it. The place felt empty, unliveable. But Sherlock wasn’t looking back at John, eyes stuck somewhere in the next room and he could see him suddenly stiffen. Where they going to turn back, had he realised he was wrong?
“What is your opinion John?” Sherlock asked.
Outside he looked in every direction but could not see Sherlock anywhere. He had managed to avoid Lestrade’s shadow, leaving the undercover police car outside the clinic as he took the backdoor out; they would just be in the way, so there was no witnesses as to where Sherlock might have gone. He ran up to the nearest intersection and cast a glance around the corner, hoping to spot a taxi stuck in traffic, but no luck.
For a second he saw the shock in Peter’s eyes, but only for a moment. Then he pulled the gun down. To John it seemed to happen ever so slowly, he pushed the shotgun aside, there shouldn’t have been time, but there was. He flew forward in the air and he could see the whites in Peter’s eyes as he came.
He had moved out, a long time ago. He had found his own place, much less central and much cheaper. It was small, yet newly built and so clean that John hated it. All the walls where painted white and the rooms filled with IKEA furniture, “A perfect place for an eligible bachelor”, the real estate agent had said. John had tried to smile as he signed the contract.
He let his hands slide slowly down, across the vast expanse of Sherlock’s back. The soft skin broken by hard lumps of healed wounds and the supportive bandage Sherlock wore around his ribs. He slid further down, hands encircling a firm, naked buttock each. He kneaded them slowly as Sherlock licked, bit, and kissed his neck. He would worship Sherlock’s arse another day, he decided, when there was time. He pulled the cheeks apart, wishing he could see it as Sherlock let out a little moan against his jugular. Another day, he would take him apart with fingers and tongue.
“Sara,” Sherlock replied in a hard voice and he stood up, hand still holding on to John’s shirt, knuckles white.
Lestrade looked around the room and concluded that most seemed done eating and announced the debriefing started, he talked shortly about the case and called it a success before introducing Sherlock. “I believe most of you know Mr Holmes, he played an important part and will make some events clearer to all of us.”
“Alright...I..” John wanted to calm Sherlock’s embarrassment but he was too slow.
“You are sure.” It wasn’t a question but John nodded anyway.
It was strangely arousing to offer himself like that but it didn't feel odd. Hadn't he always offered himself up for Sherlock to take?
A first contact makes them realise how the world has changed.
Two days later, Lestrade had called them with a new case. They were running through a dark alley when Sherlock heard a loud
He had never asked Harry about the catalyst for her alcohol addiction, but he was relatively certain that she hadn’t been as lucky as him regarding their foster families. John felt an uproar of protectiveness every time he thought about all the things that might have happened to her. A sour feeling in his guts that latched out now and then to send hot pressure surging through his veins, and that could only be calmed with many deep breaths and strong tea.
“Oh, you know how I love baking. Especially for you two.” She hesitated before she went on. “And I wanted to talk to you. See how you're doing.”
The world lay quiet for two full days. The few people that weren’t affected by the profound change which mankind had to undergo felt lost and frightened while they hurried through empty streets. As most humans suffered through their genetic reconstruction, they were the ones left to themselves. They didn’t know yet that they would be part of a minority soon.
“I was just about to bring you..”
The next two days went by painfully unhasty. Not on purpose, both Sherlock and John avoided each other. The weight of an oncoming éclat bearing down on every interaction, no matter how mundane, making them squirm in the presence of the other.
With a start John sat up in his bed and tried to blink the images away.
“ 5 hours.” John said with a satisfied grin. “I think, I found a way to get you to rest.”
The doctor was very much inclined, Especially that ‘different part’. He had been so focussed on pleasuring Sherlock that his own, by now leaking arousal, hadn’t been on his agenda at all. Pulling his fingers out, he used the leftover lube in his palm to give his hard length an experimental tug and immediately decided to leave it at one. Reassuring himself, he recalled the last time he had them both tested after a potentially toxic case. Good.
Sherlock was getting restless underneath him. It was obvious in the way he threw his head back. In the way he gripped the cushion with his left hand and John’s forearm with his right. John saw all these things while he clung to his self control and already knew that, in the end, it was a lost cause. He had wanted for so long and now he was able to take. But first he would give.
He felt Sherlock's thrusts getting interrupted by a careful roll of hips. Heard more and more deep groans as they were pressed into his shoulder.
.” John sounded startlingly like Sherlock all those years ago before he returned to his usual persona by grinning cheerfully. “But I wasn’t angry at you. Merely disappointed.”
The widening of Sherlock’s eyes. The surprised huff of breath. A pale, long finger worrying two plush lips. It all told John that Sherlock had recognized the small bulge.
The living room was deserted when John came down in the evening. With clean clothes and a towel in his arms, he went to the shower. He still felt on edge and the feeling that he had crossed an important border made his movements uncertain and hesitant.
Now he had to wait.
Scanning the big contorted hall for the door to the stairwell
Sherlock had been unpleasant for quite some time now and it didn’t look like that was going to change soon. It didn’t matter what John did or said, Sherlock’s reactions varied just slightly between annoyed and utterly pissed off. It was even worse than his usual boredom induced moods and John definitely did not know what to make of it.
John knelt in front of him placing one hand on Sherlock’s left thigh. “How come I am the only person you can’t read properly?” He whispered as if there was a need for confidentiality.
“You don’t want to know.” He answered deliberately.
“Mine! You. Are. Mine.” Every word was emphasized by a thrust of his hips. Sweat was building on Sherlock’s chest and neck while the Detective’s moans grew louder and louder.
This time John wasn’t able to erase the images from his head. Before he had made a conscious decision he had taken himself in hand and was so very, very close to orgasm that he just had to finish. Had to take the edge off.
“Howard is obsessive and often forgets the time when we have appointments but he would never leave me.” She said to Sherlock, her black hair hiding most of her face. John never understood why some women straightened their hair but on their client it made him reconsider the aesthetic behind the procedure.  When she realized what she’d just said, her full lips began to tremble.
“Yes, eventually.”
“Naturally, I tried to figure out what it was. I managed to rule out STD’s or a simple wart but I am no urologist, so…”
“I don't know what you were thinking doing that but…”
“Money, of course. The excitement of our shared work. Also being grateful for you healing my intermittent tremor. I enjoyed spending time with you even though I wouldn’t be able to say why.”
Lestrade glanced over John’s shoulder, letting a curious gaze wander over Sherlock’s bare torso. John’s throat constricted and a deep growl emerged. Shocked, Lestrade threw his head around and regarded him with wide eyes.
“So, your mom actually wrote those books for you?” John asked amazed.
“Don’t worry. It is okay for an Omega to be naked around his Alpha.” Sherlock assured him.
“I did.” He replied resigned while he hung his coat over the hook at the back of the still open parlor door.
Hearing Sherlock destroyed John’s last bit of will power. Hard and fast, he pushed all the way in. He slung his arms around Sherlock’s torso and pressed them close together, resting his forehead against the Consulting Detectives chest.
Mrs. Hudson had needed some help climbing out of the crater that was their former front yard but she was doing pretty well, especially with the intense support Sean was willingly providing. With watchful eyes, Mycroft scanned their surroundings, his first trip to the surface apparently having made an impression.
Sherlock didn’t know where to go, after leaving the house at 4 am. He only knew that he needed as much space as possible to find out what John’s behavior meant. He had a vague idea but Sherlock knew that this
“Do what?” John asked raising his chin and looking into her eyes, unblinking. He saw Sherlock standing up as well behind her, ready to step in if necessary. It was such an unusual behavior that it caught John slightly off guard. Though, not as much as Mrs. Phillips beginning to pull her shirt over her head. This time he took a step backwards, unsure what to think and how to act. But he rapidly understood when he caught Sherlock glancing at her back with interest.
If John thought, the upper body had been relaxing, the thigh prove to be the opposite. Sherlock’s formerly systematic movements became careful, insecure even. And it didn't help that John had to concentrate on his earlier anger to suppress unwanted physical reactions. He'd always been sensitive at his inner thighs but this he hadn't expected. And looking down his body didn't help, either.
“Do you know something, I don't?” John asked, taken aback by the unusually thoughtful gesture.
His smile vanished when he found what he was looking for. Tears welled up in his eyes and his hands were shaking.
Mindful of the sensitive and irritated skin on Sherlock’s hip, John helplessly held on to the taller man’s waist whose lips had just parted and moved against his. Cautiously, the doctor pulled the lithe body closer, wanting to feel all of it at once and deepening the kiss by adding just small touches of his tongue to a full lower lip. When a shudder ran down Sherlock’s spine, John felt it in his fingertips, hands and arms, as if his body was trying to drink in responses and make them it’s own.
John should have suspected from the beginning when he saw the slight scratch on Sherlock’s thigh that looked so very infected but looking back probably wasn’t. He had just assumed that Sherlock was lying to him about the age of the injury. One more thing they didn’t talk about. What did it matter? But then the changes began and somehow John managed to remain oblivious while, at the same time, taking notes of the strange things that were about to happen.
*****
John nodded, emphatically.
Keeping himself in check during the drive back turned out to be very, very difficult. Especially with Sherlock entwining their fingers immediately after sitting in the back of the car, hidden from the driver's sight behind a black glass barrier.
John thought, pointedly glancing at Greg’s hands on Mycroft’s hips as both men hurried smiling to their cosy self-made cave.
. The constant ringing of the phone and voice messages of their client, the apparent widow, was only an annoying background noise. He couldn’t quite pinpoint what it was that made him uneasy but watching Sherlock somehow managed to calm his worry. Deliberately, he sat down and put his hand on Sherlock’s forehead. The skin felt cold and moist under his fingers. Cautiously, he slid his hand into sticky curls. He hadn’t planned to do that when he entered the room but seeing Sherlock in this weak state caused a strong wave of affection to bloom inside his chest. He felt oddly protective. Unlike other times when he very well knew that Sherlock could stand up for himself but protected him anyway. The Detective pushed his head into the touch, turning on his back and trying to sooth some kind of itch by moving restlessly on the sheets.
Sherlock’s eyes had been burning with passion and so when John saw this he just had to buy it, even though it was a lot more money than any sane, poor person should spend on a gift to a friend. Perhaps it also has this; I have really thought a bit too much on what I should buy you, quality to it. John ignores that bit though.
“Yes, I have him.”
Next year, he repeats in his own head, trying to force his body in on the deal, it is such an unwanted complication in John’s life, this whole light-headedness and breathlessness which afflicts him around Sherlock.
“I need to ask some questions sir.”
John had expected resistance and so had come prepared, “No. This concerns me and I am coming. Besides, in the past I have been good at keeping you in one piece.”
Sherlock suddenly jumped up, all energy and perfect alacrity as a small door opened next to the off-license. A small elegant brass plaque next to the door bell said: “
He continued up to the next intersection, waiving at a group of small children looking at him as he ran. They shouted after him, wondering why he was running, but he ignored them; he had important things on his mind. At that thought John stopped in his track, a strange and uninvited question sneaking up on him. He wondered weakly why it hadn’t seem odd to him that he had just left work for the sole reason to find Sherlock and insist that whatever he had planned, John was coming too. He had just left a patient and appointments, grabbed his pea coat and left, not looking back.
John took the stairs three steps at a time, just waiving at Mrs Hudson trying to approach to him in the hallway. When he came into the apartment, it was empty. He felt the cushions on the couch; he was learning after all, they were still warm, Sherlock could not have been gone for more than a minute or two.
-oOo-
Sherlock says nothing, just looks thoughtfully at John and as the moment stretch out John finds himself squirming in his seat for no good reason.
“Oh there was no need Mr Holmes as you can see,” Sara smiled and it did not reach her eyes.
“A deal then Mr Holmes,” She handed him the package and the phone number which he pocketed.
they rent it through a decoy which is why it took me some time to locate it,” Sherlock rolled up the sleeves on his ill-fitting tracksuit jacket. It had a large misshaped stain on the back; John tried not to guess where it had come from.
John smiled back.
“Yes and I might have made a New Year’s Eve promise that if things had not passed by now then well...” Sherlock smiles at him, “...I know I am a bit early here but I sincerely hope you do not mind?”
“It is all so obvious, so blatant. And this killing doesn’t really match the last one, the approach is completely different,” Sherlock shook his head, “Maybe there are two killers,” he did not feel convinced.
John looked on for a moment as she was dragged away, all the time struggling and screaming obscenities and threats after Sherlock. John turned away, he had seen enough.
“Yes of course,” The second time it came out a bit more believable and he even nodded with it. Of course he was fine, after all nothing had happened.
“I have no idea, please tell me,” He gave the plastic laminated sticker back to Sherlock, for some reason he didn’t like holding it.
Four nicotine patches later Sherlock was still no closer to a solution. He would have to do this the hard way. He sprung up from his resting place on the sofa, grabbed his coat and made for the laboratory at Scotland Yard. He would go over every piece of evidence, every detail, the bodies and the few leads they had. Everything until something told him what was going on.
He stood in the middle of the dark parlour staring ahead without seeing anything. His mind replaying their conversation again and again. It took him 12 minutes to admit to himself that the results weren’t conclusive. He was fairly sure that it would have been acceptable to follow John upstairs but the small doubt in the back of his mind, that hadn’t anything to do with insecurity, held him back.
“Sherlock! I am done.” John shouted with no little trepidation. Silence answered him.
“I..what?” John said irritated and shaking his head.
Sherlock slung his arms around John’s neck and pressed up into the touch. Forcing his eyes to open, he watched the muscles in John’s arms tense as the doctor lowered almost completely onto him.
Sherlock could see John stir, where he was lying.
“Ok. Um…Fine. That’s…”
The pain was quite helpful in that.
It doesn’t happen often but Sherlock is at a loss for ideas. He has no reason to refuse, though. He takes a picture of his mouth and only his mouth. He edits it on his phone especially to cut it down on this one feature. He has a feeling that this is what John wants.
It took him along. Wrung a guttural moan from his chest as the world came to a sudden halt. Every physical sensation narrowed down to his groin.
Though, John was cuddled up against him, Sherlock pulled him even closer. He was already starting to get restless but he knew that it was generally expected to remain in bed with ones partner after sex. He was determined to wait until John fell asleep. He had nothing else to do than lying around so it didn’t bother him all that much. John sighed against his chest.
People kept asking them how they managed to be so happy that everyone could see it and it always made him cringe inwardly when she looked at him fondly and called it "true love". His chest ached and he forced himself to return her smile with as much affection as he could muster.
Impatiently, Sherlock pushed himself up until John’s cock almost slid out of him before he sank down again. A sigh of relief escaped from his lips while John just held on to him.
He showered and left the flat. – MH
And then, on an average Friday at the Inn, Mike told him about Sherlock.
“So you woke them up?” Lestrade enquired.
“Again.” He mumbled closing his eyes and letting his head roll to the side.
“I don’t understand. That’s a nice speech you’ve just given but I don’t give a bloody fuck about your
Who would take Yorick, replace him a few days later with a lot of brothers and sisters, and leave a note for him that would lead him think about….doubt?
He should probably have felt used or humiliated or… emasculated. But the only thing he felt was the need to see Sherlock shake through his orgasm. Feel him come against his body and into his own pants.
John turned his attention to the corpse. Sherlock did too. The man was lying on his back, legs twisted in unnatural shapes to fit around the toilet bowl. His eyes were still open, slightly glazed and staring lifeless into the distant ceiling. Over the body, a handful of pennies were scattered. There was no sign of struggle.
Sherlock drags his fingers over the cover, following the lines in the oxblood coloured leather. John fidgets nervously in his chair whishing Sherlock would say something and eventually he can’t contain himself, “Do you like it? You hate it right?” He continues without allowing Sherlock any time to respond.
“He would be safe, police looking over him 24-7,” Lestrade said, slightly dour that Sherlock doubted him or his police force; maybe both.
Sherlock didn’t answer his question. Instead he let the fingers of his hands meet up in a pyramid closing his eyes, “Can you throw me a new packet of nicotine patches John.”
himself for any muscle or nerve problems.
“You are OK, are you not?” Lestrade leaned in, a questioning look in his eyes.
Inside is a grey sweater, knitted, with a collar and brown leather buttons down the front, not all the way down though. It is beautiful, John concludes, it makes him think of sailors of old and going to America by steam powered boats filled with hope about a better future. It is also horridly expensive looking. It doesn’t even have a brand name on it, only a distinctive handmade tag telling you the size and that under no circumstances should you attempt to wash it yourself.
Why? Well there was the obvious answer, just because. And not so obvious answers, people do because it is expected of them. Moreover, Lestrade is depending on you. People in general, even though they don’t know you exist are depending on you to keep them safe. Me, I am depending on you not to say the least. Somehow John didn’t think any of these answers would work on Sherlock.
He could feel the words coming out off-key and stilted. He had not known that was what he was going to say until he had. He was no child hoping for a miracle and he did not allow himself to ever feel hope. Hope, Sherlock would have said, was for the faint of mind; believe or do not, never hope. Maybe today was different though, maybe sometimes you could allow yourself to simply wish for the impossible; when you needed it the most.
The unease in his stomach at that thought was something new for Sherlock. It disconcerted him. Lately he had come to realise that he needed John. His life had changed since they had met, for the better.
But he hadn’t. As always Sherlock’s calm reasoning had won him over and now here he was; feeling like a fish on dry land.
“The man you are hunting is also hunted by us. So we offer a trade of sorts,” She placed a briefcase on the desk and opened it. She removed a grainy photograph and pushed it over to Sherlock.
“John?” Lestrade raised a questioning eyebrow at the man, not even bothering asking why Sherlock knew about the cameras or that the staff hadn’t seen anything.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock’s hand shoot out grabbing John’s in a vice like grip.
“I thought you said you hated Christmas?” John says, carefully wondering if this is a mine field he is treading without even knowing it.
Sherlock picked up the photo; on it was a man in his forties, short hair and a nose which clearly had been broken at one point. Sherlock was hit with a brief flash of a memory, the same man, a sneer on his face which Sherlock had not registered at the time. In the microsecond it took for Sherlock’s brain to get up to speed he relived the moment as he pushed a bald mailman out of the way in his haste to find John.
Outside Sherlock hailed a cab; John got in the back and after three attempts gave up trying to put his seatbelt on. Instead he focused on the bright light coming and going from the cars meeting theirs, leaning his forehead on the cool car window.
As he knocked on the door there was no answer, he knocked again, this time harder. He could hear shuffling inside. He banged again and bent down to shout into the letter opening, “It is the police, open up,” The shuffling steps approached the door and he could hear a security chain slide out of its bracket.
“You are quite correct John,” A smile slipped out before Sherlock could supress it.
John reached the stairs and dragging a hand along the painted concrete wall he started up after their goal. He shook his head trying to clear it, he wished he hadn’t had those drinks, but it had been the only way to stay awake. The wall was cool against his hand and wet from condensation. He ran the last steps not wanting to lose his target from sight.
He was starting to feel a bit tipsy, this was their fourth club for the evening and he hadn’t had time to eat anything before Sherlock dragged him out on their resent quest. He was bored and out of his element and to top it off, John couldn't even see Sherlock anymore. He scanned the crowd trying to spot his detective, or failing that the man they were trying to locate.
“We can do this all day or you just let me in on this, saving us both time and effort,” John set his jaw; he would not be bullied out of this.
“It makes perfect sense John, you obviously won´t do anything yourself or you would have already. This way we can clear your head and get back to the case. I have done the calculations already; this is the fastest, most rational solution.” He sounded perfectly calm, logical and cool even though it was absolute madness.
John looked at the men and women, they all had the same grim, determined look about them and something in how they held themselves told John they were not police.
Behind him on an identical stretcher dead man number one was lying equally still.
“The building is an old warehouse for an organisation known as
*****
Sherlock swallowed heavily when he recognized his latest suitor.
Getting it over with, Sherlock pushed his pants down where their tight cut caused them to get stuck around his knees.
For some reason, John chose his best jeans and least hideous jumper for their shared breakfast. He knew why, when he saw Sherlock smile at him.
“It’s not fully healed.” The detective replied in a hushed tone before he added ”But it’s soon going to be.” which earned him a fond smile. He felt the slight touch against his skin shift upwards. His breath faltered when a brush of knuckles against his scrotum was accompanied by a shy kiss on his collarbone only to leave him in a rush when John dropped to his knees in front of him.
“Alright, boys. I have a lot of things to do so I'll leave you to it.” She let her hand rest on his shoulder for a second before she took the tray and left.
“What do you see?” John inquired calmly.
“Yes. No one more qualified than me.”
“Oh… It’s not that easy John. I am happy that I will be your first, though. I wasn’t sure that I made the right deduction.” John can’t see what Sherlock is doing but he can imagine it in distinctive clarity. His cock twitches with interest when Sherlock slowly starts to move against his hand.
“Mine.” The word emerged in a deep groan from John’s throat as he walked over to the bed. He knelt between Sherlock’s legs, letting his hands slide up and down the inside of his thighs.
John let out a loud moan that caused a strong wave of arousal, surging through Sherlock’s body.
“You look tired. You should take a nap.” John stated but Sherlock continued to rub his hand against his groin through the fabric of the robe.
“Now. Right. Ok.” He mumbled, trying to mentally prepare.
“So, you don’t want to talk about
Pressing his hands into the smooth fabric covering Sherlock's chest, he broke their contact.
Sherlock hadn’t accounted for it to feel this… intense. Never had he even considered having someone else do this to him. Of course, John. Yes. John. But he had always thought that it would be different. Not as good.
“John?”
Impatient, he let his whole kingdom know that he was willing to pay for new information about the unseen Prince.
“You put it there. Your initials in this suggestive area of my body. I liked the meaning. Even if it had none to you.” He admitted, forcing his voice not to waver.
but only now understood how true that was if you were with the right person.
“Brother, would you be so kind to take a look?” Mycroft asked with a fake smile. Sherlock’s annoyance at still being expected to do the legwork for his pompous git of a brother was obvious.
He was fairly certain that the last urologist thought him to be an exhibitionist who got off on wanking in front of him. That was when John gave up searching for medical advice.
There is an awkward moment of silent tension.
“Go get it. Run! Come down when I call you.” Sherlock said and descended the stairs.
“You seem to know many people in here.” He inquired.
“No, love.” John said, snaking one hand around Sherlock’s shoulder and pulling him upright.
“She must have been very happy when you were born.” John said lamely. “What about Mycroft?”
John sat at the kitchen table looking up, expectantly.  In front of him were various small bowls, containing a selection of their favorite Thai food, and a candle. Lit. Sherlock walked slowly to the other chair, still uncertain about John’s intentions.
“I am always able to think!” Sherlock yelled after him.
“Got any plans today?” The blond asked casually.
Still, he felt as if he misbehaved every time he had to laugh or smile. He shouldn't be feeling good about the situation. He was supposed to grief, wasn't he?
John wanted to explode, he wanted to scream and smash something. He took a very, very deep breath during which he suddenly realized that Sherlock was being the responsible one for once. He smelled a trap but let his breath out in a rush in resignation.
“Mrs. Hudson?” The woman let her head hang down and rubbed the tears from her eyes. “Is it...Are you alright?” John wouldn't have known what to do if it she wasn't.
“What is it? Are you such a wimp that you can’t even take a few insults?” Sherlock was holding his sole attention as the suspect took a step towards him and, therefore, away from John.
“It appears that it only happens when you address me in your mind or are strongly concentrating on me.” Sherlock said, deciding not to mention the insult.
As soon as he had nodded, he felt the singular tentacle retreat from his body and squirm lower. The doctor’s cock pressed against his entrance seconds later, probably supported by the appendix. John watched him wordlessly, his eyes dark with arousal. Sherlock was sure that he offered a similar sight. He was panting open-mouthed, sweat was running down his temples and he already missed the feeling of something moving inside his body. A small whimper escaped him when he felt the insistent press of John’s glans against his already loosened ring of muscles.
“Is it important or can it wait?” John asked, his eyes shining with barely suppressed rage.
When John entered the room, Sherlock had thrown himself dramatically in the middle of his bed. Laying on his side, Sherlock tried for a seductive smile but failed somewhere along the way and kept staring at John’s bare torso, instead. It was so obviously a nervous gesture that the doctor forcefully suppressed the giddy grin that tried to overtake his face.
“My clothes were itching and it’s way too hot in here. The furnace is turned off but… Do we have anything edible?” Sherlock was looking at John expectantly.
Sherlock had been at an absolute loss. When he’d entered the flat it was obvious that John had made up his mind about his attraction to Sherlock and then… Well, then the consulting detective had basically acted on autopilot.
He felt as if all control had deserted him, his sole focus on his own pleasure. John had let himself fall forward, barely catching himself with both arms on either side of Sherlocks head. His harsh breath tickled the skin of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder as he leant down and captured the freckled skin between his teeth and came in drawn out pulses between them.
Sherlock replayed his conversation with Beth over and over again. There was a flaw in her assumption of what would happen. She had told him, that he should get over that one kiss and he would be wiser about John’s feelings towards him. If John would have been opposed, Sherlock would have said that he had been caught up in the moment. Good that John had offered a possible moment the exact same day. Better still, he wasn’t opposed in the least.
“John.” A sigh of contentment and the Consulting Detective slackened in the awkward embrace of his own tentacles.
“Mine.”  He growled and spent himself into the exhausted Omega. Sherlock collapsed onto the floor while John was still kneeling above him.
“If you get the scones we can start.” Rolling his eyes, John decided to get some scones for breakfast.
The background was designed to look like lilac, purple and violet water color splashes but in the middle, adjusted to follow the line of Sherlock’s hip bone, was the chemical structure of...
“Concentre-toi!” There had to be a way out of this. If Sherlock could only focus. But this noise… This horrible knocking…. It’s rhythm had him on edge. He pulled his shoulders up as far as he could in a vain attempt at covering his ears while still protecting his body against the cold.
As she lay between the Nodding Suns enjoying the warm sunshine on her skin, somebody cleared his throat a few meters away. Reluctantly, she opened her eyes and pried into the shadows of the surrounding forest. There, right below a cherry tree stood a good-looking man wearing a half-smirk and looking directly at her. Even though she was intrigued by his pleasant appearance she immediately sat up and gave him a stern look. He excused himself for interrupting whatever she had done and asked if he could join her. Conversation came natural to them. His eyes were gentle and full of humor. Before she knew what was happening she began to plan a future with him but while the love of her life appeared, her gift vanished in the exact same second.
“Yes.” John agreed to the situation as a whole. The detective raised his arms to firmly push them against the wall, giving John more leverage.
He kissed the soft skin at Sherlock’s collarbone before he took a step backwards to regard his naked body. John still couldn’t believe that Sherlock wanted to spend his life with him in this special, intimate way. According to the book, they would develop a connection that would grow stronger with every day they spend together. John could already feel their bond tugging at him whenever there was even a small distance between them. It should have felt awkward but to John it was all he had ever wished for, even before he knew that his body was meant for it.
He was pretty sure something was going on that he didn't know about.
Everything falls into place.
Of course, John would never say so and Sherlock would never admit to it.
“Did you see anybody outside?” Sherlock demanded.
John had always envied his father for his snow-white hair and when his mum told him that his hair had been black the day they met it was impossible for him to imagine. So she explained to him that her tears had turned it white.
“But I saw it, too. Or didn’t. Whatever.” John remarked, lightly probing around the edges of the upper right orifice. Sherlock could feel the doctor’s breath on his skin and goose bumps blooming all over his back.
“Oh no, John! You have been gone for at least 6 hours. The amount of food you brought only explains one of them.” He stated, stepping into the doctor’s personal space and looking down at him. Nonchalant, John put the bags on the counter.
The first thing John was able to make out in the foreign sunlight was the small plane that lay a few meters away from the entrance. At first, he thought it had been squashed between the masses of stones when the earth around them had opened up to set free whatever had the power to just push up from the earth's core. But at second glance he realized that there was no possible explanation for the regular dents in the plane's mantle. None he was willing to imagine anyway, but his brain was only too happy to supply the picture of an enormous claw that yanked the flying object from the sky and crushed it like a paper dart.
“You two look way too happy for what you are about to do. I probably shouldn't allow this.”
“Listen! We both know why you are here. I thought, taking you away from your home and family would be enough to make you cry but apparently I was wrong. You are much more resilient than I thought but, believe me, it won’t take me long to break you. Soon you’ll be crying like a baby!” He was shaking his fist in front of Sherlock’s face, leaving no doubt as to how far he was willing to go. But Sherlock, as he had done since leaving his kingdom, refused to talk. There was no need to waste his intellect on this inferior being.
Hesitantly, John pulled back and looked up into Sherlock’s face. The Consulting Detective’s eyes were closed for a moment longer before he dragged them slowly open and answered John’s questioning gaze. John wasn’t able to keep the happy smile from his face but, raising one brow; he cocked his head to the right and waited for an explanation. He could exactly pinpoint the moment Sherlock tensed and struggled for words.
Swallowing hard and still unable to stop staring into the now deserted well hole, John whispered reverently “Mycroft…. Fuck. Thank you!”.
Waiting for a confirming nod, John began to pull out slowly. A deep groan prompted him to push back in again before his finger was even halfway out.
“The dreams?”
“What?”
“Oh.” He breathed onto an unmarked hip bone. Without remark, Sherlock placed a bottle of lube beside John’s hand.
“Christ, this is horrible…”  The elderly woman muttered. Curious, John peered over Sherlock’s shoulder to see what the fuss was about. Mrs. Hudson sat at her small kitchen table clutching a cup of tea, a dressing gown tied securely around her. Shaking her head she kept staring at a large box covering most of the table’s narrow surface.
A tingling sensation began to spread through his lower back.
Whatever it was he wanted to say, it was drowned out by Sherlock’s loud groan of his name as the tentacle inside him began to squirm restlessly.
Now John felt drained and giddy at the same time. He felt more sure of himself and his abilities not to say his own value for their little group than he'd had in the last months.
John demanded half heartedly before he returned to his diary and Sherlock resumed his show of impatience by rapidly tapping his foot on the linoleum. When the timer hit the one minute mark, Mycroft's and Greg's steps were echoing in the halway.
Sherlock’s hands were running over his back, pressing them even closer together. As John felt his elation slowly turn into passion, he took a step back only to have Sherlock follow him.
“God. Go and take a cold shower!” John ordered in a hoarse voice.
If thou wake, he cannot sleep:
That morning, Sherlock had woken up feeling tense and hot. He claimed to be very close to his heat and demanded that John would fetch a weeks’ worth of food and beverage. John had read that it was unlikely that they would leave the flat during Sherlock’s heat. They would be too occupied, so to say.
This morning wasn’t at all better than the last one. No, it was even worse. John has a hangover of truly epic size, and as if that wouldn’t be enough, he is more than a bit confused over his latest decisions regarding his love life. He slips groaning out of bed, sneaks down the stairs and into the kitchen, where he gathers some bread and jam before fleeing back into his room as silent and fast as possible. He'll need some strength to handle this day and he's still confident to follow through with the rough plan Mike helped him with yesterday.
“I love you, too.” The detective said without turning around before he heard John making his way downstairs.
"You were merely acting like a human being. OK... yes, you have a point. I know it wasn't easy for you but I would be thankful if you could just keep that up for another 11 minutes and 24 seconds." He pulled out the chair besides him from under the table and looked at Sherlock expectantly.
He hissed, staring furiously at the ground.
In his frustration, Sherlock closed his eyes and shut everything else out. He revised all the available data. The state of the carriage. The reaction of Prince James’ inferiors when they first saw him. The 12 jokes and 4 “dramas” he had to listen to. The fact that he’d never heard of James before a few months ago.
And that was exactly how Sherlock found him now. Kneeling on his bed and thrusting three fingers slowly in and out. John was sweating heavily. With half lidded eyes and unsteady breaths he held one hand out towards Sherlock, silently asking him to come closer.
“John, I …. Can I do it again?” Sherlock couldn’t keep the pleading tone out of his voice but John didn’t seem to notice.
“Very eloquent, John.” Sherlock muttered while turning fully towards him.
John filled the caddy in record time. The thought that Sherlock was alone at home, weakened and tense, made John agitated. He imagined a dozen scenarios in which Sherlock accidentally fell, had a sudden stroke because of his bodies state or even got attacked by another Alpha. John knew that all his visions were highly unlikely and comforted himself with the knowledge that it was only his Alpha-brain telling him to stay close to Sherlock and protect him.
When he entered the examination room, John felt extremely nervous. Doctor Rosen gave him a reassuring look that John knew too well from all the times he himself had used it on his patients.
“Soldier on.”
He had spent long minutes in his room, dwelling on his mistakes, when he decided to accept his new (old) place in life and went downstairs.
The other found it's way around the lean back while John was filled with relief and elation. And pride. So much pride at finally having found the strength to be true to himself and the world.

“Then you are mine and I am yours, at least until my heat is over.” Sherlock said happily before he walked over to the drawer with the take away leaflets.
“John, please!” He whimpered in agony.
Instantly, he had called for Sherlock.
ps. Even though this story is finished as it is, I'll probably add another porn chapter because I can and I want to.
Sherlock came to kneel over John, his legs on either side of John's thighs. The doctor entertained the idea of pulling him down and pressing their cocks together, to align them in a tight grip and feel their silky drag before coming wetly between them.
This night, Sherlock was too agitated to sleep. His rips hurt and his left cheekbone also hummed with pain. Reverently, he took his violin out of its case and played, longingly looking out of the window towards his former home.
He dried himself efficiently while he worked out a bulletproof plan.
“I don’t know actually. Might be just you and me. Well, and John. After all, we were the ones closest to it’s source.” Sherlock elaborated.
And Sherlock hadn’t even planned it. Hadn’t accounted for a shared partiality for possessive behaviour. The choice of location on his body had, admittedly, been influenced by the position it would make John have to be in. And it had been a delicious torture to suppress his physical reactions to the close proximity of the doctor’s face and touch.
“You know what they say. God lives in every single one of us and, surprisingly, whoever said that was right. We are the Old Gods. At least, we turned into them.” Sherlock drawled, appearing as if he’d just explained the color of the sky to a four year old.
20 minutes later, Lestrade was hauling the man off and John agreed that they would give their statements the next day, as always. Sherlock pulled him towards the direction of Bakerstreet to show him exactly how pleased he was about the way they had wound up this case.
“Yes, yes he did. And I am really sorry. I hope you know that I never meant…”
“Yes….” Sherlock hissed, letting his head dangle between his upper arms.
“The two of us against the rest of the world. As it should be.” Sherlock agreed, giving him a brief kiss before leaning back and opening his door. “Let's go home.”
******
“You're absolutely right.” He had a hard time getting a grip on his arousal as he let himself be pulled up from the couch.
It was not very difficult to analyse his dream. Even though it got less and less palpable while John was typing down the unrealistic actions and events, he was still able to relive the emotions.
In contrast to the annoyed muttering he had expected, John entered the kitchen only to find another set breakfast table.
“Could be better.”
“Your parents are very fond of their grandson, aren’t they?” Sherlock asked conversationally. With wide eyes, the suspect nodded at him before averting his gaze.
John saw all these things but they were of no interest to him. The only thing he paid attention to was the astonished look on Sherlock’s face and the slow lick of lips it accompanied.
“Alone.” Sherlock mumbled, not actually sure he would be able to stay upright but completely certain that he didn’t want John to help him. Cautiously he forced his spine to stiffen and his knees to tense while he pushed past John. Stumbling, he entered the bathroom and fell back against its door.
Partly due to his parent’s dysfunctional marriage and early death in a gruesome fire, but mostly because of the separation from his sister at the age of ten, when both of them had been adopted by different families, John’s childhood had ended early. He never talked about the long time in which he hadn’t seen Harry. He knew that even this minor family drama wasn’t something special, though. (Even though the only things he could remember about his parents were alcohol induced arguments that still made him cringe with fear.)  His only happy childhood memory was the small stream behind their cottage, where he had tried to catch tiddlers with his hands, while his sister sat laughing in the grass watching him.
Fortunately, Sherlock didn't need to be told. As they were walking up the stairs, he was carefully reading John's posture and facial expression, his gaze flickering over the tense body.
Still uncertain about the outcome of this encounter, Sherlock let his shirt fall open.
He got up testily, starting to pace the length of their living room.
He paced up and down the living room wondering if he should repeat his approach with the exclamation mark. He muttered to himself and the various skulls surrounding him. John knew it would be a failure to act so obvious. More obvious then he had already been acting, anyway. Once in a while he stopped in his tracks to yell at Fortinbras, the one human skull he had left sitting on the mantelpiece. He was worried about the long time that had passed without a note. He worried for his Pilgrim.
“Listen Sherlock. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have fallen asleep in your bed.”
“Yes, I think!” Sherlock’s voice was lacking the frustration that he felt deep inside.
*****
“What do you need? Say it, Sherlock.” John demanded, his voice thick with lust.
angry that he used her and his newly found domesticity to punish Sherlock for abandoning him.
Sebastian shoved him hard to the floor before he kicked him violently in the guts and stomped from the room.
“Tell me! Is there any place where you could convert it into cash or are you just terrifyingly stupid?
Sherlock seemed to need some space and so did John.
“Alright?” Sherlock’s voice was strained. He was clearly struggling for control.
John walked down the stairs, muttering to himself while clenching and unclenching his hands in frustration. “What?”
John was out there. John, who had had the shock of his live just now with the small glimpse of Sherlock’s mind he’d gotten.
When John crossed the living room to get some clothes from his room, Sherlock lay motionless and stark naked on the couch. The doctor couldn’t stop himself from taking a blanket and placing it over him. Less out of worry for his health then for Mrs. Hudson’s.
When Sherlock emerges the next morning, he feels exhausted and wary. John will come around, eventually. He knows it. Has to believe it in order to keep the façade. John will find out for himself and everything will be just fine. Hopefully.
He cautiously looked around before he straightened up and allowed himself to think of home.
Before John had the chance to panic and kick in the bathroom door, Sherlock stepped out of his room. He was still looking somewhat rumpled but some color had started to return to his face and he had changed into a faded shirt and pyjama pants. Relieved, John put the tray down on the kitchen table and made to prepare a strong Earl Grey for both of them.
“Do you…Do you want me to?” His voice was almost a whisper now, barely audible to Sherlock even at their close proximity.
“Got it in three.”
“John….Hurry!” The Omega demanded impatiently.
John was moaning constantly now, his eyes closed, he began frantically working his own cock until Sherlock batted his hand away.
Only when he’d had to make a conscious decision in taking John’s hand he’d suddenly come back to himself.
John wasn’t sure how much to trust Sean in a situation his life might depend on but he knew Sherlock would already have had one or two thoughts on his ability to keep panic at bay.
“I am not going to ask you again. I will find him with or without your help. This is getting rather boring. So I am going to make this a bit more interesting for the both of us.”  Sherlock knew what Moriarty’s idea of entertainment contained. The hairs on his neck stood on end when he imagined the possibility of John being irreversibly injured or even….
“No. No leftovers. Sherlock? Why are you naked?” John tried to will the arousal out of his voice.
“You’ve risked both our lives many times without knowing if you’re right.” There was no anger or accusation in John’s voice so Sherlock only held his gaze. “You know him better than anybody else, right?” Sherlock nodded cautiously. “Well…?” The expectant expression was familiar on the Doctor’s face.
“Perfect. Yes, perfect.” He agrees, panting.
He supplied lamely before he jumped up from the chair and retreated hastily up into his room.
It had been a long time since John's last blog entry and his typing had certainly not improved since then. He felt as if every sentence had to be rewritten four times until he got it right and his mind was fumbling with broken pieces of experiences he had never even made.
But if you really need more than there is, I give you this much:
“So? Why are you hiding in here? Not that I don’t enjoy your presence…” Sherlock liked seeing John’s face as open and attentive as it was right now. Liked the fact that he didn’t have to lie to John.
“Where is Bill?” John groaned out, fixing his eyes on Moriarty’s.
Before the startled man could react, he had already pushed him onto his back and was straddling him.
“Oh, and I thought
“I come and get you, John.” He whispered, breathlessly.
“I am not an epidemiologist. I can only assume that Phillips’ body fell into the water and spread whatever he caught through it.”
“Duck in lemon sauce for me, please.” He sighed as he dropped onto the couch. “Thank you.” He added with a smile.
Sherlock frowned, nodding in understanding. “I know. Maybe I am, what people call, clingy.”
Sherlock's cheekbones coloured even more. From a soft exhilarated rosé to a full blown scarlet as his tongue flicked over the plush lips. John watched it all. Watched as the heated gaze was dragged upwards with noticeable effort.
Hamlet (Act II, Sc. II).
John sat down at the kitchen table examining his so called breakfast. Biscuits, toast and olives where on one side of the table all placed on the same plate beside a glass of jam. Another plate held all sorts of crackers and chips while the one closest to him was stuffed with greenish looking bacon.
Mycroft’s disgruntled look of approval and Martha’s worried expression did nothing to slow Sherlock down as he entered the reception area through a broken glass door.
“Come one. We should go in and change.” John suggested as casual as possible, while he held his hand out for Sherlock to take. After a few agonizing seconds, Sherlock quietly took his hand and followed him inside. John didn’t even attempt to wipe the grin off his face.
“But…”
“John.” Sherlock said in a commanding voice. “Breath! I was just not expecting you to… be willing to…”
And not trying to stop Sherlock from leaving him again. At least as far as he knew. He suspected that he had probably been trying to convince the consulting detective to stay but he couldn't remember what he'd planned to whisper. He didn't have the slightest idea, especially because he could distinctly remember being at an absolute loss when they were shaking hands.
Leaning down, he pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s neck before he moved to the side to lick at the bond mark. Sherlock’s body shuddered at the touch and a low moan left his throat.
He pressed one leg between Sherlock’s thighs, forcing them apart. His hard arousal was brushing the Omega’s limb and it sent a shiver down his groin. Crouching deeper and releasing Sherlock's wrists, John licked the crease between the Omega's thigh and prick. Tenderly, he sucked on the skin off Sherlock’s scrotum, tugging at it with his lips.
In his haze, John barely managed to roll to his side and press against the sleepy consulting detective. He felt one arm coming to rest around his waist
Lightning brightened the sky over Baker Street as the rain ran over John’s face and dripped from his lashes onto his cheeks. Sherlock’s lips moved languidly against his, catching his lower lip and sucking lightly.
He knelt down beside him, spreading the oil in his hands while giving John's body a visual once-over.
When the consulting detective came back into the parlor, his shirt open down to his belly button and a big smudge of lipstick on his cheek, John knew it.
“Didn’t look.” He said with a dismissive flick of his hand.
Even though he was hungry, John didn’t go down for the rest of the day. He didn’t dare to.
He worked his way up to one knee, than changed to the other ankle to repeat the treatment.
A wave of affection rolled through John and elicited a soft sigh. He instinctively knew that it was the bond, letting him share what Sherlock felt.
Weeks went by without John asking Sherlock for help. Not that he didn’t wank. No. He was fairly certain that he was onto the best way to destroy every last brain cell with his abnormal frequency. He just hadn't found the bravery to approach Sherlock with his hard cock in one hand and his mind in the gutter.
When he finally left the surgery, John made his way to the tube station under the hot, burning sun. He stopped for an ice cone and watched the people that were walking by. He felt as if he knew something they didn’t. As if he was happier than everyone else. Surely, he knew that there still were a few obstacles to overcome. Telling Sherlock, for example. But he refused to worry about that. It had been a long time since he had felt that strong for anyone and he was just happy that he was still able to feel that way. He had doubted it, actually.
He dragged his nails over Sherlock's side leaving scratch marks that stood out harshly against the milky skin.
“I’ve been waiting so long, John. So long.” He repeats the motion, deliberately lowering his groin further so that their cocks are almost aligned.
what Sherlock found odd but also freeing. He found it much harder to think when John was in the same room, nowadays.
Sherlock balled his hands into fists closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“I think we are still evolving.” John stated, pointing a finger at his head before touching Sherlock’s temple with it. The detective froze in front of him. Towel hanging forgotten from his hand he asked himself if John really meant what he thought he did.
“Oh God, Sherlock, you are amazing, beautiful, wonderful, gorgeous….” John muttered under his breath as his thrusts turned more and more erratic and he finally came, buried deep in his lover.
If two people decide to wait for the other to act first, what happens is… nothing.
What he’d seen right then…
“I am glad.” He admitted. “I am glad that you weren't there when I woke up and I am glad that there never was a baby you could have burdened me with.” Guilt was nagging at him but he felt he had to go on.”I don't know what I thought. You were
He was fumbling through his memories but came up blank when Sherlock appeared in his line of sight.
John inhaled Sherlock’s scent. It was already changing and he supposed his own was too. Soon, they would smell nearly the same. John almost regretted that there were no other Alpha’s out there who would recognize their bond and know that Sherlock was his.
"OK. I'd say we go to the houses closest to us. Tomorrow we can go out earlier but today we should keep it short and safe." Sherlock nodded at him and pulled his hand away.
John. It didn’t escape him that he was a Watson too but this fact didn’t interest him in the slightest. He was a Prince himself and that, as well, meant nothing to him.
“Deduce it!” John prompted amused before he pushed himself up using both hands on Sherlock’s knees. “I’ll be here if you need me.”
The consulting detective knelt in front of him and let his thumb press into John’s scar before closing his hand over the doctor’s shoulder and pulling him forward for a shy but languid kiss.
“I think that's enough.” He said to John, resolutely.
Sherlock had expected to find the wife’s lover in their secret apartment where he would, no doubt, be packing to leave London as soon as possible. Unfortunately, they ran directly into the still angry and murderous husband, who was seeking revenge even after his wife was already “punished” .
Several seconds of silence had John imagining a stare off between the two until he heard Mrs. Hudson's barely suppressed shriek “Oh… Oh… I'm so happy for you two.” followed by a smooching sound that made John laugh as he imagined Sherlock's faked annoyance.
of March, 3 days after their trip to Japan, John found himself in Sherlock’s room. The Detective was lying curled up in the middle of his ridiculously large bed, his head pushed back with sweat running down his chest before oozing into the sheets, dressing gown pants sticky and rumpled. The doctor regarded the feverish body, considering his weight and the clarity of bones underneath the flushed skin. Sherlock groaned in his sleep, discomfort showing on his face. A few hours before, John had already taken his temperature but doing it again was a very tempting idea at the sight of a suffering Consulting Detective. At first, he had thought that Sherlock was exaggerating, still frustrated by visiting Shikoku to no avail. But when the genius had stopped complaining and slept the better part of the day, John remembered the incision. And if he was honest with himself, john didn’t feel very well either but his own indisposition blurred in the face of the Detective’s ailment. Sherlock didn’t even wake up when the doctor pushed the dressing gown aside to take a look at the wound.  There were no signs of blood poisoning. The skin around it was looking healthy, almost more so then the rest of Sherlock’s thigh. So John just dragged him into a sitting position and slowly managed to move him over to his room. Every now and then, the Doctor sat at Sherlock’s bedside and took his pulse or instilled some water into him. This time, he had only come out of a sense of
Even in his sleep, Sherlock’s hand repeatedly wandered to his groin. John sat on a chair that he had place right beside the couch, where he patiently stopped the Omega from masturbating unconsciously. One hand, though, was constantly cradling Sherlock’s head, playing with the soft curls and massaging the scalp. Every time John interfered with Sherlock’s subconscious attempt on self-pleasure, the Consulting Detective groaned in frustration but he didn’t wake up.
Carefully, he pulled his fingers out and spread the remaining liquid over his erection. Sherlock groaned when he stopped stroking him soon after.
With a smirk he said “Both.” and earned a smile in response.
“So, how can we help you?” Sherlock asked, coming to stand beside John’s chair and placing a hand in his neck. Lestrade’s eyes flicked from one to the other several times before he relaxed into the couch and nodded to himself.
The hand in his hair tightened when he used his nimble fingers to press against John’s perineum. Research really did always help.
Blushing despite himself, John pushed the left sleeve up to reveal a black and grey tattoo on the inside of his forearm.
“Leicester.” He mumbled in defeat.
“Awoke who?” Sherlock asked calmly. “Did you actually see any gods on your way here?”
“Come back to me, Sherlock!” John said worriedly before pressing a hesitant kiss onto the madman’s temple.
The next day, Sherlock spent in silence and solitude. He had managed to convince his chambermaid to bring him books and tobacco. Every now and then he peered though the key hole of his door but he couldn’t find out when (if) the change of guards happened. He was quite content that he would be able to stand the situation as long as it would take Prince Sebastian to finally give up. Sherlock was determined not to cry whatever he might try.
“Sherlock, I…there is something on my….It’s worrying me. Would you please just…take a look?”
She pulled a crumpled pack of tissues from her leather purse in a vain attempt to wipe them away. Her wedding ring sparkled in the evening light that fell through the closest window.
He felt Sherlock relax under his hands. Eagerly participating in the kiss that was so very overdue. A warm feeling was spreading through his chest when John felt the first touch of nimble fingers against his neck. The simple movement of lips, brushing and winding against one another, innocent and unhurried, made his heart clench.
Experimentally, John pounded into the heat of Sherlock’s body. Once. Twice.
Sherlock's arms tightened around his back when he felt hard flesh pulse against his shaft.
“Come on, Sherlock!” John whispered into the mumbling man’s ear. “Listen!”  Cross-legged on the floor, he was pressing his shoulder into the detective’s chest and tapping urgently against the hand he had pulled onto his thigh.
For the last four hours the Consulting Detective had been walking back and forth between the automatic door and the common room. The countdown on the ridiculously vast display had just hit the 12 minute mark and John's own excitement could barely be contained.
*****
“Don't worry, it's not going to happen again.” John vaguely promised as he fled the room to get dressed.
He positions himself above John’s leaking prick, holding it so the head is pushing against his loosened entrance.
“I am an angry man, Mary. I thought I had accepted that a long time ago but… Yes. This time it is my fault. But all the things you made me feel bad about… Running away from you for the cases, for Sherlock. The things I didn't tell you. You knew I didn't love you and you never… you never loved me, either. No. You...YOU HATED ME.” His voice sounded menacing, even to his own ears. “I see it now. And now, I also see what you were trying to achieve. You
“What is it, Sherlock? What am I missing? There must be something wrong about me.”
Sherlock’s eyes shot open. It felt as if his tentacles were being pulled away from his back one by one. John’s look of concentration told him all he had to know. He immediately wanted to close his eyes again. He couldn’t stand the intensity of their closeness. Not only that he had never felt anything like this before but he also had never had any sexual contact in the context of a shared emotion. Surely, sex had been an object of his studies for a short time in his youth but he quickly condemned it when he noticed that it just wasn’t possible for him to achieve an orgasm. It shocked him now how acute his own arousal felt in John’s presence. With John touching him where he hadn’t touched himself in years.
John drew an exclamation mark on the living room window.
“You are astonishing like this, Sherlock.” John’s voice sounded reverently.
“Not really, no.” The understatement was evident by the way he held very still under John’s touch while the tip of the tentacle wound itself around the doctor’s finger.
John shoved all the way in, watching Sherlock’s face to see it contort with pleasure. Smiling, he pulled a bit back before he pushed in harder.
Sherlock was definitely behaving strange. Too interested. Too affectionate. Too... friendly.
after all, John lay back on his front in the middle of the bed. The rustle of clothing told him that he hadn't severely miscalculated the outcome of this endeavour.
“I am too tired to indulge in your explorations of not being gay.” Sherlock had already taken his usual position on the couch and closed his eyes. He didn’t move a muscle or even have the decency to look at John.
“I don’t know.” John said, creasing his brows.
Rosen made a noncommittal sound and gestured for him to go on.
The loud bang from the bathroom prompted John to hurry up the stairs, carefully balancing the tray with sandwiches he had begged Mrs. Hudson to prepare. Of course, there hadn’t been much begging necessary. It had been particularly difficult to convince her of staying downstairs for the rest of the evening, though.
*****
Before he could make up his mind, John answered with a decisive “Yes.”.
Sherlock had often planned to delete this knowledge but he never did, partly because he quite fancied Shakespeare but mostly because John did too. They argued about the skull's name now and then, and Sherlock never admitted that he envied John for the idea.
According to Beth, they would take the next step in their relationship, soon after. But she was wrong. Annoyingly so. She had told him to wait until he was ready to have his first attempt at gay sex and Sherlock could only assume that that was the reason why John didn’t come on to him. Sherlock had had sex before and it had been with a man each time. One time it even god close to being good. Although, it hadn’t been satisfying, Sherlock had always known that he wasn’t interested in women. He had kissed a woman once, or was kissed by her, and realized that he needed different physical attributes to even want to give sex a try.
“Are there now some leftovers or are there not?” Sherlock asked, turning around to face John who was gaping at him and fighting the urge to open his jeans to relief some tension.
“Licking! You are… licking your lips.” Sherlock stated awkwardly.
“It’s beginning again.” He said to no one in particular. Lestrade nodded and took a seat on the floor. John furrowed his brows at him when he felt the first tremor in his feet.
or something like that?” Sherlock asked .
John let the information sink in before he added “We are under attack.”.
“None of your business.” Sherlock said, getting up and taking his coat off of the chairs backrest. When the DI didn’t press on, something occurred to Sherlock and he eyed him suspiciously.
John felt rather than saw Sherlock noticing the moment he was fully seated insight him. Tension was leaving him momentarily and a shudder ran down his thighs. Bending forward for a kiss, John pushed Sherlock’s legs up against his chest at the same time. Softly, he captured the full lips between his own before pressing a peck on a flushed cheek bone.
“Sherlock!” He screamed when he spent himself inside the Omega. He was still kneeling with Sherlock toppled over him, resting his head on John’s shoulder, while the aftershocks rippled through his body.
