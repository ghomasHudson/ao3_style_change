Tony rolled his head to the side—she was sitting in a chair by his bed—how had he not noticed her before? She was too quiet. He knew she was a trained assassin, but she didn’t need to sneak up on him. Not when he was stuck in a hospital bed, no less.
Tony had only been up in the penthouse for a handful of seconds—they could hear his bickering with Pepper over the comms—and thankfully Steve had captured Carol’s attention before she was all the way up top. He knew Carol was giving Tony just a bit of space to assess the situation of his home and family and it had worked out to his benefit as well.
“Eeveeee,” Vee trilled out happily, her tail sashaying. She hopped up and over to the others, talking to them. Morgan was the first one to approach Steve, a little warily, and Steve got down to one knee.
"Manuel is the rat that lives in your hallway, he's the brother of Joan, who was caught in the trap last month." Every time Tony went to visit them, which was roughly 3 times a month, there was a new trap out, and there was a new rat caught in the trap. "I swear, the cockroaches at the door, they spoke to me last week. They spoke Russian. They were talking about moving out as well."
"I know, I have it framed." Mary grinned and Tony couldn't help but laugh. "Is Steve prepared for this?" She motioned towards the table that was starting to fill up with food.
As Tony adjusted Steve's arms to properly hold the girl, she almost immediately stopped. Tony hummed under his breath, watching them. He was struck by how good Steve looked with a baby in his arms. He was looking back down at her, a sense of awe in his expression, like he couldn't believe that something as precious as this life existed in the world. It was soft and open, and Tony couldn't help but think a little vulnerable.
"How desperate am I? You threaten my world with war. You steal a force you can't hope to control." Fury was putting his name to use. "You talk about peace, and you kill because it's fun. You have made me very desperate. You might not be glad that you did."
"Has she told you anything about her ex?" Steve asked, and Tony furrowed his brows, shaking his head.
Steve would have to wait another two weeks or so before he was able to get a shot at meeting Tony. Tony scowled at his phone when he saw the text from Mary, saying that Peter would be over at Steve's, and that Coulson had picked her up early. Tony couldn't get away from a meeting with the Board, not if he wanted to get his project off the ground this month. He had a plan, and he wanted it to open this year, and Tony Stark doesn't like to settle for second best.
“I think everyone knows you two need to fuck out your problems, so don’t pull the paragon of pure American ideals with me, Rogers,” Rhodey replied. “Just—go in there and figure this shit out. It’s breaking my heart to see Tones moping around like this.”
“Here, you look like you need a drink,” Nat said, shoving a cocktail of some sort into Steve’s hands.
He stared up at the ceiling—the pounding in his head paled in comparison to the hurt in his heart.  The problems in his life seemed to have endless layers—and each day he was peeling back another layer and learning something new about the root cause of it all.
Steve never resented Tony after Siberia—he resented himself. Before the Time Heist was put into motion he and Tony had reconciled—or so he thought—but Tony’s comment yesterday afternoon proved otherwise. He supposed that made sense—they did not really apologize or discuss what happened, because it was time to get to work and maybe some toxic masculinity got in the way, too.
“Tony,” Nat warned this time, giving him a stern look and doing her best to communicate that this was a horrible idea.
“You’re a fantastic father to Morgan. You’re an amazing friend and teammate to all of us here. You’re there for every single person in your life at the drop of a hat. Are you a stubborn and sassy pain in the ass? Of course, but that’s part of why we love you,” she laughed.
“Tony,” Steve whispered. “I know what you’re thinking. And you’re wrong. God—you’re so wrong. I love you. I’ve loved you for as long as I can remember. I love every bit about you.” He reached down and grabbed Tony’s hands, bringing his knuckles to his lips and kissing them. “I love your hands. I love your hands and the amazing things they create.”
“God—yeah. Could probably outlast you and your serum,” Tony laughed. “Peter thinks I invite him over because I like him—jokes on him, I’m using him to tire Morgan out.”
“Oh, you know—Harry Potter,” but when Steve looked confused, Tony startled. “Wait—how have I not shown you this yet? You haven’t seen any of the Harry Potters?!”
“Sharon,” he replied flatly. “I’ve been uh—nevermind. Anyway, Buck thought it might be a good idea to give it one last try. I needed a distraction. I know that sounds bad—anyway, we couldn’t make it work. Again.” He shrugged. “We’re still good friends.”
“It is now,” Nat replied, kicking off her heels and cozying up on the other side of Steve. Rhodey sat on the other side of Tony, draping his arm around him, and kicking his feet up on the ottoman.
“You need me to show you the way out, buddy?” Steve asked, stepping closer to Ty while standing as tall as he could. Suddenly, the width of his shoulders and the bulk of his muscles was beyond intimidating.
“Absolutely not,” Tony snapped, holding up a finger. “She guessed your secret superhero identity and you only kissed her after damn near dying, and getting her killed, and that’s the bullshit that only happens in movies. You don’t know anything.”
“So, how’d the meeting go?” Nat asked, leaning against the wall while Tony beat the life out of the punching bag.
Steve just laughed. “I’m not gonna apologize for looking at the most beautiful person in the world.”
He could feel Steve’s arousal hard against his own and based on the way Steve was shuddering into their kiss, Tony assumed he could, too. Finally, Tony broke away gasping for air, having significantly less lung capacity than a super soldier. He looked up at Steve, who happened to look absolutely debauched with swollen lips and pupils blown wildly wide—it was single handedly the most gorgeous thing Tony had ever seen.
Tony jumped a bit and dropped the tool he was holding, but kept his back to Steve, frozen. A few moments passed before Tony stood up straight and spun around on his heel to face him directly. He had a look of utter defiance on his face, lips pulled tight, and eyes narrowed.
Steve scrubbed his hands over his face, already exasperated by Natasha’s prying, but she was one of his dearest friends. She was essentially his sister—he knew she cared—and so he was willing to have this insufferable conversation with her.
“You look really happy,” Peter said, breaking through Tony’s thoughts. “Not—not that you have looked really miserable or anything lately. But you look really, genuinely happy right now. And that makes me happy.”
“Better late than never, right? That’s the bullshit saying?” Tony said, weakly laughing. “For what it’s worth, I accept your apology too, Cap. I forgive you.”
“What are you two up to?” he asked, trying to steal a glance at what was on the screen but Tony contorted his body away from him to keep it hidden.
“God, Tony—yeah of course,” Steve replied, shifting in his seat to be angled towards Tony. “That’s exactly why I’m tense. I want this so badly I’m afraid of messing it up, because this is the single most important thing in the universe to me.”
“Oh,” Steve frowned, but then broke out into the most radiant smile Tony had ever seen. “I didn’t mean to get ahead of your super secret plan, shellhead.”
“No—what? No I’m not. Why would I be nervous? This is like…my billionth Stark Industries Gala,” he huffed, looking up at her with widened eyes.
“Tony, not everyone stays in love forever. You’ve said it before, Pepper fell out of love too, and none of that falls on only one person. You two are co-parenting beautifully. Your friendship is intact. You’ll always love each other, maybe not the way you intended, and that’s okay.”
“I’ll be back,” Steve said, walking over to the door and grabbing his black bomber jacket off the coat rack.
A shaky gasp escaped Steve’s lips as their erections brushed together. Tony relished seeing him like this—Steve Rogers, the man who usually had a tight lid on himself, being completely undone. It was mesmerizing.
“One of us has to accept a damn apology, Rogers,” Tony laughed, blinking away the tears in his eyes.
Every time he began thinking about his marriage and his daughter it sent him into a dangerous and dark spiral. He had been late to picking up Peter tonight because he and Pepper had gotten into it over the phone beforehand. And god, the kid had flawlessly and selflessly covered for him when they got to the compound. Peter continued to surprise him.
“Tones, I’ve hated that guy forever. Back in college all he did was use and abuse you for sex and popularity.”
He poured himself a cup of coffee and walked over, sitting in an armchair, crossing his legs and draping an arm over the back of the chair. Tony took a long, loud, sip of his coffee. When no one said anything, he raised his eyebrows so high they nearly disappeared into his hair.
“Peter—its good to see you. I didn’t know you were coming,” Tony said, pulling out of the hug and looking down at the teen suspiciously.
The next couple of hours were filled with Steve giving Morgan countless piggy-back rides and swinging her around. At some point Nat and Wanda left, but Tony was not sure when, because he was entirely captivated by watching Steve play with his daughter. Their bond was instantaneous and natural, despite Steve having only seen Morgan a few times prior.
He actively decided to ignore the swirl of anxious energy Steve’s purposeful gaze gave him just seconds earlier.
“This is the part where you get to shut the fuck up, Stone. What you did is vile—disgusting—something only the most morally depraved people do. You blackmailed a man you claim to love—a man who has saved your ass more times than anyone can count. Someone who has been so generous with you, you could never repay him. And the worst part—this is only a small drop in the bucket of all the abuse you’ve put him through all these years,” Steve snarled. He wasn’t yelling, but he had mastered the art of being menacing without raising his voice.
She took a noisy bite of her bagel, pretending to be reading her book and letting the silence stretch out again. Steve knew what she was doing—maybe she was trying to be clever or she knew Steve knew and wanted to drive him up the wall.
“Tony—we are friends. Teammates. You’re allowed to talk about your feelings,” he chuckled. The slight blush that dusted Tony’s cheeks was alarmingly satisfying.
“To be fair, you have a lot of sex,” Steve bargained. “Because you two live together. It’s not like when we were touring and you only got some once a month, if you were lucky—“
“Well, we are glad you’ve agreed! Sam and I did our due diligence and already checked in with some other members of the team. Sadly, besides us here in the room, Thor and Bruce are the only two who will be able to make it—everyone else either has plans or off-world duties,” Scott was vibrating with excitement, the human embodiment of a puppy being presented with new toys. “We can’t wait! Tomorrow night—we decorate the Christmas tree we have coming in. Be there or be square!”
Tony stumbled back, pulling Steve along with him, trying to make it over to his bed. Steve got the picture and lifted Tony off his feet which caused a yelp to escape the brunette’s mouth.
“Another thing Tony—nothing about you is selfish. In fact, you’re one of the most selfless men I’ve ever met. And it breaks my heart that you’ve bought into the headlines the tabloids run about you or what your worst enemies think. You give and you give and you give—and even when you run out of things to give, you create more to give.”
He could not give Tony the types of things most people could. Steve was not rich—so no fancy dates or expensive cars as gifts were an option. Steve was not well-connected—Captain America was—so he could not sneak them into a fully booked restaurant. And these were the types of things Tony had seemingly enjoyed before leaving Steve at a loss of what to do.
“I know—it’s okay, Tony. But I’m really not the one you should apologize to. You need to talk to Steve.”
“You’re kidding me right?” Bucky chuckled, but when Tony looked clueless he continued. “Ohhh, you really don’t know, do you? Steve thinks the world of you.”
“Oh no—you and Pepper are going to double team me, aren’t you? And not in the way I would like you to, either,” Tony whined. But he had clearly given up, as he rolled out of bed and stretched his arms over his head. Steve got out of bed and walked over to him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist and kissing him on the cheek several times. “You know, you’re not making it any easier for me to leave, Rogers.”
And now, as he stood there watching these robots fall apart from even Nat’s lightest touches, he realized he had made a grave error.
He clapped a firm hand on Steve’s back and looked down at him, eyebrow raised, and that shit eating grin still on his face. Steve groaned because he knew his friends—his family—were going to be the death of him.
“You mean to tell me the hottest piece of ass in America isn’t getting laid?” Tony asked. “Well, we will absolutely have to solve that.”
He sat at the kitchen island on a barstool, head in his hands, rotating between seething with anger and openly weeping. Images of the arguments between his mother and father haunted his memory—seeing Howard throw empty beer bottles and shout while his mom wept—it had a lasting impact on him.
Of course she knew. He let out another shaky breath and she withdrew her hands from his face, sitting back on her heels in front of him. When he opened his eyes the intensity of her gaze made him want to flinch away. But he didn’t.
Tony had a secondary, top-secret workshop built in the compound for dire situations like this. Only he, Rhodey, and obviously Friday, knew the location of this workshop. It was hidden away behind walls that didn’t look like doors.
In a perfect world, Steve would pick Tony up, wrap him in a blanket, and make all his fears and doubts about his ability as a friend, a father, and an Avenger disappear. He wished he could be the soothing balm to Tony’s aching and wounded heart. It was not until this morning that he realized just how much seeing Tony fall apart, alone in the kitchen with a nearly empty bottle of scotch, affected him.
Steve plopped down on the picnic blanket and moved Morgan to sit in his lap. He reached for an apple and took a large bite out of it.
“Because for a majority of the time you’ve known Steve, you’ve been in a relationship with Pepper. And you wouldn’t dare cheat on her. So, you’ve assumed your crush was just your usual flirtatious behavior,” Rhodey explained. “Which is entirely fair and plausible. But as a recent divorcee, your options are open again and you can’t play dumb anymore.”
“You’re beautiful, Steve Rogers,” Tony said, smiling up at him as their naked bodies finally slotted together. “And that blush only makes you more so.”
One evening in particular, the first Friday of December, Scott and Sam gathered the Avengers together in the living room to announce that this year there would be a Christmas party.
When they got home they changed into pajamas before planting themselves on the living room couch. Just as Steve returned to the room with a cup of tea for Tony, Nat, Sam, Bucky, Rhodey and Thor came bumbling in from the gala.
Steve paced back and forth for several moments—the anxious energy buzzing throughout his body and preventing him from focusing. Finally, he plopped himself down on the edge of Bucky’s bed and fidgeted with his hands in his lap. When he looked up, Bucky had resorted to leaning against the wall with his arms crossed—patiently waiting.
The next two weeks dragged on by as everyone did their best to secretly purchase presents for their Secret Santa. Tony and Steve continued a delicate dance around each other after their intense moment on the couch. For the most part they effectively avoided one another—but when that was not an option, they shared knowing glances and seemed to be physically drawn towards each other. They exchanged soft touches on the arms, shoulders, and always ended up sitting side by side on the couch during Family Time.
Steve tucked and rolled, using the momentum to propel himself forward to Tony, shield held out to protect both of their bare bodies.
“God—Tony’s favorite movie is this, Tony showed me that, did you know Tony’s new project is this,” Bucky imitated, his voice going up several octaves. “I know more about you than I’ve ever wanted to.”
“What—yeah, of course, yes! Go ahead,” he responded, gesturing to the only clean surface in the room, a desk a few feet across from where Tony was working. “Make yourself at home, Cap.”
The way he loved Peter had not been something he ever imagined for himself—truth be told, he had never wanted kids when imaging what his life would look like. He did not want to become his father—god, he didn’t—and he decided kids probably didn’t fit in with his lifestyle anyway. And then he found Peter, and he never expected to love him so deeply, but he did. And then Pepper got pregnant—they had not even been trying—but it felt right at the time. And Morgan was born and Tony could never imagine a life without her after.
“Man, he came spilling his guts to me when he apologized to me the other day,” he said. “I know way more than you think. Also, an idiot could notice the way Tony stares at you helplessly whenever you aren’t looking. Well, actually, he does it when you are looking, too.”
Steve stood there, just inside the room, still as a statue and unsure of how to proceed. Tony had invited him in, but not made it clear why or if there was any point beyond saying thank you. Maybe he should just leave now that was done with.
In reality, the second Tony had said Ty’s name Steve knew what he was going to do—what he had to do. The only thing holding him back from charging ahead with his plan was the consideration of if he should go to Tony in this moment. But the longer he thought about it, the more he knew Tony would not be receptive to conversation so soon. He will have blacked out the windows to his workshop and ordered Friday to keep everyone out at all costs. It would be a losing battle.
“I’m sorry Tony, I’ve just been…I’ve been carrying this weight—the guilt of what I did to you—and to hear you say you forgive me. It is good, overwhelming, but good,” he said, smiling and misty-eyed.
By the next morning Steve had decided to let Bucky’s comment go and not hyper fixate on it anymore. It all felt like too much of an inside joke Sam, Nat, and Bucky were playing on him and he did not want to encourage it. Instead, Steve spent the majority of his Sunday helping Wanda and Thor clean up the living and dining rooms for Family Dinner.
Thankfully, Steve did not have much time to worry by himself after getting dressed. He had taken so long to get ready that it was almost time for their date by the time he was finished. Just as he took a deep breath and centered himself—there was a knock on his bedroom door. When he opened it, he found Tony standing there in jeans, a AC/DC shirt, and his black leather jacket. He was too mesmerized by how gorgeous Tony looked—the man managed to make anything look exquisite—to realize that he himself had overdressed for the occasion. The leather jacket was one of Steve’s favorite wardrobe pieces that Tony wore.
Life had been much easier—albeit numb—when he was swimming in a sea of bourbon and whiskey. Now that he had been cast onto the shore of sobriety unpleasant was an understatement.
“If that’s how you wanted to spend our time this afternoon Romanoff, you could have just told me. Promise I won’t tell Barnes,” Tony quipped, winking, and pretending the wind didn’t just get knocked out of him.
“What?” Steve’s head snapped up at the sound of Tony’s voice and he clumsily shoved his phone back into his pocket.
Sitting back in his chair, willing to anxiety away with every fiber of his being, he sucked in a big breath of air. His pulse was pounding in his throat. His hands were sweating profusely.
Thank you so much for reading! Your support keeps me going. I hope you enjoyed the soft moments, there are definitely more to come!
Tony blinked slowly as he eased into consciousness. His eyelids felt heavy and his body was numb. When the blurriness faded from his eyes he became acutely aware as to why—he was in one of the hospital beds back at the Avengers Compound in the infirmary. The heart monitor steadily beeped in the background and there was an I.V. in his arm.
He wasn’t sure when Peter had snuck his way into his heart and set up shop, but whenever it happened he was instantly a goner. Peter had reminded him so much of himself as a kid, before the cruelty of life corrupted him—brilliant and eager to learn. Innocent and wide-eyed. He had reminded him of Harley, too, far too pure for this horrible world. Tony remembered his first instinct, once he had really gotten to know the kid, was a desire to shield him from all the bad things life had to offer.
Steve ducked his head and turned his back to the kitchen, hiding the scarlet blush sweeping across his pale skin. He used it as an excuse to start setting the table, as if that had been his plan all along. He was used to Tony’s flirtatious comments—hell, he had been making them from the second they met all those years ago—something about how spry he had been—why did he remember that detail this many years later?
“Okay,” Tony grimaced. “Alright, okay—enough of that. I’m trying to have a serious conversation, believe it or not.”
Tony jolted awake when Morgan climbed up into bed with him. It took him several seconds to adjust to his surroundings—he was back in his bedroom at the compound. What a relief to no longer be in the infirmary.
“Y’know Shellhead, I’m smart—we all know that—but I don’t know why they haven’t summoned your brilliant brain up there yet. We could definitely use you,” she responded, leaning into Tony a bit, returning the affection.
“Tony, please tell me you believe. Please say something,” he pleaded, still on his knees, arms still around Tony, looking up at him now with desperation and hope in his eyes. “Do you trust me?”
“You know, Cap, you dressed like that is making me seriously reconsider going to this thing,” he quipped, eagerly running his hands up and down Steve’s arms. Steve flushed a bit.
“I’m sorry you had to see all that this morning, Cap,” Tony said to break the silence. “You should have never been inflicted with the pain of meeting Ty.”
“If anyone messes this up, it isn’t gonna be you, Steve,” Tony sighed. “Trust me, that’s more my department. Obnoxious perfection is your’s.”
Steve captures him into another kiss, surprising Tony by pushing his tongue into his mouth and exploring wildly. It was, hands down, the best kiss Tony had ever experienced (and he had experienced many kisses before.) He wrapped his body around Steve’s, who he knew he could trust to hold him steady, and utterly lost himself in the simple yet beautiful sensation of his lips.
“Buck, I know you think you’re being helpful, but I’m genuinely not catching on here,” Steve said, rubbing the back of his neck sheepishly.
Ever since his conversation with Tony the other day, Steve had been getting progressively more and more comfortable with admitting that to himself. It was a glaring truth that he had been painfully aware of before Siberia, but he let that desire freeze over in the snow when he walked away that day.
“Hiding in the hallway alone and making frowny faces at your phone is no way to spend a party meant to celebrate you,” he chided.
“Okay,” Rhodey said, patiently listening to each word. That was always the best part about Rhodey, Tony thought, how well he listened even though he feigned impatience. When it actually came down to it, Rhodey was the best listener. He was attentive, patient, and compassionate.
“I know what you’re thinking,” Bucky interrupted Steve’s spiral. “And you’re wrong. So don’t bother. Have you ever considered that because you’re different, that’s why you two would work? That maybe Tony’s habit of dating people too similar to him is why those relationships have not lasted?”
“Oh thank god,” Tony sighed with relief. “And god Steve—have you seen your art? You’re brilliant! If you gave up being Captain America to pursue a career as an artist, I think you would manage just fine.”
Their individual reluctance to be the one to initiate the next step was not born out of a toxic masculinity need for competition or appearances—but rather, they both could feel the extreme weight of what this next move meant. Years of tension and deeply buried feelings hung in the air between them. This next step threatened to unravel everything—it would cause the walls they had strategically built up to come crashing down—and maybe that was a good thing.
The harshness of Sam’s tone kept Steve’s mouth shut. He knew Sam well enough to know the tone was meant lovingly—like a therapist dropping a reality bomb down in the middle of a session. So he sat there, fiddling with his hands in his lap, and staring down at his feet.
“You know me, Rogers, I make up my mind way before anyone else is even thinking about it. That’s what being a futurist means,” Tony snapped. And as Steve started to reply, Tony kept cutting him off—their voices getting higher and louder the further they spiraled into a struggle for who would get to talk first.
“Yeah, sorry,” Steve mumbled. He carefully unwrapped the gift—not wanting to tear any of the paper because even it looked expensive. After a couple painstaking moments, he had opened it and froze. Steve was unable to move as he stared at what lay in his lap—this was an impossible gift.
Nat was right—she always was, regrettably—if he just communicated his side of things clearly, then he could at least sleep at night knowing he did his best. He shot his shot. He will not have wasted the opportunity to try for the thing that he had wanted for as long as he could remember since waking up in this century.
While on his run he was haunted by all the ways he failed Tony. The look on Tony’s face when he found out the truth of his parents’ deaths—when he found out Steve knew—it was forever seared in his mind.
She must have seen his shaking hand because the next thing he knew she was kneeling in front of him, holding his face in her hands, with a serious expression. Steve mentally cursed himself—he knew better than to be so telling, because now she would take this burden on herself and that was the last thing he wanted. Hadn’t he caused enough pain?
“You don’t look too bad yourself, Romanoff,” Tony gave her a peck on the cheek. “Green velvet has always been perfect on you.”
“Thank you Thor—that really means a lot,” Bruce said, a few tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. “That’s very thoughtful. I love it.”
When Tony finally regained a semblance of composure they sat down on the ground, getting ready for the meteor shower that Peter said was meant to be visible in the next five minutes or so. Morgan climbed into Steve’s lap, leaning back against his broad chest, and stared up at the night sky expectantly. At Tony’s other side, Peter laid back in the grass and started kicking Tony’s calves every so often to be a nuisance. When the bright fiery spheres started to fall across the night sky, Morgan’s mouth fell open and she made all sorts of impressed noises. It made Tony giggle, seeing her awestruck and wide eyed. Steve looked over at him and smiled—Tony’s heart stopped for the few seconds that he and Steve held each other’s gaze. In that moment it felt like everything else faded away and all that existed were Steve’s bright blue eyes under the black sky. He knew he was a total goner at this point—he was helplessly lost in his feelings for Steve—and there was no recovering from it now. Rhodey’s encouragement had broken down whatever barrier was previously stopping him from feeling the full force and intensity of it before. Now he felt the entirety of it—and it was almost too much. His breath got caught in his chest and he forgot how to function, until Steve looked away and back at the meteors, and then Tony gasped for air. God—was he in love with Steve Rogers?
“Mr. Stark, I’m not sure you should drive tonight,” Peter whispered too loudly to be considered a whisper.
“Yeah, well, maybe he just feels bad for giving me so much hell for the language comment,” Steve mumbled, drinking more beer hoping it would wash away the semi-permanent blush on his cheeks.
“Oh Tony, I think we all know your honor was lost long ago,” Steve fired back. This time he decided not to back down and play their little game. It had been ages since he and Tony lobbed jests back and forth—he missed it.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice broke him out of his artistic flow. He looked up to see him standing on the outskirts of the living room, a blanket in hand, and his hair stuck up in every direction possible. Steve knew that look immediately.
“Love, we need to talk,” she said. Her and Bucky were in their now shared room getting ready for the party. Scott had insisted that everyone dress nicer than usual to highlight the specialness of the occasion. Bucky had decided on black jeans and a long-sleeved black button-up because he could not be bothered with anything colorful.
“He just left, actually. I took over because he’s been at your beside for the last ten hours—since you got out of surgery, that is,” she responded. “I made him leave to go clean up and get some rest. He hadn’t even changed out of his uniform.”
"Tony!" Mary was still there. Tony couldn't let this man hurt her, or get to Peter. The electricity was starting to short out the suit, the HUD was flickering, and there was a lot of red in his vision. This had to stop.
“Probably about five minutes after you went in the room.” Steve closed his book, then started to rub Jamie’s back, hoping for a gentle wakeup. “She probably won’t be exactly happy to wake up.”
"Did you know, that even celebrities are people, too? I know, it's a shocking misconception, where the general public and news organizations would have us believe that they are akin to Gods!"
"I bet you he doesn't do that to his mom," Tony continued the conversation, then started to brush his teeth.
"Won't know until I open it," Steve said, hand sliding down Tony's back. "And now that you've told me about it, there's no backing out." Tony leaned back onto the couch and pulled the envelope out of his pocket, handing it over to Steve.
Tony wouldn't tell any of them, but the suit was supporting Tony as they fought. He didn't have the needed strength or energy to keep himself standing for longer than five minutes, and his wrist was probably broken. Jarvis knew about this, could see the readings on the HUD, and tried to work with his creator so that Tony didn't have to do much maneuvering with his hand. But Tony would work through a hundred broken bones if it meant stopping this invasion and keeping Peter safe.
Edit// I have been persuaded to post the next chapter tomorrow (Sunday), instead of making you all wait until Tuesday. Let it be known that I can be as kind as I can be evil!
Of course! Tony almost rolled his eyes again. The soldier comes out to play. "Followings not really my style."
“Just this one time, we can break the rules,” Steve said as he set the tray down on the coffee table in front of them. Jarvis had automatically paused the movie they had been watching. “We can eat out here, because it looks like everyone is comfortable out here. Next time though, we eat at the table.” The boys grinned, scooting up a little. Tony leaned in to grab Jamie as Steve sat down on the ground, splitting up the pancakes onto plates for everyone.
“I don’t think I could pull off the same look,” Steve said with a small chuckle, catching the smile on Tony’s face. He always got that soft, almost shy, smile when Steve and Peter interacted. “If it’s alright though, I’ll go with you guys. We can all get a haircut at the same time.”
"How are you going to do that?" She asked, looking in towards the giant arc reactor in the building.
Flynn Rider and Rapunzel were standing in a cove of sorts, and Peter had hopped up on the bricks that were behind them to get more height. Tony already had his phone out, getting shots of the three of them, and Steve pulled his out to take pictures one handed.
"He didn't do, or say anything," Steve said, thinking about his limited interactions with Tony, but also thinking about Mary's words as well. "I guess that's the problem. He comes off, kind of," Steve paused, trying to think of the right words.
“Tony!” The boy sucked in a breath, tensing, and Eevee sensed it. “What have you done!” Tony quickly scrambled to stand up, turning around to see Howard marching towards him. Eevee let out a soft inquisitive churr and stepped up beside Tony, looking back and forth between Howard and Tony. Howard stopped and Tony saw something in his eyes. Something soft, that quickly disappeared into something that Tony was more familiar with. “Anthony Edward Stark.” Tony tried not to cringe.
“Well, a man can dream,” Tony said with a smirk. “Now, we never tell Mama how much I got you guys to eat.” Tony pointed at the two boys with his fork. “They’ll both have my butt for giving you so much unhealthy stuff.”
“In the way that I’m a regular,” Steve told him. “Until very recently, I’ve been able to come pick up Peter, and now Wade, without being as recognized as Tony.” He motioned towards a group of three women talking across from them by a rose bush, and Bucky followed with his eyes. “Tori is taking care of her nephew while his parents are serving overseas. She seemed  a little lost last year, so Genna and her fiancé Harriet managed to get her to come to a couple PTA meetings, and now the three of them are in charge of volunteers for school functions. Genna and Harriet have a set of twin girls that are in Peter and Wade’s class, and that’s how I met them.”
"You should be learning with me, then." Steve managed to get both little feet in, then quickly slid the outfit up her legs before she could wiggle out.
Tony would have to make sure that Peter ate three meals a day, that he had his snack, and went to bed on time, and took his bath, and brushed his teeth, and make sure that he didn't have nightmares. He have to be in charge of any punishments, of making sure that Peter did his chores. Tony would have to do all of that, and half of that stuff Tony didn't even do himself! He was already turning into Howard.
"It's a little more difficult than that. And I'll have to leave you to dwell on that thought, because I have to go." He grabbed his duffle and the bag from the side table.
Tony stepped out of the room, closing the bedroom door lightly and headed a couple doors down to Peter's room. "Hey, Jarvis, have you located Wade and his Mother?"
"I'm convinced that you're actually a villain." She sat up on the couch a bit, putting the fruit plate to the side.
“Among other things,” Tony said with a slight smile. Steve dropped a kiss along his jaw. “Is everything okay downstairs?”
"So do you!" Peter leaned up to tug on some of Tony's longer hair. He giggled when Tony's eyes widened a little at the sudden action. "The hair's starting to grow over your ears."
Steve let out a frustrated huff, hiding his worry for seeing Tony like this. This was the last thing that either of them had expected. But being fair, neither of them had probably expected anything. Steve almost startled when Strange pulled his hands back from Tony.
I was still working a lot, my job actually ends on X-Mas eve, but just as everything started to slow down we had a pretty major thing happen. I got my keyboard to work so that wasn't stopping me anymore. I had to take my mom into the Emergency Room a few weeks ago and she ended up having a really bad infection that started in her foot. We didn't know about it, or how long it had been there, and it became life threatening.
"Thanks," Tony said quietly, then gave a little nod. At the nod the elevator doors opened and the two men stepped onto the floor. Tony kissed Steve lightly, then rubbed Jamie's cheek in his arms a little, before stepping further into the apartments. Wade and Peter were sitting on the couch, having changed clothes.
Tony couldn’t help but smirk a little when he heard the familiar whimpering pouts of young Jamie. As they entered the room, the little girl was hanging onto Steve, not wanting to let go and be separated. He set Peter down on his feet again, and the boy ran over to stand next to Mary. Phil had Jamie’s diaper bag, and Peter’s backpack over his shoulder.
"It's true, Tony. I'm still here, he's a friend." Steve nodded when she spoke. They needed him to not worry about who Steve was at the moment.
Tony raised his hands and Steve moved his head a little to look at him. “When I’m out of the suit, but in the field, am I Tony? Or still Iron Man?”
"I am taking the longest vacation when all of this over," Tony said carefully. "Seriously." He took a slow controlled breath.
"Okay!" Peter said with a grin, hopping up to his feet. Tony chuckled and pulled out two red clip-on ties. He passed one to Steve and they put them on the boys. "I have taken two wily, scrappy, little boys, and I've turned them into handsome little men!"
Loki leaned in a little, interested at the tidbit. “There are more little Starks?” Steve turned his head, snarling quietly. Loki raised an eyebrow, almost elegantly, with amusement. “You certainly have attached yourself quite nicely. Perhaps one of them is yours? Tell me, how many more are there?” Steve ground his jaw together a little, then turned his attention back to Dr Strange.
"You've been thinking," Tony murmur under his breath. "I can feel it, you're half way to Captain America." Steve raised an eyebrow. "You're more 'Man with a Plan', than Steve Rogers." Steve opened his mouth, but Tony cut him off. "Do not say that Steve Rogers is also a man with a plan, because I know for a fact that you did not plan our first date. Or the first time we kissed, or even the second time."
"When I first met Mary, and I found out that Tony Stark was Peter's father, well, I was surprised." She stirred in some sugar and creamer in her own coffee. "At that point, all that was known was that you had just come out as Iron Man not too long before that, and you still had rumors of your party and playboy ways floating around." Tony nodded a little. "I thought Mary was crazy when she said that you were active in Peter's life, and that you actually tried to make time. I mean, the press didn't know about him, and there were no pictures of the two of you together, so I figured it was the bare minimum.
"It feels weird," Tony admitted, feeling a bit better as he smelled the pizza int he oven. It had probably been nearly two days since he had eaten actual food, and since he couldn't have any alcohol he would actually need food sustenance. "When he first saw it, he wanted to know if that was a light in my chest, and then he says, 'I like blue.' Rhodey, I like blue," Tony let out a little laugh. "In a fashion only kids can pull off. Sometimes his little finger will tap it, lightly, but he just puts his hand over it, like he's feeling it."
"Yeah," Steve said slowly, quietly. "I'll be okay," Mary took that as the bullshit answer that it was, but didn't say anything. "It's just," he took a breath, and there was that sadness creeping out into his voice a little now. "I had a date."
"Alright my minions!" Tony called out to them. "Time to hose off!" He sprayed a line of water on the grass, making a temporary line as the blades of grass were bent down by the pressure. "Line up there and we'll get all that icky pool water off, so you don't smell like chemicals." The half dozen kids laughed and scurried over to the grass. Steve walked over to the cement where Tony and the two lifeguards were standing, now also holding hoses.
Tony blinked, looking at Mary, and she stared back at him evenly. "I must have misheard you," Tony said eventually.
“Yeah, don’t expect that to happen every year.” Tony snorted softly and hopped into the drivers seat. “I don’t want you to get spoiled by having private birthday parties with just me.”
Tony hugged Jamie to his chest. “She wouldn’t combust, she’s too sweet.” Jamie giggled, putting her hands on Tony’s cheeks. “Yes you are, aren’t you tiny one?”
"A couple weeks after he was born," Tony answered. Rhodey was trying to figure out just how long Tony knew about this, and how long he had been keeping it a secret. "No one else knows about him, or his mom," Tony prompted. "Not even Pepper or Happy. Well, technically Pepper knows, but she doesn't know that the paternity test was positive. Not the point I was trying to make, but-"
Boneless bodies were laying against each other, Steve half on top of Tony, Tony’s arms wrapped around him as tight as he could. Both were still breathing in time with each other, even and steady. “That’s what you felt?” Steve asked later, pressing his lips to Tony’s shoulder. Tony hummed and nodded. “I think I felt it. I saw it in your eyes.” Tony’s eyes fluttered open to look at him, pressing his face into Steve’s hand that came up. “I love you, so much.”
"At one year old, I'm not sure if he'll actually-" Mary reached over, putting a finger over Tony's mouth, stopping him.
"We are capable of not dying when Mom and Dad are gone having fun." Coulson stared at Tony. "Ouch, Agent, that look, it hurts. You need to cut that out, you're the new step-dad to our son."
Steve knew he had just read about someone finishing school at a young age, and he knew that it would be a long jump between that person and Peter's Dad, but something was urging to double check the facts. His laptop was at the table and he sat down, opening it up and watching it load. He had been int he process of transferring his handwritten notes to the computer, hoping it would make it easier for him to find certain facts, like what he was looking for.
"There are two suits in the back seat of the vehicle as well," Jarvis said. Jamie looked around, like she did every time the AI spoke, but quickly went back to examining Steve's foot. "Including one Sir's newest models of the suitcase armor."
He grabbed his shield and was leaping down the stairs, barely touching down on them, and he heard a couple more gunshots. But they weren’t aimed at him. He jumped over the railing and kicking at the two closest men, before throwing a punch at another. He could see light coming out from underneath a door, and then a shout that sounded too much like Wade’s.
“She wasn’t feeling the water today,” Steve told him. “She got the shortest bath ever, and I suddenly remembered what the quickest shower in Army history felt like.”
"You wanna try feeding Conor?" Tony glanced over at Mary, who was leaning in towards Peter. She tossed over a bottle to Tony, then held out another bottle to help Peter.
“Wade, baby,” she tried to soothe him, her hands cupping his cheeks. “I’m right here, I’m not hurt. He didn’t do anything to me.”
“You know I don’t really have a-“ Steve paused, tilting his head when he caught sight of something down the line of cars. Tony smirked, rocking back on his heels a little. “I’ve never seen this one before.” Steve bit his lip, smiling a little. “I know this model.”
Tony took a deep breath, resting his head against the cool tile of his bathroom floor. Jarvis had dropped the temperature for him, and a little shiver slipped down his spine. He hadn't had a hangover in nearly five months, and he was starting to remember why. It wasn't just the fact that Mary had caught him in the aftermath of a hangover after a particularly long Iron Man mission, and the fact that her eyes, full of disappointment haunted him- Actually, that was most of the reason. He hadn't been allowed to see, or even speak to Peter, for three days after that, and only after she made him breath into a breathalyzer. He couldn't blame her, but it had shamed him a bit more than he thought it would.
But, Steve supposed that in this different time period, the same could be said for what Tony was doing for Peter. Enemies of Anthony Stark might go after his workers, and someone like Tony if his work was really that important, and that could lead to a possibility of going after Peter. He knew it was far-fetched, but a parent would do whatever they had too to keep their children safe. Steve knew that first hand from his Mother.
"Ouch, right in the gut, Rhodey." Tony feigned stumbling out of the pantry, taking a direct hit from the older mans words. "I'm pretty sure I can get this right."
On board, Tony took off his helmet, glaring daggers at Loki. He could feel Captain America beside him, but the man never took his cowl off, hiding his face. "I don't like it," the man said suddenly.
“I must question what powered this scepter,” Strange said as he took a step closer to Loki. “The only thing that I could that would be strong enough-“
"Oh yeah, not with that little nest egg that you're sitting on," Sam commented with a smile, going into the bathroom.
"Fine by me, but I'm going to defer to your Mom, kay? I'm Peter's parent, not yours, so I don't get overrule those decisions." Tony ruffled Wade's hair a bit. "I got your back though, you and your Mom's."
"Long sleeve, I'm in New York in winter, it's cold." He glanced at a black button down, but didn't pick it up.
What the actual hell was going on? Steve landed and ran for the fight, because it was glaringly obviously where the two men were. He threw his shield, watching it hit Thor's chest, bounce to Iron Man, bounce off, and then angled back up to him. One arm was pointed at Steve now, the other at Thor, until Stark registered who had attacked them.
"You're just going to let that lunatic go??" Tony felt there were more pressing matters at issue. Captain America let their would-be assassin go!
"If our intel is right, it's located in DC." She looked at Steve. "We’d have better luck if we moved the operation to the Triskelion."
“That, and the fact that I’m walking around with a video game character, and someone from a different movie,” Steve pointed out.
"Not yet, but they're getting close," Coulson said. "They've pegged the bike at least, and I think you're underestimating the intensity of an online obsession."
Tony cuddled the toddler in his arms, Peter’s hand instantly seeking out Tony’s arc reactor, and looked up at Mary. She was smiling at him, and shrugged a bit. Tony looked around at the other three in the room, two of them looking a little shocked at what had just happened. Rhodey held up his hands in surrender.
"I do not come here to trade quips, Stark," Loki said darkly. Tony swore the room got colder, and he heard Steve let out a strange huff of breath. "I need you to speak to Thor of my small amount of innocence." Tony's eyes widened a little. "You have felt what was in my head, what influence was there. You have felt what it is like to have your body turn against your allies, to fight for something that you thought to be the only reason to fight, no matter what." Loki leaned his face closer to Tony's. "You have heard them, am I not right?"
He didn't want to see what was there. He didn't want to see the darkness, didn't want to think that he was far away from Peter again.
"Thought it might be a worth a shot to watch, there's a big fan following online." Steve, it was Steve that he was on. "It's a little late for dinner, but we still have time to catch up on some pop culture."
Mary stopped, looked at the people running towards the trucks, and looked around. No one else was coming, that was good. She turned around and gasped, seeing Barton inches away from her, gun drawn and pointed at her head. She stood absolutely still, letting him take the pistol from her hand, putting it in his own gun holster. The strange man with the spear approached her from the side, but Mary never took her eyes off of Barton's unnatural blue ones.
“There usually is a good reason for what I do,” Strange replied with a little smirk. “Till we meet again.” Tony raised an eyebrow but nodded to the man and went back to peeling the orange he was working on.
"I would suggest not being in there for long," Thor said after several moments, moving a couple steps away from the door. Tony nodded, pulled open the door just enough to slip in through, and closed the door. He stayed close to the exit, looking at the man that had kidnapped his son, sitting on a bench at the other end of the room.
Natasha was waiting for them in the hanger, standing by one of the quinjets, the engines already going, ready to take off. "About time, she said when they walked out. "I want to get back before the guys eat all of the bacon." She gave a short nod to Fury and Hill, Thor and Loki were next, Tony following with a bit of space, and Steve after him. Steve made sure that the back of the quinjet was raising before anyone could say anything and Clint was already taking off.
“You know, you’ve taught me how to use a Starkphone,” Steve told him. “I know how to text pictures as well. And where are you going to put all the pictures? I don’t think there’s enough room on the walls to go with the drawings and paintings.”
Tony rubbed the spot of his nose between his eyes, pushing his new glasses up out of the way, and groaned a little. He was rapidly remembering why he preferred contacts to glasses, even if he had only been wearing them for less than a day. Or perhaps it was because he had been staring for too long at holographic screens and tablets. He was going to blame the glasses.
"Didn't I?" Tony looked back over to her. "I made the suit, I put on the suit, I made myself a target."
"I've come to put an end to Loki's schemes!" Thor shouted at him, looking at him like it was all his fault.
“Can’t hear you!” He held up one of Peter’s shoes. “These are huge. They really go for accuracy, don’t they?”
“I do not fancy being under this beings control again. I did it once and you were the one to deal with the aftermath of that.” Loki lazily circled the two men between them. “And if I were to risk that again, I would not be able too, for your organization has lost the scepter that was originally handed to me. The power that it held was beyond what most humans can comprehend.”
The door to Mary's room opened and Tony's head popped up. He saw William walking out, a sleeping Peter in his arms. Tony hopped up, slipping his phone into his pocket and walked forward, easily taking Peter from the older man. Peter's head was on Tony's shoulder and he snuggled into Tony's chest, hand pressing against the arc reactor. Tony smiled a little.
Peter bit on his bottom lip for a second before looking up at Tony, puffing up in sudden courage. “Well, I was just thinking, that you know, they’ll be staying there, and maybe I could spend more time on your floor? Mama and Phil have a lot more work to do now, and I’m teaching Jamie stuff, too. Just so she doesn’t need as much attention, of course, but,” he shrugged and wiggled a little. “And Jamie’s gonna grow up calling you Daddy, like I do, even though I was first, but she’s gonna grow up calling Mr Steve something else, right?”
Tony leaned in, looking through more calculations, but he realized that this is more of a formula and that Bruce must be getting closer to cracking the secret about these secret scientists have been working on. Only, as Tony read on, he started to recognize what he was looking at. Not in the "that's-human-DNA" way, but in the "I've-seen-this-before" way.
"It seems Peter likes to grab everything that he can now," Mary said after she had reclaimed her phone from the baby.
Tony nodded. "You know where the key is." Tony took Peter from Bruce's arms, the little boy putting his head against Tony's shoulder, eyes mostly closed. Steve grabbed his shield, and the trio was off, headed back to the Manor.
Peter was smiling at Tony, the pushed one of the Captain America cupcakes over to Steve, then over to Tony, the third still in front of him. "My Daddy's the best." Tony picked up the cupcake, and a genuine smile spread over his face as he looked at Peter. Okay, so, maybe he could put up with Steve sitting next to his son for a few more minutes.
He sat in the ruined club house, most of his armor having been stripped off on the floor. Pepper was on her way back, but it probably take her at least a day to make it to where he was. Tony looked down at the two Pokeballs in his hands, one painted orange, the other painted blue. Two Pokeballs that refused to open after a 70 year ice sleep. SHIELD had been unable to get them open, but they could at least reveal that the Arcanine, and the Braviary inside were as healthy as the living legend they belonged too. Tony knew what he had to do, and it was breaking his heart.
“So, we’re just making up for lost time.” Steve pushed against Tony’s spoon, and Tony pushed back, smirking a bit.
“Gonna be clean shaven by my birthday at the latest,” Steve murmured, eyes closed and smiling. “Although, this is making a strong argument to keep it.” Tony hummed, then bit his lip when Jamie leaned forward, reaching her arms up, wanting to scratched Steve’s face too. He grinned and lifted up his leg so she could get the height. Steve startled a little, opening his eyes when Jamie’s sharp little nails started to drag on his skin. He glanced down and smiled at her. “Still very, monkey-see monkey-do.”
Tony nodded. "Where I got the arc reactor," he said, tapping his chest. "Got blown up by one of my own missiles, got my own shrapnel in my chest. I don't know why I got lucky, but there was a man there, Yinsen, he saved my life." Tony let out a breath, focused on Steve's hands. "They wanted me to build a weapon,
"They're setting up a room, hoping to make things more comfortable when he wakes up." Coulson said, pulling up the details on his PDA before handing it to Mary. She frowned a little, and raised an eyebrow.
Tony took several deep, and vaguely controlled breaths in, and out, through his nose. It was too much. There was shouting, then more calm voices, then gruff tones. People were moving around him, and the air seemed to pulse with too much energy, too many emotions around him. He couldn’t focus on the thoughts in his head, couldn’t hear himself. There was a twinge his arm and his hand slapped down to cover it suddenly.
Tony slowed his movements a little. He hadn't thought of a way to tell her about what happened yesterday. He was still a little shaken just thinking about it. "Uh, well, it went well." Mary looked at him, eyebrow raised. "We haven't even spent that much time together for you to know if I'm full of shit or not."
“Yes!” Tony turned to face him, putting his hands on Steve’s cheeks. “It’s like a cult, Steven, and there is no fighting it. You don’t want them to turn on you, trust me.”
"Early in the morning," Steve replied, stopping at the edge of the table. Tony just grunted. "I didn't know about this, Tony."
"He's safe, Tony." Tony kept pushing at the hands, trying to keep them away. The hands moved to his shoulders, but they were a light touch. "Tony, open your eyes for me. Open your eyes."
"Well, I just, it's hard to reconcile the man that I knew, and the man that was actually your dad," Steve admitted. "But I didn't know him that long. I didn't actually see him that often during the war."
He wrangled both feet into socks and quickly slid the little shoes on before she could pull them off. Steve held up an elastic headband with a flower on it, and watched her nose scrunch up. He chuckled and tossed it over to the bedside table. "I'm sorry that you're already in danger because of who I am. I made some enemies, and it seems that they didn't disappear when I did. But, I promise that I'm going to try my hardest." He let out a breath then picked her up to hold her in his arms. "I think I have a better appreciation for how Tony feels about wanting to keep Peter safe. Tony is your other dad, and I hope that Peter will be your big brother. He's an amazing kid, one of the best." He dropped a kiss on her forehead and she let her body rest against his chest.
“Hawkeye, keep an eye for the next attack, see if you can’t get a bead on the trajectory and location,” Steve said, doling out moves. It was almost like training. “Falcon, War Machine, do a perimeter around the building, check for any other impact sights. Widow, scan for possible set-ups locations, even possible sniper nests.” Tony looked at Steve who was looking out the window at him. “Iron Man, do you know if we looking at something mechanical or organic yet?”
"To be fair, Captain America is a pretty upstanding person." Steve grinned at Tony, before looking back down at Rowan in his arms. "Steve Rogers on the other hand-"
"Sir, I'm afraid that I have not changed the temperature settings," Jarvis responded, causing Tony to lift his head a little. Jarvis sounded a little... sluggish? "It would appear, that... there is... Captain..." Jarvis stopped responding and Tony shot up from the bed. He let out a breath and saw it form a cloud in front of him. He ran out into the hallway and rubbed his arms against the chill that was there. Jarvis had been trying to say something about Steve as well.
"Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think you mean the other thing." Mary glanced back up at the ceiling, then looked back when she saw Barton moving, finally.
"You think I'm going to take chances like that?? I'm not about to find myself stuck in the first fifteen minutes of a Supernatural episode."
“They ‘us’ part is pretty fabulous, too.” Steve’s body shook with a barely contained laughter. “Don’t know what I’d do if I didn’t have this right now, honestly. I mean, of course I can think of a few things, and they’re all generally bad things, but that’s you know, not happening, so best not to think about it.”
" It was the same voice from the Chitauri attack, the same smile that always looked like it was filled with dark blood. "He'll be pleased that you came to Him."
Steve was fidgety, looking over at Bucky, then back to Meg. She cursed under her breath and ran her hands through her hair. "This is so not what I signed up for. I was expecting to come home, see my kids, and maybe try and get some more rest."
I've decided to put this story on a schedule, with chapters coming in twice a week. Tuesdays and Saturdays. This is mostly because I'm nearly half way through my current University course, (they're 8-week terms), and we're ramping up to our final paper already, and I'll be playing physical therapist for my mom soon. Also, schedules are nice! :D
“Not at all!” Steve said with a smile. He had even started the coffee machine. Tony thought he could kiss the man. “I can see why they’re special to you. I, uh, hope you don’t mind if I’d like to spend some time with them? I mean, even when you aren’t gone? It’s just, I mean, Arc likes to play with them, and Brave laughs at it. They’re small and fast enough that they don’t get hurt when they’re playing, and it’s really something to see, and Peggy thought it was the most adorable thing ever-“
"This is one reason why I'm glad I have a boy," Tony continued on. "I'm a boy, so I have an idea on how to handle boy stuff."
"You're going to start another coughing attack if you keeping talking at that pace." He put an end of the sandwich in Tony's mouth again, making him take a bite this time. "You know that they'll want to move the furniture themselves, and they'll have plenty of help. They don't get here for another few hours, and there is literally nothing else that you need to do until they get here."
Steve had been in the process of getting up to sit back on the couch and frowned at Wade's words. He turned and saw Bucky and Meg standing by the arm of the couch. Steve jumped again, putting a hand to his chest. "Stop scaring me!"
"I'm not sure what you were thinking taking the stairs," Steve said from the back of the elevator, making Tony jump. Jamie giggled softly. "Mary lives on the Eighty-Fourth floor."
"And it works??" Bruce was completely involved now. Tony had him hooked in the science department at least, even if it wasn't in his usually field of study.
"Of course I used a knife!" Tony frowned, scrubbing his hands of the sticky food substance. Sitting on the cutting board was a knife, completely covered in peanut butter. "I'm gonna go get Peter." Rhodey smiled a little as he watched Tony job up the stairs to the bedrooms.
Tony grit his jaw and pulled the papers roughly from his hand, opening them. The paper was thick, and Tony was soon able to see that they were photographs. Rage boiled in his blood when he saw that they were of Peter. There were a couple of Tony out with Peter at the zoo from last month, one him holding Peter while he walked away from Mary's door, before he put his hat back on. And there was a picture that Tony knew he had only hung up in his house; Jarvis had caught Tony and Peter in a moment down in the workshop, Dum-E holding onto the fire extinguisher, Butterfingers trying to make a smoothie, and U trying to hand Peter a screwdriver. The boy was grinning at the bots, laughing as Tony put his hands up to stop Dum-E from using the bright red canister, again.
Steve shook his head, holding her a little closer. "I don't think it'd be right, giving her up." Tony tilted his head a little, and something just clicked. The look that Steve had, that was the look that he had captured from Tony in some of his drawings with Peter. He let out a breath and slumped back into his seat a bit more. No wonder Steve liked to draw him when he was with Peter all the time, that look was enough to knock Tony off his feet.
"Yes, let's," Mary nodded, turning away from the window. "I'll never hear the end of it from Tony if he beats us."
“I’m a little surprised that you’re doing a vacation for your birthday,” Mary said, sitting down next to Tony’s head on the bed, looking down at him. “Do you even know what a vacation is?”
“I like when I figure stuff out,” he said with a smile. “Also, since we’ve trapped them here by keeping the babies in a natural sleep like state in a crib, it will now force you and Sergeant Mopey to talk about feelings!” Meg snorted and covered her mouth as Bucky tried to actually murder Tony with his eyes.
Tony sat there in silence for a few more moments, then pushed himself up from the chair, leaving the room. He stopped when he saw Bruce leaning against the wall across from the door. He looked tired.
"It's kind of an inside joke?" Steve said with a shy little smile. "Coulson helped me find some phones that looked like ones from the movie, and that would still actually work. I'm pretty shocked that I managed to pull it off, honestly." Tony watched Steve for a second. He had set-up, and pulled off, a well-timed stunt, without Tony's help. "I thought I was going to fall right on top of her trying to dance."
"Save the rest for the turn, J," Tony said quietly. "Steve," Tony let out a breath. "Take care of him."
Tony closed his eyes again, moving his head slightly when Steve’s soft lips were against his neck. “You already know what I thought my life was going to be like,” Steve told him. “And I got you now, and I got Peter and Jamie, and hell, I even got Bucky back. I’m not letting you go, and I will do everything in my power to keep you. To keep this family.” Tony pushed his face into Steve’s neck. “I’m going to smother you with happiness.”
He thought that perhaps he would offer to take Peter back to his apartment to pack some stuff, Steve still needed to get some of his stuff from his own place. Steve wasn't sure if Tony would want to go with them, but he’d see what happened when he offered it.
The woman sputtered a bit, her face turning red, and the other reporters were dangerously close to turning on him. "Don't want to answer all those questions? That's alright, I respect your decision to not expose them to hundreds of thousands, possibly millions of people." Tony's gaze raked over the rest of the press. "That's what it sounds like to my ears." Tony stood up fully. "As I said, Mini-Me is young, and as his father, I will do what I have too to protect him. I humbly ask that everyone refrain from taking unauthorized, illegal, pictures of my Mini-Me, and heaven forbid you find her, his mother. Do not approach him, do not talk to him, like he were some other high profile target for your news days. I'm sure that the rest of you would not want anyone to do that to your kids, or grandkids, nieces, nephews, or even cousins. You'll know when you're allowed to capture his image, or his voice." Tony waited, waited for any other stupid questions to pop up that would go against what he had just said, and was pleasantly surprised when nothing else about his son came.
"Don't want this winding up in the wrong hands," Tony murmured, trying to forget his dream, trying to forget the enemies he was gaining, that might possibly hurt his baby boy. "Maybe in mine, it can actually do some good."
Steve glanced around, discreetly checking to see if anyone had actually paid attention to the boy’s words. “No cotton candy,” he said. Suddenly Wade was grinning, and then Jamie was gasping. Steve turned his head and Peter was leaning over the table, reaching forward with a small tuft of cotton candy. Jamie reached for it with her whole body, eyes bright as she recognized what it was, and Peter was popping it in her mouth. Wade had hurried forward as Jamie closed her mouth, squealing with her mouth closed as it melted in her mouth.
"Yeah! Means she was born in Italy." Peter nodded, continuing again. Steve kept eating as Peter explained. "Daddy really can't cook anything else that good, at least not without help from Mommy, Uncle James, or Jarvis." The little boy took another bite of ice cream, the bowl almost empty. "Sometimes Jarvis has Dummy come up," the little boy giggled, like he had just told a joke.
"So, the stairs over there," Tony motioned with his head to the end of the hallway, "lead up to the second floor. They can have any bedroom they want, the ones that are unlocked." Tony felt the need to leave, to take Peter and be somewhere else in the mansion. "If the door is locked, please, for the love of gods, no one go into that room. It's locked for a reason. If you need me, ask Jarvis, he can relay any messages." Tony was already moving down the hallway before Steve could say anything. Tony belatedly realized that his tablet was still in Mary's room.
"I will let you get another hour or so of sleep, before Peter wakes up, and we'll talk soon," Tony said, feeling his ability to socialize with other humans starting to dwindle.
"The point is that you like him a hell of a lot more than you thought," the older man inferred. "And it's scaring you."
“Oh, I’m sorry, did you not want to admit that out loud?” Rhodey teased. “That’s okay, because I’ll just let our basketball teams speak for us. We won, by the way.”
"Because the internet is so hard to use to look up details about Captain America from World War Two," she deadpanned. "I'm serious Steve, I'm going to send some of this stuff back to you."
"Daddy, Daddy, Daddy." Peter's voice came down the hall, the little boy hopping on both feet towards the two men. "Granpa says that dinner is ready."
"I'm on a time constraint, actually," Tony admitted. "Mr Hayes has decided to try extortion, and now it'll become blackmail, and he's going to reveal Peter." There was a gasp from Pepper. "Pull out the prepared papers, call the conference."
Mary pulled back on the door that gave access to the wiring and gasped when she saw Peter huddled in a ball. "Peter," she breathed, putting her weapon back in the holster quickly, and grabbing onto her son.
"I would not jeopardize you so in front Miss Parker's parents," Jarvis told him. Good Guy, Jarvis. Tony smiled at the thought. The man that Tony wanted to talk to would take more than a couple of hours to contact, of that he was certain, but it would be better to start now.
“Mary gave Jarvis her recipe, so when Pepper, or Rhodey, or even Happy, are around they help make the batter.” Tony took a long drag of coffee. It was early, Peter having woken them up, with the exception of Steve. Steve had already been up and out for a morning run. He was the one who had started the pot of coffee that Tony was drinking from. (With some help from Jarvis on how to get the new machine started.) “And lately Mary’s parents, or Agent have been helping cook. He’s actually a pretty decent cook, by the way.”
"So you want to stay here, huh?" Tony did Not want to stay here, but he had been having nightmares on and off back at the Manor. After his panic attack he hadn't actually gotten a real nights sleep, spending more and more time down in the workshop. There had been the nightmares of the desert, of the cave, and then eventually came the nightmares from his childhood. "Well, we have to ask Mama if it's alright." Peter squealed a little as Tony pulled out his phone.
"It was a General that discharged him," Tony said, lifting his head back up to lean back against the couch. "General Ross, who is one of the doucheist Generals around." Tony glanced at Bucky, sighed, then made a motion with his hands. "For pity's sake, Barnes, she's not contagious. Give her here." Bucky stepped forward quickly to hand off Jamie to someone who would hold her properly. "Wilson couldn't be the one giving the order, then it would tie the man back to him."
"As soon as they can get him out of the building," Mary said, nodding. It didn't take long until the door opened again, the voices of reporters following, and Tony slid in the limo quickly, the door closing, and he let out a breath.
It wasn't until the back of the quinjet was up, and they were in the air, did the little girl tucked in Tony's arms started making noise. She had started to wiggled, unhappy sounds coming from her mouth, arms pushing up. Tony tried to sooth her, but he was kind of out of his league on how to deal with an unhappy baby. Tony was still arc reactor free, and a relative asshole, when Peter was this age, and he only saw him a few times a month.
“I doubt that she can understand you,” Mary whispered in Tony’s ear. He waved one hand, shooing her away.
"Yeah? Okay, shoot. I think your AI is just leading me in some kind of complicated loop to try and drop any tails, anyway."
“Mom!” He wrapped his arms around her waist, pressing his face to her stomach as he started to cry again. She held onto him tightly, her own red rimmed eyes dropping a few more tears down her cheeks. Steve pushed himself up, eye twitching a little as he felt the two bullets still in his leg and shoulder now that the adrenaline of a fight had worn off. He caught Julie’s eye when she looked over at him, and he just gave her a nod and motioned back towards the elevator. She didn’t need to worry about him, Wade was infinitely more important. He’d be up to tell her what happened soon.
"You okay?" Tony nodded at Steve's words. With the arc reactor so close to losing the rest of its power he didn't have time make conversation. The latch swung open and he reached in, pulling out a mess of wires. "That looks, complicated."
"You're not helping, Cap." Tony glanced around. "Where is the Mom? She should know what her child did to me."
“He’s just extra happy that he gets pancakes on a non-Saturday day,” Tony said as the trio went to the dining table.
"You never had a bad night?" Steve said, holding onto Wade, feet pointed towards Tony. Tony raised an eyebrow at him, but grabbed the other converse and put them on Wade as well. "Bow ties are going to be near impossible to get on these two."
“We won’t be here for lunch!” Tony called out causing Mary and Steve to raise an eyebrow. “I’ve got plans before the party and fireworks. I’m taking Steve away from here.”
The suit powered up and the faceplate opened on Rhodey's suit. "Oh man," Rhodey groaned, taking Tony's hand and helping him to his feet. "You can have your suit back."
"Daddy!" He laughed and wiggled around, but didn't push Tony away. Tony cackled and lifted his shirt, blowing a raspberry on Peter's stomach this time, causing him to squeal again. "Daddy, no! That tickles!"
"How'd it go?" He glanced at Obie, then saw the pizza sitting on the table. "It went that bad, huh?"
"Not October," Tony looked at him. "Definitely not October, not if we want Peter to ever continue speaking with us."
Steve was back, there were fireworks in a couple of hours, Peter had confessed to liking living with Tony. It had been a really good day. He even showed his private collection to Steve, Steve Rogers! The last person on the planet that he would have wanted to show that room too, but it had been worth it, seeing his reaction.
“Light sabers!” Peter’s eyes widened when he put it together, then saw Tony pull out two light saber hilts. He handed one to Peter, and handed the other to Steve. “It’s the right model!”
"Dugan had them," Tony said just as quietly. "He must have found them, or something." Tony knew exactly what had happened. Someone had turned in the dog tags nearly five years after the war ended, thinking that they were from a fallen soldier and that they family deserved to have them. After Bucky's parents had died Dum Dum Dugan had somehow come into possession of them, and then had given them to his Aunt Peggy. It was for Tony's tenth birthday that Peggy had given him the set of dog tags from the Howling Commandos. She felt they were in safer hands with Tony than with Howard. Tony didn't want to tell him that Peggy had given them to him, not yet.
“Uhhhnnn,” Tony moaned, mouth open wide. He then sighed and nodded. “I know, and I should, and I know that he’ll pull it out of me. And he knows that’s okay, once I get used to it.”
"I told you, I have friends outside of New York," Steve said with a slight smirk. He pushed himself up from the chair grabbing the two pair of shoes from the bench. He grabbed Wade around the waist before the older boy could scramble from the bed. He laughed in Steve's arms as the blonde put the socks on him. "They do like to talk to me occasionally."
"Blueberry?!" Peter looked like his eyes might pop out of his head. Mary was standing over the stove, flipping a pancake out of the pan and onto a plate. Turning around she put the plate in front of Peter, the dark little berries visible on the perfectly cooked food. Peter squealed and jumped, almost falling out of his seat. Tony rushed forward, grabbing the collar of Peter's shirt and pulling him back straight. "Daddy!" Peter turned his head to look up at Tony, and unknowingly into the camera. "I get blueberry pancakes!"
I am still in awe with how many of you read this, and like this fic, and all your awesome comments, and kudos and subscriptions and bookmarks. I smile every time I see the numbers and the words. So Thank You! Each and every one of you.
"I'm fine, so you just moved in here a couple of months again, then?" Tony said quickly, and Steve thought he would get whiplash from how quickly Tony changed topics and moods "Work with Mary at SHIELD then?" Tony looked around the apartment, assessing it? "Peter talks about you all the time, so Mary must trust you at least a little bit, but I find that I don't know that much about except from what Peter says. And I love my son very much, but he's five, and I can't exactly take everything that he says as gospel, not that I really take anything as gospel, but that's a whole different problem."
"I think whenever he gets to the end of one, Peter keeps asking for another," Mary told him, leaning against him. "And he can't say no to Peter."
"It's alright, Peter," Steve forced out. "Let me go find him. Can you stay calm for me?" He didn't hear Peter's response as he and Thor ran over to where Hulk had landed, dropping Tony to the ground.
"Tony." Tony blinked at the fingers snapping in front of his face and William was looking at him. "I need you to stay with me." Tony rubbed his face with his hand. "You know what this is, right?" Tony shook his head no. "These are anxiety attacks, and flashbacks."
"Pretty sure that you shouldn't mention that," Steve said with a soft chuckle, his arm going out to lay over Tony's waist, hand resting on his back.
Steve couldn’t help but look at Tony, seeing his brown eyes, warm, comfortable, feeling like home. Their breaths, quick and panting, matching up with each other, moving and feeling as one. Then he saw the sparks in Tony’s eyes, the color swirling and shining, and he couldn’t help but kiss him.
"Peter likes the reptile and arachnid displays," William corrected. Tony wrinkled his nose a little. "Wade likes the big animal displays."
Tony nodded and pushed himself up, grabbing his shoes by the door. He wiped his forehead from the sweat that had gathered from the nightmare before pulling his shoes on and tying them. Peter would probably be up by eight at the latest, and it was going to be Saturday. Tony remembered that Saturdays were pancake days.
"I'm done," Wade said, tugging on Tony's pant leg. Tony tapped the counter with a finger and Wade leaned up to put it there. As he signed his name he saw the receptionist pause before trying to hand the ID back. He flashed a smile, tapping the spot next to the clipboard with one finger, and then pushed the clipboard back to her. As he slid the ID back in his wallet he took Wade's hand again.
"We have to try!" Steve pulled Stark back up to his feet and looked the man in the eyes. "You are not going to give up on Peter!" That seemed to bring a little spark back to Tony's eyes.
Bruce had everything well in hand, and Tony was happy for it. He was now cuddled up with Peter in his arms, resting against his chest. He had thanked Coulson profusely, and let himself calm around the mere presence of Peter. He forgot all about Steve Lying Rogers, and just held onto Peter.
And then, Tony was there. He let out a little cry as soon as the door was shut and he saw her there. She trilled loudly and jumped into his arm, pushing her head against his neck. Tony squeezed her as tightly as he could, trying not to cry into her fur. “Vee, I’m so sorry, Vee. I’m sorry I wasn’t there, I’m sorry I wasn’t better. Everything’s going to change, my sweet girl.” He kept whispering the words into her fur until two doors closed, and Happy and Pepper had gotten back inside of the car. Tony didn’t let go of her though, and she wasn’t about to move from his arms. Her Tony was back, and she wasn’t going to let him go again.
"Should probably get some more food for dinner, then, going to need another party," Tony finally spoke up. "Most likely desserts. I'll go tell Bruce, I think he said he was going to cook. He’ll probably need to recruit some help." Tony turned around and headed out of the room. Mary glanced at Phil for a moment.
"Your Daddy is downstairs, with Mr Steve." Jarvis only ever broke from his code of names with Peter, knowing it would make him more comfortable. Tony had added a couple lines of code to the AI to make sure that Peter always felt comfortable, safe, and would be taken care of. "If you will follow the light, I will take you to them." Something lit up just at Peter's bedroom door.
"Daddy!" Peter cried out in between laughs, trying to hide behind Wade, who was then trying to push Peter in front of him in retaliation. "Captain! Help!"
“Ooooh, you’re hitting all the good points, Petey,” Tony said and pressed a hand to his chest dramatically. “Okay, so, Prince wise, he’s totally Philip. Being Sassy with his Dad, and bucking tradition, then fighting a dragon, and storming an impenetrable castle to save the Princess.” Peter nodded, and even Steve had to agree. “Hero wise though, completely Hercules. I mean, the movie could almost be modeled after your life, baby!”
"It had to be done. Those Helicarriers you helped with, they were going to use them to kill so many people." Steve ran his hands through his hair, remembering seeing some of the names that were on the list, part of Zola's algorithm. "They were going to take out those that could have stopped them, that could have stopped Hydra. Bruce and Mary were on that list, even Wade's name, and you and Peter." He shook his head a little as he tried to calm his nerves and anger. "We had to stop that from happening, had to stop that from ever happening again."
"Oh?" Mary was trusting him to handle their sons first crush?! Was she crazy?? "Why did she say that? Your Mama would know more than I would about Valentines."
Again, guys, holy frijoles! You guys really love this, and I can't believe it! It's amazing, and I hope to keep it as good as you like it. Thank you to Everyone who Kudos, who Comments, who bookmarks, and just Loves this story!
"I'm a lot of things, Brucie-bear," Tony told him, starting the car. "Let's switch out cars and grab the kiddo. Coulson will follow us over when they move Mary."
“Really, Pep?” Tony looked at her and she smiled, bring Jamie back down, holding onto her. “Like she won’t become a big ‘ole nerd like the rest of us.”
"Meg and I can finally get back to watching Buffy," Tony announced happily. "Seriously, I've been missing Buffy and Supernatural, I need my fix." Tony started pushing on Steve legs with his feet, getting him to move off of the couch. Meg was pushing on Bucky's back at the same time. "And don't come back here without someone either shedding some tears, or getting a black eye."
Steve sat up a little straighter. "Did you confront him?" He knew that Bucky was still fighting whatever conditioning he had been through, and they had let him go off on his own. He didn't want to add to another body count.
"Cause even the stars they burn," Tony's brows went up, not really knowing that Steve had a set of pipes on him. "Some even fall to the earth. We've got a lot to learn, God knows we're worth it." Steve took a couple of steps closer to Tony, reaching out to take one of his hands. "No, I won't give up." Tony let himself be pulled closer, gently.
Steve smiled at him. “Looked like you were having some fun with her, too.” Peter’s cheeks pinked a little. “Well, someone has to show her to proper way to have fun, right? And you’ve already been teaching her so much, no one else better to do it.” He wouldn’t tell Peter than he had overheard what he said about Jamie to Rapunzel.
“What have you been doing the past four or five years??” Steve turned on the loveseat to face Tony more. Tony was holding onto his phone in one hand, and a mug of coffee in the other.
“Are things not going as well?” She tilted her head. “I thought that you guys had been working on a system for call outs.”
Steve kissed Tony’s knuckles, and the camera switched over to Wade. “What….. What are we looking at?” Tony asked softly. Wade was sleeping sideways, his feet resting on the wall that his bed was pushed against, and his head and arms were splayed back and hanging off the bed. “He’s going to fall off the bed. He probably already has, honestly.” The camera then switched over to Jamie’s nursery, the camera positioned to see inside of her crib. She had managed to shuffle down to the end of her crib, almost looking like Peter in his own bed. She was on her stomach, back end lifted up a little, and cheeks pressed to the mattress. “Yeah, that one’s yours,” Tony said with a smile in his voice.
“Oh, I’m so glad I’m here for this,” Meg said quietly from the couch, and Tony couldn’t help but smile in agreement.
"Steve," Tony called out, and he swore to re-program Jarvis so that Rhodey never found out that he had used the man’s first name again. "Steve Rogers, come on." He watched Steve's hands twitching in response. "Come, Cap, you can do it. Whatever you're seeing, it's not real. You're at Stark Manor, it's June. I'm here, Tony, and Peter is in the other room with Wade. Mary is here with Phil, and Natasha and Clint are upstairs, and Bruce is just down the hall as well. Come on, open your eyes for me."
“Where’s Peter? I didn’t miss his birthday, did I?” Big brown eyes looked up at Steve, begging to let him know that he didn’t let down his son.
"And of course they should," Tony said automatically. "He's their grandson, and that is the right of all grandparents." Tony glanced over at the shell of the new armor he was still working on, then back to the current plans in front of him. "And for the record, I haven't bought him anymore presents."
Steve laughed as Peter tumbled back on his lounger, re-enacting a story about him and Wade. Tony sat up to interject, to stop the boy from getting too worked up and falling off the furniture, but with a smile on his face. Steve's phone went off with a text message, earning a half-hearted glare from Tony when he heard the 90's Boy Band ringtone.
"Tony?" Tony blinked when he heard Mary's voice again, and remembered that she had asked him a question.
"Well, I can't let you go back to your family, not safe enough yet," Tony said, She had probably figured that out, and there was no way that he would put the twins in danger. "So, we need to come up with a route for you, someplace to go that's safe."
"Over here are comics and cards," Peter said as he pulled Steve over to the first set of cases. He let go of his hand to get close to the glass, like the first time he had seen all of this back at Tony's Malibu mansion. "All originals!"
"Would it help if I gave my word that I'm not a serial killer?" Steve asked as he opened the door for them, letting her walk in first.
"Get me vitals, Jarvis," Tony demanded, staying close to Peter, not letting him go. He could see tears welling up in his eyes, brown eyes meeting Tony's. "I'm right here, bud, right here, not going anywhere."
'Close enough,' Tony thought. "Well, this big building has a lot of the stuff from the past in there. And we go to see it, cause it's cool stuff, and we can always learn from the past." Peter looked up at his Dad, wondering if this was going to be boring, but Daddy had never let him down before. "There's a new exhibit there, and I think that you're going to love it."
"I do!" Tony reached over and grabbed his tablet. "Jarvis, get a song queued up to play on Steve's playlist. Something with Mary in the title, let's get the message across."
"Two weeks ago," Tony answered automatically. "Peter's second day of school. Before that, I hadn't had a drink in four months, one week, and two days." Pepper raised her eyebrows, and Tony glanced over at her. "Summer break is always the hardest on my drinking habit."
It didn't take Peter long to warm up to Bruce, both of their shy natures recognizing each other, and then being combined with Tony's outgoing nature. They were working on dinner together in no time, the six-year-old asking Bruce all the questions in the world. Tony grinned, watching them, letting Bruce make something that he picked up from his world travels, the world travels that had encompassed Peter's attention.
Steve chuckled, standing up and leaning across the island towards Tony, where the genius leaned in, too. Steve stopped just before their lips touched. "Only if you're on time for dinner," he said quietly before pulling back, smirking, leaving a gaping Tony Stark.
The printer suddenly jumped to life, and Tony rolled over in the chair, grabbing it before Pepper could. The two women in the room watched him eagerly, both awaiting the results, and Tony looked at the paper, at the words and comparisons of the DNA. He of course had been thinking about what would happen with either result. If the results were negative, nothing would change, except that Pepper would probably put a couple more security black suits on him. This was the third paternity claim this year alone, and he could practically feel her glare when Mary had first walked in. And maybe this one they could keep Obie finding out about it, keep it from the tabloids this time so they wouldn't have to pay to have it not run.
He murmured soft words into Jamie's hair as he walked down the hall, but stopped when he heard muffled talking from Meg's door. He frowned a little and moved a bit closer. He picked up her cadence, a bit higher, but then there was a lower voice, and it wasn't from the TV. Steve glanced at Jamie then very quietly pushed the door open.
"It's true," Mary said as she came out, sitting in a chair next to the couch. "Do you remember how small and cute our little Peter was?" She noticed Tony looking around.
Tony closed his eyes and took a breath, then looked back out over the water. The sound of glass cracking drew his attention to the side suddenly, and he frowned. By the time he spotted the lines rapidly growing across the windows of his living room he was already falling through, the crash of breaking glass reaching his ears too late. He gasped, then tried to take a breath before he slammed into the water below.
"Probably," she nodded. "Since Tony has already come out about having a son we don't have to try and hide as much, and it'll be easier for Peter to see his Daddy." Mary leaned her head back a little to look at Steve. "And it's closer to work, and my fiancé."
"You're less likely to turn into a giant green rage monster," Tony said. "And I don't know how it would react with my arc reactor, so I can't take that chance." He grinned.
"Running out of time?" Bruce parroted back, but there was a little bit of concern in his voice. "What's going on?"
Rhodey was in the kitchen when Tony shuffled in, making them a pizza, but looking to see what they could make for dinner that would be toddler friendly. "Is he asleep?"
"Fury's dead." The words left Steve's mouth, and Tony felt his stomach drop. "The Winter Soldier." Tony heard Mary draw in a breath and Tony frowned.
Steve ran a hand through his hair, fluffing the much shorter hair a bit, and smiled. He really was looking forward to spending Christmas Eve with Tony. It would the first holiday since waking up in the future that he actually spent it with someone else, just for the sake of having company. He walked back into his room, grabbed the wrapped present for Tony, and headed for the elevator.
"If she didn't keep cavorting with him, it wouldn't have happened." Rachel crossed her arms over her chest, strong in her convictions.
Peter frowned, but not angrily, more confused, and looked down at Jamie. She was still holding onto his shirt, and looking up at him, giving him a smile. She babbled softly and Peter blinked. “Well,” he paused a little. “Good, then. Yeah. See, I said you needed to start walking. At least you’re listening to me.” He scrunched his face and Jamie tried to mimic the action with her own face. “Maybe, uh, listen, I’m older than you, but younger than Daddy and Mr Steve. So, maybe I should teach you what you should do first, okay? But, it’s not because I like you, or anything, it’s cause you need to learn faster.” Tony looked Steve. “And Daddy and Mr Steve still have to work sometimes. So, when they’re working, I’ll teach you stuff. Like walking. So, yeah.”
Tony bit his bottom lip a little, knowing what came just before his birthday. One year on from Loki's attack and the Chitauri, and New York was slowly repairing itself. Tony himself though, that was a longer process for him. "I don't know," he replied honestly. "I hadn't actually thought about it. What do you think we should do?"
"We didn't see anyone, Cap," Clint said, turning towards him, bow folded up and on his back. "Whoever was in here got away pretty quick."
Peter nodded as his eyes started to close. “Gotta do it before Daddy’s birthday,” he said. “We should take him to Disneyland for his birthday.” Tony lifted his head a little to look at Steve suspiciously. “Like you said. It’ll be fun.” The little boy snuffled further under the blanket, quickly dropping off to sleep safely tucked between the two men.
"Granpa is gonna be with his old friends," Peter said matter-of-factly. "We opened presents there already!" Tony could see Peter's eyes lean over to look at the presents on the floor, then he saw the tree. "Cool! Mama! Look at the tree!"
"There's always more when it comes to Hydra," Bucky said darkly. "I don't think there's a chance that's she's been brainwashed, or anything like that." Not like me, was left unspoken. "But, she said she'd understand if-"
Mary watched them from the hallway. Watch Tony work with Steve, watched him press against the bigger man, watched him have his silent breakdown. She bit her thumb to avoid biting her lip, but never looked away. Tony had nearly drown in that damn pool, and if Jarvis hadn't of alerted them, who knows what would have happened. She could see his nightmares and panic attacks getting worse, and she had glanced at the production number stamped on the newest Iron Man armor. Tony was cranking them out faster and faster, but she wasn't sure what she could do.
"Make sure you wait till I clear the roof. I'll buy you some time," Tony said, moving away as Stane thumped closer.
"I'll be back in a few days. Bye!" He waved eagerly and Steve waved back before the screen went dark as the call ended. He let out a sigh and dropped back on the couch.
"It's in France, sweety," Mary told him, then looked back up at Tony. "You just want to up and go to Monaco?"
“Papa lost one of your socks,” Tony whispered loudly to Jamie and turned back to tablet, using a foot to rock her back and forth on the wheels. “Sounds like someone needs more training.”
"Cleaner than the other we found," Clint told him. "Not even a dust bunny left over. Thinkin’ they started to move out of these places first."
Steve had been on alert for the past hour, pacing in front of the windows. Nothing else had come to attack the Tower, but there was still no sign of Tony. Bruce had a tablet and was running through the scans that Jarvis had taken from inside the suit, and before he lost contact. When Tony had started falling, Steve had taken off down the stairs, running, and some jumping, down all eighty-three flights. There had been startled walkers, and gawkers, who had been recording what had been happening in the air when they saw Iron Man outside. Pieces of the suit were still on the ground, but as soon as Steve got near them Jarvis was able to recall them all to the Tower. Well, all but two. Tony was nowhere to be seen.
Steve shift Jamie a bit to free up one hand and took the picture. He looked at Tony then back to the paper. "He was Private in the Army, dishonorable discharge, and served under a Colonel Wilson." Bucky was stepping over to them now, taking the picture from Steve's hand. "One ex-husband of Julie Wilson." They looked back at the picture of Julie holding onto a younger Wade.
"What happened?" Tony looked between the three that were around him. "Please tell me no one kissed me." Steve almost blushed, almost felt the little bit of heat climbing up his neck when Tony looked at him with that sentence.
"Who is he talking, too?" Pepper asked quietly, hearing Tony's angry voice, but not all of the words.
"Yeah, well, she takes after you." Tony smiled as he straightened in the booth, watching them head for the bathroom. He pulled out wallet to drop a bill on the table, and yelped when he saw someone sitting across from him where Steve had recently been. The man had his head down, face covered mostly by the ball cap he was wearing, and a worn looking jacket over his shirt. He was wearing a glove on his left hand and Tony narrowed his eyes a bit. "Sorry, I'm getting ready to leave, but I'm sure there's another table you can sit at."
Pulling the blankets back just enough, Tony slipped into the bed behind Steve, and wrapped his arms around Steve's stomach. He felt the fine tremble in Steve's body, and started to rub his arms a little. "Shouldn't take more than an hour to get you all warmed up," Tony said quietly, gently. "Then you can wake up earlier than anyone alive needs to be up, and I'm going to task you with making breakfast." Steve felt himself smiling a little at Tony's easy back and forth banter, with himself mostly. "But don't fall into Peter's trap of asking for pancakes, because it's not Saturday, or someone's birthday, and if Mary or I aren't there he'll try to get those sweet little flatbreads out of whatever sucker is cooking for him. Rhodey found that one out the hard way, and he won't be falling for that again."
Steve nodded. "Yeah. He seemed to have no interest with Peter, just Tony, and Mary and Coulson are back and have Peter now." But how could he watch Tony, without actually watching Tony?
Tony was a little flabbergasted by the end of his little speech. The inner child in him was vibrating, that Captain America wanted to share his pokemon with him. What the adult Tony saw was that he may not be actually losing Vee. She wasn’t his anymore, and he had allowed himself to fall for the illusion that she might have been, that Captain America was dead, as everyone else had thought. But, having Vee come and go as she wished, well, that was better than what he thought would happen. He nodded, not trusting his voice, hands clenching around his mug of coffee, and Steve smiled at him. That melted his insides a little.
"I'll be there in a couple minutes, yeah? Have to clean up the dishes from breakfast real quick." Peter nodded seriously at Tony's words. "Then we can spend however long with Mama as you want."
Bruce was running some blood tests, and they both noticed when she made the smallest of whimpers when the needle was used to draw blood. He warned Steve that he wasn't that kind of doctor, and he really didn't know much about kids, but that socialization would probably help.
"Right," Tony nodded. "I remember that now. Hey, what's the plan for Christmas, again?" Tony wouldn't say that he was actually kind of looking forward to Christmas this year, but he would be lying if he didn't say that he was excited to have a reason for it this year. Mostly he wanted to make sure that Peter had a memorable time.
Tony had to bite back some tears, a tiny, tiny, smile on his lips as he understood what Yinsen was saying. He took a breath and gave a little nod. "Thank you for saving me," he near about whispered, but the Doctor had heard him.
“More than is probably healthy,” Tony said with a smile. “Now come on, Granma and Granpa have already said that they’re making dinner, and I want to go and claim cuddle rights with Peter.”
He grabbed a hot pad and opened the oven door to pull out the ruined cupcakes, then froze when he saw the smoke rising up to the ceiling, approaching the smoke detector. Oh, that was something he didn't need to explain to Mary. Tony hurried over, vaulting up and over the island, and using the height to grab at the cover of the smoke detector as it started to beep, and ripped the battery out, almost tearing it off the wall.
"They're gonna teach us how to use the light sabers, then we can have our own fights." And as if they needed to demonstrate, the two boys jumped up on the bed, and started pretending, holding onto nothing but air, but they were making the noises themselves. Steve couldn't help but laugh as he watched them.
"Tony, you're so sweet," Mary said with a little smile. "It's a very simple recipe, I don't do anything special. All I do is add some vanilla extract, and some oils from orange peels."
Julie stood up quietly and Steve easily moved his arms around to take Jamie from her. She let out a quiet noise of distress, picking up on the melancholy feeling, and laid her head on his chest. "How are you doing?" Steve asked the older woman quietly, not wanting to wake the boys. "How's Peter?"
, but it wasn’t natural. It was like liquid moving in the air, something moving underwater, and it was probing around the arc reactor.
Peter's grandfather had grabbed Peter's overnight bag, as his grandmother helped the little boy put his backpack on. He walked over to Tony and held out the bag, the genius taking it automatically. "I'm sure Mary already filled you in, but Peter takes a bath at 7, and he's usually in bed no later than 9," Mary's father told him. He seemed to be a little warmer towards him than Mary's mother was. "He usually likes a story before bedtime. He wasn't sleeping well while you were, gone," Tony tried not to wince and feel guilty about that, "but we're getting him back on a schedule. He may have a nightmare-"
Tony was about to open his mouth when Rowan let out a particularly loud burp for her size. "Ha! Tony grinned, lifting her up in his arms. "I win!"
"Sir," Jarvis said quietly, almost gently, from the ceiling. Tony glanced at his watch and nodded. He pat Mary's hand gently.
The door to the jet opened as the steps were pushed up and secured. Mary's mother, Rachel, stepped out first, followed by William, and Tony started walking forward to greet them. Rachel looked at him, but accepted his offered hand to shake, followed by William.
"Hey, Petey," Tony said to the sleeping boy. "Time to sleep in a bed." Peter made a sound of protest, Tony rubbing his back. "Yeah, I know, but it's late and you're sleepy."
“Was I not straight forward enough?” Tony smirked at him, pushing his shoulder with his foot. “Go, find us later. I promise, we’re not moving far.” Jamie seemed to make herself comfortable on top of Tony as he spoke.
"I didn't want to have to pay for the replacement glass," Steve cracked, drawing a tiny smile from Tony. "You were sick, and I wanted to help you get better." Everyone had been careful not to mention the words 'pool' or 'drowning' around him, but he knew that all of them were waiting for some answers.
Tony had pretended to be asleep when he felt Peter wake up in the morning. After dinner Tony had made sure to take Peter to his bedroom to sleep, once again staying next to Peter the whole night. Peter had a routine on birthdays, and Bruce had promised to help him make the blueberry pancakes for Tony in the morning. So when ten minutes previous Tony felt Peter waking up, he had closed his eyes, relaxed his body, (hiding his tablet), as Peter carefully climbed down from the bed, and wandered off to the kitchen.
Tony groaned a little, but nodded, slowly, carefully, heading down to the workshop. Ever since coming up to New York he had put a lot of time into updating the old workshop. He basically replaced everything that Howard had, and tried to make it look almost like the Malibu workshop.
There was banging at the door now, and yelling. It was happening a little faster than Tony thought, but it seemed they were being discovered already. The blast and the boom from the bomb threw him off, and he could see the shocked look on Yinsen's face as well.
They sat on the couch, Peter starting to give off little snores, before Mary spoke again. "In the morning, I was going to make apple pancakes."
His body was tired, he felt sluggish as he crawled into his ignored bed. Wade was asleep in Peter's room, both sleeping peacefully, and Wade's mom calling after dinner to wish her son a good night. Tony flopped down on his stomach, mumbling nonsense into the blankets, closing his eyes.
"Really?" Tony gave her a disbelieving look. "I'm not happy about it because now it means that you have someone else to depend on when it comes to Peter." Mary blinked, not expecting that answer to come from Tony. "He gets to stay down on your floor, living with two parents at the same time, like any other normal kid. I know I'm not going to be the first one to be called when he has a nightmare, or wants to have a sleepover with friends, or comes home with an A on his test. I'm not the first one anymore." Tony couldn't stop the words from coming out now. He didn't notice how his chest was heaving a little, breathing heavily as he kept rambling on. "And it's stupid, because it's selfish, but I liked that. I liked being the one you would have to call, or turn too when it came to stuff with Peter. It's because I know I can't be the same full-time parent that you are- Yeah, I know we've talked about it, but it's still true. I'm not you." Tony looked down at his knees, that he noticed he had brought up closer to his chest.
“You are a philistine!” Tony declared, wiping his hand on Steve’s bare chest. “You licked me! In a non-sexy way!”
“You’re stinky too!” Peter giggled, then managed to slip down, rolling away from Tony. Tony gasped, putting his hands over his mouth in shock. “I said it!” Tony sat up, going to get up and peter laughed and took off running, Tony right behind him. Peter slid into the bathroom and shut the door, giggling on the other side.
"One day, you might be able to pull that off more convincingly." Tony let Coulson take the sleeping boy this time, dropping a kiss to Peter's forehead. "Goodnight, Petey." Coulson gave him a nod and a little smile, putting Peter on the bed and covering him with the blanket. Tony watched him sleep for a moment before leaving the room, going back to Mary's room.
"Why don't you two go put the leftovers away?" Tony suggested to his boyfriend. "Then you can do the whole private talk where we aren't around."
"No problem," Steve nodded, putting the groceries on the table. Peter had already wandered into the kitchen, ready to help Mary with the groceries. He was well trained on chores. "If you need anymore help let me know, I've gotta check something back at the apartment."
“I think my stomach jumped out of my mouth,” Steve mumbled, resting his head against Tony’s, closing his eyes. “And then, it went back up, and the rest of my organs followed the trend my stomach had set.” Tony pushed out his bottom lip in sympathy, running his hand through Steve’s hair. “I think I left them all on the ride. I am sans organs.”
“Were you listening at all?” That was the annoyed Team Leader voice. Tony was sure that not only would Steve be talking to him about the implants, but Cap would be talking to Iron Man about proper training etiquette.
Tony had stopped for a bout a millisecond when he heard Steve say 'we', but then remembered that he had agreed to help with the rebuild. "The way Peter's going, I might have to redesign the entire thing."
"No." Tony shook his head, and tried to pull away from the grip of the cold hand. The other hand of the creature flew up and grabbed the side of Tony's head.
Steve tried not to feel guilty. He knew there were things that they kept from the kids, but it was because they really didn’t need to know about some of the dangerous things that happened; like when Tony had been kidnapped, and eventually brought home Jamie. They didn’t need to know what had happened to Tony though.
"You and Daddy should come down here," Peter said with a smile, and Steve fought to keep his from faltering.
"I wanna share." Peter grinned. Tony blinked then leaned in to take the bite that Peter was offering, and the little boy happily turned back to his plate. Mary sat down at the other chair at the table, putting down two plates on the table for them.
Tony hummed and nodded. “He was gonna try and help, and I think he went into my head. Then, like it was all set up, and I was headed back, but something stopped me.” Steve tilted his head a little, looking at Tony curiously. “I don’t know who, or what, but it stopped, him, from finding me again. I, I really can’t explain it too much, Steve, because I’m not sure what I remember or not.” His head was brought to rest against Steve’s chest, fingers carding through his hair and rubbing at his scalp. “There was two much magic around, and then Strange, and Loki, and,” Tony paused, frowning. “There was someone else there. The Maximoff girl?” Tony tried not to tense up when Steve didn’t deny it. “Then there was just, pain. It was all too much noise, too much happening.” Steve kissed his head again.
He grabbed his Starkpad and pulled up the latest scans and results that Bruce had uploaded. He looked at the x-rays first and wrinkled his nose. His lungs were already shifted and looking funky with the arc reactor in his chest, but now they looked cloudy, and just, not right. They were looking better than the first images that were taken. Bruce had him on an intensive medical regiment to treat the pneumonia, and while it sucked, it seemed to be working.
“Aww, you were trying to protect my boys day out,” Tony said, putting a hand to his chest. He grinned as Bruce just rolled his eyes. “I’m not here to analyze details yet, I just wanna take a look. Steve is probably down trying to get Bucky to hold Jamie again. Or trying to get Peter to actually look at her.” Bruce gave him an appropriate sympathetic look. “My boyfriend is an idealist.”
"I think the point of a surprise is that they don't tell you what's going to happen. Peter, don't you even think about it." Tony smirked a little. Whatever Peter was about to do, he was all Tony. Mary never failed to remind him of that.
Peter looked at him with big eyes, still curled into Tony's arms. Until he suddenly leaned forward, putting out his hand towards Hulk. "Hi, I'm Peter," he said quietly, shyly.
"Sure did," he said with a grin. "Mr Steve is a really good cook." Peter nodded along with the statement. "He said that he'd take us swimming later today, too."
“Yeah! Aw man, it was so cool!” Wade said with a grin. “I was jumping over the couch, and rolling across the floor, and right under a coffee table! It was awesome! Although, Bucky wasn’t too happy about it, so he’s teaching me how not to do that anymore, and he’s gonna teach me and Pete to do it right!”
"Barton and Romanoff came back." Tony leaned against the counter, crossing his arms over his chest and raised an eyebrow.
"Tony actually has no say in what Mary chooses to do with her life." Steve knew this best of all, Mary being his Handler. Especially since he had figured out who Tony was, Mary didn't have to hide anything about Peter's father, and how close of friends they were. "Tony didn't even know what Mary was doing until hours after it had happened. I was there, with Peter, when Phil got the call. Tony was at the Expo."
Tony wrinkled his nose and looked up at Steve. “I’m thinking that if we go, we’ll have to take Jamie. Which normally, no big deal, but our lives aren’t normal. And I don’t think that it is a wholly awesome idea to take our still jealous son-“ Steve froze and had to pull away the razor from his skin for a second. He turned his head to look at a wide-eyed Tony who had caught what he had said. “What I mean to say, is that if we go with the four of us, he’s still jealous of her, and I don’t know want to, well, you know, it’s important that they both have fun, and I’m not sure, Peter is-“
He leaned back in the chair by her bed, tapping on his arc reactor. "What the hell is wrong with me? This is what I'm worrying about? I have to worry about Peter, and make sure that you're alright, and, Phil, and that's not even on top of the destruction to the city, and did you know about Wade's mother? I mean, you probably did, you were always better with other parents. I'm really kind of anti-social when you think about it. Not good at personal interactions, at all." Tony let out a breath. "I can just continue on, cause we said it, what happens in the gym, stays in the gym. That's a legit excuse, right?"
A week later, during one of the times that Vee came up, she had a box sliding behind her. Tony raised an eyebrow and walked over, removing the ribbon from around her body and picking up the box. She trilled happily as Tony pet her, and then joined with the Gems. He opened the box, and the scent that came from it had attracted their attention. Steve had made some pokepuffs just for the Gems. Tony blinked and took out each one, that had a name on the wrapper on the bottom, and gave it to each of his girls, including Vee. The penthouse was full of delighted chrips and shrieks at the taste.
As he felt the movement of Steve's lips against his, he was aware of the differences then, how the even heat from Steve's lips pressed against his, and their lips seemed to form to each other, locking into place. Tony felt the breath from Steve's nose, hot, coming out a little more ragged every second. Steve's tongue brushing against Tony's lips was a sensory burst all on its own, and Tony felt his mouth moving on its own to let Steve in, unable to stop the moan that came from his throat, the vibration itself almost enough to bring another, as their tongues met.
Vee did not like Obadiah Stane. More than she disliked Howard. Howard of course thought nothing of it, knowing how particular the Eevee was when it came to people. She didn’t snub Maria, tolerated her, but never sought her out. She did like Jarvis and his wife Ana though. That was probably because of the way that they treated Tony, how they practically raised him better than his actual parents. When Ana died, Vee mourned with Tony and Jarvis, and when Jarvis died when Tony just a teenager.
"You said that that you were taking me to an apartment?" Mary wasn't sure if he was asking a question, or making a statement. "Am I not going to a military base?"
Wanda tilted her head, looking past Steve, making him move just a little. Her brother, Pietro, stepped closer, but Wanda put a hand out. “The girl still lives,” she said, and Steve’s eyes narrowed a little. “He kept his word.” Her eyes shifted from Jamie to Tony.
"Mr Stark, some pictures of you were released online less than an hour ago, claiming that you have a son-" the rest of her question was drown out by the uproar of the crowd again. Tony hated being right on the first guess. George had just straight released them to all of social media, not doubt with a little news station help.
is an old board game very popular in the 30s when Steve was a kid and it was discontinued from print in the 60s. It was reprinted as Inside Moves in the 1980s so Tony got one for his birthday from Jarvis, and he loves it so much so he knows it was called Camelot before. Too complicated. sorry :)))
“I’m sorry, for being a jerk that night at the bar,” Steve says and buries his nose into Tony’s hair.
He ditches the daily board briefing and dares to tell Pepper that he is too busy for their one on one. He grabs his good reading glasses instead and digs through all the information Bruce has sent him after their quick chat in the middle of the Stimulus Package mayhem two days ago.
are working on the reports,” comes Tony’s voice from the other side of the room, “because the rest of us are already buried under the pile of work you’ve assigned to us.” Steve’s already irritated with the smugness before even turning to look at Tony. “The technology analysis of the debris is on your desk though so you can get chugging along.” Tony points his half-chewed pencil at Steve. He winks mischievously and then frowns and the flare of anger bites at the back of Steve’s throat, just like always.
He feels exhausted as if he'd run for miles in extreme heat. He feels hollow, pointless - he could really use some sleep.
He starts with massaging the lowest part of Steve’s abs, too close to parts down below, and Steve’s dick twitches and pulses, filling his head with images that should not be there at all.
Right now though, Steve hides behind the wall of new items on his list. He spends over 10 hours on phone calls and video conferences with so many people he loses count. He chats constantly, with his new team - because he now has a team of four interns and one real-life SI-employee assistant - and spends most of his leftover brainpower to figure out their complicated references, which they use in their professional communications even. He hides behind the long messages with Ms. Potts going over the list of congress members and senators who are willing to help lift the ban on distilleries making hand sanitizers and comparing the details of Nestle and Kraft food bank proposals. He hides for a whole day behind being busy, too busy to spend five minutes putting some food together to take to Tony’s room and get the nose kiss he misses so much it almost hurts, instead of obsessing about it with every beat of his heart.
Steve’s heart had skipped a beat when Tony came out of his room wearing a charcoal, three-piece suit with a red tie and all Steve’s been thinking about since then is if he would ever get a chance to loosen that tie, undo that first button, and kiss Tony’s throat. The idea hasn’t lost its novelty in the past hour and a half, as Steve’s mind has been bouncing between SI’s share price going down and journalists being mean and insensitive in a politically correct way, but back to the tie and Tony’s Adam’s apple, always.
No one yells. Dr. Stark says things, the words sliding over Steve’s skin at first before starting to make sense at some point, soft and gentle and reassuring. “It’s okay, it's perfectly fine. Steve, don’t worry about it. It’s just a reaction, no big deal. I’ll just need you to put your feet back on the stirrups and hold still for me. Do you think you can do that?”
Tony finally stops twiddling his thumbs and looks up. He looks twice as pale as Steve remembered and Steve kicks himself for not having thought about bringing some kind of food over.
This is not fair. Tony does not know which one is less fair though; the fact that such a simple question is too overwhelming because no one has made him cookies since Jarvis or the fact that he keeps swallowing around the stupid damn lump in his throat but can’t manage to get any words out. He tries to bring his hand up to run them over his face, but the right hand is no position to be used and the left one is wrapped in little fingers. Tony wonders if Nat’s just holding his hand to keep it in place because of the IV, but the sensation of someone actually holding his hand without pressing his fingers in some sort of stupid code is surreal.
Steve shivers as he steps on the balcony, as the wind is too chilly for an April night in Houston. He sits back on the chair, staring at the half-dark towers in the skyline and wonders if anyone out there is stuck in a more bizarre situation than he is right now. Breathing in the humid morning air, trying to calm down and think, he realizes that he has no clue, what so ever. He has no idea how he should disclose a national secret - one that people need a Top Secret clearance to access the encrypted files on a thumb drive about - with a guy he has casually fallen in love with. How is he gonna sit Tony down, and explain that the dead guy of Tony’s dreams happens to be him, Steve Rogers, a broken boy who’s not even from Brooklyn anymore, and the longest he has gone without a screaming nightmare or day-time panic attack is the past 5 days that he has spent in Tony’s arms? That he is not amazing or awesome, and definitely not brave, that he is nothing like Tony thinks, that he is in fact just a pair of long legs in a too-tight star-spangled uniform.
She tucks him in, turns the night light on and puts a glass of water next to the half-eaten plate of cookies on the nightstand. She then smiles and kisses Tony’s cheek before she walks out, leaving the door open so Tony can call out if he needs anything.
out of all the superheroes is outright hilarious. Steve sighs and wishes he actually was Batman because he seems to be Tony’s favorite, even if his mask seems too uncomfortable and he has to fight in a cape, which Steve does not even want to begin to think about.
Ty lets go of Tony’s waist, fucking finally, and comes a little closer. He looks Steve up and down, and he is close enough for Steve to have an excellent shot of punching that smile off that ridiculous face but Tony's delicate fingers seem to have turned into steel around Steve’s arm.
“I think we are really lucky tonight,” Bruce says as he finally looks up. “The fingers are not broken either. Just dislocated.” He gently touches a point in between Tony’s two middle fingers. “I am gonna give you a shot of Bupivacaine, here. It should be a very minor sting but the local anesthesia helps with the pain as I realign your fingers.”
Dr. Stark nods back, puts his tablet on the stand near the door, and smiles. “I’ll need to check your penis now, to examine its physical appearance.” He then takes a step forward and kneels in front of Steve, obviously to do as he said,
Jarvis turned to face Tony and smiled. “You did the right thing, you saved his life. Doing the right thing, caring for others is never stupid.” He kept his eyes on Tony and his smile warmed the edges of Tony’s heart a little bit. “Talk to him. Tell him how you feel. He might want this too, Anthony, just talk to him.”
Tony smashes his piece with the dessert fork so it doesn’t look so intact. He is not sure how long the pretend eating strategy will work, before he either starves to death or Ty figures something out, but he is not looking forward to either of those.
Tony licks his bottom lip and tilts his head to the side. “To make you mine,” he says, his voice suddenly hoarse and the fire alight in the pit of Steve’s stomach sets his whole body ablaze.
Tony shakes his head before he brushes his lips, softly against Steve’s. “No one I know has a friend who can make 45 do something he doesn’t want to. That's a hell of a friend though, I wish I actually had one of those.”
There are mentions of severe abuse against orother omegas, which ends up with one missing and one imprisoned, but it's pretty brief.
“Thank you, I’ve got it,” Steve mutters, staring at their hands intertwined, because ‘yes please help me get dressed’, or ‘I don’t want to get dressed’, seem like unacceptable answers.
Steve wakes up confused, with a vague vibrating sound, and Tony’s voice talking. He opens his eyes, his brain speeding up the waking process, and he sits up in the warm but empty bed as he looks around for Tony.
Tony can’t think. He is floating or flying; he might be drowning and he can’t be sure if he remembers his alphabet correctly.
Steve scratches his chin absentmindedly. “Be paid I guess? If it’s either pay or to be paid, maybe I could get the money and give it to the person who I was supposed to pay for sex?” and he rubs the back of his neck again and smiles, melting Tony’s heart in his chest, with his adorable argument.
“Looks like we’ve found Mr. Barnes,” Tony said and handed the telegram to Steve, without taking his eyes off the crashing waves. He didn’t need to turn and look at Steve to know that his bottom lip was trembling from the cold sea breeze, not that he could do anything about it. Steve would not agree to wear Tony’s jacket over his too-large, thin shirt, or head back to the barracks and stay in the residence anyway. The stubborn little thing, Tony thought fondly, half of his weight fire and the other thunder with a burning spirit that would spill out of that beautiful mouth as burning words from between those thin, parched lips that Tony would never get to press to his own.
He wobbles through Steve’s foyer after what must be the longest elevator ride of history and wonders if he should just go back. He can catch the elevator before the door closes and go straight to the workshop to lock himself up for an extended period of blackout protocol. Steve will be disappointed, for sure, but not as much, definitely not, when this whole thing comes crashing down.
He seems to have shed a skin, or grown another one, as he can’t seem to stop smiling all the way through breakfast and finds the time, all of a sudden, to come to Tony’s room many times during the day, with or without food, and waits 5 whole minutes one time, for Tony to finish his video call so he can get his nose kiss before he goes back to his room.
He steps forward again and his hand on Steve’s shoulder is like fire and ice, rain and sunshine, calming and exciting all at the same time.
Like a kitten, Steve thinks, with his dark floppy hair, the way he’s pressing his face into the pillow Steve was sleeping on, making little cute noises as he shuffles against the covers, pushing them aside and turning onto his back.
Steve blinks, and the flush that’s coloring from the tip of his nose to the hem of his t-shirt goes even darker.
The beautiful lines of his body, the muscle tone in his abs, his mighty fingers that can set Steve on fire and calm him at the same time. Those laugh lines, so ridiculously adorable, and his chest, the scars Steve has loved from the beginning without even knowing why, the hollow where his face fits perfectly.
“I know that we live in the same city and we can see each other all the time. I just don’t want to sleep under a roof, you don’t sleep under. I actually don’t want to breathe under a roof you’re not breathing under. I don’t care if it sounds more insane when I say it out loud, but I want to take you to my office every day. I want to hold your hand when I reply to my emails. I just… I can’t let you go.” Tony tightens his hold as if Steve is going to run away now. As if Steve’s got anywhere else to be tonight, or ever.
“Santa Maria is stuck too close to the black hole.” Commander Romanoff taps on the hologram of a starship not larger than a dot almost lost within the magnitude of the black hole. “Comms is patchy and half of the ship has lost life support. We are the closest starship with rescue and battle equipment but we are not close enough to get to them in time.”
“Blueberries it is then.” and he nods to Tony again. “Sam? Any chance you can make some of your famous PBJ?”
It feels right to trust Tony, his brain finally manages, just like it has always felt right to trust Iron Man. It’s the same instinct that has kept Steve’s heart a little warmer since that first image of Iron Man on that hospital TV, that Steve woke up to from his long, frozen nightmare. The same sense of faith, same wash of calm, same ease and comfort that made Steve lean over to kiss Tony that first time.
The gauntlet fingers trail down Steve’s throat and the metallic cool soothes the burning blaze on Steve’s skin. The fingers slip further down, brushing over Captain America’s
“Yeah, I think I’d better sit down,” Steve mumbles as if talking to himself. He walks around the room, passing all the couches and dining chairs, and comes back to stand in front of Tony. “This can’t be true. It’s either a setup or I’m still asleep. This is too random. This… this is impossible.”
“It is what's happening to you, Tony,” Steve says as gently as his shaking voice allows. “You might be the first omega I’ve seen in my life, but I can feel it. I know it like I know you’re sitting here with me.”
be seen half-naked and covered in bruises. Not both in the same night. Both would be too mortifying.
He is being polite, right? There is no way that this creature, this body, those lips, that ingenious first-time-ever blowjob, is not after Tony’s gratitude. That just can’t be, or at least, it has never been like that for Tony, ever.
This can’t be right. Sounds more like a joke, to be honest, but with his spinning head and the hollow in his chest, Steve needs to hold on to the one thing he has done well today, even if it’s completely made up, and he’s not imagining this, definitely not, the way Dr. Stark presses gently on his fingers.
“I guess it is. But the fact that these were the first rifles SI ever provided for the civilian market was -sorta- the big deal. I guess.”
Tony’s face twitches into a shadow of a lopsided smile. “I had no one else to call. Can you believe it? Pepper’s in Malibu with her shiny new job and Rhodey’s deployed somewhere top secret, he calls every other week to tell me he’s alive.”
“I am a big boy and I was NOT distressed,” Tony cuts in, “I can take care of myself and everything was fine.”
No one is counting so they can’t tell if it’s been five minutes or not, and Steve doesn’t seem to mind Tony’s weight the slightest bit, so they stay like that for many many minutes, with Steve’s hands digging into Tony’s sides, his body holding Tony against the wall, weightless and breezy; the way things need to be all the time.
Dr. Stark lets go of Steve’s fingers, slowly. “Be safe,” he whispers, before he turns away, grabs the tablet, and leaves Steve sitting on the examination table, half-naked and full of longing.
” Steve winks too, and Tony’s heart flutters in his chest. He would love to play a round of quirks of quenching with Steve, or a thousand rounds, it is obviously a super cool game if Steve suggests it, but Camelot? Now
“Of course.” He smiles, so that’s what lips thinly pressed together and narrow eyes can also mean, and Tony does his best to smile back, blaming his painful cheeks for the way the tears well up in his eyes.
Tony’s insides shake a little as Captain Rogers pulls over along the kerbside, quite abruptly, and cars probably honk, but Tony is too distracted with the color that’s spreading on Captain Rogers’s cheeks to hear anything.
“I’ll … um...check up on the food. Kitchen. Dinner ... need to check on it. Excuse me.” He looks at Captain Rogers and then at Ty. Ty nods, still not looking at him, so Tony turns to the door and walks out of the room.
“Do you mind if I wash you?” Tony whispers into Steve’s ear before biting down on it. Steve nods, slowly, and it might be the crazy joy of all the first times or the way Steve’s blush gets even darker with the nod, but it makes Tony’s heart race in his chest, his head spinning for a few seconds. He takes a deep breath, and then another one, to calm himself down. The last thing he wants to do is pass out right now, or lose control. He has a task, a top priority mission, and he can do it. He could get through washing Steve’s gorgeous, flawless body without coming apart from the insane burning sensation that is running through him by just holding Steve this close.
Tony’s been asleep for a while, curled into Steve, his hair brushing on Steve’s lips and his breath warm and rhythmic on Steve’s neck.  Steve smells Tony’s hair absentmindedly and thinks about his question.
“I... ” Steve tries, but words are tough to get out with the way his head is swimming, “I… me…” he struggles as Tony goes deeper and deeper, every point of contact morphing into a pleasant source of stimulation.
“But it’s not just for you,” Tony sighs. “I kinda… really like to… you know … touch you.” and he presses his nose to Steve’s shoulder, “It feels like an honor, to tell you the truth, that I’ve been allowed to in the first place. So anymore of it, is … kinda … yeah. I’d love to.”
Thank you to Ria Rose and Succubus Kayko and JehBeeEh for beta, guys I can't do it without you thank you soooo much <3<3<3
“I just…” he finally turns back to Tony, with a distant look in his eyes, as if he’s not even seeing Tony, and yet his gaze burns through Tony’s core and calms his nerves somehow.
“I can’t stay here, SHIE--my employer can’t afford this place. They are working on getting alternate accommodation for me right now, so I’ll be out of your hair as soon as possible.”
Tony shakes his head and laughs, making something bubble in Steve’s chest that he can’t quite name. “You jumped off a tower, landed on a pile of robot scraps, and almost cut your head open and
Tony closes his mouth, and opens it again, panting for air. “Heat? That’s impossible Steve, no one’s gone into heat for centuries.”
“Are you gonna at least take me out first? I know I’ve already been to your place, but I totally want to fix the wrong impression that I’m an easy omega or something.”
Steve goes from room to room and reads the hotel guide about the penthouse. The sheets, the antique lamps, the original Nicole Eisenman hanging in the living area that Steve would have sworn was a replica. Even the tumbler he just had water in is by Waterford, worth as much as a whole set of living essentials to furnish a small studio, and that makes him more confused and frustrated.
Tony cries out loud and digs his nails into Captain Rogers’ forearm; not once but twice. Nat’s fingers draw gentle soothing circles on his back and wipe his tears before anyone can see them as Bruce realigns each finger before splinting each one to the one next to it. And it might be the sweat drops on Bruce’s forehead or the way Captain Rogers’ scent is all wood and leaf again or maybe he just feels the pain more drastically, now that he doesn’t fear for his life, but despite many deep breaths and all his efforts to stay calm, this hurts more. Much, much more.
Large hands slide under his body and strong arms take him out of the trunk slowly and gently. For a second, Tony thinks he might die from the humiliation of being so weak and so exposed. Among all the mortifying moments of his fucked-up life, which are quite a bit, being found curled up in the trunk of a car is probably the worst of the worst. He doesn't want to know what Captain Rogers is thinking as he presses Tony to his chest and walks around the car to put him down on the back seat. Tony tries to sit up straight but his stupid back doesn’t cooperate and he ends up stretching his legs along the seat and leaning against the side window. Captain Rogers kneels by his feet and looks at Tony with that same concerned look. He opens and closes his mouth a few times but doesn’t seem to be able to get any words out. He runs his hands on the back of his neck and his lips twitch in frustration. He then stands up and, well, starts pacing around the car.
“You,” he finally says and the relief in Steve’s features is more precious than any belonging Tony has ever had, even if it’s there for less than a heartbeat, and is replaced with fabricated disbelief and cheeky smiles.
He sits on the edge of the chair by the dressing table and holds his head in his palms. He has 6 minutes exactly to come up with a plan on how to lay things out without freaking Tony out. He can alternatively keep his head in his hands and pray hard for a miracle to spare him from having to say the dreadful words out loud, at least for tonight.
“Okay, listen, I’m a dead man for showing you this and letting you in, but if Tones gets laid from it, maybe he won’t be so angry,” Rhodey said, showing Steve the not-a-door-door that led to Tony’s secret workshop.
Shortly after Morgan had finished painting Tony’s nails, Steve came in, and Morgan jumped to her feet and ran straight for him.
“I’ll try my best,” Steve laughed, leaning back and settling in next to Tony on the couch. He put his feet up on the ottoman in front of them and let out a contented sigh.
His mouth was cotton. His stomach was in excruciating pain. He knew he could numb the hangover with more alcohol, but his personal stash in his room was out, and he almost felt he deserved to feel the symptoms.
They made they way to the garage, where Tony guided them to his 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spider and jumped into the driver’s seat. This was one of Tony’s fanciest cars—but that didn’t mean anything. Steve was pretty sure Tony didn’t own a cheap car—there were no Honda Accords in sight, anyway.
Despite the mild confidence that Pepper instilled in Tony by the end of their phone conversation, he let several months pass before even considering doing anything about his feelings.
He slammed his fists into the ground. When that yielded no relief he tried it again. And again. And again. And again until his hands were covered in dirt and the tears had soaked his shirt.
But that option was taken away from him now. He instantly kicked into ‘downplay’ mode without realizing.
“Don’t you go lecturing me on how I spend my money, Rogers,” Tony laughed. “It was worth it to see the look on the kid’s face.”
“Alright—enough of this. Both of us. We waited too long already and we aren’t going to let our own personal insecurities hold us back any longer. I, personally, am stoked this is happening,” he said matter-of-factly.
“Because for someone with super soldier senses, Steve did not scan the room before barging into to talk to Nat about it and I was sitting right there. He had already gotten out the ‘Tony and I kissed last night but then he ran away and won’t talk to me’ before he saw me. So yeah, thanks for coming to your best friend about it, Tones.”
Tony looked up, feeling Steve’s prolonged gaze on him, and caught his eye. They both felt the electricity crackling between them—this weight of things unsaid—the way they continued to tiptoe around everything important. He offered Steve a small smile and—
As they barreled into the penthouse Carol tossed Steve with one arm towards Tony and Pepper—Tony who was now out of his suit like the idiot he was—while firing a powerful photon blast out of her other hand at Stane.
Steve was surprised to see Tony already at the Sunday night Family Dinner when he arrived. Tony was always late and Steve was always early—but tonight he had him beat. And on top of that, he was helping Carol and Bucky prepare dinner.
It had taken years, but Tony had worn him down. Now Tony’s worst behaviors were endearing. His sassy attitude was actually funny and not offensive. And Steve could detect the genuine compliments and kindness hidden between witty remarks. Steve had lost his resolve—a stone face did not suffice anymore.
Later that evening, Tony finally made his way out of bed and curled up on the large living room couch. The compound was relatively quiet and empty for a Friday night but Tony figured everyone probably wanted to get out for once especially since the last mission went so awry. The team deserved a break—knowing Nat, she likely convinced everyone to go out to a karaoke bar to blow off steam.
“You wanted to talk?” Steve initiated, unable to cope with the intensity of the atmosphere. He was tired of avoiding these conversations with Tony.
“Buck, don’t be. I had thought Tony and I made up but—but these are my mistakes he’s upset about. Not yours,” he explained. And then, as if Nat’s comment had just reached his ears, “Wait, jealous?”
“I’d say I would rather be dead, but I’m so high on these pain meds, I think I like this better,” he laughed. As he tried adjusting in bed to get a better look at her pain jolted through his left side. Tony let out a yelp and Natasha was at his side, hovering over him, and pushing him flat on his back.
A lot of civilians had already been evacuated from surrounding buildings, but the top floor of the Avengers Tower—the penthouse—was not cleared. It was being held hostage by Stane, who was wearing a knock-off Iron Man suit himself.
Thankfully, everyone in his life had worked extremely hard to keep his AA meetings and divorce away from reporters as much as humanly possible. There was still a brief attempt here and there, but none of them ever stuck.
Tony leaned into Steve completely but his smaller frame was easy for him to support. They got to Tony’s room and Steve helped him into bed. He stepped away and returned with a glass of water and a bottle of Tylenol that he set on Tony’s bedside table.
Instantly, Nat and Bucky switched off the assassin portion of their brains and stepped fully into their ‘Steve’s best friends and protectors’ shoes. Bucky sat up, idly rubbing his neck from Nat’s attack, and she crossed the ring to rub Steve’s arm sympathetically.
“What? You’re not understanding, I’m trying to apologize, because all of this is my fault. I failed you as a leader and—“
Scott and Nat started piling the table full with the food they had cooked. Everyone was present except Tony and Peter. Steve assumed Tony had stopped to pick up Peter on the way, and even if he hadn’t, Tony was rarely on time.
They locked eyes, breathing heavily from their silly antics. Silence stretched out between them for what felt like forever—only the sound of their breathing filled the air. Tony thought he may be crazy, feeling the electricity crackling against every point of contact between their two bodies, but the hazy look in Steve’s eyes hinted that maybe he was feeling it too.
Tony eagerly hugged the kid back—god it had been over a month since he had seen him last. And the last time he saw him he was shamefully drunk and off kilter. His heart dropped—he needed to make up for that. And apologize. He seemed to be apologizing a lot lately, but that was probably a sign of growth or some bullshit like that.
Tony locked the door behind them and ushered them over to the far left corner. It took a total of two seconds for Steve to realize what was displayed on the walls—it was his art. A collection of his best sketches and paintings were perfectly hung up in a real art gallery—in Brooklyn, no less. There were sketches of the New York skyline, Avengers Tower, the Iron Man armor, paintings of Bucky and Nat dancing, Morgan sledding down a snow covered hill on his shield—it was all of his best work.
“Yeah. Yeah, I did,” Tony said, wringing his hands together in his lap, looking down at his feet. “Yesterday—yesterday what I said—well really, my behavior these last few days, it has been unacceptable.”
“Tony, go for it,” she said, as sure and determined as she ever had been. “You deserve to love and be loved in that way. And I think you’ll be amazed at what happens between you and Steve if you try.”
“Steve, I’m sorry. God—from the bottom of my heart am I sorry for the way I reacted when I found out you knew about Bucky and my parents. I should have seen what a difficult situation that was for you. Instead, I let the rug be pulled out from under my feet. And I played right into what Zemo wanted. And for yesterday—using that against you again—I’m sorry.”
“Tony, if you were lonely,” Steve said, trying to bridge the emotional gap between the two of them. “You could have come to us.”
“If Thor had shared his toys sooner, maybe it wouldn’t have taken so long,” Steve joked, elbowing Thor in the side who returned the gesture tenfold.
“I’m sorry, okay? I’m the leader, it feels like this one is on me, and if we had lost you I wouldn’t know what to—“ a lump in his throat cutting him off, Steve adverted his eyes, and clenched his fists in his lap.
“You know Steve, you do not give yourself nearly enough credit for how phenomenal you are. I always thought being Captain America would get to anyone’s head—apparently not. You’re not humble, you’re downright self-deprecating. Believe me, I know it when I see it. I created self-deprecating,” Tony said, launching into a speech that Steve had no idea where it was coming from.
Before anyone could speak, he flopped down on the couch and held up a hand. “I know. I fucked up. But if it makes anyone feel any better, this hangover has been hell and really put me off alcohol instead of making me miss it. I don’t plan on drinking again.”
Thank you so much to everyone who encourages me, leaves comments, and kudos! They are all a writers fuel. Please share this story with anyone you think would like it. Just a few more chapters to go! Woo hoo! It is all coming together.
“Have you ever stopped to consider that maybe Steve is aware of all of this? And that he doesn’t care? That he wants to build something with you and work through whatever comes your way, together?” Rhodey asked, crossing his arms and leaning against the wall.
“Mr. Stark, you can talk to me—you know that, right?” Peter’s voice was so earnest it practically snapped Tony’s heart in two.
He laid there, eyes closed as the Fentanyl swept over him, and the pain slowly subsided again. When he looked up, Nat was still standing over him, concern plastered on her face. She was so beautiful. Sometimes Tony forgot just how stunning she was. Particularly because he endeavored not to see her that way anymore—both because she had grown to be like a sister and because he dared not face the wrath of Barnes. But here, high as a kite on painkillers, those trepidations faded away.
Little did he know that as he raced to help Tony off the spaceship the night Carol brought him and Nebula back to earth, with each footstep forward, that desire unthawed. By the time he held Tony in his arms it was a roaring flame in his chest.
“I’ve, got to uh, step away for a moment. I’ll be right back,” he explained, setting his beer down on the edge of the pool table and walking off without further comment.
“The plan is strategically placed mistletoe above Tony’s doorway after he leaves his room to head to the party.”
“Not only are you one, you’re the poster child for the rest of us,” she teased, smirking into her coffee cup when Steve finally put his paper down.
Bucky and Nat started to put all the food on the table—this was how they ate every Sunday night, family style, with the dishes passed around for everyone to scoop their desired portions onto their own plates. It reminded Steve of the one Thanksgiving his mom had saved up enough money for them to have a proper dinner. That was one of the reasons Sunday nights were his favorite—he never missed a single Avengers Family Dinner—it was something he never had growing up. Bucky, who was sitting next to him, caught his eye and smiled—as if he knew. He probably did. Steve almost never had to explain anything to Bucky out loud. That was one major benefit to having a friend who came from the same era he did—the realities of a harsh life back then were shared and something they both remembered in their bones.
There was a weight to the apology Tony owed Steve and he was painfully aware of it. This apology was not just about his hurtful words from yesterday—it went back much further than that. They had never truly discussed what went down between them. And they needed to if there was any chance of moving forward.
“Tony—hey, you okay?” he asked, shutting his sketchbook and standing up. He was at Tony’s side instantly.
“Evil schemes, huh? I can’t imagine you…scheming,” Tony replied, raising his eyebrows suggestively. Steve’s cheeks went pink.
Seeing him now, in the kitchen with his arm around Tony, elicited a visceral desire to protect her friend. A primal anger—both for Tony’s safety and for Steve’s heart (which she knew was currently being broken). It took an alarming amount of self-restraint not to remove Ty’s arm from Tony and break it in half.
He wrapped Tony’s arm around his neck and carefully propped him up as they started walking towards his room. Tony was limping slightly, but with each step it felt easier to put weight on his leg. Thankfully, it looked like he would not need extensive physical therapy and instead more physical activity daily would suffice.
Tony reached up and buried his hands in Steve’s hair, holding him close as their kiss deepened. Steve broke their kiss to slip out of his suit jacket and Tony sat up at bit while Steve worked his jacket off, too. Tony unbuttoned Steve’s dress shirt quickly—the skillfulness of his mechanic’s fingers coming incredibly handy. They shucked it off to the side with Tony’s shirt that Steve eagerly yanked off—almost ripping it in the process.
Steve woke up early the next morning to make a massive breakfast for everyone who was staying at the compound this weekend. He knew that besides Tony and himself, Nat, Bucky, Thor, Bruce, and Rhodey were around. It was always fun to do something for the team but if he were being honest, he needed the distraction from the constant thoughts of Tony’s body resting against his from the night before.
Steve knew he had good qualities as himself, too. He was not fully delusional. He prided himself in his tenacity, honesty, loyalty, and compassion. But those were not unique qualities, especially not among the Avengers. So how much did they matter really?
Jesus—he had not thought it possible, but Steve looked even more angelic when deep asleep. His face was completely relaxed and it was nice to see him truly at peace like that. Steve was all muscle—strong biceps and rock hard abs—but sleeping like this he was also long eyelashes against soft cheeks and messy, golden hair. Tony took extra time to commit this image to memory for safe keeping.
“Yeah—but you’ve got Steve acting like a confused school boy so I would think that even you have reached the point of needing to talk about this,” Rhodey retorted.
Tony owes Bucky an apology. And soon after needs to consult Rhodey about some feelings that he can't avoid.
“Yeah, sure,” Steve whispered, slowly and carefully slipping into the empty side of Tony’s bed. He laid on his back, staring at the ceiling, rigid.
Once Friday announced that Tiberius has been picked up by the car, Tony stood up and stomped his way to his room, promptly slamming the door shut and ordering Friday not to let anyone in.
He hastily stood up and excused himself to go put his dishes in the sink. Nat was hot on his heels, observant as ever, and setting her things in the sink next to his. They kept their backs to the dining room table, Steve trying to regain his composure, and Nat wanting to keep this brief moment private. She placed her hand over his, looking up at him with sincerity.
“I shall go first!” He reached under the tree and pulled out a large box, handing it to Bruce. “It is for you, my friend!”
“I’m sorry, I’m not good at this. It’s been hard being here—seeing my own struggles present in other people’s stories. It makes it…makes it more real, you know?”
Had it always been this way? He remembered when he first met Ty in boarding school decades ago. When they had both just been shipped off to school by fathers that saw them as nothing but inconveniences they found each other. Back then he had thought they found refuge in one another.
But before he could make another sarcastic remark, Steve was leaning down and his lips were moving against Tony’s. The rest of the world melted away and they melted into each other. Tony had always thought that if Steve initiated a kiss it would stun him—that he would freeze before finding his way into it—but that was not the case. No, the reality was that Tony had been dreaming about this moment for so long that the second he felt Steve’s soft lips on his he feverishly kissed him back without a moment’s hesitation.
She rolled her eyes, but nodded in agreement. “He’s right, Steve. Relationships are not all sunshine and rainbows, especially not when they’re new and you’re figuring things out. But you and Tony have chosen to do this—and you two have never half-assed anything when it has come to the other one—including damn near killing each other over miscommunication and misplaced priorities.”
“Well—I just wanted to give you something I’ve been working on for you. Y’know, as a gift,” Steve stumbled through his words, the nervousness dripping off him, and a light blush creeping across his cheeks.
“Well, Tony is coming fresh out of a divorce and a recovering alcoholic, maybe you should give him a break.”
“I actually hate them, you know? The galas,” he continued. “They’re fake. They make me hate myself—who I pretend to be when I’m there. And everyone there wants a bite of me—money, science, my brain, sex—they all want something. It is draining. Dehumanizing. They don’t see me, they see what I have to offer.”
“Peter—god, no, we are definitely talking about that later. No this is,” Tony took a deep breath. “This is about the last time you were here.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’ll keep that in mind next time,” Steve replied, pouring them both a glass of water once they reached the kitchen.
“I—uh—yeah,” Tony grumbled, embarrassed by how creepy he did look, and he walked in. Reluctantly, he plopped down in the armchair across from Bucky and tried to mentally prepare himself for the conversation. “What are you reading?”
When Peter walked off to call May, Tony turned to look at Steve who was still in his personal bubble and holding onto him as if he might fall over otherwise.
Hearing Tony sound like that cracked his heart in two and hallowed scooped out every good feeling he had ever experienced. Saying no was not an option—despite the way it made something at the base of his spine swirl.
“Fuck off, yes you did,” Nat interrupted. “It has been an international news story. If you knew about the divorce, which you did and that is how you weaseled your way into his bed, then you knew about the sobriety.”
For the most part, Steve stood at the edge of the crowd with Nat and Bucky—a quiet observer. He was not nearly as good at the public persona and schmoozing as Tony, Sam, and Pepper were. Even Thor seemed to be in his element, but that was likely due to his proclivity for showing off and being the center of attention.
Unfamiliar voices are worried about him. Someone shouts something about hospitals and someone else shouts back about alpha consent. Overwhelming distressed scents fill his nose trails and he wants to open his eyes and say that he is okay before he goes into complete darkness again but he is just unable to. He can’t hear anything. He can’t feel anything. He is there but he is not at the same time and he wonders if this is it; if this is the end.
“Steve, I have to tell you something,” Tony sighs as he pulls back a little to look at Steve’s face. “I’ve been meaning to tell you since...forever, but it’s a huge deal, and I’m sorry I didn’t, but I'll tell you right now.”
‘We’, as if Tony had any part in the way Steve took him to the end of the skies and brought him back, safe and sound. Which he did not have a part in, except for existing. Or for daring to buy that first drink for the most beautiful human being he had ever seen.
Steve looks down on his lap, absentmindedly. “Um… must be a few hours.” He then looks back up wondering if he should hold onto the front of the gown that has a nice long tear off-center, as awkward as it might look, or let go and have his balls and half of his dick on display, now that Dr. Stark is looking at him again, and he is not invisible anymore.
Steve lowers them both on the bed and pulls the covers up. It smells like heaven under Tony’s blanket and Steve can’t help but smile as Tony lays his head on Steve’s chest and reaches over Steve’s body to draw soothing circles on his back.
He has a couple of fractured ribs so he will be in pain with every single breath for a while, which is nothing new. It has been so long since Tony’s chest has not hurt with every fucking breath.
Steve’s careful and tender. His lips are soft as a feather, and he presses them around Tony’s cock with a perfect amount of pressure, which is crazy consistent. It’s slow and smooth and, oh God, so gentle that Tony wants to cry, and yet it feels like nothing Tony has ever felt before. It’s perfect.
He can’t do this anymore, and wants to continue forever. He wants it to be over right now and yet he wants to hold on to the lightning that’s stirring inside for the whole of eternity.
in the world that would try to keep him from holding Steve and kissing his tears away; now or ever. He leans forward and pushes through what feels like a physical force just as Steve leans in too and something shatters, maybe a window in the distance, as thunder rumbles and lightning flashes, and the wind blows, too close as if it’s swirling right between them.
Except that nothing is as it was when he fell asleep. Tony’s sitting on the floor, his arms around his knees, rocking back and forth, as the mix of sweet scents gets more and more intense by the second. Steve drags his feet across the cabin, holding on to the console table to keep steady and stops a foot from Tony, pained by the amount of will he has to put into keeping his hands to himself.
Nat’s face is not neutral and calm. Her hands are shaking as she unbuttons Tony’s shirt so Bruce can take a look at the bruises on Tony’s chest and back. She doesn’t flinch from the bruises and the fucking bloody shirt though. She grabs Tony’s hand when Bruce gently presses on Tony’s ribs and it’s surreal and Tony has never felt that way before but her face softens as Tony presses her hand back.
“I would have called Bucky,” Steve says matter-of-factly, “and he’d show up in about, well, 20 minutes to two hours depending on traffic, to save my neck.”
He almost goes crazy waiting. Part of him wants the wait to never end, not looking forward to what will be next. The other part wants to get this over with. To peel the bandage off and deal with the bleeding and move on. He doesn’t know how long he circles in his mind going back and forth about how stupid he is to even be here. A second maybe, or five  hours, but he finally hears some noise. There is an intense movement followed by violent pain all over his body, and for a second, he wishes he could simply disappear from the face of the earth, right in this moment, so he wouldn't have to go through with the rest of it. Then there is fresh air and a blinding light that moves a bit before it freezes on Tony’s face so Tony brings up his left hand that he can still move to shield his eyes.
He can let go, and be sure that he won’t fall, he can be a shivering mess before Tony’s eyes, with his brain foggy and his spine on fire.
Tony. They end up talking for two hours about the most random things, like the cat Steve takes a photo of every day in front of the shop, and Tony’s annoying neighbor who sings opera at 5 AM, even if Tony keeps teasing Steve, and insisting that no one uses the telephone to communicate these days.
He’s standing inside the supplies closet with his back carefully leaned against the door, as he’s hoping for it to open any minute; he’s been hoping for it to open any minute for a little bit now - enough to be all worked up and antsy, and quite painfully hard, but not enough to be furious and leave, slamming the door loud enough that a certain person can hear from his workshop across the hall.
Tony tosses his StarkPad on the nightstand and stretches his arms over his head. “So, Steve, I’ve had a question since this afternoon, and I am just gonna come right out with it, if you don’t mind. Do you… happen to… have a crush on our president?”
Tony brings Steve’s face to him and puts their foreheads together. It’s him, it’s absolutely him, flesh and blood and alive and he is hurting like hell, because for whatever reason beyond Tony’s comprehension, he thinks there is a single thing wrong about him. “It’s you,” Tony says, kissing Steve’s lips, his cheeks, his chin, “it’s absolutely you,” he repeats, as his fingers comb through Steve’s hair, “you’re here. You’re actually here, and in my arms by fucking accident?” He kisses Steve’s eyes, his forehead, his nose, as his hands go lower, touching Steve’s neck, shoulders, and digging into Steve’s back. He pulls Steve into himself, breathes him in, and God, oh God, he is as cold as ice. Tony presses closer to Steve, even if just half an inch more, enveloping Steve’s body with his own, hopelessly wishing that there would be some warmth left in him, somewhere deep down.
Tony breathes in and out, a couple of times, before he turns to the alpha, still holding to Steve’s arm. “Ty, I need to have a chat with my boss here,” he turns to Steve, something burning in his eyes that Steve can’t quite figure out.
Ready is a big word, Steve thinks hazily. It means composed and prepared, and in the right state of mind, and Steve is not any of those, but if Dr. Stark thinks he’s ready, then he must be, so he nods and does something with his face that hopefully looks like some sort of smile.
kind to me, there is no way that I get to keep this. Keep you.” Steve wraps his arms around himself and shivers. “I can’t. I just… can’t lose this. I can’t go back. I wouldn’t know how to survive. I don’t even want to try.”
Tell me what you think please, your comments, even the shortest ones give me the motivation to keep writing.
with the flamethrower while high on oxygen deprivation!” Tony raises his arms. “Nat? A little help? A dose of sanity, please?”
with a bit of sarcasm,” Tony quips, and can’t help the adoration that bubbles in his heart at the way Steve’s lips turn into a thin line, despite the circumstances.
“Not if you don’t want to. But why? You don’t have to sweetheart, I don’t want you to push yourself into anything for me.” Tony runs his thumb on the sides of Steve’s face and something presses at his heart when Steve closes his eyes and leans into his touch.
Steve’s light-headed and filthy, covered in Tony’s come and slick, and that damn longing is stinging deep inside his belly again. He wishes, so bad, that he could keep his arms around Tony for a little bit longer; that he could smell his hair, kiss the side of his neck and watch him smile, real and wide just for once.
echoes in Tony’s head as his heart starts to beat in his throat and he wishes so hard that he could just turn the time back to when he’d not just told a complete stranger that he has a friend so close that he wants to call right now, who happens to be an alpha. Tony keeps Captain Rogers’s gaze though, because there is no turning back, hasn’t been since last night when the complete stranger opened the trunk, and it doesn’t matter if Tony can’t figure out Captain Rogers’s expression as he stands up and walks a step forward to stand in front of Tony.
“Why, I am sorry, am I distracting you again?” Tony says, but his words are barely playful this time. He can’t hold it together either, Steve muses, the way his erection is pressed to Steve’s back, and he is as breathless and flustered as Steve, even if Steve can only judge with the quarter of his brain still operational. Steve’s hands get back to work as if of their own accord with the gentle reminder though, and Tony hums happily as he gets back to orchestrating Steve’s perfect pleasure.
Steve’s heart skips a beat and his head spins a little. It’s not something he has ever imagined possible before, but if Tony wants him to be proud of his wounds, he should be able to figure out a way to do exactly that.
Tony smiled back at Steve and watched as Steve slipped off the bed, and caressed Bucky’s arm as he walked past, without even looking at him, without even thinking maybe. This is
