There was movement underneath Dean's shirt, so Castiel crouched down and moved it away to reveal a tiny harvest mouse.
"You have something that I want." Michael answered. "I have come to retrieve it."
April was a beautiful omega. She was smart and funny. Why didn’t Castiel want to be with her? What was wrong with him?
The rest of the meal was eaten in silence, though it was mostly because Dean's cooking was absolutely amazing and Castiel was stuffing his face too quickly to talk. Dean was an excellent cook.
"And your brother?"
He almost started to fight again, but he managed to catch his behavior. His new dungeon cell was not unlike his old one. It too was warded. The demons undid his chains and pushed him roughly into the cell. They locked it and mocked him, safely behind the bars. Castiel sat in the corner of his cell and ignored them. Eventually they grew bored of Castiel and left him.
Castiel hung up without waiting for a goodbye. He stumbled to the front desk.
“No, I asked him and he said he didn’t feel pressured.”
“This whole house has only four bedrooms?” Dean asked.
"Uh." Dean blinked. "Yeah. That a problem?"
“What the fuck?” Dean murmurs to himself. He checks the receipt, wondering if maybe Castiel wrote down a number with a little, “Call me!” string attached. There’s nothing.
They were in a meadow surrounded by thick forest. Maybe it was lucky they had landed there instead of in the forest. Perhaps the branches would've broken their fall, perhaps they would've made it worse. Either way, it was more dangerous to be unconscious in the woods than a meadow, so Castiel decided it was a tiny fracture of good fortune.
Castiel sighed. He did know it. “What else would you like to know?”
“He did.” Castiel said.
“Please, have a seat!” Mr. Kelly gestured at the empty spot. Castiel sat down next to April.
The knight’s mouth twisted as he fought back a snarl.
"They're never taking me back there." Dean said with such a certainty that Castiel grew worried. What measures would Dean resort to in order to stay free from the demons' grasps? Likely Dean would give his life up to prevent that. Castiel did not want to see this happen.
"Way better." Claire confirmed, making Castiel laugh. He would be the first to admit that his cooking skills were less than amazing.
"It's not your fault." Castiel said. Without much thought, he reached forward to grab Dean's hand and squeeze it. "I am just as much to blame."
"Fine." Dean grumbled. He turned and walked out the door.
"Nah, it's fine, man." Dean still did not meet his eyes as he rubbed at the back of his neck. "I don't really know."
Sure enough, there was their picture. Dean laughed when he saw it. Their hair was blown back and crazy and their cheeks looked red. Dean studied himself for a moment. He could see his wide eyes and grin.
Dean tentatively pushed himself up and towards Castiel. Cas took his hand and led them towards their room. Dean ignored Gabe and Sam’s teasing calls. They were idiots.
"We've got a lot to talk about."
stay safe out there :)
"Castiel? Is Dean okay?" Ellen asked, her voice muffled.
Blearily, Castiel shook himself from his dream. He blinked up at the ceiling, trying to gain his bearings.
“He was.”
“I wouldn’t know.” Castiel replied with a hum.
"That's very sweet of you." Castiel said.
What did that mean?
“Bye, Adam and Sam and Mr. De!” Claire called again.
hard to focus. He drew away and took Dean's hand. They stumbled towards the backdoor that led to the rest of the house, both unwilling to stop touching of the other and still trying to move as quickly as possible.
Slowly, tentatively, Dean moved his arm down.
“No!”
-cap out-
"Are you a Nephilim?" Dean asked.
He got out of the car and then went around to release Claire from her car seat. She held his hand again as she skipped to the front door.
The man draws back, looking hurt.
"Because it is clear to me that you would benefit from some care." Castiel answered bluntly. He tried not to be too straightforward when he was speaking with others as they tended to find it unpleasant or rude, but Castiel thought it was important that Dean know the motivations behind Castiel's actions.
“He has amnesia.” Castiel pipes up, sounding small and resigned. He doesn’t look up from his bare feet. “He doesn’t remember anything.”
Castiel’s foggy brain focused then. He blinked several times and looked from Dean’s tear-streaked face to the doctor at the end of the bed. He stared at her as she held up a small, pink thing.
“Are you sure?” Castiel asked. “You smell rather alarmed.”
raven: intelligence, insight, mystery, prestige, alert
“Ugh, enough. Let’s get to the living room.” Dean led them past the entrance and to the living room.
"And did they?"
Castiel just said goodbye and left with Claire. He didn't want to think about what Gabriel said, it was pointless.
it made no sense for Dean to want to ask out Jimmy, but he was starting to overthink everything.
He gazed past the city walls at the surrounding hills, thinking wistfully of how easily he’d be able to get back home if he was riding alone.
“I am so sorry.” He apologized, clearly embarrassed. “I swear I never curse in front of her, I have no idea how she mislearned ‘duck.’ "
So Dean and Cas did talk about it.. sort of ... sorry not sorry for the cliffhanger lol
how to feed him!
“What’d I just say?”
Castiel had made a dreadful,
The hummingbird launched itself off of Castiel's head and flew in front of his face. He shimmered and turned back into his human form.
The demons led them up through the building, but not to the throne room. Instead, they stopped in the middle of some hallway in front of a tapestry. More demons were already gathered there, Alastair included. He sneered when they saw him. Besides Castiel, Dean tensed. Castiel could not help the hackling of his feathers. His wings expanded on their own accord in an futile attempt to block Dean from Alastair's view.
"Yup." Garth said, head bobbing in a rapid nod. "You're some hotshot leader. You went missing a couple of months ago."
Dean blinks. “I’m literally sitting on your dick right now, Cas. If I didn’t want this, then I sure as hell would not be here.”
Castiel stared at the sky for hours, watching as the stars passed.
“Yes!”
their discomfort.
Later in the evening, after Castiel had already gotten ready for bed, he received a text on his phone.
No, Dean was going to get settled down somewhere in Center Heaven and he was going to find a nice mate that would take care of him, and together they would have a very fulfilling life.
“Yeah.” Sam said, eyes drifting from Dean to Castiel. “We’ve been here for a week, actually.”
"I can't wait to meet the family!" Gabriel chirped.
Okay so.... yeah this was very rushed. I have to admit (and apologize) that I totally lost inspiration for this fic and I have had no idea how to continue. This ending is the way I had originally planned, just less drawn out. I apologize if it's anticlimactic, but I wanted to make sure I at least finished it up instead of leaving it as a wip forever. Thanks for your patience and interest in the fic
“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Gabe cut in, “Congrats on the kid. Hip, hip, hurray. What are we doing later?”
“Please, Cas. Please try. I don’t ever want you to give up because of me.”
Around 10 in the morning, the phone began to ring. It made Castiel jump and glance at it, dread building. He'd been so hopeful.
“It’ll be fun! There’ll be wine!”
"Thank you, Mr. Kelly." Michael said silkily, making the hairs on Castiel's arm stand on end. "I do not know if I could get away for a weekend, but the holiday is a fine idea."
Castiel picked her up and hugged her tightly. “I missed you too! Were you good for your uncle?”
* * * * *
“I'm sure you’ll live.”
Dean let out a frustrated sigh and kicked at a pebble. He'd only been with Castiel for a couple of days, but he'd taken to following Castiel around the garden.
"But Amelia just left!" Gabriel protested.
"You're repulsive." Castiel snarled. "I will burn you to the ground."
Dean groaned and Castiel's ears rang.
Perhaps she was right. Castiel
“Dean,” Cas asks, “Is everything alright?”
Dean sucked in his breath and took a half step back. He didn’t go any farther though, his eyes trained on Castiel.
"Earth." Dean answered. "Why?"
All of a sudden he’s much too aware of how he looks like crap. It’s ridiculous how easily he starts to care about his appearance when Cas is involved.
Castiel nodded, heart sinking. “I suppose so.”
"Dean." The man replied. He stuck his hand out and shook Castiel's hand warmly.
Castiel stared at both of them.
Castiel said sweetly, “Of course, dear.”
"You're not very perceptive are you?" Dean asked drily. Castiel felt his anger flare up once more and he opened his mouth to say that
Eleen rolled her eyes. “Yeah, yeah. You get on out there and rescue your pup. I’ll clean up the rest of these dishes.”
Castiel comes back the next day. Then the next day. Then the
“Well, I’m going to get going,” Dean said. “I’ll see you later.”
"Mother." Castiel said, biting back a sigh. "How may I help you?"
“Alright.” Dean said, nodding at himself in the mirror. “I’m ready.”

Bobby snorted. "I figured as much. Why'd you do that?"
yes another cliff hanger what has gotten into me lately???
“I’ve changed my mind.” Castiel declared.
"You can be an idiot sometimes." Gabriel said bluntly.
Blood dripped from his mouth and down his chin.
"My legs hurt." Dean answered in a whisper. "They're... injured, and I haven't walked this much in a really long time."
"It sounds lovely." Castiel said softly, pressing his hand gently against Dean's. He felt his stomach flutter when Dean's right hand flipped so his palm was next to the back of Castiel's hand.
Why did Alastair tell Castiel they had killed Gabriel?
Dean was having the same problem, it seemed, because Castiel heard the other angel huff and sigh and shift every few minutes.
"She's beautiful." Castiel said.
Castiel drew back, startled.
Castiel felt his wings flittering nervously (as much as they could). He didn't understand what Dean was trying to say.
"Yeah, about that. I really do not see how it's possible that you could do that. No offense, Cassie, but there's no way you could have bested him." Gabriel said.
"It's what I heard, too." Garth agreed.
"There is no reason for you to lie about your condition." Castiel tried to keep his tone as gentle and comforting as possible. "I know what Alastair has done and I think-"
Claire took nearly ten minutes before she looked to the beta. "Could I have more than one color?"
Dean looked
"Better?" Gabriel asked.
Immediately, pain and fire coursed through Castiel and his writhed. He put everything into keeping his wards up, but they were quickly failing.
Castiel and Dean wordlessly nodded, both of them dazed.
Dean shifted back when he finished with his strawberries. His mouth was still red (much redder than Castiel would expect from a few berries).
"Hey, there's no need to apologize, Cassie, really. I'm just glad that you called me."
“He tricked you into it.” Castiel commented.
The horn sounded again, very closely.
There’s only one way to find out.
"Here." Castiel moved his hand to his pocket and waited for Dean to move into his pocket. He felt Dean shift around for a second, then his head peaked out of the pocket and glanced up at Castiel.
. Dean got to be the pilot the first time, but he went several times and tried other roles. The last few times, only Charlie came with him because the others had grown tired of it.
Castiel would sooner die than lose him.
“Cas, the wine!”
"I'll be going soon, are you certain you're prepared?" Castiel said. "Claire may seem alright now, but I believe she'll get a bit fussy after I leave."
Ignoring Dean, Cas slowly nods.
Castiel smiled somberly at the ground and shook his head.
The girl’s dad sent Dean a grateful look that was quickly lost when Claire started babbling again.
"Were you consorting with demons?" Castiel finally questioned.
“It wasn’t the worst, but I did feel like I was being smothered.”
Castiel nodded and went back to taking inventory.
I absolutely love caring dean (and so does cas)
"Nothin' much." Benny said. "Glad to have you back, hasn't been the same without you here."
It seemed like both several hours and only a few minutes later when Castiel finally found himself released from the tug. The pain in his chest had changed into immense pressure. Castiel opened his eyes, unaware that he'd closed them, and took in the sight around him.
“Sorry.” Dean says again.
“You must be here to talk me off the ledge.” Dean mused.
Dean gulped. “You wouldn’t?”
"You don't gotta do that, Cas." He said. "I can't ask you to give up your life for me."
Castiel was deteriorating rapidly. Dean, on the other hand, was not. While the omega weakened, Castiel could see that it was at a slower pace than himself, which reaffirmed his belief that Dean was not an angel, but a Nephilim.
But like Cas had said, it wasn’t that strange to appreciate a good view.
Thirty minutes before he was due at the restaurant, Castiel drove Claire to Gabriel's house. He unbuckled her from the car seat and let her run to the door to ring the doorbell. Immediately after, she squished herself up against the wall and out of sight from someone looking straight out the front door. When Gabriel opened the door, Claire flung herself in front of him and shouted "boo!" Castiel did not think that Gabriel was scared or shocked at all, but he brother played it off and grasped at his chest.
"Yeah, it is." Dean said, nodding.
Dean groaned. “Not you too, Sammy.”
"Have you met any other prisoners since coming here?" Castiel questioned.
The room fell silent.
Dean let out a startled chuckle as he began to smile. The dad’s eye were blown wide and his face was cherry-red.
For Gabe, a bunch of chocolate. Gabriel ate almost exclusively sweets (chocolate specifically), so it seemed obvious to Dean that chocolate would be the perfect gift.
The others came back two at a time with flushed faces and wild hair.
"I'm sorry." Castiel said once they were alone. Dean's bare skin was against his chest as they laid on their sides, broken only by Dean's wings. Castiel's wings were wrapped against Dean's.
"Little birdie told me that you're terrorizing everyone here without your coffee fix." Dean teased as he held up the cup.
"Before I make you tell me what you've been up to, I'm going to let Sam know you're here."
There’s one thing that he knows without a doubt, but he doesn't know what to do about it.
“Definitely not.” He says, chuckling.
Castiel shook his head. "No, I do not think so. Our bond has also been destroyed, and whenever I try to reach out to Dean through it, it pains me."
"Pardon?" Castiel asked. "What do you mean?"
Hey, whatya know, only a day late... hopefully I'll get a chapter out this coming week but no promises... I got finals in two weeks and then I'll be out for summer!
It was rather fascinating to watch Dean's pupils dilate and flicker down to Castiel's lips. Castiel licked them on instinct.
Dean chose to be a guinea pig that morning, which Castiel thought was unfairly adorable. Dean's coat was tan with white banded around his back and face. Castiel walked slowly along the pathways of his garden so that Dean could keep up with him. Dean's nose twitched as he sniffed at every plant.
"Are you sure?" Castiel whispered.
Dean made them sandwiches for lunch, then he watched Disney movies with Adam. Sam wasn't able to spend more time with them, unfortunately, since he had to study, but Adam was happy anyways. His scent was still young and mostly unspecific, outside of general emotions, so Dean knew that Adam was happy, though there was nothing more.
Inexplicably, Castiel found himself thinking about Dean. Dean was always so sweet and kind to Claire, even though she wasn't his, biologically. But then again, it was Dean's job to be a caretaker of Claire, and he wasn't in a relationship with Castiel.
"Hey, hey, hey!" Gabriel held out his hands and backed away. "Chillax, man. I swear I'm not working with the demons, though there is one I have been with since, you know, the failed attempt to bust you out."
His eyelids began to grow heavy, and as much as Castiel tried to fight it, he was utterly exhausted from fighting Michael and the events that had followed.
of insults, but it’s designed to be cruel.”
He stared up at the ceiling, for the first time dreading the prospect of everything returning to normal.
"Yes," Castiel rumbled against Dean's delicious skin, "perhaps that would be best."
Dean ordered their meals and they got it to go so they could eat on beach. Adam munched away and talked as he ate.
“Heat?” Dean repeated, not quite understanding it.
“What? You mean it wasn’t forced with Amelie.”
“That’s not fair!”
"Claire, sweetheart," Castiel said, "Papa needs to breathe. Loosen your arms just a bit there."
"Get yer ass over here and take a seat." Another man, an older one with a cap and greying beard, ordered. Castiel walked over and sat down a seat away from them so he could turn towards them without being too close.
Jack moved his arms as much as he could. Castiel lifted Jack a little higher on Dean’s chest so Jack could reach Dean’s neck. Jack pressed his face to Dean’s scent gland and made muffled noises.
Dean swallowed. The last thing he wanted was to be around a bunch of strangers.
“But besides that, it just didn’t feel right.” Castiel said. “Like I’m not meant to be with her.”
When they had finished, Castiel asked for a servant to clean up the picnic supplies while he took Dean on a longer walk through the gardens. They stayed out much longer than they would have usually, long enough to watch the sunset.
“You were a brave and valiant general, Castiel, they will sing your tale for years to come.”
“Do you want… do you want the same as before?”
It took her a while to start speaking and Castiel felt more and more unnerved with every moment.
“Wouldn’t flying be easier?” Cas couldn’t really fight back the worry of Dean taking this car trip alone, even though he knew Dean was an excellent driver.
He and Cas knew they wanted kids right after marriage and wanted to foster to adopt. They understood that some children might come from traumatic backgrounds but they hadn’t known all their kids would.
He finally batted all the tears away and had pulled out the mixing bowls from the top shelf when he heard her say his name.
Dean blushed though he tried valiantly not to. “Babe.”
New Year’s Eve saw Castiel following Gabriel around some big-time director’s house, sneaking as much food as the two of them could manage and secretly whispering some jokes about the snooty people they had to speak to. Not everyone was bad though, of course, but he and Gabriel always liked to make fun of the people who tended to try too hard to appear rich.
Dean and Cas pulled apart from each other as a mixture of “Night Mama,” “Night Mom,” and “Merry Christmas Mary,” was offered.
“Why haven’t we heard about this before?” Dean asked, his pessimism winning out.
“No!” Dean practically shouted. He back peddled quickly, not wanting Cas to think Dean was too eager. “I mean… it’s cool. It’s like—it’s like we’re pretending to have real sex. What it would be like, right? So you kind of need a partner for that right?”
as he came all over himself.
He could feel panic swirl up inside him and Sam wasn’t even there to talk him down. It was for the best since his brother and Jack were currently out stalking the witch, keeping a close watch on her for when he did get the go ahead to gank her. But Dean could use his brother right at that moment—if not to keep Dean from overthinking everything but to maybe talk some sense into Rowena and Cas into getting the ball rolling on this Grace-marriage stuff.
He reeled himself in, taking a few breaths before apologizing to Jack. It was all they had to go on, and if maybes were going to get him back to Cas, then it was better than nothing.
dick made it different. That made it important. And really fucking hot. And Dean really wanted to know what it felt like. What it tasted like. But was he even allowed to touch him like that? Cas never asked.
Merely moments after Dean realized it was just a dream, he shrugged Castiel’s hand off his shoulder.
Cas pulled back just enough to breathe his words hotly against his boyfriend’s lips. “Prove it.” It was hardly a challenge, he knew he belonged to Dean completely.
him to get some “learning” in. Something about the possibilities of what he’d walk into… would Cas be eagerly awaiting him? Would he want to do this quick and dirty or would he want to draw it out? His friend had definitely been having fun with trying to draw out the buildup lately so Dean had a feeling he’d be up for a little of that at the moment.
He wished he would have caught on sooner but now that he was paying attention, all signs pointed to maybe, possibly, Dean having fallen for him as well. Now he faced the dilemma of not knowing what to do. Should he just bring it up out the blue? Should he plan something special to tell Dean how he felt? Was his friend planning something for the two of them already?
The thought was enough to help him drift off to sleep as well.
“Hell no. You know we don’t leave Baby alone.“
unprepared to see Dean on his knees before him. Not even all the solo sessions he’d engaged in over the years could prepare him for the sight of his best friend, the man he loved above all others, ready and eager to suck his cock.
Dean frowned a little but figured it wasn’t his place to insist on making sure the new kid got home, even if it went against every instinct in him to let someone go without helping them. “Okay, just go easy on that.”
he said.
“Like a date…”
It was alright though. There was always tomorrow.
He needed to hear those words so badly. God, he was so lucky.
I'm sorry for the long note, but I just wanted to explain the change.
“You’re the one teaching me though.” Castiel insisted but Dean didn’t seem impressed. His friend had a look of discontent on his face suddenly, making Cas nervous.
Castiel felt a little like an idiot as he quickly ran through the pros and cons of just sucking it up and asking Dean if he wanted to have sex.
After a few beats he managed to haul himself up to the side of the bed, with Dean keeping a watchful eye on him as if he might fall off.
If all he would ever be granted was a steady place in Dean’s life as his friend, he’d take that without hesitation because knowing Dean was the greatest pleasure of his life. His heart may ache to show the other man just how loved he is, to hold him when life became too much, to learn every detail he could of his skin… but he would be Dean’s friend if that’s what the other man requested.
That’s what Castiel hoped, to say the least.
"Don't even think about it." He heard from behind him.
But Castiel didn’t dare speak of it to Dean in case that was the wrong thing to say. Maybe it was too soon to call someone your best friend? He didn’t know the etiquette for friendship well enough yet.
“Dean, would you be willing to help me out?”
“Everyone keeps saying it’s normal. Cold feet are
Dean was still a little horny and apparently so was Cas because even though they were technically in the cuddling stage, Dean still had one of his fingers lazily pressing in and out of Cas’s loosened hole. He couldn’t help it, okay? He liked the little mewls that were escaping Cas’s lips.
“No, I’m not.” Castiel answered honestly.
He tried to act like he cared about what she had to say. He tried to play it cool and make her think he was interested because he figured a distraction would help with the hole in his heart, but when he moronically decided to kiss her just to see if it would do anything, all he tasted was regret.
“What the hell does that mean?”
“You mean that?” It felt vulnerable to look up at Cas and ask that but Dean needed to know.
Castiel nodded again and turned away from Dean, the dim light from the room just barely reflecting on the curve of his back. Dean wanted to completely devour the sight in front of him but he had a plan for the night and could afford to get distracted.
Cas felt himself pouting a little at the forceful change of subject but he tried to hide it in his voice.  “Dean said his brother might be coming out that week and wants some tours of the campus. I volunteered to take him around.”
“I really think he does.”
He knew his brother was right. He knew he’d been acting weird since Sam got here but Dean didn’t know how else to act. He was trying to pretend like he wasn’t sleeping with his best friend even though Sam would not shut the fuck up with his constant ‘Who are you seeing Dean?,’ he was trying to pretend like he didn’t miss the hell out of his best friend because this was the longest they’d been apart in months, and he was trying to pretend like he wasn’t horny as hell because he’d
Cas knew Dean heard the teasing in his voice when his friend gave him a small, exhausted smile before groaning at his discomfort. “I’m dying.”
He could feel the pounding in his ears as he finally accepted what he’d just said.
“Does it feel good?” Cas asked boldly, too caught up in the moment to feel nervous.
Castiel finally looked up at Dean and nodded. “Essentially, yes. The Grace will seek the purity of the soul and the soul’s devotion to the Grace. If at any point the Grace feels abandoned, it will flee. Severing the tether and then it would put me back here, to depletion.”
They shuffled their way out to the dock, a few plaid blankets in tow to sit on. As always Castiel would settle between Dean’s legs, relishing in the feeling of Dean’s arms around him, his soft breathing in Cas’s ears.
It just hovered, right over the bowl, the golden light moving within the orb--its own lifeforce.
Their formal living room was his least favorite place in the house, mostly for show when the fancy Hollywood people came over to talk to his dad, but further into their house, tucked behind a door was their loungeroom. In there his dad kept the first couch they had in their very first apartment, and the coffee table that Castiel picked out at a Goodwill. The movie posters and framed pictures on the wall were either gifts from Cas or pictures of Castiel growing up throughout the years, some with Gabriel right beside him.
“Shut up.”
“Yeah.” Cas huffed out quickly, his eyes fluttering shut at the feel of Dean’s finger pressing deeper.
It wasn’t enough. He could spend all of eternity searching for the right words and he likely never would get them just right. Castiel knew he would look back at their time together, long after his hunter finds his place in eternal life, and wonder if there’d ever be a word to describe all that Dean has done for him, has meant to him… will mean to him.
Castiel’s face went red.
"Do you miss your family very much?"
"Hurry up." Alastair impatiently snapped, making Castiel's heartbeat speed up.
surprised that Dean was even initiating a conversation.
"You good, man?" Dean asked.
"Castiel." April said. "I'm glad I caught you."
Castiel took a step back and swatted at his shoulder.
Castiel slipped Jack into Dean’s waiting arms. He felt a burst of warmth within his chest at the sight of Dean and Jack together. Dean gave Jack a hesitant bounce.
Castiel took a steadying breath, then flung his hands out towards Michael.
Castiel showed Dean to Claire's room. Claire glanced up when they entered and held out her books.
“You are nothing like John, Dean.” Castiel said, voice firm. “I promise you, you will be so amazing at this.”
Gabe paused. “Did he say anything like that?”
Claire's eyes widened and she nodded. The beta led her to an area of the store that had shelves of nail polish. Castiel was shocked by the amount.
oh my goodness I'm so so sorry for the late update. I got hit with school way harder than I expected. I finally got some time this weekend to get this done and yay! as usual, I wrote it while very sleep deprived and without reading it over so it may be absolute garbage but it's almost 2:30am and I'm way too excited and tired to care about editing. Thank you everyone for your patience!! I hope to get the next chapter out soon, but honesty I have other deadline priorities and two more weeks of school, so I'll probably be very busy. We'll see lol
"It's not the same, Cas!" Dean tried, sounding desperate. "I want a permanent bond with you, I swear!"
Cas nods.
who else loves soft Cas/Dean moments?
Dean twisted around in Castiel's pocket and Castiel took him out.
The last game was less of a game and more of a crafting event. Everyone received a plain white baby onesie that they were responsible for decorating. Dean was the least excited for this one until Ellen told him he could decorate his onesie with a pie (as long as he added “Cutie Pie”). Castiel drew an acute angle and labeled it with “I’m Acute Baby.” He’d made it on Charlie’s encouragement. Charlie claimed she had no artistic ability and so she only wrote “I am an Expansion Pack.” Bobby painted on a red bowtie that was outlined in red glitter (and he glared at Gabe when the beta teased him about it). Gabe ‘helped’ Sam decorate their onesie, which had a drawing of a moose with the caption “Don’t Moose with Me.” Benny and Andrea (though Castiel suspected Andrea did most of the work) painted a very cute bee and wrote “I’m UnBeelievably Cute.” Castiel privately liked that one the most, though Andrea and Benny sent him secretive grins so Castiel thought he probably wasn’t very good at hiding his opinion. Kevin’s said “I Enjoy a Little Formula,” and it had a baby’s bottle with the quadratic formula written on the inside. Jo decided to throw on a bunch of different colored paint and glitter on her onesie.
"Hello, Claire." Castiel said. Claire practically leapt from the couch in her rush to hug Castiel.
Sam’s cheeks went red and the alpha stammered.
"That's why your dad drilled it into your head that you had to keep Sam safe, never mind that you were a child and
Castiel growled as footsteps thundered in the hallways.
Gabriel shrugged. “Eh, maybe not in the long run, but you still notice when someone’s hot, right? Anyways, my first point still stands. This guy’s been talking to you and treating you like an actual person for fuck’s sake and not a fucking robot, and he takes care of your kid, and you’re already emotionally underdeveloped. I’m not surprised you’ve fallen hard and fast. Heh. Hard and fast.”
." She said it was such disgust that Castiel had to stifle a laugh.
“About a month or so.” Charlie shrugged. “Your surroundings can have an influence though. If you’re around more alphas or omegas, then you’ll probably go into heat or rut sooner.”
“Maybe I like getting him all riled up.” He said.
"Yes." Castiel growled. "Something else caught my eye."
"Castiel?" Dean repeated slowly. "Bit of a mouthful."
hoped y'all enjoyed
“Uh-”
"What does that matter?" Castiel argued. "I'll fly us as far as I can, then we'll run on foot. It may be harder, but we can still make it."
“I’m glad we’re able to be here together, and to get an actual break, for once. Most of the time there’s always something out to get us, even when we’re not actively hunting, but this time it’s different, and I’m glad for that.” Sam said. He met Dean’s eye with a meaningful expression that Dean decided to ignore.
Dean couldn’t stop himself from shivering at the timbre of Castiel’s tone. He found himself desperate to continue on with this toying banter, to rile up the alpha.
"You know who Grumpy Cat is, right?" Dean said.
“Me.”
Instead, he heard laughter and giggling from the living room. Castiel made his way over and curiously peered into the room.
Castiel flinches, but Dean can’t bring himself to care. There’s panic building up in his chest and he’s starting to sweat. Surely, this man is wrong. Surely, Cas wouldn’t have lied about something like this, and for so long. Surely, there’s another explanation.
Castiel stared at Michael, utterly revolted. He could feel the horror coming off of Dean in waves.
"What about me?" April asked.
Dean laughed and nodded.
“No!” Dean replied with urgency. “I would love to share this meal with you, Cas.”
Sam wrinkled his nose, eyes focused past Castiel and Dean. "You're a fucking pig, Dean."
Castiel was uncertain, to say the least.
"Will you be staying here?" Castiel finally got the courage to ask. "I would never hold it against you, of course, if you wanted to stay here instead of return back to my house and shop with me."
” He snarled, alpha-voice leaking into his tone.
“If it is alright with Mister, er…” the man trailed off and looked at Dean expectantly.
"It's bound to happen eventually." He said. "The Sickness is strong here."
“Are you attracted to men, Dean?”
At nearly three months, Dean knew his time with Castiel was coming to an end. He figured that if he were to do anything, it should be now, and perhaps he was feeling a little bolstered by Gabriel’s apparent support (or, really, his lack of opposition).
Dean let out an exaggerated sigh. “Fine. I’m getting up.”
Dean tilted his head into Castiel’s hand. “Me too. Fuck, babe, it must have been so hard for you.”
After pausing to rest and eat, they continued forward. They were a little rejuvenated, but still incredibly thirsty. It was Dean who was able to track down a small creek for them to drink from (clearly Castiel's skills were attuned more towards war than wilderness survival, and he wondered what that said about their personalities). The water did not seem to be incredibly clean, but with no way to sterilize it they decided to drink it anyways and hope for the best. Their grace could potentially fight off infection or disease.
Ellen must have cleaned up while Castiel was in the hospital. The house looked clean in a way that neither Dean nor Castiel could ever attain. It helped him to relax, not that he could truly relax with Dean still in a coma.
* * * * *
“What if it’s a demon?”
"Sounds like a lot of fun." Dean said. "I have to check to see if I can, so for now I'll say maybe. That reminds me, I can watch Claire on Friday."
“‘Fraid so. Can’t say I remember the last time you did that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Good job!" Dean said. "Mr. Smartypants over here."
"As are you."
Castiel could hear footsteps approaching and a gruff voice calling, "Just a second!"
When Sam and Gabe left, Castiel took time to dress Jack up for the day. He put on a black onesie with a bee, one of Castiel’s favorites, and readied everything.
"Hello, Dean."
"Um." Claire looked at Castiel.
He licks his lips and goes through every possible name he can think of.
“I’m great!” Claire said. “Can I do your hair?”
It was weird to think about how cleaning helped Dean to calm. While Dean was a teenager, cleaning up was the last thing he wanted to do,
“But you said it doesn’t hurt.” Dean said.
Dean carried Adam and his backpack up the stairs to the apartment because, infuriatingly, Adam had learned to make puppy eyes from Sam, and Adam didn't like to go up stairs.
"There's nothing wrong with having a sugar daddy or being a sugar daddy." Gabriel said with a sniff. "I was just asking."
"You're a lot of trouble, aren't you?" Alastair said, his thumb rubbing over Dean's chin. Dean swallowed.
The doorbell rang again, making Castiel wince and look at the baby monitor. It stayed silent, luckily, but for the crackle of static. Castiel turned to frown at the door. Everyone knew to knock instead of ring the doorbell because of Jack, so who could be at the door?
On instinct, Dean whirled around to find out who'd called him. He felt his eyes widen when he saw Castiel Novak standing in front of him.
"Alright." Castiel nodded. "Thank you." He offered a tight grin, then he entered his office and shut the door. He walked over to his desk and slumped in his chair, moping.
Cas noses along his neck. “I don’t know. I like the idea of having you bent over the arm of this sofa for me.”
I don't own Supernatural
"He's being modest." Dean chimed in, shooting Castiel a happy grin that had the alpha's stomach fluttering oddly. "He's a real hero."
"Yes."
"You were just tryin' to help me out, be a good friend." Dean said.
Dean woke the following morning absolutely sweltering. He could feel Castiel pressed up against him. Cas’s arm was thrown over Dean’s waist, rather possessively. Dean didn’t want to disturb Cas, but he needed to check his phone. He was lucky enough that his jeans had ended up on the nightstand. Dean just had to reach over with one arm and fish his phone out of his pocket.
"Is this because of... what we did?" Dean asked quietly, his voice abnormally timid.
In the end, it was a close match between Bobby, Gabe, and Jo. Bobby came first, Jo was second, and Gabe was third. Jo’s apparent beer drinking ability did raise some questions from Ellen, much to everyone’s amusement.
Bobby scratched thoughtfully at his beard. "I might got a few things in my storage room. You're welcomed to take a look."
It was nice to be with everyone again under good conditions. Castiel had faithfully attended the get-togethers his family had had while Dean was unconscious, but none of them felt right.
The omega prince had let himself into Dean’s room and had started chatting with him as if they were lifelong friends. Dean had been confused, but he had gone along with it, which landed him in his current predicament: Gabriel interrogating Dean about Castiel.
Bobby returned and took a seat next to Dean.
"Why don't you get out your favorite book and then I'll come and you can read them to me." Dean suggested just as Claire was beginning to pout. She lit up and nodded, then dashed into the house.
Castiel smiled at the sight.
“There are, and they’re all in public places.”
At first, Sam told Dean about how he had tracked Dean’s phone and Baby when Dean stopped checking in. He had found and killed the vampires, then spent the next few months trying to find Dean even though he thought Dean was dead.
“Cas,” April breathed, light and sweet in his ear. Her voice was too high, but Castiel ignored it in favor of kissing down her neck.
He looked to Castiel with unmasked curiosity and concern.
“Get a room.” Balthazar said, hitting Castiel’s shoulder.
“Okay.” Castiel said, tone dismissive.
Castiel considered that for a moment. "Okay."
“Are you feeling alright?”
"Okay."
"She's pretty upset." Dean said to stop him.
“How strange.” Castiel mused.
Suddenly there was a small pup tugging gently at Dean's shirt. Castiel blinked several times, stunned. The boy certainly looked a lot like Dean.
Castiel ducked his head. He mumbled. “No.”
Sam breathes in deeply through his nose and then lets it out slowly. It’s probably some stupid meditation mechinism he learned in yogo, or something. It makes Dean smile to know he’s getting on Sam’s nerves.
Gabriel raised an eyebrow.
“Now, Ellen and Charlie have finished setting up, and everyone is meant to be arriving soon. We can’t have a baby shower without the baby and the person having the baby.”
Gabriel was quiet and Castiel marveled at the fact that a simple admission of his feelings had rendered his chatty brother speechless.
Castiel was taken off-guard by the question and so instead of denying anything, he blushed.
"Okay, back it up." Gabriel held out his hands. "Can you start from the beginning, or something? Because I have no idea who this Dean person is and all of the sudden you're killing our very powerful older brother with his help?"
"I hadn't thought of that." Castiel admitted, somewhat amazed. "Thank you.  Your work is excellent."
"Your daddy is mean, Claire." Gabriel said. Then he caught sight of Claire's colored nails. "Gotta say, I'm really digging the nails."
He and Dean took their shifts diligently throughout the night, and at the first light of dawn they continued onwards.
"Not sure if you got a chance to check, but I left the leftover dinner and pie in the fridge."
Castiel huffed in annoyance as Dean pushed back the covers and moved to stand.
Another note - I know Dean doesn't like to talk about stuff but he was making an extra effort for Cas <3
Gabriel snorted.
"Could you watch Claire? I have a date with April."
Dean must have taken his silence for reluctance.
"Why are you telling me this?" Castiel asked. "How do I know you're not lying."
Dean bit his lip. It definitely sounded like an excuse. "Hey, you're a busy man, I get it. Claire doesn't get it, though. You're going to have to make it up to her. She'll probably be upset for a while."
Castiel stood and shuffled over to Dean. He lay down next to the other angel. It took a couple of moments of shifting and untangling until they were comfortable against one another.
Dean saw more of his kingdom than he’d ever had in the past, which was horrible ironic seeing as he may never return and the kingdom would likely fall to Sam’s rule rather than Dean’s (and Dean’s husband, by extension).
The ride started up. The cars moved forward and then turned, then started to go up an incline. Dean took a deep breath.
Castiel glanced up hopefully.
“I don’t understand the problem.” Mr. Rogers cut in. “Why are Gordon and Aidan in trouble? They should be allowed to hold their own opinions.”
Cas’s hands loosen their grip and Cas goes still.
Next to them, the priest intoned on with the ceremony, but Dean’s focus was solely on the alpha in front of him.
For some reason, this felt like an excuse to Castiel.
But Dean was looking at him with such desperation, and Castiel could never refuse him something like this.
“I didn’t forget everything when I had amnesia.” Dean says. “I didn’t realize it until after I got my memories back, but there was something I still remembered.”
It seemed so surreal.
Dean ducked his head and shuffled his feet. “Not really.”
Castiel finished his morning round near nine in the morning.
He saw Dean open his gorgeous eyes.
"I'm glad I got to see this." Dean continued. "I never thought I'd be outside again."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes." Castiel softly replied. "Even then."
"Of course." Castiel could barely refrain his groan. "Is it just her?"
"No, you're not." Castiel said. The night was still young and time would tell what April's true personality was, but she'd already surprised him by behaving much differently than she had at the charity gala and over the phone.
Dean offered a bitter smile. “This is not proper of me, but I have something to request of you.”
I don't own Supernatural
“God, Cas, I’m not fucking serious.” Dean interrupted. “Fuck. I’m just in a lot of fucking pain right now. We can talk about doing this again later.”
“And?”
“I’m sure.” He said, teeth gritted. “Hurry and do it now, before it gets worse.”
“Ah,” Castiel tried desperately not to feel disappointed. “Me neither.”
“Excellent. I can meet you after school again today in the library.”
Castiel fluttered nervously before he began to follow Dean's scent. It wasn't difficult to track the omega. His scent stood out sweetly among the wood and fauna.
"Hey, I'm going to go. I'll see you on Monday."
Castiel looked over his back just as a patrol of demons emerged from the tree line.
"You're not going to kill Dean." Castiel said. "I know you want something from him. If you kill him you'll get nothing from either of us."
“He’s my
Castiel cried out, his wing locking up, and they dropped from the sky.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Bossy."
“Nah,” Dean replied, and Castiel didn’t believe him for one second.
"I have never known an angel to be raised on earth." Castiel answered truthfully.
It was easy for Castiel to make the charms as types of jewelry to be worn by whoever bought them. He sold gemstones and made normal jewelry as well, since it was such a popular thing. The wooden carvings were popular too. Castiel made them in random shapes, usually like an animal of some sort.
Dean will have to leave before Castiel gets home that night, but at least there will be something for Castiel to have.
Castiel felt as though he could hug Dean and their kids for forever, but soon the kids were squirming and tired of being smothered. Castiel and Dean released them, with only a little regret, and left them to do their separate things.
Castiel smiled, then offered Jack again. “Do you… Would you like to hold him?”
I hope everyone had a great week and will be having a great weekend
Charlie designed her own lightsaber. It was blue, like Leia’s. Dean decided to make a BB-series droid. Charlie named it Bae-B, and although Dean hated the spelling, he loved the name more and so he kept it. Bae-B’s official name was BB-67.
Dean had been acting off for a couple of weeks, just after he caught the stomach flu. Castiel noticed nearly right away, but he hadn’t said anything. Dean used to hate sharing his thoughts and feelings, and for the most part he still did, but he would do his best to give Castiel a little bit of insight. It made Castiel very proud to know Dean trusted him enough to willingly be involved in ‘chick-flick’ moments. So, he did not worry or pry.
Dean nodded.
"Please." Dean begged, his eyes tear-filled. Castiel swallowed, not knowing if Dean meant to stop or continue, and kissed Dean's neck, just above his scent gland. The other angel whined and melted against Castiel, offering complete submission.
Castiel frowned at him. He hadn't noticed the slip of Dean's tongue, and it honestly did not bother him.
-cap out-
Gabriel scoffed. "And why, pray tell, would they think that?"
“I believe you’re right.” Castiel said, grinning.
"My energy is severely depleted." Castiel said quietly. "Fighting Michael was... exhausting, to say the least."
Dean had been ready to go back home as soon as he heard the news, but now he was feeling sort of attached. It was weird and pretty freaky what was happening to him, and Dean seriously missed his past body (which he was beginning to think would never return).
It’s so fucking perfect.
The cat from before stood at Castiel's feet, his tail raising slowly in a hesitant greeting.
"Thank you." He said, eyeing her. "I will admit that it has been a bit difficult taking care of Claire these past few months."
While Sam started on his work, Dean began to take out the things he needed for baking a cherry pie. He was lucky that Castiel kept his kitchen rather stocked, though it was a bit strange since Dean was almost certain the alpha didn’t cook much.
It took Dean a moment for the information to sink in. Then he spluttered.
"Hey, cher." Benny greeted, head tipping.
Castiel left a little earlier than usual, wanting to get home as soon as possible. Balthazar kindly did not mention his nervous state.
Claire and Dean were sitting at the kitchen table with empty plates. They looked up at his entrance.
"I don't know!" He exclaimed.
"Nice to see you, Michael." Castiel greeted his brother.
Mrs. Harvelle moved to the side and gestured into the house. Castiel sucked in his breath before stepping inside. He removed his shoes and left them at the door as he made his way deeper into the house.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You've gotten so big." Ellen said as she pulled back. Her voice sounded watery, like she was trying not to cry. Castiel could see that Dean's eyes were tear-filled.
"You seem distracted." April said, voice filled with genuine concern. "Is everything alright?"
“Okay, moving on!” Sam smoothly cut in.
“So you’re not interested in anyone right now, but you could be?” He asked.
Apparently Cas was thinking the same thing, because he withdrew his arms slowly and clenched his jaw.
“Gabe?”
I don't own Supernatural
The effect was instantaneous.
Dean ended up talking to Charlie for a good thirty minutes before she had to get back to work. Dean bid his goodbye and promised they would meet up for a marathon too. Dean had been waiting for Adam to turn six before showing him Star Wars, since he was a little concerned with the violence, and his birthday was coming up quickly.
"Dean," he said, "I find that I am having trouble relaxing without your physical presence. Would you be opposed to sharing a cot?"
“I suppose you would like to drive.”
I hope everyone is staying safe and healthy despite everything that's happening (holy cow this year has been terrible)
Dean wakes up with his head tucked under Cas’s chins and Cas’s arms wrapped around his torso. It’s the most comfortable he’s been for a very long time and he feels overwhelmingly happy and safe. He doesn’t want to get up, but his stomach has already started growling (it’s what woke him in the first place) and Dean has an inkling that Cas is going to be hungry too.
“I will.”
They get to the Bunker in three hours. Immediately, Dean goes to his room and shuts the door. He lays on his bed for a while and stares up at the ceiling.
"Your familiar form is a ferret. That is not very common."
Thirty dollars!
"Yeah." He said. "Other things."
They stare at one another.
“I will see you later.” Castiel promised.
“You’re lucky.” Ellen said. “Jo has always been trouble.”
“Here.” Castiel offered his hand for Dean to hold and promptly lost his breath when Dean squeezed it with all of his might.
"If you do not want to shift, that would be fine, too." Castiel said. "I just find it fascinating."
I don't own Supernatural
“I’m so sorry.” Dean whispered. “Cas, I-”
Once Dean finished he put on his pajamas and stepped out of the bathroom. He paused as he entered the bathroom.
Castiel put Jack down for a nap when he got home. He considered resting too, but he was too tired to be tired. The bags under his eyes had been dark and thick for several weeks now.
Surprisingly, Dean seemed to grow even more uncomfortable. This made Castiel a bit worried that he'd overstepped. Maybe Dean had only one form and he was ashamed of that.
"Hey, you're a busy man, I get it." Dean said. "Claire doesn't get it, though. You're going to have to make it up to her. She'll probably be upset for a while."
Dean went to bed that night feeling uncertain and unhappy with himself. He also worried that he’d crossed a line with Castiel and that the alpha would avoid him.
Dean was suddenly hyper aware of Cas’s presence. He focused on the gravel of his voice, the way he bit his lip as he worked on making food, how his muscles flexed as he moved.
"I, uh, I can form the temp bond with you when you want." He said, a bit hesitantly. "I don't really know the process for that kind of bond, but I know it's different from a permanent bond." His last words sounded like a warning of sorts, like he expected Castiel to trick him into a permanent bond.
“Let him scent you.” Gabe suggested softly.
This time is was Castiel that moaned into their kiss.
"You've got me." Castiel hesitantly unfurled his left wing. Dean lifted his back from the tree and gave just enough space for Castiel to slip his wing in between Dean's back and the tree and curl it protectively around Dean's outer side.
“I don’t know how I feel about this situation. I don’t know how long I’ll be mad at you. But what I do know is that I still love you, and right now I really want to kiss you.”
Castiel looked from Claire to Dean and pierced the omega with his gaze. “Hello, Dean.”
In one swift motion, Dean whirled around and pressed his lips against Cas’s. Castiel’s arms immediately drew Dean closer, and then Dean was being kissed back.
"That can't be." Castiel argued. "His heat wasn't very long ago, he shouldn't be showing symptoms already."
His magic flared to life again and he felt his power returning. The broken edges of their temporary bond vibrated and sewed back together, then increased in strength.
Instead of moving to the floor, Cas shifted to lie on his stomach across the unoccupied space of the couch and had Dean’s dick bobbing in and out of his mouth in no time. He wasn’t sure if he was getting any better at this but he did know he was having more and more fun each time he did. That had to mean he was pretty okay, right? It’s just that he really liked hearing how Dean sounded when something felt nice, and he wanted to do anything he could to keep hearing that. He figured that’s why people did this in the first place.
“Then why! Why didn’t you ever ask me if it was true! Why did you leave me so easily? Why didn’t you come back?
And… he hadn’t been as kind to Cas either. Bossing him around about helping out, being passive aggressive every time Cas didn’t do something Dean asked him to…
“No, it’s fine. I was gonna say the same thing to you—with your flight and all. To—to let me know when you get back to Cali safe.”
Cas held him tight, letting Dean know it was okay—that they were okay, until his friend started to get his breathing under control.
“What?” Hannah asked sounding shocked. “You’ve both been so happy. Why would he just end it? Did you have a fight?”
“It’s what you
He heard Jo laugh over the phone. “You want ‘em? You can take them.”
I'm super happy with how it turned out and I hope this story warmed your heart as much as it did mine.
“Your mom would’ve been so proud of you,” he said with a kiss to the top of Cas’s head. “I know I am.”
“Oh fuck. Get your clothes off. Hurry.”
The face Dean made was a mixture of amusement and shock. “Dude, are you asking me to be your wingman? Because I’m totally up for that.”
“I feel the same.” There was a dreamy quality to Cas’s voice and Dean knew then that Cas was officially wrapped around that boy’s little finger.
“Is your homework all done?” She asked, pulling Dean from his thoughts.
In time he’d get over it but with Christmas only five days away he was going to allow himself a few more days of being sad. No one wanted to be alone at Christmas and he hated that he thought this year would be different.
The stress, fear, and doubts locked up in Dean’s chest immediately disintegrated as his best friend started gathering their things. Despite how much Dean wanted to get out of there, there wasn’t any franticness to their movements as much as there was urgency to be gone before someone came looking. That’s why when the door to the room flung open Dean and Cas froze in place like disobedient children.
“You think he’s going to regret it?” Dean asked his brother after a period of silence. “Bonding to me and being powerless?”
“Damnit Cas, help me.”
Perhaps there was some small part of him who wanted to be able to show his best friend how to be a more confident lover. It wasn’t merely anything more than him being protective of Cas and not wanting him to get hurt… paired with the fact that Dean knew he was pretty good in bed himself. He did have some knowledge he could pass to his friend and they
“No! You don’t understand. I’m not some scumbag like you think I am. I’m not using him to get my rocks off. I’d never do that!”
“Generally no. I’ve been told it’s ‘creepy.’” He supplied, thinking back to the many times both Sam and Dean had said those exact words to him.
He knew Bobby and Jody were doing okay money-wise but he couldn’t bring himself to ask for a plane ticket no matter how bad he was missing them. They always told him that he could come home any time but he also knew they had Sammy they were still looking after. With his brother in the midst of applying for colleges and scholarships and eventually needing a reliable car to get him around whatever town he was going to go to for school, Dean just couldn’t let himself take any money that should be going to Sammy. Plus, it’d become a thing that he and Cas would sit out the shorter holidays and wait until the longer ones to go back home. Cas’s dad lived in L.A. and Dean’s family was in Sioux Falls and even though the drive from Las Vegas to L.A. wasn’t a bad one and Cas could even fly there for fairly cheap, he seemed to be willing to hang out with Dean’s sorry ass.
I cannot believe I spent about two and a half years writing this story. I was reminiscing tonight and realized I'd started toying with the idea as I was writing Sleep Without You and asked myself "what if I did a best friend story with the all cuddles but make it smutty?" It was just a little bit of fun in between writing my other stories since I was still really new to fanfiction and didn't think many people who really read my work. MAN was I wrong. THANK YOU for reading this story or any of my other works. The comments you all leave me actually brighten my day and sometimes bring me to tears because of how kind you all are. I'm still so blown away any of you would read this stuff.
“Castiel?”
He did, however, feel good on his birthday, which was all Cas’s doing.
Castiel still didn’t feel encouraged. “I forgot to buy drinks that you like as well…”
“Looking for something?”
It was curious why his friend would have grabbed it and Castiel couldn’t tear his mind away from the thought until Charlie loudly broke in.
Something broke a little in Dean’s look. “And that would stop you?”
Cas’s heart was still pounding but he was going solely on instinct right now. With his eyes still locked with Dean he reached under the water to his own swim trunks and pulled them down and off his legs. “What does it look like?”
Cas’s eyes snapped up to Dean’s. His roommate’s green eyes were burning into him. “What?” Castiel asked in concern.
“And despite all that he
There was a peculiar look on the guy’s face that Dean couldn’t decide if was distrust or just hesitation. He suddenly began to worry that this new kid had heard the rumors about him and was scared of him already.
“Well I’ll see y’all around.”
There was that look again too. That look Dean couldn’t seem to erase every time their eyes met. Castiel knew he wasn’t reading it wrong. Not anymore. Not when Dean was looking down at his lips with pure hunger in his eyes and Castiel couldn’t take it anymore. He slammed their lips together, less gracefully than he had intended but the effect was still the same. Dean’s arms were suddenly fully engulfing him has they desperately explored each other’s mouths.
Without any argument Dean pulled the toy out of his friend and crawled off the bed to grab the larger piece. It was garish and pink and weighed his hand down significantly more than the other one, but the detailing on it looked so much more like a real dick.
Cas slapped his own forehead and groaned, clearly embarrassed by his behavior. “God… I’m sorry. I felt like such an idiot after I left. I just got flustered. I didn’t know what to say.”
Mon, Nov 13, 2017 1:05
“Oh this?” Dean seemed shocked by the question, shaking his head to get his thoughts together. He looked down at the jacket Castiel gestured too. “Uh, yeah, well no. It was my dad’s. My mom gave it to me for ton—I mean she uh… she said I could use it since you, uh, you probably would need to borrow one of mine and I uh, I don’t have anything else. It’s nothing special or anything… like it’s not a big deal. ”
Do you think things are weird?
Granting her wish, he made it back downstairs to have dinner with the three kids who were currently still speaking to him.
Dean just laughed and rolled his eyes before immediately biting his lip when Cas sank down onto his knees and crawled in between Dean’s legs. Dean’s breath hitched when Cas’s fingers slid under the waistband of his pajama bottoms and started tugging.
“I’m glad,” his roommate replied.
I dont mind how late it is come over whenever
This chapter was suppose to go through the family dinner but it started to get too long. So, next chapter will be the events after Dean's conversation with Anna as well as what happens at dinner...
He gave his son a stern look, letting the kid know he meant business, and only answered the call when he saw Jack starting to pick up the crackers.
Castiel was maybe halfway through the Grey’s Anatomy episode when his friend walked in and dumped his backpack on the ground by their door.
“Let’s do this bitches! Pick your numbers.”
“Dean,” he whispered a few times to no response.
In a flurry of ‘holy shit we can’t have Charlie mad at us,’ they managed to get presentable, grab their presents and food they were bringing, and dive into Dean’s Impala in under ten minutes. Luckily for them Charlie only lived a short five-minute drive from their apartment.
Since getting Gabriel and Jack back, the Nephilim had been spending his time between heaven and the Winchesters practicing his hunting skills while working with the angels to grow his abilities and restore the peace upstairs. The kid already had so much on his plate, it seemed unfair to dump this news on him, but what other choice did they have?
“Always?” The awed wonder in Cas’s voice had Dean chuckling a little.
Only Cas got to see Dean like this, so soft and reverent, so completely in love. “I feel the same way, baby.”
He was tired and quite frankly emotionally drained. His clinic was still under construction—permits having taken far too long to get approved by the city—so he was still working at his old job for the time being. He still loved it there, but he was anxious to start the next chapter of his career. Regardless or where, he was still doing what he loved.
do you think you can still come over tonight? We’ll save you some leftovers and some cookies and pie
“Are you sure?” He asked, feeling earlier emotion try and fight its way back out. “Are you sure you’re okay with it?”
“So you’re saying if she dies your Grace goes with it and you…. What happens to you?”
He ended up asking to try a new position after a few minutes of Dean pumping the toy in and out of him.
“I don’t know.”
“Well I know you didn’t understand like ninety-nine percent of the movies but you did love Groot and Baby Groot so I thought it’d make you laugh.”
“Oh fuck. Was that—Was that okay?”
“Why’re you so good to me?”
“If anything happens we call right away. If we can’t get ahold of you, we call Uncle Bobby. No one is allowed over after ten. We know the drill mom.”
“I’m not asking for intercourse at the moment. I’d just like to learn how to perform oral sex for right now.”
Cas shared some of those fears too but he couldn’t let himself even think such things. “We won’t let that happen.”
Really you can stay with me and Sam.
Dean’s dick was one hundred percent back in the game so he skillfully tried to keep his pelvis angled away from the small of his best friend’s back while he waited.
Claire obediently held her hands out on the table. The alpha did Claire's nails quickly, chatting with Castiel's daughter the entire time. After, she told Claire to keep her hands there as she did Castiel's nails.
That was certainly a possibility. It would be a tremendous advantage over the angels if the demons had a Nephilim in their ranks.
Castiel nodded. He thought about telling Sam and Gabe where everything was, but his house was still a mess and everything was in plain sight, so they shouldn’t have trouble finding something they might need.
Sure enough, Cas was staring at him. He didn’t blink or avert his eyes at being caught, either. If anything it seemed the intensity of his eye contact increased.
“No, Cas, I wasn’t here for you. But I’m here for you now. I swear, Cas, I ain’t leavin’ and I’m here for you.”
“I don’t wanna clean up!”
"Sit down, Dean." Ellen ordered. "You need some more food."
Dean averted his eyes. A light blush spread across his nose and cheeks. “I did.”
A plastic baby.
Dubcon: Castiel has to choose whether he or Alastair will be with Dean during his heat and he chooses himself (Dean does not give explicit consent and Castiel doesn't really want to because he know what Dean wants... both want the other but neither know that)
-cap out-
“I do appreciate you, Ellen.” Dean said, smiling sweetly at her.
Castiel grimaced. He'd buy Daphne some flowers to make it up to her.
"Nah." Dean said. "Just Dean works."
Castiel felt something in his chest loosen.
"Oh." Castiel said. "It is unusual for siblings to be two different beings."

Brown hair. Brown hair that’s technically short but still considered long.
“I’ll do it!” Charlie offered cheerfully. “I’m more used to the idea because I read fanfiction. So, you can think of alpha, beta, and omega designations as a sort of secondary gender. Traditionally, alphas are the protectors and omegas are the caretakers and bear children. It’s not really like that anymore, at least in this universe. Alphas have ruts and omegas have heats, which are their fertility periods. Betas are probably the most similar to humans in the universe that we’re used to. They still have animalistic instincts but they don’t have heats or ruts. They all have a more powerful sense of smell, so now we’ve all got our own scents.”
Cas joined Dean a little bit more than an hour later and sat down in the adjacent deck chair.
“A fish sounds good.” Dean agreed. “Fish sounds good for dinner, too.”
"Oh, father-daughter bonding time?" The alpha woman behind the table asked.
Sam went back inside, muttering something like, "brain bleach" as he did so.
Castiel tilted his head. He felt as though Dean was interrogating him. Perhaps Castiel should have gotten upset or defensive because of this, but instead he only grew more interested.
"You snarking me, kid?" Dean teased.
Before Castiel could continue, Dean shimmered and shifted faster than he had ever had before, and Castiel was suddenly arms full of naked Dean.
It was nearly five minutes of random turns and doorways before they came to a giant, open room. A throne-like chair was at the far end of the room, and Castiel couldn't help but roll his eyes at the obnoxious show of power. Maybe this was Alastair's way of installing respect in his followers and fear in his enemies, but Castiel thought it ridiculous.
"Four." Castiel answered.
“It is.”
Castiel glared over his shoulder as he held tightly to Dean's forearm. The demon stared back at him impassively. Castiel unfurled his wing and wrapped it around Dean for good measure, then continued walking.
Dean pulled away before he could break into tears again.
Dean looked away and shuffled his feet.
Gabriel kept teasing Dean about it, so Dean kicked him under the table and shut him up.
"I'm going to get you something to eat and drink." Ellen told him. "You and Dean are obviously malnourished."
Castiel was fucking cute, and Dean couldn’t ignore his growing fondness for his guard.
“That feels so weird!” He exclaimed.
“On television, maybe.” Dean said. “And when it’s in real life it’s always a scandal.”
“I’m good with that.” Dean said.
He looks up and his breath catches in his throat. The customer has finally lifted his head and Dean just got a good look at him. He has dark brown hair and a smooth, chiseled face. His eyes seem to be piercing into Dean’s. He’s fucking built, too. All in all, the customer is
Dean gulps.
“Don’t run!” Dean yelled pointlessly.
The tension seemed to dissipate at that as Dean sighed.
Dean was very rigid and stiff at first because he was all-too aware of Castiel’s presence. But a few minutes passed without incident and Dean began to relax. He listened to Castiel’s gentle and even breathing and found himself growing sleepier.
“Not at all.”
Castiel flushed.
Gabe rolled his eyes. “What’s it look like?”
Dean swallowed and rubbed his palms on his legs. He stood. “So, if I were to ask you now-”
"My apologies." Castiel murmured. "I am curious about you."
"I suspect the demons wanted information from Dean, I'm trying to determine what it is."
This time, Castiel was not able to stop himself from leaning to the side and retching. There wasn't much in his stomach, but he continued to gag.
"It is no problem." Castiel answered. "It's clear you care for your family immensely, and Claire could benefit from a friend her own age."
Castiel spluttered.
“Cas,” Dean interrupted, “Just get on the bed.”
"There's no real process, not like with a permanent bond. It's made as soon as I use your assistance when performing magic." Castiel explained. "It is very simple, actually. We can work on it now, if you wouldn't mind."
"What?" Dean said. "No way! Show me."
“Dean,” Cas interrupts firmly. “I swear to you, this has nothing to do with me thinking less of you or not being into you.”
"You could say that." Dean answered. "What brought you in?"
"Damn." Bobby softly swore. "I assumed so after I stopped hearing from John, but I had hoped..." He trailed off, eyes focused on something far away.
The squirrel did nothing in return but watch Castiel.
"Of course I want to win the war!" He snapped. "You think that I want the demons to rule over Heaven and Earth? Do you want that?"
"Yes, Papa." Claire answered. "Uncle Gabriel made me chicken noodle soup."
“Naomi mentioned you were having difficulty finding a suitable nanny for Claire,” Mr. Kelly said, “I still have April’s nanny’s contacts.”
for the mostly every chapter expect implications or talk of off-screen rape / non-con and violence
“I have to go see Dean,” Castiel said, already moving for the door.
Dean's breath stuttered. He closed his eyes tightly and swallowed. Castiel watched him, apprehension growing to nausea in his stomach.
Castiel woke gasping, as he did every day, but for the first time it was not because of a nightmare. Outside, thunder crackled and lightning flashed in a furious summer storm. The storm itself had not woken Castiel, there was something more that was making Castiel uneasy. The hair on the back of his head were on end and his stomach churned with the feeling of impending doom.
"Comfortable?" He asked.
"But you're not in Hell anymore." Ellen pointed out.
Castiel pushed himself up and helped Dean to stand. They fell into line, treading obediently forward. Castiel watched Dean carefully from the corner of his eye, noticing how Dean was still shirtless. The bruises and cuts seemed to stand out even more in the sunlight.
Castiel woke to a foot on his face. He blinked tiredly up at the ceiling and took a moment to wonder how Claire had gotten turned around during her sleep.
Cas could have a whole fucking conversation with his eyes alone and Dean found that he couldn’t look away from Cas’s amused and - dare he say it? -
"I can introduce you to this angel named Charlie. I think you'd like her." Castiel said. "And I will be sure to visit you often. We could even exchange letters, if you wish."
Bobby led them into the house and to the kitchen. There was a table in the kitchen for them to sit around. Gabriel and Castiel sat on one side and Dean on the other. Bobby stayed standing.
so that no one can say ‘no,’ because I most definitely will still go even if someone says I can’t, and I don’t really feel like getting scolded.”
"Right this way."
Claire stared at Dean with wide eyes.
A jolt seemed to pulse through Castiel. He hadn’t considered letting Dean go after finding a new mate.
“Yeah, but you guys live farther than how long we’ve been here.” Dean said.
"I'll make it interesting for you." Castiel growled. "Let Dean go."
Claire was sleeping when Castiel picked her up from Gabriel's house. His brother helped get Claire's things together.
“I’m glad you two could make it.” Castiel cut in. He knew from personal experience that their bickering could go on for ages. It’d been that way ever since Dean and Castiel had introduced them. Castiel also knew that underneath all the squabbling, they loved each other greatly.
"Really?" Gabriel asked. "Her? C'mon, Cassie."
“I heard you were sick.” Castiel answers. “I wanted to check on you. I brought you soup.”
Claire left the bathroom so it was only Dean and Mr. Novak.
Castiel spun his head back. “Really?”
“I’m well, Dean,” Castiel replied, voice rumbling, “How are you?”
"Uh," Dean glanced at his phone and grimaced, "I don't know."
Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge was based in the Black Spire Outpost on the planet Batuu. It looked amazing. The landscapes and geography of it all was simply incredible. The buildings and employees sold it even more.
"What is your name?" Castiel asked, turning to face the man completely.
“Something locked away your mojo?”
Hedgehog-Dean snuffled at his fingers a bit before looking up at him.
Michael redirected the bolt with a mere brush of his hand and advanced forward.
"Why don't you explain it to me, then?" He asked with a tinge of impatience.
"This child would be my real family!" Castiel said. He was frustrated that Dean wasn't listening. "Despite the circumstances around how it was conceived, this child is mine too, Dean, and I intend to care for it the way every parent should."
"We'd been getting threats." Dean continued after a couple of moments. "Witches wanted to bond with me, and they were tired of me saying no. The last letter I received said they would take it out on Sammy, my brother, unless I complied, so I ran away. I hoped that I could lead the witches away from my family. Didn't take long for a bunch of the fuckers to catch up with me."
“Oh.” Dean tried not to tremble. “Uh. Good. I, uh, love you too.”
He took out his phone and snapped a couple of pictures, then looked down at them and laughed.
Castiel brushed up against the magical barrier lightly, and his frowned deepened. The magic did not seem to stem from anything other than the ferret itself, which meant that the ferret was producing it somehow.
Charlie didn’t mention the baby and parenthood thing for the rest of the trip, which was just another reminder to Dean of why he loved her.
“Babe?” Dean called. “You home?”
* * * * *
“Hey!” Dean exclaims, scowling at Sam. “I’ll have you know that he took me by surprise.”
"Fuck." Mr. Novak swore, taking Dean by surprise. "April wouldn't stop talking, I
"Don't worry about it." Castiel said. He took a moment to observe Dean. The omega looked young, almost too young to have a six-tear-old pup. Castiel shouldn't judge, though.
“Easy for you to say.” Dean gasped, teeth gritted. “Fuck!”
Castiel carried Dean carefully back to the house. He placed Dean down on the kitchen table and then collected a few strawberries to give to Dean. It was entertaining to watch Dean gobble up the berries. His mouth was red, like he'd eaten something bloody, and Castiel briefly amused himself with the idea of a killer guinea. It reminded him vaguely of some movie Dean had told him about that had a killer bunny.
Dean rolled his eyes in response. “Yeah, yeah. You have any fun things planned over break?”
“I am.” He answers.
"What the hell happened?"
"April," Castiel said, surprised, "I wasn't expecting you to call."
“A betta fish. It’s a small freshwater fish, but your fins greatly resemble them. If you have any of the functions of a normal betta fish, then your fins should be able to grow back when they’re injured. I don’t know much more about the specific impacts of your fins on swimming off the top of my head, but I would think that their lightweight and flexibility have some sort of benefit in agility.”
Castiel strolled leisurely throughout his garden. He stopped and kneeled by a few plants that were a little wilted and sent just a bit of magic to heal them and guide them in growth. They trembled in response.
away.
“Not a problem, Cas. Sorry you had to deal with his meltdown.”
* * * * *
Castiel looked to Dean and found the familiar staring at him with a blank expression.
“I found a pair of keys in my pants.” Sam added. “There was a house alarm, but also a sticky note next to it with the code. The house all this stuff that could've been ours.”
Castiel follows him into the apartment and to the couch.
I don't own supernatural
"I apologize." Castiel said. "I will not be trying that again. Please stay put."
To be outright denied on his first and only attempt at sexual conduct was more mortifying than Castiel had ever imagined it would be.
What he did need was another drink. Before he could flag down the bartender for the fourth time, a figured slid into the seat to his right. Dean didn’t even have to look to know who it was. "Is this seat taken?" They asked.
“No,” Dean replied forcefully. “It was a fucking longshot and we knew it!”
Dean still made no move to climb onto the bed. Instead he stood next to it as he traced his palms up over Castiel’s calves, moving higher and higher until he was caressing the inside of Cas’s thighs. Cas watched as Dean pulled his hand away and clicked open the bottle of lubricate, pouring some onto his fingers. Castiel knew what Dean wanted then and he pulled his legs open enough for his friend’s fingers to find their mark.
“Thanks, Papa.”
Something in Dean’s features dropped for a second but it was gone before Cas could read it. “Right—yeah. Okay.” He turned back to the kids and started giving hugs, uttering ‘I love you,’ to each of them.
“Did Sam tire you out?”
). He smiled to himself and checked the time, hoping that Dean might get home earlier than usual today, just so Cas could spend a little more time with him.
“Go talk to him,” Dean encouraged but not before adding, “but I swear if you don’t come back—”
Now, he knows his kids don’t always act this way. They are hellions even on the best of days and Dean puts up with a
but didn’t have the chance to say anything as the two younger boys exchanged odd glances.
“Hey guys. I’m gonna head out.”
He ate in silence for some time, content to watch the others at the table converse with one another.
Dean pulled his head up to look into Cas’s bright eyes for a moment. He didn’t know where the question had came from but he figured if Cas had brought it up it was worth answering honestly. Not that he ever had a reason to be dishonest anyway.
Cas didn’t feel like that was all it was but he let it slide, knowing Dean had to get to class. He figured he could try some creative ways to help Dean get some better sleep later, for now he had his last first day of class to attend.
“Others at this school speak fondly of you, Dean.” He said it so matter-of-factly that Dean couldn’t help but flush. Before Dean could say something flippant or sarcastic in response, Castiel drew the conversation to a close.
Dean’s eyebrows drew together as he took in the angel sitting on the bed. Castiel offered him a smile.
“I was shocked.” Dean interrupted. He looked… sad almost? Like his heart hurt too. "I didn’t, in my wildest dreams, think you’d kiss me.”
That was enough for Cas to crack a smile.
He watched Cas’s eyes fall shut as Rowena spoke her next words.
“Okay,” Cas agreed quietly, he looked uncomfortable but he must’ve known Dean wouldn’t just throw him to the sharks since he nodded and smiled slightly. “We can go. Is tomorrow okay?”
have other people who aren’t complete dipshits like Dean to be with…
“I know. I know.” He hung his head in shame. He’d been such a fool. “But Bobby, I’ll never do that again. I will
“You’re uncomfortable.” Cas finally said into the void between them.
Castiel must have picked up on his hesitance because he looked Dean sternly in the eyes. “Anything that you’re willing to teach me. So long as you’re comfortable with it.”
“Night, Castiel. Thanks for talking to me about this.”
The wheels in Cas’s mind started churning. What exactly did he want to ask Dean?
“Love you too.”
“Should we head back?” Dean asked to which Cas nodded his head. The angel needed less help getting back to the motel but he was still shuffling along slowly, likely exhausted from everything he’d been through.
Cas’s heart thrummed in his chest as Dean drifted awake slowly, nuzzling against Cas’s chest as he stretched his limbs.
That made Dean laugh.
Dean seemed to have a preference for being in the comfort of his own room opposed to the other common areas in the bunker which in turn is where they spent most of their time. When Dean started to form the habit of nodding off less than an hour into their time together and
With a sharp tug Cas managed to free his coat from the others, answering Dean’s question almost as aggressively as he’d just dislodged the item. “Shouldn’t we be going home?”
“Yes, this one’s warm.”
He had smiled against the pillow, convincing himself that maybe Dean had woken up early and gone out to get them some breakfast and would be back soon but when an hour had passed, then two, and Dean hadn’t returned, Castiel started to doubt himself. He eventually realized that it was Thursday and Dean was probably in class but when four o’clock, then five o’clock showed up and Dean still hadn’t come home, Castiel knew something was wrong.
It took a few moments for both of their spasming limbs to start to calm down. And even though no part of him wanted to stop touching Cas he finally pulled his fingers away, wiped them on the sheet, and started gently rubbing Cas’s back as he slowly stopped shaking.
loves you. I knew you two had found your way back to each other after the weddin’. It was in his eyes—the way he was seeing light again instead of darkness. Every day I’ve seen him since, he’s looked better than he has in a year and I just worry that it’s not going to last. I worry that he’s just some love sick fool you’re stringing along because it makes you feel better about yourself—that you’re waiting for someone your family would approve of and having fun with Dean in the meantime. I thought I’d had you figured out before, but then you left… now I don’t know what to think.”
but somehow a few words had managed to slip through.
“Oh god.”
That required too much work though.
“Of course I would have done the same. That doesn’t mean you get to do it!”
“Of course,” she replied. “Let’s go right now?”
Dean needed him and Castiel wouldn’t leave, not when his friend sounded so fearful of his rest.
The house still felt off even though he and the kids were working together. It was like without Dean around their home lacked the same warmth they’d all grown accustomed to. Even the littlest ones were already itching for their daddy to come home.
“Je t'offre un verre?”
“What’s up Cas?”
He frowned thinking about all the harsh things the other kids at school might be saying to his child. Kids could be so cruel without any remorse or understanding for what the words that came out of their mouths could do to people. He understood it was more likely that Ben just wanted to share his problems with Cas more than he wanted his Papa to try and speak with the school about them, but he couldn’t help but feel protectiveness flair up inside him. He wouldn’t do anything until Ben asked him to though.
Heat blossomed in Cas’s abdomen immediately. It wasn’t often that Cas topped, only purely because Cas couldn’t get enough of Dean and Dean seemed unable to get enough of him either. He’d wanted it, craved it really, when they’d first gotten together. In all honesty he just wanted Dean in every single way he could have him but he’d been too afraid to ask. Part of him thought Dean might not want him in that way or would be disgusted if Cas ever brought it up. But his insecurities had been for not when Dean expressed his interest in switching the night of their engagement. And Castiel, well he could hardly deny his man anything and jumped at the occasion—doing everything in his power to make it as good for Dean as possible. It’s a night Cas often finds himself drifting back to, remembering the oneness he felt with Dean, being able share something they’d never shared with anyone else.
Gabe sighed and shook his head. “I hope one day you grow up and realize that if you keep this up, you’re going to grow up as miserable as Mom.”
“I thought you were excited to graduate?”
He wasn’t a crier. He didn’t cry. He teared up when a sad movie came on or when he missed his dad but he didn’t ever cry over anything. Until now.
“Wait. How about—how about you lay on your back? I want—uh most of the time first times are uh in the missionary positions so I uh, I want you to experience it that way but if you hate it you can lay on your stomach obviously. Or if that’s how you’d prefer it then it can be on your stomach I was just thinking…”
for him.”
He just didn’t know how much longer Cas would want to do this with him before he started asking for more again and Dean honestly didn’t think his resolve was strong enough to withstand Cas asking for sex again. He knew just one look into those pleading blue eyes and Dean would probably crumble. He was barely keeping his resolve together by a tiny thread because when Cas asked him if they could have sex, Dean wanted more than anything to say yes.
He said he’d met a guy from the university, at a bar, on a Sunday and decided to work out an agreement to mess around. Casual. Nothing that required his best friend to know the guy’s name and Facebook stalk him because Cas didn’t think it warranted it.
“Dean, it is straight and has been this whole time—though that does make it the only thing out of place in this room.” The not-quite-there wink Castiel managed had Dean crack the smallest of smiles. It wasn’t the other man’s best joke but it did its job in alleviating some of Dean’s trepidation for a fleeting moment.
“That’s good.” Dean whispered in encouragement.
Castiel shook his head. “I did not. I was… I was caught up reading again.”
“Quite a few actually, all by my father though they do not live with me. I have four older brothers and two sisters my age.”
Being on his belly with a pillow underneath was a lot safer. He didn’t like not being able to see Dean but the trade off of not feeling so on display was comforting. Even Dean seemed to like the position, growing bolder in his wrist movements, thrusting faster and deeper than he had when Cas had been able to look at him. That fact in and of itself had Cas’s mind swirling again with thoughts though. Maybe Dean didn’t like looking at Cas. Maybe, he too, was more comfortable when he didn’t have to see Cas’s clearly
The tendrils of hope Dean had clinged to, trying to convince himself this would work, washed out of him like a broken damn.
“You know you don’t have to buy things for me. I really don’t care. But I do appreciate it.” He smiled widely at his friend, hoping Cas understood that he really was appreciative.
“We agreed to help me learn how to pleasure another person. I already know how to pleasure myself so there’s no reason for you to deal with that too.”
It was the glint in Cas’s eyes that had Dean lowering his voice suggestively. “I won’t tell if you don’t tell.”
“Yes.”
“S’my fault.”
But what if he was wrong? He could just be wrong…
Cas’s forehead dropped to Dean’s hipbone.
All this time he hadn’t been able to look Dean directly in the eye but now that he did, he saw a small amount of fear reflected back at him. His heart nearly plummeted into his stomach. Had he just ruined three years of friendship for this?
“What?”
He got to the church at the perfect time—not too early that he was forced to make awkward small talk with the other guests, but not too late that he’d be considered rude. Though he wanted to make himself as invisible as possible, Anna truly was his friend and he didn’t want to be sitting back row as she married the man of her dreams. Sucking up his pride he walked, eyes down, to find a seat somewhere in the middle of the church. He didn’t recognize the woman with the baby he sat down next to, but based on the kind smile she offered him that immediately clued him in that she was on the groom’s side of the family.
“What?!”
Castiel caught the shimmer in Dean's eyes as his boyfriend replied, "Hell yeah!"
Dean squinted as he searched the enclosure and tried to follow Claire's pointing finger. Sure enough, a large panda bear sat next to some bamboo in the far corner with a panda cub in its lap. It was rather adorable, and Dean moved just a bit closer.
"I don't know." He said. "I hope that Crowley only said that to make us nervous."
“I’m fortunate my brother was available to watch over Claire this weekend.” Castiel said. That was neutral, right?
“What does that mean?”
“Gross.” Sam comments.
The figure let out a bitter laugh. "Buddy, I've been here a long time. I know plenty."
"Ya sure?" Charlie questioned, squinting at him with suspicion. "You've seemed stressed."
Dean rolled his eyes. “Ugh, whatever. Go ask and then come back.”
“Thank you, Aidan.” Lisa said. “Gordon?”
That snapped Castiel in focus and he nodded, not wanting to have to think about the amount of teasing he'd have to endure if Gabriel came to collect them.
"It was nothing." Dean said with a wave of his hand. "She just can't function without coffee."
"This is where I grew up." Dean said. "Most of the time, at least. You've met everyone here, right?"
Dean swallows. “There are couches in the Bunker.”
Shame sharpened Sam's scent. Castiel felt pity stir in his stomach.
They trekked for the whole day, past where Castiel thought the secret exit from the original fortress might be. He could feel that they were closer to Heaven. The air seemed lighter and less oppressing, and the trees started to thin from overbearing to bushy. Every-so-often a bird would fly overhead.
Dean shuffled next to him. "Alright."
With that, Dean dashed away from the room.
The sound of a cord stretching and wood flexing made him stop his movements. Castiel quickly caught sight of the demon archers and his heart sunk. They aimed for Dean. If Castiel tried to block their fire with his wings, it would be easy for them to overpower him.
Castiel flinched when Dean's hands first came into contact with his wings. Castiel forced himself to relax and lean into Dean's touch.
“What are you guys talking about?”
He manages to stay quiet for a whole two minutes.
“Tell me what’s going on!”
"I must say, I did not expect to meet the great garrison leader Castiel this way." He said. Castiel said nothing.
His friend.
Castiel smiled at that. “Yes, I thought he might enjoy the basics a little.”
He was in a hospital room. The walls were padded and bare. The door looked enforced.
Once they finished their drinks, Sam, Cas, and Jack were eager to explore and take pictures, but Dean wanted to spend some more time in the Cantina since it was so cool. Charlie stayed with him.
“It was more than that, Mr. Walker,” Lisa said, “Students are encouraged, but not forced, to spend time with more students than just their friends, but that is not what happened. Gordon and Aidan worked to prevent Adam from enjoying recess at all. There was even some physical altercation between Gordon and Adam. Gordon pushed Adam.”
(See the end of the chapter for
I don't own Supernatural
"Missed you, Jo." Dean said. Then he looked around at the rest of the group. "I missed all of you guys."
Their awkward silence was broken by the presence of a little girl.
* * * * *
"I'm excited to see Sammy again," Dean said slowly, scratching at the back of his neck, "But what if he's mad at me?"
They stayed like that for a while, until the clock chimed and drew them both from their thoughts.
"I'm eating at the restaurant." Cas - Mr. Novak answered, eyeing him. "What are you doing here?"
"You're always welcomed here, Dean." She said softly.
Castiel could never forgive himself if something happened to Dean and their child.
Castiel looked down, still stunned.
"I don't give a fuck." Dean said, shoving his mouth full. "I'm fucking starving."
The beatings did not let up. Like clockwork, the demons would arrive at the same time (according to Castiel's inner clock) and take him to be tortured by Alastair. The demon was creative, Castiel would give him that, and he seemed to be enjoying Castiel's mute protest. He began to question Castiel on basically everything: strategies, tactics, war secrets, and the likes. Castiel remained strong and stone-faced, though. The thought of his fallen comrades, their blood and wings marring the terrain, helped him to keep his strength. Dean, too.
"Sounds good to me."
“Right. Was that all you wanted to see me for?”
Dean licked his lips and nodded. “That’s cool. I, uh, I’m bi. It’s one of the reasons my dad and I don’t really get along.”
let me know what you think... we're almost at the end now
"Yes, I do believe that is what we have to do." Castiel said. "Is this really what you want, Dean? Please, tell me if this is something you feel obligated to do. I'll find another way for you to live if you do not want to form this bond. I'll spend every minute I have."
"Garth," he said, "have any of you heard anything about the archangel Gabriel?"
“This was today?” Castiel asked. “Before the end of the school day?”
Castiel startled at the question and answered before he could stop himself, "Because
"I said I'm fine." Dean cut in sharply, and Castiel's mouth snapped shut.
Dean's cell was quiet, and Castiel hoped that meant the omega was resting.
"It is rather remarkable that you were able to pass my wards. They are supposed to alert me if another magical being tries to enter, and they should keep most magical beings out."
Castiel took three long strides to get to Dean, then pulled him into a tight hug.
Maybe Castiel didn't want to live alone, though. He wouldn't mind being with Dean and their fledging.
Dean kicked his feet again. “I saw my dad last night.”
He heard his assistant gulp over the line and rolled his eyes.
Of course. Dean's pup.
“It was nice meeting you, Dean.”
Castiel smiled back at Dean, reassured by his mate’s easy answers and relaxation.
“I guess I forgot.”
Holy fuck.
Slowly his other senses cleared. He felt grass, surprisingly soft, beneath him. There was a light breeze drifting through his wings. The sun was warm against his face. It smelled flowery, like a meadow.
Gabriel was his attendant in the morning. He acted his normally obnoxious and cheerful self. Dean was sure he was pretending not to recognize Dean’s foul mood, which Dean appreciated. The last thing he wanted to do was explain to someone why he was unhappy.
"Yes." Castiel said. "I have never heard of this cat you speak about."
Castiel placed the bee stuffed animal down gently and picked up the card. He glanced up when Dean’s scent soured further with anxiety. Dean gave Castiel a strained grin and waved his hand.
Castiel flinches, and Dean goes still.
“I won’t leave, Dean.” Castiel promised.
It’d only been a few days, really, and not enough time for Castiel to be certain but he felt in his gut something was up with Dean. He’d talk to Cas but wouldn’t say much and his mood wasn’t as light as it had been before Sam arrived.  It wasn’t drastic but it made Cas wonder if he’d done something wrong.
He can’t say he’s surprise just how understanding his brother was and how gentle he’d been when encouraging Dean to talk to Cas.
“Then they’re yours.”
He was mostly staring at his computer screen wondering when the surge of motivation would hit him hard enough to finish the conclusion to his ‘History of The Beatles’ paper he was writing for one of his electives. Generally, he was pretty eager to hash out work for this course but his mind felt a little… off. No matter how much he tried to focus he kept coming back to the same thoughts and he was eager to ignore them just a little bit longer. Thankfully his buzzing phone called for his immediate attention.
“You’ve changed much as well.” Castiel noted. The last time he’d seen his eldest brother, the other man had been shorter, much skinner, and still resembled a teenager more than a grown man.
Dean knew in the grand scheme of things, he wasn’t special. He was extraordinarily plain, just another person wandering this earth leaving a small mark on it but not enough to change the course of the world, yet Cas made him feel like he was everything. The way Castiel looked at him made him feel like treasure. The way Cas touched him made him feel like the universe began and ended with just them.
Sam look absolutely dumbfounded. “What?”
Castiel automatically looked to Dean, seeking guidance for his siblings’ curiosity. Seeing Dean’s nod of encouragement, Castiel took a deep breath before standing.
Dean couldn’t keep his eyes off him, even as he pressed the dildo in and out of Cas’s ass, he couldn’t keep his eyes on the way Cas’s eyes closed and his body writhed on the bed. Not able to think straight, Dean let his left hand wander up Cas’s thigh and up across his belly, suddenly meeting one of Cas’s stray hands and gripping onto him tightly.
For whatever reason this made Dean laugh. “So? I forgot your
“Guaranteed,” the man promised. He sounded so earnest that Andrea couldn’t see why she shouldn’t head on over there. She could do with finding a couple of plants that would make her bland apartment a little livelier.
Number by number people started picking away at the presents.
He might’ve been annoyed with that comment if at that same moment he hadn’t tripped on a large box on the floor.
Despite having known Dean almost all of his life, people wound up giving him a wide berth at school. Rumors had a way of making people think he could somehow flip a switch and go crazy just by getting the wrong look in the hallways. It was mostly amusing though, as Dean had never once been in a fight until then. Hell, he never even got in one after.
Growing up Castiel had been asked more times than he could count if Gabriel really took good care of him, or if he was happy living with him. Sometimes they’d go as far to bring Gabriel to his school and interrogate him on the way he was raising Cas. And as a little kid he just didn’t understand. His dad was the best dad he could be. He helped Cas whenever he needed to, he read stories with him, he taught him how to tie his shoes and ride a bike. As a little boy, Cas just thought Gabriel was silly and he didn’t know why not everyone thought that too.
His dad leaned over the kitchen island and rested his elbows on the granite, pondering his words. He always seemed to carefully choose what he would say when explaining his family to Castiel.
“What do you say,” Mary spoke, looking at all the boys, “now that I have a day off, we can bake some cookies and watch A Christmas Story?”
“Right. Are you sure you’ll be good to drive the whole way?”
Cas’s face lit up at the picture painted in his mind. “Alright. Race you,” he said in a playful challenge.
His heart threatened to catapult out of his chest as the truth finally poured out of him. He didn’t want any of this. Yeah sure, he guessed he wanted his fiancé to have the wedding of his dreams but the man was taking the whole ‘Prince is my last name’ thing way too seriously. There was a string quartet ready to march them down the aisle and a fucking horse drawn carriage waiting to take them to the reception venue when all was said and done. That’s not what Dean wanted on his wedding day.
But things weren’t looking good.
Cas would understand if Dean might have feelings but wanted to keep a relationship a secret from other people. Coming out was hard and it might take Dean time to get used to if that was what was happening. But he didn’t know. Did Dean even like guys? Maybe he was ashamed for enjoying what he and Cas were doing and that was why he didn’t want to ask for anything more. Maybe him enjoying it was just a fluke and when they were done he would go back to only enjoying sex with girls.
Nope. Didn’t happen.
“What’s your fucking problem?”
Not that Dean would have been invited, but Cas didn’t have to know that. Besides, he didn’t really want to spend a night playing video games with those guys. What he did want was a normal night in with his best friend who he’d barely gotten to see in the past few days.
“Last night a baby boy was surrendered to a local fire station. He was brought to the hospital and all tests have shown him to be completely healthy. The hospital contacted us right away and placed him in our care. Castiel, you and Dean are the first on our list and I understand that this is such short notice but if you want him, he’s all yours.”
“Hey, it’s okay.” Dean said with a shy smirk. “But it makes a guy a little insecure when someone just stares at it…”
“Do you even want this?” Castiel pleaded. He couldn’t take it if Dean said no.
“Yeah!”
It had all started a few months back once they’d returned from the apocalypse world—perhaps even before that really. It had taken weeks for Castiel to notice that something was wrong with Dean. Between returning from the empty, being captured by Asmodeus, searching for a way to get to the apocalypse world, and Lucifer breathing down their necks, there hadn’t exactly been a lot of spare moments to notice how little Dean was sleeping.
“Would you be interested in something like that?”
“Boo. I’ve been missing you.”
The only silver lining Dean saw with Sam bringing this us was that Cas knew firsthand that Dean wasn’t, in fact, slutting it up. He looked to his best friend to see Cas with a much paler complexion, looking like he’d rather be anywhere else. Dean pleaded with his eyes for his friend to back him up and only that seemed to shake Cas out of his stupor.
A mug of water—Cas’s favorite mug—was placed in his hands and he drank the liquid thirstily before thanking Dean for the kindness.
This was new territory for them and Cas was a little out of his element. He was starting to learn that the hardest part about entering the world of sexuality was actually asking for what he wanted. He knew Dean was open to trying things out with him but the words still stayed at the tip of his tongue, especially since he and Dean had talked about doing more.
He couldn’t explain what was happening but somehow he knew where he needed to go, he wasn’t consciously thinking of which turns he needed to make or how long he needed to stay on a particular road--he simply trusted the Grace to show him the way.
Castiel knew his early arrival to classes was deemed unusual, but it made him feel more comfortable. “I like to be early.”
Dean must’ve been on his same wavelength. “Touch yourself, come on, you need to come.”
They’d been through bumps before but nothing ever felt like this. Him, Cas, his kids—they weren’t meshing the way they use to and Dean couldn’t help but feel it was on him. What else could it be? He’d been tense and short tempered lately. Always demanding his kids do this and that—he’d been on their asses about everything and… he could lighten up. He should lighten up more.
Already this was amazing but riding Dean’s dick on their too small couch, it checked off a box of Cas’s fantasies he hadn’t been able to voice yet.
“Nah. I got it. Thank you though.”
“What?”
For a moment Castiel thought Dean wouldn’t finish his thought since his pause lasted so long. He could almost hear Dean’s heart beating as the time passed.
It was all so terrifying yet it had an undercurrent of excitement too. No one could tell what the future would bring, and it was equal parts horrifying and magical.
Dean didn’t think he was bad in bed, in fact he always thought he was pretty decent but… Dean had seen nothing like this from anyone. Yeah, maybe it was different because Cas was a dude and maybe dudes got off a little more explosively than girls did, but even Dean was coming harder than he ever had, even with the bendiest of chick’s he’d fooled around with.
“Why not?”
“Do you think you could stay here? Or will you be move away after graduation?”
“I’d like that.” Cas replied.
cheated on me. It was all a misunderstanding. I let my fear of not being good enough; my fear that I was too old for him, too bland for him, cloud my judgment. I let you and Meg tell me how much Dean cared for me instead of listening to him myself.
Dean was the luckiest son of a bitch the world had ever seen because he’d gotten to marry his high school sweetheart straight out of college. It was one of the biggest events their town had ever seemed (or that’s how their immediate friends and family talk about their wedding). Neither he nor Cas cared about having a large wedding but their family and friends had planned everything for them, all they had to do was show up.
The man reached his hand out. “I’m Cole, this is my girlfriend Marie.” He said gesturing to a short brunette to his left. She smiled sweetly and waved.
“Yes. I was clearly not paying much attention to where I was walking,” The guy admitted sheepishly.
His answer didn’t seem to satisfy the other man.
“Mm?”
And when they were able to take their dinner outside onto a small patio, just the two of them, it felt really freaking special and Dean knew he wanted so many more nights just like that. But the night wasn’t quite over yet.
Are you going out tonight?
“Yes.”
His lips morphed into a smirk. “Can I tell you something?”
In theory it was true despite the fact that his body, mind, and heart said he’d probably never feel okay. He hoped it was just the alcohol talking.
Dean pointed each person out by name, “Benny, Jo, Charlie, Kevin, Ash, Jess, and you know Sam,” before setting Castiel’s food down and gesturing for him to sit down.
“Lets go in.” Cas said, putting on a fake smile. “I could use some fries or something.” He opened the car door and hurriedly got out before Dean could say anything.
I didn't know how to fit this into this chapter but I do just want to give a brief insight to Anna's sudden change. After the chapter that made everyone hate her, she went home ranting and raving to her mother about the whole thing. Now, their mother is never going to forgive Chuck for everything that happened but she never intended for her hurt over the whole ordeal to turn her children so bitter towards their father. She definitely never intended for them to isolate their own half-brother. So, realizing after all these years just what she's done she sat down and had a talk with Anna explaining everything that happened (including Naomi's personality) and explained to Anna that she couldn't put the blame of her and Chuck's failed marriage on Castiel's shoulder. She even admitted to always thinking Cas was a sweet kid based on the stories Hannah and Gabriel would tell about him. It made Anna see that maybe things weren't as black and white as she thought and that maybe Castiel deserved a little more kindess from her.
It might’ve been his imagination but it looked like Cas’s breath caught a little.
Words he felt in his own heart too.
“What?”
“Come here.”
Cas couldn’t help but laugh and roll his eyes at the other boy. “Maybe a little.”
“Ready as I’m gonna be,” Dean shrugged, flopping down right next to Cas so their thighs were touching. “How ‘bout you?”
The angel frowned at him. It looked like tears were flooding the corners of his eyes.
Gabriel’s scent sweetened before he managed to dull it. He was pleased with Dean’s response, then.
"More or less." The demon shrugged. "As I said before, Alastair's getting a little too high and mighty, and this will take him down a bit. At least it will give me a reason to yell at him. Since you have something important, I assume you can at least make the angels and demons stop fighting long enough to talk this out like reasonable adults. I'll admit that I'm not the highest of demons, but I'm damn close. I can convince a substantial amount to listen, and I'll dispose of those who disagree, if I can."
“Welcome back, sirs.” He said, not meeting their eyes. “Have a nice ride?”
Castiel tried to pray to the other angels, but it was no use. He'd figured as much. He hadn't heard any prayers since his capture, but still, it had been worth a shot.
As much as Cas wanted to see Dean’s face when he opened his present, Cas also knew what was in the box. He’d seen the wood face watch with the leather band and had immediately thought about how attractive it’d look on Dean’s wrist. The price wasn’t really in the range he and Dean silently seemed to have agreed on in the past, but he knew his friend would immediately think it too much and insist Cas took it back. Wanting to someday see that watch on Dean’s wrist, he knew it was best to make Dean open the first when he was states away and couldn’t refuse it.
When he was on his third waffle of the morning, his dad quickly left the room, coming back a few seconds later with a small red package.
“I’m not using him.”
The days were still not letting up, but Castiel was getting through. After his and Dean’s talk, things were starting to move forward with them. They were doing their best to use their words and talk when things upset them, but it was still a work in progress. It was Friday night though, and Dean had promised his a night of video games and blowjobs so Castiel was starting to perk up at the thought, he already had a bag in his car and was ready to completely unwind with his love.
I hope you all found this last chapter to be satisfying. Thank you to everyone who has read and loved He Didn't Have to Be. I never would have imagined my first Destiel fanfic to get so much support. You are all so wonderful to me.
Only Dean didn’t seem to be thinking along those lines.
certain, just mostly.
“Oh, you think being your go to person for saying ‘can I buy you a drink’ in other languages is marketable?”
He’d never admit it to Hannah, or to anyone really, but now that his orgasms were far more regular than ever, he swore his fantasies were getting more and more intense. Now, in the few and far between times Castiel was left in their dorm while Dean was attending his classes or with friends, Castiel found himself with his hand around his dick and his mind racing with thoughts of what it would feel like to have Dean’s mouth all over his body and the beautiful cock he’d become so familiar with inside of him.
“Alrighty then. See you tomorrow. Text me when you’re hungry.”
Jack nodded, “I’ll ask.”
“Damn, your dad has a serious collection of the Supernatural books. I didn’t know there were this many limited editions. Is he like a huge fan or something?”
“The Dean I know loves sex. Now he’s done with it?”
Castiel sighed with relief. “Thank you. Do we have something to play video games on?”
“Where’s the lube?”
“I’m fine,” he lied again, trying to keep the wetness in his eyes from spilling over. It was a small mercy that the room was still dark and he could only just make out Cas’s silhouette, at least the other man wouldn’t see how much of a wreck Dean was.
“Dean?”
“The spark is still there. It’s definitely still here. Oh, Dean.” Cas’s forehead came down to rest against Dean’s, their lips just barely touching. “I always want you. I swear. I look at you and feel the same way I did twenty years ago. How could I not when you still look like this after all this time? So perfect.”
“Fuck you.”
Have you opened your gift yet?
Settling on Dean’s “Dean Cave,” where the eldest Winchester had banned anyone non-family from occupying, Castiel flopped down onto the couch and sighed.
“Thank you, Dean.”
“And you know that I was right about this, correct?”
“Sounds wonderful.”
There was no doubt in Dean’s mind that the witch knew they were coming and it only made it more evident as they came squealing into the back parking lot of the warehouse after Sam had floored it down the state highway.
On the tray of food Dean had brought to him in bed the next morning, next to his fork, was a small note written on memo pad.
"Cas?"
How could he let Cas be with someone like that? Dean was always going to be a mess. He had the best thing that could ever happen to him and he was still scared of it. And to make it all worse he would always have to struggle with his problems… his past, his nightmare, the depression he sometimes fell into.
“Are you okay?” Cas asked as he fell into his beanbag with a groan. Dean watched his friend twist his torso left and right trying to get a satisfying crack out of it. He felt like a dick for making his friend sleep on someone else’s floor.
A bright smile flooded Dean’s cheeks and Cas was helpless at the sight.
Maybe he knew how.
“You did? Why?”
He draped her softest blanket over her and flicked on her nightlight, ready to tell her goodnight but her little voice cut him off before he could speak.
The ones he still had downstairs all decided they wanted to watch a movie once everything was cleaned up, so Dean snuggled up with them on the couch for a little while, up until they were ready for bed.
“Thank you.” Dean offered as he led Castiel out to the living room.
Immediately Cas did as told, wrapping his hand around his own cock as Dean kept pounding into him. It wasn’t long before he was toppling over the edge and feeling Dean pulling out of him with a primal groan.
“I did. But waking up was even sweeter.”
“Sammy? What’s wrong?”
Dean suddenly found the ground around his boots far more interesting than looking Castiel in the eye. He shrugged his shoulders nonchalantly. “Sometimes.”
Dean couldn’t help but smirk a little. Who didn’t have a sex noise kink? It was always so thrilling to hear the way you were making someone feel. Now it was Dean’s turn to try and drive some of those same noises out of Cas. Knowing he wasn’t brave enough to use his hands, he worked with the only tool he had: his voice.
“I kind of want to tour it when school’s in, though,” Sam’s voice had just enough disappointment in it to make Dean want to fold like a card table but the thought of having to still go to classes while his brother was visiting didn’t sound as much fun as getting to hang out with Sam as much as he could.
Mary pulled Castiel into a tight hug, rocking him back and fourth with some sort of holiday giddiness. “I’m still happy that you were here to see them put up.”
Dean does, however, remember how happy he’d been when Bobby did come to live with them. Bobby had set up the living room with Batman decorations and the two of them had a movie marathon watching all the cartoon Batman movies that Bobby could get his hands on. Dean even remembers that it was raining and Bobby let Dean go jump in the puddles with him. It was one of those nights that Dean assumed would be played on a reel if he ever made it to heaven or whatever. He remembers it as the first night that he thought that maybe
I don’t want to impose on your time with Sam.
He didn’t want to complain about her to Dean, having only just started forming a reluctant sort of friendship with his new roommate and didn’t want to give Dean a reason to give up on that. Besides, he knew Dean must’ve had some reasons to love Charlie if they’d been friends for so long but Castiel had struggled to see it.
“Really fucking good, huh? How do you feel?”
For a brief, panicked moment he suspected he’d fallen asleep somewhere embarrassing—like the room of the guy he’d attempted to go home with the night prior, but when he inhaled the familiar scent of warm vanilla sugar, he knew with certainty that he’d bothered Hannah into letting him crash on her floor instead of having to explain to Dean why he was such a mess the night before.
“We don’t have the money.” Dean argued back weakly.
“This is my home. At least for the time I have left.”
There was a bittersweet, but mostly bitter, feeling deep in his chest as the words fell from his lips yet there was no way to deny their truth. Castiel had asked for assistance with hand jobs and blow jobs and Dean knew there were only so many ways the other guy could suck his cock before Dean ran out of things to “teach.” It decidedly meant that their arrangement was coming to an end and Castiel could go off and put his new skills to whatever use he saw fit.
Cas was struggling to breathe, he looked ready to break down into hysterics. Dean reached forward, instinctually wanting to comfort him until Cas’s words finally resonated in his mind.
(See the end of the chapter for
A grind they call it: life. He couldn’t have found a better word to describe it. Grinding, taxing, suffocating…. Lonely. Even during the ten-year marriage that had finally ended a year ago, he never felt anything but lonely—not even in the beginning.
Inside him…
He looked over at Dean, sitting next to him on the bed, unshed tears pooling in both their eyes.
He’d forever deny that tears flooded to the edges of his vision as relief swept right through him. He knew he’d gotten lucky when she chose him and Sam… when she didn’t have to keep such broken little boys but loved them with everything she could anyway. But hearing these words from her mouth, it made him want to thank God, or the universe, or whoever for letting her be his mom.
“I’m not touching you until you say yes. I’m not going to do anything you don’t explicitly consent to. You say no and I’ll never ask again. But I want this. I trust you.”
“Are you gonna love him for ten more?”
“You want to talk to me?”
Castiel looked away, hearing a soft, “Is that the truth?” from across the island.
“Okay.”
When the three boys all came back into the living room, Castiel finally declared that he did not want to pick the video game since all the choices were too similar for him to make an adequate suggestion. This led to Sam declaring that they’d start him off with Mario Brothers.
And right now he had his hands all over Cas’s skin, trailing up over the back of his thighs. It was perfect, it was all just so fucking perfect he felt like he was going out of his mind. The plains of Cas’s stomach were smooth and trembled just slightly every time let his hands wander just enough to caress. His thighs and his legs, rough with hair—something Dean never once thought he’d find sexy but knowing that
“Are you still at the shop?”
They got back to their dorm and quietly went about getting ready for bed. Dean was first to jump in the shower, which left Cas to pitter around the room and clean up a little. By the time Dean was out, a towel wrapped around his waist, Cas had cleaned up a lot of the week’s mess and slid past Dean to take a shower of his own. He spent a little longer in the shower than he had planned but felt compelled to wash himself thoroughly just in the off chance that Dean decided to touch him.
“He wants either you or me to give him some tours around campus. I told him you’d probably be up for that.”
Cas couldn’t believe how quickly everything started to fly by. A little more than a year after they’d gotten together (well officially together), they finally graduated, Dean with his bachelors in Criminal Justice and Cas with his in Philosophy. It was only a few months after that that Dean had to start the Police Academy. A few weeks after
Dean hardly made it onto his feet and into the adjoining bathroom before Castiel heard violent retching sounds.
He wasn’t completely certain if he’d imagined it but between the pounding in his ears and Cas’s heavy breathing, he was fairly certain he heard his friend breathlessly mouth, “oh my god.”
He couldn’t tell just by the sound of Dean’s voice alone but he also really didn’t want to make eye contact with his friend to find out.
“Uh—the second one?”
It’s why it aches a little to see his name written with little balloons all over but not even getting a proper hug from any of his family members.
“Oh yeah? Tell that to your cracklin’ knees when you try and stand up.”
“Yeah but pulling luggage off those things is a two-hand deal. Just text me when you’re with your dad, okay?”
How could he do that? Live more than half of his life just following the whims and wishes of everyone around him. He wasn’t happy. Yet no one who ‘loved’ him ever asked him if he was. He’d never wanted to become this person. He didn’t want to become a shell of a man who had once held so many hopes for what his future would bring.
I really hope you loved this moment as much as I loved writing it!
And still Castiel found himself fumbling a little with his voice as he lingered at the end of lunch to finally ask.
His answer came out of his mouth easily, because the answer was as simple as breathing.
“Yes. Hand jobs and blow jobs seem the first logical task to learn.”
At first Dean had been uncomfortable with the idea, being that it didn’t seem normal for two men to have a baby shower (hell, they weren’t allowed to have paternity leave, and okay yeah Bobby insisted that Dean got to have it, despite knowing that was not exactly protocol—things didn’t work out for Cas as kindly though, as he was told by his district he could only take two weeks unpaid time off and that just kind of sucked). It had taken a hell of a lot of persistence from Jo and just one teeny tiny ‘please’ from Cas for Dean to give into the party.
that he’d known you, the idjit told me he was gonna marry you someday. I told him he was a damn fool for thinking he’d marry a guy he barely knew. But then I met you, saw how you looked at him like he hung the stars in the sky and I thought maybe the kid was onto something. Every year I waited for him to tell me you two had run off to Vegas or something crazy like you’d probably do. Then you were just gone.
Dean scratched the back of his neck and did not meet Castiel’s eyes. “Uh—Yeah. A bit. Yeah.”
“More. So much more.”
“I can’t.”
A searing pain went through Dean’s chest hearing those words. It’s not that he didn’t want Cas to be happy, in fact, he wanted nothing more for that man to get everything he could out of life—but hearing how his life had picked up so drastically after dropping Dean… it didn’t feel so good. It fucking killed him that he’d been such a deadweight to Cas all that time. Losing Cas had completely shattered Dean… but Cas had always been too bright a star to be stuck in Dean’s dreary storm covered skies.
“You’re never going to find him,” she said with her devilish grin. Her black eyes looked at him wildly and he could feel the rot of her words begin to creep into the pit in his stomach.
If it weren’t for Bobby working with him when all Dean’s teachers tried to write off his lack of attention as ‘lashing out,’ Dean’s pretty sure he wouldn’t have made it through high school let alone gotten into college.
He didn’t have the strength to tell his brother any more than that. Instead, he shoved the letter that had been clutched in his hands towards his brother and let him read for himself.
He just about melted and despite not wanting to get his hopes up… he couldn’t help but think that Dean’s message didn’t sound like something a friend would say. He was almost, mostly, pretty sure Dean liked him too and that was the most Castiel could have wished for that Christmas.
His heart was beating too quickly, he didn’t know if he could hold himself up much longer but he had to stand his ground. He couldn’t go back there with her. “I don’t want to.”
They stayed locked in an embrace for a few moments later before Dean caught the eye of some of Cas’s friends, looking like they didn’t want to interrupt the moment the two lovers were having. Not wanting to deprive Cas of time with his friends he kissed his husband’s hairline and pulled out of the hug.
Somewhere along the road he must have done something wrong. He must have forgotten to tell Cas how much he loved him. Must have forgotten a birthday or an anniversary, or fell asleep during one too many at home date-nights. He thought he’d been good; thought that by the way Cas whispered such delicious words of praise into his skin each night as they made love, that he was enough.
An employee’s voice broke into their conversation. “Order 15!”
Out of habit, he put his headphones into the port on his laptop, never feeling comfortable listening to the sounds of others having sex through his computer speakers even if he was alone. Dean propped the laptop up on a couple pillows that Cas had bought for the place, and slid down his basketball shorts and boxers, getting into a more comfortable position before pressing play.
Dean to touch him in a way he’d never been touched before, Cas nodded and brought his mouth back down to engulf Dean’s cock more enthusiastic than ever.
“I like it however you like it.” Dean cut him off, pressing the tip of his finger past the tight ring of muscle. “Tell me, do you like this?”
Castiel knew how much he’d been missing having Dean by his side at night but getting to feel it once more shocked him at how completely natural it felt to snuggle down against the mattress and let Dean’s head rest on his shoulder. The way Dean’s arm curved around Cas’s waist and pulled him close, fit like nothing else.
Dean turned and blinked at the other man, shocked. "Well fuck.” It might not have been eloquent but Dean wasn’t exactly good with vocabulary. “You always did know when I was going to do something before I did it." The laugh that followed his words was bittersweet.
“Oh god, Castiel. That’s called a booty call not a butt dial.” She hid her face in her hands, messing up her bangs as she laughed into her palms.
“Cas.”
“Wait what?”
He should’ve said something then. It was right there, about to cross his lips, but Cas started speaking first.
“Stop pretending like you care.”
They’d been home for hardly fifteen minutes and somehow he’d already managed to miss his six-year-old getting into the pantry, taking out a bag of goldfish, and carrying it to the couch and promptly spilling at least fifteen pieces between the cushions.
For some reason, Dean stared at him for a little while before shaking his head and grabbed something out of his sock drawer.
Well, maybe he did know...
I am sick right now so I'm not sure how I feel about this chapter as a whole and I worry it wasn't as well edited as it could be but I didn't want to wait another week to be able to post it. If I choose to go back and edit I will add a note to the beginning of the next chapter. I hope to have it up in 2-3 weeks (hopefully sooner but I have a couple bangs to work on).
That much was obvious.
But it never moved.
Jack looked prepared for this though and had laser focused on keeping her subdued long enough for Rowena to begin the extraction.
They hadn’t talked in two weeks. Two full weeks of avoiding looking at one another, leaving at least five feet of extra space as they navigated their room, and refusing to ask for help if something was lost or misplaced, it was excruciating.
And if it truly was, how sad that the last thing he did with his time with Cas was give him a chipped ring and be too scared to hug him.
from them on a daily basis… but right now? They’re being angels. He’s had to get all four kids up and out the door every day, not to mention himself, and it couldn’t have been going smoother. It makes him feel a little smug knowing that even though the littlest ones are apparently terrors for Dean in the mornings, they haven’t caused any problems with him.
He could feel Cas’s nerves from the whole situation and he hoped that his own weren’t showing but he wanted to do this for Cas. The whole point of this arrangement was to help Castiel feel more confident in himself as a sexual being and Dean could at least do this for him! He just needed to offer a little encouragement.
I know, I know it’s too much but I thought it’d look good on you.
There it was. That’s what he was looking for.
As gradually as he’d been drifting back into himself, Dean nearly reeled back when Cas’s words snapped him forcefully into his body.
“You think him living in Hicksville is good for him?” His mother wasn’t one to relax easily. She’d drive into any nerve people had until she got her way. Castiel wasn’t surprise to hear her do that with his father. “What, do you want him to follow in his father’s footsteps? Get his high school girlfriend pregnant too so that he can live a sad, pathetic life wishing he could have done more with it?”
“Baby…”
With a clank of his glass on the counter Dean moved to rest his chin on his hand and stared at Cas with large doe eyes. “Cas? Do you believe in fairytales?”
He made sure to make a matching mark on Cas’s opposite thigh before he was brave enough to look up.
The pint-sized archangel wore his obnoxious grin and perched at the end of the war table.
When Castiel finally came home with both Dean and Jack, he felt so unbelievably happy.
Dean hunched in on himself a little at Castiel's probing question, making Castiel's stomach clench with regret.
Dean frowned and his forehead crinkled. "We just got here, though. I haven't seen Bobby 'n the others in years."
Across the room, Gabriel grinned at him and rose his glass. Castiel rose his glass slightly in return.
Dean woke up on the day before his wedding full of dread. He didn’t want to be married to Lucifer. He didn’t want to be separated from Cas. He couldn’t help but spend the first hour of his day crying. When Cas came for his shift, Dean had to hurry to wipe away the tears and powder his face to hide the redness. There wasn’t anything he could do about his scent, though.
Castiel moved to take Jack back from Dean, but Dean shifted away. He yawned and patted the bed next to him.
"I'm sorry, Claire." Dean said.
"Dean-"
"I do." Gabriel answered. "Why?"
This was a good thing, right?
Castiel felt his blood still in his veins.
Castiel took a moment to ponder why he cared about the scent bond at all. He wasn't often attracted to other angels, and he couldn't figure out why he would be attracted to Dean now. In the end, Castiel decided it was their mutual situation that made Castiel so clingy.
"Not really." Castiel replied, glancing to the hallway."I believe we were moved because the angels came for us."
Sam brightened and looked around the table.
feeling better, and it was definitely because of his conversation with Castiel. The alpha had an effect on Dean that he didn’t understand.
"Joanna." Ellen scolded, eyes flickering over to Castiel briefly. "There's an angel here."
Dean glanced at him, looking guilty.
“I can’t promise I’ll reply right away.” He said. “My hands are quite full Claire.”
Michael's face lit up, and a queasy feeling settled in Castiel's stomach.
"A man? You got yourself a manny?" Balthazar snorted.
"Then let me out of here!" The man hissed.
“Ah, fuck.” Dean muttered, mouth full.
It had felt amazing.
Dean's eyes softened and he kissed Castiel again. Castiel felt like jelly as he leaned against Dean. Dean's lips moved so perfectly against his own that Castiel couldn't help sighing and mover closer still and tilting his head just right to deepen their kiss and-
” Claire shouted, tugging on Castiel’s coat.
Dean rolled his eyes. "You've gotta be a little less vague, dude."
If you ever want to chat or yell at me you can do so at my
“Sushi.” Dean agreed. He reached over and grabbed Cas’s hand. Cas squeezed it in return.
I'm super tired so hopefully this makes sense and there aren't too many mistakes - I was just very excited to get it posted, I couldn't wait
He would not look too much into it. He
“We don’t have to.” Dean says quickly.

house.
“You can sleep now.” Castiel told him. “I’ll be just outside.”
They stayed longer still, into the twilight hours, watching the lightning bugs dance around.
when he wakes. He has to suck in a breath and ball his hands into fists to keep down any noise.
Dean shrugged, still smiling. “I guess. The answer would still be no, though. Can’t say there’s anyone I’m looking at right now.”
The waitress shoots him a winning smile. “Now that we’ve got that all figured, go on and take a seat, and I’ll get you a slice of pie.”
"Claire, you look so pretty today." Dean's voice drifted through their home. Claire's giggles followed.
“Inspecting.” Dean replied.
"Yeah." He said. "Don't you think I've tried it? I can't pick these locks. The only thing I could use is the quill of a feather, but ours are too thick to fit so it's not going to work. Believe me. I did it so many times when I had first been captured. My wings ached for days."
He paused dramatically and stared back at Castiel.
“Yep! We played games and watched spooky movies!”
He was far less confident in his own abilities. Yes, he’d taken classes and read books in preparation, but that was all very different from the real thing. He’d never been the best with children in the past, he’d always felt so awkward without Dean there to entertain.
“I’m being productive.” Dean corrected. “Besides, it’s good to get out of the Bunker every once in a while.”
Sam grimaced. “About that, there’s only four rooms. Charlie, Jack, and I already claimed our rooms upstairs, but there’s one down here.”
“Did you have homework, or can you go out now?” Dean asked.
“No,” Dean answered, shaking his head, “Last weekend, I think. He was telling me that his mom wants him to get into a relationship, but he’s not interested or ready. So we wouldn’t go out, anyways. We slept together, which is not professional of me at all. If he finds out I have feelings for him, he may question my intentions in staying as Claire’s nanny. He may think I’m more focused on winning him over than caring for her.”
"Perhaps we could go out to eat?" Castiel suggested, already growing stressed and irritated. He was wearing scent-blockers, thankfully.
“No, Gabe. I won’t be leaving without him.” Castiel said, voice firm. Jack startled a little and Castiel forced himself to calm down.
Dean snorted. "I can tell. Doesn't bother me."
“Do the royals of Winchester often have consorts?”
Her voice was strained, but Castiel still appreciated the effort she put in.
When Castiel entered his home, several different scents bombarded him. The most obvious was Claire's unpresented happy scent. It was fuller and stronger than Castiel remembered it being in a while, which made his stomach twist with bittersweet feelings. Underneath that was the scent of delicious food, and lighter still was happy omega. It stopped Castiel in his tracks. It had been a while since he'd smelled happy omega. Even with Amelia, it had been a while since she was truly happy and not simply content.
“Be back in one sec.”
Dean wondered, briefly, if his room had been chosen this way to deter him from attempting to escape.
"Been asking myself that everyday, buddy." Dean sighed. Castiel wanted to ask what he meant, but he didn't.
"Okay, Claire." Dean acquiesced. "Let's get you home."
Jo nodded. “It’s true. I’m a rebel.”
“The parents of the two boys will be here soon.” Lisa told him. “They’re still going to be punished, of course, but this is something we should talk out anyways.”
"But what could they hope to accomplish by that?" Castiel couldn't help but ask. "A temporary bond does not do much to amplify one's strength, even with a familiar as powerful as you."
Castiel left for work a bit earlier on Friday. He wanted to be done as soon as possible so he could get home and spend some time with Claire before he was forced to go to the charity ball.
“Yeah, family can be like that.” He said. “My brother can be a pain in my ass, but I wouldn’t trade it for the world.”
"Fuck." Dean panted. "We should - ah - move this somewhere else."
“You’re nesting!” Charlie exclaimed, startling Dean from his thoughts.
"No running!" Castiel called, uselessly. He looked back at Dean. The other man gave him a hesitant grin.
He had to do something.
"What could you do to help?" Castiel said, then he bit his lip. "I am sorry, again. I do not mean to take my aggression out on you."
Feigning nonchalance, Dean glanced at the passenger side of Baby.
“I knew that humans had legs and feet, but I didn’t know they had leg-fingers.”
Michael sent his own burst of power in the form of fire hurtling towards Castiel. Castiel shielded back the flames with one hand while shooting another bolt of lightning with the other. It wasn't powerful enough to kill Michael, but it was enough to distract him.
"Still getting ready." Claire replied. "What time are the feedings?"
Castiel hadn't had a nickname before. Well, Gabriel called him a variety of names but it stemmed mostly from teasing.
alright my friends, I did manage to get a chapter up this week! woohoo yay for me
“Mr. Walker!” Lisa snapped, her scent flaring with indignation. “That type of language is not allowed on school premises!”
"I think I know what's making Dean like this." Ellen replied haltingly.
Sam’s nose wrinkled. “Another one? Dean, that’s like the third one this month. You’re being obsessive.”
As Jack’s eyes began to flutter shut, Castiel set up the baby monitor. It crackled to life and worked when Castiel quietly tested it. He slipped out of the room and left the door slightly ajar. Then he went back into the living room.
“You’re my top student.” she replied bluntly. “I think you would be an excellent tutor. This would also be a way for you to get community service hours.”
offer to them?!"
“Mr. Walker!” Lisa said again. “If you cannot control your behavior, you will be required to leave.”
"How did you escape the bond?" Castiel asked, purposefully softening his tone. He didn't want to upset Dean or scare him away.
He couldn't help but stare at the alpha in front of him for a moment. It was a really strange twist that Dean had not been expecting. Cas seemed to be just as shocked as Dean.
Whatever. Cleaning helped Dean calm, and so Dean cleaned.
"No, Papa." Claire said. "I want to watch a movie with
“Yeah?”
“Code red!” One nurse yelled into the hallway. “Raging alpha!”
Castiel was curious.
"The alpha angel's up." Jo said. She joined the other woman behind the counter. The humans looked over at Castiel, making him tense and uncomfortable.
"Off you go now." He said, gesturing. "Hope you can fly, it's a bit of a fall."
"Are you excited to see your brother again?"
Dean hummed again, then fell silent.
“Happy anniversary, Dean.”
"I'm six." Adam answered. "Can we go now, please?"
After their first confusing interaction, confusion interactions started to become more usual. Dean would notice Castiel looking at him, or Castiel would catch him off-guard with a personal and genuine compliment, or he would bring Dean a gift of some sort, like a flower or a book, and give it to Dean with a soft, shy smile.
He continued to stare down at his phone, turning it around in his hands.
The car was still in the driveway when they got back to the house, which did ease some of Dean's concerns. At least he knew that Mr. Novak hadn't gotten into a car crash or something.
“Alright, sorry.” Dean said, pouting.
That made Castiel even more cross. "I do not know what you are speaking about."
"Cas?"
“Keeping me away from my own flesh and blood?!” John demanded, outraged.
Anxiety started to creep up from Castiel’s stomach into his throat. He walked slowly from the doorway towards her desk. “Is something wrong?”
Dean smirked at him. "Don't short change yourself, man."
“What?” Dean stopped and looked down at Adam. “Of course not. Why would you think that I’m mad at you?”
The choice was taken from Castiel as the door flew open.
But it was good to actually spend some time with Claire and to see her happy, even if his attempts at singing made her giggle.
, followed without a fuss.
Castiel swallowed, his throat dry.
"Damn, Cas." Dean said softly.
“Cas? Please, you’re scaring me.”
Castiel frowned. “I understand. If you still want children after this, we can can adopt-”
“Sure,” Dean shrugged. “If you really mean your apology, I’d be happy to get your help.”
Castiel couldn't help but grin a little.
"I do not regret anything that transpired between us, Dean." He said. "In fact, I hope that we can do it again, sometime."
“You as well.” Dean responded.
"I think that another thank you is in order." Castiel said. "I had no idea that angels interacted with humans in such a way, and I am shocked that you would still rescue us. Thank you."
"I apologize." Castiel said. "I just wanted to make sure that you were well, and I didn't understand the magical barrier."
Castiel's plants seemed to sense his sorrow. They were clingier than normal and they whispered appreciation as he passed through. Dean trotted loyally besides him the entire morning. He shifted inside the house before they both went into the front part of the house where the shop was located.
“I’m Castiel. He’s Balthazar.” Castiel said, gesturing to his friend (who was cowering near the front of the boat).
"Dean." The man gasped.
“Ow.” Dean said, body aching.
“Your name is Cas-ti-el?”
He fucking hated April, for many reasons.
“Earlier, in the bunker kitchen. You were going to say something, but we ended up here.”
Well I missed yesterday's prompt (indirect kiss) - I may or may not do that one, time will tell. This one I really enjoyed writing, so I'm glad I managed to grab some time to finish it and post it :D
Castiel choked. “In
“Sorry, dude.” The ride manager said. “No room. We’ll get you on the next one.”
“So you’re just going to stare at each other? You guys are so weird.”
Gabe looked to Sam. “I told you he’d be a selfless idiot, right?”
Castiel frowned. “How spooky?”
Their pizzas were delicious and for dessert they had ice-cream sundaes, even Sam.
"What were you so riled up about?" Dean asked.
"I'm sending over a suit for Friday. Do you still have the same measurements?"
Castiel stood and instinctively followed Dean.
(See the end of the chapter for
! Turned against me!”
Castiel paid for their (expensive) meal and waited with April at the front of the restaurant for her car to come pick her up. Then he was free to drive himself home.
Castiel bit back the sudden wave of pressure in his chest and throat. He wouldn’t cry. He
Dean hummed. “I think I’d like to be alone now.”
“Hey, Jack? What if you and I keep searching and we give Papa a little break?”
Naomi turned in her chair. "Richard, how lovely to see you."
"Your daughter." Anna snapped. "She's an absolute menace. I am a
“Is everything okay again?” Jack asked, peaking into the room.
"Age doesn't dictate maturity level, dude." Dean said.
"That's me." Gabriel said. "And you're his... what? Sugar daddy?"
Castiel swallowed, his chest twisting unbearably. Dean looked in awe around them. Angels were not meant for the dark confines of a dungeon. Dean's soul must've been withering away.
The house ended up being in this little neighborhood that Dean figured was meant for families. Each house had its own unique style. Most were kept nicely. They turned down a cul-de-sac and drove to the end house.
Sam heaved a sigh. “We should get back to the house. It might be easier to talk about this there.”
“Told you.” Sam said, grinning. “Let’s go see our pictures!”
"Sorry, we're in a rush though."
"We did a lot of coloring today, lots of drawing competitions and tic-tac-toe that she won. She had a peanut butter and banana sandwich with celery sticks for lunch. She had plenty of water, took a nap after lunch too. We spent time reading together, she's a great reader, by the way, and we played Twister. I hope that that was alright. I usually like to bring Twister because the kids have fun making me twist into contorted shapes, and it's at least a little bit of exercise."
Dean picked an arbitrary direction and had taken all of two steps when something came crashing through the woods behind them.
What kind of father was he?
"You have two back-to-back meetings that begin in an hour and a half, and then one at three."
"Yup." Charlie replied.
“Yes, Dean.” Sam said, scowling a little. “That’s what Thanksgiving is about, being thankful.”
"They are low-powered, but I would still appreciate if you aided me when I make them." Castiel said. "It will be good practice."
The walk is long and taxing on his exhausted body, and by the time he’s reached the town he’s gasping for breath and sweating so much he’s almost drowning.
“Huh.” Castiel scratched his neck. “I guess I was tired.”
He sounded so hollow that Castiel nearly swallowed his tongue in his haste to shut his mouth.
Castiel bitterly thought. He nodded at her once before turning and leaving for his next class.
“I’m here to see Dean,” Castiel said. “Are you Sam and Jo?”
Castiel obediently ate all that he could, then he returned the plate to Gabriel.
it would be the weekend, because Castiel wouldn’t be able to see Dean until Monday.
“So,” Dean paused, “What does that mean?”
"Nothing, never mind." Dean mumbled. "Was stupid anyways."
As soon as the all-clear was given for Dean to receive more visitors, Sam invited over the rest of the family for a soft party to celebrate Dean’s recovery. Ellen and Bobby snuck in homemade burgers for Dean. Everyone got a chance to talk with Dean and catch him up on the latest. The omega had been upset about missing so much when he first woke up, but he seemed happier during the party.
“Anyways,” Dean starts to turn around.
“Goodbye.” Castiel said, also standing.
“Dean,”
people and I feel
Castiel chuckled to himself.
Relief floods Dean. “Cool. You wanna meet here then? Like one-ish?”
"Not that I don't love this," Dean gasped, leaning back against the car when Castiel started to get adventurous with his hands, "But shouldn't we focus on, you know, getting outta here?"
thanks for your patience, let me know what you think :)
"I am positive." Castiel replied. Dean took the bowl and began to eat, satisfying something within Castiel that he quickly buried away. Dean at slower this time, to Castiel's relief. Dean pushed the bowl back over when he was finished, and Castiel stacked it neatly with his empty water mug.
