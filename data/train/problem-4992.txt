Now that he knew Bucky was safe he finally took a moment to really think about what he did to his team. He was definitely the one that was wrong on a lot of points. Though his team locked him away against his wishes they did do it with his best interests at heart. And yeah, Fury was right, he could definitely not make proper rational decisions. Especially in the state he was in.
“That would have never worked!” The genius bellowed. “They would have never released him to us because they were experimenting on him.”
“Yeah, and you started bleeding and threw up on his dog?” He laughed at the memory. “Thought you were going to pass out.”
His body obviously coming off of the adrenaline high. He looked up into Ironman’s face plate knowing Tony’s face is just beyond that. The genius looked back down at the solder in his arms.
“No, darling, this is yours and Ellie’s thing. Besides I have plenty to do around here and I don’t need you two distracting me.” She winked.
“Don’t worry, I’m going to do my best not to let that happen. But first we gotta move. I’ve got people looking for me too.” Steve urged.
She began screaming, the intensity and weight of his experiences were too much to bear. But he didn’t stop. He wanted her to know, to feel everything. He pressed on.
“The next part is always the hardest. Where to start after the basic background is layered on.” He sighed.
Probing the Captains mind again the telepath couldn’t help but to marvel at how righteous the man standing in front of him is.
“You know Cap; the way you took control like that was totally sexy. I might be little turned on right now.” Tony smirked wickedly at Steve as he winked at the poor the Captain.
Steve thought back to an unfortunate or at least unfortunate day for Tony as the genius couldn’t help but challenge the Captain to a drinkathon.  Needless to say it did not end up well for Tony.
Steve excused himself swiftly. He resolutely avoided his team’s shocked faces and desperately pretended not to notice Clint fork over a large wad of cash to Natasha.
The Super Soldiers expression changed so fast that it would have been extremely comical except the look that ended up on his face screamed ‘If you don’t walk away from me now I
Regardless, he knew he would have to apologize to Tony. Hopefully he would get a chance to explain that it wasn’t that he didn’t want to spend the last of his life with him, because that’s all he wants, but he couldn’t live with the guilt of it all.
He checked for a pulse. When he found none he checked for a heartbeat, pressing his ear to her unmoving chest.
His first thought was if he could somehow kill himself it might stop her. He laughed at the thought however. She would probably find a way to stop him or revive him. Besides there was no telling if she would just choose someone else if he did manage to off himself. He would absolutely not put that burden on anyone else.
“You fool!  This is the only one we have any hope of controlling!”  The fat one seethed.  “Well? What are you waiting for?  Thaw him out!”
Bucky stared at him in shock and awe. “You want to replace my arm?” He glanced down at the jagged remains of what was once his cybernetic arm, a special gift from Hydra. Fuckers. He remembered every moment of that accursed procedure. Every moment of their cruelty and depravity. Every single second of that white-hot searing pain. “And that’s…” He nodded to the little device and Tony’s hand.
“So, what? That’s just the connection they all had shitty childhoods?  Every single person in this room has shit for a past.”  Clint stated oh so elegantly.
He was doing something important.  He blinked again only to discover more people in the room.  Director Fury was talking to Hank and Charles.  When did they arrive?
“I believe he said, ‘It’s all about the food Stevie, to keep your eyes peeled because dinner comes from unexpected places, especially for the fishermen who searched the waters for fish yet saw upon the land the opportunity for bountiful venison.’” He laughed at the memory.
“See at first I thought that they were crazy or something was wrong. They were so happy and wonderful it was unreal, but I quickly came to the conclusion that they were just that way.
"No, not like this. I'll have to make a new one." Tony replied not quite believing that this just happened.
“Uh huh, sure.” Bucky drawled. Steve was fooling no one. “Or, how about the countless times you picked a fight with someone three times bigger than you?”
“Yeah, actually, I might,” he began. But before Pepper could utter a sigh of relief Tony continued, “when hell freezes over or when pigs fly, you know, which ever comes first.” He finished deadpan.
“I must say this must be the furthest anyone has gotten to figuring things out! Most splendid!” She stated delightedly.
He nodded shakily. He quickly left the factory behind in the dead of night heading straight to that church on Arbor Street.
Deep, deep down Tony loves Steve’s reassuring speeches but of course would be damned to allow anyone to know.  So he immediately pretended to fall asleep and start snoring as Steve was finishing up his speech.
“Does anybody have the need to shit themselves or is it just me?” Scott shuddered from his place on Steve’s shoulder.
“Only if you bring him back alive.” Steve whispered. “I promise I’ll behave if you bring him back alive.” He said a little more firmly.
Before Tony could look any further the alcohol had consumed him and he had passed out. Now he sat by himself regretting his entire existence.
Steve desperately enjoyed spending his afternoons just like this, painting with his baby girl. Peggy too when she gets back. She always made the loveliest watercolor flowers.
Okay so this chapter was a beast! It took forever to hash out. I even had to cut it shorter. So, fair warning, chapter thirteen will be itty bitty in comparison. I just couldn’t consciously post something so massive. Without any further ado, On with the Show!
“Because hey! We are dealing with an old ass alien who is hell bent on, no, not world domination, but universal domination! Yet! Yet she doesn’t want to stop us from stopping her!” He shouted at an unusually high octave.
It had been two days since Barnes’s shocking revelation. Two days since Tony’s universe had been turned inside out and upside down once again. Tony knew, having hacked and scoured SHIELD’s archives, that Hydra was likely behind his parent’s "accident." He knew his father was into some deep secretive shit as evidence of his affiliation with SHIELD. But this was a whole new acrimonious level of ‘what the fucking shit’ kind of shock.
“I can’t imagine it Steve. If I lost Rhodey I… I couldn’t… Or even Pepper or Happy or you, I…” He trailed off simply unable to conceive the world without these people that he cherishes most.
Steve was on his way to the meeting room. Tony told him that he’d meet him on the way. Finally they were going to pool their minds and resources together to figure out a plan to fix the situation. They needed to figure out some sort of cure for the victims or the identity of the mysterious foe along with how to defeat it. He couldn’t bear it if any more people got hurt not to mention his own team mates. They were his family. He’d hate himself forever if he could not protect one of his friends...like before…
“Very good question my Dear, in a matter… Certainly not the way you understand it, however.” She replied pointedly.
After Steve’s mother passed Bucky was the only family he had in the entire world. And when their roles were reversed and Steve became the strong one, the rock, the glue Bucky took it in strides and Steve failed him.
Unfortunately, Tony could not quite find a way to completely eradicate the pain that came with the unnatural union of the cybernetic machinery and the organic matter of human flesh, taking in future patients into consideration. As far as Barnes was concerned, he preferred to keep the pain.
"Yes, but only one. If you keep that demented bunny from destroying the others I can do it." He replied adamantly.
Steve frowned deeply at the man's apparent attitude, but somehow knew it was a façade, a defense mechanism. Yet, Steve also knew that, somewhere deep in his memories, this man was responsible for enraging him beyond comprehension a time or two.
'Fuck!' She was the perfect mix of his own and Tony's features, her visage was nothing less than enchanting.
At the very least in his attempt to motivate Barnes he had somehow inspired himself. Like he told Bucky, he couldn’t give up now, he could deal with his demons later, now was the time to get to work.
The moment she was gone and Tony could no longer feel her overwhelming presence, he jerked his head up towards the red sky morning and screamed for all the he was worth, expelling his agony for the world to hear. Soon enough he got a hold of himself. He had to keep going, somehow.
He took one last look at his dismal work and turned on his heel and left the barn. The paintings and drawings were all but forgotten about for the rest of the night as he spent the last of his evening in domestic bliss with his adoring family. Nothing was more important.
“Probably best if we didn’t anyway. With the entire planet counting on us and all.” Steve smirked sideways at Thor.
There was this one house that I’d ride my bike by.  It was a small and cozy looking cottage and the kids always ran around looking too happy.
“Well partially of course for your involvement in my work.  In addition to that things are going to get worse from here on out.”
‘Ah!’ Tony looked down at himself and realized he was barefoot in nothing but his pajama pants and indeed utterly unarmed.
He hadn’t even reviewed the footage of the escape yet. He knew he’d only make himself sick doing so. Jarvis sent him an alert when he was halfway to Texas and he had immediately turned around and headed back to the tower. When he had finally arrived he found Natasha distraught and the tower in shambles. He found Colson and Scott knocked out and then became utterly enraged to discover that Jane and Darcy’s blissful sleep was drug-induced. He was beside himself. He was so furious. He had Jarvis search every media outlet possible looking for any sign of the wayward captain. He hacked security cameras and cell phones like. He was so angry he hunkered down and focused solely on finding that treacherous bastard. He didn’t have the mind to review the footage leading up to his escape.
Behind them Dumm-E started to clean off the work station. Bruce entered the shop hastily and called out.
“You know, a part of me wondered if you were really doing all you could to solve the puzzle, Tony.” Natasha commented with an air of guilt. “I know how intelligent and talented you are and I thought to myself, if Tony Stark is really truly working on it, it would have been done weeks ago.” She looked up at him with sad knowing eyes. “And I know you’ve been so distracted lately because of…” She paused shaking her head. “I apologize for doubting you.”
“Ah Hah! I knew it!” He gushed in triumph as he pulled out a military standard first aid kit. He opened it and began to remove the tools needed for stitches.
Once it had been established that pies were happening, most waited patiently in the dining area.  Natasha had a brilliant idea and went out to get vanilla ice cream.  Once the pies were done some sort of odd domestic peace and tranquility fell over the compound.
Back to the point, Tony did not have to wait long after such a serious and complicated operation to go ahead and fuck with the newly installed bone anchors and mount a prototype. Indeed, the worst of the healing was mostly completed by this point as evidence of how much whining the soldier managed yesterday. It was still two hours yet till 2 o’clock, so Tony decided to go ahead and work on deciphering Calamity’s data load.
“Steve,” Tony cries out, as Steve’s next, hard thrust catches his prostate, makes him clench around the length of his cock.
There’s a spark of anger in Stone’s eyes, a vivid, vicious jealousy that Steve can practically taste in the air, and he realises that this isn’t just some relationship that became abusive; he misjudged something here.
“Is she the Black Widow? Did she come from Russia? Let me guess, she defected. Decided that the Soviet Union wasn’t for her, that she’d had tastes of American freedom and she’d jumped ship? Is that what happened?”
“I didn’t do it!” Natasha shrieks from the back of the squad car. “Tony, I swear, I didn’t kill her!”
Tony claps him on the shoulder. “Next time you’re trying to apologise, maybe stow the caveman routine; that way, it won’t detract away from your genuine purpose.”
“We ask the kids to draw their family, you know. It’s a good exercise for them to practice their motor skills, and it gets them talking,” Ms Lewis explains. She gestures to the drawers. “That’s what Maushmi and Peter drew.”
He thinks of using it now, thinks of how easy it would be to grab the knife, to stab Grant in the eye or the throat and watch his lifeblood leak out of his body until he was nothing more than a corpse on the floor.
Her eyes are gentle, kind, and Tony has the sudden thought that she must be a mother, even if it is somewhat a sexist thought, the idea of a woman only being kind once she’s had babies.
“That’s what my bearer thinks that I’m here for,” Tony corrects. “I, on the other hand, couldn’t care less.”
Steve chews on his lower lip. “Yeah, look, I have to say, if it was anyone but Bucky whom Tony was in love with, I might have killed the person,” he says, honestly, without flinching, without a hint of regret or shame.
Steve repositioned him in their little area in an attempt to ensure he was comfortable. The twins moved to get comfortable also.
She squealed in delight as she dug her spoon into the ice cream and scooped up a large goopy mound and shoveled it into her mouth. The subsequent look of heaven on her face made Steve bark out a laugh. He would swear up and down that she was likely hearing the Halleluiah chorus.
The nurse must of saw his weary glance at them because she emitted a soft laugh spoke up, "It's for her protection, courtesy of Mr. Stark."
“Besides, shouldn’t I be getting adequate rest. I mean I did just nearly get my heart ripped out.” He said gesturing to his abdomen.
Steve itched to aid her desperately. However, the black eye he sported for an hour or so yesterday gave him pause. He had to keep reminding himself that she was fully capable and that if she needed help she would let him know. Or, at least, that's what she kept telling him. He watched her move about carefully regardless, ready to spring into action the moment he detected any amount of unstable movement.
“Okay, I know I don’t have much time left but I’m going to use what I can of it to make sure you guys are safe.”
As soon as their lips touched, a fire was lit aflame within both of them. Tony all but collapsed into Steve's embrace desperately needing to get even closer to the Captain.
Tony glanced sideways at him then sighed. “Because he was my first. A.I., I mean. He’s perfect as he is.” Tony replied with something of a rueful exasperated smile. “I’ll upgrade his body from time to time so he can help me with my projects but Dumm-E is still Dumm-E and Butterfingers is Butterfingers.” He said with a genuine laugh, gesturing to the other robot who was sweeping near a whirring machine. “And Jarvis is Jarvis.”
“That’s the thing though, I wish he was the one pulling the trigger on me. I’m the one that deserves to die.” Tony cried out in desolation. “I’m the one that deserves this punishment. Not Steve.”
“So, what’s gonna happen after the data renders?” The soldier broke the silence suddenly. “You gonna make some sort of device that’s gonna, what? Wake people up?”
Steve’s eyes widened and stared at Tony alarmingly watching as he was taking in the fine details of his work.
She sighed in resignation. "It matters not. The outcome remains the same." She declared offhandedly looking back to the sun that has properly risen by this point.
Tony gritted his teeth in frustration when he heard the deep baying wail of the creature on the other side of the hole. It was far more deadly sounding than what the eggs produced. No doubt this was the "mother" that fucking rabbit was talking about.
“What the fucking hell was that!? You were going to leave me behind, you stupid prick!” He shouted as he grabbed Tony by the neck pinning him to the wall.
“Why didn’t you tell me sooner? After we found out Calamity would take me for sure, why did I have to hear it Johnny?”
“OK, I know that the only thing anybody really wants to do right now is to get a little bit of shut eye after everything that has happened.  But we gotta keep on truckin’.” He paused for a deep breath, steeling himself for a lengthy explanation.
“Please?! You don’t get to come here acting like the innocent victim when Steve’s the one that took the hit.” He shouted.
A/N: I was actually working on this for nearly a month and a half, but it grew way out of control and again I had to break it in half. Sorry for the long wait, life is a hoe. The next chapter finally hits one of my major key points, only a few more to go after that.
“I know that this is going to be difficult for you. The procedure is going to dredge up a lot of nasty memories. But we will have Wanda help you like she did before, okay?” Tony suggested trying to sound reassuring.
Steve scooted Kevin next to Tommy and crawled away to get up.  He almost didn’t make it to a stand.  His legs were so wobbly and his head woozy.
Tony broke out in a cold sweat at that bunny's insinuation. The genius's greatest fears had been realized when he heard a strange wailing coming from the blackhole.
“It was the strangest feeling. I sensed a… force of sorts that penetrated the minds of the victims. At first it felt somewhat similar to how I pick up on thoughts. However that is where the similarities end. Whoever it was penetrated the victims mind with a force that I never felt before. It was in no way human or mutant. The energy exuded was definitely not terrestrial. Thus, we are likely dealing with an extraterrestrial entity.” Xavier finished his explanation with elegance.
Steve smiled knowingly at Tony who now had his back turned to the captain.  With a warm feeling building his chest he absently started to sketch a scene almost long forgotten.
Oh my. So I was reading some back stories to some Marvel characters and was somewhat surprised to discover that everyone in the Marvel universe pretty much has shit backgrounds which works perfectly for my story. There is so much opportunity in it. Which is why I want to ask my readers to suggest a hero or villain they would like to see encounter the mysterious alien. Go on suggest someone. If it fits well it’ll go in.
He was going to have to figure out how to keep his team alive.  At least if they stop Calamity’s whims the others would wake up.  However, if the deadly soldier got to them first, that’s it, dead.  This was beyond nightmarish.
“Steve, think about Natasha, Clint, Bruce, Coulson, Maria, Fury and me. We can’t lose you! We had to do what we could, we had to try! Don’t you get that? I know it seems stupid and ridiculous now knowing that there’s no stopping her from taking you, but back then we thought we still had a chance you know?!” Tony tried to explain, the desperation evident in his voice.
When he reached the bottom of the stairs he found yet another robot shaped hole in the four.  After following it he found himself in an isolated room that was obviously meant to be secretly secured.  He quickly found the bot as it was trying to remove some type of power core, no doubt the product of whatever they were secretly researching in this facility.  Before he could approach the intelligent machinery, Natasha’s voice rang out of his earpiece informing him that they have the outside secured and that the bots were taken care of.  He smiled to himself, good just this last one.  He called out to it.
“And the fallen, they remain uninjured and perfectly healthy?”  He asked obviously connecting only dots he would know in his head.
“Thor, you said that it followed the survivors across the galaxy’s the last time it had appeared?” Steve inquired.
“Possibly, it’s hard to tell, a lot of the basements made during the time this part of this city was being constructed were built like bomb shelters.
They began to move forward and Steve punched out the first one in the way. It hurt like hell but he had to stay strong for the kids. They kept moving forward and Captain America punched out one after another after another. His hands and arms felt like they were on fire. He was in excruciating pain but they had to keep moving.
"The others sure as hell didn't." The man replied, then looked over Steve's shoulder. "I like that one better." He nodded.
Everyone started to mumble their apologies and one by one started to get back to work with Steve’s words strong in their minds and heavy in their hearts. This time they all were working more fluidly together like a well-oiled machine instead of fragmented like before.
Apparently Jane was rather annoyed with Darcy because she had created a very provocative and popular fansite online centered around Thor. Darcy, as usual, was rather unrepentant.
“I’m sorry I’m not a good enough reason for you to want to stay!” Said Tony before turning on his heel and leaving abruptly.
Everything seemed to happen at once after that. He heard Tony cry out so he whipped around just in time to see Iron Man make a collision course with Thor. The containment zone broke and the fast man appeared next to him suddenly. Next thing he knew he was on his ass as he watched the fast man pick up the unconscious woman and disappear. Steve thought he might have heard him call her sister.
“What do I need protection from?  What’s going on Tony?” Steve demanded.  His patience was wearing awfully thin.
“I won’t tell you what the keystone is, that will be a surprise.” She stated as she made her way back to Steve.
“Are you insane? After everything it’s ‘No hard feelings?’ I killed your parents!” He shouted furious.
He must be more haggard then he’s leading on.  He then proceeded to pull out his phone and alert Jarvis.
They found out early on that attacking the fuzz balls with any form of electricity made them multiply tenfold. Storm got very creative and changed the atmosphere around them so that the ions remain separated and could not hold a charge. That slowed the puff balls down considerably.
As Dr. Davidson went about making her own preparations, Tony took the opportunity to look at the scans. He took in all of the important details with a critical eye. He frowned when he assessed how much the soldier had healed in that time. Normally, a fast healing rate would be a good thing, a fantastic thing even. In this case, however, it made their work a tad bit harder. They were literally going to have to open up old wounds to get in there to install the new hardware.
Tony watched as Steve quickly took out Scott and Colson who, by the way, were both totally wrong about the Back to the Future trilogy. He watched as Steve proceeded to gather his shield and pack as he made it back to the room to confront Natasha. Here is where Tony paid extra close attention. He listened intently to the conversation and absolutely could not understand where Steve was getting his impression.
Now, however, the decision had been made for him. Each and every member of their fragmented team, including the autonomous robots Tony had been working on, were ordered to be deployed. That means he needed to attach the device before he left for the mission.
He sighed, "I'm fine, Babydoll. I just got a lot of overwhelming thoughts going on in my head right now." He said handing the butterfly net back to her.
His absence has caused such dissent among the masses that it was a matter of time before all hell broke loose anyway. Which now comes all the way around to his controversial issue at hand. Tony’s decision to involve Barnes in on this mess despite his dismal condition. Going on the times he’d done battle with this guy personally and the fact he had gotten a close up personal look at his skills at the Raft, Tony came up with the conclusion that the soldier has the capacity to be an invaluable asset to their team. So much so, that Barnes could handle the slack Steve left behind. At least for a little while.
“Hello my Dears. My apologies for arriving a bit late but I had to take care of a cretin that had a knack for breaking the fourth wall.”
Then all of the sudden The Captain noticed a shift in the room. The trio fussing over the patients went from discussing very complicated things to arguing.
How was it even possible, and what even did Tony mean when he said that Steve had created this world? What on earth was going on? How could he fix it?
“Look, I know that the Professor talked to you earlier, and I just wanted to know how you were doing.”  Tony replied as he stood stiffly.  He knew this was likely not going to go the way he wants.
You are so deeply flawed yet it makes you so beautiful. Everything from your scars and your idiosyncrasies to the way you smile and light up when a project goes right or when you speak so passionately about the things you create. So many people are so quick to believe the worst about you and I loath to admit that I used to but I have never been so happy to have been so wrong. You are so amazing and I admire you so profoundly. I look up to you, Tony. You are so strong willed and your perseverance is so stunning, God, I love you.
"Yes, they are all here." She gestured to her chest. "Each one. Waiting for the day we will all come together and reconnect every one. My body is a vessel for each and every soul I have ever taken."
“You were thinking about something deep and heartbreaking from your past.” Tony uttered softly. Steve blinked again shocked this time.
Tony let it all sink in. He imagined for a moment, just a moment, what it would be like to go do something like that. He knew how easy it can be. He runs around in a robotic suit for living.
Tony turned around quickly to manually control the elevator. He pushed the appropriate floor button and began to rapidly press the close elevator door button, cursing the ridiculously slow response of the machine. Just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief as the doors began to shut a hand reached out from the other side to stop the doors.
“I’ve had an alien in my head recently, that might be it.” Steve retorted, resisting the urge to look in Calamity’s direction. “Why do you need to read my mind? You know who I am.” The Captain ventured.
Fury started to bark out orders. He was about to issue a lock down order in hopes of entrapping whatever it was that was causing this nightmare, however Xavier intervened.
It vexed him greatly. He could remember some of the events that happened, the odd situations the man in the armor found himself in, but Steve can never remember the man himself.
“You know, there was a time Steve could only dream of working with tools like this. Now, they are so accessible it’s kind of ridiculous.” The soldier mused lowly, his voice gravelly. “There was a time I believed that I would outlive Steve, with all his illnesses it was a given. But then the little shit had to go and get all enhanced and then I was absolutely sure that Steve was going to outlive all of us out of sheer stubbornness alone.” He uttered a bitter humorless laugh. “And yet…” He trailed off with a hitch in his throat.
But really now, what was he supposed to do?  Let the Winter Soldier rip out Tony’s arc reactor?  Let the others die?  If he hadn’t activated the aid bots when he did his team would have died.  If he had not stopped and engaged the Winter Soldier, Tony would have died!  How could he not have?
“Well, if you’re sure you can keep your head screwed on tight enough, I think we have a little painkilling device to calibrate.” Tony quipped. He grabbed a small handful of grapes as he stood up and shoved them into his mouth before speaking again. “All right! Let’s get this show on the road.” He declared before heading toward his workshop.
“Don’t worry, he won’t be.”  Natasha said as she ran into the room fully suited up followed by Clint and Bruce.
Her large belly and the ring on her finger was truly a sight to behold. She was his wife and she carried his child. And then there was Eleanor. By God that child was beautiful.
“But,” official number one started, looking sideways at official number two. “If you really think you could get out of 86 what happened to Captain Rogers then I think we can work something out.”
She smiled back and continued to look through the files while Natasha and Clint began to explain to her exactly what happened yesterday.
Steve savored the times he could hold Tony’s gaze like this.  He was usually so guarded he never held eye contact for long.  Steve soaked up what he could greedily.  Tony’s wide chocolate eyes were always so expressive.  The Captain could see so much in them.  He could see how deep Tony’s complexity ran.  It is truly no wonder why no one has any idea who Tony Stark really is.  Just yet another reason why he loves this truly infuriating person in his arms so much.
It showed Steve asking for Tony then subsequently weaseling out of his restraints when he heard Tony was unavailable. The genius fast forwarded to Steve leaving the room and wandering the halls. Eventually, he made it to Tony’s personal quarters. He watched as Steve hid behind a house plant (Really? How fucking cliché is that?) as Pepper exited his room looking like…huh… She kind of did look that way.
Well there goes his ribs again. They began to cough up blood and started to wheeze. That punch took out a lung as well. The soldier hesitated. Before our Captain could properly recover however, the dark assailant produced yet another knife.
“Die how?”  Steve spoke rattled, distressed at the new level of complexity this whole nightmare had taken on.
His voice cracked over every other word. He could barely utter the details out loud. He described how he came to the decision to spend the rest of his life finding the brother he could not save seventy years ago. Bucky flinched at his admission but said nothing. Tears started to spill, he knows exactly how Steve feels.
It always irritated Tony how she could be so cool, composed and elegant. He found it was hard to ruffle her feathers. Though he eternally wondered why on earth he always felt the need to try. He had a masochistic streak he guessed.
Suddenly, Steve’s eyes finally landed on Tony. A thousand and one emotions flitted across his expressive face so quickly that Tony could not even begin to understand what was going through his mind in that exact moment. Then Steve’s face broke out into a wide grin, he gave Tony a brief nod before bracing the shield over his chest and completing his iconic command in a roaring battle cry.
That revelation in of itself felt more wretched than words can describe.  Whatever was happening, his team, his friends, Tony could not trust him with the information.  Whatever it was.  Like a slap in the face it stung on so many levels.
“Hey now, Director Fury is right we should not be letting this get to us.  The more destructive we allow our minds to get, the easier it would be for the alien to in fact control our minds.  Wouldn’t you agree Professor?”  Summarized Coulson, looking to the professor for affirmation.
The genius watched him in absorption. His attention was on Steve 100%.  He began to shift uncomfortably in his seat.  His pants may have started to become a bit tight.  Swiftly Tony realized Steve staring at him.
"Wow, only ten hours? That explains a lot I guess." He muttered. Then the man looked over to the work table and spotted the drawing. Steve blushed crimson. "You drew me." He said somewhat wistfully.
How positive of an ID did the authorities provide? How was it that they were so sure it was the Winter Soldier when it took till now to even recognize that he even existed?
“Because if I didn’t you, your Mother, your baby sibling and millions of innocent people would not be here right now. I’d rather have you here with me and have my brain be like Swiss cheese then the scary alternative where you don’t exist. Do you understand me?”
And with that the little fairy and her human avatar coalesced into a black orb of iridescent light then shot up into the sky and exploded into trillions of stars that cascaded over the evening sky and rained down upon them.
“Sir, Mr. Barton is requesting entry. Shall I inform him you are indisposed?” Jarvis’s voice rang out making Tony flinch impresses hands tighter to his skull.
Iron Man swung around quickly and knocked the guy out with a percussion grenade. One down four to go.
Tony explained how like with his old arm, shattered as it was, the damaged neuro-cybernetic circuits caused excruciating pain. If such damage occurred again he could easily remove the damaged arm alleviating the pain.
Tony shut the journal instantly. He had his suspicions but to read it in such detail... He tried to shake it off and instead focus on the white unassuming envelope.
"Perhaps." She replied simply as she delicately ran a single finger down the side of Steve's bruised face.
Steve felt it was the best time to bring in team two to take over the mass evacuation while he pulled Iron Man, Antman and Thor to surround Dr. Doom. He took cover in an alleyway to give orders.
“Since I saw said annoying guy come this way I thought I might as well find something proper to eat before I get my head chewed off again.” Tony replied with a twinkle in his eye. Luckily Tony responded without a hint of bad attitude or Steve might have taken offense to that.
Tony flinched and cringed when he heard the commotion over the com line. He internally prayed to whatever deity would listen to spare the poor soul that bird was after. His prayers were unanswered, however, when he heard Nat howl in misery and describe in gruesome detail that one small bite from the creature had flesh melting off the bone. Death was swift for both human and bird, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you looked at it.
“I know this is big and personal for you. I’ve known Tony for a while now and considering everything, I have a lot of respect for the guy as you can imagine.” She said.
Glaring Steve started to shout. “Do you honestly think this is a game, some sort of joke? People are in danger and you’re laughing!” Tony started to laugh even harder at Steve’s reaction.
“Heh, as tempting is that would be Tony I have to make sure everyone in my team is OK. I am in command now.” Steve stated as he looked down at the unconscious Director.
for me? Are you fucking kidding me?” Tony laughs, short and sharp. “That night, you came to bed; you fucked me, and then, when I woke up, the bed was empty. It was completely fucking empty. The apartment was empty. There was no note. I was scared something had happened to you, so I went looking. I went to your place. I went to the university. And then, I realized that something hadn’t happened to you at all. You’d
The muscle-bound Nazis light up at this suggestion, while the man in charge gives them a withering look.
Tony hadn’t known that omegas could feel such pleasure at the hands of an alpha, had believed that it was something uncomfortable and necessary for an omega but the satisfaction of the encounter all belonged to the alpha and not the omega – the act of fucking was for the purpose of having babies for the omega, and nothing else.
As Howard’s talking, as he straightens, Tony sees him, sees Obadiah in the mirror behind his father.
“Now the lion below, being attracted to the glow of the gem, picked it up and carried it away. As the lion walked away with the gem, Jambavan, the King of the Bears saw him. Being seduced by the glow of the gem, he attacked the lion and killed it and took the gem to his cave and gifted it to his infant son. Prasena did not return to Dwārakā, and so, people were wondering what had happened to him. Satrajit suspected that Krishna might have killed Prasena in order to attain the gem. Krishna, in order to prove his innocence, gathered a search party, and went into the forest.”
Peter nods, climbing onto his knees so that he can perch on the side of his bed. “Yeah, Daddy, all the parents are coming to see our classroom and all our work, and they’re gonna meet with Mrs Eldridge, and then,
Tony takes a deep, steadying breath and closes a hand around his cock, stroking upwards from base to tip. It’s a little dry, but Tony likes the friction.
Tony holds onto Abraham, watching with dull eyes as everyone gathers around him, shocked whispers filling the air.
Steve shakes his head, his jaw clenched visibly. “I thought you were being hurt, and then… you came out, and you looked happy, and I… I almost broke the car door. That’s how fucking pissed I was. I thought he was hurting you, I thought he was
It is the least he deserves. Kinslaying is a great sin amongst his people – Steve is right to punish him, even after what Grant did to him.
Steve’s hands clamp around his thighs, and with one final, brutal thrust that drags relentlessly against his prostate, Tony comes, with lights dancing behind his eyes, comes all over his belly, and he lets his head fall back, only for Steve to catch him, keep him upright.
He looks at Tony like he doesn’t know who he is, like he’s not the same person that he married, like he’s not the same person that he had kids with, like he can’t be trusted.
The way that Grant looks at him, a needle-sharp, careful look, makes Tony shift on his feet in discomfort, but he pushes it away – this is his alpha’s brother; it would not do well to make him angry so early on in his bonding.
Once the children are clothed and their hair is brushed, and Maushmi had asked for a French braid today and she’d wanted to wear the extra-special pink tulle dress he’d bought for a Princess birthday party she has to go for in two weekends, so that took a lot longer than he’d been expecting, especially dealing with the threat of tears from his daughter when she doesn’t get her way, he looks at his watch and it reads 8:10AM.
, Tony thinks, immediately, and then hates himself for it, because look at what he’s been reduced to, dissecting the voices that his husband uses and deciding that it’s proof of his infidelity.
“Do you have any idea the things that I did?” Tony asks, feeling the stinging, biting shame at the memories. “The things I did to get you to… to
His father used to do that – he remembers the story, Jarvis told him the story, a diamond bracelet for all of his lovers to commemorate the occasion.
He asks FRIDAY, and FRIDAY tells him that the closest male relative is meant to light the pyre. If Tony had a son, the son would have burned the body. Tony doesn’t have a son, but he does have Peter, and Peter was the closest thing that Tony had to a child of his own body.
“Tony,” Steve takes his hands in his, and Tony shudders a little on the inside, “Tony, just tell me the truth. Tell me what really happened here. I,” he closes his eyes, “I will sound awful for saying this, but I know my brother, I know what he is like. If you tell me what happened here, I will protect you. I swear it, I swear it on my honour, which may not mean much to you right now because I have failed to protect you so far, but I
Warnings for this chapter: the aftermath of the previous chapter, emotional infidelity, lying to your partner.
“Yeah, and I’m still not good with it!” Tony snaps, his eyes over-bright. “I am trying very hard to make sure that our kids don’t end up like me, Steve, but that doesn’t mean that I’m magically fixed, that all of my fucking issues have faded into dust just like that. I don’t
A panel in the machine slides back, revealing a carousel of vials containing the serum, gleaming blue. Abraham and the nurse inject all of the vials into the injectors as part of the machine, and he then nods at one of Tony’s employees, who deploys the injection pads, which bristle with hundreds of tiny needlepoints. They close over Steve, pressing him to the table.
Tony makes a soft noise at the back of his throat as he’s breached and slowly filled up, the blunt pressure of Steve’s cock pushing deep inside him. The dirty talk stops there, when Steve rams into him hard, fucking him hard and thoroughly, pounding into him like it’s a mission for him, and Tony can’t even begin to form syllables on his tongue, left to just lie there and take it and let out the occasional moan and sigh at how good it feels.
The pain is unbearable, flaring hot between his legs and stretching up into his spine and his throat, and there are tears in his eyes, leaking out steadily from the corners. He grits his teeth, refusing to allow Grant the satisfaction of hearing him shout.
Tony looks up, his face devoid of any expression (he’s always been good at those little boxes). “Can you please not tell anyone that James was here, JARVIS?”
Tony hums, curling up against Steve’s side, tracing absent patterns on Steve’s chest, by his nipple. “I knew there was something about you that I liked,” he teases.
feel? To see you like that, to see you so happy with this guy, to be so happy when he fucking touched you. God, I just wanted to-”
“James, I can’t,” he says, agonised. “Look, Steve has already been giving me shit over my disappearing acts, and you left your stupid bracelet in my bathroom that day, you jackass. You have any idea how much I had to save face.”
Steve goes for his pants next, a fierce, determined look in his eyes, like he knows that this is going to end with him balls-deep in Tony and he would abide by anything else happening tonight or anything ruining that. Steve dips his head, mouths at Tony’s throat, where his pulse throbs fast and wild, and his hand finds Tony’s cock. Tony bats his hand away.
Tony looks down, and he sees the fuel staining the pavement underneath the plane, the engines roaring in his ears.
you; that night was the most amazing night of my life. Every night, when I close my eyes, I think of that time I spent with you, Tony. So, you don’t get sit there and pretend like I
Maushmi pauses. “Oh, I don’t know, a long while. You were both learning to walk at the same time,” she muses.
They’re seated promptly at the restaurant when they arrive, the hostess blinking fast and hard when she realises that it’s Tony Stark who’s come to her restaurant, with his oh-so handsome husband.
He starts to eat again, to smile, to talk, to read. He spends all of his time, if he can, with Natasha, and it means that Grant stays away.
Tony doesn’t hesitate to rush inside. The air shifts, and instead of being greeted with the traditional school landscape that he remembers from the real-life version of the preschool, he finds himself going down the stairs of the slightly different boiler room.
Tony shakes his head. “He… back in college, we met because I was helping him with something, something dangerous. I threw him out in the first instance, because the kids were still at home, but once I dropped them off at school, I went to his apartment-”
The colour rises in her face. “Look, I just… I don’t know what I was thinking,” she says, honestly. “I… I’d heard a lot about you, you know? Steve, he talks about you all the time, but he refused to introduce us, let me meet you. I was… hurt, I suppose.”
“Spare me the fucking diatribe about what a great person the woman whom you’re cheating on me with is,” Tony retorts. “I’m not fucking interested.” His lip curls up in disgust. “I just pray that you used a fucking condom when you had sex with her, because we haven’t used them since we got married, and God knows who else she’s been sleeping with, and if you picked up some STD from her-”
He falsifies his next smile, it turning taut around the edges. “I’m sorry. I didn’t introduce myself to your date,” he says, softly, turning to the man beside Nat, who looks increasingly angry by the way that Nat is fawning over Tony’s husband.
Steve shrugs him off, and there’s a strain to his voice. “But as it stands, it looks like I’m stuck like this,” he says, bitterly.
Steve’s thumb rubs over Tony’s cheekbone, tracing over the line, the curve. “Okay,” he says, gravely, “whatever you need me to do.”
And then, he looks up, looks over Steve’s head, the crown of gold glinting in the sharp shard of sunlight shining down on both of them, and Pepper’s there, alive as she ever was, her red hair like fire, and she’s smiling, bright, wide, toothy.
you, I might add – it’s not as if there was some great love story there either – and he brought you to this unfamiliar place, and then, refused to touch you, all because he thought you were a child. Months passed where he gave no attention at all, and then, he left, left
Tony blinks hard, his eyes damp. “You should have told me this back then,” he says, quietly. “You should have told me this before we had sex, James, actually before you left, so I would’ve known, so I wouldn’t have driven myself crazy and insecure over why you left and what I did wrong to make you leave and overanalysing every single interaction between you and me, whether I’d forced you into something, whether it’d just been an one-night stand-”
“Yeah, well, I didn’t really care back them.” Tony clears his throat. “Finally, because of my badgering him, James decided to invite me into his confidence, and he told me about the plans to poison Massachusetts’ water supply, and so I decided to help him out. I have a unique set of skills that helped him, and me helping him out with his foiling of a terrorist plan turned into me being crazy-mad in love with him. We… sorted it out; the guys were stopped in James’ special way, and then, one night, after a lot of wine, and yes, yes, I know, underage drinking, we had sex.”
He adopts the tone he takes with the kids when he’s trying to get them to come to a conclusion all on their own, and it seems to work, because Steve nods.
Steve lifts his head to fix him with a piercing look, like there a spear had crossed the air and impaled him right into the wall so that he couldn’t leave.
Grant comes towards him, and Tony swipes out, clumsily, with the pen knife. Surprisingly, it makes contact with Grant’s shoulder, slicing a clean line from the edge of his arm to the raised bone of his clavicle.
It moves ominously under Steve’s weight. The last two torches still burning on the floor go out. Now, the only light in the chamber is provided by the torches held by Steve and Tony and the dwindling oil flames. Snakes move in and surround the base of the pillar that Steve is climbing.
Tony colours in response, but he doesn’t hide his face like he might have before; he stares his alpha down, bravely.
“Tony, fuck,” Steve shoves off his jacket, wrapping it around the wound, but the blood just ends up soaking the material too fast.
love interest in this story. He’s not just Steve’s well-meaning lover, boyfriend, partner, whatever they want to refer to themselves and what exists between them. He is all of those things, and he would die for Steve, just as he knows Steve would die for him, but he’s also Howard Stark’s son.
James frowns. “I’ll go and talk to your husband. I’ll explain everything. I’ll tell him that we’re just friends, that there’s nothing going on between us, that it was just one night a very long time ago. I’ll explain to him who I am, and what you were helping me with. That should make it all okay, right?”
The sudden urge to forget his plan, to lunge across this space and strangle the bastard until he dies in Steve’s arms, rears its ugly head, but somehow, he manages to stifle it.
Before, the concept of Steve, of all people, having an affair hadn’t actually occurred to him. Tony has been with a lot of people, has even had a relationship with a few of them, and would have expected something like ninety-five percent of them to have cheated on him at some point or another. But he’d always been sure of two people, sure that he could expect fidelity from two people: Tiberius Stone and Steve Rogers.
“I love you,” Steve says, with a passion that borders on madness. “And maybe, maybe that doesn’t mean anything to you anymore. Maybe I’ve hurt you too much. You’re right. I should’ve talked to you all those years ago. I should’ve told you what your father threatened me with. We should have made the decision together, and I stole that from you. You’re right. I just… I do love you though. I haven’t stopped loving you all these years, Tony. I only thought about you. I thought about, I thought about your eyes and your hair and your smile and your hands and the way you said my name, and the food that you made when I was sick, and when you slipped into speaking in Tamil or Kannada. I missed everything about you, Tony. I missed you, and yeah, I’m not going to deny that when the museum told me to look for you so that I could find your father, I was thrilled at the idea of seeing
“He can’t be in a relationship with the two of you until he feels the same way about you the way he does about Tony. Otherwise, that’s what’s called a V-shaped polyamorous relationship. And with you having feelings for him, it will create issues, feelings of jealousy and low self-esteem, and create primary and secondary relationships that will confuse things, make it more difficult. Besides, Steve-”
“I can feel you everywhere,” Toni moans, the tendon in her throat taut against her dark skin as she tips her head back.
James grunts, and suddenly, he’s surging up, fingers tangling in Steve’s hair, and his body is a work of art, moving gracefully like a dancer, and before Tony even knows what’s happening, their bodies are twisted up, together, and James is sitting astride Steve, mouth crushed against his, and Tony has a sudden, wicked idea.
He trails off, still feeling too uncomfortable to easily bitch about his husband to a man that he’d slept with before, that has made it no secret that he’s still in love with him and would run away with Tony at a moment’s notice if he asked, and who’s even prepared to raise Tony’s children as if they were his own, knowing that’s something he’d never be able to (in another universe, he could leave Steve, he’d be brave enough to do so, because he’s much braver, has more dignity, is not willing to let Steve shame him any longer, but in no universe would Tony abandon his children, leave them thinking that he didn’t love them with everything inside him).
“I didn’t… you don’t work for SHIELD,” Tony says, his expression mutating into something wounded and sharp. “You can’t possibly work for SHIELD. That’s not… you work for an insurance company. You’re a claims agent. You don’t
,” Tony’s throat flexes, “well, you don’t want to know. Let’s just say that most prescription painkillers don’t work at all, except for fentanyl and only in small doses – that’s for end-of-life cancer patients – and I’ve just learned to live with it.”
“You’ve seen it all before,” Tony drawls, goosebumps rushing across his skin. “Both of you. Don’t look so surprised.”
Tony opens his mouth to argue, remembers the sly little smile of Natasha Romanoff, and falls silent.
Tony purses his lips thin, flinging himself out of Thor’s grip, before he sends a heavy look his way. “Tell me the truth, Thor. Is there a way to put Steve back to what he was this morning?” he demands.
“We were having a great dinner, and suddenly, there’s this woman, this really beautiful woman that has Steve stumbling out of his chair to greet,” Tony says, the bile rising in his throat, sour and bitter. “She hugs him, she touches him like she’s incredibly familiar with him, starts smoothing his collar and everything, looking up at him with those doe eyes. They sound close, judging by the way that they talk, but he never even
He hits the door with the side of his body, again and again, all of that quarterback strength pushing at the door. There’s a sound of terrible, hoarse laughter, sobbing, before a window breaks.
He looks back over his shoulder, and Maushmi is standing there, holding the doorknob to her bedroom and stretching out into the corridor, peering at him in confusion.
“No, if Steve sees you… if he… even if you were just going to drop me off,” he trails off and shakes his head again. “No, that would end badly. No, I’m fine. I can do this. It’ll be fine.” He musters a brave smile for James’ sake. “I’ll let you know how it goes.”
“Touch yourself,” Steve orders and comes closer to the bed, standing at the edge, as he starts to shuck all of his clothes as well.
dealing with it, and how I was throwing all of my guilt onto Sam as a convenient target. We also talked about how Sam felt guilty too, felt guilty that he had taken me away from Pietro, that he’d had some role in keeping the two of us apart, which might have led to his death, which is why he was so keen to let me get angry at him, which is why he didn’t fight me when I got so angry at him. We… slowly but surely, we managed to heal.”
Steve nods, like there’s something missing in his body, like half of his spirit has left when James walked through the door, and his hand relaxes around Tony’s, falling back to his lap.
that much. Because from what I can see, from what I’m seeing from the two of you even, is that you don’t respect each other.”
“No,” Tony snarls, feeling that knife-edge of protectiveness grip him fully (he’s felt that for few and far in between people: his children, his husband, Rhodey, Pepper, Wanda, Sam, his mother when she was alive, Jarvis was the first). “No, I’m not…”
Tony cocks his hip out a little, almost self-consciously, the silk of the short, crimson-red nightgown stretching over his hip.
Tony sighs. “You know why I don’t like it when you jump on the bed,” he tells her, disappointment lining his voice. “It’s dangerous, baby. You could get hurt.”
“I’m gonna put this on the fridge,” Tony declares and swipes the pieces of paper from James’ hand, sauntering over to the fridge and finding spare magnets to keep the pages up. “There we go,” he says, approvingly, as he steps away.
They make-out slow and steady for a few moments, and Tony can feel the beginnings of heat curling low in his belly, a solid clench that feels comforting and uneasy like it always us.
James rolls his eyes. “Doll, your husband is an insurance salesman. I’m pretty sure he’s not dealing with state secrets with the shit he does on a daily basis. I think he’ll be fine,” he says, derisively.
“Everything’s going to be fine, Tony. You’ll realise after this that everything’s fine, that your honour doesn’t lie between your legs. Hell, Steve doesn’t even have to find out. If you want it to remain secret, I’ll happily acquiesce. In fact, it’s much better that way, having to steal away for a few moments.”
The whispers die, of course, because in the end, everyone believes that Grant Rogers deserved his death, after all of the omegas he’d used and abused and hung out to dry ­– the sins rise to the surface, stories of terrible violence, of children that were destroyed in the womb because Grant couldn’t be seen with a bastard child and was determined to bond with an omega of great repute, of poor alphas that were silenced with threats when Grant refused to pay for an omega and instead chose one of the villagers that could not say no.
Steve draws him into a filthy kiss, even before he’s cleaned the come off his face, his hands sliding into his hair, and then, with a grimace, Tony is the one who’s pulling away.
!” he exclaims, reaching over to the bedside table to pull open the drawer. “I suppose the last thing that either of us need is a baby during these times.”
Maushmi lets out a little sob when she sees him, and she scurries over, crossing the length of the room with large paces. She throws her arms around him, clutching at him, and he winces, his bones and muscles grinding in protest.
Tony rounds on him, rubbing his hand over his face, hoping that Coulson can see how desperate he is.
Tony sits there and watches both Peter and Maushmi, interjecting himself when he thinks they need some assistance. The knives and forks clang against the plate with a dull, heavy sound, and Steve is lost in his own world, thinking about something or another, not quite engaging with the world around him.
Bhim nods. He turns to Steve. “There is a story in our religion. Satrajit, a nobleman of Dwārakā, was a devotee of Surya, the Sun God. Surya being pleased with Satrajit’s devotion appeared before him and gifted him the Syamantaka gem. It was said that whichever land possessed this jewel would never encounter any calamities such as droughts, floods, earthquakes or famines, and would always be full of prosperity and plenitude. Wherever the jewel remained, it would also produce for the keeper eight bhāras of gold daily.”
Steve sinks onto the barstool, like every muscle in his body is too heavy for him to hold up. “What happened?”
“This is Steve, Steve Rogers. He and my father used to work together at the university in America,” Tony replies.
Maushmi’s face turns a blotchy red with fury, and she picks up the nearest cushion, ready to throw it with all of her strength at her brother, until Steve intervenes quickly, lifting Maushmi off James’ knee and into his arms so that she can calm down.
Tony feels fever-hot, his brow damp with sweat, twisting his head back and forth against the pillow, the muscle in his throat taut against the skin, especially when Steve’s thumb rubs slow, soft circles against the sliver of skin behind his balls and just above his rim.
Tony waves his hand dismissively; it was all redundant now. “Steve asked me who you were, and I said that you were a friend.”
Steve grabs Tony, pulling him in front of Steve, as though to use him as a shield, but then, he flips the submachine gun on Tony’s back, towards the Nazis. He opens fire, turning Tony’s body so he can mow all five down.
“In the headlines this morning, a local teenage girl was brutally murdered during an all-night party.”
Tony blinks, not quite processing what she’s just said. “I’m sorry, did you just say that my husband picked the kids up?”
Tony rolls his eyes. “You know I didn’t mean it like that. I mean, it was rushed. We didn’t take a long time to really explore each other; we were just… we were just in a rush to have sex, after everything, after all the missed moments, and we just lost ourselves in each other. But you didn’t really see me that clearly that night, and even if you did, I don’t look like what I did back then.”
Tony sends a discerning, disdainful eye around the place. “I think I’ll stand, thank you very much.”
“I guess I just want to know, in your experience and in your expertise, is it normal for that to happen? Am I… is Peter… disadvantaged because of it? Should I be doing more to get him out of his shell?” he rushes out, chewing on his lower lip.
But when he looks down, he sees Loki laughing, a bolt of green light darting from his pale, long fingers, heading straight for Natasha, and then, Steve is there, knocking Natasha out of the way, and he takes the full-fledged heat of the green light.
“Here, let me help,” Grant drawls and comes up behind Tony, pushing up the length of his body against Tony’s.
Steve’s brow dips down in concern, with just a smidge of disappointment. “You’re drinking,” he says, cautiously.
Pepper is busy blushing, and Tony immediately understands what they’re getting at, his face scrunching up.
Tony sits back down on the bed, lifting his legs onto the mattress as well, and then, stretches out across the sheets like a cat.
Natasha rolls her eyes, switches on the television at the power point, and flicks the screen over to Netflix, so that they can start the first episode of Tiny Pretty Things.
Tony shoves him back, shoves him into the chair, and now, he’s faced with two catatonic men who may really fucked him over.
Steve stares down at him, panting like he’s breathless, and then, he’s growling low in his throat, climbing onto the floor to join Tony and bearing him down to the ground.
“I’m so glad that you’re feeling better,” Sarah says, fervently. She pulls back, searches his eyes. “Things are different now, and I know that, but if you want to talk, about
Tony curls his fingers around the railing, starting down the stairs, which leads into a dank, boiler room. At the end of the stairs, he can see the trail of slime, running behind a red-hot boiler the size of an old-timey locomotive. The hairs on his arms, the back of his neck, stand up on end, as he looks around, hearing a low, insidious giggle, like something straight out of a horror movie.
Steve pulls back, smiling even though his chest is hurting, as he cradles Sam’s cheek. “That’s why it’s yours.”
He pats James on the cheek and moves out of the door, shrugging out his shoulders. He makes his way into his car, still vibrating, and when he lands outside his house, he lingers over the steering wheel. He drags his hand over his face, and then, steps out of the car, blinks into the glaring sun above, and climbs the length of the driveway, up until the front door.
“I should still go.” James pauses. “I’m trying, Tony. I’m trying to be your friend. If I stay…” he looks away. “I’m scared. This is better for both of us.”
Jarvis offers him a smile and passes him a little yellow pill. “Take this,” he says, earnestly. “It'll help you sleep.”
Tony has the sudden urge to throw up, to find the nearest bathroom and empty the contents of his stomach, whatever meagre contents there were. The tight knot in his belly is fierce, twisting further and further, like it’s strangling him.
Steve stares at him, his face so unbearably soft. “Yeah, I think you’re right.” He looks away. “You’re unfulfilled?”
“They are in the kitchen with Master Steve, sir,” JARVIS says, slowly, as he can’t understand the panicked edge to his voice.
“Tony, you would’ve taken fucking scraps from me, and you know it,” James says, his voice practically a taunt.
The acid builds in his throat, as Steve refers to Tony’s dildo that he keeps at the back of their walk-in closet, the one that Steve equally despises, because he hadn’t been able to stand the idea of Tony deriving pleasure from a fake cock, or frankly anything that wasn’t Steve’s cock, and adores, because he likes to use it on Tony and wring as many noises from him as he possibly can.
Tony sits on the bed beside him; somehow, he wants to feel close to him, to be so near that they can touch.
He slides into his side of the bed, under the blankets, and he stretches his hand out, flattening it over the space which Tony would have occupied if he were here.
Steve chews on his lower lip. “And that’s what you want me to do?” he clarifies. “Make use of what you’re wearing?”
“Steve,” Tony stresses, his voice gentle, as he reaches out to press his hand to the curve of Steve’s forearm. “I am inviting you inside; I am inviting you to join me to watch a couple of episodes of Friends. It’s not that stressful. It’s not an either-or. If you come in now and we watch Friends, we will still go out to dinner tomorrow. This is just… a casual, no-strings-attached pre-date, because I know that you like Friends, and you’re one of few people that I know that doesn’t mind watching something even after you’ve watched it before. I will make us some popcorn, coffee, or just soda? I have candy too,” he coaxes.
Steve turned to Calamity quickly, saying something Tony could not make out. Tony was but a few hundred feet away now.
“I feel it deep down. We are but dust in the wind compared to her. This isn’t about stopping her anymore, this isn’t about our world anymore but the entire universe. Regardless of whether or not she can be trusted is irrelevant now. Considering what we know she is capable of, if she wants to play a game, then so be it, we will play along.”
Then she started to shrink and darken, turning into that iridescent black that he was now all too familiar with. The end result was a small black iridescent crystal-like creature that he could fit in the palm of his hand. Indeed, when he held his hand out to her she landed right in the middle of his palm.
He started to become more apprehensive. If he’s reading the patient reports right then there is absolutely nothing physically or even psychologically wrong with these people. Even the specialists are vexed. There is something terribly fishy going on and the good Captain is dreading the eventual confrontation of the fiend that has the power to do this to people.
"You hear that, crew? It's not over yet, get your asses back into high gear, it's rabbit hunting time." He commanded then nodded at Tony before he ran off.
He did not know why he was so fixated on it. He figured it was because he had dreamed of this mysterious person since day one after waking up with no memories beyond that fateful day he put the Valkyrie down. No matter what the reason was, the man was definitely important, somehow.
He licked his dry lips in utter concentration. He soldered piece after piece without pause. His fingertips were now covered in burns and small cuts. He ignored them. He didn't even stop when a doom bot attack glanced off his face. The gash on his cheek bled heavily but he didn't stop.
Steve berated himself thoroughly for letting himself get so distracted to the extent that he nearly forgot to pick Ellie up from the school bus stop. He berated himself further for forgetting the rest of his errands after encountering his dream mystery man.
It upset Steve profoundly that he could never recall the face of the man in his dreams. It actually scared him a little. At first, he blamed it on his Swiss cheese brain, but then it kept happening, the same way each day. By breakfast, he could not remember a single detail of the man. Looking back in his sketchbook always surprised him. He could recall drawing what little features he could remember after waking up but he absolutely could not recall what those features were, not hours later.
“Wait, hey! Who’s to say I’m even gonna be remotely lucid tomorrow? It’s taking everything I have just to keep it together now, what if I don’t even want to participate in your little experiment anymore?” The soldier pointed out sharply, almost angrily.
Tony stared gaping at the door for a moment before screaming out in despair and began to tear his lab apart. He truly believed at this point that he was incapable of saving anyone. Everything about the last few days was a huge disgusting mess, it was acrimonious enough to retch. And retch he did. Several times. In which he is now doing once more as his A.I.s looked on helplessly.
“I get that! I really do, but this is insane!  We have the best security and facial recognition software anywhere in the world yet he surpassed it, how?” She faced Tony.
Tony paused typing for a moment and sighed heavily. He was doing a real bang up job saving the world and helping his friends. God, Steve would be so disappointed in him.
“Repairs are complete and we should be in contact with Asgaurd in a few short hours.” He said in a snarky tone.
"Oh, good morning, Babydoll." He whispered reverently into her hair as he wrapped both strong arms around her.
He could sense that she was still concerned, however, and hoped that he could help alleviate her worry somewhat by eating what he could of his own meal even though he had lost his appetite some hours ago.
'Much better than the time Tony tried his hand at cooking.' He thought with amusement. 'We all survived at least.' He thought wryly.
All lingering thoughts of trying to remember that important thing he had forgotten had been completely eradicated from his mind.
Steve watched the exchange like it was happening miles from there.  He was vaguely aware that they were talking about him.  However, he was still unable to be fully present.  He felt so lost.  He watched as Jean and Hank finished their conversation.  He turned back to the beeping monitor as Dr. Grey left the room.
Steve woke up with a start. He opened his eyes and immediately regretted it. His head was pounding and all he could see were bright white walls. His whole body felt like he somehow survived an encounter with a meat grinder. He groaned.
“My team!?  You mean the people perfectly comfortable keeping me locked away without telling me why!?”  He frowned as he brushed heavy streaks of red against the canvas.
“There was a unanimous decision to put you under another house arrest, or your own safety. You just got one hell of a shock and all of us believe you are incapable of making rational decisions. You will be kept under constant surveillance and confined to your newly assigned living space until the time you are fit for duty.” Director Fury ordered officially.
“I didn’t know how, part of me wanted to keep it from you for as long as possible. To keep you from the pain that is supposed to take you away from us.” He said sadly.
Gloria, when she got out at twenty-one, got the help she needed and with the assistance of various charitable organizations and a lot of hard work she got into Stanford where she also studied criminal justice. Because of her outstanding test skills she was eventually recruited by SHIELD and because of Jimmy’s experience on the front lines and back ground in criminal justice he was also recruited by SHIELD which led them both here.” The Crazy genius finished almost mournfully.
A violet and black fireball exploded out of her mouth and decimated all that had the misfortune of existing within her path. The subsequent force of her blast pushed everybody down brutally and painfully. Massive shockwaves followed.
“OK, Cap, what’s up? Don’t tell me we have a mission from shield. I’m still recovering from the last mission we had. Remember, a wayward missile blasted a dent in an unfortunate place on my armor. I nearly lost my di-“
As an experiment Tony decided to throw a pressure bomb at her. Warning his team of his intentions he called out, "Stand clear! Throwing a pressure bomb at her in three, two, one-"
Steve sighed deeply, thinking back on it all, all the way back to when they were children. And everything after that.
Steve and Johnny, however, still could not stand each other. Upon their first meeting their similarities in appearance did not go unnoticed, by anyone. After a few ridiculously inappropriate jokes made by Clint and Tony, Johnny responded with attitude and wit that could rival them both. Throwing Steve in the middle of it had been a terrible mistake. It somehow ended up in a battle of doppelgangers. Though Johnny had proven to be fantastically fast and hot against Captain America’s cool composure, a well planted patriotic fist in his face put him in his place. Their relationship had been touch and go ever since. Sue adores Steve, however, go figure.
He realized with horror that the bot was playing games with him. He had managed to lure it half way out of the building. The Soldier needed to get him and the bot outside. With his shield in hand he wacked the bot at a knee joint not enough to do any real damage but enough to yank the bot off balance at the exact right time. He flung it as hard as he could against the wall.
There were a few more odd ended things stored along the left side and storage containers in the rafters.
Before he could twist around and fully face Tony, Iron Man’s fist drove hard into the junction of his neck and cranium sending wretchedly agonizing pulses of electricity through the brutal contact. The very same used in those accursed weapons. His vision blurred intensely and the raging inferno that was his very soul quieted. Before he toppled over into the darkness of oblivion one last tempest of a thought passed through his shattered mind and came out as a disgustingly broken whisper.
“A flying pony!?” He asked in childlike bewilderment as he began measuring out flower and sifting it into a mixing bowl.
Steve seriously wanted to vomit. Peggy led him into the old country house and tried to reassure him that everything was fine. She bid Eleanor to go to her room and amuse herself with her dolls. Despite being so overwhelmed Steve was sad to see her go.
He closed his eyes in an attempt to focus. When he opened them again he was back in the bustling hospital. Before he could even question what was happening, he heard somebody call out.
She began pulling out more blank pages and the rest of her colors. She handed him the paper with a grin.
Steve was surprised at the laugh that jumped from his throat. It was so true. Tony would be a superior jackass until the bitter end.
Blow after blow sent Steve reeling.  There was something else about this character that unsettled him.  He could not put a finger on it.
“Did you know that archery is timeless? It exists in every realm and beyond. Every life form that has developed a form of weapons technology has archery as a foundation. Oh, there is so much I could teach you, but so very little time.” She looked truly mournful.
Tony’s suit began to engage the others once more. He watched with horror as his sights locked on to Clint yet again. His friend was savvy enough to use the right evasive maneuvers in regards to his suits weaponry. Thank God for those training exercises they did all those weeks ago. But it would only be a matter of time before the Rhododendron figured out how to use his more sophisticated weapons. When that happened his team was dead, plain and simple.
He was just on the other side of the containment field, sans suit. Tony could barely make out what he was saying but it seemed to be something of a warning about what the Rhododendron is capable of. Too late now.
Soon enough the waiter had arrived with their orders of food.  “Prime rib for you.” He stated as he set a plate in front of Tony.
Tony continued, “People are counting on us. The way I see it we can wallow in self misery after we save the world. We can deal with our demons when everything is all said and done. And hey, if the world ends none of that shit will matter anyway.” Tony finished.
The Captain chuckled as he stooped to pick her up. He tossed her in the air and caught her easily as she laughed excitedly.
"Did you assume I merely took a backseat as events played out? You truly have not realized have you, the magnitude?"
“You will need to continue moving that arm. I want you to do as many everyday activities as possible with your left hand.”
“Here.”  He said as he handed the drink to Steve.  “It’ll calm the nerves.”  He stated with a smirk.
Thor considered everything they had told him for a moment.  So much was going on, 75 humans have seemingly randomly been struck down with this ailment.  The last two on the helicarrier right under their noses.  Somehow that does seem familiar to the Asgardian.  The various members of the Avengers looked expectantly at Thor as he rubbed his chin in consideration.
The children cheered until one wailed in horror. Steve turned quickly to see Becka limp in Tommy’s arms.
It was bad enough that he had to battle himself over the validity of the dream, it was a whole other beast entirely to have that man come and go as he did. Even more so knowing Steve had recognized how the man's face at contorted into pain just before he disappeared. Steve shook his head, trying not to think about it. He put the mower to the lawn and began his task anew.
The coms crackled, the bomb shelter basement making the signal go in and out. From what he could make out there was a new wave of the fur balls coming in and Ben was trying to barrel his way into the source. A new wave means that no place was safe, he needed to get these kids outside the perimeter to safety.
Now's definetly not the time to wallow, if they don't stop what's happening now then Steve's sacrifice would be in vain!
Even though he knows all the reasons why he should take a break and get some proper rest, he just simply can’t get past the guilt of it. He can’t just take it easy knowing that the entire world is on the line, even more so now that it feels like they are running out of time. Now that they know that the keystone plays an important role, when once it happens, there’s no going back.
The Thing and Torch had successfully stopped Von Dooms rampaging. As far as he could tell they were standing at a stalemate. Victor was yakking away reveling in his master plan while Johnny and Ben did their best to keep him talking to stall for time.
Not to mention all of this was happening on top of everything else he was trying to do to save the world. He was constantly working to figure out how to read and analyze that dense data load Calamity gave to him on the freaky alien crystal. He could wallow in self-misery and simultaneously work on a solution to save the universe. He was very proficient in multitasking.
Tony was certain Steve made him all hot on purpose just to pull away to smirk at him and remind him they had to take it easy. Fucking tease.
Tony’s eyes widened as he watched with rapt abandon as the algorithm came together before his eyes. “I tried working with these systems before, but I never came close to anything like that.” He admitted in a reverent whisper.
Now they stood side-by-side, Ellie on a chair of course, washing dishes together. Peggy had already left by that point, having already kissed her two flutter mice goodbye and headed out to continue working on the baby shower for Nancy. While they worked on washing dishes, Ellie hummed a nursery rhyme and Steve, ever the masochist, ruminated over his dream.
He displayed the chaos of data clusters over the hologram. Jarvis’s mind looked like a small ball against the gnarly chaotic coding. It branched and weaved and twisted around, encompassing the entire lab.
“Hey Pep, what have you come to badger me with today? Or did you just want to give me a nice view of that lacy number?” He said gesturing up her skirt.
“Storm, locate high levels of electrical fields and diffuse them. Those critters appear to be feeding off of them, take away their food they can’t replicate.”
Suddenly, his shield sailed right past Iron Man and embedded itself in the creature, slicing it right down the middle.
That is all besides the fact that Steve would never forgive him in a million years for even considering it.
"Indeed, it is as I stated before. You will only see what I allow you to see." Tony nodded mutely still vastly overwhelmed from that transcendent experience.
“Oh God Tony, what did you do this time?”  His mind flashed back to a time when he found Tony locked in a closet with severe contusions and lacerations.
His blood splattered on the cold metal of Tony’s armor. It was almost unnoticeable against the deep red hue of the Ironman armor.
It was so ingrained he didn’t even have to watch it to know exactly what would happen moment by moment…
“Yeah, from what Thor told me it’s pretty straightforward. I shouldn’t be doing anything overly strenuous.” He smiled despite himself.
His vision instantly changed from his reality into a black and colorful cosmic nebula that was littered with countless stars. Only, he realized, they weren't actually stars.
“You nearly died you idiot!”  He could no longer contain the tears that now spilled from his eyes. “Do you know how horrible it was to watch you dive into…” He inhaled sharply. “I nearly lost you!”  He said finally in a whisper.
“Wow!” He replied astonished. “Okay, Babydoll, you want to help add the flour to the milk and eggs in this bowl?”
“Okay, just watch.” Tony said as he put on a funny looking pair of glasses that had strange wires that curled around his head.
He set the video right at the point Jimmy looked at something (someone). He then pointed to a spot on the screen. Everybody gasped.
Both worked well into the night refining three basic designs. It wasn’t till nearly 3 AM when Bucky stopped them.
Everything he had forgotten had suddenly come back to him. He breathed a sigh of relief and then looked at the peculiar visage before him.
And yet…  No no, not going there.  With those thoughts constantly going back and forth inside his head Steve made his way to his assigned quarters to change into something that will help him survive Tony flinging him about in the night air on their way to whatever restaurant the crazy genius had found.
Nobody paid him any mind knowing that they would have responded the same if the crazy genius hadn’t first.
Pacing in his quarters that day felt like such a long time ago.  When really it was only yesterday.  He had thought of finding a common room of sorts but quickly dismissed it not wanting to interact with other agents.
They made their way to the super duper meeting room.  Though the walls were horribly dented with Hulk fist shaped dents every which way and the ceiling was cracked and the floor wasn’t much better, the main components of the room still worked. The chairs and desk had already been replaced, so had the external computer equipment.  The rest of the Avengers looked about the room in stunned silence with a tang of horror, knowing full well that if the Hulk was angry enough it could’ve been much more worse.
“Okay, I’ll stop fucking around… for now.” The soldier muttered as he went back to browsing about Amazon. The genius huffed to himself knowing that this was likely far from over.
“‘Remember what I told you Captain Rogers, do not linger on the ‘what ifs.’  Let go of the past and embrace your present.’”  Steve nodded as he let the Professors hand go.
Steve's entire being down to the very core of his soul vibrated with awe and desperation after realizing that this child is… is his and Tony's child. No matter how remarkable and impossible it was there she stood in all her beautiful angelic glory. As much as he would gladly play this scene out, as much as he would happily remain here forever in this perfect universe…
The genius heard the bunny squeal as Barnes chased after him. After a surge of thrilling delight coursed through him at the mental image that popped up of what would happen should the soldier actually catch that stupid bunny, Tony got to work collecting the salvageable parts.
From another angle, Spiderman’s web shot out and latched on to Tony and Steve, pulling them in. He then created more webs that connected Clint’s cable to Rhodey, and Sam and Thor to his own silky reinforcements.
She leaned over and kissed him deeply. While he was distracted she grabbed the sketchbook off the table. She flipped to the most recent page while our poor Captain was still gathering his wits after that mind-blowing kiss.
Tony and Steve have a talk about the whole keystone thing. Another mission comes up and Calamity make another appearance.
Tony shook his head. The answer was simple but no less troubling. Steve cared, therefore so did he. Although his newfound empathy was melting away rapidly as Tony realized Bucky was laughing.
He quickly sprang from the couch and effectively stumbled nearly all the way to his quarters.  He came to the conclusion that Natasha was likely the one who knocked him out based on his disorientation.
After Sam and Steve arrived, Clint got right into briefing them on their newest mission. Steve was beyond irritated that it was Von Doom and his doom bots that they were meant to stop.
“Good morning Jane, you’re most welcome here any time. But if I had my way I wouldn’t involve any more people after yesterday. However, considering all we’ve gathered so far I will not begrudge anybody of their right to fight for this world.” Steve said as he pulled out the seat next to Natasha for Jane to sit. The others nodded in agreement.
He started laughing as Thor went a bit red in the face. Thor immediately turned and clomped out of the room leaving a very annoying genius and an unfortunately lost Captain behind.
Deep in the heart of a frozen wasteland a slender figure dashed through the halls with a new visitor in tow.
“Yep, and I’ll tell you all about the gruesome details later.” He said as the elevator came to a stop. “But right now, we gotta get out of here.” He finished.
"Hey, I just realized something." He said as he held his hand closer to his face in order to inspect her small form more closely. She crossed her tiny arms almost defiantly. "Calamity isn't your real name, is it? That's just something old texts and accounts said." He began sheepishly.
A/N: Hello everyone and welcome back to this insane adventure I have cooked up for you all. I apologize profoundly for this horribly late update but I’ve been really busy as of late. But I’m here now so without any further ado, on with the show!
Tony held his breath and turned it on. He watched on a holographic display as the small electric pulses emanated from the device and penetrated Barnes’s brain and spinal cord. Bucky froze and grabbed the arm of the chair. Tony backed up to give him space. He watched as the soldier struggled to stay in control.
Despite the overwhelming urge to punch Tony in his exceedingly insufferable smug face, the good Captain willed himself to calm down. He had to remind himself that the bad jokes and crude humor were Tony’s way of coping with incredibly serious situations.
“Crazy! Crazy she is! Not to mention THIS!” He screamed as he pointed to his forehead. No bandage, no wound.
But instead of making a big deal about his word usage he remained silent.  Steve learned from past experiences that to get worked up and defend his words only served to make the situation more amusing for those involved.  Especially with Natasha and Clint.  They would tease him relentlessly.  So this time he chose to keep silent.
The scene changed and Tony’s lab came into view. A few seconds in the genius strode in distraught, grabbed the nearest liftable object and threw it across the room. It appeared to be a toolkit.
There's something very important about the heartbeat and the glow of the moon. He kept running it over. It wasn't the moon per se, but what the moon looks like. A perfect glowing orb of light, and it's important.
He got the point quick enough and bailed. Tony’s weapons missed, thank God, but now he was aiming for Rhodey and Sam! They don’t have their weapons or armor on, they are sitting ducks.
"You'd like that wouldn't you?" Tony growled despite the overwhelming ice cold fear pulsing through his veins. "How about you beg me to stop instead."
He was just about to take a step, intending to make his way to the seamstress, when something across the street caught his eye. Or should it be said, someone. A man was standing with his back turned to Steve as he looked up at the building across the way. Steve's heart gave a lurch and began to beat rapidly as he took in the man's dark messy hair and his somewhat short but lithe structure.
Steve had just tossed his shield and turned just in time to get zapped by a fluff ball. He screamed out scaring the children. He punched it and made it ‘poof’ out of existence.
She landed smoothly about twenty feet in front of them. Tony backed flush against the Captain. He reached back and intertwined his left hand with Steve’s. That simple action did not escape Calamity attention. She smirked at them. Steve tightened his grip.
A few hours had passed and Tony had insisted on trying out a preliminary simulation on the computer.  After watching a simulated victims head explode in a dismal blaze of utter catastrophe they thought it would be a good idea to take a break and get something to eat.  Although it would have been rather difficult to stomach something after that grotesque display.
Tony sighed heavily, wishing desperately he hadn’t chucked his drink across the room earlier. God, he wished Steve were there. Tony really needed his advice, he needed to hear the situation from the Captain’s point of view. Yeah, this whole circumstance was incredibly complicated.
“Darling, if you go take your nap now like a good little girl, when you wake up perhaps Daddy will take you out to get ice cream.”
The Captain forced his body into action. He watched as she tried to hurriedly navigate the chaos of shredded metal. He thrust himself upon the Doom bot with as much power as he could muster right be for it was about to grasp her by the neck.
Steve groaned at the utter abhorrence of the situation. He quickly threw the shield and knocked the Rhododendron out.
Steve’s mind and heart shattered the moment Bucky’s prone form hit the pavement slowly turning the asphalt a lusciously hideous hue of scarlet. He could no longer process the world around him. All there was was the all-encompassing pain. The pain in his heart as the pieces became sharp and jagged, the pain in his body as he struggled against his own captor. His muscles began ripping themselves apart as he, on pure raging instinct, overpowered Iron Man with a strength never reached in all his life. His bones fracturing at the sheer intensity of his raging movements, his body was not built to withstand such brutal exertions.
"Careful Stark! They are merely hatchlings. What would the mother think?" The Rhododendron mocked from behind a convenient barricade of debris.
Tony taught him enough about machines and robotics that he was sure that he would be able to take this one down.  Steve began to attack what would be the robots natural weak points but found that they were protected.  The robot itself moved somewhat sluggishly at least in comparison to the quick footed Captain.  But damn when the Doom Bot landed a hit he sure felt it.  This thing was a power driver.
"About a week ago." Steve replied hoping there is no harm telling Tony about the details of his condition.
Steve paused for a moment wondering just what this young woman is or can be capable of. Professor Xavier is the leading telepath in the world, but even he couldn’t get passed Calamity’s mind barrier.
It is such a shame, Asgardian alcohol is the one thing he’d absolutely let kicked his ass right now. And really, in terms of alcohol, it’s probably the only thing they can.
Johnny had proven himself invaluable but can’t keep going like that forever. Same for Ben. Not only that but they were running out of time before the higher up’s got involved.
“Nah ah, not yet.” Tony cut him off. “This cup must be empty before we start- whatever this is gonna be.”
Bucky sprang up, quickly evading another round of bullets. He needed to be quicker. The moment one of them realized Stark was truly the worst threat it was over. He needed them to stay absolutely focused on him. He dodged low to the left and took careful aim and shot agent number 4 three times, one in each shoulder and one in the left leg. The man went down fast screaming. He should have lost the use of his arms so he was down and out as he was writhing on the floor in pain.
“His name is Graham Rhododendron and he calls himself, wait for it, the Rhododendron. Go figure. He was Harker’s number one lackey.” Bucky informed still staring at the ceiling.
How the fuck did that happen!? Nobody was supposed to know!! Rhodey and Pepper don’t even know! What the ever-loving Fuck!? Fuck!
He made sure to give Clint a hard look, warning him not to start any trouble.  However Clint was highly unlikely to do so at this point still gingerly touching at his swollen eye every so often.  A constant reminder to keep his head on straight.
Talking about Coney Island and the photos led Steve to remember why he had wanted, no, needed to paint that scene. Bucky was always on the edge of his thoughts. For the longest time it was just the two of them vs. the world, always together, till the end of the line. But Bucky’s end had been met in the dead of winter falling to his death into an icy river.
“She still remains on earth. But your absence has not gone unnoticed.” Heimdall replied with an air of foreboding.
He looked down again. Aaaand that was a huge, massive mistake. Somehow, she had intensified the look. How did she do that??
What?  The alien attacked the ‘School for Gifted Youngsters?’  But most of the occupants were just kids.
“What do you think about all of this?” At Steve’s question everyone looked up to Tony to hear his reply.
“No, no, we’re good. As long as it’s not something over the top shocking like it was with Steve or something… It wasn’t Steve, right??” Was Tony’s shocked and over exuberant, apprehensive response.
But then... What if the whole letter was a ruse? A way to trick him into letting his guard down or to placate him into giving up the search so that Steve and the abomination could run away together. No! No, that was too low even for Steve. No, he had to think positive. He absolutely would not let those thoughts consume him not yet, not yet.
From where Steve was leaning on the wall he thought he could make out electrical burns on Clint’s arm and neck. The Captain just assumed he got them from Natasha, again. Before things could get further out of control Fury took over.
Yes, Tony, this was the perfect idea. Go barge in on a mentally unstable super assassin at 3 AM in his own room completely unarmed in addition to a significant lack of clothing. Good job!
The soldier nodded, bracing himself. It was a painful and wobbly stance but he held firm trying to control his breathing. Tony got close to the door activating a setting on his wrist watch. He nodded at Bucky as the soldier limped to obscure his presence at the wall by the door.
Angie had taken Ellie to go to the bathroom and get breakfast. Steve wanted to stay behind in case something happened. He was far too high strung to eat anyway.
He stiffly maneuvered the laptop back over his lap and struggled to open the lid. He wedged the lid between his teeth and pried it open. He did his absolute best to complete the code one-handed. Mercifully, even now, there were still a few Wi-Fi signals available that he was able to piggyback off of. He sent the code to Jarvis and hoped beyond hope that the AI could make it work. He did the best he could up to this point. He closed the lid and hid the computer the best he could in a nook he found in the façade of the building.
But before Steve could figure out how to calmly talk things over with him, the man had disappeared out of thin air just as Ellie rounded the corner.
This was so stupid! Everything was just so messed up! Why did it have to be this way? Why couldn’t Steve trust him? Why couldn’t he choose Tony for once? No, he chose the abomination, Hydra’s lapdog, and it stung.
Steve looked Tony in the eye and replied, "No, I guess I can't, but if you wanted to take me on a date all you had to do was ask." Steve said with a smirk.
He was going to ask about them again when he saw a brilliant flash of light followed by an all-consuming clap of thunder. Steve realized why Tony seemed so calm. He finally relaxed and let Tony carry him to the helicarrier.
However, Steve had to take the lead point.  There was still a deadly assassin on the loose on top of everything so Fury was still underground.  The Captain had to put his selfish desires aside and lead what’s left of their team.  No unit came out unscathed and Steve had to rally what’s left of their broken numbers.  As it was they lost Bruce, Betty and Eric.
"How could you?! How could you have done all this? I just can't help but to think about all the people that got hurt along the way because of you! If it weren't for you then Tony and I could have…"
He grasped the edge of the bloodsoaked garment and lifted it gingerly. He gasped shocked at what he saw.
The man was hard to swallow unless you knew how he operates… God he was so glad he did not say that out loud. Anyway, though Tony was a difficult person, he was full of heart artificial or not.
Before he could decide on what to do next, he heard a commotion over the com line. His ire peaked when he heard that pink rabbit’s squealing voice.
“He’d come for me!” He nearly shouted. “But how would he find me? How would I find him? It’s not like they can walk up to the tower and ask for me. It’s probably all over the news that I had abandoned ship anyway.”
He had forgotten who the real enemy was. Calamity’s triumphant sneer as she watched him beg and plead for her to return Steve to him will forever mock and haunt him. He had realized then and there what Calamity truly meant when she said Steve needed to feel more pain. They all had been foolish enough to play right into her hand. He will never forget the things that had transpired by the docks.
He got up and took a deep breath.  Now or never.  He subconsciously adjusted his blue shirt and wipes nonexistent dirt off his jeans as he made his way to Tony’s lab with resolution.
Tony idly thought back to some of their first encounters and cringed. There is some truth in what the Soldier was saying.
To be honest, out of everything that had happened the last two days the news of Howard’s upcoming nuptials was by far the hardest to believe.
To Steve’s utter annoyance Tony still calls him that infernal nick name. “I’ll get right on that. JARVIS?”
Tony whipped around to look at the hole. The mother was still wailing and squirming as she tried desperately to claw her way out. A few hundred more chrysalis came through and as he stared at the pseudo-void for a time, he was able to discern that the hole had in fact stopped closing and even more distressing, he realized, it was also ever so slightly opening back up again.
"It's fine. Maybe this 'timeline,'" He air quoted timeline. "Will end up differently for us, you're still in contact with Howard Stark, right?"
“Natasha, it’s fine is in it? It doesn’t really matter how he did it as long as it is done.  We can now track this person and figure out potentially who might be next.”  Steve retorted.
He suddenly felt a sharp, wrenching, twisting, and unbearable pain in his gut. Steve was so destroyed over this new revelation that it took him a moment to realize that the new sensation of painful agony was not emotional but physical. He slowly looked down to see that Bucky had impaled his metal arm into Steve abdomen. They both watched with shocked expressions and morbid fascination as crimson blood began to run down the polished steel plates like gorgeous streams priceless liquid garnets.
Soon there would be no more of this. In a matter of days there was a good chance he was going to cease to exist. A few hours ago that thought scared the living shit out of him. However, since then he’s come to find a modicum of peace with. He was sure Tony was going to figure out how to use the code. He was happy that the others could be saved, even if he could not. He found peace and that knowledge.
Steve stopped him by grabbing his face with both hands and placing his forehead upon Tony’s. Tony let out a shuddering breath.
It was only a matter of time before I had a name for these awful things that plagued the various races of the universe. Malice, apathy, hatred and evil.
“This is amazing, Babydoll! Wow, Rocky is rather muscular.” Steve noted the pony had been portrayed very masculine. It had very prominent bulging muscles. He did not know what to make of that.
“Really, twenty? I thought it would be more than that, at least fifty. But still, twenty channels all about me. People are just so fascinated with me.” Tony smirked. “And besides, I know the Lego story.”
Steve jumped back to avoid the first swipe of the knife but missed the second as the Winter Soldier had successfully drove it into his abdomen. The soldier flinched and seemed confused for a moment. Steve used that opportunity to pin the hand with the knife behind the man’s back trying to force him to drop it.
Tony’s eyes widened in horror. That awful and painful realization hitting him finally. He knew logically what it meant for Steve to awaken in this time 70 years from his own time. But it wasn’t until that very moment that Tony truly understood everything Steve lost that day.
She eyed him for a moment. There was a time he wouldn’t have hesitated to suggest that they could share a shower together. Now, however… She smiled. She could tell that he really did have it bad for this person. (Let’s be honest, she knew who it was but wanted Tony to at least have this to himself… For now.)
Barnes seemingly sensing Tony’s thoughts piped up again. “I don’t care what you think, Jazz is ageless, you gotta admit that.” The soldier smirked.
In no time, he arrived at the Raft. It was a super max prison located in the middle of the ocean designed to house dangerous enhanced individuals. The Avengers, as a team, had put most of the prisoners there themselves. He loathed to go there for anything other than business and even more so recently to avoid being anywhere near a certain prisoner. Unfortunately, said prisoner was the very reason he had to come. That prisoner was the only person in the world that could tell him what he needed to know.
A/N: Welcome back, Earthlings! I have a superduper long chapter for you today. Even though I split this chapter up from thirty-seven, it still remains massive. Oops! Oh well, for those of you who enjoy long chapters, you’re going to enjoy this.
He had managed to wipe most of the foam off of himself before they headed up, but yeah, a shower would be great.
Everyone ran to the sick bay were the victims were located for analysis and treatment. As they arrived the leading physician met up with Fury to brief him.
“You obviously wholly underestimate me.” Tony stated in a triumphant smirk as he snapped his fingers and gestured wide, signaling all his holo-image ports to display, all around them, every single design for the soldier’s prosthetic arm he had created thus far.
Steve could feel the rage and desperation rolling off of Tony in waves. He licked his dry chapped lips and tried to make amends.
Steve felt hopeless and broken.  It hurt.  It cut him deep.  This was his home and his family, his friends and Allies.  He was utterly useless, unable to stop this from happening.  He slid down the walled nearest him and slumped on the floor in a catatonic state.  He did not know where he was, what room or what floor. All he knew was that this was all his fault somehow.
He could barely make out Natasha screaming his name as the wind raced past him. He angled his dive to hug close to a major support beam. The only one remotely accessible from his descent from the top floor and the odd shape of the building. He had to time it perfectly or lights out.
Before Steve could even answer, Captain America's shield clattered suddenly on the ground next to them. It was covered in blood, gore and ooze. It reeked of a dank putrid odor.
Anyway, that’s all they were able to get out of him.  He said that he had met with Harker’s representative, Graham Rhododendron, once and that $100,000 ended up in his account every month after he signed the contract.  Of course the funds were untraceable even with Shield and Tony’s technology.
Bucky found that whole situation sickening. On the other hand, he knew Steve. He knew that despite his absolute displeasure at being imprisoned in such a way he wouldn’t have went through such deceitful and underhanded lengths to escape. Something else happened that forced his hand. He had a pretty good hunch of what or who that was too.
Tony blinked in surprise. “Hey!” The genius nudged him. “Earth to Sergeant Dick head! I said are you ready for step two!?” He bellowed.
“Hmm.” She became pensive, “I was afraid that.” She sighed heavily. “What you have is a form of shell shock, Steve. It’s a side effect of the extreme conditions you were in then subsequently nearly freezing to death.”
If and when Earth fails Calamity will move on to the next planet. Like part of their age old original plan they intend on gathering as much information together to hand off to the next world. They ended up disconnecting the helicarrier from Shield and are using it as a sky base.
“Yeah, that does suck doesn’t it. And let me tell you I hate not knowing about you. But, we can look at it this way. We get to learn about each other all over again, wouldn’t that be fun?” Steve said trying to find a suitable way to give comfort and reassure his daughter.
“Clint.” Was Tony’s immediate response. Bucky’s eyebrows shot straight up in surprise. Tony backtracked. “I mean he hasn’t actually shit in my coffee but that man has no respect for your everyday coffee drinker.” He clarified.
Suddenly, the three air subs in pursuit were shot out of the sky by an invisible aircraft. The subs plummeted back into the ocean with a terrible kerplunk. Tony turned his attention back to the approximate location of the aircraft. As he kept watching the bay doors of the jet opened.
"That's right, I just made it look like they were. I knew it would separate you and Anthony and inevitably pit you two against one another. Anthony lashing out at you in grief, heartbreak and anger drove down the final nail in the coffin so to speak. It was the exact last piece I needed to claim you. Everything played out beautifully after that."
Tony wanted to add in his own two cents to that but found his chest felt painfully constricted and he was barely able to breathe.
Steve knew it was coming but every word felt like a punch in the gut, like his gut needed any more abuse.
Tony smiled despite himself. As he watched Bucky’s prickly obtuseness all of the new information he had gathered these last few hours became a raging storm of knowledge swirling around in a nightmarish typhoon inside his brain. The only way to stay afloat and not let his oppressive and pessimistic thoughts take over was to focus on Steve.
He turned to the dishes in a stupor. Of all the things to throw him through a loop after waking up in this time, Howard Stark’s engagement truly takes the cake for being the most unbelievable. He couldn’t keep the wry smile from forming on his face as he scrubbed at a plate.
As it was Natasha was out of commission due to a minor concussion and a bullet wound in the shoulder.  It went through and through and missed anything vital but it was going to hurt for awhile.  Clint came out of it the least scathed.  His various cuts and bruises already well treated and on the mend.  Maria had a broken arm from a particularly nasty run in with the Soldier’s metal arm.
Tony stared at Barnes steadily and challengingly, not breaking eye contact considering if the other man had the opportunity Bucky would snap Tony’s neck without hesitation.
It took a moment to really think about what he wanted to say to Tony. He went back through the pages of his sketchbook that depicted the genius and all those mundane everyday moments. He paid extra close attention to the way he re-created Tony’s smile, everything to the way his eyes shine and his lips curved.
"Yeah, you don't see too many people with facial hair like that." He mused in agreement. "Know anybody like that?" He asked.
It wasn’t until he felt tiny hands touch his sensitive flesh and tears roll down his skin did he realize most of his suit was gone. It had been torn to shreds during their escape. There were but a few wisps of material covering his torso. At least his pants remained mostly intact or else the situation would have been crazy awkward. He realized that his helmet was also missing and when the children calmed enough they hungrily took in his appearance.
"Don't worry, Cap, I've got you covered." Tony handed him a couple of devices. "Energy shields." He said at the Captains questioning look.
Before anyone could shed their tension and ask what was going on, the screen flashed suddenly and information and alerts flew into view at an alarming rate. Tony watched as all of the random ones and zeros that had plagued him for so long started to coalesce and come together into recognizable patterns and sequences.
Tony nodded slowly, “Yeah, a .5% chance.  She said it’s in the code.”  The genius stated despondently.
He nodded. She helped him remove all the layers to fully assess the damage. Once she got a clear view she gasped. Gnarly was an understatement. There were three major roads of stitches on his stomach that branched out like a crude peace sign. There was also a long jagged one on his right arm. Nearly all of them on his arm were torn or clearly on the verge of tearing.
On a reflective surface, a broken monitor of all things, was the reflection of the mysterious woman!
Happy to see a burger section of the menu, Steve was quick to reply, I will definitely be having this bacon western cheeseburger with the home-style onion rings.  And I would also like a prickly pear lemonade with that.”  The Captain smiled as he handed the waiter his menu.
He breathed a sigh of relief as he placed the last little flick of highlight on the face plate. He was finished.
Tony made an obscene gesture behind Bucky’s back before gently moving a lock of brown hair aside revealing the back of the soldier’s neck.
Suddenly, Tony's containment field around her that had been containing the caustic fluid's and gases fractured, expelling all of the vile contents. She weaved her head to and fro and looked at each of them in turn as if seeing them for the first time. More caustic fluid accumulated within her massive maw and flowed out of her beak at an alarming rate.
“Please? The high and mighty Tony Stark saying please? I didn’t think it was in your vocabulary. Learn something new every day, huh?” The archer teased.
Tony shook his head. "Like I said, the hole is going to destabilize and grow until it consumes everything. That's not all, if the hole gets any bigger that creature will be able to come all the way through." He replied gravely.
“So you just stop to admire it?  What? Did you just stand there and wish you were one of the kids playing in the yard?”  Tony asked as he smirked at the captain with that twinkle in his eye.
That is until they heard him scream. They felt there blood run cold in unison. Steve said that he would contact them if he needed assistance. But what if he was unable to. They were about to storm the facility when a pretty banged up Captain America barreled through the exit with a different looking  Doom Bot following close behind him. As soon as the Captain maneuvered a sharp left out of the way they opened fire.
“Well, you’ve captured Fury’s personality with those colors but I was expecting something a little more visage-esk.”
The coding was an utter mess. It looked like someone had chewed up the patchwork code then vomited it all over the fucking place. Tony had Jarvis running the best pattern recognition algorithms in the world in an attempt to figure out how to stitch back together terabytes of ones and zeros the way it was meant to be. Calamity really, truly, knew how to fuck with him, she really did. As soon as he felt like he has made significant progress she somehow makes everything thousand times more difficult. It’s like every time he takes one solid step forward she painfully knocks him ten spaces back.
Not good. Back at the tower he had Jarvis manufacturing more of them, but one Iron Legion robot every five minutes was not going to cut it. Gotta focus on the black hole of death first.
No, he most certainly was not fine. How is it he could remember Tony but not remember his significance. It was just right there on the forefront of his mind but he could not reach it. He was really starting to get scared.
“I’d been fighting with myself for days now on whether or not I should.  I wanted…  No, needed to know I was doing it for the right reasons.”
He watched Steve destroy the radio after receiving the executive kill order. Okay, yeah that definitely looked bad.
I was no stranger to death, I had spent a fair amount of time closely observing the flora and fauna of the world before encountering her. I was entirely familiar with the laws of nature at that point, yet I truly could not comprehend what I had just witnessed.
As he was picking out an absurd color scheme for a spatula attachment there was suddenly a puff of warm air blown right into his left ear.
The only people left on the top two floors with him were Jane, Darcy, Coulson, Scott and Natasha. Nat was going to be the hardest by far. If Jarvis realized the connection between his movements, then hello steel jacket.
Sometime after Tony had passed out in his arms Steve carried him to his room and tucked him in.  He proceded to track down the remaining members of his team to see how they were doing.  He made sure each and every one of them were in a more or less sound state of mind, at least as much as possible in these grisly circumstances.  He tried his best to give comfort where he could hoping none were too eager to give up just yet.
He’s usually not this out of it. But considering the circumstances, he feels he should get a pass. He kissed Peggy and Ellie before heading upstairs.
"Jar, run the distortion program." Tony commanded quickly as he manually continued to solder wires and clasp mechanisms together.
“Yeah,” he swallowed back his pride. This was for Bucky. “I wanted to apologize.” He did at first after all.
“It is still nowhere near perfect.  Though her face clearly pops up it is still obvious from the blurriness that it needs major work.  And this is with the Professor getting into my head and making me relive the experience of physically encountering the force of her energy myself.  Oh god I need a drink.”  Tony stated with an extreme air of exhaustion.
Somehow with the greatest stroke of luck, Steve had stumbled upon, quite literally, his shield.  He stopped for a moment and thanked God for small mercies.  He lifted the shield took a deep breath and continued on.
“Of those three, there was one that I desperately hoped would not be the foe you seek.” He shuffled though the paged till he stopped at one.
Steve took that time to gaze around the shop in an attempt to gauge what kind of gift Peggy may have ordered for Howard and Maria. Unfortunately, what he saw was that the shop contained a little bit of everything a newlywed couple could ever want or need.
Crap, no wonder they couldn’t get a foothold. Storm would change the air but whatever this source was would just produce the electro-magnetic waves in such a way that it undid her work.
“I know the feeling.” The soldier muttered dryly. “I don’t know how complete this is,” he murmured remorsefully. “I memorized as much of it as I could, when I could.” He lifted his hand away from screen. “It’s the best I can do.” He paused for a moment, looking over his work, and snorted in derision. “It’s stupid that it took seventy years for me to get this to you.” He mused regretfully.
And, of course, don’t forget to leave me a review and let me know what you think so far! You guys rock.
Of everything they went through up till now, at the present they are here, prey to this unknown thing like icing on the accursed cake of their lives.
It gave him just the jolt that he needed to stay awake. Tony forced his attention on to their iron gripped hands, then from there allowed himself to make eye contact with Steve. His heart jolted at the contact, like it needed any more abuse at this moment… But the one thing he was definitely able to discern, was that Steve definitely had a plan.
“Well what if the Asgardians help somehow? How many could fit through the Bifrost? There are ways Asgardians have to evacuate a plant aren’t there?"
“Just so you know I will never let you live this down, Cap. You were so tripping out. You my friend lost your cool.” At his final declaration Tony started to chuckle which only served to piss off our dear Captain.
Steve took a deep breath and tried to absorb everything she told him. It was shocking, morbid, and heart wrenching, the awful things she experienced and ultimately committed. He was honestly beside himself with revulsion and heartache. He could very well be in the presence of the person who committed one of the first mass genocides of the universe. However, despite her savage and tempestuous transgressions, he understood her pain. If anything, he understood, all too well, that kind of pain. He knew what grief and anguish could do to a person, what that kind of misery could drive a person to do.
After releasing the butterfly, Ellie had watched his progress for some time. After he was finished with the yard, he could see her visibly vibrate with excitement and anticipation. He sighed fondly.
That man was Tony Stark, Howard Stark's son. Which explains why he's capable of such fascinating ingenuity. That's why it was so earth shattering to hear Peggy say that Howard couldn't have children. It was because of Tony and whatever his relationship is or was with him.
“Ha! So you were listening! Half the time I think I’m talking to myself.” The genius said ponderingly.
He pressed his hands deeper into the phantom pain until it screamed back sharply for a moment. The flying suit of armor from his dreams flashed into his mind. Somehow, despite everything it was oddly comforting.
“Five, you have been to one world in five different realms.” Thor stated slowly a realization dawning.
"Stark, can you make a new one before either of those two things happen?" Captain America- Barnes questioned with urgency.
The Soldier’s initial reaction was shock then it quickly turned to excitement and amazement. To experience the professors special power first hand was exhilarating. Steve began to smile.
Tony snapped his attention to the Rhododendron who was now fiddling with the device Tony had worked on. "You could not have blocked me out! It's impossible!" He bellowed.
"Hope to see you again, my boy." After handing Steve the stone in a small paper bag, Frank held out his hand again.
As the battle against the hell birds raged on on the other side of the city, none were present to hear the last reverberating beats of this particular heart monitor. Thus, no one was there to witness Steven Grant Rogers succumb to the alluring siren call of sweet eternal oblivion.
This action then served to attract billionaire’s attention further.  Almost immediately the Captain’s eyes lit up.
It was so hard to focus. To figure out what to say. He couldn't even fully comprehend what was happening. He was, however, beginning to understand one thing…
He displayed the contents of his phone onto the large monitor of the room. It flashed on and showed the image of the woman in the vicinity of six of the eight victims. Obviously Tony’s filter doing its job.
Quickly wiping the blood from his lips he gripped his shield tight and bashed it into the bot as hard as he could, stopping it from beginning another assault. He quickly whipped around and jabbed the shield’s edge into the elbow joint of the bot successfully forcing the bot to release his leg. Steve shot up off of the floor diving between the bots legs and sprinted for the exit.
“I had been trying to get your attention for nearly five minutes now. Stop being a baby.” She replied smoothly. “Well, I’ll get right to it. The Army isn’t going to break down your doors yet. But now they are going after the company. It’s only a matter of time Tony.”
He reached out and touched the Captain’s left cheek gently.  Steve relaxed into his touch, they haven’t communicated properly in days.  Yet another thing he hates.
See? This was a mission, something to focus on. Tony was afraid to return to the tower, to his workshop all by himself and alone with his thoughts. After everything, he knows how it would be so easy to slip into an episode of self-loathing mania.
He grabbed the broken man and pulled him in close and held him tightly. Steve ran his hand through Tony's hair soothingly. Tony stiffened at first then relaxed a little. Steve did not know what to say, he wanted to tell the man that he forgave him and that he loved him so much as he felt his soul scream at him to do so.
They should know him well enough to know that he wasn’t going to stop looking for Bucky, that nothing was going to stop him from looking. Now all he had to do was figure out an escape.
“Why can’t you just settle and use your time to do the things you enjoy? Just sit and paint or spend time with us!?” Tony pleaded this time.
Even as she predominantly held his attention as she worked extra hard on the pony’s feathers, his eyes kept flickering down to his own drawing of the odd suit of armor from his dreams. The more he tried to understand and identify the torrent of emotions he felt upon viewing the image the more it all became foggy and slipped through his fingers like fine sand. But there was one thing that he somehow knew for sure.
“We thought the worst when we could not find them!”  Kevin and Tommy’s father said to him.  His wife began to weep as she patted Tommy and Kevin’s hair.
She turned and gave Ellie a proud and wistful smile when the child began to discuss her Rocky drawings and suddenly for a moment he could clearly picture her playing the piano with a small brown haired boy.
“No!  Please don’t!”  Steve begged reaching for her.  Just as he finally reached her his hands caught air and she was gone.
With that, and after giving each other all sideways glances, they had all separated to go their own ways to their designated sleeping quarters.  We’ll just have to see what five hours bring.
"Yet, even after all that effort, you still failed." Steve replied thoughtfully with a dash of petty derision. He was still digesting the full-length in which she took to get him to submit to her.
Thor of course will return to Asgard to find out more about the planet’s history before their demise. And of course our poor Captain has once again been put on standby. That did not sit well with him.
“FROM WHAT!?”  He snapped furiously, unable to control his unstable emotions.  “What are they protected me from?!  No one will tell me!”
If I can pull it off then everyone will be more aware of one another, will understand on a fundamental level that every life has value and that to hurt another is to hurt oneself. I want to achieve supreme empathy."
Tony laced his fingers into Steve's Golden hair and pulled him down to capture his lips into a passionate kiss. Tony nearly swooned when Steve not only kissed him back but almost instantaneously deepened the kiss into fiery bliss.
After everything that has happened up till now, he found it oddly comforting that there are still things in the world that can still surprise him.
They sat embracing each other for a time relishing in the fact that they could feel each other’s heartbeat indicating that they were both indeed alive.
“Yeah, I know. My childhood wasn’t sunshine and rainbows either and I may have hated to go home, but at least I wasn’t afraid to. And I do know what its like to be afraid to go to sleep at night but not because some one is going to rape me.” Tony commented after Clint’s response.
Everyone working together began to pull Tony, Steve and Bucky away from the black hole of death. Unfortunately, it wasn’t enough. The black hole was expanding and growing ever larger and it’s vicious suction ever stronger.
What was he going to do? Would it even be possible to leave the battlefield and make his way back to the tower to try and figure something out? He couldn’t just leave his team to fight her alone could he? Even if he could somehow feasibly make it back to the tower in a reasonable amount of time it would still take at least an hour to create something that would actually work. There just was no time!
They stared into each other’s eyes for a moment and Tony found that Steve’s eyes began to change color once more. The tips of the Captain’s fingers began to gently rub and play with the hair on the nape of the genius’s neck. They slowly began to move closer simultaneously, their lips were a mere inch apart now.
“I am sorry my friend, today has been a trying day.” Thor said apologetically as they began their trek over the rainbow bridge.
"Why not give your race a fighting chance? You'd rather me just be done with it?" She replied seemingly genuinely.
A little over a half hour later found our dear Captain in the middle of a briefing of a new case. A new case on top of everything else.
He clicked his tongue in frustration and shifted slightly in an attempt to find a more comfortable position in order to alleviate his aching muscles. He tried to move as subtly as possible as to not disturb Ellie. She stirred as if to almost wake up and then settled. He gave a mental sigh of relief. He did not want her to awaken, only to ask for her mother.
