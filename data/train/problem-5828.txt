“I see him-!” She dashed off once more - she seemed to be doing a lot of that tonight and he seemed to keep running after her; strangely enough that seemed to be the general basis of their new but growing relationship.
Severe bruising to his upper back and multiple lacerations, most of them superficial and his healing factor has already kicked into action. I am reading a mild concussion, however, so I recommend further scans once we’re back at the Compound.”
think it is?” she returned, surveying the space before them, the final product of which she could already envision in her mind’s eye.
And when she opened her eyes she was distantly aware of Helen and Shuri having a conversation over her head, their tones somehow too light and too casual but too far away for her to pay them any attention.
Shuri stared at him, her brows furrowed, nervous and unsure, and Bucky felt a pang of guilt for his unnecessary outburst but he just had to
She didn’t squirm, though; she stood there looking, if Laura was reading it right, almost confused in a muted, ten-years-in-captivity kind of way. She licked her dry lips and opened her mouth.
“Toni’ll be happy to see you’ve done your homework.” The remark was loaded with a million things that Steve couldn’t hope to deconstruct so he settled for a somewhat weary,
She remembered that then and the realization and understanding came like gust of wind, the information and potential justifications neatly slotting themselves into her mind.
That didn’t mean that it didn’t feel like it was personal. Or that Steve wouldn’t understand if it was, all things considered.
At some point Toni had walked out of the Compound, barefoot and unsuitably dressed for the night weather that had taken a turn towards winter.
She glanced at the door then back at him. “No more resistance than a door usually exerts,” she said slowly.
Helen looked to the side in remembrance, a rueful smile in her voice as she said, “I was only seventeen then. And
Clint supplied loudly, grinning tightly, “what if the patient wants us to be there? Y’know, for moral support? Or we might actually
As if he’d heard Steve’s inner torment, he craned his head over his shoulder, meeting Steve’s eyes. They held one another’s gaze for a long moment before T’Challa bowed his head in an understanding nod. There was nothing Steve could say in return that could appropriately convey how grateful he felt in that moment and it was yet another reason why-
Without waiting for a response, she squeezed once more before standing and making her way down to Lang and Laura, leaving Toni behind with more thoughts than she knew what to do with.
His hold on her softened and his eyes were sad and disapproving and she felt like a child being berated for doing something she
Bucky had watched Stark from the moment he’d stepped into the room. He’d watched her say her piece to Lang and Barton, seen the way she eyed Wanda’s magic through the corner of her eye as if she was anticipating a strike. He watched the way she resolutely, through sheer determination and grit, didn’t look at him or Steve.
Opening her eyes, she surveyed the suit before her with a heavy sigh, letting her fingers brush against the smooth, near impenetrable material. Hesitating for a bare second, she slipped her hand inside the mask and it came to life under recognition of her heat signature, the fabric stiffening and the visual mechanisms adjusting themselves.
By the time Toni had got up to leave Pepper was already picking up her phone to call SI’s trusted PR team to inform them that they were going to be outsourced for a massive contractual gig very soon. They were given the bare bones of the Accords and Toni’s plans for when it came to the Rogue Avengers - Toni cringed at the name - but Toni had faith they’d be able to come up with the right kind of spin. They’d pulled her out of more than a few scandals in the past, after all.
Steve blinked. “Um.” He shook his head. “Sources?” he prompted, raising a brow. T’Challa’s placid smile was surprisingly telling and Steve sighed. “My team?” he stated wryly.
“We can all do homework sessions together or something,” Toni said as she pulled back, grateful for the sight of Kamala’s bashful smile and reddened nose. “Plus you’ll each be getting an insight to whatever you’re all learning at school. Except for Shuri, who doesn’t even go to school but she’ll wanna join in.”
Toni sneaked a look at Harley, who was sitting on the kitchen counter, a bottle of ginger beer held loosely between his thumb and forefinger. She sidled over and hopped up on the counter next to him, nudging him with her elbow.
"No single word in English renders all the shades of тоска (toska). At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause. At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning. In particular cases it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness. At the lowest level it grades into ennui, boredom.” - Vladimir Nobakov in Lolita
“Come on baby boy, let’s get you ready to go.” Steve calls, rushing to pack everything he needs for the day at work as well as what Peter needs at daycare. Wanda still is not feeling too well, so it will just be Peter at daycare today. “Do you want Papa to help you put your shoes on?”
“Okay, I'll do my best. By the way, Peter just spilled his juice all over the table on purpose, so he's definitely getting a little antsy. We'd better keep an eye on that.” He walks into Wanda's room and sits next to her, giving her a brief kiss. “Are you giving your Daddy a hard time?”
“So fun.” Tony grimaces back at his husband, but quickly turns his attention back to Wanda and places a firm hand on the back of her soft thigh. “Baby, shh, you’re okay, it’s just a thermometer. You’re being so brave for us, such a good Daddies’ girl.” He tries to comfort, but it does not seem to help much as the girl keeps wriggling under him. Wanda arches her back in an attempt to sit up straight. She glances over her shoulder and looks at Tony with a tiny, heartbroken look.
“Hmm, was so sleepy...” Peter mumbles, his voice slightly slurry due to all the drugs. The oxygen mask also muffles his voice a bit. The boy blinks lazily, but when he spots his sister in Steve’s arms, he grins a little and seems to perk up. “Hiiii...” He says, waving a bit with his good hand. Stephen smiles softly and starts checking Peter’s vitals while the family catch up a little.
Wanda wakes up feeling strange. She is sick and shaky in a way that she has never been before, even when she has had little colds. This is different, worse. Her whole body aches and she feels like she can barely move. She forces herself to get up though, moving her pink blankets off of her body so she can stumble out of bed and onto the floor. She is not quite sure what to do and considers waking up little brother Peter, but does not want to disturb him. Maybe er Daddies will mind if she wakes them up, but she is not quite sure what else to do. At the very least, maybe cuddling with them will make her feel better.
“And then we had a bath to get clean and cheer up a bit, right?” Tony finishes and kisses Wanda’s temple. The girl nods, eyes downcast. She is too ashamed to say anything after her episode earlier and too tired to put up any more of a fight, no matter how embarrassing it might be to do things like have her temperature taken.
“Party, Papa.” Peter corrects as well, giving a cheeky grin as he kicks his leg back and forth. “Pop?” He asks, remembering what Tony said about Steve bringing popsicles.
“Hey, sweetheart…” Tony whispers, stroking the boy’s cheek with a finger. “It's okay, you're awake now. It's all over. We're here. You feel better, love?” He keeps his voice low so as not to startle Peter and tries to coax him out of his sleep by using gentle touches. “You were such a good boy, we're so proud of you. We're all here to see you now.”
“You sure she doesn’t need to go to the d-o-c-t-o-r?” He spells it out, knowing that they will be in for a world of trouble if he says it aloud. “She’s being pretty fussy.”
“Family…” Wanda parrots, before finally knocking out and Tony sighs a bit in relief and closes hi eyes too, falling asleep a few minutes later as well.
“Back home with Mama. Just like you’re back home with Papa,” Steve tells him. “You did such a good job reading with me, sweetheart. Thank you for all your help. Now can you tell Daddy how you’re feeling?” He just wants to check in and make sure he is still doing okay. “Do you feel icky like your sister or no?”
“That’s really nice of her. But, talk to us when you have bad thoughts, all right? Then we can work it out together.” Tony says, picking up the polar bear and handing it to the girl. He also grabs the storybook that they have been reading to Wanda. Unlike her brother, she can pay attention and enjoy multi chapter books. Wanda yawns and nods, feeling her eyelids begin to grow heavier as she cuddles her stuffie.
Before leaving, Stephen peaks into Peter’s room, pleased to find a little smile on the boy’s face while he is fast asleep in Steve’s arms. The caregiver seems to be deeply asleep as well. The doctor chuckles softly before making his way out quietly, leaving the family to finally rest in content.
“You sleepy, little love?” He asks while Tony gets up to fetch some more water and Wanda’s medication that she was prescribed a few days ago. Wanda nods, trying her best to keep awake.
Wanda curls up into a ball on the couch, grabbing her Cinderella blanket and pulling it over her body so she is fully hidden. Maybe Daddy will not see her, but she is too tired to care. She just calls out after him.
“Hmm.” Peter nods and lifts his good arm to be picked up. “Pwetty hearts. Go now, Dada, giddy up.” He says, patting at his Daddy’s upper arm. Tony scoops him up easily and kisses his cheek.
“She’ll be okay.” Stephen tells Tony. “I’m sure she doesn’t want her temperature taken again, but do it if you feel like she’s getting worse.”
“I think he’ll adore it.” Vis says easily. It is a stunning card after all. It has been a pleasure babysitting Wanda for over a day now, but Vis noticed that he could not do it much longer because Wanda was truly getting impatient with her questions about her family, and her brother in particular. Vis knows that Peter is in surgery as they speak, but he has not told that to Wanda. He will let Steve and Tony do that.
“Of course, babe.” Steve smiles and gives Tony one last kiss before heading upstairs. “Oh, I do love a wedding.” He muses as he walks up the stairs. In Wanda’s room, Peter perks up at the sound of Steve walking up the stairs and looks at the door to wait for his Papa to appear. When he does, he stands up and pads over with his good arm stretched out.
“Papa’s at work, sweetheart. He’ll be back soon. He’s gonna go to the store and get popsicles for you.” Tony promises. “He’ll colour with you too, I promise. What do you want to colour, baby?”
”That’s my bravest girl.” Tony grins and kisses both of Wanda’s cheeks. ”You can go play while I make breakfast, all right? Then we’ll eat on the sofa and watch a Barbie movie.” He says and then pats the girl’s bum before the head to the kitchen again.
“Oh, Christ, baby girl, of course we do! I love you to the moon and back!” Tony exclaims a little at how absurd Wanda is being. Sure, the girl has her more anxious moments, but she has never questioned their love towards her like this. For a moment, Tony wonders if Wanda’s fever has spiked and is making her delirious, but her forehead does not feel excessively warm against his cheek as he brings her to the bathroom. “You must never think that we don’t love you, Wanda baby, because we love you so much and that’s the truth.” He emphasises and opens the bathroom door. Wanda breaths out a sigh of relief. Daddy sounds serious and like he dies when he comforts her and Peter at night. And he is cuddling her, right? He loves her. He must.
“All done!” Wanda announces, hopping out and splashing and dripping water everywhere, not caring at all that her hair is still soapy and wet. “Let’s go, Daddy.” She steps out of the tub and slips a little as she grabs his hand to pull him with her. “More cuddles. Now.”
“I know honey.” Steve pats her shoulder. “Let’s go give you a bath, you’ll feel better.” Wanda sighs, but finally relents.
Meanwhile, Wanda is in her room, feeling fussy and sad about not getting to go to daycare. She opens the door and pokes her head out as soon as she hears Peter padding up.
“Daddy, I don't want the thermator.” Wanda mumbles into Steve’s arm. The girl can say a lot of big words, but thermometer is just a little too big, especially with the state she is in. Unable to resist getting to snuggle with her Papa though, Wanda finally moves so she is laying on top of his chest and nuzzles his shoulder. “Daddy, did I get cursed because I was bad and didn't listen? I'm sorry. Can you make it go away?”
“Baby, I got you some water. Do you think you can try and drink it a little bit?” Wanda shakes her head. “Still feel icky.”
“Yeah! It's a friendly bear so he won't eat her.” She explains. “Even if a bear tried to eat me, I'd still be nice to it. It's just trying to live in its home. Forest. Trees. And flower.” She yawns again, suddenly feeling very tired. “Kisses. And…” She starts to mumble a little bit, getting lost in her own daydreams again. “He's so handsome and he loves me. He's a prince. Pretty flowers, Daddy.”
“Is big...” He states a little dumbly, letting Stephen lift him up on the bed. “Owie!” He yelps, then quiets down when Tony moves to support his injured and cast arm to take the weight.
“Thomas get...” The boy thinks. “Dinos!” Dinosaurs are the second best thing next to puppies, he thinks.
“I know you do, but this takes time. Right?” Tony smiles down at Peter. “But, you really need to remember that, Wanda.”
“Good idea.” Steve agrees. He and Tony both kiss Peter goodnight and make sure to tuck some of the blankets around him. It is not as warm and cozy and familiar as his room at home, but it is definitely better than the ER where they were before. Quietly, they file out after Stephen, making sure to leave the door slightly open before turning to the doctor to hear what he has to say.
“Oh honey, she can’t come today,” Steve tries to explain. “She’s feeling icky still and we want her to rest and not get anyone sick until she’s all better. But, you’re still gonna have a lot of fun today. Maybe you can colour a picture and take it home for her.”
“Oh, Peter.” Steve sighs, taking a deep breath to calm himself. “Come here. You’re going to help clean this up and then we’re going to have a little chat. We don’t spill things on purpose.” He would never punish for an accidental spill, but he can tell when it is no mistake. He cleans the mess up fairly quickly and then sits down with Peter in his lap. “Do you want to tell me why you did that?”
“You’re not going out today, honey, so let’s get this off. You’ll be much more comfy in your pjs.” Tony explains and removes the dress that Wanda had pulled over her head in a rush.
“What a good helper you are!” Steve praises him. “Come on, help Daddy get some food ready and then you can watch your movies.” Peter is too little to really help, but Steve tries to include him by having him pick out some fruit for breakfast and letting him help fill his bottle and Wanda’s sippy cup, telling him all the while how great he is doing. “Thank you so much for your help, baby. Do you want to go watch your movies now? You can cuddle with your sister on the couch.” Steve says as the family of four make their way down the stairs to the living room.
“Wasn’t quick...” Peter argues quietly since the MRI scan took over 5 minutes. But, all the crying and pain is making him exhausted so he simply slumps against Tony.
“I'd rather not take any chances to be honest with you.” Steve admits. “He plays at daycare with other Littles and you know how that can go. Probably better to keep him at home and resting for a while.”
Before leaving the little family to it, Thomas informs them that Stephen will be back soon with a treatment plan once he has consulted the ortho on call. While he gets changed, Peter relaxes a little at the familiar routine and at finally having a quiet moment with his Daddies. The gown is pretty cute with puppies on it, but it smells too clean and scratches his skin a bit.
“Steve, need your help here!” Peter looks up at Steve, daring him to leave him alone again and holds his sweater tighter in his tiny hand. Steve contemplates his options, then sighs and addresses Peter.
“What was that, princess?” Tony asks. He heard that Wanda spoke, but he did not hear what she said. With the thermometer in hand, Tony goes to sit next to Wanda and pats his thigh. “Lay on my lap, baby.”
“It’s good to see you too. Thank you so much for taking her.” Tony sighs. “We were just so freaked out yesterday and now they’re… Well, doing a procedure and they think he’ll be okay, but it’s still so much for him to handle.” He smiles at Wanda. “I hope she behaved for you.”
“Oh man…” Tony stops what he is doing and sighs. “She must've been pretty upset. Maybe it's time to have her go see Stephen. I could set up her appointment on the same day that Peter has his follow up, since he needs to go soon. What do you think? Maybe he'd feel better knowing his sister is getting a checkup too.”
“Honey, come lay down with Papa bear, hm?” Steve tries to tempt. He can tell that Wanda is a little shaky, even when sitting up, and he would much prefer for the girl to lay down and rest. The only thing worse than a sick Little, is a tired and sick Little. “And Petey’s still asleep. Let’s not disturb him.” Steve adds and pulls Wanda close, trying not to wince out loud at just how warm the girl feels. He would also prefer if Peter remained in his bed till they at least figure out what Wanda has and get some medicine in her. But, Tony and Steve are rarely that lucky.
“Yeah, it’s a bit hard sometimes.” Steve says and guides Wanda to the bathroom. Once there, he begins to undress the girl and puts her leggings, undies and blanket in the bathtub to be rinsed off. “Can you go potty for me, princess?” He asks, pointing to the toilet.
“Hmm, here.” Peter says, gesturing to Pooh’s arm. “We go fix? Go home?” He suggests, looking up at Tony hopefully. He does not quite know what they are waiting for anyway and he is getting quite bored and impatient with laying in the bed. It is not as soft and fluffy as at home and everything smells kinda weird. Almost as if it is too clean.
“Okay, okay,” Steve chuckles. “Papa’s gonna read the story. Let’s see.” He points to the words as he reads them and holds the book up so Peter can see all the pictures. He speaks softly, slowly, shushing Tony back to sleep when he sees him start to stir.
“I know, I know.” Tony says, not knowing what else to say and leans over to kiss his husband sweetly. Their kiss lingers for a bit, their lips just lightly touching before Tony gives one more peck and pulls back to meet Steve’s eyes again. “He’ll be all right.”
“Papa says no hopscotch today. I’ll show tomorrow. Look.” Wanda points to the TV screen, which is playing a rerun of Sofia the First. “She’s a princess. Me too. Do you wanna be a princess, Petey? We can pretend.”
“It's hair magic. But you don't need it, Daddy, because you're so handsome anyway.” She really does think that she has the handsomest Daddies in the world, and she is very proud of it. “You should put some in Peter's hair. Then it could be just like yours.”
“Peter, do you wanna finish up dinner and rest a little bit? Maybe we can call Wanda and see how she’s doing?” Steve asks, sitting on Peter’s other side while Tony continues to feed him.
“They are not bad people, Ms. Stark,” T’Challa told her gently, as if she didn’t know, as if she didn’t
He didn’t say anything for a while and just scrutinized the door like it was a puzzle, and Toni knew from experience that he was probably mentally retracing every single one of his steps up until she walked in.
Shuri pulled a face at her and Toni rolled her eyes. “And I didn’t take him out because he’s a mouthy little shit.”
And that was such a Kamala thing to ask, and it pressed into the tender peat of Toni’s soul, leaving an impression in the shape of Kamala’s own. Kamala was a soft one. All the kids were and tended to treat the bots like people but Kamala had a special kind of empathy that made Toni proud and terrified in equal measure because she
“That’s no- Jesus, that’s not the point. Speed healing’s great and all but you could’ve, you could’ve called me and I would’ve come help-”
Hello! It's been a while but I'm back from my holiday and I bear gifts of another chapter. I didn't have much internet access while I was away (because roaming charges are extortionist) but I came back to find my inbox full of you guys' comments and kudos and bookmarks and I was over the goddamn moon and it could never possibly get old, so THANK YOU for reading and sticking with me this far. <3
“Ms. Hill made several stops by the Compound while you were away, Boss. I allowed her entry today purely for her commendable persistence and because I assumed you would be interested to hear her pitch. However, if you wish I can initiate Protocol GTFO.”
“FRIDAY,” she gasped, stretching her hand out far in front of her but she couldn’t see it, she couldn’t
Natasha’s eyes never strayed from the screen; her expression was blank but Toni knew her well enough to see the way she broke the interrogation down to its smallest working parts, memorizing every nuance in the perpetrator’s tone, every facial twitch and analyzing every single one of his words as Toni might analyze a piece of tech.
“I’ll write up a formal offer letter for a Stark internship. Give a copy to your mother and to your school. You join combat training starting next weekend. Like I’ve already told Peter and Kamala, homework first, though.
And Steve believed in the very core of him that whatever simmering rages they harbored towards him, towards Toni and towards one another, they were all good enough, respectful enough,
“I meant what I said earlier, you know?” she said, sounding serious but earnest. “Doctor or no, we can do a lot more than regenerate a couple more inches of flesh and bone. I think today has shown that. You do good work, Toni. As Iron Man, at Stark Industries and in there.” She tilted her head in the direction of the operating theatre. “You’ve always said that you fix things, and it’s true. Now you can say that in some ways you fix people too. And I’m not just talking about Sergeant Barnes.”
- being suitably impressed when Kamala showed off her cape and Shuri and Hope talking about Disneyland. If only Laura and her family were here, if only the others-
Countless faces, opponents, appeared before him: people whom he’d beaten, a few he’d lost against for some reason or another. Eventually Ayo stepped in, jerking her head towards the mat and swiftly stepping in as his partner. She was an excellent fighter, her movements rapid and her hits quick and snakelike. She may not have had his strength, but she made up for it by going for his balance, getting the drop on him more than once.
He’d been in a much better mood ever since he’d been able to make contact with his daughter, Cassie.
But. Well. That wasn’t important right now. She was used to having her name dragged through the mud anyway.
“Listen,” she continued with a dragged out hesitation reserved for people being taken to the gallows, “I know you’ve...probably seen the news and all that stuff on the Accords and contracts and all.”
She paused, looked back at him, pursed her lips, then glanced sidelong at their audience before looking back at Bucky once more.
“What about the other two laws?” she asked, wishing for some reason that she had her shotgun with her even though there wasn’t actually anything to shoot.
It was a small, spherical golden bead with a delicate chain looped through the middle. She thought it might have been adamantium given the sturdiness, and wondered whether it had been FRIDAY or Vision who had shown them where she kept her extremely private store.
She craned her neck around and looked at where Laura was standing with an uncharacteristically nervous smile. Toni made a sound that was half a laugh and half a sob and gave her a meaningful nod before turning back to Rhodey.
They didn’t look at each other; maybe it was fear, fear of seeing the lie, fear of being caught out. Maybe it was just too hard.
And if she looked harder, if she looked with kindness, with a willingness to understand, she might see that his eyes were blue, so blue with just a hint of green -
There were multiple screens throw up around her, all of them videos of Spider-Man from different angles that she would alternate her attention to before working on a number of miniscule gadgets on the table.
and there were times, deep in the night, when she couldn’t help but wonder whether Wanda had left something when she’d touched Toni’s mind, some dark seed that would one day grow and sink its black roots into her psyche and change who she was entirely.
Nights were still the worst, though, when her mind wandered. So she would putter around the house or walk outside, looking for something to repair, letting her fingers do the work until exhaustion took her.
In the week after her return to the Compound Toni, Vision and Rhodes made an average of twenty calls per hour every single day between them. Toni confirmed and re-confirmed meetings with her lawyers - Shanthi McMahon had exasperatedly informed her that
They trembled and the muscles twitched and the scars were raised. But to her, they represented intricacy and detail, the fine kind of work on another human that she couldn’t possibly hope to reproduce in this lifetime. They represented lives saved, each one the center of his universe for the duration of the surgery. How important they must have felt.
Sooo, what did you guys think of FRIDAY and Vision's interaction? In my head FRIDAY is obviously Ana Jarvis. I just like the idea of Toni surrounding herself with people whom she trusts and I have headcanons of Jarvis and Ana parenting Toni the way kids should be parented whenever Howard and Maria aren't around.
,” was Shuri’s deadly certain response. “I’ll analyze everything FRIDAY has given me but I’ll need more-”
Laura opened her mouth to say something, then seemed to think better of it and just sighed, heavy and weary.
, since he’d heard rumors that Princess Shuri was quite intent on succeeding her brother as the Black Panther.
Folding her arms, Laura looked at a point over Toni’s shoulder, somewhere indeterminate and safe, and measured her words carefully.
“You sign the contract and the Accords, you hear me?” she finally hissed, when the yearning in his chest got too much. “You sign them and you come back to your kids.” She didn’t say
Wanda looked down at the ground, her hands shaking. She opened her mouth to say something, but all that left her throat was a quiet sob.
“Jarvis,” she said aloud, not entirely certain whom she was addressing because both would’ve given suitably dry responses. “What do I do?”
she was seeing, but one moment the lower half of Roxxon’s glass exterior was vibrating with an expanding explosion and the next there was a
Stark seemed to hang on his every word like a lifeline. He didn’t know her but somehow he was glad she had Colonel Rhodes on her side.
In spite of herself, she felt the corners of her lips curve upwards. “You’re one of the only people who isn’t.”
“Yeah. Maybe that’s exactly what I’m saying. Ah, well.” He grinned at Steve and clapped him on the shoulder. “It’s not the end, Steve. Just gotta be patient. We just gotta wait.” Then he stood, and jerked his head towards the table where Scott was laying out the food, Clint was setting out the cutlery and Wanda was pouring everybody water. “Food’s ready.”
When you choose to plant yourself like a tree, someone has to compromise. Someone will have to move.
“Why are you here, Vision? You informed the bots that the next time you returned it would be with Boss.” Another pause, and then, “You
She chuckled mirthlessly. “Some of it, yeah.” And massive understatement. “There’s a lotta people I need to convince first before I can make things happen. And there are going to be conditions.”
Toni smiled back at her. “We’d’ve been lucky to have had you. And something tells me you would’ve been able to sell the idea of the Accords
She felt her lips twitch and she rested her chin atop her fist. “Sounds like you know a lot about it.”
“You are angry today,” she observed. She tended to do that: observe and then voice her own observations.
“See that, guys?” she’d told them, patting You’s CPU casing. “That’s Peter Parker. You’re gonna meet him soon, I hope.”
“Because I saw what hatred did to my brother. I watched it. He called me, you know? After my fa-” Her voice broke and her hands were clutching the hem of her t-shirt, twisting tightly as she were gripping at the very foundations of her only remaining strength. “He called me and my mother. We had already seen it happen but he still called to let us know. And he told us who did it. Who he
Toni pressed her lips together and squinted at Shuri’s morose form, torn between amusement and concern. “I could say
“Um. You said that Toni shut you off before she left. So how come you…” She trailed off uncertainly.
. For some reason it filled her with an indescribable sadness of all she knew was to come if he and Kamala chose to walk down that path.
Afterwards, Stephen walked side-by-side with Rhodey as they took a turn around the PT room and Toni sat outside on one of the standard hospital interlocking chairs, browsing through her notes for the UN meeting. She felt like she’d gone through it a million times and yet still, she kept adding more and sending an endless string of emails to Shanthi and her team much to their exhausted exasperation. Shanthi actually called her at one point and snapped,
“Yeah you did,” she interrupted. “Whatever it is, yeah, you meant it. You’re a man of your word, right?”
“All taken care of,” was her cool, detached response. She was mad at him; everybody could tell but Clint seemed to be equally mad at her too.
Toni found her fingers laced with Laura’s, either for support or for something to cling to. She couldn’t help but be grateful for that small bit of comfort.
at dealing with crying people. “And I’m not even counting the fact that I have a small farm to run and I have to cook and
Just once, just one breath of joy that lit up her face and brightened her dark eyes and transformed her into someone Bucky hadn’t met before.
Laura stopped short when she saw Toni, scrutinized her from head to toe in a way that made Toni feel like a reprimanded child, then let out a puff of air, her expression simultaneously fond and exasperated.
She opened her mouth to argue - and defend both her dignity and her abilities - when she took in the playful glint in his eyes and saw how hard he was trying not to smile.
“I’ll look through his records,” was all she offered. “If it works I want your tech. You can patent it, of course, but I want it for free. A joint venture. There are a lot of people deserving of this.”
She felt her body burn, the heat searing her right down to what could only be the charred remains of her bones. She felt the ice of space put her back together again.
“Your duty,” she immediately replied, as if it were obvious, as if it were the only thing that mattered. He supposed to her, a creation that had yet to know the human experience, it was the only thing that mattered.
he was gonna do? He wasn’t gonna just let it be. Peter doesn’t just give up and walk away from a fight just because some asshole like me tells him to. He’s...he’s so
Her smile turned wry. “Yeah. It has, hasn’t it?” She and T’Challa shared a short look before she addressed them all. “Unfortunately, as much as I’d like it to be this isn’t a social call. I see wonders never cease.” She nodded towards Steve’s tablet and the stylo held loosely between his fingers and gave him a small smile. “So I guess we’ll start with the contracts first and work our way up to the Accords. That includes you too, Barnes.”
She’d given him a hastily spewed explanation, something that went like, “I have got so much shit to do but it is going to be incredible and you will bow before me,” and had disappeared into her lab for three days before finally calling on him.
Iron Man indeed, she thought with a grimace as the last metal rod finally came loose in her hands and the entire room shared a unified sigh of relief.
Most of all she remembered lying on her side with her back against the wall as the mattress dipped in front of her. She remembered the scent of skin, freshly washed, of heat radiating off muscular forearms. Of the bed creaking as they moved towards the middle, two magnets drawn to one another.
. Whose hands would you trust? Who would you look to to protect everything that you hold dear? You trusted the Avengers once.”
There was a stillness to the room, like a bated breath, everybody just waiting for Toni Stark’s pitch, to see not just what she had to say but
“We’re working on it,” Toni answered and Nat knew it to be the truth since she’d been reviewing his case files only this morning. It was only a matter of time. For
The shrug of her shoulders was a lost, unguarded thing. “One day at a time, I guess. Or maybe it doesn’t get fixed at all. Maybe it never can.”
“I don’t know how to convince you of how important this is anymore than I already have. You’ve seen the news. You’ve seen what the world has to say.” She looked down at her hands resting on top of the empty stand. They were shaking. “We started with one hundred and seventeen countries. And today...one hundred and eighty-four. That’s...amazing, isn’t it?” She smiled into the sea of faces. “What we’ve done...what
“My track record seems to suggest that I have a shitty way of treating friends,” she argued weakly, but didn’t pull away.
.” She hated being called that. “And I dunno, maybe a year ago? Isn’t that the going rate these days?”
“A conference in Tokyo,” Toni told her dutifully. “I asked Rumiko to introduce us after listening to your talk on catalyzing specific genetic mutations to cure disease.”
She was talking about the Accords and Steve couldn’t help it but the name alone sent annoyance and irritation crawling up his spine. But he continued to listen. Because he hadn’t before. And because he just wanted to hear her voice after so many months of silence.
“I’m taking my vitamins,” she remarked flatly, then added softly, “and going to therapy. Again, you might want to try it some time.”
“Night, night, baby. Sweet dreams.” He wishes, craning his neck to place a kiss of her temple and rubs her back to lull her to sleep. To be honest, Tony is feeling sleepy himself and right before he dozes off, he considers asking Steve if he can stay home with Wanda the next day.
“There’s a brave girl.” Tony coos when Wanda turns onto her side and shushes her gently when he pulls her pyjama bottoms and underwear down to expose her bum. “Now, this is gonna be a bit cold, baby, but it’s okay.” Tony warns and very carefully inserts the thin thermometer into Wanda bottom. Peter turns his head away and scrambles down from the bed. As much as he loves his sister, there is no way he wants to see her in this way.
“That’s going to help you, baby boy” Steve promises. “I promise you’re gonna be okay. You don’t have to do anything, just relax and listen to the grownups today, okay? And afterwards we can go get you something new to play with.”
When the machine starts up, Peter is again too stunned to really cry, but he breathes fast and tries to imagine something nice. He tries to think of their summer vacation last year when they had rented a beach house. It was the best vacation ever and Peter and Wanda got to eat ice cream twice a day. But, then the machine makes a loud noise and Peter yelps, but his head is luckily kept still so he does not ruin the image with his panicking.
“Honey, can I talk to you? I think Papa owes you a bit of an apology.” Peter can tell that something is up and adjusts his grip on Pooh in his arm.
“You’re staying with me, kitten, don’t worry.” Tony assures, bouncing Wanda in his arm as he fixes the apple juice in the Hello Kitty sippy. “And Peter’s probably having a snack at daycare now before nap time. And we’re gonna nap too.” He smiles, handing the sippy over to Wanda.
“Yeah, but… I can think in the corner.” Wanda usually does most of her deep thinking there actually, even if it is not fun. “I don’t know how to be good. I wanna play with Peter at daycare and I can’t and I feel sad.” It comes out in a rush. “Because I’m icky. What if I make him icky too?” She turns to Peter worriedly. “Do you feel good or bad?”
“Baby, no.” Tony says firmly and pulls Wanda aside before she can turn the stove on. “This is a job for Daddy and Papa only, okay? The stove is very hot and you have to be careful, so we’ll handle that.” He explains, but then he sees the frown on the girl’s face. “What’s up, sweetie pie? Tell Daddy what you’re thinking.”
“Great choice, honey. Let’s go read.” Steve picks Peter up and balances him on his hip. “We’re gonna read in a quiet whisper, okay? Like this.” He lowers his voice and puts a finger to his lips. Then he finally takes Peter over to the couch so he can cuddle a little with Wanda and Tony before he starts to read.
“There’s a good boy. You’re doing so well. We’re very proud of you and you’re going to have a treat when you’re all done, okay?” Stephen keeps talking in a soothing voice as he inserts the thermometer, patting Peter’s bum gently. The boy yelps out at the invading and cold pressure and whines loudly into Pooh’s fluffy tummy. How did he end up here and not downstairs on his play mat?
“Hey, honey!” Steve sweeps Peter up into his arms and settles him on his hip. “I heard you guys were playing together. Are the dolls going on exciting adventures today?”
“Really? The best?” Wanda is not sure that is true, but it feels nice to hear it anyway. She tries to think of a nice thing to say in return. “You’re the bestest doctor I ever had.” And that, she knows is true. Wanda sucks on her thumb a little anxiously, but feels better knowing that at least she is being a good patient. “I wanna watch Rapunzel. Can I?”
“What about the arm? We didn’t even get to radiology to get x-rays. They just gave him some painkillers and left us.” Tony points out to Stephen.
At the sound of that, Wanda instinctively covers her bottom with both her hands and shakes her head. At the doctor’s words, Tony nods seriously and gives him a genuine smile.
“I know you don’t, baby girl, but we’ll get you some medicine once we are done here, okay? Would you like some juice with it?” Tony asks, trying to distract Wanda as he gently parts her cheeks before inserting the thermometer. Wanda bursts into tears and tries to squirm out of it. Steve shushes her, stroking her hair comfortingly.
By the time Wanda joins them, Peter has got another pretty signature by his Daddy on his arm. Even though he is hurting a bit, he feels all right with all the praise he has got.
“If we break it to him the right way, then from my experience, it all goes quite smoothly. We’ll of course give him medication to help him settle before the surgery.” Stephen explains, and then adds. “But, if you guys freak, he will definitely freak. He needs you guys to be there for him.” The doctor stresses.
“Good boy, deep breaths now.” Stephen instructs when Peter doesn’t seem to freak due to the mask and presses it to his face properly. Gently, the doctor tilts the boy’s head back so that his airways are clear.
Wanda and Peter want to go to daycare together, like always, but Wanda is still sick and needs to rest at home.
Meanwhile, Tony has been recapping Wanda’s condition to the doctor from the last few days. The three of them are in Wanda’s room and Tony has got the girl on his lap while Stephen listens to the girl’s breathing with his stethoscope.
“Wan’a! Play, play! Dolls? Dolls!” He shrieks gleefully and bounces where he is sat on Tony’s lap.Tony shushes the boy and gently holds him still.
Peter is still recovering from the last bit of the anaesthesia and he has got a simple oxygen mask on to help while he dozes. His arm is now in a blue cast and propped up on a pillow.
“I feel icky, Daddy. I don’t wanna feel icky anymore. And I’m scared ‘cause Peter’s all by himself and I can’t take care of him and it’s my job!” It is a big, important job. She adds on at the end. “And I don’t want anymore doctors and my tummy feels funny.”
Peter’s breath hitches a little like he is going to cry, but then his eyes fall upon the huge machine. He is so stunned that he forgets to be upset.
“Without any complications, it takes an hour or two. And yes, he’ll be put under general anaesthesia, so he won’t feel anything nor remember anything when he wakes up.” Stephen explains calmly, paying close attention to how the Daddies seem to handle the news. “With Littles as young as Peter, we put them to sleep just using the gas, so it is painless and once they are asleep, we’ll prepare them. Peter won’t even know what hit him.” He smiles a little.
“Puppies, great choice.” Stephen smiles and takes the puppy one for himself. “Should Thomas get the same one?” He asks, gesturing to the nurse. Peter considers, but shakes his head. He wants to pick a new one.
“Good girl! Now, have your juice so they go down in your tummy properly.” Tony says and leans over to give Wanda’s forehead a kiss before handing her the sippy with apple juice. While Wanda drinks, Tony finds Care Bears on the TV and settles in to cuddle with the girl.
“He’s running a bit of a fever too. Nothing to panic about, but keep an eye on it.” The doctor reports to Steve before pulling Peter’s pants back up. “Come on sweetheart, you can sit up, here.” He reaches into his bag and pulls out a lollipop and a sparkly star sticker. “You were such a good boy, and you get a nice little surprise.”
“Sleep tight, my loves.” Tony says, leaning over to give both his Littles a kiss after Steve. After a few moments, both the Littles are promptly asleep, breathing and snoring softly. “Babe?” Tony asks quietly, looking up at Steve after watching the siblings sleep for a while.
“The magic doesn’t work if you eat, you see.” Thomas says to Peter, coming over with a little cup of medicine. It looks like cough syrup and Peter cringes. “I’ll pinch your nose so you can’t taste it, okay?” The nurse says and before Peter can really answer, his nostrils are pinched shut and he opens his mouth of reflex. Tipping the cup over into Peter’s mouth, the nurse closes the boy’s mouth and waits till he swallows before letting go. Peter coughs and shudders at the after taste and pouts hard at the nurse for tricking him.
“Wanda, you can turn yourself over or we can do it for you, okay?” Wanda contemplates her options and finally rolls over on her side, but curls up and hides her face.
“I'm tired, Daddy. Up, please?” Her request is not really just a result of being sleepy, but of wanting to cuddle with him nonstop.
“Feel better, sweetheart! We’ll put up the stickers together when you come back, yeah?” Maria says to Peter. The boy nods and waves with his good hand, then takes Pooh’s hand so that he is waving too while Maria leaves.
“… Wednesday.” Peter says after some considering. He knows it is Wednesday since they had mashed potatoes at daycare earlier, which they have every Wednesday.
“Are those vegan?” he asked by way of greeting and Toni nodded distractedly, pushing the huge plate in the center of the island top towards him.
Kamala’s parents had been a little more lenient about her two-day disappearance when Toni had personally driven her home and made up some bullshit story about having found their daughter in the wrong part of town after sneaking out to a party and drinking something dodgy.
Hope met her gaze fully, unflinchingly. “That day on the roof. When I punched you. Because I said you’d gotten my boyfriend arrested.” She shook her head. “That wasn’t true. Or fair.” She inhaled, held it, then released it in a gush. “I was...upset when he left. He...gets a call in the middle of the night from
as much as she was hurting. She’d been in that moment the kind of person that Captain America hated; a bully.
In other very important news, I have finally enlisted the aid of a Beta in the form of the ever patient, ever kind and ever wonderful Demigodscum, whom I owe my soul, my first born and undoubtedly my sanity to. Because she stepped in at a time when B&G and I were going through a rough patch, and let me tell you, she pulled me out of that rut with enthusiasm and patience and she is honestly THE ACTUAL BEST and the reason why I stopped waffling over this chapter. *showers her with love and golden confetti*
He nodded, letting her entertain the notion that he was going into this with his big boy pants, even though he’d made his mind up months ago.
Harley stirred then and sat up, rubbing at his eyes. When he saw them he pushed himself up, shoulders heavy and his eyes blinking through the gloom.
He could hear her laughter, the surprised, uncontrollable kind that would bring tears to the corners of her eyes and make her face all red.
There was a confused beat before T’Challa asked carefully, “What does the meatloaf represent in this scenario?”
“Static,” she stuttered, convincing no one as she started walking away towards one of her screens and tapping something - it might even have just been nonsense - onto the holographic keyboard beneath. She cleared her throat, then continued in a clearer voice, “We’ll have to monitor...function and efficiency for a while. Durability too. We’ll do some tests over the next few weeks just to make sure your body’s adapting. I’ll have the list of exercises and tests sent to you so that FRIDAY or— or one of the others can see how well you fare.”
. But-” He gestured at the rest of them, all immersed in their own heads, their own problems. “-we’re not good at talking. We never were.” He chuckled and it was sad. “We’ve all got a shit ton of baggage. It would’ve taken a miracle to get us to talk.”
she stepped through the doors, turning away just as the door slid shut like a guillotine, cutting off the image of his profile as he stared at the ground looking lost.
Ross caught sight of a stern-faced Natasha over Toni’s shoulder. His already-red face turned an even more brilliant shade of vermillion and he pointed an accusatory finger at her, taking a step closer.
The others, who had been torn between Toni and the evidently important exchange taking place behind them, were looking both irritated at the interruption and anxious, Wanda’s eyes flickering between red and grey-brown.
Then she dipped her head - a gesture of respect, concession or finality, Toni wasn’t sure - and moved towards the sliding doors and back into the operating theatre.
Guilt twinged its way up her spine but Natasha would’ve told her to deal with it because when you were faced with an unknown variable, sometimes you had to
“Thank you, sir. The feeling’s mutual.” She paused for a brief moment then continued, “You’ve not met them yet? Ms. Stark’s interns? We’re not sure what they’re actually interning as, though. Usually there’s another boy with them, Peter Parker. Not sure where he is today. And Princess Shuri is usually with them whenever she’s in town.”
Bucky recalled the way Steve’s throat had worked around his next words. “December sixteenth, nineteen-ninety-one.” His fists had shook by his side. “The day Toni lost her parents. The day…”
So Bucky had stayed with Steve, broad, larger than life Steve who looked as small as that kid from Brooklyn in his guilt and in his grief.
“Physical pain is brief,” he finally said. “It does not linger for me. The Mind Stone guaranteed that.
The words were caught in her throat, a dozen of them warring for dominance, but ultimately her lips remained stubbornly shut.
And apparently that was that. Within minutes they were outside in a large stone courtyard, the shadow of the cliffside their only protection against the midday sun. Steve had trained in all sorts of environments but he had to hand it to the Wakandans and to equatorial nations in general, because his lily-white ass was going to have a hard time in this stifling humidity.
with, he reached out with one hand and carefully pushed it shut with what she assumed was magic considering he was standing about a foot away and his hand never came into contact with it.
“The Charlie Spencer Relief Efforts. A joint project between Toni and Miriam Spencer. Took a while to get her to answer any of Toni’s calls but when she did…” She let that speak for itself.
She balanced the arm on the tips of her middle finger, one in the center of his palm and the other just above the elbow.
He turned around again and Helen Cho stood tall and prim on the other side of the glass, her mask lowered around her chin.
She said something bashfully funny and people laughed. Her eyes widened at the laughter and for a fraction of a second Steve saw someone he knew intimately well, a woman who hadn’t intended to be funny but was pleasantly surprised by the outcome. He’d seen that expression before and oh god, it hurt.
There was a tense silence in the long moments that followed, anxiety - and some confusion - emanating from the observation room in waves. Even the bots had ceased playing and were watching their creator with concerned beeps and soft coos. Bucky couldn’t bring himself to look but Steve, he knew, was probably clenching and unclenching his fists, unblinking.
Once Laura had deemed it safe to remove the cast and the plaster around her chest, Toni had proceeded to fix the pick-up truck within the span of thirty minutes. Then she broke it apart and re-did it from the bones up. She used a few components of the spare arc reactor she’d brought with her to give it an almost unlimited power supply. Couldn’t have a truck that may or may not take off into the air this part of town, hence the
Nat offered a small smile and rested her elbows on her knees, her hands clasped in the space between.
“Clint is,” she began, then cut herself off. “I dunno about Clint. He’s...going through some stuff.”
“What do you think, FRIDAY?” she asked after a while, pulling up a 3D rendition of one of his portals that, from what she could tell, seemed to connect to some vague point between the Himalayas and the Andromeda Galaxy.
Toni sped to the nearest officer who looked to be in charge and though he gave her a double take, he immediately informed her of the damage so far. People in black suits. They’d blown up a truck carrying diesel right outside the building to create a diversion as they swarmed in the front entrance. When she took to the air she could already see fire trucks coming down from all four sides.
She thought back to months ago, when Nat had first come back and brought up the phone and Vision - wonderful, incredible Vision - had calmly but ruthlessly struck that idea down.
Toni met Kamala Khan on a Friday night a few weeks after the HYDRA incident, when one Harley Keener turned up on her doorstep with the girl literally hanging off his arm.
So they sat there in the quiet, Steve struggling in his own way, Toni reticent as she remained where she was, refusing to tear her eyes away from the tablet where the rendering of Barnes’ arm floated lazily.
, no, that’s not-” she rushed to say, holding both hands up. “No one’s said anything like that. They’re all awesome and they don’t treat me like I’m dumb or anything. It’s just…” The nibbling was back again and she averted her gaze. “It’s just that...sometimes I don’t know…sometimes I don’t understand the things that Shuri and Harley and Peter talk about,” she murmured, her voice getting softer and softer and her shoulders rising up around her ears, like she was trying to make herself smaller. If she could, Toni had a feeling she would have. “I mean...they’re really smart n’ they can build all these cool things and they understand all these programming languages and I...can’t.” There was a miserable blush emanating from beneath the neckline of her t-shirt and going all the way up to her hairline. “They’re awesome and I’m barely scraping a B+ in
“I try. These things, things that people build. Tech and structures and stuff. They’re easy to fix. It’s what I was raised to do. It’s what I’m actually
Across the room Natasha saw Coulson lean forward in his seat, Melinda May and Daisy Johnson beside him. It still gave her such a kick whenever she saw him. They hadn’t spoken properly yet, just briefly in passing when he helped get her another alias. But they’d need to remedy that soon. As if he’d heard her, he turned and met her gaze, holding it.
for something, anything. But he continued to walk, letting his legs drag him in the same old circle he’d walked countless times before.
Hell, the girl had already started literally hanging from the ceilings of the training gymnasiums, using her super bendy arms to swing across the room like Peter did with his webs.
“Ellis has announced the pardons, hasn’t he?” she asked, her eyes catching the brief flash of a falling star.
“What times’ it?” he asked around a yawn and Toni sniffed, space and starlight retreating from the edges of her vision until-
“Pot and kettle,” she retorted, but stood as well, hesitating for a few beats before making her way to the door in spite of the strangest feeling like she was forgetting something-
Him and Steve, the last two people to see Stark in a Siberian bunker, on her hands and knees and her face twisted in pain and betrayal.
She felt the weight of Vision and Nat’s gaze on her but didn’t acknowledge it and turned her attention back to Coulson.
“It wasn’t all him,” KAREN replied with a note of amusement. “He has a friend; Ned Leeds. He’s a good kid. You’d like him.”
He could still recall the way the it had come out, the hopeless honesty as the words spilled from Steve’s mouth, wretched and so, so sorry.
So I'm back with another chapter! Thank you guys so much for your patience and your kind words and encouragement from the previous chapter, especially since y'all knew I was struggling to get this chapter out. Even now, I'm a little hesitant about posting because half of it was written about two months ago and the other half only finished today, so I've never asked this before, but please be gentle with me on this one?
a system of accountability, some more extreme - frighteningly so - than others. It may not have made international news but FRIDAY and Vision had brought up the stats of what were essentially lynchings and witch hunts of enhanced individuals that had occurred in recent years across the globe. That was something they were going to have to bring up with the Council. Not today but some time during the week-long discussion.
“Now, you are feeling defensive.” She boredly examined her nails. “And you are deflecting. You. Are.
Licking his dry lips, he met Shuri’s eyes, pleased that her earlier wariness had worn off and was now replaced with genuine curiosity.
, but she was able to give it the finger for the most part. Because even if she didn’t trust Natasha not to go back to Steve, go back to Clint, she at least trusted T’Challa’s palace had excellent pest control
Toni likened Coulson’s interrogation of the HYDRA agent to a polished stone that cut a violently-rushing stream in half, right now the middle. He was consistent, patient to the point of frustration, and all the while that calm slope of a smile never left his features.
I'm honestly blown away by the response I got to the first chapter. Thank you so, so much for every comment, every kudos and every bookmark. Each one made me increasingly excited that people were enjoying the story or found something in it that intrigued them. So thank you to everyone who took the time to read the first chapter and leave a response and I hope you all enjoy the second chapter as well :)
On screen, Toni was a vision. Steve had never seen anything more beautiful than he did in that moment when she uttered one strong, breathless word.
“You mind hooking him up for me, Vis?” Stark asked, stuffing the colorful wires back into the machine. “I’ve almost got this sorted.”
Toni didn’t know what time it was when Laura finally found her. Today had been a hard day. She’d held Nathaniel a little longer after feeding him; she’d braided Lila’s hair only to take it out and re-do it four more times; she’d helped Cooper put together three separate pieces of art, all the while avoiding his knowing gaze, and she’d forced Laura into a seat and made dinner.
She’d burned the first batch of fried rice and stood in front of the stove silently panicking before Laura took pity on her and helped her prepare it again from scratch, bumping their hips together as they worked. Laura herself had been acting a little off all week but Toni didn’t push; she’d tell her if and when she needed to bring it up.
“Why do you like him?” she reverted, keeping her tone light and curious. Because evidently Shuri had a soft spot for Barnes and if she was going to be spending copious amounts of time with him in the future she deserved to know at least one thing about him that wasn’t the Winter Soldier.
— expression on his face melted into something fond and hopeful yet still self-conscious, if the way he kept opening his mouth to speak then closing it again was anything to go by.
T’Challa opened his palms in front of him. “It is your technology. Only you can be the judge of whether or not he is deserving. But even if he is not,” he reached out and touched her wrist, barely there, “perhaps you are.”
He refrained from mentioning anything about the million and one times she must’ve seen it up close with Captain America and even Black Widow.
Stark stared back at him, something old and weary in the circles under her eyes and the trembling of her fingers that she seemed desperate to hide. But he saw them.
“Just because you can take a hit doesn’t mean you should,” Okoye stated flatly, pointing the head of her staff at him.
not Clint. A soft chuckle escaped her and she reached out to gently extract a lock of dark hair from Toni’s open, quietly snoring mouth. She recalled coming to Toni’s room to work out battle plans after putting Nate to sleep but didn’t remember closing her eyes for a brief respite. She was grateful the kids didn’t have school in the morning.
“I would be honored to assist in whatever manner I am able,” Vision declared solemnly and Toni smiled.
Gesturing for her to continue, she settled into a more comfortable position on the floor, legs pretzled and her expression patient.
. She saw a man stripped bare, a man defeated yet not. She saw a mirror and a reflection. She saw someone who was something and became something else, something new.
“Only the best for my Rhodey,” Toni drawled from where she was sitting cross-legged in her chair. “Sure you can’t sneak away from your royal duties for a bit to sit in on the surgery?”
That was convenient. Kill two birds with one stone. Remove the objects of Toni Stark’s distress at the same time and make it seem like courtesy. Steve could’ve shown him but he knew his friend well enough to know Steve wouldn’t leave his side just yet.
“Bring the rest of the world onto your side. The final UN hearing next week. If you can convince the Council, you’ll get your pardons.” He spread his hands wide in front of him, as if he wasn’t asking her carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. “That’s all.”
The word echoed in his ears and through his body and in all the parts of himself that had hollowed since leaving Toni in that godforsaken bunker.
Toni recalled many a situation where Natasha’s singular brand of interrogation was required. She recalled the way Nat would smile, the way her voice would soften with an almost beguiling warmth as she made her marks feel victimized and wounded enough that
for some kids. They breeze through, they do well in everything, they fight tooth and nail against one another and they succeed and become engineers and astronauts and lawyers and entrepreneurs and shit. Congrats to them. They earned it.” Just as Kamala started to frown, looking unsteady and a little hurt, Toni continued. “But not all kids are like that. Not all of them are brilliant all across the board. They can’t do sports or new languages blow their minds or all they wanna do is play lacrosse and video games or garden. Because that’s what they enjoy and that’s what they’re good at so they put their heart into it. Or maybe they can’t put their heart into anything because they haven’t
He sobered as he surveyed Kamala and Toni’s heart went out to him because sixteen-year-olds shouldn’t have to be driving across the state just to save girls whose eyeballs were bleeding and their bodies literally falling apart.
“The temperature has not fluctuated since we first arrived, Toni,” Vision uttered. “You are exhibiting signs of stress.”
They filed out of the room, Toni coming up last after T’Challa. As the door hissed closed behind her she heard it, like an icy breath on the back of her neck.
“The phone. For getting this to me. Couldn’t have been easy. Didn’t think T’Challa would’ve been very accommodating after you used your bites on him.”
But Stephen continued on, unaffected, yet entirely attuned to the extra level of tension in the room. “She believed that you and I were similar to the extent of our abilities. The execution is different, as I’m sure you’re already aware, but I believe with time and study, we’ll be able to get you back on the field, where you belong.” He smiled and it was kind and Toni was immensely grateful for it. “You’re quite the fighter. I look forward to working with you.”
“Because she’d just seen your best friend murder her parents in cold blood,” he said slowly. Then chuckled, a mirthless and ugly sound. “And you knew all this while.
“I walk.” The boy says with a grin and heads down the hall and goes to sit down at the top of the stairs to slide down them. With his pull-up on, it does not hurt and is quite fun. When Steve and Peter have disappeared down the stairs, Tony gives Wanda a good squish in his arms.
“Nothing like that, don’t worry.” Tony smiles and makes a hand gesture to show that there is no need to worry. “I just- Do you think this was the worst of it? You know- the actual surgery or are we really in for it when we bring him home?”
Peter smiles shyly at that and slips down from his seat to pad over to his Daddy, flopping over his lap and hugs him as much as he can with his cast arm.
“It's okay, sweetheart, Daddy’s here. Listen to my voice, baby boy. You're gonna be okay. Shhh, I'm right here.” Tony cannot keep his voice from breaking.
“All done, Daddy. I did it!” She looks very proud of herself, if a little shaken up. “I did it all by myself. Because I'm big. I'm so big and I can do it. I can help Peter do it too!”
“You comfy, baby? Maybe we can patch up Pooh once we’ve got you sorted out, hm?” Tony says to Peter, brushing his hair back. Peter looks a little sceptical still and side eyes the nurse who’s fixing his IV. “Hey, is it okay if the nice doctor takes a look at you? He’ll be gentle, right?” Tony says, turning to Stephen.
“If you’re gonna sleep with us, I’d better get the baby to start winding down.” Steve says. “Let’s go eat and then you’re going night night, okay?” He taps Peter on the nose. “We can read a story first.”
“I’m sure the doctors will give you some tips on how to help Peter once he is discharged. And if you ever need help, then I’m just a phone call away.” He offers with a smile, patting Tony’s shoulder to comfort him.
“Okay, Daddy. Go see him now.” Wanda nods. Steve motions for Tony to come as they follow Stephen to recovery. The doctor pushes one of the double doors open and lets the family in.
“She’s wound up and overtired and a bit delirious.” Stephen tells Tony. “She needs a nap.” Tony nods in agreement and chooses to ignore Wanda’s burning questions for now. Taking the medication and getting some rest is far more important.
Peter nods a little before singing the alphabet. He makes a few mistakes, but is quick to correct them. Stephen nods with a smile. The doctor asks the boy a few more questions about any pain and discomfort and then gets a quick look at the broken arm. At least the Central’s paramedics did a good job with the temporary air cast.
“Yes, we’ll get you taken care of, little love.” Stella smiles. With Peter in the private ambulance with Steve and the paramedics, Tony follows them in the car and they all head to Greenwood hospital instead.
Peter continues to cry for a while until his Daddy’s presence and comfort calms him down. But, he continues sniffling and whimpering for a while longer.
“Yeah, then we’ll wait.” Steve smiles, taking a fresh wipe for one last clean before helping Wanda step into the princess pull-up. “Hm, what is it, princess?” He asks, patting the girl’s padded bum.
“Good girl!” Tony praises when Wanda swallows down her pills and then hands her the sippy cup to wash them down.
“You’re a silly princess, huh? You can play with blocks in just a minute, but I’m sure you’d like to be wearing something first.” He gets him into a new diaper first, then gets his pyjamas on, finally sitting him up. “There you go, sweetie. All ready. Wanna go play now?”
“Hmm! Sleepy beauty.” Peter specifies and holds onto his hooded towel with his little hands. When he gets set down, Peter is quickly distracted by his blocks on the floor and stays there instead of laying down on his bed to let Papa dress him like always. Steve turns around and laughs, shaking his head and picking the baby back up to put him on the bed.
“Night night.” He says obediently and waves at his sister and Daddy. He knows that this is not the finale good night though, as his family usually give him a proper kiss and good night when he is tucked into his bed. Wanda stays quiet and watches them leave, blowing a brief kiss to her brother first. She does not much feel like eating and slides off the chair and onto the floor instead so she can play pretend. When Steve has left with Peter, Tony turns to Wanda to answer her, but frowns a little when he sees that she had slid down on the floor.
While Wanda is gone, Steve gets the blanket and clothes in the washer along with some matching laundry. He starts a cycle just in time for Wanda to return.
“Yes, this is just our secret.” Well, he will tell Tony about it once the Littles are out of earshot. “And then we’ll go find your brother. Which design do you want?” He asks, going over to the cupboard where they keep the paddings. Most of it is Peter’s and has light blue and purple galaxy designs. But, they also have a few princess themed ones when Peter wants to wear those and for the times Wanda needs some just-in-case padding too.
A few hours later, Steve arrives home with groceries and heads right to the kitchen to put the popsicles in the freezer before they melt.
“Me too. I was so scared when they told us he hit his head, I...” Steve trails off. “Sorry. I just hate seeing him in pain. But, he’s so little and sometimes I know there’s nothing I can do to stop the hurt.”
While his Dada is getting him a bottle, Peter pushes himself up into a sitting position after some struggle. He is sat in his bed with everything he needs close. He has got Pooh, a few books on his nightstand, a bottle of juice mixed with some water and his pain medication that he was prescribed by Stephen to deal with the pain after the surgery. Peter looks down at his cast arm, which is tucked up to his chest in a sling. He really hates the thing, because it makes him so wobbly on his feet and limits his movements so much. He cannot even play with duplo legos properly.
“Sit down, baby.” Steve tells Wanda as he wipes off Peter’s face gently. “If you finish eating you can listen to the story too.” Wanda gets on the chair, but sits on her knees instead of doing it properly, and drinks her juice absentmindedly. Steve gets up to get Peter his bottle.
“Princess!” Princesses make everything better, even when she is crying and hates herself. “I want princess, Papa. Ariel. She’s a mermaid. In the water. Splashing.” She waves her hand to demonstrate. Suddenly she gets an idea. “Papa? Can we swim?” She loves going to the pool with Peter.
“You won’t have nightmares, baby. You’ll nap with me, remember? I’ll keep you safe.” Tony assures, bouncing Wanda in his arm again. When the girl mentions Stephen again, Tony cannot help but laugh softly. “Kitten, we can’t stay awake forever. We need sleep to let the body rest and recharge, otherwise we’ll get grumpy and sad. Do you wanna be grumpy and sad?” Tony asks.
Tony snorts quietly in response and leans down to kiss Steve again. When he pulls back, he has a glint in his eyes.
“Hey, hey.” Tony says, coming over to Steve to cup his cheeks. “He’s all right now and he’ll be just fine, just like the doctor told us. We’re not bad caregivers, we’re not.” He adds, perhaps more for himself than his husband. He has been having some awful thoughts about how he has failed to protect Peter ever since they got the phone call from Maria at daycare.

“Oh, thank God.” Tony sighs heavily and sets Wanda down so that she can run over to Steve to greet him. “Wanda’s been super good for Vis and she made a brilliant card for her hurt brother.” Tony adds, smiling at how Wanda squeals when Steve picks her up.
“Stephen told us that he's going to have to have surgery.” Steve says, lowering his voice a little. “I guess I do have some more questions. Is he going to be in pain afterwards? When can he go to daycare again? How long do you think he'll have to be here? It's not that things aren't really nice, but he wants to go home.”
“Oh God…” Tony tries to think. “I guess I’d better call around and see if we can get a babysitter for her. I think she’ll be too upset if we bring her to the hospital.” Wanda is a sensitive soul and she will definitely be upset to see her beloved little brother in this condition. “She must be terrified. Maybe Vis can take her for a little while. Steve, can you call and ask? We’re gonna read a little story here.” He opens up the book and kisses Peter’s cheek. “Alright baby boy, let’s read your story. Is Pooh going to listen too?”
“Hi.” Peter replies a little shyly. It’s not that he doesn’t like the doctor because all the memories from being at his clinic aren’t exactly pleasant, but at the same time Peter’s eager to finally have someone to play with. Before he can ask Stephen though, his Papa comes over and ruins everything.
Once the pancakes are ready, Tony brings them to the living room and eats with the girl, helping her cut up her pancakes as well as feeds her a couple mouthfuls when she does not want to use the fork herself. Wanda is content with watching Barbie movies and suck her thumb for a few hours, but then she starts to feel hot and icky after a bit. Fevers do tend to flare up a bit in the afternoon, and it certainly was for her. She climbs onto Tony’s lap and whispers.
Wanda sniffles and tries to compose herself. She is supposed to be a princess, a little lady. She sits up straight and through her tears she whispers.
“Come here.” Tony smiles, bending down a bit to hook his hands under Wanda’s armpits and lifting her up. He groans a little playfully and settles the girl on his hip. “Should we bring a fluffy friend and story to bed?” Tony suggests, wanting to make a stop in Wanda’s room before they get to the big bed in his and Steve’s room.
“Yeah, you sure were. And now you get to rest and do whatever you want while you get better.” Steve promises him. “Are you still sleepy, honey? If you need to keep on sleeping you can. You did have a very exciting morning.”
He breathed in slowly through his nose, another unnecessary human gesture. “There is...something I must speak with you about. A proposition of sorts.”
Like a jagged, open wound that had been there so long that the pain had become bearable, only for someone to rub salt into the raw and bloody flesh and remind him once again of his perpetual torture.
Pulling back, Toni looked at her, this woman, this strong, hardy woman with so much heart. She could see why Clint loved her. She was so terribly easy to love.
So things weren’t great between her and Rhodey. But they were on a level of understanding bolstered by her contributions towards the Accords and by the fact that she could have gone to Steve but, this time at least, had chosen to come to Toni and work things out as best she could from a place where she could actually make a difference.
Then he rolled his sleeves up just below his elbows and held both his hands out, palms softly glowing a light gold. Toni chose to remain silent, still a little bewildered by the entire exchange, and just stood there with Cloak wrapped almost reassuringly around her.
He watched her and Toni tried not to squirm under his heavy stare. Because she knew that look, that tension before the unleashing of something the other party wasn’t sure she was going to like to hear.
She saw planets and beings. She saw empires rise and fall. She saw growth and death in a cycle of cold and heat.
“Just remember what I said,” he murmured under his breath. “Do not compromise yourself. Not for me, not for anyone. I’ll be right here when you’re done.”
The door hissed open again at her proximity, making her jump, and she released a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.
were the only one who asked about my work and actually cared what I had to say. I’m glad we kept in touch. A few bumps in the road but...we’ve done quite well so far, haven’t we?”
“I don’t mind,” he’d informed her breathlessly, his forehead dripping with sweat as he came and sat down next to her. “You’re…” He winced guiltily. “I’d rather you than Toni. She’s too...
At some point during the first month of his stay, Steve had graduated from training with Shuri to letting - most of the time it didn't feel like he’d had much of a choice - the Dora Milaje train
Sam shook his head. “When we first came here, when Barnes was first going under, we all had a small talk. Wanda knows something went down, something bad. Said she felt it from you when you saved us from the Raft. She thought maybe Stark had hurt you somehow-”
“I know,” he admitted. It wasn’t the first time they’d had this conversation. And it wouldn’t be the last. But Sam was unfailingly, almost indiscriminately patient with him. And Steve felt like a hell of a jerk for putting that kind of pressure on a man who had been nothing by loyal to him.
One of Laura’s kitchen cabinets was uneven so she took the door out, sandpapered it down and refitted it during the hours of three and four in the morning. Lila had come down for a glass of water, seen Toni work, and quietly sat down at the kitchen table to watch until she’d fallen asleep again, head cushioned on her crossed forearms.
In her own reserved and prickly fashion, Toni liked Kamala a lot, adored her in a way that almost scared her, just like it did with Peter and Harley. She was yet another kid to worm her way into her rusty little heart and Toni wouldn’t deny that she felt a sometimes extreme level of overprotectiveness when it came to those kids. It was the same kind of feeling that she had with Laura and her children, and what had made her install an overkill of defence mechanisms on the farm just to keep them safe and call to check in on them at least three times a week. It was the same kind of feeling that made her give Harley a device akin to a panic button as well as a direct line to JARVIS when he was around, and later to FRIDAY, which was how he’d found his way to the Compound in the first place. It was the same kind of feeling that convinced Toni to part with RIA and give her to Peter.
