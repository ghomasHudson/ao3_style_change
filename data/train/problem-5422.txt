? No, he shouldn't let his mind playing tricks with him again, even if Tony felt all of his insecurities growing in his chest all at once, he shouldn't be jealous. Steve never really liked him, no even as a teammate.
Tony agrees following Steve out of the security room. They walk with a rush through the corridors, at some point, Tony has to hold Steve's wrist to slow him down, after all, they don't want to call attention to themselves. They need to act like everyone else, like they are part of the place.
He lost his train of thoughts when a group of friends enters the cafeteria talking too loud, after they gained a few angry stares of the other costumes, Tony included, they sat down and talked in a tone of voice more acceptable.
Tony looks back to where Steve is standing with a towel on his good hand drying his wet hair and the other hand holding the TV control.
Steve opened his mouth to say something. Anything. But the words never made it out. Was it really happening? It all seems a dream, a really really good dream, the best he has had in ages. Steve’s mouth was slightly opened in surprise as he watched Natasha walking away.
"Fuck." Tony clenches his fist on the table. "You think they expected that someone would steal it? It doesn't make much sense."
He snapped his head back to the table where his phone was buzzing but before he could reach for it, the call turned off. If it was Natasha… The phone starts to buzz again and Sam’s name pops on the screen.
A door opens in the corridor, and Howard Stark appears, he looks to both sides of the place. Quickly Steve turns his back to him, but it doesn't seem work, well apparently the odds were not in his favor today.
When Tony steps out of the Avengers' compound that day, after Ultron, Steve said he would miss him, and he really did, but he knew that Tony was okay, the billionaire visited them once in a while. Everything was fine, and then the accords happened. It took away their peace, and that stupid secret made him fight against Tony, Tony might have forgiven him, but Steve knew that he wasn't ready to forgive himself for that damage that he caused to Tony.
, he thought. Tony turns on the radio and Vehicle by The Ides of March fills the car for the rest of the trip.
“I’m sorry to interrupt, can I take a few photos, please?” Steve asked when he approached the group. Grateful when all of them nodded.
"No shit, Sherlock. Have you just discovered it for himself now? 'Cause I know about it a long time ago" She says extending the word
Steve can't do anything, but smiles. Everything becomes a joke to Tony. The way the genius plays with the words was just fascinating to Steve, it used to annoy Steve in the beginning, when they first met, but not anymore. Steve had learned to love and appreciate those flaws of the billionaire's. Always laughing in the face of danger, it drives Steve crazy with concern.
Steve’s hands go further to his calf, massaging his outlined muscles there, which makes Bucky unwittingly pull his legs up. Bucky held Steve’s hand when the blond finally reaches the sides of his thigh.
Tony should've known, or at least, guessed. Peggy Carter, the same woman he grew up with was the woman that Steve always loved, that he still loves, actually, and Steve, ironically, is the man he loves. Tony narrows his eyes. That's confused.
Natasha chuckles. Of course, Tony would replace them, he always did, he knew it and so did Natasha. He wasn't so obvious, was he? What if... she knows about it? A shiver passes through Tony's spine.
“I’m posting on Instagram, any suggestion on what should I write?” Steve turned his head to stare at Bucky. Bucky leaned back with his hand on his chin, thinking.
They trusted the shadows to hide their hands intertwined while they walk on the sand barefoot. The salty smell of the sea filling their nostrils, the soft wind hitting their face and messing their hair, it was a little cold, but the wine they had, helped to keep them warm for now.
He didn't even give a step forward, someone hits his head strongly. Tony remembers to take his hand to the place where he was hit and come back with his fingers wet on his own blood before he fell unconscious.
"Ugh. Ahn, okay, then." Tony stutters. "But we're going to get them back anyway, I like mines, don't you like Captain America suits?" The billionaire lifts a brow and Steve chuckles. "We need to shop and I'm sure none of these stores accepts a credit card here, because we only have that money."Steve nods.
And Tony knows that everything will be alright. His body is just overreacting, he should have known by now that his body betrays him, he is not dying, and he won't go crazy, he should not trust his body. He feels his eyes heavy, his heartbeats slowly matching with Steve's as well as his breathe. It's okay, his mind repeats like a tranquilizer, like a lullaby to himself. It's okay. It's okay.
Steve raises his head to look deep in those brown eyes. There was desire in his blues ones, Tony could see it clearly, and he was feeling so attracted to those blue eyes, both have waited so long for this, for any correspondent feeling from each other's part and now they have it. Steve didn't move, his lips were parted and his breath was warm. Tony felt an invisible thread pushing him towards the blond, he couldn't resist it anymore.
Peggy stands there switching her gaze between Tony and Steve, a frown between her brows, then she narrows her eyes.
She opens it taking out the letter along with two Pym particles. She looks curiously to the red things on her hands, then she put the particles aside on the bed and get the yellowed paper again, she opened the letter.
Wanda was rambling something about the Christmas party thrown by SHIELD at the end of the year when Clint entered and she changed the subject to the man who worked in finances and Natasha considered as a sibling. He looked a nice person, Steve thought, but well everyone seemed nice so far. Steve’s hopes of fitting into this place were growing.
"That's what I'd like someone does to me," the brunet muttered. "Are you alright?" Steve glances at his hands and nods affirmatively while his breath stabilizes. "You never mention it for anyone's in the team, we could've helped you."
“This photoshoot has been delayed for quite a while now. These photos should have been done weeks ago. And I just got a new photographer. Tony has to be back in Manhattan in two days for this photoshoot,” Natasha exhaled. “He signed the contract. He’s aware of the consequences of breaking it.” Steve listened to the heels clicking on the floor again.
Tony sets the first aid kit on the table in the hotel room, with some difficulty Steve takes off Tony's sweatshirt that he was wearing to not stand suspects on the hotel staff with his blood shoulder. First, he got a scissor to cut Steve's shirt, there is no way he'd raise that arm. Steve stays silently while Tony gets rid of the bloodied shirt, he pours alcohol on a towel to clean the wound.
Steve doesn’t have much experience in relationships. He didn’t know if people usually talk about their past lovers. When he was in college, he used to hang up, rarely, making out with some guys, but nothing really serious. It was generally one nightstand, which was also something Steve could not blame on Tony for his nightstands or exes, those are a lot. However, Steve was done with being only a nightstand. He needed to know if what they had was serious. He didn’t want to get attached to the model if it means nothing else for him.
There is nothing unusual on his way back to the hotel, he keeps an attentive look around himself, but he does not seem to be followed, actually, he expected Hydra to back off for a while given the fire. There are a lot of tourists in front of the hotel, speaking several languages, Tony supposes that they are waiting for a mean of transportation for tourists attractions, which is none of his business.
“SHIELD Clothing is a great opportunity, Stevie. I really hope Natasha calls you,” Bucky wished, and Steve knew he was sincere.
"I don't think I'm going anywhere, Tony." Steve raises his arm to show his time GPS completely destroyed due to the impact of the explosion when he was thrown backward.
Steve counted three models wearing sexy lingerie. They were in the makeup process. Steve looked to the scenario in front of him. There were flowers coming down the ceiling on the wall, where a red sofa was in the middle to make everything look sexy and desirable. A provocative collection to praise women’s bodies. Steve was happy for the fact he was gay. From the corner of his eyes, he could see two men talking next to the window, one of them had a cigarette between his fingers, and the crotch on his pants showed clearly that he was turned on by the view of the almost naked models. Disgusting.
He heard footsteps in the corner and quickly opened one of the doors on the vast hallway and got in. There were archives spread over the table, but Tony didn't explore the room, Steve was his priority now and he needed to focus on that. A couple of agents pass, they did not look rush or alarmed, but as they were doing their usual patrol. As soon as they turned the corner, Tony swiped out of the room, walking swiftly in the opposite way.
They talked about Tony's PTSD and Steve's nightmares related to World War II. Germany and Siberia were also a topic of conversation, in fact, a relevant and enlightening one. Those hours on the road were gold and allowed them to know each other deeply, make them exposing their fears and insecurities. It was a precious moment that they've shared and Steve caught himself craving for more moments like this, because he loves to hear Tony talking and laughing carefreely, also the fact that Tony had opened up to him and trusted him was curious, but perfectly pleasant. Steve's instincts were stronger than ever to protect Tony no matter what, they always have been, though. Their jobs are quite dangerous, he knew it very well, and he also cared so much about Tony wellbeing that he wouldn't measure efforts to make sure the brunet was safe. Even though, the brunet wouldn't enjoy the idea of protection very much, not if it meant Steve putting himself in risk because of him, but like Natasha said once, they both are too stubborn.
“How about ‘we found love in each other’ plus sparkly heart and swan emoji?” Bucky offered. Steve snorted.
Hey, everyone! I forgot to update last week and I didn't want to mess the schedule, so I decided I'd only update this Thursday. Turns out, I'm reading a really good book and I totally forgot again. Anyway, it's Friday, so here it is.
“Thanksgiving is tomorrow,” Steve said, uncertain of how to invite him. Damn, he just needed to ask, it’s a simple task.
“I’m Natasha Romanoff,” Natasha extended a hand to Steve that he promptly accepted. “Director of Marketing, and also recruitment of SHIELD Clothing. Your friend James talked about your last time I went checking on the new advertising campaign,” Natasha explained.
Steve follows Tony to the middle of nowhere, they rented a car and made a 6 hours trip to Malibu carrying the briefcase containing the Tesseract with them, Tony just dragged him there without explaining much.
"Well, we sure need to go back. I thought that... Maybe, we can get some information about Hank." Steve shrugs. "Also, we can't wear those clothes, anyway." The blond is smiling gently to him.
Breakfast is eerily quiet. Sometimes, Steve asks him if he knows what to do if the situation got complicated, he answers calmly each question. Tony knows that Steve is doing it to keep him away from his own toxic, self-loathing and destructive thoughts. He can't blame the blond for an attempt, also it's a good way to repass the steps on his mind.
Outside, the wind was cold and filled with the salty smell from the sea, messing his hair. A night of reflection sat in a pub seemed to bloom his senses, because the streetlights seemed too bright, he felt absent-minded, incapable of focus on anything. The streets to the apartment were quiet, the only noise came from the few cars passing in the avenue that they have been earlier.
Steve didn’t like drinking. The effect alcohol had on people, Steve didn’t like the results. Nothing good could come from drinking. Of course, he had experienced it when he was a teenager and just wanted to have fun. But after seeing his mother’s look when he got drunk at home one day, Steve just stopped it. He couldn’t do it to her, not again. Since then, he only drank champagne on some occasions, which was rare.
Steve lets go of Tony’s hands to catch his camera on the ground, cleaning the dirt with the back of his sweater. Tony, on the other hand, takes the light bulb from Wanda’s hand, rolling it in his hands.
When he sits, Steve pulls him closer to his chest right away. Tony snuggles against him. Steve's body is warm and comfortable, the physical contact makes him feel real. Touch. Touch something, an object hot or cold could be capable to bring the sense of reality when he felt these anxiety attacks. He just needs to hold this object in his hands tight, feels its form and flaws under his fingers, its heat, to make sure that it is real, to bring him back to think straight. Right now, Steve's warm skin was the thing bringing him back slowly to reality.
Bruce was waiting on their getaway Quinjet, in case they requested the Hulk or needed to get the hell out of that stupid event as fast as possible if things get too complicated. There’s still Thor, dressed as a waiter, smiling widely as locating possible threats and their targets in the hall. However, the main target is also Steve’s target due to the fact that the leader of this traffic stuff is talking cheerily with Tony.
Steve feels a growl coming up in his throat, he wanted to correct the brunet, says that he had already chosen. Although, Tony didn't. But he couldn't say it, he couldn't do it.
"Well, the owner and her niece. The movie's name is Pound, it seems nice for what they talked about." Steve nods. "Did you know that owner's niece has a crush on you? She asked me if you were single." Steve lifts his brows surprised, and Tony is smiling as if he thinks it is an amusing situation, which it is.
"It's not a big deal." Steve shrugs. "I-It's just... It was weird seeing her again after all these years. It doesn't seem right."
Tony looks around, the road is empty and he is surrounded by giant warehouses, an endless amount of warehouses with some factories throwing out smoke in the air. That's the fucking end of the world, you just bring someone to this kind of place for only one reason: to kill and hide the body. A shiver passes through his spine. He fears for Steve.
“It’s a personal issue, Nat,” Pepper insisted. “He’s been through a lot of things right now.” Natasha sighed longly.
Tony crawls until he reaches the wall next to him, leaning on it for some support to get on his feet. He grunts with every move, holding his stomach and spitting an amount of blood. He stares to the corner in front of his, it's just a few steps he says to himself trying to gather his forces to makes his way back home, each step sending a painful wave on his body, he feels like he's going to faint every second, but he convinces himself that he can make it. He's an Avenger, after all, he fought Thanos, a bunch of robots, a Chitaury army, he certainly can make a few steps forward.
“He has the fame of being a playboy, but he’s not like this, Steve. When he gives out his heart, that’s for real,” she sits down. “I see that you both care about each other. He deserves to be happy, Steve.”
They found a clothing store two streets ahead of the cafeteria, there were a lot of clothing stores and other fashion accessories from the 70s, luckily, the stores were almost empty, clothes weren't as interesting to tourists.
They must have had a couple of beers only, since Steve couldn't get drunk and Tony just wanted to enjoy the moment sober at his lover's side. So when the game is over, with a Dodgers' victory, and Steve asks if Tony wants to leave he nods affirmatively. Yes, he just wants to spend the rest of the night with Steve only for him.
The man puts his finger on the trigger again, prepare to pull it again when Tony runs in his direction, hit him and bring him to the ground. The guy struggles while Tony holds him arm aiming the gun to the empty aisle, except for the almost dead-guy shot in the stomach bleeding next to them. Another gunshot is heard and that's the moment where Steve takes the gun out of the bad guy hand pulling Tony next to him and aiming to the man laid on his back on the floor.
They exit the shop with another briefcase in Tony's right hand, while he carried the briefcase with the Tesseract in his left hand.
Steve takes two steps back, the distance between him and the bomb grows a little, and the blond turns his head to Tony's direction. Tony opens his mouth to shout, to say something, but there is no time.
He doesn't see who spits at his side while saying that he is disgusted. He felt humiliated as he never felt, and the thought that he won't be the last to suffer this kind of aggression makes him feel sick. The guys leave laughing down the street on the opposite side he should head. Tony groans in pain in an attempt of lifting himself, the pain reflected in all over his body.
He kept breathing, then a sudden noise caught his attention. He turns his head in the direction of the reception to see a tall, blonde woman, with clicking high heels walking down the hallway.
Tony looks to the clock to see that is already midday, and lunch is almost ready, Steve should be on his way. Tony turns on the TV, there is an old movie passing and he can just think of how Steve enjoys these old movies.
"He's not going to stop making jokes about the sexual tension between us during every Avengers' meeting."
"I want to take the day off." Steve states. "We have four days left we should enjoy while we can, you know, before we come back to reality and have to deal with this whole Thanos' stuff again." Tony smiles gently and Steve holds his hand in his. "I want to take you on a date."
Tony looks around, there were many families and friends hosted there since they're in mid-July, vacation time, yay!
“You know, I was thinking, back in the nineties, these kinds of accidents were common. The material they used to make light bulbs was shitty,” Tony commented, rubbing his hand up and down on Steve’s arm. “Though, I found it funny the way the models yelled because of it.”
Tony takes a deep breath, closing his eyes for a second, feeling the tightness of Steve's arm dissipates when he let go of Tony. The brunet glances up to the old man on the window.
Hank pointed to the labs indicating their function and the projects that were being developed in them. Well, the Pym particles must've been somewhere here down here, and now that he and Steve were there they could look carefully to find it, it shouldn't take too long now.
Steve tries to pull his thoughts together again. None of this was making sense, they already messed this timeline. Tony was right, why Hydra expected that someone would try to steal the Tesseract? Was anyone else behind the cube? Steve knew that Hydra always wanted that stupid cube to make advanced weapons, did they want to start a war again? He would be surprised if it was it. But SHIELD also had the tesseract, he remembers well enough that Nick Fury also wanted to create weapons using the power of the cube. Oh God, that was such a mess, he is not able to think straight right now, so he shuts his eyes tight.
Steve reaches out for the brunet's hand, ready and eager for making the travel back to San Francisco.
"That's where Janet lives." Steve lift a brow without understand Tony's point. "His fiancée. They'll get married at the end of the year." Steve agrees.
It’s only thirty minutes from Manhattan to his apartment in Brooklyn. Well, their apartment since Bucky is still his roommate even if it’s only for a few more months now. The thought of his best friend leaving soon makes Steve’s heart clenched. They have always been together since they were kids, and Bucky used to protect him from the bullies in the streets, it was also Bucky who dragged his tiny ass home every time Steve got in a fight for something he believed it wasn’t fair. Steve had to suppress his laugh, not wanting to look weird for smiling randomly in public. Bucky has always been there, and he always will be, Steve reminds himself. Till the end of the line, right? That’s what they say to each other.
It was him, no doubt. His hair falling onto his forehead, his lips slightly parted, the blankets wrinkled covering his body, he looks so peaceful. Tony doesn't remember the last time he got a proper night of sleep.
It's just a stupid beneficient ball, whose Alpha Tony is talking right now is giving to raise funds for charity. Well, that was what he and all the media said, but the Avengers knew better. They knew very well that that ball only serves to undercover Omega’s body traffic, and that is exactly why Tony had volunteered to attract said Alpha. So no matter how much Steve wanted to punch the Alpha in the face, he knows he can’t do it. He can’t disclose the other Avengers split in the building. He can’t jeopardize the whole mission because his Alpha’s instincts are telling him to keep his Omega away from the man.
“Thanks,” the other guy said, placing himself beside the young woman. Steve nodded to both of them politely.
"Thank you for..." Tony gestures, passing by the girl in the counter, she waves a quick goodbye to him.
"A little bit, if you touch by accident. But it's not uncomfortable at all. I liked it, though." Tony says smiling. Steve lets out a sigh of relief. "Don't worry, Capsicle. You won't break me." He leans and kisses Steve, suddenly, the blond is on top of him again.
Suddenly a little person entered the room running like a lightning. Steve lowered to get Morgan into his arms. She was wearing a cute red dress that Pepper had bought her.
His eyes come back to reality when he saw the men in the corner moving, an apparent fight surging among them, Steve turns around to see what is going on, then something hits the back of his neck because Steve takes his hand to it, Tony can see a bit of blood between the supersoldier fingers, the supersoldier turns around to see where it came from. He stumbles, the fight behind him ceases and Steve fell on his knee, he looks drunk, but Steve can't get drunk.
The fact is, they kissed for the first time two weeks ago, and since then they were inseparable. They have been seeing each other a lot, having dinner together, going out after work, Tony got the habit of picking him up almost every day, and when Steve wasn’t busy helping Bucky with the wedding plans, he’d probably be out with Tony. Tony took him out to the places he liked the most in NY, like that nightclub in the middle of Manhattan, which Steve had to admit he had plenty of fun, but only because Tony was with him. On the other hand, Steve liked to sketch Tony when they went to Central Park, or sometimes a photograph, even when Tony jokes that Steve has a lot of pictures of him, and he still didn’t think it was enough.
Time flies by lightning-fast. Steve absorbs every moment like a dry sponge, every laugh, every smile, every shared conversation, every almost-touch. Every actual hug he receives from his son. Every kiss he shares with Tony. It’s easy to forget the world’s going down outside the doors.
“I can feel you’re overthinking it. It’s Christmas Eve, babe. Let that high-functioning brain of yours have some holiday time, too.”
Even through Steve’s normally constantly high temperature he feels the cold and is glad for the warmth the cup gives off. It’s below freezing temperature out here. Snow is softly falling around them. For a second Steve wants to mouth off about Tony not wearing a jacket over his sweater, but his husband’s only pulling him close with his free hand, a brilliant smile on his face, and presses a long and languid kiss onto his mouth in a way that steals Steve’s every thought.
Yet again, Steve is amazed at the kid’s grasp on time (though maybe Tony told him a couple of days or weeks ago). But he’s absolutely right. They’d decided to take turns in buying the tree for the common floor after Thor had blown out a whole window during a fight over the “most festive tree in this house” three years ago. So they had established a yearly rotation, giving everyone the opportunity to buy the
That the kid has to resort to measures like this to get Steve to pay attention to him is unacceptable, no matter what Tony and he, and all the other people out there helping where they can, are going through right now.
Cursing colorfully he fully focused on the screen, was ready to yell at his AI why she hadn’t alerted him that the kid had taken a walk through the penthouse when a small voice behind him made him pause.
“Hey darling.” He paused. He actually had no idea how to say what he wanted to say. A rare occurrence in and of itself, Tony Stark not knowing what to say. He sighed, dragged a hand over his face, threw another look at the monitor where FRIDAY had displayed Peter’s room. The kid was still playing and he was still sullen. Damn.
Staring at him intently with wide eyes, Peter stilled noticeably so suddenly Tony was instantly worried.
Once he’s through the paper a small cardboard box appears, two big handprints with two smaller ones right on top of the big ones. Immediately Steve’s in love, all over again, with both his husband and their son. It only gets better after that.
Steve needs a moment to make the connection in that joke, but when he does, he can’t help the chuckle and the fond eye roll.
“I’m clever.” The smile was obvious in his voice. Tony didn’t need to look to hear it. “Miss Knight says so. And you and Papa say it, too, sometimes.”
“Listen, Pete,” Tony repeated. “I don’t know what you think you’ve heard. But I do know for sure that Papa watches the videos. When he has the time he calls. Which sadly isn’t often, but it’s what we have. But he definitely watches the videos, trust me on that.”
“Guess what?” Tony breathes into the small space between them. It still takes Steve a couple of seconds to recover from that kiss and gather his thoughts enough to speak.
Carefully he pulls the construction that comes into view out of the box. The second his mind takes it all in Steve is close to tears.
Tony was halfway off to sleep himself when the bundle at his side spoke up again, drawing in Tony’s attention.
“They’re not… you can just pull the lid off,” Tony explains, already halfway bent over to do it himself, but Peter thoroughly slaps his hands away.
“Papa?” he lowly asks. “Are you done moping now?” He looks at him expectantly. Steve fondly smiles at his kid, dragging a hand over his head.
And dropped everything and rushed past Tony into the kitchen. Which could only mean one thing: Peter wanted to help. Which was both adorable and exhausting. As much as he was trying to help most of the time Tony had to stop his enthusiasm before it got out of hand.
Peter only shook his head, shock of hair flying around wildly. Absently Tony thought the kid should get a haircut soon. He watched, both suspicious and intrigued, as Peter seemed suddenly
One memorable morning, when his brain’s still half asleep, he even suspects Tony’s bought another island (as nice as that vacation had been, he needn’t have
Pete’s eyes widen, fearing that his Daddy will tell after all, as Tony chirps into his ear, “Only Santa knows.”
“… and, and Auntie Nat thought she could wrap them faster than me, but I’ve wrapped enough presents that I’m fast as light! Even faster than Papa!”
“You need to smile! And we need to finish for Christmas Eve! Papa’s here and the tree’s not finished and you haven’t started cooking! What are we supposed to eat?” He paused shortly, clearly thinking of something critical, but before Steve or Tony could say anything he continued, “Do we have enough to eat? Daddy!” He nearly screamed at Tony. The volume of his voice distracted the genius shortly from his obviously suffering husband. “Do we have enough food? Papa needs to eat a lot! Do we need to go grocery shopping?
When their lips finally met Tony couldn’t help the happy little sigh that escaped his lungs. He’d missed Steve’s lips and his mouth and his everything so damn much, he just wanted to crawl into him and stay there forever. But Steve, the spoilsport, kept the kiss chaste. Much to Tony’s anger and simultaneous relief because as he wanted to lose himself fully in the kiss, Peter made some strange noise.
He tried to make light conversation, cheer the kid up a little, or at least distract him, and for the most part of the afternoon it worked. Until he brought over the fresh branches, including some mistletoe.
The scream that wakes Steve in the morning is ear-shattering. For a moment he thinks something’s happened, that Pete is actually in danger because of - whatever, but the scream is immediately followed by an obvious squeal of joy and that makes Steve relax back into the sheets. Tony next to him only groans once before flopping down face first onto Steve’s chest.
“Peter,” Steve interrupted, gently pulling his face back from his shoulder. “Take a breath in between sentences.”
It’s a mechanical version of one of his most favorite scenes: Peter, Tony and him, standing around a decorated Christmas tree in between a mountain of presents. It’s… animated, for the lack of a better description. The tree’s lights are blinking in different colors. Steve’s wearing a Christmas hat whose bobble changes lights from red to blue to white. Tony’s waving his hand at him, a bright smile on his face. The small figure that is clearly Peter has a smile that’s the biggest feature on his face, showing how happy he is being pulled up by his dads’ strong arms from time to time. Sometimes even one of the presents under the tree lights up.
He just wants to declare as much to his son when Peter practically freezes in his spot, green pencil he’s been drawing tinsels with hovering over the paper. Before he can ask about it, though, the pencil falls and Pete scrambles off his seat
They finished preparing the chicken Tony had picked out to be their dinner and once it was cooking away in the oven they took care of the tree. Tony could see that Steve still had problems, bending down, picking things up, still favoring his right side, but the man was stubborn. He didn’t let Peter know he wasn’t alright. Tony was still worried. If he could have it his way Steve would be in medical, not wincing when he wanted to lift his son into his arms. A task he was usually able to perform even with Tony without breaking a sweat thanks to the super soldier serum, never mind their son.
“Guess we broke Papa, big guy,” he hears Tony murmur somewhere next to them. It’s enough to prompt Steve to swallow down the lump in his throat and wipe away his tears after he’s pulled back.
“Oh, don’t give me that look.” Tony pinches his sensitive side in a way that makes Steve’s whole body tense up. He’s buried under the two people he cherishes most in life and he’d hate to jostle them around.
“Daddy?” Peter’s voice was soft, but when Tony made some agreeing noise, he continued. “You’re allowed to miss him, too.” It sounded like he wanted to say more, but somehow couldn’t bring himself to. Tony waited it out, gave him the time he needed. In the end, Peter added in one long breath, “Last week Miss Knight said it’s alright to miss your friends when you can’t see them in preschool or for a play date and it’s the same with Papa, isn’t it? Right?”
His eyes are still glinting dangerously and Steve doesn’t know if he should be suspicious or excited for what’s to come.
“Don’t I get a hello kiss?” Steve motioned to the mistletoe still in Tony’s hand, long forgotten. Dumbly Tony’s eyes wandered to the branch, then back to his husband. It finally spurred his brain into action.
They’d worked a mission up until well in the morning (whatever SHIELD had thought pulling two Avengers off for something they could achieve in two days; though maybe that was exactly why they had done it, making sure that it was over before Christmas).
“Got a surprise for you,” Tony whispers into his ear next, voice hot and promising. Instantly Steve feels a pull in his middle. “Follow me.”
Peter pouted, his bottom lip quivering. Yeah, he’d seen through that lie right away. Tony hadn’t expected it any other way, wouldn’t want his son any differently. He was on the brink of tears, though, and Tony knew he couldn’t help his baby’s sorrow right now. There wasn’t a lot out of his reach, being Tony Stark and Iron Man, but sadly, this was. Tony would’ve given most of his fortune without thinking about it twice to make that wish true, but he… couldn’t.
“Right you are, Pete, I don’t.” He throws his husband a dirty glare for bringing the island-issue up again, but thinks it falls a little flat, if he has to judge by the mischievous, loving glint in Tony’s eyes. “I’d rather like to see what’s in here.” He tilts the present in his hands from one side to the other carefully, afraid to shake it too hard in case it might be fragile. Who knows what his two boys have come up with? Steve certainly doesn’t.
“Of course it’s ok, Pete. I know he’s away a lot and when he’s here sometimes I have to go on business trips.” He sighed. SI business was finished for the year. Pepper had kicked him out of her office with a snide comment about how he’d done his duty and that he should take care of his family, work could wait until January. But it would come, even though Tony’d made it a policy that he’d only be at the meetings he absolutely had to attend since otherwise Pepper would have his head. The rest of the time his little family was priority #1.
“How about,” Tony started slowly when he had his own emotions under enough control and felt like he could regulate Peter’s, “we record a message with FRIDAY’s help and send it to Papa? So that he knows we’re thinking about him? How’s that sound?” He managed a watery smile that Peter didn’t return. His reaction wasn’t as docile as Tony’d have expected. The small boy’s face was suddenly hard and twisted in a scowl as he tried to push away from Tony (which Tony obviously didn’t allow since it would’ve sent him straight off his lap and to the ground).
Until he suddenly asks, “Steve?” (or not so suddenly, Steve can’t be the judge of that. He’s sitting on the couch with his eyes closed, whishing his husband was by his side).
Everything else Steve feels like he can deal with, but not another island. Tony only frowns for a moment before he laughs into the near silence of the evening around them.
The fondness turns into a full-on smile. “I did roll my eyes. You’re an incorrigible man sometimes.”
The rest of the box is covered in Peter’s handprints in various colors. At closer inspection Steve sees that small screws keep the lid firmly in place. Totally unnecessary, but nevertheless sweet. Steve suspects Peter has asked his Dad to add a touch of his own with that since the handprints are mostly his.
disappointed their son like that - the first Christmas the kid might actually remember and one of the most important people in his life was missing! “And honestly? I don’t know if he’s going to make it.”
He’s burst out of his bubble when Tony sighs. He sounds as reluctant as Steve feels when he starts his next sentence with, “Hey, you two, listen…”
Multiple times he tries to question Peter what scheme he and his Dad have concocted, but for all the kid’s bubbly outgoing nature he’s inherited from Tony he’s keeping this secret rather well. He apparently tells it to everyone else, though.
“Papa! You’re back!” He only reached up to Steve’s hips, but he managed to bury his face in Steve’s abdomen immediately nonetheless. Tony clearly saw him wince in pain this time.
Tony has to hear his throat closing up because he lowers his voice to this soothing timbre that washes over Steve’s mind and body like a warm blanket. He isn’t really listening for exact words; just Tony’s voice is enough to make his muscles relax.
Out of the corner of his eyes Steve glares at Tony, but that only makes him laugh, too. So this is what his life’s come to: his husband is laughing at him, making fun of him, all at his expense, and in front of their son, too, who only nestles closer to him. It’s a small comfort Steve cherishes nevertheless.
She leans in conspiratorially, whispering, “Bruce has a pot in the kitchen. But you’ll have to be careful. He’s still in cooking-mode.” Meaning, close to letting the Hulk throw out everyone sneaking into and/or standing around uselessly in his kitchen.
Tony let Peter break away from him. He made sure the kid didn’t fall or otherwise hurt himself, but let him storm off in his anger. For a moment he watched the kid, but in the end couldn’t hold back the heavy sigh.
“Uh oh. What did I do?” He tries to sound funny and fond instead of the actual panic that settles in his chest at the thought of having fucked up and having hurt their kid in the process.
“Daddy!” He sounded scandalized beyond compare and Tony already thought something had happened, but then the kid basically screamed, “Dinner!”
“Not now,” he whispered, half-way into his Captain America voice, and Tony knew something was deeply wrong. Something that Steve didn’t want to address. But Tony wouldn’t have that. He knew what it looked like when his husband was severely injured and as much as he obviously tried to hide it, Tony saw right through him.
“Valerie?” Is she still a thing? Steve has to be honest and say he can’t remember if Sam is still interested in the woman working the front desk.
“It’s just… it’s only a message, kid.” He made a gesture towards the screen. “You want to say something, too?”
“You ever realize you’re a really lucky guy, Stevie?” Bucky’s hand lands heavily on his shoulder. Steve’s smile only widens.
“A little to the right,” it finally came. Tony nodded before stepping up to the tree again and pulling it a little to the right, just like his son had told him to.
“You actually do?” Steve asks for a good reason. “Because four years ago I had to stop you from buying a whole-“
“Alright, alright. I’m right behind you.” He drags a hand over the kid’s hair. “I’ll convince Papa to make us breakfast while you go brush your teeth.” Gently, he pushes him off him and goes untangling himself from the covers. Steve thinks his heart bursts with love for his two men. Infatuated as he is, Steve pulls his husband close before Tony can make his way out of the bed, pressing another kiss to his lips that ends in smiles on both their lips.
“Hey.” Tony turned him around in his arms so he could look at the boy. Gently, he framed Peter’s face, softly brushing the tears - goddamn tears! - running down his cheeks away with his thumbs. “None of that. He’ll be here. He promised, remember?”
Peter eyes first the phone in Steve’s hands, then his Papa skeptically. Knowing where this is heading, Steve has to work really hard to suppress the smile when he asks if he should turn the speaker off. Peter needs another moment to decide, but then nods wildly, holding out his hands to accept the phone. Steve does as he’s told.
“Hey buddy,” Steve pressed out through clenched teeth. Tony was this shy of ripping the kid away from him, grabbing him by the scruff of the neck and dragging him off to the med wing five floors down. Steve only shrugged Tony’s death glare off with one shoulder before leaning in again.
Wait. Had Peter just said he’d sent videos of his own? Tony’s eyebrows shot up towards his hairline. His son and his AI must’ve collaborated behind his back on that because Tony certainly wouldn’t have approved any of it.
At his next words Steve’s eyes were on him. “He was in the workshop which you’re not allowed in without him knowing.” He threw Peter a snide side glance, but his eyes quickly darted back to Tony. His eyes were shining with something dark, but wonderful and Tony couldn’t breathe right. “And you told FRIDAY to zoom in to let me see what he was doing. There was some strange agitation in your voice that I couldn’t place at first, but when I saw what he was looking at, I knew.”
you didn’t want anything to do with us anymore and FRIDAY said you’d call back when you had the time and you never did! And Rita form preschool said her father did the same when he left her and her mom and I know that you wouldn’t leave just like that, but I was so
"It's not so easy finding clothes for your size," Tony complains, pushing the clothes against Steve's chest.
It’s Steve’s turn to be surprised. He didn’t mean to look so obvious. The time he spent in the Army was enough to make Steve learn to be discreet and avoid statements like that.
The façade is sinister, and the logo mark with a red octopus was even more devilfish. Steve furrowed while he parked his bike. Maybe that wasn’t a good idea, now that Steve was there it doesn’t seem a good idea at all. There’s something about that place that gives him chills, and a cold shiver goes up to his spine.
“See you later,” Pietro said when the doors opened on the 4th floor, indicating that was the finances department.
"Mr. Stark." The man said, immediately Tony recognizes his voice, it was the same who spoke with him on the phone just this morning. "You should've warned us that you'd pay us a visit."
Also, Tony wasn't the kind that talk about his feelings openly. He surely talked with his teammates when they're all together, he jokes and teases everyone around him. But when it comes to talking about him, Tony always went to Natasha and Bruce. In the beginning, Steve felt hurt, he wanted to Tony talks with him, trust him, even though he knew that he doesn't deserve it. He, himself, never talk about him either. Maybe, he had treated Tony too harshly those years, he thought that pushing the billionaire away maybe, maybe he would stop having feelings for his teammate, because that was what Tony always would be with him, after all, Tony is straight, right?
Steve gave it a bite, chewing the rubberized cheese and tasteless tomatoes on it. He walked towards the main table, and he opened his laptop. It took a while and some daily updates until it’s ready for him to be able to use the computer. Steve curses himself to have to use his greasy fingers on his not-so-new laptop. He uploaded the photos taken, first on his blog, then he published the swans’ picture, the last one from that day, on his Instagram, but he doesn’t post it right away. His fingers hover on the keyboard to find a nice caption, usually, it’s Bucky who helps him with it, even though Bucky always use clichés quotes using the argument that people loved clichés. Well, Steve can’t deny it since his most liked pictures were the ones that Bucky captioned. The blond runs his fingers through his hair, regretting immediately when he remembers his greasy fingers.
Steve doesn’t even listen to his friends’ footsteps when they come into the room, he was too focused on making the man bleed, he’s too aggressive to even notice that the man passed out. His instincts tell him that it was right, that he's just protecting his mate. It took Thor and Bruce to get Steve off the man, which requires Thor to hold Steve tightly to allow Natasha and Clint to take the body outside, alive, breathing, while Natasha handcuffs the pervert Alpha.
"That's him," Tony said, leaning on the wall, ready to have a talk with whoever he was speaking. At the same time, he just wanted to hang up and find Steve.
"What's the matter?" Tony asks, his eyes following every move Steve makes. The supersoldier puts the bottle on the counter harsher than it needed. His blue eyes turn to him sharply.
“I proposed to Peggy,” it was all that Bucky said, a timid grin on his face. “She said yes.” Steve threw his bag on the couch, almost unable to contain the happiness and excitement he was feeling.
So, Steve leads him to the exit, both of them anxious to be alone again, five drunks guys stumbling in each other get in the pub bumping in everyone around, included Tony. Steve puts his hand protectively on Tony's lower back and once they are out, Steve holds Tony's hand firmly, Tony smiles. They could only be themselves when they're away from people gaze.
“We were playing tag!” says Morgan jumping happily. The couple looks to each other, an amused smile on their face. Living in New York means that Peter would show up for lunch occasionally and play with the little girl. Morgan treated the boy like he was his body. And honestly, they, the avengers, were a family.
The sun was setting in the horizon when Tony opened the cupboard and realized that they really needed to go to a grocery store if they were planning to have homemade dinner tonight.
He leaves the sketchbook on the couch and opens the door of the apartment to head to the rooftop. The morning wind is cold and strong, his hair ruffles everywhere, the sunlight is still weak in the horizon, but it gives the sky an exquisite view, painting it with tones of light and dark blue, and weak yellow.
He wanted, at least, to try drawing something since sleep seems something unreachable right now, Steve points the pencil to the paper, but he is out of ideas, he starts to draft a line carefreely, he has no idea how much time has passed, he ended up with a paper covered in nonsense lines that means nothing, it's not even a draw, just some scribbles. He looks at the clock to realize it's 4:50, the sun will be raise soon.
Tony bites his nails while watching the footage. He sees when Steve fell unconscious on the edge of the sidewalk and the men in the corner rush to get him, then a beige van stops by, opening the door, the men put Steve inside and that is it. That's how Steve disappeared, actually, he was kidnapped, but by whom? For which purpose? These questions wander in Tony's mind without being answered and it makes him anxious as hell.
There's an urge in their kiss, but it's needy at the same time. Steve holds Tony's head with his big hands, deepening the kiss, while Tony's hands are holding his hips with a firm grasp. Tony bits Steve's bottom lip, which makes the supersoldier smiles before they tear apart to catch their breath. Although, Steve keeps dropping down kisses on Tony's neck and shoulder.
Steve sat up, his back against the head of the bed, he pats his side to indicate that Tony must come and sit. The billionaire got the message, making his way to Steve's bed.
"Morning, you too." Steve twitched his nose. "Are you feeling better?" Tony rolls his eyes in response and gets up.
Behind him, Tony feels something move, he turns around quickly blocking a punch directed to his jaw. Another guy came in his direction, and Tony pulled the guy he was holding his fist in the second, they stumbled. Steve had just knocked out one of his opponents when another goi in a fight with him.
Also, there's a 10K Steve and Tony one-shot coming out this week. Pretty much fluff, I love to write fluffy.
"This... This is not possible." Natasha sighs exasperatedly at this statement like she already had had that conversation.
“Yeah, okay. Where is it?” Steve leaned down to write the address Sam was saying. “I’ll be there in twenty minutes.”
"Why not? You still love her, right? If we're going to get stuck here, you could try again. You know, have that life, family." Tony is awful giving advice.
They ordered their food along with a white wine. Tony would make an exception this night, he wants to enjoy every minute by Steve's side and forgets about the future for a while, they need that break. They need a moment where they'd only enjoy themselves without any superheroes issues to bother them. That night is just theirs.
By the time they finished, Steve knew everyone’s name in the room. He was good at knowing names by heart, and the team was friendly, so it helped him to feel comfortable. Steve looked over the hundreds of pictures he had taken and that Natasha would choose among them, so he could edit. He didn’t notice when the brunette models got closer to him.
Tony walks lost in his thoughts, he leaves his feet to guide him all the way, when he is close to his old neighborhood he walks fast and kind of nervous, looking around to check if he is not being followed, which he thinks is unlikely, but better safe than sorry, right?
“Let’s get some lunch, Rogers. I’m starving,” Wanda leaned against the doorframe, which makes Steve laugh, and hurried up to go with the intern.
"Thank you," Tony says, keeping his eyes shut just feeling the wind on his face, that's so peaceful and calmly, and Tony just wishes that he could stop the world in this moment, because nothing could be more perfect than this, he knew it from the bottom of his heart.
But now, here they are, cuddling in the couch like happier than ever, and all Steve only could wish that it longs, that they were happy till death do them apart.
“Peggy is always right,” Bucky replied with a chuckle. Steve smiled, that was true, Peggy was good at reading people. “Did Natasha call you?” Steve frowned, putting two cartons of milk in the basket.
Steve only slows their paces down when he saw the ugly building in front of them, the ink peeling. Steve got his keys inside his leather jacket, the same that Tony had given him as a birthday gift. That's when Steve lets go of his hand, get in the apartment, and going in the kitchen direction.
So, Steve puts a hand on the genius' shoulder and squeeze it softly. Tony had his back to Steve, so the blond doesn't see when the philanthropist closes his eyes with his touch. It is warm. Tony sighed in relief. The gesture shouldn't be that comfortable.
“Hey, Laura. Well done. Thank you for today,” Wanda approached. Laura smiled at her and walked away to where the other models were getting dressed. “They all have a crush on you,” Wanda declared with laughter. “Oh God, they will be so disappointed when they know.” She laughed more and loudly.
Tony stays on the corner of the hallway watching scientists, interns, and staff people doing their daily and boring activities in their respective departments. Some interns pass by talking about a lecture scheduled for today, so Tony was right, there is a scientific event occurring in the hall, as well as Hydra agents looking around for them.
His interview is only at 08:00. It’s too early to get himself ready, so Steve stands up and passes a tank top through his head. He’s going to his daily morning run, a habit he can’t let go of since the military. It helped Steve clear his mind back then, and hopefully, it still does.
"I'll pay for the meal, you pay for the hotel room, alright?" Tony doesn't even have the time to contest before Steve pays for it.
On the second floor, a female agent of SHIELD got in the elevator too. She keeps looking awkwardly to the them, alternating her glance to the document in her hands and to them. Steve lowers his cap and Tony steps forward attempting to cover the blond's face. The doors open on the fourth floor and the genius steps out.
“Don’t worry,” Natasha said, stepping forward to take another glass of wine when the waiter passed close to them. She sipped the alcoholic beverage, then turned around to stare at Steve. “Bring your documents tomorrow.”
"Fuck," Tony mumbles, twisting an agent's arm and pushing him against another one, both stumbling on one's another and falling through the glass door.
They finished with the floor, and both wash their hands before eating. Steve sees that Tony made a Caesar Salad, which is basically lettuce and vegetables, chicken, eggs, bacon, mayo, and parmesan. Everything looks delicious.
Tony sees Steve going in the direction of the elevator. Steve turns back to him and shook his head. No. There are no Pym particles in Hank's office. Of course, he should have known better, it is probably in one of the labs, but they did not have the time to check each one.
Tony bites his lower lip. Steve notices his brown watery eyes, so he rubs up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture. He did not know what was wrong, but if he could reassure Tony that everything was fine, he would. After all, the man had done the same for him on other occasions.
“Okay, okay,” Tony shakes his head, the phantom of a smile tugging in the corner of his lips. “I’m okay with all of this. Pepper and I are friends. We’ve been friends for… what? 10 years, I guess,” Tony taps on his chin. “I guess so. Anyway, we’ve had a relationship in the past, two years ago, I think, I’m not sure. God, I’m terrible at dates. We are fine. We broke up for the best. We’re only friends. I trust Pepper, she trusts me,” Steve raised an amused brow. “Okay. She trusts me a little bit. She’ll handle the board meeting better than me, so it’s an obvious choice. She loves what she does. We’re all good,” Tony reaches for Steve’s hand on the blond’s knee. “She’s just a friend, Steve.”
"What took you so long?" Steve asks a bit impatient when Tony hands him the clothes he had stolen just a few minutes ago.
"Sorry. You looked so sexy, I didn't want to ruin the moment." Tony sat beside him observing Steve's moves.
After Tony snaps his fingers, everyone thought he would die, he thought himself that he would die, like Banner said no one could handle that amount of gamma radiation. But he didn’t die, surprisingly.
They were two hours away from entering San Francisco when Tony suggested grabbing something to eat, after all, they still had to look for someplace to settle in. Steve sighed in frustration after affirm that they could eat as soon as they reach downtown, but Tony denied, insisting him to go. Steve ends up agreeing because he really hasn't seen Tony eating since they left the cafeteria in New Jersey, also because Tony's stomach rumbled.
“No, no,” Steve waves his hands. “I mean, are we dating? We never really talked about it, and things just start happening too quickly--”
Steve laughs a really genuine laughter, the only person who can make him laughs like that is Tony. He missed it when he was away, he missed Tony, their talks, God, even their fights he had missed.
She seems cautious for a while, like she is evaluating if it is a good idea to let Tony go in the security. Then, she nods, agreeing. She shouts something to the boy in the front of the bakery and waves her hand for Tony to follow her.
Tony observes his abs and biceps taking off the shirt, he watches each move Steve does attentively with desire. Steve sighs noticing his stare.
He opens the package and the smell of sugar coming up in the air. Tony puts a few of the colorful gums into his mouth before offers it to Steve. The supersoldier takes a few, while Tony snuggles close to him, Steve passes his arm around the brunet's shoulder, so he can accommodate himself comfortably.
Those lightbulbs exploding in there, sending pieces flying everywhere, plus the noise of them blowing out. All these little things happening at once sent Steve back to the battlefield in Afghanistan.
Instantly, Tony touches his glasses twice, activating the vision for heat signatures. FRIDAY scanned the place, looking for entries, hidden spots, and traps, according to the AI scanning, his best chance is to enter for the back door, and of course, that is exactly what Tony does.
“So full, Alpha,” Tony exhales, his arms wrapped around Steve, breathing heavily against the Alpha’s shoulder.
A flash of sunlight pours between the black curtains, the only source of light in the room right now dancing onto her messy desk. Steve would definitely scold her if he saw those pencils and papers spread all over the desk carelessly, she doesn't care, though, she finds herself into her own mess.
He shook those thoughts away. Remembering his time in the Army was a hard thing. Steve thought that he could not be able to forgive the mistakes he had made in missions, the men he wasn’t able to save. Bucky would say that Steve always took too much on him, and maybe he did because he was the kind of man who took all the responsibility on him. Steve sighed, that’s exactly what he has been working with his therapist.
She jumps on her unmade bed, laying on her back, her eyes fixed on the white ceiling. Home and family, she thinks before she drifts.
"Calm down there, big guy." Tony puts a hand on Steve's shoulder, squeezing it in a sign of comfort. "That's not a problem, since I'm good at memorizing this kind of stuff. The big question here is, why the hell they would take the floor plan and leave that behind?"
"There" he manages to say but a moan comes out of his mouth, however, Steve seems to get what he said because the blond keeps thrusting in the exact spot. "Harder." And Steve obeys his command. Steve pulls out and goes back deeper inside him, moaning so loud that those thin walls will never be capable to muffle it.
The warehouse was immersed in complete darkness. Tony had FRIDAY shutting down their electrical system, so the HYDRA agents were blind, they would not find Pierce for a while and they did not know that Tony was walking freely on their hallways, he had bought himself some minutes to find Steve. He had memorized the room Steve was in looks like a lab, and Tony was heading for there.
Tony chuckles warmly when he hears Peter’s overenthusiastic greeting as well as his babbling. The boy’s basically reciting what he’s done over the last couple of days minutely.
Tony didn’t know where the kid got that from, but he wanted Christmas to be perfect. This year it wouldn’t be. His Papa still wasn’t home.
But he doubted he could do that to Peter now that he knew his Papa was home. And he didn’t want to be the one to ruin Christmas. He’d suffered through enough of those for three lifetimes.
“Straight as Uncle Clint!” Peter grinned broadly. Tony couldn’t help but return it. And hadn’t he taught that expression to the kid himself he would’ve been scandalized. Birdbrain sure had been the first time he’d heard it before he’d broken out in laughter that continued for the better part of team/family dinner.
“I loved each and every video you two sent me. They made me feel like I was with you, even though I was miles away. And that last one…” His voice trailed off along with his gaze. Tony frowned. Which had been the last video he’d sent Steve? What in it could’ve evoked that reaction from him?
Still grinning, he held out his hand. Tony was still so struck that for a moment he didn’t know what to do. Steve had already raised his eyebrows when the genius’ brain caught up with the fact that he was still holding the mistletoe in his hand.
“Pep’s almost literally throwing daggers at me right now,” Tony soundly interrupts him. “Bye, bye, love you, gotta go.”
“He won’t watch it anyway! He never calls and he never watches the videos! I heard you say it on the phone!”
Tony shivers and tries to bury himself deeper in Steve’s arms, but he doesn’t allow that. He only cups Tony’s cheek again, drawing his face up so he can look him in the eyes. There are snowflakes glistening in Tony’s hair, on his eyelashes even, running a race with the glow in his eyes, and for a second Steve can’t breathe until Tony gives him back the air he’s stolen in form of another kiss.
and with his Cap plushie tightly clutched to his chest, his eyes wide and staring at Tony innocently.
“No!” the boy interrupted what would surely have been a heroic speech. Tony was speechless given Peter’s sudden outburst. Steve wasn’t any more articulate, though Tony was spared his mouth standing open.
Steve was clearly amused by that snide remark. Tony could see it already that he wanted to agree with the kid, out loud, and precautionary sent a deadpan look his way that dared him to say something to that. Being the little shit that his husband was, though, he took a careful breath and said, “You really should get to it, Tony. You can’t loaf around all afternoon. Someone needs to cook dinner.”
“Of course she said yes,” Steve ran his fingers through his hair. “Oh God, Buck. Congratulations!” Steve pulled Bucky into a hug, patting him on the back. “I’m happy for you, man.”
Then, Tony woke up with an idea, something that would be really helpful later. Pym Technologies's floor plan. The original one, with all the hide entry and labs, because obviously, Hank Pym wouldn't put the Pym particles in the showcase, there must be a hidden lab somewhere in the building.
"I'm fine, sir. Thank you for asking." He was hyperventilating, his body wasn't calming down the way he expects. He looks to Steve almost claiming for help, he had helped him to calm down last night, so maybe, maybe he could help him again.
"Why don't you try on that one?" Tony says, less embarrassed now, while pointing to a spot behind the blond. He turns around to see that Tony was pointing to a black leather jacket in the shop window.
Thank you for all of you who read this story, it was nice to write this during the last three months, I hope y'all enjoyed it. Thanks for all the kudos and comments!
"Yeah, I guess my half brother enjoyed the place," Tony lies skeptically, they can't risk rising any suspects about their status.
He looked up at Tony. His lips were moving, forming indecipherable words. Steve furrowed. Tony moved closer, putting his hands carefully and lightly on the soldier’s shoulders. Steve took the hands out of his ears, and Tony held them in his, even though his hands were larger than the brunet’s, also Tony’s hands were more calluses than Steve’s. Tony helped him up, he turned around and said something to someone Steve couldn’t see. God, everything was a mess and confused. What had just happened?
Steve held the portfolio against his chest and fixed the bag he was carrying to a nice posture. He went straight to a counter where an attendant was on the phone. He waited patiently looking around the place. The lobby was large, it looked comfortable and modern at the same time. There weren’t many people there at this hour of the day. Steve supposed that everyone was in their offices, preparing and doing the models’ makeup for a day of photoshoots, getting clothes done, drawing new designs, ruling the new collection, or calculating the profit,  this kind of thing.
The owner's chin falls, she looks a bit scandalized, but as soon as her face comes, it fades away while she conducts Tony outside.
“So do I, Buck,” Steve stated, focusing on the pile of plates and pans in front of him. Bucky stayed there for a few more minutes in complete silence until he glanced up to the clock on the wall and decided it was time to get some sleep.
Steve went first, he opened the door of the laundromat, there was no one that can be seen, but they can hear people talk, gunshots practice, soldiers marching turning the corner.
"I like seeing you're wearing one. It suits you" Steve blushes, he was a little surprised that Tony notices the clothes he wears. "Consider it a late birthday gift," Tony says blinking at him and going to the cashier. Well, Steve's birthday was two weeks ago, except for Nat he didn't think anyone else would remember it, though he didn't actually celebrate his birthday anymore.
"Are we ordering takeout?" Tony said while took a sip of his coffee. That was probably the seventh mug he had had only in a day.
The blond forces two pills inside his mouth, muttering something that sounds like "painkillers", then he feels Steve presses a wet cloth against his temple, and it stings, the smell of 70% alcohol in his nostrils, his bottom lips stings when another cloth is pressed against it.
It was late, there is so much to be done tomorrow and here Tony Stark is, folding clothes non-stop because he can't turn his mind off for a damn second, he can't stop thinking about everything that can go wrong tomorrow, and how risky this mission to steal two Pym particles is.
"Doctors. They took blood samples like that that you're holding, a lot of those, actually." Steve frowns like he was remembering something unpleasant. "Pain. I remember someone mentioned the bone marrow." Steve gets up, exasperate, passing his fingers through his hair. "Shit, I don't remember much."
Five minutes had passed since Steve went into the office when Hank appears again walking straight to Tony's direction. Damn it, Tony thinks, taking a step forward to stop Hank.
He had nothing else to lose, so his body surrenders leaning to the blond and bringing their lips together. Tony doesn't need to fight for dominance in this kiss because Steve already allowed him to take over. Steve pulls Tony closer to his body, the brunet is almost sat on his lap. Tony's hand rests on the blond's chest while Steve has his hand on the billionaire tight. It was an urgent and needy kiss, it felt so
Steve smiles, then nods. They have the entire day off, maybe they could just watch Netflix and chill. Whatever. Steve still had to invite Tony for Thanksgiving dinner. He hasn’t commented anything since he wasn’t sure if they were together or just enjoying each other's company, but now that he knew for sure that what’s happening between them were more, he could bring Tony home. Well, he still had to tell Bucky and Peggy about Tony, even though he knew that Peggy wouldn’t mind Tony’s presence, actually, she would be delighted to receive him.
Steve keeps the gun, turning to Tony and reaching for his hand, rushing out of the establishment with hurried steps.
Then, Steve located him. Tony was engaged in a conversation with Clint and Wanda, he holds a glass in of his hands, Steve sighed worried, he hated when Tony drank. Mainly, after everything they’ve been through the past year. Steve approaches, his face turns into unsatisfied, he really didn’t want to have an argument with Tony right now. He was happy they were together again. Tony watches Steve approaching and smiles.
Steve mumbles something close to his shoulder, but Tony is too distracted with the overwhelmed pleasure that his body is receiving now to pay attention to something else. Steve does not seem to mind his lack of attention, though. He keeps pumping his cock with his amazing hands, and Tony feels his cock throbs inside Steve's hand, he's close, damn, he's so fucking close.
"It smells good," Steve says taking the fork to his mouth. Almost closing his eyes to how good it tasted. "You should cook more." Tony just gave him a cocky smile.
It felt like someone had hit on his throat, or he had fallen from the twentieth floor of a building on his back and survived. It felt like someone had punched all the air out of his lungs.
Tony knew, too. There was only one thing that wouldn’t make Steve cry from joy in the course of December. He couldn’t remember exactly what he’d done in the shop that day, but on December 16
When he comes into their bedroom this time he jumps right into Tony’s lap, pushing Steve almost bodily out of the way. It only makes Steve chuckle lightly as his husband maneuvers their son out of the way enough so that he can sit up.
Suddenly Tony remembered the last video and blanched. FRIDAY, the traitor, must’ve sent it on her own because Tony certainly hadn’t. He wouldn’t have shown Steve the obvious sorrow he caused not only his husband, but most of all his son with his continued absences. His eyes darted to Peter.
