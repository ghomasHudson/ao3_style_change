“Yeah, well you didn’t ask, did you?” Tony’s eyes were on the floor, so he didn’t see whatever silent exchange took place between Pepper and Steve, but a few seconds later he grudgingly added, “Sorry.”
“Oh Stark, you don’t even know crazy.” Steve watched this disfunctional, self-loathing exchange play out, entirely unsure whether to halt it or let it continue in the hopes of the two of them getting somewhere productive. He looked to Natasha, who aside from Steve was probably the most intimately familiar with both personalities. She shrugged and popped a strawberry in her mouth.
“I’m fine, Cap, geez. Have you forgotten what I do for a living or something, Boss?” Clint teased as he resettled himself, this time square in the middle of Steve’s lap. (He must have gone down for someone last night; Clint rarely initiated physical contact when both he and his partners were at baseline, and he was sparing and calculated with it in Dominant headspace.)
It had been a good long while since Steve had actually been present for one of Bruce's check-ins. He’d been there for most of Bucky’s at the beginning, before Bucky trusted himself to be alone with any members of the team without Steve present, but generally they were something private Bruce shared with the team’s sub and Switches. Steve had forgotten how beautiful it was to witness, the evidence of comfort and routine saturating every careful touch. And as Steve had long suspected, Tony eased to it beautifully. Despite the numerous and committed protests he had made about his positive responses to check-ins, the evidence of this morning’s upset was already bleeding away under Bruce’s initial pass at his neck, shoulders and upper back.
“Well since a snack food oath was made I should probably tell you that you’re not wrong, Tony, just picking up on something that was probably happening unconsciously.” She peered thoughtfully around the table at the configurations of people and food. “Food can be reflective of headspace, yes, but it’s not a sure enough thing to rely on as a major tell. For instance, Rhodes is feeding Pepper right now, which could be because she’s a sub and he’s a Dom. It might also be because Pepper loves Italian food but always worries about making sure the enhanced people in the Tower get as much as they need, so she never takes as much as she actually wants on the first round.” Pepper flushed, which always highlighted the cluster of freckles just under her left cheekbone. No matter the universe, it was one of Tony’s favourite looks on her, so he had grinned and stuck a piece of his garlic bread on her plate with an exaggerated wink.
“Right. Mortified. Which, I am. But it was pretty great, some of it. I…was it, were you—I guess it probably gets boring after a while?”
“Nobody murder any owls that look like Hedwig, now; it’ll be terrible optics.” There was a strangled noise on the other end of the laugh that could have been a laugh or an aborted sob.
The first couple of times Steve heard his name, it was in the liminal space between waking and sleep where the whole thing could have been real or imagined. He was tangled in the soft sheets of Phil’s bed with Coulson himself behind Steve serving as the ‘big spoon.’ No one but Thor could usually manage to make Steve actually feel small in this position, but it was still reassuring to feel Phil’s chest and stomach pressed against his back and to remember that for once it was someone else’s job to anchor him. He longed to drift in that knowledge, in the feeling of Phil’s diaphragm expanding and contacting with every breath and his chest hair rubbing up against Steve’s sensitive skin. JARVIS’s voice, however, quickly rendered Steve’s internal debate over whether he was awake or dreaming irrelevant.
In short, Tony seemed to have fallen in love with the place. He complimented Steve freely and frequently on the changes he’d made since taking over as Director and asked permission to review everything from the building’s blueprints to personnel files of even the organization’s most junior agents. He acquired knowledge of SHIELD with the same vigour and excitement with which he usually attacked problems of science or mechanics, learning the organization from the inside out, making astute observations and asking questions whose responses he listened to with the entirety of his intense attention. Steve mostly avoided making comparisons to the other Tony these days, but the contrast in this particular arena was too striking to miss. The other Tony had avoided SHIELD like the plague, fearful that he and Steve would be perceived as too dependent on one another. If they were together during the workday, it was always Steve making the trip down to the shop, completing paperwork in the corner or testing weapons upgrades while Tony took extensive notes.
“The team. They were…someone was always watching in one way or another. Nat had to sign off on any SHIELD missions I took that were classified over a certain degree of risk. Someone usually stayed close by during Avengers call-outs. Bucky…he went down and got DUM-E, made me responsible for him.”
Steve, the sounds of the city serving as the soundtrack behind his somewhat awkward and nervous greeting. Domen paused in her packing up, clearly curious and maybe even a little anxious on Steve’s behalf.
“And what about some of the other elements of your life here?” Phil asked, putting down his soup spoon and leaning back in his chair. “You know, of course, that Bruce updated us about the events of the other day. But please know that none of us are forming expectations or assumptions based on a single encounter. We’re not here to demand anything from you, just to have a frank conversation about whether any of our boundaries or limits might need to be adjusted. Is that something you’ve had time to give some thought to, Tony?”
“I think it’s a bit too late for that,” Peter sighed. (Tony was going to stamp that hopelessness out of the kid if it was the very last thing he did.)
“Is it, though? I mean, this stuff,” he gestures at the sodden pile of documents on the desk with ink-covered hands, “this is all my life is going to be from now on. I’m Spider-Man. I’ll live that way. I’ll die that way, probably young and tragically. I won’t do anything else in between, because everyone knows who I am, so that means finishing high school’s out. College too, by the way, to answer your question. The only places who want to take me now are just using me. Some for my name, some for Tony’s. Some of them for both. So forgive me if spilling energy drink on the only semblance of a future I—HEY!”
They landed on the bed shortly after that, Steve’s hands making shockingly quick work of the web of buttons, zips and ties that were Tony’s formalwear. Tony wanted to return the favour, but got only as far as removing the jacket of Steve’s suit before his hands were abruptly halted and held high above his head.
“In the later years of his life, probably fueled by his failed efforts to ensure his son would never be oriented, Howard became obsessed with the idea that work could be a longer term cure for orientation. He funded a study, which wasn’t completed until after he died, trying to prove that extending the workday and making minimal allowances for orientational absences or delays would eventually lead subjects to be able to self-stabilize their cortisol and Dominin or subtonin levels. Instead, the study found that even the standard workday was enough to have a substantially negative impact on levels. Most people who don’t engage in any orientational activities after they leave home are actually in moderate dep by the time the workday ends. Stark Industries has known for decades that either shortening the workday or providing some kind of program like Wakanda’s is important and necessary for people’s health, and they suppressed that knowledge. Or at least the person who signed off on the report after Howard’s death and subsequently buried its findings has.”
“Could you, uh—could you do me a favour? Could you just…keep talking? Not, I don’t mean, I’m not asking for intel or anything sensitive. Just, I just want—”
tone. Are you alright?” Tony blinked. (Barnes had shown less concern when he’d watched Tony nearly beaten to death.)
But the further away they got from the scene, the worse the feeling in Steve’s gut became. He still couldn’t put a precise finger on what was concerning him, but his mind kept returning to the way Tony had fought him at the beginning of their scene, and to the team’s descriptions of what they had taken to calling his ‘dark days,’ when Tony would wake up withdrawn and angry, resisting the Dominance for all he was worth. Not only was this complete shift too sudden, but it just plain wasn’t Tony. He might not face the same degree of resentment toward submission that his counterpart from this universe had, but it would never be an easy or a simple thing for him.
Tony, and the thought of allowing this new version to take his place as if he’d never been there didn’t sit right with Steve.
There are some new #AskStrange responses up, so if you're interested in that aspect of the story you may want to start there!
Steve said her name then, in warning and alarm and out of reflex, because gags had been a very hard limit of the other Tony’s. He hadn’t minded the rest of the team using them around him, but even as some of his other needs and desires had shifted over the course of their relationship, Tony had remained steadfastly against being gagged under any circumstances. Natasha ignored Steve, and the rest of the team who were by now avidly watching what was unfolding, until she had settled the pillow in front of one of the long white couches, and placed the rest of the supplies she had gathered next to her.
It was no small part of Steve that wanted to keep putting this off, to just keep watching Tony sunbathing naked and content next to Bruce and deal with everything else another time. They did, after all, have weeks.
when the Hulk dropped him off in the living room where Coulson was waiting, as promised. To his everlasting credit, Phil didn’t even blink at any of it, not even when Hulk instructed him not to allow Tony to kneel at all that day. Coulson thanked him, polite and calm as ever, and then sent Hulk off to the kitchen where he promised a hefty pile of leftovers from the night before would be up for grabs.
“So it’ll be most effective if we have something to compare this with that’s more the norm. People’s Dominin, subtonin, and cortisol levels when they’re home versus when they’ve been at work for eight hours without any kind of orientational interaction. People like numbers when there’s not too many of them, so you’re going to have an easier time persuading the people who need persuading if you can say, for instance, that people’s cortisol levels are x percent lower when they have the chance to voluntarily Dominate or submit during the workday than when they don’t. I swear I’ve seen something like this before, I just can’t think of where.”
Tony!” the blonde boomed, beaming and holding his arms up in celebratory greeting. (And if the aborted attempt at a more possessive greeting was slightly awkward, it was worth it for the fact that it got the damn Bites out of his face.)
He threw himself into preparations for the pilot program, which would be pretty much ready to go as soon as matters with SI were resolved. There was a particularly complex inter-agency mission in Brazil that Steve ended up needing to personally oversee; Clint’s young protégé, Kate Bishop, had gotten herself involved, and Steve’s vouching for her (at Clint’s increasingly vocal insistence) was the only thing preventing her from being detained by at least two governments and three separate agencies. He made time to seek out Sharon Carter, too. She was tight-lipped about her relationship with Pepper, but she had seemed too relax once Steve wasn’t there to gossip, just to reassure Sharon that her presence at the Tower was wholly welcome.
Clint didn’t give any indication he’d even heard Tony’s outburst, not until a hand closed around Tony’s cock. Not squeezing, not moving enough to provide him with any real friction. Just holding it. His hips hitched, and instantly the warm grip was gone. Tony whined—fucking whined, like some desperate, over-eager teenager—and Clint was leaning over him.
“He uh…he started refusing to charge. After. So I brought him upstairs to Stevie, told ‘em they had to take care of each other. Turned out their stubbornness was about equal to each other’s, which I didn’t think was possible on either side. Think they mighta saved each other’s lives, to be honest.” Barnes bowed his head, gripping the edge of the workbench for support. “Sorry. This isn’t. It was not an easy time.”
Except that none of it felt familiar, not entirely. The news of Tony’s absence had brought a different energy to the room. Everyone was a slightly subdued version of their usual selves, just a bit too quiet and polite and still for it to feel like a regular movie night. Steve did his best to bring the mood up, but it was like someone had taken away the vibrant colours that normally painted their group dynamics and replaced them with muted, dull shades that could never compare. Finally, mercifully, Phil paused the movie and turned to stare at Bruce, who was cradling a container of Tony’s stupid expensive popcorn like it was a child or a chest of treasure, with narrowed eyes.
He didn’t realize how long the impromptu pop-quiz had been going on until three things happened in quick succession. First, the cell phone alarm Liz had set to signal the end of the meeting went off. This broke the almost meditative state that the rhythmic back-and-forth of the question and answer session had brought to Peter, forcing him to pay attention to his immediate surroundings. It was when he found out that every member of the decathlon team staring at Peter like they had never seen him before. Hurriedly he stood up, shoving his chair backward a little too hard. The resulting thud as it collided with a nearby bookshelf was a welcome distraction from the near-run at which he left the library.
“I should explain,” Thor boomed cheerfully, correctly reading the look of complete bewilderment that Tony wasn’t even bothering to hide. “While I cannot myself summon rain, it often naturally follows after I call for the thunder, as do high winds whose direction I can control. So I am, on occasion, called out to assist when forest fires threaten to become out of control.”
As he was vaguely considering the merits of making a third pot of coffee, Tony felt something warm against his left wrist. He looked down to find Thor’s watch. It still looked perfectly innocuous, but it was…yeah, the thing was definitely giving off a low level of heat. Gold really shouldn’t be able to do that, so even with Thor’s assurances about the magic of Asgardian metal fresh in his mind, Tony nearly took the science-defying thing off.
“I could kill you with my pinky, Barton,” Bucky mumbled in a slurred, lazy tone that was about as threatening as the kitten Hulk had once rescued from a tree. Steve was caught between amusement and a deeper, almost painful kind of gratitude that this was really the kind of scene that could just greet him now.
The same astounding tears that Tony remembered seeing on Nat’s face in the aftermath of her scene with Bucky and Clint were back, this time as a steady stream rather than a set of frustrated bursts. He wondered if maybe Natasha could only ever let herself go enough to do something like cry during or immediately after scenes, and then he felt a sick swoop of guilt at the idea that his presence had perhaps left her wondering if that outlet would be available to her anymore.
“May I place my burdens in your hands for safe-keeping, ma’am? So that I may be committed and focused on nothing but my submission to you?” Coulson’s voice, his endlessly steady, bordering-on-robotic voice, was trembling with meaning as he asked the questions he’d so obviously asked numerous times before. It had felt like the right thing, then, to turn away, but Tony just couldn’t force himself to tear his eyes from the scene. For as gentle and soft and vulnerable as Phil appeared in this moment, Natasha was doubly so, her usually inscrutable expression an easily-readable palette of affection and warmth and comfort.
The reminder of Barnes and Cap is a useful and well-timed one. It had all been starting to sound kind of tempting. The science behind the orientations alone must be fascinating, and the thought of learning it all with Bruce at his side, like the Science Bro olden days before Bruce had left and come back inexplicably BFF with Thor? Amazing. And while Tony had never been particularly interested in the spying end of things, it was still such a novelty to have Clint look at him with anything but anger, and Natasha with something other than regret, that even those lessons had had a certain kind of appeal. But when Steve found out Tony was even farther from what he’d wanted? He’d probably throw him out of the Tower personally, with Barnes’ help.
“It’s not about that, not at all. There are a lot of ways that aren’t related to sex for a Dom to care for your body, though, and makin’ sure you’re in shape is one of ‘em. I’m not remotely worried about your strength, I know the kinds of muscle that making and using the suit requires. But I’d like a better sense of your stamina and endurance so that I know what areas we should be working on.”
“Phil has Tony designing a top secret training module that even he doesn’t know the details of. And I wasn’t cheating, Thor, simply…gathering relevant data. It’s hardly my fault you’re all brawn.” Reflexively, Tony winced; Thor’s once ridiculous ego had taken such a massive hit following the series of catastrophic setbacks he’d faced that such a joke would have been in extremely poor taste in Tony’s world. Here, though, Thor just laughed and threw a colourful knitted potholder at Bruce’s head.
“I am genuinely sorry to interrupt a development I had no way of knowing about. And I can try to make this quick, but you also know that if you force me to leave he is not going to take it well, regardless of what headspace he’s in.” Clint glared, but probably more for the sake of it than anything else. He knew she was right.
It's so fun to be back in this verse in a more consistent way! Thank you so much for sticking with me, and for your comments and kudos You can also free to let me know if you have AskStrange questions!
“Don’t go into it trying to tell me the whole story. Break it down into small pieces, as minuscule as you need. Start by telling me one thing about that day. It can be anything at all and ideally shouldn’t be anything particularly meaningful. What pajamas you were wearing when you woke up, what you ate for breakfast, anything.”
“Steve.” Domen brought two fingers up to pinch at her nose, and seemed to struggle with herself for several seconds. “You and I have talked a couple of times about some of the patterns you have exhibited during grieving thus far. We’re working on your tendencies to compare and idealize, and that’s going to get us a long way. But we also need to confront and name the outcome of those processes when they go unchecked. Not because I want to shame or embarrass you, but because my impression is that I don’t think you’ve ever been totally honest with yourself about this particular aspect of your psyche.”
An unexpected jealousy flared at the mention of Rhodes and Pepper. It wasn’t that Steve had ever had a problem with either of them before, but once Tony had gotten together with the team, they’d ended up growing apart. With this Tony, they were something essential, relationships that far exceeded that of an old college buddy or a brief flirtation-turned-CEO. Nat had reported that Tony had permitted them, and only them, to be with him when he’d broken down during Steve’s absence, and now he was turning to them for advice about sex and submission…
“Nah, I prefer that all elevator action be purely consensual, and preferably not happen until the third date unless I’m on some kind of mission-related clock. Now get in before Dummy decides I’m treating him to an evening of delights instead.” Tony’s traitorous bot beeped hopefully.
“Afraid he’s right, sweetheart. You were non-verbal for pretty much the entire day of the scene, and some of the next morning. You came up part way through breakfast mainly because you felt a very desperate urge to tell Thor his hair was pretty. ”
“What? No, I can’t leave this guy, I just wanted to know if you had any tips about fighting invisible people. Like maybe some kind of setting on the AI you insisted on putting in the suit.” Given that the tech had been one of Tony’s only real demands, Peter had figured he’d be thrilled to get to show it off rather than trying to rush Peter off the scene midway through a battle.
By the time his session with Coulson had finished, Tony had been more than a little hot and bothered. Instead of letting him take the edge off, though, Coulson handed him off to Rhodey, who wanted to eat lunch with Tony before taking off for a couple of days. He was well used to the other version of Rhodey coming and going, but the few days had allowed him to forget that his friend had commitments beyond Tony and the Avengers. His attempts to convince Rhodey to stay, however, were as unsuccessful as they usually were.
“MOVE, Tony!” As it turned out, Bruce missed both Thor and Tony by several feet in his halfway-successful attempt at a landing, but didn’t quite manage to avoid colliding with the (now understandably) padded wall. And when Bruce lifted the faceplate, he looked decidedly green…and not in a Hulk-out kind of way. “Ugh. The G forces are unbelievable. I need a break for some water and some time on solid ground.”
Movie night with Bucky and Steve turned out to be…kind of awesome. Tony was skeptical of the whole thing at first, and very nearly made his excuses after assuring himself of Steve’s wellness with his own eyes. But Barnes had looked so confident and comfortable on the floor in front of Steve; Tony usually liked the way his teammates’ submissive selves contrasted with their baseline ways of being in the world, but there was something deeply appealing about how entirely himself Bucky was then. He was on his knees, but he thought nothing of reaching up to cover Steve’s mouth or throw popcorn at his head, and he was surprisingly quick-witted and biting with his commentary on the movie they’d chosen.
Naturally, it couldn’t last. People began to trickle in, slowly at first and then in greater numbers as word apparently got out that Captain America was tearing apart the gym. Pictures and video were, thankfully, forbidden in most areas of SHIELD HQ, a rule everyone had quickly learned to respect when Natasha and Clint had started hunting violators from the vents, stealing their phones and downloading images of their most vicious ops as warnings. So it was mostly a lot of staring and whispering at first. Then Alex, a 32 year old Dominance-oriented switch with documented ego problems and a hint of a death wish had challenged Steve to a match in the full-sized wrestling ring that dominated the centre of the room.
“You’re fine. It’s a ritual, Tony, just like some of the others you’ve seen us practice. You’re not being set up to fail here. You’re not going to make me angry, and you can’t do it wrong.”
Yes, it was occasionally hard to concentrate when Tony did things like smile. Or start in on one of his signature monologues. Or when he called Steve’s couch his own and started consistently using the same coaster (a glass-blown piece in yellow and blue that Ella from Steve’s art class had gifted him) to put his drinks on. But the thing was that even despite all that, they still
“Get. Out.” Before, during his breakdown over all that he’d left behind, Tony had at least felt guilty for shutting the team out. And he definitely should have felt something about ejecting them from their own gym given that he doesn’t technically own this version of the Tower. But any excess stores of emotional energy he might have devoted to those ventures were all being burned through, feeding the all-consuming rage that was nearly suffocating him. It was anger like he’d never quite known before, like choking on bile or acid, something that burned on its way up and bubbled and burned at the insides of his mouth and throat. Even Rhodey gave up his attempts to linger after the fourth time Tony barked at him. “J, what did your Tony do when he was pissed and unable or unwilling to leave the Tower?” Truth was, Tony didn’t expect much to come of the request. Wasn’t like Mark 2 had had much to be angry about anyway as far as Tony could see. The guy had had everything: a Thanos-free existence, a public that genuinely seemed to admire him, a team that—
“Just giving you time to enjoy it, darling. Stop worrying about where we’re going and just be where we are.”
“Mr. Parker. Peter.” Hearing Strange say his first name was almost as weird as the dead man who had just spoken to Peter from another dimension. “I realize this is a lot to digest. If you don’t have questions now I can certainly make time to return, though I will be off planet for—”
“Oh that’s lovely, sweetheart. God the sight you make. Wearing my sweater and that sexy fucking underwear, why do I ever look at anything but you, huh?” There was a gritty tone to Steve’s voice that Tony had long since learned always meant sex, and sure enough his Dominant was palming himself as he watched Tony on the floor at his feet.
“If he is in any way permanently damaged,” Natasha said, pressing her blade still closer to Taskmaster’s neck, “I assure you that you will personally beg me for death. Tell me what you wanted out of all of this. Your recruits aren’t going anywhere, and don’t seem to have any particular target they’re trying to achieve.”
“It’s not that I even disagree, but I was right there! You couldn’t have given me a heads up?” she demanded as she slid her shoes off and let them fall carelessly onto the floor of the towncar.
going to have you or anyone tell those kids they’re wrong then they're not. I won’t be responsible for them learning not to trust their instincts. Show me what I need to see so that I can tell them what I think they need to hear.” Strange rolled his eyes, which Tony was starting to think was maybe just a reflex on Strange’s part the same way that inappropriate jokes and fake smiles were for Tony, but he made some kind of motion with his ring, vanished, and then returned seconds later with an affirming nod.
As always, your comments and kudos are so valued, and are a huge source of motivation and excitement. (And you can, of course, #AskStrange about any outstanding questions you might have, too!)
“My submissive still gets asked about the one I made for her all the time,” he’d explained. “Someone offered us a lot of money for it, actually, back when he had almost nothing. But I told her that I could never bear to see her collar around someone else’s neck, and she said I’d better just open by own shop then, so that everyone could know what it was like to have a collar made just for them.”
Peter made a valiant attempt to swat at the alarm. He wasn’t precisely sure when he would have bought an old fashioned alarm to begin with when he had a perfectly good phone, but morning was not a time for questions. Morning was a time for sleeping.
“You’re very welcome to be here as long as you like, James. Actually, we were going to wait until Tony was back to bring this up, but we were wondering…look, I know your dynamic with Tony isn’t romantic or sexual, but he clearly does well in your hands, and if you don’t mind me sayin’, you seem a lot more relaxed too. We’d be happy to have you around more, with full permission to act as a Dom for Tony whenever you both want or need. And as long as we wouldn’t be taking you away from anyone else—God, I don’t even know if you’re seeing someone. I’m sorry, I’m a little scattered, I think.” Rhodes shifted in his seat, and seemed to look everywhere but at Steve for a few moments. (Steve had never once seen the guy flustered before. It was kind of unnerving.)
“It isn’t that. Or at least it mostly isn’t. You’ve turned SHIELD into something incredible, something so much better than it ever had the chance to be if you…hadn’t been involved. But to most of you these kids are either resources or targets, people to either be brought in or brought down. And I hate it, Steve. I really fucking hate it.”
Phil was a pragmatist, and a man who preferred uncomfortable, even horrifying knowledge, to ignorance. But there was no good that could come of the way his brain offered up an excruciating image of Steve’s shield cracking its way into Tony’s chest, splitting it apart after all the work Tony had done to piece it back together…it was the least Steve-like thing Coulson had ever heard, and it took him down bizarre paths of wondering if their Rogers had been replaced by a skrull, or was facing some kind of insidious new mind control. (For their sake, he almost hoped that was the case.)
His own annoyance is nothing, though, to the reactions of the other people in the room. Peter is practically radiating fury, his arms crossed over his chest, his face dotted with red splotches. Steve looks like he’s about to double over.
him!” he yelled at Tony. “I’ve been closing in on the Vulture for ages, you don’t get to just fly in at the last minute and play the hero! It’s not fair!” The burst of frustrated, uncontrolled rage felt both too young and too old for the boy standing in front of Steve; for seconds that felt endless, he was reminded viscerally of the other version of Tony, whose very adult pain and fury had often felt to Steve like the cry of a wounded child.
I feel your first question shall be better answered through a brief view into the minds of one of the individuals you mentioned. Here it is:
“I said you’re right. I think I need to think on it, maybe bring it up with Dr. Domen in our next session. But I appreciate your perspective Tony, and the fact that you’ll come right out and say the kinds of things other people might try to keep back, or at least sugar coat. I love you very much.”
“I really, really want to. You have no idea how much.” The ‘but’ was audible in every word, and in the suddenly defeated slump of Tony’s shoulder’s. “You could still hurt me so badly, and so easily. You can hurt me like no one else can, and I’m not sure I can take anymore. I’m so tired Steve. I’m tired and I want—I think I want to rest now more than I want anything else. Even you.”
Rescue’s helmet swerved back and forth between Pepper and Tony as if the suit were struggling to decide whose side of the dispute it was supposed to be on. Steve sympathized. His own suspicions about who had been funding Taskmaster’s army were identical to Tony’s, but hearing the smartest man he knew confirm them made it all real. Once again, someone was threatening the life of the man Steve loved. He wanted to lock Tony up in the Tower with the entire team to protect him in precisely the same way it sounded like Tony wished to do to Pepper. (And what had he meant about losing her before? Clearly they still hadn’t covered everything that had happened in Tony’s home universe.)
“And what do you think, Widow?” Natasha flinched at the use of her code-name, but she didn’t take her hand away. (It felt like Natalie Rushman all over again, like he was dying and she was the only one who could see.)
(I would say more, and perhaps offer a vision, but I would suggest that the chapter immediately coming up will likely highlight these exact areas. Non-sexual submission has a very particular way of illustrating to Stark how much his life has fundamentally changed, and how much the team’s knowledge of him extends beyond just what occurs in the bedroom.)
After the bath, he slathered Tony in expensive moisturizer and some kind of oil. He was fairly sure he’d heard Clint mention using something similar on Bucky when he’d seen the two of them after a particularly intense scene, but given that there wasn’t a mark on Tony, Steve was undoubtedly being overcautious. (Tony’s pointing this out was greeted with a calm agreement on Steve’s part, even as he squeezed another helping of oil into his palms.) There were also a lot of…well they weren’t quite orders, but directions on Steve’s part. They were incredibly simple things, stuff that it would have been irritating to be directed to do if he were at baseline.
Steve thought of every time he’d seen the other Tony after a mission that had involved children going wrong. Tony never took his own perceived failures well, but with kids…well, Wanda had known precisely what she was doing when she’d fabricated a child for Tony to save. Losing kids he hadn’t even known had nearly destroyed Tony every time; he would drink for days, or try to goad the nearest person into a violent round of fighting or fucking. Even once their relationship had matured and stabilized, those occasions had always been the ones where Steve had most feared they might lose Tony.
Steve had hoped, maybe even been sure enough of it to assume, that with enough time and mentorship Talia would reach this level of confidence and comfort in her own skin within SHIELD. And perhaps that was still true. Would it be worth the struggle and distress it would almost assuredly cause Talia when there was an option that seemed so much more organic and simple for her, though?
“Something the matter, Cap? I figured between Rhodes hanging around more and Tony bein’ back you wouldn’t need much air support, but I can still be there in a couple hours if you need—”
“Ask you what?” he tried, then sighed as Talia greeted the attempt with nothing but silence that somehow managed to sound irritated. (She was learning way too much from Masdee.) “You sound happy, Talia. Are you happy? Do you think—that is, if I hadn’t offered this program, do you think you still could have been this happy, somewhere down the line?”
“JARVIS, stop the footage.” Normally, the AI didn’t reply to simple commands unless the user requested confirmation, but he vocalized quiet agreement in addition to clearing the screen. Steve made a miserable moaning sound and buried his face in his hands. Phil was almost relieved to see the break in his almost robotic facade of a few seconds ago.
“’s fine, Pep.” He was appalled to hear the way his voice slurred, especially because it made Pepper look even more regretful.
Clearly they had been in a hurry last night. The thought was enough to pierce through the veil of self-pity covering Peter, leaving behind the sour taste of shame instead. How could he have done this? As if they all didn’t have enough going on without dealing with an enhanced, drunken teenager? How was he ever going to be able to look any of them in the face again?
Somewhere in the middle of Steve’s rambled plea, Bucky’s restraining grasp had turned into more of an embrace. (For the briefest and most shameful seconds of his life, he hated the other man for not being Tony Stark.)
) submissive being in such acute distress without support. “Things in his world…went really fuckin’ differently. I don’t know exactly when they diverged; from what I could gather the Battle of Manhattan was almost identical. But somehow, some way, in their world Thanos got a hand on these—stone, things.”
“I wish we could just be honest about this with the public, Tony, I really do. But orientation here, it’s physical, it’s biochemical, it’s social, it shapes absolutely everything. And submissives, especially like yo—like him, they’re regarded incredibly highly. The love people had for him…it wasn’t just because he was a sub, of course it wasn’t, but that mattered. It mattered enough that I don’t know that we could get them to accept that not only are you from an alternate universe, but that this fundamental thing they knew about you isn’t true anymore.” Pepper tempered the blow of learning that he’d be spending the rest of his days pretending to be someone else by voluntarily refilling his glass. Tony drank most of it down in a single pull, even while reminding himself that, as booze had hardly been an option after the Snap, he’d have to slow it down and quickly unless he wanted to be far too drunk for this conversation entirely too quickly.
My beta, lou2, is always amazing. But I want to say an especially huge thanks for her work with this chapter. She gets Steve in a way I am only aspire to, and her comments and critique made everything involving him SO much better.
Peter had therefore looked forward to a peaceful night surrounded by nothing but the occasional whirs and beeps he assumed originated from the various servers and fans that kept FRIDAY and her systems running. Instead, the absence of sensory overload seemed to send his brain into a state of complete disarray. After tossing and turning for hours, his ears seeking out nonexistent noise and trying to form a narrative out of it, he’d given up and hopped on the group chat that he shared with Ned and MJ. Neither of them were up, but it was soothing enough to catch up on their chatter about homework and the latest atrocities offered by the cafeteria. Every once in a while, one of them asked Peter a question too.
. While this had turned out not to be the case, she was still someone Steve counted as among SHIELD and the UN’s most trusted and valuable allies. He sat down at the front of the tent they had all gathered in with a wave, which Masdee returned with a stiff nod before gesturing toward digital projections of two young men. They looked to be no older than thirty, features nearly identical down to an elaborate series of piercings and markings that wrapped up the left sides of their necks.
“I swear to Thor and all his relatives that if you are ratting me out about that damn muffin right now I will sell you for parts.”
“Steve’s going to be out of town dealing with that business with the UN for a few days. But eventually he
“Well that’s a fucking first.” He remembered another Strange, raising a single finger in the air, confirming the worst of Tony’s fears about the path forward. He’d been sympathetic too, all the bravado he’d had about sacrificing anyone to save the time stone vanished. Much more than the reminder of what he’d said about there only being one future where the team triumphed over Thanos, it had been seeing that look on Strange’s face that had made Tony sure of what was coming.
The thought of taking full ownership for everything the Soldier had done was…well, more than Bucky could take. It filled his veins with ice, made him feel like something toxic that should be contained to one of the bright, carefully marked bins down in Tony and Bruce’s labs.
Tony has long since learned that sometimes his Dad’s questions are a trap, and this definitely felt like one of those times. Because before now, Tony would have said he thought it sounded kind of nice, the way that different orientations worked together, making individuals stronger together than they were apart. The thought of knowing someone that way, being known in return, he was too young to really know much about the details of what it would entail, but as a concept, the notion that there might be someone out there like that for him had been a comforting fiction on the many days and nights he spent mostly on his own.
Tony was, it transpired, despite all his visual acuity, kind of useless with geography. When he put an entire country in the wrong place for the third time, Clint held a hand out for the pad of paper looking slightly pained. He took an eraser to the entire middle of section of Tony’s sketch, and began re-drawing the boundaries. His tongue stuck out of his mouth when he was thinking, which Tony didn’t actually think people did in real life, but it somehow made perfect sense on Clint.
“It would be extremely difficult, and I would have to consult with my counterpart as to the consequences. It is challenging enough magic to explore the potential futures of my own universe; doing so in another is difficult enough to debilitate me for weeks. However, I do know that there are futures where you depart this universe for your home, and while I think you many things, Stark, I do not believe you would be so irresponsible as to make such a choice if the risk it posed to that world was too great.” Everything and everyone he had tried desperately not to think of since he’d tumbled into this universe all surfaced with crushing ferocity. Pepper would pretend not to have been crying, just as she always did; Rhodey, by contrast, would unashamedly cry like a baby while holding onto Tony so tightly it would border on strangulation. Peter…god, he had no idea what Peter would do, probably make a terrible movie reference and then awkwardly try to decide whether or not to hug Tony, until Tony took the decision out of the kid’s hands and held him, longer and tighter than he’d been able to do on the battlefield. “It would, however, be a one-way trip,” Strange added.
The corners of Natasha’s lips lifted into a rare, approving smile, and she went back to her reading without any further commentary.
“Headspace and endorphins can work in multiple, and sometimes conflicting, ways when it comes to pain. For someone really into pain, or extremely deep into headspace, they might not feel the full extent of the damage until after they’re back down. For others, or sometimes for those less inclined toward pain for its own sake, the body can register it as far more severe than it really is during the scene.” While Tony pondered this, Bruce dipped into his bag and came up with a set of gloves and a small packet of lubricant. “I’m going to give you a quick internal exam, Tony, is that alright?”
Shawarma, Steve decided, was the best food that this century’s New York had to offer. Now, to be fair, it was possible that some of this was his super-metabolism talking, stretched to its limits by the battle they’d just fought and desperate for any kind of sustenance. However, he would loudly proclaim to anyone who would listen that this wasn’t the whole of the matter; it was just damn good food. He was too hungry to try to catalogue the range of flavours that coated the meat, but he knew enough to know it was seasoned to perfection, and roasted perfectly. It came with a sauce, too, something Natasha said was called tahini. It tasted like lemon and sesame and if he hadn’t had an audience, Steve could easily have polished off a tub of the stuff.
“You need to stay right here and hang out with us,” Natasha decreed. As she was perhaps the most sober all of them, she managed to make this sound highly authoritative. “You can start whatever your plan is for dealing with Tony tomorrow. I’ll even help if you want.”
Truthfully, the last thing Tony really wanted was to be forced to eat a large meal in front of Natasha (and potentially the press), and he felt a vague twinge of disappointment. (He must have been wrong about them having picked up on that particular aspect of his food issues.)
), and wound through the innumerable sketches and chemical formulas and testing data that dotted the screens. It was all practical stuff, because that was how probably every version of Tony Stark best knew how to demonstrate attachment to someone, but the detail, the sheer volume, the attention to comfort as well as efficiency and effectiveness…the guy might as well have doodled his initials and the team’s and surrounded them all with a big heart.
Many of these are areas I have touched on in a previous response, so it may be worth reviewing that material. You can find it here under Chapter Six here on the collected replies (the second answer down.)
“The timeline for going public is going to have to move up. The spyware you put on our rogue board members found an open memo they’re planning to release early next week. It puts Stark Industries in open conflict with Steve over this program he’s starting at SHIELD, and it explicitly invokes your—well, our Tony’s name and memory to do so. If we don’t want to be bogged down with weeks of headlines about you two being in conflict, which will harm both SHIELD and SI immeasurably, I think we need to come out ahead of this thing.”
Conversation flowed relatively easily, too. Phil, Tony, and Natasha were all clearly skilled at filling any silences that became too lengthy, but it didn’t feel like a forced kind of intimacy. Some of the questions were the same basic, eye-rolley ones teenagers at any social gathering with adults got asked, but it never felt like an interrogation. And they all offered some pretty great tips and anecdotes about the superhero gig, too. Peter was able to be open about what he did with May and Tony now, but this was different. This was a whole room of people just like Peter. For once, he didn’t feel like the odd one out. How could he when Clint was in the middle of a lengthy rant about the various substances aliens tended to ooze?
“I. I have his exploratory contract, and the combined notes we’ve made about his submission so far. It’s—well, it’s a lot, even with all of the sexual material blacked out. Please call or text if you have questions or if you need
Strategically, it definitely would have been the best choice. Letting them witness how this version of the suit worked meant that Tony was losing a very significant tactical advantage he had over them should things ever turn ugly here the way they had in his own universe. And really, why would they want to watch Tony have what was ultimately going to be a very elaborate temper tantrum?
“Oh just promise to send some extra money toward their hockey teams and maple syrup and they’ll be eating out of your hand.”
“And yet look at how deeply and completely you care for your son, after not but a few years. You defeated fate for him, Tony Stark, stood against Gods and men and the forces of the universe itself. How could you still then wonder if the pain of the loss is worth what it is to be loved in such a way?”
“I going to. I have to—” Those were all the words Steve managed to grate out before he took off down the hall at a run. He didn’t quite make it to his planned destination; the sound of him vomiting spectacularly on the hardwood floor echoed through the entire penthouse. Then they spent another agonizing two minutes in silence while they listened to running water and the sounds of Steve brushing his teeth.
, coupled with the fierce, enveloping ache he’d left behind with the strap was impossible. Tony would never survive it. He thrashed and tugged at the leg straps, and against Rhodey’s hands, shaking his head frantically.
Thank you so much for your continued kudos and comments on this story. I absolutely love hearing from you, and am eager to find out what you thought of this chapter. Fave moments/lines? Questions? Rants? I love them all!
“Are those—boomerangs, somehow?” Peter couldn’t help but ask after watching the third one nearly clip Tony in the head. “Why?”
There's a pretty important #AskStrange response coming later this week, so keep an eye out for that too!
Thor, meanwhile, was practically vibrating with ill-concealed excitement. He couldn’t even speak beyond a series of jerky nods that made pretty much everyone laugh fondly. They really couldn’t have picked a more perfect person for Tony to try this little experiment with, Steve mused; Thor’s generosity was as boundless as his enthusiasm, which meant there was pretty much no risk that he’d somehow make Tony feel like he was getting Domination ‘wrong.’ And Steve had yet to see anything Tony couldn’t do with his hands; he’d probably love perfecting the technique involved in Shibari.
Bruce always asked permission for this part. Sometimes Tony said no, and both the AI and his partner always respected it. (Mostly he said yes. This was an important one for Bruce, he knew.) He gave his assent, and JARVIS flashed a caloric value as well as an itemized list of everything Tony had managed to eat the day before. It wasn’t much, about half of the goal Bruce had set, but again Bruce betrayed no reaction beyond a nod and another scribble.
“Curling?” Peter guessed. She stuck her tongue, covered in sprinkles and pink frosting , out at him, and he laughed. (It was the first time Tony had heard honest laughter come out of this version of the kid.) Everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and shortly thereafter Tony was able to convince everyone to relocate to the living room, which was both less cramped and lacking in the formal connotations of sitting around a table. May complimented Tony’s choice in coffee—which, yeah, he’d cheated a little by using a roast he knew she’d liked in the other universe, but he was taking every advantage he could get in this conversation—and chatted with Natasha about her dress, but Tony knew better than to relax. He’d done this with May Parker once before, and while many of the details were different, she was not one to have only half a conversation, shrinking away from the things that were hard or uncomfortable.
“So he’s not saying no,” Clint summarized, “he’s just saying he doesn’t know what exactly his ‘yes’ is going to entail just yet.” Natasha stood up for a drink refill Coulson was certain she didn’t really need in order to drop a kiss on Clint’s head on her way by. It had taken Clint so long to start speaking up during conversations like this, whether at SHIELD or in their home. He had been so used to being looked down on or dismissed that he’d opted either to play the role of class clown, or to stay silent altogether. Slowly, though, as Phil and the others had put the work in to show him how valuable his insights were, he’d started to speak up more and more. Phil loved him fiercely then, and felt grateful to remember that even with the future with Tony so uncertain.
“I hope so,” she replied. English, just to add insult to the injury that was the Black Widow and the Winter Soldier surrounded on all sides by evidence of all that had once been forbidden to them: domesticity, camaraderie, love. He nodded just once and turned away before they drew anyone else’s attention to the small addition she’d made, and Natasha longed for him as fiercely and deeply then as she had once longed for a beautiful, shining vase in a darkened hallway.
“Fuck yeah!” Impulsively, Tony leaned up to press a kiss to the tip of Bucky’s nose, just to see his eyes cross slightly as he laughed.
“I just think we need to review now that we have more to go on,” he explained to a decidedly displeased team who was eager to drink and rant. Only Steve seemed to be in quiet agreement; the only thing that halted his almost manic glee about his and Tony’s decision to involve themselves romantically these days was the merest mention of the Soul Stone, especially what it had been used to do to the Tony of their own universe.
The concern, however, was that if the hormone didn’t leave his system, or even continued to rise for a short time after his departure, then the effects on Stark would have been unpredictable and potentially quite severe. It is possible, for instance, that being Dominated by someone in his own universe who lacks the biochemical and physiological aspects of the identity would not be enough to lower his cortisol levels, and Dr. Banner explained the significant risks involved with that kind of elevation over the long term.
“They’ll heal faster than anyone can treat ‘em. You know that. Can you just…can you clear a path to the elevator? I can’t…I just can’t see him right now, please.”
His grip on her hand had tightened to what must have been the point of pain during his rambling request, but she held on just as tightly, never once turning her eyes from his.
Tony woke with his worst hangover in recent memory. He’d forgotten exactly how dry his mouth could get, and the way his head didn’t just steadily ache but pulsed with pain, especially when scotch was involved. And to make matters worse, Dummy was zooming around the room and…those beeps were almost rhythmic. Was he doing the bot equivalent of humming?
“JARVIS says you have questions. About Ultron.” Tony laughed, but nothing like the way he did when he found something actually funny. It was a harsh, raspy, ugly sound that Steve hated instantly.
“No apologies necessary. Really. Captain America was used as a symbol for so many things when I was under the ice. Some of it I would have agreed with, a lot of it I wouldn’t have. It’s…it’s really nice to know those comics helped build connections between our parts of the world, even before anyone knew Wakanda existed. Thank you.” Angzata nodded stiffly, apparently too embarrassed by his candour to speak further on the topic, but after giving himself another visible shake, he addressed himself to Steve again.
“I assume you want at least one of us with you to monitor you both, given the murkiness of consent here?” Steve nodded gratefully. “It should be someone he’s scened with already. That rules out myself, unfortunately, and I think Clint is still too close to submissive headspace right now for him to be a good option.”
“What the f—Dummy? What are you doing out of the shop? Did—you brought a fire extinguisher. Fucking hell you beautiful, ridiculous hunk of circuits.” The bot spun in rapid circles, emitting a series of beeps that could only be described as robotic squeals. Then he dropped the fire extinguisher with a loud clang and used his claw to yank the blankets unceremoniously from Tony’s body, leaving him in nothing but a pair of green silk boxers that weren’t his own.
Given these social influences, it can be possible for some parents to predict with a certain degree of accuracy how their child will eventually be classified. However, especially given the fine distinctions in degrees when it comes to switch identities especially, it is usually easiest for parents of those on the highest and lowest ends of the scales to predict how their child will eventually be classified.
And thanks to you, too, wonderful readers! I never stop looking forward to your comments, kudos, and questions, which are always generous and thoughtful. You’re the best!
Another disjointed set of images and memories offered themselves up, this time of the universe he was in now. Dancing with Steve; the team sparring with such joy and unity; Bruce’s steady, careful hands during check-ins; the way it felt to be on his knees, trusting them to hold him steady and take away his responsibilities and worries until he could carry them again; their unwavering faith, the way the team never looked at him or one another with the kind of wariness and caution that had always coloured how the Avengers in his own universe interacted with each other by the end.
, “vanished in the Snap. Was just me and one other person—well, android technically I think, anyway the ship I’d come in on got stranded. We drifted through space for…well, let’s just say long enough for food to become a pretty big issue.” Unable to look at any of them, not wanting to see the pity or sadness or whatever they might be directing his way, Tony scarfed down the remains of his breakfast. He tried to hand the damn orange wedge that had started all of this to Rhodey; they’d always stolen food from one another, for fuck’s sake, he didn’t want that to be something else that was taken away from him. But Rhodey guided it back to Tony’s own mouth and held it there.
The fatalism of that sounded entirely too familiar, and Steve growled, protective Dominance rising to the surface with such sudden force it took even him by surprise. He wanted to scoop Tony up and barricade them away from the world, shield Tony even from himself. (If he was feeling this low Steve would find him help, he would get the best professionals in the world in the Tower by tomorrow…)
With Peter well-occupied (Clint Barton, she suspected, was far smarter than his exceptionally pretty face suggested), it was an easy thing for May to slip out of the room and take the elevator to the floor where JARVIS directed her. Tony stood in front of a solid wall, peering at it like it contained the mysteries of the universe.
“Thank you,” Steve said stiffly. His heart was still thudding madly in his chest, his arm braced at his side mimicking his stance when he held the shield. “You going to tell me what you did mean, then?”
Bucky did not want to talk. He stomped his way into the kitchen, wearing the combat boots he’d insisted on putting on, and accepted the steaming plate full of eggs, biscuits, hashbrowns and sausage Rhodey offered with little more than a grunt. Steve kept a close eye on him, and on Tony whose mood seemed equally volatile; one moment he was almost giddy, the next he would withdraw from the conversation and poke listlessly at his food until prompted by Bruce or Clint to eat.
Peter learns he is not the only powered teenager Tony spends his time with, and is surprised to find he cares.
“Tony.” Pepper’s tone had taken on the patient, slow cadence she only used when she felt his requests were migrating from the realm of the ridiculous to the truly absurd. Hearing it just made him smile more widely.
…) He’d been prepared to exchange a greeting with Tony, maybe some polite and distant conversation about work or training. A discussion about kink and sex and limits with a Tony who was struggling to walk normally because of whatever he’d done to himself the day before had
Some he recognized immediately, like seratonin, dopamine, caffeine (that smartass addition absolutely had to be Rhodey’s); others, like subtonin, took a moment to recognize by feel. But by far the molecular structure that repeated itself the most was also the one with the most complex structure. C43 H66 N12 O12 S2: oxytocin, popularly known as the love hormone. Eventually Bruce reached out so that his fingers joined Tony’s, following him around his exploration of the collar, a love letter written in the language Tony knew and loved best.
“Yeah, I was there for that, and believe me if Tony is offended it will definitely not be about his religious sensibilities, it will be about how horribly not funny that joke was, Clint,” Natasha declared flatly. “Besides, I’m pretty sure he’s not religious. His Mother was, but he isn’t.”
“It is Asgardian gold, a rare and treasured substance,” Thor explained. “It is capable of responding to the wearer’s needs, and may be able to offer comfort in our absence.” Which, okay, Tony had no idea what the hell that meant, but it was impossible not to return the puppyish grin the demigod shot Tony before he nodded and followed Natasha onto the jet.
Steve, he’d discovered over the past several days, had the most delicious reaction Tony calling him Sir. It didn’t seem to matter how irreverent Tony was being about it (and actually sometimes Steve seemed to respond more strongly when Tony was being playful and silly with the title); Steve always licked his lips and shivered just a little. Every time. Tony mentally pictured him stopping in the middle of campus as he read Tony’s text, that adorable quiver running down the length of his spine. (Would it be creepy to try to find security footage later?)
Reflexively, he looked her up and down for any visual indicators of how the toll the battle had taken. JARVIS had quietly informed him around 10 that it was over, but that the team would have to undergo decontamination showers on top of the usual post-mission debriefing, so their return was likely several hours out. It was only then that Tony had allowed himself to join a softly snoring Cap in dreamland.
“You…warm.” This was not the first complaint Steve had ever received from a partner about the serum’s impact on his base body temperature, and he regretfully made to roll over and put a bit of distance between he and Tony; the second he tried Tony was reaching out to clutch almost desperately at him.
“Well, primarily because you are effectively just beginning to accept that your previous partner died. You are
For all the build-up that had surrounded it, the blood draw itself was standard and simple. With Rhodey there to chat with/interrogate about his latest mission, Tony barely even felt the prick of the needle.
“What in the ever loving—who has been servicing my baby? So help me, I don’t care if this is my universe or not, if the
“I promise we won’t keep you for long; you can even take dessert to go if you’d like,” Steve offered. (Oh God, Tony had forgotten the dessert, a Reese’s Pieces cake Tony had ordered from the best bakery in the city all because the kid loved peanut butter.) “But you said you came straight from work, and from the sounds of it, the job has only gotten more demanding since my Ma was a nurse. Getting a little bit of food in your system before heading back to Queens probably isn’t the worst idea.”
“We’re done with that now. Keep that in there while I try to find something to use as a splint.” Peter settled for glaring while Steve found the cleanest shirt he had in his bag, cut it into strips, and wrapped it carefully around Peter’s red, swollen thumb. “You’re right about…well, about almost everything. I made so many mistakes with Tony, there are more things that I wish I could take back than you even know about. But you can’t go through the world like this, Peter. It’s not what he would have wanted, to see you twisted and broken and cruel. You know that.”
It was at least a few weeks old by the looks of things, but it had clearly been deep. And while most of it was on its way to scarring, there were a couple of places that carried the angry, red signs of recent infection that Steve had learned to recognize well during the War. He growled and stepped closer, dropping gracelessly to his knees to get a better angle. The skin didn’t feel any warmer than the rest of Tony’s body, which was as good sign, but up close Steve didn’t like how raw the skin still looked, like it was preparing to open up again at any moment.
“I really want to make out with you right now,” was Tony’s not particularly erudite reply. He made up for it, though, when visions of the first team training session he had witnessed and Pepper stepping out of the Rescue armour in the shop offered themselves to him in tandem. “Oh holy shit. I figured out how we move you all through the Tower without the goons knowing where you are, or Taskmaster figured out how to copy any of your new tricks.”
Content Notes: As you've probably guessed, Tony faces up to the consequences of his actions prior to the press conference in this chapter. It's proceeded by a lengthy negotiation (most, but not all, of which is included in the narrative) so there's no question of consent being an issue, but it's still a challenging and difficult scene.
“Fuck you,” he grunted, trying and failing to sweep Bucky’s legs out from under him. Bucky pressed him harder into the unforgiving concrete, his breath hot and fast against Steve’s neck. (Tony would be cold by now.)
satiated. Add submission into that mix, the way it had made him feel flayed open and raw and exposed, and Tony might not survive it when that happened.
“Nothin’ to be afraid of. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.” Thor’s hand found Steve’s under the table. He was one of the only people on the team capable of making Steve feel small, and even in his Dominant headspace some part of him reveled in that.
desperate and broken teenager. This child was Tony’s just as surely and completely as any child had ever belonged to any parent.)
“You know something.” Bruce didn’t deny it (and thank God, the man was a terrible liar at the best of times), but he didn’t speak either. He just put the popcorn on the floor and hid in his face in his hands in a childlike gesture that managed to ratchet Steve's concern up several degrees. With the entirety of the team’s attention on him, however, the poor guy didn’t really have a hope; it only took a few more probing questions from Coulson and Nat before Bruce sighed.
3. Some Switches are able to move smoothly between headspaces, yes, though it’s relatively rare. Natasha Romanov, for instance, can accomplish this with relative ease, and sometimes enjoys scenes that are based on fluidly altering her dynamic in such a way. Occasionally, a Switch may move from one headspace to another without having had the intention to do so, as well, though this is rare, and sometimes an indication of some kind of orientational instability; for instance, a Switch who has neglected one of their headspace for too long might find themselves involuntarily slipping into the neglected headspace mid-scene. For the most part, a Switch will be able to feel the pull toward one ‘side’of their orientation over the other, and will stay there for at least the length of a scene.
The food was amazing. It had apparently been Thor’s turn to choose the menu, and he had requested grilled cheese and tomato soup. It wasn’t quite like any version of either food Peter had ever had before—the soup was homemade with fresh tomatoes and a whole host of fresh herbs and spices, and the sandwiches were on fresh bread and had to have at least three kinds of cheese in them. It was still close enough to a familiar comfort food, though, that Peter found himself less aware that he was eating dinner with a room full of superheroes than he might have expected.
There was a moment where May’s eyes did a quick darting thing that reminded Tony way too much of Peter when he was trying to lie. She got it under control more quickly than Peter tended to, but when she followed up by taking a rushed bite of potatoes (a stalling maneuver Tony had used more than once himself) he was sure.
Realization had him sitting up suddenly from his chair, sending it careening behind him and nearly knocking over a delicate glass jar full of potpourri as he sprinted towards the elevators and jabbed the button for the lobby.
Peter had had less to share than he wished. So much of his feelings toward Tony had ultimately been colored more by potential than its realization. But he’d babbled about the day he’d started his sham internship, how much it had meant that Tony was committed enough to the lie to take that dorky picture and everything. Sam had listened, really listened, in a way few people ever bothered to do. Then he’d thanked Peter for letting him know Tony better than he had before.
For seconds that felt like hours, he watched Peter writhe on the floor. Steve imagined how the sight would have devastated Tony, what the man he loved would have given to cradle his child, soothe his tears and his pain. But it wasn’t just Tony he saw in Peter now. In the boy’s misdirected anger, his sorrow, his inability to even comprehend the scale of his own loss, Steve could see himself reflected just as clearly as when he’d actually battled his younger counterpart. Tony would never have wanted that for Peter, would never have wished for all the worst parts of Steve to take over his son.
Steve had not been the only one to try to move Tony from where he still lay. By now, pretty much the whole team had tried, their strategies varying but each entirely consistent with who Tony knew them to be. Bruce and Phil were both their own specific mix of gentle and practical, supporting without coddling. Clint and Rhodey had both taken more aggressive approaches, a sharp contrast to Steve who had been all sweethearts and softness since he’d heartlessly refused what might have been Tony’s most desperate request. Natasha had been mostly quiet, as if she hadn’t quite decided yet who or what Tony most needed from her. So far Barnes, or rather the Soldier, had probably been his favourite companion. He’d stayed just a foot or two inside the door, a silent show of support that made zero demands on Tony himself. Even Barnes, though, had a hard time looking at Tony right now. All of them did. He didn’t quite know where the discomfort came from, or even if it the reason behind it was the same for all of them. Were they disgusted by Tony now that they knew what he’d left behind to stay here? Perhaps they were upset that he hadn’t told them about Peter up until now? Maybe some of them were even upset on this Peter’s behalf—that Tony might have saved him and had chosen not to?
The anger Peter felt then was not the work of a single moment. It was the product of nearly a year’s worth of loss and hurt and betrayal, all brought violently to the surface with so much force that it felt like it should have torn him apart. And perhaps, in a way, it did; he was throwing up seconds later. It wasn’t like he’d seen other kids do at parties, either, with just a quick (admittedly disgusting) heave before it was over. He couldn’t stop throwing up, not even when he wasn’t bringing up anything but bile, whose disturbing coloration he could only put down to the otherworldly makeup of the drink.
It wasn’t just Barnes, though. The lot of them were having fun in a way that Tony had rarely witnessed in his own universe, delighting in one another’s company and in the creative solutions the course forced them to come to. They cheered and mocked and supported one another without any of the hesitation or tense undercurrents that had been a constant accompaniment to the other team’s interactions. (Of all the remarkable things Tony had seen these people do since arriving here, he’d never been anywhere close to this jealous.)
Steve didn’t know why the answer mattered quite so much to him. He liked Talia, of course, and wanted the best possible life for her. It was more than that, though, something bigger than this one junior agent that had him gripping the edge of his kitchen island with white knuckles as he waited for her answer.
a catch.” May reached and placed a hand on his forearm, tapping some kind of pattern that the kid seemed to recognize instantly. The exchange was small, but it gave Tony the time he needed to regroup.
“Aww, nothin’ to get upset about now darlin’. You be good for me while I tell you a little story and you can have my hand back. Sound good?” Oh god, that fucking condescension, the way it so often felt like Clint was almost making fun of Tony when he was in Dominant headspace, it should have triggered anger or hurt or at least some kind of snark. It shouldn’t have made Tony feel like there was a line of liquid heat shooting down all the way down his spine and into his groin. “Gotta use your words, Tony, remember?”
“Before he came to find me. After DC. ” Barnes didn’t bother asking the question, too skilled and efficient an operative to verbalize an inquiry he already knew the answer to. “Yours didn’t.” Tony stood, the need to move outweighing his hungover body’s desire to curl up in a sloth-like ball. Dummy hesitated, then began tracing a path after him as he circled the shop.
“Let’s be very clear about something.” Clint never raised his voice. If anything, it grew softer but infinitely more dangerous, like spun cotton threaded with barbed wire. Tony didn’t need whatever instincts submissive in this universe had to realize instantly that
He was still grinning to himself when he stepped into the conference room. Pepper was already there, dressed down in a pair of jeans and a long-sleeved salmon shirt. She absolutely refused to abide by popular advice to avoid pink with her hair colour, and she fucking rocked the shade every time. She had already cleared a path for Dummy around the table, too; he’d gotten himself good and trapped in a corner the last time he’d followed Tony up here for one of their meetings. They hugged while the bot settled himself smugly at the head of the table like the damn chairman of the board.
The announcement from JARVIS came at precisely 9:00 as Steve had known it would, because all soldiers regardless of their branch lived and died by precision. As long as Tony was officially in Rhodes’ hands, he would be punctual whether he liked it or not.
Now, apologies for the posting delay, but this was a day late in part because of how big and important this chapter is. I wanted it to be perfect, or as close to it as I could get, and I really really hope it delivered! Please let me know what you thought. Your comments and kudos are always a highlight and they make writing this verse a joy.
“God no,” Tony interrupted. He might have been tempted for all of five minutes last night to let Peter and May’s relationship suffer so that his own bond with Peter might be fast-tracked, but no one who had spent any time at all with these two would need anything near Tony’s level of intellect to recognize that they love and needed one another. May had supported Peter through multiple unthinkable traumas, and while their journey in this universe had been a slightly rougher one, she’d still helped mold Peter into the remarkable kid who sat in front of them, hurriedly trying to use the cover of everyone else being occupied to brush some crumbs off of the kitchen chair. “I just…I found out a little while ago who Peter was, and I wanted to help. I made contact with him when he was hospitalized—”
Tony fell asleep to JARVIS’s voice in his ear, and woke to a sharp piece of metal jabbing roughly at his left forearm.
Eventually they stopped fondling Barnes’ welts and continued on with lunch, but the entire encounter left a heated feeling behind in Tony’s stomach. His mind kept fixating on the feel of Clint’s strong, calloused fingers in his own, and the way Barnes had pressed up into their hands despite (or maybe because of?) the obvious pain the touch caused. His own limited experiences with kink had been nothing more substantive than some name-calling and a bit of light spanking, and he’d never had any particular interest in going further with any of it. But now…well, it was hard
“No, nothin’ like that. We uh…well, we got pretty close for a while, after SHIELD fell and everything. He even talked about maybe joining the team, but he wanted some time to think about it.” So far that tracked with Tony’s own universe, and he nodded. Steve didn’t say anything more, so he prompted again.
“I’m sure I speak for everyone here when I say we’re just so thrilled to have you back Mr. Stark—Tony, if I may,” Fletcher said. Tony nodded his head again. “Truthfully, we are so grateful for your return; your legacy is one we treat with gravity and care, but I must confess we didn’t always agree on the best methods of going about securing it.” He ‘confessed’ to
No chapter-specific content notes I can think of for this one! As always feel free to let me know, though, if you have questions or concerns about the chapter.
, but he had already learned that attempting to tease Steve about it resulted in a monologue about the value of being able to actually touch something in a world where so much existed primarily in the Cloud. (And the worst part was Steve was so sincere during those kinds of orations that he was entirely oblivious to Tony’s attempts to invite Steve to touch things other than dirty old coins.)
When he’d fantasized about the other Tony in the aftermath of his loss, it had been scenes just like this. Tony sleeping, or so deep in subspace that there was no room for any of the doubt or anger or insecurity that so often coloured his responses. Steve and Domen had had what felt like endless conversations about those fantasies. She’d called them idyllic, a descriptor Steve had strongly resisted at first.
“When we discussed these sessions, I mentioned that I had some other writing I wanted you to do,” Phil said, the slight harshness to his breathing the only sign at all that he was remotely affected by the kiss. Tony nodded warily. “None of them are designed to be busywork; I don’t believe in punishments without a purpose, especially not given how little time we often have. They’re intended to serve as a kind of bridge toward the work you’ll be doing in the afternoons, an opportunity to think and reflect on different elements of your submission. While I do think there’s a value to using a different platform than those you’re used to, you’re permitted to use something else to compose these notes on something other than paper if you prefer, though I will be staying in the room to supervise regardless.”
“This is a trap.” He could fear the smirk in Coulson’s voice even as the other man turned his back and began to walk down the hallway, apparently entirely confident Tony would follow.
It would have been easier, he guessed, if he and Tony had been attracted to each other, if they could have just been everything the other needed. If Rhodey was the guy to use that kind of language, he certainly would have called Tony his soulmate in every way that mattered. But even after Tony had come of age, James had never been able to entirely let go of the image of a scared, sick fourteen year old, sobbing at his feet and begging to be told, "just one time, Rhodey, promise, just once," that he was good. Tony, likewise, had never seemed to regard James as anything beyond a kind of big-brother figure.
Natasha was tempted, and the fact that Steve could so easily read it on her face was enough to convince him Bruce had precisely the right idea.
That was how Tony found them: Bucky kneeling, his hand pressed to Steve’s mouth while Steve replied with his most withering stare. Tony took this in with no small hint of amusement.
“Sorry. I’ll—sorry.” Steve stood there for several seconds, disheveled and groggy and possibly slightly drunk, then turned around with slightly jerky movements as if preparing to depart the penthouse. Exasperated, Tony grabbed his arm.
“That’s not for me to decide, Tony. None of the options I believe you would select cause universe-ending devastation, and beyond that kind of threat I have no desire to shape the course of your destiny.”
“Five minutes? More like five seconds. I tried to go after him—I tried to after you Peter, I swear I did, I couldn’t figure out how you’d gotten away so damn fast. Which I guess makes sense now, with the—” She made a gesture that was probably supposed to mimic Peter’s web-slinging action.
Other than a general warning for angst, I don't think there are any specific warnings needed for this chapter. As always, feel free to let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
“Yeah, alright,” he sighed. “Hit me with all the ways this is a terrible idea.” He had zero intention of actually stopping regardless of what his therapist said, but if she needed to outline all the risks and potential downsides to his involvement with Tony just to be able to say she’d done it, Steve would listen.
Cap, Tony realized once they were all seated, wasn’t coming. It shouldn’t have come as much of a surprise, given how little he saw of the guy in general, but Steve was usually the first one to want to have Talks like this; he must really be uninterested in having anything but a surface-level acquaintance type thing with Tony.
“S’nice,” Tony agreed with a little cat-like stretch of pleasure that put one of the gentlest smiles Steve had ever seen on Natasha’s face.
I hope it’s alright, dear poster, that I have elected to provide insight from Coulson’s point of view immediately following the scene in the previous chapter! (All the warnings from that scene, particularly those for sexual content, are still applicable here.)
“And that,” Clint concluded with a flourish, sending paint flying from his rollerbrush and into Thor’s long golden hair, “is why Steve is not allowed to see Tony on Thursdays.”
“Should I just leave you to your damn turkey sandwich?” Tony snapped. Clint arched a brow and affected an almost amused smirk that was sure to push Tony right to the brink.
“I’m not telling you that you taking on additional qualities of submission changes nothing,” Steve continued. “I realize it takes the choice away from you to some degree, and I am truly sorry if you would rather it have been different. But it doesn’t make me want or need you any more or less than I did before, as a submissive or a man.”
Headlines blaming Sam for seducing Steve away from the recent memory of his lost True love had topped every tabloid, blog, and social media feed. Sam had been followed everywhere for months, called every name in the book including several racist epithets that had had Steve wondering why he’d ever bothered to save the United States in the first place. The Avengers PR team had put out statements unequivocally denouncing both the rumoured romance and the harassment and threats that were being directed toward Sam. But gradually, the whole thing grew into yet another area of Steve’s life that provoked a whole host of negative feelings—guilt, anger, regret—and the time in between calls and visits grew longer and longer.
“There’s nothing to report with that kind of frequency, Steve. He’s been in bed almost exclusively for the past two and a half days. The most any of them let us do is bring food and drink, and even then we leave it outside the door. The rest of the time we alternate between camping out in the hall outside his room and sublimating the ways this is fucking with our heads into sex.” And if that didn’t make Steve feel like an ass…he’d been so caught up in how his own instincts and emotions were responding to being away from Tony while he was in some kind of severe distress that he hadn’t really considered what it would be like to be mere feet away but denied access while Rhodes and Pepper tended to him.
“Because I figured you’d have started to regret kicking him out about five minutes after it actually happened, and I didn’t want you to be any more worried than you had to be.”
, Steve realized with a start. Not only had Bruce’s exam not seemed to cause him any distress, it had pushed him back down toward subspace. Bruce chuckled like he’d expected as much and turned to address himself to Steve for the first time.
“Mmm. Phil said you had a bit of an oral fixation. I’m sorry I didn’t realize what you were asking, I thought you were just upset that I was getting up to get the cloths. I’m sorry.”
Before he knew it, Tony was pacing the shop with the battle protected from five angles on five different holosceens. He was midway through attempting to convince Rhodey to bring one or more of the mutant owls back to the Tower with him when JARVIS interrupted, something that sounded like alarm in his voice. (And fuck everyone who didn’t think JARVIS was capable of emoting.)
“I can tell this is really difficult for you, Tony, and I’m very proud that you made it through today without snarking or shutting down. You also really let your body relax and open up during the exam, don’t think I didn’t notice. Since you did so well, I wanted to give you some options about how we proceed.” Tony lost the battle against grinning like a total fool. Praise hit him hard enough on its own; now Bruce was combining that with the team’s tendency to give Tony choices, laying out a clear array of options and explaining them so that he got to participate in decision-making without doing all the work of analysis. Tony had done that kind of thing for other people before, mostly to help them keep up with the particularities of how his brain worked in what Pepper had always called ‘genius mode,’ but no one had ever done such a thing for him until he’d stumbled his way into this universe.”We can continue conducting check-ins with JARVIS’s help for the next week. Presuming you can avoid lying to me or holding back anything major in that time, I’ll be satisfied enough to trust you again. Alternatively, there’s some assessments I’ve been wanting to run to get a better sense of how the rise in subtonin is affecting you both physically and mentally. I know that’s a sensitive topic for you, and if you need or want to wait on that for a while more than we can. But if you’re up to completing some of them over the next few days, I’d be willing to cut the punishment down to three days.”
She turned in the direction of the noise and found a collection of familiar figures huddled in a circle. Getting to her feet was more of a struggle than it should have been (Clint always had known her weakest points, and their fight had been no joke), but adrenaline made up for the energy she lacked.
“I’ll see a Dom over the weekend and have the paperwork on your desk by next Monday. May I be excused, Director?” He wanted to make her stay, he really did. But the things he wanted to say, the assurances and support he wanted to offer, he didn’t trust himself to be speaking to her just as her supervisor—it was possible he wouldn’t really be speaking to her at all, or at least not exclusively. And the last thing the beautiful, brave woman in front of him needed was to feel was that any further boundaries between her professional and personal lives were being violated. That was the very least he could do.
Characterization of Taskmaster here is shaped both by the comics and by rumours about the backstory the character will have in the upcoming Black Widow movie. (Nothing I would say is spoilery, though, beyond the fact that the character is known to be in that film that he and Natasha have some kind of history.)
“I want to write it out by hand, I think, but my wrists are kind of sore today. A sentence was fine, but I get the sense that the next thing will be longer than that.” This time when Phil kissed Tony he crowded Tony against the wall of windows first; he gasped at the sudden press of cool glass on bare skin, and Coulson just used the opportunity to conquer more of his mouth, so that once he finished kissing Tony this time,  Tony would probably have slid right to his knees if he’d been allowed.
Tony swept into the shop and then came to a sudden, jarring stop. He stared at Peter for several long beats, blinking with slow deliberation like he was reassuring himself the sight before him was real. The naked relief in his gaze felt way more intimate than if he’d grabbed Peter in a hug.
Loki was released from Asgardian prison when it came to light (through a series of equally important events which I shall not derail here) that he himself had been under mental duress and influence from the so-called Mad Titan, Thanos. Loki still occasionally makes appearances on Earth, but his efforts are far less focused on dictatorial control and more on the kinds of mischief he has been famous on Asgard for for centuries.
“Tony, I know that you’re classified as a True submissive. And in just a few hours, so will most of the world.”
Tony he was speaking of. But Tony could hardly even pretend to keep his gaze averted after that, which meant that he met Natasha’s weighty stare head-on as she answered in a near-whisper.
Given all the time that Tony had spent trying to avoid getting work done for SI, it was a sick and cruel irony that now that he needed the distraction, he was being shut out.
He wanted to say no. It was terrifying to face the prospect of actually acknowledging what had happened between them when all Tony had tried to do all day was erase it from his mind. But then, it wasn’t like that had really worked, was it?
“Different things, depending on who’s wearing it,” was Coulson’s cryptic reply. “When I’m in the field mine gets tighter, so that it can’t be removed the way it should be by regulation. Drives the real spooks crazy—makes me too identifiable.” Coulson had never seemed like the type to take pleasure in defying protocol, but he was definitely grinning when he said that. “Natasha’s is a necklace that can change its levels of hardness. It never breaks or scratches, but in the right circumstances it can stretch, or become both malleable and sturdy enough to, for instance, restrain a target.”
Weeks, even a few days ago, Steve probably would have been incensed. Today, he mostly still felt like he’d told Phil: tired. Grief was exhausting. Learning to accept Tony’s loss, and himself in the face of it, was by far the hardest thing Steve had ever done, and if he’d learned anything from his conversation with Domen the other day, it was that he still had a long way to go.
“Did you fire all the R&D department and replace them with local junior high schoolers?” Tony knew even before the question finished falling from his lips what he was really being shown, but why was another matter, and not something he was sure he wanted to know.
And then Bruce finally, gloriously, went to work. He started not on Tony’s already-heated ass, but up between his shoulder blades. It took only a few dizzying blows for him to realize just how precise Bruce was with this particular implement. The tails never wrapped around his shoulders, or slid down his back; the second they made impact Bruce was already snapping the flogger away from his skin, so that the heavy thudding weight of the blows still always left him yearning somehow. Unlike the punishment, when he’d been half-desperate to get away Tony wanted to sink into the feeling, tried even to rise up against his bonds to meet the flogger, welcome it in.
“As soon as you get to your floor. Before you even start getting ready for bed,” he confirmed. He’d seen Pepper, overwhelmed on all sides by SI, preparations for funerals and public memorials, plus numerous addresses to the media, on the brink of sub-dep multiple times in the aftermath of Tony’s death. He’d be damned if he let her unravel that way again.
“So it turns out that FRI is actually higher in the AI pecking order than me, which—yeah. I’m sure I’ll find a way around that with time, but for now all she’s saying is that Peter is on the premises and relatively stable. She promises to alert us both if that changes.”
He assumed that Tony, who was always juggling at least three jobs at once, would similarly enjoy his freedom and seize the opportunity for a work binge with relatively few interruptions. Instead, something in the submissive seemed to kind of give in the wake of his scene with Steve. Every member of the team remarked at some point on Tony’s excellent behaviour; he attended check-ins without complaint, he completed the ‘homework’ Phil had assigned (which Coulson readily admitted he’d expected to get some real resistance on); he accepted hand-feeding pretty much whenever it was offered, and it became such a regular thing to find him kneeling or cross-legged on the floor at someone’s feet that they stopped even bothering to put his kneeling pillow away at the end of the day.
“I, uh, I mean there’s a girl at my school, Liz…” Peter trailed off, a dawning comprehension on his face. Tony nodded.
“Nope. Seriously. I like seeing you all, and I appreciate the company while I’m basically confined to the Tower. But it’s not supposed to be an obligation. Rogers needs you, and you all clearly need to be with him. So do me a favour: take that tragedy of a bot and go down to him. I’ll be fine up here on my own for a while. I won’t even light anything on fire.”
He did briefly consider ordering food after she and Happy finally left. But maybe Steve would want to eat when he got here. Peter didn’t really know what he liked, or even what places would deliver up here.The longer he thought about what should have been a relatively simple decision, the more complex and unachievable it seemed.
Although Endgame changed some of the details, this scene was one of the ones I've had outlined and half-written since the beginning. I've been dying to get here, and I really hope you liked it! Kudos and comments will be even more appreciated than usual (which is saying something, really, because you're already the best readers a gal could ask for.)
It could only be adrenaline carrying the guy through. Stark had fought the same battle they had, after all, and that didn’t even account for his journey to space and subsequent near-death experience. (A vision of Tony falling through the sky, falling just as Bucky had fallen...Steve shook his head, trying to ward it off. Tony wasn’t Bucky, goddammit.) He would crash any minute now, and the more energy he expended fetching Diet Cokes and tahini, the less likely he was to make it home before he did. Finally, Steve couldn’t take it anymore. He barked,
fast; the other version of Tony had worked hard to streamline the process of suiting up, and certainly he’d come a long way since the footage Steve had seen of the earliest days of Iron Man’s existence. But this…the armour was like a second skin; it rushed out to meet Tony not as if it was something external being applied, but as if it were a part of him that had been there all along, just waiting to be set free.
Now, yes, watching both Steve and Phil at their most strategic and hyper-competent had led to a brief but intense make-out session in one of the utility closets once the op was complete. (So sue Tony. He was newly collared and engaged to boot, and he was going to take full advantage of that high for as long as possible.) But even aside from the effect the whole thing had had on Tony’s libido, it had also been illuminating to be reminded that these were more than just his partners. The majority of the Avengers worked for SHIELD in one capacity for another; they were accountable to other people, other organizations, and Tony hadn’t had to drag them kicking and screaming into it, either. They did it because they truly believed in something larger than themselves.
“Every time we do this exercise, someone takes a turn with a captured enemy weapon.” Tony didn't quite know when Coulson had left his table and crossed the room to stand next to Tony.  If he knew how damn alarmed Tony was by what Barnes was holding, though, his casual, explanatory tone didn’t betray it in the least. “Beyond simple versatility, the point is for the team to be able to pick up a discarded weapon, friendly or not, and feel comfortable using it.”
“Okay, let’s get you out of there, Stark. My magic is apparently responding to the intensity of your desires to see these people, and while I am impressed at its sophistication, I don’t want to break your brain.” The connection broke, and he was back in Strange’s weird house, his head between his knees.
“I don’t really know. In this universe? Yeah, probably; he wants to know what happened to his people, so he’ll probably at least try to make contact at some point. But as far as staying here in the Tower…” Rhodes paused long enough to rub a tired hand across his face. “Something happened, I’m pretty sure, with the other versions of you guys.”
It was not entirely unusual for most members of the team to come to Steve when they felt they needed or deserved punishment. He was both the team leader and the strongest Dominant in the relationship, both of which meant he derived deep gratification from giving his partners whatever they needed, including the chance for absolution.
Rhodey took a step backward, visibly stunned on a level comparable to when he’d found Tony in the desert with a new chest accessory. Steve, though, well he’d long ago guessed at the truth of it, hadn’t he? Ignoring the numerous protesters from the others, Steve gathered the splattered eggs and crushed fruit off the floor and back onto Tony’s plate, setting it front of him with the air of someone who knew intimately just how precious food became when it was low or gone.
For a while after that Steve just held him, murmuring praise and filth and love that felt like a blanket covering Tony and protecting him even from his own ability to think. Stave made him drink a whole bottle of water, too, and every once in a while he would toy with Tony’s soft cock, seeming unbothered when Tony could do nothing but shudder and shake. When he had finally recovered enough to start to respond to the touches, it started all over again, just as Steve had promised.
“So the money for the bills, I’d be working to pay it back? It’d be like a loan?” Peter asked hopefully. Tony snorted.
“And in every way that you’ll have us.” This seemed like a strange addition from Bucky, who had been entirely silent up until this point, but then the other man stepped forward and took the box that had held Tony’s collar into his hands. The bottom, it turned out, opened into a smaller compartment which held a smooth grey ring. Bucky took it out and sank to one knee.
It had been stupid to forget, really, that he wasn’t and could never be like the subs from this universe. And to make matters worse, he was fairly certain Natasha suspected something. She hadn’t come right out and said it, of course, that wasn’t her style. She had definitely noticed his limp that first morning after, though, and he’d caught her watching him several times since. As if eager to confess their guilt, Tony’s own eyes always wanted to fall onto the kneeling pillow, hidden innocently back in the corner of the penthouse living room. Fighting to make them linger on the TV, or on whichever member of the team happened to be speaking, was far more of a challenge than it should have been. (But then Tony had never really gone in for the espionage stuff.)
“Wouldn’t have traded a second,” Phil said firmly, dropping a kiss to the top of Tony’s head on his way into the kitchen to make tea. Everyone else nodded or vocalized unambiguous agreement, and Tony, caught between pleasure and sheepishness, rubbed the back of his neck and muttered something unintelligible.
Content Notes: The first response contains...I mean, I guess they're spoilers for something coming in the main arc. That event has been preeeeeetty heavily foreshadowed at this point, but still, if you want to ensure you are as surprised as possible about anything coming there, make sure to skip that first one.
By some force that felt like it came from outside of himself, Tony halted any further movement. There was no build-up, nothing like foreplay: Bruce’s finger targeted his prostate with singular focus. He circled the gland, glancing off it with various levels of pressure until he seemed to find one he liked.
As you might be able to predict based on my last answer, yes there certainly members of the D/s universe who abstain from sex, either for religious reasons, or simply because they are asexual. Asexuality, while analogous in some ways, is distinct from those in the D/s universe who refer to themselves as un-oriented; for that population, it is their classification according to the Orientation Classification System that does not align with their own self-identification. They may or may not enjoy sex if it is removed from orientational practices.
“And you, Captain Rogers. I confess that I requested to deliver your meal this afternoon. I hope it is not too much of a bother. But my Papa ran a small bookstore when I was a child, and while I loved and admired my own people and our stories very much, I had a particular attachment to your comics. He used to call my love for Captain America the family’s ‘great shame,’ but he always made sure I had the latest issues.” Before Steve could even respond beyond a chuckle at the ‘great shame’ bit, the man shook his head and stiffened into a parade rest. “My apologies, Captain, I—”
A mere two hours after that, they were all in the workshop taking inventory of the existing Iron Man suits and creating supply lists for what they’d need to up the count in advance of the showdown with Taskmaster. The guy had hardly announced a date, but they all agreed it was likely Fletcher and his cronies would want Tony out of the way before the anniversary of his counterpart’s death, which this year was slated to serve as a celebration of the Avengers and the city of New York instead. That left them with just under a week to prepare.
“I didn’t mean to make you feel neglected, darling. Let’s go sit in the living room, spend some time together, hmm?”
Reality crept back in slowly. Steve spent most of the next couple of days at work. Tony had intended to do the same, and he did manage to get the odd thing done here and there. He added a few things to the newest model of the quinjet, spent some time familiarizing himself with the intricacies of Clint’s hearing aids, and even ended up chatting with a rehabilitation centre about sharing the code for the holographic volleyball system. (It turned out there was a lot of potential for contact-less sports, which made sense given the old Tony’s notes about designing several of the little games in the house system to help Barnes with his new arm.) The nearer his meeting with Dr. Chimva grew, the more desperate Tony felt to cling to the team before it all changed.
. So she said nothing, throwing her left leg back and overtop of Bruce’s just so she could feel more of his skin on hers.
“To get the stones back, we ended up having to go back in time. Cap and I were in the middle of SHIELD in the 70s, and it took us about two minutes to get made. Which honestly is two minutes longer than it should have taken given that I named myself Howard Potts, and he called himself Captain Stevens and we were generally the worst spies ever. We ended up stuck there way longer than we should have been, and I still almost left the briefcase with the thing I was there for behind.”
The session with Phil wasn’t much easier. He was given a prompt to work with for what he’d mentally taken to referring to as Coulson’s ‘Make Tony Love Tony’ project (“Get outside yourself, away from the patterns your brain is used to. Assess yourself objectively, like you’re an employee. Find one word, a single word that conveys something valuable about who you are.”) Eventually, remembering a phone call with Harley that felt both like it had happened lifetimes ago and like it had just taken place yesterday, he scribbled ‘engineer’ and handed the page off to Phil.
