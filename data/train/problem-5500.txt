Steve carefully shifts his body to be more accommodating, helping to support Tony's unsteady muscles as she attempts to assume a more dignified posture. Once she manages to sit up out of the protective cradle he's formed around her, she blinks the small amount of static from her vision, and is startled to see just how much close, personal attention her little fainting spell actually got her.
she thinks, even as she reaches up and starts jerkily scraping the filth from her body beneath the flow of the water, just to give her hands something to do.
"What about Odin?" Clint offers, and all eyes swing towards him.  His normally affable expression is perfectly neutral, for many reasons--maybe even more than just those Tony knows of, and isn't that an unhappy trip?
. It's like the guy has a height complex or something. She makes a face at the pop art hanging above the bar, because pop art? Really?
"Yeah, I heard that one," Tony admits slowly, blinking carefully. She pauses to lick her lips, watching his reaction carefully as she continues.
"What are you--" Tony begins suspiciously, then cuts herself off with a yelp when Steve, without any warning, scoops her up neatly from standing to a bridal carry before she can so much as protest. The change in positions leaves Tony reeling for a moment, but the second she's recovered she smacks his pec indignantly.
"Hey, we don't know if that's structurally sound--!" Not-Tony calls after her, but Tony doesn't give two shits.  She's already halfway across the room and stumbling straight into the cloud of concrete dust, heart pounding even as she coughs and squints through the unclean air.
"By the Nine," comes Thor's wondering voice from one side of the penthouse, "it is truly exactly as you said."
her. They're similar in ways Tony herself would never even have noticed or predicted, given the chance, and observing him now, Tony has the keen sense that her deep and thorough understanding of him is exactly what makes her male self feel so deeply unsettled.
There are so many little things she has to be careful of--at least until they watch the footage from the battle.  Hopefully, they'll believe her then.
Tony used to have long hair, but after an unfortunate workshop incident she chopped it all off to pixie length. It was only afterwards that she discovered short hair's amazing side benefit: it allows for immediate, enthusiastic dick-sucking without stopping to grab a ponytail holder.
"I believe he was seriously considering it," Steve says, straight-faced, after placing the shower caddy on the ground.  His eyes crinkle at the corners and he leans in to give her a kiss, stubble scraping the corners of her mouth.
sense of humor. He seemed friendly, sure, but she'd expected him to react to a Harry Potter reference with outright scorn, or at least the tired annoyance of somebody who hears that sort of thing a lot.
"Her intimate knowledge of the tower's systems prevented me, sir," is JARVIS's apologetic reply. Tony hides her smirk behind her hand and pretends not to see the angry look that Man-Tony shoots her.
She sits back a little and just...takes him in.  Miles and miles of beautiful golden skin, all the curves and planes of his well-toned body laid out on her sheets.  His sex-ruffled hair, the line of his jaw, the thick curve of his dick and the happy trail that leads to it, everything lit up by the glow of the arc reactor in her chest.  And it's all
"...I suppose we have to wait for Thor to get back," Steve admits reluctantly, after a moment of thought. "It's not optimal, but for now it's all we can do.  Unless the portal acts up again, Thor is our only lead."
"I could lend a hand, if you want," her counterpart offers, after a pause during which Tony seriously considers just using one of Natasha's leather catsuits and hoping for the best.
"It's important to stay hydrated, especially after strenuous physical activity," Steve replies seriously, wordlessly handing Tony another bottle.
He's going to meet his soulmate, whoever they are, in a battle situation--or something like one.  At the very least, Steve himself will be injured.  He'll have taken a wound to the thigh, and apparently a pretty bloody one.  How bad it is is unclear; he has enough experience to know some injuries look worse than they are.  His soulmate clearly doesn't work in the medical field, but has enough basic knowledge to know to put pressure on a bleeding wound.  They'll have to be willing to get their hands dirty (of what seems to be their own initiative), so they clearly have some strength of character, besides that--and they claim to have metal with them, so maybe he or she is a soldier?  A mechanic?  An engineer?  Regardless of the specific details (and the fact that the way Steve's soulmate speaks is almost jarringly modern), one thing about the whole run-on is incredibly clear: Steve's soulmate, whoever he or she might be, is a real, unabashed firecracker.  Panicking slightly, yes, but clearly a strong personality with a lot of grit and a hell of a lot of determination.  Beyond that, they're also selfless (or at least considerate enough to try and do something about a stranger's bleeding leg wound), forward, attracted to him to the point that it temporarily overwhelms their worry, and very obviously used to putting their foot in their own mouth when stressed.
about Tony and Not-Steve) has to keep her jaw clenched tightly to prevent herself from butting in to the conversation at inappropriate times and asking the Doctor questions like 'So, do you know Nicolas Flamel?' or 'Is Hogwarts really as impressive as it looks in the movies?'  Her teeth grind against each other while Doctor Strangelove and Man-Tony--who bizarrely enough appear to have totally hit it off--make small talk about expensive watches.  Her only comfort is in knowing that Clint's probably doing the same thing.
Tony doesn't even have time to react to the sudden, deafening roar of wind in her ears; she's too preoccupied by the sudden change in perspective brought about by the force that sucks her back off the ledge, pulling her body towards the center of the roof.
That head had to be at least fifty pounds. He glances at the stranger's metal arm with a raised brow and says, "Nice arm, kid."
"Does that mean Bruce and I are paired in your dimension?" Natasha asks, a rather unholy kind of speculation in her eyes as she looks at Tony.  Bruce shifts uncomfortably.
not the one who swooned like a Disney princess," he points out loudly, shifting uncomfortably under the unexpected attention he's now garnered from both remaining parties in the room. "I'm a grown man; I can fend for myself."
Other Steve stands near the two of them, hovering awkwardly in front of Clint's left shoulder. His familiar-yet-unfamiliar blue eyes are still full of concern, and his hands twitch involuntarily when Steve starts to ease her up to her feet, conflict clouding his face, as if he wants to come over and help but knows it wouldn't be welcome--knows that it isn't his place. It sends a weird, wobbly feeling of guilt fluttering through Tony's heart and down into her stomach, and she finally looks away, unable to keep watching him when he looks so sad and troubled.
"Natasha, what the hell?" Tony says incredulously, kicking out in the direction of her spysassin friend with more disbelief than actual anger. "Since when are we tying up our injured teammates?  I thought that--"
"I'm...gonna get back to work," she says, nonplussed. She pauses and tilts her head, brow creasing gently. "You okay?"
The abrupt lurch of the motion rips her glass from her hand, brandy and all, and sends it flying off the roof. Tony follows its fall, transfixed, as her world tilts on its axis.
"Fine by me," Doctor Strange agrees, glancing between the two of them with an undisguised fascination. Tony tosses her dusty hair and ignores the unwanted, somewhat unsettling attention he's giving her--them.
"What's going on here?" he continues almost accusatorially, looking at them with flinty eyes as if Tony and Tony somehow have something to do with Doctor Strange's uninvited appearance on the top of the Tower.
disgusting," Tony retorts intelligently as Steve sets her down gently on a barstool, because no matter what Steve or Pepper might say, she's allowed to act like a five-year-old sometimes.
"What do you mean, 'going with'; I've don't have his words on my boob for nothing," Tony says defensively, feeling offended.
Next to her, Bobby makes a face through his oversized disco glasses. "Ugh, gross; didn't need that mental image."
The guy's already angry scowl gets even angrier, if possible, and he rips off the mask covering his mouth before snarling, "Fuck you, you jackass; I'm 97 goddamn years old."
The last thing she sees is Steve's red white and blue blur coming at her out of nowhere, flickering into her periphery right as her repulsors give out and she's sucked into oblivion.
Your soulmates could stop, smile at you, and walk right out of your life, here, and you'd never even know.
It's the same conclusion Tony's come to, not that she has to like it, so she just nods and sighs.  A large part of her doesn't even want to voice her next idea.
Man-Tony's sitting in a chair, facing away from her. He has to have heard her come in, but he doesn't say anything, doesn't turn or acknowledge her presence in any way, actually. He hasn't even tensed up.
Suddenly, kneeling there on the end of the bed in just her VS cheekinis, joking all said and done... Tony feels very vulnerable.
The whole team, minus Thor, who is probably in Asgard, watches as a table with her armor resting on it lifts out of the floor.  Tony startles.
Tony benevolently allows Bruce to inspect her and treat her minimal wounds before he leaves with one final, vaguely concerned glance back at her.  She just lays there, afterwards, too exhausted by the emotional roller coaster she's had and the reality of the situation she's in to do much more than drift.  She occupies herself by going over the schematics for the next Iron Man suit in her head, changing and adding details or tweaking designs to improve or enhance it.  She carefully doesn't think about the consequences or implications of all this.
"Steve's gonna need some medical attention," she tells a wary Bruce, because now that she's moved past her initial crushing relief Tony's noticing all these cuts, scrapes, and wounds, which, though Steve heals quickly, should still be looked at.
"Better?" Steve asks, tilting his head to nose at the underside of her left breast.  Right where her words are.
"Mmm-hmm," he confirms, eyes tracking the path of his own fingers as they slide across her cheek, her chin, her neck.  His pupils are slightly dilated when he once again meets her eyes. "You don't know why, do you." The way he phrases it makes it sound like it isn't a question.
By the time someone else opens the door, Tony is tired, hungry, dehydrated, and feels like she's been put through the emotional wringer.
With Peggy's words and the words on his arm propping him up, Steve put down the phone, picked himself up, and did what he's always done best: soldier on.
"Yes, Ma," Steve replies cheekily.  He slips off the ledge, reached over, and lifts her up gently by the waist like the fine-ass gentleman he is before settling her delicately on her feet.
" Natasha adds casually.  There's a crackle that sounds suspiciously like Bruce clearing his throat.
"Would you rather talk about it now, or after we soap up?" Tony asks fondly, scritching against the nape of his neck and smiling when he arches into it like a cat.
"Coming, Cap?" Clint asks once they're aboard, to Tony's surprise.  Not-Steve seems surprised, too, for a moment, then smiles a bit, shaking his head.
"Hey, Stark, what gives?" Barton calls as they pass by the kitchen on the way to her room.  Natasha and Bruce are sitting at the island with glasses of--something, Tony doesn't care, she's thinking with her vagina and
"Yeah, well, you weren't wrong. I was talking about your throw, not the metal," he admits, reaching out with his free hand to touch the metal of Bucky's arm, frowning when his soulmate flinches back before deliberately relaxing.
"Look, this is clearly a bad time, so--I'll let you guys, uh, emerge at your own speed," Anthony says finally, glancing at each of them.  Tony smiles and waggles her fingers at him mockingly, and he scowls at her in response before finally leaving the room.
"I want to feel you," she blurts honestly, feels a twinge of old panic at the naked desperation in her voice but she swallows and forces herself to continue: "
After the initial rush of exploration, learning, acclimatization, and adaptation slows, Steve doesn't have much excitement in his modern life.  Even New York City is only so big, and re-learning all its streets didn't manage to keep him busy more than a month.  A week in, he found he'd already memorized his words.
They sit there enjoying each other's company for a while, Tony relishing the feel of the wind whipping through her hair. The sounds of New York echo up below them, sirens and voices and vehicles blending together in the white noise of the city.
"...What I'm hearing is that we aren't going home anytime soon," Tony concludes tiredly, releasing Steve's hand to take hold of his elbow, instead, and pressing the other to her eyes, trying to ward away the creeping sense of hopelessness and fatigue. The headache, which was only coming in waves earlier, has now developed into a full-force pounding, throbbing against her temples like a vice grip of pressure.
Tony makes a noise of surprise when Steve flips them unexpectedly; for a second after she hits the bed, she just lays there, breathless and reeling from the change in perspective.
He's barely gotten up from the pavement when another robot lays it on him from behind, punting him into a nearby car before he can react. Logan wedges himself out of it and snarls, slices off the thing's arm when it swings for him again.
He gets particular pleasure out of teasing her entrance, she finds.  He does that stupid circling thing with his fingers until she's practically sobbing with how much she wants him to just
"It took a pretty good beating," Steve says somewhat ruefully, setting it down on the table. Working together, they untangle and spread out the cloth of his ruined uniform until it's fully laid out, displayed so they can both see and Tony can get a better look. She leans in and frowns over it, hands running over the myriad of scorch marks and holes in the material.
"Why don't you just stick it in me, soldier?" she quips, eyes glittering at him over her shoulder, and she feels more than hears his breath hitch before his big hands grasp her hips and he yanks her back.  She gasps and laughs delightedly, but that stutters to a stop when he folds himself over her back to say, voice husky and playful, "You asked for it."
"You're welcome," Tony mumbles, slinging an arm and a leg over his naked torso. "Pull the sheets up?"
," she whines, huffing and panting, the muscles in her neck straining as he works her, steady and patient even as her thighs seize against his shoulders.  He's murmuring encouragement, eyes fixed on her face, and with a shrieking moan that whistles out of her like a teakettle Tony slides over the apex and
"Alright, Stark and Stark," Not-Steve interjects drily, cutting off their banter before it can get out of control, "If we could keep the chatter to a minimum, please." His expression is good-humored, but his eyes are serious and firm.  Tony scowls and looks away: after his tone on the roof, she's not feeling very charitably towards him right now.
After some searching, she finds the Emergency Lab Nap blanket stuffed in the back of some desk drawer and drapes it over him. He snuffles a little and shifts in his sleep, but settles back down right away with a puff of air. Tony shakes her head.
"I'm going back to bed," says Clint, bow and quiver still slung over his shoulder as he troops unceremoniously over towards the elevator, which JARVIS opens for him without being asked. "Anybody else?" he asks the room at large with a pointedly raised eyebrow.
seem like more appropriate descriptions.  It stretches all the way from the toilet room to the shower, consuming the entire far corner of the bathroom as well as a sizable portion of the central space.  Tony's too excited to do more than approximate measurements, but the side nearest to her is probably ten feet long, and the shape is roughly an isosceles triangle, so without worrying too much about the extra bits of the polygon, the soaking tub has a surface area of roughly 25 square feet.
When Tony comes, everything in her world goes white.  She drifts back to herself to several seconds later, every muscle in her body trembling as Steve bows over her and shudders his way through his own release.  She manages to unclench her fingers from where they'd twisted in his hair and pets him weakly as he spills inside her, her fingers limp and trembling.  Just that effort has the muscles in her arm shaking violently.
"Man, you weren't kidding. Jeez." She pinches her lips and frowns down at it. Back in her lab, this wouldn't be hard to fix, but...
"I suppose that's possible," Bruce concedes reluctantly, looking at his glasses and frowning, "but considering our other encounters with phenomena of this nature, doesn't it seem more likely that it's--?"
She was a little shaken up by all this interdimensional travel business yesterday, when she first arrived in this place, but now that she's aware enough to figure out what's going on and see the direction they need to be going in, she's gonna consummately make it happen, thanks.
His eyes flicker up to meet hers, and she feels caught in his gaze as he lifts her legs over his wide shoulders, getting her all settled, then reaches up and around her hip to rub gently just above her clit.  Tony's breath hitches, and she squirms, trying to move the friction lower, but he's got his other hand clamped firmly on her hip, so there's nothing she can do but lie there and take it.
His bedside manner mask falls away quickly, and he gives her an odd look, something between wary and curious.  She can see him wavering for a moment before, as usual, curiosity wins out, and he approaches cautiously to set his tools on the small table next to her bed, the only other piece of furniture in the otherwise empty room.  He takes a careful seat on the edge of the bed, beyond the reach of her trapped limbs, and frowns at her minutely.
"I'm so glad you're here," she mumbles, eyes fluttering shut.  She hears Steve shift on the bed, feels him sit up and draw the blankets back.
Voice 1 and Voice 2 don't seem to have realized she's awake, still talking quietly, so Tony decides to do what she does best: draw attention to herself.  She groans loudly, shifting and stretching where she lays as she gets her bearings, listening for her captors' reactions, and freezes when she feels her movement arrested.
"I let you into my home, my lab, my heart, and this is how I'm repaid--with backhanded compliments," he now says disappointedly, shaking his head and tutting once as his fingers fly through the hologram. "Absolutely ungrateful."
"Oh, good, looks like Sleeping Beauty's awake," one of the voices says, drawing closer to her with the sound of footsteps.  Tony grits her teeth and cracks open her eyes, blinking through the pain as her vision slowly adjusts and the world swims into focus enough for her to recognize a face above her.
Having words doesn't fix everything.  It certainly can't replace everything that he misses, but... well.
Tony is happy to find herself pleasantly surprised, and cocks her head to peer at the guy with renewed interest, reevaluating her previous opinion of him in light of this interesting exchange.
"...Ah," he says, looking between the two of them with new understanding. "Well, then. That, unfortunately, will be why I'm here."
"Then go," Steve says firmly, drawing any remaining attention off Clint. "Do whatever you have to to get this figured out."
Still, she pauses in the moment before boarding the elevator and glances at Steve, just to confirm everything's okay.  His posture and the gleam in his eyes indicates he's staying because he has Things To Say, which is more or less fine--or has to be, because Tony can't stop him.  When Steve Rogers feels he has things to say, he won't be silenced.  SHIELD's sure proven that.
She feels rather than hears the rumble he gives. "Forgot how good that tastes," he tells her, and before she can comment he dives right back in.
"Oh. Sure, that's fine, let him in," her counterpart confirms immediately, already re-absorbed in his work. Tony could ask several questions about that, but doesn't, instead stripping off her gloves with one pointedly raised eyebrow.
(This sort of thing is nothing new--Steve almost always does this if he's nearby when she gets caught without the suit. Tony, meanwhile, with her six black belts and bevy of un-suited combat experience, always inwardly rolls her eyes, but they've had conversations about his protective behavior a million different times, and Steve never budges, so. Tony appreciates the sentiment behind Steve's actions, if not the unintended mollycoddling.)
Steve, lucid but clearly worse for the wear, has managed to sit up some and pulled the cowl down around his neck; he smiles at her gently.
"Good," he rumbles.  A few minutes later, his breathing evens out in a familiar way, and seconds later he's sound asleep.  Tony gets comfortable (by which she means she pulls her tank top back out of her armpits) and draws up her plans for the Mark XLI in her head, then settles in to wait.
"Steve found Bucky in the middle of trying to assassinate Fury--which, you know, isn't a great reunion by anyone's standards, but, anyway--so he couldn't really do anything about it.  At least, not until I'd fucked over all the death helicarriers I was helping SHIELD build." Tony can feel her face twist just thinking about it. "Long story short, Nat, Steve and I got blamed for Nick's death, had to go underground.  We had to lay low at Clint's place, and, well.  It was pretty fucked up.  We spent a lot of time rooting out all the shit Hydra had left, exposing all the operatives who'd managed to lay low the first time around.  SHIELD was almost dissolved."
"Oh, sure," he says easily, reaching for the cap to his Gatorade bottle. "If you feel ready to leave medical, I can put you up somewhere nicer." He hops down from his barstool and tilts his head, looking thoughtful. "Actually, I know just the place."
" Tony explodes frustratedly as the elevator doors slide smoothly shut behind her. Everyone but Clint and her counterpart starts at the outburst.  Natasha's eyebrows flick up and Bruce's hand jerks reflexively to his chest (Tony's probably going to kill him someday).
"Long as you're comfortable," Tony replies simply, stretching when he thumbs her nipple.  Safe sex is good sex, after all.  She hums happily and turns over in his arms to press back against him, bracing herself against the sheets.
Tony shivers heavily as the fingertips drift lightly down, down, trailing over each and every knob of her vertebrae and blazing a trail of arousal over Tony's body until, at last, they reach her tailbone.  There, the fingertips pause, lingering, and then at last they withdraw.  Tony's spine tingles all along the places where she's been touched, prickling and oversensitive.  Her breathing has grown heavier.
," she gripes, boxing at him with her tiny, un-armored hands as he starts to chuckle, "God, fuck me, you're such an asshole; I don't know why I put up with this garbage, really I don't--"
Her frantic chattering continues obliviously as Steve admires her, already aware of what her next words will be, and thinks that she's as bold, outspoken, and nervous as he expected her to be while he was mulling over his words these past few months.  She reaches out and presses her armor-covered hands almost hesitantly to his leg, glancing up at his face nervously as if Steve might object to having her hands on him. "Uhh, here, I'll just--put some pressure on this, this delicious thigh of yours--" Stark blurts, eyes darting to his with a spark of panic as she realizes what she's just said. "--holy shit I need to shut up--"
"What is this, his entire grooming kit?" Tony asks incredulously, selecting a bottle at random and making a face when it turns out to be beard shampoo.  She replaces the bottle in the caddy and eyeing it dubiously, resisting the urge to shake her head. "God, he might as well have given you the whole shower..."
She removes her fingers from the base of her skull, looks down at her hand, and grimaces: her fingers are covered in a combination of sweat, concrete dust, and hair oil, the build-up of at least a day's worth of workshop, travel, and battle time, all spent without bathing.  Tony becomes aware of a familiar uncomfortable, all-over itching sensation caused by the fine layer of grime coating her skin--which is easy enough to ignore under stress, but intolerable now that other pressing needs are taken care of and she's got a moment to actually
Tony blinks slowly and tries to rationalize things.  Clint, Natasha, Bruce, Thor, and Steve were all on the other side with her.  As far as she knows, none of them (besides Steve, the stupid, self-sacrificing idiot, but she'll think about that after she escapes) were within the event horizon, so none of them should have been sucked in.  Logically, Natasha shouldn't be here.
Man-Tony looks at the others, then back at her, and skips ahead without saying a word.  The battle blurs by until the moment when, behind her, something happens and the portal rips open before she spins toward it.
"Are you okay?" he asks urgently, one hand wrapped around the side of her neck (probably to feel her pulse, the worrywart).  Tony nuzzles into it, letting him ground her, and takes a shaky breath.
"I believe," Tony says very deliberately, slipping her leg slowly over his, "that I still have a promise to fulfill."
Tony's poor heart can only take so much.  She mumbles something in reply and flees, clambering hastily into the elevator with Clint.
"Okay," he says a few minutes later, once they've both finished their whiskey, "Now, I know you didn't come down here just to give me a reality check. What did you
"I feel like there are some important details you're not telling us," the red-head finally drawls, eyes flicking up to meet hers.  Tony feels terribly transparent.
His bicep is blank, and it's freaking her out.  She eyes him warily, unsure how to react or what to say, when Man-Tony snaps his fingers in front of her face impatiently.
Tony doesn't know how long she sits there, mind running in circles and repeatedly coming back to the same conclusion.  Her ribs, which had only mildly ached during the battle, have begun to throb, and a large, visible bruise has begun to form on her right bicep where one of the Hydra goons blasted her.
He collapses next to her, a little out of breath, and looks at her with an awed expression that pretty much conveys exactly how she feels right now.  Tony smiles.  Steve smiles back.  There's a warm glow in her chest that isn't the arc reactor, a postcoital fuzziness that she thought everyone was making up.  Looking at Steve, though, both of them basking in the glow of their first time together, she's pretty sure she knows what feeling they were talking about.
"I know," he murmurs into her scalp, and she can feel him swallow. "Logically, I know, Tony, but that doesn't stop me from being jealous."
"Did you just say 'penis,' a second ago?" Not-Tony asks suspiciously as he picks his way over.  Tony just raises a brow and continues rubbing Steve's back.
He scowls through the next New Year, though, because this is the year he's finally gonna meet his stupid nonagenarian jerk soulmate. Great. He's sure they'll enjoy their assuredly limited time together.
She can practically feel Mystery Asshole frown at her, but Tony doesn't bother using any of her strength to lift herself off the bed and posture.  Instead, she just watches him glare his way into the room and idly catalogues things--his clipped but purposeful walk, the oil stains on his forearms, the tool callouses on his hands.
She feels and sees her limbs begin to twitch, and her vision starts to blur the longer he pounds against that particular spot, hammering home the pleasure over and over again.  She realizes abruptly that those short, squeaky sounds she thought were the bed are
Other-Steve looks thrown (and a little aroused, but then Steve's always had a thing for fiery, independent brunette trailblazers), somewhat reducing Tony's opinion of him.  Man-Tony, however, is surprisingly unphased.  Point to him. "Uh, well, nowhere," he admits, "but the roof only really has cameras, if you stay away from the elevator."
The moment breaks, and Tony's eyes nearly roll back in her head as they flutter closed.  She tosses back her head and gives a full-bodied shudder, her mouth falling open on a moan as she twists helplessly, a wave of static washing over her senses as she writhes sinuously in his grip.  Steve gives an answering rumble as her body clenches hot around him, her muscles contracting with pleasure.  Tony inhales raggedly as the wave recedes and her muscles begin to tremble, and blinks helplessly against the stars still dotting her vision, her breath stuttering around the endless rise and fall of her own hips.  She squirms weakly for a moment, hands and feet searching blindly for purchase before she gives up and gives in, finally relinquishing control.
"You've got to coax it out of them," Tony says, sidling back onto her stool. "Steve's pretty funny, once he loosens up." She glances over at the machine with Steve's suit in it. It's whirring along happily without any apparent supervision.
Something plastic scrapes against the stone of the bench as it's set down, and Tony shivers once, unable to move from beneath the hot spray of the shower.  Then, there's a small pause.
"Whatever," she finally says with a wave of her hand. "Let's go get this over with.  And before you ask, no, I'm not going to bother cleaning up; I'm pretty sure Barton's sex-Bloodhound abilities hold constant in any universe."
Logan has always thought it's convenient that his words explain how a nearly immortal guy might feasibly meet his soulmate.
Steve pants against her shoulder for a few more seconds, his breath hot and humid as he comes down from his own orgasm.  "It felt pretty much continuous," he admits eventually, muttering into her skin.  Tony laughs.
"Did you hear me, Tinkerbell?" he says again, straightening further where he's still turned away from her. His hands leave their vice grip on the edge of the table to press hard against the glass top, instead. "I said
Several seconds pass in tense silence, until suddenly he snaps. He slams his hands on the table and rounds on her; she flinches at the sound, stumbling back a step as he finishes turning to face her. Tony just stares at him like a deer in the headlights. She's looking, she's staring right at his expression, but despite all that she still feels like she can't accurately describe what she sees.
"We need to discuss how you plan on getting the two of us home," Steve agrees firmly from where he's standing at Tony's elbow, as usual.  His blue eyes are serious and solid.
And when he met Peggy, well...it was just a happy sort of coincidence that she also didn't have any words.
Steve's still looking at her. "Do you want me to go with you?" he asks. Tony appreciates that he makes it an offer, not a demand.
Throughout this speech, Steve has gone from looking dubious to looking dubiously reassured.  He reaches down to brush her hair away from her face and says, "As long as what I said before still goes."
He stiffens as the headless body drops, neck sparking violently, to reveal a young guy in all black with the head clutched in his all-metal arm.
"I--well--" Tony's gaze skitters back to his blank arm again before she blurts, "Steve and I are sort of--soulmates."
Tony's inner Clint comments snidely, because everyone on the team knows that Tony likes to call Steve 'soldier' in the bedroom, and no one on the team can appreciate the way Steve reacts when she dirty talks to him in public places.  Tony smiles to herself, remembering many memorable reactions and scoldings, and ignores the twinge that pinches beneath her breastbone when no one in the room around them says a thing.
His memories, after all that, aren't exactly A+. He forgets when his words first showed up, so for a while, he avoids anything that has to do with old people.
"Done letting Clint poke it?" Tony offers as she comes over to meet him, grabbing his full attention. Steve smiles and hefts the lumpy bundle in his arms.
He's got her propped up on one of his thighs, her legs splayed around his, and Tony is absolutely drenching his skin.  She rubs nonsensically against his leg, already babbling and begging and strung up tight as he plays her body like a well-tuned instrument.
"Yeah.  How am I gonna get home," she finishes, carefully closing her eyes.  She's been avoiding thinking about that for a reason.
, Tony," he groans, sounding wrecked, and she gasps as he thrusts, testing, shuddering as he bumps right against her g-spot.
Tony idly absorbs all of this from her prone position amid a cast of battle-ready heroes and a startled Doctor Strange, and, slowly but surely, she feels the steady, rhythmic throb of an impending stress headache fire up just behind her temples.
There's a moment of silence where all Tony can hear is her own ragged breathing, but then Steve's hands pull away and she scrambles up onto her elbows just in time to see him push his sweatpants down to his hips, the thin cotton fabric making it easy.
After everything he's lost, no matter what Steve left behind when he took the plunge and drove that plane down into the ice... in the end, he gained a soulmate for it.
Tony stares back at him, uncowed. "See if you can access the footage from my--from the suit."  She bites her tongue; be diplomatic, she thinks, she can be diplomatic with herself--himself--
So instead, she looks at Steve speculatively, and says, "Once this is wrapped up, I'm gonna suck your dick."
"I'm gonna go use the bathroom," she declares with a tone that brooks no argument. "That gives you anywhere from five to ten minutes to mull this over, depending on how long it takes me to poop."
"Well, you'll need it for the trip home, if nothing else," he agrees. His jaw cracks on a yawn, and he glances at the time on his phone, then quirks a brow. "Nightcap?"
Steve's reaction is hilarious. He looks like Tony's just punched him in the gut, but in a positive way, if that makes sense. Tony doesn't really care if it does, because now that he's recovered his pretty blue eyes are going all dark and hooded and--that's a smirk. Captain America is
His enthusiastic attempts to introduce Steve to other wordless people dramatically increased in number, after that.  Girl after girl after guy came traipsing through their lives, and Steve wasn't stupid: it didn't take him long to figure out that the main reason Bucky was trying so damn hard to set him up was so he'd have somebody else to lean on if Bucky ended up dying in the war.
"God, I'm a piece of work," she mutters to the room at large. She leans back in the chair and thinks back to the damage she saw on her suit earlier, and begins drafting a rough repair plan in her mind while she waits patiently for Sleeping Beauty to wake.
Steve looks at her thoughtfully for a moment, considering.  Tony stares back at him, bemused, as the silence stretched on, and feels a flicker of alarm when his eyes begin to glitter mischievously.  She leans away in the circle of his arms, giving him a warning glance as he cuts off her escape and slowly pulls her in.
did.  Steve and I set him up in a Brooklyn apartment with just enough surveillance to make sure Hydra didn't get him again, got him weekly appointments with one of the best Vet counsellors in the country, and let him be.  We had a couple kidnapping attempts, but nothing Steve and I couldn't handle.  Also," Tony adds, almost as an afterthought, "I did a lot of work improving his arm, polishing it up, removing all the trackers and other bullshit Hydra'd put in there.  Works like a dream, now, I gotta say," Tony brags proudly, tossing her hair and very deliberately ignoring the cloud of dust that shakes off of it.
Tony sighs and deflates minutely, bracing a hand on her hip.  She scrubs a hand through her hair tiredly, already weary of this pointless, self-induced thought puzzle.  It's already obvious she's not going to figure it out without some help.  She'll just have to bounce it off Steve later.
The door, unremarkable in appearance, is notable in that it's the only one even remotely proximal to her counterpart's.  It's not
Of course.  "Yeah, I don't know why I bothered expecting anything different.  Fancy a stroll up on the rooftops, darling?"
"None of your business," he tells her, words so precise he practically spits them. He stares at her with real, open hatred in his eyes, then stalks around the table and starts cleaning up, shoving circuits and servos this way and that with sharp, irritated movements.
Tony's very slow, very reluctant return to consciousness is eased by Steve's soft, skin-warmed t-shirt under her cheek.
"I guess you'll do," she acquiesces after what she feels is an adequate amount of feigned hemming and hawing. Man-Tony shakes his head.
And sure enough, to Erskine, Steve's blank skin was just another item on an apparently long list of qualifications that named him a good candidate for the serum.  And, after the serum happened... well.
"Did you hear me?" he asks again, face warping into an expression of mock curiosity, a sign he's well and truly mad. "I told you to
"Don't laugh at me.  That was a completely legitimate insult." Tony scowls as Steve leans up to kiss her, which she grudgingly allows.
" Steve--her Steve--says over the comms, his voice echoing around them.  The other, new Avengers are silent.
"I don't suppose you can let me in, JARVIS," Tony offers, wrinkling her nose at the giant painting of himself Man-Tony has chosen to display in this particular location. Ugh.
"Ugh--well, let's hope he thought to include a razor somewhere in there, because if you keep that carpet on your face growing for much longer you're going to sand off a layer of my skin," Tony complains, rubbing against the spot where his blonde five o' clock shadow had scratched against the tender skin of her face.
so?" he returns, one hand palming her breast.  She grins and makes a gesture towards the bedside drawer.
"JARVIS, are my clothes back from the laundry room yet?" she asks, already dreading the answer.  Steve freezes with one leg in his sweatpants, eyes meeting hers.
The biggest differences Tony can see between their towers (besides the whole Stark-not-Avengers thing) come from her counterpart's absolutely garish tastes in interior decorating. Not all of it's bad, to be fair--mahogany? Good, great; dark woods are always an excellent choice. Glass and steel surfaces? Perfect, Tony's on board; modernism is always the way to go, when tastefully applied. She strolls idly through the kitchen area and past the residential spaces with a vague, almost perverted sort of curiosity. As with the tower back home, Pepper clearly had a hand in all this. Tony can see her touches everywhere--the flowers on the drawing board by the elevator; the Ming vase sitting on the bar... This place is clearly as much Pepper's as it is Other Tony's.
"Back up, buddy, or we're gonna have a problem," she bites out, hands clenching into fists despite the padded shackles holding her to the bed.
It also means that when his words first pop up in the 1910s, he's pretty pissed off at the whole goddamn universe.
Her grin is positively wicked.  Steve helps her up, not once looking away from her face as she presses close to him even through the armor, and thinks that she, the woman with whom he'll be spending the rest of his life, looks like the cat who caught the canary.
Suddenly, Steve begins to cough, disturbing the dust that's settled on him, and gives a full-bodied wheeze before he tenses and rolls towards Tony, blinking and squinting at her face.
"Tony," Steve says suddenly, catching both her fists and leaning in seriously, his blue eyes twinkling into hers. "I love you."
"But you think whoever did this used a relic," Tony's counterpart guesses, once again proving that he thinks along exactly the same lines she does.
She pauses at the threshold, tumblers clinking in her hand, then steels herself and steps cautiously inside.
Steve's fervent reply of "Yes, please" is all she needs to tuck him gently back into his pants, zip him up, and lead the way into the hall, his hand clutching hers.
"My own whiskey," he says with faint amusement, still blinking sleep from his eyes. "You shouldn't have."
"Why, Captain Rogers," Tony says, equal parts shocked, delighted, and strangely aroused, "are you telling me that you're
Steve's looking at her now, a little angrier, and blurts out as if he can't help it, "And that's it?"
Tony shrugs. "No worries; it was worth a shot." If he's not gentleman enough to open the door, she'll just have to let herself in. She hacks his security systems with an ease that is almost insulting, and the lab door opens with a hiss.
Logan lands right on one of the tin cans' backs and begins ripping it to fucking pieces. He's gotta hand it to Charles: some good old fashioned destruction is exactly what he needed.
doesn't have my words on his arm, so as bad as I might feel for him, honey--because he's been dealt a shit hand, you can't deny that--you come first.  You will
"So," Bucky says later, the two of them watching as Hank maneuvers gracefully around to land on a roof adjacent to theirs, "when are you moving to Brooklyn?"
"None currently, Miss; as far as my sensors can tell this is some kind of--" JARVIS cuts off, static garbling whatever he was going to say next.  Tony frowns as her display flickers.
"Okay.  Well, it was worth a shot," Tony mutters, closing her eyes and lifting one hand to her temple as her headache rears its ugly head, a wave of pain pulsing through her as she sways back from the couch.  Steve takes her other hand, and she leans against him, steadying herself.
Thor smiles and acquiesces with a nod.  "Very well.  I will return as soon as I am able."  Then, cape swirling majestically as per usual, Thor clunks over to the torn up balcony and, with great dignity and unparalleled grace, throws himself out of the window.
"Thanks for all your help," Steve says to him, purely and utterly serious. Ahh, the sincerity: it's one of those things Tony loves about Steve, among his many other positives.
"I'll find my suit and shield," Steve agrees, looking steadier and more determined now that they're sorting themselves out.  Tony smiles.
Steve's right.  He's completely right, as usual, but that doesn't mean Tony has to like it, and now her vision is getting all misty.
This-Steve seems to still be absorbing all of this. "And...you and I...?" he says, looking at her with a furrowed brow and that pinched-mouth thing he gets when he's upset.
shit.  Her life--Steve's life, Thor's life, Natasha's life--has not and never has been easy, by any means.
"I'm ready to talk about the suit now," Tony says, because she feels like that's a good way to get out of her current situation.
Eventually, Tony runs out of things to judge silently, and ends up standing at the bottom of the lab stairway contemplating the very closed, very locked door.
Her stomach turns.  It's an uncomfortable reminder that this universe's inhabitants are different from the people she knows.  Even Thor, usually so generous and lively, and who is so far definitely the closest match to his counterpart of any of the other Avengers (besides maybe Clint), has a weariness to him, a somber, weighted quality that the Thor Tony knows doesn't possess.  And Thor--
"I thought you were going to find the lab," he says, a question in his eyes. Bruce glances at Steve and frowns.
"I wonder if that was multiple consecutive orgasms rather than just one," Tony says after a while, thinking aloud.  It certainly went on long enough.
"I don't know how it went, here," she begins, "you know--the whole 'SHIELD is Hydra' thing," she pauses to look at Steve's reaction, but his face is carefully blank now, so she continues, "but for us, well.  It was a bit of a shitshow."  Which is an understatement.  Tony looks down.
"Why are you in handcuffs?" Steve asks with suspicious confusion, concern growing on his face.  Tony sighs.
There are tears dripping down her temples when she comes to, and she reaches up to touch them with an unsteady hand, physically and emotionally shaky.  Steve has stopped and is gazing down at her with concern, his eyes searching her face worriedly.
The elevator doors open behind them before Tony can say anything else or, god forbid, Not-Steve can ask anymore uncomfortably personal questions about Bucky or Logan, and Clint pokes his head out.
Now that she's thinking rationally, Tony's fairly surprised she missed the arc reactor their first go around--it's pretty obvious, though, then again, she can see how she'd miss it, since earlier, she wasn't really looking.
So instead he stares at her flatly. "Thanks, princess, but there's a far better likelihood I'll be spending the next few years wiping someone else's wrinkly ass."
him," Tony corrects proudly, patting Steve's bicep like the well-pleased partner she is. The man in question looks down at her, his eyes twinkling in amusement. "Hey--watch my ankles," Tony warns as they approach the narrow entryway into the kitchen, craning her neck to see over her fiancé's enormous triceps.
All these people fumbling around in the dark with no idea who they might meet when, or if anybody is really right for them.  Who fits?  Who doesn't?  Who's really meant to be?  They could pass the love of their life in the street one day and walk away, never to see them again, and spend the rest of their years unfulfilled, never knowing why.  So many uncertainties, so many what-ifs--so many potential missed chances--and no guarantees.  It would drive Tony nuts, even just the thought of it.
"Don't think you're getting out of it that easily," Tony mutters under her breath as they cross the room. "We
"It'd be good if I could get the armor operable again," she grinds out reluctantly, running over all the damage in her head. "It shouldn't take too long, if I can get the Man-Beast to let me use his lab.  And even if he won't, I'm sure I can still get in without his permission."
want to see your face again," he spits. His eyes glitter with hostility, driving home what would have a deep blow, three years ago.
"Sure," Tony says, staring back at the man with eyes that are probably the size of dinnerplates.  She glances over her shoulder at Steve, just to confirm, and he shrugs gamely, obviously not as painfully aware of the subtext like she is.
Stark has handed off the situation and is on her way over to him before Steve can even rise.  As she crosses the plaza, moving surprisingly quickly on the ground for someone wearing something so bulky, some smooth-looking joint in her armor turns and retracts her faceplate, revealing a very worried, very pretty woman.
Tony goes, climbing up into the bed with him in a way that is probably not good for their injuries, but since when does Tony give a shit?  She wiggles underneath the blankets and sighs when Steve pulls them up and over, covering them both in the soft kind of cotton she would have chosen.
Steve finally does, openly laughing as Tony seethes and fumes wrathfully at his face, intercepting and batting away her flailing, ineffectual punches with easy hands as she swings her tiny fists angrily at his body.
"You think you can pull this childish temper tantrum bullshit with me? Let me tell you, Manscape, I wrote the fucking
"'Warn him off'?  Steve, he might think I'm a hot piece, sure, but I'm sure it doesn't stretch much deeper than that." She stares back at him in amused disbelief.  An incredulous feeling builds inside her when his expression doesn't change, and Tony finally blurts out, "
"I need to get back to the library," Doctor Strange is saying somewhere in the background as Tony sways towards Steve, leaning on him less because she
A knock sounds on the door as Steve begins rolling up her cuff, and her counterpart enters the room.  He takes in the scene before him and wordlessly raises his eyebrows.
It's so unexpected, Steve forgets how to breathe for a moment and chokes on his own saliva.  It takes him a minute to recover, but once he does, he gives her a very deliberate
He shifts behind her and her heart speeds up, anticipation building.  She feels the tip of him brush against her as he lines himself up, and she moans, pressing back with her hips impatiently until he slides those first few inches in.  Something inside her uncoils with the
Bruce covers his smile with his hand and waits a moment before clarifying, "Well, maybe not in the physical sense.  It's, well...you seem to know me, but I don't know you."
A particularly cold gust of wind blows across the roof, and Tony shivers.  Steve reaches out with one big arm and tugs her closer to him, folding her in against his side.  Tony snuggles up to him and sighs, love and contentment blooming warm over the knot within her.
Steve laughs, moving up her body and planting kisses at he goes, before kissing her cheek.  She makes a face and shoves a pillow at him.
"Well, Mr. Potter, it's not Hogwarts, but welcome to our humble muggle common room," Man-Tony declares after exiting in the lead, gesturing widely to the lounge proper as they all make their way inside. Doctor Strange seems amused.
"Sounds reasonable," Man-Tony agrees, picking a small piece of gravel out of his own clothing and flicking it off idly into some shadowy corner of the roof. He looks back at the rest of the party, whose eyes are on him, and cocks his head jauntily towards the elevator. "Let's move this party down to the lounge, shall we?"
"Did you, now?" Tony replies, curious where this is going.  She leans into Steve's touch as his thumb begins stroking against her jaw.
And with that, JARVIS must decide it's time to end this conversation.  Tony risks letting go of Steve's hand to waggle her fingers in a wave, which Clint returns sarcastically as the elevator doors slide smoothly shut.
sorry," a man's voice is saying, sounding sincerely alarmed and apologetic, "I had no idea anyone would be up here at this time of night; I didn't think to look--"
The dust has fully cleared by the time Tony calms, sobs quieting to sniffles as she gathers herself against him, letting the rough but soothing fabric of his uniform and his familiar hand stroking her hair ground her.  She gives one last hearty sniff and straightens, blinking blearily at him.
"Hey," Logan says quietly, drawing back, "don't worry about any of that. I've been shot through the head and lived, Buck; you can't hurt me. Besides," he adds, pushing his claws out of his free hand, the metal glinting in the sunlight, "you think I was born with these?"
She finds Steve on the balcony level with Bruce and Clint, looking over Steve's damaged suit. They all look up when she comes in, and Clint immediately raises both his eyebrows.
Eventually, once he'd let off some steam, things settled and he could think more clearly.  Part of him was feather-light, giddy with the revelation that
"Man, the public thinks you're all apple pie honesty, Steve, but secretly you're as manipulative as I am," Tony complains as they make their way to the elevator.  "I ought to expose you for the liar you are.  'Captain America--Secret Asshole.'  I bet the
Tony waits another moment, until she's sure the elevator doors have closed behind him, before she speaks.
His soulmate frowns, then perks up, touching the communicator in his ear, before all the robots shut down abruptly and drop to the ground like flies. Logan is grudgingly impressed.
wouldn't use one." He sits back in his seat, a shadow passing over his brow. "I can think of exactly one way to make it possible without, but since your universe
"Without meeting the caster or seeing the spell? No," Doctor Strange says confidently, his expression almost apologetic.  His eyes flicker down to Tony's side, and Tony realizes her hand has tightened into a fist. She takes a breath, steadying herself, and forces her hand to relax.
Tony murmurs agreement, but that's quickly choked off in favor of a breathless inhale when his hand dips lower, just brushing over her lips and the wetness that's been forming there for hours, now.  She shivers and twitches when his fingers dance over her clit, and her hands shoot down to grasp his wrist.  He glances up at her questioningly.
He jumps to another robot when the first begins to plummet, and is busy slashing into its chest cavity when the fucker spins out and plows them both into the side of a building. The explosion throws him down onto the street, and he lands with a grunt, shaking off soot and gritting his teeth as the burn wounds heal. Goddamn robots--at least the Sentinals didn't blow up, for chrissakes.
and she almost wants to tell Steve to stop but she can't, every cell in her body wound up tight enough to burst, until suddenly just when she thinks she might pass out she crests the peak and the wire snaps.
"Don't try to tell me how long I should be pooping for, Clint. Rude," Tony chides, hopping off the table anyway.
Steve thinks for a moment. "I can't get sick," he admits, rubbing himself against her thigh languidly, "so...we can go without, I suppose."
Too tired to do formatting (AKA add italics) right now; it's midnight and I have class tomorrow.  Second half is good, but I'll go back and format the first half properly during the day tomorrow.
"Yeah, real proud of that one, aren't you?" Tony mutters fondly, scratching the hair at the back of his head.  Steve arches into the touch like a cat and rumbles, "Got you to laugh, didn't it?"
This kid--Logan glances at the arm--he's, what; the Winter Soldier? He looks again at his soot-smudged brow, well-toned muscles, and fairly impressive pout.
Captain America looks like he's about to crack more ribs than he already has, if he starts laughing, but instead he exercises some very manful control over himself, places his hand over hers on his now sluggishly bleeding thigh, and says: "Please do shut up, Miss Stark."
Once she calms down, breath slowing and sweat drying in an uncomfortable, itchy layer on her skin, Tony can think a little more rationally.
Tony shrieks, all incoherent noises at this point, and she can distantly feel her hands scrabble against the sheets while her arms spasm and flail uncontrollably.  Her legs, especially, are twitching badly, and she worries that she might kick him in the head until he does this
For all her bluster and hero play, Tony actually really hates confrontation. And her counterpart hasn't exactly been welcoming, to be fair, but Tony is also self-aware enough to recognize that that reasoning in itself is just an invented excuse to avoid him. If someone dropped in on her doorstep wearing an Iron Man suit, she'd have the same reaction.
Steve chuffs at that, his laughter puffing through her hair.  "I hate that movie," he says, but sounds amused anyway.
"Shit, I'm fucked, I'm fucked!" she curses over the comm, putting as much power into her forward thrust as she can before she hits the horizon and goes--somewhere. "Shit, shit,
He closes it down abruptly, whatever it was, and whips around to shoot her a seething, hateful glare. It's so sudden Tony flinches back in shock.
"Oh, we already have a problem, princess," the man replies, scowling at her with a strangely familiar glare. "We had problems when you stole my tech.  That suit you were wearing is property of Stark Industries."
Tony eyes them both narrowly for a moment before she replies to Steve's question.  "Yes.  I'm filthy, so I'm getting in the shower.  I assume my Lancôme products are gone?" she adds, looking at her counterpart.
Steve," Tony pleads, writhing in his grip and reaching back to grasp at his hair, his neck, his shoulders, any bit of him she can reach in her desperation.  She's
Tony can feel a mischievous smile creep across her cheeks as she watches his pupils dilate.  Instead of replying, she says, "JARVIS, lock the door, please."
"Nah, I deserved it," he snorts, staring down into his drink ruefully. "I was being a jackass." He contemplates it for another minute, rotating the glass between his palms, then sighs and takes another swallow.
It's clear just from initial observations that nobody was prepared this (well, insofar as they, the Avengers, are ever
Steve turns to look at her and stills, two loaves of multigrain in his hands. Tony's heart sinks in her chest behind the arc reactor, and she swallows against a sudden, unexpected dryness in her throat, blinking back moisture that wasn't in her eyes a moment ago. She risks a glance at Steve and is immediately glad she did, because the solemn, knowing sadness she sees on his face matches the ache she feels in her heart right now.
"I see," Man-Tony says, watching as Steve finishes with Tony's other cuff. "Well, I, or rather Pepper, can help with the second, so, follow me.  Cap, you're welcome to come too, if you want."
" Tony's disembodied voice says as she peers at Steve's profile while they fly to their destination.  Looking into the camera, Steve gives her a fond look.
Natasha looks speculative.  Tony eyes her warily as the Russian super-spy rounds the table, trailing her fingers down Tony's armor.
"Is chicken salad good with both of you?" Steve asks then, before the moment can stretch on too long and become an uncomfortable silence. Tony's grateful for the interjection--grateful just for his presence, frankly.
Steve's words are in the most brazen, obvious spot: if he doesn't wear long sleeves, anyone on the street can see them, curling in an absurd number of lines around and around the center of his left bicep (the only thing that keeps him from throwing all the t-shirts SHIELD gave him in the dumpster is the fact that the handwriting is so slanted and loopy, it's nearly illegible).  Steve knows there's no scientific proof that the location of your words has anything to do with your soulmate's personality, but when he first saw the mark, all he could think was,
.  Even in the best case scenario, he'd have been waiting for them for years.  There was no ending where things didn't turn out badly, no future where he didn't spend most of his life up sad, lonely, and pining.
"Your thing for working women is silly," she scolds him, shaking her head. Steve, as usual, is entirely unrepentant, mischief lurking in his eyes.
It's like the physical representation of all the self-hatred she's ever felt, gathered and concentrated and given material form. Every dark thought and moment of anger, every black, foul mood, is manifested on his face. The malice she had only glimpsed earlier is back, fully formed, roaring in his eyes and in the twist of his face. His nostrils flare as he breathes in.
"I really thought they wouldn't be able to wait," Bruce admits with a frown, staring mournfully into his orange juice.  Natasha just looks sour.
"What..." he begins, but falls silent as soon as Tony herself comes jogging into the room on-screen, face serious as the lights come up and illuminate her path to the suits.
.  Something imprecise, something Tony can't pin down at first glance.  This Thor seems older, somehow, more burdened than the Thor that she knows so well.  He seems...tired.  Less free.  The passion and pride Tony's used to is still there, of course, but if she were to try and put a word to it, all of Thor's
Once he'd finished, Steve lowered his arm slowly and stood in front of the mirror for a long, long time.  Just stood there and stared at the words he could see without moving his arm, speechless.  The absurd middle line
The wind was knocked out of her the second her back hit the ground, and Tony reels, flailing, when she finally comes to a halt, gasping for air.
Howard Stark had put about ten million round-the-clock guards on her, and gotten her extremely thorough self-defense training from the time she could walk for good measure. Good old overprotective Daddy dearest.
Tony's mouth feels like it's full of cotton.  She tries to open her eyes, but just as quickly she's shutting them with a wince--someone's got the brights on in here, what the
"JARVIS, any answers to that question?" Tony asks loudly, watching with mild interest as the surrounding concrete and debris begins to gravitate towards the phenomenon, which seems to only be increasing in power.  Tony
you move that your broad shoulders are currently the only thing between our gracious host's eyes and my vagina," Tony informs Steve faux-casually.  He stiffens in a completely unenjoyable way against her thighs, and yanks the sheet up the bed so hard Tony hears threads rip.
"You're the light of my life, Steve," Tony finally confesses shakily. "I love you so much it scares me, sometimes."
"'Cause I thought my mark was about baseball, and I was shit at it," Bucky replies without taking his hand from Logan's. Logan huffs and shakes his head.
Still, the strangest thing about waking up, without question, was discovering his skin is no longer blank.
"STEVE!"  Tony vaults over a piece of glass and scrambles towards him, cursing her handcuffed hands for slowing her down.
They all head up to the next level (even Tony, who is still in handcuffs) to investigate, regardless.  Sure enough, maybe ten feet from the suspiciously Tony-shaped hole in Man-Stark's balcony (which Tony can only assume is from her own arrival), a second cloud of dust is settling.
There's a moment where, despite them both being awake, neither of them says anything. Tony does her counterpart the courtesy of pretending she's not paying attention, giving him a minute to finish waking fully and gather his thoughts.
Tony allows her mind to wander as Steve sucks on her tongue.  It's baffling, really, how easy it is to lose herself in the foreplay--at least, when it comes to Steve.  Tony used to be all about the quick and dirty, but sometimes she thinks she could sit and just kiss Steve for hours, lost in the feel of his body against hers, all his wet little pants and groans against her mouth as his body scrapes against hers.  He's gotten way more aggressive about taking control of the bed since the first time they met (which is hot as fuck and Tony is five hundred percent on board, yes please), which was also new, since Tony's pretty used to be Head Bitch In Charge.
Tony spends fifteen or twenty frustrating minutes struggling heavily against her padded restraints on the easily queen-sized bed, jerking and thrashing and swearing with all of her pent up frustration at both her shitty situation and her friend's unexpected betrayal.  The bed, despite her efforts, does not budge an inch.  All she does is piss herself off further, leaving her panting and sweaty on the bed after she gives up while her mind positively boils with rage.
She can feel the pads of his fingers touching her inner thighs right below where her panties are soaking through her jeggings (don't judge; it's a legitimate fashion choice) and it makes her squirm, press down in his grip without thinking until she's grinding against his lap, making his hands clench and spasm, and
"You've got some real nasty bumps, there," he says after a moment of awkward silence, nodding to her bicep, and probably also indicating the other various scrapes and dings Tony can't see but always has. "Mind if I take a look?"
"...Yes, my father may indeed know," Thor admits, after a brief moment of consideration.  He even seems somewhat hopeful about it, his expression clearly more optimistic, which lightens the mood of the room considerably and relieves Clint of most of the scrutiny.  "But," Thor adds, because of course there's a 'but', "I must return to Asgard, in order to speak with him."
"Yes, JARVIS?" she says, setting her tools down on the bench where she's been busy reshaping the upper chest panels on her suit.
"Thank you," he says, very seriously and earnestly, his big hand warm on her skin.  Tony swallows and, despite the heat that's immediately pooling low in her abdomen, glances at his arm.  His bicep is still very bare.
" he revises quickly, glancing over at Tony and Steve as if to remind himself that she and him are, indeed, still two separate entities.
you, Tony, not just physically."  Steve's quiet for another moment before he admits, "I would, too.  I think he feels exactly the way I would, if I didn't have you."
for it, driven wild as one of his hands splays over her stomach, fingers spreading possessively over her skin as the other strokes up the inside of her thigh, so close, so close but
Bruce looks at her quietly for a moment. "Thanks for telling us," he says finally. There's the smallest crease of worry in his brow, probably for the state of Man-Tony's already fragile mental health. Clint, meanwhile, watches everyone with unsettlingly perceptive eyes, then looks at the clock.
"Which one?" Man-Tony asks before she can, his eyes lifting to meet hers briefly through the hologram.
Once her trembling has mostly subsided, Steve makes his move.  His hands tighten on her hips, fingers clenching around her pelvic bone, and he lifts her again, raising her up slowly before fucking her back down on his cock.
Steve's caught on now, and he slides his hand over her thigh as she settles on his lap. "Oh?  And what would that be?"
Tony releases her death-grip on his skin, and moves her hands, dizzily, onto the bent knee underneath that he's been using to support them. Steve's right arm shifts away to give her space, and Tony tries, weakly, to lift her head, but is immediately overcome by another wave of vertigo. She sucks in a breath and bows forward again, bracing herself over the shelf of Steve's thigh; his left arm follows her down, cradling her back as he murmurs something soothingly over the buzzing in Tony's ears. She presses her forehead into the unfamiliar fabric of his borrowed sweatpants and heaves through breath after breath, eyes blinking rapidly against the tide of dizziness washing over her like a sea. She feels Steve's left hand stroking gently over her back, and focuses on trying not to vomit all over his leg.
the last person in the world to see it, because holy shit the movie mythos is a loooooot different than the canon.
"I didn't ask," Steve replies, and Tony's about to huff out a laugh but then Steve folds back over her and pushes in.
"Alright, whoa; calm down, Cap," Man-Tony says, glancing between them with a look of--horror?  Interest?  It's honestly hard to tell-- "Just wanted to let you know that Thor, uh, just arrived from Asgard.  He's waiting upstairs."
