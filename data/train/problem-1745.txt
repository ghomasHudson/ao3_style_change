“That doesn’t answer my question,” Cas said, stumbling to the side when he tried to take a step towards the blue flames. This wasn’t holy fire. The pain increased and he fell to his knees again.
“You already have. I heard you ask Sherlock for a hug -- did he give you one?”
“Yeah, these are a specialty,” John snickered beside him. “We have those at the Shack too, if you wanna play. We also got Twister, that could be interesting.”
To his surprise, John appeared to take it lightly and without fuss. The knot of anxiety didn’t dissolve until John’s warm gaze rested on Sherlock’s. “Let’s just make sure I’m aware of
“Liar,” John smiled, throwing an arm around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulling him closer so that they’re sides and thighs were pressed together. He planted a kiss on Sherlock’s cheek, a thumb caressing the refined cheekbone. “Come on. You know I won’t let it go. Out with it.”
Settling on a plan, she messaged Adler’s instagram account. She will deal with her first thing tomorrow. In the grand scheme of things, Adler was a useless casualty, John would not miss her. Mary even less so. And if the girl thought she could steal John from her, she was dead wrong. And they knew each other for how long, two weeks? Mary knew John for years. Adler is
“Doesn’t mean you can’t allow others to give back to you,” Irene said, lashes fluttering at the man prettily. Hm, his birthday was less than two months away and they’ll be gone by then, but she can still make him a present and leave it for Mrs Hudson to hand over.
Sherlock stirred and smacked his lips, but he didn’t wake up. If anything, he tucked in closer to John’s side. The arm wrapped around John’s chest tightened for a second, then relaxed again. John pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s temple and arched his neck to see where his phone was. It rested on the coffee table, a little off-bounds and out of John’s reach, but with enough mindful extrication so as not to wake up Sherlock he managed to get a hold of it.
“Sentiment,” John grinned, patting Sherlock’s chest lightly. “And thank you for taking care of Rosie at night. You didn’t sleep at all, did you?”
“I’m glad you’re trying to get better,” Cas said, looking intently at Greg. Dean nudged him under the table in hopes to pass on that his angel manners were shining through. It worked; Cas snapped back and, rather stiffly, leaned backwards in his chair.
Both Sherlock and Castiel frowned at him. “What do you mean?”
“True. The thing is, TARDIS is recharging.”
Into battle
“No. I don’t think he did. But at this point I had to hurry up and decide who to follow next. I’ve never gone after Moran, but I recognised the scent of his clothes to be from an area in the centre of town. It’s a rich neighbourhood, but the food is bleh. All granola and healthy. I will go there tomorrow and see whether I can dig up dirt on him. But back to Mary.
*~*~*~*~*
Sherlock sighed dreamily as he followed John’s back make its way across the square, disappearing here and there among the common folk. At last, he snapped out of his head, stuffing hands in his pockets. He had to fetch Lestrade, remind him of his passionate hatred of the O’Learys, and return to the Shack so that he can snog John again.
“Well, I’m old,” he countered. “I like serenity and peace and quiet sometimes, ya know? And I don’t see why exactly you’d choose the Shack for a party anyway. It’s not the most appealing of places besides the abominable attractions we glue together with glitter and broken dreams of tourists who thought our merch was cheap. Seriously.”
Since they didn't start the Knockback Jinx yet and Wingardium Leviosa wasn't going to be exactly useful, John had to think on his feet. That's why he grabbed a thick Charms book from his backpack and threw it at the guy with all his might.
Sherlock put his glass of juice on the counter. “I’m not Jesus to be questioned.”
“What do you mean?”
have a double update!
in which there is a reunion
“What are you listening to?” John said after he’d taken his right earplug out. “You’re going to be deaf before we even arrive at the show.”
Oh, now this was something he definitely could do without pulling his hair out. John Watson was a blessing in disguise,
John blinked, Greg barely suppressing his own smirk. “Do you think that’s… acceptable for a first date? Shouldn’t it be, I don’t know, more secluded?”
“That’s because I was implying one. C’mon, eat. Gotta feed you up.”
That definitely got John’s attention. His brows hitched up, he let out a slow, deep breath and straightened his hurting back. He’s going to have a hunch with so much studying. Sherlock, who picked up on his discomfort, smiled slyly.
"Look, I appreciate your willingness to help, but you don’t need to stretch yourself thin," Harry said and stood up. "I think that we should get Umbridge and the horcrux sorted out first. Maybe Draco will reach out before that."
“Uh, thanks?” Dean said, brows furrowed. “Thanks for the slurpee.”
And then Professor Trlawney had moved onto Carl. Taking the teacup from his dark hands, she took one look at the porcelain before gasping and letting go. Carl had had just enough reflexes to save it from hitting the floor and breaking into pieces.
, has he seriously never interacted with people that often? “Cas,” Dean started. He thought about how to phrase his question in a simple, non harmful manner. “How come you know shit about humans? I mean… no offense, but you can be a bit lost on occasion. How many times have you been stationed on Earth?”
, John thought to himself, huffing out a nervous laugh. Jesus, this was embarrassing. Why did he even bring up dancing? Everything about Sherlock was distracting -- the proximity, the contact, his purple shirt that was now under John’s fingertips, his breath close to John’s…. It was overwhelming, but in a good way. This…
“Why ever not?”
Into battle!
“Why was he taken to jail? Did a sailor murder him there?” he pushed.
“I’ve never heard of that movie.”
“One of them said a fortune teller from another town warned them about the ghost,” Sherlock explained, eyes twinkling. Oh, this will be exciting! “Apparently the ghost killed two men from a neighbouring town in the past month or so.”
“No, Greg Lestrade has a dark blue aura that has been bonded for years.”
Thank you all for reading, and I wish you all a happy day/night wherever you are~
“What the -- you’re a mermaid! How come I didn’t notice them? I swam underwater!”
“I’ve heard of this,” Seb said, snapping the file closed and smacking it on the desk. “I suppose that’s why you want to buy it out, obviously.”
Sam chuckled, pushing his empty plate from him. “Alright, if she won’t be bothered. We’d really like to reconcile with her. We don’t have almost any family left, so it would be nice to meet someone familial, albeit distant.”
"Wow, when do you have the time to notice it?" said John, smiling. Sherlock shrugged as if it was nothing.
“John?”
,” John said, closing the door behind him. He tucked off his shoes and shook his head, laughing. “I mean, I knew this town was weird, but this just takes it to another level.”
“We got our first dog when I was what, ten?” John said. “He was born on July fifth. I think we bought him in October. For seventy bucks from some dude who worked as a guard at a facility where my father sometimes worked his shifts as a welder.”
“Three!” they yelled in unison, and jumped off.
Irene watched, horrified by how fast this went to shit. Mike blurted out apologies, but Molly shushed him, rightfully pointing out it’s not his fault, and she looked up.
“Sherlock, you okay?” John said, looking him up and down.
“I appreciate it, and I’d consider it, but I don’t like lying,” John said, voice hoarse.
“Stop trying to wriggle out of this,” John said, glaring at him from over the rim of his teacup. He set the cup down on the porcelain plate, licking his lips. Sherlock was suddenly hypnotised. “Plus, I was thinking we could go have hot chocolate at that cozy place across the street from the mall.”
Greg’s brows furrowed alike. He blinked and looked at an unspecified place in the office, muttering as if to remind himself something important, “Of
“Well,” Will considered, head tipping to the side as he drew the word out. “I do miss the TV. It’s been a while since I watched a show or a movie myself and didn’t rely on my
Irene got up and tugged at the sleeve of Cas’ blue shirt to follow her. “We’re going to have fun, Angel! Let’s go, I’ll show you how to throw stones.”
“I can’t believe I missed out on time travellers,” John said wistfully. He was lying on the carpet covered floor, staring at the ceiling.
was he?
However, Sam stumbled upon an article from 1902 that claimed that a certain figure going by the name ‘The Doctor’ stopped by a few decades before that year, and they were remembering the day. He showed it to Sherlock who mumbled and tucked it into his pocket for later reference. Another article that had been transferred there from a local library listed a number of native people’s names that were willing to participate in history research detailing their culture. Sam thought it would be wise to track their descendants to see if the offer was still up. It came to light that the natives hundreds of years ago used caves as ritual places among other alternatives -- could that mean the caves were closed due to other reasons than just the plain threat of rocks falling on their heads? After all, some cases took them to monsters’ lairs or witches’ dens and each place had their significance. Sam made sure to note everything in his phone app and moved on.
“You are when you sleep,” John laughed, tapping on his phone and then pointing at the canvas. “I’ve got evidence.”
And if she wanted to get back together? Well, in that case, too bad. John’s interest currently held a gorgeous Brit sitting next to him. Speaking of which, said Brit unbuckled his seat belt, arm brushing against John’s as he opened the door on his side and got out to stretch his legs. John shuffled out right after, Irene poking him to be faster. People gathered in a long line on the other side of the street, waiting to get inside the giant ominous tent looming over them.
Kate and Irene looked at each other. The question of Mary and the secret club that bothered Greg was a matter of its own. With a mutual nod, they set to tell Jake, Will, Pocahontas, and Hulk, who joined their group in the meantime, what happened and how they found themselves in Mary’s house, the strange calls, and the second mystery journal.
CAS! SAM! Who let the dogs out?
“Enjoy, lovelies!” he said, putting the plated meals in front of the hungry kids and Mrs Hudson.
Timeline: 1994
“We were classmates through elementary and high school,” Mike explained, the tips of his ears going pink as he smiled at his sandal clad feet. “We’ve been friends for what, fifteen years?”
“I think it’s just the fact that he forgot Mrs Hudson’s tools in the forest,” Greg huffed, offering John a sip from his soda. He accepted, swallowing a large gulp of the sugary liquid. He winced as the bubbles scratched his throat and roof of his mouth.
“I’m cleverer that him,” Sherlock said, pouting for sure. Mycroft took that as a cue to barge in without seeming like he listened all this time.
Silence. Greg’s bags under his brown eyes darkened as he tipped his chin forwards in acknowledgement. Mrs Hudson’s equipment shan’t be taken lightly. “I have work to do.”
“He sure did.”
“Don’t jinx it,” Sam said. “I want to go at least one day without ruining my shirts.”
Red flames, sparks, the instant smell of burnt parchment, deafening silence. Dumbledore’s long fingers turned the tiny piece of smoking paper round for him to be able to read the name.
“You guys! You won’t believe what I found instead of cucumbers! Pistachio, stracciatella, and cookies ice cream!” Irene pronounced victoriously, holding up the paper containers for them to see. Sherlock sighed in relief and reached for the pistachio treat, taking a teaspoon from his step-sister which she held between her fingers as though she cosplayed Wolverine. Thankfully, she didn’t seem to pick up on the tension she barged into, giving the second teaspoon and cookies ice cream to John and keeping what was left.
“Don’t forget to take Mrs Hudson dance on her ex-husband’s grave,” John added cheerfully.
Now that she was out once again, done with describing a fairytale story she came up with to test how much bullshit the tourists believed, she asked Mrs Hudson how much money they made.
Greg rubbed at his eyes using the knuckles of his fingers.
A rapt knock on John’s door roused him from his semi-sleep, dreamy state. John rolled out of his bed, feet tumbling against the carpet, which softened his fall. He shuffled to the door on his knees, half-blind, his vision blurry. As he got a hold of the handle, the knock repeated.
“How can you just
Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a very nice day/night wherever you are~
Hm. This would explain Karkaroff having Krum close to him these past few days, certainly telling him about certain spells that Draco had overheard in passing. Maybe if he managed to gather more information, he could pass it to Blake too. That’d earn him his trust, foregoing his plan. Good, good, that sounded plausible. It’s important to get him to trust Draco, and then he can inquire about Potter. Blake was awfully gullible, and Potter seems to be softening up to him.
Greg’s little heartfelt rant was interrupted by John ramming into him in full force as he locked him in a bear hug, face burrowed in the crumpled fabric on Greg’s shoulder. Large hands closed over him, hugging him back accompanied by small rocking motions from side to side to soothe his nephew. John didn’t cry, but he was damn close to it. He sniffed into Greg’s shoulder, and his uncle rested his cheek against his blond hair. Their hugging position was a little awkward, but neither man cared.
Sherlock replied by saying that it all comes down to the temperament of the dog, its breed, its eyes, and overall other details he and Mycroft considered when they got Redbeard. Towards the end of his rant, however, he gave a few suggestions, none of which were exactly dog-like. John didn’t mind.
“He completely blacked out,” Dean snickered as he poked Cas in the ribs. The angel hasn’t stirred once. Sam pitied him; who knew what Dean will do to him in his incapacitated state? “Sam, help me haul him upstairs.”
"I'm not aware of any. Yet," said the Prefect, a smile curling up his lips. "I apologise for the timing, I usually try to avoid such meetings during breaks, but I've been putting this meeting off for longer than I'd like."
She went on a rant about ye olde world and how people fought like dogs to have a bite, something Dean could sympathise with. There were times when, as a kid or a teen, he starved for days or ate just the minimum amount to ensure Sam had enough to eat. Their dad was busy with hunts and the whole credit card scam thing wasn’t perfected yet, so hunting for both monsters and groceries was hard. And Sam always needed it more. Dean was pretty sure half of his growth-spurt could be attributed to him. Not that he was bitter. After all, he was the prettier brother.
“Unlikely.”
“With Sam, she’s fine. They’ve even got Gerta up there. She’s got there through the window.”
“It’s very good,” Sherlock said, cringing at the way how lamely it sounded. “No, it’s… amazing, brilliant, even. No one ever painted me. I’m flattered, John, really.”
“God damnit, can you stop?” he pried Cas’ finger from the radio, watching the road so as not to miss the next turn.
“Actually, I will need the journal in like a week or two.”
“I wonder how that guy in Minnesota is doing,” Sam mused, finger tapping his chin. Sherlock’s list of questions expanded.
“It’s necessary for the greater knowledge,” Sherlock argued, crossing his arms. “We want to know where the Chamber of Secrets is.”
“What thing?”
“I am to check whether you… What are you doing?” he asked, perplexed by Sherlock’s hunched over figure. Sherlock must’ve looked like an overgrown doxy. Minus the wings and fangs and… body structure.
“They’re cute,” John said, recalling the day he bought them. It was in Toronto, back in January. At least they were of use now instead of sitting in his drawer. “And yes, the rose is nice. Although we could’ve gone without the fuss of you almost falling on your head.”
“Glad to hear that. You sure you’ve got everything?”
She asked about what happened after he was sent to a room off-sight from the Great Hall. Blake retold them everything; how the other Headmasters reacted to having two Hogwarts champions, how that Karkaroff guy seemed especially displeased, and how Dumbledore believed that Harry was innocent in this. A point he and Cho shared, though Cedric seemed to be fifty-fifty about it.
“Sherlock’s right,” Greg joined in, nodding fervently in agreement. “You cannot possibly ruin our experience with muggle food when we haven’t even tried it!”
Irene and Kate stared at the green succulent in horror, awe-struck, and unable to process what had just happened. They looked at each other, both shorter than a regular sized pinky finger. Kate tugged at her braids in distress.
The smelly door opened and out stepped the man in a smart suit, gasping for air. “Exactyl.”
“Believe me, this is the tip of the iceberg.”
Sherlock texted Irene something along the lines of ‘
Cas was satisfied with the choice of clothing John and Sherlock presented him with, but he omitted most of the jeans and agreed to take only the pitch black pair. After that he picked up a couple pairs of black or grey underwear, neither John nor Sherlock wanted to necessarily interfere with that. However, once Cas started browsing through the socks collection, John joined him.
John was apparently still asleep, so Sherlock kept quiet until Mrs Hudson turned around from the stovetop and wished him good morning. John jolted up at the sudden noise, rubbing his eyes and muttering a dreamy greeting.
“Alright,” both girls said at the same time after evaluating their options. If Mary mixed up with the wrong people and was out for Irene’s blood, then they could use all the help available. “We should arrange meetings too.”
John nodded and unlocked his phone as Sherlock closed the attic door behind him. “Let’s call the Winchesters, then. Come sit down, Cas.”
“And if we account for the wind speed and Donna drinks cotton candy….”
Dean shook his head, a small rain of red glistening particles falling from his hair. Irene danced under it like her life depended on it. Sherlock let out a sigh, then went to pick her up. His sister didn’t miss the opportunity to smother the red dust on his cheeks. He was not amused.
“I’m nothing if not a woman of my word, little bugger,” Irene told him affectionately, hugging him softly in return. “I will watch your performances in due time, don’t worry. Keep practicing until then, okay?”
Once the man was gone, Sherlock let out a breath he didn’t know he was even holding. Wow, faking a whole American accent sure took his charade to a whole new level. But, turning his attention back to the big and small dog curled up against him (Grace shuffled closer to him while the man from Animal Control talked to Sherlock, probably sensing
“Well…. There’s the fact that he kissed my temple when I said something that helped him solve the case,” John admitted, startling slightly when Irene released an inhuman screech cooing over the priceless information.
Everything was not fine.
“Janine. She always sent Jim messages via her cat. Last year it got a bit better, but it’s like she thinks of Jim as a traitor of the family for being in Gryffindor or something. She once sent him a really passive aggressive note, she signed it with a heart. Kinda creepy.”
“Actually, if you angle me to the window, it connects me to any reflective surface near you and I can follow you,” his mirror self said, proud of his abilities. Upon seeing Sherlock’s concerned and suspicious frown, it added, “No, not like that. I’m confined to this side of the world! Yay for you! Besides, I can’t speak if I’m a reflection of a reflection, if you get me. Heh. I’ll just make faces at you if you need to do something or not. You want your date to end well, and I want to help.”
Sherlock snorted, head ducked, his curls covering the front of his face. Snape didn’t notice, miraculously, and John sighed in relief. He was a tad intimidating, if he were to be honest. Someone in the back row was muttering under their breath, this time catching the professor’s undenying attention.
She pointed at the doors connecting the house and the gift shop, and lo and behold - a wild Lestrade appeared. He sneezed and yawned, his business suit he liked to wear a crumpled mess. He hadn’t slept much, Sherlock noticed.
Sherlock nodded mutely and followed John outside. John grabbed his yellow hoodie from where it hung on the rack by the front door; something told him it could come in handy. He led the way to the front yard and on the road that connected to Main Street. It was a narrow walk, spaced out lamps illuminating the deserted path. Music pounded inside as the remnants of the party celebrated, but John and Sherlock ignored it and moved on.
Harry bit his lip, his mind suddenly racing furiously as what to do next. He looked around the street around again, his paranoia meter rising with every second. He knocked on the huge door as loud as he dared and waited.
and the deer - who, in the meantime creeped closer to Sherlock in order to properly sniff him - lifted his head to look at the not-so-formally-clothed Canadian Mystery Man™..
The near-constant buzz of mosquitos annoyed the ever-loving shit out of Irene and John. They set out on their quest immediately, John borrowing Mrs Hudson’s car (after politely asking for permission, of course) to drive them to the north of the spread-out pine forest. After a twenty-minute drive, John parked the vehicle on an offside road so as not to clutter the already too narrow main, dusty passage. The two of them followed the small scribble of a map on the journal’s page, having to go off the tourist pathway, which made John uneasy.
“Calm down, John,” Wilkes said, huffing out a fake laugh. He was getting squirmy and uncomfortable. Good. Prick deserved as much. “But really, don’t you see how weird he is? Standoffish posh guy from Britain, nothing else --”
“Alright,” he said, biting on the last piece of his donut. “Fine, let’s get your
let's see what Cage will do this time, shall we?
He gripped the angel blade, ready to strike Cage down, but Cas miscalculated and missed by an inch.
“Oh dear,” Mrs Hudson gasped, horrified by young people’s diet in this century. “Is he alright now?”
I hate you.
, I have been honing my skills. And you know that.”
,” Greg said. Irene heard the delightful tone of his voice bordering on a savage chuckle. She and Kate exchanged a curious glance. The sound of doors shutting closed reached them, Greg’s voice becoming higher and then distant as he circled his car. “You think I wouldn’t recognise you?”
Dean sighed. “If I didn’t trust my instincts I would say you’re trying to set me up. Such is the price for doing this job right.”
“Oh dear, look at that fountain! It looks like an otter! Isn’t it adorable, John?” Mrs Hudson started succumbing to the delirium of a woman in her fifties who fell in love with shoddy goods at an Oregon home depot that wasn’t even a home depot but a shitty chain of unrelated bullshit: not good.
“You’re a fallen angel?”
Sherlock shook his curly head. “No, don’t worry about it. I don’t use the account as much as I could, at least Mummy will be happy I’m ‘treating myself’ or that I helped a friend in need.”
. His ribs were still a bit tender from that Gloria Scott escapade from two days ago. He got kicked square in his diaphragm and gasped for breath.
John decided to jump in and put on his nephew charms. “Can we keep them?”
“Ooh!”
He shook his head. “I’ll stay. I haven’t had coffee yet.”
“I think it’s mutual for all of us.”
"Yes, and you're repeating yourself too," Sherlock said. He turned a page in his Charms book, his black curls falling over his eyes.
That was both a relief and even more frustrating.
“I’m up for those promised cuddles. But we’ll need food soon.”
resumed. Yeah, it totally was due to him being a shipper…
John fell asleep with a satisfied smile on his face that night.
Take care,
Sherlock massaged his temple. He needed John here. “Besides, there’s a flaw. Horses can kick straight ahead, or behind them. Since you kicked diagonally and up, that doesn’t count as a horse kick.”
“Uhm… I don’t know?”
latest episode.”
Sherlock ignored her and focused on the phone at hand. John peered over his shoulder. He typed in Irene’s birthday. The pin or password consisted of four digits or four letters. Denied. He typed in her father’s birth date. Denied. He tried Mummy’s. No luck. The phone gave him a cooldown of five minutes.
“That’s impossible,” a kid maybe of twelve years of age snorted. Lil’ punk. “You’re just a scammer. It’s stupid.”
“Probably more relaxed than you,” she said sadly. “I haven’t much time.”
“That’s the vampire lair,” Irene commented, unamused. She rubbed her temple, catching Sherlock’s eye in the reflection.
The doors opened once more, Mrs Hudson’s friendly voice greeting them. “John! There you are. Did Irene tell you when she’s coming back?”
“‘Be rational’, pfft. Sherlock, this is our first summer properly away from home, from London. Open your eyes, this is our chance to have an epic summer romance!”
His eyelids fell heavy and shut, head tipping backwards and dipping in the cushioned backrest. God fucking damnit. He wasn’t getting any younger for this worldwide bullshit of a higher plan or whatever the fuck the bitches ‘up there’ believed.
body! Next time I won’t be indisposed by… by
“I had a plan in mind.”
“Jesus, did it just reference a Vine?”
The staring contest between the two of them was unbearable, but John couldn’t pry his own eyes away from them. He didn’t understand why Sherlock was making such a fuss out of singing -- it’s fun! But his recent experience with Mary and how she put him on the spot made him sympathise. He better diffuse the situation before it gets out of hand.
Sherlock’s mouth twitched in a hint of a smile. “And what did you imagine? Mycroft and I played pirates and Irene used to be the Queen of England -- still is -- but you can share. No, wait -- I’ll deduce.”
John shook his head and offered Sherlock a hand, which he declined by muttering "I'm fine" and off he went into the Potions classroom, his lip bloody.
"Gillyweed," said Mike, stopping in front of a painting. To John's surprise, it opened! "The Fat Lady will let you in once you tell her the password. It changes every week, so please make my life easier and pay attention when we change it, okay? This here is our study room, you'll spend a lot of time here. First Year boys after me, I'll show you where you sleep."
Some of Draco’s classmates looked at him expectantly, but he remained watching Selcout closely. So he didn’t think that Potter could’ve gotten in because he likes the fame? That’s alright, he’s new. He’ll see it sooner or later.
Not that there was anything he could do about it. He wished he could. But people were dumb enough to strike deals, or they were in desperate need of help and they had no idea what they were getting into. And they gruesomely paid for it later. This seemed like a good indicator of how much time they had left, though, and the confused comments confirmed Greg’s suspicion. It was a good concept, but creepy and entirely unhelpful. This Crowley had a knack for pulling people’s legs and a twisted sense of humour. And Greg kind of liked it. What? His stifled nihilism had to come through somehow.
“Please. And grab more miniscule umbrellas.”
’ ended - kind of thematic, though John could only wish to deal with his true romantic turmoil, not a sour has-been relationship - they found themselves in front of the local diner: Angelo’s. John loved this place; an Italian-American man - Angelo - owned it, and he and his staff (him and his three waiters working shifts) served the most delicious food in Reichenbach Falls. Speedy used to be right behind Angelo’s, but ever since they expanded from a simple coffee shop to a restaurant, they fell behind on quality. But at least they kept the original coffee shop - John sometimes bought Greg cappuccinos there. Those never failed.
“There you are!” she said, spotting Sherlock in her mirror’s reflection. She put her brush back in the bedside drawer. “Can you braid my hair?”
“Has he built this house?”
The curse (or rather, The Thing, as he decided to call it) was another matter. He had little to no leads as to where it came from. The effects are relatively harmless if he were to be a fool to say so. Unfortunately, it created a myriad of worries and confusion that he couldn’t decipher in spite of his and Anthea’s best efforts. He’ll wait for a short while longer to see if it will sort itself out, but if he doesn’t see any improvement by the twenty-second of August, he’ll have to relent to desperate measures….
“I’m thinking the same,” Sherlock agreed, smiling shyly as John pressed a light kiss on his nose. “Does this mean we’re….” He trailed off, hissing in annoyance as skittishness overcame him.
“I will be, don’t worry,” Greg had reassured him, crouching in front of him. “Hey, how about we go watch a movie and then read from that encyclopedia of yours you brought with you?”
His heart and stomach did a small flip when he saw the shiny black doors of 221b Baker Street. Still under the Cloak, he waited until there were no muggles in sight or anyone on the outlook of the street. Taking a deep breath, he pulled the doorknob. Locked.
“My people skills are actually a bit rusty,” Cas admitted, scratching the nape of his neck.
He let the visitor in and untied a short note from its leg.
He smiled and helped himself to a handful of her pancakes. They tasted delicious, mainly when topped off with butter and a chocolate spread. John absentmindedly drowned his plate in maple syrup and swallowed his pancakes in giant chunks, then plated three more. He practically licked it clean, and Mrs Hudson was satisfied, though she impaled Sherlock with a look saying,
“I didn’t mean it literally, but fine. How did you get in there again?”
Sherlock and John exchanged a quiet look and John gave a shrug.
“I’ll go check up on Sherlock,” John said, standing up. “And see if Greg’s here. Gotta tell him a friend’s staying with us for a couple of days.”
But before he could fully descend into panic mode, Sherlock tapped on his cauldron with his wand and it disappeared and he poured half of his solution into John's cauldron. Both of them were praised by the Professor, though he was surprised there was so little of it.
Thnaks you all for reading and I wish you all a very nice day/night wherever you are~
and retreated upstairs. He didn’t go to the museum, though. He racked his brain and Mind Palace about it first. Surely John wouldn’t mind getting lost somewhere else, would he? After all, it was their date -- and Sherlock had had enough of interruptions and noise for the day.
Speaking of which, he’s still unsure of what to make out of Castiel. They met at dinner, and the guy is friendly enough. A bit odd, otherworldly even, and that ticked off all the wrong buttons for Greg. He picked at his dinner, as if he wasn’t hungry, he had a tiny twig in his hair and a leaf behind his ear that John had noticed and plucked it from him, thinking Greg didn’t see, and Sherlock was the lead conversationalist at the table tonight, especially when they overheard Cas mutter something about molecules -- that’s when Sherlock started firing off his knowledge about chemicals, elements, and the periodic table, trying all his might to get Greg interested in a debate with him. This boy hasn’t uttered a word until then unless necessary, and Greg worried the kids might have a fever. Or was it him? Maybe he caught something from the Californian tourists that day. Bloody hell.
Irene pouted her lips, but John’s stare, soft and yet demanding, told her that he would not back out or yield. True, she did say she only wanted to feel what being a tall person obtained, but… the temptation outweighed her sincerity. However, John’s stance remained unfaltering, unwavering, and that made her feel smaller than she was in reality. Strange how human behaviour worked on the psychology of an individual.
"Go on, he just didn't get a lot of sleep," John said, smiling.
“Not in the slightest! Christ, I hated some of them. They ask stupid questions like ‘Why is this painting of ‘Terrible Creatures’ just a mirror?’ and ‘I’ve seen better at Madame Tossaud’s!’ and such bullshit. Well, why don’t they go there, then? And all the while you have to keep up with them, create lies and hypnotise them to believe you
Irene padded upstairs and went to check her phone for notifications: nothing. Cool, all was chill. Oh, actually her phone just had no signal. Buggy Oregon. Whatever, she got used to social media detox every summer during scout camps. The Mystery Shack had nothing on her.
“Don’t be silly, Sherlock,” she chastised him. Her eyes flitted between him, Irene, and then John. “As per our agreement, he’s in the dark.”
“What do you mean?”
A knock on the front door intruded their afternoon domesticity. Redbeard made a run for it before either of them had a chance to react, and Grace followed her puppy, a low ‘woof’ serving as an interrogative ‘Who’s there?’ to the newcomers.
Fuck, okay. He was getting
“Hi, having fun?” Irene asked cheerfully, hands clasped behind her back. Janine’s friend shut up as she approached, looked her up head to toes. They were a little speechless at the sight of her black Homestuck t-shirt.
“I’m honoured,” Irene smiled into his hair and pulled away. “That enough?”
“Nothing bad. He hasn’t committed any crimes as far as I’m concerned. He’s not a troublemaker, is he?”
much. “Suit yourself.”
“You’re welcome!”
enjoy!
“Bumblebee?”
“Oh, you’re back!” Irene said, turning the tablet off and standing up. She snatched the bag with Castiel’s clothes from him and laid them out piece by piece on his bed. He sighed and sat down next to Kate while Cas stayed hovering nearby. John opened the window. “So Cas has the church attire vibe deep rooted, huh. Not bad. Sherlock, you picked the shirts?”
But… is it right to leave his parents like this? It’d be different under the condition that they had an argument -- that would leave him the rightful option to evacuate that house in Canada basically immediately and with no initial regrets.
“We can talk about the Colour Wheel,” Sherlock reminded him, holding the journal up. Irene pointed her blue painted finger in his general direction.
John laughed in earnest and kissed Sherlock’s jaw. Sherlock in turn planted a kiss on John’s forehead. “Prick. Try sitting out morning trains. Actually, that’s impossible, because they’re fucking stuffed with people. I hated it. I still do.”
“Nothing bad,” John said, swallowing hard. Why was he so weirdly emotionally constipated when it came to talking about
My humble tumblr:
“What’s going on?” John asked, something about his calm demeanor converting Wilkes’ gaze to himself. The sweaty guy backed off, nostrils flaring. Sherlock shrugged, taking in the almost comical sight of John wearing Mrs Hudson’s knitted bag over his shoulder for easier handling. He looked as threatening as ever, a quiet challenge written in his posture.
"Hey, you still did great," John patted him on the back, chuckling.
Cas winced at the assault of wet soil thrown in his face (
“Yeah, I bet if we put up a light show, we could have an unlimited disco party in here,” Irene said, crouching to get a better look at a tiny turquoise crystal at her feet. It was deep-rooted in the ground, resistant to her pull. No way she’d be able to haul it out.
“Is this your military kink speaking too?” John teased, thinking about the rank of captain and its relativity.
Cas gave him a nod, waving goodbye to Grace, then turning to the staircase as he awaited Dean’s descent. John entwined his and Sherlock’s arms together, leading them to Greg’s spacious car where Irene and Sam already sat in the back discussing hunter fashion. She was not happy with what she was hearing.
,” he clipped, exhaling sharply in exasperation.
Special thanks do Bee and Dee, the latter being my test subject for reactions for Nicolas Cage - Dee can tell ya how nightmarish she feels about Cage thanks to me :DD
Kate’s eyes widened, her neck craning away from Irene, but she nodded. “But how?”
In all honesty, Greg had no desire to leave the Shack. Not with the M Club doing fuck knows what in the town. Thankfully the deed was safely locked away in a safe in an undisclosed location in the house, should they get ideas to get to him… But then John hit him with the family talk and really, they’re each other’s sole family now, what can Greg say to that? And John’s right, he should take better care of himself, but… He’s just so tired. There are days where, even if he does get a handful of sleep, it slows him down, an invisible weight settles upon him, making it impossible to move elsewhere for hours, if there aren’t other obligations to take care of.
“What is this?” Irene murmured, keeping close to John. “I’m getting the heebie jeebies.”
“Looks good so far,” Greg said, leaning next to her. Irene jumped at the sudden intrusion, but smiled. The room started filling with people. She saw Mike Stamford and Eddie Van Coon enter and dart to the buffet immediately.
“That’s Castiel, Cas for short.” The front door handle clicked loudly as someone walked in. Irene lowered her voice. “He’s our new friend, an angel, but more on that in the gift shop.”
“Why penguins?”
Greg cursed under his breath. There
After closing the suitcase for good that day, he rambled through his desk for anything essential he may put in a duffle bag that he’ll keep on him during the train ride. He thought about taking a fantasy book he’d borrowed from his mom, but he didn’t want to send it home by owl, it was too precious for a delivery like that. No, that stayed home. He’ll read it over Christmas. He opened a small shelf atop his desk and immediately a bunch of rolled up parchments fell out.
“Isn’t it obvious? He didn’t do it,” Sherlock said, tone of voice indicating they were being idiots. “I’ve never paid much attention to him, he seemed very uninteresting, oafish almost. Hm. It appears we will have to talk to him.”
made me
John read it again. Was he serious? Couldn't it wait until morning if he wanted help with an essay he procrastinated on? Honestly, Sherlock was brilliant and one of the smartest people in the room, usually - but he could be so lazy!
episode 15, chapter 1
, full grace means no necessary mortal needs, Dean laid off. He had a bad feeling about this. He was tremendously happy that his best friend was back, but a sixth sense was telling him that something big loomed in the dark of the subconscious. His skin crawled at the thought of it.
He’ll know the answer eventually.
“Question,” Sherlock said as the two of them ascended the stairs. John looked over his shoulder and kept walking. “How ‘fun’ is this family bonding time of yours, usually?”
Vivien hurried to explain the contrary. “
“So?”
Sherlock buried his face in his hands, long fingers caressing his temples, curls falling over his forehead. “Fine,” he said. “This worked better in Toronto.”
My official tumblr for this fic is: I am
“You have committed crimes against Reichenbach Falls!” she accused the doll in question, stripped of all her dignity by being dressed in clothes that lacked glitter. Cas learned that tiny Irene loved glitter on clothes. Doing this to the Barbie essentially meant she was professionally shunning her. “How do you plead?”
John pulled Sherlock into a promised kiss, lips parting and closing slowly, their chests pressing together to relish the physical closeness. A delightful squeal left Sherlock’s mouth when John nibbled at his lower lip, his grip on John’s waist tightening. John trailed kisses along the outline of Sherlock’s jaw and down his neck, thumb caressing his cheek.
“Too many details!” Greg said loudly, fake covering his ears. “I do
Kate waved a hand and excused herself to fish a packet of chocolate chip cookies from a cupboard. “I’m hungry. If I make a correct bet, you’ll pay me even more. So, what’s the deal?”
Are you kidding me?
“You can go, but I think I’ll opt for the fries over there.” He pointed at a neighbouring stall where the sound of oil frying thin, lengthwise-cut potatoes sizzled towards them.
“John! This is the most mesmerising thing I've ever had!” Sherlock exclaimed, squinting into his empty glass, all thoughts of Mycroft forgotten. Greg nodded, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Irene, are you okay?” Sam asked as Dean and Cas jogged up to them. Droplets of water trickled Irene’s skin, her hair was a mess, and her limbs were shaking uncontrollably.
“You’re less talkative than I expected. Tell me, what do you know about John? He’s our mutual interest. How was he as a child? Irredeemably cute, I bet. Baby fat got switched for muscles and sharper angles, but his are fuller than mine. John’s handsome, did you notice? And he’s my boyfriend. He likes me, can you believe that? Sometimes I still can’t. It’s like a fever dream I’m afraid I’ll wake up from and all this won’t be possible. Or maybe I’ll get my memory wiped, who knows? That’d be tragic, wouldn’t it? Fall in love, then forget it, but still be in their vicinity? Cruel. But thankfully that’s not possible, so we’re safe.”
She peaked over her arm at Sherlock’s empty bed. Of course the git wouldn’t sleep in during summer holidays. Workaholic, that one. As if he didn’t spend enough sleepless nights on studying in Toronto. He needs a serious break.
He waved at the flabbergasted Sherlock and strode outside into the hot summer day. Beautiful. He offered the guy a seed of loathing, which, down the line, will prove to be even better when all hell breaks loose. And from Mary’s side, when she catches her sweet Golden Boy making out with this posh boy from London…
“Sorry,” she shook her head, trying to mask the amused grin that tugged at her mouth. “I saw the racoon chew at your permit, tearing it into pieces. Then it ran out from the side into the forest.”

“Wait until you taste Angelo’s apple pie,” Mrs Hudson told the siblings as they hurled outside on the pavement.
Inside was a hole big enough for a child to hide in (hopefully none did it and the lack of skeletons luckily supported the assumption) and there was a small device. Sherlock sneezed when the stale air hit his nose. He wiped his nose with the back of his hand and leaned in.
Irene laughed at the imagery. “Let’s hope not.”
“I spied in the Shack for weeks!”
Before the Doctor or Donna could reply, Irene beat them to it. “What? Sherlock, you did the math. In any other timeline, Molly gets asked out by Andrew West and Mike stays alone! We can’t mess this up when we achieved the best outcome for them!”
enjoy!
“Sure, old man.”
“No,” he said, his brain catching up to present. “Why does the gardener notify you every time there’s a new delivery?”
“A doctor, in case you ever have a flu,” John said and he also sat down in his armchair, throwing the pillows on the floor carelessly.
The witch rolled her eyes and said, “Of course. We just have to get in quietly.” She turned to the black door and tiptoed closer, taking out her wand. Before she chanted any spell, however, she tried to open it normally. Unlocked. Hermione looked at Harry and Ron and nodded. They waited until a pair of muggles strolled along and went it.
“Thanks.”
. Just make sure you take him apart properly, alright?”
As he walked out, he almost collided with Irene, who was holding a towel and clean clothes. What is it with these two and their tendency to crash into him?
and ngl I'm in a weird headspace recently?? I'm drafting future episodes because I need to prewrite a certain amount before my uni starts in spetember, but paired with my part time job and babysitting my sister, ugh, it's a lot, plus I promised myself to study chemistry for my forensics major and I didn't get to it yet :( I got so many things to do and so little timeeeee

Huh. The old mill occupied a secluded spot by the river, not much of a tourist attraction. But from an earlier debate that took place after midnight the other day, John knew Irene was once a scout and loved hiking. She’s probably getting some fresh air and exploring on her own. Not bad, the forest and the mill are not hidden and it’s easy to get back on track. If anything, she’ll call or send a text.
Into battle!
A groan. "You already know how. I observed. Funny. I wonder how it must be like in your little brains." Sherlock stared at him from across the table, the silver eyes analysing John with interest.
“To be fair, their journal is rather peculiar,” Cas added, nodding at the book. “I’ve read through it on Sherlock’s insistence. The author is unknown. I cannot recognise it and neither did I recognise some of the fauna and flora mentioned. What’s for sure is that at least three quarters of this town aren’t God’s creations. Or whatever he intended for them to be. It’s strange, the supernatural in Reichenbach Falls is almost harmless.”
“That’s fine!” Dean exclaimed, licking his lips as his eyes darted to the upper left corner of his vision, recalling memories. “Fuck knows how long we’ll be stuck here. The journal said it might throw us out on the same spot, so we got time to kill. I’ll tell you
“I didn’t say that. Yet. Alright, next: Irene, you will need to stall Mike and convince him to throw the ball above the stall.”
“You two talk like random NPCs in Skyrim,” John shook his head, listening to their monotonous exchange. It’s been a long time since he played the game. “When are we going?”
Mary’s posture stiffened.
“Alright,” Greg said eventually, lifting both eyebrows. “I’ll make it fifty too. Irene?”
John, an unsuspecting spectator of the threats passing back and forth so far, raised his eyebrows. “Can I have a go?” was the only thing he came up with for an answer.
“Looks can deceive.”
“Compared to the other angels, not as often as you’d expect,” Cas said after a while of silence. “In the modern human era I’ve been stationed here three times total, the most recent but aborted Apocalypse included.”
“You won’t have to any longer,” a male voice from the doll display said. “They’re standing right behind you.”
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise and rubbed his chin. He’s seen these before. Or did he? He had a feeling that something was eluding him, escaping his consciousness, and that a distant whisper was taunting him. He shook his head to snap out of it. It’s surely nothing; his mind is playing tricks on him because of the recent events. The rainbow colour scheme though… a rainbow appeared in his dream once, while he listened to
"Maybe we could get help from the inside," John suggested glancing at Sherlock. The detective shook his head.
“To the Tooth Fairy. Listen, she was very persuasive. And I got into trouble with her and her swarm of fairies. Iron didn’t work on them, so I had to improvise and I had your tooth on me…”
Next update to how John's unwilling dinner with Mary will arrive on the *looks at wrist where I have no watch* 30th November! Stay tuned~
Jake’s chin grazed Irene’s leg as it shifted. “No. I can be a quiet thief if I wish to. Not that I steal! But my paws are handy in such matters. As I eavesdropped, I heard Mary talking to herself. She does that a lot to release some of that anger. She was saying that she has to decipher something in her journal and that it might grant her a favour with someone named Magnussen. I gathered it’s her boss, and that she owes him for something related to John. She was pretty angry about it.”
“Unfortunately not,” the Doctor and Donna said in unison. They exchanged a look. The Doctor spoke up. “Your town’s bigger than I’ve anticipated. There’s more than meets the eye, and a large number of anomalies have formed in places that are intertwined on an energetic level. I can’t rule out any of them, at least not right now while the Rift is still harbouring power from multiple sources.”
Thank you all for reading and I wish you all a nice day/night wherever you are~
“I know, I know. Sorry,” Greg apologised, rubbing his face. Jesus fuck. Welp. There goes the Doll Conspiracy experiment. At least the Shack had one less burden now. “I’m glad you all managed to be safe. I myself didn’t know what to expect. I was ready to bust out my flamethrower.”
“What is this? Do I look like a pillow to you?” John laughed when Redbeard joined their nest on the blanket, clanking his teeth at Grace who rested her head on John’s stomach.
“You alright?” Greg appeared by his side, out of breath and sweaty. Sam himself was reeking. They were in need of a shower.
“That wicked witch of the East,” Blake muttered in disbelief as he read through a ‘report’ on the Triwizard Tournament published by Rita Skeeter. The Ministry owl delivered a print of the
Up in the attic, they discovered that Redbeard has tactfully invaded the space with his fluffy paws, spreading happiness and fur. Cas knelt on the carpet, Redbeard attacking his fingers, which the angel took gracefully and let the puppy play. Grace was likely in the living room. Sherlock noticed that she avoided stairs like the plague if she could help it.
“Fuck this day, honestly,” Lestrade swore under his breath. Sherlock saw the moment when he gave up on the world -- when he braced himself and stepped into the mud anyway to get inside. He could’ve used the passenger’s seat but apparently that required too much effort.
“Definitely.”
“Told you, I’m a peasant or a very poor knight. What does that make you?” John teased.
Hm. Maybe it really was about time he made the move. He had gotten an idea earlier. He sent a quick message to John on his phone to meet him on the back porch in five minutes. In the meantime, he’ll go and consult the mirror in order to rack up his confidence levels. Who else could persuade him to believe in himself if not ‘him’? He needed the reflection to flatter him. Selfish? Probably. But was it needed? Desperately.
“The squirrels never die,” Alex said, unperturbed by Irene’s mood. His mouth opened to say something else, maybe develop his idea further, but he was interrupted by Irene’s and John’s screams.
The golf cart tore through the sheet of the giant billboard overseeing a familiar road connecting to Reichenbach Falls’ Main Street, miraculously landing on the dust road off-side of the asphalt street to Sherlock’s, John’s, and Irene’s luck. Screaming, they swerved to the left, then to the right, and then, finally getting control over the whimsy vehicle, they drove over a bump sending them to hit their heads on the roof of the golf cart. Somewhere behind, the trees shook, some falling to the ground, others disintegrated into splinters by the sheer strength of their persecutor, malicious buzzing of something big echoing closer and closer.
also here is a quickly done meme by me, there'll be more of these coming your way:
“Yes,” she said, brows furrowing. They came to a halt near a crosswalk. “It must be here somewhere,” muttered Hermione and led the way to the other side of the street once the green light flashed and cars stopped to wait their turn.
“Yeah. Where were you?”
“Not that I don’t like cuddling you, but it’s getting warmer and I’m sweating bullets,” Sherlock said, shattering their bubble of comfort. John extricated himself from him and Sherlock cursed his stupidity. “No -- I didn’t mean I don’t want you here, just --”
in which there is a connection
Sam’s eyes fluttered open to squint at the newcomers. Cas and Dean loomed over him, both standing by either of his sides as he enjoyed a moment of peaceful rejuvenation. Not for any longer.
episode 14, chapter 1
“Good. I’ll leave you to your pups, then. Have a nice day, sir.”
“So much is obvious to you.”
“John, can I ask you something?” Irene’s voice lured him from his thoughts that were about to get darker.
and its contents spilled onto the floor. Some of Mary’s best dresses started shredding themselves as her heavy breathing subsided. The man on the other side of the call chuckled.
“Boyfriends?” John supplied. Sherlock’s nose wrinkled at the term, but he nodded. “Yeah, I suppose so, if that’s what you want to go by.”
To his upper left he trailed the trace of the infinity symbol -- or the number eight tumbled over. It looked peculiar, strangely fascinating. As though it was glowing brighter than the neighbouring constellations. A cloud overcame Cas’ mind then and he sat up, confused. When he looked back at the sky, the infinity constellation was still there, but less obvious among the rest, though a star inside one of the ovals shone bright, as if winking at him.
“Considering we’re about an inch tall, we have a ghoul Freddie Mercury for a friend, and Mary is a right bitch, I believe all that my fake elf eyes see.”
She growled again, turning to glare at the countertop. Cas saw a weird shadow flick over the wall but he registered that bats frequented these woods and as such some of them passed by the windows. When Grace charged at the kitchen counter, Cas stepped over the barrier to see what it was about. Only when he brushed a hand over her whitish coat did Grace calm. Castiel’s own senses were partially dull due to an unknown reason, which silently infuriated him, but was it really possible that she picked up on something unusual?
“It’s the thrill of the fight,” Mr Ripper said seriously. With each grading sentence, he got more frantic and agitated. “Risin’ up to the challenge of our rivals! And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night and I will be watching mine with the eye… of the tiger! Yeah!”
“Unlikely.”
John pulled Irene behind him again, positioning them so that he could sprint in whatever direction from which their threat came first. Hirsch’s grumbles grew more distressed, and then his limbs twitched, the chocolate confines breaking into pieces, falling off like shattered shards of glass into a tasteless heap on the grimy floor.
There was the arm rub again. “Hm, let’s see. You’re childhood best friends. Why didn’t Molly and Violet tag along with us the other day?”
Also, more pining. John can't find his urges much, hah. And Sherlock can't resist not getting seduced by a Canadian.
“Tell me the colour.”
“Let’s get to it, I think she’s onto us,” Dean said, picking up his pace. Gloria did notice them moving towards the water, and she didn’t miss the opportunity to raise a wave in an attempt to wash them off shore and drown them. He grabbed Sherlock’s arm, guiding him, keeping him steady, his other hand busy with cutting through the water as best it could.
“I thought you’re the genius here,” John said, the sofa cushions dipping under his person as he pressed deeper into them. “After that stunt with Nicolas Cage? If he let you, I’m sure you’d make the revelation clear.”
Oh, and how Sherlock
Greg pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering what path his life took to find himself in Oregon managing a scamfest of entertainment, countless feet underground, wrought out and tired. At least he wasn’t alone. John was still coming back, basically moved in already for some time, and he got Sherlock and Irene under his protective scrutiny. And they had Hudders and the lovely dogs too.
“It’s three twenty…. Let’s say in fifteen minutes.” Greg smelled his armpit and grimaced. “I need a shower. So three thirty-five we go.”
“Now’s later.”
want to move faster,” Sherlock signed, glaring. Walking was indeed harder than he’d anticipated. “And I want to walk.”
“Yes! Precisely. What’s more, certain anomalies keep resurfacing over the years.”
“Neither is James, he was unjustly imprisoned!”
Weeks passed and so did the weather. Last bits of summer were lost and changed by chilly wind and heavy rains, which made Flying lessons difficult and unbearable, but they made do. When fall transformed into winter, the castle was decorated beautifully by Professor Flitwick's charms and spells, which made the atmosphere quite lively and relaxed and helped soothe the uncomfortable news spread by the Daily Prophet about more and more incidents at the Ministry conducted by the Death Eaters.
As if
“We could meet up,” John suggested. He longed for a proper sleepover with his friends and this could be the perfect opportunity to lure Sherlock out and socialise for once. He saw the temptation in his features. “Sleepover at my house? My parents won’t mind, and we’re not going anywhere. Harry and I, at least.”
“Roger that, mate!” Kate shouted back, eeking as the ladder shivered under her weight. Sherlock was on his feet sooner than he registered, instinct giving way as he slid on his knees to where Kate was standing, securing the ladder in place. “Oof! That was close. Thanks, Sherlock!”
melting the cotton candy.”
’ startled them, the boys staggering backwards.
- you little - get off me!” She swatted one pixie away and slapped another into oblivion.
A tap on his shoulder startled him, his spine straightening. “What? Oh, it’s you Draco. Sorry, I got lost in my head.”
“Gloria was the only ghost documented in the journal. There are several techniques that describe how to get rid of a deceased soul, but I’d like to compare it with your practical knowledge.” Sherlock grabbed the journal and pen, sat back on the sofa and opened a blank page. “So tell me, Dean -- what’s the hunter’s way?”
“Why’d they abandon the building?” John asked, sitting down as well. Sherlock leaned on the backrest of another row.
Sherlock smugly took the stuffed dog from behind his back and handed it to his sister with utmost care. Irene squealed, as did Kate.
“Bones only, John. Let’s go check out the supposedly extinct terror birds. Please?”
You paid the neighbour to do it.
. Well, you did! So keep it. You made the party quite lovely for a while.”
“You never know,” Greg shrugged wearily, feeling a bit bugged by the freak comment. He understood that it pained Sally to be given even a shred of hope, but she should know how to handle this better, shouldn’t she? “He was trying to help, but… Look, he’s a good boy. Eccentric, sure as fuck, but he isn’t going out of his way to hurt people or cause mayhem on purpose.”
came on; a rerun. Irene and Kate leaned into each other, heads bumping lightly.
He pecked Sherlock on the cheek on his way out, shutting the door quietly behind him. Sherlock found himself smiling like a fool in the middle of John’s room. Every day he was falling over and over again for him. Mind absent, Sherlock gravitated towards John’s bookshelf above his desk. The Fablehaven series was sitting proudly on it, spines of the paperbacks bent from the fourteen times John had read them front to back. He grabbed the thinnest first book of the series, its cover green with a witch on the front smirking crookedly at the reader, and plopped on the bed.
“Welcome. How come you’re here this early?” John stood up to collect their plates and deposit them in the sink.
“Angelo has gone to Seattle.”
“I’m Sherlock Holmes and this is John Watson,” Sherlock introduced them, smiling down at John. “Irene is my crazy step-sister and Kate is our similarly crazy friend.”
It was John’s turn now to playfully tease Sherlock about whatever he left unsaid and hanging up above them. “Hey, if I had to come clear about your scented shampoo, then you should finish your sentence too.”
There was a perfect circle dissected in the middle by the journal. It’s outline was grey, and there were two inner sections that were coloured. The bigger outside circle was divided into six sections, each one consisting of one colour of the rainbow. The smaller second inner circle consisted of colours that were a mix of two primary colours that were next to each other. In each of the sections in both circles were symbols Sherlock couldn’t connect to anything he’d seen before. The purple section had the symbols of a pine tree in it, red had a rose, orange had a sun, yellow had a bee, green had a maple leaf, and blue next to purple had a crescent moon.
A grin split John’s lips as he put their food together, plating it up. “I have to agree. I think the weatherman was right. It is the hottest day of summer.”
"Her biscuits were delicious," Harry said truthfully. He would actually have another one… It held this familial taste he longed for from time to time, and Mrs. Hudson emitted this motherly attitude he grew up without.
Sherlock smirked. “Bring me a skull.”
“Jake rummaged through a dumpster the other day. He scavenges a lot some days. And… he brought this.”
“I thought angels didn’t exist,” Sherlock said, eyes scanning Castiel head to toe. “How can we believe your claim?”
“Oh, of course. But why did you need to steal our things, Jake?”
“Mr Shepherd?” John squeaked, desperately trying not to laugh. Sherlock pouted. “Hey, I’m not making fun of you. I think it’s
Greg swallowed the lump in his throat, fingers pinching the bridge of his nose. His nose wrinkled as he sniffed, willing the moisture prickling in his eyes to disappear. He can’t get sidetracked, not now. He’s close to his end goal, what good will it do if the seeds of doubt sow themselves in? He can’t allow that. It’s August. Just two more months. Greg can worry then.
Helga nodded as John rolled his eyes. “I am! We were made around the same time, Rowena and I.”
Word count: 2684
listening properly.”
“Well,” John began, looking at Sherlock for support. Sherlock hid behind Redbeard.
His mom gave him a warm smile, meanwhile his dad cleared his throat to get their attention.
Sherlock glanced at John who turned his palms upwards in a surrender, unable to speak. The shock was still strong, huh. “Right. So.” Sherlock grabbed his mystery journal, stepped on and over the coffee table and motioned for Cas and Dean to sit. They did and soon the two of them were squashed between two kids and a teen. John passed Irene to Cas, who passed her in Dean’s lap. Together they watched Sherlock list in the journal as though he were about to announce their paternity tests.
“Likewise, let’s go.”
Cas shrugged. “Do I look capable of looking at the price?”
“You’re kidding. Please tell me you’re Disney Channel cultured and that you watched High School Musical.”
Harry moved under the Invisibility Cloak a lot faster when there weren’t two other pairs of feet stumping on your own. He carefully avoided muggles in the streets. Two times he almost crashed into people, but he narrowly avoided the collision. He’d never seen London from such angles as he did these past few days.
“Did you?” Sherlock pursed his lips. His body vibrated with a playful energy he knew he will regret in a moment. John and Irene watched Cage too intensely to pick up on his intention to rile up the doll. “The Other Greg was the reason this museum was going to open, you know. If it weren’t for Mrs Hudson, you’d be locked up in the second floor room forever.”
The journal has been snatched from his grasp by an irritated Irene. “Now that’s out of the window, let’s get our nails painted before dinner, shall we? Cas, you can choose first.”
“Guys, you want some? I stocked up yesterday,” he said, looking from one to another.
“That’s nonsense,” Mrs Hudson sobbed. “None of you three did it. How could you even suggest that?”
“But --”
And then, the book closed itself on his hand and didn't let go.
“Don’t like her?” John quircocked ked an eyebrow, elbowing him in the ribs playfully.
“Dad couldn’t know there would be traffic, Harry,” John said, massaging his wrist. Harry had a pretty strong grip.
“Where Snape is stalking the shadows like a cat to catch thieves.”
“Are you sure?” Greg had said nonchalantly with a hint of teasing. “Sherlock apparently spends a lot of time in the library. Maybe you’ve seen him, you just didn’t realise. Wait, that’s not right. Sherlock is quite noticeable.”
He lifted his grey eyes at Mycroft, observing that he looked around somewhat… anxiously? As far as Sherlock knew, they were alone in the corridor, besides his nosy brother. It wasn’t because he was afraid someone else would catch them - after all, he had the most authority out of any student in Hogwarts as of present.
They stepped over the threshold of the cemetery. In fact, this was one of two in the town, this being a smaller lot, and older by a margin. Most of the first villagers and a few of the later generations were buried here. Huh, it fit that information about the founder would be here -- or contain more clues in the least.
John looked at Sherlock’s lips and then at his face, hopeful, happy, besotted.
“Wait, don’t panic,” Donna said, pointing at a clock on their right. “Look! The time’s moved back by half an hour!”
Satisfied that he gave a forewarning about his own preferences regarding sugary drinks and throwing semi-incorrect shade at the US, Sherlock returned his attention to the fries, building indeterminable structures using a few of them while munching on the rest of the horde in the meantime. He tuned out most of the ‘funfair’ that, in all brutal honesty, deserved to be incinerated, erased from memory of every civilian going there today, and perished from this town.
“I’ll do my best, ma’am.”
That’s rich. I don’t see your fellas around.
As Irene dug into her food once again, John and Sherlock strode in. Mrs Hudson greeted them, scoffing at Sherlock who faintly smelled of cigarette smoke. John scooted in next to Irene and Sherlock beside Mrs Hudson.
“How you call that atrocious dusty building home is beyond me. But yes, let’s,” Sherlock said.
What’s it to you? It’s none of your goddamned business.”
“For the aesthetic, John!” Sherlock said, smirking.
He has to gain new data.
“Greg? I’ve no idea, we can ask him. The house looks older than him.”
Shivers ran down his spine when he realised Snape was watching him intently, his head propped up on his hand. The professor settled behind his desk to tend to some paperwork, possibly grading essays already, but he stopped to see what he and Sherlock were doing. Evidently the eagerness with which the Ravenclaw boy moved about, carrying the ingredients caught his attention.
“I’d rather find out what makes
What Blake wasn’t prepared for were two things.
Sherlock decided to leave the journal at the Shack. There would be not much use of it tonight. And he almost memorised every page using his Mind Palace, and it’s not like he needed it urgently. The three of them sat in the backseats of Mrs Hudson’s red pickup truck, the step-siblings occupying the window seats, John in the middle.
The best thing was that Sherlock basically confirmed any and all of John’s small observations, and in the spur of the moment, right after Freddie scared the shit out of them by yelling, a kick from the universe made him finally ask Sherlock out. And he said yes!
“I thought we already established that,” Sherlock grumbled, returning to the journal. “But there are instructions on how to present yourself to her so she doesn’t become hostile right away.”
"You didn't even get inside the library," Sherlock continued as if he weren't interrupted at all. "You two left the Great Hall five minutes before us, and as quick as some people claim to be, it is impossible to get much done in such a short span of time. You backed out as we turned the corner, probably seeing someone else you wanted to avoid, so you ended up here. Judging by his reaction, it was his older sister from Slytherin who chose to ignore him after being sorted into Gryffindor, much different from the family tradition."
“No. I’m only being sensible. Right, Watson?” Rosie fixed her bright blue eyes to Sherlock’s, blinking twice, three times. Then she glanced at Santa Claus and his elves, and clung closer to his chest. Ha. Sherlock shot John a triumphant look.
“Oh, uhm,” Lestrade began, gulping and glancing around. “This used to be a part of the Museum. Until people found it creepy and all, sending me letters they thought they were cursed.” He ignored the wide-eyed stare from John, who then gave Sherlock a look saying ‘
“So, you first plug it in here,” he said, gesturing to an electricity plug. “And that means it’s on. You turn this thingy with the circle to the right and then you pop your two breads in. Then you pull this pad down and wait until it pops up on its own. That’s when you know it’s done. NO WE DO NOT STICK FORKS OR METALS INSIDE, SHERLOCK. NEITHER ANY PART OF YOUR BODY. NO. IT HURTS. IT’S HOT. SHERLOCK - I told you so. Git, show me your finger. Under cold water, here.”
Mary went on with her monologue. “What does she even think? That she can snatch
“Would you?”
Sherlock sorted out his settings from shuffle to the original order. They had about six more minutes to spare with the red lights on the Main Street, perfect for playing the first introductory song
“Gotcha!” John giggled, and Sherlock’s body spasmed at the unforeseen contact.
To John's utter surprise, the wall became transparent and revealed a hidden room behind the papery veil. Sherlock looked down at him, satisfied, and walked right in.
“We can take the place,” John said, nudging Sherlock with his elbow.
Also, johnlock. It's coming. Posh boy needs medical attention? Say no more and John is there like the speed of light ;) soft idiots be *soft*
“It’s about time I caught up, innit?”
Irene woke up at eight o’clock. For her standards, it was exceptionally early in the day. Sherlock kept dozing off in his bed, an arm thrown over his face to block out the intrusive daylight. She knew he stayed in John’s room until midnight, and that’s as much as she wanted to know. Keeping her mind blank in this department was of the utmost importance, fuck that she made up innuendos whenever she got the chance. The duality of a woman was hidden in her ability to switch up her game as it suits her.
Laughter escaped Irene’s mouth and she shook her head, looking up at Cas. “Angel, you’ve a lot to catch up on.”
“That should do it,” Mycroft smiled tightly, brown eyes focused on the Hufflepuff. “A word, Anderson. You too, John, if you please.”
The visit at the vet’s went smoothly. The veterinarian was a nice lady, and she greeted Greg in spite of not having booked a session. She had a slow day at the clinic, so it was no problem. She had admitted them the moment they arrived, and the examination took around fifteen minutes total. Mrs Hooper had found no microchips that branded the dogs, meaning that they could keep them. Mrs Hooper had then entered their information into her computer for data keeping and made sure the dogs got their vaccinations, meds, and booked a checkup in a few weeks to get another dose in their systems so that they can be healthy. Greg had sorted out the bills and bought dog food Mrs Hooper advised them to get -- two separate bags with high nutritive value for both the dogs. As they drove back to the Shack, Greg had made a quick detour to the mall to purchase collars for the dogs and other essential gear for them: toys, beds, bowls, snacks…. He came back carrying two full bags of this stuff, handing Redbeard a squeaky toy in the shape of a hot dog.

“And get their last rent.”
“As if that’s possible,” Sherlock huffed a laugh, his reflection smiling slyly as well. Something in the back of his mind warned him, but he ignored it. Better focus on John now. It was their date, and he kept overthinking things like an average idiot. Unacceptable.
“Yes,” Sherlock inhaled, keeping his voice low. Since John wouldn’t stay quiet until he got answers, best reply to him.
“Send him to my place,” Sherlock said, shrugging. “He knows where to go if you tell him. He’s always welcome to stay as long as needed.”
“Whoa, whoa, whoa - who?”
“And what exactly are we going to talk about with Miss Skeeter?” Blake asked, cocking an eyebrow. Something about the woman and how she looked at him rubbed him the wrong way.
Sherlock jolted awake, his brain catching up to the fact that his bus had arrived at the Mall. The doors started closing, and he found himself bolting for the sliver of open space as he hastily slithered out onto the pavement. He hadn’t even realised he had fallen asleep. What kind of dream even was that?
panicking!” Sherlock snapped, and he hated that he couldn’t pry John’s hand from his own. All this contact and being near him was
“So,” John said smugly when Irene and Sherlock began eating, “you mentioned you have an aunt living here? What’s her name?”
“Long legs are convenient, huh?” John teased, grinning even more when Sherlock rolled his eyes at him. He let Sherlock rush past him in mock annoyance, laughing warmly. “So, what’s the plan?”
episode 16, chapter 1
"I think he was travelling, can't say for sure," Greg said. "I've seen him with that kid, Moriarty, a lot,you know, at Hogwarts. Maybe he's with him somewhere."
“So…. What do you think? Sherlock?” John asked, hoping to get some understanding out of this. He watched Greg annihilate half of the pizza while Sherlock spoke.

“I dunno. Ever watched sunrise like this before?”
As surreptitiously as a girl might, Irene tumbled over to the gaping hole leading under the porch and slithered in in all her grace. She wiggled forward using her elbows and knees, same as when she took on an obstacle course during a scout camping trip several years ago. She found the entrance to Jake’s hideout quickly, and hopped in with practised ease.
“What case? Did someone ask you to find their pet again?”
“Well, it came true,” Mrs Hudson said, raising a skeptical eyebrow. She sat one seat over next to Sherlock, closest to the aisle. They were currently in a giant pink tent thematically lit up with fairy lights and John felt like he was at Professor Umbridge’s office, minus the cats, thankfully. That wouldn’t end well for the ducklings.
Wrinkles creased Cas’ forehead, lips pursed. Who would’ve thought that an angel of God looked like a man on the run? Where did they even stumble upon him? And was that a twig in his hair? What in the name of Lady Gaga….
“Define ‘sulking’,” Sherlock said, turning to face the narrow bus corridor. An over-indulgent passenger next to them spread himself over the seat, munching on doughnuts. And he wanted for Americans so badly to prove him wrong about the stereotypes.
“I’ve been calling you, asshole!” Dean said, bemused. Irene snickered. Cas shifted on the mattress. “Why didn’t you pick up?”
"Well, take it as an exotic experience from England," Cedric grinned. "It won't be that bad. Any idea what the first task is?"
The Winchesters winced at that. “Ouch,” Dean said eloquently. “I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I always got Sammy ice cream when we could and he was fine. Do you think she’ll be okay?”
"Yes, John?"
“Yeah, for a lesbian, she’s a bit too keen on mentioning dicks often,” John said, his chest shaking as he chuckled. He kissed Sherlock’s curls, relaxing further into the mattress.
Into battle!
’ accompanied by a drawing of a black silhouette that was shadowed by itself. The shadow below was all grey and black, but it had a pair of white dots instead of eyes, watching. Creepy but fascinating.
“Yes, sir,” Carl said, voice small.
I have a fanfiction (gravity falls sherlock au) in the making, and my friend
“Yes, I’m not completely incompetent, you know?” he laughed into his phone, yawning. “I’ll go to sleep too. Good night.” The line went dead, Mrs Hudson’s chuckle cutting off as they hung up.
Wheeeeeee, I swear I could write about the domestics all day. Honestly? I could write Order of the Phoenix sized books of these three guys, have them explore their opposite worlds and just enjoy themselves during their Hogwarts years (while they can, heh). So, more summer interludes like these are coming for sure in the future.
“Oh! Of course!” He scuttled over to the furthest corner and handed her the phone, unharmed and with no additional scratch luckily for him.
“Their mothers were likely even more hideous.”
“Try not to move,” she scolded him, holding his foot in place.
“Does anyone need anything from the shops?” John asked, smothering peanut butter on sandwich bread slices. “I’m taking Sherlock to the mall, he has a boxing session with Anthea. I can go shopping while I wait for him.”
Harry took a sharp breath. "He sold it. Or rather, he had it taken away from him as a sort of bribe. The locket is now in the hands of Dolores Umbridge. She works for the Ministry."
“Or the orphaned pixies,” Irene added distastefully.
Take care,
“They don’t sound like good company,” Dean nodded, scratching his chin. “One time a fairy smacked me in the face. It hurt, not gonna lie.” A moment of silence, and then he added, “And it had
Now they rode mostly in silence, neither of the miniature girls knowing what to do. The further they got from the Shack and the torch, the less hope they retained for finding a solution for their problem.
“That is perhaps the only thing we agree on. They’re despicable. Have I said ugly?”
“And that will prove that we have bigger problems to worry about regarding Reichenbach Falls’ politics than shitty Homestuck!” Irene clapped, her body wiggling on the chair she was occupying with excitement. The jelly worm pack crunched as she reached into it, tossing a sour tail in her mouth.
“Aw! So cute! Told you John’s cool. Congratulations!”
“Just askin, Professor.”
Cas looked remorseful. “Uhm… Irene wanted me to watch High School Musical with her.”
“Is it working?” John smiled, looking up into those bright azure and teal eyes. Sherlock sighed (dreamily?), blinking at the black heavens above.
. But he seemed to open up with John, which he supposed was good.

“Y’all, attention on me, please!” she shouted in the mic, deafening the mob. A few people covered their ears at the ambush. “Thanks! It is my
“Why, you’ve been here only an hour!”
Greg nodded, lost in his own head for a brief moment. He drank some more before sitting up straight, grabbing John lightly by the elbow. “John, I was thinking….” He stood up, circled round the desk and sat next to John. The plank creaked under their joint weight, but neither of them paid it attention. John met Greg’s gaze, the soft, concerned look in his eyes enough to make John anticipate what he would say.
“I can imagine. Hey, what was it that Irene said? That you want to be a consulting detective?”
“Yes,” Greg and Sherlock said in unison. Greg went first.
How we all be when Cas is introduced:
Sherlock halted on the first step, glancing over his bony shoulder, which looked stiff in this posture and a bit awkward. The crinkles around his eyes softened. “Sorry,” he sniffed. “Just tired. We’ll explain later.”
. Of all aviators it had to be pigeons! Seriously! The most hateful of birds, an absolutely useless subspecies of fat flying rats in feathery costumes. Really, John? But then again, it was no wonder that the dodo went extinct if it shared DNA and evolutionary steps with stupid hateful pigeons. At least they didn’t take him to the Shack.
“Let me see it, you dork,” he said, walking up to Sherlock, who sighed and let his head hang down, semi-dried puffy curls still sticking to the nape of his neck.
“I told you the slurpee was too big for her!” Sam said, swatting his brother on the arm. Dean looked lost.
idiots.”
Sherlock turned on his heels, but John tilted his head to the side and said, “Acacia leaves help the burns, change them every hour.” If his assumption that the injuries were mostly burns was right, this would help.
"Well, maybe you could've put it more nicely? Scratch that, you can't put that as anything to not sound offensive."
“Hey guys!” he said, a broom in one hand. He was a bit out of breath and looked at Sherlock, though he addressed both siblings. “I think you should look at something.”
His and Sherlock’s eyes met again, and John felt his insides melt. It felt so familiar and yet so distant. Strange, since they first met yesterday, but his gut feeling felt otherwise. Human psychology, huh.
Sherlock blinked as if to make sure he heard that correctly. “So you really are an angel?”
Fortunately, Greg’s car was blessed by a working AC. Soon after John placed dry towels on the front seats and barely avoided another seatbelt burn on his arm or stomach, Sherlock returned. “Irene has been successfully alerted. They’re interrogating Sam on vampires.”
“Wait.”
“That’s kinda cute,” Irene smiled into her phone, marking it all in the app, fingers flying across her screen. “A bit ambitious, but I wouldn’t call it impossible.”
“Most of your wounds closed up, and some don’t need bandaging anymore, but they scarred and will likely stay as scars now. You had them open for some time, and it’s a miracle you didn’t catch a deadly infection, though that might have been your magic amping you up trying to save you, or whatever residue of it that you possess. I can see it’s still tender, so you better not sleep on your back for a while yet. Can you sit up for me? Let’s see what you can do. I don’t know what cronies that idiot had, but if they show up unannounced, we’re going to have a problem, and I’d rather avoid that. We should move forward.”
“Now that’s just rude,” the racoon said with a faint hint of irritation and hurt in its voice. Irene took the cap off the freshener and aimed it at the animal. “No! Wait, please! I want to explain this to you!”
Mycroft rolled his eyes. Ah, there’s that Holmes-typical trait. “What I’m trying to say is,” he started, looking mildly uncomfortable considering his words, “that I appreciate your willingness to continue being Sherlock’s… friend, even though he may refuse to acknowledge it. But after all, he’s not the best when it comes to socialisation.”
