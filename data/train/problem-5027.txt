He presses a light kiss on Steve’s shoulder, already used to those times where Steve tenses up, clearly thinking his mind is somewhere else.
“Anyway, yeah, that’s it. I—that’s what I wanted to say.” He nods multiple times, a little more than frantically. “Thanks for listening.”
“You’re saying,” Steve started, trying to maintain what felt like a final grip on his own sanity. “That you came back from the
Steve can see that it catches Tony by surprise. A flush colors his cheeks, and Steve kind of wants to thank Stark, because he loves when that happens.
“Are you sure you’re gonna be able to fall asleep?” Steve asks, sounding genuinely concerned and a little… something else, that Tony is not quite sure what it is. “Want me to stay with you?”
Steve lets out a tentative smile, small but honest, and it’s hard, for Tony, to stop himself from finding out what it tastes like. “Tony—"
“Why wouldn’t I?” Tony asks, watching Steve’s vitals as if they haven’t stayed the same for the past hour.
“Want… Want you, Tony. Want to… feel you,” he manages, feeling pathetic for not being able to say it plainly. He knows he must sound old-fashioned, prudish, the opposite of the type of partners Tony must usually choose, who Steve bets can keep up with him.
Tony is still not looking at Steve, but he can feel the way Steve shivers, as if he’s suddenly cold. “I… I don’t get it,” he says, his voice weak. “Phone? And Bucky—Bucky wasn’t even around when…”
For a millisecond, Tony is certain that he somehow misunderstood every single one of Steve’s actions, from the kiss to the hand holding to the
“This,” Rogers says, solemn and certain as a priest asked about the Gods’ existences. “Will not happen.”
“So do you,” Steve counters, and, as soon as he says it, he finds it’s actually true, from the way Stark’s chest heaves up and down as breathes.
“Tony,” he starts, unsure of how to do this, before deciding to just go right to the point: “Today is not our anniversary.”
A high-pitched yap called his attention: The smaller dog was standing on its two back legs, tiny paws gesturing at Steve with enthusiasm.
“Yeah.” Tony knocked back the rest of his drink before repeating in a lower, slightly unhappy tone. “Yeah, we should do that. But really? You’re willing to stay, Steve?”
Blowing out a breath, Tony sat there and weighed his options. If he humored Rhodey, it would likely be embarrassing as hell, but…well, that would put an end to it all, wouldn’t it? The hopeless, wistful dreams he sometimes had about actually acquiring a mage’s license. Instead of working under someone else’s. Maybe that would be healthy for him. Tony was of the opinion it would hurt like hell.
The upstairs was living quarters. Living quarters in need of a broom, as whoever stayed here didn’t really clean up after themselves. Tony immediately headed to a side cabinet under a window, pouring himself a glass of some amber liquid before knocking that back and pouring himself a second. Rhodey budged him with a soft hip check to pour himself a glass even as he asked Steve, “Want one?”
With a deep breath, Tony started speaking. It wasn’t a language that Steve really understood, although it didn’t really sound like some archaic language. More that Tony was speaking in math formulas, and chemicals, and things of pure science. Which was odd, as he was most definitely working magic.
It seemed a bit more advanced here, or maybe it was the blend of magic and technology that made him think so. Brooks on Lynn, they leaned towards magic more than machines. Steve passed several trolleys, most of them powered by machine, as he could see the engines. And there were motorcars, rather large ones that could seat more than four people that caught his eye. They even had a few pay phones on the corners in enclosed boxes, which people could readily used. A wealthy country to afford that. Brooks on Lynn was so war torn at this point that having a city like this was only a dream. It made Steve wistful.
Tony sank into a chair near his, draining half his glass, then let his head rest in both hands. “Okay. Yeah, okay, I’m braced. Hit me, Rhodey.”
“I’ll still do that for you. Because I know this place means a lot to you, and it’s a good way for you to work. Hell, Pepper said she’d do it if you promised not to drive her insane. But Tony,” here Rhodey ducked sideways, trying to catch his eye, “I want you to try just one thing first.”
Rhodey startled as Tony stood, heading to a clear(ish) patch of floor. “Wait, now? You want to do it right now?”
It didn’t sit well with him, not knowing where he was. It was like an itch under the skin, needing to know the lay of the land. So he walked along the sidewalk, head turning as he took in his surroundings. A port city, it looked like, as the sea was right past the road. The wind was brisk, carrying the hint of salt and water. It reminded him a little of home, as Brooks on Lynn was also by the sea. Familiar, but jarring, as his city was packed in tight. Here, it was more spread out with space between buildings and gardens. Sometimes they were mini gardens, just boxes outside of windows, but gardens regardless. And it was warmer here. Back home was usually cool, especially this time of the season. They were heading into fall. But the air against his face made it feel more like the beginning of summer.
“Not a lot. We were too far removed from it to get much news. I know it was brutal, and you were overwhelmed in the beginning. No one was sure if you’d win.”
What followed was something of a fashion show. Henry got completely carried away and Tony frankly didn’t blame him. Or have any interest in stopping him, for that matter. Steve made anything look good and Tony frankly enjoyed the show.
“The fuck we know it! You haven’t tried! And I know that your magic sucks at anything dealing with creation—”
Tony’s head snapped around. A portly man was frantically waving over his head with one arm even as he ran toward them.
Tony’s head jerked around so he could stare up at him for a flat second. “Um. Sure. You really are not in a hurry to get back, huh. I mean, I’m glad, because less pressure for me but isn’t being here strange? I mean, staying with a strange man who babbles at you and doesn’t remember to feed you breakfast, that’s not something people generally sign up for?”
He opens his pants in one simple, sleek movement (Steve almost doesn’t hate the belt anymore), letting Steve see the tent of his underwear. Steve feels a possessive, irrational rush at the royal blue color, but his mind goes blank when Tony takes it off, revealing his thick, gorgeous cock. Steve’s mouth waters at the sight, and he’d be shocked with himself, he really would, if he weren’t too busy thinking
“Steve,” Tony whispers, in between kisses, when Steve starts fumbling with his belt. He tilts his head, so Steve ends up kissing the corner of his lips, which he doesn’t mind in the slightest, loving the thought of kissing Tony’s laugh lines. He keeps going, mouth enjoying the feel of Tony’s skin, descending slightly to his jaw. In the meantime, Tony’s belt grows from an inconvenience to downright evil, Steve’s hands frantic in their mission to take it off until Tony stills them. “Baby, what do you want?”
No, he’s looking at Steve. Sun burnt, happy Steve. Steve, in love. Steve, with Tony’s arm around his waist, body leaned towards him even if he’s looking at the camera. Steve who has a team, who has his best friend back. Steve who touches Tony all the time, closes his eyes to kiss Tony’s hand, asks Tony about his feelings and loves him without a care in the world.
, or at least not fireworks like the ones Steve knows. Maybe it’s magic – according to Thor, Loki was instrumental in the wedding’s planning.
He was once interrupted halfway through a telling of Red Riding Hood by a girl who asked him why his chest glowed. When he replied, the girl simply nodded, then said “I love you” and motioned for him to get on with the story. He wants Steve to have a taste of this unique mix of weirdness and cuteness.
“Oh, God, sorry,” Steve said, blinking raindrops away to try and get a look at the person. Then, a high-pitched yap startled him, and he knew who it was even before his eyes managed to focus on the man’s face. “You! You—were you following me?”
The man stopped right next to him. As the pedestrian light went green, neither of them moved, Steve feeling the weight of his gaze as he stared ahead.
“I’ll do it,” Tony says without thinking, but as soon as the words come out, he knows he wouldn’t have it any other way. “The nanites are already adapted to my physiology – I can tweak them so they won’t affect me. I’ll go in, wake Cap to reality, and then you turn everything off and bring us both back.” He doesn’t wait for Bruce answer, already on the way to his worktable. “Come on. From my estimates,” he starts picking up his tools, opening schematics on panels in front of him. “We can get this done by the morning.”
“Are you going to your floor?” Bruce asked, raising his head from his phone. “Tony said he’ll be coming home in a few minutes. He’s asking if you want dinner.”
“I should...” Steve stammers, still not knowing the proper way to end these encounters. “I need to go find Sam and Bucky.”
as Tony leans forward and presses inside, but it’s a fucking delicious burn, the feeling of being filled up by Tony, just Tony. Steve can’t help but squirm, his knees tapping Tony’s shoulders as he fights to sink more, to take Tony in fully.
“I don’t know what stories you have been hearing, father,” Tony sneers. Howard’s head feels hot, rage burning through the alcohol in his system. He leans forward, threatening, and everything in the world would be easier if Tony retreated, but he doesn’t. Of course he doesn’t. “But I’m not the one who wanders the corridors at night like a tavern’s ghost.”
The words startled Steve a bit, even though rationally, he knew it made sense. He had run into Stark in the hallway so many times – locked out, or too wasted to get himself inside his own apartment – and he couldn’t just
He stood up to grab some pillows to make a bed for himself on the couch. As he reached his closet, he heard Tony speaking, from the living room.
Steve cries himself to sleep that night, and Tony stays with him the entire time, trying to ease him from a pain he deserves.
was there. In my bedroom. I thought I was seeing things”--he grimaced--“but then I started to remember.”
The king-sized bed had caused a moment of silence as soon as they both took notice of it, Tony feeling his face go hot in a way that didn’t fit the planet’s icy temperature. Fortunately, though, the couch was there to save the day.
He gets a raised eyebrow in response. “Yes? Though, to tell you the truth, the entire process happened quite fast. One minute, I was at home, ready to step inside and have a bath,”—his eyes glance at Steve for a second, sharp and penetrating—“and in the next minute, I was at your… your lab, I assume?”
Tony distantly hears a sound he guesses must be Barnes’ laugh, but he couldn’t look away even if the man had a gun pointed to his head, because Steve’s hand slides down from Tony’s hair to take his wrist, and he lifts Tony’s hand to his face and presses a light kiss on his knuckles. Steve actually fucking closes his eyes to do it, as if it’s really important to feel Tony’s dry skin against his mouth, as if even the lightest brush is enough for him to want to dwell on it.
“Wow. That guy never tires of being useful, does he?” Tony crossed his arms and turned towards Steve, too winded to be able to read his expression. He felt pissed off at the world – at the Sovereign, at Quill, at Leader Homewrecker, at Steve, and even at himself for taking that damn bathroom break. He should never have let Steve’s side. Now… “So, what do you want to do?”
far,” Stark said, but his voice sounded distant, as if he was talking underwater. Steve’s blood was roaring on his ears at the revelation, and he could barely hear him. “You’re more like, I don’t know, a flashlight or something.”
So he avoids looking Tony’s way, keeping his expression under control. When he feels tempted to do otherwise, he thinks of Tony at that first wedding – how he looked dancing with Nat, so comfortable and happy. Tony deserves someone who can make him look like that, and Steve can’t.
“I rented a place nearby.” Steve’s mouth fell open in horror, and he took a step back. “No, wait, listen—”
The kids are sitting in a perfect circle, which is already a little odd – usually they form somewhat of an oval shape at best, given their propension to stand up at random times, switch places with their colleagues, or to simply lie on their backs on the floor. They’re also not saying anything, and, after a moment of consideration, Tony realizes most of them are not following the story – their faces have vacant stares, and they’re blatantly looking anywhere but at Steve, seemingly distracted by literally anything else in the room. Two of them are sneakily coloring.
“Just one?” Tony raises a single eyebrow, tilting his head back as he studies Steve as if he’s said something really intriguing. The white collar of his shirt contrasts with his tanned skin.
Guilt bubbled in Steve’s stomach. “It’s okay,” he said, because God knew he was being enough of a burden without anyone worrying about the effects of his newly re-acquired hideous posture. “You’ve both been working a lot.”
He wouldn’t say it out of pettiness. It was just—well, what seemed likely. Even right now, two years after their fight, while Steve and the other rogue avengers are in the middle of renegotiating the Accords with T’Challa’s help, Tony doesn’t think that would make a different between the two of them, when they were in the same room again.
Steve rolled his eyes, but followed him. He and T’Challa often took turns helping each other with the animals – T’Challa had a clear soft spot for cats and was able to spend hours talking and playing with them until they were happy. And Steve…
“Are you… me?” he asks, and Steve feels a little relieved, because even though FRIDAY’s lack of alarm was enough proof, he’s still thinking he must be a little crazy for instantly recognizing the man as Tony.
Steve turns. Tony immediately lets go off his wrist, as if he’s been burned. He stares at Steve with a pained expression, making a fist with his hand and pressing his knuckles to his mouth.
“Thank you,” Steve cuts him off, because he feels as if he should thank him, at least for trying. “But I don’t think it’d be a good idea, Tony. I’d only hurt someone’s feet, even if you managed to find me a partner.”
“I swear, I don’t know how you do it, man,” Sam whispers. He accepts the handkerchief Steve offers him, though, pressing it to his eyes. “I’d say you’re like a robot, but even the
“It’s, uh,” Tony says, his voice a little shaky. “It’s old. The. The scar tissue, I mean. It’s from the old one.”
However—he still feels the tingle of Steve’s beard against his skin. If he will wake Steve up, if he will tear this world apart, then he needs to at least bring himself to understand it.
Tony bit his lip, eyes roving over the fit body in front of him. “Steve, what he did…that wasn’t just to heal you. Your musculature is changed, enhanced to a staggering level. Your reflexes and nerves, too. He tapped into your healing ability as well, literally supercharged it. I bet it’s hard to truly injure you.”
“I’m Steve.” There was a slight professional tinge to Steve’s bearing and manner as if he’d introduced himself a thousand times and was used to it. He held out a hand which Henry took, the shake firm. “I’m visiting. I have a slight issue where I arrived without any packed bags, so I do actually need to buy a few things to tide me over.”
But if the magic council decided that he was no longer fit to be even a student mage, all of this would come to an end. Without a permit to work magic, he was done. He wouldn’t be able to operate a legal business.
Shaking that off, Tony admitted, “And we can’t stay bound like this for too much longer. The familiar-mage bond will start to settle in, and get really attached, and it’ll hurt to break it. I’d rather not go there.”
Tony had a unique brand of magic that could do the world an amazing amount of good, and that stupid magical council of his was trying to deny him a license? Just because he didn’t meet some arbitrary standard? The more Steve thought about it, the more his blood boiled.
Steve stared back at him, eyes locked as he tried to read this man. Tony couldn’t use a grimoire? But all mages used grimoires, it’s how they managed to use spells in quick succession. It must be hell to have to create a spell every single time. And three minutes? “If something attacked you, you couldn’t begin to protect yourself.”
There were times when Steve’s enhanced reflexes moved him before his mind really had time to think it through. As the whale once again tugged at the net, pulling the ship sharply towards her, Steve lunged forward and caught Tony before he could skitter too far. He clamped one hand around Tony’s waist, the other hand caught a rigging line and pulled them to a halt.
As Rhodey fetched chalk, Tony took a minute to shove some boxes aside. He had an influx of orders to deal with and seriously no time for this nonsense. He tried to hold onto that indignation instead of all the other emotions trying to batter at him.
“Right. So let’s get you at least a week’s worth of clothes to tide you over. Uh, Henry’s store, let’s start there. And if someone asks, you weren’t summoned, you’re just a friend of a friend that I’m showing around, okay?”
Midway through on the second, he flickered to life and found that Steve was watching him in amusement. He stared back, slurped another mouthful of his caffeine goodness. “I have an epic bedhead, don’t I?”
Rhodey seemed to think that Steve had been called for a reason. That Tony’s magic had brought him, specifically him. Steve was rather of the opinion to agree, for several reasons. One, magic didn’t do arbitrary things without a reason. Sometimes the caster didn’t give the right instructions, granted, and they got a strange result. But that didn’t mean magic did things willy-nilly. So if there was nothing wrong with the spell Tony cast, and he’d gotten Steve?
He looked around at his workshop and felt a pang. Even this had been something of a grace given to him. Tony’s mind liked mechanical things, and it especially liked dissecting spells, so he’d gained something of a reputation. It had led slowly into this business, where he could build things for other mages, or study a spell for them when it went wrong and point out the weakness. It had been a rather steady income. And fun, too.
“Oh,” Tony stupidly said. Then shook himself, because he was a fucking adult and could do better than that. “That’s really rotten. And a shame because you strike me as a nice guy, certainly you’re taking this all in stride better than I would have. Um, so second question, the shield you’re carrying?”
“About twenty minutes ago, they realized the problem!” Marsha answered, eyes intent on the water as she drove them past the other shipping vessels in the round harbor. “They were coming back in with a haul of fish, I think they assumed they had a mother catch!”
No one said anything for a long moment until the mage groaned aloud. “Fucking shit! How did I do that?!”
“Dishes done are dishes I don’t have to think about later,” Steve pointed out as if this was reasonable. “And while I do dishes, maybe you can find a comb?”
“I see. But if you only have thirty days, why spend time studying my summoning? Shouldn’t you immediately break our bond and try again? Or are you worried about what will come to you next?”
Rhodey handed him a short glass, and Steve took it with a nod of thanks. They all found chairs to sit in, Steve moving the shield off his back and to lean against the side of his leg. He found the chair comfortable and a good height for his long legs. Fortunately, as he was likely to be here a while.
The man turned to Steve, expression curious. He offered a blunt-tipped hand. “I’m Tyrick, ship’s captain.”
“No one’s actively shooting at me, so as strange as this situation is, I can safely say that I’ve been through worse.” Steve let go and looked around with interest. “Are you an artificer?”
“That…” Stark assessed his tired state and smiled. “Okay, that’s fair.” He stood up. “I can come back in the morning.”
Steve blinks, and there’s a millisecond delay between the movement in both of his eyes, one slightly slower than the other. Impossible to notice unless you were staring at him fixatedly, like Tony is doing right now.
Granted, it’s not by Steve’s choice, either. In fact, Tony is pretty sure no one bothered to inform Thor of the entire ordeal he missed while roaming through space, so, when he comes back and decides they should gather the team together before Thanos comes, no one tells him to ask for Steve or Tony’s opinion beforehand.
“I expect you to have faith,” Rogers replies. “As the villagers do. Zola’s reign of terror in this land won’t last much longer.”
“In the meantime,” Bruce continued, back to looking at the tablet, and Steve got the distinct feeling he was avoiding looking at him. “Is there anything else about your health you want to talk about? Anything bothering you?”
“Fair enough.” Steve raises his flute, and the way Tony looks at him makes him feel as if he already drank, sending a pleasant, warm feeling down his chest that makes him grin. “To Vision and Wanda.”
As the hours went by, walking with Steve through the MET’s hallways, watching the way he frowned thoughtfully at a few pieces and stopped to analyze every detail, Tony’s thoughts changed. Museums could be fun, he realized. Museums could be… witty, and smart, and sweet. Really, museums were so, so…
“Sorry,” Steve said, suddenly, and for a moment it seemed that he was talking to Tony. He blinked, his cheeks a deep red as he seemed to remember who he was supposed to be saying that word to, turning towards the aliens.
Tony gives him a light, tender pat on his face. “See you later.” As Steve backs away, Tony blows him a silent kiss, because—well, because he looked really cute in the tiny chair and Tony just can’t help it. Steve smiles, before turning away in the direction of the door.
Steve pressed his lips together in a thin line. While that was an obvious request for a back rub, he didn’t want to relinquish the protection of his oversized t-shirt.
Okay, so that settled the food question, at least. Tony picked up some salad with his fork while his hand found Steve’s, giving him a calming squeeze.
“Okay,” Bruce says, from behind the worktable. “Don’t forget it, Tony – break it to him in small doses. Be calm and go slow.”
– feels like something completely different from what he and Tony are doing right now, not even in the same stratosphere. “Just—once.”
“I think you should go to sleep.” Rhodey’s hand squeezes his shoulder gently. “I think you should take a break, let FRIDAY or me monitor him, and then when you get back, your mind is gonna be clearer, and maybe you’ll have another insight.”
“No,” Steve says. “I get it.” And he really, really does. They’ve been too close to something like this to take it lightly. “Coming inside, having to play it up for the reporters, it was… very strange. I know it’s hard to not think about... things we don’t want to remember. But this is a happy night.” The corner of his lips twirls upwards in a small smile. “We need to be good guests and not forget about that.”
Tony takes a deep breath. He tries to enjoy this moment of advantage as much as he can, but it’s hard. Every muscle in his body is clenching at Barnes’ presence, and he can feel his breaths getting shorter, even as he fights to keep control of them.
is like fire in Steve’s chest, his face burning of embarrassment and pleasure. “Do you like to hear that you’re pretty? Because you are. It’s—
He desperately wanted to get inside and forget about that ridiculous show he had given Stark in the middle of the night. But, of course, he couldn’t.
“Are you sure?” he asks, and Steve isn’t even going to dignify that with an answer. He knows Tony is used to this sort of thing, and he must be able to tell Steve isn’t, which explains all the questions. But Steve doesn’t want to be coddled – doesn’t want to Tony to worry about offending his sensibilities or anything of the sort. So he starts to take action, taking his hands to his tie, loosening it.
Not because of some exacerbated insecurity or anything. As anyone who knows him can attest, Tony is far from oblivious to his appeal. He knows he’s an attractive man, and that he could charm his way out of nearly anything, if he wanted to.
? he forced himself to think, as he followed Stark to the living room. He wasn’t doing anything inappropriate.
“You’re very transparent,” Stark comments. Steve, against all odds, manages to feel embarrassed even in that situation, with Stark’s dick in the middle of his ass.
Steve made a face. “The High Priestess said… some things last night, when you went to the bathroom.”
“Yes,” Tony says, slowly. Some engine inside his brain has started twirling, even if he hasn’t processed why. “With you. What about that makes anything I did inappropriate?”
Steve winces at his words. He looks downwards, tries to pull his hand away again. “Tony. What happened…” His jaw clenches, and Tony is watching in real time, Steve Rogers pulling himself together, closing himself to Tony. “I’m so sorry. For, for everything… This…” He raises his free hand to gesture around them, and the whole room distorts further, as if in response.
“I also don’t know how he will take it.” Bruce clutches his hands together, nervously. “Psychologically, I mean… If Stone’s data is correct, and there’s no reason to think it wouldn’t be, he’s living in his dream world. Most importantly, he thinks what he’s dreaming is actually real. If we just turn everything off, it will be a huge shock.”
“So,” Tony started, after he positioned himself. “Is there a specific spot or area that’s been bugging you?”
, Steve thought, way too forceful for his own liking. He shut his eyes, not wanting to deal with the darkness around him. Even though Stark wasn’t looking at him – was going to his bedroom, if the distance in the sound of his steps was any indication - he felt exposed, as if he had been humiliated.
He presses a kiss to Steve’s lips, chaste. Steve’s mouth is sensitive from all the kissing, so even that touch is enough to make him shiver.
“Pretty much, yeah.” Tony’s eyes are already closed, but he has to open one of them to ask. “Why—wait, you agreed because you thought I was going to use you in a different way, didn’t you?”
“What do you mean?” Steve asks, with a little frown between his eyebrows that Tony’s hand itches to smooth it out. “I know it seems silly, but it’s really funny.” He turns, and, at Clint’s gaze, grows more indignant. “The pictures are very good and the captions are really creative.”
Because the thing is: Tony loves volunteering. Sometimes the kids are moody, other times they’re more cooperative, but one thing that never changes is that they operate on a bizarrely individual logic that only makes sense in their heads, and they don’t see why it wouldn’t make sense on everyone else’s, which kind of fascinates Tony.
“Okay.” Tony punctuates his statement with a long, deep kiss, and Steve feels himself relaxing, his body welcoming the weight of Tony over him.
“But?” he asks, which—okay, so he doesn’t get it. That’s… fine, Tony thinks. They’re both fumbling their way through this. The thought is strangely comforting.
“I’m not a pro, but I have a few tricks,” Tony said. “Besides, from what I’ve read, your case is pretty mild. Anyway, nowadays there’s surgery, too, which also can help.”
No wonder Tony flared up about it, Howard thinks as he swallows another glass. Tony was always obsessed with the knights’ tales, the ones Maria read to him before bed.
His hand acts on its own volition, touching the reactor and circling the skin around it. Tony lets him, his smile wide and comforting, and Steve thinks that one single lifetime is probably not even enough.
As Tony starts undoing the buttons of Steve’s shirt, the air feels short, unable to fill Steve’s desperate lungs. Instead of the blinding desire of before, his arousal builds in a crescendo, following every movement of Tony’s fingers, every flicker of his eyes over newly revealed skin. His stomach clutches at the thought of being exposed, but above all is the
He should be angry, shouldn’t he? Or maybe Steve should – Tony certainly thought he would have some leftover protective fury over Barnes. They should be apologizing to each other, or, hell, even fighting again.
race in the galaxy to lie to, even if they didn’t even mean to tell a lie in the first place. Just Tony’s luck.
“What is the matter with my trunks?” Steve’s voice cuts through Tony’s scientific observation. He sounds grumpy, which makes Tony look, because grumpy Steve is really cute, especially when his face is flushed from the sun.
? A mean-spirited but reasonable voice echoed inside him. Stark clearly didn’t have trouble finding partners, and Steve had seen the type of men he usually brought home – a far cry from himself, definitely. Even if they slept together, what reason would he have to try anything?
He did his best to keep his mind off the kiss, but it was a futile effort. On the rare moments where he managed to forget the soft, sweet feel of Steve’s lips, his mind was drawn back to the bedroom, to Steve’s muffled sobs. Those small, pained noises.
The Steve in front of him right now, the Steve who’s apparently living a happy fantasy in his head – Tony doesn’t know him.
Tony’s mouth quirks as if it had a life of its own - a notion Howard certainly wouldn’t dispute - but he ducks his head, eyes staring down at his lap.
By the time Friday arrived, he was already regretting following Rhodey’s suggestion – what was so great about the MET, anyway? And even if Steve liked it, Tony couldn’t stand art museums, not even the Louvre, so wasn’t this proof of the unavoidable truth that they were ultimately incompatible? It had to be, right? Really, he should just cancel the whole thing and spare them the inevitable misery.
. Well, until now, I guess.”  Tony raises his hand, almost touching the man’s fancy suit. “Did you just come through the portal?”
Nobody but him seems to notice Tony’s late arrival. The ceremony proceeds as is expected. Steve watches, patting Sam’s back when he can’t hold back more tears as Wanda and Vision say their vows. He’s mostly impressed by how much Wanda glows, figuratively and literally at some points, when magic sparks around her in what seems like an involuntary reaction. It probably is – there’s no trace of her usual tense demeanor, just unabashed, unrestrained happiness.
He had barely believed it when he saw it, hovering over the beach and preparing to land. He had just announced his arrival over the comms to everyone else, and, yeah, maybe he should have been focused on saying hello to the Barton children, who were shrieking excitedly about seeing Iron Man, but instead he immediately focused his vision to check out Steve’s choice of bathing attire, and what he found was scandalizing.
“Oh trust me, I know what it says. I have a month to summon a familiar and complete the last of the Trials or I’m done.” Tony laughed, a little bitterly. He’d been skirting by as being a novice mage for years now, well past the time that he should have graduated. And it wasn’t like he didn’t understand the concepts of magic. It’s just that his magic didn’t want to cooperate.
“I do, rather, although I wish I didn’t in this case.” Tony traded him letter for tray, as he didn’t want to hold the letter anyway. Not that he had much interest in food right now.
Steve stopped abruptly on a street corner and looked back. With his memory, it wasn’t really possible to get lost. Still, he didn’t want to wander far, either. He didn’t have any of the local currency on him, or even travel papers to show. He was already several blocks away from Tony’s shop. Best to head back.
“Supernatural?” Stark supplied. “Yeah, I see what you mean. Though honestly,” his lips curled in another smile that somehow seemed more reluctant, “it doesn’t take long with you to figure out something is up.”
“Much better.” Tony makes a show of yawning and stretching his arm above his head. “Sorry for, uh, being weird before.” He watches Steve from the corner of his eye, alert to his every movement.
Dinner was strangely comforting. Steve wasn’t really hungry, but Stark was clearly starving, and he devoured the leftovers from Sam’s pasta salad with enviable appetite. When he wasn’t talking and making plans, he was going at the plate like a champ, and Steve found himself grinning at him.
Steve smiles. The ring on his finger is a welcome feel, a daily comfort he’s grown used to in the past years. He smiles and thinks of Tony’s smile, and he knows that in the end those five seconds weren’t just his to give away like that.
with someone at a wedding, it wouldn’t be with Tony, of all people. Tony, more than anyone else, would have no reason to be interested, aware as he is of the many ways Steve doesn’t really live up to the legend built around him.
He shuts his eyes one last time before pushing himself to sit up. The brightness around him slowly takes shape as Tony’s workshop. Steve is on a lab table, and there’s a second one close to him. Steve notices Bruce and Rhodey, standing nearby, and then.
It was easy to say it now, though, in hindsight. During the battle, no one knew if the spaceship had been fully evacuated, and Steve’s position was ideal to drop in. Sure, he could have waited, but HYDRA clearly wanted what was inside the ship, and, if there was anyone in there, any second they missed increased the risk of casualties, and Steve didn’t want any lives lost that day, alien or not.
Tony stares at him for a moment; then he opens a slow, wide grin that makes something inside Steve open its eyes, take a breath and live again – something he hadn’t even known was dead until now.
Steve swallows, feels his stomach clenching, his posture stiffening and face heating. Five seconds, he thinks. All he has to give.
“First drawer on your right,” Tony breathes. Steve keeps going, moving from one ball to the other, sometimes opening his mouth a little wider to suck both at the same time. He enjoys the short, gasping breaths Tony lets out – he loves those sounds, loves knowing he’s the one who’s causing them. “But he’s –
“Nope. He’s like an all-american Sleeping Beauty,” Tony says, internally grateful for managing to sound casual.
He was going to be one hell of a sight at dinner the next night. With some luck, maybe the other guests would think he and Steve had spent the night awake in the way a happily married couple would, and not as they were right now, with Steve on the couch and Tony feeling like shit on the bed.
, Tony thought, watching Steve struggle with his phone settings to attempt to take a selfie with a painting and having to fight back an honest to god sigh.
But he hadn’t expected the look on Steve’s face. He could have expected a lot – including an angry reply that turned into a screaming match, and hell, maybe that was his
“C’mere,” Tony mumbles, his voice raspy as if he’s about to fall asleep. The duvet moves as - Steve assumes - Tony raises his other arm, and even though he can’t see it, Steve would bet actual money he’s making grabby hands. “Come on.”
Tony looks over his shoulder and smiles. “Thought so.” He fishes his phone out of his pockets, presses a few buttons.
Something sharp and cold stung in the inside of Tony’s chest. For some reason, hearing the disdain in Ayesha’s voice hurt. Even though it made no sense, to him it was as if she knew everything that was going through his mind and heart in the last couple of days and saw how ridiculous and pathetic it all was. The hurried kisses, the gentle touches, the warm feel of Steve’s hand in his – none of it was real. None of it
This isn’t entirely true – Howard could, he imagines, send a few more men to meet the Captain’s forces. But that would weaken their own defenses more than he’s comfortable with. He’s already playing a large risk, allying himself to the Captain’s cause.
“You look as if you’ve seen a ghost,” he said, and Steve opened his mouth to argue, but he was interrupted by a loud meowing sound coming from Stark’s apartment. “Oh, shush, you. As if you don’t already know it’s him.”
Deep down, Tony would regret the anger, and that, more than anything, would sting – not thinking of how much Steve didn’t trust him, but of how Tony had proven him right.
For a few blissful minutes, the servants’ franticness spared them of the need to make small talk with Ayesha and her two friends. They worked fast, though, and before Tony knew it, the table was set and the group was bowing and retreating, the large metallic door closing automatically as soon as they stepped outside.
He clings to Steve, then. His body is shaking so hard, Steve is afraid he’s having an anxiety attack; but after a while, it steadies.
”, Steve hums again, this time much more pleasantly, head almost following the movement of Tony’s hand.
Steve opens his mouth to protest, but his words are swallowed by Tony’s tongue, and then Tony is straddling him, his cock pressed against Steve’s stomach, wet and firm. Steve raises his hips, chasing the friction, and Tony lets him feel it for one glorious moment, before pulling away with one light bite to Steve’s lower lip, to sit at his ankles.
“Sounds like you’re having fun,” Bruce says, and that’s the understatement of the year, because Steve looks downright delighted. He struggles to catch his breath, still grinning helplessly as he looks away from his phone.
“I was late.” He leans back on the table, mimicking Steve and putting his hands in his pockets. His elbow brushes Steve’s forearm at the movement.
He leans forward, and Steve is so close. Tony’s eyes land on his lips – those gorgeous lips that look so soft – but he quickly looks away, finding Steve’s gaze instead. He can’t hurry now. This is the moment he’s been waiting for for months. Tony wants it to be perfect.
a dog? Did you really just say that?” Steve’s voice was low and rigid with fury. “He’s a living being. One that you’re supposed to take care of, but—” Steve glanced at the small Pomeranian, still being held, and his heart ached. He would have taken him right from his uncaring owner’s hands if that wasn’t technically stealing. “It doesn’t matter, because that was clearly not your dog.” He looked up to find Stark’s big, brown eyes blinking at him as if Steve was saying something deeply intriguing. “I don’t have time to deal with this right now.”
Tony forces himself to shrug, this time. “I’m just asking,” he says. His voice is a little weak, but he pushes himself to keep going. He feels like he’s poking the wound but it somehow refuses to bleed, and he needs that, needs that hurt, to ground himself in reality. “Me and Steve, we can be—I mean. Let’s just say a lot of people wouldn’t have seen this, I mean,
a reasonable voice that sounded suspiciously like Rhodey whispered in his head. Which of course, was true. Tony had no actual claim to Steve, not now and not ever. Whoever he slept with was none of his business.
“Gonna meet Sam at the park,” Steve says, and it takes Tony’s genius, brilliant brain a moment to catch up. Oh, yeah. He always liked Sam, which, clearly, was a terrible mistake.
Steve touches his arm. “Just… stay a little.” Stark’s eyes widen, and, to Steve’s complete surprise, his face flushes. Steve tries to pull him in, even though his body feels boneless. “You two can work on the portal later.”
Tony turns back to the gauntlet. “Nothing new, then,” he says, and his voice shakes a little. He makes a point to reign it in – there’s no time to lose control now.
“This is amazing,” Steve says. He’s at that stage where it seems like his cheeks hurt from smiling. Tony thinks he should look like this more often. Maybe all the time. “When they explained it at SHIELD, I thought the internet was more of a tool, like a huge encyclopedia. And obviously, it is, but it didn’t occur to me it could be…”
He stops a few steps from Tony, in front of the bed. His expression is confused, and Tony’s heart tightens. He pats the spot next to him on the mattress.
“You never told me,” Tony says, and even saying it hurts, the truth weighting over them like an anchor. “You knew, for years, and you didn’t tell me.”
“Cheers,” Tony says, clinking their glasses, but it’s a far cry from their toast months ago. There’s something incredibly focused about Tony’s eyes as he watches Steve take his sip, something that makes Steve’s tie feel too tight.
“I’d rather stick with my shield,” Steve said. Tony’s hands started spreading the new oil all over, in soothing, large swipes, and he couldn’t help but close his eyes. Tony’s touch was comforting, his hands heavy and yet gentle, and his words were still warming up Steve in the inside. “You sure people would take my orders in this size?” he asked, a little dazed.
Congrats, Tony, you've summoned a Steve! Don't worry, you'll think of all sorts of things to do with him.
Snorting, Tony denied, “I wish. No. A familiar-mage bond would not change how my magic works, more’s the pity. It comes incredibly handy when I’m working on something, though. I can see the strength and weakness in any metal I’m crafting, for instance.”
The same man that had greeted them earlier approached, a smile stretching from ear to ear. “Tony Stark, you are the man of the hour. Thank you so much.”
“A soldier,” Tony breathed, and the proverbial light flicked on in his dark eyes. “Gods above, of course. Of course.” He abruptly turned, words tripping over themselves as he explained, “My magic is strange. It doesn’t work like any other mage you’ve likely seen, it can’t do creation magic to save my life. I actually put that to the test once and failed miserably—”
“No chance in hell, not with magic at least, which is why I use other means. Guns and I are friends.” Tony swallowed hard, eyes still locked on Steve. “You said you’re were a soldier? As in no longer?”
The other man looked nice, too, taller and darker in skin than his companion. He was watching Steve as if he’d started a strip show, eyes in danger of leaving his head altogether. Steve didn’t know what he’d done to warrant that reaction. Steve was in casual wear of khaki pants and a leather jacket, as he’d been on the way to the docks to work out some frustration. Then again, maybe it was him being here at all that garnered this reaction? Steve was certainly surprised to go from docks to this cluttered workroom with no warning.
“First clause.” Steve waited until Tony’s eyes flitted back up to his. “You’re forgetting the first clause. Your magic does indeed know what it’s doing. I’m not obligated to someone else, I’m not bound to be anywhere. I don’t have any family left to speak of. I’m not in a hurry to get back home, to tell you the truth. This situation is beyond strange, but also fantastical in the best sense. I want to see how it plays out a little. And right now, the two of you are guessing, right? This is your theory on why I’m here.”
“Uh-oh,” Tony said under his breath. “Steve, I think you’re about to see me in action. Yaegar, what’s happening?”
He looked up to see how the shopping was coming only to find that Steve had changed into a soft navy blue shirt that did really amazing things for both his eyes and biceps and yes. Absolutely yes, they were buying that one.
Tony, my love, if you ask very nicely you can totally keep Steve, okay? Because Steve is bored out of his mind and you are most definitely his kind of challenge.
“Shit, Tony, I think you just set a new summoning record for distance,” Rhodey breathed, taking Steve in from head to toe in a disconcerting manner. “And I think I know what happened here.”
Tony vibrated in place, shifting from foot to foot, eager to be off. As soon as Steve hit the threshold of the door, he slammed it shut again without bothering to lock it this time and sprinted down the hill. Steve easily kept pace with him, and poor Yaegar frantically tried to do so, although he lagged immediately behind, as he was still struggling to catch his breath.
A full minute, under the wrong circumstances, could feel like a decade. Steve nodded in understanding and rearranged them to where he had an arm hooked into the rigging, both feet planted against the decking with knees slightly bent. Tony stepped in between his legs, putting his back to Steve’s chest. He was warm and fit snugly against Steve. He smelled good, too, like musk.
After that initial jerk, the ship’s sideways movement died down, and it settled again with a slight creak. Steve didn’t automatically release Tony when that happened. He found that he couldn’t, his protective instincts flaring despite the danger being past. “Alright?”
“Fortunately.” Although they weren’t speaking Steve’s native language. But he had an ear for languages and this was one he’d learned during the war, a universal trader’s language. Interesting that they used it so naturally. “Hello. I’m Steve Rodgers. Who are you and why am I here?”
No one was really working, everyone intent on the scene outside of the harbor. And it was quite the scene. A huge whale was half-tangled next to a large fishing ship, a fin and part of the side sticking up out of the water. It thrashed a little as Steve watched and the ship rocked back and forth with it. Even from here, Steve fancied he could hear the yells of panic and dismay from those on board.
“To sum it up, buttercup, that’s precisely right. And now I need a nap. And alcohol. Ooh, alcohol then a nap. That’s the better order.”
Tony was abruptly awake. He threw the covers back, pulling on the first clothes at hand, and stumbled through to the kitchen. Only to stop dead at the bar and watch as Steve skillfully flipped pancakes before turning over bacon in a different pan. The kitchen was clean (why?), everything laid out for a breakfast of two along the white counter.
Tony slipped past with a quick smile, then greeted the store proprietor with a wave. “Morning, Henry.”
“—but that’s neither here nor there, the point is I’ve figured out that I can destroy things just fine, that seems to be where my talent lies, but it takes me forever to get an incantation out. I can’t use grimoires, or static spells, they don’t mesh well with me. I have to do fresh, tailored spells every time. Longest spell I use it something like a three minute incantation.”
“I’ll even help supply you with magic power, to boost you,” Rhodey offered, smiling now because he’d gotten his way.
Rhodey allowed the swap, and as he read the letter, his dark brows furrowed tight together in mounting concern. “Tony…this says….”
He lowered the glass, focusing on inhaling and exhaling. At some point, he felt the warm, light touch of the cat rubbing its head against his calf.
Tony ran his hand down his face, coming over his mouth. Steve just stood there, and Tony had the irrational urge to shake him. Not only were they lying to one of the most ruthless species in the galaxy, but their leader had seen enough cracks on their fake romance to attempt to insert herself in the middle of it. What a mess.
“I—I shouldn’t have said that.” Tony’s voice sounded hoarse, every word scratching his throat as he spoke. “I don’t know why I did. Actually, scratch that, I do. I… thought that, at one point. I.” He swallowed. “I’d lie in bed at night thinking that.”
“Easy,” Tony whispers, taking his hands to Steve’s shoulders, and starting a small, subtle sway. “Follow my lead.”
“I must say,” Rogers starts, sitting on the opposite end of the large dinner table. “This is quite a change from the last time we’ve spoken.”
When they’re finishing desert, Tony gives him a long, thoughtful look with those brown eyes, and Steve shivers.
Steve frowns. “…Dancing?” He asks, hesitant, but Tony snaps his fingers as if he’s said something particularly insightful.
“Stop moving,” Tony chastises when Steve makes the ghost of a motion to pull away. Even then, though, he peppers his words with kisses, following along the line of Steve’s jaw, his silky skin with only the lightest touch of stubble.
Tony tries, but it’s impossible. Before, it felt like a painful, but rational situation: Steve choosing Barnes over him, choosing to keep Barnes safe over trusting Tony. A straight, clean knife in Tony’s back.
“Yeah.” His eyes, his smile, all his focus entirely on Steve - it’s almost overwhelming, but it’s an overwhelming Steve can’t get enough of. “Don’t want to drink tonight,” he says, between a smile Steve is pretty certain could melt actual titanium. Then he swallows, his nostrils widening as he takes a deep breath. “You know, I… I have a room at the palace.”
“Fuck me,” Steve says, and he’d be shocked at himself if not for the way Tony’s eyes widen and his hand immediately freezes on his hair. “You—you, too. I… I want you to do it.” His eyes go from Tony’s face to his cock.
Howard glances at Tony’s reaction. Part of him feels curious, the other part is already at the kitchen, thinking about the Romanoff’s bottle.
So when the morning arrived, Tony, who had managed to catch about three hours of sleep on the hall’s couch, was feeling very tired, grumpy, and not at all ready to face Steve. Which… really wasn’t that distant from his normal state, when he thought about it, so he guessed he could work with that.
“I’m not sure.” Howard follows his bite with a sip of milk. It tastes incredibly bland. “There’s a lot to consider.”
not feel Tony’s mouth on his anymore, so he pretty much dives onto him, mouth desperate, hands grabbing fistfuls of Tony’s jacket. He whispers
“Is that seriously a surprise to you?” Stark asked. “I mean, you must have known something was off, right?”
“And what if you fail? What if I promise Tony will marry you, indisposing myself with the Bains, and then you face Zola and he delivers your head on my doorstep?”
As Steve feels the hard length of Tony moving inside him, he loses track of his own words, his mouth a mess of sounds and noises, out of his control. Tony’s head sinks on his neck, his lips whispering a million praises mixed with aimless swears, as he gains traction. Steve marvels at his breathless state, at the mess of the usually so sharp man he knows. “So good, baby—God, I fucking knew it, knew you’d feel
Steve walked to him. As soon as his eyes landed on the crate, his heart broke; the dog was probably a medium-sized stray, but he seemed much smaller because of how curled up in the far corner of the crate he was. His bright blue eyes seemed sad and scared, his whines growing louder by the minute.
“Have a good sleep,” he says. There’s a spark of something else, frailer, almost insecure, in his voice, that tugs Tony’s heartstrings before smashing them altogether. “I love you.”
Tony moves, and Steve almost shudders in anticipation, but instead of touching him, Tony extends his hand.
“I’ve been told.” Howard makes a gesture towards Rogers’ glass. “Come on, don’t let a man drink alone.”
Personally, this is Tony’s favorite theory. It’s simple, but it makes complete sense and explains everything. And the best part about it is that it’s something that only time can fix, which means there’s nothing Tony can do about it at the moment. He just has to wait until Steve is ready to take the next step.
“Oh, please, don’t hurry because of me,” Stark interjects. For someone who has just been transported to a different universe, he doesn’t sound wary in the least, and suddenly it occurs to Steve he might not be fully sober. “I can wait outside. Take as much time as you want – hurrying can be fun, but it’s not really my thing, personally.”
Barnes turns slightly, giving him a head nod and turning back to the newspaper. Tony stops right across the counter, in front of him.
but he barely has the time to feel embarrassed about it before he feels the pressure of Tony’s thick length.
Steve opens his mouth to answer, but he’s cut short by a warm weight on his arm. “Are you sure? Everything is fine?” Tony asks, hand curling around Steve’s forearm.
Rogers seems surprised by the response, but then he shakes his head. “You can take as long as you need, lord Stark.”
“Anyone who saw you would guess it’s the only one. I don’t see you taking advantage of the romantic vibe.”
didn’t seem impossible – it was certainly what motivated Stark’s casual flirtations towards him on a daily basis, anyway – but somehow it didn’t match with the sincerity of Stark’s offer, or the gentle concern in his eyes. It would be too cruel, too
“I think we should be aiming to get things harder, if you know what I mean,” Tony’s mouth spoke of its own volition, because he couldn’t help it. Steve’s disappointment was always both infuriating and comforting somehow, as if things were where they were supposed to be when Steve was mad at him.
“I was just. Uh. Thinking.” Tony presses his lips together, trying to be strategic about this. Fuck it, he decides. “What you said before, about… about knowing what you were getting into. When you—when you married me.” The words are choked out, because it feels foreign, to say that to someone. To say it to Steve, specifically, feels almost otherworldly.
“I’ll watch over him, okay?” he says, and Tony nods, shakily. He feels tired and weak and useless, and his brain is already in self-sabotage mode, thinking of Steve’s vitals changing just as Tony closes his eyes, of his life signs dropping as soon as Tony drifts off to sleep. “Tony. You can do this. I believe in you, and… I think he’d believe in you, too.” Rhodey’s voice is certain, unwavering. “He’d know you’d manage to get him out.”
He feels Steve’s arms coming to his waist and pulling him against him, before he rolls both of them over on the bed.
“Tony,” Rhodey interrupts. Tony looks at him, sustaining his worried, tired dark gaze. “Maybe if you took a break and let someone else look at him—”
Tony just goes along, playing up the role of sleep-deprived zombie, because even his genius mind needs a moment to wrap itself around what’s happening.
It was the only reason he'd talked to Stark in the first place. After the third time he found the cat wandering around, Steve had marched to the apartment and nearly slammed down the door, ready to rip his neighbor a new one, because if you chose to have a pet, then you'd better be responsible and
“’Morning,” Steve says, with a yawn. He turns to lie on his back and stretches his body. His sleeping t-shirt rides up a little, and Tony, who is by no means a religious man, thanks whatever deity might be listening that he can’t see the peek of Steve’s rear that those low-hanging sweatpants definitely don’t manage to hide.
Steve gave a stiff nod. Through his eyelids, he noticed when Stark turned off the lights, the darkness enveloping him.
Tony’s hands stopped moving. “Yes, you are. It’s just a matter of reversing the ray’s mechanism – Bruce and I will get it done in a few more days.” Even already knowing that, relief loosened Steve’s chest. “But…”
“Yes,” Tony replies, and Howard feels a tinge of annoyance at the indignation that fills his expression, as if Howard has insulted him deeply. “He used to live here, years ago, as a child. Don’t you remember?” He frowns as if the possibility honestly confuses him. “He tended the stables. How could you not remember?”
“Is that all, then?” He asks, barely bothering to hide his eagerness, as soon as Obadiah pauses to breathe.
“Good,” is all he can say before Steve pulls him closer, clearly not giving two shits about morning breath as he kisses Tony as open-mouthed and sweet as he had last night.
When they got inside the building and took the elevator, Steve started squirming, moving his little paws up and down.
(Steve had, of course, been the universe’s kindest asshole, insisting Tony took the bed every night. Tony attempted to argue, but Steve didn’t bulge, so he ended up giving in and sleeping on the bed. It was very comfortable, but he still had a hard time falling asleep, mind wandering, unable to not try to imagine how it would be like to have Steve by his side.)
Tony’s smile grows into a laugh. His eyes sparkle, bright and wide, as he looks at Steve as if what he’s just said is the most wonderful thing he’s heard all day. “Good point,” he says. Then he drowns out his glass and snaps his fingers, not looking away, and the poor waiter, who Steve had forgotten completely about, comes closer to give him two more flutes. “Thanks, buddy,” Tony slips a bill over the tray that Steve is pretty sure is a 100. When he turns to Steve, he raises his glass to meet his. “But you should know, Cap, that both people have to drink to make it a toast.”
“We weren’t sure of that ourselves.” Steve’s eyes turned blind in memory. “We didn’t go looking for that fight. But it came to us regardless. Every able-bodied man was called to enlist. I tried, but I wasn’t fighting fit, not then. I had two terrible health conditions that barred me from it. As the war progressed, they were desperate for more soldiers, and the mages started putting their heads together. Trying to find ways to heal people, take in the ones not healthy enough to serve, and get them to a strong state. I volunteered for one of their pilot programs. It was touch and go for about three months, but one of the mages made a breakthrough. It worked on me and worked well. I became what you see now.”
“Uh, yes, that’s currently how I’m paying the bills and just how comfortable are you with mages that you can recognize an artificer’s workshop in a glance? And, sorry, back up but did you say shot at? People shoot at you?”
“Get everyone well clear,” Tony ordered as he moved purposefully for the main mast. “When this thing snaps, it’ll take everything out in its path. I—whoa!”
Tony sucked in a breath. He was less concerned with how Steve viewed him and more curious about who Steve was. “Okay, so who are you? And why do I see traces of magic in your system?”
But it was because of all this that he couldn’t pass the Trials. The Trials were a three part test, the first of which was a written exam (Tony had passed that one with flying colors), summoning a familiar, and finally a practical exam. He’d stalled on the second part because summoning was very close to the end of the magical spectrum that he sucked at.
“That’s always the question.” Tony spun in place, taking in the many tables filled with half-done projects, and cast his mind back to the last time he’d scrawled a design out onto one of his massive chalkboards. He couldn’t even remember what day that was. “Maybe…yeah, I have no clue, I’m not pretending otherwise. A new box should be in the supply cabinet, just grab one from there.”
Tony blamed the purple shirt for his mind going into the gutter. It was definitely the shirt’s fault as it molded to Steve with all the loving detail of a lover’s hands. That shirt left very little to the imagination.
He’d been having a good day before the postman had dropped letters into his mail slot. Normally, Tony would ignore that until someone tripped over it (likely him). But he’d been expecting a payment from a customer, and so he’d scooped up the bundle to thumb through it. The official letter from the magic council with its waxed embossed seal had caught his eye. And filled him with dread. He never heard anything good from them.
“Yes, good, you’ve got the basics. So, first rule is that the familiar summoned can’t belong to anyone else. Second is that it must have the strength and talents necessary to support the mage, as you just said. Third and last rule is that it must be willing to be bound.” Rhodey explained this in a very neutral tone of voice.
Okay, that Tony couldn’t let stand. He hopped off the stool and went towards it immediately, studying it better. He lifted it in his hands, felt the solid weight of it, but saw too the construction. The spells integrated in with the cold metal. “Wow. Seriously, wow, I’ve not seen something constructed like this. It’s pure vibranium, the highest concentration I’ve ever seen. And you’ve got some serious spellwork in this thing. A call to home tied in with your blood—seriously? You have a shield acting like a carrier pigeon? Who even thought of that? And there’s reinforcement spells, not that you likely need them on a vibranium shield. And a beacon spell, I assume so mages can target on you. Shit, Steve. Who
“I’m not sure if I’ve ever heard them, officially.” Steve would remember if he had. His memory retained everything. “But I’ve heard that a familiar has to have the innate ability to both aid and guard a mage. Which is why they vary so much from mage to mage, as each mage has different needs.”
Reinforced, thereby a sharp knife couldn’t easily cut through? Steve knew absolutely nothing about fishing, but that’s what these two were intimating. They were closing on the ship rapidly, the little skiff basically skipping over the top of the water with its speed. Steve ignored the spray of seawater against his face and clothes, as he needed operational parameters on this before they arrived. “Tony! What are you planning to do?”
“Yeah, my eyes don’t really take a break. I’ve learned how to look past it. Sometimes. But mostly everything in the world has lines and numbers faintly glowing.”
“Oh, they cared during the war. But I’ve served my purpose. I came home to a quiet apartment, Tony. I’ve been knocking about a city that’s become a stranger to me, talking to anyone I see just to pass the time. I really, truly, do not know what to do with myself. I’ve thought about it a lot ever since I came home.” His mouth quirked at the corners. “I admit, being a familiar to a mage wasn’t anywhere on my list.”
Tony, honey, I need you to understand that Steve is observant. Steve is well aware that you enjoy looking at him and he's playing to the crowd. Playing very hard to that crowd.
But if Tony wasn’t healthy, then perhaps his magic had tried to compensate for it? By summoning the strongest protector it could.
“Not anymore, at least. I was a soldier for years. Worked with lots of mages during the war.” Steve regarded him curiously. Most artificers were highly intelligent, or at least that was his experience. And magically creative. It fashioned something of a contradiction for him, because if Tony worked as an artificer, shouldn’t he be exceptional at magic? But then he bungled a basic spell. “Where am I, anyway? Aside from your workplace.”
He went to bed just before dawn, snatching a few hours of sleep, and then woke up blearily to the sounds of someone moving about in the kitchen. There was someone. In his kitchen? At—here he fumbled and found the clock on his nightstand, cranking open one eye to look at the time. Fuck, it was barely eight o’clock in the morning. Who functioned at eight o’clock in the morning? That had to be criminal or something.
“Basically that, yeah.” Tony dared a peek. Odd, Steve just looked thoughtful instead of pitying. Tony hated the pity above all and he got it from all sides. “I don’t understand why I got you in the first place. And I still have to figure out how to get you home again.”
But coming home, it had hurt his chances of blending back into society. He was treated as a war hero in some places, but others didn’t know how to react to him. They tended to shy away instead. The dichotomy of it all had confused him in turn. What was he supposed to do?
“Fair enough. Can I do the job of your familiar for the next week?” Steve gestured to the store they were fast approaching. “I’d feel bad about you buying me things without doing anything to earn them.”
“Okay,” Tony said. Steve braced for his touch, but, even after a moment, there was nothing. “Uh, Steve? I need you to take your shirt off.”
He watches the way Tony’s mouth curls when he lowers his glass, the way it breaks into an approving smile as if Steve’s done something amazing.
“Okay, okay, guys,” Tony reigns the room in. “Don’t worry, it’s nothing Cap here”--he lowers both of his hands over Steve’s shoulders--“can’t handle. Just a minor hiccup, really. Happens every week.”
Steve shrugs, forgetting the snack on the table. He takes his hands to his pockets instead. “That’s one advantage.”
With considerable effort, Tony finishes turning on the bed, face falling onto his pillow as he lies on his belly and watches as Steve crouches to – Jesus Christ – tie up
“Not all of us have free time to troll on Twitter, Barton,” he says. Then he turns to Steve, who’s watching him with wide blue eyes that almost make him forget how to form words. “So? What’s all the fuss about?”
Stark comes a few moments afterwards, with a strong thrust that makes Steve whimper. Stark’s come floods him, and it feels obscenely good. A little bit of it slips down Steve’s thigh when Stark pulls out, and Steve feels used up, marked. Stark collapses over his back, and Steve enjoys the heat of his pulsing body, eyes fluttering closed as he smiles. He rolls over, shifting to keep Stark tangled with him, by his side.
Except Howard doesn’t see him; Rogers neither sees him, or requests an audience. Instead, as Jarvis tells, Rogers approached the castle’s door and asked if he’s made his decision.
Because he really, really couldn’t. It hadn’t even been ten months since he had taken Anakin in—Lola had taken her time getting used to him, and Steve himself had literally
“Okay,” Tony says immediately, relaxing the grip on his ass. “Okay,” he repeats, louder. “We should slow down a little.”
In his rare free time, Howard retreats to an almost hidden room on the top of the southern tower, a place that he could call his workshop if he still had time to work. The servants aren’t allowed to come inside, so it remains exactly in the state as Howard left it in the last time he came up there. The floor is cluttered with rejected projects – unsharpened blades, broken launches, even something Howard vaguely remembers as an idea for an unusually shaped battering ram. A thick layer of dust covers all these unfinished objects like a blanket, keeping them safe in their inertia.
There’s no way Tony can bring himself to ask these questions, so he doesn’t say anything. Instead, he lets his body answer, and, apparently, it turns out what his body wants is to hold Steve’s hands, so that’s what he does. He stares into Steve’s eyes – he’s fascinated by how the shades of blue mix in them, how they go from cold to warm in about a thousand different ways, how his eyelashes frame them and turn his strong gaze into something almost delicate.
Barnes’ walk turns into a light jog, but as he catches a better look at Tony’s expression, he slows down and frowns.
On his way out, he meets Steve, who was helping the people from the kitchen clean up the kids’ dishes. As soon as they step out of the house, Tony wastes no time in getting all up in his space.
From the wounded look on Steve’s face, Tony’s tension doesn’t go unnoticed. “Are you sure everything's okay?”
That hadn’t been a new thought – actually, it bordered on repetitive at that point, echoing in his head anytime he watched Steve do basically anything - but it apparently resonated with something in Tony’s sleep-deprived brain, because the next thing he knew, he was rambling about reservations that he had made for him and Pepper, and how Pepper had cancelled, and how he missed eating steak, and if Steve wanted to have dinner with him.
“…It isn’t,” Tony says. “I.” He blinks for a moment, adjusting to the information. “How could I have thought it was?”
Steve raises an eyebrow at Tony as he lands, splashing sand around. The armor strips off Tony’s body, slowly exposing the physique he’s definitely flaunting after all those sparring sessions with Thor, because he
whenever he wants to, Tony is more than happy to help with that. He’s just not getting away anytime soon.
Howard draws in a deep breath. “You will marry Captain Rogers.” His eyes snap towards Tony’s face. “The ceremony will be performed after the final battle, of course, but you are now promised to each other, and you are free to accompany him in his expedition, provided, of course, that you keep a distance from the battlefield and remain… proper.”
