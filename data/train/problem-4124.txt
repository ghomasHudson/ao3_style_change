“Yes,” Cas agrees, with a shrug. “But what you’ve had to do is more than Chuck should expect out of anyone.”

Dinner passed pleasantly enough. Ben talked about his karate lessons, Lisa mentioned—with a laugh at herself—that since Dean joked about goat yoga the other day, her sister had actually wanted to try it, so they had standing reservations for Wednesday. This was apparently in addition to the brunches she and Ben had every Sunday with her family. “Do you have any siblings?” she asked Castiel.
Dean buries his fingers into Cas’s wild mess of hair, encouraging him to move closer—and “nggh,”
“Something something I’m a dick who wants to kill everyone,” Uriel rumbles back, while fake Cas stares and Sam’s hair changes lengths repeatedly in the periphery.

Sam hands him his phone.
“That’s how long I’ve been standing here. Ten minutes. While you sniff
“So, are we on?” Sam asks as he scoops up the one nearest to him.
I tilt my head in confusion. “My home is with the Winchesters. We typically don’t invite people to visit.”
Later, they curled up in bed in pajama pants—their hair drying in crazy patterns that they’ll have to deal with in the shower tomorrow morning—bare chests pressed together so it looked like their phoenixes were talking to one another. Idly, Cas wondered what they were saying.
Castiel felt the left corner of his mouth quirk up in amusement. “You’re free to try….”
“I knew I liked you sometimes.”
He would have thought that the last few months of walking the media tightrope would have better prepared him for this kind of socio-political situation. But in the end, he’d rather be a responsible figure in Ben’s life than someone who overlooked his well-being for a few brownie points. “How about you do your homework
“It’s an endangered species of bird—one of Hannah’s favorites. It’s her birthday next week so I donated to the World Wildlife Fund on her behalf, and they send you a plush to represent symbolic adoption. I was planning on getting a bag for it at some point.”
Regardless, it’s clear that Cas doesn’t want to elaborate and Dean isn’t going to make him—not when whatever happened is probably his fault to begin with.

“From my experience with dads, the answer is always both.”
“I get that. But then she was touching my arm and sticking her boobs in my face and I—snapped, I’m sorry.” He actually sounds shaken up about it.
“Is he as hot as you?”
The kitchen was quiet.
This actually prompts Cas to laugh—a movement that crinkles the bridge of his nose. Dean is so screwed.

Dean pushed his head farther into the ridiculously fluffy pillow, a soft
As nervous as he is, he meets Cas’s eyes—wanting to see how he’s taking this. The angel looks back steadily, like a beacon from a lighthouse, and Dean fortifies himself for this next part. “Nothing about my life set me up to trust you. But I did. And when you screwed up with the Leviathans, I ultimately chose to forgive you even when I could have just…cut you out.
“So, the book,” he said to distract both Dean and himself. “What questions did you have?”
“Uh, yes.”
Castiel stood up. “You think
She pauses, biting her lower lip. “Let me correct that. I actually know nothing—less than Jon Snow nothing. Including what his soulmark looks like or what your soulmark looks like. Or why the soulmark scans sent with his medical records came digitally corrupted. And considering I have so much other information to process for this case, I think it makes sense to focus on what will get us closer to the Angel Killer rather than spending time trying to recover this probably-inconsequential file that, again, I know nothing about.”
That was the first day he had ever been grateful for Heaven’s Gate—for his white, padded room containing the bare essentials—a thin mattress on a metal frame, a couple of identical white t-shirts with matching scrub pants—and his few luxuries—a pile of torn-at-the spine books, and the bee plushie he’d had since he was a child.

—up until that last part anyway. There’s nothing wrong with expressing your feelings—or with being female, for that matter.”
Dean should have given Cas more credit. His mother was everything he said she was—and it was pissing him off. “Yeah, actually,” he exclaimed, his anger firing up like an engine. “Because if you were able to look at the situation through your eye holes and not like an asshole, you’d know that Cas is fuckin’ awesome, and his book—which
He and Cas lock gazes—and it’s weird, considering how much work he’s put towards this, how ready he thought he was to meet his soulmate—that all he can think about is what it felt like at thirteen, standing on the lip of the Grand Canyon on his family vacation and realizing how small he was compared to something so big.

Dean snorted. “Tell me about it.” There’s a pause, where the only sound was someone shifting their weight slightly on the steps. “Is it just me—or is Cas actually terrifying?”
Cas shuffles the chair closer, the sound of him moving abnormally loud in the silence, but at last, he’s about two feet away from Dean, leaning forward with his hands between his knees.
“OK, that’s…good,” Dean murmurs, the words slightly shaky as he exhales.
Gabriel was involved

“I don’t understand—how I could have circled—” Castiel responded, though he was mostly talking to himself.
After all, he liked Dean. Trusted him.
Castiel’s throat swelled up.
“Sam and the other guys from your lab got to The Bunker,” Dean murmurs, the shadows hanging in the air almost spelling out his words in the dark.
Dean reached over for one of the couch pillows—easily lopping it at his son’s head. “No promises.”
“Hmmm, well…” She stops abruptly, as she catches sight of a pretty brown-haired woman in her 20s. “Hannah! Hannah!” she calls. “My granddaughter,” she offers in explanation. “Came over for dinner last night. Maybe she’ll remember something.”
If I was eighty years old and had one of those medical alert necklace things, that would have been enough to get me hitting my panic button. “Uh, that seems a little claustrophobic to me. What about right here?” I say, gesturing to the set of two armchairs in the library and then, answering my own question, I scramble into one—denim squeaking over leather.
He climbs into the bed. There are too many blankets. The top one is scratchy, with a swirling pattern made of stitches that he traces with his finger. He’s only ever had a sheet. The pillows are so soft that they curve up to completely cover his ears when he rests his head on them.

And as he heard the wheels turn a little faster in Gabriel’s head the longer that he kept on talking, Castiel almost felt bad for the Brit. Almost.

I silently ask Cas to start work on some onions while it browns. Unthinkingly, he moves the cutting board further away from me—‘cause he knows my eyes will turn red like I just watched Lassie die if the juice gets on me—and I flash a small smile in gratitude.

Dean’s sense of relief changes colors almost instantly at Cas’s careful tone. “Why do you sound like that?” he asks, confused.
“I would like to eat with you and Dean.”
All in all, there was a carefully maintained balance between the modern and the rustic, and Castiel

“No, I…” Dean’s voice sped up. “Plant’s got a voice that can shatter glass, but in a way that feels… holy almost. And Page plays the guitar like he’s possessed.

Dad said—said the only reason Mom ever gave him her number in the first place is because he knew all the lyrics to
“We haven’t discussed how much you want to tell them about the future—I knew you would want to wait for Sam, at least,” Castiel says in a low rush. “And up to this point, I assumed that if you two decided to keep the timeline intact, I could erase their memories before we sent them back to 2008. But now…”
But then he sees Brady, face pressed against a white linen tablecloth, hair in his souffle, and his hands being cuffed behind his back—and he reluctantly stows his gun if not his anger.

Dean has, he puts his headphones on. They’re large—covering both of his ears entirely—a non-verbal statement of just how much he wants to shut out the world.
“Just need to get a rhythm is all,” the slightly taller man winked, hands falling to Cas’s waist as he encouraged them to jump together.
“We know who she is,” Sam insists.
He crossed his arms over his chest. “Cassie’s the only person in my family who I give a shit about. But he’s always been an island. Not on purpose,” he added. “He’s just

“Dean kinda hates it when Cas leaves—but he won’t ever
“Dean?” Lisa prompted, and it took him a minute to mentally rewind and figure out what she might be asking him.
He sighs. “I get it, man,” he says, scrubbing his eyes in sudden tiredness. “I mean, I hope, by this point, we’ve learned that when shit goes down, we gotta loop each other in. But I say that knowing I’ve unscrewed a few light bulbs trying to keep you and Sammy in the dark before. So…” He sets another empty beer bottle on his bedside table, next to two photos he has framed.
“Able to access any of his files?”
“No, it wasn’t. It wasn’t funny at all, but I laughed anyway—”
“Dean!” Lisa gasped, sinking down on him further as he strained his thigh muscles to meet her halfway. That was one thing against memory foam—didn’t exactly have—

Dean excused himself to go call Ben and Cas felt all of the nervous excitement that had been running through him in full force now that he didn’t have the actor’s presence to distract him.
Not for the first time, Castiel felt the strange combination of warmed and annoyed that came with having a soulmate who picked up on these kinds of things now.
As soon as they heard her footsteps retreating, Dean gave Cas an up and down look. “Think we can get off in five minutes?”
“And she’s got red hair. Let me take a wild guess. She's also wicked smart with a computer, and will knife anyone who suggests watching the prequel Star Wars movies as a flashback in-between
do you know about that?”
“Why not?”
She considered this, hands folding together in front of her on top of the kitchen island. “You know I’ve never judged you for keeping quiet, right?” she questioned with big, green eyes. “Everyone deserves to come out of the closet at their own pace.”
OK, Two days later than I said, but that's not too bad, I hope.
It was terrible irony, really—how easily they could understand each other sometimes without speaking. And how equally often they could misunderstand each other even when they talked. “I want you—that—all of it,” Cas promised. And then, because Dean didn’t look convinced. “I want every hectic Thursday afternoon and lazy Sunday morning that you’ll give me. I want to know what chores you insist on doing right away and which ones you let sit. I want to know Ben’s favorite kind of ice cream and how he’s doing in karate. Everything I don’t know yet, I want to, Dean. I want you in my life as much as you want to be there.”
“I’ll wager it all,” he responds after only a second—jumping only slightly when Ash stirs and says, “Right on, Man!” Alfie fist bumps him.

It was a simple statement—nothing world-changing and perhaps not even true. And yet, for some reason, it lingered in his brain even after Dean had tucked himself in. His dad might have had dark hair. His dad might have had dark hair like

There was a link to an article attached, but Castiel ignored it in favor of reading Charlie’s only remaining text message—which was actually the first one that she sent.
He knew better than to push it, though. They’d been in a weird place since his talk with Pamela on Monday.

Dean groaned, “That was so lame, Dude.”
“Sorry to interrupt all the boy gossip,” Charlie cut through the general hubbub. (She didn’t seem sorry at all.) “But I thought you should know… the posts just went live.”
there’s been big changes going on with you. I mean, you’re going public with something that you’ve only told—what? A dozen people? And I had no idea. Considering we share a home and raise a kid together, I think I have a right to know where your head is at.”
“And why would I do that when I could wait for Castiel right here?”

And yet, when he glances over during the first car chase scene, it is to see Dean’s arm back around Cas’s shoulder.

“What? He thinks she’s trying to get in your pants, too?”
The corner of Cas’s lips quirk up. “Thank you, Dean. Although I’ll remind you, I’m actually a wavelength of celestial intent.”

“Well, good. Because that would have been really stupid of you. The two of them split up a looong time ago. Like Dean was rocking surfer bro highlights, it’s been so long. Not to mention, they’ve both got soulmates they’re crazy about.”
His stomach growled.

“Don’t know?” Anna prods him.

Even if they were the most basic butterflies ever, it’s gotta beat unleashing angry squirrels into the world. Do you know how much damage those motherfuckers do to cars? Not to mention gutters?”
“The same as you, I suppose. The little things. Driving around in the Impala, listening to you and Sam argue about what’s on the radio. Watching movies together. I used to enjoy visiting your dreams—the peaceful ones, like fishing by the lake. Of course, I understand now that that was an invasion of privacy.”
I can understand why Lisa would want to hang you out to dry. Kind of a huge decision to make without her. And then not loop her in on.”
“OK then…” the youngest Winchester sounds disappointed, but determined. His face is lit from below by the glow of the screen. “Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die?”
“And…just like that, you went from being my celebrity crush to one half of the kind of gross couple that makes me want to throw up in my mouth a little bit,” Anna announces, arms crossed.
“Yeah. I mean, I’m gonna call him before bed—do our little ritual. But Lisa and I have each been away for months at a time for shoots, so he’s used to this, to some extent.”
“Like what?”
Dean set his fork down a bit louder than he intended to, suddenly not hungry anymore. He looked up to find Lisa moving her eggs around rather than eating them, so he supposed that made two of them.
He heard Lisa explain all this—before abruptly deciding that he couldn’t listen anymore. But
“How about you?” Dean asked, slowing down to match his pace better. "S’there any promotional stuff you gotta do for your book?”
“You’ve made it very clear to the public how you feel about finding your match,” Castiel argued over Dean’s scoff. “When you came in for the Michael auditions, I was shocked. I didn’t know
“Fine. Uh, organic, I guess. If it bleeds, it means you can kill it.”
“But, at the end of the day, I’m still
“Then there’s your justification.”
His breath turned shallow, each one stabbing at his ribs like a knife. “I’m—I’m trying,” he whispered, hating his voice—and himself—for the way the words cracked down the middle.
"Clearly, the universe had orchestrated their meeting. Who was to say that anything he felt about Dean was genuine?" - Dean's and Cas's arguments about Chuck from late Season 14 into Season 15, but flipped so that Cas is asking "What is real?"

“True. But there is no one I’d rather spend time with. Additionally, most humans wouldn’t understand why I would invite someone to a meal and then not eat any of the food myself,” he adds, as an afterthought.

“Dean…” his brother says, cautiously. “
Castiel’s frown deepens. He pulls his phone out again, looking from Dean's four hours old message to Meg as he weighs his options.
“About?”
—” He pressed another key and a second picture appeared slightly below the first. It was Castiel and the Winchesters the same day at a dim sum restaurant. Dean had forgone the use of chopsticks to eat his pork bun with his hands—and in this photo, his cheeks were stuffed full. Meanwhile, Cas looked on in amusement and Sam shook his head in reproach.
Castiel wiped crumbs off the side of his mouth with his hand and shrugged. “I can’t tell him what I don’t know myself. The original novel was meant to be a standalone. I’m still… formulating what comes next.” He knew this was something that he should worry about—
they talking about it? The big ‘it.’ The elephant in the room wearing a party hat and roller skates, demanding to be acknowledged.
Other Me bites off a curse. “OK, I’ll try to take care of that.”
So, Cas did the best he could—going back to the very first day at the auditions and how blindsided he’d been by Dean’s presence, all the times he’d thought about telling Dean the truth only to back out, Gabe’s constant prodding….

“Knows me pretty well. I mean, we go all the way back to high school—the third high school I attended, that is. So, when I got big, I asked her to run that stuff for me,” he explained. The two of them slipped through the door Sam had patiently been holding open and into the air conditioning of the mall, where they were instantly assaulted by the smell of Chinese food and lemon-scented cleaning solution.
"In the distance he could see Sears Tower, where he once stood on the 110th floor, feeling almost celestially tall as he watched the oblivious people shuffling on the sidewalk below." - Due to the setting, I couldn't use the Chrysler building, but this was still a little hint about Cas's true form being that large, referenced in "Family Matters" (6x7)

The youngest Winchester takes a deep breath. “When we were planning for me to jump into the Pit, I asked you to stay with Lisa because I thought, deep down, that was what you wanted. What would make you happy. I think you thought that too. But reading about that time, I can tell you weren’t.”
And why was Dean looking at him like that? As if he was waiting for—something?

“So, your attempt to grant me freedom involves taking me somewhere against my will?” he snaps back—and Dean is surprised by that—the sensation rippling out from him like waves in a pond after a pebble has been dropped in.

It had been a Thursday afternoon last September when he first saw Fergus MacLeod’s name in his inbox. “Send me 100 more pages,” was all it had said, and yet, Castiel stared at those five words blankly for an hour—unconvinced they were real. After the failure of his first novel and a dozen rejections for his second, he had been slowly sinking into a depression that caused him to sleep more than usual—and to spend his waking hours planted in front of Netflix rather than doing his homework. He’d reread his first ten pages—all that you could send with your query—a dozen times, desperate to figure out what was wrong with them.

“It’s a means of connecting to your family,” Castiel thought out-loud, unable to picture talking to his mother about something so… personal as the kind of music they liked. Speaking of... “You can tell me when I’m overstepping,” he informed Dean’s sun-and-shadow profile. “I won’t get offended.”
“I worry that if he learns—or even suspects—the nature of our current relationship, he will actively try to take a different path.”
“To be honest, the one time Dean and Sam took me out, I was back in the Impala reading a book with a flashlight after the first 30 minutes. But they just stood there—for four or five hours, maybe. Never spoke a word to each other,” she told Castiel.
“Whoever it is probably got their soulmark at the same time, right? We can put up an announcement on social media and--” Charlie catches the look on his face. “No, you’re right, that would be--”

“I had a lot of studying to do for finals,” he reminded her, flicking the tassel of his graduation cap out of his face.
“Popcorn!” Sam announces, plopping a bowl directly on his brother’s lap.
“Gabriel Shurley.”
“Dean!” Cas sounded so excited that the actor couldn’t help but chuckle a little. “Dean, I did it.”
“Oh, I’m sorry, Marty McFly.”
Castiel remembered IKEA, noting that while Dean’s behavior had irritated him at the time, it brought him a sort of comfort now. He made a noise of agreement, prying the plastic lid off his container of noodles.
They’d had lunch on the road earlier, but for dinner, Dean found an out-of-the-way diner that looked like it was definitely a Ponderosa at some point.
“It would hardly be the most unlikely thing to happen to you, now would it, Squirrel?” Crowley argues. “Trust me, I want to have as little interaction with those Queen-and-country arseholes as possible. And so should you.”
“I’m not going to keep the rest from him, Charlie,” Castiel promised sadly. After all, it was one thing to maintain his secret when the only person it meant hurting was himself. It was another to leave Dean in the dark with the current threat looming over their heads. “However, I’d prefer to do so in person.”
“There’re also probably a perfectly good reason why he’s always trying to set you up, but then gets tense if he thinks you show any interest back. It’s likely the same reason he hated it when you hung out with other angels. Because, deep down, he’s worried that the people he cares about are gonna leave him. ‘Course, that doesn’t fully explain why he got upset that time I tried to teach you pool—but you guys are best friends, and he can get a little—possessive—of that.”
“Yeah, uh, guess all this pudding talk is making me hungry,” Dean states the obvious, scratching the back of his neck. They’re only a few blocks away from the mess hall. “What about you? In the mood for lunch?”
Thank God for Sam, who chose that moment to grab Dean’s attention by snickering at a large cutout of Red Hood propped against the Hot Topic window. It gave Castiel a moment to think over Dean’s words, decide he had absolutely no idea what to do about them, and shove them firmly into a back corner of his mind for later.
I see the chill that runs through his spine, even though he tries to hide it.
“Sure. As long as it doesn’t have caffeine in it,” Cas clarifies.
Another pause, but he decided to wait it out this time.
Dean decides, his soulmark tingling with a rare case of nerves.
Dean let out a breath, his forehead slumping forward until it was pressed to the side of Cas’s neck. “Well, thanks for that. I hope you weren’t planning on growing old with me because I think you shaved a good few years off my life. Let me… uh…” Dean pushed him away slightly so that he could make his way over to the bed.
They waited until his bootsteps faded into the distance before Lisa spoke up again. “Frankly, I’m tempted to lock him in there,” she murmured.

“Yeah, Jack," Dean responds, leaning over to ruffle his hair. "I’ll play too.”

he needed someone to talk to.
“Do you think you or Mom s’gonna be the one to teach me to drive?” he spoke up as someone on a scooter passed them.
Now Sam—Sam had fucked everything up.
The wildlife all get much louder in his absence, like they were waiting for the excuse to start gossiping.
In fact, Lisa had scrapbooks and scrapbooks, documenting Ben’s first step, first word, first time eating solid food. Both he and Ben made fun of her for it but, honestly, Dean was grateful—that he got a chance to catch up on those early years that he hadn’t been around for.
If Cas is his soulmate, that’s great—that’s awesome. And if not—well, it’s better to know now.
Ten minutes later, Charlie called Cas back.
I think of the lie I prepared before closing the inches between us—that I was playing the role that he’d assigned me. There was no reason to take it that far, of course, but giving him a guileless look and an “I don’t understand you humans” would probably get me out of it without too many consequences.
Sam reaches up for the paper towel Dean had set out to use as napkin, tearing off a corner. “I mean, that was the last one that got published, yeah, but when we saw Chuck last year, I—I tried to ask him a few questions and He—He gave me copies of all the unpublished ones…up through when Dean got rid of the Mark of Cain.”
“Nuh-uh,” Sam responds, shaking his head like a goddamn shampoo commercial. “This is supposed to be about you guys.”
“Who’s that?” Castiel demands, shakily, at the same time Dean yells, “What the
“Then, there was all the anti-slander clauses…”
“And all that sucks. But,” he shrugs. “They feel like out there problems. Like Future Dean problems. Nothing’s really pressing on me at the moment.” In fact, right here, right now with Cas, knowing Sam’s safe down the hall probably mooning over his not-girlfriend, he feels about as happy as he’s ever been.
“Dean,” Cas insisted, stepping closer and grabbing his shoulder. “I don’t mind that they were more interested in you than my book. They haven’t read
“Among the many lines they won’t cross is making any sort of alliance with questionable characters—and as hunters who have been known to befriend the odd vampire or werewolf—or King of Hell—I doubt this Mick wants to work with you so much as figure out whether or not they need to kill you.”
Their first date is almost entirely a disaster. They go to a diner and barely talk around their food so that when the waitress comes and asks if they want dessert, Dean actually passes on
Dean nodded. “A week ago. Before you…. Before our stuff even happened.”
Both Sam and Lisa asked him something, but he waved them off, hunching as much as possible to avoid being recognized by any of the restaurant’s other patrons as he walked through the main dining room and out the entrance doors.
She turns back to me, fists tight with accusation. “You didn’t go to Heaven….You…You ran away to live with
Dean makes him question it, though. “
you, which—sorry my dude, not my place.
But it has been almost twenty years. She can’t expect to know what he’s like now when she never really had an idea who he was then.
Dean doesn’t know what to say to that, so he jokes, reflexively. “Well, Gabriel killed me over a hundred times once. Maybe you two should have started a club.”
“I’ll take care of Bobby. You go--” Castiel says, turning his trenchcoated back to me. I have my door opened within the second, almost spilling out of the car, having underestimated how healed “healed” meant. It wasn’t just the cut on my head that had disappeared—or the likely bruised ribs I had. The ache in my knee and the twinge in my back I’ve had since crawling out of my own grave are gone. Hell, I feel
Dean cleared his throat, sending vibrations through Cas’s own chest and causing the hardness in his pants to brush against Cas’s. The author closed his eyes automatically. “Right… Yeah. Just… give me a minute.”
“No,” Cas responds, sounding surprisingly sure of that. “It’s likely this particular moment just wasn’t important to you.”
“Well, that’s a cliché. I wonder if being a cheater is necessary experience for that job,” Dean snorts, flipping through the menu. Sam doesn’t even know what the point of his brother’s browsing is—he’s just going to order a burger and fries anyway.
Dean rolled his eyes.
It’s interesting to watch the play of emotions that go over Dean’s face—starting at annoyance, turning to slight disbelief, and then—there it is, his cheeks have started to turn red, the color moving swiftly towards his ears. “She filmed you for three minutes and 41 seconds before she got bored. I’ve thought about deleting it a hundred times, just because it takes up so much storage space, but then it was kinda useful for explaining things to Mom—and Garth thought it was funny, so….” Sam trails off, realizing he might have said too much.
“Cas?” Dean eventually asked once the quiet had had time to fully settle into their bones.
“Dean,” she says in a friendly voice, sliding into the seat across from him.
go spreading that around, alright?” he practically ordered his brother.
15 minutes later, they’ve commandeered the left-hand side of a table meant for six. Dean convinced Cas to get a burger, too, on the basis that he’d eat whatever Cas didn’t—but judging by the way that the dark-haired man’s going to town on his sandwich, he figures that they probably should’ve gotten three.
“Not a lot. There’s just always been a weird…you know,
“So, you’re Cas,” the man who must have been Sam Winchester greeted. He turned halfway in his seat to offer the author a handshake, just as Dean drove over a pothole that sent the whole car lurching a little bit. “Is that short for something? Dean didn’t say.”
“Oh, that boy is going to be in

two feet between him and Cas. Instinctively, he shot a look at his brother, only to notice that Gabe and Sam had stopped talking, as if they, too, were watching the scene play out.

that, if you honestly think you can help. But Dean’s probably still waiting for us to call back and—I’m not prepared to talk to him right now.”
And then, in another in a long string of surprises this afternoon, he drives the car in front of me, pulls over onto the grassy strip beside the road, and parks.
Dean’s a tall man. It wasn’t so obvious when he was next to Sam, but he is… tall and broad-shouldered. And the confines of their two-bed motel room quickly become too small for him. He paces; he does stuff on his computer. After showing them the TV remote, he kicks Castiel over to share a bed with Hannah and Samandriel and takes quick naps. Then, he wakes up and paces again.
“What? You knew the vic, had access to his personal information, and I’ve recently got word of blonde hair found at the crime scene.” Which is what Kevin had been calling about earlier that afternoon. This coincided with April’s description of a blonde man hovering around Cas’s house in the days leading up to the kidnapping.
Dean’s face worked through several emotions in the space of a few seconds. “Yeah, I’m gonna need more than that,” he said when he wrestled his expression back into something as neutral as possible.
“So, these digs OK? I can get you some of my clothes, too. Figure we’re the same size-ish.”
after they decided to switch to air hockey. Dean’s eyes narrowed down to slits and Cas rolled his shirt sleeves up, prepared to defend his goal at all costs. On occasion, this meant that the puck went flying across the room—and once, it rebounded off one of the racer machines, but both of them continued to fight harder the sweatier they got. In the end, they eventually had to concede the table to a twelve-year-old and his brother, whose mother eyed them suspiciously as they sped-walked out of the arcade.
Castiel had a suspicion that a certain blonde actress might be a factor in his change of heart. “If your brother were here, he’d say that just means you were weird before and now you’re normal.”

Whatever else he was feeling, Dean settles on anger pretty quickly after that. “You’re telling me that
And yet, despite his clear and repeated shutdowns, the crowd only seemed to take
The Dean in his head snorted at the ‘rubbing off on’ part—but Cas knew better than to relay that out loud. “I’m still very much me—and I don’t think that I’ve changed Dean’s behavior much at all.”
And maybe they’d stay friends—but then what? They’d graduate college, slowly drift apart—and, one day, Cas would meet his soulmate, his

“That’s adorable.”
“Yeah, Cas doesn’t seem to like him that much either. I mean, he respects him, but his grace pulls in tight when he’s around—like it’s trying to stay away.”
“I’ve never had something this wonderful before,” Castiel says honestly.
“Then, I suppose

He shrugged his arm off her shoulder. “Yeah, fine,” he murmured, but he was looking at Sam and Jess again and the fact that they seemed so in sync now took on a slightly creepy edge.
sound pressing,” Balthazar said, voice droll, as Castiel managed to get his arm away.
Dean accepts this with a nod, noting the dark circles under her eyes, only somewhat hidden by too much makeup. “You know Cas then?”
“Lisa?”
Maybe, it was the whole Uriel memory that triggered it—or Sam bringing up shit at the bar last week—or who knows, maybe it was back when Cas broke out of a brainwashing trance and wouldn’t explain how he did it—but it was there. The knowledge that that ball was gonna drop someday.

ed. Then quickly proceeded to shut his door again.
The angel hesitates, but nods, “Yes, of course.”
When I wake up, it is to the low murmur of voices. Now, I know these future boys haven’t been telling me everything—and without the knowledge that they have at their disposal, I just have to assume it’s for a good reason—so I ain’t been pushing it. But it’s a stupid hunter—and probably a soon-to-be-dead one—who closes his ears when there’s whispering going on—so I instinctively make sure my breathing stays even so as to not startle them into silence.
think that, no matter what, you and Dean are going to be in each other’s lives. He’s more… himself when he’s with you. And he’d be less of himself without you. No one who knows him and cares about him can be immune to that.”
“He does,” a familiar voice says from behind him.

“I’ll be seeing you in person soon, Deano. Got a 2 o’clock flight. Even if I can do fuck all to help Cassie, I can at least be there for Anna.”

“That being said…I always assumed that part of the reason you don’t like letting people in—the reason you hide things from even Sam—is because you’re worried if he knew, he’d look at you differently. But as it turns out, he does know—and it’s clear that you are the same person to him that you’ve always been.”
“Take a picture. It’ll last longer.”
Castiel wakes up clutching his head. His throat is scraped raw, like he’s been screaming, but all he can hear is a whine between his ears. His nails scrape against his scalp—tearing hair, drawing blood. He doesn’t notice. He needs the noise to
“I did say it was stupid,” the actor followed up reflexively.
pointed out that saying ‘No offense’ after saying something offensive does not negate the offense given,” Cas grumbled. “I believe this operates under similar principles.”
“That still doesn’t mean she was trying to flirt with me.” He thought again about the offer to have lunch together and decided not to mention it. “
Soon enough, Dean was helping Castiel into his reflective vest and tightening the belt holding the hip holster for his laser gun in place, while Castiel remained resolutely still. “Feel OK?” Dean asked, two fingers under the strap around his shoulder.
,” Castiel threatened. “Explain. Please.”
“This guy’s the vic,” Benny says, pointing to the first man. “So far, we got no next of kin to talk to. Figure if we can track these two down, we might learn something.”
“So,” Sam interrupted their staring contest, obviously feeling the tension but not understanding it. “I think Dean’s plan was to watch Christmas movies and pig out for the afternoon.”
yeah!
She didn’t seem to mind—or maybe didn’t notice the subtle redirect.
“Come on, we’ll explain in the hall,” my older self promises, gesturing for me to follow him out.
Not an angel, not a demon—a human?” he asks Castiel.

He looks at me then, really
“It’s stupid but… you know if you live with him, he’s gonna overhear us doin’ it, right?” Dean spoke up, unexpectedly. “Or see us, like, cuddling on the couch or some shit? That’s probably
Dean reached the end of the room before he began pacing in the opposite direction. “Okay, time to add a new word to your vocabulary.”
“Thanks…for watching over him. I doubt he tells you enough,” he mentions, instead.
“Okay, well, uh, I guess that’s all I called to say. That and I’m sorry.”
Castiel nodded and pressed the play button again.
Dean’s gaze snapped back to Cas’s face like a rubber band. “Woah, woah, woah. I wasn’t… I didn’t….” His struggle for words was clear across his face. “C’mere,” he murmured at last, looping one finger into Cas’s belt loops, and tugging him closer. The author probably could have stopped himself from being moved, but instead, he let himself fall into Dean’s chest, recently washed hands pressing wet handprints to the back of Dean’s shirt.
The author just raised one eyebrow challengingly, kneeling over the laptop.
had grown up as a government hostage, you would have been very well adjusted,” he remarks, dryly.
“Let me guess, you’re the kind of guy who also smacks your TV to make it work better? Punching your lights out ain’t gonna solve anything.”
Eventually, Sam’s shoulders slumped, bringing him down from his full 6’4” height to a barely-more respectable 6’3”. “You’re right.”
“A little bit, yeah.”
Back when they were living together, he had given her and Ben as much attention as he could—she knew that and was grateful for it. But it also makes her appreciate her current life so much more—the way her husband looks at her in her little black dress like she’s all he can see.
“Oh my god, you’re
Miriam speaks up this time. “He didn’t like Lilith from the homeowners’ association because she told him he couldn’t keep bees, but that can’t possibly have anything to do with this, right?”
“Hmmm,” Naomi repeated, even though she should be the first person to respect someone for caring for a child that was not biologically their own.
He gestured Castiel inside a large, all-white room, partially filled with people. Three long desks were arranged to form a U-shape. “Over there in the corner is Chuck, our head scriptwriter. Best not to make too many loud noises. I’m never quite sure if he acts the way he does because he’s shy or hungover—but we want to avoid sending him into any fits.”
Following his visit to Dean’s house, Castiel threw himself into his next book with the fervor of a cat trying to escape a bathtub.

” she hisses, static causing her red hair to halo around her face.
Castiel glanced up at the balloon with Gabriel’s face on it as he paced around his living room.
“Thank fuck!” Dean exclaims, but with a genuine grin at the end. “Now…can we please move this conversation along?”
“Yes, well, it looks good on you. Brings out your eyes,” Dean promised with a flutter of his own eyelashes.
“Yeah, right.” Meg laughs, darkly, the sound like two glasses of dark red wine
Sam pointedly lets Dean field this one.
“Sorry, sorry, Man…” Dean concluded. “I—”
Castiel tried to think it through logically. There was evidence to suggest that Dean did, indeed, enjoy his company—the half a dozen meals shared together, some genuine smiles.
Sam was in the lead—Gabriel and Jessica both checking out his ass from a few steps behind. “Did
For example, Dean knew without a doubt that last night’s nightmare—of flames licking up his bedroom walls—was based on his own distorted memories of a long-ago house fire that left his mom with some pretty gnarly burns along her left arm. But the feeling of wings suddenly sprouting from his back, taking him away from the blaze—that

Dean’s breath ghosted across the line again “Again, it’s not a big deal. I just… wonder sometimes if you might… regret… never getting the chance to play the field a bit more.
“So, why the career change?” Dean asked a minute later as if sensing Castiel’s thoughts starting to wander. “You just like writing better or what?”

“Says the man who has no problem referencing my father when we’re--”
Castiel tilted his chin up slightly until Dean seemed to get the message and leaned down to kiss him again. “Better?” the actor asked, smirking, when he pulled away, Cas’s hands still grasping both of Dean’s arms at the elbows.
“You know… Actor,” Dean scrubbed the back of his head. “Gotta watch the weight. Can’t have too much sugar. It

you?” Dean demands—and that stops Castiel short. “Seriously—you—and the tickin’ time bomb back there,” he jerks his thumb at the backseat, where Samandriel is once again blissed out, “Have got no control over your powers. At all.”
“I would also choose organic—but only because I feel like intelligent life without the capability of emotion is an inherently more terrifying prospect than encountering a feeling species.”
“I… think that’s something I should ask him about later. Once I’ve had more of a chance to prove myself.”
the door is open,” Sam corrects.
Cas’s jaw worked side to side, back molars grinding.
“Cas…” Dean croaked after a moment. “Just to clarify…. Are you breaking up with me or not?”
And if there was something he’d noticed—and been jealous of—regarding Dean’s relationship with Lisa, it was the frequent, casual touches they exchanged. Maybe that spoke less about who

Castiel pulled back—just so he could track every flicker of emotion across the actor’s face. “
Dean wipes his sweaty hands on his jeans. “You say you have--” he makes a vague gesture in the air between them.
“I don’t even know where we’re headed,” Dean admitted several minutes—and miles—later, once they’d left the studio lot behind them. “Whatcha in the mood for? Burgers? Italian? Mexican and spying on Sammy?”
“12 minutes left!” Jess announced a few moments later after they had that problem solved.
“They must think it’s important,” Cas counters, examining him closely—and Dean’s got to admit, this is probably harder for the angel to answer—considering he’s already admitted to all the emotional stuff. Dean’s only blabbered about spiders and said that Cas is a badass fighter.
Castiel had figured that out already, and he reached over to smooth the lines of tension on his boyfriend’s forehead even as Dean looked at him helplessly.
“People see the Devil everywhere.”
Castiel couldn’t have heard correctly.
“Wait,” Dean snapped his fingers, and Castiel tensed again. “Did you ever get a car?”
“Dean. Winchester,” he added belatedly—and then immediately felt stupid for doing so. He couldn’t even remember the last time that he’d had to introduce himself by name to someone—and didn’t
“It’s, uh,” Dean’s cheeks turn pink with embarrassment. “Cas only ever touches my left shoulder. Don’t think he even realizes he does it, but it’s—the one he left his handprint on when he raised me from hell. Last time he touched my right shoulder, it turned out he was possessed by Lucifer, so I just promised myself I’d pay better attention if it happened again.”
Just wanted to say thank you for the continued support for this story! I started 2020 with 167 kudos across all my stories, and now this one alone is over 1200. The support I've gotten here has really been the best thing about this year for me. Wishing everyone a happy and healthy 2021!
Dean points a finger at him—though not the middle one. “I will dye your hair green in your sleep—don’t think I won’t.”
“What
Cas smiled at him again—a real one this time—in the way that transformed his whole face, and Dean felt his last traces of anxiety disappear. The launch hadn’t changed anything between them.
Castiel’s natural instinct was to retreat from the attention, but his new agent, Billie, insisted on capitalizing on the press.
“Hey,” Dean called, drawing Cas’s attention to his eyes again. “I didn’t mean it like a
“Depends,” Dean shot right back. “You didn’t happen to buy into some tabloid crap about me getting married, did you?”
Castiel felt the weight of several stares all examining him closely. “Even if that is true…” he said slowly. “Crowley could just claim he didn’t sign anything. There’s no proof. It would just be our word against his.”
“Dean,” he said quietly. “I would never be upset at you for… feeling self-conscious, especially about something as personal as your sexuality. I know that you think I’m immune to that sort of thing….”
you—and that’s not my kind of thing.
“Well, I did once propose getting a cat….” Cas mentions, voice tipping towards a question.
“How about a visual presentation?” his cousin offered before dramatically punching his keyboard with his index finger. Up popped an image of—(Castiel felt his blood freeze)—of himself, Sam, and Dean emerging from the laser tag place. They all had smiles on their faces, but weirdly enough, he was most transfixed by his own.
Sam walks into the library—and instantly wishes he hadn’t. Dean and Cas are standing on the opposite end of the room less than two feet apart—eyes roaming the other’s face like helicopter searchlights, looking for…
“Think I could be your copilot for a bit, Buddy?” Dean asks, gesturing to a nearby spot on the floor.
“Hold up a second—” Dean’s voice was a little thin like it had been run through a strainer. “When you say you’re not used to kissing someone, you just mean it’s been
“I--” he tries, already choking on that one word.
“Or you could just wear gloves,” the angel points out, rising also with much less noise.
“I would think he’s concerned that Chelsea doesn’t feel the same way about him—and that bringing it up would jeopardize their friendship,” Cas responds, looking down as he plays with the zipper on his hoodie.
Two hours later, Dean was drying off his hair after some laps in the pool when—“Son of a bitch!” he exclaimed when he got his head out of the towel only to find himself face-to-face with Gabriel.
—and maybe if he doesn’t acknowledge them, they will go away and take their feelings with him.
“Dean?” Sam’s voice calls from the other side of the lobby. Dean makes a face of apology to the secretary he had been talking to in order to face his brother. This is why he never buys lottery tickets—he has the worst luck of anyone who isn’t dead or ugly. “What are you doing here? You coulda just called me back.”
“What?” he asks, innocently. “It’s the truth! Chuck even got some you goo in his hair the first time.”
“The book?”

, give yourself a break. Regroup, write something different, take long walks on the beach—whatever you need to get your mind off it—and
Apparently, some amount of brotherly telepathy still worked though, as Sam whipped his puppy dog eyes out for the second time that day. “I’m glad I caught you. I really wanted to apologize for—”
“Are you…?” The words slip out of me in surprise. But I know better than to use the term ‘jealous’, so I quickly change tactics. “I would have stayed if you asked me to, too. You didn’t ask. You just told me I’d get myself killed going after Lucifer on my own.”
“Then what brings you to my neck of the woods?” she prompts, just as the door of the diner shakes with bells announcing a new arrival.
about him. More than he cared about most people in his life. Enough to see something and to mentally file it away to tell Dean later. Enough to miss him when he wasn’t there. And when, exactly, had he gone from fearing getting too close to Dean to being scared that one day, he’d lose the closeness that they had built?
Dean quickly pulls up the location of the restaurant on his phone and sees that it is about 25 minutes away. Trying to storm Brady in the middle of a crowd full of diners isn’t likely a good idea though. “When are you going to be finished eating?”
“You guys share clothes—”
“Hmmm, well it’s definitely a compelling story.” It was a ghost story within a ghost story in a lot of ways. The main character had passed about six months before—and though his tone was nonchalant, it spoke to an existential crisis brewing just underneath the surface. He was clearly struggling to accept that the afterlife was nothing more than wandering around the world invisibly, not being able to interact with anyone or anything except his fellow ghosts. And then, his friends started slowly disappearing.
“I already made that decision for myself, if you recall.”
“I…am a fan of his,” he murmurs, his blush returning.
“I’ve been… unwell… the last few days,” he explained, as icons started popping up like flowers on his desktop display.
A flick to the back of my head has me jolting upright, but then I see it is only younger Dean, looking at me with a lazy smile.
“I’m not really sure,” Castiel admitted. College had been good for him in so many ways. It was one thing to think that you could do it—live on your own and do your own grocery shopping, make your own problems and then fix them—and entirely another to have four years of proof under your belt.
of all things? Or… did she not know that you, er…?”
“Are Dean’s soulmate, yes,” he repeated.
“You like Scooby-Doo,” Castiel pointed out, as a redheaded CSI approached the partially collapsed building.
“That sounds… complete.”
” crooned from the speakers.
“Oh.” That was kind of nice. He was more used to being recognized because of Dean. “I’m glad you enjoyed it.”
“I wish I had someone I could complain about you to,” the angel lets out in one determined breath.
“Charlie,” he growled a warning, feeling very close to the end of his usually long-lasting patience.
“I have. But I haven’t come up with an answer. I don’t think it’s something I can know for sure until it happens. My life turned into something completely different from the moment I was assigned to rescue the soul named Dean Winchester from Hell. Chuck brought me back—more times than I can count—to be here for
“Cas?” I ask, confused, but then realize he might not yet recognize the nickname. “Castiel?”
That seemed like a negligible distinction to Cas, but he figured that everyone was allowed their own self-denials.
Easter eggs/references:
Sam ignored him. “Just—ask yourself this. Would you rather spend Sunday morning having breakfast with Cas or Lisa?”
Dean snorted. “I can
Automatically, my hand comes out to squeeze his shoulder. I press my thumb into the muscle just a little. He tilts his head slightly, a familiar gesture, but this time, it causes the bottom of his cheek to rest against my hand. My face flushes.
“Considering the disadvantage my mere British-ness is putting me at,” he says with forced carelessness, “I can only ask that you give us the opportunity to let our future actions speak louder than words. My number,” he states, pressing a business card into Castiel’s hands. “Feel free to call me if you need assistance on a case. We might ask the same. After all, with all the resources the Men of Letters has at our disposal, we haven’t had much opportunity to converse with a friendly angel. I’ll admit to being very curious.”
I open my mouth to say—something—when a coffee is set in front of me, another in front of Bobby, and a third at Dean’s empty seat. I pick it up and sip from it automatically—only realizing after the first taste that we never told the angel our order, but he seems to have known it anyway.
He slid the phone over to her—watched as she scanned over the messages.
“Not as good as it
“So, what about you, Cas? What do
Besides that, there are some common themes—animals, running, feeling trapped. It makes him kinda sad for his other half, honestly.
Cas knew that what he felt for them wasn’t quite as intense as the way he cared for Dean—which made sense, considering the near-impossible scope of the latter—but at that moment, he couldn’t help but think that he loved them both very, very much.
“Next question, please, Sam,” Cas begs, while Dean starts humming under his breath.
The Dead coming back to life. Karen, humming, while making an endless series of pies, not yet realizing that Bobby was going to have to shoot her again. Little Owen covered in his father’s blood. “No,” I croak. “No, I really don’t want to either.”

last week, along with a couple of memory foam pillows, some towels, and a new toilet seat—because fuck trying to get the old one clean.
“You’ve heard of the Nobel prizes, I presume,” Cas told Dean, voice low on the other end of the phone to avoid disturbing Gabriel. “There are also comparable awards known as the Ig Nobel prizes. They’re for research that’s a bit—unorthodox—even laughable at first glance. And instead of clapping, audience members throw paper airplanes at the recipients. However, the studies that win all have real merit.”
Sam’s laugh is short, hard, and sympathetic. “Oh,
are going to talk to your best friends about the social media shitstorm—and if you guys think of something that I can do to help with that, you let know at dinner, okay?”
“Dean.” And,
“So, let me get this straight,” Hannah says, slowly. “
“In a few months, yes. He’s apparently been thinking about it more and more recently. His current operations in the Midwest mostly run themselves, he’s getting bored, and wants to expand. Possibly venture into designing his own escape rooms.”
“Please don’t take it in a bad way--”
I close my eyes. The blackness behind my closed lids seems to teem with unseen colors—oil slick blues and greens and purples like my wings.
Meg pauses in her texting to raise her hand. “I already knew.”
“How long have you been back?” she asks, finally pulling away.
“That’s fine. I have all important numbers memorized. I can purchase a new device.”
“Morning, Sam,” Dean greets with forced casualness, eyes settling somewhere just off to the left of him so that he probably doesn’t see the smile slowly growing on Sam’s face until it reaches his cheeks—but Cas does.
“You think you’re enough to handle me?” she raises her eyebrows and leans forward across the counter to provide us with an even better view.
—as Gabriel could be, he really had Castiel’s best interests at heart this year—for much longer than that, to be honest. Even more significant than that—he’d
If Dean looks now, he can still see it in his brother’s face—the longing for that other life, where he had a college degree and Jess to come home to…maybe even a few kids chasing after a dog in a suburban yard. And
” the actor declared, dragging Cas to the next door over. “Can be su Cas-a.”
He learns that Cas learned to fight after a bigger kid at the orphanage, Raphael, took to making him his personal punching bag—but that he also has a degree in Philosophy from the University of Chicago. About a year ago, he moved to Kansas to help out Anna and Samandriel after her “embarrassing excuse” for an ex-husband left. He takes the four-year-old to daycare in the mornings, which is why Anna knew something was wrong when he didn’t show up. In addition, he calls Gabriel every Sunday only for his brother to harass him about why he didn’t go out on Saturday.
Eventually, Dean had to concede that he might have been a
Dean winces. “I didn’t mean it like that.”
The angel turns back to him and there’s a hint of a smile there somewhere that makes his shoulders relax. “Yes. I’d like that.”
“Nothing. You just… looked concerned.”
Gabriel snorted. “You

“I don’t even know where to
“As far as I aware, Dean and I are not currently in an argument or harboring resentful feelings towards each other,” the angel agrees, measuredly, though he does, at last, set his book down on the bedside table, perhaps thinking it unlikely that he will get to return to it anytime soon.
What I’m learning is that, while past Dean’s temper flares bright and volatile, like home-launched fireworks, it also fades just as fast without something to feed it. He’d looked between all three of us—at the united team we made, saying “Get over it”—and scowled but accepted a breakfast burrito.
“Ah, he died actually. Demon named Abaddon. Well, Knight of Hell, technically. But I suppose you’ll still get to chat with him in, uh--” He quickly does the math. “Five years from your time? I think. Fair warning, I’m probably gonna get some stuff out of order.”
At first, Sam thought he was only hesitating, but then, a few seconds later, he heard footsteps down the hall.  “Later,” Sam promised, squeezing the angel’s shoulder comfortingly.
Capiche?”
“Look,” I tell him. “I don’t want you to get the wrong impression. Dean and Cas are solid. Everyone from angels to demons has tried to use them against each other and they’ve never succeeded. In fact, outside pressure only tends to bring them closer.
Sam sinks into his armchair, legs spread. “Come on, Dean…. You can’t tell me you’re still that oblivious.” Green and blue eyes stare at him with equal amounts of confusion. “You two have been flirting pretty much non-stop for like…15 years. 15.
“Ugh,” the actor protested.
“Yes, you’re pretty,” Cas responded, which felt as self-evident as saying “The sky is blue” or “Water is wet.” Even more so, actually, because the sky could be grey sometimes and ice could feel dry to the touch—but Dean was always,
They made it down a floor.
“I suppose that depends on the reason.”
Then, he hung up before she could get a word in edgewise.
“But, um, I was in a…more secure area of Hell than you were, so he could only retrieve my body, not my soul. Took over a year to get that back.”
Which is how he learned that Cas was the worst person at taking selfies on the planet—needing half a dozen shots to get one that had more than half his head in it.
Cas nodded slowly, but he didn’t seem convinced—or maybe, he just needed an extra push.
,” Dean responds, sounding like he means each word less and less. Realization settles in Sam’s gut.
Castiel’s head is once again throbbing when he wakes up. At first, he struggles to remember why. When he does, he hopes that the momentary mental lapse is from coming out of a deep sleep, not a sign that he sustained any brain damage.
“You’re not, you’re not,” she soothed, which somehow only made him more annoyed. If she
“Come on. You telling me that whatever is going on with you is Crowley-level bad?” Gabriel asked, and the author could almost see his raised eyebrows.
Over the next several weeks, they get into the habit of having lunch together after class. Turns out Cas is pursuing a linguistics degree so he can become a book translator, can Tibetan throat sing, and has apparently never heard the punchline to any joke ever.
“Chick flick moment in the john? Come on, little brother, I’m classier than that.”

But this is his goddamn
Sam knew that he should probably talk to one or both of them about it. After all, Sam had been the one preaching more honesty within their little family for years now. But he couldn’t think of a way to broach the subject without
Castiel shrugs, not willing to mention that he’d only paid minimal attention to the TV. “I was given books. After all, it would be hard for me to describe emotions that I didn’t have a vocabulary for. Among those that I had access to were several letters of the Encyclopedia. I read them all.”
Dean. Not his full spectrum, at any rate. She might glimpse his bright greens and his burning golds and his crackling reds—but not the subtle orange or the camouflage brown or the black so dark it was almost purple. And if she noticed his every pastel blue had a hint of storm-cloud grey in it, she acted like she didn’t.
Cas looks at him, his eyes dazed, and that helps the pride a little bit. “I’d be willing to accept a new teacher,” the angel murmurs, before the haziness suddenly clears. “That is if you…um…Did you…?”
It wasn’t entirely accurate. The combination of dark bedhead and strong, stubble-lined jaw was definitely still working for the author, but he was notably worse for wear than the last time Dean had seen him.
“I mean it,” the actor insisted. “I don’t want this whole situation to be like what went down with you and me. Not that I… Obviously, I’m happy with where we ended up. I’d rather be in the trash compactor with you than somewhere else with someone else. But I guess I’d like to think that one day… you would have reached out to me all on your own and we’d… Whatever.”
The same way he always finds
It was actually quite fun. He didn’t think he’d even seen Meg quite as happy as she was, grinning over her own broken reflection in a TV she had taken a sledgehammer to. And as they talked, and the conversation inevitably turned to Marv, the sheer physicality of launching another knife into the nearby drywall was undeniably satisfying.
interesting than expected. And then, without giving himself a chance to overthink it, Cas stepped forward to give his cousin a hug.

That’s, of course, when he realizes his soulmark is still showing. Cas obviously notices it, too.
“Saved by the bell,” Dean stated with obvious relief, leaping up to answer it—his jeans fitted nicely to his bowlegs in a way that Cas was surprised to realize he appreciated even now.
My mini-me glances over, curiously, but I hold out a finger, already pressing another button.
We give the quiet a chance to settle in—like a dog walking around in three lazy circles before deeming it comfortable enough to rest.
Castiel’s forehead furrowed. “That wasn’t my intent. If anything, I should be apologizing. I have a tendency to misread people—and if that means that I’ve imposed on you in any way—”
“But Valentine’s Day is months away,” he protested.
“I—” He did a quick glance around the diner to make sure there wasn’t anyone aiming a cellphone or camera in his direction. “What sort of question is that? Of
“As pie?” Dean questioned.
—when the heart rate monitor Cas is attached to speeds up. Dean turns, swiftly, only to see blue eyes sweeping the room like the lights on a search helicopter.
“Uh, yeah.”
“Shouldn’t you be more worried about being recognized or something?” Castiel whispered to Dean from a step behind him. The actor was wearing sunglasses, but that seemed more about fighting L.A.’s persistent glare than obscuring his identity.
Dean huffed, the whoosh of air tickling Cas’s nose. “Okaaaayy… but what if this Marv guy had been the real deal. Would you have met with him?”
“I have somewhat of a fondness for them,” Cas argued. “But yes, I suppose I would choose butterflies. They’re pollinators, like bees.”
Castiel shrugged. “I trust you to select an activity I won’t hate. And I’d rather spend time with you than in my apartment by myself.” He wondered if that should worry him. But… he’d also been talking to Gabriel and Charlie more
Cas’s lips barely turned up at the corners. “I think about it sometimes when I visit the Botanical Garden or watch bees flying around: how things like flowers and insects probably shouldn’t exist at all. Our world is
He winces. “I don’t want you to overreact, but—well, I died—and ended up going to hell.”
“Anyway, do I love it that my supposed ‘friends’ can make money selling me out to the press? Or that if I decide to go out to the store in my hot dog pajama pants, that’s suddenly front-page news? Hell no. But I guess it’s better than thinking those friends actually cared about anything besides my name and money. And you know what? I look
So, he did nothing—and felt everything—and when he finally got up, he only made it as far as the couch in his living room before he sat back down again.
Castiel was jolted out of the memory by the first words that Dean had spoken in several minutes. “What’s that look about?” the actor asked, pointing vaguely in the direction of Cas’s mouth. “Figured that with the papps at your door and Crowley and everything, it’d take a lot to get you to smile today.”
Gabriel was

The smile she sent his way was almost toothy. “That’s good to know.”
Dean snorts.
Cas, in fact, doesn’t miss with the knives all night. And yet, he is new enough to guns that Dean is allowed to reposition his shoulder for him—to correct his stance by nudging one of Cas’s feet with his own—to fit his chest against Cas’s back to make sure he is breathing in time with the trigger release.
“Seems young.”

at him. “You know, you can’t go through life thinking that pessimistically, Little Cuz. Sure, almost 450 people die every year by falling out of bed. 150 people keel over by getting hit on the head with a coconut. 13 stiffs show up at the morgue annually from having vending machines fall on them. But you can’t think about who may or may not be about to suffer grievous physical harm. You’ve got to live in the moment.”
Dean turned towards his brother, who immediately held his hands up. “I’m not saying you should. I’m just curious—why not?”
“I haven’t even told Sam yet,” he pointed out. Mostly because he knew his brother would get all weepy on him—call him an “inspirational figure” or worse, buy a bunch of Pride merch for Baby. Dean thought he’d rather take on a bar full of homophobes than deal with Sam’s unfiltered support.
“Dean, I really have to go or my client’s going to wonder why I’ve been gone so long,” Sam continues. “But we should catch up sometime soon. Maybe have lunch here at the Swedish Crown. I think you’d like it.” Well, that would come off as an obvious lie to anyone who knows him, so Dean hopes Brady is nowhere within hearing distance.

She’s about to respond when the dark-haired, blue-eyed man that was behind him finally gets a look at her. “Lisa,” he says, with surprise.
Unsurprisingly, Crowley’s immediate reaction was to ask if someone needed to be called to childproof Castiel’s apartment since the author had

“Are there any chances of him getting Jack?”
“No maybe about it. And Eileen knows all about monsters so…I’m sure whatever you have going on there will turn out way healthier than me and Cas.”
“Why do you think that is?”
But Castiel was already shaking his head. “I’m grateful for your bias in this situation, but that’s not true,” he said. Three years ago, he’d made a choice. And he’d made the same choice again when he met Dean—and every moment they’d spent together since then. He did it with full knowledge of the potential consequences. And now he had to live with them.
“What the hell happened to the kitchen?!” they hear before he even fully opens the door. “It looks like a ghost blew up in there…if ghosts actually worked like they do in Ghostbusters.”

” Dean insisted. “I’ve just learned that when you have verbal diarrhea, it’s best to let you get it all out before worse shit happens.”
“You--”
. Then, he turns on his heel, determined not to waste any more time.
“We should find some other people to play against next time,” Sam said, fingers running through his slightly sweaty hair as they poured out the door. “I think the three of us would make a pretty good team.”
“What? That all you got, Angel?” came the equally affected reply.
“I’ve already apologized for causing you distress. But there are times—like when I am in Heaven—where I simply cannot respond to you.”
tiredness. It’s sadness or boredom or loneliness.
Too-observant blue eyes crawl over his face, almost like Bobby’s dividing his features into a grid and examining each in turn like he would at a crime scene. “Now, I know that if I ask how this case is going, you’re gonna say you’re handling everything fine. But I also know when you’re lying, so go ahead and tell me,” Bobby demands.

“Well, she’s blonde for one thing.”
He looked at the photo—at the beautiful, curving wings of his phoenix—and realized that, as messed up as it was, the person he most wanted to talk to about this was Dean.

whenever there was shit that I didn’t want to think about.
Castiel considers this.
“Good…That’s good,” I murmur, not really knowing what I mean.
Dean had been coming to the Sampsons’ family estate every week since his and Lisa’s first Cas-related fight, meaning this was officially his third time in a row. And frankly, if it weren’t for the kid, he’d probably have gone insane.
Castiel threw her a highly skeptical look as she handed him a plate and fork.
“WheresDeanWinchesterNow.com,” his cousin said with a pop like he was chewing gum.
This Marv wasn’t his father.
“Fine. Let’s…
“You say that, but I was thinking about your name a little bit more, Lucy--”
A yawn sneaks up on her—and she takes that as her cue to quit sleuthing for the night. As she tucks herself further under the covers, Brad automatically wraps around her, and she smiles—this time a genuine one.
Dean hesitates, but only for a moment.
He walks through to the kitchen, where a kettle waits on one of the burners. Dean’s foot slips slightly on a patch of mud. When he gets his balance back, he finds himself blinking at a kitten-themed wall calendar that’s still on last month.
Castiel sat up in time to see Dean scrub the back of his neck. “Or not touching is fine.”
“Like you haven’t used it before,” Sam scoffs in disbelief.
one of the waitresses can’t take a joke and thought I was sexually harassing her.”
Castiel’s tongue tripped over the rest of the words he planned to say. “Wha—Why does that matter?”
For the most part, it looked the same—except more seats had been arranged around the U-shape “for Dean and some others who will be joining us,” Hannah explained. Castiel nodded, vaguely.
Cas’s forehead furrows. “Of course I—"
“Had I not sold my book, I would have been headed up to Stanford to start Med school in a couple of months.”

Eventually, he gave up attempting to be productive; he stayed in sweats and tried to take naps to make up for the sleep he wasn’t fully getting at night; he ate more of the Oreos he hated and spent way too many hours watching a show called
“Dean.”
The other Me had apparently knocked out four of the guards in this place before getting caught. And Bobby and I had made quick dispatch of four more—hopefully, the last of them.
Dean had been too. For four years. But, somehow, it was still worth it.

“Probably in a month or so,” Lisa stated, reaching for the shredded cheese. “Filming would start up around the time Dean finishes
“Well… good,” Dean said, definitively.
Instead, he hauled the box of books out from under his bed, almost choking on a dust bunny in the process. If he then spent the next hour cleaning his already tidy room before actually cracking one open, no one had to know that but him.

“We’re…talking?”
He pastes on a fake smile. “How about earlier yesterday? Did you notice when Cas—Castiel came home?” He corrects himself quickly, carefully avoiding Benny’s gaze.

“I see I’m going to have to file a sexual harassment suit against you before this is all over,” Dean grumbled, but Castiel thought he seemed pleased by the news, which was better than the alternative.

later. Now is not the time to pause. “I get it, man,” he says, scratching the back of his neck. “About wanting it to mean something, that is. I haven’t really been—uh, you know—getting it as much lately. Girls still seem interested and sometimes, you need to just let off a little steam, but…I don’t know. Lying about my name, my job, everything—didn’t used to mind it so much. But now all the effort of charming someone doesn’t seem worth it since it’s not even…real.” And whether he wants to or not, he’s definitely going to have to talk to Sammy in order to get this truth spell reversed. Because there’s no way he can keep running his mouth like this. And yet, Cas’s look of approval—of almost-hope—catches him off-guard.
“I still need more words, Dean.”
“Gabriel…?” he asked, cautiously.
So, Cas ended up being the winner of the last vote! But for those who wanted 2008 Dean's POV, that's coming up next!

“She’s a sign language interpreter with the court system and—you should have seen her today. We were on recess and this guy starts spouting some shit about her behind her back, thinking she couldn’t hear him—but she read his lips using one of the glass display cases and…” Sam pauses, perhaps realizing that his enthusiasm is not catching the way he intended it to.
Several days later, Cas deletes all the messages without listening to them.
The second part, at least, wasn’t a lie—and Ben seemed to accept it all at face value as he went back to watching the road. At 4’2”, he was finally tall enough that he didn’t have to struggle to see out of the windshield.

Castiel couldn’t help but feel defensive anyway. “There aren't many good reasons why he wasn’t around, Dean. It hardly seems worth it to put time and effort into something that is likely to only upset me.”

“We’re getting along better… because I’ve admitted to sucking as a boyfriend?” Dean asked, dubiously. “What sort of messed up math is that?”
“I get that the exes talk is kinda standard—but it feels—weird? a little bit—to talk about her that way. Like it’s even more of a betrayal than….” He sighed, fingers crumbling the paper towel he was using as a napkin. “Is it okay if I… don’t? At least not right now. I owe it to you—but—later?”
His cousin clucked his tongue. “Is that any way to speak to your family?”
“So she might crap on what you do for a living. But she can’t

“Where should I put presents?” Cas asked—and only then did Dean notice the two boxes—two
The other man is looking anywhere but him all of a sudden. However, Castiel is still watching him closely, which is how he notices the light that comes into his eyes when his gaze lands on the beer can, currently rolling back and forth gently in the footwell. He grabs the phone out of Cas’s hand—ignoring the slight static shock that passes from one to the other. “Jody—you sit up at the front of the bus, right?”
“So are you a witch or a fairy or something…?” she asks this Cas, once the waitress comes by with extra menus, under the assumption that she was eating with them now.

I wouldn’t.”
“Well, come on then,” the actor said, walking past him to get to a red-lit panel by the doorway and pressing buttons until it turned green. He pushed the door open, “After you.”
Castiel sighed loudly, but none-the-less, sunk onto the bed, a few safe feet away from Dean.
He rolls his right index finger in a circling motion, indicating that Sam needs to get this show on the road.
but the driver confirmed he’d been
He was in love with Cas.

Cas looks back at the door again. “Alright.” He sits on the edge of the bed and Dean almost imagines him saying, “I’ll watch over you.”
He was less prepared when Sam threw it back, causing it to glance off the actor’s ear and onto the floor. “If we get ants, I’m blaming you,” Dean muttered, stabbing the air in Sam’s direction with his fork.
“No, the dweeb’s telling the truth,” Meg confirms as she pulls her dark hair into a ponytail. She leaves several dark curls out to frame her face, which Castiel always thought must defeat the purpose of pulling one’s hair up in the first place—though he never dared state that out loud.
“Cas!” it yelled. “I know you’re in there. Open up or I’ll climb up your fire escape.”
A half an hour later, Dean was freshly showered and headed to the kitchen while Lisa did—whatever it was girls did that made them look mostly the same but sparklier.
And yet, even if he didn’t
Autumn leaves flutter past Dean’s shoulders, covering areas he has just raked. The whole task seems pointless—but so is Castiel coming here every week, sometimes every day without saying a word. He needs to make a choice—to go to Dean or to walk away and
Dean said he tended to take things far too literally when he was upset. Which is probably why his first instinct was to say something about muscle and bone structure. “I’m fine,” he answered instead. “Can you explain the situation a little more to me? What does this man think to gain by… this?”
How could he have possibly seen Dean and not wanted to look deeper? How could he not have wanted to touch the spread of his shoulder blades and the long line of his spine? How had he been able to run away from Dean when at this moment, the thing he wanted most in the world was to bury himself inside this man and not leave until morning. Possibly not even then.
but what comes out is, “What does
Surprisingly, neither of them flinched when Lisa snapped her fingers between their faces—but Benny did glance over at her. “Yes, cher?” he asked, politely.
And yet, I still have to ask, “Which Dean went out?”
For all Castiel knew, maybe Dean
Of course, Sam had always eaten that stuff up. Even went so far as to write a paper when he was 14 about how he thought Dean’s soulmark represented his ability to “face hardship and come out stronger on the other side.” Luckily, Dean had found it before his brother submitted it—otherwise, the things he talked about would have had CPS called on Dad
“Dean—”
“Good…I feel like asking her some questions,” I say, touching my cheek and wincing.
“And this was yesterday?” Sam asks, trying not to sound like he’s prying too much.
Yes, he had briefly considered telling his cousin what was going on. After all, Dean’s casting would be in the news soon—and he knew Gabriel would be following updates like a hawk.
/////
Dean opens his mouth. Closes it again. And then before he knows it, a laugh rises to the surface, catching him off guard—and if it’s still got a slightly sad aftertaste, he’s so used to it, he doesn’t notice. “Oh my god, man. You’re right. You’re absolutely right. You really had no chance.”
The photo at the top of the article looked like it had been taken in the midst of a family vacation to the beach—and it was clear by Dean’s completely un-staged smile that the man didn’t know it was being taken. Castiel immediately felt bad for spying on such a private moment—however unintentionally—when his gaze finally drifted to the star’s bare chest.
“Hopefully,” Lisa stated, looking almost nervous about it. “I just read the script and—I feel like this really
I’ve met Fate, God, The Darkness, and Death and none of them rendered me as powerless as that please. I close my eyes.
“Some more than the rest of us,” I say, wryly.
Dean and Cas are currently running down the hallway in their boxers, clearly on their way to the shower room if the towels in their hands are anything to go by.
Dean reclined his chair, his body relaxing into a laid-back position like he was sunning on a beach somewhere. Castiel decided to do the same.
“I, uh—technically, Tom Riddle.”
Castiel shook his head.
“Us?” Dean exclaimed in disbelief. “I’m surprised you even know the

The author gave him an unimpressed frown. “Today alone, you’ve called me a dumbass, not normal, and now pathetic. I feel like I should be offended.”
“The road, the road, the road—” Sam warns as Castiel reaches his hands out to both seats in front of him for stability, and Dean gets the vehicle under control.
“Wow, tough room. How about I just… roll the tape?” the employee offered.
“I don’t think you will,” Sam tries to say confidently, moving over to the lone chair in the room that sits in front of Cas’s mostly bare desk.
and then there’s practically overlapping,” his brother grunts, gesturing at the screen where Chelsea and David are in the middle of an argument. “They’re like three inches away from being in a make-out session.”
“That might have been her name.”
“So… what can I do to help?” Lisa offered, already pulling her hair back into a ponytail.
to be angry. I made a mistake that still makes my stomach churn. But between Dean and me, we buried that particular issue a long time ago—and both of us don’t appreciate it being brought up again now.
“I’ve always thought so,” he admitted. “Though perhaps not in those exact terms.”
“If you
He leaned forward. “
“Well, don’t do that either.”
With him gone, Castiel realized how empty the room had become in the last ten minutes. A few scattered people lingered here and there, the sound of their voices, but not their words, echoing around the vaulted space.
“You—could—stay,” Dean repeated slowly so that Castiel could almost
“Okay,” Dean answers—and he thinks he might even mean it.
Instantly, Dean’s expression changes from joking to concerned, which is pretty much the opposite of the reaction Sam expected him to have. “Well, steal Sammy’s almond milk next time.”
“I don’t know. Is this secretly The Bad Place?”
Dean smirking.
“Well, I think we can definitely say he didn’t go somewhere without a fight,” Dean murmurs, referencing their conversation from earlier. He shakes his head. It still doesn’t add up.
It had been a while since Dean had last said that, though.
At least, he now knew he could bug Sam about the details later.
“Then why are you doing it?”
Dean’s mouth finally pulled down at the corners in concern as he took in the author’s expression. “Hey, Ben… Cas and I are gonna go outside for a bit. You cool holding down the fort?
“Uh huh, and is Hannah a 6’1” man with a crew cut, green eyes, and an ass that looks great in spandex?”
I’m going to need entirely more words than that.”
“Fine. Let’s move.”
He flashes her his badge—kids usually love that stuff—but she looks over it with her arms crossed, acting purposefully unimpressed.
I can already tell that this fic is going to test my Supernatural knowledge to the max, haha. So many Easter eggs.
“I wouldn’t worry about it,” Benny yelled after his retreating back. “After all, what’s there to talk about? We’ve all seen the interesting bits already.”
“It’s ‘cause most people don’t just—
Dean snorts. His angel soulmate was apparently trying to adopt the devil’s kid. “What was he in the slammer for?”
“And this is… entertaining?”
No, he’d deal with it
A voice in his head told him he was being pathetic. He didn’t argue with it—it was true. Also, the caramel apple Oreos were definitely the worst, he decided, wrinkling his nose as he chewed.
“Dean, you are being incredibly annoying.”
” I huff, flopping into one of the nearby chairs, legs spread out straight in front of me. A clock ticks. My own breathing sounds doubly loud in the room.
Before, Dean had felt too wired up to sleep. Now, he almost felt too content. It was nice hanging out with his brother—the only person left who really knew what he was like back when his jeans had both holes and grass stains on the knees. Back when he came home from the diner smelling like the coffee some customer had spilled all over him, his jacket pockets lined with crumpled tips.
Instantly, desks squeak, papers shuffle, and chatter starts up again—all getting louder by the minute.
Dean’s mouth opens to form the word ‘good’ automatically, but when he realizes he’s going to say something different instead, he quickly changes tactics. “I’m—Have you seen Cas?”
Castiel approached the Dean Cave, lips buzzing with the words he planned to say. He pushed the heavy wooden door open and…
Her lips purse and he thinks that this is probably the least-impressed that anyone has ever been with him in his life. “I’m sorry,” she says, “But as I was
Dimly, I realize the blonde’s hand is bleeding and she is holding it out to me, palm up—some kind of spell—and I claw at my neck, trying to release a grip that isn’t really there—but which is squeezing me within an inch of my life and still pressing tighter. Probably more like half an inch now.
“I forgot how well you know me,” he grumbles into his coffee.
Castiel felt a fond smile growing at the corners of his lips. “The first day I met you, I knew that you weren’t the
“Well, well, well,” Balthazar murmured appreciatively while Mo growled, “This meeting shouldn’t require subtitles.”
“Right.” “Apologies.” Sam and Cas said at the same time.
either.”
“Stop saying ‘we’,” Dean clarifies. “You’re not one of those dicks.”
“I’m not hungry, but I thought I might accompany you. That is—if you don’t mind?”
“I’m being serious, Dean.”
But three things, in particular, catch his attention.
“We’ve got a few questions for you,” he huffs, reaching for the cuffs in his back pocket.
“That one was, uh, clearer, yeah,” Dean murmurs, looking away towards a landscape painting on the wall.
Easter eggs:
What he needed to do what get his mind off it. So, he set himself a series of tasks.
His frown wrinkles his forehead. “Why do you look like that?”
Quickly shouting the directions to Benny who had been leaning against his own car, waiting on Dean, he whips his way out of Brady’s driveway and back onto the road, determined to break every traffic law there is on the way.
Castiel slid the headset she’d gotten him as a birthday present over his head.
The thing about them not having fights is he wasn’t really sure what his role was here. Talk? Let her talk? Stay standing where he was? Go sit on the bed? Would she get mad if he changed into sweatpants right now? Probably, right?
“Mitch, was it? Or Mick? What can we do for the British Men of Letters today?”
“I didn’t say it to get your pity. I just thought you’d like to know…. My powers don’t tell me much. If anything, I think they probably just make me confused.”
“It’s just…you’re only the seventh person I know of who’s actually read my book.”
“Well, whatever makes you happy, I guess,” Dean grumbled, relocating the clean plates to the appropriate cabinet and letting the door shut with a quiet
“Morning!” Dean greets him, deftly sliding pancakes onto a plate that already has half a dozen sausage links on it. “Your breakfast is over there,” he says, pointing to a spinach omelet that he has made slightly less gross by completing covering it in cheese.
,” Cas stuttered incoherently, in response.
“You would be playing Julia, I presume?” Cas asked as a follow-up question.
“I took some time.”
It was possible he fell asleep at some point since the creak of the door jolted him back to his senses. A dark figure emerged from the shadows. What was Cas’s agent’s name again? Growly?
“So while you may think of yourself as nothing more than someone who wears a leather jacket, listens to 80’s rock, and has a string of meaningless one-night-stands, seeing you devote yourself completely to somebody—seems pretty classic Dean Winchester to me.”
Cas shrugs, dismissive.
/////
But when, after a happy afternoon at the botanical gardens, Dean dropped him off at his apartment with a lingering kiss—and then called later that night, talking to Cas until his every other word was punctuated with a yawn but still insisting on staying on the phone until Cas played his card—Castiel couldn’t help but be thrilled by how full his life had become.
“Back?”
“Cas? What’s up?... Don’t say the ceiling.”
he thinks, going for the Jack.
“Looking forward to it,” Sam responded a half-second before Cas pressed the “end” button. The author then plucked his own phone back from Dean’s hands.
“Crowley’s, to be exact,” Gabriel specified and, just like that, the coiling tension in Cas’s gut got tighter.
“He said…I was like a brother to him. Less than a week ago,” I protest, feeling irrationally angry with Sam for what he’s trying to convince me of. Dean winks at waitresses and makes innuendos at female gas station clerks and puts on his dark green button-up shirt to go to bars on nights he doesn’t want Sam or me to join him. And I don’t mind. I don’t mind being his family or his “buddy” or his “pal” because that means I’m a part of his life—maybe even an important part—and that’s enough for me. I would never ask for more. And here Sam is trying to convince me that….
“We’ll figure it out eventually….” Cas soothes. “We always do.”
Dean’s eyes shot open—suddenly alert. “Wait. Really?”
“Did you have a good night with Benny?” Cas asked, twisting his grip around himself as he reached the head—his hips automatically canting upward in pleasure.
“There’s no such--” the other Me begins, with heat.
“What?”
“What…?”
“Cascascas…”

“Shut up, Bitch." Dean warns him, but there’s a chuckle in his voice. A minute later, he goes back to looking for ingredients.
“If you must know, I was at a charity fundraiser for neuroblastoma research. The party started at 8 and concluded somewhere around 2 in the morning.”
Dean has a sudden premonition that he shouldn’t read the last point, feeling like his heart is trying to use his ribcage as a punching bag.
“Not much. I know one Dean is in his room claiming he’s not hungry—and the other went out to the strip club.” I wince—an uncommon enough gesture for me that Sam can’t help but notice.
“It is good to see you like this, Sammy. I mean, since I got back from the Pit, you—the other you—has seemed a bit—I don’t know... But I guess I was just worried for nothing.”
The second one it was.

Doesn’t mean Dean has to admit it though. Especially since knowing Cas is right and
By contrast, he knew very little about Benny or their relationship. Only that Dean wasn’t fully ready to come out back then, and Benny wasn’t willing to leave New Orleans under those circumstances, so they just… parted.

“Then stay away from my anime history.”

She turned to Lisa and winked. “Don’t worry, I know he’s taken,” she said in a loud whisper. Lisa waved off her concerns with a smile and, with that, they started the scene.
“Or… I could work on my reputation as a diva and refuse to go.”
And with that, he hung up before Castiel could get another word in.
“The prequels were more technologically advanced, Dean,” Cas is currently arguing on their way to help one of Garth’s hunter connections.

“Yes,” the angel says, striped tie swinging as he raises his head.
Dean’s eyes narrowed—and Cas’s did too—as the actor pushed off the row of shelves he’d been leaning against.
Aaron nods, enthusiastically. “I’m going to talk to Dr. Cain to see if I can work in oncology that day.”
Cas reached forward, grabbing Dean’s arm, and placing the actor’s hand over where his phoenix rested. “I’m your soulmate. Tell me I’m lying.”
“You’re probably right,” Cas lets out a long sigh.
Cas mutters something under his breath that Dean guesses is a string of curse words in Enochian. “Good night, Dean,” he grumbles, exasperated, turning to go one more time.
“I didn’t inform anyone at the hospital,” Castiel promises, as warm lips of support press to the top of his head.

“I find chores soothing sometimes,” he replied simply, turning over a glass so that the soap bubbles drained out of it.
“She doesn’t have special abilities, if that’s what you’re asking,” Hannah murmurs, still sounding unconcerned.
And you need to get back to do all the stuff. To be there for Sam. To…to save the world. You get me?”
“How were things with Benny tonight?” he eventually asked.
“I can understand why you might have some hard feelings, Sam,” the man—Mick—says calmingly. “My colleagues behaved abhorrently and against orders when it came to you. They were only supposed to reach out to see what information you and your brother and your--” his eyes flicker over to Cas for just an instant “allies would
“Something Rosetta stone-ish.”
He wasn’t anti-soulmate. Clearly. He was happy for Charlie and Dorothy, right? And he was glad when Benny found Andrea a few years after their… thing… in New Orleans. Yeah, okay, it kinda sucked when his ex-girlfriend, Cassie, threw away the good thing they had going just because she met “the one,” but he’d gotten over that—

We make it another quarter mile down the road before he responds. “If I was considering giving it another try—and I do end up hating it—is that going to completely screw up our friendship? ‘Cause I’m not risking that.”
“I’m alright.”
Dean took a step closer. “I’ll admit, it’s not the greatest gift in the world.” He cupped the side of Cas’s face, smoothing his thumb over the line of stubble. “In fact, it’s kinda something that was already yours to begin with.”
,” he insisted.
“Reading!” Dean yells back as he reaches the door. “Speaking of, I left something on the table for you.” And with that, the door swings closed between them.

to ask whether her choice of profession had to do with the loss of her father. But it had gotten her to leave him alone, so that was probably for the best anyway.) Still, he found it interesting to reverse-engineer people—to try to figure out Point A while looking at Point K.
Because with Ben asleep, and his insomnia as rampant as ever, he had no more distractions—no more places to hide. Just the truth.
And then…
Sam’s eyes looked like they were going to boggle out of his head. “Holy shit!” he exclaimed. “I could barely put up with Dean being an idiot over Cas and it was only a few
He swallows, hastily, “Well…? Fill me in.”
“You just said you liked being around us, right?” Cas nods. “Well, didn’t you think this profound bond stuff worked both ways?” The two of them stare at each other, probing, assessing, and finally just looking at one another as if, this time, they’ll finally pierce the mystery that they’ve been trying to solve for years. Dean sometimes wonders if the angel’s gaze contains a touch of his healing grace because in the moments when they’re like this, the ache in his lower back seems to recede, as does the lingering touches of headache behind his temples.
Secretly, Castiel couldn’t help but agree. He and his cousin were still sitting in his familiar, two-bedroom apartment. The normal sounds of traffic were still filtering through the window. By all accounts, it was a Thursday afternoon that was probably not going to be particularly remarkable for most people in the world.
It’s as he’s standing listlessly in front of the vending machine, which contains exactly the kind of food hospitals probably shouldn’t have, when an idea comes to him…. He just hopes he makes it back before Cas wakes up.
“No, Dean, that’s—” She steadied herself, clearly using one of the breathing techniques she’d picked up at yoga. “The point is that our relationship shouldn’t be an afterthought.”
With that in mind, he takes a breath, figuring he should at least go first. “You know how much I hate the whole destiny schtick. But even before you guys decided to write Sam and me into the Bible, I sorta felt like I didn’t have a lot of choice anyway. I mean, what was I gonna do?

Cas dropped his tea mug on the counter awkwardly enough that it tottered in place for a few seconds before settling. But by then, he’d already made it across the living room.
Of course, Sam just took the seat next to him. “I mean, I was a bit… surprised… when you two moved in together.”
to achieve a poker face.
My mind fills with images—those thousand bleeding, glassy-eyed Deans, the burnt-husk wings of over a thousand dead angels, the light going out of Balthazar and Alfie as I stabbed them. I remember Jimmy, whose body I wear, and his once-whole family. But Dean’s right—for the most part, he knows about all those things, and he forgave me for them. Much more readily than he forgives himself for his mistakes. And, to be honest, those were never the things I’ve been afraid to show him.

Now, with four minutes left to make it clear across the convention center, Dean dodges a group of girls dressed as the Sailor Scouts, pretends not to hear a Darth Vader asking for a picture, and narrowly avoids running into a vendor selling popcorn in Tardis-shaped boxes. A security guard with messy, dark hair is obviously struggling to get into Hall C, too, while pushing a loaded dolly. Most likely, these are presents given to celebrities by fans—to be stored, or perhaps, searched in case they contain anything dangerous.
“thot u were pretending not 2b a stalker”
“So, what’re the options here?” Dean asked, once she’d put on her rarely-seen “Kara Danvers” glasses. The ones that indicated she meant business.
“Anything you want, Dean.”
“Yeah, sure, no problem,” Dean responded—and if Cas’s heart had calmed down at all, it sped right back up again as the actor stepped forward to adjust his collar and wind Cas’s discarded tie back around his neck. “At some point, we’re gonna have to sort out all our laundry.”
Sam didn’t have a fucking clue what was going on and it was starting to freak him out. Cas was
“Just…give me some time,” he whispers to the angel. “Not…not a lot of it. Enough to get my head on straight. And then I’ll tell Sam, I promise.”

to remember certain things to push away the cold and the blackness.
“I—I don’t—” Dean’s holding out his wrist like it’s bleeding, his breathing shallow.

I wince at the internal choice of words.

launch. Cas had seen some ducks that he wanted to take pictures of, and then cautiously asked if he could have one of him and Sam too.
Dean turns half-lidded eyes to him. “You gonna tell me how awesome I am Cas?”
“Why?” Castiel blurted out, brain-to-mouth filter temporarily fuzzing into static.
“Cassie likes group activities where he can be alone. Like those painting and wine classes, where you can pretend that you’re putting yourself out there because there are a bunch of people around you, but don’t involve actually talking to anyone.”
It didn’t even ring once before the call was picked up. “Castiel, my fine feathered author,” the person on the end of the line exclaimed, voice curling luxuriously like smoke. “I’ve been meaning to check in on you.”
“Name?”

“I mean, you of all people, get it,” Dean shrugs, running his hands over his jeans.
“Uh, Pam—” Dean started.

Several hours later, he enters the kitchen a bit cautiously
Dean’s mouth worked up and down, disbelievingly. “Screw you—that was a great joke—” he argued at last.
A voice inside me asks, but the answer is
“Are you talking to me as your friend or as your sorta-social media manager right now?” she asked.
He’d heard the expression “honeymoon phase” before. From what he understood, it was a time of carefreeness—when individuals overlooked their partners’ flaws because they were so enraptured by how good it felt to be together. He’d also been told by Sam that he and Dean had skipped that, and the wedding, and about thirty anniversaries to go straight into “married couple bickering.”
“What else am I supposed to do on the crapper?” Gabriel asked, completely innocently. “
He frowned at the screen. “Actually, they’re from Charlie.”
would he?” the actor questioned, loudly.
Castiel knew, factually, that many success stories started as failure stories—he’d just always had a hard time applying that to himself. “You’re probably correct,” he conceded.
“How would you define Dean’s relationship with—”
Cas now felt like their roles were reversed, even without switching positions.
“To be honest?” Gabriel huffs. “I think he wants the company, but he just doesn’t find that many people interesting. He doesn’t get the point of gossip or small talk. As a teenager, someone would bring up the weather, and he would tell them about the different kinds of clouds there are or what some shit-old religion believed about how to summon rain—only to realize that the person just wanted him to say, ‘Yeah, it sucks outside’.”
It was then that he remembered that he never responded to the other man’s text message. So perhaps he was a bit of a hypocrite. Luckily, Sam seemed to accept his forgetfulness with grace.
And it must have worked, because when he came to, it was to a hand on his shoulder, shaking him awake. “Sammy?” he asked automatically, the hand far too large to be Lisa’s.
Sam’s phone rings before finally going to voicemail. I try Dean’s. Then the other Dean’s. Then Cas’s, struggling not to roll my eyes.

“Poughkeepsie, Sam,” Dean says—and it doesn’t matter if it’s been years since they used that word, the mention of it still causes his brother to cut himself off. Dean hurries to get this next part out. “Now, I know you think I have a grudge against the guy and you’re right, but I need you to

isn’t it?”
The general gist seemed to be that while everyone can conjure up fantastical elements in their dreams, the more detailed the image, the more likely it is to be based on something the person knows explicitly. A blurry vampire was probably just an idea; a dark-haired, blue-eyed vampire with a Cajun accent and a fisherman’s cap was more likely an interpretation of somebody specific.
Even from the Impala, he can see the falling star drawn onto Castiel Novak’s front door. The dripping red paint looks like blood—but thankfully, it hasn’t been at any of the crime scenes so far.
He turned towards his kitchen, ignoring Dean’s sputtering behind him.
15 minutes later, Dean has had two more burgers and Sam is finally powering up his phone to resume asking questions. “Take four minutes and tell your partner your life story in as much detail as possible.”
“But I don’t know how to just…talk to you…now that you’ve told me…” Dean rubs the back of his neck. “You know, what you told me…”
“Spoilsport,” Balthazar teased.

Most people in the bars in and around Lebanon know Sam and me pretty well as the Campbell brothers—meaning they’d probably have questions if I suddenly showed up with a Xeroxed version of myself. So, just to be on the safe side, we head to a place on the border of Missouri. It looks like it was last decorated 15 years ago and smells like fried cheese—so it’s practically a home away from home.
