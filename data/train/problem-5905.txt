Steve nodded, a warm rush of feeling threatening to overwhelm him for a moment.
“Ah, crap, I was going to bring dinner,” Tony said, following Steve into his apartment.  “Sorry—I just. I forgot.”
“I do, and I’m sitting here, and all that is true, but, honestly, you had me at nutso.  Oh, and you’re fired, by the way,” Tony said, standing up and leaning his hands on the conference table.  “To answer your question, Steve is the ‘nutso,’” Tony grated out, putting the word in air quotes.  He could feel a thread of anger course through his voice, and his chest tighten with tension.  “Great term, by the way. Classy.  Steve is a highly decorated Army officer, one of the finest men I’ve ever known, someone I probably owe my life to, and Steve was the guy who offered to do anything and everything, including scrub your God-damned toilets, if you would help his friend, which, of course, you didn’t. Because of a lot of reasons, probably.  Possibly even some good ones, I don’t know.  Maybe once upon a time, maybe I was like you, and wouldn’t have cared.  Had a bit of a laugh over the gall of it, you know?  But, trust me, how we do this, it matters.  When you take away all of this,” Tony said, gesturing around the room, “it’s the only thing that matters.  Look, there’s plenty of money to be made.  You can make it on the backs of the people you’re supposed to be helping or you can make it by lifting them up with you.”
“Tony, we left weird at plunking down, what, thirty million, because some guy insulted your fake husband,” Rhodey pointed out, somewhat reasonably, Tony had to admit.
“Right.  Sorry.  Sorry, that was stupid of me,” Tony rushed out in a fumbling string of words.
He wasn’t sure when he realized he was different. Wrong-different. When had his parents’ glances had gone from concerned to furtive to something that might have been pitying? If it had been pity, it had quickly become laced with something darker, maybe their own guilt slowly burning into penance, he couldn’t be sure. They’d done a damn good job making themselves unhappy, that much was certain, until his father spent more days trying to bury a ghost than raise a son.
Which is how Steve found himself in the Stark Industries Marketing Department, shifting back and forth on his feet, trying not to tap his fingers on the receptionist’s counter in frustration as she completed her phone call.
Steve had ended up painting Kirk with his head thrown back against the bar, legs splayed over the bench, one arm dangling off to the side, a languid pose that seemed to be moments from moving to something else entirely. Bold and fragile at the same time.  The look Steve captured was direct, piercing, deliberate in a way that Steve didn’t think he would ever be able to possess. The blue background of the comforter framed Kirk’s form, dripping behind his body like a flow of water, as if he was being born from it, coming into a grey, blank world that wasn’t ready for him just yet.
Steve could feel his body loosening, though he knew it wouldn’t be enough, and it would hurt when Tony finally took him, but it was anticipation and desperate want that filled his mind, not fear.  It would feel so good, to stretch and open for Tony like that, to give that to Tony, that pain, that faith that it would be good. The need to do that burned through him sharper than any pain.  He caught Tony’s eye, then slowly turned his head to the side, pulling the chain that held his right nipple until it stretched tight, a deep, pulsating stab of pain and want pushing at the head of his cock until Steve thought he might explode.  He wouldn’t, though.  He would be good for Tony.
“If you say that in front of him, I can’t be responsible for his actions,” Tony chuckled, shifting out of Steve’s embrace.  “I should…”
Complete, he thought again.
“Jealous of the car?” Coulson asked.
He really did need to go inside and get ready.  Steve had gone to some trouble for the evening, so he could at least make an effort in return, particularly after his screw-up this afternoon.  He would have to make that right, somehow.
“He’d rather I just had a drug problem like all the cool kids, but I live to disappoint,” Kirk replied, sighing dramatically.
“You are right,” Steve said finally, turning from the vase of lilies to glance at Cam where he lounged on the bed.  “Fine.  I will go to him.” Cam’s head snapped around to Steve and a smile broke across the boy’s face.
Tony caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror above the dresser and rolled his eyes. Good Christ. Fucking figures, he thought with a wave of frustrated disgust. He looked like a Chia pet someone watered on one side. Calling his hair a lost cause probably did a disservice to lost causes everywhere, so instead of trying to smooth his hair down, he ran both hands back and forth through it, wringing it out into messy curls, before flopping down on the bed. The wooden beams of the ceiling jutted up into an A-shaped arc over his head, with the ceiling fan hanging from the center, the blades undulating in hypnotically slow circles above his head.
“Clint,” Steve supplied.  “Sure. We can invite Clint and Laura. Maybe they’d come down?  Be great to see the kids.”
It wasn’t true, of course.  He knew that. People like Steve were brave, not people like him.  People who did things, helped, made a difference.  People who stood up for themselves, who drew a line in the sand and said, this far and no more.  That wasn’t him.  Not even close.  How many years had he been under Howard’s thumb doing fuck-all about it other than the occasional useless act of defiance that left him with little more than bruises and disappointment to show for his effort.  He was the last person Steve should consider brave.
“I’ll stay,” Steve sighed.  He reached out for the hem of Tony’s shirt, then stopped, hands hovering.  “This okay?” he asked.  Tony shrugged and peeled the shirt off.  Well, mostly off. It got stuck around his head and his arms sort of flailed around a bit until Steve helped get it the rest of the way off.  He kicked his shoes off and then somehow shimmied out of his jeans, leaving himself in his boxers and socks, sitting half atop the bathmat and half on Steve’s lap.
“How would I know?” Tony demanded, turning to look over his shoulder and peer down the empty stairs.  When he turned back around, Rhodey was giving him a shrewd, knowing look.  “Fine.  Yes.  Gets off at five.  Commute is about an hour. I only know because Pepper told me, since she’d been trying to find a time when he was home to get him the papers.  Stop looking at me.”
“So, wait.  I don’t follow.  I mean, a lot of things, but stay with me here.  You go into cryo because you’re...dying. From these toxins or whatever that build up inside you,” Tony began, “And then your ship alerts you that I’m out there dying tragically--but in truly spectacular fashion, let’s just acknowledge that--” Tony added, slashing his hand through the air.  “So you decide to wake up and come help me, even though I may not be compatible and may not even agree to all this--wait, what if I hadn’t agreed?”
“Might not be an urban legend,” Rhodey admitted, giving the corner a concerned look.
“Sorry.  Sorry. Swallowed wrong or s’mthin,” Happy rasped out around a pointed cough.  “Just gonna step out and get some air.  You two can…ah.  Yeah,” Happy muttered, grabbing the rolled up sports section from the seat next to him and clamoring out of the car so fast you’d have thought there was a cougar riding shotgun.
“Fondue sounds…about right,” Steve admitted with a large smile. Tony frowned and looked at him in question, but Steve just shook his head and stretched his arms above his head to work the kinks out of his back. He cast a quick glance at the clock and saw that it was mid-morning already.  They showered together, taking their time, Tony washing Steve almost reverently, then carefully drying him off with one of the soft, fluffy towels Steve knew Tony had ordered specially for this, and had a real breakfast this time, mostly consisting of the foods Steve had ordered for Tony because otherwise they had Power Bars and various flavors of electrolyte powder.
“Switzerland is nice,” Steve commented.  Stupidly observant, dish soap-buying Alpha, Tony thought with a wave of annoyance, though he wasn’t sure if it was directed primarily at Steve or at himself.
“Tony,” Steve sighed, feeling suddenly helpless.
“Steve stay,” Anto told Steve, then ran to the edge of the clearing across from the cave and disappeared into the forest as Steve called out to him.  He stopped by a rotted tree stump, the one that sometimes looked like a bear, if you looked at it right, and reached into the deep hollow underneath it, pulling out a small bag.  He checked inside it. Everything was there. A surge of relief filled him. This was it. He was going. Maybe not as Steve’s Omega, but he would find the Others. His people. Who laughed and cried and made beautiful things.  He rushed back to the clearing, where Steve was waiting with his hands on his hips.
“Free licks!  Sorry.  Sorry, I couldn’t help myself.  I loved that shirt.  Okay, calling now.  Don’t get all grumpy,” Tony said, pulling out his phone and punching Happy’s number.  “Hey, Happy.  Yeah, can you come pick us up at the corner of What Were We Thinking and We’re Too Good Looking For This?  What?  No, I’m—no, those are not real street names. God, put down the MAPCO.  Did you find that thing next to a couple of stone tablets with like, say, around ten strongly worded suggestions on them?  Look, I’m sending the GPS coordinates to your phone. Just do what the soothing voice tells you,” Tony said, shooting Steve an exasperated look.  “He’s on his way.  Maybe.”
“He fell! That was not my fault,” Malcolm, the older one, nearly shouted.
.  Oh, God.  It really was. He remembered the address from the alumni record and various announcements and pleas for donations that had come to the house over the years.  “What…what are we doing here?” Tony asked, sucking in a breath and letting it sit in his chest so long that it started to burn.
“You got a shit deal, you know,” Tony bit out, words dripping with venom. It felt good. Satisfying. Letting the bitterness twist around the words instead of where it wanted to stay, lodge deep down inside, and watching Steve's face go from faux concern to surprise to hurt like flicking through photos on a phone.
“I feel like giving everyone in the audience a car and my favorite scented candle,” Tony said with a low chuckle.  “I know you think we would’ve eventually broken up, even without Howard’s little assist. Too many differences, too much separating us.  Maybe you were right.  Maybe we would have fractured apart, no matter what. I don’t know.  But, see, the thing is, now, we know what it feels like to live without each other.  I know how it feels to walk into a building I should love and wish it was a crappy apartment with the mattress on the floor.  I know what it feels like to give speeches and get awards and look through a crowd of faces, searching for someone who isn’t there.  So.  Maybe you were right, and we wouldn’t have made it. Then.  But, we will now.  These…challenges.  Whatever they are.  We’ll face them together. We’ll get through these things, because we know what’s its like when we don’t.  And I don’t think either of us want that life.  I don’t want that life.  I’d rather be here, holding a bag of frozen peas in a shitty Brooklyn walk-up with no Wi-Fi than try that again.  I’m not good at that life.  I can be good at this, Steve.  Let me try.  That’s all I’m asking.”
“Hey! That’s hardly fair!” Steve shouted in admonition, then grinned, threw back his head and found himself laughing.  He ducked his head in mock surrender and put his hand over his heart. “You’re something else, Shellhead. Guess I had that coming.”
If you are interested in the pictures that inspired Steve's outfits in this chapter, head over to my tumblr (sabrecmc) for all the pretty objectification of Steve.  Sorry, Steve (no, I'm not).
“Opening airlock,” Tony said.  He pressed a large, red button, then turned a chunky, grey handle that vaguely resembled one of those old, giant cellphones you carried around with two hands, until a hiss of air released.  The airlock door opened from the cabin into the payload bay area. He had to open those doors manually since the power was fried, but in the suit, he managed it fairly quickly. The doors peeled back, revealing the star-dotted, infinite blackness.
They made their way into the house, the front doors opening with a key somehow.  It was just as impressive from the inside.  But what caught Steve’s attention was the art.  All over the place.  Paintings, sculptures, photographs, many he recognized or at least knew the style well enough to come close and these…these weren’t prints.  These were the real thing.  Tony walked over to the bar and poured himself another drink.  He held up the decanter in silent question to Steve, but Steve shook his head, barely turning away from the Jackson Pollack in front of him.  He’d never thought to see one of these outside a museum.  And here it was.  In a hallway of the house owned by the guy who was paying him for sex.  Well, that thought brought some much needed clarity.
Tony kind of hated him.
“He’s not my boyfriend,” Steve replied.
?  The kids will be having a snowball fight?  Right.  Uh-huh. Steven Grant Rogers, did those words just come out of your mouth?”  Natasha demanded.
“He’s not ready.  You threw him at Loki, and look how well that went off,” Tony reminded him.  “We got played by some Medieval Times reject you put in a glass jar!  Damn it, Nick, he barely sleeps, and when he does, he still has nightmares. It’s like the tropics in our bedroom—“
“The scrap box
, and as long as you bear my Claim, you can be nothing else.”
“Oh,” Tony said, seemingly at a loss for words. Then, just as suddenly, it was like the sun broke over the horizon. Tony’s face lit up with unbridled joy, the kind that Steve thought he rarely got to enjoy. “You do,” he breathed out, relief and happiness seemingly at war in his voice. Tony wanted this. More than even Steve realized. Maybe it was a cruelty, after all, Steve thought, but it was too late to take it back, even if he wanted to.
“I--” Steve began, then realized he had no idea what to say.
“Nah.  I’ll probably get some kind of service badge from helping you cross the street,” Tony chided, nudging an elbow into Steve’s side.
“You bought the company?” Steve asked, shaking his head in disbelief.
Steve sucked in a deep gulp of air, trying to force the sudden rigidity out of his body, like he was stuck in place, and wasn’t that just the thing?  He wondered how much Tony was going to push this.  He couldn’t really force Steve to answer, but if he didn’t answer, that was probably more of an admission than he wanted to give.
“Don’t apologize. It will be alright. Soon. Soon, it will be alright. I promise,” Tony said, sounding worn and pained, the way Steve felt most of the time.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked.
Anthony would be here soon.  Here. For real. Coulson texted Steve almost an hour ago that they were on their way, Anthony and his parents.  They’d agreed to the Bonding. The Starks. Fury had finally shared that much with Steve, delivering the news personally late one night while he still smelled of cigars and brandy.  Fury said the parents were pleased. He didn’t say anything about whether Anthony was pleased. Steve had stood there in the doorway of his room, hoping for some kind of report on Anthony’s reaction, but Fury had just gone over a few of the details, then left with a brusque nod.  Steve had broken down and asked Coulson a few days later. His father says he’s very excited. That’s what Coulson had said. Steve had smiled, and said that was good, and thanked Coulson. He didn’t know why he didn’t think it was good.
“Ah,” Jarvis said.
“Right,” Barnes repeated, drawing out the word.  “You’re just…pretending.  So that the police will think you’re married, and Steve doesn’t have to talk to them.”
“I was thinking sofa,” Rogers responded with a laugh.  “But, I’ll put it on the list,” Steve promised, and damn if he didn’t pull out a small spiral notebook and write it down.  “So, ah, Coulson.  He’ll take care of getting the cabin stocked, and we’ll have your things packed up and sent over.  Anything else you need, just let him know.  He’ll take care of it.”
“Nosiree, Captain, wouldn’t hear of it.  Honestly, I’ll bet we can auction the pieces off, raise some money for our wounded officers project,” the man chimed in merrily, digging in his pocket for a phone.
with him, Steve realized, back going straight with shock.  Blatantly flirting. There wasn’t really a way to misconstrue the exaggerated come-hither look Tony was throwing Steve’s way.  Not just flirting, but, well…propositioning him.
“Classic insecurity coupled with a need to overcompensate through what is basically emotional bribery.  Probably wasn’t hugged enough as a child or something,” Tony told him.
“You—you—that can’t—no—that’s not possible,” Stern spluttered uselessly, looking from Tony to Steve, as if noticing the other man for the first time.
“Do not try your solution to problem neighbors,” Steve implored with a laugh, tossing Tony a half-smile over his shoulder as he pushed the door to the coffee shop open, making the bell hanging over it jingle merrily above the hum of conversation clanking of cups.
He meant it to be placating, maybe even a little teasing, but it just sort of came out rough and thick, like the words were sticking to the roof of his mouth.  God, Steve smelled good, Tony thought sluggishly.  He sucked in a deep breath through his nose, and felt the powerful musk burn its way down his throat to his lungs.  Everything went sort of hazy and muffled in his head for a moment, like he was at the end of a tunnel and something was rushing towards him with a low rumble of energy.  His body instinctively poised for flight, coiling up like a spring, but he didn’t move.  He wasn’t sure he could, even if he wanted to.  His mind seemed barely capable of offering suggestions to his body, who was currently sort of taking things under advisement.
“Your loss, Dorito,” the woman said, untangling herself from Bucky and pulling out a cell phone.
“There,” Cam pronounced when he stood up from buckling the chain around Steve’s right ankle into place.  “Perfect.  The King’s going to love it.  You should let me dress you all the time.  Like your…what do you call it?  For the knights?  Squire.  Did you have one, when you were a solider? I could be like your squire, but for here, ‘cause you kind of really need it.”
"I say that always, Tony Stark. Where shall we go first?" Steve asked.
“So,” Tony echoed.  “So, this is awkward, right?  You and me, and this whole, I like you, you like me, thing, and the pretend marriage thing on top of that.  I mean, it’s weird, right?  Or, I don’t know, maybe it doesn’t feel weird, and that’s what’s awkward?  Or is it not awkward, and now I’m making it awkward by talking about how it’s awkward? I’m feeling some definite awkwardness here.  Or panic. Could be panic.  Maybe it’s awkward to be panicking? Between the two—”
“Yeah, I know about the stock.  Thing is, you knew about the stock hit last night. There was a graph.  None of that was new information.  But, you meet with Stane, and suddenly, there’s no way this project can work?  What’d he say to you?” Steve asked.  If he didn’t know Steve, Tony would have thought Steve was just mildly curious, but he did know Steve, and this was Steve’s dog-with-a-bone tone, and either he had to cut it off now or there was no getting it out of Steve’s teeth, the damn, stubborn man.
“I predict that the Chitauri will soon plague you no more, Your Highness,” the Ul said. “One taste of the Jerak’ho, I think, and they will be on their knees, begging their bull-god for help.” He huffed out a low laugh and smiled widely, his gaze flicking to Steve for a moment, something dark and rotting shifting behind the Ul’s eyes. “A few more of these, and I do believe that we could wipe the Chitauri from the face of the world altogether.”
“Trust me, it’s a point in your favor that you don’t mind that I went to a fancy work party and got into a fight,” Steve deadpanned, lip curling around something of a smirk.  There was relief there, too, Tony thought, looking up and finding himself momentarily thrown by the thought that Steve had worried about how Tony would feel about having his honor defended with a good, old-fashioned, glove to the face, throw-down.  “I should take you to Brooklyn.  Show you all the places I got into fights. Fair warning, that’s gonna fill a day.”
“No, no, nothing like that.  It’s—ah.  Well.  About our training session Saturday afternoon,” Cap began. “I, um.  I kind of need to cancel.  Or move it to a different day.  If that’s okay with Mr. Stark?”
Tony looked down at Steve, eyes tracing over the sweat-darkened hair and bluish shadows under his eyes to where the mask covered his mouth and nose for the machine to force air into his lungs.  He dragged his gaze back up to Thor’s for a long moment, then caught Bruce’s quick look before the other man dropped his eyes.
“I--” Steve stammered, shaking his head as the cold wash of realization coursed through him.  “You...you did this to me, you--why? What do you...what do you want of me? Why would--”
“You should rest after you eat,” Cam encouraged him around a mouthful of candied orange that clung to his teeth.
Tomorrow, Steve thought.  Tomorrow, I will let myself think it.  But not tonight.  Not here.
Steve went there to ask for Tony’s blessing, and he left believing he had it.  Had Tony not wished him well?  Said all the right things about Pierce?  A jape about his age, perhaps, but that was just Tony’s way.  Still, as the wedding day approached, Steve found himself looking back on that conversation more and more often.  Perhaps because it had been their last, though Steve had not known at the time that it would be.  If he had, he would have—what?  He frowned, looking down at the tunic dangling from his hands.
“Oh, fuck!” Tony blurted out, eyes opening wide as he felt a warm breath of air cover his hole, followed by a tentative swipe of Steve’s tongue, just around the bottom of the rim.  “You—God—you…”
Thank you all so much for your support of this fic!  I'm really deeply grateful and so glad people seem to be enjoying it. Thank you for your patience, as well.  As you will see, you are getting a long chapter in return for the wait.
“Keep him,” Rhodey said, pursing his lips together and giving a firm nod.
“It’s not—It’s not what you’re thinking,” Steve said, face scrunching into a pained wince. He pinched the bridge of his nose between his forefingers before continuing. Lying was hard enough for him. Lying to Natasha was a bit like riding to work on a unicycle. You could do it, but it was going to hurt and what was even the point?
“Okay, really?  Forget it.  Look, and pay attention, because this is going to be on the quiz.  I’m Tony Stark.  You heard that name somewhere between deciding on the Blue Raspberry for your Blue Goose?  Okay,” Tony said when the man nodded sluggishly.  “Going to need you to focus here, can you do that?”
Tony practically sneered the last, which, Steve would realize sometime later, was essentially the equivalent of throwing chum into shark-filled waters.
“I must speak with Rhodey,” Tony said from next to him, drawing Steve from his thoughts. Steve looked down at him, then looked again, almost seeming to see the transformation happen, as Tony went from something that he gave only to Steve to what it was he allowed for the world.  “Our tent is there,” Tony said with a jerk of his head, as if Steve couldn’t pick out the large tent with Tony’s banner flapping in the wind over top of it.  The one underneath caught his eye though, the familiar red, white and blue standard of Brookland catching proudly on the breeze beneath its King’s.    Steve felt a wave of tenderness rush through him at the sight, and the thoughtfulness that it signaled.   “Your clothes are there,” Tony added, something almost like nervousness shifting under his voice.
“Sorry.  I seem to be doing this all wrong.  I didn’t actually know Howard all that well,” Steve continued.  “He was there for Rebirth and then a bit during the War, but…” Steve shrugged.  “We weren’t exactly close.”
There was a distant thrumming in Tony’s ears, a wave crashing over and over on the shore.  This was everything he had wanted and not nearly enough.  Hesitantly, he touched his tongue to Steve’s bottom lip and licked inside the wet heat of Steve’s mouth, just for a second.
“Because it’s very likely I’ll never in my life get to use these words in this combination again, want to tell me what colors you’re mixing for my cock?” Kirk asked as he reached to pull the comforter around his waist.
“He’s giving us the money, no matter what,” Steve reminded him.
“Doing what, exactly?” Steve pressed, taking a long look at the room.
“Really, it’s—it’s late, and.  You can’t even really—it’s not—it’s not clear, with the lights, so you can’t—you can’t see much from here.  So,” Tony said, stumbling over the words like his mouth had marbles in it.
“Great.  Ellis it is, then,” Steve agreed with a quick nod, like they had settled something, and, in Steve’s mind, Tony supposed they had, which, honestly, made Tony want to roll up the newspaper and whack him on the nose with it until he learned.
“It still—no. He never even met my father. He wanted to, but I told him--” Tony stopped. “And sure, that's red-flag-in-front-of-a-bull level of setting myself up, but...they weren't even in the same part of the country, for fuck's sake! Not like Howard was going to take Steve's calls from the God-damned liquor store payphone he used because he couldn't afford an actual phone.”
Also, the characters of Tony's guards, Josiah and Peran, are from Chibisquirt's outstanding fic inspired by The Prize, which you can find in the Related Works linked below.
--but, he was, and so he let himself.
Sitting here with Tony now, he wasn’t sure why he had been so unsettled before.  He had stumbled into Tony’s home, after all, it was reasonable that anyone would be wary of such an intrusion, so if Tony seemed a bit odd, that was likely why.  Besides, what kind of soldier would Steve be if he wanted to run from a simple offer of hospitality?  And was it really so unbelievable that Tony would know of him?  The village wasn’t very big, after all, and if Tony truly lived here, then he likely knew most everyone and knew about their lives, just the way Steve did.
“I think I should accompany my son, Agent Coulson.  They still aren’t…I mean, this isn’t…” Howard trailed off, clearly not ready to announce to the lobby that this whole thing was still as up in the air as a Macy’s balloon.
But the farm had been some kind of turning point, when he’d been forced to acknowledge that he had seen his friends dead or dying, his world falling to destruction, but it had been Steve’s death that he had felt, that left him carved out and gutted and desperate enough to risk everything.  He hadn’t told Pepper.  Just Fury, really, and even that had been the barest sketch of what it had felt like.  What was there to say?  I saw the end of the world, and it looked a hell of a lot like losing him?  It would take a lot more than an apology farm to fix that.  Tony sighed and rested a hand over his eyes for a moment, letting his head fall back against the bulkhead.
“I’m sure,” Steve replied.
“I must go to a meeting.  Trade agreement. Can’t be helped. Obie will pitch a fit if I miss another one. Terrible timing, I know,” the King said with a grimace.  He looked away from Steve, then, scratched a finger at his forehead where the skin creased and furrowed with a frown and let out a long sigh.  “I’m going to think about you, like this,” he said, tracing a finger down Steve’s thigh.  “In my bed, waiting for me so blissed out you can hardly think.  It’s a good look on you, by the way.  When I get back, I’ll take you.  Take my time and get you loose and begging for it on my fingers, then fill you up, the way you need.  And you’ll think about that while I’m gone, too, but you won’t touch yourself.”
“You can’t eat that stuff,” Tony said derisively.
Couple of things that might be of interest only to me:  Rhodey's background in this is loosely (very loosely) based on Robert Smalls, who is quite interesting and was, in fact, one of the first African-American Navy Captains.  The orphan trains that are mentioned in regards to Peter leaving New York were a real thing, as was the idea that you lost your kid if you couldn't pay for their upkeep at a boarding house type situation.  The living conditions mentioned were actually worse in reality.  Pigs in the street in New York City was a legit thing!  Irish kids not being afforded a formal education was also true. The song Steve sings was, in fact, an Army marching song during the Civil War.  I found it in the Congressional archives.  There are a lot of little details like that in here. I found the 19th century history to be pretty interesting for Steve's background.   As for Tony, William Hale was a British inventor working on rocketry around that time, so it seemed like something that could be good for Tony to be involved in.  Underwater mines were stationary, unlike our torpedoes of today (though they were called torpedoes, but for consistency's sake, I didn't  use that term).  Submersibles existed, though were in limited use, but I'm sure Tony would have improved on everything. I can't think of everything, but suffice to say, I do a lot of research for fics, even when they are an excuse to write tentacle porn!
If you are interested, there is a Steve POV for their first meeting from the earlier story in my Thank You Fics.
“I—yes.  Nothing fancy, I know.  I’m not an artist, really.  Just thought, maybe.  Since we talked about it,” Steve said in a stuttering, halting voice that cracked a bit on the end.
“Hard to top the image of Steve sleeping on Barnes’ couch with a giant bear, sorry Tones, gotta give Barnes that one,” Rhodey acknowledged.  “Okay, so both the idiots are giant, sentimental saps.”
“Why did you break up?  If you don’t mind me asking,” Steve said quickly.
“You’re really, really bad at that,” Skinny Steve observed, then started coughing into his hand.  Tony reached down and patted his back, where his shoulder bones jutted out like wings.
“You don’t know him.  You don’t know a damned thing about him,” Steve ground out. “This is all your twisted way of justifying what you do, but no more.  You’re done here.  Whatever happens, Tony won’t allow it.  He’ll
“What did you say?” the King bit out as his hand stilled.  Steve swallowed.  Blinked.  What had he said?  Something wrong, obviously, but his mind was too hazy to latch onto anything.
Over the curve of his mount’s back, he could see grooms rush over to help the other men, taking the reins and beginning to unsaddle the horses, checking hooves for stones or damaged horseshoes and seeing to cooling down the animals before getting them into stalls. He didn’t need to turn to know that Happy waited behind him.
it’s the lack of oxygen to my brain,” Tony grinned.  “No, no, it’s hot. Definitely hot. Come here,” Tony said, tugging at Steve’s shirt.
“Here,” Steve said, pulling a palm-sized, black leather box out of the back pocket of the car seat in front of him. “Thought you might like something new.  For tonight.”
“I think your company’s just about right. Don’t you, Ty?” Preston said with a slight smirk, mouth pursing like he was considering something.
(See the end of the chapter for
He didn’t say any of those things.
Underneath him, Tony suddenly felt the table shift. The not-gel moved around and reformed again, elevating his lower body and lifting his legs into the air before wrapping around them again in warm, soft sleeves.  It felt a bit like one of those massage chairs, Tony thought, but softer, and all around him. Distantly, he thought that something about this should worry him, but the thought wafted away like smoke and was gone. This was right.  This was good. The gift is life. He closed his eyes and sighed deeply. The not-gel prickled warmly against his skin, like a million tiny brushes, except that wasn’t the right way to describe it, either. He couldn’t really think of a way, but it felt good. Wonderful, in fact.  Everything felt good.
I don’t want this.
“Jesus fucking Christ,” Tony said, his hand losing its groove and coming to wrap again around Steve’s cock, pumping harder now as Tony ground down against him.  Steve watched in awe as Tony’s hand left his cock just long enough to pinch the head of Tony’s own cock while Tony grimaced and took a deep breath, before returning to stroke Steve’s length again, and just the knowledge that Tony was so ready just from that was enough to send Steve over the edge, body spasming as he came into Tony’s hand with a strangled cry.  Tony was still breathing heavily, his erection bouncing off his belly as Steve’s body finally settled.  He heard Tony squirt more lube into his hand and then felt a slick finger dip down to probe his entrance, pressing in all the way in one swift motion.  He growled lowly, felt his body stretching down, seeking something.
“Tony—“ Steve started, then swallowed back the rest of what he was going to say.  Mostly because he didn’t know what he was going to say, so he said something else instead.  “What about your speech?  Is this going to…be a problem?”
“Hello, Tony Stark. I trust you are well,” the alien said.
. He didn’t have to worry about anything else. Didn’t have to think about anything else. Just this. His cock and this hole, that was all that existed in this room.
“When my people were little more than mongers, scraping ore out of the Ehrmon, we worshiped Hephtan.  The forger of souls. He welded the universe together and shaped people the way we worked metal, sometimes with too many flaws to handle the pressure and heat of the fire, sometimes with just enough to be strong. No surprise that we made a god in our image, I suppose, but the part I always liked to hear the most, when I could get my tutors to tell me anything about such things, was that Hephtan was said to sometimes forge two souls from the same metal.  Two souls, forever bonded, Steve, and I know--I
“Oh. Oh, Tony,ugh, please, just…gah, Tony,” Steve murmured, head tossing from side to side and eyes glazed wide, staring down at Tony’s mouth wrapped around his cock.  Tony thought about the way Steve’s hole had cradled his cock last night, and closed his eyes with a groan, taking as much of Steve’s length as he could handle.  Steve’s hip bucked once, then twice, his balls tightening and stomach muscles clenching.  Steve’s hands wound in Tony’s hair, not pulling, but strong enough to hold Tony steady.  Tony felt the hot gush of come flow down his throat, the shout of Tony’s name falling from his lips.  He swallowed around Steve’s cock, the taste of him filling Tony’s mouth.
“I did,” Steve replied.
“You know what I am, don’t you,” Tony said, making it a statement instead of a question.  “Say it. Name me for what I am. It will be alright, I promise you.  Believe it or not, I would never hurt you. Not in the way that you are, no doubt, currently imagining. Say it, Steve.”
“Hey, J, you with me, buddy?” Tony asked as the helmet settled into place and the HUD flashed on.
Howard is a real dick here.
Tony went still, then stepped out of the flow and sank down into the pool, his eyes on Steve. “I would like that,” he said, his voice barely a whisper over the sound of the water falling into the pool. “Very much, I think.”
“Look at me,” Tony whispered hoarsely.
That may or may not have been true.  He rather hoped it was.  Let them worry.  Whether it was worry over Tony’s welfare or worry that Tony had screwed up things badly enough that Steve was pissed at them, it all amounted to the same small, useless bit of payback he could hope to get.
“I’ve sent my best trained concubines in droves, Lord Sitwell, with little success.  Perhaps it’s time to try a…different..approach,” Zola said.  “You should avail yourself of our comforts, Lord Sitwell.  I know it has been a long and trying journey,” Zola offered.  “Go on, then, get him inside,” Zola added to the guards, jerking his head over his shoulder towards the building behind him.
“I couldn’t do this without you,” Tony replied.  “Well, okay, I could, but the truth is…” he trailed off, looking down for a moment before raising his gaze to Steve.  “The truth is, I can.  I can do it by myself, Steve, but I’m better at it with you here.  I’ve been so…consumed with getting these people. Fixing what I—what was wrong.  But, then you show up, and—and maybe it’s about more than that.  Maybe I could be more than the guy who cleaned up his mistakes.”
“Well, Bruce got a into a bit of pique when the Thai food place brought Steve Pad See Ew instead of Pad Woon Sen, and so, while we had the chance, I thought it would be a good idea to give Hulk something baby-sized and crushable, just to see what happened,” Clint called out from the back of the sofa where he was perched, watching Hulk sit in the corner, cradling an oblong, green melon in his hands and peering down at it in confusion before shaking his massive head back and forth and tossing it into the far wall, splattering it into fruit shrapnel.
“Tony,” Steve beseeched.  “Please.  Don’t do this.  I know you are angry, but—” he stopped.  Felt his neck stiffen.  A part of him wanted to beg Tony to listen to him.  A part of him thought that would work, too, though it wasn’t strategy, not really.  He wouldn’t, though.  Not for this.  Not to be
“Let me guess, you must be Bucky,” Tony said, his voice clipped with some strange, false friendly tone that Steve had never heard from him before.
He didn’t sleep.  It was okay.
“I--” Steve began, glancing over towards the balcony where the same grayish light that covered the castle and gorge seeped in through a slit in the curtains. Was it late? Had he missed a whole day on his bizarre trek up here? It was hard to say. “I couldn’t impose.”
“Not to my face,” Steve replied, mouth lifting up at the corners.  “Present company excepted.  Present company tends to say whatever goes through his head, matter of fact.”
Tony crooked his neck to look up at Steve, his eyes already drooped low, breathing evening out, though his arm tightened under Tony at the movement.  “Words good,” Tony whispered.
“Hey,” Steve mumbled, still half-asleep.  Brock was already showered and dressed, and bright light was coming in the window, so it must be later than he thought.
“They would not touch you,” Steve cut in with the same delusional certainty.  “If you want to learn how to drive, I don’t see how it’s anyone’s business but mine.”
“I know about keeping the government’s secrets, Director.  But, surely, Anthony would have to know before agreeing to the Bonding,” Steve said. “Otherwise—"
,” Tony went on. “Maybe he calls out my name at a certain critical moment, and oh, that’s awkward. Should I use my real name?  I could be, like, I don’t know...Kirk or something.”
“I can’t,” the boy protested weakly.  “My stomach…I’m too...if I eat, I’ll get sick.  If I get sick, Master Zola won’t send me tonight, and I don’t go, he’ll punish me or sell me or…I don’t know.  I have to go.   I have to do good,” Cam said, running his hands through his hair.  “I’m not going to do good, am I?  Oh, God, I’m going to mess up, I know it.  I know I am.  I am.  I’m…you said it was okay, right?  With the King, I mean?  You said it was alright,” he rushed out in an anxious, hitching voice.
He didn’t want to ruin this, and it suddenly felt like a cracked piece of glass, barely held together and just waiting for any pressure to make it fall apart.  What if he told Steve the truth about his role in the weapons sales, and Steve blamed him?  Hated him? What if he didn’t, and Steve blamed him and hated him for
“Truly shocking,” Rhodes nodded to Tony with a falsely serious frown. “I’m shocked. This is what my face looks like when I’m shocked.”
Nothing-too-you-know ended up being a diaphanous, sand-colored, flowing material that was completely open at the sides, but draped down his front and back from beaded layers of fringe that circled his neck and shoulders.  A bracelet for his wrist.  Matching circles of gold at his ankles, with chains of tiny twists of gold and brightly colored beads that hooked in a ring around his big toe.
This is set in "present day" in VaguelyMedievalishLandVille. Please do not point out "historical inaccuracies".
“Are these really necessary?” Zola asked, fingering the chain that ran from Steve’s collar down to the ones that secured his hands.  “Has he tried to run?” Zola said, glancing down at the shackles around Steve’s ankles.
Stark. Had he not put aside your differences and rushed off to your aid, I may not have realized my error while there was still a part of me that cared about truth.”
“Is someone going to help him?” Bruce asked, turning in his saddle to watch Clint’s back as he galloped off.
“The ride was fine. Odd,” Steve admitted with a rueful grimace, “but fine. Cam was rather taken with the camel once he got used to it and determined that he would not, in fact, fall off to be left for dead in the sands where his bones would be scavenged by sand beetles.”
“I called Ms. Romanov, but I didn’t think she was going to talk to you,” Steve explained.  “I know you’re busy, and we hadn’t planned anything.  I don’t want to bother you, really.  I just—I—“
“Because neither of us like to be called on our own shit when it’s so much easier to call someone else on theirs,” Steve offered with a slight roll of his eyes.  “I should’ve told you about Afghanistan,” he conceded after a beat.  “At least so you weren’t blindsided by it.  I’m sorry.  That was selfish.  I wasn’t thinking about how—how it might be for you to hear it when you weren’t expecting it.”
Rhodey went quiet, though Tony could feel the weight of the other man’s presence through the phone.  Tony’s chest tightened.  He had to resist the urge to rub the heel of his hand into the reactor, where it thrummed between his ribs.  His stomach rolled, clenched.  His eyes prickled at the corners, so he rubbed at them, then blinked up at the ceiling.
There was a keypad entry lock on the door. He'd installed it himself, of course. He'd known what he was doing. It was to keep
“That’s not—that’s a wildly inaccurate description of, well, everything,” Tony objected loudly.  “I just thought Steve—when he’s Steve again—would feel more comfortable if, you know, it was one of you.  Or Bruce.  He’s a doctor.  I could call Pepper.  She is also an assassin,” Tony said, making a face at Natasha, who raised her eyebrow and narrowed her eyes in answer.
“Did you know that Edison had his own glassblowing shed to make light bulbs?” Tony asked.  “And Galileo had to have the glass coils for his thermometer specially crafted.  True story.”
“It was implied,” Tony shrugged, then flashed a smile at Steve.  Pepper rolled her eyes.
“I—you said---you said I should tell you what I wanted, so.  I thought we could try that.  If you wanted, I mean,” Steve said with a small shrug.
“Dad always drove when it was him and mom in the car.  Always.  Even when he’d had too much…even when he shouldn’t.  Made Jarvis nuts,” Tony replied.
He ate a bit more, his appetite waning as his thoughts wandered.  Finally giving up, Steve dug his sketchbook and charcoals out and settled into one of the overstuffed chairs by the fireplace.  Slowly, Bucky’s face in that moment when he was staring at Nat across a snow-covered glen while seemingly indifferent to being pelted with snowballs started to take shape.
“Is this—should I—“ Steve stammered, feeling Tony’s cock throb, hot and hard, in his hand.
“Okay, I’ll bite,” Steve started with a laugh.
“I’ll take point this time,” Tony grunted.
“You’re him,” the woman said, tilting her head to the side and smiling widely, though it wasn’t exactly a welcoming smile, more a knowing one that did not quite reach her eyes.  “The one they are calling Raj’Inama.”
“I still need something I can call you,” Tony reminded him.  “I mean, long way back to Earth, right?”
“No,” Tony said, because he didn’t, but his Alpha had asked, and he couldn’t lie, even if sometimes, like now, he wanted to.
Five Stars.
Tony could do that.  Take all of that away and replace it with tenderness and caring, warmth and passion, brilliant, beautiful things that Steve wanted to hold onto more than almost anything else.
The Omega who was now yelling at him.
“Twenty-eight!” Steve shouted as yet another blow fell atop that one.  It was worse the second time, and he wouldn’t have thought that possible. His body screamed out a protest, but the pain and pleasure  just kept rolling over and over each other, picking up steam, as if hurtling down a hill, then slamming into him, breaking apart and sending jagged lines of sensation all over his body.  He thought he would break apart with it, and clung to the number in his head like a lifeline.  “Twenty-nine!” he yelled, then curled his face into the bed as he waited for the last.
The world seemed to move in slow motion, and then, as if someone hit a button, it sped up, so fast that Steve felt like he was reeling from some unknown force pressing down on him.  He heard a crash, and looked down, only to realize he had dropped one of the bottles he had been dutifully putting into the recycling bin that Brock steadfastly refused to use.  The air rushed out of his lungs.  His vision danced, a veil of black lace falling over his eyes.  Then it all coalesced, at once, a single pinprick, and he stared at Brock.
Tony started to chime in, but Steve cut him off.
“I’m sorry,” Steve said.  “I wanted to tell you, so many times, but…”
“You two are weirdly co-dependently adorable, you know that, right?” Tony questioned lightly, a smile in his voice.  “Fine, Bert, let’s go find Ernie. I’m starving, anyway. Rhodey better have ordered me a cheeseburger or I’m giving him back my half of the friendship necklace.”
He trudged resolutely to the bathroom to clean up and leaned heavily against the counter, sparing a glance at his flushed face in the mirror before turning away with a grimace.  So, obviously, this had to stop.  He’d never taken the easy way out before, never put his own needs or wants above what was best for a friend or for the team, and yet here he was, jerking himself off to thoughts of Tony again like he hadn’t just spent hours in the gym trying to work that desire out through a punching bag.  But, enough was enough. This stopped now.  The benefit was tomorrow night.  He and Tony were the only Avengers that would be in attendance, and he could spend the evening repairing his relationship with Tony, or at least trying to start to do so.  He gathered himself with a deep sigh and headed back to bed, eventually managing to fall into a fitful sleep.
“That was not at all what I was going to suggest,” Tony grumbled as he squeezed the sponge out and let the water dribble down over Steve’s neck and shoulders.
“Do you want to go,” Jarvis asked evenly. “It’s okay if you don’t, Tony.  I won’t think any less of you, you know that.”
. About how watching the—what did Tony call him? Giant Purple People Eater, that was it. Watching the Giant Purple People Eater stab Tony with part of his own suit. How Steve felt it as if it sliced through his own gut. How terrified he had been. What it was like placing Tony in Cho’s cradle and spending the next five hours praying that he would be alright. Hearing the news that Tony was out of the woods. The relief, the utter
“Tony stay,” Anto repeated.  “Steve stay. Tony stay. Good.”
“See that we are not disturbed, will you, Josiah?” Tony asked, his voice low.
“You think!?!” Tony demanded with a grimace as the stars in front of him spun and danced and debris floated like a trail of very deadly breadcrumbs.  “See if you can reroute the power and pin down--wait--wait,” he broke off, looking out the window as his stomach heaved and rolled against the forces propelling the ship into a hard, diving spin.  “Can you lock down the stabilizers, J? Feels like I’m on the world’s least fun Gravitron.”
“Thank you, Bruce,” Steve added.
. The thought slithered into his head, uninvited.
“Yeah,” Tony said after a beat where Steve held his breath.  “Yeah, I’m sure.”
“Excellent choice,” the waiter assured him with a nod.
The dishes. Oh, Tony thought dumbly, staring down at the table with a strange sort of focused fascination. Help with the dishes. He wasn't sure if he should laugh or cry or if there was really a difference any more.
Then…there had been an island…had the Avengers fought an island?  He scanned the HUD feed, and found a rather large delivery order from Le Bernadin waiting for confirmation, thirty-two emails from real estate agents promising an island paradise any Omega would love, a spectacularly huge bill from Neiman’s,  a somewhat concerning list of overdose information for various drugs and a note about two solid rocket boosters possibly located in Novosibirsk.  What the holy hell had he been doing while all hormoned-up?  He was pretty sure he didn’t want to know the exact details.  Embrace the fugue.
Jokes, seemingly casual offers, easy ways out, these were a safety net for Tony, Steve realized.  A get out of jail free card in case of rejection.  Tony’s affection was both boundless and doled out in careful, contained increments, offered in isolation and easily retracted or demurred.  It wasn’t as if Steve couldn’t see why, watching the tapes.  Tony had grown up learning that everything he did, every offer, every suggestion, every spark of vulnerability, was a minefield of risk with very little reward. Though he wanted it so badly, that reward.  Time and time again, he took the risk for it, didn’t he?
The man looked Steve up and down, rolled his eyes and glanced over at Tony with a look that conveyed a sense of noticing a bad smell in the room and not wanting to mention it.
Finally, Tony tore his mouth away.  His lips were red and swollen, still wet from Steve’s, his hair askew and his eyes so dark they were nearly black. I did that to him, Steve thought.  Steve could feel his cock judder in Tony’s hand in response. I did that. I made him feel like that. Amazed wonder and desperate want coursed through him.  He wasn’t sure which one felt better.
“Steve, he’s…I know I said nice, but nice.  Like, just…good, I guess,” Tony began, then flattened his mouth at the simplicity of the words.  “God, I know how that sounds, but…it’s different. With him.  It
Tony heard sing through his head in Howard's familiar voice and snorted. Yeah, well, Dad, there's a ten-digit keypad entry on my garage that says differently.
Cam was waiting.  Steve stood there for a long moment.  He closed his eyes and tilted his head all the way back, then opened them and looked at the ceiling.  He honestly had no idea what to feel.  Bewilderment.  Frustration Amazement. Anger.  Amusement.  It all warred at once inside his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was…I liked it, Tony,” Steve assured him, catching Tony’s gaze for a moment before dipping his head back to his arms with a rush of heat to his cheeks.  Liked it, he thought. Small words, for something far grander.  He didn’t know how to express what he felt about last night.  It had hurt and felt good.  He’d been not scared, but…concerned, he decided after a moment’s thought.  Concerned about it.  The chains, so like and unlike the ones he wore on the road here from Rumlow’s, and yet completely different.  Being held down, but in a way that felt like being cherished instead of being a prisoner.  The…thing Tony put in him, how full he’d felt, how invaded and open and taken, the same thing and not the same thing as when Zola’s overseer used something similar to open him for Tony’s use.  He didn’t quite understand how one thing could be experienced entirely differently, but there it was.  Tony, he supposed.  Tony was the difference.
How much the last few years had meant to him. What it felt like when Tony somehow tracked him down in some roadside diner in nowhere, Kansas and told him there was a place for him at the Tower when he was ready. That movie nights were one of the best parts of his life after the ice. That he liked sitting down in the workshop and talking about nothing, or just watching Tony work. How deeply grateful he was for how much Tony helped with Bucky, when God knew he didn’t owe Steve anything, let alone
Two hours or so later, Steve heard loud voices and thumping footfalls echoing from the stairwell outside the apartment.  Brock’s key scraped in the lock, and he, Jack, Griff, Mitchell and a couple of other guys Steve recognized from Brock’s former unit spilled inside, arms full of beer and various snacks.  Steve sighed and tucked his pencils and sketchbook away.  Looked like it was time for a party.
Tony let out a surprised bark of laughter, his eyes sparkling.  He had nice eyes, Steve noticed, then cleared his throat at the stray thought. “The rare man of few words.  Don’t worry, I have enough for both of us. We’ll get along great. Why Vegas?”
“Was the mission really fine?” Tony asked cautiously.  Should’ve sent the rat through the minefield first, he thought, but noooooo, let’s just drive over it with a tank.  Good plan.
“Get. Out.” Tony’s voice sounded like a whip-crack in the room.
“Right. Home.  You’ll really take me back to Earth?” Tony asked.
“Sleep,” Tony muttered with a sigh.  Steve wasn’t sure if he was telling himself that or Steve, but it seemed to work for both of them.  He fell into a fitful sleep, dreamed of slipping into a dark, cold void of nothingness, and woke to light filtering in the windows feeling like he hadn’t truly slept at all.
“Yeah?” Tony asked in a breathy, slurry voice that almost didn’t sound like his own.
“Night!” Happy replied, then opened the limo’s moonroof enough to give them a small wave as he put the limo into a three-point turn to get out of the driveway.
He hefted the folders closer to his chest.
“Hello Mr. Stark, I’m Captain Rogers,” Steve said to his reflection.  He cleared his throat and stood tall again, adjusting his jacket in the mirror.   Too formal, he thought.
Even with Pepper, he had needed his time.  Sure, he had used some of that time to squirrel away a legion of secret suits, but he still thought the habit was overall largely a healthy one.  Everyone needed their own space, after all.  Maybe he was just used to Cap’s presence at this point  Before the whole fuck buddy thing got going, they had actually spent a lot of time together, which, yeah, that sounded messed up even in his own head.  He felt his hand stroking absently over the back of his neck and forced it to the table, fingers tapping lightly against the hard surface.
Half an hour later, Steve was standing outside Brock’s door, ready to knock when the door was jerked open and Brock stood on the other side, his face a mask of accusation.
“Hand,” Steve replied in that same flat, tired tone from earlier that Tony was starting to find incredibly grating.
“Tony…” Coulson began, brows drawing together in deep lines.  “It isn’t any of my business.  But, if I may…if even half the stuff I’ve heard about you is true, you’re going to do great.  I’m not saying it will be easy.  And I’m sure you’re…overwhelmed right now.  Just…give it some thought, okay?  This could be a great opportunity for you.  For a lot of reasons.”
“Yes,” Steve replied and looked down at his lap where his hands fidgeted.  He pulled them apart and gripped the arms of the chair instead, then finally raised his eyes back to the King’s. The King was staring at him, eyebrows lifted high, a challenging, sardonic look tugging half of his mouth into a smile.  His eyes were gleaming, as if pleased, though the same confounded look appeared after a moment.
He got in the suit.
“On my way,” Tony promised.  “I have some ideas about the whole clean energy thing and how to tackle the Board—well, Obie, in particular—that I’d like to run by you.”
“Beautiful,” Tony murmured, almost absently, his eyes still locked on where his thumb still held Steve’s mouth.  A shiver cooled Steve’s skin, even as warmth bloomed deep inside.  Hesitantly, he flicked the tip of his tongue against Tony’s thumb and watched the King’s eyes darken to black pools in the low light, his mouth parting, a shaky breath rattling through his chest. “My treasure,” Tony said softly, voice thick and ragged as he dropped his hand from Steve’s mouth down to twist the fabric around Steve’s cock where it jutted between them.  He stroked his hand up and down over Steve’s cock through the soft fabric, and it was like lightning across Steve’s skin, rough and gentle at the same time.  His hips jerked, seeking Tony’s hand.  “Let me take care of you.”
“Siri, when will Steve come home?” Tony asked around a sigh.
The creature lightly slapped two tentacles on top of the water, as if to add an element of agreement to Steve’s admission that he had been wrong about the building process,  then sank down until only its eyes shone above the water, but for all its bluster, they were bright with mirth, Steve could tell. It really was extraordinarily expressive.
.  He’d been playing the long game, and that meant a patsy.  Someone to take the fall if everything went sideways one day.  And who better than a dead man? At least, Tony was fairly sure that had been the plan right up until the Ten Rings decided they wanted to get their weapons direct instead of having to wait on Prime shipping or whatever their beef with Obie had been.
“So, should I just bend over as soon as we walk in or wait until after we introduce ourselves?” Tony rasped out.  He could feel panic snaking its way up his spine, making him jittery, his heart racing, thumping loudly in his hears until it started to down out everything else.
“Oh, that.  It’s really not a big deal.  I don’t even have much there, just some clothes and shaving stuff.  I meant to get my sketchbook, but,” Steve shrugged.
“So, this regard…how….ah, how do I…I mean…should I, like, I don’t know…maybe…he listened to you, so…” Tony stammered.  “I mean, let’s face it J, if property destruction is the way to the man’s heart, I’m completely down with that, but…”
Which brought the whole convoluted thing back to it just being simpler to start making a plate to take down to Tony. Bruce just handed him a tray with a small quirk of his mouth, bless the man.
“Ms. Potts is rather stridently insisting that I not listen to anything you say,” JARVIS informed him coolly. “I feel that I must defer to her in this circumstance.”
I thought you meant make the bad guys pay, Tony thought numbly as his fingers rubbed idly over the reactor.  I thought that’s what you meant about not wasting my life, and I was doing it—I
“That wasn’t…” Steve started, then sighed and shook his head.  Why not?  “Yeah, I’ve thought of you.  Who hasn’t? I’m saying, I thought you—that is, you never struck me as the kind of guy who’d go for a fella like me.  You’re always so…you always
“You are not going mad,” Tony insisted, the words hissing through his teeth with a startling vehemence.
