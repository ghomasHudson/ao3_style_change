Bathed in the moonlight his skin looked almost translucent, like he was going to merge with the moon. Dean wanted to touch him, but he seemed so fragile that he had the impression he could almost see his true form. Dean didn’t know how he could feel so overwhelmed by something.
He felt really stupid.  Standing there, all his guards down, barefoot, in his boxers and his T-shirt, just a water in his hand.
. Directly looking at him. A fond expression on his face, crinkly blue eyes, a slight smile on his lips. „Hello, Dean. I hope you had a good rest. It’s beautiful here. I was just listening to the chattering seagulls. They really have a lot to tell.”
Most of the time he did not even like it. But when he was younger the money was worth it and needed though.
They didn’t talk much, while they enjoyed the last warming rays of sunshine of the day. It was a quiet beach, but there were still some kids playing and laughing in the distance.
He got up and cast aside the white, light curtains. It was almost full moon. He stood there for a while in awe of the shimmering ups and downs of the waves. It was beautiful.
He just realizes how he had unintentionally started to move his hips in small circles, pushing himself closer to Cas. He feels a bit aroused and can feel the typical morning wood in his boxers. But they haven’t even kissed yet. And he is a bit afraid to do so. It would change something between them, that they could not take back.
His eyes flickered over him. He looked good in his old clothes. Briefly Cas's coat crossed his mind, that now laid (perfectly folded) on one side of his bed in the bunker. He had forced him to leave it behind for the holiday, because „Come on Cas, leave the damn coat! You will look like a pedophile at the beach. Take some of my stuff. It’s time for you to change into something lighter.”
They searched in each other’s faces for some sort of certainty. Finally, Dean broke it with a slight lopsided smile and an honest nod. “Yes.” He whispered.
“And now we should stop talking”, he moves a finger over Cas’ lips, “And you stop thinking so much...” He emphatically lowers his lips to Cas’ and kisses him with fervor.
And when Dean dares a look, he can see him, his eyes wide open. Taking every inch of him in. Eyes him like a statue. Kisses his skin like warm rays of sunshine. And it is slow but big and powerful. It is something he never thought he would enjoy. But he does. Nothing he had ever experienced. And he lets his head roll to the side. Watches him as he unravels him. Not even he himself has ever spent so much time discovering his body. Nothing he had ever time or space for. And with every inch of kissed skin, he hands himself over to Cas.  And it tickles. And they giggle softly. And their eyes meet for a second. And he gently strokes Cas’ hair. And he feels young and innocent. And he can almost forget the faint drum in his head.
A brief unpleasant silence fell over them. Like they both still wanted to say something, but didn’t know how to. That’s when they both got lost in their own thoughts for a moment.
. With Cas he wants to be cozy and stay in bed, lazily watch a movie and cuddle. And he knows Cas long enough. He knows he can trust him. Cas put him back together, saw everything of him, every memory. He knows lot about him and still stayed around all these years. With Cas he does not need to be afraid. He knows he can be himself. He can be. But it is hard because he never learnt how to do that. And maybe Cas is even the only one he ever felt he could be totally honest with. He would never look at him differently and he would never behave differently around him. He loves Cas unconditionally. And he knows Cas does love him, too. But he has to learn to accept that he does.
The clink of the bottle was simultaneously accompanied by some noises from the kitchen. Eileen and Cas must have been back.
And Cas is here now. Soft and gentle. And that is something that breaks him. Because suddenly he wishes he would just be flipped over and get fucked and get it over with. He hates himself for that. Cas would never do that. He knows that. He sees it. He would always be gentle and take his time. Like he does right now. And somehow, he cannot stand that. And there it is. The sudden, plain realization of how deep his own feelings for Cas are rooted inside burst through him and that Cas is the only one who could ever delve into him like that. How he would just let him. How he lets him right now. It scares him.
“I’m sorry. Actually, I’m a bit confused. I’m not exactly sure how to handle homosexual intercourse.”
And Cas hands are stroking his back. He does not go under his shirt. So, he grabs it without further ado and pulls it over his own head. Now he can really feel them: big and broad. And briefly he wishes they would just grab him. But Cas would not just do it without knowing it was okay. And he would not tell him. He could not. He was better to be the one in control anyways.
With a scornful snort Dean grinned at his brother full of regained confidence, “…‘F COURSE I will! I'd be the cool uncle. Showing them cool tricks ‘n stuff.” He chuckled “The one, that’s always drunk and embarrassing at gatherings.
Nothing but survival. And those times he actually liked it, even did it for fun, the feeling afterwards was just not worth it. Except for when he was a demon. Demons did not feel shame or guilt or cared about what other people would think. He had not felt like he was under constant observation. Had not felt the constant fear of being discovered. And he certainly had not felt used and broken. Small and hurt.
After a few moments Sam turned away from his staring and sighed almost silently, as if he had given up the hope Dean would say more. Or maybe the topic was just done for him. But inside Dean it still kept working. He felt like Sam got it, but he had to make sure. Just because he couldn’t stand this conversation a second time. He already felt stupid enough right now. He chewed on his tongue as if to form the words in his mouth properly.
But the more Cas goes down on him, the more he feels an unknown vulnerability. And Instead of the expected arousal he feels some sort of panic pooling in his chest. He watches the light breeze from outside playing with Cas’ dark hair. And the drum gets louder. He wants to stay in their bubble. But he looks around the room and his sight loses some of the cloudiness. It’s a moment that feels like he gets sucked out of a dream. Everything is sharper again and he cannot stop his mind from wandering in other directions. Not when Cas takes all this time. Nothing pounding on him but his thoughts.
He gives Cas a kiss and suddenly remembers something. “I forgot to tell you, but I bought us matching Hawaiian shirts. Man, I hope Sam is wearing his already.”
And they kiss long and deep and it gets hotter as he starts to grind on him, Cas moving against him. Their cocks are pressed together, and the friction makes him dizzy. He just wants to lose those pants. But he guesses Cas would not make a move on them, so he tries to wiggle them off without getting too much detached from him. When his ankles are finally free, he presses down on him even harder. And he hopes it is okay what he is doing and not too fast. But Cas does not complain. He would though, wouldn't he?
with Cas?” It didn’t came out as nonchalant as he had originally intended to. But at least he would get it.
“You know that I don’t have much experience. So, if I do something or say something, that you don’t like or that is wrong. You have to tell me, okay? I want you to tell me.”
It is an ache he had not felt in a long time. It triggers something in him and for a brief moment he loses himself in a fleeing thought. For a brief moment he stops what he is doing but then he shakes his head and continues. And when he touches Cas, he forgets about it. He can hear him moan softly. And when he looks up, he catches Cas watching him. Watching what he is doing. And he moves up to kiss him on the lips again.
“You deserve it…”, Dean said and nodded a few times in approval to his own words and drank another sip of his beer.
Dean laughs. “Very wise of you.” But somehow it takes something of his chest. He takes a look to the window. “What do you say we schedule another party for tonight? Let us start with something easier like going to the beach together. You’ve ever took a swim in the ocean?”
Cas did as told and laid down besides Dean. Their legs got tangled almost automatically. Dean chuckled a bit embarrassed, his heart still pounding heavy. But the awkward tension passed as they found each other’s eyes.
") or he had needed it like this. Being manhandled, getting fucked hard and nasty, letting go of control for a moment. Just stepping out of himself. Never shelter and protection. Just something primeval to cope. To deal with what he had to see every damn day.
He closes his eyes, heavily breathing. "I don't know”, he says honestly. More tears cut their way down his cheeks. He can feel Cas' hand stroking his hair gently and soothingly.
Something tightens in his chest and then bursts open loud and bright. Vibrantly hovering over them, covering them up. Leaving nothing but them.
Cas tilts his head a bit and frowns. “Dean, I’m not judging you. I’m just trying to understand how I know what to do. So that I can make you feel good and comfortable.”
And now his words hovered between them, loud and heavy and he couldn’t take them back. That’s why he never said them before, because Castiel was an Angel and didn’t feel things like a human. And Dean was so stupid to even ask those things. And he was so stupid because he didn’t want anything else from his life, then cuddling under a fucking blanket with this stupid Angel in front of him. But he never, ever got what he wanted. Bold to assume it would happen this one time.
They chuckle, looking at each other. It releases a tension that he only notices now that it is gone. “So, our own pace, hm?” He moves a little and props onto one elbow to have a better look at Cas, “But Cas… I know you. My pace is not our pace. You have to tell me what you want. What you need...”
“What?”, he is caught off-guard, “So?” he asks somewhat feisty, his head flinching back a few inches.
Dean flinches. His heart stops for a second. Did he change his mind? “…Yeah?”, he responds hesitantly.
Sam and Dean preferred the porch downstairs for their first afternoon here. It had direct access to the beach and Dean couldn’t wait to feel the sand between his toes or take a swim in the ocean tomorrow or even try a fresh coconut and mix it with some fancy alcohol.
But somehow, he felt relieved and the knot already smaller. And he smiled a little while he mumbled an “I know" into his bottle, his head still lowered.
They stayed still. It was weird that Cas didn’t breathe, but the steady sound of the waves gave Dean almost the impression he was.
Dean moved his head, as if he was still weighing his options. “Nah”, he said eventually, “I’ve tried that. I’m- It’s different now.”
“Man, I already feel like this will be our new tradition. Imagine coming back here, once a year. Everybody together. You and Eileen with your kids and your dog", his mouth gushed out, before his brain had any time to think.
He does not want to let go. He does not want to have to explain himself. He wants to stay like this forever. And they stay like this for a while. Cas even tries to cover them with the blanket again. And Dean does not know what to feel or to think. And he doesn’t want to feel or think. He wants it to be just easy for once.
Obviously, Sam and Eileen wanted to share a room and since Castiel didn’t sleep and Dean knew he liked to watch TV at nights, he had happily unfurled his stuff in the second one. But of course Castiel could use it anytime he wanted, Dean didn’t mind (anymore). Maybe to use the nice little balcony from where they had a beautiful view over the beach and the ocean.
Dean sighs deeply “You don’t have to plan it. We can just make out a bit and see where it leads us. Just do what you like to do. Sex is supposed to be fun…”, he smiles at him and then lets his gaze hover over to the window, “…But if you would like to know, yes…”, he adds quietly and with his teeth clenched.
The first thing Dean realizes when he wakes up, is the sound of seagulls at the beach. He can feel the daylight through his eyelids, but he is not ready to open them yet. He takes a deep breath instead. It smells like wet sand and salty air. It is already warm, but still cozy under the blanket. He feels his stubbles rubbing over the pillow and Cas‘ arm firmly around his waist as if they hadn’t moved an inch since they went to bed. If he is perfectly honest with himself, he had never slept better and deeper his entire life. And that feels really good.
They stared at each other in the pale moonlight. Dean watched Cas’ familiar face and wanted nothing more, but to touch his skin. He reached out hand to stroke softly over Cas’ cheek. It felt soft and solid and very human, not what the light made pretend. He was curious if Cas perceived touches the same way he did. But he could ask him that another time. “I’m glad you’re here.” He whispered instead. Castiel smiled, he seemed to enjoy the touch.
“I’m-no. It’s just- “, he has to swallow. His throat suddenly feels very dry, “You know… In my experience good things never last long. I’m…” He does not know how to explain it.
A short smile slips onto his lips. “Yeah, you’re right.” He looks at Cas and nods a few times before they fall silent. It’s a bit unsettling and something is still nagging on him. “But… other than that… I don’t know, it’s just weird, man. We’ve been through so much together. And now we're here. Like this. I mean- do you even want this?”
Instead his hand wandered down Cas’ shoulder, down his arm (he had really soft tiny hair) and took is hand. He turned to the side, pulling his arm with him now facing the window and the moon. Cas' body finally pressed against his own. It felt good. It felt like it was just supposed to be like this. It felt real.
“It is.” Dean answered reassuringly in a low voice. His eyes flickered outside for a second and back holding onto Cas’s appearance.
They had suited themselves in two old and comfortable wooden chairs, with some leftover beers of the trunk, while Castiel and Eileen had been heading out for a supply run - because Sam and Dean had been driving in turns without a stop, except for gas and now „deserved a break“.
He dared a quick glance over to his brother, before he set his jaw and leaned forward. He was still fidgeting with the beer in his hands and his eyes now concentrating on the bottleneck.
„Yeah? ... Well, I’m awake now. You can concentrate on me. “ He was going for something cocky and flirty, like he normally did, but it sounds kinda lame and stupid in his ears.
The second chapter is just a result of curious me asking how the story will proceed. I feel like I barely took an active part in writing it. I just kept writing with the flow without overthinking or changing a thing and this is the result.
He can feel his pulse accelerating. He hadn’t been this kind of nervous in years. It was stupid and he was a coward. But Cas. What if he did something wrong and he would leave him? What if they weren’t on the same kind of level here? What if Cas had understood his actions differently, then how he meant them? He felt stupid and his last night decision to ask him to come with him, now felt really irrational and rash. What was he thinking? What did his Dutch courage make him do? That all felt way too easy. What if it was not real? He does not fully trust it yet.
Also Cas already seemed to acquire a liking for walking barefooted, as he didn’t wore any shoes nor socks. And for a second everything felt somehow so familiar, he just wanted to lean over and kiss Cas as Sam did with Eileen in the exact same moment.
“If I don’t understand something, please be patient with me. Sometimes I still have difficulties understanding human behavior.”
And he is just about to wander to Cas hips with his hands as he suddenly feels Cas' arm around his waist. A tight pull. And then at one push he flips him over on his back. “Wha-?", is all he can say in surprise before Cas swings over him. He can feel the mattress bounce under them. His head swings along. He feels dizzy for a split second. He did not expect Cas to do something like that.
Dean let out a chuckled breath. “Of course, dumbass.” And he reaches out his hand to stroke Cas' cheek, “I mean… just if you want to.” He smirks.
To be fair, she didn’t need much persuasive power to convince them, as they were all very tired of shitty and narrow motel rooms. It was a tiny but cute house, though. Two floors. The first just one big room, that functioned as kitchen and living room. And the second: Two master bedrooms and a shared bathroom. It was enough for them. And it was also well furnished - bright and cozy.
Dean ignored him and kept staring into the sunset. Sam could spare this knowing smartass tone in his voice.
“Yeah, yeah I don’t know what else I'd expect.” Sam offered to toast with his bottle, which Dean gladly accepted.
He is so greedy, he pushes Cas' t-shirt up with quick movements and while he is already about to touch his skin, Cas pulls it completely over his head. And he kisses his chest, caresses his side. And he sprawls out on top of him, Cas is solid and present under him. He himself is still wearing his Hot-dog pajama pants, but Cas is only wearing thin boxers and he can clearly feel his cock brushing his thigh while he moves. A wanting ache shots through his body and he moans.
He didn’t know for how long he stood there until he noticed the raging thirst in his throat. He would get a glass of water and then open the door to sleep with the sounds of the waves.
Cas slightly squints his eyes. “Of course, Dean. We’ve been through much together you and I… For me it feels like… Like, it was always meant to be like this.  There was just never the time for it… for us to figure things out. There was always something… well, someone holding us back. But now Dean, we are free to be who we want to be. There is no one anymore to determine our path, but us. And we can choose the pace we want to go in. All I ever wanted is to stay by your side. And if it can be like this, like a partnership, then that is more than I could ever hope for. If it were completely up to me, I would never leave your side again.” Cas looks at him. So serious, so honest. Hearing those words makes him somehow very emotional.  He can feel his own, strong pulse in his chest. Cas hand is still resting on him.
Cas’ eyes study him for a second. “Dean, are you alright? Do you feel uncomfortable?” Cas’ hand moves a bit but stays on his body.  Dean is very aware of its presence. It feels like it radiates some kind of energy through his body that makes him all tingly.
And then everything happens like in slow motion. Cas is on top of him. Dean looks up at him. Cas’ naked chest rises above. His face beautiful, as always. Shines in the light of the morning. And then Cas takes Dean's face between both hands. And he studies him as if awestruck. Full of honest desire, that almost drips from his lips. They just look at each other and Dean can feel himself crumble under the gaze.
“You know... I guess I’ll just never stop hunting. There’ll still be creepy stuff around…” His thumb started to scratch the label of the bottle. He wasn’t really paying attention to it, but it helped to get his sudden jittery body under control. “…I-… you know, I guess I'd just hunt with Cas.”
He really, really wanted to kiss him. But he would save it for the morning. When Castiel was still there under the warm blanket. A fresh and salty ocean breeze through the door, that made the curtains flutter. And he could be really sure, that this wasn’t just a dream but real.
, he thinks. The thought is so pure, it breaks him. He bursts. He lets go. Sobs uncontrollable and helpless like a baby. And Cas his there and holds him. He presses his face into his chest. He can smell him. Earthy and musk and that is something that grounds him. Steadies his heart. Let’s him breathe freer.
He was still thinking about the ocean, when he came downstairs. Different, than expected, the TV was turned off. Castiel was standing still by the window, starring into the night sky, exactly like he did a minute ago. He quietly took a glass of water and walked the few steps to stand beside him. They watched the night together, while Dean drank his water.
“Take your jeans of and come here.” He stopped himself from a smutty grin and instead lifted the blanket a bit as an invitation.
„Well, now I will. Better times Sammy, better times. “ Then he had patted his brother on the back and vanished to his room to pack his stuff.
Dean opened his eyes and stared straight ahead, suddenly extremely awake. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Cas casually fiddling with the dials of the radio, like he didn't just set the world in motion. Dean cleared his throat quietly, unwilling to ruin the softness, the stillness of the moment. When Cas didn't speak again, Dean realized he was actually looking for an answer. Oh, yeah. What was his question, again?
Dean tried his best to forget about the phone call after that night, but forgetting Cas proved to be more difficult now than it ever had been before. Now that the excitement of this new, fantasy-fulfilling life had died down, and the routine into which Dean settled became monotonous, he found himself itching to bolt. He didn’t know what, exactly, he wanted to run towards. The old hunting life? Not really. When Dean said he was tired, he sure as hell meant it. And without Sam, what was the point?
“Please tell me you’ll come back,” Dean said, and this time, he meant it. Sure, Cas was weird in this part of Dean’s life, but now, as Dean looked at Cas—the narrowed eyes, the chapped lips, the head tilt and the fucking sexy jacket and everything that was so undeniably Cas—he never wanted him out of his sight. He’d find a place for Cas. They all would. He’d make sure of it.
“I’m trying very hard not to, Dean. I figured you would like some privacy. Not some…creepy angel watching you sleep, or showing up behind you in the bathroom mirror.” Cas smiled at Dean and outshined the stars.
Dean loved watching Ben’s mind (and mouth) work. He never thought without speaking those ideas aloud, running away with hypotheses and theories a mile a minute, so that Dean could hardly ever keep up with him. Dean watched Ben’s freckled nose crinkle as he sniffed, chilly in the cold autumn air drifting through the open kitchen window. He remembered watching Ben graduate college and thinking of Sammy. He thought of Sammy a lot, the more Ben grew up.
Cas left after the boys saved the world, just like he always did. And Dean let him go, just like he always did. He briefly considered reaching out to Cas a handful of times over the past few months – but Dean didn’t know what to say. He didn’t know what to do. So he just…didn’t.
“And Ben,” Dean added absently, nodding away the image of Cas in the passenger seat of the Impala. “Her son. Maybe I can finally give them the life they deserve, if she takes me back. Maybe I can give them a good life.”
“Me, too,” Dean said softly, and he huffed out a shuddery breath. When Cas looked at him, Dean reached out and touched him, just a hand on the shoulder, grabbing for something beyond his reach.
“We had our chance, Dean.” Cas closed his eyes. Dean’s throat became pinhole tight. “Don’t make me dwell on that fact any more than I already do.”
From their hiding spot, Dean slowly, subtly rubbed his thumb against Cas’s elbow, feeling the fabric of that stupid jacket. Reveling in the touch that he so rarely felt. Cas’s hands burned on Dean’s waist. They trembled so violently that Dean wanted to take them in his own hands and squeeze them. It wasn’t until the bridesmaid and the man and the Lyft were far gone that Cas finally pulled himself away. Dean immediately felt ice cold.
"What do you mean?" Dean asked. He kept his eyes down at his lap, but yeah, now he could feel Cas's eyes on him. The angel probably wore that mildly annoyed look on his face reserved exclusively for Dean that Dean had grown so used to. Or, fine, the look that Dean had grown so adoringly
“Sorry. I know.” Cas was smiling again, and Dean would have sold his soul one thousand times over just to see it. There was another long pause, and when Cas spoke again, the light in his voice was gone. “I’m not quite sure what to do with myself.”
They both turned to face forward and were met with a thick, suffocating sadness that filled the air. Dean wished Sammy would come back. He wanted this sadness to be whisked away into the dark, cold night. He wanted to not be alone with Cas, especially after he had his chance for that, all these years. He wanted his brother. Cas made a thoughtful, sorrowful noise and spoke again. Dean closed his eyes.
“I was. I still am.” Cas looked back toward the reception hall. “I’ve got such little power left – sometimes it acts out on its own. Like it’s afraid of disappearing. I go to sleep in my bed and wake up in a field halfway across the country.”
The silence lasted an eternity. Just the wind and the rustling trees and an occasional passing car. Shallow breaths from Cas. The diner was busy, Dean could see through the brightly lit windows, but Sam would be coming back soon. Probably with pie. Probably thinking that the three of them would just pick up where they left off. Dean couldn’t remember what they had been talking about before all this, but Sam was laughing at something, and Dean remembered he was grinning. Cas must have said something funny.
“We tried to be good to each other. But we also tried to be good to other people, and that got in the way, I guess.”
“Yeah, I hear that,” Dean muttered, but before Cas could question him, continued. “I’m still sorry, though. I should’ve called.”
“Yeah, I’m—” He’s what? Domesticated? Just getting home? About to unload the dishwasher and go to bed? It all sounded small and stupid compared to the enormity of hearing Cas’ voice again. Dean couldn’t breathe.
And Cas. Cas was all that Dean had left of that life, and Dean didn’t even call him. It wasn’t that he didn’t think of him – he did, all the time. But Dean didn’t know where Cas would fit in, in all this normalcy. He didn’t know what he wanted from Cas. A friend? An ally? A fellow hunter?
“Isn’t every deal with a demon a ‘bad deal?’” Ben scoffed, and Dean nearly laughed. “And, wait – he got you out of hell, but made you dig yourself out of the ground? Seems petty.”
“So can you – I’ll tell her everything. And give her a choice. She doesn’t have to remember if she doesn’t want to. But if she does, if she does want to know, if I tell her everything and she believes me and—Jesus, now that I’m saying it, she’ll probably mace me, huh?” Dean tried to laugh.
“I wish that I’d done something about it," Dean said, and it sounded like an apology. "I wish I hadn’t just pushed it away, ignored it, but I did, and now—now everything is—it’s different. It feels different. It’s fucked up, man, and yeah. We lost our chance."
“Just…” Ben sighed. Dean knew he wanted to say it’s okay or it’s fine, the polite fucker. But he didn’t. Dean didn’t deserve that, and Ben knew it. “Just keep going. Tell me what happened after Sam – or – Lucifer, I guess – blew him up.”
In the long silence that stretched between them for miles, a muffled, slow song swelled. Frank Sinatra, maybe. Lisa liked Frank Sinatra.
So, after it was all said and done, Dean finally got his apple pie life. They survived their latest catastrophe by the skin of their teeth. They saved the world just as the last of the sand slipped through the hourglass. It wasn’t neat or tidy or wrapped up in a bow – with God dead, not every supernatural and celestial being ceased to exist. Some angels instantly lost their mojo and fell in flames, but not all. Some demons immediately perished, but not every single one of them. Life, supernatural or not, is stubborn. It is a dying flame that will flicker out on its own, and Dean and Sam were tired of extinguishing those flames. They decided to let them flicker. There were other hunters, now. They could do what they wished with those last threads of heaven, hell, and everything in between.
“Yeah,” Dean swallowed. “I – I didn’t know how. I’m not sure what to do with all this and…” And you, the statement went unsaid. “I’ve got Lisa now, and a job…like a real job, one with benefits and shit…and Ben just started college last month…I don’t know, man, it’s all just so…”
After Dean kissed his brother’s forehead and stepped out of the hospital and into the sun, his shoulders felt lighter and head clearer than he could ever remember. Maybe it was the shock. Or maybe he was just happy that the suffering was finally over.
He sat in the front seat next to Dean - an odd and rare occurrence, but since his powers began failing, Cas often found himself feeling carsick. Sam graciously and quietly, with only the slightest hint of pity, slid into the backseat more and more often in the hopes that sitting in the passenger seat could quell some of his nausea. He knew that Cas hated feeling sick. Just another small but monumental reminder that Castiel was no longer as magnificent as he used to be. Cas never said as much, but, well.
Dean swallowed. Cas was so fucking close. Dean could touch him, if he wanted. He wanted, he wanted, he wanted. Suddenly, Cas looked at Dean, took him in in his tuxedo, and then back at the reception hall.
“Cas…” The words caught in Dean’s throat. He forgot how scary Cas was when he spoke like this. Dangerously calm. Furious in that cold, calculated way. All those years in heaven, repressing whatever it was he felt.
“We’ll find a place in the picture. Just for you, Cas, yeah? Just for you.” The stars began to spin as Cas finally looked Dean square in the eye.
“I must be confusing you with another Dean Winchester, then,” Cas grinned—he actually fucking grinned, the stupid handsome bastard—and Dean shot toward the angel like a bullet, wrapping his arms around Cas so tightly that Dean worried he might break this spindly thing before him. Cas staggered backwards and laughed out loud. Thin hands came up to grasp at Dean’s back.
“What do you need me to do, Dean?” Cas asked, stopping in his tracks and turning his full attention towards Dean. He looked so amazingly
“That’s why I called, I suppose. I’m afraid. And you calmed me, whenever I felt something I wasn’t used to. Which was quite often, after I met you.”
Dean’s breath caught and his keys clattered to the ground. He knelt to pick them up, jean-clad knees digging into the cobblestone path he finished just a few months ago. By his side, the plants in Lisa’s garden were mostly dead. Dean stayed there on his knees for a long while before speaking.
, you change your mind and invite me back into your life? Well, I am telling you right now, Dean, I cannot do it. I spent the last two years mourning the loss of Dean Winchester. I
Dean found himself nodding, breathing shallowly, willing himself not to cry. The wind whistled just outside. The first time Dean called him
“Cas, where are you? Are you okay?” The question was a reflex by now. Answer phone, hear Cas, make sure Cas is safe and functioning and…well, not dead. Dean heard something akin to a sigh on the other end of the phone.
The first time Dean put his faith in the angel, body and soul. The rush of hearing Cas's wings and turning around to see the angel standing before him. The daydreaming, the wondering when Cas would be back. Pulling Cas into him in Purgatory and touching his cheek.
The world - well, their little world, the diner and the Impala and the black autumn night - stood entirely still.
“Yes, though," Dean said quietly. Cas looked up from his lap. His eyes swam. "I...felt that way, too.”
And If Dean said, “Cas was an angel of the Lord,” well, then, Dean probably wouldn’t be able to say much more, at least not without the help of the expensive whiskey.
Once Ben calmed down a bit, he didn’t say much. He laughed when Dean recounted how the glass shattered with the noise of Cas’s true voice. He scowled when Dean remembered stabbing Cas almost instantly after saying hello. He raised his eyebrows, incredulous, at the story of Dean and Cas posing as FBI agents together for the first time. (His eyes clouded over with anger when Dean mentioned that Cas didn’t know how to lie to save his life – Dean hurried on quickly, eager to get off the topic of lying.)
Now, Dean wanted nothing more than to get those years back. Maybe if he’d forgiven Cas sooner—if he’d looked at the bigger picture and realized what Cas was trying to do—
Besides, would Lisa and Ben even like him? Lisa probably wouldn’t. He tried to imagine Cas in the kitchen with him instead of Lisa; handing him ingredients while he made burgers, and Dean wouldn’t let him help, because Cas would be a terrible cook; he’d burn everything. Cas would help the best he could, though, and he would clean up while Dean finally took a moment to lean back on the couch and rest his eyes, listening to the sounds of Cas doing the dishes, waiting for Cas to come join him, and then later they could go upstairs and Dean would see Cas smile and then they would –
He got a bit drunk at the reception. Nothing that was (too) noticeable but drunk all the same. After a couple hours of dancing and socializing and smiling at people he didn’t even know, Dean excused himself and made his way out of the reception hall and into the cool spring air. Purples and pinks and yellows glimmered against the wet ground. Dean tilted his head up and watched the stars shining bright in the inky black sky.
He missed it sometimes. He told himself he didn’t, but he could only lie about so many things. But the adrenaline, the satisfaction of finishing a job, laughing at Sammy when he looked like an idiot and drooled when he fell asleep. Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.
“This is Dean,” He answered, and it still felt strange having only one cell phone, and that he got to be Dean Winchester on that one cell phone. No aliases. Just Dean Winchester.
“I know your soul like I know the ground beneath my feet, Dean. I’m the one who put it back together, if you remember.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas finally said. It was an unnecessary apology. It probably wasn’t even meant for Dean.
He reached out slowly, giving Cas a chance to back away. When the angel didn’t, Dean put his hand on Cas’s elbow and drew the angel in so close that their chests were nearly touching once again. Cas raised his shaking hands – since when did his hands shake so terribly? – and let them fall to Dean’s waist. They stayed wrapped up in one another like that for a long moment. Dean let out a shuddery breath.
Dean decides that this is the perfect phrase. If he’d said, “Cas was an angel,” then Ben might’ve thought that it was a pet name, and he would be giving Dean a look even more disgusted and betrayed than the one he wore now.
“Dean.” Ben’s voice was sturdy. A raft for Dean to cling to in the stormy waves. He lowered his hands and blinked back angry tears.
“I – huh.” Dean felt a familiar burning sensation bloom behind his eyes, though he didn’t know why. “Well, yeah. I guess. Never thought of it that way. Petty Cas.”
He tried to ignore it. No one called him except Dan and Lisa and maybe work, but it was Dean’s day off, and they respected that there. Demons had never respected Dean’s time off.
“I’m beginning to settle down myself, I suppose,” Cas said, and Dean felt a very familiar yet terrifying tug in his heart as he pictured himself settling down with Cas, whatever that meant. He ignored the pull.
“Cas, Jesus,” Dean breathed, raising a shaky hand to cover his face. He fell to both knees and when he dropped his hand to his thigh, he looked at the remnants of old daisies in Lisa’s garden. He should have known that Cas would try to save as many people as he could. He should have known that Cas would drive himself into the ground with guilt.
Cas looked thin in his blue jeans and a grey T-shirt underneath a warm black jacket. With a pang in his heart, Dean realized it had been over two years since he last saw the angel in that old trench coat.
Nearing midnight on a cool Thursday in October, Dean, Cas, and Sam had pulled into an overnight diner. Dean was still drenched in blood - a gift from a nest of vamps - and Cas was in a particularly vulnerable state that day, so Sam was the one to head into the restaurant to order and wait for their meals. He knew their preferences like he knew his own; Sam didn't have to speak one tired word as he slipped out of the car and into the crisp air. The sound of wind through dead leaves filled the car briefly as Sam opened the door and then closed it. Dean rested his head against the window and closed his eyes to the soft sounds of Cas's melodic breathing. How did he make every noise sound like music? Dean imagined that Cas was watching the leaves swirl into patterns on the ground. He liked shit like that. Finding beauty, or whatever, in the normal things.
“Exactly. There’s not much to say. I’ll just…continue my work with the other fallen angels, I suppose. Or at least, try to.”
“No, thank you, Dean. I just wanted to hear your voice.” The words were laced with panic – that seemingly calm, cool panic that Dean got to know so well – as Cas began to come apart.
Dean’s bones ached as he turned back toward the party. He distantly hoped that Cas made it home safe, wherever home was. He hoped Cas didn’t get lost.
Dean nodded. He knew all about how it was possible to share a heaven with someone, and he had no doubt that his heaven would be with Sammy. He briefly wondered if Cas would want to be with him in heaven. Cas, who’d lived thousands and thousands of years before Dean ever made the slightest appearance. Dean wondered if Cas could die, even. He was still an angel, after all. Less so. His grace was fading fast, but he was still something. And Dean wondered if he’d have the privilege of sharing heaven with that something.
“And now we’ve missed our shot, huh?” Dean forced himself to speak. It wasn't a question. Just another fact. "We had time, but we lost it."
And then something in the air changed very suddenly and very drastically. Dean caught his breath. Cas’s head snapped back toward Dean so suddenly that he staggered back. His skin felt too tight, all of a sudden. His tux felt too stiff. His mouth went dry as Cas opened his mouth and venom leaked out.
“Then that’s your right. And you wouldn’t be wrong to. I just want to help you understand him. Understand us.”
“Cas, what are you talking about – what I deserve? – it’s not like you’re, like, broken, or bad luck, or whatever – just, maybe I could see you, maybe we could just hang out –”
Cas narrowed his eyes suspiciously. Dean didn’t blame him. But c’mon – just a few more minutes of talking, a few more minutes of Dean-and-Cas, before the questions started.
And sometimes he dreamed about Cas in a way that he vowed, from the moment he awoke, sweaty and breathless, to never think about again. He pushed those thoughts so far away that he wasn’t sure they ever even happened. He’d gotten good at that.
He never told Lisa about his dreams of Cas. He never even mentioned the angel’s name. She knew nothing of his existence – his monumental existence, greater than anything Dean could ever hope or wish or dream. For reasons Dean couldn’t – wouldn’t – admit, Cas was off-limits in Dean’s new life. He had his chance. They both did.
of. Cas had once called Dean "incredibly stupid, and somehow even more brave." Except that right now, Dean was definitely opting for stupid. Not brave.
. There is no place for me with you. Maybe there never was, no matter how much I tried to convince myself.”
“So, you owed him. That’s how all this started. He helped you out of a tight spot and you felt like you needed to return the favor.”
The music from inside swelled. Thanks to the open bar, the party was only gaining speed. It caught Cas’s attention, and the angel lifted his chin and looked toward the entrance.
it was. He always was too honest for his own good. The lines on his face were as readable as the words in a book.
“It takes some angels longer to die than others. Like me, apparently. It’s—it’s hell, not knowing when it’ll happen.”
..." Cas smiled fondly to himself. He looked down at his hands, folded in his lap. "The year I met you. Our first hunt together. Coming home to you from Purgatory. It took some time to realize that I was falling in love.” His voice caught.
Okay, yeah, that was a good question. What would Dean have said? Would he invite Cas over? He tried to picture Cas at the dinner table with him and Lisa, and his gut twisted painfully. The picture looked much nicer when it was just him and Cas.
“I’m oftentimes so angry with myself I can’t stand it. I want to scream. Sometimes I do. I didn’t realize what I was feeling, and when I finally did…when I should have done something…I didn’t. And even if I had, you would not have reciprocated. I know that much. There were so many times you wanted nothing to do with me. And now—"
Though he’s not really a kid, is he? He’s an adult, young and naïve and full of so much talent and potential. An adult capable of meeting his stepfather’s eye and wringing out the truth so that the words dripped like cold tears on the dark oak kitchen table between them.
Dean immediately hated himself for thinking these things. He had no reason to. Not one. But he wanted so badly to be with Cas right now—touch him, see him smile, see him tilt his stupid head—erase thoughts of Jessica—
That weekend, a small church in Kansas overflowed with people showing up for Sam. They filled the pews and the aisles and the back of the church, and then the grassy, rolling cemetery right next to it. So many people they’d saved. So many people with so much love for Sam. Dean swelled with pride as they spoke of Sam. His little brother. His little brother who worked so hard, saved the world, and finally,
But in the end, it was all the same. Always. Rough and dirty and quick. Not a place for love and comfort. Either they told him what to do („
Sam cleared his throat again. “As long as you don’t give my kids any weapons, everything’s fine.” He tried for funny and Dean was thankful for that.
He enjoys the moment for a few more seconds before rubbing a hand over his face and slowly turning around. He does not dare to open his eyes yet. On the opposite was Cas. Not some random person he had met at bar. No
“Good!” And then they kiss again. And Deans hand wanders back to Cas’ neck and then his mouth wanders there. And the first time he kisses his skin. It’s something different. It makes him hungry and needy for more, “Fuck!”
“Okay.” Cas says and he feels his hand under his chin pulling his eyes back to him. His smile tender and loving.
“Isn’t it still beautiful after all these centuries?” Cas asked almost whispering, his lips curved into a smile.
It was a little awkward at first. Dean had opened the door and the fresh air started to fill the room. He took a deep breath and then laid down under his blanket. Castiel still standing around, unsure.
And he starts to kiss him. He runs his fingers over a spot, kisses it and brushes his lips over it. Back and forth. Rough and warm. He starts with his cheeks and his lips, behind his ears and his neck and his throat. His hands gentle but firm stroke over the muscles in the back of his neck. And it is just relaxing. Deans lips open just naturally, making him moan very softly.
“So, it would be okay for you if I-…” He bit his lip and let one hand slide through the air, “…-Y’ know…
“C’me on, Sammy! Let’s see what we’ll have for dinner!” Dean hopped out of his chair in joyful anticipation for food. He tousled his brother’s hair on his way inside. Sam shook his head with an amused smile, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon for a second until he got up and followed his brother inside.
“Okay, but how do I know what to do? How do I know who takes which part? I know your past memories and if I understand right you like to be the passive part in the intercourse with men?”
Dean sighs and let’s go eventually. He takes a look at Cas. “I’m sorry.” He shakes his head. His face burning in shame.
He felt nervous and a bit shaky as he prepared to say his next words. Castiel must heard his heart pounding loud in his chest. But it didn’t matter. “Listen, why don’t come upstairs with me, we can watch the sky under a nice ‘n cozy blanket. And we could leave the door open and listen to the sound of the waves.”
A jet of red light whooshed past his head, narrowly missing his shoulder. Harry ducked and ran even faster. More jets of light split the air around him, and a few wizards fell to the ground as Bellatrix’s spells struck them. Ahead of him, Tonk’s had reached a fireplace. She was gesturing at them and yelling something, but through all the noise Harry couldn’t hear her.
“Oh, the willow! It’s our oldest tree and quite a beautiful one at that. It’s near the old rose cottage, if my memory serves me right.”
Robin Felix was slightly shorter than Emily, with cobalt blue hair cut in the style of a boy. Large, golden eyes were set against her dark brown skin. She wore all blue- a blue shirt, a dark blue jean jacket, blue jeans, and blue sneakers. Around her neck hung a golden chain upon which was a silver ring engraved with intricate designs. Emily remembered that ring very well. It was one of the reasons she was sitting here, holding hands with the blue-haired girl.
Arya tilted her head at him, eyes narrowing, and wrenched back her arm. “I’m trying to help. This spell will clear up the smoke a bit, hopefully allowing anyone inside a little more protection.”
She took Arya's hands, staring deep into her eyes. "I am asking you to trust me, because right now, I am in the middle of a storm. We of the royal line have sacrificed so much for our subjects. We try our best; do what we can to make the world a better place. All I can do is try to keep this peace, but to do that I need
Emily’s story could considered to be full of holes by someone who hadn't met her, but everyone in the room had to admit that it seemed highly improbable that this
“Hey, Sherlock. No, it’s fine here. A girl named Emily just came ‘round, said she was looking for you. Said you wanted to help her? Oh, ok. Great. Okay, bye,” he finished, then hung up. “He said to hold on, he should be here in a few minutes. Want some tea?”
The man sitting to the left of Kingsley spoke into the tense silence. He was older than the Minister, with a mane of grizzled brown hair, kind of like a lion. “You claim you have no memory, Miss Rose, yet you know that name. How is that possible?”
Emily opened her eyes to see Arya standing next to her, tugging on her arm urgently. They were standing on a rainbow bridge that seemed to float in the inky black sky around them, lighting up the darkness with its many colours. The bridge was connected to a marble dome with a hole in the roof and a huge golden palace that shone with magic and beauty.
Harry and Ron looked at one another, confused. "What, like try and track her down? Why in hell would we ever do something like that, especially when Voldemort is on the loose?" Ron asked.
Harry turned to Ron and Hermione in shock. "Who's this Emily Rose?" he asked, "And why is Kingsley so concerned about her?"
Eragon nodded his head thoughtfully. “Your magic is very unique. I should like to study it one day.”
“Our mother was right about one thing: you have changed since you left this forest. I don’t know what it is yet, but you are not the same Emily I once knew. There is something tying you to Midgard. And we must find out what that is.”
Dean pulled out his phone. "Go ahead, Sammy. I'm gonna go look for Cas. He isn't answering any of his calls, and what with the events of today, I don't think he should be wandering off on his own."
The Devil slowly turned the crown, letting the light catch on it from the fireworks above. "Your memories. I can give them to you, if you like. That's what you really want, isn't it?"
that echoed through London was like a stone hitting the calm surface of a pond. Ripples spread across the surface, getting increasingly bigger the farther they spread. When the people of London heard the explosion, they screamed and panicked, the bombing of Heron Tower still fresh in their minds.
Emily followed the others off the plane, a chilly breeze playing with her hair. Autumn was much more present here than in Kansas. They entered the large building through a set of glass doors that opened automatically for them.
No one made a sound. From the table at which he sat, Dumbledore raised one bushy eyebrow, the corner of his mouth twitching. Emily's glare fell upon Harry. "Now tell me, how do you know me, and who are you?"
He said all of this very fast, barely drawing breath until the last word was uttered. Emily sat there, stunned for a moment. She watched as the detective took a sip of his tea, still staring at her.
Malfoy winced at the name. “Maybe she is, maybe she isn’t. I don’t care as long as she didn’t help kill my parents.”
“No,” Arya said firmly. “Though I suspect she may be gifted in the magic those wizards practice, she was never able to use any spells from the ancient language.”
and lazily waved a hand. Cas flew backwards, hitting the wall with a groan. Eragon, who had dispatched the three demons attacking him, yelled and charged the Devil. He held out his palm and shouted something, and a chair flew from the table and hit Lucifer in the face. He then started to attack. Eragon’s swordsmanship was excellent; Lucifer seemed to be having trouble dodging his attacks.
Stark and Banner nodded, but Loki kept his head still. He was scared; scared of what might happen now. Scared of what they might find out.
Harry didn’t wait to see what came next. He reached out his arm and grabbed onto Emily’s wrist as she ran toward him. Seeing his intent, she turned and grabbed onto Ron’s arm, who then turned and held onto his father. They ran, linked together, toward the fireplace where Tonks stood halfway in.
Silence. Arya watched the three of them- the angel, the hunter, and the strange man at the head of the table, with wide eyes. No one spoke for a long moment.
Arya nodded. She had no love for Sherlock Holmes. She barely knew him and he seemed like an asshole. However, he was trying to help Emily, in his own way. He didn’t deserve to get hurt. None of them did.
At this question, the other witches and wizards stirred about restlessly, exchanging hurried glances with each other. Bones leaned down and whispered something into Kingsely’s ear and he shook his head in response.
no experiences I should rely on proof. I have all the proof I need from today. So yeah, I guess I can believe in the supernatural."
“You two are going back to Midgard.” He smiled at the surprised look on their faces. “I know you, Arya. You won’t rest until you solve this mystery. But I’m not going back. I have other duties. Duties that require me to stay here. I just wanted to wish you luck, and if you ever need my help, you need only ask.”
Arya turned and beckoned to her sister, then bounded forward through the dense thicket of trees, leaving the other two to follow in her wake. Eragon kept pace next to her, his dark hair clinging to his face as they ran. Emily cursed behind them as she tripped over roots and slammed into trunks. It seemed she was not used to traveling through forests.
Emily had read the article about Sherlock Holmes. He had solved some of London's most puzzling cases and had gotten famous over the internet along with John Watson, a former army doctor. Emily wasn't scared of him though. From what the papers said, he didn't seem to have any special powers like those angels who had been chasing her. He was just really smart. Besides, she was in America, far away from him.
had something to do with it. The angel you have, I think he’s one of the ones who attacked me after I woke up.”
“About time, let’s get out of here,” Dean said, starting to climb up the stairs. The rest of them followed, running up the dark stairway. After awhile, they exited into the warehouse, breathing in the fresh air. Rowena stood up from the chair she had been seated in, and when all of them had exited the stairwell, she flicked her hand and closed the doorway.
An emerald green dragon emerged from the drop off, the sun glittering off his scales like gems. It landed in front of Ayra and she laughed, placing a hand on its head. The dragon gave a low growl and pushed her lightly with its enormous head.
This seemed to appease Arya. Though a frown still graced her regal features, she wasn’t likely to go galavanting off on her own if it meant missing information like that.
Sherlock looked out the window as the three strangers left with the star blessed girl in the lead. John joined him, his arm brushing Sherlock’s.
Zacharias looked at the door to the kitchen, then to Arya’s still body. “Leave them for now. The important thing is to deliver these two to the Ministry safety. We’ll come back if need be.”
"Come on," Cas said, dragging Dean to the door. "We have to find him. I don't like what this means."
“Stenr huildr!” Eragon commanded, and the stone floor around Lucifer rose up, encasing his legs and torso in rock. Knowing he wouldn’t be trapped long, Eragon ran after the others, stumbling after the loss of energy from his spell. He stopped in the corridor, suddenly realizing he didn’t know where to go. He tore through a door on his right, running down the corridor as fast as he could. Heading left, he burst through another door into a small room.
Arya and Eragon had been driving for hours when they finally found the wizard. They hadn't been able to find Emily and were finally forced to stop in a small town when they ran out of what the blue-eyed man had called "gas". They entered a tiny shop and had found him reading a newspaper in the corner.
“Fine,” he said, climbing into the driver’s seat. “But I’m warning you, this is going to be dangerous. There's a chance you could die.”
“That’s it, before you go off ‘being the hero’ you’re going to get some sleep. We can sort everything out in the morning,” she ordered, pushing Harry toward the doors. Ron followed them, yawning. A few others followed them out, no doubt going to find a place to sleep as well.
“To rescue you, of course,” Kingsley said. Except, his eyes were changing from dark brown to a light grey. The pallor of his face was getting lighter and lighter by the second. And the Minister of Magic
This is just the intro for the story, it really begins next chapter. Please comment or something I would love to know what people think.
Castiel studied her, his blue eyes skeptical. But behind that was a troubling, worrying expression that seemed to eat him up inside.
The question was asked with so much interest that Eragon’s head shot up, and he locked eyes with the old headmaster.
Sherlock’s gaze drifted around the crime scene, taking in the bustle of police men, the cloudy night sky, and the dark rooftops of houses. Wait… the corner of the victim’s house, almost hidden next to the drain pipe. And there, on the pole, way above them. His head swiveled left and right as he saw more and more of them. One across the street, another by the door. There was even one hidden on the fence.
He stopped before them, lifting a hand to rub Firnen’s head. “I thought I would find you here. I came to say goodbye.”
Arya stood up and held out her hand. Taking it, Emily was lifted onto her feet. Arya reached down and traced the star on Emily’s forehead. Sadness flickered her eyes as she gazed down at her sister.
Eragon struggled to wrap his mind around this concept. “But… is it her presence that really causes chaos? Could it not be other people’s disposition to her that inspires such a reaction? Maybe she is not to blame in all this, maybe she is the one pinned with the blame
The two of them walked away from the lonely hut on the cliffside, where riders and dragons once made their home, heading back to a world that didn’t belong to them.
"Wait," Sherlock intervened, stepping forward. "She didn't do it. I can prove it, just don't take her into custody."
sense for Moriarty to blame the bombings on her. That would just make it easier for us to grow suspicious of her.”
“A bastard child is by no means a sin. However, a bastard is different among the elves. We do not marry- we partner for life, and a very long life it is. There is no official ceremony that separates the birth of a child from illegitimate to legal. But for me to bear another man’s child while my partner still lived… that is something I was never forgiven for. It is what hung over your head from the moment I pronounced you mine, Emily. No one could outwardly judge me for it, I was the queen. But you were only a child, and a wild one at that. You see, you do not possess the magic most elves do. You cannot manipulate the energy that flows through every living thing. You have a different kind of magic inside you. And for that you were judged.”
Sherlock stared at the spot where Emily had been, then turned to face Mrs. Hudson. "You have some explaining to do," he growled.
Malfoy shrugged. “I don’t know. He only killed twelve people: five wizard families and three Muggles. Only two of those families didn’t betray him. The rest ran and rejected him during the Second war.”
"A recent disturbance has caused... disruption... on many levels of the government," Mycroft stated. "Scotland Yard is being notified as we speak, but this problem can not just be handled by the police. The E.U will be involved, as will the FBI."
He turned as they walked in and his electric blue eye locked with Emily’s silver ones. He walked toward them, never breaking his gaze. Emily opened her mouth to ask what he was doing when he suddenly grabbed her neck and pinned her against the wall.
The woman walked until she was right in front of Emily, her eyes not leaving her face. She placed one graceful hand on Emily's cheek.
Her old room wasn’t far away. It was a simple apartment, no bigger than the Queen’s rooms, but was much messier. As Emily stepped into her childhood room, she realized with a start that it was filled with dust. Cobwebs covered the corners and furniture, and the air was thick with dirt that made her lungs convulse.
"I'm Sam, by the way. That's my brother Dean," the tall man told her, nodding his head at the other, interrupting her thoughts.
Emily held it up so that everyone could see the ring clearly. “I enchanted a set of rings Robin and I gave one another to bring me back from the dead. Mine was gold, hers silver. They were intended to represent our shared bond. However, I think part of the enchantment malfunctioned. My ring was, to put it simply, connected to death so that it could be activated when I died. Robin’s ring is connected to life, so that the spell had an anchor to pull me toward. When Robin died right after me, the spells on each ring must have been canceled out, so I was stuck in death. Something, or someone, must have activated one of the rings to bring me back, but how the enchantment also brought back millions of others…. I just don’t know.”
"The first report was two days ago and yesterday they mentioned it on the news. I didn't think much of it, but now... What if it was those monsters?"
"Relax, Dean. It's me." He changed his form into the old man again, that he used before, when he introduced himself for the first time.
Jack smiled. "They are both inside. They won't know what happened, so you will have to explain it to them and I think it would be good for you to talk about it... The dog is there too. I know you liked him, so..."
"An-an alien. He went after the infinity stones. His goal was to get rid of half the universe... and he won."
"Dude, you have a camel?" Dean asked Tony who sat on his porch, looking surprised to see all of them there.
Dean walked carefully in front of his brother and they made their way towards the center of the room.
Sam closed the door and everyone else sat down on the chouch and chairs in the living room. Only John leaned against the wall and glared at the man and Dean too stood near the door and eyed Chuck like a hawk.
When he reached Bobby's house, Bobby wasn't really happy. He attacked Dean, but Dean managed to convince him that it really is him. He cutted himself with a silver knife and Bobby splashed some holy water into his face. After being convinced, Bobby hugged the boy and they both sat down to talk about what happened.
"What you dont't know about me could fill a book." She looked at Bucky. "You know, your stupid talking computer is really annyoing." Bucky glared at her and hoped that she did not destroy any of Tonys stuff in the tower.
Steve, Hulk, Thor, Wanda, and Vision were all there as well. Bucky, Natasha, Clint and Bobby stood outside the building and kept watch.
"Yeah. Help me."Bucky helped Sam out of the car and suddenly the woman stood opposite of the three men. She walked to the side and a dresser crashed into them, pining them to the car.
"But Lucifer fell and became the devil himself. Is that what happened in your world?" Bobby asked Dean.
"Well I won’t turn into a giant green monster, just to avoid getting dragged to hell. No offense Bruce."
"Hey, it's alright. You did an amazing job and I am sorry for leaving you like that. I- God I'm so sorry..."
"First of all, clothes. Cas, do you still...?" Mary felt slightly bad for asking, but they all knew that he still had some of his dead husband's clothes in the old drawer.
"We will try no to die... again." Sam said and grinned sheepishly. Bucky just shook his head with a smile.
"Well, no demon's letting you loose out of the goodness of their hearts, so we'll keep an eye on you, son." Bobby told Dean and then turned to Sam. "And you, since when are you back here?"
"I hope they fixed it up good." Dean heard a familiar voice say and he immediately got up and ran towards the man.
"Ah... Yes. We got along well and I- it's horrible." Bucky answered and he tried to make his voice sound shaky and sad.
The cabin stood all alone in the middle of the forest. They stopped at the front door and Bucky knocked carefully.
"To keep it short, Lucifer is free... The apocalypse is coming." Sam explained and the Avengers didn't miss that he looked a bit guilty.
"I don't want to cause any more trouble. Someone brought me back and it clearly wasn't you guys. I have to find out what's going on. Also I doubt that you want to replace your windows every day." He said to Tony.
"I'll be back in a few minutes." Castiel said and left the house. John also got up and clapped Dean on the shoulder. He went over to Mary and the others in the kitchen and so only Dean and Miracle were left at the dinner table.
"Castiel really is an angel, guys. I know it's hard to believe, but it is the truth." Sam said and the Avengers just stared at them.
John cleared his throat. "Like I was saying, you are more then welcome here and I think for now it's best if you stay with us. I don't mean to be rude, but of what you told us, you most likely have PTSD or something similar and no one should go through that on his own." John said and the mood shifted again.
Bucky and Tony glanced over to the kids and were happy to see Dean and Sam smile. Like actually smiling and enjoying themselves.
Emily thought for a moment, turning over the events from the past hour in her mind. "What I believe and what I do not believe is based on my experiences. Since I
Hermione glared at him. “Four, and there’s no need to get suspicious about the last one. Apparently the one in New York was traced back to James Moriarty, the other suspect in the Heron Tower bombing. He could have done the other two as well.”
Castiel led them down the row of rusty storage compounds, no one in sight. They stopped in front of one with a large red three on it. Leaning against the door was a tall, good looking man wearing a blazer over a white t-shirt, talking to a ginger woman sporting an ankle length black dress.
The hunter mouthed. Cas just shook his head in response. He didn’t know, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to now.
“Are you seriously suggesting that Moriarty and Emily are working together?” Sherlock sneered, taking a step back and dislodging the hand from his shoulder.
Arya gave the woman the cloth her hair had been tied back with. “Here, take this and cover your mouth. As soon as you can, get out of here.”
"What do you mean, this is Rose's fault? Is she among the living again?" Kingsley asked in a low, dangerous voice.
Eragon was left sitting alone at the table, baffled by the day’s events. “I’ll just… wait here then,” he said to empty air.
The detective checked every corner and room of the flat for any intruders. He wouldn’t be taking any chances with Moriarty back and Mycroft probably watching his every move. He went into his room and opened the closet. He dug in the back until his fingers brushed against a soft wooden box. Flicking the latch on the box and sitting on the edge of the bed, Sherlock opened the lid and lifted out a small black handgun.
No one looked happy at their leaving, but any protests were cut off by the great oak doors that removed the hall from her view with a loud
Potter! You have broken countless rules and endangered the secrecy of our world that protects and defends us.
"Yes, I'll explain everything later, but I need you to come with me to Midgard. I need backup and I trust
Emily sat on her bed, leaning against the cool wall, thinking. So far today, she had battled to the death against supernatural beings, been hauled off to a secret bunker, and told that the Devil exists and
Emily ran through the smoke and flames, her nose and mouth buried in the sleeve of her leather jacket. Her eyes watered from the fumes and her nose stung from the smell of ash and smoke. She pushed through the half collapsed door, trying to find the source of the screams.
had bombed two of London’s most prominent buildings in a span of two days while being closely supervised (most the of time). Still, the tiny embers of suspicion and doubt lay in every one of them, ready to ignite at the slightest provocation. Not only that, but there was definitely something going on with her. It was no coincidence that she was back along with the rest of the dead. Loki and Lucifer did not target her on a whim.
John returned to the room with a tray of tea. He handed one to Harry and Arya but Emily declined hers. So did Sherlock, but John looked used to that already. He pulled up another chair besides the detective and sipped his own cup carefully.
“I love that about you. I love everything about you, from your weird flannel obsession to the way you always sing along to your favorite songs. I love how you walk into a room and immediately take control. I love how you take care of your family no matter what it costs, though sometimes I wish you wouldn’t.”
After all, Arya had said his name. And a name was more than enough for the Queen to know what had happened. She knew who had killed Emily, who would try again, but she knew deep in her heart she didn’t have the strength to stop it. She had given her life for one daughter already. She didn’t have the strength to do it again.
“Those men who found Emily,” Hermione remembered. “Didn’t she say they were trying to track the Devil? They might be able to help. Could you take us to the place where Dumbledore found you?”
They moved up another flight of stairs and exited into a small corridor that looked out into a courtyard.
The five of them hurried away from the cells, with Tonks in the lead and Arthur in the back. There were surprisingly no guards along the bottom floor of the Ministry, which puzzled Harry. Even if Kingsley personally sympathised with them, the rest of the Ministry would want to make sure that they didn’t escape. So why the lack of security?
"God is... not present right now. I don't know where he is, but he hasn't left completely." Castiel said.
"Alright, you already have your room, so make yourself at home. I will order some stuff for you since you both don’t have much. As for your weapons, I want you to hand them over."
At the hotel he found a picture of Dean, himself and John when they were younger and Mr. Welch confirmed that their father was there four days ago. He found out that his wife was buried in a plot at their old place. Apparently the husband was unfaithful, which meant that they were dealing with a woman in white. She was suffering from temporary insanity and murdered her children. After that she took her own life. Now her spirit was cursed, walking backroads and when she found an unfaithful man, she would kill them.
"We keep digging till we find him. Might take a while." Dean said and Bucky and Sam exchanged a glance.
When they reached the house, the woman attacked Sam, but Dean and Bucky arrived just in time and Dean shot through the car window at the woman's face. She freaked out and  Sam, knowing that he had to bring her home, drove the Impala into the house.
"Ha! Believe... After everything I went through, you think that I can just BELIEVE? That I will just hope that everything is good now? These guys aren't even my family. They look like them and they sound like them, but my family-... everyone I ever cared about is dead."
"You and I both know that that‘s not an option for me. Hey, when did Happy say he‘ll pick us up again?"
"Well, did Agent say anything else?" Tony asked but Natasha shook her head. "Not really, but he asked us to help them out when they have problems again, because we now have tutors in that matter." She looked at Sam and Dean and they both nodded.
"You probably won't even notice. He would most likely just snap his fingers and you would all be gone."
"Yeah, though he still is better with them than Sam. Sam would have tried to modernize her and I don't know... bring the technology up to date or something."
Dean left the man alone and walked back to his car. This couldn't have had anything to do with them killing some monsters. This was something bigger, especially if it happened all around the world... Was it God...?
After a minute of just awkward staring, Dean sat up. "I- I should leave. You guys should just pretend this never happened and continue with your lives."
The three of them walked back to the main area and they prepared guns and knives, as they prepared to leave.
"Guys, this is Pepper. The greatest woman on this planet... Don't tell our russian spy I said that." He winked. "Pepper is the reason that Stark Industries is still running and kind of keeps us all in check."
"Nope. I refuse to believe that someone who has better guns then me lives in a small cabin like this."
"Oh he is like an old man. Always grim and complaining." Tony laughed and Dean glared at him. "See!"
"'s this all you douchbags got?" Dean asked them and one of the guys stabbed him in the leg and twisted the knife.
It continued like this for days, until Dean suddenly wrote a message that he found him and that everything was alright. Apparently some demon just played a game with them. Sam got hurt, but Dean assured the Avengers that his brother was fine now.
Rob smiled. "Yes. Now back to the story. God, or Chuck, changed over the years and became more and more unsatisfied. He wanted to destroy all universes. Every single one that he created. But God is... his mind is not like the one of a human, so it's not easy to understand, but you can not see God as a person, but more of a being with endless possibilities. A part of him," He pointed at himself. "didn't agree and split off of God's form. For a while I just existed without a body in between the universes. I had no goal, I was just... there." He turned to Dean and looked deep into his green eyes.
The Avengers started to realize how close they are and nodded. It would take some time to earn their trust.
At first Sam was scared, but he was the happiest when it was just him and Dean. Of course it wasn't easy and he knew that it was difficult for Dean. He had to steal for them and at the same time he hunted monsters, in hope to find their dad. But yeah, now it was just him. Dean had left and maybe that was the right thing to do, but Sam didn't want the life of a hunter. He was happy with the Avengers and they were more like parents to him than John ever was...
Dumbledore shook his head. “Only by reputation, I’m afraid. She is, of course, the first person to have ever entered from your world to this world before. And the consequences of that… well, look around you. See where Arya is now; where you yourself have landed. Look at how the world has reacted to the child that came from her unanticipated trip.”
Emily look over him once, nodded her head, then turned to face Kingsley and Scrimgeour again. “You obviously know something that I don’t. About Moriarty, about the dead, about
Lestrade let out a bone weary sigh. “We don’t know. Probably, but we can’t be sure until we get more evidence.”
“No more so than any other Hogwarts student,” Dumbledore mused. “In fact, compared to the school’s history of troublemakers, she was an angel. But one cannot remain a pupil their entire life.”
Loki's grin faded and he leaned back slightly. "Let's just cut to the chase. You want to find out about your past, I assume? I can help you with that. I can give you secrets you never thought were possible, or magic that dates back before the existence of this planet. All you have to do is come with me."
Harry Potter, the man who had stormed in a bit before Emily, marched up to her other side. "How did you get free?" he yelled at Emily, pointing his wand at her. "Where's Ron?"
Harry sat down next to Emily and ran a hand through his hair. “To bring back such a multitude of people, Lucifer would have to sacrifice a very powering being, or beings.”
Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a detective and a doctor who couldn’t get enough of danger. They flirted with death and, after a while, with each other. One was never far apart from the other and their love grew with each passing day. They knew pain and death and a deep, bone aching loneliness, but most of all they found comfort in each other. They knew family, and in time they knew love.
Robin stood up, almost startling Emily off the steps. She had been so silent up until now. “Emily, let’s go.”
truth. You see, dear Rose, everyone has their own truths. They may be different from the truths of others, but to them it's all the same. I believe I'm a nice guy, so I am telling the truth. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it any less true to
Emily shook her head. "You better find those eye witnesses, because they lied. Someone really wants me dead, so I'm thinking that they must be trying to get
As they stared at one another the silence was broken by a loud siren, the emergency lights coming to life and throwing the whole room into red shadows. The flickering lights hid half of Dean’s face, turning him into a monster from a horror movie. Something flickered behind his eyes.
“Almost nothing,” Mycroft answered, his gaze drifting to one of the large paintings on his wall. “She died twenty years ago in New York, shot in a back alley.”
Harry advanced and Eragon tried to stop him. "No, she doesn't know what's happening, don't hurt her!"
"Are you working with Loki?" the man rumbled, ignoring his question. "Hmm? Are you in cahoots with that shit-faced dolt? HUH?"
Arya stood up, suddenly angry. "All my life I have done as you commanded. I went where you sent me, did what you told me to do. After you died, I carried on your legacy, doing my duty even after you were gone. I have fulfilled a promise I never made, because I thought that this was to be my future. So, tell me, why should I just hand everything over to you, and do as you bid me, like the way it was
Her mother did not answer immediately. Instead, her eyes trailed the path of a bright blue butterfly as it passed over their heads, landing on a nearby flower. "During the end of that battle, when I knew I was going to die, I thought about the day you were born. You were a tiny baby, and were so light I thought the wind might carry you away. Your father had never been so happy. He held you in his arms so gently, so softly. You looked so peaceful there. I knew I would do anything necessary to keep that peace there. We elves pride ourselves on our advanced brains, but even we must sometimes succumb to emotion. During that battle, I thought of your peaceful face that day, and knew that the only way to keep you safe was to give myself to the void. To death. So I did."
“No one else move,” the man in the lead said. He had neat blond hair split down the middle and skin almost as pale as Emily’s. “Come quietly and we can do this without injury.”
The thunder god took a deep breath, then finished his sentence. "The dead have risen. We don't know how, or why, but with them is... her."
Before Ron could speak, Emily said, “Minister, why do you think I bombed those buildings? Isn’t more likely it was a Muggle, since the buildings targeted are Muggle establishments?”
The two girls stood in the alcove of the castle with their arms around each other, the moon rising in the clear night sky, as the stars twinkled their merry light above.
Now they have accused her of the more recent bombing. Detective-Inspector Greg Lestrade says, "This is the same style as before. We warn anyone who sees this girl
clear: everything I am about to tell you is the truth. I don’t care if you believe me anymore. What matters is that
am not going to sit around until someone tries to come kill me.” She didn’t care about their decision anyways. Even if they had decided she was guilty, she would have just run away.
“Jesus Christ, why can’t you use some level of caution?” the doctor growled, throwing up his hands in anger.
"Loki," Thor said a little frantically, and something in his voice unnerved Loki, causing his smile to flicker. "Something's happened. We don't know exactly what, or how, but..."
“You are very welcome to. If you go down the hall and take two rights at your first chance, you should find it. If you have any questions don’t hesitate to ask.”
Harry looked from her to Kingsley in a shrewd manner. “I heard him say as much during the trial, but you can’t be
John looked at him for a long moment then grabbed his coat. “Fine. I’ll look up the address, but we’re not finished with this.”
Ok, maybe it had been reckless going to the city where she was being hunted, but Emily had wanted to get away from Loki and hiding in plain sight seemed like her best option at the moment. She had sneaked onto a plane the other night from the nearest airport and had been wandering the streets ever since. Besides, as long as she was here, she could try to dig up some research on that bombing she was convicted of.
“How long are they going to be?” Eragon asked, still annoyed at being left behind. Harry hadn't wanted to attract too much attention, and had only let Arya along to go see the mysterious detective because she wouldn't take no for an answer.
Arya pulled up a chair near the crowded table and crossed her arms. She felt apart from the others, as though there was an invisible barrier between them. Perhaps it was because she was from another world- a creature apart from anything they had ever seen before. Or perhaps it was because she still didn’t trust any of them, not really.
Dumbledore gave him a small, sad smile. “Oh, I like to keep track of important people in the world. You, Dean, and Castiel are certainly three of them.”
“I do not know,” answered Arya softly. “If our mother did, she never told me. You were born with the ability to create fire, but we do not know how or why. Is there anything else?”
“She came to see me the other day, on accident. She wants my help,” he answered, never taking his gaze off his brother’s cold brown eyes.
Hey guys- I am going to try really hard to finish this in the next few months, but it is hard to write when I don't think anyone is reading. Please don't feel pressured, but if you do like a chapter let me know! If you have questions or theories send them to me! Thank you so much for all the support so far, you are all the best <3
The detective blinked and found himself staring into the pale green eyes of John. The doctor’s hand was on his shoulder, his grip like iron.
"What- sir, shouldn't I be out there looking for Voldemort?" Harry demanded, outraged, as Ron nodded furiously next to him.
Once upon a time, not so long ago, they were two brothers, inseparable it seemed by everything but time itself. Their natures differed as much as the sun and the stars, but even that couldn't stop their comradery. They fought as siblings do, tricked as friends do, and apologized as much as family can. They never gave up on each other, no matter what happened. They were brothers; they were family. A royal family, but a family nonetheless.
John was standing by the fireplace, staring at three pictures on the mantle. Sherlock joined him, standing slightly too close, but John didn’t say anything. The good doctor smelled like coffee and honey, a smell so familiar it never failed to calm the detective down.
Their minds joined in an embrace only riders and their dragons could know. A weight that Arya hadn’t even known she'd been carrying lifted from her shoulders as she and Firnen joined together again.
“Nothing matters but you, Robin,” Emily whispered. “Just say the world and we’ll leave. We’ll run so far away that no one will be able to find us again. We’ve been given another chance to be together. Let’s not waste it.”
He sighed, resting his instrument at his side. Maybe a change in scenery would help him think. He opened his door, stepped out into the kitchen, and stopped short.
“You can’t, unless you’re a wizard,” Hermione told him, glancing up at the sky uneasily. “Come on, we had better get going before this storm breaks. Lead the way, Eragon.”
Emily didn’t like the sound of that, but maybe it would be easier to escape if she wasn’t locked in a cell.
She shook her head. “No. I wanted to try to find anything about Emily or Lucifer. I saw him, Sam. I don’t know how we got away.”
Hermione joined Harry, Ron, and Sam at a table piled high with leather bound books. Dean and Castiel sat on the other side of the table, reading one of the books together. They were strangely close. Sherlock and John sat a bit away from the others, talking softly amongst themselves. They seemed weary, which Arya could understand. They were the only people in the room who couldn’t use some sort of magic.
There was silence for awhile as they both gave in to their thoughts. Sherlock found himself staring at the girl in the photo smiling next to Emily, her cobalt blue hair shimmering in the sun. She looked so happy, so young, and so content that for a moment, if only a moment, he wondered what it would be like to be like her. To not have to worry about psychopaths sending him guns and telling him to jump off a roof. To be able to stand next to the person he loved, beaming with happiness, without a care in the world.
She tried to remember the image she had had right before she ran into the building. Was that a memory? Was she starting to remember her past? She couldn't picture much, just a young boy lying on the ground, masked in shadow. She was pretty sure he had blond hair.
Arya stiffened at the words 'not fully human', but didn't say anything. Not yet, she told herself. Wait until things calm down.
Emily sensed it too. Her shoulders tensed ever so slightly and when she spoke, her voice was flat. “That I should we wary of the devil. That’s all. Why, is there something you would like to share?”
Cas blinked, then turned to the old cashier. "Uhh, yes I'd like to pay for my gas." The sudden interruption reminded him of the urgency of his situation. He handed over the cash to the man, then turned around and found himself face to face with the strange woman. He tightened his grip on his blade.
Arya felt Eragon come up behind her. "This is your sister?" he asked softly. He looked at her in surprise, a little bit of hurt on his kind face. She felt bad that she hadn't told him about her having a sister. It was usually too painful a topic to bring up.
They did, and after a few seconds, a tiny red dot appeared on the mobile map. "What the hell!?" Dean murmured, staring at the dot. Sam's phone was in New York.
Sam pulled out his phone and started to dial. “Harry gave me a number to call in case I ever needed him. Said someone would be able to help.”
Dumbledore tilted his head up and pointed at the night sky above them. “For example, that ceiling is enchanted to look like the sky outside at all times. The founders of this school enchanted it together, to represent that even here we are subject to what happens in the outside world. The spell will never fade as long as those with magic in their blood reside at this school.”
Sherlock wouldn’t look away from her. He seemed to analyze every bit of her, never blinking. “Yes, I do.”
“Put down your weapons and leave the Muggles to us,” Zacharias continued. “Please, Potter. No one wants to fight you.”
Cas stopped in front of an old warehouse compound, quickly turning off the engine and getting out of the old car. Hermione did the same, opening the door for the still hurt but slightly better Eragon, glancing around. It had taken them two hours to get there with Cas never going under 80 miles per hour. She felt slightly carsick.
Emily followed her sister out of the palace and through the forest. The morning was brisk and light, and a slight breeze rippled through the trees. Try as she might Emily couldn’t spot a single elf, and wondered where they were.
John was still in the living room, looking at the pictures. The light from the windows shone on his blond hair, creating a halo above his head. He looked so steady, so kind, so…
No one spoke for a long moment. Then, hesitantly, John said, “Do you have any actual evidence to back this up?”
"Please, we want to help her. I know Emily, I've known her almost all her life. If she really is back, I have to know. I have to
“Not to mention that dream Emily had. If you ask me, something else is going on, something much bigger than a bombing,” Fred said. “I don’t know what’s happened since I died, but I do remember when Voldemort first tried to take over. It wasn’t like this. I agree with Hermione, something isn’t right.”
Loki sat across from Banner in the food hall- what did the humans call it? A kitchen. The metallic surfaces were so different from the wooden halls of Asgard that Loki had grown up in. Different too from the cold stone slabs of Jotunheim. Loki was shocked. He hadn't spoken since they told him about Emily. How could she be alive? He thought she was dead. That's what Heimdall told them all those years ago.
of this to happen! I just- I just wanted to live, I guess. To not die before I had a chance to experience life.”
No one spoke for a moment. They were exchanging converted glances with one another, as though trying to figure out what to say. All except for John and Castiel. Cas was staring at his feet, frowning, while John chewed his lower lip and stared right at her. He certainly had some guts, that one.
The doors opened seemingly of their own accord. The three of them walked forward, Arya in the lead, upon a rug of petals and carved wood. At the end of the long room a few steps led up to a throne, majestic and regal as the woman who sat upon it. The woman had honey skin set with long black hair and deep green eyes. She was beautiful, strong, and the mother of both Arya and Emily.
Mrs. Hudson crossed her arms and glared at him. "Like I've said before, dear. I'm not your housekeeper."
No one seemed to know the answer to that. No one knew much about Loki, except that he was a god. It was Harry who finally said, “I think we need to talk to Thor. I don’t know where he is, but we should be able to contact him via the Avengers. If anyone knows what Loki is after, it’ll be him.”
The months before the wedding passed all too quickly. Though Dean adamantly argued against getting married in a church, Lisa insisted, and with the help of her mother and sisters, she won. Dean begged her to keep the guest list small, feeling embarrassed and nervous about standing up in front of all those people, but Lisa was a popular woman, and the list grew longer and longer. Lisa bought a simple champagne-colored dress that she wore well. Dean asked Ben to be his best man and tried not to picture his brother when the kid lit up and agreed enthusiastically.
“I mean, below-the-crust-of-the-earth, ring-of-fire, devil-may-come hell. Yeah. I made a bad deal with a demon and got tossed down under in my late twenties. Cas got me out of it. I didn’t officially meet him until I dug my way out from six feet under, but yeah, he – ”
Strange, that such a monumental admittance came out in such a small word. Dean cleared his throat, surprised to find a sudden lump there.
Christ, he couldn’t even say it. Here it was, unraveling, falling apart in their hands, something that even Cas couldn't piece together again. Cas, who fell from heaven for him, who endured pain and torture and fear for him, who kept quiet and aching for so long. And Dean couldn't even tell the angel that he loved him. All Cas wanted to hear. All Cas needed to hear.
“You can give them the world, Dean,” He said, and Dean suddenly wanted the conversation to be over. He looked away from Cas’ imploring eyes.
“Of course there is.” Dean grabbed at Cas’ coat, only to have the angel knock his hand off dismissively. “There always has been. Nothing about that has changed.”
Cas hummed as Dean reluctantly let him go. He ran a hand through his hair – such a human move – and shrugged.
Cas reached out the open window to catch one, and as he held it to his face and studied it with such intense curiosity, Dean couldn't help but think that the angel looked ethereal.
Dean felt a warm tear slip down his cheek. He remembers seeing Castiel come out of the bathroom that day he came back from Purgatory. Dressed in his trench coat, all squeaky clean. And Dean had thought:
“Where will you go now?” Cas asked Dean as they slowly began to make their way to the Impala. A gust of autumn breeze ruffled Cas’ hair, blowing it into his curious eyes. Dean shrugged.
“Congratulations, then,” Cas said, and his voice sounded tight; probably because Dean’s shoulder was pressed into his neck. “I’m sure you’ll be a wonderful husband.”
“There are quite a few messes left that I have been cleaning up. Some demons still roam the earth. Other supernatural entities terrorizing families. Fallen angels.” Cas made a small noise in the back of his throat. “I’ve been trying to manage it all. I’m not a very good hunter. I’m not very good at connecting with the fallen angels. A lot of resentment, there. But I’m trying.”
When Cas opened his eyes, they were shimmering. He didn’t say anything. So Dean let his eyes drop to Cas’s lips and continued speaking.
They made plans for Cas to come to the diner that Dean and Lisa would meet at. All he needed to do was touch her shoulder and she’d have everything. An accidental brush of a stranger, and Dean would have a brand-new life.
“He – it was – it was always complicated, the relationship between an angel and a human – can I just tell the story?” Dean demanded again, chest tight around his rapidly beating heart.
Islanzadi’s dark eyes stared straight into Emily’s as she said, “You have changed much since I last saw you. Then again, you were dead. And not much longer after that, so was I. How, I wonder, do the two of us sit here- cadavers as animate as Arya?”
They got the bus and Dean drove with the Impala to the Avengers compound, Scott followed him in his van.
"I should go." She said and looked at Sam. "I'll see you later, Sam." Sam smiled and tunred to Tony and Bucky.
"D-Dea-" John couldn't believe it. He stumbled forward, reached out with his hands and pulled his son into his arms.
"Nonsense. You are our guests. It’ll only take a few minutes anyway." Tony said and the brothers got up and went to the couch.
"Damn it."Dean ran a hand through his hair. Then he looked up. "Rob?! Hey! Where the hell are you?!"
"I'm sorry boss. He just surprised me, when he said he saw me changing into a dog. I panicked, killed him and just got out of there, before someone saw." A skinny man replied.
"Oh come on. If someone scared her, it would have been Thor or Steve because of their heights and muscles. Or Castiel who just stood there and stared at her."
"Oh no, why would I. He is me... or a part of me. But he is weak. Now that I found this world, the last world... There is nothing he can do." God smiled.
"You're welcome." Sam heard Bucky say in the background. Sam told them about what he found out and wondered why John hadn't destroyed the corpse yet, but Dean interrupted him.
"That's good. You two should know that if you ever have a problem, no matter the subject, you can come to us and ask." Steve told them.
He sighed and closed his eyes again. After some time passing, he started to hear something... or someone.
Angels were able to go through time, but he already tried to contact one. No one answered. It was like heaven was completely cut off from the rest of the world... He just wished Cas was here with him. He always made him feel better.
"That could work." Bobby said and the others looked at him. "Maybe she heard something from the other side."
"And so do I. Family don't end with blood, boy. Besides, you need me. You're playing wounded. Tell me, how many hallucinations have you had so far?" Sam and Bucky looked at Dean confused and worried.
"Eeehhh sorry... wrong door." Tony said, but one man quickly slammed his fist against Tony's head. Thankfully he was fast enough to activate his helmet.
A few days later, the Avengers all sat in the tower. The mood was depressed and no one wanted to say anything. Sam was upstairs and he barely left his room. After they had put Dean to rest, he wanted to be left alone and everyone understood it.
"Oh come on! There are enough of us out there. A few people missing won't make much of a difference."
Dean still hesitated to follow Tony, but then he looked down at Sam. His brother was clearly tired and the bed in the cabin wasn't exactly comfortable.
"Honestly, it was just coincidence. I was at the very end of all things when I realized that something was wrong. I felt how one world after another got destroyed. This universe was the closest and I just tried to concentrate my energy on it to prevent it from getting whiped out like the others. Then I looked around and realized that only this world and another one were still intact. The other one obviously being the one where Dean and God were. I went over there to have a look and saw what a monster God had become... I wish I was stronger, but like I said, I am just a fraction of him and could never defeat him."
"Yes. If your bible is the same as ours was then basically everything that is written in there happened in my world in some crazy way."
Everyone helped. They build together all the parts thanks to Tony‘s plan and at the same time they made notes about all the infinity stones that they would need in order to undo everything that Thanos did.
"Just tell us if we can help with anything. Maybe you two need  a break, like a vacation. No hunting for two weeks and not just because you are injured and need to heal."
"We tried. We tried to save as many as we could... I'm fucking tired... I don't know, if what 'Rob' said was true. I don't know if we can trust him and I still don't know if you guys are even real, but- but I hope that he was right and that there are no monsters, no demons, no angels and no gods here. That you can live a mostly normal life. And I will gladly leave you guys alone so that you don't have to think of this... this bullshit ever again." Dean told them in a broken voice. It was clear to the others that he held in a lot. That he wasn't telling them everything, but like he said, it would probably take them days to catch up with all that and after what Dean already told them, they weren't so sure if they really wanted to know.
"Thanks, but I'm fine." Dean said without looking at Sam and walked away. Sam sighed but then followed him and they walked home in silence.
"Like he said, you had a case like this before, right? I have time and decided to help, before more people vanish." Bucky explained and the officer nodded.
"Well, I am a lawyer in California and I am married to Eileen Winchester. We have two daughters, twins actually. Eva and Zoe. They're ten years old now." Sam started and then looked over to his parents.
Suddenly Bruce came rushing towards them. He and Tony had gone off to look for some materials for a new device.
He followed Sam to the back of the room. There, behind a curtain, was a metal door. Sam opened it and there were more stairs that led down to more rooms.
"You don't get to tell me what to do. You are not real. None of you are real, except for Chuck here, right?" He looked Chuck in the eyes and then suddenly, in the blink of an eye, he was gone.
"Dean, it's alright. We didn't want you to leave, but we understand why you wanted to go." Steve said.
"Dean! You are back. What took you so long?" Sam asked, as he went up to Dean, smiling and looking for food.
Dean nodded and then pulled himself out of it. "We should go back." He started to walk back towards the house.
"Yay! Let's do it." Eva said excited and dragged her twin sister and Jack into the house. Eileen followed and closed the door.
Tony groaned again. "God dammit... Steve...Steve can you hear me? Natasha...?" Damnit it!" He had no signal.
"Well they saw it with their own eyes. They would have never believed a lie, so Sammy and I told them everything."
"No no no! You can not do that!" Lucifer started to panic, but he could not use his powers to stop the suit.
By now the robot-suit had covered Lucifer's body and Sam threw another lighter at the suit to make it go up in holy flames. The suit started to walk out of the circle and into the black hole, but Lucifer was still fighting against it.
Sam nodded and tried to relax a bit, though he glanced over to the direction where they are currently helping Dean.
Dean glaced at Bucky for a second and then looked back at his brother. "Keep fighting. Take care of my wheels. And keep the superheroes in check." Sam and Dean were both close to tears now. "Sam, remember what dad taught you. Okay?"
After breakefast Sam and Dean packed their stuff. Natasha got the location of the psychic and now Bobby and the boys prepared to leave. They went to the Impala, in Tony‘s garage.
"Thanks, but I think he just needs some time to think this through. Dean was close to him and... he will be alright."
John, Dean, Charlie and Kevin all stood there. Sam let them in and immediatly locked the door and put more salt in front of it.
When he stepped in, there was only one other guy in there. Dean carefully picked up some peanut butter and when he was sure, that the cashier and the other man weren’t looking, he put it into his pocket. He went over, to grab some sandwiches, when suddenly a hand grabbed his arm, preventing him from grabbing it.
"Most ghosts instantly attack, because they are set on revenge. If they don't do anything, then it means that they still have a lot of their old humanity in them. Then the fact that she stood by her body, made it clear that she just wanted a way out." Sam explained.
Bucky shrugged. "If it is one of those supernatural beings, then we should try and stop it. And you going alone is not an option."
"He... There was a lot going on, but God wasn't happy with the stories he 'wrote'. For him these universes are like books to authors. If he is not happy, then he leaves and writes a new story, creates a new world. We... In my world, we pissed him off and everything was spiraling out of control. He wanted to destroy everything and... and he did. Everyone I knew, they are all dead now. Only a small part of God, that didn't want to destroy everything, managed to save this world, this universe and send me here. Everything else is gone." Dean explained and sounded tired.
"I will come back tomorrow and we can see what we will do next." Sam said and Castiel took a step foreward.
"And that was your mistake. Again. You don't pay enough attention around you." Rob said and glanced over to the person next to him.
"You know, I was surprised. I didn't even realize that a part of me rebelled. That a part of me left and saved this world, saved you. It's interesting if I think about it."
"There is no way! We lost. Bucky is-..." Tony just shook his head. "I am just happy that at least you survived."
"You know, I am still kind of a superhero. I shouldn't brake into buildings." Bucky said, but he still followed Dean.
"I don’t know Sammy. First I need money. Before that we can not go anywhere. We need more ammo, salt… We should be happy we have a roof over our heads."
"No... no... Dean." Sam started to cry, as he held his brother's dead form in his arms and Bucky too let go of some tears, as he looked at Dean. Bobby came rushing in and fell to his knees next to them. They couldn't do anything. Dean was dead.
After 15 minutes of driving, he reached a huge building with a lot of parents and kids in front of it. Dean pulled over across the school and waited in the car.
They all ate together and then they put everything in the trunk of the Impala. Sam hugged everyone and Dean also said his goodbye.
Dean looked around the house and walked into the living room, where they were yesterday and talked about everything. There were two large couches and a small tv screen. Some bookshelves and a large dining table with a lot of chairs.
"When I 'vanished', I fought against others and I... died and Dean made a deal. His life for mine. He has one year, or, well 3 months now."
"Yes." He nodded again. "Sam and Dean Winchester fought against God. I went to their world to see if I can help, but it was already too late. Dean and God were the only ones left alive. God was about to kill Dean as well and when he attacked, I used my power to bring him to this world."
Suddenly, on top of the staircase, two children stood there and caught the womans attention. "You've come home to us, mommy." they said. They appeared in front of her and hugged her and the woman began to scream. Meanwhile Bucky managed to push the dresser away with his metal arm and the guys were free again. The woman and her kids disappeared into the ground. It was over.
"Stop Sammy. Never apologize for something like that. I am your older brother and it's my job to keep you safe."
Dean shook his head and took out his phone. He dialed Bucky's number, but no one answered. He cursed and tried Tonys number, but again no one replied.
"It's their lives. Leave them alone. They never did anything. It was my world that ruined everything for you. This universe had nothing, absolutely nothing to do with it!"
When they did open, everyone raised their weapons and pointed them at the door. Even Sam grabbed his knife and couldn't wait to get answers from the imposter. How dare him pretending to be his dead brother.
"You guys think I'm dead. But all of you are dead and I am probably dead too. So.... this has to be the afterlife. But not heaven or hell..." Dean muttered and Castiel went up to him.
"That was my mistake. I thought Dean would be more... extraordinary and would be able to hear my real voice. Turned out he is not."
"What you are gonna do is give me that knife. And then you'll crawl back into whatever slop you came from and never bother me and my brother again, are we clear?"
"10 in the morning." Sam answered and Dean was surprised. He doesn't remember a time when he could sleep this long.
"I feel like we should lock you two up so that you won't hurt yourselves anymore... I never get hurt, even though I am always fighting up front." Tony said.
"It's okay, we-we'll figure it out... Cas...?" More of Cas' body disappeared and then Dean hugged only emty air. More dust was floating around.
"Yeah yeah Sammy, don’t worry. You will be back for your damn interview." Dean rolled his eyes. He got into the driver seat, Sam got into the back and Bucky sat shotgun and then they drove off.
The next day Dean went over to Travis' garage again and when he arrived, he stopped breathing. There stood a lot of cars around to fix, but one of them was an Impala. He walked up to it and looked inside. There he saw one of the soldier toys that he and Sam always played with when they were younger. He tilted his head and even saw his and Sam's initials that they carved into the rear package tray.
When the day came to an end all of the Avengers and the two Winchesters sat in the kitchen for dinner. After that they turned on the tv and made themselves comfortable on the couch. Natasha sat between Bruce and Steve, who sat next to Bucky. Bucky and Tony were slightly cuddling on the couch and next to them were Clint and Thor with a giant bowl of popcorn. Dean and Sam sat on the far left.
After dinner, Sam sat down in front of the TV with Clint and Thor, while Dean kept sitting at the kitchen table, looking after him. He thought that everyone had something else to do, so he was surprised, when Bucky sat down next to him.
Sam sat down next to Jessica, but Tony sat down on the other side and continued to talk to her. The other Avengers kept their distance, while Cas was trying to calm Dean down who was slightly panicking because of the flying.
Behind Tony was a case that transformed into a robot-suit. It looked similar to Iron Mans suit, but less cool.
Turned out the scratch won't turn Dean into a skinwalker, but Sam was still angry with his brother for being so reckless. Bucky had calles SHIELD to clean up and afterwards told Steve what happened. They really should pay more attention to those supernatural things out there.
"Well, we already send a lot of money to orphanages to make a better place for the kids there… I mean, mainly Tony because he has all the money. And now that you told us about how some people treat you kids, we will look more closely and work harder with the police to make sure that no kids will be harmed. All, thanks to you, Dean. You helped a lot of others with your honesty."
"Less talking, more eating. You two are still underweight." Tony said and pointed at the food on the table.
Dean woke up with a startle and he panicked for a second when he did not know where he was. But then he saw Sam sitting on the bed, putting on his shoes.
