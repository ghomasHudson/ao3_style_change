Sam laughed again. “I see Modesty isn’t one of your virtues though.”
Continuing on with his pleasant task, the sandy haired moved to his belt and trousers, opening them slowly, running his hand along the front. Feeling for the first time the length of physical desire from his love. He could tell it was long, thick and he would no doubt be riding it at some point. While he needed to take Cass this time, to fix him even as he was returned to normal, he was not going to refuse to share his own body with him. They were equals here, two people who wished to share everything they wished with each other. He would not refuse Castiel the right to share being within him.
The diner appeared to be a fairly popular place, and once their food arrived they found out why. The soup was filling, the salad was fresh and the main dishes were well prepared. Even the ice tea was well balanced between the flavors which Dean found surprising. Normally he always had to sweeten it to make it bearable. Tucking in they were halfway through their late lunch when the door opened.
Any whoo, has a little bit of everything in this one.
Hope you all enjoyed this story. I had a lot of fun writing it.
Naoko taking point, Sam behind her while Charlie walked in the middle. Dean and Cass took up the rear, senses wide open alert to any danger. They had thought about splitting up but with all the cops in the area it was voted against. To easy for them to be caught and used against the other. The one plus they had, the moon shining over head giving out enough light to see by. If they had to have artificial light to see by, it would have given themselves away.
Rowena had shown up a couple hours before dinner, magic bag in hand, and knowing smile gracing her face. She had floated down the stairs as if she was royalty, giving a show to Sam and Dean who had been there to meet her. She had shoved her bags in Dean’s hands while inserting her own in Sam’s bent arm, instructing him to take her to their sick baby.
“Fine, I’ll give you daily updates, you just went shopping so we are good on food for a few days.” Then in a quieter voice as he normally naturally nature exerted himself. “Is Cass really that bad off?”
“Dean…”
“What? Oh yeah sure, sorry was a bit distracted.” He put the car into gear, then took a deep breath as Gabe started up.
The fountain and central plaza had been abandoned by the townsfolk, due to what looked like thousands of snakes slithering all over the place. They moved over, under and around themselves in a constant hissing, spitting and shushing motion. If you watched to long you could easily become hypnotized by their constant movements. But it wasn’t just the snakes which was causing widespread fear, it was the birds and the cats. In all the various trees surrounding the plaza, the awnings, the posts, birds roosted, watching the snakes silently. Very little movement was going on with them. Wings folded against their backs, beaks closed as they watched creatures they would normally feast on. And the third sign something wasn’t right, was all the cats perched on the rooftops, watching both the birds and the snakes yet doing nothing about them. They either laid or sat on the ledges, green, gold and blue eyes staring without blinking at the others. Whiskers twitching from time to time, but nothing else moving as the snakes continued to make tempting targets.
Leaning on the sil, he sighed as he absorbed the peace those flickering globes of light gave him. Oh how he loved to look at them, to remember how much fun he had when he was learning to use his powers. Learning how to create stars, planets, how to form totally new forms out of old. He was much like his old man in that aspect, loving to create, to see what his imagination could come up with, as he played with the forces of nature his Dad had invented. HIs other brothers were more serious, with little to no imagination to create whole new things. Raphael was the worst of the lot, hating change of any kind, preferring to follow in footsteps already laid down. Lucifer was better, he enjoyed some of Gabriel’s antics at times, and was annoyed at them by others. He didn’t bother trying to create things though as he had another hobby. Which was driving their eldest brother completely batshit crazy and interfering with any and all of his plans. Michel was the most serious of his three older brothers, and the least likely to appreciate any creative endeavors his littlest brother enjoyed doing.

The cops already tense, wired and on edge from all the other strange and unexplained problems, opened fired.
‘You even think about trying it, I will tie you up with the Angel cuffs. You will NOT go into those woods without me.’
Puck looked up as the wind knocked everyone in his party down save him. “What the hell?”
Dean annoyed all over again at Fae, fate and whatever the fuck else had decided to mess with them, groaned. “Son of a bitch, that means we have to hoof it huh?”
Sam more blasé about it all, yelled towards his brother. “What’s the plan Dean?”
The flight through the woods had been fun and soothing at the same time. Feeling the breeze created as they lazily winged their way over the tree tops, watching the animals they could see startled at the size of the odd birds. Dean still was in awe at home much he had come to enjoy flying, as long as it was under his own power. He still refused to fly on airplanes though at least if it decided to crash he could probably jump out and save a few others along the way. Course Cass wouldn’t permit the plane to go down in the first place. Nah together the two of them would save everyone they could. But either way he still hated airplanes.
But the Angel was having none of it, instead voice deep and feral as his instincts took complete hold of him. “You’re MINE! MINE! No one else’s. You belong to me! Right Dean, you belong to me?” Now his voice started to tremble as doubt crawled into his mind, at how his hunter wasn’t responding to his attentions the way he thought he would.
The other issue they had to deal with was Dean not able to wear proper shirts. His wings were positioned just at his shoulders, hindering any chance of getting a shirt over anything. When they arrived Dean would have to remove the bracer so they could get on with the job. Which would then allow everyone to see his wings. After thinking hard, looking online for ideas and contriving a suitable getup, they managed to get on the road.
Quieting his mind as he watched the older Angel, he slowly could feel a connection to Gabriel. There was a flow of energy moving between him and the Angel, protecting him from whatever had been out to get and kill him. And he was surprised at how calm that made him feel, how at peace he was with himself and those around him. Sam felt steady and firm once again and he wondered why. Bracing his elbows on his knees as he sat on his cot, he watched Gabriel, trying to figure out why he felt so different yet the same.
“Good.” Turning to the cop he could see the curiosity burning in his eyes. “Don’t worry we’re heading out now. We’ll be gone before you realize it.”
“No, I will not wear it, there is nothing you can say that will make me!” Dean turned around intent on leaving the dressing room.
Shaking his shoulders, pointing his arms up in a “see what did I tell you move”. “Yes, seriously Sam.” At that moment, with impeccable timing, the HVAC system came on, coughing another bout of roasted fairy fodder all over his brother. Dean was hard pressed not to laugh his ass off to see it swirling all over him. Landing on his head, dotting his hair with sparkles which would make a seven year old girl squeal in delight. His clothes covered in multiple colors, his shoes churning up the dust. Honestly he needed to figure out how to take a picture of it. “You know what, never-mind, I’ll clean up later. Right now how do we get rid of these things?” He shrugged his shoulders, his wings lifting gently with his movement.
‘You like this huh?’ His human hummed as he sucked another hickey into his neck, finding the last spots which were not completely red.
Castiel never stopped moving, multiple shots to his torso not even slowing him down. His eyes no longer flickering with blue fire but rampaging with it. His Grace shining from his body, his wings casting shadows across the camp grounds. His coat blowing out behind him as a sudden crackling gale of furious air stormed through the campground. The shots poured into his body closing with sparks of his own Holy light.
Grimacing, worried for his brothers, he picked up the knife Dean had dropped. Gripping it tightly in his right hand he looked down at Gabriel. Taking a deep breath letting it out quickly, he pinched his lips together as he ran the copper knife down his forearm. Blood started to drip falling onto the evergreen side of the symbol, It started to pulse in time with his heart beat. Picking up Gabriel’s arm, he made a small slice into his skin, holding his arm so the blood fell on the amber side. Reciting the words Dean had spoken before he was taken, “Dendaric Neriria Edaeg.”
“DEEEAAAAANNNNNN.”
The Angel blinked suddenly foggy eyes, feeling the effects of calling on his power. Power he had lost years before as his Grace was drained and he was cut off from Heaven. Where it came from he had no clue, at least not till he realized what had happened once more. The Fae had interfered, driving him to attack the humans in some show of power. If it was the last thing he did, he would hunt down those bastards and get the answers he wished. For now though his power was once again dormant, simmering deep within his heart to be called forth at some later time. He staggered and if it hadn’t been for Dean’s hand on his arm would have fallen. He shook his head feeling drained as he willingly followed his mate, Dean led him over to the two cars who hadn’t been touched during all the destruction.
Fond smile on his face, knowing he was truly blessed to have such a fine man in his life, he left the kitchen to go find his brother in law.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Good for he did us a great service.”
“It is for now, it’s between me and Cass, now drop it.” He looked up as he heard the familiar foot falls of his brother.
With glowing electric blue eyes Cass gazed ahead of him, for it would fall to him to find the town. He flew slowly, making sure Dean stayed covered by his power while he flew north. There were no lights to be seen, flying lower making sure Dean was mirroring him, he scanned looking for traces of life. It was many minutes later he finally spotted what he was looking for, which was a good thing. He could feel it as Dean started to pull on his Grace, using it to supplement his own dwindling strength. While he would never deny his mate access to his Grace, the fact he was having to pull on it to continue flying by his side was ratcheting up his worry.
Sam and Rowena could see the different colors as Dean’s feather tips started flashing in response to Cass’s frantic state, crimson, oranges, fearful yellows flashing over and over. While the Angel’s own black feathers were outlined with various hues of blue, sky blue, ocean blue, sapphire and back to sky, all in response to Dean trying to calm his highly upset mate.
“Good then go and deliver it to the Second Son. MOVE!” Ordered the one in charge.
Sam and Cass never stood a chance, as she grabbed both by their arms and dragged them over to her own large tent, intent on dressing them in a manner which would let them blend in.
This chapter has a bit of smut in it. Light bondage, mild spanking but its all consensual and lots of fluff.
“Damn it Dean! What if a case comes in? How am I supposed to do a case and look after Gabriel all on my own?” Yet a part of him was very pleased at the idea of being alone with the Archangel without nosy older brother’s poking their nose in his business.
“What the hell?” Dean demanded, reading his knife for mortal combat.
SPNSPNSPN
Opening the door he entered Gabriel’s room, walking to his bed side and taking the seat waiting there. One of the few benefits of Dean and Cass being gone, he was able to decorate the room with a few things he thought would help Gabe recover eventually. Gently smelling candles burned which Cass had remarked were the Archangel’s favorite. A mix tape of soothing sea and forest noises. Babbling brooks, ocean waves, wing whispering among branches of sturdy oak trees all with orchestra music playing in sync with the sounds of nature. Best of all he found a warm set of blankets which had a mosaic design of squares in amber and green colors.
Voice reaching out to assure his instantly worried partner, ’Dean don’t worry about it. I’m fine but hungry.’
Cass flew them down? Since when could he fly? Before he could ask, Sam was slamming the truck closed and throwing the bag over his shoulder. The taller man took normal strides towards the bank, even helping a couple old ladies who were struggling up the steps. And if he wanted to join him he better start moving too. Trotting to catch up, he followed Sam into the 200 year old bank building.
“Shut up Dean, Cass can carry you and your wings. And you were in pretty bad shape last night. Don’t get your panties in a twist.” Turning back to Cass. “What did you mean it shouldn’t be an issue?”
Pursing his lips, annoyed once again at being questioned, he was going to answer when Dean decided to answer for him. Dean stepped forth, his own shoulders moving in deliberate motions, before his own wings exploded out of his back. Cinnamon wings with tips the color of snow capped mountains stretched behind him, in a wing span only slightly smaller than Castiel’s. The townsfolk gasped in surprise as they were shown a second Angel in their midst, starting to babble at the difference in wing shape and color. They had to be here to help them, they had to have been sent by God. They just couldn’t be evil.
Looking around himself, he went over the map he had memorized. They were completely defenseless in this area, what they needed was to put something solid behind their backs. The trees were thick in this area, in fact it reminded him a lot of the forest where he and Cass ended up fighting that Manananggal, but a small break in the canopy allowed him to see the mountains rising thousands of feet above them. Which sparked the memory of the rock shelfs and even a couple caves in the area. Mostly bear dens but it might just work. ‘Cass can you grab Sam? Ask him if he remembers where those hunters he met in the library told him about large caves around here.’
“Soooooo tttttthhhhheeeee mmmmmaaaaannnnn seeeeeekkkksssss toooooo kiiiiiiilllllll uuuussssss.” The stuttering ghost hissed.
“Gabriel is MY older brother. He’s an Archangel.” Then with a spring in his step only Dean would know, he turned and followed his hunter out the door.
Huffing, having a good idea it was the spell keeping her out. “Fine, must have been the spell, I’ll try and figure it out later.” Leaning back he frowned as a new thought came into his head. “Have you heard anything from Dean or Cass?” He hoped they had returned, he was worried for both but especially worried for Castiel, the man had been seriously terrified at his brother performing the spell.
Have fun and Carry On First and Second Son.
Damn it there was that “his Angel” again. He pursed his lips before letting it go with a shake of his head. There wasn’t much use arguing with himself over it, not if every time he thought “his Angel” it was coated with pleasure and rightness. He wondered if this was how Dean felt when he thought of Castiel? Then realized yeah, this is how his brother thought when thinking of his own Angel. And as he thought about it, the idea really started to appeal to him too.
Afterward nothing but silence, save for the HVAC system belching one last burst of pure rainbow glitter.
Well, the fuckers were back, drunker than ever and wanting to have some fun with the pretty boy wings.
“Wait you did WHAT?” Whirling to face his brother. “Did you know about this? Did he carry me IN HIS ARMS? Seriously like a freaking GIRL? What the hell Sammy? Why did you let him do that?” Dean glared at his brother who just sent him his own annoyed bitch face.
“I love you Dean.” He sighed as his thighs braced him for the flight of his billions of years old life.
Sorry it took a while to get an update, seriously was busy as anything the last 2 weeks.
Closing his eyes he tried to calm his mind. This is all he didn’t need. Seriously how did the Winchesters live like this? He was used to dealing with problems and issues all the time. But seriously a haunted bank robbery? While Dean and Cass were in the middle of a jungle? “Fine, I’ll deal with it.”
“God damn it, I’m never getting that shit out.” He wished he could strip out of his jeans but even he knew better then to walk around the bunker in his underwear. Not if weird shit was going on like it was now. Making sure his gun was still secure in his waist, he ignored how the weight caused his AC/DC boxer top to peak out. He stepped once more out into the hallway, crinkling his nose at the glitter covered floor. His boots didn’t help the matter any as they stirred up more of the annoying stuff.
“Yeah…” Dean struggled to sit up, Cass letting him go, both men unknowingly missing the feeling of being pressed together. “Listen we need to find that bitch now, help me up Sammy, I’m fine.” He struggled to his feet, both men helping Dean up when he refused to stay seated.
Cass gave him a long look, followed by the feeling of a deep body scan as he examined his mate inside and out. Dean sighed in a put upon fashion but didn’t question it. Castiel had been hit by quite a few rounds lately, and if he needed to check his mate so throughly, then he wouldn’t argue over it. In fact, he sent out his own power, and did the same to his Angel, both checking the other over and making sure all was well.
Which is exactly what Cass had done, swooping in and picking the entire car up for a few moment to break its momentum. Once that was done he kept hold of the rear end while Dean landed behind him. Both could see the absolute terror in the twin boys eyes along with the three girls in the back. Dean had marched up to the driver side door, his every step showing just how pissed he was. Probably didn’t help his wings were still out and spread wide behind him, making him look three times larger than he was.
Sam and Charlie were hiding in the woods, trying to keep clear of the patrols who were once more looking for them. They had no idea if Dean and Cass were okay, wasn’t sure if they would even be able to find them with all the people searching but they could only hope. So when Sam heard a strange noise behind him, he didn’t hesitate to pull his gun and wait.
“Cass?” Sam called out, still trying to find the celestial being.
Emperor Cokeblower Limpdick decided he didn’t like the view from his third story guest quarters, the ones set aside for poor relations. A large shaggy forest was obstructing his view of the mountains and where certain gods lived. He wanted to join them and figured the first step was to at least have a sight line to the mountains. So he, high as a kite and twice as limp as a boiled raw feather, ordered the entire forest razed within the week.
“Dean do you wish me to simply teleport us to the hotel?” Cass struggled to stand, leaning heavily on the trunk he had been resting against.,
“I do not know Sire, I was racing to get to the portal before it closed along with the other companies. I do know I heard someone shouting for you to be informed, but I was through and already engaging in battle. I should have made sure of your notice, I am sorry my Lord.”
Shaking his head, he handed it back to Dean. “Nope what’s it say?”
SPNSPNSPN
Snapping his mouth shut, reassured of his place in their odd little family, he raised his hands to cover his head as Cass gave a shout and the mountain trembled. A flash of light and there was a large scraggly fissure being ripped open. When it was wide enough for a man to pass through Cass lowered his arm, swaying in place before Dean steadied him with a hand to his shoulder.
Knocking on the door, he murmured to the two faithful guards. “No interruptions, this should not take long.”
“You mentioned someone named Puck. Who is he? I’ve heard the name but I always thought he was just a character in a play.” He sat back down, pushing his laptop and books to the side to simply listen to Gabe.
“What is it you’ve started?” Sam persisted holding Gabriel close as he tried his best to protect him. After all they had been through in such a short amount of time, he sure as shit wasn’t going to lose what was his either. But he needed information and he had little to go on.
Dean had taught him well, get in, get the job done, get out.
“Which would have brought dishonor upon us to allow one of our Princes to pass at such a young age.”
Dean looking in the trunk, missed her hand coming for him till it was too late. Hissing as she snagged her nails through his ruffled plumage, he jerked back, almost stumbling to the ground.
“Yes, my Queen, he did and I am pleased to see that he is given the reward which is his due.”
Once again ignoring the unspoken question, which when he thought about it was getting kinda old. Changing the subject to something more benign, “It’s complicated. Listen how is the acting going? Did you get the part you were looking for?”
“I’m serious god damn it. I want these things gone. I don’t want the damn things, they get in the way, they are heavy, they force me to walk funny… and not in a good way.” Dean grumbled even as he reached back and scratched at the top of the wing he folded over his shoulder.
Dean spun as he avoided the sharp grisly talons of the bat black winged bitch as she tried to take him down. The other creature had taken a couple swipes at him too, then seemed to realize he was here to kill the evil one. It no longer tried to attack him, instead saving its energy for the ugly thing. Up close she was even nastier than he imagined. Spittle from her rage drooled down her chin, mixing with the dirt and other liquid found on her torso. Her lower form appeared to be dripping fresh blood yet she moved through the air swiftly.
Gabriel glared up at him, but couldn’t hold it, eyes instead looking about the room. Sam wondered what he would say when he started talking. Only to stop what he was doing as a rather unpleasant idea popped in his head. What if Gabriel was unable to speak? The condition they found him in didn’t preclude serious injury to his voice. Cass had done what he could but he couldn’t fix everything. A whimper and a nuzzle to his chest, accidentally rubbing on his nipple, brought his wandering attention back to his charge. “Oh sorry,” he said contritely as he once again put the juice box within reach of Gabe’s lips. Doing his best to ignore how good it had felt when Gabe had pressed against his nub. Honestly he didn’t need to subject the man to actions on his part which wouldn’t be welcome.
Startled awake his defense instincts kicked in and instantly he was pushing up with his arms to dislodge whoever was on his back.
‘Yes, I want to ward the pathway so none can follow us.’
Taking the rings with another bow, he agreed. “Of course my Princess, I will see it is done myself.”
“So do you Dean, you’ve worked as hard as any of us.” Harder in some ways since he managed to distract many of the local Leo’s long enough for him to get the rest he desperately needed. His hunter was going to need a good sleep tonight so maybe his punishment will have to come tomorrow.
Startled at being addressed, “Oh, what? Yeah I’m fine, just thinking.” He corrected himself so he was once again driving in the middle of the lane.
Shaking his head, making it look like he was brushing his head against Dean’s cheek. ’I don’t think so, I think they are waiting for the path to open.’
‘And if you ever tell Sam that, I will pluck you bald do you understand me?’ He growled, his tone negated by the slow rubbing of his body against the Angel’s.
More trolls, larger ones emerged from the forest, built similarly to the first. Rotting debris dripped from their stout mostly naked bodies. Modesty was never a major concern for this particular breed of dark troll, and now was no different as most wore little to nothing. As they moved drooping parts swung about which would haunt Dean’s nightmares for weeks to come. The males were the worst for a certain part distinctly showed just how excited they were at the thought of killing the humans.
The power within the channels continued to flow, moving further from the edges and into the hillside the rock portal was actually formed from. The walls turning semi transparent as new images started to show themselves. A glowing doorway opened starting from Dean’s hand showing a stone pathway leading to a darkened tunnel. His hand dropped away as the tunnel opened more, stepping back unknowingly as he stared at the opening.
Cass smiled a wide care free smile for the first time in too long.
“Oh god DAMN IT!” He complained as he realized Cass and Dean were late finishing their morning activities. Covering his ears as best he could he quick timed it passed their door, trying hard to ignore the screams of pleasure coming out of the throats of the two men.
Then there was the Fae whore who was keeping the power out of his touch as well. She was destined to die and didn’t seem put out with that thought in the least. The dryad simply looked at him with calm eyes, watching, waiting, guarding and keeping him from corrupting the Grace sitting even now in front of him. The spell she had used was insanely hard to break through, he could do it but he didn’t want to waste the nearly 500 to 1000 years it would take to break her hold over it. The power also needed to break the spell was more than he wanted to spend, not when he had other uses for his power.
“Oh Dean, it’s good for your reflexes, I was trying to HELP you improve them.” But his eyes were twinkling from the success of his little prank. His own trench coat was starting to flap heavily as the wind started to pick up.
Puck looked at the iridescence being with horror as he realized what he had done. “You addressed them as…”
“Fuck Dean… oh god… you deserved it…” He turned his head, giving Dean access to another part he enjoyed.
And he was none to happy to say the least.
“Seriously? I thought it would be more.” Dean pulled out his wallet, counting out the bills.
Gabe looking down at his demolished tower of pancakes, swimming in sweet surgery perfection, shook his head. He was starting to get tired and felt a nap would be really good. Sure he might be stronger than before but he was still recovering, especially after his own Grace went rogue and did things he wasn’t sure of yet. “No, I’m good, thinking I’ll go back to bed though. Getting tired and could do with a nap.”
“She says she’s been wandering for a long time, wanted to see more of the world. Then she ran into the monster we are after, been trying to kill it for ages, but hasn’t been able to. It’s too strong for her to kill and still protect the humans it tries to feed on. So she has been trying to weaken it by attacking when it hunts. She wants to say thank you Dean for saving the woman with child. She hadn’t been able to and was scared she might have died. I told her the woman was fine along with the child.”
TFW plus Charlie spend some time together, helping each other in the ways they most need them to.
“Yeah, but I have a little brother who is into all this shit. His birthday is coming up thought I would get him something nice for once.”
“What the hell?” Sam blurted when he looked where she was pointing. In the circle he could see the outline of a pair of dark, misshapen legs, attached to a pair of five toed feet but it was the other end which held his attention. For the other end looked like it had been ripped from its top half. “Oh shit, that can’t be what I think it is.”
The third ghost said nothing, simple staring at him, gloating at the downed body of the
When next Gabe woke he was roasting hot, especially his back which had something pressing hard against it. He was also pinned down tightly along his left side as his right was laying on the bed. As he became more aware of his situation, he felt a wind blowing gently against his left ear. Turning his head he spotted out of the corner of his eye, Sam sleeping deeply and tiredly against him. His mouth only an inch away from his ear, he was the source of the gently blowing wind. Turning his head back to face the wall, the Archangel blinked his eyes in puzzlement as to why Sam would be in bed with him. Not that he was against having him in his bed, quite the opposite in fact. He honestly felt safe and secure being wrapped up in his arms and he had no idea why.
Finished stretching, Dean could feel his eyes wanting to close and with a growl decided he should go and explore instead, figure out a way to stay awake. Cass tilted his head to the side before coming to a decision. Returning back to the cave, he sent out the one person Dean would listen to if nagged at enough. It took a while but Sam managed to persuade Dean he needed to rest more than he needed to explore. They had several hours before sundown and they would all need to be fresh if they were to find the Manananggal and kill it. Sighing Dean had relented and returned to the cave, Charlie already setting up the air mattress to sleep on.
“Why not?” Dean demanded, eyes narrowing dangerously, flipping his wings all the way back.
Still he needed to get up, find out what happened to him, so with a groan he lifted his right arm to rub his eyes. He was very surprised at how much effort it actually cost him to do such a simple thing. Once again he was going to blame Rowena. Really how hard would it be for god knew who, to let him wake up one morning and not feel like shit?
“Damn, how did we lose so much. I thought we brought more.”
As an Angel he could see things like this, though at the moment it was pretty foggy, being low on Grace tended to make it hard to read things. Still he could see that there was a lot of potential with Sam, potential he was very interested in pursing. He had multiple occasions to see how his mind worked over time, both recent and in the past. His soul was strong, which was good, but he could also tell it had been through a lot. And he hated to think of it this way, but he also couldn’t ignore it had seen its own share of corruption. It was pure now, but there was still shadows of ordeals experienced over the years. In this area he differed from Dean who as far as he had ever been able to tell, had never had his soul corrupted. Oh demons had tried, it had been close but Dean’s stubborn nature as a righteous man had protected it.
Sighing Dean agreed. “I know he won’t, but we don’t have any other choice. It’s either this or we watch Gabriel die.” And he wasn’t going to let that happen, not with what he was already seeing from Sam. His little brother was a bit too interested and invested in the Angel. He was fine with that, as long as Gabe did right by his little if something did develop between the two. Now if they could just figure out why Cass couldn’t stand being near Sam or having Dean be in the same room as Gabe, because to do this spell he would have to be.
SPNSPNSPN
His partner issuing his own orders “Gentleman in the front seat please get out and put your hands behind your back.”
He sighed because honestly he was slowly growing jealous of the devotion towards each other they showed. Not because he wanted them to focus on him, far from it, just the idea made him squirm at coming between the two. But he wanted someone he could grow to love and trust as much as his brother and brother in law did with each other. Maybe someday he would find someone, for the moment he would hunt and of course tease Dean when he could about his special Cass treats.
It was a measure of how tired Dean was that he didn’t argue any more with his brother. “Fine, but if a single hair on her head gets hurt, you are cleaning the bunker of all that damn glitter.”
Dean bellowed as he tried to protect his most vulnerable parts from being smacked by anything hiding under all that mud. When he hit he only went a few inches, shocked he hadn’t broken anything. Then he realized Cass would never try and hurt him, but get him gooey yeah the bastard would do that. Wiping mud from his eyes, he glared up at the Angel floating above him, seeing how pleased with himself he was.
“Boys, boys, boys,” She called out to gain their attention.  “Maybe we should find out what the text says, and worry about who can read it later.” Rowena’s voice, laced with much humor, filled the air. “Now Dean how do we go about helping Gabriel?”
“Nope not shitting you boss, prints were fresh, and when we showed their picture around to the few people still here, most instantly shut their mouths and refused to speak.”
“Cass fuck me like you mean it. I’m almost there. Take me like you own me.” Dean demanded, pushing back into his hold, gasping as Cass changed the angle of his penetration to hit his sweet spot finally. “Oh fuck yes, right there, oh my god yes, take me damn it!” He growled as he started slamming himself back into Cass’s equally hard thrusts. The bed rattled and banged against the walls as they enjoyed each other.
Sam and Dean watched critically, Charlie simply stared with wonder shining in her eyes. All waiting till Cass finished speaking with his new friend. A few more words, a couple purrs and a cheep, the Angel released her head, with a final scratch.
One was tall, blond and just as chaotic and crazy as he was. Balthazar had sauntered up, large grin on his face, speaking in an accent completely foreign to anything he had heard before. With no hesitation he had handed Gabriel a flask of something to drink, and told him to take a healthy swallow of it. So he had done so with innocent ignorance, and boy howdy did he both love it and regret it. Whatever that shit was, and to this day Balth had never told him, that shit hit like a ton of bricks. With the blond Angel’s encouragement, he started really going to town on his corner of the cosmos. Blowing shit up, increasing the sounds of space as he did so. The screaming of the stars and planets as they were destroyed and recreated. Hell it was those sounds which finally got his Dad’s attention, but instead of telling him to knock it off, he simply made it so sound didn’t carry in a vacuum. So thanks a lot Dad, way to show encouragement.
Waving his hand in the general direction of where he had felt the oddity. “Something is funky with it. I’m thinking we should explore and discover what is going on with it.”
While Puck had been dealing with the new one, he had turned towards his own lieutenant, issuing orders quickly. “So I have my Lord, I have already placed my second in command in charge of half the Company and she stands ready to go to his defense. She only awaits your command.”
Wiping his nose, snorting as he not only shoved more glitter up it, but it caused him to sneeze once more, expelling even more glitter, he wiped his hand on his sheet. Rising he headed over to his dresser, pulling out his favorite dark navy blue jeans, his black Metallica concert shirt, and an evergreen colored flannel, throwing them on quickly. Dean then grabbed his boots and shoved his feet inside, rolling his eyes at the plume of colored sparkly dust which flew up.
“Sam, you’re okay,” Castiel eyes still glowing scanned the younger brother, knowing his welfare was important to Dean, therefor important to him. Finding him well, he switched to their adopted little sister,  “Good, is Charlie with you?” Naoko landed next to the tall man, tails fanning out behind her.
As he worked at learning how to use his wings, he noticed how they felt when they rubbed against his bare back. How they created a breeze over his head, how they affect his balance as they moved.
Huffing, mounting the bike, “Fine I’ll go but hurry back, I’ll have everything ready when you arrive.” Starting the bike, he spun it around, heading back to camp.
Then again this was Gabriel, the weakest of the Archangels and the one most likely to depend on it the most. He would come for it or at least revenge in time, so he would make his own plans to capture him once and for all.
“Fuck off asshole.” Dean growled lowly, well aware of the pissed off Angel beside him.
Deciding to take matters into his own hands, he was stalled by a new development.
“I do my Lord but not because it is a great honor for me. For it should have been me performing the ritual, it is my dishonor that I live while she no longer is with us.”
Kneeling down, Sam pressed a hand to his brother’s forehead, and wasn’t surprised to have it smacked away, or be growled at from the Angel. “Hey Dean, glad you’re back.”
“Anything Dean, you know that.” He would eat anything his mate put before him, knowing whatever had been created had been done so with love for him in mind.
Cass’s eyes lit up, about to do just that, when Dean finished his sentence. “But I happen to think you look hot.”
Dean felt it arrive and begin its own exploration of his mouth. He welcomed him with joy, loving how Cass was taking part, being active rather than passive. For that is what he wanted, he wanted an active partner in his life. He wanted Cass as his lover and only him. Running his hands down Cass’s sides, he slowly worked on feeling every part of him. They still wore clothes, way to many clothes, but for now this would work, being together, growing together.
“Hey baby, come here, we just want to have some fun.” Slurred a second drunk.
Sam, watching his brother as he banged his head in his overly dramatic self, watching startled and amazed as the wings started flowing with color once more. This time it returned to the bouncy peach color. “Okay, that’s weird.”
Whirling with a startled yelp, Dean almost reached for his blade. Stopping only when he took a good look at the man looking up at him. He looked to in his late 60’s or early 70’s maybe, stood just at five foot, was skinny as a sapling and had a deep chestnut cast to his skin. Hair white as snow, deep brown eyes filled with knowledge known only to him. A razor blade for a nose of which was a pair of wired speckles were clinging with all their might to. His hands had the look of a person who was used to thumbing through all manner of text and enjoying it all. Dressed in   a neat white button down with a green twill sweater, comfortable looking tan slacks and brown loafers, he was the picture of an old grandfather.
“You said the ones who are important to you, but you didn’t name yourself.”
‘Gotcha, okay but don’t be far behind. I don’t speak cat.’ He chuckled as he heard the cat snarl a second time. No doubt telling them to get their head out of their asses and move.
With a final lick and a knowing grin he stood, watching as Cass slid to the floor on his own knees and took him in his mouth. He groaned as he felt those chapped lips wrap around his own hard shaft, tongue caressing the underside as his Angel made the most obscene noises. He couldn’t help himself as he whimpered himself, he wanted more but he wouldn’t just start taking. His mate was quickly becoming corrupted in a manner he approved of, but could still startle and choke if he wasn’t prepared. Instead he kept his glimmering eyes glued to matching blue ones, which were rapidly changing as he felt what the hunter really wanted.
Dean looked at him thinking hard about something. “Couldn’t you just snap your fingers and create another pair of jeans for me?”
So with an innocent smile he hatched a brilliant plan. “Listen Dean I know you want to get rid of them, but we can’t right now. We’re looking into it I promise you.”
It was a complete list of ingredients one could pick from to make peanut butter sandwiches. Six different types of locally made bread, various fruits and vegetables, honey flavors, jam and jellies, and home made peanut butter made in house. The other items were locally sourced and all homemade or made from scratch that week. Some were even seasonal selections but all looked delicious and he had no idea which one to get.
“Fine, I’ll grab the gear. Sam stay here and see if you can get any more info. Cass come with me.” Turning Dean returned to removing their weapons.
“Report Dryad!”
Once done he walked to the side of the car and slowly opened the door, putting his hand out to keep his Angel from spilling out. They really needed to talk but frankly he was too tired to yet. He honestly just wanted to get something to eat, something to drink and pass out for another day. Gently gripping Castiel’s shoulder, he shook him trying to wake him. “Cass, wake up buddy, we’re home.”
Let me know what you think, see you all later.
A reddish bolt of something blew by him, hitting the wall outside the door. He jerked his head back, thankful he hadn’t been standing in front of the door this time.
Following behind his brother, Dean stumbled a couple times as he tried to balance his new wings. They were throwing him off his stride, vexing him even more. Seriously he couldn’t even walk now without tripping over the damn things. Once he regained his balance, he returned to his diatribe. “Why the fuck are they blue Sam?” He decided to ignore for the moment how the nuisance matched the color of Cass’s eyes. How they were various shades of cornflower blue,  dark along the arms while shading to lighter degrees of sky and ocean blues.
“Get rid of them? How the hell do you get rid of them? Can you shoot them? How?” The people in the lobby, the staff were all surrounding him. Eyes desperate and scared over facing circumstances they had never had to face or even thought was real.
“No one knows, they were the most talked about gang in 1849, but when 1850 came around they completely disappeared. A search was done through the country, along with Canada and Mexico but they were simply gone.”
Dean watched his mate sauntered off, still stunned at his comment. Then he grinned as he recovered, for he realized he was teaching his mate well. That no matter the circumstances there was always time for a little flirting with the one you loved.
“The House of Healing? What the hell happened?” This wasn’t looking promising at all, he was even less pleased to have to wait to learn what was going on.
Startled at the question the Angel turned to Sam. “I’ve done so, but they don’t really answer me back.”
Dean noticed the change of his wings, seeing out of the corner of his eye they were bright and cheerful looking, only to turn dark once more. “What? Why are they gray now?” He cranked his neck to look at the damn things fully, before turning his focus on the Angel’s face. “Cass? You okay?”
Robin Good-Fellow stood before the Royals, telling them all which had befallen the Sons and Consorts.
“Sir?”
In the case of protection, he could call forth his wings and mantel them over whatever or whoever he was protecting. His Grace would then flow over his wings similar to a raging river filled with mountain run off. He had been shot, stabbed, bit, clawed and even plucked at, and survived, though not without considerable pain at the time. At least till Castiel had come and healed him of his injuries, after dismembering and atomizing the ones who tried to hurt his mate. He had taken extreme exception to the monsters trying to kill his mate in such a manner, and had not hesitated to reduce the beasts to the smallest of particles found in nature.
Laying the ingredients on the counter, he started whipping up his egg mix, chopping the various vegetables and meats they would need while heating up the pans. This was the sight Sam walked into when he finally was able to make it to the kitchen. He had had to wait on the other side of the bunker, at least till he heard their voices talking in the hall as they headed out to make breakfast. Only then did he return to his room, grab what clothes he needed before going to take a shower. He had learned his lesson long ago to take his clothes with him. Thank you very much Dean for those lessons, bastard.
Pressing Dean’s head into his shoulder, “Sam’s here too, you’ll be okay, just rest for a few minutes.”
“Put cuffs on his feet, shackle him and the girl together, we can’t let them escape.” She ordered, before activating her radio. “Chief we got one of them. His brother is in the area so keep a look out. Also there is some huge ugly bird flying around, it tried to attack and kill us.”
Grimacing at her words, knowing she was right he sighed. “Yeah I understand. Thank you for coming and helping us when you did.”
Blinking glowing blue eyes towards the hunter, Cass cocked his head, “Huh? Sam why?”
“That is correct your Majesty, those I left in charge of the operation failed in their duty. I have since taken care of the issue.”
Closing the door behind her, Sam leaned against it, breathing tiredly as he tried to decide what he was going to do next. Gabriel didn’t need as much supervision as he had before, not with the spell active. Though he couldn’t tell how active it was, he felt very little from the Archangel since the very first time. He hoped it was still going, he really didn’t want to have to call Dean to have him come back to cast it again. Castiel would have another fit if that was the case.
There isn't smut per se but Dean does need to do things in order to calm Cass down so be prepared for extra fluff and worry.
After banging into another over hang Sam had had enough. “Castiel, god damn it, wake Dean up. We can’t keep knocking him against every rock, tree, or slipping and sliding down the path.”
Cass had been about to obey Dean’s order to strip and crawl in, when he realized via Dean’s own actions he meant down to his underwear. So removing his coat, his shirt and foot wear he did as he was bid. He wouldn’t have minded being naked but neither of them were up to coupling at the moment. Of course if Dean changed his mind and wish to claim him, he wouldn’t protest. He belonged to Dean, it was his right to have him any time he wished. Still talking would probably be a good idea after all his previous protesting. Laying on top of the bed, he settled himself as comfortably as he could. Just as he was slipping into unconscious he felt the light weight of cinnamon colored feathers coming to rest over him.
“I promise Cass to keep it as low key as possible. I’m getting hungry and could do with something to eat. Just focus on my empty belly and needing to fill it, rather then have your ass filled with my thick heavy cock.” He smirked at his Angel.
Growing more alert by the second, he narrowed his eyes at his mate, knowing his distractions were always a toss up at how well they worked. “What are you planning on doing?”
“Welcome now get going. Tell your brother happy birthday for me.”
“See that it doesn’t or you will suffer a similar fate as your former commander.”
“Damn it,” Running a hand through his short hair, “It’s a spell which might help stabilize Gabe, problem is only I can read it, it seems.”
‘There’s something you are forgetting Dean.’ His Angel’s voice came to him in his head, raising all sorts of red flags. Before he could run strong arms gripped him by the shoulders. “I’m not a man.” Turning he slammed his hunter chest first into the tree behind them, smirking at the yelp he released. “I think I need to teach you a lesson young man. It’s not nice to dump mud and other forest crap on your elders.” He leaned closer to Dean’s ear, his breath blowing hotly against the flesh. “And I’m definitely your elder.” He then nipped at Dean’s ear before sucking on the lope.
Sam looking over at the ladies, face pursing with nervousness, picked up the knife. “Dean are you sure? We can’t knock you out for it either. Who knows what the magic might do if we tried.”
Not good.
And poor Cass pining for a man he truly cares for.
Shaking his head voice harsh with keeping in his sobs. “It has to be done, he is breaking down the door in my head a we speak.”
Dean shook, wings shuddering behind him as he felt the Angel invade every part of his being. Sam and Charlie made to get closer to help, but Cass waved them off. “Stay back, the Manananggal left a chick in his belly. I can either rip it out, or burn every particle of its existence, purging it from Dean’s system.”
Sighing the Sheriff finally spoke up. “Look I’m not here to cause you trouble. I’m just here to check and make sure you’re not here to cause me trouble. After last time and actually giving credence to the stories told by the ahhhh campers, I’m hoping you are not here for another “hunting” trip.” He switched his gaze between both men before landing on Dean. He knew he was the one he should focus on, the other man or Angel if Dean was to be believed, and he had no reason not to, looked more like he wanted to kill him than talk.
Sam pursed his lips, knowing what was coming next.
Closing the door between their two rooms, Sam sighed he wasn’t looking forward to Dean or Cass getting up to their normal antics. It only reminded him of what he didn’t have and wished to someday find for himself.
The humans plus one Angel had shuffled in, looking at the cave in a mixture of dismay and relief. It was very small for the large men, but it was protection which they needed. Charlie had dropped her pack, pulling the mattress out to use for later. She had plans for that mattress and she wasn’t going to be thwarted in them. She glanced over at Dean, pursing her lips at the paleness of his features. She was starting to think maybe they should have carried the man all the way down. He was leaning heavily against the wall, holding himself up with both arms as his body shook. The wings he was sporting on his back, shook just as much as the rest of his frame, dull colors of granite, murky greens and dull yellows displayed. She had tried to think happy, perky thoughts at the wings and they hadn’t changed. But when she looked at Cass, seeing the naked worry and even fear, she knew who was overriding her feelings.
“Sam I felt what you were thinking. Not your actual thoughts, but I know you were thinking some heavy thoughts. I have a feeling they are about your brother and possibly Cassie who you refuse to talk about. Listen I’m not going anywhere and I’m willing to answer any questions if you need me to.”
Eyes widening at the words, realizing how much that must have hit the elder sibling. “Shit that is probably even worse. I don’t think I even want to contemplate how that is going to make Dean, heart broken I’m sure.”
“GOD DAMN IT SAMMY!” Dean snarled, stomping down the stairs of the bunker, bare chested as he preferred, while he still had those feathered nuisances attached to him. The fact Cass could never stop staring at him, eyes shadowed in ways which made Dean want, was an added unwanted bonus. The Angel had been sticking even closer to him, since their foray out into the world the first time had ended in such a fucked up way. This second job wasn’t quite as bad, a simple salt and burn, but it didn’t stop Dean from talking about the first job which ended in disaster, as far as he was concerned.
He grinned evilly as he could see how his spell just bombarded the weak points of the temporary bond between the Archangel and human. Rejoicing as it shattered leaving the link vulnerable to his next attack. He rubbed his hands together, gleeful at finally being able to get access to the Grace he wished to corrupt to his own use. The bitch guarding it would not be able to stop him now.
That was it, he was moving to another section of the bunker. Screw them… Wait that is what they were already doing to each other.
Stretching his wings out, Dean launched himself into the air, knowing Cass would relax in the air. Plus they both enjoyed flying together and it would lead to more interesting things later.
“Yes, of course. The First Son reacted even better to the remains of the faction which broke off with Prince Lomithralad Celadrieviel of the Winter Unseelie Court. Their domicile reacted how we hoped by burning away at their evil ways, yet leaving their natural power intact. It filled him with the power needed to complete the bond he will share with his chosen mate.”
“Yeah I wouldn’t move to much there buddy. You strained your wings and I’m still working on massaging the pain away.” Dean’s voice hit him, instantly relaxing him as he realized he was safe in the room with him. “Here drink this, the lady in the lobby seemed really eager to help out.” He placed a cup of coffee at Cass’s lips, not allowing him to hold it just yet. Helping him to drink till his Angel was more awake. Once Castiel drained the first cup of coffee, Dean handed him a couple gorditas to eat. Taking the cup back Dean refilled it from a thermos sitting on the mini table in front of the only window. Grabbing another plate filled with what looked like potatoes and sausage, he handed both to Cass.
“Anything else they find?” Sam had a feeling even more ghost protection measures would be among his answers. He wasn’t disappointed.
The shelves were floor to ceiling made of dark hard wood, etched with stylized designs he wasn’t familiar with and figured they were mostly for decoration. If he had to describe the actual look, it reminded him of pictures he had see of old English libraries with their dark walls and cozy fireplaces. The ten foot shelves were filled with neatly arranged reading material, by author, title, subject or whatever manner needed for the topic at hand. Sam would know more about it than Dean cared to know, but he was sure his little brother would have mentioned this place to him at some point. Brainiac loved books and a place like this would have been on his radar long ago. Still it might be interesting to see what they had.
“Really?” The man looked familiar but he couldn’t place where he had seen him.
Puck eyed Torfind, the older of the two males, his brother Urewien standing only a few feet away, pleased with what he was seeing. They were dressed in elven armor, light weight, flexible as no other armor could be, strong enough to stop a Dark Twilight troll’s double bladed axe. Barding covered their equine backs as well, down to hocks and knees, while bracers wrapped their legs. Their cloven hooves were sharp and deadly, pure silver in color.
Raising an eyebrow disbelief large on his face. “Right son want to try that again?” He put a little more force into his words.
Which meant Castiel and Dean could finally leave him to go and live their own life. So Cass could finally stop flinching when Sam entered the room. So their resident Angel didn’t feel sick to his heart and mind to want Dean all to himself. So Cass could live the life he deserved with his brother. He knew the only reason why Cass and Dean stuck around was because Dean couldn’t leave his little brother by himself. Still felt he needed his protection, till Sam had his own protector, Cass would never be fully happy.
He was asleep in under a minute.
Honestly his mate had come so far from six months ago. Before he hated flying, was terrified of flying to be honest. Then when they found his wings would be a permanent part of his body he had sulked for a few days at still having them. Till he felt how overjoyed Castiel had been to still be able to run his fingers through their downy softness. From that point onward Dean had put extra effort into really learning how to use his wings. Not the rush job when they had fought the Manananggal, but actual going out and working to enjoy his new limbs. As he worked he soon found the true pleasure of flight and now he wouldn’t trade them for anything. They allowed Dean to fly with his mate and share one of the few joys Cass had grown up with.
Gabe blinked at him, confusion starting to settle in as he was given to many choices for his mind to process. Realizing what was going on, Sam back peddled and took the difficulty of the decision away from him. “Here take a sip of this.” He plucked the strawberry juice box off the table, popped the straw into the hole then held it up to him. Gabriel sighed as he didn’t have to think, wrapping lips around the plastic he began to suck the liquid down his throat. He managed a couple good pulls before Sam took it away once more. Letting his displeasure be known with a whimper and pathetic growl; he was still thirsty.
“Of course I do.” It was what he wanted more than anything else.
Sam looked at her oddly, taken aback at her words. “You think I had it easy growing up?”
The twin shaking of heads drew his attention to his brothers, coming out of the trance they had fallen into as they healed Gabriel. He put the glasses back, zipping the pack before leaving it where it sat. Walking the few feet back, he could see Gabriel was much better, 100% improvement from before, all his parts were back where they belonged though he still looked pale and withdrawn. Then he startled as Cass collapsed back against Dean’s legs, who instantly bent down and supported him.
Smiling his happy gummy smile, he covered his hunter’s hand with his own. “Always.”
“Just that, I want you so much, I hate seeing others touch what I’m not allowed to have. What I’ll never be allowed to have.” Castiel already missed the feeling of safety and love Dean gave him when he closed his wings around him.
Looking over at Charlie, Sam asked even as he struggled to try and get out of his cuffs. “Hey you have anything to do with that?” The wind started to blow heat and the smell of the fires towards them.
Sam caught up to Dean just as he was coming into camp. Eyes worried as he took in the dark granite color of his wings. Whatever had passed between the Angel and hunter had to be pretty powerful to over-ride the wings from switching colors. He also hadn’t missed the raised voices, rants, and calls to find the jerk who had thrown the drunk into a pile of shit. Sam had quickly changed costumes to hide himself, Charlie was taking care of Cass, now that he had returned, but Dean was a whole different issue. Those wings would made him stand out like Gabriel in his porn outfit, while talking to nuns.
Maneuvering Sam around till he was straight on the bed, he straightened himself out, reached for the blanket and pulled it up around them. Pressing his chest against Sam’s back, he wrapped his arms around him. Letting his eyes close he slipped off into much needed sleep.
“God damn it Dean fuck me right!” Castiel was gripping the corner of the bed, lifting his head up to snarl in displeasure at what his mate was doing to him. His own untouched cock was straining for relief, reaching for it, his hand was slapped away instantly.
Growling, “Yes, get on with it.” He was already preparing himself for the excruciating pain this was going to cause him.
Carefully, Sam lifted up the edge of the tent where the sound was coming from. It took but a moment for something tannish to squirm inside. The animal was quite small, only maybe a foot and a half tall, it had black paws and ears, along with two strips on each of her tails? A cute button nose, wide soulful eyes, and a soft meow which she let loose once more.
The hunter continued running for at least 20 minutes, only stopping when they came to a small brook, glistening with the first light of the rising moon. Letting go of his friend, Dean watched as Cass stumbled from the sudden release. Flaring his wings, before folding them behind his back, he started asking questions. “Castiel what the hell was that all about? Why did you go off on that guy? Shit dude you launched him clear across two campgrounds, we are supposed to be keeping a low profile, that isn’t low profile.” And while Dean was angry at what happened, he was chiefly concerned over his friend. This was very much out of character for Cass and he didn’t like it.
The elder brother looked at the man who had won his heart. “We’ll talk Cass, but not now, now we sleep and to be honest I won’t be able to if you are not close. I have no idea what trouble might hit you if I don’t keep you close.” It was probably the most honest Dean had been with his feelings around the Angel since this whatever it was started between them. But it was the truth, his heart was sending him signals to keep the trouble magnet close. With Fae around he didn’t want to take the chance they would attempt something in the bunker, even if it would kill them.
Swiftly he moved to hide behind the only cover near him, a sweltering pile of rotting cloth, covering things best left to the imagination. He prepared his fire his gun, not wanting to take a chance that this was a possible troll. When the thing didn’t move again, Sam slowly came out from his hiding place, curiosity getting to him as it was wont to do. On unsteady footing, listening to how the mud squelched under his weight, he approached the fermenting pile of rot.
“No Dean, I mean we go out this morning, stretch our Grace touched wings and for the first time fly side by side as I have always wished and dreamed to do with you.” He smiled at getting to experience something so profound between them.
Then it finally hit him what he was actually looking at, especially as he moved and the feathers moved with him. Eyes bulging, as the idea which had just landed like a Marvel super hero, in his cortex, he jumped up, spinning around to somehow dispute the truth which was fluttering behind him.
‘I know but she has seen much.’ Dean could feel how much Cass didn’t trust her either, sharing his sentiment.
It has a lot of adult innuendo, and vague yet perverted wording to allow your imaginations to run wild.
The Nil Gathiel Elrithraldur, a ritual to guard an object from all evil. It was a bonding ritual, bonding her very life force and all the power within it to the duty of protecting what she held most dear. It could not be reversed once cast, and while it could be removed by evil it would take many centuries for them to do so. She had bought the Sons and Consorts time to retrieve what belonged to them.
Puck pursed his lips as he read the list once more. She could be the answer to many of his problems. The only thing is trying to find her, she had disappeared long ago, and he only vaguely remembered what happened with her, she wasn’t a member of the military or political factions. But she was unique in one aspect which he was sorely in need of. Picking up a bell he called for one of his staff waiting impatiently for them to arrive.
“Great just what I need.” Then he looked at the messenger’s somber face, seeing he had more news. “What’s the rest of the news?”
“Good…” Before he could say anything else the Scout Master returned, bowing low as she waited for him to acknowledge her. Turning towards her “Yes?”
“DEAN!” Castiel bellowed as he felt his pain.
Cass didn’t even blink, he forgot about everything he had just said about what was waiting for them if they flew. Spreading his own midnight wings, the tips flipping between fearful yellow and pain inducing reds, he dived after his hunter. He had almost reached his side when all HELL broke loose.
Sam waited till most of the people had taken off after his brother. Shaking his head he made his way towards the car, keeping to the shadows of trees and bushes as he did so. Gabriel was gaining weight every minute he carried him, or it could have been his arms were growing tired. Cass followed quietly behind him, but his eyes had that look that meant he was speaking with Dean. Sam made sure to keep his face averted, he didn’t want either of them to know how jealous it made him to be able to speak mentally. It would be handy when hunting and they were separated and he needed to talk to Dean. Cass had grown distant and preferred not to speak to him in his head unless absolutely necessary any more. So to be able to speak to his brother without bothering his brother in law would be nice.
Sam standing back, trying not to breath or move for that matter, not wishing to break the mood the two men were in. He knew the bond they shared, and wished more than anything they would actually do something about it. But since they wouldn’t, it naturally would fall to him to figure out a way to bash their heads together, at least till they understood what they needed from each other. The fact Dean was leaning his head against Cass’s, eyes closed as he relaxed, was a good indication as to what they meant to each other. Course Dean was also recovering from smashing into a steal reinforced concrete wall, so he was needing the healing the Angel was giving him. Cass, he could tell, was more than in favor of the way he was supporting his brother.
“Cass I can do that with Sammy…” Honestly he didn’t want Castiel to stress any more. He needed to be in bed and that is exactly where Dean wanted him. Man needed rest just like he did and sleep would be the best medicine.
Reading further, he frowned at the final option and the one they most likely would need to do. “Okay says that if a being who was born to the heavens find themselves struggling to retain what life of light remains them, another life might be needed to stabilize the being.”
Also a little darkness filth from our resident demon bad guy so be warned.
Looking up when he heard a whimper, Gabriel was twitching in some sort of nightmare. Closing his book, he made sure the juice was within reach on the side table, then slid to the bed frame. Picking up Gabe and laying his head half on his chest he started stroking his hair, making shushing sounds. Ever since he opened his eyes the first time, he had started dreaming again. Or from how he was reacting to his dreams they were more like nightmares. What they were about he wasn’t sure but he could guess. What he did know is as he stroked, whispering nonsense, Gabe calmed down and relaxed back into sleep.
Reeling from the various revelations, Dean decided to put it all on the back burner and do as the snake suggested. He carried his mate into the room laying him on the bed, running his hand over Cass’s slack face. Seeing the black eyes already fading to shades of green and yellow, the broken limbs once more straight and returning to true. Looking over his shoulder to see if he was followed, he discovered the doorway empty. Shaking his head, he settled down to tend to his injured love, everything else would just have to wait.
“Then why can’t you be together? Just do it, he wants you. Or did you not know that?” Sam had no problem throwing his brother under the Angel sized bus if it was for his own good. Or would that be to make him feel good. He didn’t want to think of the intimate details between them.
Castiel cocked his head to the side as he thought about it, “Hmm yes that might have been fair.  We should apologize to him at breakfast.”
‘Same with me regarding you, we’re equal partners babe. Now please get some rest I’ll be fine.’ He sent soothing, loving thoughts, gentling his Angel and assuring him he would be safe.
Gabe laughed with him as he slurped down his own triple chocolate sweet concoction milkshake. The bloody mary long gone just like the waiter Erik. Food finished all that was left was the cake which Gabriel was practically vibrating with anticipation at tasting. It had been ages since he had proper sweets (thanks Sam) and he was hopeful it was as good as it appeared in the little display case. The lady brought his cake, and hot damn two forks.
“Hey why you wearing my clothes?” Dean grumbled, secretly pleased to see him wearing his clothes.
Cass went to work on Dean, straddling his hips as he pushed his hunter’s shoulders into the mud. Steam began to rise around them, purifying the muck for the Angel would take no chances of his mate growing sick or being hurt while they played. When it was pure clean mud he began to tease and tantalize. Taking his hands and stroking them up and down the younger man’s body, using the mud as lube to glide slowly across his skin, leaving a film of chestnut which contrasted well with the paler parts of Dean’s exposed form. Leaning over, he pressed lips to his Winchester’s neck, latching on and sucking hard. Dean groaned as Cass began to mark him, knowing it would be there a while, and not caring in the least.
Swallowing, knowing Dean was going to hate his answer. “Umm yeah, yeah we’ll be out there in a day or so. It’s a long drive and we’ll need to pack up supplies.”
‘Always love now come inside me, COME NOW!’ Dean demanded while he flooded his mind with his own forgiveness at Cass making him wait. But it was important to both of them that he do so and therefor easy to forgive. ‘Take me damn it, come NOW!’
“Sheriff? Want me to get you something?” The waitress asked and he continued to sit stunned.
Shaking his head, dodging another rock Dean was having none of it. “Like hell Cass I’m not leaving you behind.”
Nodding as he led the way, keeping his voice down. “Unfortunately yes they do, so they are keeping a sharp eye on her, we only managed to talk a couple times, don’t want to bring attention to us. She is nicely distracting them though. We really need to get out of here as soon as possible.”
There were flashes of light and screams of pain and rage floating around them as the Angel did what he was best at. Kicking ass in the protection of those he cared about. “Dean what are we doing?” Sam voice stuttering as he held him up, watching the light.
Glaring at the younger brother, he glanced at Dean, needing to see if he agreed. Only when Dean nodded did he walk over the cat with a deep put upon sigh. Placing his hand on her head gently, his eyes lit up as he attempted to communicate with the animal. She hissed at the contact at first, then stared up at him in shock. The next moment she was chirping, cheeping, purring, and meowing in rapid fire conversation. And there was no doubt with anyone they were conversing as Cass nodded, grunting, and even saying a few words in Japanese.
“I need to find a wood nymph, her title is Amil Gade, name is Galebrindra Isebriwyn Threbririand.”
The Elven Lord snapped, “Yes I know that you fool. Tell me about the humans who were after my Wards.”
“Sam you hear that?” Dean kept moving his head, trying to spot whatever was flying above them.
“Yeah he will be.” Dean looked over at his sleeping mate, pleased to see him resting.
Walking over he took the seat left open for him, menu already in place along with a glass of ice water. Dean had a beer in front of him while Sam settled for ice tea. He still didn’t have a clue as to what was so special about this dinner, but he was hungry and food was sounding better every minute. Opening the book style menu he found himself looking at the usual choice of breakfast items, pancakes, eggs, those sort of things. Lunch and dinner options of the typical hamburger or cheap steak options. Though it seemed, if the picture was to be believed, a really good chicken salad option. When Cass turned the only page in the menu to the next side, his heart melted into a puddle of goo.
“Please, I don’t want to do this.” And he didn’t, he didn’t want to drop him in cold unfeeling waters, never to see the light of day again.
“I will.” Dean stated as he pushed the door open and stepped outside the man following him to the door way.
“Nope I checked and our kind of hunters are all busy and frankly from what I’ve been able to dig up, this is more along something we should handle.” He glanced at Cass, inferring they might need some heavy weight power on this job.
Hey all, got another chapter done. Lots of fluff and stuff in this one. A bit of H/C but not bad. Oh and cussing.
Shrugging his shoulders, going back to taking notes, watching as Dean pulled one of his wings closer to see the latest unwanted pigment. “They just seem to be changing every time we talk. When I was annoyed at your constant bitching, seriously dude you don’t need to bitch that much, they turned red. Then they flipped between orange and gray.”
Yes I did leave some loose ends. I needed something to tie into for later stories when I get around to writing them.
‘The only family I need Dean is you. You’re my family.’ But still he really wanted Gabriel to live, but not at the cost of sharing his mate. His instincts were already screaming at him that it wasn’t right to share what belonged to him.
His Grace, fueled by the knowledge that it had at last found its Master’s mate, held nothing back. It attacked the being with as much holy power as it could collect and it was surprising just how much it could collect when protecting what belong to it. With blasts of holy fire, Gabe’s Grace raced down the bond like raging ocean waves fueled by tropical storms. Smiting the evil before it could do anything more, forcing it to withdraw with vast amounts of pain as the power of an Archangel taught it the error of its ways.
Cass didn’t hesitate any more, taking himself in hand as he pushed inside his willing lover. Watching as he breached his hole and how tightly he was gripped as he did so. He would never get tired of this feeling, nor the feeling of when Dean was in him. He loved both sensations, though if he had to pick one and live it for the rest of his days, he would always choose to be taken by his hunter. To give everything of himself to the man who loved him, who showed him what it meant to be loved by another and fight to keep him by his side.
“Here hold on, pardon me if you don’t like this.” Sam then turned himself around so he was sitting near his head. Using one arm he lifted him by his shoulders, resting Gabe’s head on his shoulder while he held the water to his lips. The Archangel took a sip, then another as the cool liquid flowed down his throat. After three sips though Sam took the water away. “Easy there, let’s see if you keep the water down. I’ll give you more in a few minutes. Feel up to talking? Or need sleep?”
“Huh?” He asked startled out of his thoughts. “Oh yeah, I’m fine, what is it you’re looking up?” He asked while looking over the massive amount of books and scrolls spread over the map table.
Sam watched the by-play going on between Charlie and Cass, keeping his thoughts to himself as best he could. He honestly didn’t want his own emotions being picked up by his brother’s wings. Though he had noticed they had started to slow down on their changing in regard to him. Cass they responded most strongly with, which was an even stronger indication of the bond the Angel had with his elder. He knew for a fact Castiel did NOT like it when others touched Dean’s wings. Not when he was carrying Dean back to bed the first time, or any of the other times they had to study them, to see if there was something they could discover about the blasted things. Dean was the same way, he was better about it, but he tolerated Sam touching them, Cass he allowed free rein with.
‘Very true Dean, you are worth just as much as I am.’ He was firm in his own mind voice as he picked up on what his hunter hadn’t said.
Frowning at his words, still Cass did as he wished. “Fine but I don’t like plucking you Dean. You’re my mate not a chicken.” He sent a picture of a cartoon chicken plucked and covering himself in certain areas. Causing Dean to chuckle and send his own image with his response.
Leaning back on his knees the Angel debated what he wanted to do first, there were so many possibilities. Making up his mind he arched over his mate, reaching to the back of his head and began to slowly kiss and lick his way down Dean’s back. Rubbing his slack clad cock in the crack of his mate’s ass while placing gentle kisses everywhere. His shoulders, spine, neck, hands rubbing his skin sensually as he peppered him with kitten licks between kisses. Delighted at the hiccups and groans his hunter was making as he pleased himself with his love’s body. Cass could feel Dean’s frustration as he ground against the pillow for friction, which he received but it didn’t do any good. His cock was thoroughly locked down and his own pleasure would have to wait till the morning.

Yes, it was worst, and he was tired of always feeling like an absolute heel to deny what Dean was rightfully entitled to. Dean had earned the right to demand anything he wanted in the world. Sacrificed his heart, his mind, his body, his soul over and over to help others. Died multiple times to protect others, and so he had earned a reward which should equal what he had given up. And if his reward was a fallen, broken and nearly useless Angel with next to no powers, no wings, and no way to equal the greatness which was his hunter so be it. He loved Dean, Dean loved him and it was time to surrender to what was happening between them.
“YOU DID WHAT?” The younger brother shouted trying to find his brother, before he realized how futile it was.
“YO BITCHES, bout time you showed up…. Woah are those wings Dean?” She watched as his wings started flashing so fast it would put a psychedelic concert to shame.
The younger brother, nose inured to the scent, rolled the thing in question, explaining as he went. “It’s not a what, it’s a who.” Cradling his hand under the being’s head, he wiped his face gently.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Find the traitor and kill him.” Her eyes burned with rage at the threat to her sons, for no doubt if her sons were killed what was to stop this enemy from going after her daughters or even herself and husband.
Castiel stood over his older brother’s bed, hands hovering a few inches above his body, frowning at what he was finding. The sickness or darkness whatever it was, had grown over night, enveloping all but a few flickers of his brother’s Grace. He was struggling to breath, his heart was beating three times the normal rate and his actual life force was barely holding on. Closing his eyes he reached for his own Grace, then attacked the darkness trying to claim his sibling.
Giving a shove with his own wings, he dived towards his mate, plucking him from the ground as the writhing male gripped what was left of his empty sack. Castiel pressed his other hand on the creature’s head and burned his being out. The other trolls snarled their own rage as another one of their own fell. More arrows, trunks and stones were launched at them, but Cass took no noticed of them. Intent instead on healing his mate of his broken shoulder pressing his hand against it and pouring his power into healing his hunter.
“No you didn’t, you made a mistake, we all do, it just shows you’re as human as a Celestial being can be. Castiel, it will be alright, I’m alright, you’re alright, and we are both still learning about each other. Learning about how much we care and how far we will go to protect each other.” He chuckled now as he relaxed his grip on his Angel’s shoulders and rested his forehead against Cass’s. “Just we kinda have to remember to temper our protection with common sense. We love each other so much we can be blind to many things. Let’s try and see things clearer from now on.”
The Angel was by his side in an instant, steadying him, even as he started sporting a wide gummy smile. “You did it Dean, you flew.” His wings were a jubilant tangelo orange.
Dean looked up confused at the comment. “What do you mean by that? What you want me to go flying with you? To see if your wings are fully functional?”
Still the faun was the messenger and he was so not in the mood for bad news. So if he didn’t give him good along with the bad he would transform him into a flashlight for the furkin in a heartbeat. They were always horny bastards and the females only came into season, and therefor the mood, once every 12 months. Unless they already had offspring at their knee, then the females didn’t come into season again till they had reached young adult hood. Which was typically at 15 years, and since for every female born there were six males, furkin where very horny.
Dean made sure to stay out of sight of the camera, all he didn’t need was Charlie going apeshit over his wings. Cass cocked his head at Dean for a moment, wondering what he was doing, till he realized. With no hesitation, he smoothly moved to help block the camera from the young woman.
“I know so cleaning it will be a real bitch. Now go, but come back alive.” Dean slid down the wall, giving up trying to stand any more, he was simply to tired.
“Here you go boys, let me know if you need anything else.” She patted Gabriel on the shoulder, the same as a mother would to her kids, then headed to her next table. Oh yeah she would be getting a big tip if Gabe has his way about it.
Three dozen hands went up.
Snapping to attention herself she immediately started groveling. “Yes, Sire, sorry Sire, won’t happen again Sire.” Bowing after each Sire she hoped she had appeased him. She really didn’t want to be turned into a pair of leggings or something to cover a troll’s nether regions.
Boy did he fuck up with that decision.
Smiling he held out his wrist and she immediately hopped onto it, curling her talons securely around his arm. “You are my favorite sister, I have always been able to depend on your intelligence and support.” He ran his own short talon tips down her breast feathers, pleased with how oily and sickly they looked.
SPNSPNSPN
“It shall be done Sire.” She turned and fled the room, seeking those who would be able to find out what had been requested.
Away from the Winchester brothers.
Sam looked at his watch, pleased when he saw the time. He returned from his morning run sweaty, in need of a shower and feeling really good. Entering the bunker he quickly trotted down the steps and headed down the hallway where the bedrooms were located. He was just about to enter the hallway he shared with his brother and brother in law when the most horrendous sounds reached his ears.
“How bad are my feathers love?” Cause if they were a mess he would let Castiel continue, they both knew they had to keep their feathers in good shape in case they were needed in an instant.
Sam not wanting to linger while the cops were still confused, backed out quickly. Following Charlie’s path out they were soon lost to the sight of the perplexed cops.
Hope you all enjoyed this chapter. Only one more to go just not sure when I'm going to get it out. Hopefully some time within the next week. I'm not sure as of yet cause that one has SMUT and I want to make sure I do it right.
“We know Dean has self worth issues, I’ve tried to help him but you know him. Doesn’t talk about anything important. Cass though I think he is operating under the same premise. I heard him saying something about not being worthy of Dean.”
It was a novel concept for him, being a big brother and he would often think about the concept. He knew he didn’t want to be like his own older aloof brothers, and so behaved differently, more open, more carefree and Castiel grew in confidence and strength.
“So who will give me 100 dollars for a Date with Dean Winchester.”
“Should we try doing this tomorrow? Maybe if we give him some time to get used to the idea it will help him?” She was honestly worried about the two.
Time meant nothing to him as he worked on bringing Castiel back from the brink of despair and terror. He had never known his mate to be this way before and he didn’t like it, it was against his nature and he wanted his love back. Slowly he rubbed his back, stroking over and over against his spine, up his wing bones, caressing the feathers he could reach. Making little noises which seemed to be a cross between a croon and a purr, Dean worked on calming his panic stricken Angel.
Turning around he looked up at the man addressing him. It was the chief looking at him with wide eyes, reflecting fear and confusion.
The entire troop of elves disappeared, carrying their prize with them.
The two men watched her leave till her footfalls faded away, Sam then turned to Castiel. “Do you want me to…”
“Charlie get on with it.” He ignored Castiel’s glare up at him, along with his wrist rattles to release his bindings.
Making up his mind, he turned towards his Lieutenant “We’ll leave them alone. Whoever they are they run with a crowd way out of our league.”
‘Of course I do. Cause I’m awesome.’ Standing Dean held an arm out for Cass, who took it and stood. “Come on let’s go find something to eat. I’m starving and you could do with a bite too.”
“Honestly I don’t know, but just the thought or idea of my mate being in the same room as him has my instincts screaming at me. I can’t think or function properly when Dean is around him. So I will take his shifts and Dean can do other things to help.”
‘Not going to happen buddy, not till we find out if they are immune to your power. If they are you would be fucked.’ Voice still calm, but slivers of steel making themselves known. Dean would not let his partner face those creatures alone.
Taking aim carefully mind focused only on killing the beast keeping him from his mate, he used all his centuries of battle training to blast his deadly Grace towards the enemy. His ray of precisely directed light shined brighter than a dozen full moons. Giving him perfect clarity to watch as the beast suddenly turned towards him, as if sensing his new resolve at ending her existence. His sole reason for falling from the Gates of Heaven itself still clutched, broken and bloody in her talons.
Dean raised a hand to his head, rubbing the slight ache away. Then it was gone as he felt two fingers pressed against his forehead. Tilting his face, he could see Cass retreating back from helping him. He wanted to know how Cass was feeling, more so than anything else wanted to ask instead he simply raised a wing, glancing at the color. Finding it a deep soothing robin’s egg blue. His Angel was calm and relaxed, he liked that feeling, he liked it a lot. Then he remembered what the bastard had told him yesterday and he growled. Castiel and Sam both stared at him, wondering at his sudden mood change.
Cocking her head to the side, she put her crystals away, then stood and extended her hands over the prone man’s body. “Kilawan Ocelameth Yumar Etheragan Sevaliswen.” A blue cast enveloped her hands, then a dome of a darker blue, mixed with a rusty red formed over the Angel. Flowing over his form like ocean waves there were sparks of electricity flaring at seven points on his body. Lowering her hands, the spell faded away even as she sat heavily in the chair Sam typically sat in.
Sam finally shook of his shock at seeing the wings change color before him. Honestly they had changed almost in an instant, as Cass and Dean held each other. He would have to think on that little nugget of info later, if he had the time. Now he had to deal with his increasingly irate brother. “Umm Rowena was researching a spell she thought might help heal Cass’s wings. She came to the bunker a couple hours ago and that is when she discovered the fairies in the system.”
Castiel glared down at his murmuring mate, less than pleased with his reaction to his ministrations. He had woken before Dean, pressed against his back, his own thick cock straining exceptionally hard that morning. He needed to screw his hunter but the man was being particularly stubborn at not waking up. He preferred his mate to be awake and actually participating in their pleasurable pursuits. Reaching a hand back behind himself, he squeezed one of his oil glands, shuddering in muted pleasure at the feeling. He much preferred it when Dean did it, but he needed the oil for his man’s feathers. They were dry and in need to be oiled less they crack next flight they took.
Hope you all enjoy.
Cass, finally took his eyes off Dean to look at the younger brother. “He is going after those two creatures…”
Now if only he could find a similar happiness.
His hunter, intent on buying some more time, had decided to draw their attention from the crack they were guarding. With a hard sweep of his wings, he launched himself across the clearing. Dismissing them at the last moment, he slid towards one male troll whose very large appendage was at a level he couldn’t miss. It was oozing some sort of sickly green fluid, which looked to be smoking as it fell to the ground. He had no interest in coming in contact with the troll dick or what was dripping out of it. Though he did kinda wonder what the females felt when he bred them with his seed. Probably why they were just as nasty as the males.
When the light faded away, two women and one long haired man stared at the wreckage which was the crushed iron chair and melted pile of Angel cuffs behind it. There was no sign of one Righteous Man or the Angel who loved him.
Dean, not privy to his mate’s most private of thoughts, smiled with love shining in his eyes, matching the calm blue ones he loved so much. “We probably should get up soon. I need to make breakfast and you need to check on Gabriel.”
“Hmmm very well.” Blowing cool breath over his plump dome, he activated his Grace and slowly blew away the muck from Dean’s belly and cock. He had no interest in lapping up swamp water no matter if he did purify it. Over and over, he blew gently raising goose bumps on Dean’s skin as he continued with his task. Going lower, Dean spread his legs to make it easier for Cass to access the parts they were eager to share. Cleaning the mire from his mate, Cass licked a trail from the base of his cock to the tip, listening as Dean groaned with pleasure. He smiled with pleasure, loving how Dean was just more turned on the more he worked him over.
“¿Eres un ángel enviado por Dios para salvarnos?” The village priest asked with his own deep suspicion. (You are an Angel sent from God to save us?) He was an older man but certainly not elderly. Standing just under six feet call, graying chestnut hair, deep naturally black eyes, skin darkened by genetics and a lifetime of working outside. Dressed in no doubt was his own Sunday best, trying to make a good impression, he was able to look Cass directly in the eye.
Eyes narrowing, he tilted his head in the manner he always did when he was in incredulous angry disbelief. “Wait she’s gone? You let her go? Just let her walk out, leaving this mess? Leaving for knows how long?” How could Sammy be so stupid? He would have had her chained up, again. Course Crowley would get a kick out of it, to see his mother chained up again. Speaking of, he really should call the bastard and find out what he was up to. He had been way too quiet as of late.
‘Damn it Cass!’ Dean growled out frustrated but Cass didn’t pay his frustration much attention, not when he could also feel how much Dean was also enjoying his torment. It was good for both of them to simply relax into specific rolls from time to time. This time it was Cass’s turn to take the more dominate roll and let Dean enjoy the attention Cass wanted to lavish him with.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Still Dean I think it would be fine to take a shift…”
Panting heavily, sweat dripping down his face, back on fire from the knife but the black ooze dripping from the handle, onto his skin, he was hard pressed to make it to his knees. He was pretty sure he might have a punctured lung, what with being able to catch his breath. Scrambling as best he could, he looked for a place he could defend or protect himself. Looking at the ceilings, the door frames, hell even the floor to see what Sean may have put in place to guard against them. Only this room was one of the few which had seen extensive remodels. Water damage from some long ago source the culprit, and strangely never found.
Pulling off his cock, Cass gave him a naughty smile as he leaned back on his knees. Gripping Dean’s leg he flipped him back on his belly, untangling his legs and allowing him to get to the really good stuff. Going to the fly of his slacks he undid them, opening them so he could pull his own cock out. It was dripping profusely and he knew he wouldn’t be lasting long once he was in Dean. Reaching towards the drawer he pulled out the cinnamon lube and coated his fingers liberally with the slick substance. Pushing a finger inside Dean, listening to his gasp as he was breached, he worked him open. Adding a second and third finger quickly, using a bit of Grace to make it easier because his own dick was aching to be inside his mate.
“I know they are…” Sammy tried to answer, only to be cut off once again.
The birds with final cries of disgust at their day being interrupted by the mating men, flew off and vowed not to return till they were done. The bullfrogs only shot their tongues out into the air, maybe their were saluting another being who used their tongue so impressively?
SPNSPNSPN
He wasn’t disappointed.
More to come hopefully in a while.
“I’m sorry about this.” Cass stated before pressing his fingers to first one then the other officer. Neither man even saw him move, both collapsed instantly at the touch. Dean jumped to help catch the closer one and together the Angel and hunter managed to get them back in their car. Making sure everything was safe, they would be waking up in about 5 minutes, they returned to their car. Climbing in Dean started it up and sped down the highway. When the cops came to they wouldn’t remember anything about them.
Not that Dean cared, he really didn’t, all he wanted was to get away from the feathered contraptions, which seemed to be connected to his shoulders. He couldn’t control them, they were throwing off his already shaky balance. As he spun around, even more glitter flew into the air, caking him in sparkles of light which caused him to sneeze and it felt like his head wanted to explode.
Charlie and Sam watched as Dean slowly woke up, body shaking as his eyes blinked sleepily. Cass held on as he felt Dean trying to adjust so his ass wasn’t on the uneven rocky terrain. The sharp pointed rock sticking into his left cheek was not comfortable in the least. His eyes started focusing on his surroundings, the minimal light filtering through the canopy broken only by the scar of the trail. His wings wanted to stretch themselves from the cramped position he could feel they had been in for what felt like hours. Raising his hand, he rubbed the side of his face with the heel. “What happened?” Looking around as his eyes adjusted he could see the worried looks. “Sammy what’s going on?” Seeing they were in the middle of the forest, in a part he hadn’t been in before began to worry him even more. He tried spreading his wings instinctually, wanting to make himself look bigger. Cass gentled them, folding them back before they could knock anyone off the trail.
Waving away his first two questions, “Oh I’m coming with, you couldn’t stop me with a million orc warriors or gorgeous goddesses.” She grinned cheekily.
The trees rose several hundred feet over his head, with a wide canopy keeping out most of the sunlight. The wind blowing though made the leaves flutter and dance, causing the light to blink down on him. Birds and small creatures he couldn’t name skittered through the leaves, chittering or cheeping at each other. He could really care less as long as they didn’t shit on his head, course some did look kinda tasty and he was getting hungry. Flying took a lot of energy especially in how hot and humid it was. And speaking of humidity, even now it was starting to shower and it provided no relief from the heat itself. God he hated the jungle, closed in, lousy weather, insects which feasted on you at all times. Or at least they would if Cass wasn’t doing something to keep them away from the both of them.
Dean had been beside himself with rage at the little punks when he discovered his baby gone. He hadn’t hesitated to launch himself into the air, not giving a shit who saw him as he looked all over hell and creation for his car. He found it nearly 20 miles from where he had parked and still booking it. Cass had caught up and only managed to stop Dean from diving down and landing on the roof. Instead he had suggested, in the interest of keeping the car in one piece that he, himself, go and stop it. He could pick it up by the rear bumper and stop it moving, thereby saving it from crashing into the main trees and mailboxes on the old country road it was traveling down.
Two. Rowena standing in front of Cass, Sammy behind her, facing the door Dean was standing in the middle of, was startled completely at the door slamming into the wall.
Above him, rattling around he could hear the HVAC system groaning to life, making heaving noises indicating to him even more that yep there was dust in the system. Patience starting to wane, he wrenched open the door to the workroom stopping in his tracks at the sight before him.
“Yes my lord, they have set aside one of the wards on the East side for those who sent me.”
Eyes bulging in surprise, “What? You’re where? Holy shit how did you get out there? Why are you out there?” He ran his hand through his hair absently as he cleared the last of the fog from his mind.
Cass leaned into his space, voice lowering dangerously. “I do want you Dean, but I’m not allowed to have you. Doesn’t mean I’m going to put up with others encroaching on what I believe should be mine.” And oh shit that wasn’t what he meant to say, evidently the fairy spell was still working its way through his system.
Dean’s mood was the foulest it had been in years when they arrived, he was cold, wind burned, and his wings were a fucking mess. Seriously they needed some serious grooming, the feathers were ruffled, crooked, or folded over each other. He knew it couldn’t be normal, weren’t wings meant to be smooth during flights? So why did they get all bent out of shape during a simple car ride? Plus because they were all fucked up they itched like mad, made him want to just scratch his hands constantly down the damn things to get them to stop.
