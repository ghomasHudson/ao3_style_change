? Like, the chick flick movie? YOU ACTUALLY HAD HIM WATCH THAT?" Sam exclaimed, beginning to laugh extremely hard, his face growing red, mirroring Dean's red face, but for different reasons.
"That's okay. I told you I would love you even if you were the size of a small moon, didn't I?" Dean questioned. Cas nodded and glared at him.
"I...I'm sorry. I was just mad because you were hiding something from me. You said you were mad at Sam, but I know you were not. Why did you lie?" Castiel asked, looking up at Dean. Dean furrowed his eyebrows.
"It'll be okay Dean. You guys love each other more than anyone I have ever seen. When we get home, you can work it out. But first, let's find your angel some clothes that aren't going to snap." Sam joked with him. Dean nodded and went back over to Cas. He put an arm around him and put a kiss to his forehead. Castiel kept a frown, but his features softened a bit. They went inside and straight to the men's section. Cas grabbed two pairs of jeans and a large shirt. Then, he marched into the changing room to try it on. Dean followed him and waited.
"Remember, I'm doing this for the celebration of three million followers, so if I end up dead from embarrassment, I'll blame number three million. Okay, so from what I've heard, our ship name is..."Destiel". Huh. How come I'm not in it more? He gets a whole four letters and I only get two? Why can't it be like...DeanCas or something? Or...maybe Deanstiel." The man's green eyes crinkled in amusement at his own joke. "Oh god, I'm already too deep into this."
"You are welcome. Now, let us find Dean." Cas said. He touched his fingers to Sam's forehead and flew to the prison. They landed in front of a large stone building. It was somewhat menacing, as though it knew its own purpose and showed it. Cas looked around and then gestured for Sam to follow him inside. Cas opened the doors and gripped his angel blade tighter. Sam shifted the hand of his sword and gulped nervously. A scream echoed along the wall, but it was too feminine, most likely another angel. Then, a bloodcurdling scream of both pain and sorrow pierced the near silence. Castiel immediately recognized it, as did Sam. They nodded at each other then began running down the hall. An angel appeared in front of them with an angel sword.
"Yes. You were. But the blame does not belong in solely you, beloved. I overreacted a bit. Apologies." Cas asserted. He sat up against the pillows and looked at Dean's excited green eyes with confusion. "You seem very happy and eager for something. What is it?"
Charlie was wearing a long, sleek dress that nearly matched the color of Sam's shirt. It was strapless, accentuated by a loose necklace hanging around her neck. Her red hair was piled atop her head in an updo, with a curl hanging down the side of her face. She was beaming as she held onto a bouquet of white and red flowers, almost dancing down the aisle. Once the pair got to Dean, the traditional wedding dirge started, signaling the small group to stand. Then, Castiel opened the doors and began walking towards Dean.
Now that was a question they weren’t prepared for but they should have been. “Non-profit,” Sam lied easily. “We help people. Obviously. We… provide therapy for those who have been through certain traumas. We help them fight their demons. The ghosts of their past, so to speak. And we teach self-defense.” Okay, it was a half-lie, but it was so hard to lie to these sweet and trusting faces. Thank god for creative phrasing, too.
Dean sighed as he got into the car with Cas by his side. Castiel wanted to go with him because even though Cas had been with the Winchesters for awhile, he had yet to go grocery shopping, which was apparently important now that Cas ate like there was no tomorrow. They got to the store and went in. Castiel grabbed a cart and pushed it with enthusiasm over being there. Dean shoveled the necessities into the cart, occasionally throwing in something special for one of the residents of the bunker, be it him, Cas, or even Sam or Charlie. Dean made sure to get at least three packs of Oreos, much to the glee of Castiel.
"Just...don't talk about that. I am going to murder any guy who goes near her." Dean growled as he got in the car. His brother kept laughing as they drove to the party supplies store. They got inside and tried to find a worker. An older woman met them, her graying hair was curled neatly and she smiled warmly.
"Woohoo! I got it! It was a total guess too!" Dean laughed, doing a little dance in his chair, then stopping when he realized he was on camera still. "Alright, your turn."
The bed looked imposing, like it was mocking them. At least to Dean. Dean got in on the left side, sliding under the soft sheets and resting his head on the pillow. Castiel plugged in his phone, then got into bed too.
He walked alone, holding only a bouquet of white lilies and red roses. He wore a white tuxedo with a red dress shirt, and a gold tie matching Dean's. His corsage was a pink rose that stood out against the solid material. Cas's usually messy hair was styled neatly, combed back and lightly gelled. He was the most beautiful thing Dean had ever seen, walking down the aisle, smiling incredibly wide with his gorgeous blue eyes brimming with tears. The wedding march seemed to take far too long, but Castiel eventually made it to the pulpit and gripped Dean's hands tightly after handing off the flowers to Charlie. The pastor looked between them, nodded for everyone to sit then began.
Culture session with Karamo is more like... free therapy with Karamo. Dean learns as much about himself as Karamo learns about him.
"Do...do you mean like, sex? Because we have already done that. What do you mean by 'mate', Cas?" Dean asked as he got up from the bed. Castiel looked at the ground, as though ashamed to speak further.
"Hey everyone. I..I have to tell you all something. I know that I haven't posted a video in a few weeks since my collab with IntriguedAssbutt, and here's my reason why; my year long relationship...it just ended." Dean choked out, the screen stuttering for a moment before it came back onto Dean's face, which was slightly less red, but there were fresh tears on his cheeks that had been hidden by the editing. "Many of you may know that I was with a girl named Lisa for the past few months, and even more of you are probably wondering what I mean by a year long relationship when I only met Lisa last spring."
Castiel shrugged and got up from his chair with a heave. His stomach had now grown to a healthy (according to WebMD, which Castiel insisted wasn't accurate. How could gaining THIS much weight be healthy?) 25 centimeters. As soon as he stood, he winced and sat back down, grabbing his calf.
The sound was horrible to hear. It was disbelieving and crippled, and it broke Cas apart to hear it.
"So, Crowley and this chick named Naomi know about the baby? Crap." Sam muttered after hearing the experience at the super market. Dean nodded.
"Yeah, he said good job on the idea, Sammy." Dean complimented, much to Sam's surprise. Sam smiled and put the paints on the counter. After getting back to the bunker, they brought the supplies to the room destined to be a nursery. The floor was covered in plastic and the furniture was yet to be brought in. Castiel walked into the room and saw the pair beginning to open the paint.
"Do not fear Sam, I am still an angel. I can heal your injuries easily. Though, it would be easier on everybody if you tried a bit harder to
"Why the hell would we invite you?" Dean asked from the room. Crowley craned his neck to see the older Winchester on the bed.
"You say 'I, Samuel Winchester, give my blessing to my kin, Dean Winchester and Castiel, Angel of Thursday, to mate their souls for all eternity.' I will handle the rest." Castiel clarified. Sam scoffed.
"P-Please..." Castiel choked out of his thick throat, begging for the man to stop before he went any further. It was at that point that his boxers were slid down his long legs and tossed into the oblivion that must have been beside the bed, since he knew his clothes would not be there when this all ended.
"CAS! What happened? Where did the babies go?" Sam cried as he stood up. Cas looked down at his stomach and furrowed his eyebrows. Then he looked back up.
"Dean! CAS!" Sam called out, catching Cas as he fell over in his seat. Dean got up and went to Cas immediately. Castiel was panting hard and looking between his abdomen and Dean's worried face.
" He tried to keep it from being confrontational, but he was worried. He didn't like disappointing his fans, and he had promised a signing. Hell, he'd already gotten the ticket revenue from selling some pre-tickets for it. Then why wasn't it there.
"Dean, you asked for a portion of my Grace to defend yourself when she pierced the bond. I had assumed it was self conscious, but now I can see it was instinct." Castiel explained.
"Oh calm down moose. I just wanted to stop by and offer my congratulations." He offered, not stepping in because of the line of salt at the door. He looked down at it and raised an eyebrow. "Honestly, you two are so paranoid."
The names were each framed by a pair of intricate wings. Mary Jo's were white, the feathers were interlaced with light spots of grey on the underside, but they were primarily a pure color. Bobby's were coal black, and yet each singular share and design was completely visible. The bottom faded into white a little bit, closely mirroring Mary Jo's. Both pairs were incredible to look at, colors and patterns weaving through seamlessly. They were polar opposites, and yet they had nearly the exact same pattern, and Dean couldn't do much but gape at them.
“Magic spells apparently, Rapunzel! I’m so envious. You have no idea what I go through to maintain this mane.” Jonathan flipped his hair for emphasis. Karamo, though entertained, knew they had a job to do, and he wanted to get to the bottom of Dean’s desire for Cas.
Dean loved using his full name between them, it made their life feel far more real and it cemented Dean's claim on Cas. Castiel looked up with wide innocent eyes. Then he smiled, more devilishly than Dean thought the angel could manage.
"Okay…what brand do you want?" Cas was taken a bit aback. There was different types of beer? He had just assumed they were all the same.
Castiel snorted. "Yeah, you reached real deep for that one, huh? And it's not like he went to some obscure website that no one has ever heard of. It's literally 'fanfiction.net, the most basic thing you could make for a fanfiction website." Castiel criticized. He leaned closer to the screen when he saw the typed words. "Destiel? Huh, that sounds nice. I like it better than what he's suggesting. Deanstiel? Really? It doesn't flow. Destiel sounds like a real name." Castiel noted.
“Yes, I was raised in a very religious family. They kept me under tight wraps and didn’t let me talk to people outside the family.” Tan put a hand over his heart. “A small town, and a small world view weren’t exactly kind to me. It wasn’t until I met Dean that I dared to question that.” Cas glanced at Dean, again sharing that same look Karamo noticed before. Tan put a hand on top of Cas’.
Castiel watched as Dean clicked on the first work in the archive, and he laughed immediately, shutting his bright eyes to just laugh at the fact that not only was the author's name hilarious, but the fact that the first line was him being angry.
Castiel looked down at his stomach. "Extremely hungry, actually. I really want a cheeseburger right now. Dean?" Castiel said in a small voice. Dean cupped his face and smiled lightly.
"Oh. What is a 'baby shower'? I sincerely hope it is not a shower of children." Cas asked innocently. Both Sam and Dean burst into long peals of laughter, much to the discomfort of Castiel.
The producer looked at Jonathan. Jonathan, with his heart of gold who wanted to help anyone and everyone he could. “You know that’s not in the budget right? It would take some extreme string-pulling with Netflix. Have you even talked to your co-stars about this?”
"How do you know about the baby?! Who the hell are you?" He growled at her, raising a fist in preparation to punch her. She remained emotionless, which hinted at being an angel.
Then the drill attacked Dean's mind again, throwing Castiel backwards and out of Dean's thoughts once more. Though he felt utterly broken, Dean had still called him 'babe' and been able to say 'I love you'. Something the shifter never did, and it made Cas swell with longing and love. Sam ran over to the angel, who had been thrown to the ground by the sheer force of the pain in his mind. Castiel got help from Sam to stand.
"He's my dad's kid. After my mom passed, he got really bad for awhile, and before he cleaned up his act, he slept with a woman in one of the towns we stopped in. She called him a few years later and said that Adam was his. We rushed over there, and found out that his mom was dying, so we took him in after that. He mostly stays on his own, but we keep in contact most of the time." Dean smiled. "He's a good kid. I love him as much as I love Sammy."
"I was trying not to pass out from the pain Dean. I think that its fine that I didn't get the joke." Sam muttered as he stood up. Just then, he noticed the blood that had seeped through Castiel's shirt, much like Dean had. His face twisted into one of worry as he began to freak out. "Cas! The baby?"
"It would appear so. But I recommend against it unless it is truly necessary." Cas demanded. Dean nodded in agreement.
"Nah, don't worry. Take your time. I made myself some toast already, do you want some?" Dean offered, but Castiel shook his head.
"Cas? Cas, wake up babe." Dean nudged Castiel's shoulder with his fingers, thinking the angel's face was so adorable while he slept. He didn't even think about the fact that Castiel never slept.
Dean was startled by the gruff sound in his head. He glanced in the rearview mirror and saw Castiel leaning back in the seat with his eyes closed.
"Yeah, but you're my macho older brother who hates all things chick flicky. Apparently, your husband can bring out things I've never seen in you." Sam suggested. Dean nodded and walked over to where Cas was sitting and Dean planted a kiss on the top of his head.
Dean thought for a moment before going alone. The door was still closed, so Dean knocked at it gently. Immediately, the door opened and Cas stood there with a wide grin and paint splattered hands and clothes. He closed the door behind him and looked down at his feet.
“You flirt. You just winked at a million people. Dean’s a whore.” Castiel whispered, hiding his mouth from Dean, but he knew that the other man heard him. Dean grinned at him, and then he looked back at the camera.
Dean looked at him in awe. He sent some reassurance shooting through the bond and squeezed Cas' hand.
Castiel was led to a dark and dirty room near the back of the bar, where he assumed Noah had been too many times with other young men or women. A bed suddenly appeared beneath his back, and his clothes began to come off, one article at a time. Castiel's eyes were closed, but tears welled up in the corners before spilling down the side of his cheeks.
"I will, otherwise Dean will feel all the pain, and I can't have that." Cas assured him. Dean grasped Castiel's hands and looked at him with a small smile.
Dean glanced in the rear view mirror and saw Cas sitting with his arms crossed over his chest in a perfect impersonation of a petulant, sulky child. Before Dean could say anything else, Castiel snapped the bond, cutting it off. Dean suddenly felt alone in his mind, something he hand't felt for nearly five months and is scared him. His eyes got blurry and his chest felt constricted. He tried to keep his eyes on the road and not crash, but he was barely successful as he pulled into the parking lot of the Walmart. Sam noticed that something was off between Dean and Cas, and he was going to get to the bottom of it. He grabbed his brother's arm and pulled him to the side.
"NO! I had to tell her the first time! I am not taking the wrath again." Sam argued. Before Dean could hold out his hand for rock-paper-scissors, a hint of inquiry hint his mind.
"Oh this? This is a shot. It's not too strong, if you'd wanna start out with something lightweight." The man suggested, and Castiel raised his eyebrows in surprise.
"It means that I would bind my Grace to your soul for all of eternity. Basically, we would be each other's forever. But I could not possibly take that from you, I can't take your life from you." Castiel said as he turned to leave, but Dean caught his arm.
"Aren't all of the Leviathans dead?" Castiel blanched, his gritty voice almost startling the Winchesters. "I would be severely disappointed if that year in Purgatory meant nothing." Cas seemed uninterested, even by this, which worried Sam and Dean. Well, at least it worried Sam. Dean just laughed.
"Stop talking so loud! Cas can hear you! He's a celestial being, even while pregnant." Sam whispered. She moved her hand to her mouth. She made the movement of zipping her lips and throwing away the key. Dean rolled his eyes and looked into his mind. he bind wasn't angry any more, in fact it was nearly completely cut off. Dean sighed in relief.
“Hey everyone out there! I’m Impala67, or Dean as many of you guys know, and if you don’t know, then what are you doing here? Nah, I’m kidding. Welcome! This week, I’m going to be doing something a little different than normal. I have gotten a lot of requests about me and IntriguedAssbutt, or as you know him, Castiel. Now, I'm kinda weary about reaching this far into the dark spaces of the Internet, but I have solemnly sworn to you that I would do whatever I needed to do for y'all." The screen split into pieces, so the main view was still of the man's face, but there was a small window in the corner that showed that he was on a website called "Fanfiction.net". "Many of the people that suggested this said I should try a different website than this one, but when I looked things up, this is what came up, so I'll just use this one."
"Well, Dean! We'll be doing something to get to know one another even more! The Newly-Friend game! As seen by some other YouTubers, this game has us write down the answers to certain questions, and the other person has to guess the answer. Whoever gets the most right wins!"
"So, your pregnant. Great. But is it going to hurt you?" Sam asked, worry lining his face. Dean stiffened at the thought. Had he hurt his angel? Like he hurt all the other people he ever cared about in his life?
"Cas. I never really knew it, but you and I were always meant to meet. You pulled me out of a rough spot," Everyone but the pastor chuckled at that. "And I will always be grateful for it. You have saved me and even Sam so many times since then, that I have stopped trying to keep count. You are mine and I am yours, pretty much always. I love you. More than pie, more than a good burger, more than nearly anything, even the Impala. You are and will always be my angel." Dean finished, looking up into Cas' eyes. Tears streamed down his face, coating his smile in salt water. Dean reached between them and took his hand. He slid the ring on Cas' long finger, looking absolutely perfect. The pastor nodded lightly at Dean, then turned to Castiel.
"That...that is impossible! That can't be!" Castiel shouted, now pacing. Dean felt a string of foreign disbelief and anger course through his head. It only took a second to realize that he was feeling Castiel's emotions, not his own.
"Oh don't you demand things from me Mr. Winchester. I will do what I see fit to do. Now. Hadraniel, take him. I will follow shortly." The angel, Hadraniel, nodded stiffly and grabbed Dean's shoulder and flew off. Naomi looked at the shifter and smiled. "You know what to do. His memories and demeanor have been copied to your mind. Which means it should not arouse suspicion from the other Winchester. You know what to do."
"Glad you approve." Dean scoffed, and Castiel narrowed his eyes at Dean, the blue becoming just slits, but he said nothing more. "Okay, so what's the last question?"
Cas got up and led Dean to their room, and once they got there, Cas pulled the door closed behind him and grinned widely. Cas pushed him down to the bed and leaned down to whisper in Dean's ear.
They decided to have the wedding near the end of Cas' first trimester, so he would not be 'the size of a small planet' as Castiel said. It was going to be held in Iowa because same sex marriage wasn't legal in Kansas. Garth, Kevin, Mrs. Tran, Sheriff Jody Mills, and Charlie were all scheduled to meet up in the chapel on December fourth. Sam was set to be the best man, while Charlie was the technical maid of honor, but she insisted on being called the best maid. To the surprise of everyone, Castiel wanted to keep the tradition of white and black, as well as not seeing each other's outfits. After getting his outfit, Cas kept the bond partially closed so that there would be no sneak peaks by Dean. As the day drew nearer, Dean grew more an more nervous, wanting it to go perfectly. When it came time to drive to Iowa, the trio packed up the two garment bags and Sam's new suit into the Impala and drove, only stopping twice for Cas to get something to eat.
"Its only the first month, we've got plenty of time to argue about the gender, lets just get back to the bunker." Sam said, getting into the Impala. Dean got in and once Cas was in the back, he started the car and started the long drive back to the Men of Letters bunker. Dean looked over at Sam, and saw that he was asleep. With a light smile, Dean poked at the bond gently.
"Yes, I do actually. Two sisters and three brothers. Two brothers are twins. Gabriel and Lucifer, then there is Michael, my oldest brother, and my two little sisters, Anna and Ella. Well, our parents named her Raphael, but it was weird, so she goes by Ella now." Castiel explained, and Dean punched his fist up into the air.
"What did you do to my mate?! Who is Naomi?" Dean yelled, his instincts to protect kicking in. Crowley just shook his head.
I know that this one and the last chapter haven't been as long, but the next one will be a Vlog, so it will be longer.
"Jeez, calm down. It's actually good timing because we just talking about baby names. Since Crowley was ever so thoughtful and told us that it was going to be a boy and a girl, we figured out names. The girl will be Mary Elizabeth. The boy is gonna be Robert, after Bobby." Dean announced happily. Sam had a tear running down his cheek.
The hours passed at a grueling pace for Castiel. He watched over Jensen as he slept, like he had done for Dean a few times, wondering what the human emotion was that he felt for Dean, like brothers but more.
"Cas," Jensen said, changing the subject in a low voice, "you should go after Dean when you've got the chance because I think it would be good for the both of you. He pines after you, ya know."
'Well if Dean wasn't ever going to, I'm glad Jensen is.' Jared thought before falling into a deep and dreamless sleep.
Finally, Castiel decided to make Jensen and Jared some breakfast for when they got up. After many tries, he successfully made four eggs and some bacon, just as Jared walked out of his room.
I mean Jensen felt that he practically knew the guy, and sure, he and Misha had had a few questionable moments but he never felt this awkward around anyone besides his girlfriend Danneel when they first met...
"Sorry, I'm not used to this kinds of questions, the Winchesters usually don't care." The angel stated carefully while taking a seat at the kitchen's small table.
"Alright I'll pray to him but just to show you how wrong you are." Jensen folded his hands and closed his eyes, well that's what he assumed you did when you prayed.
Jensen walked over to the cupboards to put away the shelf foods, eager to organize them to take as much time as possible so he didn't have to stare into those big blue eyes.
The motel room was pretty large for the Winchesters. There were three rooms which had equally hideous wallpaper and smelled of mold. Although there was one bed per room and a living space, complete with a kitchenette, disgusting couch, a small radio with a tape player, and TV from the early seventies.
"Yeah, yeah you're right. I just... I need a sec to myself." Dean said, quickly finding a bathroom and slipping into a stall. He took in a deep breath, then another but quicker. Then another, but quicker. That cycle kept going until Dean was suddenly hyperventilating, his heart beating rapidly. 'No, no!' He faintly thought to himself, 'I can't have a panic attack now!'
"This...is Benny Lafyette. He...He was my boyfriend for an entire year." Dean said, his voice barely above a whisper, but his mic caught every word. "My dad never thought I was good enough, and when I realized I was gay, I knew that I could never tell him. He would just be angry at me, and I didn't want that. I haven't lived with him for three years and I'm still terrified of the damn bastard." Dean gave a dark chuckle, no humor tinting his voice. "And rightfully so, apparently." Dean pointed at his bruised eye.
"Tomorrow, I am going to need a few hours with the bond closed so you do not peek at the nursery while I am working on it." Castiel said as he swallowed his last bite of pizza. Dean nodded and stood up to take the paper plates to the trash.
"Don't worry, Sammy. The baby is fine. Its half angel, remember? And besides, Cas said she doesn't have a solid form yet." Dean clarified. Sam sighed in relief, then looked back at Dean.
"Yeah, I know. But i gotta say, its kinda nice just taking a break and hanging out in the Bat Cave." Dean grinned when Sam rolled his eyes. Cas shuffled into the room adorned in a large bathrobe. He normally wore his robe nowadays. Dean liked to call it his 'pregnancy trench coat'. "Morning babe." Dean said happily. The angel nodded in Dean's direction and went immediately to the kitchen for cereal.
"SAM! Where are you? We need to go to Walmart so-" Dean stopped upon seeing a woman standing in the middle of the room. She was frowning, her face creased with worry lines. She had short, dark brown hair and serious blue eyes. She had her hands folded across her middle, looking at Dean with a stern expression.
"The process is not overly complicated. I just need to reach into your mind and once I am in, you need to give me permission before I can perform the bonding. But, I need permission from someone besides you." Castiel said, going through a mental check list. Dean furrowed his eyebrows.
“Uh, thank you so much, but no thanks. It’s just the three of us for now, and too much business at once wouldn’t really work out. Especially from people as famous as you guys.” Sam turned it into a compliment, making Jonathan smile and look away.
"Thank you two so much! But, where is Dean? He told me he was getting the gift. Its been a while since he left." Castiel inquired. Dean sat up straight and smirked behind the ribbon.
"NO!" She screamed as she pushed the drill further into Dean's skull. Castiel felt it before anything could happen. The drill had brushed the bond and now, the bond was going to fight back. It itched for some of Castiel's Grace, and he willingly obliged. At that moment, a blinding light filled Dean's features, allowing him to easily brake the straps that had held him. He stood with white light pouring from his eyes. He looked from Castiel to Sam, then turned to face Naomi.
"So, are you going to buy me a drink, or are we just going to keep talking about nothing?" Castiel asked blandly, knowing how Dean once got a free drink from a waitress, but not knowing the connotations behind the words.
"Castiel, this is mostly about you. And I just hope you believe me." Crowley looked Cas in the eye and sighed. "Naomi knows."
Dean did it often when he was upset or lonely, why not him? Cas thought with a shrug. He grabbed his trench coat to cover his belly and walked out of the bunker. Castiel knew there was one not too far, so he would walk (waddle). It didn't take too long to get there, he stood outside and looked at the neon sign flashing brightly.
Dean laughed out loud and turned to face Castiel. He placed a light kiss on the angel's lips and smiled.
Castiel looked down at his hands, and he squeezed them into fists, then he raised his head back to face the camera, the anger back in his eyes.
"Carry on my wayward son, there'll be peace when you are done, lay your weary head to rest. Don't you cry no more." Cas sang, plucking the lyrics from Dean's head, singing in his deep voice. The angel rested his head on Dean's chest and sighed in complete and utter contentment. Dean responded with a hefty agreement. Sam led Charlie and danced with her as Garth, Kevin, and his mom watched. Jody had left earlier, but she had congratulated the couple and gave them a hastily wrapped gift. The song ended and Garth stood up. He went over to his bag that he had brought and pulled out a white box. Inside was a pie, apple to be precise, and it had two figures of grooms stuck in the top. He put the pie on the table and stepped back proudly.
Dean was on edge. He knew that the ninth month of Cas' pregnancy was going to be stressful, but he had no idea how stressful. Cas was constantly lying down somewhere around the bunker, asking Dean for food through the bond. However, Dean and Sam had to redecorate one if the rooms and turn it into a nursery for the babies. That in itself was a challenge. It stemmed whole arguments.
"Well, I think it is official, we have no food." Sam declared. Dean nodded and got up. He held his hands out for rock-paper-scissors to see who would go to the store.
"If you guys ever go into mind-land while I am in the room, please tell me before I need a shot of insulin to put up with the sweetness that you exude." Sam said as he walked out of the room, but smiling all the way. And why shouldn't he? He was going to be an uncle. Dean bet that he was already planning on how to spoil the kid rotten.
"I'm gonna regret it later if I don't get you home with me." He whispered. Castiel widened his eyes and got up from the stool.
"Sam, Dean and I just talked...and would you be opposed to a baby shower for me?" Cas asked with intrigued eyes. Sam stopped from laughing from earlier and thought for a second.
"We love you all, and we'll talk to you soon." The two waved, and the screen went black for a moment, then something flashed on screen. A note on a black screen in white writing.
"Thank you, Sam. I'll take that into consideration." Cas said neutrally, and he stepped ahead of Sam, so he was between the oldest and youngest Winchester.
It was month two of Castiel's pregnancy, and all was well. The trio continued to hunt on occasion, mostly easy things like routine salt and burns, or small vampire nests. They stayed in the bunker most of the time, not that it was a problem. It had enough old films to entertain someone for a year. Dean and Cas watched old classics so that Castiel could finally get many of the so called 'popular culture' references, even though a majority of the movies came out before 1950. All was normal in the Winchester family. Until Dean and Castiel accidentally brought on the wrath of a red haired she-devil...
He checked his tag on Tumblr and tons of people were congratulating him on his achievement, how he was that much closer to a Diamond Play Button, but he noticed that one person had sent him something first. Dean. A little notice from Impala67 was at the very bottom of his screen, and it was a message.
"That'll be okay. But it's gonna take a few days for the paint to be completely dry and ready. We are going to do the base coat today, and maybe the second. If it needs it, then a third tomorrow. If you need us, tell me through the bond, okay? I might not hear out loud." Dean told Cas, giving him a tender kiss and then went to work on the room. It took two hours to do the first coat. Then, after lunch, Sam and Dean painted on the second coat. The second took longer, mostly because of the slight paint fight that Dean started by 'accidentally' throwing the roller behind him, hitting Sam in the back. By the end of the day, they were exhausted, red, and had a perfectly painted room. Dean slumped into the kitchen to scrounge up some food, and he found Castiel with three plates of food on the table, sitting with a big smile on his face.
"Sam and I have an extra present for you. Just keep your eyes closed for a second." Charlie told him. Dean looked at them with confusion, and then Sam held up some wrapping paper and a big, red bow from the bag he got from the market and grinned evilly. Before Dean could run, Sam tackled him to the ground and began wrapping Dean in the paper. After a few minutes, Sam managed to immobilize him and sat him on the ground behind the biggest present, so he couldn't be seen. The bow was placed on his head and it also covered his mouth so he couldn't talk. He could hear what was going on though.
"Sorta. Alright...I see your song as being..."Moonlight Sonata" by Beethoven." Dean asked hopefully. Castiel raised his eyebrows.
Dean heard the squeak of a chair that Cas sat in, then the rumpling and ripping of paper. Small "thank you"s and gasps of surprise came from Cas as he opened each present. The only two that remained were the cribs. And Dean. Dean heard the chair screech against the concrete floor, like it turned around. The presents were taken away and Dean could see that he was right. Sam and Charlie stifled giggles as they looked at Dean in the pink and blue paper with the bright red bow,, but they kept it together and Cas opened the last two.
"Dean! Beloved, please! Answer me!" Cas yelled as he ran to the slumped body of his husband. Sam felt tears swell behind his eyes, but he pushed then back and felt for a pulse on Dean's neck. He sighed in relief as he found it, weak, but still pumping.
“It sounds like a story out of a movie.” Tan beat Karamo to the punch, and he smiled at them both. “We’ve heard a few things from Dean, but what about you, Cas? Can we learn more about you?” Tan inquired. Cas frowned, but he looked at Dean, then back at the group.
"Greatest fear." Castiel decided, and Dean widened his eyes a little bit, and he looked at his cards.
"I am Castiel Winchester. Angel of the Lord and not the person that you planned on assaulting. Leave now and never let me see your putrid face ever again." Castiel said, his voice echoing loudly off the walls, his power evident. The drunk nodded furiously as tears streaked down his dirty face. Cas let him fall to the ground, and as soon as he hit the stone, he started running away. Cas sighed in relief and leaned against the wall. He cradled his stomach tenderly and pulled himself off the wall. Castiel walked back to the bunker without incident. He got back and went to the shower, trying to wash off the filth he felt from that disgusting man. After the nearly hour long shower, he went to his and Dean's room and curled up on the bed. It was really cold, more than usual. But Castiel just wanted to sleep and forget everything.
"My sincerest apologies, Charlie. I did not expect the 'mood swing'." Castiel explained, but Charlie just smiled good naturedly.
Cas grinned and got out of the chair and knelt down beside Dean and began to tear the paper from his body. Charlie and Sam left the room to give them a little privacy, and Dean couldn't be happier for that. As each strip left Dean's body, Dean wondered more and more why his arms were still pinned to his sides. Also, the ribbon was still across his mouth.
"Ding ding ding." Castiel said, though it wasn't as excited as he was a few minutes ago. "Before you try to make this deep and meaningful and...whatever, let's just skip that and go on to yours. I say it's...lizards." Castiel shrugged.
But of course, there were problems; they were the Winchesters, there were bound to be problems. Castiel could no longer use many of his angelic powers, so Sam and Dean had to leave him alone in the bunker when they found a relatively close hunt. Cas knew that monsters wouldn't stop attacking just because he was pregnant, but it didn't mean he was happy with the outcome. The bond was kept strong though between Dean and Cas. Sometimes Dean would send a hello from Sam too, mostly to brighten his angel's mood. But however strong the bond was, it could never make up for the lack of touch between them. It left Castiel feeling very lonely, waiting for his hunter to come home.
A lot of you guys might not know...but we went to therapy together for awhile. When I was in Kansas for a few weeks, he invited me to join him, and it was useful, but I had to go back to Illinois."
"Yeah, don't worry. We will find him." Sam reassured Castiel. Then, the pair heard a scream echo from a side room. It was obvious it was Dean, so Castiel immediately flew to the room, leaving Sam behind in his effort to find Dean.
Dean finally quieted after about twenty minutes of persistent yelling and pestering, and he came into Castiel's room with an air of pride. "I got my event back." He beamed. "I was able to put up such a fuss that it was either get it back or lose me." Dean smirked, and Castiel just scoffed.
Dean made a face and was soon bombarded by an audio tech who hooked him up to a body mic, clipping the microphone to his collar and fastening the battery pack to his waistband. This was the weirdest thing he’d ever been a part of. Sam seemed much more at ease with it and he sat in one of the chairs he was directed to sit in. They helped him change his position for the best backdrop and lighting, but more lighting was added and a camera was set up on a tripod. He was instructed to explain why he nominated Dean for the Queer Eye makeover.
The first stop was Babies R Us, so Sam could get a gift for the kids. He managed to find a reasonably priced crib and got two. They also found clothes, bottles, formula, diapers and a few other things that the teenage worker who helped them said were 'must haves'.
"NO!" Dean stood up and looked over the paper, finding a number to call. "I'll be right back." Dean said as he held his phone to his ear and left the room to yell at some people. Castiel stayed put, looking at the paper some more. When he found out about the cancellation, he had gotten really upset too, but he didn't know what he could do. It wasn't his event even. He stood up and went to his room, passing Dean's on the way.
"Well, then pick a song I know! I wanna win." Dean said, and he looked at Castiel for the next question, which was
Dean received an agreement as he led Charlie to Castiel. As soon as they entered the room, Charlie bombarded Cas with a hug/tackle. She babbled endlessly about boys vs. girls and how the baby will be lucky to have an aunt as cool as her. Dean handed the package of Oreos to Cas and slid an arm around his waist. Castiel absentmindedly ate the cookies and answered the questions posed to him. But as he finished the package, he looked down at it with confusion.
"We've talked about this, Dean. You can do this. There's a way more likely chance of crashing in a car than in a plane, and you can have some wine on board." Castiel reminded him, and Dean nodded, swallowing hard.
"Yeah, it's exciting, all of this." Castiel was silent for a little bit, then he sighed. "I know this will inspire so many fanfictions, and maybe some day we'll post a reaction video to them together, but not until later on." Castiel assured them.
"Yeah, I know. But, even if I put this on the Internet and say John Winchester punched me in the face, nothing will happen to him, because something is wrong with that fucker and no matter what I do, I can't get him caught. I tried to call the police when I was ten and he tried to beat me, and the cops just laughed it off as a prank call. I tried to stop him from hurting Sam once, but the woman I got to help only came after Dad was gone and Sam was asleep. I can't..." Dean pressed his face into his hands an took a deep breathe.
Dean got up from the couch and ran to his and Cas' room. Inside was Cas, looking down at his waist where his pants were. Dean ran up to him and grabbed his hands.
"We are NOT calling our baby a nephilim. She is going to be a baby, not some monster." Dean said, subconciously getting closer to Castiel. A slight glimmer of confusion shone in the back of Dean's mind, but then a crashing sensation filled his mind as he felt complete and utter love oozing through the bond from Castiel. Cas smiled visibly and looked at Dean as they entwined their fingers between them.
"Do you feel like there is anything wrong? Like, any angel senses that are off?" Dean inquired as he got off the couch, then knelt down to be eye to eye with Castiel. "Tell me everything."
"Don't you dare say that I would throw it away. For once, I want to do something that I want. Something that will make me happy! Cas is what I want, and you can't see that. Why? You are the one who practically forced us to admit our feelings to each other, so what's your problem now?" Dean demanded, fury rising in his voice. Instead of looking scared, or even sticking his ground, Sam started laughing.
"Is it a girl or a boy?" Sam asked, unable to stand it anymore. Crowley looked slyly at him and raised an eyebrow.
"Well, technically they are for Mary Jo and Bobby, but we are giving them to you." Sam elaborated for Cas. Cas moved his lips in a small 'o' and followed the other three people into the garage. Once inside, there was a large pile of neatly wrapped presents. The biggest ones, like the cribs were in the back, and the small bundles of clothes and toys lined the front. Charlie covered Cas' eyes again and giggled.
"My name is Cas...Cas, just Cas." He decided not to say the rest of his name, because the Winchesters always used different names when they spoke to people.
"Do angels get sick?" Dean asked with concern. Castiel shrugged, trying to play off any worry as nonchalance.
Cas slipped back into sleep, accidentally sending slight glimpses of a colorful dream from Cas and a light snore coming from the passenger seat where Sam slept off his injury. Dean sighed and drove on.
Dean could feel Cas turn to look at him, as well as the confusion in his mind about the base of the question.
"S-So that's h-how you see me?" He gasped out between heaving laughs. "A-As angry?" He finally was able to calm down, and he realized he missed some of the video. "Shit, hang on." He rewinded it, so that he could see it again, and he watched as Dean read the story aloud. "But he has a point, why is Sam in this? He's literally just in this to convince Dean to make a move. If he was really in this, then he would talk to us both. Sam is a good man, and he wouldn't just throw Dean into the fray." Castiel said, his brow furrowing as the video continued. "And he would not be a cockblock. Plus, I don't understand what he is cockblocking. This story doesn't have any sex in it."
There is no excuse on why I didn't get this up sooner. I'm so sorry. But its here now and that's what matters.
"I-I've been trying to call him for the past few days now, but he hasn't been answering the phone. God, guys I am so worried about him. He's...Dean will worry about someone's wants before he thinks of his own
"After that rude comment, I may just leave. But I came all the way from Kansas to do this with you, so you better make it good. Why don't you tell us what we'll be doing today?" Dean asked, putting his hands on his hips and looking at Castiel.
This sounded like every single romantic movie ever made, yet Dean clearly had not yet wrangled his feelings for Cas. Karamo could see the smile Dean flashed at Cas, and the warm looks on their faces, as if sharing an unknown joke. Karamo recognized it from his own relationship experience.
"You better you little bitch." Dean warned, all anger gone from his voice. Sam widened his grin and then frowned.
"I...I wanted a drink...b-but I had no idea what to get." Castiel croaked out, every word becoming easier to speak, but that didn't mean it was easy to talk about it. "I-I asked the man beside me, and he told me that the gold liquid was not too strong, and after a few shots of that...I-I went to something stronger. B-But everything changed after I came back from the bathroom. I-I couldn't speak...I-I could hardly move..." Castiel shut his eyes tightly, the events of the night before all too clear in his mind.
It was originally Dean's idea. Of course, Castiel had said nothing against it, since he didn't often say anything about anything any more, but nonetheless, Team Free Will ended up in a bar in the middle of Lebanon, near enough to the bunker that they could walk in case of getting too drunk, which none of them expected.
"Is this okay?" Cas asked, sighing. Dean smiled and tried to break the tension. He walked over to him and slid his arms around his waist.
"I think I might be able to figure out what it is. I am going to need your help though." He stated as he got off of the bed.
“This just took a major turn,” Karamo told the camera. “I thought it was strange when Sam was playing the No-Pronouns game, but now? I get it. So, if getting Dean to admit his feelings for Cas is one of the end goals here, we’re going to have to get to know Cas a little to figure out how to approach things. Ideally, he likes Dean the way he is, but won’t mind a little improvement. It never hurts to impress and go the extra mile.”
"Hey, Charlie?...No we aren't cancelling, I was calling because we have a change in plans...No...Yes, surprise party for Cas...Haha, no. Dean screwed up, so we are helping him apologize...Okay, bye." Sam hung up and turned to Dean who was grabbing the keys to the Impala. Dean was focusing on the bond. He pried it open for a second and sent a few waves of mock disapproval.
"There is something. I can feel an addition to my Grace. Almost like it is there, plus some more. It feels uncomfortable, but not painful. Dean. I don't like it. It doesn't feel right...it doesn't feel normal." Castiel admitted as he looked at his hunter with azure eyes. A pair of jade stones met them with concern and love.
"Did you think they were gonna be cheap? Just because we were, doesn't mean you would ever allow your little princess to have anything hard in her life. I feel sorry for whoever tries to date her." Sam cooed, and Dean paled.
"Hello, Charlie. It is very nice to see you. Especially in this circumstance. I have not seen you since the wedding. You look well." Castiel commented. Charlie nodded and gave him a big hug.
"I didn't tell Dean, so I won't tell you, Sam. I want it to be a surprise. Though, once you are done with painting this room, I want to be in here alone." Castiel requested politely. Sam as Dean exchanged a look, then shrugged simultaneously.
"Can I come in and see what Cas was doing now?" Sam asked from behind the door. Dean peeled himself away from the angel to open the door. Sam walked in and took in the wings on the walls. "Holy...Cas. Those are amazing. Where did you get the design pattern?" Sam wondered out loud.
With everything that happened during their first ‘round trip to purgatory, after losing Cas’ grip and returning without him, Dean swore he would never come back. And yet here he is, lost amongst the forest, desperately avoiding the Leviathans.
He’d never experienced motion sickness as an angel. But as a human, Cas experienced vertigo from the strangest things. The beat of electronica music, the shift of the floor when someone paces back and forth, looking up after reading small-print for hours. He thought humanity would ground him to the earth; it only loosened his connection.
Black spots dance across Dean’s vision, and he almost thinks the look in Castiel’s eyes change, that the tension in the shoulder with the angel blade loses tension. But Dean can barely tell what’s up and what’s down.
If only he could put his mouth to good use and say things that weren’t accusing or defensive. Much like everything else in his life, everything he touches is turned into a weapon. Words are by no means an exception to this. If he’s honest, he should keep his mouth clear of them.
A tremor runs down his hand. He’s letting down the world, he’s letting down Sam and Eileen and Jack, and he’s letting God win. And he’s about to lose his best friend.
He keeps rocking, back and forth. He resumes his song, track number eight. He dares to whisper a few of the words under his breath. It’s enough to lull Jack to sleep. Maybe one day, it will be enough for him, too.
Dean enters the library in a rush, a gust of air rustling some loose papers on the table. There is a gleam in his eyes that Sam hasn’t seen in a long time. It makes Sam pause.
Cas walks to the passenger side without comment. He lets Dean air out his grievances to the crickets. He hopes the crickets enjoy this performance.
Dean rocks Jack back and forth, shushing him lightly as they move from the bedroom to the kitchen. It manages to bring Jack’s volume down, but he still cries and cries all the way.
Dean wraps himself around Cas, hunching over to protect him from the wind. He presses his warm cheek to Cas’ cold one. He squeezes his eyes shut. In Cas’ ear, Dean whispers, “We’re going home.”
Sam sits in one of the lawn chairs, his too-long legs sprawled out in front of him. Eileen sits in his lap, her arms wrapped around his shoulders, the smile on her face clear as day. Sam has a stick with marshmallows roasting over the fire.
From behind them, back at the fire, the strum of a guitar fills the air, followed by the twang of a banjo. It’s far enough into the night that the family has pulled out the instruments. Cas wonders if the noise will be enough to wake Jack. He can see Dean running through the same thoughts. Thankfully, they keep the music quiet, plucking away at the strings in harmony rather than giving a full-blown musical performance.
Cas can hear his footsteps through the grass. He’s back from inside the house, from putting Jack down for the night.
Dean is wrong a lot in his life, he’s always making mistakes, blind to the obvious. But this is the first time he doesn’t mind being proved wrong. For the first time in a very long time, being wrong can be something good. He doesn’t have a lot of love to give, he thinks, and he doesn’t quite know how to deliver what love there is, but he’s trying. He’ll make it work. He’ll figure it out.
Dean throws a diaper cloth over his shoulder and reaches into the bassinet and lifts Jack out. “Hey, buddy,” he says, getting his arms properly under Jack. “That’s a big fuss for one little man.”
There’s no colour, no life, no sunlight. It numbs his skin. It forces him to trust his gut. Something he should have done a long time ago.
Deans knees pop as he crouches next to Cas, his eyes also trained on the Lampyridae resting on Cas’ finger.
“That’s much better,” Dean says as he lifts Jack up to his shoulders, exaggerating the effort required. Jack giggles as he’s swung up to Dean’s shoulders, his legs dangling down against Dean’s chest.
It’s not the first time Dean has thought it, nor is it the first time he’s felt it with every sinew in his body, but it steals his breath every time. Apparently, that feeling isn’t exclusive to Earth either.
Dean sits slowly into the rocking chair, watching Jack. He doesn’t move an inch in Dean’s arms, content in the blanket.
They did it; they got them all back. Cas, Eileen, Charlie, Mom, Bobby, Rufus: anyone and everyone they could find scattered around in all planes of the afterlife (they didn’t bother going after John; that’s a man that’s better laid to rest). It was a lot easier than Dean or Sam could have ever predicted. Almost like the author simply had to put the pen to page and end the suffering. But that’s here nor there.
Then they turned onto the highway, the tires smooth against the cement. Like soft-serve ice-cream. Baby’s engine revved, adjusting to highway speed, like the stern voice of God's chastisement. The uneven splatter of bugs hitting the windshield reminded Castiel of the sound of plucked guitar strings. He misses the times when Dean would play for him. The wind blew against the car. It was like Sam’s hairdryer against Cas’ ear. It was like the vortex of The Empty chucking them back to Earth. Dean had to raise his volume to hear his own voice over the calamity. Castiel sat in the passenger seat, hands clasped in front of him. They’re two hours away from the bunker. A relatively short trip in Winchester experience. But there’s too many sounds, too many senses. Castiel can’t focus on Dean’s voice; he can’t wrap his head around
He can see it in Sam’s face as well, his searching look around every corner, hoping for Eileen to appear and run into his arms. The way Sam has no one to spend his day with. Dean feels similarly. What he wouldn’t give to have his family back. Sure he has Sammy and Sam has him, but they’ve relied on each other solely for too long. They need other people to share their lives with. But there’s no one left – everyone’s dead, lost, or otherwise. They were family, too, and they didn’t need Winchester blood to feel welcome around the bunker. Now the bunker is unsettlingly quiet. There’s no activity, no life to be had within its walls. The bunker is as dead as everyone they’ve lost.
But Dean won’t let him. They’ve been through this once before, already. Castiel as a human was not a welcome fixture in Dean’s life.
It was supposed to be an easy grab-‘n’-go for the Leviathan Blossom. But with Chuck at the helm, nothing was ever easy. He looks down on the timer counting down on his phone.
And most of all, he doesn’t understand why his heart flutters and fights against the weight of grief when he thinks about Cas holding Jack in his arms, at Cas singing Jack to sleep with all the wrong lyrics. He was part of the family. Cas was so inherently a part of him that Dean, Dean didn’t know what to do without him.
“Cas,” Dean begins before trailing off. He opens his mouth, shuts it. He finally says, “I had to do it, to get you back.” Dean lifts the string out from around his neck. “It’s right here.” The ice-blue of Castiel’s grace swims in the small vial, its pronounced glow ebbing and flowing.
Because if this is as close as Dean can get to being with Cas again, then so be it. If the last bit of Cas’ heart that exists lies in this little baby, in Jack, then Dean will care for it and nurture it with everything he has.
The distinction between human skin and angel claim has faded over the many years since his return from hell. Much like how Cas has made a life for himself amongst humanity – adopting the intricacies that come with a life on earth. Sure, he’s still got some catching up to do here and there, but it’s those unpredictable missing pieces that makes Castiel
Dean's eyes flick back to Cas, and he can see it written all over Cas' face. "Okay," he says, his tone metaphorically changing gears. "Talk to me."
Dean looks up at Cas, resting back on his knees. All this time with him, all these feelings he’d had hidden away for being silly, for being
Dean leans his head away, briefly. “Hey,” he says, feigning insult. He leans back in; his breath is warm against Cas’ chest. “Didn’t mean to take so long.”
“Cas, this isn’t you,” Dean says through gritted teeth, blood trailing out of his mouth. “This isn’t you!”
Dean laughs, the sound rumbling through his chest, “I know, I know, you rebuilt me just fine. It’s a figure of speech.” Dean has them moving again, not bothering to match the music’s rhythm.
It makes everyone double over laughing, and Jack laughs right along with them. Dean stands next to Sam and Eileen’s chair, watching the fire.
“Happy five months,” Dean grins up at him, pressing his face into the space of Cas’ neck. “What sort of snacks did you pack?”
. The bunker isn’t Castiel’s home, not really. It is a place to stay, very graciously offered by the Winchesters. He doesn't have a home. Once, long ago he considered Heaven a place to belong. He'd strove for acceptance amongst his peers, his brothers and sisters. He never managed to accomplish it. Heaven would never be home.
“You gotta funny idea of romantic,” he says in a low voice, staring up at the faint white stars blinking down at them.
Dean steps towards Cas, offering Cas his hand. Cas takes Dean’s hand, stepping up to meet him. Before Cas can step away and give Dean the space he so often desires (yet rarely abides by these days), Dean steps further into Cas’ space, still holding his hand, and rests his other hand on Cas’ back. He starts swaying as in time as he can get to the distant music.
. Dean is real. Then why did he lie? He knows how much Dean needs him, but it couldn't be worth such a monumental falsehood. Why would Dean want him back if he didn’t mean it?
Dean holds back a laugh. “Let’s get the hell out of here,” he says, “And just leave the radio. We’re out of range is all.”
He’s shouting and screaming at the abyss, calling out for Cas. It doesn’t do him any good; the ooze eats his words, smothering them.
The firefly on Cas’ finger spreads its wings tentatively. It half-closes its wings before spreading them again, this time fully, and taking off. It flies up into the air to join the other small beads of light around them.
Cas doesn’t mean for the obviousness of it all to bleed so condescendingly into his voice when he says, “Then I’m staying.”
Jack lets go of Dean’s pinkie, and his tongue feels for something that will actually feed him. No such luck. Jack opens his mouth to start crying again as Dean grabs the bottle in the cup, giving the contents a swirl, and tests the formula against his own skin.
Around his chest, The Empty retreats, sucking itself away from Dean’s heart. It pulls away from his hands, following the path of his arms back to his shoulders. He isn't burdened; he's glowing, he's free.
Cas shuts his eyes. It’s rough and it’s rushed and he’s never felt so grounded. He isn’t in The Empty, he isn’t in the impala. He’s in Dean’s arms, he’s in the meadow. They’re warm under the sun, the heavy weight of clouds passing overhead. He can feel the petals of the wildflowers, the sharp point of thorns on the stems.
“Then what,” Dean repeats airily. He tilts his head up, shaking it. “Whatever we want, man. Whatever you want, since you’re not staying.”
Cas walked away from the fire, away from the circle of family and friends mindlessly chatting away. He never knew how warm love could be; the heat created from fire held no comparison to the connection of love.
The wind picks up, cool against Dean’s cheeks as he breathes in sharply. Despite the three months that had passed since The Empty had claimed Cas again, he finds himself caught off guard by the simplest of things. The coffee mug he used to share with Cas. A small, wilting plant for sale at the hardware store. The colour of orioles.
Cas goes to leave, Dean’s hand still firmly in his. He gives it a squeeze as he leads them out of the house.
The slam of their truck doors rang through the night. Moths and mosquitos swarm around the headlights before they shut off. Dean swats at some of them. The dew is heavy in the air.
Cas can’t hide the rude obviousness from bleeding into his voice. “Yes. Do you want the marshmallow out of your hair or not?”
“Big yawn,” Dean says, rubbing Jack’s tummy. He grabs the swaddling blanket, and arranges it to wrap around Jack. He tucks Jack’s arms in, tucking the blanket around his sides, and brings him into his chest. Jack coos, and his eyes droop closed, and he tilts his head towards Dean. It’s the first time Dean lets himself smile all night, albeit a very tight smile.
"Raphael is winning right now. As you know, it is utter chaos in heaven. We're trying our best, but there is no way right now that we can win." Cas let out a defeated sigh and dragged his hand through his unruly hair once again before moving his hand to straighten out his tie, "But all is well. We will defeat Raphael no matter how many angels it takes."
Castiel stared into Jensen's eyes with an unreadable expression before leaning in to place his lips upon the other man's and easing into a slow but sweet kiss. Jensen's eyes fluttered closed as he remembered an afternoon of bliss in his trailer with Misha. Maybe her should break up with Danneel for Misha..... To avoid moaning Misha's name into Castiel's mouth, Jensen pulled away breathless.
A distant crack of noise was heard once more as the raging storm flooded nearby gutters and potholes, knocking down leaves and making flags dance. Clanging of swords and ripples of magic seemed amplified in the dead of night when all were asleep except Dean and the land of Camelot.
He rebuttoned his flannel, and headed down the hall to their secret place. He turned the corner and saw his best friend curled in a ball under a table.
"Anything that can be counted as classic rock, Dean listens to. Or as you humans say 'digs it.'" Jensen chuckled and then shrugged.
"Jensen, I apologize. Dean has never treated me as you have." The angel stood up and brushed off is trench-coat.
Cas could see the anger flush rising to Dean's face and knew he had to be calmed down or he would explode. Cas scooted closer to Dean and ran his fingers through Dean's gelled mess of hair.
"What do you need Cas?" Dean's voice was warming up again, the grit and sand was being washed away by the tide of use.
Dean hesitated, the world seemed to be slightly tilted, like he was looking out the window of a carnival ride.
Dean was standing on the porch while Cas and Sam played in the snow. Sam held out his arms and fell face first into the snow, trying to copy Cas's movements to make a snow angel.
Dean grumbled every name that his father had yelled at him as he stalked into the snow, promptly after throwing a snowball at Cas's face.
'Geez, how lucky am I? I get to be stuck with him for longer. Yay!' Jensen thought as he watched Jared sit up, not knowing that the same thought was running through his co-star's head.
It's Jensen. I know you won't believe this but while you and Sam were in my world, me and Jared were in yours. We left you some food and some pie but I think I should tell you something. You should talk to Castiel. Not ask him for stuff, but really talk to him. He's an interesting guy. Show him some love and treat him well. He doesn't have to help you and Sammy, but he does. Ask him about the war, ask him about his siblings, ask about God. Ask about sports for heaven's sake just talk to him. And it's alright to show him your feelings. I know the chemistry you guys have, and your feelings because I am you. Do it for me.
"That's hard! I don't listen to that much music besides classical!" Castiel whined, but he nonetheless wrote something down.
"Cas, what's going on? Why is Dean crying?" Sam asked, confusion dancing across his face. Castiel looked at him with fury in his stare.
"She told me this may happen. And that you would probably kill me no matter what, so I might as well tell you. Naomi has Dean. She is keeping him so I can maintain a link for his memories and demeanor. I was suppose to keep an eye on you and tell Heaven what I saw. They then told me that if I hurt you emotionally, then you could go into premature labor, which would most likely kill both the nephilims." He admitted. He looked up at Sam, then to Castiel. "I apologize, but they were going to kill my family and me if I didn't. I will tell you where he is, just...please don't kill me!" He pleaded, breaking into a pile of sobs. Castiel exchanged looks with Sam before nudging him with the knife.
On opposite walls were names. 'Mary Joanna' was scripted neatly onto the left wall, in black elegant strokes. The right wall held the words 'Robert John' in large, bold letters. It was just as elegant, but more masculine in form and the letters were in white. But that wasn't what got Dean's attention.
Dean focused and sent a mental image of the two of them in Dean's bed doing a few...activities. The sharp inhale of breath beside him signified that he got it. Embarrassment tinted the bond in a sheepish red hue.
"Just lay back and enjoy this, Cas. I know you will." A calloused hand touched the inside of Castiel's thigh, then his other thigh, pulling them apart so Cas was spread out beneath the vile man. Something hot and thick pressed against his virginal opening, nothing to ease it's way at all.
“Not to switch the mood too abruptly, but you mentioned you guys work together,” Antoni recalled. “What do you all do?”
Benny. That dickhead. Thinking about him made Dean sick to his stomach. Or was that last night's pizza? He didn't quite know. Dean stretched and noticed his suitcase was still mostly unpacked. Riiight. They were leaving for LA that evening for VidCon, even if it wasn't actually in LA. Dean wasn't a huge fan of California, but it was a good time of year for it. It was warm and there weren't too many people at the moment. Dean did wish that Sam had been able to come down to see him, but he had to work on stuff up in Northern California. Dean didn't mind too much.
"H-Hep..." Castiel whispered, praying to his absent Father that whoever was there would hear his plea.
"That is good. I think." Dean said, stretching out his hand and placing it on Castiel's stomach. Beneath the fabric of the shirt, Dean could feel the loss of some of the muscle and an addition of a hard spot at his navel. Dean looked around and made sure that Sam was elsewhere, then he lifted Cas' shirt and placed peppered kisses along his belly. Pink, bubbly happiness and lime green relaxation dripped into Dean's mind, stemming from Cas.
"So, we would get angel married?" Dean asked, a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he pulled Castiel towards him, sliding his hands around his waist. "Because that sounds wonderful." Castiel pulled away violently and turned to glare at the hunter with anger in his eyes, which made them shine with blue light.
Castiel didn't know what it was, but there was something off about Dean. Besides the fact that he had cut off their bond for now a week, but also that he was getting distant from Cas. Whenever he got a leg cramp, or he was hungry, instead of helping him, he would just sort of watch him. Dean usually helped, but now he became an almost outside person viewing the inside.
Dean shuddered involuntarily at the nickname, and he took Castiel's hands and took him to his-their room. Now that Castiel needed sleep, the bed belonged to both of them now. They reached the room and Castiel used his Grace to close the door behind them. They got undressed until they remained only in their boxers and Dean pulled back the covers, sliding into the sheets. They wrapped their arms around each other and Cas laid his head on Dean's chest and sighed.
"Of course, Dean. I wouldn't think to do anything different." He promised, and they boarded the plane.
"June, thank you very much for speaking to me, but I believe it is time for me to leave." Cas said as he put down a few dollars for the beer. She looked at the man who was swaying on his feet and scowled.
Cas landed with a thud, groaning in pain has he felt his belly skin growing back over the babies. Dean landed on top of him, and Sam was on the ground somewhere close. But all Castiel could comprehend was the wonderful presence of Dean above him once more...even if he weighed more than he remembered. Dean groaned loudly and rolled off of Castiel. Cas sat up with difficulty and looked at Dean. He pressed frantic kisses all over Dean's face, trying to get him to respond.
Dean's eyes fluttered open. Had he closed them? He must have. Castiel was standing in front of him, a concerned look on his face and a hand on Dean's cheek.
"Cas, what's up with you? You were mad at me in the car, and even before we left, just talk to me." Dean pleaded to Cas. The angel fell onto the bed and buried his head in his hands.
"Are we going or not?" He asked, sending a hint of annoyance to Dean. They shrugged and followed him out. Dean got into the driver's seat next to Sam in the passenger seat. For some reason, swells of red anger kept washing against the bond, making Dean absolutely confused.
"Thanks, Cas. That means a lot to me." Dean said honestly, and before they could get too awkward, Castiel turned to the camera.
"Cas. Listen to me. I want to be with you forever, no matter what. And if this means that even after I die, we are together, that sweetens the deal far more. I want to be yours, and I want you to be mine. And nothing will ever change that. Okay?" Dean asked. Castiel had saltwater tears streaming down his cheeks by this time.
"Oh Kevin! Haven't seen you in awhile. Mrs. Tran, how do you do? Actually, I don't care, I am not here for you. I am here for the happy couple and their little bun in the oven." Crowley said, walking over to Cas and Dean. Dean wrapped and arm around his new husband protectively.
"I don't normally ask much of you guys, but could you please make this man's life a living Hell? Please, he deserves every second of it, and I don't care if the cops come after me for sending you out on him, but I don't want Dean to go un-avenged. He deserves happiness, even if it's after all this happened to him." Castiel sighed, and he rubbed his eyes heavily, his anger draining out of him.
"No worries. My aunt Jenny was horrible when she was pregnant! Though...she didn't have the powers of Heaven behind her." She mused. Castiel blushed a deep red and left the room to toss away the empty package of Oreos. Dean and Charlie walked out to the library where Sam had been sitting to meet up with him. Charlie gave him a bone crushing hug.
"Good. Lets get into the library and start setting up. Charlie, can you wrap things?" Sam asked, handing her the wrapping paper once she nodded. Sam and Dean left her in the garage with the presents to wrap. They went into the bunker and began to decorate. It wasn't much, but the pale streamers and the balloons made the room look much nicer. Charlie came in, almost sweating through her black 'The Angels Have the Phonebox' T-shirt.
“So, Dean, you said Cas is your best friend, how did you two meet?” Karamo asked, resting his chin on his hand. Dean glanced at Castiel, then back at the Five.
"Sorry, I let the rant get out of hand." He said, though he was satisfied with the damage he had done to his living room. "But at least John is in custody right now. Sam called me after it happened, and apparently John tried to attack Dean again, but Sam was able to get to the phone before anything else too bad could happen. I heard that something might have happened to Dean, and you know me and how I let rumors get to me. I heard that someone in his hometown saw him in the hospital, but I don't know for sure." Castiel said, his eyes shimmering with tears that he refused to shed on camera. Dean was a stronger man than he was to be able to cry in front of the camera and actually put the video up.
“Oh, definitely a closet case,” Tan confirmed. “I had a hunch and of course I was right. Takes one to know one. Luckily, I have experience in this department so I have total faith that I can push through one little soft spot in one of Dean’s barriers of machodom and hypermasculinity and reach out to him and pull him through. If he takes this step, I think it’ll be majorly beneficial to him in the long run, and not just because he may get to be with the love of his life.”
"Oh come on, really? That's easy for you and hard for me! How am I supposed to know how many siblings you have?!" Dean exclaimed, mumbling to himself at Castiel laugh.
"Yes, that's right. But that means we're tied. I either have to get both of these right, or you have to fail on the last one." Dean sighed, then he looked at his card. "Uh...okay, birthday...I'm going with...February 12th?"
"Because, Castiel." Cas flinched at the harsh tone Dean was using. "When I had sex with you, I never thought that you were going to get fat like this! Or that you were going to turn into such a whiny bitch! I would have thought twice before asking you to marry me." Dean said harshly. Castiel melted to the floor, unable to move. Dean took it as an advantage. "Honestly, baby." Dean hissed the word. "Did you ever think I was actually okay with having a baby? Let alone two. I should have left while I had a chance." Dean yelled. Castiel covered his ears and curled into a ball, not wanting to hear anything. He pried at the bond, begging him to open it. Then, Castiel got a glimpse of Dean's mind after prodding and pulling all he could while he stood in front of him, crying out insults and slander. Dean was not in this room, but instead he was angry at some woman who seemed so utterly familiar. And in that moment...Castiel knew what was going on.
They had been friends and neighbors since birth, but Cas had always wanted something more from the freckle-faced boy. (He just didn't know how to move down that road, with Dean being straight and all.)
Dean used the pet name for the other boy because he knew it would invoke a reaction. Dean leaned over and wiped the tears off of Cas' cheek and looked up into his watery blue eyes.
Certainty crescendoed through Dean's veins along with a clap of anxiety, perfectly in tune with the tap-dance of electricity outside.
"Yeah, I've noticed that about them," Jensen said, burying himself in the cupboards again, "they don't seem to care much about how you're doing."
Dean's paternal instincts lurched into motion; the mechanics turning into position like spools of film on an old movie projector, playing soundless memories from his time spent raising Sammy. The lights came back up and the film clicked to a stop when he felt the steady rise and fall of Castiel's breath.
"This is why I'm not allowed to live next to you anymore...." Cas explained with a blush. Dean looked at Cas with calculating eyes before breaking out into laughter.
A muffled clap of thunder rang through the bunker, the vibrations barely being heard through the cold concrete halls. The silenced waves of noise crashed into Dean's bedroom just as he clicked the play button on the next episode of Merlin. After being cooped up in the bunker for weeks, not being able to hunt due to lack of a case, Dean spent his time bingeing Netflix, exercising, and learning new recipes. Dean had learned that the best way to get through sleepless nights was to turn off your brain, switch on Netflix, and get lost in a land of myth and a time of magic.
"I tried to make breakfast for you...because you always get up early and make pancakes for me." Cas shuffled his feet as a light blush creeped across his face.
"You're right, they don't. But I do what I can. I feel as though I've been called to be their.... Well, their guardian angel." Cas paused, "And to answer your question, heaven is in utter chaos."
"I wish it was you driving that night instead of Sammy." Dean turned on his heel, and walked back into the house.
He pulled on a shirt and went to the kitchen of the house that he, Sam, and Cas had been squatting in. As he walked down the last step, he saw a black fluffy haired silhouette in bumblebee pajamas eating ice cream in the early morning light. Cas turned around at the sound of a creaking stair and he smiled at Dean, showing Dean that everything was alright.
"It- it's my dad." Cas stammered after a tense moment, "He's kicking me and Gabe out." Cas drew a shaky breath and waited for Dean to speak again.
Dean gave Cas a tight-lipped smile as he forced the food down his throat. Cas sighed in relief, and crossed the kitchen, sitting down on Dean's lap. He rested his head on his husband's shoulder, and Dean twisted his body to start placing scruffy, haven't-shaved-yet, kisses down Cas's jawline. Cas turned his body so he was straddling Dean, and Dean lead the line of kisses towards Castiel's lips. Cas kissed his husband roughly, and started running his hands through Dean's early morning bed head hair. Cas licked at Dean's bottom lip and was granting entrance. Cas could feel his husbands hands running through his hair and pulling him closer as shivers of pleasure ran down Castiel's spine. Castiel could hear Dean give a little moan and he smiled, liking the sound. Cas pulled away regretfully . "Why do humans need to breathe? Damn" Cas gasped for air and could feel Dean's hot breath panting on his neck.
Dean's first thought was that Cas had been bullied again. He was constantly attacked for his colorful tattoos and meek demeanor. Or, it could his father again...  Dean used to lay in bed and hear the screams Mr. Novak thought were smothered by the cement walls.
"Please be okay." Dean silently prayed as he went through the mental list of what could be wrong with his best friend.
"Blue Hawaii? Dean listens to Elvis?" Jensen shot a quizzical look at Castiel and started to put the groceries away.
Dean took the plate and roughly kissed Cas, and the fallen angel melted into the morning breath kiss.
"Well, we could just stay here, or drive somewhere. Whatever you guys want." Castiel suggested after cleaning off Jared's plate and the pans he used.
"Hey Mish-Cas, wanna help? Grab m-Dean's tapes out of Baby and put one into the radio." Jensen started humming as Castiel popped back into the kitchen with a tape in hand.
Dean walked toward Castiel and kissed him passionately, early morning stubble brushing against one another.
