Steve shrugged. "Don't know..." He mumbled. "I guess so." He looked away, avoiding the three boys' stares. "Feels weird mostly..."
He beamed when his last essay was dropped carelessly on his table and he saw the grade. He tried to keep his joy to himself as he glanced at Johan Schmidt's twisted mouth. No need for useless provocation, it was satisfying enough knowing. He still grinned silently at Sam and showed him the paper. Sam smiled back at him but there was something off about his expression and Steve suddenly felt the pain on his head slightly throbbing again.
Steve looked at him and felt a pang in his chest. Something bothered him but he didn't know what exactly, like this conversation was not finished yet.
He exclaimed, almost horrified. Tony smiled mockingly and snorted. Steve rolled his eyes. "You don't even
"Mr Fury." The Principal said, "I'm sorry to interrupt your class but I'd like to introduce a new student. His name is Anthony E. Stark. He's been unexpectedly transferred here and we're very glad to have him with us. Please, give him a warm welcome and make sure he feels happy in our school." Steve laughed internally, wondering if those words were addressed to them, or Fury. Both options being absolutely laughable.
"Like eighty percent of the American population." Clint snapped back. "You should feel blessed. Being omega makes you special, even more so as a male omega."
Tony wiped his face with his right hand, the cigarette still clutched in between his fingers. "I don't wanna fight you." He let out in a desperate sigh. "I won't fight you, Steve. I'll get you the best lawyers—"
Steve felt himself liquify on his seat, face burning with shame, a slight tremor in his hands. See? He told you! English class had become a living hell. All eyes were turned on him but Steve could only see one pair.
The second Steve set a foot on the school ground he bitterly regretted not using a scent-confuser. To be completely honest, he had almost gotten used to being the only male omega in the school. He could even say he had almost
Steve grimaces and sits back. He sighs, air blown through his nose, but keeps his eyes on Tony, staring menacingly. An unfailing determination in the eerie blue of his eyes. "I'm sorry, Tony." He says with an honest expression on his serious face. "I'm sorry I didn't realize it sooner. I'm sorry that I didn't
Tony laughed. Steve let escape a chuckle and blushed embarrassedly before nudging his friend's side. "I did
and eager to discover his living space. Steve had a vague idea about how his boyfriend acted in the privacy of his home but, to be honest, he had never seen him
After a long moment of silence, he finally spoke, a solemn air about him. He was clutching his cup of coffee as if his life depended on it. It had intrigued him, his order. Espresso. Triple shot. Steve didn't know many other students who liked their coffee black. He had felt a little childish when he put his latte macchiato extra milk extra cream on the table in front of him. That was the thing with Tony Stark, he felt small next to him. He felt small and helpless and his heart beat unusually fast. Too fast.
None of it was sexual though. They were two people who had gotten used to each other and had grown fond of each other. Two people who were seeking in each other what they needed. It was both sad and beautiful in a sense. Steve had been shocked the first time he had seen the Omega at Tony's feet, nuzzling against his legs, but it made complete sense afterwards. He had stared at the scene bewildered and felt something warm spreading in his chest at the sight. He understood the need and the comfort of it. He understood that both of them needed this. He needed it too, but had never wanted to give in to the urge.
Steve with an iron stake, a tiny ball of rage with the will to wipe out the villains off the surface of the earth. Tony must be hallucinating. He felt like laughing out loud. He could barely move though. He leant against the wall, he thought he did anyway. He didn't really remember why he was here or how it had happened. A man grabbed him by the hair and turned his face to him, drawing a lewd whimper out of him. The gesture surprised him and he started to laugh cluelessly.
"You kinda look like you need a drink, right now." He explained, then he added. "And I kinda need your help."
Tony kissed him again and grabbed his two wrists before leading Steve away from the desk and pushing him backward against the back wall. Steve's back bumped into the shelves and he felt paralyzed against Tony's ruthless determination. The glint in his eyes was feral and Steve was drawn to him, powerless.
He had never thought that this little detail would affect his boyfriend that much. His heart fluttered with happiness. Maybe it was a big deal after all...
"Oh my god yes," Clint agreed, "completely forgot how smitten Loki was. From that first night the three of us did ecstasy together and way after you ended your thing..."
Tony told his dreams and his ambition. The things he'd like to change and the thing he regretted. He told him about his ex, his first alpha, who outed him out of spite and caused him to transfer to their school. And he told him about his first boyfriend, an omega with whom he discovered his own body and explored sex. He told him about his only time with a beta girl. All the things he knew and all the things he had yet to discover.
Steve hurried his pace when he heard a rattling noise behind him and then a few voices. One of them he recognized. They had seen him go out on his own probably. If they caught him, he would fight back and he would lose and they would punch the shit out of him, they wouldn't pass on such an opportunity. And fuck, he wasn't in the mood to get beaten tonight.
Steve dropped his fork in a loud clang and stared at Natasha's belly, jaw-slacked, and at the soft and happy twinkle in her eyes, she looked weary he thought. Then he stared at Sam again, at his grayish temples, at the wrinkles at the corner of his eyes, at the discreet though very proud smile on his lips and wondered how that had happened. And When? And most of all, how was it that he had never heard of this before. Natasha was one of his closest friend, they shared everything. Almost everything. True they hadn't seen each other very often lately but... And Sam, Sam was—Sam was
Clint's eyes shone with a dark and mischievous glimmer. He loved that kind of stories. He nudged Bruce's shoulder. "So when did that change, Bruce?"
Tony made a funny face. "Because..." he said hesitantly, voice low and deep, "you don't have anyone to go with?"
Neither Clint nor him had the time to answer because at the exact same time, Tony's smile vanished and he stared at him with a pale face. "You and Loki had a thing?" He asked with a faltering voice. Steve felt something heave in his chest. There was something in Tony's eyes and he completely forgot how angry he was in an instant. "You never told me." Tony croaked out.
Tony knows he bonded with Steve, despite either of them, and he shouldn't feel this way. He knows he's been a terrible alpha and he deserves nothing of this, nothing from him or from Steve, by the way.
He was woken up only a couple of hours later, by the sound of his boyfriend showering in the bathroom. It was barely noticeable and so was the soft sliver of light coming out from the bathroom door but apparently Steve's sleep wasn't as deep as he had been pretending when his boyfriend wasn't next to him. He rubbed his eyes, blinking them open, and propped himself on one elbow while Tony walked out of the bathroom door, ethereal in a cloud of steam. He was in his pajamas and attempted to dry his unruly hair with the towel hanging from his shoulders. He tossed it on one of the armchairs and fetched a hoodie who'd been lying there.
"Ooh, I like that plan." Tony cooed. "But you have yet to propose, Rogers!" His eyes and his smile were a little insecure though and Steve panicked. Moving in together was one thing, marriage was... well. Not something they had ever considered. And he wasn't ready to discuss it now, or ever. Things were already perfect between them. He threw a piece of clothes at his boyfriend's face in response.
"Yeah but... " He pouted but couldn't keep the excitement off his voice. "It's Steve's first vernissage. You can't miss that!" Every time he said that, he felt butterflies tickling his stomach. He just needed to grin stupidly and beamed with pride.
The next guard was bolder and forwent greeting him and outright asked, “Are you really Stark’s kid?”
The Mark II was surpassing everything he had imagined, and the Mark III was going to be even better once he got the icing problem fixed. He lifted his face shield and was about to have his bots remove the suit when the house alarm went off.
It took Bruce only a few minutes to find one of his doctors. Being faced with a man who could hulk out at the slightest provocation usually got people moving to do Bruce’s bidding even when he was asking them nicely in a quiet whisper.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” Marston said with a wily grin. “I give you, Captain Steven Rogers and the industrious Tony Stark!”
Tony was just talking to him. He was going to come home. They were going to talk. They were going to make up. Everything was going to be alright.
When he opened his eyes again, he realized he’d fallen on the ground. The suit had gone dark again, but he could tell by the flickering screens that it’d be connected in a few seconds. He was too weak to sit up nor open his mouth to talk to Jarvis so he waited...
“She’s fine. She with five agents and they’re about to arrest Obadiah,” Rhodey assured him, helping him sit up against the counter.
Steve's determination deflated like a balloon instantly and he slouched again, letting out another desperate sigh. He couldn't help laughing stupidly. "Why am I not even surprised?"
Except that, against all odd, Tony didn't rebuke him. He melted into the touch and turned amused eyes to him, smile a little relieved. Steve felt him relax in his embrace and he brought a strong arm around his frail shoulders to keep him close to him.
"And it's not like I bother." Tony adds with a reassuring smile. The choice of venue is peculiar but it suits Steve. It suits both of them. "Why a jazz club though?" He asks nonchalantly, trying to make conversation more than out of real curiosity.
Tony can be very aggressive in the way he approaches Steve sometimes but when they're in bed together, he lets his mask fall. He's incredibly soft and gentle, and considerate. Steve might have fantasized a lot about being pushed down and fucked but when it comes down to it, he is so glad his first time is happening with an omega. Someone who
Johann vanished through the door and purposely jostled Tony's shoulder as he staggered away. "Mind your own business, Stark." He shouted when he was far enough. Tony's eyes followed him unconcernedly and turned back to Steve, questioning.
Steve had absolutely no excuse. Admittedly, Tony hadn't said anything but if he had paid attention, even just a little bit, he would have noticed. He would have noticed Tony wasn't alpha and he would have noticed he had been trying, so subtly, to ask him out for months now. He felt like shit and he was still in rut and Tony's now so distinctive scent wasn't helping at all. He felt so lost and confused.
There were white flakes dancing around him in the streetlight, tickling the tip of his flushed nose. His gaze glittered with happiness. He turned his face to Steve. Their eyes met and locked into each other. They shared a silent smile before Tony held him his hand and looked upward again. His smile was soft now, and innocent.
Steve felt something unclench in his chest. He averted his eyes and tilted his head on the side, hiding a relieved smile. He knew he was but he always asked anyway and tonight even more, he felt like he needed to ask. Maybe that was because had Tony felt oddly distant the entire evening. "Well, you could be doing some special secret stuff," he teased. "Let's say, a flying suit armor for example, who knows?"
Steve stared at him silently for a few moments. In hindsight, he should have noticed way before. If he hadn't been so self-centered... Tony finally turned around and met Steve's eyes. He had taken his soaked hoodie off and showed of his muscled arms through a loose old AC/DC shirt. The smell of him emanating from his body and invading the room, dizzying. He smiled at Steve, gently, and held him a hand, as if he couldn't be separated from Steve for too long.
Steve wondered if Tony wanted kids after all but forgot about it instantly. That was certainly not a discussion for now. Steve had never thought about having kids. Somehow, he had erased that idea from his brain, from his possibilities. He didn't want kids now. How would kids fit in his life? Tony barely did.
The words stung like daggers. Tony wanted to cry again. He thought of Obie, pissing in his mouth, offering it as a parting gift, and his own cock, rock hard at the humiliation. He wanted to scratch his skin off again, cut the inside of his arms and bleed. And what if he
The disconcerted look on Tony's face was almost funny to see. He was probably even more shocked than Steve was by this unexpected discovery. "
"Stand still." He orders, although he doesn't have to because he knows the omega will do everything he wants him to in this state. He is such a good omega. Tony slowly takes his soaked sweat shorts down, making them slide over his well-rounded ass, and pulls his shirt over his head, taking in the sight of him with delight. Such a beautiful man, he thinks. The omega is gorgeous. Every inch of him is. Even his scars are.
Steve smiled victoriously and let Bucky take control. He was new to this, after all—and still hadn't presented. Bucky took his face in his big hands and pressed his lips delicately on Steve's. He gave him a soft kiss and made it last a little longer than Steve had expected. It was warm and soft and a little wet and Steve thought he could get used to this. He let escape a moan and that was when Bucky ended the kiss. He stared into his eyes confusedly, looking slightly flushed and debauched.
Tony had nothing to answer for himself. Except that he didn't give a shit about million dollars contracts. That he didn't live for money. That his boyfriend, Steve, lived in a dump, ate plain pasta everyday, had been struggling with two fucking jobs to meet ends before and that he was happier Howard had ever been in his life. Tony wouldn't mind giving it all up to live that life with Steve. He couldn't say that to Howard though. Howard would never understand.
Another couple of hours later, it was already way past eleven, Tony was still hiding and Steve had taken upon reading Tony's collection of originals from Marvel and DC comics—the very first issues—comfortably curled up on the huge couch. Steve had been denied entrance to the workshop several times already and when he felt his eyes fluttering shut on the book, he realized he had no idea where he would be allowed to sleep tonight—he wouldn't just take the liberty to just go and sleep in Tony's bedroom. Not in those circumstances. And even if Tony would have never minded were he in his shoes. And even if Tony probably would not care. He tried one last time.
"But this is not me. I don't feel home and I'll never do. I'm not comfortable with it. I'll get used to it, of course I will, but it will always be
He rolled the toy inside Tony, then took it off, added some more lube and shoved it in again. The toy was sliding out of his ass every time Tony clenched on it and Steve pushed it in again, going deeper and deeper each time, inch by inch. Tony let out a long keening whine and remained a shivering mess on the bed, cock rock-hard and forming a wet stain of precum on Steve's sheets.
"It just never came up." Steve shrugged. "Everything went quickly. I contacted the agency and by the time I wanted to talk to you about it they had already found a buyer."
Tony ignored him and crossed the room so fast Steve was caught off guard. He didn't even react when Tony caught his head with his two callused hands and pulled him in for a kiss. He only realized what was happening the moment he felt his breath on his mouth and the soft touch of his coffee-tasting lips.
He slipped from Steve’s side and went out to the balcony. He followed the assembly path and his suit was constructed around him.
Steve’s new apartment was huge, including a master suite for himself and a smaller bedroom (originally a guest room) for Peter. There was an office with a small library, a kitchen, a dining room, a workout room with weights and a treadmill, and a living room which was where the elevator was to connect him to the rest of the building. All of this came with high-end furniture and a nearly 360 degree, stellar view of the Manhattan skyline.
Steve rolled his eyes but didn’t say anything more and plopped the other half of his chicken into his mouth. He groaned sinfully from the taste and the hair on the back of Tony’s neck stood up.
“To join the Black Widow Program, I must kill my soulmate,” she replied shortly and pressed the gun deeper into her soulmate’s chest. She ironically added, “Hence the ‘widow’ name of the program.”
The dreamscape materialized and the horizon was dark. Instead of Tony standing before him, it was the mansion that Steve recognized as Tony’s home. He’d seen it many times, but it was usually well lit and filled with the smell of fresh baked cookies made by Tony’s butler, Jarvis.
Peter’s voice was just a quiet whisper but Wade jolted as if he was electrocuted again. For a second, he assumed it was Peter’s ghost whispering to him and Death had succeeded in taking him. His entire soul broke at the thought. He could feel his insides crumbling and tears blurred his eyes.
Howard snapped the welder back sharply when he was done. He breathed shallowly as carefully picked up the chip. It hadn’t shattered but would it still work?
Everything was much more amazing then he’d ever imagine it. His fantasy paled in comparison to the real man, moaning sinfully above him.
“Wait, Tony,” Steve said, grabbing his arm. “If we go running after him, it'll only draw more attention to him. Let's call him over his communicator. He probably has it on him.”
Alright, Tony loved the guys at TMZ and their hilariously ridiculous questions (his answer was Starship Captain) but the rest of them could go fuck themselves in his opinion.
Tony went to the pool’s edge then eased himself on the stairs. He went down a few steps and sat down on one that was deep enough so his waist would be submerged. The water was heated but his cock was running hotter and the water felt colder there than on the rest of him.
“Then let’s see how scrambled we can make that brain of yours,” Peter breathlessly teased, wounding his arms around Wade’s head and dragging him down again. When Wade’s mouth met Peter’s, Peter groaned into his mouth as filthily as possible. Wade all but collapsed onto him and returned the kiss with a mad fervor.
Tony had been staring off into space, trying and failing at figuring out ways to help Steve. He had already exhausted all his leads years prior when trying to figure out how he and Steve were dreaming together in the first place. No one could figure out how a dead man could keep dreaming with him. It was unheard of. So he did not know who to approach about this…maybe he could inquire with someone on…on what happens in dreams as another soulmate dies.
“Sir, it may be wise to notify Captain Rogers of your yearly drinking holiday,” Jarvis suggested as Tony threw back another shot. The scotch burned his throat as it made its way down to his stomach and Tony ignored his AI in favor of feeling that burn.
His helmet was completely gone and blood was trailing from both corners of his mouth. Steve worriedly cupped his face and then his gaze trailed downward to the damaged suit hiding his husband’s damaged body.
“Of course,” Steve replied with a chuckle. The robot was nothing like the cold, humorless machines he had read about in fiction. Steve was enjoying it and having fun imagining the environment it may have come from. “And your presence and earlier colorful commentary make me guess you didn’t find Schmidt?”
. He had a broader chest than Peter and larger muscles. Peter had felt his build whenever they embraced but now it was out on display…Peter was tempted to move his hands and explore the more intimate corners. Wade’s hands rested heavily on his waist and he looked at Peter with warm, sleepy eyes. However, when their gazes collide, something shifted in Wade’s eyes and he grinned ferally at Peter. Wade’s hands tightened on his hip and he wrapped his arms around Peter, pressing their bodies closer as they began to turn together.
Holograms opened up above the kitchen counter. Steve had only seen videos of them from his time with Cable. He reached out and ran a hand through one with fascination. He felt nothing and the images barely wavered.
Bucky was a morning person but when sitting with the entire team, especially with Natasha in the room, he was silent. Today, however, he was nowhere to be seen.
Steve’s hands tightened on both of Bucky’s arms. One arm was normal, the flesh strong but soft under his clutch but the other arm…
“Don’t think about it,” Steve whispered against his lips. He kissed the corner of his mouth, then the corner of his jaw, and then he started to make his way down his neck. His hands trailed over Tony's body, making him arch and moan in appreciation. Steve murmured, “Think only about this right now – about me. Let me make you so tired, you fall asleep, thinking only of us.”
Tony picked up the sealed files and asked, “What is this? Do you expect me to do paperwork? Did you guys look at me at all? I’m dying. I’m not going to spend my last days signing the dotted line.”
Jarvis nodded curtly and hurried out the other end of the kitchen Howard had just entered through. Howard’s eyes trailed to where the man had been standing when he first entered. Why steal from the kitchen? All the good silver was on display in the dinning room and there were vastly more expensive objects in the other rooms! The only thing of value where the man had been standing was the oven, but it’d take four men to move that…
Peter sighed and wrapped his arms and legs around his uncle so it would be easier for him to hold Peter. Uncle Bucky’s mind was fragile and Peter felt guilty for stressing him so much. Peter whispered, “I’m sorry…”
It reminded him of when he first kissed Tony under the stars in the shadow of the base. Steve’s heart at the time had swelled with emotion and every touch was magical. He had wished that moment had never ended because for the first time in his life he was kissing a man more for their hearts than anything else…
“He’s a very smart and noble four-year-old,” Tony countered, leaning closer to Peter. Peter grinned under Tony’s praise.
Tony cringed and clenched his jaw to smother a scream of pain. He didn't want to give him the satisfaction. The ache was agonizing and Tony almost shed a tear, unexpectedly. He didn't remember when it had ever hurt that much, not even the first time had been that painful. Obie did not care one bit however, he kept thrusting, forcing Tony open, pounding into him until he was buried to the hilt. His cock felt like a burning stake, tearing his insides apart. Each one of his thrust spread the burning ache in his entire body. He ground his teeth and bit his tongue not to wail with the pain. Tony usually liked it when it hurt, he thought, but this was too much. On the upside, he didn't think about Steve anymore.
I don't know, interesting. So I started wondering about him, like... what kind of life he had, if he was a student... What would he be studying then? He had such beautiful hands, I noticed, and such a thin figure but such a bold and serious expression. I wondered what kind of hobby he had and if he was gay or just bi-curious, if he had a boyfriend, the kind of things he liked... You know, he was earnest and so
Steve facepalmed and shook his head. He felt a blush creeping on his face and was probably crimson red to the tip of his ears. He could even start to imagine what he was going to face the next day at work. He felt shivers running down his spine just thinking about it.
at him. He looks at the pain in his eyes, at the strained smile he's trying to keep gentle, at the way his hand clenches around his beer. Loki stares back at him with a soft and fond expression. "I could help you though." Tony blurts, because he can't help himself. "I mean, about the job thing, obviously. Can't help you with the other thing but I can... I can give you some money or... or help you find a place to stay. I—I could give you a job if you needed... probably. There's probably something that needs your qualifications... or your skills, whatever. I'm pretty sure I could find you something." He keeps rambling because he feels awkward and like a rich asshole and tends to do that when he's uncomfortable. "I mean, obviously, there is at least
Alright, never mind, Peter wanted him and that simple fact couldn’t make Wade more elated or happier. And Wade loved him. He knew it the moment Peter first kissed him. He knew Peter was nowhere near the “I love you” stage yet but Wade just knew he was irrevocably in love with the younger man. The fact that the person who Wade loved wanted to also be with him was earthshattering…and now one of his fathers was okay with it too?
He was relieved Peter was gone but…at the same time, he wanted to badly wanted to hold his child, after all this pain and suffering, he had been gone for weeks without his boy and he missed him desperately. Was it too much to ask for a single minute of peace?
Wade stared at his boyfriend’s sleeping form, panting lightly as his accelerated heartbeat began to dwindle. His mind was still racing to catch up from the horrors of his nightmare and it took him a moment to disassociate the present from the impossible reality of his dark dreams. Peter leaving and not coming back was just a part of the dream…as was the monster that had stood by the bed.
Peter easily stopped him using the moves Aunt Tasha taught him. He wished she could see him, using it, and saving someone. For a brief second, he felt immensely proud of himself.
A beat of silence finally passed between them as they both processed what the mad time traveler had said.
Steve took a step toward the Winter Solider and hissed, “That is Bucky! I know my best friend!” To the Solider, Steve said, “Bucky? It’s me, do you remember me?”
He went to the laundry mat and saw Bucky’s retreating around the corner of the block. Steve surged ahead, his muscles burned as he pushed himself beyond the usual limit. He quickly closed the distance. He rounded the same corner and saw Bucky run down an alley.
Bucky was probably overreacting. He adjusted his grip on the steering wheel and replied to Steve, “Yeah…Yeah, it’s probably because he’s sick…”
He just sat there…on one of his benches…and stared at the cabinet that held additional lubrication, oil, and coolant for his robots.
“I need to go to him!” Steve gasped, thinking of how scared Peter must be alone in the dark bedroom. He could never leave Peter alone for long before his old nightmarish memories of the lab he was housed in came creeping back and scaring him more.
He was half expecting to see Bucky but it was an older man in a combat military uniform. He had a white crew cut and a thick white mustache. He pointed an AK-47 at Steve, smoke was rising from the barrel. Staring down the barrel, the rounds from the machine gun burned all the more painfully in Steve’s shoulder and arm. The older man’s eyes were mad with rage and his teeth were clenched in a snarl.
Peter groaned and dropped his head into his hands. If his sudden stardom hadn’t ostracized him enough from the other interns these classes surely will. He moaned, “Anything else to tell me? Has someone broken into my aunt’s place for my baby pictures yet?”
“It might only activate when he’s scared like the Hulk comes out when I am angry,” Bruce speculated, still staring at Peter. Peter was oblivious to the fact that he was the topic of conversation. He sat on Steve’s lap busily eating his third banana and watching a cartoon on Bruce’s tablet.
Peter grabbed his phone and added Wade’s number. After a moment’s hesitation, he sent Wade a spider web and a winky face emoji.
“Agent Ridges can show you,” Coulson said, nodding to one of the scientists. Bruce hurriedly went over to the man’s side and they were instantly drawn into a discussion about the super solider serum. Because of his interest, Bruce wasn’t timid or overly cautious with the stranger like he usually was and it made Tony’s chest tighten with happiness and pride. Bruce was usually so afraid of himself that he rarely opened up to others so easily.
He heard the van doors slam close and turned to see all three former assassins approaching. Bucky stood in the middle, his gaze downcast as they walked.
The round object that had slid out of the bag was mostly covered with a strange orange tarp but a part of the tarp parted in the fall and a piece was revealed, portraying the familiar red, white, and blue coloring he had been looking at for the last few weeks.
“…Mary,” Tony stated, drawing both Steve’s and Mary’s eyes to him. He continued, “Mary, I like to think we were once close acquaintances, maybe even friends. You know me. We worked together in building the Cancer Genome Project.” Mary’s lips thinned and Tony eyes flickered as he noted the movement. He continued, his voice strong, “You know I would have no part in what happened in that Hydra lab and know that I would
Tony rubbed his cock against Steve’s, never relinquishing his tight hold on them. Steve grabbed the rim of the tub, afraid his grip might be too strong on Tony’s soft flesh at that moment. He’d almost forgotten what it felt like to have another touch him so intimately, nonetheless Tony’s touch.
Peter pulled back from the embrace, teary-eyed but smiling. His lips trembled as clearly held back tears.
“I will write a sonnet about your ass that will rival Shakespeare!” Wade declared and Peter couldn’t keep it in any longer and fell forward under the force of his laughter.
The preliminary hearing was just around the corner and Steve’s future was at stake. Both of them should have been freaking out about it but…all they wanted was each other. They had denied themselves already for so long…and, in the end, Tony knew with absolute certainty that whatever the verdict he was not going to let Tyler, a trial, the law, or anything else keep him from his man.
Steve shoved Peter behind him. After needing his shield when Loki took Peter, he had asked Tony to make him a wristband to call the shield to him, it was similar the ones Tony had that called his suit to him. He pressed the button and it bleeped in confirmation. He prayed it would be there soon.
Tony swooped in like a guardian angel and pulled Peter and Harry back into his birthday party. Peter looked back to Bucky with concern until he saw Steve step up next to Bucky and he smiled reassuringly at his son. As Peter turned away, Steve cornered Bucky before he could escape.
Coulson look up from his shield with a sad expression and stated, “I would never ask you to fight your own son. And I would never have asked for your shield because of it. Keep your shield, Captain. You will need it again in the future.”
“Lie down,” Steve commanded. Tony twisted his body and finally looked down at him, his eyes clouded with worry. Steve pushed himself up and cupped Tony’s face. He pulled him down and kissed him, coaxing him back to his arms and to bed.
Peter wanted to test it out in the city but swinging in the skies as Spidey. Could it look like his suit too? It’d been days since he last went out as Spider-Man. He used to go out every night…he missed it and felt guilty for not going. Many people probably had needed him…
Lana and Tony only dated for a month, but Tony was quick to jump into another relationship and what followed was a series of quick romances over the span of the next few years. Steve eventually became desensitized to the ache in his heart and took on the role of friend or consoler as Tony talked to him about his various relationships.
“Master Banner is in the communal room,” Jarvis stated. “He can distract you until Master Rogers returns.”
“Peter—!” Steve began but Tony put a hand on his arm. This was the last thing Tony wanted, to see all of that hate and anger directed at him through his son's eyes. Tony felt like his very soul was crumbling. His son was right there, in front of them, but he was miles away. Peter didn't want him there. It was so obvious and devastating and Tony couldn't stay there anymore to see that ire grow. Even Steve wouldn't be able to save Tony if he stayed there any longer with Peter looking at him like that...
Peter spun around but the symbiote was not there. He glanced down at his hands and whispered, “Are we still one?”
He carefully put the photo back into his pocket and then opened the laptop. As soon as he clicked on the search bar, it suggested Tony’s name. Steve smiled bitterly at the screen and then selected it. He found a new video of Tony dated five years prior he’d yet to watch and put in his headphones before hitting play. He leaned onto his arm as Tony began to talk about a new missile his company had produced.
One was a video from his high school graduation, someone who had bought the graduation on DVD probably recorded his part and posted it. Peter bitterly bit his lip and did not click it. The video icon was of him and Gwen embracing. The faded memory of kissing Gwen on the stage made a pulse of grief thrum through him.
“Your pops and I are actually going to meet her again tomorrow,” Uncle Tony replied. “But we thought it best to hold off on bringing you just yet…”
Wade’s words dwindled to a stop and his jaw dropped. Tony turned back to the screens and nausea churned his stomach as the symbiote had completely covered his son and the humanoid form was sitting itself up. A more sinister version of Peter’s Spider-Man costume seeped in white as an angled spider symbol hugged Peter’s chest and the almond shaped eyes opened.
She frowned and her eyes continued to burn with anger. Steve winced. Whatever hidden feeling Natasha eluded to would not save Tony or Bucky right now.
“Ouch,” Peter murmured, handing over his credit card. Harold inserted it into the chip reader with a chuckle. His eyes glazed over the card but then he did a quick double check and Peter winced. With half the card sticking out, his first name was indistinguishable but ‘Parker’ was easy to see. Harold glanced from him to the card, back to the card, and then back to Peter again.
“Steve, I –,” Tony began but was cut off by another explosion and Tony grunting in pain. Steve eyes were glued to the television screen before him, looking for any signs of his boyfriend in the crumbling house.
“You zeroed out?” The jerk asked, grasping the spot on his arm where his soul implant must have been under the sleeves of his long shirt.
In due course, she stated, “I am here because you helped me when you did not have to and your son tried to save me even though he did not know me. I was showed compassion and now I wish to return the favor.”
Peter sighed lightly to himself and whispered to his friend alone, “I know you were put through the ringer yesterday and I’m sorry you had to go through that…you are awesome. You’re a great friend, Eddie, can…can we still be friends?”
Clint withdrew a slender package from the inside pocket of his jacket and exclaimed, “Okay Peter! Where do you want it??”
“Amazing…” Tony gasped, “I didn’t see this in the notes about you…then again, I was looking for your location and not the metal arms attached to you…Is this Hydra’s version of my armor? How
“Tell Pepper, I brought Bucky home and tell Fury I did some early Christmas shopping,” Tony retorted, stepping out of his suit.
The building belonged to SHIELD. Natasha surveyed the surrounding area through her binoculars. The structure had a team patrolling the perimeter and it looked like it was at a high security level. It was well guarded.
Steve inhaled slowly, calming his nerves and forcing his feelings aside. He raised his hand and have the signal to move forward.
The last thing Steve saw was the Winter Soldier standing at the forefront of the group. Most of his fire was directed at the Iron Man suit and the man's eyes narrowed with displeasure as his bullets bounced off the armored suit.
“Hey, Tony!” Steve called out over the communicator. “You hungry? I just unburied a Thai restaurant and the owner is offering to cook food for all the responders.”
Peter withdrew his hand from underneath Bruce’s. He tucked his hand close to his face and buried his into Tony’s side. Bruce sighed heavily and ran his hand through his hair. He regarded Peter for a moment then stood. He lightly caressed Peter’s soft hair and whispered, “Don’t give up on hope…I love you, Peter.”
“I understand why you did it,” Tony whispered, hating seeing such pain in Steve’s eyes. Hell, he was willing to change the future to save Steve but ended up damning him to Hydra instead. But still… “It still hurts. I wish you spoke to me –
“I’m more than ready,” Peter retorted. He buried his face in his Pops’ chest and whispered, “I just want my mom,
Tony wrapped his arms around the back of Steve’s head and pressed him deeper into his chest. He pressed his face into Steve’s scalp and brokenly whispered into his hair, “I love you.”
Steve scrapped the last of the apple sauce out and fed the final scoop to Peter. He tossed the spoon in the sink then threw the empty container into the trash.
May sighed heavily and then put her hand over Wade’s. She murmured, “I don’t know what that man is so upset about. Every time, Peter looks at you he lights up. You clearly are a good influence on him.”
Steve felt his face slacken with surprise. It took longer than it should have for Tony’s words to process in his head. Tony looked back up to Steve and Tony growled, “
After giving his father a terse explanation on how it worked, Tony held out the reactor to his father and Howard hovered before it with wide eyes. His face was centimeters from it, but he made no move to touch it. It felt so wrong showing this to his father. He wanted to snatch it back before the man could steal its design. This was Tony’s invention but, by the way Howard was studying it, he darkly wondered if this would change in the future too…
Steve gave quick goodbyes to his newfound Russian friends. He’d only been with them a little over a week but they had helped more than they would ever realize and he was eternally grateful. They surprised him with hugs and kisses to the cheek. He had to conclave his torso in order for them to not feel his shield and no one seemed to have noticed thankfully.
Steve groaned, the sound shuddered deep within his throat and he pumped faster, imagining Tony frantically kissing him and desperately wanting to stroke Steve’s sex and make Steve come for him. Tony's hand would've been smaller but Steve had no problem imaging his hands as Tony’s. He pictured Tony’s face growing flush and he wondered what noises he would be making as he touched Steve and Steve touched him in return.
“I’m trying to cause a stir at SHIELD about this, but no one is taking the pregnant ex-agent too seriously. Most are saying it’s an extremist that didn’t agree with your company’s weapons deals. They don’t see the connections between you and the others!”
for me to deny you,” Tony grumbled through his grin. He ran his hands quickly over the remaining suds all over his body to get rid of them. Tony continued, “I am supposed to be the irresponsible one with orders from authority, not you.”
Upon his exclamation, Bucky sharply got to his feet and looked to where they stood in the kitchen with calculating eyes. When he saw no danger, he slowly lowered himself back down to the couch and even more slowly turned back to the TV.
“Call me, Tony, and I got here as soon as Steve messaged me,” Tony replied. Without missing another beat, Tony stated, “We want to foster him.”
Wade chuckled nervously and scratched the back of his head. He murmured, “I think I’ll hold onto that one until it becomes canon too.”
“No, Cap. You’ve been asleep for a very long time and won’t be going back to sleep like that again anytime soon unless you feel like taking another arctic nap. You’ve been frozen for over 70 years.”
They teamed up against Hawkeye, totally creaming him. Clint demanded individual rematches. He beat Peter but, when he went up against Wade, it went from pool game to pool fight. Pool balls went flying and pool sticks turned into katanas.
Bucky silently slipped past Tony and sat on the ground at Steve’s feet, shutting Tony up. Bucky lightly grasped Steve’s leg and leaned into him with a content sigh. Bucky’s shoulders relaxed and his entire body slumped forward.
An officer bound forward and pushed past Steve, screaming for Solo to let go of the girl. More security came running over from the nearby festival.
Half the team looked Peter over and all of them assured him with varying degrees of science and magic that the symbiote was totally gone!
Thank you all who have read this fic, from the person who just discovered it today to the ones who have been here since the beginning!
This closeness and those words eventually did him in and he came harder than he ever had before. He collapsed onto Steve's chest and, after a few quick strokes, Steve came too.  Embraced together in their filth, they were breathing heavily, but smiling widely. They exchanged a gasping kiss and then snuggled together with happy sighs.
“Where’s Tony?” Steve demanded, frantically looking around the ruined interior, caused by Tony and Obadiah fighting most likely.
It took Peter a few seconds to process the symbiote’s words and, as he realized his friend’s betrayal, the treachery gripped his heart in a tight vice. Peter renewed his struggles but it was with a constant pain in his chest.
“T-Tony?” Steve asked, trying to sit up more from his obtuse position. His wounds pulled and he fell back into the bed with a groan.
Nonetheless the shadow started crawling up Peter’s neck. Peter strained his neck trying to keep his head away from it.
He threw his undershirt aside and wrapped his arms around her to encourage the kissing. She paused in her kissing to trace the scarred tissue where his body turned metal.
Peter didn’t see if he got back up as Venom had him hurdling out the glass door right before the security shutters sealed him in.
With his semen, however, they had impregnated five women and infused the fetuses with gamma-radiated DNA. Peter was the only survivor and had been infused with spider, gamma-radiated DNA. With SHIELD’s shut down, its rebuilding, and Hydra being flushed out, Peter was discovered. Agent Hill had notified Steve as soon as she was positive Peter was really his son.
The dreamscape moved upon Tony’s request and the ground beneath Steve shifted, pulling him away from Tony.
“You said you thought it best to call you Sneaky though,” Steve reiterated. He asked curiously, “Do you have another name?”
The footage seemed to come from a security camera and in the corner of the screen he saw movement down the alley across the street. He recognized it as a mugging but out of nowhere a new figure joined the fray and moved with a fighting style he had only seen in Natasha and –.
“We’re not making love in the locker room,” Steve groaned as he got to his feet. He held a hand out to Tony and helped him to his feet and then pulled him back into his arms.
He was just liking this jerk…but now the other boy was going to treat him differently. Touching the soul implant in his arm, Steve replied truthfully, “They went after me cause I told them I didn’t do no crying because I’m not gonna meet my soulmate…and they decided they were gonna make me cry.”
He sat up straighter and gave Steve a half hug and flashed him a cocky smile, but no matter how cockily he smiled, he couldn’t hide the way he continued to tremble.
“Big ba-da boom big,” Tony stated with a smirk and the men traded knowing glances, their words going over Steve’s head and he innately knew hey were referencing some obscure movie he'd never seen.
Peter slipped his hand into Wade’s, pulling Wade with him in Steve’s direction, and Peter asked, “What can we help you with?”
“You need to eat lunch,” Steve said, wondering if he had enough food in the last few days. “What do you want?”
“Sam!” A nurse ran up to Sam holding a baby that couldn’t be no more than 6 months old. She quickly gasped, “They just unburied about half a dozen criticals from a collapsed building at Fort Hamilton. I cannot find a social worker anywhere! Can you help? His parents are dead but he’s relatively unhurt.” Before Sam could reply she handed him the boy’s chart and then held out the baby to him.
Tony took a moment to reply. He was looking at Steve but he seemed to be elsewhere. He finally whispered, “Sounds lonely…”
“…And we would kinda like a blood sample,” Tony murmured. “To, you know, see that it really is you…”
Latching onto the image of Tony, Steve lifted his head and defiantly retorted, “I can do this all day.”
As he got closer to where he guessed the car was, the reporters became more frantic. They began to pull at his arms and tug on his clothing. Steve gritted his teeth as he fought the urge to slug the people grabbing at him.
“What the hell,” Steve gasped. Tony’s Tower was a fortress and Jarvis was supposed to be indestructible.
Tony shamelessly muttered, “You know, if you were cold, I have several creative ways on how to warm a person up.”
“My skin must be irritated or something,” Tony murmured thoughtfully. His brow pinched with concern and Steve sat up straighter, his spine tingling unpleasantly at the look in Tony’s eyes. But then Tony laughed unexpectedly and murmured, “I usually slather my body with ridiculously expensive soaps and creams so I guess this is my skin’s way of complaining. I used to put this honey-milk, Japanese seaweed extract thing around it. My doctor recommended it and looks like she recommended it for a reason! Plus, I never smothered my reactor quite like I'm doing now…I’ll see if I can grab some skincare creams from medical and keep an eye on it.”
“Hey,” Tony laughed. “I’m not done yet! Plus, you’re going to need some after-shave or you’re going to have an unhappy face rash tomorrow morning.”
Peter glanced hopefully to Uncle Thor but the Norse God was also frowning. Uncle Thor grumbled, “You are not blessed with flight. You could have lost your life before it had even begun.”
Tony got back to his feet with a grin and he and Steve shared a kiss again, each pouring every ounce of love they could into it.
Tony grasped his hand and carded all of their fingers together except for their pointer fingers. Their pointer fingers pressed into one another and Tony guided Steve to the star, whispering directions and star names as they went.
“What are you doing here?” Peter asked. He self-consciously dropped his gaze, knowing he had to look a mess. His eyes felt red and raw and his face splotchy.
Tony leaned heavily onto his chest with his chin jutted sharply right in the middle of it. He was pouting and it made Steve smile. Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair and asked, “Dating you is going to be insane, isn’t it?”
“Yes, he is alive. Look at the photo. It should have stopped fading because the future isn’t set here. Our presence should already be altering the future the Goblin created,” Cable replied. Steve pulled out the photo and saw Cable was right. The fading had stopped. Half of Tony’s body was gone but his upper half was still there and it was no longer fading.
Jarvis stated, “I must persist in an immediate end to what is going on between you two. The future is at risk with every passing second.”
Steve complied with his wordless request and bent his head to met Tony’s desperate kiss. Tony’s mouth devoured him, wild and needy, and his free hand  at his scalp while the other continued knead their cocks together.
The other was only a little taller than Peter, which was not saying much, and had a normal physique compared to his overly muscular companion, and had dark brown hair. As soon as Peter opened the door, he began to twitch and Twitchy became his nickname.
Steve smiled at him and reached over to brush the dark hair off his forehead. Steve murmured, “Our relationships are
Both Peter and Wade froze and Peter’s heart began to beat wildly again. Wade slowly turned around and Peter looked past him to see the new figure enter the room.
will be the one devouring you, Steve,” Tony moaned. Steve blushed, biting back another groan as Tony’s tongue found its way into his mouth.
Steve’s brows shot together in a tight pinch and he bit down on his tongue, already wanting to speak out.
and Steve had people coming up to him for approvals or questions. He was currently one of the highest ranking officers, Peggy was actually the highest ranking but everyone knew they worked together so Steve was the perfect (less intimidating) proxy. He was probably going to be busy until the rest of the 107
“The kid’s got a right to be a little showy,” Tony replied. “His father’s Captain America and the rest of his family are a part of the Avengers!”
Natasha’s head snapped up and, when she saw Bucky was awake, yelled, “James! Steve! Get out here or your boys will eat everything!”
He read the italicized city name several times before, with a gaping mouth, he gasped, “We’re in Malibu.”
“Papa?” Peter gasped, his tears came to an immediate halt as soon as Steve absorbed the hurt meant for him.
Gilded gates were sealed between him and the property but there was an intercom there. He pressed the button and cautiously said, “Hello?”
Steve cupped his cheek and his eyes grew shiny as stared into Tony’s eyes. He promised, “I will always be there for you. Here or the dream world, love…”
Bucky tried to lighten the mood and murmured, “Maybe one day our implants will reset and our soulmates will show up the next day, hm?”
Despite the tremendous pain he was in Steve pushed himself up to the elbows and looked up the 200 feet he fell. Tony was no longer on the storage container and there was no sign of him, Pepper, or Kilian.
“Yes, Master Rogers,” Jarvis replied and the reality show disappeared and in its place was blue sky and clouds streaking by as Tony flew to south.
In the time they held each other, Natasha finished applying first aide to his feet and left them to have some private time together. For the longest time, they said nothing to each other as their embrace said enough.
“Oh…” He whispered and the great, happy feeling he’d been feeling the last few days, suddenly receded from him like a fast moving tide. Steve grasped Tony’s hand, not out love but out of apprehension.
“Then what’s your mission right now, solider?” Steve asked changing tactics and straightening out of his crouch into a commanding position.
He grasped Tony’s uninjured hand with his right hand while he moved his left hand into position. Making sure it was hidden from everyone so they could not stop him.
There was a crunch of sand and the sudden casting of a shadow over his body. Steve tensed. The figure stood in front of the sun, totally eclipsing his features from Steve. For all he knew, this man was another enemy looking to kill him or Peter.
Steve smiled sweetly at his fiancé and whispered, “He also fell into my life like you did… it seems like fate.”
Steve simply pressed a gentle kiss to Tony’s lips before he could argue away Steve’s apology. Kissing Tony again felt like coming home. His heart soared as he remembered how much he loved this man. Tony returned the kiss and any anxiety Steve felt about his impending death melted away.
“Ahh-gah,” Peter garbled with a sharp gasp hunching into Wade. The sound went straight to Wade’s groin. How many more noises could he draw out of Peter?
Their reactions were totally not what he had expected. Steve Roger’s jaw dropped. Tony Stark staggered backwards until he fell back heavily onto the recliner behind him.
“Do not enter it until we know it’s safe,” Coulson continued, getting to his feet and excitedly crossing the empty room.
Peter’s entire life was his family. If Venom denied him access to them then he had nothing. All that remained was Venom and his feedings. Peter cringed at the thought and felt nauseous.
. The boy’s voice called out to his sire with intense longing. He wanted the man to save him from Venom, hold him, and make him forget everything that happened.
“Tony, I can’t do anything right now, the meat’s cooking,” Steve explained, motioning to the said product with his spatula.
So, he waited and sleep tugged at his conscious, pulling him deeper into the dark void of oblivion. Time passed differently in the void. What felt like seconds were actually minutes…and a minute turned into an hour. By then, Wade was fully asleep and the bed remained empty, save for himself.
He zoned into those words, living within his head to escape the worst of it and only surface long enough to look up to make sure he was going in the right direction.
The door slammed open before Bucky could finish the sentence. Steve froze, half draped over Bucky, whereas Bucky instantly drew his gun and pointed it at the doorway.
Steve was not as good at subtle flirting or roundabout conversation as Tony was doing right now. He was more straight to the point and direct so he replied, “Only if you’ll have me.”
“...I knew his dad, he’d get a kick out of this,” Steve murmured. Howard would’ve probably been so proud of his son’s accomplishments.
Steve visibly relaxed and looked miserable all at once but continued to sign all the dotted lines she had marked off for him.
“Of course, Howard,” Peggy swore. “And let me know if there’s anything else I can do for all of you. I can be there within the hour.”
James shakily unbuckled his belt with the extra clips and tossed them to her. She nodded in thanks and then pointed only her gun outside and fired a few wild rounds to use up the last of her shots.
Peter must have noticed his glance because he stated, “My parents are down in the lab, doing ‘secret’ birthday things.” He went inside and Wade followed. As soon as they were within the safety of the Tower, Peter’s suit melted away and churning tendrils morphed into a dark shirt.
“You will break out of it again and again. Every day, you not only regain memoires, but you grow stronger…” She placed her hand on his chest and whispered, “And you seem even stronger when you are with me.”
Tony grinned and replied, “Me neither. Ever since I came up with this idea, the gears in my brain have been turning and I can’t stop thinking about it!”
Bucky dropped his head and his face became shadowed and unreadable. He got off the chair and walked away from the bed. He stood in front of the window and peered outside with a hard expression.
In the back of his mind, he could feel Venom manipulating his emotions by lessening his sorrow from missing his family and increasing his eagerness of his new identity, but Peter was distracted as he peered at his reflection with mounting excitement.
They languidly kissed and touched until daybreak. They spent their last few hours simply being with each other. They put forth no effort and did no strenuous activity. It was comforting but, with the rising of the sun, Steve halted the kissing with a groan. He pressed his face into Tony’s and moaned, “I don’t want to go.”
"Wow. Really helpful. Glad I spent all that money on your advanced systems," Tony stated sarcastically.
Steve reached up to him and Tony fell to his knees, falling into Steve’s arms with a sob. After taking in the state of his suit and lack of helmet, Steve gasped, “What happened to you? Are you alright??”
Listening to Steve’s accent was a turn on for Tony and, if the other two weren’t there, he’d have jumped on Steve by now. As it was, he was already staring at Steve with the ‘come hither’ look. Steve was pretending not to notice but a telltale flush burnished Steve’s cheeks, revealing to Tony that he definitely saw.
She shadowed James as he led them to a particular backdoor and then proceeded to kick it down. He let off two rounds as soon as he entered and then nodded her to follow him. She hustled past the body without a second glance.
“…I’m not expecting us to jump into sex. I just want to be with you. Cuddling!” Tony nervously said with Steve’s silence. “Like last night! Ugh, that came out wrong!”
Tony shook his hand and crooked his eyebrow and said, “I haven’t heard anything about you. Having an affair with
He bowed his head and a lump churned up from his gut and lodged in his throat. No more could be said…no more needed to be said.
Hulk was leaning into both of his massive fists, pinning Venom beneath his weight. Venom struggled in his grasp, but even before it grew weaker, Venom was no match for the Hulk. Hulk glowered at the symbiote and was mumbling darkly under his breath.
Nice to meet him? In the span of a few seconds, Steve reflected on the events of the last week: losing Bucky, thinking he died in the plane crash, waking in the frozen world felling as if his body was made of ice, and then discovering he was in the future…The world had changed for the better in some ways but it also had changed for the worse in other ways too…But the worst was it was no longer his world.
They were both fugitives and were being hunted by the government but, at that moment, Steve never felt happier in his life.
”Yeah...um. Friday, will the system still work with his arm this, um, way...?” Peter trailed off clearly wanting to say more. Was something missing from his arm? Did he had a device embedded to make his systems work?
“Oh God, Steve, go. Forget everything I just said. Go now!” Tony gasped, his voice laced with panic. The rest of the team followed their eyes and spotted Peter. Bruce was the closest to him and he hurried over to Peter and Mary.
Tony’s nano-suit reported multiple internal injuries and was in the process of removing foreign debris from his chest.
“Then, in the end, it will really determine when you are ready,” Logan said, stating the obvious but, with it spelled it for him like this, he felt it really settle in.
Steve too a few more steps and stopped. He regarded the tower in a whole new light and whispered, “Maybe I
This will mostly be Howard's POV and will take us from the day after Steve's death to his own death! And then we are back in the future...and, well, things are going to turn out a little differently...
Peter inhaled deeply then looked at the bedside table where Dad left his cellphone. Peter stared at it for a few moments before making up his mind and grabbing it.
Just Tony saying the words brought his emotions on high and reminded him how close he came to losing him. Neither of them were the young men they had been when they first met, but time did not diminish the strong feelings he had for the man in the opposite bed. Tony was truly his everything.
Before Steve could formulate a reply, a loafer came flying out of nowhere and struck the glass shard from Tyler’s hand. She hissed and a second shoe struck her in the head and she fell back. Steve glanced back and saw his team had arrived on scene with Clint bereft of both shoes.
Bucky flexed the arm and then moved each individual finger. He commented, “It moves just like my old arm.”
Btw, I wrote a really fluffy scene that I was unable to squeeze into this chapter, it will appear next chapter, but I will be (eventually) posting a part of it on my
“What’s wrong? SHIELD. SHIELD is wrong,” Tony said and pushed the hologram of his growing list to Coulson.
He finally found the blond in the command tent, hovering over a map with Aunt Peggy. Tony did not enter, just merely looked within. Neither noted his presence and continued to discuss the coordinates on the map before them. He loved watching Steve work, especially when he was concentrating on something. A small crease always appeared between his brows and his bottom lip jutted out just slightly. It was ridiculously endearing and so different from the easy smile Steve effortlessly wore. But who was he kidding? Steve’s calm smile was also charming.
Everything slowed again. The shield seemed to float slowly toward him and Ross appeared to leisurely raise his machinegun. Steve felt remorse, not for his own lost life, but for not being able to see Peter grow up or truly grow into the budding relationship between him and Tony or seeing recognition finally dawn in Bucky’s eyes. He closed his eyes and prayed his death would be enough of a distraction that Tony and Peter would get away.
He gasped with a heavy accent, “The American camp is over two hundred miles away. Did you walk that entire way?”
Brock hadn’t been at his apartment so Tony illegally tracked his phone and saw he was at another apartment complex. A quick search of social media helped them determine it was his girlfriend’s apartment he was staying in, in New Jersey.
Tony groaned and said, “Fine. Fine. I see I am outvoted and by my own soulmate.” Steve smiled appreciatively at him and Tony turned to the pool. He called out, “Peter! Stepan! Come here!”
Steve spared that red dot a few more seconds of his gaze and then he turned his eyes back to the Manhattan. He took in all the different colored dots moving around the city that each represented their team members and friends and then commanded, “Friday, update me on everyone’s missions, show me Peter’s last known location, and then connect me to the team.”
When the final bullet clicked into the barrel, Bucky turned the gun on Steve. Steve leaned back, weakly trying to escape the bullet he knew was meant for him. Bucky pointed the gun at his head and Steve squeezed shut his eyes. He immediately pictured Tony.
“Nooooo,” Peter groaned, suppressing a smile at the image. “But they want to get to know you, for me, you know?”
As if he heard her haughty thoughts, her soulmate reached behind him and whipped out a gun. The move was so fast Natasha could only attempt to dodge but her instructor was a marksman and he managed to shoot her either way.
He cautiously reached across the table with his flesh hand and lightly grasped Natasha’s hand. His hands were calloused and the large juncture between his thumb and forefinger was layered with scars from the backlash of the various guns he had used over the years. But the rough hands were warm and gentle. Like a nervous cat, she silently calmed under the light caress of his toughened fingers. He roughly whispered, “I don’t want them to take this from me.”
“Barton,” Natasha growled. She hovered over Tony’s shoulder and had been looking at the holograms but she sparred a moment to shoot her partner an icy glare. “Dig out the bullet. Tell us what we are dealing with.”
He sat down at his desk and opened all eight screens to see what Jarvis found on the mystery man in the amount of time it took for him to get home and iced.
Tony released one arm and, with his shirt still partially on, he grasped Steve’s hips and thrust his hips into his. Steve stapled his elbows on either side of Tony’s head and met his thrusts with his own. They stared at each other as they gasped shallowly and rubbed their sexes together in a clothed but amazing friction.
Clint's expression softened and he squeezed his husband's hand in silent support. Bucky didn't let his depressing feelings ruin the mood though, instead he turned to Steve. "You remember, Stevie? I think that's the first time you two officially met each other."
know, he's never heard Steve actually say it. Never had a clue before either but now he can feel it, he can feel
How wrong could he be? No matter how pretty the jail is, this is still prison. No matter how long the rope is, it is still around his neck. They could pretend, oh yes they could. They did.
"Unexpected, I guess. I freaked out a little bit. I wanted to be like everyone else. But I guess you're right. Now that I think about it...I think I've always known."
It was later in the afternoon that Steve decided to call Tony. His mother had gone to bed. It was pouring outside and the house was particularly quiet. The afternoon adorned melancholic colors. Steve splayed on his bed and took his phone. He dialed Tony's number a few times but it took him a while longer to find the courage to call him.
Steve inched back, startled, and dropped his arms on his sides. He gasped, lost for words, and stared back into his boyfriend's intense gaze.
Bucky is overwhelmed with joy, Steve asked Tony to fuck him bareback and the alpha is about to accept it. He touches his womb and a smile spreads on his face. He's gonna be a daddy again. If not with
The decor is eccentric. Just like Clint is, he supposes. There's absolutely no logic behind it. No style, no coherence. It's just heaps stuff that have no connection whatsoever. Knickknacks of all sorts, beautifully arranged however. At least Tony thinks so. He loves the atmosphere, it is so Clint. Pepper would completely freak out though. He internally laughs while imagining the face she would make if she were to see this, trying to remain polite by repressing a disgusted grimace.
back. The two of us. It's up to you then if you want to add Bucky in the picture or not." Tony stares at him confusedly. "And you're wrong about him, by the way. He cares about you. A lot."
Steve was happy to forget about everything and immerse himself in Dickens. English was one of his favorite subjects after arts and he was thoroughly considering it when applying for college next year. Therefore he focused all his attention on the class while catching his breath slowly,
His boyfriend walked back inside the office, smile victorious. He still looked shamelessly debauched. He leant against the wall and crossed his arms in silence.
Steve had yet made sure he had erased the smell from him. At least he thought he had. His mother gave him a soft smile.
He heard Tony hauling himself on the bed. "Don't tell me you're not planning to have at least one last fuck on this bed before leaving." He exclaimed indignantly. "Just for the sake of everything we've done in it for all those years..."
Steve didn't answer but Tony must have seen how he felt about it on his face because something shone in his eyes. His jaw was clenching as he seemed to be biting back what he had meant to say but soon the anger left his features to leave place to a deeper sadness.
Howard gave him an affectionate tap on the cheek and stared at him firmly, raising an eyebrow and showing Tony a self-satisfied smile. "Now, this is what you're gonna do," he kept on, tone cold and inflexible. "You're gonna call that girlfriend of yours, tell her you've got a family emergency—it always works—and fulfill your duty as my son and rightful heir of this company. This is what I've paid your tuitions for, after all..." He added on a more down-to-earth note. Howard perversely liked to guilt-trip Tony and constantly remind him everything he owed his parents. He wasn't even surprised. "Make me proud, Tony. I know you can do it." He said softly with a gentle, falsely concerned tone. "This is not by chance that you were born into this family, son. You're destined to do great things, like all of us. You're brilliant." Howard never complimented him, that was a sick joke to do it now, Tony thought, he had already surrendered. His father must really enjoy twisting the knife into the wound, force Tony down on his knees and hold his head down under his boot, to make sure he soundly broke him. "This is why you
"That's different. You're still fresh and peppy like the morning dew on the supple velvety petals of newly-blossomed flowers."
Well, he would go anyway, pretend nothing had happened, flash his best innocent smile and force his way in, just like he had always done until now. After all, Tony's forwardness and persistence had proved themselves to be rather efficient so far. He stared at his phone again. He really needed to work now. He'd like to take break and have a smoke though... This was so boring, why did dear old dad insist on him working here? He was already learning all the ropes with Obie. His place was in R&D. Not here, getting bored, his potential rotting away. He didn't have the shoulders to carry this company high anyway. He had no wish to either.
Steve nodded and Tony led them to the boys' rooms. They were both giggling as they ran past the bemused students and Tony pushed him inside before slamming the door shut. He pinned Steve against the wall and ran a soft hand down his cheek while staring into his eyes. His giggling turning suddenly into a seductive chuckle. Steve growled, feeling a wave of warmth flushing through his entire body. Tony smiled as he pressed himself against Steve, holding his face gently in his hands, and then he kissed him. So softly. Enough for Steve to lose his breath though. Steve liked when his boyfriend was being forward apparently. He liked it a lot even.
"Your friend told us you were raped." She insisted, maybe out of concern. "Do you think you could tell us more about the circumstances?"
Tony's smile faded. He pinched his lips, head tilted on the side. "We knew it would be like this with both our jobs. I've just been really busy. I wish I weren't but... this is how things are. The rest is up to us now, I guess."
cross that line. I wish you would... And maybe I'll put you in your place if I think you're going too far, just like you do with me, but that doesn't mean you have to keep from trying."
Steve was still in the process of trying to find out why his boyfriend had suddenly blurted that Steve liked him to be submissive in the middle of preparing lunch when he heard Tony chuckle behind. He span on his heels, the salad servers still in his hand, and was faced with two shining marbles, staring at him wantonly, only inches from his face. He didn't really know how that had happened but apparently his boyfriend had managed to skirt around the counter like a swift cat and was leaning over him, pushing him against the counter with his whole body and trapping him between strong arms. Very
Tony shivered, already regretting the warmth of the man's body, he was still shaken. He stared a little defiantly at the man. He had understood the message perfectly well, thank you.
Tony curled his arms around Steve and wrapped himself around him, body hot and sweaty, smelling so delicious. He rested his head against Steve's. "It doesn't change anything, right?"
"Hi!" Steve answers with the same huskiness in his voice, mirroring his boyfriend's happy smile. He lets his hands run up his neck, following the lines of his stout shoulders, and grabs him with strength.
as an artist, too. No-one else had ever wanted to buy my art before. I mean no-one I didn't know and... And I didn't wanna sell it at first but then, I..."  The words died down on his tongue before he could say them, maybe he didn't believe himself in what he was saying. He felt the tears prickle at the corner of his eyes but smothered them and swallowed down the lump in his throat. "You wouldn't understand anyway."
Now that the school year is over. Now that they both graduated with flying colors, Tony especially, it has been a little arduous for them to see each other but they make do. They find time. They trick Tony's parents. It's not that they're interested in spending time with and get to know who their only son is anyway. The last days have been the hottest of the summer and Tony's parent's are away, to a place where the heat is much more bearable. Tony has stayed, pretending the need to take care of last minutes necessities before settling down in the dorms. Tony will leave for Boston on Monday, to attend special advanced summer programs before starting college.
Tony stared into his eyes, hesitant. That was a question he had never asked himself actually, pain had always been part of his sex life. Except, maybe, with Steve? That was also a question he didn't want to think about now. Sex with those guys better hurt, because that was what Tony was here for. Get hurt. Get humiliated. Get what he deserved. Anything else made him feel extremely uncomfortable.
Steve's stomach clenched. Tony kept growing and one day he would leave him behind. Maybe Steve should go back to therapy too.
Tony stared at him with worried eyes. "Are you alright?" Steve nodded quickly, blushing embarrassedly. He felt so inexperienced next to Tony's easy self-confidence. "We don't have to rush things, you know? We don't
Tony was back to the other side of the counter before Steve could regain composure however, laid back on the stool and ready to start lunch as if nothing had happened. Steve let out a long relieved sigh and climbed on the stool, glaring at his boyfriend. The latter was finishing his apple with a smirk.
Tony lets out a surprised laugh as he takes his first drag and almost chokes because of it. "Not that much actually..." He says with a broken voice while puffing out the smoke through his nose. He keeps playing with the contents of the box, taking out the weirdest stuff and examining it with the precision of a scientist.
"No." Tony categorically replied, blunt and direct. "I just felt it was the right time to ask again."
Bucky stared up at him with wide-open eyes. Steve internally smiled, he wasn't even being dishonest. He heard the other two snigger behind him and knelt down lasciviously next to his best friend, staring right into his eyes, lips parted and a sudden urgent
Steve growled as he came, spurting long strands of cum in Tony's throat. Tony eyes were plunged into Steve's, wet and shiny, and silent. He swallowed everything without protest and licked cravingly one last time before he let the used up cock slip out of his mouth. Steve was still shaking and panting and trying to catch his breath. Tony was on his knees, eyes hazy and lewd but passive. He looked debauched and Steve's half-hard cock jolted at the sight of him. He ran a hand in his damp hair and pulled on it a little. They were tousled, his clothes disheveled. Tony turned and tilted his head slightly, nuzzling into Steve's hand, brushing the tip of his nose against his wrist while humming softly. The urgency from before was gone, although he was still rock hard in his pants. They were both in a daze, happy and fulfilled. Steve ran his thumb down his cheek and brushed his lips, opening his mouth a little. Tony let him and caught his thumb into his mouth, sucking on it.
It took him a moment to realize the bell had rung. It took him a moment, too, to take his eyes off the boy's slender nape and the way he held his head aloofly. It was all quiet suddenly, or maybe Steve didn't pay enough attention to his surroundings anymore, or maybe he didn't care.
He's feeling restless though so he asks Jarvis to check on his alpha. From what Jarvis says, everything went according to plan. He feels ecstatic. He feels so fucking
Tony chuckled. He grabbed his face in his hands and plunged his eyes into his. "It's just an angel with my face." He whispered with a smile. "And for what it's worth," he added, "it's really a
By the time Natasha and Clint came back from the kitchen with food and drinks, Steve had already forgotten about his misplaced feelings of unnecessary jealousy. It surely had something to do with the fact that most of the time they spent together was just the two of them. Steve didn't not feel insecure then.
Steve raised an eyebrow at him, although Tony was still looking at the view outside, his back turned to him. "That it was impersonal..." Steve admitted in a sigh.
It makes life a lot easier. It makes dating Tony a lot easier too, his dad won't give him any crap because he smells like alpha. People like Tony's dad are so narrow-minded in this department they could never imagine an alpha would want to hide they're alpha.
Tony's lips unintentionally quirk up. "I'm wasted." He answers, playing with his boyfriend's thin fingers. Steve chuckles against his back and Tony feels the rumble resonate in his entire body.
He startled and raised his head in a jerk, moving his hands abruptly on the side. Tony laughed softly and tilted his head on the side, a warm smile brightening his face.
No-one's at the door and he gets used to the smell pretty quickly, as if he was always meant to be here. He expects James to come any second and he roams around slowly, touching nervously the furniture as if it was the first time he came. The tips of his fingers brush the wood delicately, the feeling of the material enhanced on his sensitive skin. He focuses on the defects that make the product all the more authentic. His heart starts racing. Panic surreptitiously taking over his brain. What was he thinking coming down here? The two omegas are going to be the end of him. If not today then soon.
Steve chuckled. His back was turned to his boyfriend as he had resumed emptying his cupboards. "Which one?" He asked teasingly.
Tony wishes he could do the same but he doesn't think Steve would like that. He keeps his distance instead, cradling his beer in his hand, and doesn't even dare look at his boyfriend in the eye.
He finally decided to unglue himself from his seat and leave. He pondered telling his friends he was going but decided against it. They would insist to drive him back and he needed to be alone and brood. He conned his way out, deceiving the people who were guarding the entrance, making sure no omegas were leaving by themselves. Stupid rules.
They emptied out of the car and Tony announced, “Alright, everyone, you know the drill! Pick a room, any room! Jarvis is here too so if you need any help with anything just ask him! We should only be here until Steve and I are discovered so expect only a few days at the most!”
“C’mere Wilson, pull up a chair,” Natasha called him over. Wade and Peter exchanged glances and then Wade wordlessly left Peter’s side to join them at the counter.
Eventually, Tony caught his breath and he pushed himself out of Steve’s arms and angrily yelled, “YOU WERE DEAD!”
She rushed forward and grabbed his free hand and then begged, “There has to be another way! Somebody else – or another time –!” She gasped the words with tears welling up in her eyes.
“Nat and I are going to check the sewers,” Bucky whispered, his eyes were fixated on the black tea Natasha had brewed him. He had yet to touch it and the steam that had originally floated on its surface had long since dissipated.
“Thanks, Pegs,” Steve murmured, dropping his head as he was overcome by his emotion. He felt so broken by hurting Tony so but he was still glad he did because it was the only thing he could do to help save him.
“I like Wade a lot,” Peter added to Wade’s statement and scooted closer to Wade so that his leg slightly overlapped Wade’s.
“Mr. Stark? When did you get here?” Sam asked, finally reaching them. The social worker at his side looked between them with wide disbelieving eyes. Sam must’ve forgotten to mention he’d left the baby with an Avenger.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he whispered sincerely. “It broke my heart just thinking of breaking my promise to you and to actually do it made me feel like a monster.”
Tony returned the hug and smiled at him with the largest grin he’d seen on him yet...and wow, what a smile. Steve's heart beat a little faster and he squeezed Tony's shoulder a little tighter.
“After everything that happened last year, no one would have faulted you for not wanting Bucky to live in the Tower but you let him. And now you are trying to help him get back together with Natasha. You’re going above and beyond…” Steve reached across the counter and lightly caressed the side of Tony’s arm with his thumb. He murmured, “So thank you.”
Pepper grabbed his shoulder and agreed, “Yes, the direct approach will work best but let’s do my approach. It’s safer, legal, and will get Steve back here and safe more likely than your plan!”
Steve scratched his beard and peered up at the growing skyscraper. He murmured, “I just need to speak with him for a moment. I know he'll want to speak to me once he knows who…once he meets me.”
Tony’s grip tightened on his and Steve glanced guiltily at his boyfriend then refocused his gaze on the toddler sleeping in his arms.
“God, Steve,” Tony gasped. With his free hand, he tightly gripped his thigh and sloppily kissed the inside of his leg and gasped, “You’re going to make me come if you keep making noises like that.”
"And then we had to complete the mission with a very finite number of jumps left," Natasha teased Bucky, sliding in next to him. She carded his fingers into Bucky's one good hand and they both smiled warmly at each other with sparkling eyes.
Bucky tilted his head slightly as Steve pulled his bike onto the sidewalk and next to Bucky. Steve remained sitting on the bike as he looked out over the water with Bucky.
“The aliens are in the pipes,” Solo murmured to him one day his mind had grown too fragile. He was rocking back and forth, clutching his arms gasping, “If you are careful enough, they’ll enter your body though the water and take over your mind.
Tony continued, hoping hitting Steve with both shocking revelations at once would lessen the blow, “Steve, she’s using one of those samples to prove her accusation…”
That, combined with the gust of air produced from the blast, they were flung clear across the roof and into a partition.
Steve leaned back on the couch and Tony carefully sat down beside him, cradling Peter like he was the most precious item in the entire universe. He leaned into Steve’s side and they both stared down at the precious boy in Tony’s arms.
“Don’t put that back in you!” Steve gasped, aghast. He reached toward the reactor as if to stop Tony.
Peggy followed his gaze and murmured a question Steve didn’t hear because Tony’s eyes found his and he was instantly enraptured. Tony’s gaze settled on Steve’s accompanied with a weary, small, and sad attempt at a smile and then he slowly made his way over.
Tony didn’t sleep well. The constant ache in his chest and uncomfortable cot were reminiscent to when he had been held captive by the Ten Rings. It made for uneasy dreaming.
They tiptoed around each other at first and barely spoke other than the cordial greeting in passing. Both of them were avoiding the white elephant in the room which was their relationship, until finally…
“…I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony murmured gently. Tony reached forward and lightly took his hand. Steve curled his fingers into Tony’s and they both looked at each other with longing.
“Ugh,” Tony groaned, knowing the man was probably right. His super soldier was a Boy Scout after all…Tony wrapped both of his arms around Steve and grumbled to Fury, “Can Steve and I celebrate our engagement now?”
Bruce peered down at his nephew sadly. Peter shared with him a fate he would have never wished on anyone. Before he attained a measure of control on the Hulk, his other half had killed hundreds of innocents and had even eaten a few of them.
When he was on the roof and his hands were empty he couldn’t help but remember the even more empty feeling in his hands when Tony had disappeared.
“Master Parker was orphaned at age five,” Jarvis stated. “Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane accident.” A news article replaced the picture of Peter and his aunt. The headline read: Prominent Scientist Couple Killed in Plane Crash. There was a black and white grainy image of the destroyed plane. Jarvis added, “His uncle, Ben Parker, also recently passed.” Another article appeared, smaller than the last, titled: Mugging Gone Wrong.
Now understanding the reasoning to both of men’s amusement, Steve snorted as well and said to Tony, “We have to correct this before people start asking for
As Steve punched, the bag went flying back but it did not explode under the force like a normal bag would have. Tony designed the bag. It was made with a tougher fiber and hooked to the ceiling with a rubbery metal alloy that could take extreme violence. Remembering Tony’s part in the bag’s creation made Steve roar and attack the bag with no abandon. He did not know how long he punched the bag but once it finally gave out, Steve was drenched with sweat, shaking with emotion, and still angry.
Steve wished he could wrap Peter in a cocoon and protect him from all of this, the reality of death and the loss of a loved one. He was at a loss on how to comfort his son. In the past, all he needed to do was hold his boy and all of Peter's fears or pain would go away. It was the same for Steve, Peter's presence had always calmed him yet now... Tony's loss was so great to both of them that even being with each other was not enough.
“Everything is fine now,” Steve said before Tony could annoy the director anymore. “We’ll give you a full report later…It’s been a long few weeks for me and I just really need to spend some time with my fiancé,” Steve said the last bit with so much sincerity that Tony, squeezed his hand a little tighter.
“Peter! He’s going to be born like this year or maybe next year…Or maybe last year? What year did I come to again?” He looked down his watch and chuckled, “Whoa, little early...Either way, long story short, you two are going to adopt him and then he’s going to grow up into this amazing superhero but he’s going to get in a fuckton of trouble because future yous are on the other side of the solar system right now helping protect Earth from these aliens. BUT Peter needs you! He needs his super dads! Better yet, the half naked, sexy versions!”
Tony did not exactly say the speech Pepper gave him precisely but he was straight to the point. He stated all the damning facts about Tyler and then followed it up with all the truthful facts about Steve. He finished it stating, “I hope everyone will see this trial for what it truly is and stand by us in our hardest hour. Thank you for listening, now I am going to get some fondue time with Steve.”
He looked to helping people to fill the emptiness in his heart instead and Bucky was always two steps behind him.
Steve’s shield was leaning against the wall in his bedroom. His arm felt bare without it and he itched to throw it at the Trickster.
Tony smiled warmly and he was already looking better since he first stepped into Peter’s lab. They embraced one last time and Peter ran to the elevator.
Finally, he typed the word “gay” into the search bar. As he typed, it popped up with suggested searches, the top being “gay marriage.” Steve’s eyebrows rose and he selected that option.
“It just sorta slipped out,” Steve garbled embarrassedly. His eyes were glued to Tony’s chest. He’d seen Tony without a shirt before but now he reached out and tentatively touched him.
“No, I was just going to check in with the others and see if there was anything more I could do before we go.”
Steve’s mouth quirked into a small smile and he whispered, “It’ll come with time. The alternative would be me still being frozen so this is definitely an improvement.”
Steve stilled as his vision began to fade. Before everything went black, he saw conflicting emotions war on Bucky’s face as the Winter Soldier and Bucky fought for dominance. There was anger from the Soldier and despair from Bucky.
Peter had no idea what to say. He wanted to berate and apologize to Tony at the same time. The wounds were still too fresh for him to think rationally.
Steve fell back against the cold metal of the elevator and exhaled loudly as he placed his hand over his heart. He gasped to himself, “That was incredible.”
He’d gone over countless scenarios on how to ask Steve and watched at least 300 surprise proposals on YouTube to psych himself up for it and maybe garner a few ideas. But, in the end, he couldn’t help but wonder if Steve was ready. What if he wasn’t ready to escape the safety of simply being boyfriends?
“Call Bruce,” Tony hissed. Steve was already one step ahead of him, running to the where he left his cell phone on the kitchen counter. All the power was off in their apartment. The refrigerator no longer hummed and the digital clock on the microwave was blank.
But Steve felt like a different man. He looked down to Tony and reassessed the thought, he was a more appreciative man. He’d gone through losing his lover and he knew how lucky he was to have him again.
Steve smiled and murmured, “Oh, you know him, he worried and fretted and muttered dark things under his breath…”
More tranquilizers were shot into him and Steve collapsed. He fell facing Tony and he squeezed his eyes closed so he would not have to look at the unmoving figure.
“Yes, Ma’am,” Peter said with a light bow. As soon as he straightened, he leapt into a sprint and started running around the perimeter of the gym. The gym took up an entire floor so he had quite a distance to run.
“Probably,” Peter replied poking one of the tendrils. “I don’t think it ever responded to Mac like this. Maybe our solution made it stronger.”
Peter’s reply was sobering. Tony tried not to let the hurt show. Peter valued his privacy but Tony was a very outgoing and open person. Part of the reason he wanted to marry Steve was so he could show everyone, the world, how much he loved that man…with Peter he’d never get that chance. It hurt having to confine himself in such a way, but he’d continue to do it. He loved his son and, even though he couldn’t yell it from the top of his lungs in the middle of Times Square, Tony would continue to follow Peter’s wishes.
“It just brings back bad memories,” Steve whispered with a stiff shrug. “…My mom died of cancer in a hospital…It was a long process which I don’t like being reminded of.”
Steve wrapped his arms around his own waist as if to keep himself from touching Tony and, with a frustrated sigh, Steve said, “This sucks…”
Peter was still asleep. Steve leaned over him, touching his belly lightly as he did. He watched him sleep and loved the sound his light exhalations. He leaned down and kissed his son’s tiny hand, the side of his soft cheek, and the tip of his button nose. He did it lightly enough that Peter slept through it all, drawing another smile to Steve’s lips.
Steve smiled at his best friend and his not very cryptic way of asking how Steve felt about Tony.  Steve replied, “Far from it.”
“We’re running out of time, Cap,” Cable stated. “We need to collect as much of the reactor as we can if we want it to work.”
Tony had done what a normal person would do when he found out his soulmate, a man he loved more than himself, was dead. He went mad with grief.
The excitement in him grew until he could barely contain it. As it was, he was smiling widely at nothing.
Tony’s eyes merely passed over these two photos and focused on the one that sat in front of them all. Tony picked it up with a small smile and whispered, “You sentimental idiot.”
His dad replied with an immediate heart emoji and MJ replied with several laughing face emojis a few moments later and a promise to be there.
Tony looked over his shoulder, his neck muscles protesting as he did, and peered questionably at Steve. He asked, “Out-out? Do you want to make some kind of appearance or –?”
“Yes, Sir,” Jarvis replied. A horizontal video began to play so Tony tilted his screen accordingly. He recognized the build of Steve’s body immediately but he did not see him. The camera was focused on his back. He was wearing a hoodie with its hood up. He was meandering through a crowd. Tony’s skin crawled and he whispered, “Where is he?”
“If you help him,” Steve replied. He quickly scanned the group and did not see his son. A prickling of unease started at the base of his spine and he left the kitchen without another word. He looked to the base of the bunny again but his son was still not there. Steve jogged across the room and looked into the other rooms and saw no trace of him.
“Guilty,” Tony stated with a grin. He leaned in closer and whispered, “I was putting together the finishing touches on Project Winterwidow Part 6.”
Steve turned to Bruce but paused when he saw the Hulk standing behind them all. The Hulk was hyperventilating but glaring at Loki with an irrational stare.
Jarvis stared at him with an unmoving frame. In a clear, undistinguishable voice, Jarvis slowly stated, “I will repeat this one last time, as it is vital: there is sensitive information in this conversation, especially so with the other persons present…Are you sure you wish to continue with them in attendance?”
Gary nodded and quickly readied his order. The older man suddenly paused and paled as he looked over Steve’s shoulder.
As it was, his anxiety was building along with the effects of his hangover. He never thought about August 20th or what it meant to him beyond the confines of the date. It was safer that way because, if he thought on it anymore, his life would be all the bleaker. But here it was August 21st, that meant this hidden part of Tony's life was encroaching on another day and threatened to spew into all the other days.
The moment Thor had pushed Hulk aside, Steve turned back to Tony. In the few seconds Steve had taken his eyes off him, he had not moved at all. He leaned over Tony, his vision beginning to blur from his uncontrollable tears, and he gasped, “
Tony personally charged himself with teaching the man the important things like classic rock, cult movies and their actors, and all the different flavors of chips the world provided. They listened to rock all day long, snacked on chips, and watched a movie every night.
One magazine actually had a foldout of all the possible women in Steve’s life. It had a chart with over two dozen images. Each box contained a photo snapped of Steve with a woman and beneath each photo was a description of the woman and the possibility of a relationship. Natasha, Pepper, and Sharon were all there, in addition to the Villainess the Enchantress which made Tony laugh aloud again. The photo included was from the fight with the woman. Steve had his shield raised to block off one of the woman’s attacks. That woman gave Steve “the hebbie gebbies” as quoted by the Captain himself.
“That’s right,” his dad agreed, sitting on Peter’s other side. “You’re not alone in this. We’re going to be with you every step of the way.
There was more traffic on the road than when he first pursued Enigma. It was rush hour, everyone was getting off work so Tony knew he wasn’t going to be chasing after him in this traffic.
“Almost!” Tony stated, “It did not happen! And let’s not forget, you were the one to kiss me first—!”
It felt nice to cuddle with Steve like this. They rarely got to do it. Mostly he fell asleep in Steve’s arms like this so his eyes felt heavy as soon as they settled.
Thor did not care, in fact, he thought Steve was coming on to him. He informed Steve that he was in a relationship with Jane but if they ever broke up then he may consider Steve. In Asgard, sexual preference was apparently not an issue and Steve had to try to explain Earthling’s problems with it. Ultimately, Thor became more confused by Earth’s politics but in the end he was assured that Steve was not coming on to him.
The Soldier had been sleeping in a bunker at a base in Cuba. He instantly sat up and drew his gun. The safety was off in an instant and his finger was on the trigger, but no one was there.
He did not know why Bucky saved him, nonetheless, kissed him. And he did not know where Bucky was or if he was a danger to anyone.
? New Mexico? Are we talking E.T. here, Jarvis?” Tony asked excitedly. Thoughts of Area 51 and other alien conspiracies blossomed in his mind.
Steve's suit opened up similarly to Tony’s but, with it no longer holding him up, he fell out unable to stand anymore. The heat had drained him more than he realized. Tony cursed and surged forward, catching Steve just as he hit his knees.
He knew Steve loved him and was already committed to him for life. But getting married meant their relationship would then be public record. There was no escaping the media backlash. Steve hated too much attention. If he had a choice, he’d want to live like an average guy and be able to go down the street without being swarmed by reporters. At the moment, the media left him alone in favor of chasing down more interesting or violent superheroes. Steve liked going to the corner bakery or the supermarket. He was enough of a regular there that the no one bothered him other than the occasional fan that bumped into him and asked for an autograph…but if they came out, Steve wouldn’t be able to do that anymore.
They usually were given boxed rations of dry, unappetizing food, but their cooks raided Hydra's kitchen and had been cooking them up feasts since they found the large kitchen its abundant pantry. Steve's stomach was growling as soon as smelt the first whiff of sweet brown sugar and bacon. Steve picked up his step and Tony instantly moved in step with him and they quickly joined the line for food.
He was recognized in seconds but Steve did not notice. Internally, he was wagering a war with Venom inside his head.
Steve’s heart clenched at the word "love" and his mind replayed Tony’s gasp after Steve’s confession...
The car was jerked back and Peter was the only one who managed to stay up right since he was still sticking to the seat. His Spidey Sense was fueling his adrenaline and his heart was racing in his chest. The car was wrenched in two and icy cold air stole his breath. Peter suddenly found himself alone. He heard his father yell out to him but all he could see was the glowing red eyes of a poorly constructed robot that held up his half of the car.
“Vision doesn’t smell right because he’s a synthetic humanoid,” Natasha stated, “He is a good person but he is not
The drinking, however, was a regular topic between them. If Tony went to bed drunk, he was usually still tipsy in the dreamscape.
“Your parents made your uncle and I swear to keep it a secret,” his aunt hissed, her voice was tight and she sounded on the verge of tears.
“We had to go to a few places actually, until we found one the right color,” Natasha said with a smirk and then took a sip out of her own mug.
They were quick to add visiting the workshop to their routine but soon found themselves spending most of their time in Tony’s workshop. Peter was entranced by Tony as he worked. From the sparks that came off his blowtorch to the holograms that glowed with Tony’s specs, Peter could not stop watching. As soon as he woke, h's son began asking to go down there and, every time they left, he threw a tantrum.
Tony’s heart flip-flopped in his chest and he strolled over to Steve, smiling flirtatiously as he said, “Was I supposed to get an invitation?”
Tony grasped both sides of his face and drew him into a deep kiss, smothering his words. Steve groaned and fell into him. He ran his hands over his back and traced the familiar muscles. Tony pulled back slightly, keeping his hands on his face, and whispered into his lips, “I love you too you big lummox. God, I – I thought you were dead. When I heard you were on Air Force One, I thought you went down with the plane!” He kissed him again, his lips lingering longer. When he pulled back again, he ran his thumb over Steve’s bottom lip and whispered, “I thought losing Happy to a coma was bad but after saving everyone on that plane –
“I have no idea what you are talkin—,” Tony began smugly. Natasha slammed a small metal box on the counter in front of Tony and the smug look fell off his face. Tony instantly shut up and blanched. Steve eyed the box with a frown. What was it that it had the power to scare Tony such?
Peter closed his eyes and took comfort in Wade’s nearness. He lightly nuzzled his face against Wade’s and whispered, “Feels mighty comfy here…”
Tony was still staring at him with a shocked expression. Steve groaned internally. He let this go too far. Tony had asked Steve to tell him to stop if things got too weird but Steve did not give him the same courtesy. Tony must be creeped out.
Natasha’s heart seized in her chest. She wordlessly crossed the room and rounded the body in seconds.
might even be hurt but his body was pumping with so much adrenaline he wouldn’t even notice at that point.
The robot keep eluding them and, as Peter groaned, Harry laughed. They quickly cornered the robot and it swung the giant arm, looking between both boys.
asked,” Norman scoffed. “The doctor is a very private person and I will not bother her…especially when it is with people she does not know or…” Norman looked pointedly at Steve and his smile curled more. “Or it is with people she holds no relations with…”
Y’all! I’ve been wanting to say this in the comments forever but can finally reveal (if you haven’t guessed already) the future was not changing just because of their relationship. Every time Tony charged his suit, the reactor broke down more. On the daily, the future shifted with every charging. His future, and odds of survival, lessened every day. But, now, because of his weakened state and the relationships he formed…well, the future is still uncertain because people will do crazy things for the ones they love :) <3
It had not been a question and Steve had readily agreed. After Steve gave up his son to his new godmother, Tony began to mutter indignantly under his breath about being godfather.
His breath hitched and he pressed his face into her thigh. He turned his body toward hers and wrapped his arm across her lap, catching his hand on her hip.
“…So much for not seeing the wedding dress till the day of,” Tony stated sarcastically, trying to hide how emotional it made him.
Steve rolled his eyes again but slumped into Tony’s side and wrapped his arms around him. His weight on Tony’s back was a comfort and he relaxed into his husband’s arms with a light sigh.
Bucky shook his head and got to his feet. He wordlessly walked away and Tony let him go even though everything inside him was telling him to chase after his friend and make him believe it’d all be okay…but, he didn’t know that. He didn’t know how this was all going to turn out in the end for Bucky. The man went through countless horrors and some people wouldn’t be able to handle that knowledge. Only time would tell if Bucky could…
Peter and Harry came over and stared curiously at them. Steve’s flush deepened with the extra audience.
Coulson, Pepper, Tony, and Steve were all gathered in one of the Tower’s conference rooms. Steve and Tony were the only two sitting and Coulson and Pepper looked like they were about to bite each other’s faces off.
The agent was a part of the government so Steve avoided her and the agent did not seem to notice or care.
Tony raised his gaze and met his super soldier’s eyes. Everything in Steve’s expression was open with his love but his facial features were also clearer than he’d ever seen before. He ran his thumb over a freckle on Steve’s cheek that he’d never seen before and, for the first time, felt the stubble on his face.
Bucky did not relax until Natasha’s eyes passed over him then they went back to pretending each other did not exist.
Natasha was sitting up with him as she was instantly awake with exclamation. She relaxed when she saw there was no clear danger.
Tony grinned, his cheeks were starting to hurt from all the smiling he had been doing. He pointed himself to the balcony and landed. His suit was removed as he walked inside.
“It’s alright,” Tony murmured. “Don’t apologize. Life hasn’t been kind to you and it’s alright to cry. Let it out, Steve.”
Tony rubbed his erection against Steve’s half hard cock and teased, “Make a decision or I will come all over you. And you will have to wait a while until I get it back up again.”
Steve cleared his throat, glanced at Tony, and said, “We...were wondering if you knew the truth about your birth?”
Tony let out a breath of relief and leaned against the Jeep with a heavy sigh. The entire side of his left face was throbbing. It hurt to breathe and one of his molars might’ve been loosened too. He kicked the dead man’s leg and groaned, “Thanks, buddy.”
She turned around and ran straight to the cold room and slammed the door closed. It could only lock from the outside so the barrier was near useless but it was a barrier all the same. There was a handle so she held onto it and hissed to Steve, “We’ve got to keep this closed as long as possible.”
company…I bet I can get his number by the end of the night.” They walked past the alcove, carrying tray laden with food and their chatter ended as they stepped out.
He’d grown used to the hollow feeling that such a worth accompanied…until Natasha had changed that. She had given his life value again. It was taken away when they took him away but now, years later, she had presented him with the possibility of giving it value again.
“The sunshine state hasn’t banned Steve from crossing its borders, Jarvis,” Tony chipped, an annoyed edge to his voice as he did not understand why the AI was trying to stop Steve.
He'd lost his best friend once before...but this time felt more tragic. Bucky had gone through and lost so much. It was not fair that it end like this...that he'd lost
“Yes, sir,” one retorted and quickly hurried over to a wooden crate. He pulled out a tin of Blue Ribbon Baking Powder and asked, “Will this do?”
“Not without Uncle Clint to watch,” Steve replied, making Peter sigh. Steve asked him, “How long have you been able to crawl on walls?”
Steve thanked his friend and ran in the direction of the main offices where he knew Peggy would be either bent over reports or writing missives.
“Nah, nah,” Wade continued, still running his hand over his scalp. “It's true. I’m as crazy as a soup sandwich.”
“…Sir, there was an anomaly on one of the outside cameras that may peak your interest,” Jarvis interrupted his melodic droning.
“Why would they do that?!” Peter demanded. He broke his eyes away from the photo and looked to his aunt. Her hand was over her mouth and her eyes were glassy.
Peter shook his head and smiled grimly at Tony. He whispered, “I am no longer a kid and I can’t go back. My uncle once told me, ‘with great power, comes great responsibility.’ I was gifted with the ability to help people. I can’t ignore it.”
Natasha nodded and ran out of the makeshift HQ to her motorcycle outside. She made the trip to Brooklyn in half the time by splitting lanes, using the sidewalk at times, and running red lights. She kept her expression passive as she raced to the scene but internally, her usually calm self was giving into grief.
Steve looked down at his chest. Beneath the layer of ice was his internationally recognizable uniform and on his back was his shield. They would know who he was in seconds.
Tony bit down on his lower lip and slowly released it, making Steve’s mouth water. God, he wanted to go back to kissing him. Tony raised his hand back to the hem of his robe at chest level and unhurriedly drew it to the side. The soft fabric caressed his skin as it parted and exposed him to Tony. At first, only a little was exposed, a column of his right pec, torso, hip, and thigh. His penis and the rest of them remained hidden behind the rest of his robe.
“We needed to be near Stark in case something happened. If we were on the other side of the country we would’ve been no good to him.”
She grimly led the team in. Her assumptions were half right. One of the bodies was Tony with his armor ruined and in a pool of old, drying blood.
Steve stripped and stepped into the tub the best he could and scrubbed off the sweat, semen, and leftover Vaseline from his body. He crossed his legs to fit but they were so large that they were sticking out over the rim. He had to work hard to keep most of the water in the tub. The Army regulation soap was unscented but a good cleanser and he felt freshly clean in no time.
Peter was sitting at Bucky’s feet, his hand on his leg, and he was peering up at Bucky. Bucky was hunched over with his hands sitting relaxed in his lap and he was telling Peter, “—im since we were kids, so I guess I’m more of an un—…” He paused when he noticed Steve and Tony.
He wanted to run after her and scream that nothing needed to change. It shouldn’t matter he was once American! They were still soulmates. They still cared for each other.
Tony did not see the other two’s reactions as he was caught by Steve’s instant dazzling smile. He rushed forward and embraced Tony.
This drew the reporters to their feet and they yelled questions at him but Tony remained silent until they returned to their seats.
“Sir!” Barton knocked on his door loudly and then barged in before Coulson could invite him. The archer ran over to his desk, holding out his phone and gasping, “You’ve got to see this!
When the doors opened, he wiped the juices off his face and stepped outside. He tossed the core in a trashcan beside the elevators and then made his way over to the labs. He had to pass through a few security checkpoints. He knew all of the security guards by name but, as he approached the first guard, Jake, he knew things were not going to go as smoothly from there.
Vision was at Wanda’s side in an instant and he murmured, “We need to get back to the Tower immediately.”
The last time Tony had seen Peter was over a week ago. In the single day Venom had him, his son had been reduced to skin and bones. Another day would have killed him and so much more time has passed.
“Dummy, halt!” Tony eventually called out and the robot came to an immediate stop. The boys almost ran into him it was so sudden.
“Or maybe we didn’t say anything because it was when we banged for the first time in months?” Tony suggested. “Wade did kinda interrupt us, you know?”
Steve's words went straight to his heart. He was touched that Steve felt that way. He smiled at the man standing on the other side of the counter and replied, “Of course, Pops.”
Tony dropped the specs he was working on and ran straight to where Jarvis directed him to where Steve was.
Steve sighed, “Yeah, but he’s out on patrol and Friday said he didn’t leave an ETA for when he’d be back.”
He uncovered the radio but grimly noted it was no longer humming with power. He flicked the on-off switch a few times but the static never sounded and his stomach sank. He tried the radio anyway and pressed the button.
He could not meet Natasha’s knowing eyes nor deal with Clint’s reaction to his and Natasha’s old kiss.
They spent the first few weeks relearning each others bodies and souls. Most of the time they spent at the mansion, but they continued to sneak out on dates and food runs. The most the reporters got was that his name was Steve and it frustrated them to no end that they could not get anything else on Tony Stark’s new boyfriend.
Bruce knew he woke by the way he tensed. Peter’s fingers dug into Tony and Tony winced from the pressure. Peter relaxed a moment later as he remembered where he was and he looked questionably at Bruce.
Tony push Steve’s legs off his shoulders and Steve wrapped them around his torso, digging his heels into Tony’s ass. Still thrusting, Tony leaned over him and did as Steve asked, kissing him. His tongue speared itself into Steve’s mouth and Steve greedily sucked on it to keep it in. Tony obliged with a moan. He kept his hands on Steve’s ass, pulling him up to meet his every thrust. Tony’s tongue began to mimic his cock’s thrusts, plunging in and out of his mouth.
Comprehension dawned in her eyes and Natasha leaned forward and lightly grasped his arm. She whispered, “It’s not stupid, it’s affection. It shows you care and there’s nothing stupid about that…”
The door opened and his dad poked his head out. He smiled as soon as his eyes landed on him. Tony’s unconditional love still made Peter’s stomach bubble happily even after all of these years. It was a father’s love, something that had already been stolen from him twice before with Richard and Ben Parker’s early deaths, making it doubly precious to Peter now.
“But,” she whispered. “I won’t have to until the faraway future if you address his internal and external bleeding.”
He and Tony were thrown to the side, with Steve landing on top of him. Their bodies didn’t land in any compromising positions but the front of their faces ended centimeters from each other and both flushed from the sudden closeness.
“Hey,” Tony grasped the side of his face and made him look at him. He whispered, “You’re going to get through this. Don’t think about the negative aspects right now. That’s what I’m paying my lawyers for. Think of only the good. Think of us, right here, right now. Together.”
“He only wants to understand,” Steve said, pinching Peter’s cheek. Peter playfully pushed at his hand and Steve said to Natasha, “He does not remember much so he does not understand your anger.”
“Are you really in danger?” Steve asked, looking skeptically out the windows to the peaceful scenery outside. Tony was beginning to wonder the same too.
Tony winked at him and remarked, “I think they approve of you, beloved. It looks like half of these articles are about the ‘handsome’ stranger that caught Tony Stark’s eye.”
So he created an algorithm to find people’s soulmates based off the time left on their timers. Never before had anyone made a program that could connect to everyone worldwide and it was only with recent computer technologies was he able to create it. Tony made it public in the 80s, not long after the birth of the personal computer, but it didn’t make an impact until the 90s when the computers were made more consumer friendly and internet was finally making an impact on the everyday person’s life.
When he was a kid, the idea that man could go to the moon had been ludicrous and further than that? Science Fiction.
Due to his momentum, Peter wouldn't have been able to dodge the move, even with his Spidey-Sense, but he didn't need his sense. He had Venom.
Steve adjusted to his era with ease and became an essential part of what was growing into their strange, little family.
Arm-in-arm, Steve and Tony stepped away from the door and the other two kept in step with them. As they stepped into the crowd, Tony murmured, “Winner gets to sit out on the next Avengers press meeting.”
Eddie nodded and they both reached out to the test tube tray. Two test tubes sat there, each holding respective samples of their DNA.
“Maybe it’s his way of dealing what’s happening to him,” Steve glumly surmised. “If he dies, he knows you’ll be the one I turn to for comfort…”
“Sam has everything to do with this,” Tony stated, his frown growing deeper and his eyes adverted to the side.
Tony was leaning against the wall across from Steve’s door, wearing the same shirt and jeans he had left him in.
Natasha nodded and said, “There’s blood down there but I don’t know whose it is. It could be this guy’s, the Winter Soldier’s, or Steve’s.”
Tony ran his fingers along the panes of Steve’s muscles and traced the familiar paths that he had ingrained into his very psyche. He could easily picture this back if he closed his eyes and, if he had the artistic skill, could sculpt it perfectly from memory.
Mary waved her free hand for silence and Bruce complied. Mary stated, “Show me and then let me show you how we created the symbiote.”
Grinning, Steve said his thanks and ran over to the gift shop. It was overfilled with every souvenir imaginable. He found some cheap black flip-flops stamped with Hollywood that were his size. It took Steve a few minutes to look through it all, but he found the map he needed. It was in a large, glossy booklet and, thank God, Tony’s house was listed on there.
Steve instantly turned around and threw his arms around Tony. He buried his face into his boyfriend’s shoulder, trying to get a hold of the bile rising in his throat.
Tony cupped his jaw and murmured, “I know…I think it’s hilarious though because it’s just us, our relationship, it’s cliché but I love it.”
The elevator door slid open and Steve stepped inside. He turned back around to see Tony peering at him particularly.
Eventually, Steve drew himself out of Tony’s hold and turned to him as he rubbed the moisture from his eyes. Tony did not totally release Steve from his embrace and kept his hands on Steve’s biceps. He rubbed at his arms reassuringly. Steve grasped one of his hands and pressed it into his arm, curling his fingers around Tony’s hands.
Despite his reasoning, the guilt would not abate and a strange pressure began to build in his chest.
He was a fast swimmer and cut through the cold water at Olympic speeds. It was early June and people were on shore, sunbathing or playing in the surf, and they all stared at him as he walked out of the ocean fully clothed. The bathing suits for both the men and women were scandalous and Steve avoided looking at any of them as he scurried out of sight.
Wade and MJ were still gossiping on the couch, laughing at nearly every other thing the other would say; his dad was talking with Betty and Ned, probably grilling them on every little factor from his life in high school; and his fellow interns were playing pool with Clint, Bucky, and Steve…they didn’t stand a chance. Everyone was having a good time. There was no drama about who he was related to and there were no emergencies for the team to go running after. His best friend and his boyfriend liked each other. And his friends seemed fine with his superhero family.
“Okay,” she chuckled. “Did you pull another all-nighter? Bucky’s arm looks great, but you need to take care of yourself too, Tony. Help him move the clothes. I’ve got Chinese coming. It’ll be here in another twenty minutes and then you, mister, are going to bed.”
Wherever they were, as long as they were together, it was home…but his super soldier was ecstatic to be back in his home town and Tony was glad to have made that happen.
As more oxygen got into his blood, he was able to think clearer and Steve started to remember what had happened. Peter…Venom…Mary…they all came back to him and, in his last moments, he remembered a second of pain and then nothing…
Natasha received her implant in a ceremony, welcoming her into the Black Widow Training program for female sleeper agents.
“Did the Chameleon know what the guy was after?” Tony questioned tersely. His grip tightened around his coffee mug.
Steve rounded the corner and saw the Winter Solider already climbing up the side of the building. Desperate, Steve yelled out the one thing that got across to him prior, “Don’t go! It’s-It’s you and me till the end of the line, remember!?”
In his back vectors, he could see them turning and following. Usually, they'd be too slow to follow but they sadly probably knew exactly where he was going. He sighed to himself as he thought of his son. Peter wasn’t made for the lifestyle Tony lived but now he was going to be unwillingly thrust into it…
Tony’s entire frame jolted and he felt nauseated. His chest ached with a phantom tightness he hadn’t felt in years…ever since he had the reactor removed.
“Hey there yourself,” Steve replied. He leaned against the counter, clutching his own coffee, and asked, “Did you sleep last night?”
Bucky said nothing as they shared their passioned farewell. He just looked off to the side to give them their moment.
Venom was still groaning and time seemed to move infinitesimally slower as Brock nervously looked over the information.
He was surprised to find Bucky was actually at the spot. He expected for him to wait in the shadows until Steve got there and then sneak up on him. Yet Bucky was there, leaning against the railing and watching the boats go by just as they used to decades prior.
Norman had no idea how to help Venom but he promised the symbiote to help, only after it helped him tear down SHIELD HQ. If it died during the attempt then it would save Norman a lot of grief. This was the point of its existence and if it survived the attack Norman would consider it an ultimate success. Then maybe he would start considering ways to help the symbiote…
The night went by too quickly after that with a lot of laughing, dancing, and more kissing between him and Tony.
Mary broke her arm from the agent’s grip and hissed, “You can’t stop me. They won’t even know I was there.”
The rest of his family was always there for him and were always asking him how he was and what they could do to help.
“Ugh, babe, do not even imagine it. You’re making us sound old,” Tony groaned, leaning heavily into him.
Steve sighed heavily. They were working together and doing it alone but this is not how he imagined Part Four of Tony’s scheme to turn out.
Steve stared proudly at his son but his bottom lip trembled and, when he spoke, his voice shook. “You are
So the months flew by and one day Steve happened to look at the date and he realized their one year anniversary would be coming up…except he didn’t know which date to choose.
The teen behind the counter was openly staring at him and, with Tony’s excitement over the Iron Man bear. He probably recognized him at this point but Tony did not pay it much mind because there was a freaking bear of him made to look like his old Bucky Bear and Cap Bears!
He and Wade held hands automatically, like it was as normal as breathing. When Peter noticed this, he smiled happily at his boyfriend and murmured, “From now on I want end every birthday like this, with you.”
After he relayed all the information, Bruce wordlessly began to check his vitals and attached a number of electrodes to his forehead and chest. The machines around Bruce’s lab came to life and began to record Steve’s readings. Bruce remained at his side with his handheld machine that was getting readings off the Venom patches.
“I thought it best that the son of Captain America possess at least one reputable article of his father’s memorabilia,” Coulson stated, nodding his head forward to accept his thanks.
Pops was indestructible. He had survived being frozen in the artic for 70 years and no villain had ever been able to best him.
“Hey,” Tony said, grasping Steve’s forearm. Steve twitched and then looked at him questionably, Steve’s gaze still stoic and uncertain. Tony murmured, “It’s all going to be alright, Steve. These guys are going to help us out.”
“No, really, Tony. Thank you, for everything. Between the lawyers and the advice…even warning me…thank you. I don’t know what I would have done without you.”
Steve looked down at Tony and lightly ran his fingers through the time traveler’s hair. Steve whispered, “He tossed and turned all night. He finally settled down a few hours ago…”
Maneuvering Tony into a wheelchair involved a lot of frustration and questioning everyone’s intelligence, especially when Jarvis informed him Steve arrived at the hospital, but they eventually got him settled.
Steve rolled his eyes, flushing slightly. Apparently, Steve had a super dick along with super strength.
,” Dad gasped painfully. Dad cupped Peter’s face and when their eyes met he whispered, “I would never do that. I scanned him as soon as I found him. I couldn’t believe it myself!
So, after he dried off his hands, Steve faced his husband. Tony squared his shoulders, expecting the argument to ensue, but, instead, Steve embraced him. Tony tensed for a second then relaxed into his hold and returned the hug.
“Peter?” Steve gasped. Bruce was babysitting him in his lab as the rest of them went to check out the bank robbery. Thor and Clint were not in the building.
Steve paused before answering because he wasn’t really sure how to explain everything to his teammate. He didn’t even know how to define what he shared with Tony…
This very well may be the last time Steve would see his and Tony’s son and he wanted to hold onto the moment for as long as he could…because Peter was the future he and Tony should have…not this.
Truth be told I already decided the ending to Part 3 and just asked to see your opinions of what could happen and my oh my, are y'all verbal!
“At least he's keeping himself busy with non-Wade things,” Peter murmured more to himself. Steve overheard him and chuckled lightly.
He could have sworn he saw hurt and conflict in Steve’s for a moment but it all disappeared in a blink and Steve roughly whispered, “As long as you’re in my arms and you’re happy…then I’m happy.”
“Don’t curse in front of him,” Steve stated with a heavy sigh. With Clint and Tony he knew he was going to be saying this a lot.
It was Pepper who took center stage and the Avengers finally turned on the television to watch her speech.
Steve sighed and murmured, “I am a different man now. That Steve kept his true self a secret and bottled everything up…Tony…Tony drew me out.”
At that moment, Natasha knew she would never rest until the monster was dead and his organization with him.
The elevator shuddered slightly when it stopped and Steve inhaled deeply to settle his flaring emotions then stepped out.
Peter was no longer the pudgy toddler the rest of the world saw him as. His son had grown and was a small child now, standing as high as Steve’s hip with long thin legs that no longer toddled but strode confidently.
Steve rolled his eyes and slipped away from Tony, overdramatically sighing, “And here I thought you’d sweep me off my feet again.”
“He’s a celebrity,” he replied with a shrug. “When I went to Hollywood for business, they were selling maps of stars’ homes nearly on every other corner, his home was probably one of them. I bet we can find the same information online.”
And then Pepper came across DUM-E and Butterfingers trying to dismantle the suit off of him and well...it didn't go well. Especially after she noted the bullet holes in his armor.
Ultimately, they made out like a couple of horny teens, wildly kissing and groping each other like it was their last day on Earth. When they finally broke apart they laughed, blushed, and irrevocably kissed again. The second time they kissed was more slow and tender. Wade’s fingers caressed the side of his face in a feather light touch and he smiled warmly at Peter when they slowed to a stop.
Steve felt his heart leap into his throat as the timer changed to under fifteen minutes right before his eyes.
Peter hadn’t played that game, nonetheless any game, since before Venom. He had not done anything normal or what constituted as “fun” in the same amount of time.
Ben nodded, his face was awash with pain but it was a dampened pain. The older man explained, “We always assumed they were dead. We filled a missing persons report for both of them but…I always hoped…” He paused then rubbed his hand across his lower jaw. He asked, “Why did it take so long for us to get word?”
Steve spun around and should not have felt so surprised to see she had jimmied the lock and slipped in while he was out.
Steve gulped as he imagined kissing this man. It would be so easy to do and, days prior, it was have only been a dirty secret but now it was a possibility. Steve gulped again as he corrected himself. No it was not a possibility. It was a certainty. Tony wanted to have the paparazzi catch them in a kiss. It was going to happen. The only question was…When?
He was in the helicarrier. Tony lay at his side, dying and not responding to Steve’s touches, and Bucky hovered over him, pointing the gun at his head.
Steve went over to him and gathered Peter in his arms and held him tightly against his chest. He did not answer him at first. He waited those 2.6 minutes, waiting, hoping Tony would miraculously appear. He counted out every second and his eyes were locked on the screen, searching the damaged remains of the house with the news crews for any sign of Tony. He tried redialing the number but was told the number was disconnected. He tried again, several times, before giving up.
Tony glanced at his husband and saw Steve smiling warmly at him and Tony knew he was thinking the same thing he was…They’d all had survived. They all were going to experience another of Peter’s birthdays. Life seemed better with that knowledge. He’d been taking it for granted until he nearly lost it all.
Since the Winter Soldier had survived, he assumed that maybe a tiny portion of the organization survived. He was expecting maybe a few dozen people…
“What she said,” Tony sarcastically stated. He held up his club soda and asked, “You want a drink, the ladies make a mean cocktail?”
Steve soon discovered, the bruises along Tony’s arms were actually newly implanted honing chips for Tony’s new armor. He spent most of his time trying to summon the armor to him with simple arm movements. The armor came to him but it was usually too fast and forceful. Peter loved to watch the armor fly through the air and laughed as it sporadically attached itself to Tony. Steve usually watched it all with a frown and tended Tony’s bruises and cuts afterwards with the frown still in place.
Steve nervously watched the entrance to the bus depot but none of those dark cars drove into the parking lot bearing Hydra agents.
“Captain, a lot has happened since yesterday,” Coulson stated. “The entire world knows about Peter now and everyone wants to know about him. They also want to know about Sergeant Barnes. They want to know how he is still alive but also what…the extent of your relationship was…and is… Frankly, I was wondering if you could tell me that as well. How long have you been in contact with the Winter Soldier? How long have the two of you been in a relationship?”
Steve’s brows pinched together and he rounded  Tony to stand before him. He stopped him by grasping his arms and Tony swayed a little. Steve demanded, “What did you say?”
They all piled back into the quinjet and Sam, being a former paramedic, checked Steve over and gave him a cold compress. Bucky sat next to him and fretted like he always did when it came to Steve. Steve demanded the same treatment in turn and Sam looked over Bucky next. He'd received burns similar to Steve from when he had used the infinity stones but his injuries seemed much older than Steve's and were further long in the healing process.
They went around a corner and saw the prone bodies as they approached but, they could not tell them friend from foe due to the dark. There were two bodies however and the size and shape fit Steve and Tony’s definitions.
There was nothing he could do for Steve now, but he could get the tesseract and save Tony’s life in the least.
Steve’s eyes trailed over to the windshield just as the plane broke through the last of the clouds. The ground was fast approaching and he gently asked, “Will you be there for me in the end?”
Within the portal, the nuclear blast went off, destroying the ship within and the Chitauri on Earth fell all around them.
Steve wanted to do so much but pushed back all that he desired. That desire dwindled and died as Steve’s mind fell back to Tony.
From the corner of his eye, Steve noted a small smirk grace the lawyer’s mouth and Marcel murmured, “You are welcome to try either way.”
Steve didn’t realize how true Fury’s words about Tony were until the day his timer was going to go off. It was the same day the Avengers were called to action and Tony assisted.
As he was removing the pillow cases from the pillows, Tony called out to him, “Are you going to help me scrub my back or keep napping?”
They got stuck in traffic for the drop-off zone until finally, Happy announced, “We’re next in line.”
The kaleidoscope of colors faded and Steve could feel his conscious leaking from him as quickly as his blood seeped out of his body through the great crater in his upper torso.
“What’s with you two and the obsession with my chest? Do you two find that most attractive in a man or something?
“Moving on,” Tony quickly interceded. He’ll bug Coulson about Point Break and his Terminator-wannabe another day. Instead, he inquired, “Have you found any of my dad’s old stuff yet? I sent in my third request for it weeks ago.” Tony stopped tossing around the gauntlet and walked over to the spread out of documents over his work table.
Tony continued, “I’m self-destructive while you are this kind, wholesome person engineered to be perfect. On top of that I’m vain, I’m an alcoholic, I’m nearly twice your age, I dedicate more time to my inventions than people, and –.”
They sat down together to watch an inane reality show that had nothing to do with either of them nor the trial. They cuddled and joked about the state of the human race as they watched the overdramatized and petty bickering. Yet their jesting all came to an end when the priority alarm went off.
,” Tony gasped his name like it was a fervent prayer. He grasped Steve’s legs with trembling hands and pushed his legs up and open, totally exposing Steve to him. Steve flushed as Tony positioned himself between his legs. The hard length of his erection brushed against his thigh and Steve’s gut clenched. It was so erotic with his legs spread open wide and Tony being able to see all of he felt sinfully wanton. It was wrong and right all at once. Steve was already gasping shallowly trying to catch his breath.
He had two nurses: one pushed him and the other pushed the pole with the IV bags on it. Bruce followed close behind and watched Tony with a critical eye, looking for any sigh that he needed to be returned to bed.
“What can we do?” Steve gasped. They could not find Tony, they could not find Pepper…Were all they going to do was sit at the Tower, twiddling their thumbs until this was all over?
Tony sighed contently and nuzzled his face back against Steve’s neck. They laid there in the warm water for several minutes. Steve’s fingers drew light circles into Tony’s back and Tony just melted into him as content as could be.
Until one day, they were on the way to meet up with some of Solo’s friends when something caught Steve’s eye. They were walking through the city, crossing the tourist zone to get to their less reputable area, when Steve saw the name “Stark.”
Tony stumbled back a few feet and instantly shuffled back into his personal space but he made no attempt to kiss Steve again. Steve pressed himself into the rounded wall of the plane to get any type of distance between them.
Tony chuckled and nestled his face into Steve’s chest. His voice still scratchy, Tony said, “Come back to bed…I want to cuddle.”
Jarvis was rattling off the data SHIELD had provided him about Thor but Tony was only half listening. The majority of his attention was focused on the swing of the giant’s hammer.
Tony had refused to call his father “dad” as a young adult and, as they were interacting, the name came out from habit.
Steve’s mortification stooped to new heights and he felt his flush return, burning hotter than before. If they watched the video from his room…what if they saw him –
Steve was sitting at the counter with a platter of breakfast food in front of him and he was holding an open newspaper in one hand. Yet, the super solder’s attention was fully on Peter when he asked, “So, how was dad while I was out?”
It was at that moment, Tony turned to his boyfriend and was happy to see him finally looking content. Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s broad back and tipped his head against his shoulder. Steve rested his head on top of Tony and sighed happily.
“Steven Grant Rogers and James Buchanan Barnes,” she stated in return. “Two boys from Brooklyn. You grew up together, fought together, and nearly died together. Steve did not want to fight you, remember?”
The team was loud and trading stories which led to Clint and Natasha talking about Budapest as they ate. Natasha was smiling at the story while Clint groaned and shook his head. They both contributed to the tale that was sounding more dubious by the second.
This was bad. Tony had barely touched him and hadn’t even kissed the man yet. He already wanted to consume him.
“Peter was making fun of my jokes,” Steve whined. The hard look instantly left Stark’s eyes as he smiled mischievously at his husband. The change was so quick Wade’s jaw nearly dropped. He knew there was another side to the man but, damn! He felt like he crawled into a Stony fanfiction and fluff was going to ensue. He couldn’t help but scoot forward to be as close to the action as possible.
“Coma,” Tony replied. “Doctors say it’s bad… God, Steve, it’s bad. It’s been bad overall. I can’t sleep anymore. I feel like…ugh, I’m not going to talk about it because I’ll just freak out again and if I have another panic attack in a hospital of all places these doctors will never leave me alone. Ugh. God, I hate this. Happy was only there because he was following this guy…He thought he was helping me… A freaking coma,” Tony gasped. “God, he’s a boxer – a fighter. He can’t go out like this…”
He was still crying but he smiled at her and looked on the verge of laughing as he shook his head and murmured, “No, I guess not. We always seem to end up together again anyways.”
He didn’t know what to do or how to react to the overt sexual move. He was still getting used to the fact that he was actively seeing a man now. He liked kissing Wade but he knew he wasn’t ready for sex yet. Wade was amazing but…Peter dropped his forehead onto Wade’s chest to hide his embarrassment and murmured, “Can…Can we take this slower?”
The American team was sending someone over to pick him up and from there he was going to get a ride back to the states.
If Rogers was willingly living on the streets, Tony doubted that he wanted to announce his presence to the world.
outside of this universe. Ultimately, he is the definition of a major flight risk. This is not even his era. He is from a different time and holds no connections to ours. In addition, there is countless video evidence of his use of violence against others. He is a menace to the public.” Steve felt his ire rising with every new hypocrisy.
“One of the guest rooms obviously,” Tony retorted. He opened the fridge and frowned at the contents. He asked, “Should we get pizza?”
Wade opened and closed his mouth a few times, grasping for the right words. Wade’s dad beat him and he barely remembered his mom. He had no relevant experience with parents, especially ones that loved their children. Peter’s situation was vastly different and had so many levels to its history. Should Wade do like in the movies and pat Peter’s back and deliver a moving speech that would move Peter so much that he would feel obligated to see his father? How in the hell would he accomplish that in the first place??
“Just like you handled all those scars on your torso?” Howard asked, cocking his eyebrow in question at where his shrapnel scars were hidden under his shirt. Tony paused on the top button and dropped his hands as he met his father’s overly inquisitive gaze. Howard quickly pressed, “If you tell me how they occur I can make sure it’ll never happ –.”
The other man laughed and said, “Alright, I’ll give you the back story to my name if you give me yours!”
MJ shot him a glare and then turned to Wade and embraced him without any warning. Wade immediately stiffened and MJ said, “It is nice to meet you Wade and thank you for being there for Peter when I couldn’t. I could tell the moment you entered his life because he sounded so much more happier.”
“Imagine it away?” Steve suggested and stepped forward to cross the little distance there was between him and his soulmate. Steve cupped his face and Tony leaned into his touch.
“We’ll go down to the private beach,” Pepper said to Tony and then, turning to Bucky, she explained, “You’ll like it. It’s in a cove so it’ll just be us.”
Another way the meeting was different was their topic of choice. Instead of focusing on Peter, they decided to focus on the three of them: Steve, Tony, and Mary. They thought it best to mend broken bridges and create a relationship with Mary, especially if she really did want a part in Peter’s life.
One night, after listening to Steve and Bucky talk about their lives in Brooklyn for the dozenth time, an idea occurred to him.
He inhaled sharply and then gasped to catch his breath, clutching his chest tightly as it burned from the exertion.
Tony banged on the wall and screamed for Steve to let him in, but Steve ignored his cries. He pressed his forehead against the wall with gritted teeth and prayed Tony would change his mind tomorrow night.
Steve placed his hand over Tony’s and whispered, “I’m okay. I’m just on edge…” He tapped Tony’s hand against his chest and his eyes spanned the room, falling on the lawyers waiting on them, and he quietly repeated to reassure himself, “I’m okay…”
Tony closed his mouth as Steve ran the blade around his lips. He heard the grainy sound as numerous hairs were cut and was soon able to feel air on patches of skin that should have hair. Pep was going to so tease him
“There has to be another way! Just give me a few more days! Think of Tony! Think of Peter! Think of all of us! This will destroy everyone!”
Maybe once Tony started working with him, once he let him in on what Howard was doing, he would finally understand and not hate Howard as much. He prayed he could change this aspect of the future at least. He did
“And maybe if they spend some time together they’ll realize how much they care for each other,” Pepper murmured with exacerbation.
Steve didn't deny it. Truthfully, he wasn't sure what was the worst. People thinking he was omega or knowing he hadn't presented yet. Both were terribly embarrassing and at least, being omega gave him grounds to fight back. The truth would only confirm he was a freak.
two omegas. He bonded Steve. And he bonded James. He bonded them both. He thought he couldn't, that he would never be strong enough. He had never thought it would be possible. How can anyone bond two people? Bonding someone is so powerful and so overwhelming already.
She sighed, frowning a little. Her gentle eyes turned serious. She sat down in front of him again and cuddled his hands into hers. "Honey," she started with a slightly intransigent tone, her usual assertiveness that made Steve huddle on himself. "What's important is that you're happy with the person you love, baby. And that you make them happy and respect them. Always."
Steve looked pained but he helped him up on his feet without another word and Tony unexpectedly managed to stand up and walk, although his entire body hurt so much he felt numb.
"I've thought about a hundred of different ways to kill Iron Man already," Steve deadpanned, throwing an amused look at his boyfriend. "Those are just rumors."
Tony brushes his lips softy over his bonding gland and plants a kiss there. The omega shivers from head to toe, body pliant under Tony's hands. He pushes into the shower and takes a gratifying pleasure washing him thoroughly, removing the slick, the sex grime and the anxiety. They both spread lather on each other now as James feels more confident and legitimate around him. This moment of reconnection is so calm and tender between them, silent, like most of their interactions have always been.
"Kind of became a habit after that." Clint continued, encouraged by the twisted curiosity of his audience. "After each concert we needed to release some tension. I think the only times we didn't fight then were when we fucked."
Tony chuckled softly and wrapped his arms around. "I'm sorry..." He said softly. "I really didn't mean to do that but I can't seem to get my words through you otherwise." He smiled at Steve, brushing a hand to his face. "I love you." He finally whispered. So softly a sound Steve thought he had dreamt it. "We really need to stop doing this, though." He added.
Sam glanced at him and laughed. Then he ruffled his hand in his blond hair, an appreciative smile on his lips.
himself spit-roasted between the three of them. He's there but to there. He's here and everywhere and the orgasm hits him his waves, ripples through him intensely. It was wrenched out of him, beaten out of him and the moment he feels himself spurt inside the omega's ass—or he means
Steve parted his lips and tried to swallow the lump in his throat. He felt the tears trickle down his cheeks and wrapped himself around Tony's neck, hugging him into a strong and comforting embrace. "You don't have to tell me if you don't want to," he whispered. "We don't have to know everything about each other. But I'll be there for you and I'll listen to you if you ever wanna talk about it. Just, please, don't push me away! Don't pretend that everything is fine and drown your sorrows by yourself, and then tell me to go to sleep like nothing's happened... because I can't."
His heart didn't slow down. In fact, he could hear it beating in his chest. He could even feel it against his ribs. His breathing hitched as he stared at his slender back. Johann Schmidt and his goons all but forgotten.
His boyfriend was ruthless and if Steve was being honest, it turned him on but... there was something a little wrong about it. Something that lingered at the back of his head and pooled at the bottom of his stomach. Tony spat again, into Steve's ass, which made him gasp and shiver with want. Then he spat onto his own cock and spread it all around, smoothing the slide. Soon he was pounding hard and relentlessly into Steve, hand covering his mouth. Steve indulged in it at first. Each thrust sending spikes of electrifying pleasure in his entire body but then it became more pain than pleasure and Steve cringed and keened as he heard Tony's thighs smacking against his own after he had grabbed his waist with both hands for better leverage. Tony probably realized because at some point he mumbled an insincere "sorry" and slowed down, grabbing Steve's dick to make him come.
Tonight was a big deal and now that the euphoria surrounding the revelation of their relationship was finally starting to fade, it was time they made this new step. And it had been long overdue too.
Howard burst out laughing, arms still crossed on his chest. "And what plans of yours exactly are worth jeopardizing a three million dollars contract?"
They clink their glasses while staring at their respective lovers and drink a first swig. Tony is glad to have something in his hand again and he enjoys the bitter taste of his beer but something's missing.
Tony tugged on his hand, Steve was still in a daze. "There's still some time before class... come with?" He suggested with an expecting smile.
Tony went back to work silently and efficiently and stopped bothering him. Steve should have done that earlier, he thought, because they were finished in less than two hours and only Steve's bedroom remained now. They both headed there and Tony stretched his back and complained. Steve rolled his eyes and ignored him.
The brunet startled at the unexpected question and Steve felt the corners of his mouth unintentionally curl up at his confused face. It was really cute. The moment didn't last, sadly, and Tony regained his confidence. "Edward." He just said.
"I know you." Steve carried on. "And I know that something's been wrong since that party." Tony eyes flickered with pain, he looked away for a split second and looked back into Steve's eyes, looking miserable. "And it's killing me to see you like this..." Steve whispered in a shuddering breath. "I don't know what to do, and it's killing me. You keep saying that everything's fine when obviously you're not. And I
After a cold shower, Steve still had the sensation that his body was burning and he was still shivering. He took his temperature, it was just above normal but nothing catastrophic.  His head was spinning. He staggered back to his room, his knees wobbling and collapsed on the floor again with a sudden flash of heat spreading in his body. It was burning everywhere and his skin prickled and hitched and he wanted to tear it off and scratch it. He started wriggling and whining uglily on the floor before he finally got a grip on himself and climbed onto his bed, completely naked.
Steve climbed inside and took the drink, he needed it. He emptied it in one gulp and felt the alcohol rush to his head. A wave of warmth spread inside his entire body. Tony stared at him, smiling. He stared back, undressing him with his eyes. He felt a tremor in his jaw, a huge amount of self-control was needed not to crawl to him and strip him naked. Tony chuckled, staring at him sidelong, eyes glimmering wantonly in the dim light of the car. He was obviously having a great time messing with Steve.
"Which is more than half-an-hour from both our work places. I'm tired of commuting from there and besides, it's too small for both of us. What's wrong with here? You've got everything you need. It's better situated, more spacious and I..."
Except he swiveled, turning his back to him, and glided down the stool. He left and came back with two wine glasses and a bottle of red that Steve watched him open bemusedly, eyes lingering on the muscles of his naked arms, speechless. Steve was still bewildered when Tony handed him a glass with a mischievous smile. "To us." He whispered softly while holding his own glass to Steve and sipped a first swig, eyes never letting go of him. Then he took his fork and uttered a sexy "bon appetite" just before shoving a first mouthful in his mouth.
He paused, to catch his breath. "And, to be honest, I don't know if that was love or something else entirely. But from that moment on, my heart didn't stop racing and I felt breathless and couldn't take my eyes off him."
"I thought we agreed..."  Steve choked out, out of breath, feeling already defeated. Tony's stare was too powerful.
He thought again about the painting his boyfriend had offered him for his birthday. A portrait of him flying, insouciant,
Tony stared at him for a moment, unreadable, a glimpse of confusion in his eyes, and then his features softened. He smiled softly, beautifully. A bright and blissful smile that you could see mirrored in his eyes.
"It doesn't mean anything to you but I've always wanted to be able to live from my art and I needed a new place and I... You're
