Dean hung up the phone and rejoined Cas at the table.
“Well, what kind of jobs do you have open?” He asked. Crowley narrowed his eyes.
Dean stood in front of the table with the wedding cake and raised a glass. The wedding guests quieted down and gave him their attention.
“Well yeah, but that’s just one option. Remember when you found him married to that woman in Colorado? He could’ve been sent there, a place he had a strong emotional connection to.”
Charlie passed the plate of burgers to Cas.
Dean tightened his grip on his spoon.
“If anyone deserves to relax, it’s me and Cas. It’s much harder to work a 9 to 5 than it is to do housework. Maybe we should make a wager to settle this matter once and for all,” Eileen said from the kitchen chair next to Sam. Her hair was in an updo, with curls tightly pinned into place. She had a string of pearls and a dark dress with a sweetheart neckline. Cas hadn’t noticed her either. He glanced down at his plate. Maybe he needed to eat something.
“Don’t be mad you put money on December. It was never gonna happen in winter. Too many layers.”
“I knew they hooked up this whole time, and I never said anything.” Charlie said smugly, “I’m great at secrets. This is exactly why Cas told me he applied to Stanford.”
Bobby made chili for dinner. By the time Dean got home and changed, dinner was served.
“You have another brother?” Malia asked.
“Yeah. I’m glad you’re not actually 80.”
“I said it’s okay to be gay, and that I support him,” Cas said, devastated.
Finally. He could get to work.
He hurt his baby.
Sam felt a rush of relief. He figured it must be because Dean was going to get them a job, and Sam wanted to win the bet. That would be such a relief.
“That’s it,” Dean pushed open the door and told Cas, “I’m changing.”
They both froze, equally surprised. He’d never had a problem with Dean’s one night stands before, but apparently bitterness was a side effect of last night’s revelation. He felt awful. He wanted to apologize. But Dean spoke before he could.
He sat on the hood of the impala and stared at the rock.
“—fine, fine, I promise. But wait, don’t just—” Sam said.
“He’s stronger than we thought… What happened next?” the voice asked.
When they finally sat down to breakfast, the eggs had gone cold. Neither of them minded.
Cas knew Dean wouldn’t tell anyone. No matter how disgusted he was by Cas, he said he wouldn’t tell and Dean kept his promises. The thought should have made him feel better, but somehow he felt worse.
“Let me guess, your favorite is her early country stuff?”
Cas’s relationship with Claire was, to put it simply, complicated, but he’d always cared for Claire as a daughter. He completely trusted her, and he hoped by now she trusted him. Perhaps that’s why he found this news particularly shocking.
On the other side of the rock was a room on fire. Dean felt like he was back in Hell. He looked over the pitchforks and brimstone, searching for any sign of Cas. He avoided the flames, and the falling pieces of burning coal, until he finally found a doorway. He ran to it and then skidded to a stop. On the other side of the door was a long staircase leading down.
“Go away,
Sam jumped and flipped the light switch.
He’d come to terms with his bisexuality sophomore year of college, when he left Cas and moved in with a guy named Benny. They quickly started a roommates-with-benefits situation. But he didn’t exactly go around telling people, not even Cas. He didn’t want anyone to think of him differently, even though he knew they would support him, whatever. It was just something he’d rather not talk about.
“Okay, fine. We got into a fight about your birthday party. I wanted to get three cheap strippers, but he wanted one expensive-ass stripper—”
“You’re pathetic, and you know what? That’s why you’re alone. You’re pathetic and scared to honestly tell people how you feel.”
“When?”
Sam and Dean looked at each other.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean snorted and dumped the eggs on a plate. “You seriously never suspected? I thought I was pretty obvious.”
“It is perfectly fine to be gay.”
Dean paused. Gabriel looked serious. But this had to be some new, weird joke that didn’t have a punchline yet.
“Yeah, really,” Dean glanced at him, “We need champagne. Next week Sammy graduates. And then next year, he starts law school. You know, Stanford Law School. At Stanford. That’s in California. You know how long that drive is? 23 hours.”
“Casual.”
“If you want me to,” Cas said, uncertain.
Cas turned to Jo, “I’d rather be a werewolf. Vampires live forever and that sounds horrible.”
“What are you doing?” Cas asked. Jack paled at Cas’s furious tone. He looked from Cas to Dean to Cas.
He didn’t know how to fix it. After a few days, he wasn’t even angry. He was scared. What if the next time he saw Dean, he blurted out his feelings? What if Dean could just read it on his face? What if Dean was dating someone? What if he realized Cas had been holding him back all these years and now he was happier than ever with a hot girlfriend and three cars?
After an hour on the dance floor, Cas grabbed Dean’s hand and lead him to the relative quiet of the front yard. There weren’t any string lights out there, but a few fireflies flew in circles through the warm summer air.
“This is Jack,” Cas explained, “Well, the human parts of him. When Jack brought me back, he left me with this child.”
Sam opened his mouth, but before he could respond, Dean lunged forward to grab a wayward piece of chocolate that had somehow gotten past them.
Dean couldn’t believe Jack bought that line. Did he really think Cas spent time befriending civilians over beer pong? Jack picked up the menu in front of him but continued to study Chad over the edge. Maybe Dean should’ve made him watch Animal House. It’d be less of a culture shock.
“Yes, you should,” Cas darted his eyes to Dean.
Holy crap, he was in love with Cas.
“And then you lied to me,” Jack stood, louder now, fists clenched tight.
The radio was still busted but Carry On my Wayward Son was blasting from somewhere as Dean kissed his baby goodbye. The key was in the ignition and the impala was 20 feet from the cliff. He put it into drive and dropped the big brick on the gas pedal. The impala took off, straight toward the rocky cliff.
He raced to the kitchen, but Sam wasn’t there. He headed to the library next, but heard Sam before he saw him.
Dean and Cas showed up at the Novak’s for Gabriel’s Fancy Ass Dinner Party (as the Facebook event was called). Gabriel greeted them at the door holding a martini and wearing a tux.
“Great idea,” Cas happily got out of the booth, “I’m sure Jack and Chad have much to discuss alone. I believe this could be the start of a wonderful relationship.”
“You don’t need the crap in these books. What did you say when he told you?”
Most of the time.
“Well, actually, about Stanford—” Cas looked down at the table and raised his eyebrows. Gabriel spoke up first.
“I think Cas might’ve been sent to a place that was important to him somehow,” Sam theorized, as they walked inside, “Like the warehouse where he first appeared to you, or the Idaho Gas-N-Sip, or the—”
“Jack helped.”
Sam’s eyes lit up, “That’s great. You’d love California. If you stop by Stanford, Eileen and I could give you a tour.”
“Dean, this is bad. This is just like the TV land Gabriel trapped us years ago. Do you think it could be him? What’s the last thing you remember?”
“I’m not into blind dates.”
“He needs a good father,” Cas corrected. “And I tried Dean, very hard, but. . . I can’t be that for him. I’m incapable. You were right. I was subconsciously imitating my own father. Maybe that’s why he left us all those years ago. He knew he would do more damage if he stayed.”
He prayed to Cas again that night. Then he prayed to Jack. And Gabriel. Everyone and anyone he could think of.
“I didn’t tell you I was gay because I knew it would bother you.”
Why did Dean think he could handle this? He wasn’t made for serious relationships. He wanted to date Cas, but it was more important to make him happy. He wouldn’t be happy with Dean for long. No one was. Cas had to go to Stanford.
Dean drove into Sioux Falls, not even sure where he was going.
“Best. Idea. Ever,” Dean said with a mouthful of pie in the drivers seat. Outside the car, Shannon played an AC/DC song from her phone, Kelly held a cute dog, and Logan and Malia searched the trunk of the impala for anything else that might help.
“Damn, that’s so sexy.”
“No,” Cas said, again. He took a deep breath, “She wants you to call her for personal reasons. She likes you and wants you to ask her on romantic date.”
He stared at the ceiling, wide awake.
Dean picked up his jacket.
“Maybe I should pray to Jack. . .” Dean trailed off. Maybe he should pray to Jack. What if Jack had brought Cas back as a human? Maybe something happened to him in the Empty, something even Jack couldn’t completely fix. What if Cas was half dead on the side of the road somewhere, human and vulnerable?
Dean looked at Cas, trying to understand. Cas looked to the side, and Dean followed his gaze.
“You know where he is?”
“Really?”
“No,” Dean finally found his voice, “Cas, you’re wrong. I return your feelings.”
Suddenly the kitchen door was thrown open, and Sam and Eileen stormed into the room.
And now, Cas stood alone in their living room. He let his head drop to his hands.
With his free hand Dean reached for Cas’s chin. He titled his face up, so they could look each other in the eyes.
The kitchen was empty. Thank God.
They drove around. Sam was right, it was a stupid idea. Dean basically drove in a 70-mile circle around the Bunker. He wanted to keep close, because every so often he would drive back to see if Cas had shown up yet. They drove by hospitals, hotels, and homeless shelters. Sam stayed in the car, researching, while Dean went in to ask questions.
“After you,” Cas clenched his jaw and held open the door.
“Let’s just say, Cas played matchmaker, and Jack wasn’t happy about it.”
Sam raised his eyebrows. Dean shrugged like,
Unless Cas liked him back.
He, Dean, slept with Cas.
*disclaimer* I took some creative liberties with the politics of heaven.
“I…” he started, but he didn’t know how to finish.
“I actually prefer 1989,” Dean said through gritted teeth.
“Yeah, that’s probably above Barbara Crane’s paygrade,” Dean said. Cas still looked dejected. Dean cleared his throat.
Cas cleared his throat.
“Eileen—” Sam shouted, frustrated, following her out the front door.
“Great,” Sam said, already lacing up his running shoes, “I might be back pretty late.”
Sam set the cup down.
“What?”
“I don’t want to hear your excuses. I know being my father is difficult. I know I’m not normal— but I didn’t know how much you wish I was. That’s why you hired that normal human to date me, right? Because if you had a normal child, they’d be dating and going to college and you wouldn’t have to waste your time teaching them to be human like everybody else.” Jack took a deep breath, but it sounded shaky, “I’m sorry that I can’t be normal. I’m sorry I can’t be the child you want.”
“I tried, Dean. The important thing is I put breakfast on the table. I upheld my end of the bargain. Have you found a job yet?”
She started to smile. Jack’s smile was very infectious.
Months went by. Shannon invited Sam over for dinner most nights, and though Shannon was an excellent cook, Sam insisted they trade off. He’d pick Henry up from school when Shannon had late meetings. Shannon started coming by the Bunker on weekends. She and Sam would go running in the morning, and Logan, Malia, and Kelly would watch Henry. At first Malia refused to help, since kids kind of freaked her out, but Henry was pretty cool. She taught him basic self-defense, modified for a toddler, and Kelly captured the cuteness with a million pictures.
Cas regretted it as soon as the stupid words left his mouth. Maybe it wasn’t too late to patch things up. He could go apologize to Dean and then maybe things would go back to the way they were.
In the second-floor landing, there was a man all in black with a skeleton mask. He had a woman, Shannon, in his arms, her neck poised to drink. Dean shot him swiftly through the head, and he fell to the ground, taking a shocked Shannon with him. Dean reloaded the gun, but he was slower than normal since he still had the artifact in one hand.
“Whoa, Cas, that’s, uh. . . I was thinkin’ this could be casual.”
They had all three pieces. Sam had seven different books open on the table in front of him, as he needed to read all of them simultaneously to get a real understanding of the ritual. His research was held together with sticky notes and red string, but he finally pieced together what he needed to do.
He spotted Cas instantly.
“I thought about it,” Dean’s voice broke. Sam was shocked, “If he’s still in the Empty...I would do anything to save him. I’m so fucking worried about him. But first we have to try everything else.”
“Where are you going— are you mad at me or something?”
Cas put a hand on Dean’s. “Are you sure? I don’t want to pressure you if you’re not ready. And this is very last minute— we’d probably have to drive down tonight. We could wait. Maybe we should.”
“Then why isn’t it working?”
Cas ordered a latte for himself, while Jack took his time reading the chalkboard menu above the cashier’s head. The cashier was a teenage girl with bright pink hair that stood out against her black clothes and apron.
The audience laughed.
“Hey,” Chad titled his chin in greeting.
“Uh, yeah. We have. Why?”
Dean and Cas were silent.
“What did he tell you?”
Cas trailed off when he saw the shiny new television set on the kitchen counter. It was 16 by 16 inches. The most expensive set on the market.
“I—” Cas took a step back. Dean took a step forward.
Dean started to leave. Bobby shifted in his chair and said,
“So, Chad was just telling me he was looking for a boyfriend.”
Honestly, Jack didn’t seem too eager to devour worlds. Castiel and Dean seemed cool, too. Chadiel stopped that line of thinking. He’d trained for this mission for years, and to prepare himself for life in this vessel, he’d been raised on American college movies. He couldn’t let his guard down around Dean just because he had an appreciation for humans. He would not fail Heaven the way Castiel had.
Sam glanced toward the kitchen. If Dean caught them gossiping, he’d be pissed the rest of the night, but Dean was still in front of the grill.
“When did that happened?”
“Jack is upset about something,” she signed. Cas took a deep breath.
Cas studied Frankie with new interest. Another thing he hadn’t known about Jack’s life. He needed Claire’s help more than he thought.
“Sam…Sam, go on without me.”
Dean grabbed the scraps of paper and threw them away.
“Hey, why’d you—”
“And you’ll need mine as well.”
“I want you to be happy, too,” Cas said, “Why can’t we try to be happy together?”
Sam and Eileen shared a glance. They had wondered why Dean and Cas made such a last-minute visit. They normally called ahead of time, until it was something urgent, something like a case.
Dean and Cas stepped back into the Impala.
“You said you think you love me. But you’re not used to sex without feelings. Sometimes you sleep with a friend to see what it’s like. Remember my roommate Benny? We hooked up for months.”
Sam stood in front of their “team”. Dean sat at the kitchen table, eyes narrowed and arms folded. Sam said something about the need for backup, but Dean saw through that. Sam wanted unpaid labor. He wanted interns.
He wished they were driving at night. He wished Sam couldn’t see his face. He glanced in the rearview, and it was just as he thought. He looked tired and pathetic and stretched thin.
“Oh. Maybe I’ll go to Jody’s for dinner.”
“If you want to call her, you should,” Cas said, perfectly casual. And just to prove how fine everything was, he took a long sip of his latte.
“I thought you’d tell her on Valentines Day,” Logan explained.
Dean looked up at him, right as he popped the bottle. The cork flew like a bullet, and half the bottle exploded after it like a fire hose.
Cas took a second.
“You know, Eileen is always nagging my ear off about money,” Sam leaned back in his chair, “She’s always saying I shop too much. She just doesn’t get how hard it is to do housework all day. Shopping helps me relax.”
“I tried a lot of new things when I was a human.”
“Because,” Dean sputtered, “Because it changes everything.”
“Yeah.”
“For the best? What the hell are you talking about?”
Dean realized something was wrong.
“Every kid deserves that,” Dean mumbled. He looked up, but his thumb didn’t stop moving, “That’s what you were trying to do for Jack. And sure, you tried way too hard, but better than not trying at all. That’s why— I mean, why I brought that story up. . . you shouldn’t say you’re a horrible father. You’re not. Jack’s a lucky kid.”
“What’s—”
“I don’t know. I’ll tell you later. I have to think about it first.”
But this was a six-hour car ride.
Dean stared at his plate. Three slices?
Dean’s casual tone started to infuriate him.
“There’s a possible case in Pittsburg.”
“When the Leviathans were after us, and you walked into that lake and died,” Dean said, without hesitation. “I found your trench coat, just floating, and that was when I realized.”
Sam must’ve misinterpreted the expression on his face, because he immediately jumped into case-mode.
“Where is Jack? I need to speak to him.”
Claire started toward the living room, but Cas didn’t move.
Shannon apologized and stood to collect her son. Sam stood too, and went to grab the extra sugar in the kitchen. Shannon, holding Henry in her arms, followed him. Dean left, to either grab the interns or the candles.
“C’mon, he didn’t really mean that. . . yeah, he was upset, but you know, tonight could’ve been worse.”
Dean didn’t think about it.
The front door slammed closed.
Dean grunted and felt for his wound. His hand came away bloodstained. Dean closed his eyes and let out a shaky breath.
Cas felt like a huge weight was lifted off his chest. He was almost smiling. Moments before he was convinced he’d never smile again, convinced that he’d lost Jack for good.
“But I’m gay.”
Cas gave him a strange look, “What did Gabriel say to you?”
“I think we’ll both be fine in my room,” Sam grabbed his bag. Eileen nodded.
“Fuck you? Well said. How did you fail English 101?”
Dean jerked the bottle away, but it was too late. The cake was soaked, caving in on itself like a soggy pile of sugar.
“He didn’t tell me anything. Did he do something stupid?”
It didn’t happen often, but Cas loved learning new stories from Dean’s past, even when it broke his heart. Even when it made him want to raise John from the dead just to send him back to the grave, even when it made him wish he could’ve saved Dean sooner, from a different sort of hell.
“Nothing,” Dean said. “Nothing. I think.”
“200 what?”
“Well, that’s. . .” Dean finally settled on, “something. Uh, how does that work when you’re not actually human?”
“Hello, Dean.” The audience burst into applause and cheers. Dean turned and inhaled sharply.
“It’s not like that,” Cas said, frustrated, “which you would know if you had stayed.” Dean resisted an eyeroll and Cas continued, “She told me to show Jack I support him by showing my support for his partner.”
Well he was about to take a big chance, with his feeling for Cas, but that was a risk worth taking.
Sam shot Cas a look, “You promised you’d keep him sober until after his speech.”
“Hi,” Cas put down his book and squared his shoulders. Sam’s bright smile made him feel guilty. Sam had done nothing wrong, but ignoring Dean meant ignoring him too. “It’s good to see you again. How was your junior year?”
“Well, my brother and I should be going,” Dean said, turning his attention back to the students.
“if one single piece of candy gets past you, outta this room unwrapped.” She turned her raised hand into a fist, “You’re fired. Do I make myself clear?”
“It’s time to sing.” Anna said brightly, holding the cake with the lit candles.
this will officially have three chapters! chapter three will be up tomorrow :) :) and thanks to everyone who left kudos and commented, it really keeps me motivated <3
“What is sexuality like for angels?”
Dean picked up his menu and studied it. He’d rather memorize the milkshake selection than watch this painful season premiere of the bachelor.
“Jack needs you.”
“You know that you’re my brother.”
“Oh. You didn’t. . . So I just—”
“No.” Cas closed his eyes. He should’ve started this when he’d gotten a full eight hours. “It’s just, our schedules are so different now. I think it would make more sense if I went back to the dorms.”
“I get it, Bobby. Anyway, I gotta take care of those rain gutters. Those things are a damn fire hazard.”
Sam looked over at him. “I’m glad you’re back. Both of you.”
“No,” Dean choked.
Sam rolled his eyes.
“What?”
Dean shrugged, “I made a grocery run.”
Cas looked down. “Can’t you ask me another question?”
“Actually, can you have dinner here tonight? I’m bringing a guest I’d like you to meet.”
“I assumed,” was all Cas said. His expression turned cold.
“Nope,” Dean said, “Just haven’t met the right girl yet.”
They bickered, a lot, over stupid stuff like what to order for dinner and if they should rewatch Dr. Sexy or start a new show.
Sam looked uneasy. He turned toward Dean.
Inias knocked on Cas’ door with a secret smile. Cas smiled back and let him inside. He closed the door behind him and meant to lock it, but Inias was taking off his shirt, so the door was quickly forgotten.
“Or if not Lisa, why not someone else? It’s just one night of fun, who cares who it’s with? Why not go for Laura? Or Jo? Perhaps Anna? Maybe Gabriel would be interested.”
“Dean, this is what Claire advised me to do. After you left.”
The first was in sixth grade.
“Do we need more smelly candles? I can run to the store. Or we could have those interns do it. We need to fix the plate.”
“I read time in the Empty was different. Are you guys alright? Are you hurt? How did you get here?”
“We need to read through this material as soon as possible,” Sam said, putting a hand on one of four giant stacks of books. The three hunters were staring awe struck at Sam’s face. Sam patted the book stack awkwardly, “So. Maybe each of us could take a stack?”
The hunters arrived by nightfall. And they were way, way younger than Dean was expecting.
The question was like a punch to the gut. Cas couldn’t speak. Dean took a deep breath.
“So I could let her know if I liked my drink? That seems unnecessary. I could just walk back to the counter.”
“From my poetry class. You told him you were my boyfriend, even though you knew I liked him. Don’t worry, he believed you, but he still slept with me.”
“Are you happy, Cas?”
“No, of course not, you have bigger concerns.”
“You can sleep in the car.”
Cas must have printed this. And for some reason, he must have torn it into pieces and thrown it away.
Day three, Dean was pissed.
“I assure you that was not crap.”
Sam was staring at the door Ellen just used. A strange look on his face.
Cas tilted his head.
Cas felt his throat closing up. This was a different type of panic, one that occurred when he thought about Jack’s unique situation. What was Jack supposed to do? Juliet didn’t know that he was a man, but only a few years old, but also the anti-christ. How could Jack ever engage in a normal human romance?
“No.” Cas turned back, so he was facing away from Dean as he said, “I’m not going. You should leave.”
Cas watched the sunrise through their kitchen window. Dean came out of his room around 10, bitching about a hangover. Cas didn’t listen. He stared at Dean’s thin white t-shrit and boxers and the freckles on his arms and his hand around the refrigerator handle and he knew he loved him. How the hell was he supposed to deal with that?
Jack had never tried coffee before, so Cas decided today they would go to a coffee shop. Personally, Cas didn’t care for coffee. Once you had one liquid molecule, you’ve had them all, but still, it was fun to watch Jack experience something for the first time. Was that how the Winchesters used to think of him? Refreshingly naïve.
“Get dressed,” he said, “We’re going to go look for Cas.”
“No.” Cas said, “The barista wrote her personal number on your cup, hoping you would call her.”
“Sounds like that’s Jack’s business.”
“Of course,” Jack said but Cas didn’t believe him. He felt another twist of pain since apparently Jack had gotten used to lying to him.
Dean shook his hand and the deal was made. Cas didn’t let go, so neither did Dean.
“You didn’t answer my prayers.”
The radio knob could break through the rock, because it was something Dean loved. The Empty fed on happiness or some bullshit like that. The rock could only be destroyed by things that made him happy. That was fine. He needed Cas more than he needed his car.
Cas looked at him. Dean felt self conscious in the wrinkled clothes he’d worn to Gabriel’s. The longer Cas stayed silent, the surer Dean was. Cas liked him. Cas liked him
Something seemed to click for Sam, then. Like something he’d always wondered about had just been confirmed. He took a deep breath.
“I get to pick?”
“How did you not know? She’s been dating Kaia for, like, months.”
“Did he tell you what their fight was about?” Gabriel asked, “Because if my sweet, innocent brother is out there being taken advantage of, I think I deserve to know. And did it happen in April?”
“Dean,” Cas said alarmed.
“And if you’re going to blame me, pull over now. I’ll just walk home. I’m sure Sam will understand—”
“Raymond and Shannon Blight. They’re private collectors. And they bought a ‘piece of ancient Mayan sun disk’ from a charity auction in 2007. Sam. Sammy. Does this look right? The picture’s kind of blurry. Sam, wake up.”
A hand touched his shoulder and Sam swung with everything he had.
“Do you mean gory like embarrassing or gory like actual blood and guts?”
“In the garage. I thought we might keep them in case we ever needed three dozen hockey pucks.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean snapped back into the conversation.
“He didn’t cuss you out or start throwing shit…Parents and kids fight. It happens. Compared to the crap Dad and Sam used to scream at each other, that was practically a Father’s Day picnic.”
“You grew old,” Cas said.
There were some people Dean had expected to see that weren’t there. Bobby, his parents, some of the angels. Jack, in his infinite wisdom, hadn’t brought them back.
“Dean!” she squealed through the phone, “Oh my god. Sam was just catching me up. Sorry I didn’t call you guys sooner, I’ve just been getting used to life again in South Dakota. A bunch of us are at a bar right now, and Kevin is trying to pirate some movies—”
“Oh,” Jack said, once he realized Cas was waiting for his answer, “That must be difficult. Are you a hunter?”
“Son of a bitch,” Dean ducked, narrowly missing a crowbar to the face.
“How are you mad at me? I didn’t do anything. I should be mad at you!”
Cas sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose. Dean turned back to the stove top.
But first, he wanted to go back to the campus where he “ran into” Castiel. He’d find that blue haired guy and ask him for tips.
Claire moved into an apartment with Kaia, in the town nearest to the bunker. They were Cas and Dean’s go-to babysitters, and Jack loved them. Claire was basically his sister, but Cas and Claire never really talked about it. She didn’t call him Dad, but Dean hadn’t called Bobby ‘Dad’ either.
“Sounds like the Empty,” Dean said stiffly. He didn’t want to think about it.
“It was alright,” Malia said, trying to be tough while also crying.
“Bro, I got the anti-Christ to use his powers in front of me. He changed the molecular structure of a milkshake, several times in a row, just by touching it. Dude didn’t even seem tired.”
“I wanted to. And I want to, for the rest of my life. That’s my choice. That’s the ending I want, a life with the people I love. A life with you. For people like us, that’s rebellion. When the odds are stacked against you, the true rebellion is letting yourself be happy.”
“I’m being honest,” Dean lied. “You just don’t want to hear it. You walk around in a fantasy world where you only see what you want to see.”
“What’s going on?”
He looked up at the cloudy sky. Sure, he couldn’t see the stars, but that was fine. He would have many more nights on Earth to go star gazing. They wouldn’t call him back to Heaven until he completed the investigation. He knew if his boss had his way, he’d have Jack killed now, but nobody wanted to risk the wrath of Castiel.
“Dean,” Cas snapped, “I didn’t tell him anything.”
Cas opened his eyes. Dean was staring straight ahead, face tilted up to the sky.
Sam was transfixed, staring at the candy that was passing them by. Unwrapped. Ellen didn’t reappear. Nothing was happening. Nothing was wrong.
The next morning, Dean shuffled into the kitchen. It was too damn early, and he was up most the night reading. Maybe those ancient civilizations wouldn’t have died out if their books didn’t bore people to death. He rubbed a hand over his face, and grabbed the eggs from the fridge. He shuffled toward the stovetop and paused. The frying pan was covered in dried egg. The toaster went off behind him, and Dean jumped.
“Thanks.”
“Nothing,” Dean said, “because he was immediately sent to super hell, like he knew he would be. And now. . .”
“Our Jack who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name,” Dean said, trying to joke about it but sounding painfully genuine even to his own ears. Here, in the privacy of his bedroom, lit only by the small red dot on his alarm clock, he closed his eyes and allowed himself to ask the question he still couldn’t in front of Sam.
Cas stormed inside. He ran a hand through his hair and looked at his reflection in the silver pot hanging above the counter. He looked terrible, and not just because his reflection was distorted. He looked like he hadn’t slept in days.
“Well, I didn’t mean that.”
“Poop guy!” Henry popped out from underneath the table and ran at Dean. Dean ignored the kid and turned to Sam.
“Sorry I know how to have fun. Maybe if you didn’t think you were so much better than everyone, people would like you too.”
The drive to Sioux Falls was nice. The clouds gave way to blue skies and open fields melted into slightly greener open fields. Dean had never asked about the people he slept with before, and Cas kept waiting for him to bring it up again. But he didn’t.
“Thanks, Dean. For everything.”
It was surreal to hear this kind of acceptance coming from her father, even if it wasn’t really coming from him. Claire wasn’t closeted, hadn’t been for years, but maybe on some level, she tried to hide it from Cas the way she’d hidden it from Dad. She wished he could hear his angel now.
Dean dropped his gaze to their hands, entwined. Cas flushed and wondered if he should pull away. He got his answer when Dean’s started moving his thumb back and forth slowly against the back of his hand.
“Of course. I mean, you asked me to come before. It was on my calendar and everything. I mean, I didn’t know if you still wanted me to, but…”
“Oh my god, the Winchesters! You guys are so cool,” Kelly, a bubbly 21 year old Black woman squealed.
Cas told himself he was just overthinking things. He slept with his best friend last night, surely his brain was still processing. Maybe Dean was still processing, too. He’d never even talked about liking men before, so he probably had a lot more to process. He sat down at the table, and Dean finally looked at him. Cas smiled.
“Do you like sweet drinks?” She asked.
Dean stared. Barely remembering to breathe.
He dropped the plate on the table and slid into the last empty seat, next to Sam, and across from Cas.
A nice one-story house stood in a row of nearly identical houses. The grass was the perfect length, the tulips leading to the front porch were perfectly planted.
“Okay, fine, Dean I get it. I’ll stop asking. Dean. Dean, I burned those pictures years ago don’t even bother looking. Please.”
“I’m referring to the moment I laid hands on you in hell.”
“Farm full of haystacks and the kid goes for the shit,” Dean mumbled under his breath as they walked back to the car.
Cas stared at him intently as he poured a cup of joe.
“Why don’t you want to date me?” Cas asked, in a low voice.
“With what?” Jack tilted his head.
Dean finally gained control and pressed the gun to the vampire’s head. Another masked vampire appeared from the second bedroom. He had blood on his chin— Raymond’s blood— but as Dean shot the vampire underneath him, the other grabbed the plate and ran.
“I don’t mean to interrupt, but I need another book,” Dean stepped out of the hallway, and everyone turned, “since I’m the only one doing any freaking work around here.”
“Yeah, you too.”
“Whatever, yes, to all of it,” Dean said, getting back into the car, “Let’s just keep looking.”
“I have no idea why this is happening, but okay. Sure. Thanks, Cas.”
“I don’t have time to keep up with gossip, Dean.”
“I don’t know,” he smiled.
“What do you do?”
Cas lived with Charlie for the next two years. After they graduated, he moved back to Lawrence until he figured out what he wanted to do for grad school. He rented a small house on the edge of town with Dean and got a job as a high school English teacher. Dean worked as a mechanic at Bobby’s old shop.
He prayed again, because why not? Two prayers in one day seemed like a bad idea earlier, but now it was midnight and Dean was alone in his bedroom. Lots of people prayed before bed, it wouldn’t be weird or needy. He could even throw in a ‘now I lay me down to sleep’.
“Then why hasn’t Cas called?”
Dean was sleeping on the couch. Or at least he had been.
Dean and Sam were outside the bunker, with their supplies. Dean had been in a worse mood than usual, but Sam knew he was just nervous about the ritual. To be fair, Sam was too.
Dean’s brain short circuited. Cas’s smile grew. Dean cleared his throat and tried to remember what the hell they were talking about.
“I could heat up some quinoa,” Sam offered. Dean sent a pleading look to Eileen.
Then he looked at Jack.
“Before or after I shot you?”
That night, Sam drove himself and Shannon to their honeymoon in California, while Cas and Dean drove toward Chicago. Their cars were headed in different directions, but both would be back. And their family would only continue to grow.
Cas’s eyes widened.
Sam sat back in his seat. Green fields passed by their windows in a blur, and outside their windshield was nothing but bright blue sky and open road. Dean hated it.
“What?”
Jody broke the silence, and suddenly everyone was talking. The first thing Dean felt when he entered the bar was guilt. It was hard not to, seeing everyone they couldn’t save in one room. But as Jo wrapped him in a hug, and Missouri handed him a beer, he pushed his guilt away. They were all here, really here. Jack brought them back, gave them all a second chance at life. Things were okay. It was all smiles and excitement and people asking what happened since they died. Dean’s cheeks start to hurt from smiling too much.
“I don’t want to look for Jack. He doesn’t want to see me.”
“I would never lie to you,” Dean insisted. “I’m totally incompetent. I probably lost that business hundreds of dollars. Not exactly employee of the month material.”
Last night, everything was perfect.
“I meant the actual closet. Where the hell are we? Did you buy a house?”
Sam thought about it. Dean wanted to stop thinking about it, so he flipped the radio back on. Sam side eyed him.
Cas blinked.
“Home,” said Cas.
“I think we each learned a valuable lesson today,” Cas said. Then he lowered his eyes, a troubled crease appearing between his eyebrows. “Where are Sam and Eileen?”
“How could that have been worse?” Cas raised his head and stared out the windshield. It was too cloudy to see any stars. It made the car feel small, like a child’s toy abandoned in tall grass.
Cas and Charlie took the empty seats next to Eileen. Cas introduced Eileen and Charlie, and it turned out Eileen recognized the Celtic Thunder t-shirt Charlie was wearing. They fell into a conversation about their favorite Irish music, leaving Cas at the mercy of the rest of the table.
He hit some light traffic just as the buildings got taller and the lights got brighter.
That was the last thing she was expecting to hear, especially from the face of her goddamn dad. She wanted to snap back something, anything, but Cas kept talking.
“Wow,” She swallowed, then smiled at him, “You have a gift.”
“Is that why you’re here?”
“He didn’t kick me out, I wanted to leave. Why are we talking about me, when we have a beautiful guest? Eileen, what do you want to talk about?”
Cas opened the passenger door and slid inside.
“Is it true that you used to drink demon’s blood?” Malia asked.
Dean joined them in the stable, “That’s great, kid. Where is it?”
“Was that for tonight?” Cas asked slowly.
“Here’s my number too.”
“I know.” Jack gave him a strange look.
Dean couldn’t fucking do this. He stared straight ahead, but he could feel Sam next to him, staring at him with a stupid, sad expression. Maybe he shouldn’t have told him. An old fear tugged at his stomach and a voice whispered in his ear that this changed everything, that Sam was disgusted, that it was so wrong—
“It’s a big decision. It will change our lives.”
Dean pumped his fist. Then he cleared his throat and shuffled his feet.
Until he walked into the courtroom and saw Dean and Sam in the backrow.
“Well. I guess Cas explained the situation.”
Sam stared at his brother. They were in a pool of moonlight, shinning down through the gaps in the old wooden ceiling. Sam stepped closer, and watched Dean struggle to breathe.
“Hey,” he said, like he’d been expecting them. “Cas, listen, I tried to call you but—”
“You too," she signed, “Sorry about the rude awakening.”
Sam gestured for him to ‘wait’ and pulled out his phone. Dean tapped his fingers impatiently on the steering wheel. Sam suddenly smiled and started talking animatedly. Dean jumped out of the car, wondering who the hell Sam was talking to.
And then they were mad at each other for two long weeks. Cas ignored him at school. Dean didn’t call or text. Cas felt like shit, but he told himself it was good that this happened now. He didn’t want to waste time on a so-called friend that wouldn’t accept him for who he is. He nearly managed to convince himself, except at night when he laid in bed wide awake and imagined scenarios where Dean came crawling back with a changed attitude and tearful apology.
A few papercuts and more than a few cups of coffee later, dinner was served.
“Cas never tells us anything. Is he okay?” Anna asked. Charlie glanced at Cas, wondering how she should reply.
“Not yet. I wanted to wait until after his speech.”
“I just wanted to give ‘em some space. C’mon, you’re a smart kid. You really think they’ll be comin’ back here tonight?”
“Dude,” Sam said sharply. Cas’s expression darkened.
As soon as Sam finished patching up Dean, they started looking for the kid. Eventually they found him, hiding behind a hay stack in the horses stable. With a horse. Dean leaned against the door outside to avoid the smell of horse shit, while Sam gently tried to coax the kid to come out.
“I’m sorry. I’m glad I got to meet you, but I have to go. I have to, uh, go make some copies. Right now. Yes. I wish we could talk longer, but maybe we could go to dinner tomorrow, just the three of us.”
“Like I slept with you?”
“Cas? Hey. Where are you, man? If you’re with Jack or taking care of heaven shit, that’s cool. Just— Do you need a ride or something? I know you know my number. Uh. . .”
“Dean.” Sam said softly. “No. You’re going to be okay. You have to be okay.”
The impala was never silent. The air vents rattled. The radio was usually on, though now it was turned down to a dull hum. Cas’s window was cracked opened and he could hear the rush of the wind as they drove down the highway.
Until this one.
Dean adjusted his hand. He rushed through another deep breath.
Dean flipped on the radio.
Sam flipped him off.
Dean paused. “I don’t know. Have you ever thought about it?”
He noticed a small scrap of paper on the floor. He picked it up to toss in the trash, but then he saw what was on it. It was torn in half, but he’d recognized that red S anywhere. It was the same logo on all of Sam’s sweatshirts.
“Cas, wait,” Dean ran after him.
Dean did know what he was trying to say, but it was the last thing he expected to hear. Dean felt his stomach drop and he desperately tried to figure out how the hell Bobby knew. This was different from Gabriel’s usual bullshit. Bobby would never joke about something like this. And he’d never said anything to Dean before. Had he said something to other people? To Sam? How long had he thought Dean and Cas were
Sam did not say the incantation, this time. Kelly had looked it over and realized the incantation was actually a part of an ancient Mayan recipe. He’d basically been reading out loud the importance of preheating your firepit. No need for any sort of ancient words. Now, all they needed was Dean.
“It’s. . .complicated.”
“No—”
Lisa laughed and Dean leaned back just enough for Cas to see his satisfied smirk.
Dean was still frozen. Cas turned back to him.
Dean was up and dressed by the time Sam came into the kitchen in his exercise clothes. The toaster went off. Sam grabbed a plate and helped himself to some of the scrambled eggs Dean was cooking. Dean grabbed the two slices of hot toast, fumbling while trying not to burn himself. The toaster had three slots, so he could’ve made another piece. But they only needed two. Dean didn’t think about it.
“Ancient texts? Aw, yes!” Kelly pumped a fist, “That’s why I became a hunter in the first place.”
“May the best man win.”
“Sam told me you were sorry.”
“Jack,” Cas choked out.
“Listen… We tried the ritual. It didn’t work. I can try it again, but maybe you should, I don’t know. Go take a break. Go live your life, you know. You’ve earned it.”
The audience roared with laughter. Sam leaned forward in his seat. Dean finally looked at him. Sam was tense. He nodded slightly, reassuring him that he had this situation under control.
Cas stayed up all night, sitting on the couch with a cup of tea that he forgot to drink. He looked back on their years of friendship, trying to make sense of his feelings. Was he really in love with him? Maybe it was a temporary moment of insanity. He didn’t date or hook up with people. Maybe he was just lonely, and Dean was just there.
Crowley flipped through the papers on his desk with one raised eyebrow.
Charlie was in his kitchen, searching his cabinets for something sugary for breakfast. She made the drive from Illinois last night. He needed reinforcements if he was going to get through Sam’s party tonight, and Charlie always knew how to make him feel better.
The kitchen had two doors. One led to their living room. The other led to the backyard, and it had a small window with a frilly white curtain.
He sat in the driver’s seat of the impala.
“Cas.”
I know last time I saw there'd be two chapters, but I decided to make it three.
“Cas, this is incredible!” Dean said with his mouth full.
“I do.” Cas could feel the weight of Dean’s gaze. “But we could end up hating each other. I would rather let you go now, go have a good life with a good family. And please respect the ending I choose.”
Ellen didn’t smile. She gave them one more warning look and then she left the room.
“Uh, terrifying,” Sam said, sliding into the chair next to him, “It’s the hardest year academically. I’m actually here to get a head start on the SATs. Dean said you got almost a perfect score.”
“Brown turned him down.”
He sort of got it into his head that Cas would be there for breakfast for some dumb reason, so he cooked. A lot. Usually, Sam was always the first one up, but when he got his lazy ass out of bed at 9, he walked into a kitchen full of muffins, toast, eggs, bacon, sausage, strawberries, waffles, and quiche.
“Yes,” Cas said, gratefully, “I’ve been talking with Charlie about taking a road trip this summer to California.”
Cas actually smiled at that. “I’ve always been a rebel.”
Cas swallowed.
“First of all, you can’t stop him from dating someone. You’re a parent, not a patrol officer,” Claire cut him off. He looked like he was committing her words to memory. She softened slightly and said, “and if you have questions about being gay, don’t expect him to teach you everything. Do some research yourself. Be informed.”
Then he took another second.
Fighting is easy, making up is harder.
“No,” Cas slammed the door and Dean rolled down his window to glare.
Dean blinked but his smile didn’t falter.
Cas accepted the plate with a weary smile.
“Dean, God, I know—”
Cas wasn’t smiling.
“It sounds pretty serious. Dean moved out,” Jo dropped the bombshell.
The wedding was very small, in Shannon and Sam’s backyard. About a dozen tables were set up in the grass, with family and friends seated around them. Candles flickered on every table, and string lights hung between trees shined above them.
Dean didn’t know where to start. He still had
“I don’t like it, I love it,” Kelly said. “Dinner break!”
“They don’t know what we’re looking for,” Dean said.
“Are you cold?” Malia asked, “We found your jacket.”
Jack sat on the bed, back to the door. Eileen stood by the window, and saw Cas as soon as he stepped into the doorway. Her eyes lit up.
“No, you’re right Cas, you should move out. It makes sense. And don’t you worry about me, I won’t have any trouble finding someone to move in. Lots of people would love to stay with me.”
He didn’t have to wait long to find out.
“Right,” Sam sat in the kitchen chair with Dean’s jacket. Cas blinked. Sam was wearing a short sleeved plaid button up. His hair was gelled away from his face. Cas hadn’t noticed him sitting there, but of course, he had gotten distracted by the expensive new television.
The door to the kitchen opened. Dean walked inside, hat in hand.
“How did you get back?” Sam asked.
“Like your thoughts?”
“Well, Chad asked me if I. . . and I thought he was your good friend—”
“You’re back,” Sam said, breathless.
Dean woke up first. He carefully scooted out from underneath Cas’s arm. Cas rolled over and buried his head in his pillow as Dean gently closed the door behind him.
Sam looked at Dean. Dean looked back, expecting an answer. He didn’t care that the question sounded like something a needy boyfriend would ask. It was a fair question, and if Sam couldn’t answer, that just meant Dean was right. Cas had amnesia. Or he forgot how to use phones. Or he was in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere, searching the ground for quarters because he didn’t have a cell phone and there was a pay phone right there. That made sense.
Dean didn’t know what to do, so he picked a direction and drove. Cas stared at the dashboard with a vacant expression.
“No,” Sam sputtered, “Nothing like that.”
“What did you fight about?” Sam asked.
Dean folded his arms. Then he threw his arms down, “We don’t have time for this. Look, I need some ancient Mayan artifacts to portal— I’ll explain later.”
So was the plate.
“That’s not what I—”
“Nothing,” he said with his mouth full.
“What? Anna came by around lunch and told me you were sorry.”
“I’m sorry,” Cas looked him in the eyes, “I’m sorry that happened to you.”
After Ellen recovered from the cake crime scene, she announced that Dean and Cas were going to go buy some dessert. It wasn’t a suggestion, and not even Sam’s protests changed her mind. Charlie didn’t let him protest too hard. She convinced the group that Cas and Dean definitely needed some alone time before they could answer any questions.
“I’m only asking you to consult me before making any big spending decisions. Unless you want to get a job of your own.”
There were still two hours to kill before the party. Dean spent most of the day hanging around the Roadhouse, helping Jo hang decorations and while Ellen worked on Sam’s birthday cake. Although pie was her specialty, she unfortunately insisted on cake. It was extra fancy too, probably because she felt guilty for missing Sam’s graduation next week. Dean offered to help with frosting, but Ellen sent him packing.
“What else,” Sam muttered.
“Yes,” Cas nodded once, “very helpful.”
“Trying to.”
“I know we have some pictures of your braces and bowl cut years.” Dean left the kitchen.
But Cas wasn’t here.
“Sam, we don’t have time for—Dammit kid, get off my leg.” Dean took a few steps, but Henry didn’t let go.
This was always going to happen eventually. It was better that it happened now.
“Lawrence is like the opposite of California,” Cas said, “but it has its own charm. And cheaper real estate.” She chuckled.
“Nothing has to change because I’m gay. I don’t have feelings for you, Dean.”
“He hunts animals for fun,” Cas explained. “Um, what else do you do for fun, Chad?”
Dean could see Sam’s smile in his peripheral vision and just shook his head.
Dean and Sam were dressed in white polos tucked into white pants. They both had chef hats that were slightly floppier than normal.
“Is this for a case?”
Dean and Sam sat at a 24-hour diner. The Joyous Discus, well a piece of it, was safely wrapped up in Dean’s flannel on the booth next to him. Dean and Sam thanked their waitress, who brought them their burgers. Turned out neither had actually gotten dinner tonight.
“So you have a baby. That’s why you haven’t called me?” Dean asked.
Dean took a deep breath. The smell of fries was calming.
“It doesn’t matter what happened, because Dean and I are done. It doesn’t matter why. Friendships don’t last. People change. We’re not going to live together, and we’re not going to talk about it, so neither should you.”
She laughed, apparently deciding that Jack was joking.
Of course, it was only natural that they’d have a few rough patches. They’d been best friends since they were kids, and they were 26 now. Even still, Cas could count the number of genuine fights they’d had on one hand.
“Gender doesn’t exist to angels. Of course, since my vessel became permanent, I liked to consider myself a man. Yet, when it comes to selecting sexual partners, I’ve never taken gender into consideration. I am drawn to a person’s soul.”
Cas apologized. Dean forgave him. And the two became even closer.
The worst part was, Dean knew it was true. But that didn’t mean he had to stick around and take it. He turned away from Cas and stormed toward the door.
Chad smiled his same, blissed out smile. Jack’s smile seemed a little strained. Not that Cas noticed. Dean led them out the backdoor, into a brick alley which was covered in faded graffiti and sprinkled with smashed glass bottles and cigarette butts.
He’d never seen Jack look so angry.
Dean took a sip of his coffee. Sam turned to him.
“They didn’t hook up,” Sam glared.
Sam picked at the label of his beer. “We never really talked about what would happen after Cas came back. I mean, is it back to business now? Saving people, hunting things.”
“Go ask Sam for a car seat. I’ll get the keys.”
Dean reached for the pie, “Always.”
“Sammy.”
Cas stood. He pushed in his chair and didn’t let go.
“Oh, uh. . . were you thinking a friends-with-benefits thing? Because I could be into that, too.”
“An ass like that is worth a chance,” Gabriel nodded. Dean nodded back. Gabriel took a bite of cookie. He chewed thoughtfully than said, “I always thought you’d give Cassie a chance. Since he’s in love with you and all.”
Then he started to smile.
“Don’t worry, totally Sam’s fault," Dean signed.
“Henry has the rings,” Cas said before Dean could make a joke that would freak Sam out even more. Dean sadly pulled away from Cas and slapped Sam on the back.
Dean grabbed him by the arms, “Cas, it’s really you. Come on, the stairs are a bitch, but we better start climbing. I can carry you if you’re hurt—”
But that was fine. Dean had a plan. He was going to fix everything.
“Right,” Dean nodded. He looked over at Cas, “When did you realize you. . . you know. About me.”
Hours passed, or maybe days. He was starting to get worried this was one of those classic Hell tasks, where you were doomed to repeat the task forever without stopping for food or water or sleep. But he kept going down the stairs, ignoring the screeches and whimpers, and wishing he’d brought a damn flashlight.
“But… you never said anything.”
“He didn’t say,” Sam slowly held up his phone, “But his number has an area code.”
“I would love to see the completed Discus,” Shannon said.
“You can’t tell anyone,” Cas blurted first.
The backdoor was in the kitchen. No sign of the plate in here. It was a nice kitchen, warm and well decorated. Sam immediately noticed the artwork on the fridge. A painted handprint turned into a turkey. Pretty small handprint.
Dean wasn’t in the mood for questions.
“Your brother’s here?” the blonde girl asked. Dean smirked.
Dean knew he shouldn’t have said it. Vessels were a sensitive topic, but Meg and April were a million times worse. He glanced back at Cas, but he didn’t look upset. In fact, he was half smiling.
A happy ending meant the three of them, together, with fulfilling lives as a family, dammit. Sam had helped him get here, but now it was Dean’s job to save Cas. Grip him tight and raise him from the Empty. Full circle, if you thought about it.
Sam’s eyes slid to the plate, then back to Dean. Dean couldn’t meet his eyes. Sam pressed on.
Cas felt like the couch had been pulled out from underneath him. The last thing he wanted to do was upset Dean. That was the whole reason he wanted to move out.
“—and, Dean. After my actions and the rather unconventional twists and turns my life took this past decade, I believe this is where I deserve to be. I will spend the rest of my days here, in this hell within a hell, reflecting on the life I led and knowing that you and Sam are out there, alive and well. It is the best ending I could have ever hoped for.”
“No.”
“Dean, he’s not a lost dog—”
Cas forced himself to look him in the eyes, “Yes. You should go. Where’s Sam? And everyone—”
Dean was dressed in his usual clothes: a crisp white button up tucked into a nice pair of slacks. He had a tie and a belt. His hair was parted to the side and gelled into place. His suit jacket was folded, on the crease, and it hung from the back of an empty kitchen chair. He wasn’t sure what color his suit was. It looked dark grey. But so did most things.
Dean slipped away an hour later. He saw Sam and Eileen sitting at a candle lit table in the corner, and didn’t bother them. It looked like they had a lot to talk about anyway, and Dean was happy for them. If Sam freaked out, he knew Dean’s number.
Dean pulled over to the side of the road.
“Congrats, man.”
“I’m sure they’ll be okay. Every couple goes through rough patches, but Sam and Eileen are good for each other. I can’t believe they’d fight like that in the front of all of us, though.”
“You make the money, I’ll buy the TVs,” Dean said with a cheeky grin. Cas put his hands on his hips and made an exasperated face. Dean looked at the camera straight on, and gave a mischievous shrug. Everything went black except for a small circle around Dean’s face, and then that was swallowed in darkness, too.
“They found out through Jo,” Sam defended himself to Cas.
Dean woke in the Impala, which was weird because last he remembered was Cas kissing him with desperation and......sexy times.
XXXXX
He wrote a letter, explaining his feelings, and he also left a can of ravioli. (Because it reminded him of Dean, and he was a sap, okay?)
stars humans called souls and it makes him giggle.
Castiel surged forward, quicker than even Dean's trained eyes could track. In a flash, Cas' lips were against his, and they were kissing.
Then it occurs to him that he can return the favor.
They walked down a narrow hallway (Dean limping heavily), Castiel narrating as they went.
"You want me to go? With a fucking broken leg? Really? Well, fuck you Castiel, fuck you, Gabriel-"
Dean stared at the wall.
A hand grasps his cock, and Castiel arches into it, gasping, and it is entirely without preamble when Dean swallows him down.
"Doesn't mean you send a man crashing down the steps!"
“Ravioli, ravioli, give me the formuoli.” A spooky voice rang out. Dean recognized it immediately. An eerie clanging started up. Footsteps echoed.
So for all his three heads, Grace, and towering form, he still cannot match the imperfect,
God had made the angels like a child made up superheroes. Fancy, with a ton of attributes and powers. But without crucial, important things. The angels were prototypes of God's trifling with the creation of emotion, and only humans could feel so vastly.
When Sam returns, he gives them a sly thumbs up and makes a phone call to Bobby.
Castiel merely shrugs, and Dean grins.
"Are you okay, Dean?" Castiel asks, reaching forward to cup the other's jaw.
After about three days of reading non stop, he comes to a realization that makes him chortle with the ridiculousness of it.
".....fucking wind spirits...."
"Shut up, bitch."
Then he turned and saw a
Eventually, Dean was pushed up against the wall, their hips rubbing together. Cas slid his hand into Dean's hair, pulling at the strands.
soft.
"Lie back," Dean says gently, and he cooperates, closing his eyes.
He regretted permanently disabling the GPS on his phone. At the sixteenth (by his count) day, things came to a head.
Castiel stared down Dean, then lifted him up.
"Cas!" he whispered. "Cas!"
Cas led out a weird rumble beside him, and he turned to see a whisp of cloud escape Cas's mouth.
"What the flying fuck are you doing?"
whispered into the sheets.
-.-.-
"Hello, may I see Dean Winchester, please?"
"Come on." He motioned to Dean. "Grab my arm and we'll lower you down."
Castiel resolves to ask if he ever is to try and kiss Dean. He tosses
Dean's mind flashed to all he had done wrong. Was Cas mad that he ate all the ravioli the other day? Was the towel on the floor a source of anger? Oh, Jesus did Cas know he liked him and he wanted to tell Dean that he didn't like him? Scenarios ran through his head like wildfire in a dry forest. Cas was going to kick him out, he was going to make him hobble back to town, he was going to make Dean Gabriel's sex slave- no wait, that's no plausible- maybe it was-
"I- um......"
"Dean, sweetheart, you forget I'm a wind spirit. I can survive without air because I am air. "
“Cas? What is ‘Cas’?” Castiel stared at him, his head at the adorable-
“That’s the bathroom, there’s my room, there’s Gabriel’s-”
Gabriel had found the Impala, and Cas levitated Dean up and out of the bunker.
"DEAN! Why is there a letter?"
“Will do, Sammy. Get some sleep, I’ll be out for a couple hours.” He ended the call, tuning into the local radio station. “Locals are calling this latest tornado ‘The Big One’, as it is an F-5. Meteorologists recommend you stay indoors. I repeat, stay indoors. Do not go outside, this is going to be a record tornado, folks, and we’d like to keep casualties to a zero."
“Nope.”
“Ya know how your name's a mouthful?” Dean, regrettably, hobbled a few steps back.
"We'll dissolve you in acid, of course!"
Sam goes off to Bobby's in order to help him with something. Dean almost went too, but Bobby had insisted that he just needed Sam, and that Dean would just be a nuisance.
drug.
-.-.-
Sam walked out to the Impala, inspecting it and looking inside.
When Dean settles between his thighs, pleasure zips up his body, and instinctively, he arches his back, hips bucking. Dean presses down, chuckling low, and then they're rutting against each other, their tongues tangling.
"No, a goddamn storm the size of fucking Kentucky. Get the hell in the bunker."
A flick and Dean was sent crashing down the steps.
"A whine sounded in his ears, and Dean blacked out again.
-.-.-
) before reciprocating. He felt Cas's lips open, and a hesitant slide of a tongue against his prompted a groan. From whom it was, he couldn't say.
Castiel briefly looked chagrined but shook it off easily.
Out of pure whatever it was, Dean stepped out of the Impala with a feeling of pure invincibility. Something hit him in the back of the head, and he collapsed, blacking out.
He knows the formulation of love. It starts with dopamine, with pure surges that get you high off the hits. It's the exhilaration, the newness of the companion. And eventually, it begins to relax. Oxytocin comes in.
He divests Dean of his clothing, and when he licks a line up his cock, there's a gasp. Encouraged, he kept going, licking and sucking and generally doing his best to see how many noises he could pull from Dean's mouth.
." He reads. "
Dean malfunctioned for a few seconds (
The next few days started to pick up. Dean adjusted to the fact that Castiel had (somehow) repaired his leg, and mobility was not going to be a plausible option for a while. At least, that’s what Cas told him. He’d nearly had a fit of laughter when Castiel had questioned endlessly why he had shortened his name.
At 9:00, he kissed Dean. He put as much heat and love as he could in it, rocking his hips against Dean, pulling up moans that echoed through his body.
Cas walked there. Unexpectedly, he started to tear up. Dean was eighty, after all. He wouldn't be around much longer.
Unfortunately, that was not the end of Dean's attraction.
Angels were never quite given the luxury of feeling so purely. Castiel wasn't built to be like humans, because he wasn't part of God's most beloved children. Sometimes, he idly wonders how an omnipotent, immortal being can feel love, but it's God, so one can't exactly make rules surrounding Him.
“Dude, personal space.”
"Shut it."
Generally speaking, people don’t float, and Dean was no stranger to that. Nonetheless, the guy kept staring.
"I still have your letter."
"I dunno, discuss it in the morning."
The landing was
“Hey,” Dean croaked out.
Dean's legs crumpled beneath him. His leg snapped with a loud crack.
They rolled about for a good ten minutes, Dean reaching for the stolen device.
"Goodnight, Dean."
The Oklahoma sunshine streamed through the window of the cheap motel. Internally, he moaned, "Sam, where in god’s name are you?"
“Sorry.” He stepped back and Dean could breathe again. "Explain why you shortened my name."
Castiel is content, and a look at a laughing Dean proves his choice was the right one.

Castiel turns to look at Dean, and then they're barely a breath apart. Something thick is in his throat. His mouth moves before he thinks.
He is.
"Better really late then never, I guess." It was such a
"Jerk. Hey, remember, not all stories have great endings."
Adrenaline soaked his thoughts, sharpening them, the clarity making his hands steady as the hunt ended. Castiel had a knife to his throat before a gunshot rang out and the ghoul dropped, brain matter spraying.
It ends all too soon, and Dean looks apologetic, and Castiel feels like he's had a train dropped on him. Which happened once, although now it's less painful.
Arms cage him in, and Dean leans forward to lightly press a kiss to his neck. A shiver hits him because of the warm breath, and he sighs.
Fortunately for Dean, Sam replied.
He swore he caught a glimpse of frantic eyes in the storm, but he shook it off, thinking it was just something that had been blowing.
"Fine. By the way, Dean-o, Cassie's been crushing over ya for some time now-"
, and the two settle in on a couch. For once, Castiel has opted to wear less formal clothes, and now he's wearing sweats and an old worn t shirt. Dean's wearing the same.
"What?" Sam asked when he picked up. "Is there a storm?"
"Cas?" His voice was a croak, made faint by whatever illness plagued him now. His eyes were surrounded by wrinkles but were glittering like emeralds. Cas could still see the Dean he knew in there, in that slightly broken shell.
"Screw it."
Hyperaware of his own inexperience, Castiel contents himself with exploring the gorgeous body before him.
“What is it?”

"Ooh, love it when you get saucy."
The first time Dean Winchester kissed him, it felt like the world tilted out of place and back again.
A snap and the grass rolled itself up, revealing a trapdoor. Castiel knelt and lifted it up.
"Are you ready?" he asks.
Namely, lips, but that's only a small part of the equation. There's love and lust, which could be separate or entwined, although Castiel has never once had a kiss sustained only by lust. Every kiss he has bestowed is so full of love that it makes him ache. Although he hasn't bestowed many.
"That isn't right!"
"Cas--" Dean chokes out, his eyes fixated on the thin line cut into his flesh.
With a feeling of dread, Dean grabbed on.
Over the course of the next few days, Castiel learns of more types of kisses.
"Um--" Dean begins, cutting himself off before he starts. Castiel feels an unhappy sensation in his chest.
".....Sam said to not go out, well fuck him...."
"OOF!"
He survived only with a couple bruises, but their other van had been trashed to the point of no return. They only had the Impala now, and to be honest, Dean was happy to be without the 'Tool-mobile', as he called it.
"Well, Dean, I'm afraid, yes, yes you will."
He opens his mouth to breathe, and a tongue slides against his, hot and slick. Somewhere along the way, he's wrapped his arms around Dean, who presses him onto his back.
"I told you that in confidence! I trusted you!"
Forcing his eyes away from the corpse, he follows Dean and Sam out.
Gabriel's eyes got huge, one small sign of surprise. "Oh, shit."
He poked Cas in the belly.
It's a grisly sight, Castiel is sure. When he looks down, he sees the pool of blood. The back of the skull has been blasted away, leaving a crater. Like some demented flower, the skin and muscle have peeled away in petal-like shapes.
".....fucking sons of bitches...."
“What the fuck, Gabriel.”
Dean took a few steps forward and immediately slammed into a door.
"I'm sorry for not visiting you sooner." Cas touched Dean's arm.
"Alright, I will." Castiel swooped down.
“They arrived at the storage.
"I'm fine- OW!" A trickle of blood was starting to make its way down Dean's chin. "I'm fine. Just open the damn door, please."
"What?!" Dean gaped at them.
Castiel blinks. Then he mulls it over. "Okay. I trust you."
Dean stares at him over the cup of coffee in his hand. "Uh, what?"
“Gabriel.”
The door to the storage opened. They split apart, faces red and lips swollen. Gabriel raised an eyebrow at both of them.
f Sam wouldn’t get back, he’ll just look for one himself. It was Oklahoma, for god’s sake. Tornadoes were practically just the way of life.
"I don't know what you're talking about!"
"Dean," he says one day, holding up a copy of
To be honest, he didn't know. Castiel had never told him, just that they were going in a bunker.
"Hand it over, and I'll release it."
He wanted to sob, to hold on to Dean, to take back all the years and start over.
"Okay," Dean says, placating. "I know, it sucks, but what are you gonna do?"
XXXXX
Together, they lifted the unconscious man.
"It's a novel, Cas," Dean says, exasperated.
To Dean's surprise, Gabriel merely exploded into a cloud. Honey eyes gleamed in the midst of all the chaos.
Dean smiles, and he reaches over to a bedside table, retrieving lube and a condom. Gently, he pushes down the other.
"Gabriel, shut up."
"So, um, you like me?" Dean's voice was barely a whisper.
"Bedroom," Dean growls, and Castiel agrees. They get off the couch, stumbling back to the bedroom Dean has claimed as his own. Halfway there, Dean crowds him against a wall, gripping his hips and grinding them together. Castiel holds him tightly, and fleetingly thinks that this is a very good kiss.
- tilt of his head.
When they finally make it to the bedroom, Dean slows down. He's no longer frantic, his movement deliberate as he shucks his shirt and pants, leaving boxers.
The first thing Dean saw was clouds. Bright white clouds that seemed to dance in the sky. It seared his eyes, and he shut them quickly. He rolled over, or rather, tried to, as some force pushed him away from whatever edge there apparently was. He looked down, and then immediately wanted to vomit. Then he realized he was not alone.
And that is when love truly starts to develop, because humans fundamentally want companionship, want someone to trust and confide in and be there. Oxytocin is long term, is something that doesn't provide quite the high, but it's there. It's in the easy assurance of love.
“Dean! Are you alright?!”
"FUCK!"
He pushed open the door, and he was startled by Dean, white-haired and still so pretty.
"I see."
"We don't have to go further, if you don't want to," Dean says, nervous.
Dean pulls away to catch his breath, seemingly thinking over things. Castiel misses the contact.
"Okay," Sam said. "If there is one, Dean, you better drive your ass up here and stay in a bunker. We don’t want another Kansas."
"Why doesn't he ask permission?" he asks, concerned, although he notes that Dean seems to be thinking about something. Something he apparently feels guilty about, although Castiel refuses to pry.
"I think he's hurt, Gabriel." Castiel looked about as worried as a mother hen.
Although Dr. Sexy wasn't quite as concerning to his morality.
Slowly, Dean pulls off Castiel's clothing, until they're both nearly naked. His body thrumming, Castiel holds Dean's face in his palms and kisses him slowly. It seems the romance novels are good for something after all, because when he palms Dean's erection, the other groans lowly, and Castiel thanks the author for the trick.
"Can I kiss you?" he asks, small and broken, because he is almost certain Dean will refuse.
Yet another text rolled in.
He notes wryly that there are so many amazing ways to kiss, before Dean starts to move and he's robbed of sentient thought.
"Sorry." The voices quieted.
"That's all you're gonna be, give or take a hundred years." Cas felt a tear roll down his cheek.
"Cas," Dean gasps out, voice wrecked, "please let me fuck you."
“Hello.” The words seemed to swirl in static for a moment before being registered by Dean. “I’m Castiel, and you are?”
"After all these years?"
It was late, and Dean was practically done. There wasn’t a sign of a storm, and as a storm chaser, his livelihood depended on natural disasters. And for weeks, a storm hadn’t popped up.
“Nice.”
Storm clouds started to gather, but Dean neglected to notice them. He parked on the side of the road, then dialed Sam’s number.
"Dean," Castiel says seriously, making the other look up, "please lie down."
for it, but it was true. Cas was a drug. Or as Gabriel would put it, a
Dean wanted to scream. He wanted to punch something.
He snatched the pile of peanuts lying on the counter and peeled out in the Impala, the large black van used in their cases. I
Emotion brims at the edges of his being, and Castiel thinks that he should be thankful that this is in a vessel. Although his three heads don't have human lips, so a kiss would be out of the question anyway.
XXXXX
It's intense, and his whole body is a live wire. After an eternity of torturous pleasure, he's finally completely unclothed.
Dean stared at the screen and checked the time. 10:34 AM. Another message came in, with that stupid emoji. Sam had added it when he was going through Dean's phone. (Which Dean knew  he had done, but still. Don't add heart things to contact names.)
Gabriel flicked a switch, illuminating the steps and a very passed out Dean.
It's a painful realization to face. And Castiel wishes, with all his muted, horribly angelic emotions, that he could love Dean Winchester as profoundly as he possibly could.
Automatically, his legs part to let Dean in, and warmth shoots through him, an electric hum against his skin.
Cas strode to the nurse, wearing a blue button-down and a pair of jeans.
"Alright. Third door on your right."
"Goodnight, Cas."
Dean stared outside. “Damn right there is. It might be an F-1, maybe F-2, if the thing even shows up. I doubt it will.”
"What he
"Cas!" Dean interrupts, looking slightly alarmed, his eyes blown wide, pupils dilated. His fingers tightly grip the mug, and Castiel worries he'll break it.
Grabbing Dean's free hand, he entwines their fingers as he loses his mind. There's a building sensation, but all too soon, Dean pulls off and Castiel whines at the loss.
"I must say, that went better than expected."
"Cassie?"
There are many things that come together for a kiss.
With a snap, Castiel re-zapped Gabriel. Another shriek rang out.
"I've kept it."
But the fact remained that, yes, Dean would eventually have to leave.
"Alright, Dean, let's go." He stood with his legs apart, looking about as powerful as a short, pudgy guy could get.
He fished through his jeans pockets and grabbed his phone, and pressed the power button. A flicker of life, and it turned on. The luminosity of it nearly blinded him. Sixteen percent. Just enough power to text for a few minutes. He sent a message.
"R-i-i-i-i-g-h-t.....Anyway, you gonna rescue the fucker or what?"
"What?" Castiel tore his eyes away, and he stared at Gabriel. "No!"
"I told ya, your name's a mouthful."
"Well, you had this mighty fine ass-"
"DEAN?!" Sam yelled. He wrapped his enormous moose arms around Dean and squeezed.
"Yes."
But then Dean nods, and before he knows it, they're kissing, and it feels like the world is spinning and Dean is the only solid thing around.
Sam, bless his stupid, interfering soul, takes the opportunity to burst in. He glances between the two in the room, then down to the dead ghoul on the floor.
"When the hell did you get so salty?" Dean smiled.
And then a mouth is on his, and something sparks in his chest. He knows what causes his reaction, knows exactly why his knees go weak and his eyes flutter shut. Automatically, he tries to return the kiss.
It did, and light flooded in, blinding him for a moment. Castiel stood in the doorway, his figure illuminated.

"Hand over my phone."
"So what? it's the middle that counts."
"Dean, are you okay?" Castiel's worried voice came through the door.
“Well, first of all,” Gabriel said, “we saved you- against my warnings, I could add- so why don't you shut the fuck up and let us explain."
“Where’s the food?”
"Like what? A broken leg?!"
He turned over.
"Glad you think so," Dean says and Castiel realizes he's spoken aloud.
"Hand it over."
Gabriel cringed. "Cas-"
"Yeah," Dean says softly. Then, softer: "I'm just really lucky."
"When do I need to go back?"
"Cassie!" Gabriel squealed. "I haven't seen you in fucking forever. How's that Oklahoma sunshine?"
XXXXX
"No."
"So much for grace," he says aloud, huffing out laughter.
Dean sulks, and Castiel feels bad for him (another human emotion). So he asks to watch a movie with him, because he knows Dean likes movies and it might cheer him up,
"Good," Dean replies, relieved. Then he pushes Castiel back on the bed, gently.
She looked up at him. "Do you have any familial relation to Mr. Winchester?"
He twirled in the air, becoming a swirling cloud. Honey eyes gleamed in the midst of it, and then a long, drawn-out crackle of thunder echoed through the air.
“I’m fine.”
-.-.-
"That was some pretty hardcore shit, but still."
"Getting you down."
Dean, who had previously been silent as a lamb, stood up. He gestured at the ground below. "How, exactly, am I supposed to get down?"
"I like it."
Castiel began to read cheap romance novels out of boredom. They're garbage when it comes to plot and characters, but the emotions are there.
Dean chuckled and closed his eyes. "I'm going to die soon. I can feel it in my bones."
Tongues clashed, and soon they were on the bed, clothes stripped off, Cas thrusting into Dean, Dean pulling into Cas.
Soft, short ones, like the one Dean gave him over breakfast, flavored with coffee.
He kept poking, and eventually, Cas tried to punch him.
Dean digs out a copy of
"C'mon," Sam says, breaking the silence. "Let's torch the body and go."
Dean rolled over in bed, and Cas resolved. Dean would leave that evening.
Breathing heavily, Castiel retreated. He pointed at Dean. "You- me- hallway- now. Gabriel, don't you dare listen in."
"Mortal bodies are terribly bulky, aren't they?" Gabriel smirked.
Castiel looked down and found himself in total awe at the man below. Dirty blond hair, cut short, was sticking up, and he had a lean, muscled body. It really made him uncomfortable how much he was mesmerized by the man. Gabriel cackled. "Cassie, you are such a goner. Oh, my lord, this is gonna be so great. You'll bang the bastard, right?"
Dean swallows his cry and he bites Castiel's shoulder as they rock through the waves together.
The Big One, they had called it. Dean got interested at once. This could be their big break. His phone rang, but he was too caught up in this. The blood rush, the exhilaration. This is what a storm chaser is meant to feel. Not anxiety that his job was at stake.
He rolled out of the bed and hissed when his bare foot touched the floor. Wait- barefoot? He waved the bright phone screen all around his body and found that he had been stripped to his boxers.
But the seraphim were incomplete. That is a revelation that took him a while to get over. He's fundamentally flawed in his construction, because for all his semi-immortality can do, he is still not quite living in his purest state, because he cannot love like Dean Winchester can.
"Bro, I hate to interrupt your ranting, but we've got bigger problems."
"GABRIEL!" Dean hobbled around the bunker, looking for his phone. "WHERE THE HELL DID YOU PUT IT?!"
Castiel smiles at him tenderly, which seems to snap Dean from his daze. The blond man stalks forward, smoothly, and a thrill races up Castiel's spine.
Dean woke up on a soft bed in darkness. Was he back at the motel? A stabbing pain went through his leg, and the memories of the previous evening ran through his mind.
"That's amazing. You know," Gabriel dropped his voice sarcastically, "you might actually experience feelings. Capital-F Feelings! Those amazing, fantastical, magical feelings!"
Naked, breathless ones where they deflower the map table. Long, slow makeouts on a couch while a movie plays. Kisses on the ear and the back of the neck. Kisses in the shower, and so many others he almost can't name them all.
Sipping his cocoa, he pads over to investigate what a cocoa flavored kiss is like.
Gabriel turned back to his human form, then glanced down. With a whistle, he shook his head. "Hey, Cassie, if you wanna save a human, you might wanna save the poor son of a bitch right there."
XXXXX
Kissing Cas was like taking a drug. It was hard to stop once you started. He'd probably end up on
In a few strides, Dean covers the room, and it occurs to Castiel that this is not at all like the romance novels he sneaks into the Bunker, and then hands fist into his trench coat, and he's rendered immobile.
“No, you’re not. Get back in bed.”
They don't talk about the kiss. They continue with their lives, and Castiel eventually figures that Dean was so caught up in the moment he forgot himself.
"Hello, Gabriel. I'm fine."
"I was getting irritated."
“Forget the ravioli, why are you calling me Cas?” The other stepped forward, which was probably not a good idea for Dean’s mental health and sanity.
"Alright."
The thought plagued him at night. It started when he was eating breakfast.
"What?!" He scowled.
“Gabriel, do NOT use those abilities on Dean.” With another snap, Castiel restored Dean’s normal mental state. Then he returned his attentions to Gabriel. “We may be venti, and it is within our nature to  don’t you weirdos tell me.” Dean stared, his eyes hard.
