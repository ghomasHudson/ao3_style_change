John tracked movement and more often than not the person moving was a woman who had happened to catch his eye.
That is something, at least. Sally smiles. "She said she'd bring her fiancé, too."
The doubt in John’s voice was painful to hear. “No. You were raised during the Thatcher years, John. You had that hatred and that shame instilled in you by everyone from your parents to the media. You witnessed your parents turn your sister away for being a lesbian. How could you be anything but terrified to find yourself attracted to another man?”
******
John looked around and found several of the officers standing nearby, eyeing them with badly concealed curiosity. Ah, yes. Perhaps he should not make it quite so obvious that his Psy flatmate was the most important person in his life. They were already speculating thanks to the scent thing. He could only hope it would fade soon so they would stop jumping to all the conclusions John wished were correct.
"It was a camping trip and it was an absolute disaster - as if the entire universe had conspired against us. But we got through it without any major fights and I knew right then that she was the one," Arthur said, smiling at his wife. "You don't just let a woman prepared to fight a bunch of raccoons with a paddle in defense of our sandwiches go without a fight."
He already had his suspicions but a proper experiment required several repetitions to make sure the initial outcome had not merely been an accident. He was already looking forward to conducting a whole row of additional experiments to support the new theories he was beginning to form.
"Know what?" John asked, confused.
"And it will look very suspicious if you refuse to eat for a week," John pointed out.
Forcing his attention back to the book although he had already deleted everything about its contents, Sherlock waited until John was done getting dressed and had made use of the bathroom. When John came back out, however, Sherlock found himself wishing he would have stayed in longer.
"You haven't shifted in half a year, John. Your entire behaviour is turning increasingly cat-like, your temper is triggered by the tiniest of things and you are, right at this moment, prowling our sitting room like a caged panther."
Sherlock was allowed to return home the day after the next, once the doctors were convinced that his fever was not going to return. For his part, Sherlock was convinced they had kept him in longer than necessary because his brother was a terrible worry wart and had instilled the fear of Mycroft in them.
After some undetermined length of time, he felt John's hand on his elbow, startling him back into reality in time to hear John make their excuses and to add his own goodbyes before allowing John to lead him from the room.
*****
is the tipping point where the odd sensation he's been trying to parse tips over into arousal and before John knows it, he's kissing Sherlock harder, trying to pull him closer and closer and closer, until the desperate beat of his own heart drowns out the music and Sherlock makes a small, soft sound of surprise, and John forgets where they are.
"Relax, Lestrade," Sherlock said. "It's the 4:35 to Newcastle."
But Sherlock looked so young and peaceful. It was the first time in ... well, ever, actually, that John had seen him look like this. Completely relaxed, calm and quiet. Even the faint crease on his forehead that was always present when he was in his mind palace was gone.
John shook his head. "No. I know when you're lying. And you weren't lying about anything you said to him. Why didn't you tell me?"
His divorce had been finalised only last month, Mary and the child that wasn't his shipped off to parts unknown by Mycroft with an assurance that he would not see either of them again. He wasn't sorry. Too much had happened, too much had been irrevocably destroyed by Mary's words and deeds.
And now this ... Sherlock, all but ordering him to help him out of his clothes, as if John needed any additional incentive to absolutely devour him.
Lestrade merely watched their debate. "Yeah, there hasn't been much going on since your little adventure," he said. "We were mostly busy cleaning up at the hangar. I tried to chase some leads on this Jim Moriarty guy but the Psy are tight-lipped as usual about it. Couldn't get any of the bastards to talk to me. It seems they are trying to pretend he never even existed."
"Of course. Didn't stand a chance, what with you waltzing around in designer trousers that were basically painted onto your body. You really have no idea how attractive you are, do you?"
The woman - Emily - nodded. "You got yourself a police escort to get a chance to talk to us and you came all this way just so you could ask us to come and help John. Why?"
It didn't.
"Shut up," Sherlock grumbles. "I'm sick, interrogating me on my opinions isn't fair."
"You really mean that, don't you?" Sherlock murmured, amazed all over again. "You're not just saying that."
John snorted. "What else was I supposed to do? Let him ruin my wedding day? You know he would have. He made it quite clear that he wasn't joking."
- hands rose to grab his head and pull him back down.
Lestrade nodded and pulled out his phone to follow the suggestion.
As was so frequently the case with London traffic jams, the reason for the delay never quite appeared. One minute, they were crawling along at snail's pace, the next everyone simultaneously seemed to remember what the gas pedal was meant for and they were back in free-flowing traffic, without anyone ever being able to pinpoint the precise moment of the shift.
“Wait,” he laughed as Sherlock took in the displays. “Did you just take me underwear shopping?”
"Never mind. I'll find another name."
Sherlock found himself lifting his head a little and looking John straight in the eye. He looked ... determined and, yes, there it was: anger.
"You can't just leave," Sherlock tried to protest, even as he allowed himself to be pulled along. "There's paperwork."
Sherlock did the rapid blinking thing he did when John said something he hadn't expected. John was privately gratified with how often he had managed to startle this reaction out of the Psy in the three days he had known him. It was clearly involuntary, the only response that betrayed even a hint of emotion and wasn't shut down behind the cold wall of Sherlock's Silence.
"You're really going back?" John asked softly, in lieu of any of the other questions piling up on his tongue. "To France?"
John grins back.
"He won't," Sherlock told her with absolute confidence. "Johnny knows where he belongs."
Sherlock didn't see either hide nor hair from John in an entire week. He tried not to let it get to him. They were adults and John had a life of his own - a job, a flat, a fiancée... of course he was too busy to bother visiting Sherlock all the time. Still, Sherlock couldn't help but worry. It had felt as if they had been making progress.
Sherlock has no idea when or how they ended up sharing the role of fatherhood to a little girl he is in no way related to, but bathtime belongs to him now. He can hear John rummaging around in the kitchen, doing the washing up after dinner. The dishes need cleaning and so does Rosie. Since John can't do both at the same time, Sherlock finds himself in the role of designated bath-giver. The poetic irony of him putting John's daughter in water doesn't escape him, but the tub is shallow and these waters are clear and easy to navigate. There is no risk of drowning.
John nodded. "So are you."
“Only if you want it to be,” John promised happily, mouth trailing back up Sherlock’s spine and making sure their bodies slid together the further up he moved.
Sherlock opened his eyes and smiled lazily. “How could I forget?”
He does neither of these things.
John, here with him.
"That's the window to the new vestry. Where Mary was."
Except ... well, Sherlock
John does not disappoint.
Lestrade nodded, waved his goodbyes and disappeared back down the stairs.
But now it was definitely later and there was no excuse to stay in bed any longer and certainly no excuse for them to be curled up like this.
"Emily..." the tall male began but she waved him off. "Leave it, Ty."
“Nothing!” The officer said defensively. “I asked him if he could tell me anything about what happened. He started asking for you and then ran out. The paramedics gave him a sedative. Perhaps that’s what-”
"Good way to hide a murder, though. Destroying the body and the evidence in one go, with a ton of people around to mess up the scene." Just thinking about it makes her grateful they found the poor sod in time.
His friend blinked, clearly thrown off-guard by this apparent U-turn since their earlier discussion of what did and didn't count as a tradition. It occurred to John that Sherlock had gone to rather a lot of trouble to find what really did seem the perfect way to spend Christmas - for them at least. In fact, Sherlock had done nothing but go to a lot of trouble for John lately, i.e. in the past four years or so.
There was a man with him and just as John focused on their conversation, the man said "Oh, is that yours?" and pointed at him.
He realised he was drifting off on a tangent and made himself focus.
"Why? You already made your choice, John, and you've been reinforcing it at every opportunity."
Thank you all for your comments and kudos, they always make my day! Next week's chapter might be a bit delayed as I'll be traveling on Monday - I'll update as soon as I've got a working internet connection!
He turned and left without further goodbye.
John opened his mouth to argue but a series of little moments flashed before his eyes and he had to concede. "You rather did, didn't you? Guess I really am an idiot."
He swallowed, for once glad that Sherlock had no idea how to read emotions, otherwise he would have read the desire right off his face. And these days, with the added knowledge of what Sherlock's skin felt like under his hands, it was getting increasingly difficult to pretend he didn't feel that desire. He wanted to drag this infuriating Psy up to his bedroom and not let him go until he was absolutely drenched in touch, until he had John's scent all over him, until it soaked into his skin and stayed there.
Lestrade had to agree that John had a point there. It really wasn't difficult to imagine Sherlock doing something simply because it was the logical thing to do. However, the picture fell apart the moment you added John to the equation.
He was beaming and threw his arms out in genuine excitement. John, who had just been about to return his attention to the biscuits on the floor, grumbled at him.
John barely managed to keep his tone even as he replied. “How...?”
The victim got on the train, the train moved and stopped at several stations, the victim developed a nosebleed and dropped dead. Panic in the carriage, everyone left, the police arrived.
*****
And so all the buying, cooking and eating of actual food was John's job. As a result, he had gotten surprisingly good at cooking meals for two - one portion for him to have at night and another to take to work for lunch the next day. He remembered how, back in January, he had been so broke he had had to resign himself to some diced chicken. These days, they made plenty of money through Sherlock's fees for his cases, which he insisted on sharing evenly with John, and John had his part-time job at the clinic to supplement his income. These days, meat was a staple in his diet, as it should be. It was just another thing about his life that had been immeasurably improved by Sherlock.
There was no reply to his enquiry but a few minutes later Sherlock himself entered the kitchen, his hair still wet from the shower, looking absolutely miserable. John felt a pang of sympathy but quickly quenched it. This was not the time for sympathy. There was no point in feeling sympathetic towards someone who had brought his current state upon himself by excessive drinking. And Sherlock of all people should not come into close contact with addictive substances.
He had spent the last three years thinking Sherlock didn't care, that he had simply abandoned them, just like that. To hear instead that Sherlock had been sending her gifts, had stayed updated on her life to such an extent, was nothing short of a weight off of John's chest.
"Sorry mate," Greg murmured, crouching down next to him to unlock the handcuffs. "We don't know."
A clean cloth was fetched from somewhere and John grabbed it, eyeing the body on the floor.
"Uh, Sherlock?"
John stared at him, feeling the cold horror wash through his entire being. He had been right in his rant about the dissonance. The PsyCouncil truly had enslaved an entire race and sentenced them to a choice between compliance with Silence and death.
Scotland Yard looked as it always had, the usual assortment of tired Bobbies huddling in its shadow with their cigarettes and eyeing everyone with bored suspicion.
"I'm fine," he said firmly. "I was merely curious. Sentiment seems to have too many negative side effects to be of any use. Did you know changelings die when their mate dies? How can this be beneficial to the survival of the species? It is utterly nonsensical."
John realised then that there were fewer people than usual in the station. Everyone trying to go on the Piccadilly line was politely but firmly refused access.
There was another long silence and then Sherlock's voice.
She turned when he entered and simply stared at him for a long moment before slowly putting down her equipment, taking off her gloves and walking over to him to pull him into a bone-crushing hug, all without saying a word.
"Take it."
"John has become ... essential to my work," he said, choosing his words with care. "It is a difficult task for me to find anyone willing to enter into a flatshare with me, considering the life I lead and all the other drawbacks associated with me."
"I don't think it's too late," he whispered. "We're here, aren't we? We can do anything we want."
"Clearly," Sherlock muttered, then raised his voice a little. "Thank you for preparing these samples for me, Molly. It was ... quite helpful."
"Yeah, when's that going to be?" Lestrade asked, crossing his arms and giving Sherlock a pointed look.
She added two packets to the tray, along with a basket of bread rolls and a handful of slices of toast, some butter and ham.
Changelings used touch to communicate as much as words, perhaps even more so. And John, who was as taciturn when it came to voicing his emotions as any other British male Sherlock had ever met, used touch to give comfort in the only way he could.
Two pairs of feet came up the stairs but John already knew that Lestrade had brought Donovan. He had heard her low greeting to Mrs Hudson. But since Donovan had no idea that John and the dog Johnny were one and the same, she was even less of a reason to get up.
Nothing did, of course, and it was a relief to be able to feel frustrated with the lack of progress.
"Efficient," John said and nodded. "An enemy can't defend themselves when they don't even know they're being attacked. It makes perfect sense to me. I don't like it, but it makes sense."
John grinned. “What, the one with the cloned sheep? Are you telling me that you, of all people, want to see the science museum?”
"Closeted?"
"Whatever," he said and turned on his heel. "I'm going out."
"Up," Sherlock demanded, tearing his mouth away just long enough to utter the short command.
The corner of Sherlock's mouth twitched slightly upwards. "You would, wouldn't you? Luckily for me, that is not what I was about to say. While some people may find my personality off-putting, there are always those who are willing to overlook my personal shortcomings in favour of the rest of the package."
“At least you can put on your pyjamas this way,” John found himself saying, eyeing Sherlock in his customary slacks and shirt. He must have gotten changed while John had been in the shower. Trust Sherlock not to make himself comfortable.
Sherlock shrugged and began shoving the wooden planks back into place. "Wanting something and knowing whether or not it is feasible are two different things, John. I am well aware of what is and isn't possible for me and there are too many factors standing between me and any relationship I would care to cultivate."
Everywhere John looked, he was met with the warm, golden glow of Christmas decorations. There were hardly any of the tacky, multi-coloured, flashing and/or glaring lights he was used to seeing in London. People had even decorated the trees in their front gardens in a festive manner.
"Thank you," he said sincerely, trying to catch Sherlock's gaze. "It's great."
Sherlock turned and looked at her. Dissonance was not part of the ordinary Psy conditioning. Most of them didn't need the pain triggers to keep their powers in check.
“She was up here yesterday evening when you had gone to bed and wanted to know what she could do. That woman is a one-woman-army, John, I wouldn’t have denied her even if I had been able to find a feasible reason to do so.”
The rain got stronger even as he spoke and he could see dark clouds balling up in the sky. This wasn't the usual sombre grey of light rain and the occasional drizzle London got so frequently soaked in. These were the kind of clouds that meant business.
"Are you going to see them?" she asked as Sherlock stood.
John stilled and felt Sherlock relax again. Of course that was the moment the doorbell rang.
John grunted, clearly taken by surprise by Sherlock's movement, but didn't make any sort of complaint. If anything, he only kissed him harder.
Not an Ocelot, he was sure of that now that he had seen the WhiteSpot pack in person.
"Well, we are approaching Easter, it would be horrible if she decided to revoke your cookie privileges," John joked. "You and your sweet tooth would be lost without her."
John opened his mouth to protest but Sherlock already had a counter-argument ready. "I don't trust you not to walk away, either."
"To talk to the chef," Sherlock reminded him. "I was going to inquire about the murder, remember? And once lunch is over, we have a meeting with the other guests for drinks."
"Lestrade said he'll call me with an update later. He's just about to go in for the interview."
The only thing that might brighten his mood was -
“Are you finally going to sit down?” Mycroft asked. “Or was that all you wished to ask?”
The dissonance was like an electric shock running down his spine and he clenched his teeth against the pain. It paled compared to the agony of what losing John would do to him and the thought send another shock along his spinal cord, reinforcing the message that this train of thought was dangerous.
He hadn't even registered them at first and then it had happened precisely as John had pulled him to his feet and he had almost stumbled right into him because ... well.
Sherlock turned his head and glanced at him over his shoulder. The anguish was back in his gaze. "I was in a considerable amount of pain, I had open wounds on my back, and all I wanted was to see you. But when I did, I thought I'd rather be dead for real than to lose you to her."
John nodded, then continued to tip his head from side to side, frustrated with his inability to talk.
"Almost time for breakfast," Sherlock informed him. He had been able to hear John's stomach rumble its disapproval for the past ten minutes and was surprised it had taken him that long to wake up.
He didn't know.
Luckily, Sherlock got the hint that getting anything done without eating breakfast first was not an option, so he made himself a cup of tea (much to John's astonishment - he hadn't been sure Sherlock knew how to do that) and one piece of toast, which he ate with a thin coating of butter and nothing else. John supposed that was better than nothing and given the rebellious look his friend was giving him, this was the best he was going to get.
"I think it's time to get Johnny home now," Sherlock said. "Text me the results as soon as you've got them. Sally, thank you for looking after Johnny today."
Sherlock allowed himself to give him an
She bustles away again and Sally is left alone with Sherlock Holmes.
"Why Sigerson?"
John blinked. "All right..."
The detective froze halfway to the bed. "Is this your way of sending me to bed?"
"I merely wish to solve this case without anyone figuring out who I am before I'm done. At the same time, I'm not sure why you feel the need to inform everyone about your fiancèe - all it will accomplish is to make them think you are cheating on her with a man. That's hardly an image you would aspire to. Am I wrong?"
"I'm going to take your hand and hold it," John told him. "I know you do handshakes sometimes when you're wearing gloves and even without them if it can't be helped, but you aren't wearing them now and I won't let go."
He had been a bit disappointed to be unsuitable for the role of Sentinel, but his loner status also meant that he was not nearly as disappointed as another member of the pack would have been and his conscience would not allow him to take on the position regardless if he could not put his full heart and soul into it.
"Indeed," Sherlock muttered. John headbutted his leg in admonishment.
He stood. "Try to keep your packmates from killing me for this, will you?"
John smirked. “We’ll see how you feel about it once you’re the one trying to wrangle my shoulder into submission.”
He could die like this. He could live forever like this.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock nodded and breezed past the reception area towards the lifts. John kept to his side, trying to look as unobtrusive and inoffensive as possible. The UK in general was a very dog-friendly place, but offices in the city were an entirely different matter.
"They're renewing their vows to reaffirm their commitment," John tried to explain. "To show each other that after all this time together, they still wouldn't want anyone else."
They do catch the jewel thief, a member of the catering staff, and hand him over to the people Mycroft had waiting just outside.
Things get ever stranger from there. Slowly but surely, Sally finds herself sitting down to dinner with Mrs Hudson and Sherlock Holmes at least once a week, at the landlady's insistence.
"Thanks boss."
He watched something in Sherlock’s eyes flare and a barely noticeable flush spreading across those cheekbones. Checkmate.
Perhaps that time would be never, or perhaps later this week.
John snorted. "Please. I can smell your 'lack of interest' from all the way over here and it's not helping at all."
And no matter how hard Lestrade tried, he didn't get another word out of him on the topic.
John woke with an armful of Sherlock Holmes and immediately decided it was by far the best possible way of waking. There were dark curls in his mouth and a knee pressing down on his bladder and Sherlock's breath tickling his neck and it was perfect.
"To whom?"
"John is in Scotland at the moment," Sherlock said, sounding annoyed. "Meanwhile, I'm looking after my parents' dog. Whose name happens to be Johnny. Can we move on to the dead bodies now?"
"Don't bother helping, you've done everything while I couldn't. Take a break."
John decided to take over before someone had the bright idea to punch Sherlock in the face.
Sherlock whimpered in his sleep and another shudder ran through his body. The sound alone was enough to tear at John’s heart.
Perhaps she was delusional? She couldn't possibly misjudge a Psy, even one as unique as Sherlock Holmes, so crassly, could she? Everyone knew Psy did not form attachments. What little information there was about their society was that even their family units were held together by genetics and family loyalty rather than any actual emotional ties. Reproduction was something that happened in a laboratory - sex had no place in their lives.
"Come on, we'll find one of the cubicles for you to change in," John said, dragging Sherlock with him, his clothes firmly pressed to his chest. "Preferably far enough away from everyone to keep the comments to a minimum, alright?"
Sherlock shrugged. "He or she might get suspicious."
He thought he saw a flicker of disappointment on Sherlock's face but it was gone too quickly. Sherlock sniffed. "Of course. Can't have that."
Sherlock waited until the lift doors had closed before turning and smiling down at him.
"Not to worry. I was just about to head down to the kitchen to talk to my wife about breakfast tomorrow," Mr Hendriksen said and tactfully retreated.
Underneath the table, John reached out and grasped his hand again, holding on tight.
"That's Soraya. Ocelot from the WhiteSpot pack in Camberwell. I went to medical school with their pack healer and another pack member."
John flattened his ears at him and pointedly trotted off to the other side of the room where he curled up in his dog bed, hiding his nose under his tail. Perhaps he could just sleep through this entire thing and claim ignorance on the matter if questioned later on. There was certainly nothing he could do about it now short of eating the damn thing.
"Not for an entire week, though," Sherlock reminded him. "I'm sure Mary won't mind you being gone for an afternoon or maybe a day at most, but a week is quite another matter."
"Oh, god. Please."
"Home," John found himself saying. "We can take you to our home."
Sherlock felt his lips twitch - something else that hadn't happened before John's appearance in his life. Molly was clever, asking him to come along so she wouldn't have to make the trip several times.
"Are you going to prove me wrong?" Sherlock asked, clearly trying not to sound delighted.
This time, he was done playing. This time, he was going to destroy them, break into Sherlock's mind and do whatever he wished in there. He could make him forget his own name or, worse, John's. He could make him forget all about John. He could twist John's memory and turn it into a nightmare, could turn every good memory Sherlock had into a walking nightmare. And he could take everything Sherlock knew and use it for his own purposes.
John merely grinned at him. “Yes,” he said. “Just like the good old days. Sherlock, do you want to go to the Yard as well?”
“Look me in the eye and tell me you have nice summer clothes that aren’t at least five years old,” Sherlock challenged him.
"I don't understand," Sherlock said because he didn't. It sounded like he was what John actually wanted, which was impossible because no one in their right mind wanted him, certainly not when the alternative was Mary, who was lovely and kind and didn't keep body parts in the fridge and who never forgot your friends' names.
"Perhaps they didn't want to make a big fuss," she suggested, her voice softening. "I'm sure for once he didn't mean to give offense."
John hoped he had gotten the message. If that woman had had anything to do with the murders or the fraud, he would eat his dog bed raw.
There was no way Sherlock could call him a '
*****
“Sounds perfect.”
But all of that was unimportant now. Sherlock wasn't there. Someone had managed to surprise him, someone had managed to knock them both out and take Sherlock with them.
Three years, lost, stolen. But no more.
“You’ve come a long way,” Lestrade noted, clapping him on the shoulder. “I wouldn’t have thought it but here we are. I’m almost proud of you.”
So far, they were dancing around the truth, neither of them admitting to what they both knew Sherlock so desperately wanted to say. So far, there was deniability.
Lestrade shook his head. "The different London Wings have specific free passage agreements, particularly with the Yard. As a member of DarkStorm she can go wherever she pleases at all times and will not be challenged."
"To get to your actual reason for being here," Emily began, shifting in her seat, "I haven't seen John since we all met at the pub. That was ... before."
your parents couldn't have been mad enough to actually call you 'Sherlock'."
*****
"Oh! How wonderful!" She clapped her hands together before moving to ruffle John's fur. "Oh, you must be so excited, John! And worried, I bet, what with these people experimenting on you. Never fear, love, I'm sure Sherlock won't let anything happen to you."
And then his mouth was back and Sherlock had to bite his own forearm to muffle his shout as he came right down John’s throat at the casual use of
“Westfield Shopping Centre,” Sherlock said immediately, managing to surprise him.
Underneath all that urgency, there was something soft and hesitant. Sherlock was kissing him as if he couldn't believe it was happening, making needy little sounds in his throat that made John's heart simultaneously expand like a balloon and break into a million pieces.
He wished he were as certain about his own state of mind.
He turned on the washing machine and trudged back upstairs. His hair was still wet but a glance at the clock told him John and Mrs Hudson would likely come back soon, if his guess of an hour was correct, and he didn't want John to have to endure the sound of the blow-dryer with his sensitive ears.
She launches into a story about her fiancés mother's chinaware collection and how one of Tom's nephews upset a table and almost sent the entire collection crashing to the floor.
"He has always admired your talents and I frequently saw him reading your website and your companion's blog," Mr James said. "When I heard he had been found in Regent's Park, it seemed the only logical conclusion."
He shrugs. "There's always an off-switch."
"Oh dear," Tyson muttered. "Hide your daughters, hide your sisters, barricade the doors. John is on the prowl."
Deciding to ignore the issue for the moment, John happily continued eating until his bowl was empty, then all but shoved Sherlock towards the fridge. This was a definite disadvantage to his new body - if he had been human, he would have made breakfast and either forced Sherlock to eat something or simply waited for him to be distracted enough to eat by accident when a full plate was set in front of him. That little trick had worked surprisingly well so far and John was not very happy about not being able to use it at the moment.
"No," John said and got up. "Absolutely not."
"John, do you have an hour or so? We need to talk. It's important."
"I'm a cat," John reminded him patiently. "If we see something we like, we pursue it until it's ours."
"Data on what Forsythe's house smelled like and the general sentiments of his widow," Sherlock readily supplied. He hesitated, then added: "And a joke."
He hastily buried the thought. There. If this was what happened when he entertained a purely rhetorical question, how could he ever consider risking anything happening for real? If the idea of John and someone else did this to his self-control, what would the thought of John and him do?
Before he knows what he's doing, he stretches up and presses his lips to Sherlock's cheek.
Sherlock retaliated with his TK, reaching out to slam his assailant against the nearest wall.
"Perhaps I didn't want your pet to interfere," the man suggested.
The other man moved to stand next to the detective, gladly accepting his lighter. "Cheers ... uh... I don't even know your name."
, period.
"That, too," Sherlock conceded, bending down to unhook the lead from John's collar.
*****
John snorted and shook his head. "The Psy don't like touch, you know that. He's no different."
Sherlock sighed.
John raised his head and looked at him, pondering the question. Chasing a criminal through London's streets on four legs instead of two? It sounded like fun!
First, the train trip across half of France had already given him plenty of opportunity to take in the countryside. He had then promptly gotten lost in his hired car on the way from the closest station to the village - an half-hour-long drive through small towns and picturesque villages. He had had French in school for a couple of years for his GCSEs but had quickly forgotten most of it, so he had spent about a week or two on his phone with a language app, trying to refresh at least the basics so he wouldn't be completely lost. He had managed to only take one wrong turn, so that surely counted for something.
"Lucky guess," John said, grinning.
Obediently, Sherlock opened his mouth a little farther and John licked inside, hungry for more of this and trying to tell himself to go slowly, to be gentle. For all he knew, Sherlock had never kissed anyone before this. He deserved for this to be done right.
"Oh right, can't speak. I keep deleting that," Sherlock said, waving a dismissive hand. "Just nod if you're experiencing any of the former."
Sherlock raised his right hand, gloveless at this time of night.
John wondered what the flat looked like to him. He hadn't changed it much. The furniture was the same, arranged the same way. He had put Sherlock's armchair into storage, unable to look at it every day. The only big change was that John now slept in the downstairs bedroom that had been Sherlock's, although he hadn't changed any furniture in there, either. The only room that had gotten a full makeover was his old bedroom, which had been extensively child-proofed and decorated specifically with Rosie in mind.
"Your dog is very well behaved," she said absently, stroking John's head with one hand. "What did you say his name was?"
For a moment, blind panic flooded him. Had John figured it out? Did John know? He had been so careful, where had he slipped up? As his mind searched frantically for an answer to these questions, he schooled his features into a mask of polite interest. "Oh?"
She blushes a little but mostly she just looks disturbed by this turn of events.
John lurched forward and pressed his mouth to his neck, sucking at the vulnerable soft skin where Sherlock's pulse beat much too fast.
John's wry question drew laughter, which Sherlock recognised as an ice-breaker, something he himself had never successfully accomplished as far as he could remember.
It seemed that the usual rule of not talking to strangers in public was automatically suspended when that stranger happened to have a dog. He wondered if this was why people had been talking to him in the park so frequently.
"Thank you," John murmured against his shoulder, gave him one last squeeze and stepped back, smiling at him. "For organising all this just because I asked. I couldn't have hoped for a better best man."
Sherlock had never before gotten upset about him correcting other people's assumptions. In fact, he hadn't even commented on it once, not as far as John could remember.
Like the feeling of John's fingers pressing into the dips between his ribs through his shirt, the warm hands bracketing his hips, the taste of John's tongue in his mouth, the taste of John's mouth when Sherlock dared to reciprocate.
And then he bent down and kissed Sherlock Holmes right on the mouth.
All the air rushed out of his lungs and he could feel himself swaying where he stood.
John found himself glad once more to be unable to speak right now, otherwise he may have accidentally pointed out that cabin fever certainly wasn't the reason for Sherlock's tension.
He wriggled his hands pointedly until Sherlock released them, then reached out to grab his face with both hands.
John woke the moment the sun crept across the horizon and the first light of day made it into his room. He kept his eyes closed and listened for any sounds from downstairs, but Sherlock was still sleeping - if he concentrated, he could hear him breathing. Incredible.
"Want to see some more?" Sherlock asked.
The coffee machine beeps and Sally impatiently waits for the last precious drops to fall into her mug before picking it up and inhaling. "Surprisingly well, actually."
John held perfectly still as the vet carefully extracted the shard of glass with a pair of tweezers, but a cut-off whimper escaped him anyway.  Sherlock tightened his grip a little and allowed himself to run his fingers through the short fur beneath John's ear twice.
God, his skin looked so soft. And there was that one errant curl falling into his eyes again. Surely it was tickling him. Surely it would wake him at any moment. John stared at that curl, unable to tear his gaze away. Finally, the temptation became too much and he carefully brushed it away, exhaling shakily as it seemed to wrap around his finger for a moment.
"Am I what?"
"Desperate how?" John demanded. "Sherlock?"
“One and a half hours in that room and you didn’t feel the need to relieve yourself?”
Almost a week after his wedding and he was at 221b, in bed with Sherlock Holmes.
"John?"
“Hey, can you text your brother?”
The first one had been his assumption that he would be able to remain calm and aloof, as if such a thing had ever been a possibility in the first place.
"Best not," Sherlock agreed, finally pulling up his trousers fully and grimacing as he tried to adjust himself in his pants before pulling up the zip and doing up the button. John wordlessly handed him his shirt, his heart still beating at twice its normal rate and desire still curling in his core.
He tiptoed down the hall towards the bedroom, took two steadying breaths and shoved the door open in one big swoop.
It took him almost two minutes to realise that John's hands were still stroking through his hair, gently smoothing the curls now instead of pulling at them. The gesture was so soft, felt so caring, that Sherlock wanted to cry.
That left one option, and Sherlock wasn't very happy with it.
John threw a pillow at him. "Go back to your datapad and stop asking inane questions."
Sherlock fell on top of him with a gasp and a moan, returning John's desperate, if rather uncoordinated, kiss for several glorious seconds before tearing his mouth away and pushing himself up on his arms.
A moment later, he heard it too: the soft scrape of a shoe on rough ground and the quiet churn of gravel. Someone was coming from the same direction as they had.
John nodded.
"But what a way to go, John. Kissed to death. Like that fairytale."
Sherlock blinked. "Tell you what? I didn't know the food would be unreliable. I shall have a look around the kitchen tomorrow and-"
Sherlock blinked rapidly and found himself answering despite himself. "What is there to say? You've made your feelings on the matter quite clear."
look at him and fixed his gaze on the strong fingers gripping his knees.
He hailed a cab, barked the address at the driver and settled back into his seat, stewing with barely suppressed rage. Mycroft had a lot to answer for.
She yawned and nodded, slumping against his chest and resting her head on his shoulder. "Love you, Pa."
Sherlock raised an inquisitive eyebrow. "Oh?"
"He doesn't seem to hate you," Molly said, in what must be a new height of suicidal bravery.
"There they are," Lestrade said, being the first to notice the three people headed their way. They emerged from underneath the trees and approached quickly - two males and one female.
He was torn from his thoughts when the Psy male spoke again.
“You’re beautiful. How are you so beautiful?”
She ruffled John's fur. "Don't worry about these idiots. You're perfectly well-behaved. It's not your fault you have to live with Holmes of all people."
*****
John froze halfway between the bed and Sherlock. Oh no. No no no no, this was not happening right now. In fact, this was not happening at all. The alcoholic fumes Sherlock was breathing at him had gone to his head, muddling his perception. That was it. Sherlock had not just told him he wanted to sleep with him. Definitely not.
John promptly started forward to sniff at the stranger's trouser legs before giving him a look full of contempt and moving to sit beside his own armchair.
It had been four hours. Four endless hours of Sherlock and Judd Lauren sitting in their respective chairs with their eyes closed, not moving so much as a single finger as they did whatever it was they were doing in Sherlock's head.
He blinked. “Me? What about me?”
Then he turned back to John who was watching him expectantly.
Sherlock tilted his head, clearly doubtful. "You don't even shift."
He started by sitting down at the victim's desk so he could have a look around the office at all the things Forsythe would have seen every day at work and get an idea of how the man had organised himself. Sherlock started riffling through desk drawers for any interesting papers the police may have overlooked but they seemed to have been very thorough for a change. Considering all the effort he had gone to in coming here, he wasn't sure whether he approved of this sudden diligence.
Sally takes off her coat and shoes and sits down. She looks around for Dante and realises he is curled up in Sherlock's lap, the traitor. Sherlock is idly scratching his chest with his left hand. Sally can hear Dante's gentle purr.
Sherlock snorted. "Want me to bring a tennis ball?"
what he was supposed to do!
"Do you know, I believe we will have to consider getting a dog once you are back to your human form," Sherlock mused. "I'm getting used to having another living being in my bed."
The slow, methodical motion of his arm as he dragged the brush through John's thick fur and the sensation of John's chest expanding and contracting with each breath under his hands was relaxing in a way Sherlock had not anticipated.
John huffed. Well, if that was what it would come down to - being manhandled out of a car by Mycroft Holmes - then he would rather take the risk of a bloody nose, thank you very much.
And Sherlock was still leaning against the wall where John had left him, slowly tilting to the left.
John had hastily clamped a hand over his mouth. "Let's not disturb Greg any further, shall we?"
"Cold," Sally noted.
"A good choice," Judd confirmed. "I will have to enter your mind to get the full picture and to work on the triggers myself. We are trained from a very young age not to let other people in, so this will be very disturbing and uncomfortable for you. Unfortunately, there is no other way. I cannot walk you through it without knowing precisely what we are looking at."
(See the end of the chapter for
When they finally separated, they were on the sofa. Or rather, John was. Sherlock was kneeling above him, sitting in his lap, hands clasped around John's shoulders.
The bed was cold and empty and finally big enough. John sank into it gratefully. It was the first time in far too long that he didn't have to share it with anyone, that he could sprawl as much as he liked. He had been stiff as a board most mornings recently, his muscles aching from the way he had kept himself from moving even in his sleep, unwilling to get too close.
Sherlock looked around for the lab's owner and exchanged a nod with the woman who was just approaching him.
Beyond words, John simply leaned in and kissed him again.
Lestrade gaped at him. "John..."
"Would you like to have it done?"
Something was brewing in the Net, that much was undeniable. There had been an unprecedented number of upsets in recent years. But change took time and, if he continued on his current path, time was not something he would have.
But Sherlock wouldn't look at him. "Nothing."
About an hour later, Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade entered 221b with a feeling of amused dread. Granted, he had only seen Sherlock and John this morning and they had both seemed fine, but who knew what might have happened since then.
He closed his eyes again. After a couple of minutes, Redbeard plopped down next to him, resting his head on Sherlock's stomach. He started petting him absent-mindedly, anchoring himself in the here and now to keep from flying apart under the weight of the past and all the what ifs.
To her endless surprise, Sherlock treats Mary like a, well, like a friend. There is no other word for it. They tease each other, they make jokes at John's expense. Mary laughs at Sherlock about something involving a fake moustache and doesn't seem to notice the tight expression flittering across John's face.
It had been a simple decision to come here. It had taken him two weeks to find the letter and decide if he should bring Rosie, torn between the knowledge that the conversation he had in mind was not going to be helped by having a small child around and the irrational fear of leaving her. He had taken those two weeks off work to spend with her and make sure she felt safe. It would be a while until the nightmares stopped. His more than hers, most likely.
John placed the Advil next to him. "Alright?"
Molly smiled - a thoroughly unfamiliar expression to see on the face of a Psy. "Are you worried John will find a mate and lose them?"
"Yes. Come on, sit with me."
Sherlock's warm skin underneath John's fingertips, his curly hair, his soft lips, the rough scar tissue on his back that neither of them chose to comment on. The sounds he made, half-aborted sighs and gasps and moans of pleasure as John bent himself to the task of learning everything he could about this body that he did not already know. The look in his eyes when John whispered words of love and adoration in his ear. The slick sounds of their bodies moving together, the way their muscles flexed and limbs moved. The way Sherlock threw his head back when he came, fingers clenching around John's shoulder and side, his breath punching out of him.
John barked in agreement.
The hallway looked very much the same, which didn't help the odd sense of vertigo John experienced at the mere thought of returning to what had been - and, if he was entirely honest with himself, still was - home.
"They just arrived," John said, his ears having picked up the familiar sound of a car stopping and a stretcher being brought into this part of the building.
He climbed back into bed and they slid under the covers together, turning towards each other and resuming their earlier position on unspoken agreement.
A cold, uneasy feeling settled in his chest. Had he driven Sherlock away? Three years without a word because John had lashed out in his grief? Three years was a long time to come to terms with what had happened, to understand and acknowledge that it hadn't been Sherlock's fault. He hadn't fired the gun. He hadn't asked Mary to jump in front of a bullet for him. Hell, he would be dead himself if she hadn't. And John, even as he felt like shit for doing so, had to admit that he would have taken Sherlock's death much harder than he had Mary's. And he had managed to loose him anyway.
"Our wedding... doesn't sound like it was very nice," John said lamely.
"I made quite sure you wouldn't," Sherlock said quietly, staring at the floor. "None of this is your fault, John."
Their conversation afterwards and John handing his ring back to him had seemed like yet another sign that things were improving. He knew, or at least suspected, John wasn't happy about the ring's existence on Sherlock's finger. But when he had had the chance to make it disappear, he had given it back to him instead. Surely that had to mean something, right?
Sherlock was still talking and John made an effort to tune back in, to focus on the words. They were limited now.
Ah. Leaving.
John hadn't expected him having an answer readily available. He floundered a bit before replying. "I ... I don't know. You left, Sherlock. You killed yourself and you made me watch. I'm not sure there is any explanation you could possibly give that I would be willing to hear or able to believe."
Sherlock kept his attention on the case board, taking in what little information the Yard had been able to collect. He was aware of several pairs of eyes boring into his back and did his best not to let them bother him. His brother's gaze weighted heaviest of all and that one could not be ignored.
"Not quite," Sherlock was saying, voice muffled. "I could have been, maybe, in a different life. I would have given anything, do you know that? Anything at all. But he never wanted that. You'll learn that one day. Maybe when you're older and it doesn't hurt quite so much, I'll tell you all about it. For now, we must say goodbye... No, don't look at me like that. You've got your daddy's eyes and I never could say no to those."
John followed him.
The detective shrugged. "I was thinking, I didn't notice."
Unfortunately for Sally, her newfound mission is made a lot easier just three days later.
John cursed as he stepped into a puddle, cold water soaking through his right shoe and sock in seconds. He shivered, pulling his coat tighter around himself with his free hand. His left clenched around the handle of his cane as he hurried for the entrance of the supermarket, eager to make it out of the rain.
"I'll live," John said, rolling his eyes. He squeezed Sherlock's hand. "And considering that people already think I'm utterly devoted to you when I don't even do anything, I highly doubt I'll have much difficulty enforcing that idea."
"Good?" he asked, then cleared his throat.
The words came out in a rush, rattled off at top speed, and concluded only when the male was already halfway out the door.
John bounded over to them, dropping the ball at Sherlock's feet and turning to regard the stranger suspiciously. He sniffed his leg for a bit - sweat from running, strong aftershave, and a whole load of pheromones. Of bloody course.
"Good luck." Her voice was soft but he still heard her as he left the kitchen, and their conversation still replayed in his head as he let himself back into his and John's room to find John still fast asleep.
Mrs Hudson sits across from her, the usual plate of biscuits on the table between them. Neither of them reaches for one.
John blinks, nods. "I did. Have you finally done that?"
Mrs Hudson smiled and kissed his cheek even as she squeezed his hands in reassurance. "That's my boy. Go on up now. And remember to say goodbye before you leave."
She never realised that their archivists know about the actual contents of the files, beyond the case number and references, but they do. Sometimes, they know which files she wants to look at before she does and she finds them waiting for her in a neat pile on one of the desks.
He shook his head. "Of course not."
"I'm freezing, John, don't you dare."
*****
"Sherlock..."
"Pardon?"
But the thought hardly registered because John was kissing him and even the Swedish night sky seemed brighter for it. He thought he could hear the air crackling.
*****
"You're not signing the divorce papers," John said again, as if still in disbelief. "Why?"
And yet John wanted him.
It occurred to John that, despite all the upheaval to their lives, Sherlock appeared happier and more relaxed than he had in months. It was hardly surprising, really. If all had gone according to plan, John would be on his honeymoon now and Sherlock would be... well, doing whatever he did when he was alone at home, presumably.
"And hopefully no one will ever have to question it," Mrs Hudson chimed in. "Because as far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather have our John back in the body he belongs."
Sherlock wondered what precisely Mycroft was cooking up that could possibly provide a solution for his not insignificant problem. There were too many variables to consider and while Mycroft wielded impressive power thanks to his position in the Council, he alone would not be enough to protect Sherlock from rehabilitation if the other Councillors grew suspicious. It was a good thing none of them had any reason to focus on London, not when they were dealing with defections of Cardinals in an area where two large and powerful changeling packs continued to gain influence.
He accelerated his pace, ignoring the people who lunged out of his way, the gaping tourists and the click and flash of too many cameras.
He turns around and glares at her. "Is there a point to this? Or did you just feel the need to hear yourself talk?"
"Yes, I saw. Why is it that so many people don't know how to treat a common cold?"
Her eyes dart back and forth between Sherlock, frozen on the sofa, and John, frozen in the doorway.
He moved to the side of the path in order to let them pass and accidentally walked right into Sherlock, who wasn't moving at all. Confused, John looked up at him.
Thank you so much for reading this far, for giving this story a chance and for letting me know what you think about it.
"I dare say," Lestrade muttered. "We were quite despairing of you two. Well, of Sherlock, mostly. Didn't know you were having any doubts, John, until you said so." He coughed. "Well, I'm glad it all seems to have worked out for you."
sat this close to one another on the sofa, that Sherlock had
Thirty-odd years had taught him that it was futile to argue with his mother, so Sherlock lowered his phone and put it on speaker, meeting John's curious gaze and noting his perked ears. "There you go. Don't tell me I didn't warn you."
"Is that what you think happened?" Sherlock asked, letting his shoulders drop. "Two years and four months and you never once wondered...?"
John wanted to tell him.
"Sherlock Holmes, you are the best, kindest man I have ever met. The most brilliant and beautiful, too. I don't deserve you and I haven't given you enough love and adoration, certainly not nearly as much as you deserve. But I will make it up to you if you'll let me. So, in good days and bad, at interesting crime scenes and on boring evenings at home ... be mine?"
John tugged at the handcuffs in a useless attempt to get free but of course Sherlock had handcuffed his dominant hand, making it almost impossible for him to get out even if he happened to find a suitable makeshift lock-pick.
Suddenly unable to bear the sight of Rosie's picture on the white board a moment longer, he stood and marched out of Lestrade's office, seeking refuge in the small, seldom used conference room he and Sherlock had spoken in earlier. It felt as if it had been a lifetime ago, that conversation.
"Believe me, I noticed," the other man said. "There's not too many people here so of course new guests get noticed immediately."
Sherlock frowned, thinking about his question. "I ... am not sure. The possibility of this happening had never occurred to me. I ... am flattered?"
They were quiet again for a bit but this was the most he had ever heard Sherlock say about that elusive husband of his - or anything else concerning his private life - and he was curious.
Sherlock broke.
They stared at the bundle in silence for a couple of seconds, each thinking the same thing.
Lestrade stopped outside the door, waiting for his team to get into position. They weren't using comms for this - the entire team was made up of changelings and their hearing and eyesight was enough to communicate over the short distances provided by this section of the airfield and the hangar.
"Looks like Sherlock Holmes thinks he owes me a favour. What do you think of
And it would - as soon as they got back home, away from this place where there were no reminders of why he couldn't and shouldn't and mustn't.
"Got any plans for the holidays then?" the landlady asks her.
Sherlock frowned. "I don't know."
"Yes. She will pick you up from here whenever you call her and bring him along."
That, at last, made Sherlock stop in front of him. "Why?"
Gasping and cursing, he managed to get upright, leaning against the train carriage until his legs stopped trembling. He thought he might have bruised a rib on the tracks but it hardly mattered. He needed to get to Rosie. He would have time to recover later.
"It's so nice to have you here," Mrs Hudson says, hovering in the doorway. "I'm glad I never got around to furnishing it, besides the kitchen - your brothers certainly made quick work of getting all your furniture here and setting it up."
"This is the one I found," he said and dropped it onto Lestrade's desk. The information inside was identical.
She shrugged again. "Whatever. It's your funeral."
Shaking his head in resignation, John left Sherlock to his own thoughts and promptly found his gaze once again drawn to the way the flashing lights were reflected in the drops of water on his best friend's neck and in his hair. Thanks to one of the medics having handed Sherlock a towel, his hair at least was more damp than wet, the thoroughly mussed strands regaining their usual curly form in a way that made John's fingers itch with the irrational need to gently tug on them to see if they would spring back into place.
Sherlock heard and felt the mattress move as John shifted and a moment later his warm hands were back on Sherlock’s back, both of them this time, pressed to his shoulder blades. Blunt, warm fingers skimmed over the smaller scars there, an index finger pressing into the five burn scars down his spine, one after the other. One, two, three, four, five.
"Wouldn't you like to know?" He smiled and took a large step backwards. "If you ever decide to stop denying yourself, perhaps you'll find out."
They spent two hours in Regent's Park where Sherlock threw the tennis ball until his arm hurt and John flopped down on the ground at his feet, panting heavily and making it very clear that if Sherlock threw the ball again, he would have to bloody well go and fetch it himself. They moved to the nearest unoccupied bench to rest and people-watch.
Sherlock searched his gaze for any hint of a lie but couldn't find any. John had always been honest about everything except the lies he told himself.
Sherlock nodded. "Of course, John."
"I was happy," John said softly, tearing him from his thoughts. "Bloody furious, damn right, but also happy. You have no idea what it did to me, Sherlock. Watching you jump and being unable to do anything to save you. And seeing you alive ... I thought I was dreaming. I thought someone had clubbed me over the head with something heavy and this was it. And I was fine with that. I thought I had at least gotten to see you again."
Sherlock saw John's portion of fried rice drop from the chopsticks of his suddenly limp hand.
"Huh? Oh, the ring. On our wedding day, actually. I have a jeweller who owed me a favour."
Sherlock Holmes, 11:54
John groaned and thrust into Sherlock’s hand again. “Sh-Sherlock.”
Mycroft was right about one thing, though. The tension really was thick enough to choke on. He could almost hear Sherlock's muscles winding ever tighter, and he could definitely smell the hormones radiating off of him. A new wave of them clouded the air every time Sherlock ran his hand through his hair, thoroughly messing up his curls and making it absolutely clear that a cold shower was no longer going to suffice.
"What?"
He uses the time to get to know this little human, so helpless and trusting. There is a growth table in his head now that gets updated every evening, a list of new accomplishments right next to it. He never realised they learned so fast. He never realised they were quite so fragile or that one of their tiny hands wrapped around his finger has more power than physics could ever hope to explain.
Here was something Sherlock wanted, rather desperately, and not only had John initiated all of this by kissing him instead of letting him go like a sensible person, he was also not raising any objections to any of this. The only thing raised, as far as Sherlock could tell, was John's interest. The evidence was rather compelling.
Sherlock shrugs. "Reasonably fine." A pause. "Thinking."
He pulled John along until he found the one item he had been looking for and turned him towards the showcase. "I dare you to beat that one."
He looked a bit bleary, as anyone would when waking up in the middle of the night, and John, frozen where was, could see the moment Sherlock's sleep-addled mind processed the sight of John in front of him and the sensation of John's hand on his cheek.
John continued to look puzzled.
John listened to his progress down the stairs and his short exchange with the delivery boy ("Here's your foo-" - "Here's your money. Goodbye.") and the sound of the door slamming before Sherlock returned up the stairs.
It was so obvious now, how tightly he had held himself together, how close he was to shattering into a million pieces. Sherlock wanted to step forward, to reach out, do something, anything, to hold John together. But he kept his feet firmly planted, pressed his shoulders to the wall with a bit more force than necessary, curled his twitching fingers into fists. He was not the person to comfort John anymore. John had made that very clear and Sherlock wasn't keen on a repetition.
John sank heavily onto the closest chair.
"Home," Sherlock echoed, humming in contentment. Every single
Sherlock, of course, kept bugging him about it. Nothing overt, of course, he was far too subtle for that, but John knew he was keeping an eye on him, as if John would just say "Oh to hell with this" and shift in the middle of their sitting room.
Lestrade groaned. "This is why we have a contract between all the London packs. If more than one pack is affected by a crime, DuskKeeper has jurisdiction. Thank god. Otherwise we'd have a pack war on our hands every other week."
“The largest, I believe,” Sherlock said, smirking. “An attraction like this, of course they’d want to display it front and centre.”
*****
Again, something about the way he spoke must have tipped her off. He sometimes forgot how perceptive Molly was.
Thank you for the shouting and crying in my inbox, for the compliments ("you fantastic murderer", "you brilliant monster") that will end up on my imaginary CV. Thank you for the gorgeous cover art (CHECK OUT THE COVER ART YOU GUYS!) and the all-caps screaming in the comments.
or whatever it was people in the country did that required them getting up at the crack of dawn
For a moment, he feared it would bring reality crashing back around them but then Sherlock’s gaze met his, his eyes wide and dark with desire and John promptly forgot what he had been worried about.
"Just making sure. She said there wasn't much to do in her department as the police had taken all the files, which only proves my theory. Ms Conall had a lovely new pair of diamond studs. Bit inappropriate to wear to work with everyone in mourning for the CEO and his son, isn't it? Then there is of course the fact that she tried to enter Forsythe senior's office while I was in there this morning even though she must have known it would be locked. The first time I paid the company a visit, she was standing at the reception, talking on the phone with her mother. She was speaking French and saying that she had been overlooked for promotion several times already and thought that it was highly likely she would finally get one soon. With the two company heads dead, there's certainly a staff shake-up coming. I'm afraid she'll not get to enjoy it very much from prison."
She can't tell them everything, not while the case is still open, but she can tell them the important stuff. And she knows neither Molly nor Mrs Hudson would ever talk to the media about any of this.
"And all of this because of some project from twenty years ago?" Major Barrymore sounded torn between disbelief and annoyance.
Greg had to admit he was right about that. Which brought him back to the result of this unfortunate situation.
Sherlock frowned, now puzzled himself. "Excuse me?"
'," Sherlock sniffed. "And we do not
He went and switched off the lights in the rest of the flat while Sherlock disappeared into the bathroom, neither of them drawing attention to it being only nine pm. Far too early for either of them to want to sleep.
"When you suggested going on holiday over Christmas, this is not what I pictured," John complained, teeth chattering.
But he held back. He had to, this time, because he knew John wouldn't like his theory and he knew John would definitely overreact if Sherlock so much as mentioned it.
John had to nip down the stairs to ask Mrs Hudson for some flour as an excuse to hug her, which he did for far longer than necessary, but he managed to keep from finding excuses to touch Sherlock. It was difficult and went against his entire nature. He tried to remind himself that he and Sherlock never used to touch before this experiment, either.
It's clear to John from the look on Sherlock's face that he isn't listening to a word the man is saying. All his attention is on someone across the room, though he manages to nod and smirk convincingly as the man prattles on.
"Guess he had to get it from somewhere," Lestrade muttered once Sherlock had finally hung up.
He wasn't quite sure why the Swedes had decided to put up a 12-metre straw goat in their Castle Square for Christmas. Surely a reindeer would have been a better choice? Sherlock, however, seemed to find the entire thing fascinating, and had been muttering about chicken wire and access points.
Walking hurt but he walked on. His ribs ached with the weight of holding a child against them but he would rather have broken each and every one of them than to let her go.
"No?"
John reminded himself sternly.
Half a foot away, Sherlock was staring at his hand on the closed door as if it and the door would vanish and allow him through if he stared hard enough. He must have heard John but clearly had no intention of replying. John watched his throat work and thought that perhaps Sherlock was choking, too.
John had skipped two shifts at the clinic for this case and they had pulled an all-nighter at 221b together, trying to find the evidence they needed in the victim's e-mail correspondence.
He waited until they were safely back inside their flat before breaking the heavy silence.
"Fine," Sherlock snapped. "Fine. You tell him that. In those words precisely. Don't even think about sugarcoating what you just said to me. If he agrees, so will I. Otherwise, you can stuff it."
Even the drive home had been quiet and filled with an odd tension John knew he wasn't the only one aware of. Every now and then, he had stolen a glance or two in Sherlock's direction only to find him looking very serious. Once or twice, he thought he caught a flash of dread in those iridescent eyes when Sherlock didn't manage to look away in time.
John carefully followed the trail of Sherlock's scent towards the door. It hadn't been closed properly and he glanced through the gap, making out some sort of anteroom and another open door leading further inside. He shouldered the door open just enough to squeeze through.
"That's true," John conceded, licking his lips. "I would in that case."
"Yes." There was no point denying it.
John had the unexpected pleasure of seeing the great, unmovable Sherlock Holmes blush.
Sherlock beams at him. "Only because you noticed the angle of the bruise was wrong."
John sighed. “Fine. You win. But I insist on having ice cream once we’re there.”
Mr Hendriksen was still gaping at him. "You are Sherlock Holmes?"
They lay in silence for a while. It was better than sleeping on his own, John thought, though he couldn't help but notice that not a lot of sleeping was happening now, either.
John rummaged for his laptop and settled into his armchair to update the blog with a third-person account of how Sherlock had apparently gotten a dog to look after while he had been away and how sad he was to have missed it but that he had received some brilliant pictures and would you look at how adorable they were?!
And yet Sherlock didn't seem impressed or particularly pleased. Instead, his comments once the people trying to chat him up had left sounded increasingly annoyed. John could actually smell the discomfort radiating off of his friend. The women trying to talk to Sherlock under the guise of petting his cute dog had all but drowned in pheromones but John hadn't smelled even a hint of any such thing from Sherlock.
His own mind wouldn't let him live in denial for long.
"Not the only thing I'm worried about here," John said. "But good to know. Get ready."
His eyes are serious, too, and she knows he'll back her no questions asked.
