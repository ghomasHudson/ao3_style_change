Dean stretches and yawns, his gorgeously nude body perpetually distracting, but Castiel keeps his focus and goes into his office. There’s a manilla folder of printed research and articles, some of which he’s penned himself, and he grabs the materials and heads back into the kitchen. He finds Dean kneeling on his pillow, and his Dom heart swells a little at the sight, but he says, “I meant in an actual chair, actually.”
Castiel loosens his grip on Dean’s hand, fighting to remain in control of his temper. “The rule isn’t stupid, I can assure you. It’s the furthest thing from it,” Castiel says coldly. “If I’m keeping you at arm’s length, Dean, it’s because I know what’s best—”
“If you’ll excuse me, it’s been a long day and I have other business to attend to,” Castiel says briskly, standing and pulling at his jacket by the cuffs. Dean follows suit, standing and shooting Castiel an approving smile.
“What was that, pet?” one of the Doms mocks. “No one named ‘Cas’ here, sub. You need to learn that good subs only speak when spoken to.” A punch to his gut has him wheezing and coughing and trying to curl in on himself.
“C-Castiel is…he's…coming,” he pants, catching his breath.
“Good, needy little pets only get what they want when they ask for it.” Dean blinks up at the face staring down at him and is overwhelmed but the look of desire, lust, and awe on Cas’ face. “Feel free to come up and get a better look, just remember, no one lays a finger on him.” Dean doesn’t think anyone would challenge a threat like that. He hears the shuffle of feet and sees the crowd move to form a circle around them. People whispering and laughing sharing drinks. Several with subs of their own at their sides. He feels even more small and exposed like this. He loses track of Cas for a moment and when he finds him again, he’s standing between Dean’s splayed open legs, a riding crop in-hand and devilish look on his angelic face.
“Nghhhhhh,” Dean sobs. “Cas!”
“Is this it?” Castiel asks as he places a hand on the blanket over the bench.
“That won’t be a problem. I will be taking on his training from here on out,” Castiel announces, and Dean looks up at the Dom in shock.
Dean applied more of the Beta blocking spray and popped his heat suppressant pills before heading out the door. With any luck he would have a paying job by nightfall and he was putting coffee maker top on his list of shit to get with his first paycheck.
“Really? That’s great…she really is the best, yes… Alright, we can touch base tomorrow… Thank you.” Castiel hangs up his call. It’s almost midnight.
“Apologies,” Castiel says dryly, polishing off his drink in one remaining gulp. It’s his second one in the last hour…or perhaps his third? “Dean is also incredibly smart, an overprotective older brother like you, and an…Aquarius, I believe? Though you know I put little stock in astrology. Oh, and he’s the best kisser in the state of Kansas. Maybe America…or the world.”
“I can see that. Your body is so wonderfully responsive. Seems like the perfect time to work on controlling those physical responses.” Castiel’s voice holds a bit of wicked promise to it. Dean holds his breath, still looking at the ground and unable to meet his Dom’s eyes. The need to submit is vibrating through him, and he really needs to just be a good boy and let Cas be in charge for a bit.
Dean grips the ladder under him and reaches up to grab the pushed-back rolls of duct tape when he hears someone clearing their throat behind him. He turns to look down and sees a man staring up him with neatly combed dark hair and deep blue eyes.
“I think he’s on board with that plan. Look at that weeping cock, making such a mess out of those pretty panties already. He’s wetter than a real bitch.” Dean flushes, knowing his cock is now hard and leaking onto his lace. “What do you think, Knight? Should I warm up this skin a bit before I plow this fine ass?”
Castiel closes his eyes, feeling suddenly tired from the two beers. He doesn’t have the time or energy to explain to Hannah how much that’s just a surface level interpretation of him, how there are so many other layers few people get to see. Mostly, people tend to think that confident, dominating personalities like Castiel have no insecurities…but, at least in Cas’ experience, it’s quite the opposite. Since he was a child he’s felt different—too straightforward for most social situations, too involved in his own world to get jokes or pop culture references. His polished demeanor doesn’t come naturally to Cas…in some ways, it’s a carefully crafted persona. Only his brother and Dean have truly seen below the surface.
“No!” Dean interrupts. “I mean, no Sir. I’m awake for pie.” He decides to give Castiel his best puppy dog eyes, and it earns him a hearty laugh.
His body shivers under the assault as Cain’s words reach his ears.
Castiel lets out a huff or relief. “Honestly, that’s a welcome idea. I was feeling overwhelmed with the prospect of hitting the ground running today.”
“It’s ancient history, brother.”
Dean 1:42 PM >>
“What do you want, baby?” Castiel says, breath skating across Dean’s lips. “Anything. I’ll give you anything.”
Maybe it’s time for Castiel to change that.
“No, it would not,” Castiel tells him, though internally, the image of Dean naked and waiting on his bed is much more enticing than it should be. Perhaps he’s going into a rut soon… He should check his calendar. That would be the only reason this omega is affecting him. “I can assure you of that. This would strictly be a white-collar contract."
“Wait up, old man,” he calls, pating Sam on the shoulder and jogging to help Cas before he gives himself a hernia.
Dean lets out a longer-than-necessary sigh. “Thank you for cooking, Sam…now maybe next time we can have something without kale in it.” He says the last bit under his breath, but Sam still shoots him a death glare. Dean snaps a picture of his plate and sends it off to FlyBoy.
“Oh fuck!” Dean cries out, and feels his orgasm tear through him at just the touch of Castiel’s hands on him. Dean’s body clamps down harder, his balls pulled up tight, and he hears a strangled sound as Castiel stills on a final thrust.
His phone buzzes again and again, till finally he glances down and sees that it’s a call from Bobby. Relief rushes over him as he scrambles to answer the phone.
“Do it, please,” he sub begs, jutting his hips backwards in a pleading motion. “Want you to fill me up, Master.”
So it’s time to have “the talk” about whether you wanna pursue another contract with your dom. Billie and I have talked and we wanna be sure you two are alright with whatever decision you come to. Would you be open to meeting here at the club? We can schedule it on Friday night if you’re free, just let me know and I can have Billie reach out to your dom.
Medic67 10:45 PM <<
“I told you we just didn’t want to tell anyone ‘till we knew it was serious. There’s always been something between us, but we were always with other people or busy with school, and now... I dunno, it just seemed like it was worth a shot, you know? She makes me happy, Dean.” Sam smiles now, a bit of a goofy grin. Fuck, if that doesn’t stop Dean’s growing anger right in its tracks. Who the hell is he to judge Sam for keeping a secret? He is the king of motherfucking secrets.
Castiel knows that what this man needs, more than anything, is to surrender to his submissive instincts and let himself be dominated by someone he trusts, someone he can confide in.
It takes him a few moments to find his voice again, “I guess we’ll find out.” He knows he can’t keep putting it off, that it's not fair to Cas to lead him along without knowing everything.
“So big, Master, so full,” he cries when Castiel bottoms out in one fluid motion. He’s never been this eager to fuck like a goddamn piston, it’s like his heart is pumping purely adrenaline, but he counts to fifty before he begins to move. He pulls out and slams in experimentally, and his sub whines and begs for more. Castiel, a merciful dom, would love
“Good. You're doing much better, Dean. I am proud of you.” Cain’s praise feels like mainlining the best drugs invented. He stays on the porch till Cain’s truck is gone from view, before eventually crawling back into the house. He snags his cell phone from a basket in the front hall that Cain made him put it in when he was working around the house. He flips it open to see a text from Dr. Barnes, again checking in on him. He crawls to the living room and sits with his back against the couch, looking over the bandages on his feet. The cuts aren’t deep, just tender.
Castiel tries to follow the thread of conversation, his forehead wrinkling. “You had to tell me something?” She nods mutely, wide eyes filling with tears. “Tell me what?”
“I really don’t need this thing, I can walk,” he grumbles, shifting in his seat and trying to hide his half chub. Just being near Cas again has his body responding in really embarrassing ways. He hasn’t actually come since he was with Cas, and his damn dick is finding that
“I think I’m adorable,” Dean scoffs, with a cocky confidence he doesn’t feel.
“Yes, well, if I knew you frequented it often, I would’ve chosen another bar,” he says snippily.
“Yeah, yeah. Back in his single days, Cassie was just jealous that I got more ass than a toilet seat,” Gabriel says with a smirk. “But I’m tied down now. Got a girl back home—Kali.”
“Same old, same old. I was beginning to think your brother lied about you coming home. Too good to swing by and visit an old man?” Bobby could lay on the guilt better than any mother he’d ever heard of.
Dean isn’t sure what he means and pulls back to look at him. His eyes are still shining, with that same sad smile across his face. “Cas?”
“Cas is hardly a boy, Bobby,” Dean rolls his eyes, “but yeah, he’s coming any minute.”
“Yes?” Cain asks briskly, barely opening the door. “It’s a little late for visitors.”
“I won’t say it again—”
“So good for me,” Castiel whispers. “Gonna feel so tight on my cock.”
Castiel just shrugs—there’s nothing going on in the real world that feels as devastating as the hole Dean’s left inside of him.
“Oh, uh…sorry. Thought you were Sammy,” he answers, getting his thumb stuck in the tie and tugging at it like an idiot.
Dean hesitates a moment. “He will be.” It's the best answer he can give because he isn’t gonna let it be any other way.
“If you didn’t take him to Purgatory, where the hell did you take him?” he demands.
The prayer burned through him like a touch of Grace, lit him up like a livewire. He couldn't keep from smiling as he appeared before Dean, standing with his arms outstretched, face cast to the sky. "Prayer is a sign of faith," he said, announcing his presence. Dean spun around, looking more than a little surprised that his prayer had been answered. "This is a good thing, Dean."
This did not clarify anything for Castiel. "I am at a loss, Dean. I do not know what I have done to anger you."
She was remarkably persistent in her attempts to peel back the veil as he struggled to keep it shut around him. He tried to tell her through the connection to stop, that his true form was not meant for mortal eyes to see, but she pushed on, poking holes and circumventing all his attempts to keep her out. Eventually, she got through, and after a horrific shriek of pain, the link finally dissipated. Too late again.
Sam's screams reminded him of Hell.
Castiel did not dare dignify that with a response, mostly because he had no idea what Dean was referring to. "I've heard whispers," he continued, "that he's walking the earth. This is a rare opportunity."
Castiel chose to sit down, to settle himself on Dean's level and begin again. Not on Sam's bed, of course; it rankled of demon blood. But he stiffly lowered himself down on an acceptable spot at the foot of Dean's bed, nestled among the twisted sheets and haphazardly tossed clothing.
When Castiel was resistant, she continued to hammer in her point, and her words felt like knives, like he was the one being chained to a rack, stripped and flayed to his core. "The Father you love, you think he wants this? You think he'd ask this of you? You think this is righteous? What you're
. And given the option, I'd like to think I'd choose it again."
Dean was seated at the small work desk in the ocean themed motel room far from any shore, flipping through his father's journal, leather jacket draped over his shoulders. "Hello, Dean," Castiel greeted, and he jumped, only relaxing again once he had turned in his seat and saw who was standing behind him.
"At the moment, yes." And it was the truth. While he worried about his brothers, while the car was cramped and loud and not his preferred method of travel, there was no one else he would rather be driving with towards his probable demise than Dean.
"He is out there, Dean," Castiel insisted.
It occurred to him, belatedly, that it probably would have been more efficient to place the body above ground.
"You're in luck. He just called me after finishing off a vamp nest." Bobby travelled over to the kitchen, where he first ripped a sticky note off the wall that had been hanging next to an assortment of labeled phones. Then, he rifled through one of the cabinets before pulling out a beat up cellphone. He handed both to Castiel. "You'll find him at this address, and have him teach you how to set up a phone while you're at it. Can't guarantee that I won't shoot next time."
To ease some of his loneliness, he tried the trick that Anna taught him to listen in on the other angels without them becoming aware of his presence. He couldn't hear everything like before, and a lot of it came through almost staticky and garbled, but he was able to latch onto more important information. Nothing about God's whereabouts, of course, since most either didn't know he was gone or didn't count on him coming back, but at least every so often, he was able to get word on how the war in Heaven was going. Usually, it was not good, but he preferred it to having absolutely no idea while sitting on the sidelines.
"What? No! Not the...no, Cas. The amulet."
Dean considered this for a long, tense moment, then sighed heavily. "Fine," he said resignedly.
He started his flight immediately, only to remember about halfway there that he, once again, had no idea where Dean actually was. He swiftly redirected his course to South Dakota, where he found Bobby Singer buried in about three stacks of books on Apocalypse lore. He had barely landed before he found himself staring down the barrel of a gun. Bobby narrowed his glare when he realized who had spontaneously appeared in his living room, but he lowered the weapon all the same. "Would it kill you to knock?" he grumbled.
Tired for the first time in his life from flying all over the globe, Castiel stopped to sit in a small church pew and rest. There were few other people around, most with their heads bowed in prayer who had not even noticed his sudden appearance. He was not foolish enough to try and pray. It was far more likely that the angels would intercept before it ever had a chance of reaching God.
"What is so worth saving?" Castiel asked, his voice rising in spite of himself. "I see
"Possibly, yes." Castiel fought to keep his voice even as he turned back around and continued lying. Whatever it took to secure Heaven's champion. It would all be worth it in the end. "But as you know, he'd have to take certain steps."
Castiel had to admit that he held very little love in his heart for Sam Winchester, but his cries for help were heart wrenching enough that he couldn't help but wonder if the boy really deserved this fate. He was an abomination in Heaven's eyes, in
"An Enochian sigil," Castiel replied. "It'll hide you from every angel in creation, including Lucifer."
"If anything threatens a Prophet, anything at all, an archangel will appear to destroy that threat," Castiel explained. "Archangel's are fierce. They're absolute. They're Heaven's most terrifying weapon." He leveled his gaze at Dean, willing him to understand, and finally, he watched the gears turning behind his eyes until the words clicked in his mind.
He only made a quick pit stop along the way to take care of some demons that had been threatening his charge. Easy, low level vermin, nothing like what had been thrown at him in Hell. It didn't even take a second.
"Maybe. So you think that was another destiny thing?" he said, half-joking.
"To everything there is a season," Castiel recited in reply. It was heartwarming, truly, how much he cared for complete strangers. In fact, it was one of the few moments Castiel had glimpsed where on a surface-level, Dean was the righteous man that was prophecied. But his compassion here was, ultimately, misguided.
Instead of news from the front, however, he heard of an interesting development here on earth. Raphael had taken a vessel to quell a skirmish in a small town in America, the kind of place the Winchesters usually loved to investigate. If anyone could give him information on his quest to find their Father, it would be an archangel, and if anyone could help him get that information, it would be Dean.
"Because I do." Dean leveled his gaze at him, and Castiel could see the sincerity behind his eyes. "Listen, man, it's just that...I've done the whole 'searching for a deadbeat dad' bit before, and it's not worth it. The only thing you're gonna find at the end of that road is disappointment."
Uriel continued rapturously, practically singing Lucifer's praises, and all his hymns fell on deaf ears. "Now, if you want to believe in something, Cas, believe in him."
"Sister, please. It is of utmost importance that I return to Earth immediately," he told her.
"How can you be so sure?" Castiel pried.
He was horrifically stubborn, distrustful, irreverent, and faithless. Castiel had known all of this going in and knew that underneath all of that was a good man, but his surface level bravado was so irritating that it would have been easy to forget. Angels didn't forget, of course, unless they needed to, but he was quickly realizing why his brothers preferred to keep their distance from humanity.
Dean wasn't too thrilled with his answer. "Oh, so I'm your bullet shield."
"Dean, this is not your fault," Castiel interrupted.
"For wanting to feel?"
"I didn't," Castiel informed him. "I'm not a mind reader, Dean. I only know what I saw of your soul before I placed you back in your body. If I had known, I would have never..." As Dean waited for him to continue, something like remorse rankled inside Castiel. His orders had been to keep Dean in line, and Heaven's orders were always just, but no one had placed the words in his mouth. That was his own folly. "I should never have threatened to return you to that place. I am sorry."
. He was far too important, and Castiel had gone through far too much effort to retrieve him to simply toss him back into the Pit.
If nothing else, Dean appeared to be comfortable going about his business in this setting, so Castiel thought it best to take an interest in what he was doing. Humans usually found that flattering, correct? He wandered closer to the desk, where he could watch as Dean methodically flipped through the worn pages of John Winchester's journal every couple of seconds. He opened his mouth to comment about a slight inaccuracy on the page regarding Skinwalkers when Dean tensed up and pulled the book closer to him.
body. A vessel that was the very embodiment of the soul it contained, perfectly reflective of the greatness it would go on to possess. Otherwise, his whole mission would have been for naught.
He burst in, too late again, but soon enough to save his life. Impossibly, Alastair had broken free. Castiel had scouted the location himself, bent the metal to build the rack with his own hands, and had painstakingly checked every stray mark in the Enochian devil's trap. He shouldn't have been able to escape, not in a million years, but here he was, impaling Castiel on a rusty nail while Dean bled out on the floor.
Dean seemed to believe it, but Castiel could not bring himself to, so he needled, trying to push down Dean's walls. Trying to get him to ask him to stay. "Even without your brother?"
Dean, not your brother. The only question for us is whether you're willing to accept it. Stand up, and accept your role," he prompted. "You are the one who will stop it."
It was not cowardice, he told himself later. Nor had that been anger burning in his chest, stirred by Dean's barbed words that hit a little too close to half-formed thoughts in the back of his mind. And he most definitely did not feel jealousy towards another angel that Dean suddenly held in higher regard than Castiel.
, he came face to face with Dean Winchester, the body he had crafted from nothing, the soul he had plucked from Hell. He was beautiful, the product of years of creation all leading up to this moment, to the glorious destiny he had before him. "Who are you?" Dean asked, leveling a defiant glare.
"Stopping the Apocalypse," Anna clarified. "We two aren't the only ones to question the orders we were given. Some didn't even have the chance."
Dean cast him a lopsided grin. "Any chance I could get that in writing?"
"Drive."
"So, what? Uriel can read minds? I thought you said angels couldn't do that."
"I'm making a choice. I'm setting things right."
Dean stood so that he was eye level with Castiel. "I'm sorry. Did I make you angry? I thought that wasn't allowed," he hissed through clenched teeth.
"Well, I
." A flash of something, a memory lost, a sunlit smile, but he forced it away. "Even with Sam."
It seemed that he needn't have worried, as by the time he did reach Dean, curled on the floor at the mercy of Zachariah, he already knew. Also, he had suddenly developed a rather serious case of stomach cancer. And if he wasn't mistaken, poor Sam gasping in the corner had been completely deprived of his lungs.
"God left me. You did not," he answered simply. "I've waited eons to meet him. I do not think a few more days can hurt."
"Yes."
Castiel racked his brain. He remembered all of these events; he'd been around since the dawn of time. He could picture each one clearly in his mind, the death and the destruction, but what he couldn't place was his role in all of them. He remembered them as clearly as if he'd been there, yet he couldn't remember if he actually had been.
"I do that, we will all be hunted. We'll all be killed!" Or worse. The thought set him trembling. He wasn't supposed to feel, but he was all too aware of his own fear. Fear of Falling. Fear of the pain.
"Your soul."
Dean cleared his throat to force back the laughter when Castiel glared at him. "Here, Cas. Try again with my pole, and I'll get yours down." As he passed by, Dean swapped their fishing poles before stepping back to a safe distance to untangle the line.
Nothing had gone according to plan. Not interrogating Raphael. And certainly not Dean's attempts to get him laid.
Locking eyes with him, Castiel told Dean, "I'm going to take us out of here, okay?" He gave the barest nod in response, and Castiel pressed two fingers to his forehead. The nightmare that had been Dean's Hell melted away instantly, replaced with a warm breeze rustling autumn colored leaves and the cool lap of water against a wooden dock.
Dean, who deserved better. Deserved to know what was coming. Deserved, for once, a choice in deciding his fate.
"Yes. A choice he will make. Not you. Angels do not make choices," Naomi scolded. "You are here because you expressed disobedience. You understand why we can't have that, not when the true battle is so close at hand, not when angels like Uriel would support our greatest adversary?"
"Dean," Castiel began softly. He could fix this. He had to fix this. They had fought before. He just had to try and make him understand.
"I love it when a plan comes together. Don't you?" Balthazar said, rubbing his hands together conspiratorially.
The ground quaking and the windows of the small convenience store shattering were to be expected, of course; this was just a natural effect of his true voice, but he certainly hadn't meant to send Dean crashing to the floor in pain. He wondered at first if he had messed up somehow in recreating his body, but no, he was too precise to allow such a mistake. It was far more likely that he was going through some sort of readjustment period and was therefore much too sensitive at the moment to listen to an angel. Still, it was probably for the best that Castiel seek out a vessel for the time being, just in case.
This felt like Hell.
"Yes."
Dean considered this a moment, but then he asked the question Castiel had been dreading. "Is it true? Did I break the first seal? Did I start all of this?"
A man beside her nodded. "I was placed in Heaven's dungeon for a mistake that led to humanity's suffering. All I ever wanted was an opportunity to make it right, but I was never allowed."
"Are you alright?" Castiel asked, even though he already knew the answer.
He traveled to various places of worship, churches, temples, statues, and even holy ground, places where humans had felt His divine light, but the pendant remained plain and cold in his hands. If God was not in places where they sung His praises, He could be just about anywhere, just watching, observing, waiting.
Castiel resisted the urge to fidget underneath Dean's gaze, the truth wanting to claw its way out of his throat. But he remembered the pain, and that was worse. "I thank you for your commitment to our service," was all he said. He flew away before he had the chance to fall apart again.
He was grateful to realize that he was offered a lot more freedom when he flew, even with the body and its resident soul now tethered to him. He was actually a little disappointed to rematerialize outside a remote barn, and a little ashamed to realize that he stumbled a bit upon the landing. Apparently, human bodies are not necessarily meant to fold across space and time, and snapping back into it after the ride was a particularly jarring experience. He rolled his shoulders, readjusting to the skin and the bones and the air, and marched forward determinedly.
mind, per se," Castiel replied, "however, anyone else could choose to listen in on your dreams." Dean shifted uncomfortably at that. "I thought that much was obvious."
"Then they should see you even better than I do."
"Didn't think you would."
That was until Dean followed up with, "Then how are you back?"
"Yeah, I guess so," Dean answered, and Castiel smiled down at the amulet, happy to have finally understood something. "I wear it, and I remember no matter how much I've fucked up, I at least did something right in raising that kid, even if he gets on my nerves all the time. And I think, at least I like to think, that maybe he sees me still wearing it and knows that no matter how much we've fought, I still care about him."
Castiel told him the truth without hesitation; he owed Dean that much, with the magnitude of what he was asking of him. "My superiors have begun to question my sympathies."
This felt different, however. He was asleep, for one thing, instead of on a hunt. But this felt far worse than just any old nightmare that humans tended to have.
The mood almost immediately soured. Dean, who had been content to mouth along to the words of the song, suddenly went very still, his eyes focusing almost too intently on the road ahead. "I couldn't trust him. Not after everything," he admitted. "And it was too dangerous to work together with me constantly looking over my shoulder to make sure he hasn't suddenly fallen off the wagon. Sam agreed, said he needed time to get his head straight."
"Anna has always been stronger than I am. Without my connection to Heaven, my Grace is fading." Castiel pressed a hand to his chest once again, feeling it thrumming beneath his heartbeat to once again steady himself.
He expected Dean to start yelling at him again, to demean his intelligence and his Father in a thousand other ways, but instead, the first words out of his mouth were, "Are you okay?" There was a pause, as Castiel was too stunned to answer. "I mean, really? I know a lot has happened since-"
"At the cost of our brothers and sisters." He turned to address the other eyes watching them. "At the cost of your lives? I made my choice; I am gone. I would not wish the same fate upon any of you."
The ghost of a smile crossed Dean's lips. "All things considered, I'd say we're doing pretty alright for ourselves." Sam looked like he wanted to protest that, which was fair, considering a moment ago he hadn't been able to breathe. "What about you?"
"And I didn't even believe in destiny until you jerks showed up and told me I had one," Dean shot back. "But no one will tell me what it is. You fly in, tell me I'm special, refuse to tell me why, and expect me to do whatever you ask because of that and I'm starting to feel like I'm being jerked around. Like this is one big cosmic joke."
"I'm not sure what I can do," Castiel told him.
“Give me the damn pen.” He holds out his hand, and Sam gives a little laugh of relief as he hands Dean the pen with a shaking hand.
“Did you…?” Castiel pauses, listening to Led Zeppelin and feeling suddenly smug. “Dean, did you make a mixtape—for us to have sex to?”
CB: Which is why we worked so hard to write this chapter for you guys.
. Castiel wonders fleetingly if Crowley actually attended that many years of advanced law training, or if he simply bought himself honorary degrees. It’s the sort of snarky comment that Dean would’ve loved, and Castiel chuckles and pushes forward inside, letting the receptionist know he’s here. Eventually he’s escorted down a dark, mahogany hallway, and into a spacious office with an ornate window and fireplace. Sitting behind the desk in a ridiculously expensive suit is Crowley.
The following day can’t pass soon enough, but before long, he finds himself at the club, sipping an old fashioned at the bar. He came earlier than he meant to but he was just dying to get out of the house and see his blue-eyed sex god of a dom. He feels eyes on him more than normal, which okay, he rarely sits at the bar here so it’s understandable. He also decided to keep things simple in a tight black tee and his favorite light-wash, ripped denim jeans that are just a little too tight. It’s one of his favorite concert outfits actually, but he also knows how good it makes his ass look.
“Think someone’s a lightweight before dinner,” he teases, his gaze nothing but affectionate.
, with green eyes and freckles and the softest lips he’s ever kissed. Dean, who’s fierce and funny and loyal to a fault. Dean, who can turn him on or make him angry as easily as flipping a light switch. Dean, who comforts him and cares for him and takes care of his alpha in every way imaginable.
Dean’s gaze turns astonished, eyebrows shooting up and mouth curved into a small smile. “You’re kinda amazing, you know that?”
Medic67 12:41 AM <<
“I’m sure you’ll be glad to see your family.”
“Some white knight you are,” Dean grumbles petulantly.
Castiel’s meeting with the Italian manufacturers is as dry as he expected. After just twenty minutes on the conference line, he has a splitting headache. There are too many voices on the call—for some reason, they’ve deemed it necessary to include every manager and production head the company has, which is far too many. When an hour passes by and he’s barely had the opportunity to contribute two words, he fires off an email to his point of contact and excuses himself from the call. He’s paid quite handsomely for his time, upwards of four hundred dollars an hour, so if they want to include him on long conference calls it shouldn’t bother him. But it’s Sunday evening, and weekends always make him feel slightly more domestic—though he works three hundred and sixty-five days a year. He can’t remember the last time he’s taken a day off.
“I thought we agreed you couldn’t ‘Hans Solo’ me in bed,” Castiel complains, and Dean snorts, pulling away to look into his alpha’s eyes.
“You’d look perfect stretched around my knot, sweet omega,” he breathes, cock still knocking against Dean’s ass as his fingers travel down, seeking his hole—
Everything is about to change.
Castiel chuckles unexpectedly, thinking Gabriel would probably enjoy Bobby’s peculiar attitude. They small talk for a moment about the weather, the fish, and the lake—which is called Mary’s Lake, incidentally. It seems fitting that this non-funeral event for John Winchester would include a homage to his wife, whose death changed her family’s lives forever.
“I’m not trying to forget, I’m just trying…” Castiel trails off, shrinking in on himself a little and closing the cabinet with a weak thud. After everything that happened outside the school, after the reveal that’s shaken him more than he ever expected, he’s not sure how to move forward. Medic67—Dean—said he’s in love with him. But how could that be, when he’s met Castiel the dom and knows Castiel, Flyboy83, but he doesn’t know the whole package…Castiel Novak, the man?
Dropping the bedding, he looks up to see a familiar and unwelcome set of blue eyes. Dean’s blood runs cold through his veins as every muscle in his body stiffens.
“Hmm?”
“To you, yes. You will hopefully never see my bad side,” Castiel huffs.
“Come on, we’re gonna miss the trailers.” Sam tugs at Dean’s shirt. Dean takes the opening to escape, nodding goodbye at everyone and following his brother toward the theaters. He doesn’t look back even though it's killing him, even though he knows they’re watching him. He feels a little twinge of guilt at trying to make Cas jealous like that, but he just couldn’t help himself. Sam plants them dead center in the last row and settles the hug bucket of popcorn next to himself.
“Figured, lay it on me,” she replies with a soft sigh.
"Professor Novak?" a voice called from the door and he looked up, breaking into a smile.
“Please.” The sub’s tongue is still hanging from the corner of his mouth, as if he’s search for more come to swallow, and between the dazed look on his face and his quickly fluttering eyelashes, Castiel watches the man enter subspace. “Please…I want more, Master…”
, and read both of our profiles on the main home page. Only nine days until bidding begins!
“How did you guys find me?”
“What is it?” He can’t help but curl his nose a little. “Is that…kale?”
“You’re not stupid,” Castiel interrupts fiercely, moving to put his hand on Dean’s shoulder, but the sub takes a sharp and aggressive step back.
He swallows hard before grabbing his keys and stepping out of the car. Castiel takes a step back, looking him up and down. He reaches up a hand, cradling Dean’s chin, his palm feeling over the spot he had just lightly smacked himself.
Castiel raises his fist, a rush of hatred so strong that Gadreel flinches. But he lowers his hand slowly, eyes glowering, feeling them flash red with anger. “Your carelessness and lack of integrity almost got Sam and Dean
Dean squints up at Castiel, unsure why he suddenly seems so uncomfortable. He’s been with the man long enough now to tell by his stiff back and tight lips that he’s not happy about something. He instinctively tips his head to rest against Castiel’s leg. Cas looks down at Dean, a slow smile breaking across his face, and he runs his hand through Dean’s hair.
Hello Fan Fic Friends!
way?”

“It shouldn’t be, but
Castiel stands in front of his pantry, frowning at the meager offerings stacked on the shelves. Box of pasta, cans of beans, baking supplies…he has no food, officially. Two days ago he would’ve fired off a message to Dean, would’ve asked him for last-minute dinner recipe ideas. More than likely Dean would have teased him about his not-so-legendary cooking skills, and the teasing would have turned to flirting, and the flirting would’ve ended with Cas dirty talking them both to completion. But now…
“That's not good enough, Dean. My…my heat is over, and we are perfectly safe. Can we please just go home now?” Sam looks at him questioningly. Dean grips the counter, fighting another wave of vertigo. He can’t sleep and can hardly keep anything down. It feels like he’s withering away.
“Dreamed about,” Castiel corrects, and the omega gives him a pleased smile. “I haven’t stopped thinking about you since the moment we met. I never thought you would want someone like me, but…” He trails off, particularly after seeing Dean’s flabbergasted expression.
“Come for me, angel, come on.” Dean tightens his grip on Castiel’s thigh, breathing heavy, eyes glazed over and mouth open. “Wanna watch you. Wanna taste you.”
“I’ll never say no to seeing you all wet,” Castiel huffs, nipping at his ear, and Dean rocks forward against the alpha, already so fucking needy. He stifles a groan ands his cock twitches at the little sound of lust.
“Oh, oh fuck, oh fuck Master, Master p-please, oh fuck…”
“I promise, alright? I’ll talk to him…just not right this minute.” This seems to appease Sam, who leaves him to trudge to the bathroom. One way or another he is going to have to deal with this Castiel situation, but he is not going to have to deal with any of it until he’s taken a nice long shower to rinse the night away.
“What do you mean?” Castiel asks curiously, and Dean turns his head and chuckles.
He goes to the front of the barn and plops himself down on the swinging love-seat. It’s one of his favorite spots, close enough to hear the horses, and he can look out on the pastures. He wasn’t sure he was going to be able to make this place work. The barn had changed hands so many times before he finally bought it. Ellie had weathered the storm of several owners and he was so grateful for it. No one was better suited to manage the place and let him do what he loved most, which was training horses.
Castiel shifts nervously in his seat. “Yes, I saw that. I can send you the reports by three thirty.”

“They moved the auction back three weeks so it's going to be a bit longer till we can get Cash back.”
“All good boys do,” Cas answers in a rumble. “I have every intention of showing you just how proud I am of you, but I think we need to finish our talk first. Do you agree?” Dean nods quickly, not sure he can speak without his voice betraying his feelings.
“Hey, boss man,” Ellie calls to him as he jumps down from the cab.
“Yours,” Castiel whispers back to him.
They spend the next hour or so drinking beer and chatting about themselves. Castiel has a twin brother who lives back in Boston. He has four cousins who all work at Sandover like he does, though he only really likes one of them. He prefers cats to dogs and for exercise he likes to row on the river.

This... this was different. This was hot as fuck and he felt his own pants getting tighter as he continued to milk Castiel for all he was worth. It wasn't till he saw the knot swelling that he moved him deeper into his throat past his well-trained gag reflex and swallowed around him, the knot brushing up against his stretched lips.
Dean sighs, looking up at Castiel's too-blue eyes. “You want this, Cas?”
“Such a polite patient,” Castiel comments, his tone pleased, leaning closer to get a better look at his finger entering and exiting. “Your Master must be very happy with you.” He pauses for more lube and adds a second finger, and the man moans low in his throat.
. He swallows hard, reading those words and knowing
shirt today, so hell yeah, I can do anything,” she chirps.
His Dom gives a wicked grin, and Dean’s eyes land on his Dom’s erection tenting the blanket.
Dean froze a second not meeting his eyes, then let out a long sigh. "You really like to talk stuff out, huh." It wasn't an accusation, more of an observation, and Castiel just nodded. "If I tell you, will you sit perfectly still while I finish?"
~~~~~
“It can be but doesn't have to be, there are varying degrees of it, but it’s essentially role playing. Is that something you are interested in?”
Dean rolls his eyes, tucking his phone away.
talk to about all this.
Castiel holds a finger up to his lips gesturing for Dean to be quiet, and Dean nods, placing the coffee on the desk. “I told you, Michael, the molds failed, so we are planning to do a test batch on Saturday so we can meet the Monday validation schedule. Things are still on track.” Dean moves to step out but Castiel steps forward, halting him with a hand on his arm. His fingers are cold, and the firm grip sends a shiver through him.
Castiel looks slightly abashed at that. “Well, I’ve been trying to find a way to talk to you about something.” Castiel flips onto his back before sitting up and pulling his knees to his chest. Dean follows him, doing the same and smelling the scent of worry on the air.
“It means if you’re caught exchanging anything more than a handshake, Winchester will be back in the servitude of Dick Roman faster than you can say ‘please, sir, don’t take my precious omega away’.”
“Uh…” The man scratches the back of his neck, blushing again. It’s a sight Castiel could really get used to. “Anything is fine. And women’s large usually. They make specialty men’s, but I…I like the tightness of the ladies cut.”
Castiel let out a laugh. "Paint me like one of your French girls, Jack," he teased.
“Firstly, you are good enough, Dean. You have always been good enough just as you are, and no matching system will change your worth…certainly not to me. As far as where we go and what we do, we get to decide that together. I know that I have been your Dominant, and I hope I can continue to be, but that doesn’t mean I will make all our life decisions without you. We will decide where to live, how to date, what jobs we want together.” Castiel’s hand rests on his shoulder now and he pulls him into a tight hug. “I’m willing to take a chance and figure out how to make this work, if you are.”
He locates Dean’s apartment without much trouble, one hand jingling his keys while the other grasps the flowers, wrapped neatly in brown paper. His knuckles rake over wood, legs feeling wobbly, and the door opens wide to reveal a short, blonde woman. Castiel can’t contain his surprise—did he knock on the wrong door?—when she shouts, “Dean, your date’s here, and you’re right…he definitely looks like a sex god.”
He groans, pulling a pillow over his head. “Go away!” he growls, voice muffled in fabric.
“I won’t give
, sub. I thought we taught you from the beginning that subs are to be seen and not heard.” Michael watches Dean for a moment, assessing him. “I think I need to spend the rest of the night reinforcing the rules.”
"That's wonderful, Castiel. Hopefully you can gather more information on what they are planning. I wish we could talk longer but I have to go, we cannot keep the line open too long. May the Hand guide you."
“Do you know what he did?” he demands furiously, eyes blazing red again. “He bit Dean against his will. He violated
Castiel doesn’t answer, and Dean feels the cool back of the metal scissors by his ankle. He feels relief when they just start to cut the fabric away. Castiel is quick and efficient and never comes close to cutting Dean, which does settle some of his anxiety. Once the shirt and pants are pulled away he feels his naked skin prickle in the air.
“I had considered using the registry results. But getting a lawyer…” Castiel mutters, thinking aloud. “That’s not a bad idea as well.”
“Did he have any of his own kids to leave it to?” Dean asks, stealing a glance over his shoulder to see Castiel looking up at the books himself.
“Hi,” Dean murmurs, acting cute and shy. Castiel loves seeing all the various sides to Dean’s personality, the way he can be charming and cocky one minute and thoughtfully quiet the next.
He twitches in his binds as the vibration setting changes to a pulse and Castiel begins thrusting into his mouth. He breathes through his nose, body cradled in leather and rope, cock hard and bobbing, mouth drooling around Castiel's hot, rigid dick. He lets all these sensations sink into him as his mind goes wonderfully blank. He just feels the pull of muscle and heat of skin, and taste of salt he can tell Cas' cock is about to release. He whimpers against the cock in his mouth, something way back in his mind telling him he can’t come, not yet.
“Hello there, Dean, long time no see.” Roman’s mouth twists in a victorious smile as Edgar, Roman’s right hand and muscle, closes the door behind them.
“Hush, now. You’ve been a very bad sub and you are going to take what I give you,” Cain tells him, and the tears come harder as he slips a ball gag into Dean’s mouth and fastens it behind his head. “This may be hard to believe, in light of what I'm about to do to you, but I care about you, Dean. I truly do. Please know that I'm doing you a favor. I'm saving you.”
He heads toward the main foyer and finds a tall balding man in a fine tailored suit waiting by the door. Dean’s nose immediately picks up on the heavy scent of alpha as he approaches, and it’s a shock to the system. Everyone in the household wears blockers, and he’s been in a relatively scent-free environment the past twenty-four hours. Well, other than Ellen’s cooking—but that’s the kind of smell he’s all for. He schools his face from wrinkling his nose at the noxious bitter scent.
And Castiel shakes his head, pointing to the phone again for extra measure. Dean holds up his finger in the “give me a minute” gesture, and when he comes back fifteen minutes later, Castiel is finally off the phone.
Dean chuckles and says, “That’s not what it looks like from over here.”
“Yeah, well…you're too damn good of an actor, I guess,” Dean grumbles, crossing his arms to keep from reaching for him. “Seemed like you had no trouble finding worthy partners to spin across the dance floor. Maybe you should go and find one of them who will cause you less trouble than a penniless, omega whore.”
Castiel.
Dean looks away, biting his lip. Then he glances up at everyone, and says in a sheepish voice, “Not that I don’t appreciate you all being here, and I do wanna talk to everybody, but, um, since I’m not exactly on my deathbed, could ya…?”
to, and Dean so desperately wants it. But he shouldn’t break his own rules, no matter how tempting it may be.
“Hey there, Dean,” Charlie strides up beside him. “What’s shakin’?”
PS: tags in end notes
“I—” Dean clears his throat, “I insulted myself, sir,” Dean answers.
He turns his back to the bar and spends the next hour nursing his drink and just watching the people. He sees one man sitting in a chair with his sub on all fours, naked, next to him, a drink balanced on his back. He sees another man with his head under a woman’s skirt, her head tossed back, legs spread and moaning. It’s a bit like watching live porn, only way more real. He is more surprised by the woman from earlier who was being flogged is now all wrapped up in a blanket in the other woman’s lap. The Dom is brushing a soothing hand over her head and whispering to her and Dean thinks how nice that must feel, being cared for.
Castiel turns around, blinking, trying to stay focused. Between the impromptu kissing and the way his sub keeps distracting him, Castiel worries he’s not offering his best dom persona tonight. But his sub is the best, and deserves the best in return.
“Do you wanna talk about it?”
He strides down the hallway, checking the door numbers to be sure he’s headed the right way, when he runs into Alfie.
Dean thinks back to Michael back handing him and grits his teeth at the memory. “No, of course I didn’t.”
“Feeling a little better?” Castiel asks in a soft voice, running a hand over Dean’s hair.
“You're so beautiful like this, all open for me. Ready to accept whatever I give you... Absolutely gorgeous,” Cas whispers the last part so quiet he isn’t sure he meant for Dean to hear it. He blushes a bit at the praise but lets it sink into his skin like the summer sun on a hot day. “Going to make my boy feel so good. You aren’t going to come till I give you permission though?”
“Ready for the rules, my good boy?” Castiel asks, eyeing Dean up and down with a hungry look that makes Dean’s cock harden.
a bit cold and it's so freaking soft.
“Dean,” Castiel corrects impatiently.
“Jody?” he recognizes the cop immediately and breathes a sigh of relief. “Fuck, I’m glad to see you.” Jody had put John in the dunk tank more than once and she always let Dean know when he was sober enough to pick up in the morning.
“I agree,” Castiel says instantly. “Perhaps…if his father goes instead?” He thinks about it more, though, and shakes his head. “That may not be enough, unfortunately, since Dean was legally the submissive of Cain at the time—not John. We need to void their contract somehow instead.”
“I sure as fuck hope not. I want better for him,” Dean mutters, slinging the bag on his back.
Medic67 4:56 PM >>
Castiel stares at him in amazement, feeling his cock give an eager stir, because…
“I couldn’t possibly stand,” he moans closing his eyes.
“I’m fixing this, I just need to make a few calls. I might not be able to get you out until Monday, but I can make damn sure they take you out of that cell.” Castiel has regained that confident, reassuring tone, and it does wonders to soothe Dean’s nerves.
“Whole lot of fancy douchebags if you ask me,” Sam mutters under his breath. Dean frowns a bit at that, since it doesn’t sound like Sam to say that. His little brother secretly loves the fancy shit.
“May I join you?” a low, gentle voice asks. He turns and blinks up at Castiel standing next to him. The alpha is blocking the sun, towel clutched in his hands. He's wet, and Dean regrets that he missed seeing the alpha in the water.
He takes large, determined steps toward the kitchen, hoping his brother will take the hint. But he never hears the front door open and close, and sure enough, his brother speaks again from a few paces behind him.
Bobby laughs. “Think that kid would slow down long enough to take his nose out of a book for a pretty girl?”
“Grab a mat, Dean. Let’s see what submissive stances you know.”
“Then I thought pitbull, since I’m kinda defensive on the outside but nice once you get to know me, y’know? But I looked online and did some research, and anyways, I picked…” He slides the form over, and Castiel reads over it eagerly.
Dean hurries to take off his flannel and then pulls his t-shirt over his head, laying both across the bed. He hesitates at his jeans— turning to face Castiel, he slowly lowers the zipper, opening them up and sliding the denim over his hips. Castiel doesn’t disappoint, gasping in a breath as he takes Dean in as he kicks off his boots and jeans and socks, standing up in nothing but his black silk panties. His cock head almost pokes out the top as it begins to harden, and his heavy balls nearly fall out the side. He knows how he looks and he hooks his fingers in the waist line, giving it a snap.
“Are you lunching alone…” The hostess begins, then seems to notice the way Castiel carries himself, his somber face and straight back. She adds, “Sir,” in a respectful tone, and he nods in appreciation.
“Come on, nerd. Lets get your bags put away before dinner,” he calls back his brother, who puts on a bit of pout but goes to grab his bags.
“I’d be amenable to that. I don’t know much music, and I’d like to get to know more about you,” Castiel admits softly, and Dean just looks at him, blushing. “What name did you decide on? Bonham, is it?”
Fuck even Castiel’s teacher voice is sexy. “Yes Sir, I think so.” He gives the man a small smile. “We still having pie?”
“Very well,” he says formally, and the sub’s eyes are gleaming wide with desire and relief, “on one condition.”
“So, is it yours?” he asks again, as he tries to fiddle with the stereo to find a classic rock station.
“I think it got in my hair,” she whines. It really isn’t that much, it just sprayed a lot. They got the bleeding under control pretty quickly, but not before Jo’s shirt got covered.
“Are you alright, Dean?”
An hour later, Dean returns and he’s red-faced, looking slightly sweaty. He drapes his suit jacket off the back of his chair and loosens his tie, running a hand through his hair and squeezing. Castiel is so distracted by his disheveled appearance that he reads the same financial statement three times.
He kicks and flails until he can see Jo standing over him, looking bewildered.
“Uh, Cas,” Jo whispers, tugging on the alpha’s sleeve, “not that I don’t like supporting local business, but…what are we doing here?”
“No Sir.” Dean shakes his head. The idea of subspace secretly terrifies him—being that vulnerable and out of it. No way would he trust any of the Doms he has met not to take advantage.
After another minute or two, his eyes fall closed and his body feels like it's shutting down. Maybe he can get a little rest before the new Dom comes in.
Dean is quiet for a moment before his expression turns playful, his mouth set to a tiny smirk. “Yeah, actually… Just wonderin’, where do you think I should go to find a dom? It’s not like you bump into one everyday, y’know.”
The next few hours pass in a blur. As soon as he gets dressed, Castiel and Balthazar load into the helicopter, transporting a patient from Mass General to the Baptist hospital in Brookline. The patient is stable for now but terrified of flying, so Castiel keeps the man occupied with stories and chatter until they land. He makes sure the hospital staff take him in and get him set-up nicely, and it’s only when they’re on their way back to the break room that he checks his phone.
“Thanks, Bobby.” He smiles, grabbing the guns and hollering for Sam who is playing with Rumsfeld in the yard. “Come on, bet you can’t beat me. Best two outta three!” he calls and Sam runs over to him, taking the other gun. They head to the back of the property where Bobby has some old cans set up. Sam wins the first round and Dean the second but they tie on the third. It feels good and powerful to have the gun in his hand, to focus on the weight of it centering him. He starts thinking of another weight, of the pull of ropes and the press of strong hands and he lets out a shuddering breath just thinking about it.
Medic67 5:03 PM >>
“Oh, of course.” He sets the beer back on the table, feeling uncertain. “So, the, um, haunt…? What’s our strategy?”
Castiel nods in agreement, a little awestruck. “That’s what I want, too. More than anything. But for this, you deserve Egyptian cotton sheets, candles, champagne…”
“Hey, Benny. Nice place you got here.” Dean gives him an awkward smile as Benny slides into the seat opposite him.
“All the time.”
“Awesome.” Kevin smiles, and Dean waves as he heads back to his suite. Dean spends another restless night staring at his ceiling, trying not to think of a blue-eyed alpha.
She straightened up and trailed off to another room. Ruby had given Sam two conditions for joining the Hand: firstly, he had to help them hack into confidential Fist sites - something he was more than happy to do. The second was he couldn't breath a word about his brother to anyone, not even other members of the Hand. If he followed those rules she would help him find and free Dean. The second request made no sense to Sam. Why he would need to keep that a secret from the other members of the Hand? But he was in no position to bargain, and there wasn't anything he wouldn't do to get Dean back. Sam typed as fast he could, feeling with each key stroke he was closer to finding his brother.
“Hey,” Dean called with a tiny nod and jogged up the steps, fumbling with his key in the door. He heard Castiel walking up the steps behind him and for the life of him he couldn’t repress the tiny surge of fear that ran through him.
FlyBoy83 10:46 AM >>
“What a perky little ass,” Castiel purrs and Dean wiggles it. He is rewarded with a hard smack. “Stay still and be a good boy,” Castiel admonishes him and he does stay still but grins to himself all the same. He feels the brush of leather against his back as Castiel brings the straps together, buckling them in place. He draws in a deep breath, feeling his ribs expand and push against his new confinement. It settles something in him and he closes his eyes, letting himself slip a little deeper into his submission.
Castiel snakes a hand up and pinches Dean’s nipples, making the omega arch his back off the bed, complaining that he’s half-hard again. They marvel for a moment at their current sex drive, wondering if they’ll always be this addicted to each other…or if it’s just the newness of their situation that makes their appetite so strong.
"Nope, sorry," came a deep, gravelly voice that in no way matched the soft blue eyes and messy black hair. "He should be coming any minute, though. I'm Castiel. I live on the other side of the duplex. Are you the new renter?"
“That’s excellent, Dumah, thank you for that update,” Chuck says from the head of the table, scribbling notes in his portfolio. “With growth like that, I fully expect for Purgatory to expand into a second facility within the next three to five years.” He looks around the long table at all the department heads and board members, and smiles gratefully. “We are all going to be part of something very exciting! I look forward to working with you all.”
“Tell me how that feels,” Castiel purrs, his slick knuckle buried in the tight heat of the man’s hole. He’s still wearing the latex gloves, and the lube covering the smooth texture is making his digit slide in even easier than usual. His left hand is holding the prostate stimulator, just high enough for it to stay in his sub’s field of vision.
“I can figure it out,” he mutters, finally jerking his hand free and banging it against the door jam. He makes an undignified yipe and shakes his hand, rubbing at the stinging knuckles.
He grabs his laptop and sets up at the small table in Castiel’s office. He works on files for Kevin as the afternoon wears on, finally stopping when Ellen brings them both pasta for dinner in the office. He feels his eyes getting a bit heavy, but things are picking up as Castiel and Dean are fielding more and more calls from his business partner in Australia. Charlie had flown to Australia to help launch the new site and had been calling off and on all day along with the CEO.
“More sure of this than anything, Cas. Please, I need to feel you. I need to know I’m yours.”
? How could he ever trust me again after all this?”
Castiel stops walking, looking at her dubiously. “That’s tempting, but I have a lot of paperwork to catch up on—”
Dean surprises him by switching their positions and pinning Castiel to the bed. Dean has a hand on the front tie of Castiel’s robe, looking into Cas’ eyes for permission to loosen it. The alpha just lies back and nods, observing the reverence on Dean’s face as his chest becomes bare.
Castiel reaches for the ring and grabs Dean’s hand, his thumb kneading gentle circles into his omega’s skin.
“You have me Dean, I am right here?”
That can’t happen, not after everything he’s seen, everything his family went through. There’s a reason he doesn’t have sex with omegas, a reason he refuses to take a mate. His attraction to Dean is purely physical, biological, that’s it. He must be too much of a hermit to realize that he’s lonely, and Dean has just reminded him that he is very, very single.
He sighs, complying. Nothing ever good started with
“S-sorry, I should be over this by now.” Castiel runs a finger over the frame.
“I–I’m okay,” comes a quivering voice, and the sound breaks Castiel’s heart. He can tell Sam has been crying. “They never got in. They never touched me.”
“Hi Cas,” he replies with a half smile of his own, and this earns him a slight tilt of the head and narrowing of the eyes.
“I am a full grown man who needs a grown-up’s dinner, not this hipster foraging crap,” he mutters, taking a bite of the concoction. “Tastes like bird food.”
Castiel glanced down in confusion, wondering how ‘67 knows what his boots look like, but then his friend answers his next question.
“Fascinating,” Roman says quietly, eyes shining in Castiel’s direction. “Face like that… I figured you’d crack, and he’d be back under my thumb in no time.”
He clears his throat, trying to regain focus on the task at hand. “Call me Castiel,” he corrects, with a nonchalant wave of his hand.
“It’s okay,” Dean says, voice sounding a little hoarse. When he doesn’t expand or say anything else, Castiel figures he’s driving after all. He unlocks the car and they slide into the leather bench interior. He turns the key in the ignition and pulls out slowly, racking his brain for topics of conversation. Finally, when they stop at a red light, he whispers, “I missed you, omega.”
“Dean, this is non-negotiable,”  he says firmly, using the innate authority of his alpha voice in a way he rarely does. To his surprise, Dean responds to it by tucking his head down and nodding in submission. It’s the last thing Castiel expected from a rebellious man like Dean Winchester, the young omega who dared to tell Dick Roman that he had “a lot of fucking nerve” to expect anything from him.
Dean listens to Sam’s day, then tells him about the calls from his shift. They both decide to have a chill night at home on the couch. Dean sinks in deep, pulling up his phone and messaging with FlyBoy as they watch reruns of
“I am.” He shakes the older man’s hand, who introduces himself as
Medic67 10:43 PM <
Castiel’s shoes moving to stand beside Dean ring out loud in the quiet room. Dean’s throat feels thick and he swallows to try and clear it. He can do this—he’s been whipped before. He can handle it. There’s no sound, no tell-tale whistle through the air, just stinging searing pain slashed across his shoulders. He sucks in a gasping breath in surprise, and it takes only a second before the lingering, burning sensation sets in. He barely has a chance to process it before the next hit falls. His shoulders hunch up toward his ears, bracing against the third hit.
Dean stood, and Castiel copied him. "Yes, but there's some technique to it," he explained.
"We're done," Dean repeated, and the finality of the phrase echoed in the tiny room. What little was left of Castiel's resolve crumbled.
"Thank you, Dean," Castiel said, putting a stop to his rambling.
Castiel squinted at his Grace, trying to place where he recognized it from. "Gadreel?" he realized at last. "Guardian of Eden? The one who allowed the serpent into the garden?"
She pursed her lips thoughtfully, but her expression soon settled back into a blank smile. "It doesn't really matter; most angels have been sent to me for corrections at least once or twice in their lifetimes. You, however, I've had to keep a close eye on. You're an excellent soldier, so long as you're operating within acceptable parameters, and your garrison is fond of you, so I let you leave after our sessions. Still, there's an air of defectiveness about you that I can never quite seem to erase."
He was
"That's still a lot to ask, Cas."
Dean nodded, settling down. "Good idea." The Impala roared to life, but the engine was almost completely drowned out by the sound of the rain against the car.
He jumped at first, but as soon as he realized it was Castiel, he relaxed, exasperated, back into his chair. "I'm dreaming, aren't I?" he asked without waiting for an answer. "Well, go ahead, take a seat, grab a beer. What's going on?" Dean offered up a smile, an olive branch after everything they'd gone through. He wished he could take it, pretend like things were as simple as before. But now he had doubts, and he didn't want to continue living a lie.
"You need to be more careful."
sorry," he told her, drawing his blade. He levered it against the lock on her cell, and in one swift motion, snapped it off, freeing her.
The next order of business was to escape. He knew he was in Heaven, but wasn't sure exactly what part. He hurried out of the office, mindful of the fact that someone was bound to have noticed Naomi's demise by now.
"Because he's my brother!" he snapped. Castiel only tilted his head to the side, uncomprehending. His brothers had killed each other over less. "I raised him. I
"It's not," Castiel tried to assure him.
Her reply shook him, gave voice to the tiny, drifting thoughts in the back of his mind that he'd never allowed himself to notice. "Unless this isn't His will."
He turned to leave, but Dean's hand caught the sleeve of his coat, stopping him. "Hey, just tell me, are you okay? You're not in trouble because of what you told me, are you?"
Castiel gaped at him incredulously. His brother. "For the murders of our kin?"
Dean rolled his eyes. "Nah, don't waste your Grace." He continued sifting through his bag until he removed a dry pair of sweatpants and started pulling them on.
Castiel furrowed his brow. "I do not understand."
Dean shoved off of him and marched down the dock. "Very funny, Cas." He did not appear to find it funny at all.
"It's good to see you, man," Dean sighed in relief.
"Lucifer," Castiel concluded, stepping away in horror.
Castiel shook his head and turned away so that Uriel couldn't see his true thoughts swirling behind his eyes as he recited again what he had told Anna. The words felt stale in his mouth. "It is our Father's world, Uriel."
Dean huffed in what might have been a half-hearted attempt at a laugh and glanced back at John Winchester's neat, blocky scrawl. "Yeah. I, uh, suppose he does."
"I will see to that. Now, sit," she commanded. Castiel obeyed. Because that's what angels do.
"My apologies," Castiel said for the second time that day, and he obligingly put some distance between the two of them. Dean blinked several times and exhaled. Castiel hadn't realized he had been holding his breath.
But at last, the soul was safe, and he was able to fly it out of Hell with zero resistance. Probably because any resistance was already dead.

He’s skimming through Castiel’s calendar when he feels a hand on his shoulder, and looks up to see Castiel next to him. His navy suit is perfectly tailored to his broad shoulders, and he looks especially sharp with his burgundy tie. Dean never really liked suits…but on Castiel, it’s mouthwatering.
He went to the kitchen where Jo had made a few peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for herself and the girls. He requested four more and she happily obliged, confused when he refused a more complex lunch. He brought the sandwiches and glasses of water out to where Dean was sitting and nervously set them down.
“We can’t—you can’t—this is a bad idea,” he tries to protest.
“Trust you to hold me to my dirty talk.” Dean lifts his hips and Castiel slips the soft cock out of his ass, groaning at the feeling of come leaking out of his hole. He falls against the pillow, too blissed out to move, and Dean slips off the edge of the bed. In another reversal of their usual roles, Dean comes back with a washcloth, tending to Castiel’s leaking hole with a possessive sort of eagerness. Then he strips back the comforter and tucks them into bed, kissing Castiel’s head and spooning him warmly. He’s a little taller than Castiel, and while it feels odd to be the one held—rather than to do the holding—Castiel finds he doesn’t mind it. In fact, he loves it. He loves any intimacy he can share with Dean.
In fact, good news: we've decided to adjust our posting schedule for the time being and begin to post new chapters ASAP. We're working hard on the next one as we speak. It still takes a lot of time and editing to get these chapters ready (especially the 9,000 word chapters like this one! holy moly) so we can't promise more than a typical weekly post. However, what we do promise is that we're
Castiel’s eyes search the crowd for the new bidder but can’t find them. Alistair has a scowl on his face but shrugs and shakes his head at the auctioneer. “
information during this phone call had outweighed his sense of vindication over Gordon’s suspension. It was incredibly suspicious to Castiel, who knew there was something Dean was hiding—but how could he continue to pry if his omega asked him not to?
Dean stood in the unfurnished living room and closed his eyes a moment, listening to the silence. He'd never lived alone before and it was a little unsettling. He had a moment of regret for not having his brother Sam come help him, but like he had insisted, Dean didn't own much and he could handle it on his own. He needed to be able to handle it on his own. Sam had been great the past few weeks, but Dean was ready to try and find some normalcy in his life again.

“S-stop, stop,” Dean demands, his chest red and sweaty, the veins in his neck pronounced and thin, like longitude lines marking the geography of his body. Castiel presses the “off” button on the remote immediately, chest heaving. “I lost count, but that was…that was ten? Right?”
“It’s been hours,” Castiel says reasonably, with a frown. “I wouldn’t chance it.”
“Nice to meet you both.” Benny gives a little nod, but he’s looking a little stiffer at Cas.
“Your uncle sounds like he has real integrity,” Castiel says, feeling uneasy in a way he can’t name. “Unfortunately, those aren’t the kind of people I tend to do business with.”
Dean bolts to the bookshelf and grabs the baseball bat stashed there, hiking it up over his shoulder and advancing on the guy. He waves it over his shoulder like he’s looking for a curve ball and growls at the guy, “Last warning to get the hell out of here!”
“Okay,” Sam says, the gleam in his eye returning as he looks between Dean and Cas. “No rush with

“If you're really interested in charity work, I may have a task for you,” Castiel replies, straightening up and acting like nothing had just happened between them. It makes Dean feel strangely empty when Cas gets like this. “My brother started a charity through our corporation, and every year we have a large ball to raise money for it. Jimmy always organized it, but since then…since then Missiouri has taken over. Would you be interested in helping her with it? It's only two weeks away.”
Castiel's fingers move to scratch at the nape of his neck, and he can’t help bowing his head forward. God, he shouldn’t let himself indulge in this touch when it's just gonna get taken away.
“This him, then?” Sam asks Dean, leaning over him with his gigantor height to see in the stall.
“Denial, thy name is Castiel.” Luc returns to his seat finally with a flourish. “That omega wants you to stuff him full with your alpha cock, I guarantee it.”
It doesn’t take long for Dean to hear a pinging sound and see Castiel has sent back another attachment. It seems to be his own test, with slightly different Dom questions. Seems like they have a lot of the same interests, Castiel enjoys dirty talk and with that fucking voice he can only imagine. He also seems to like rope play, and possessiveness in scenes. He is a maybe for pet play and exhibitionism and a no for water-sports, blood, and sounding. He apparently mostly enjoys to top but can enjoy bottoming as well. He also likes giving and receiving oral and Dean does a little fist pump at that.
