is it with you and Sherlock Bloody Holmes?” John roared. “You shoot people, you get shot, you jump off fucking
Sherlock was shaking continuously now. When John’s other hand slipped down along one hip to grasp Sherlock’s weeping cock, the beta cried out and twisted, burying his face against John’s neck, seeking John’s scent. John could smell them both now, sun-warmed autumn mixed with musk and gun steel. His own cock was trapped between his and Sherlock’s bodies. Every move Sherlock made was a not-quite-painful tease that John fought to ignore so that he could focus on Sherlock’s pleasure.
Lestrade was right. John knew he was right, but he hated to leave. He called Mary, gave her a brief explanation of what had happened and asked her to come pick him up.
“Do I need to spell it out for you? I should think that you could figure out for yourself what state the original wounds were in the evening you knocked Sherlock to the ground – three times – and attempted to, as Sherlock put it, ‘beat him up.’”
“We just need to follow up on a few details,” Sherlock assured him.  “Your wife’s...” and here Sherlock drew two fingers down in a V on his upper chest.
Outside the gate, a dun gelding stood already saddled, its reins tied to a tree.  A casual observer would not have known that the gelding was, in fact, the finest horse in the tsar’s stables whose appearance did not advertise its quality.  The observer would not have seen that beneath his shirt, the gentleman wore a signet ring bearing the tsar’s seal upon a chain.  Wrapped in an old shirt in one of his saddle bags was a case of jewels – to be precise, every piece of jewellery that the Tsarevna Harrieta Watovna had given to her wife during their marriage.
. Touch me!” And John could barely coordinate his hands, but he managed to get hold of Sherlock’s cock, to make a tunnel for Sherlock to thrust into, even to squeeze, once, twice...
could.” Sherlock stretched, posing a bit, and then added in a deeper voice, “Which doesn’t mean that we can’t follow their example.”
As it turned out, John had just passed Chancery Lane when a black car, larger and finer than any automobile he’d seen in the UBR so far, pulled up alongside him.  The driver, a burly, grim-faced man in a black suit, got out and handed John one of those blocky cell phones.
“Robert and I were already collaborating. Coming back made that easier.  It was quite obvious that the situation with David was never going to improve.  Once I was gone, he found another woman whose career he could help, perhaps more effectively than he’d ever helped mine.”
Several things happened at once. Campbell-Williams suddenly woke up, got a firm grip on her ex-husband’s arm and half jumped, half fell backwards away from the cab.  The elderly man grew half a head taller and slammed his fist into the thick-set man’s gut.  The cabbie opened
“I’m definitely getting myself something nice for dinner when we get out of here,” Donovan commented. “This is making me hungry.”
“Easily,” said Ivan.  With a flourish, he withdrew his father’s signet ring from underneath his shirt and held it up for the guards to see.  Except that they could
“Didn’t you mark where Muircheartaigh entered?” Sherlock snapped.  “Behind that hanging – no, not that one, the one I’m pointing at!  The stairs will take you up to the battlements.  Jump as soon as you can.”  His voice was hoarse and his pale face shone with sweat amidst the black feathers.
“But I won’t get an answer.  I see.”  When John had woken up this morning, he’d been in bed with Sherlock.  Now they were on different territory altogether.  He felt tea was called for and went to put the kettle on.
They left David staring after them, rubbing his hand.  Sherlock’s grasp had been perhaps somewhat more firm than necessary.
John took another sip and then set his mug down. “Does taking me to lunch at a hidden, secret café constitute a date?”
Sherlock looked sulky, but it was Mary who retorted, “Then Sherlock will have to provide it. I’m going to walk for a while. Could one of you change the sheets? I tried to make it out of bed before my water broke, didn’t quite manage.”
John caught Lestrade’s wince at the way she’d phrased the question. Any teenager would answer that tone almost reflexively.  Sure enough, Tyler relaxed just a bit and answered, “Yeah.  Yeah, of course.  He needs his meds, you said that before you left.”  He was back to looking at the floor.
John looked Sherlock in the eyes.  “You didn’t call New Scotland Yard, did you?  You dialed a number that you knew would be answered with a recorded message and faked a conversation.  One of my mates in Canada told me about his kids doing that.”
“It would possible, yes. But perhaps I can save you the time and trouble, Mr Holmes.  You seek to establish that one particular name is written among those many forms.  Donald McKinsey.”
with your sister’s artist, although I’d want to see samples of this person’s work first.  And we also might get completely undressed, because we look rather ridiculous at the moment.”
“It depends on what you’re looking for.  My name’s Misha, by the way.  Mikhail Mikhailovich Kamen’brodsky.”
Ivan dismounted and led the gelding – which he had taken to calling Bezimyan – to the side of the road, leaning on him for balance.  “I might, friend, for I cannot tell which road is the main one.”
“Because he liked sex, and cocaine made sex tolerable for me. Although to be honest, we both enjoyed cocaine for its own sake.”  Sherlock sounded as if he were talking about a pint down at the pub.
It wasn’t all that bad, he thought. He discovered that he could run his hand up and down the base a bit and that he could get a sort of rhythm going, alternating long, steady sucks with swirling licks.  Sherlock’s hands were in his hair, tensing and relaxing like the paws of a giant cat, which felt rather nice until John realized that Sherlock was trying not to pull but
Seven and a quarter hours after Mary thumped on the ceiling, she began to grunt with each contraction. John and Sherlock helped her walk up and down the room until she indicated that she wanted to lie down.
It had started with Rosamund’s birthday party.  No, before that.  He’d played for Rosamund before that, when John brought her to visit or left her with Mrs Hudson to mind.  After all, she needed exposure to something other than mindless pop.  She was a surprisingly good audience, staring at the motions of his arms and hands as he played, laughing and kicking when he finished a piece.
“Yes. It was... nothing was as Angela described it.  The food she’d prepared was gone.  There were dirty dishes in the sink, the bedcovers were rumpled.  The flat was very tidy, but it definitely looked as if someone had been there.”
knows better than to risk a public confrontation with either Timothy or myself,” Mrs Holmes said sternly. “We’ve provided him with reasonable grounds to claim that he was unaware of anything amiss. If he knows what’s good for him, he’ll use them.”
need to make tea, to go through the familiar ritual of making tea. You need to calm down and get yourself together, Watson. You’ve got a pregnant, fugitive assassin standing in your flat and the child is yours. Yelling isn’t going to solve anything.
“It’s a shame how many police officers don’t understand the scientific method,” John said straight-faced.  “Three minutes, eh?”
John had his answer soon enough when he and Mike almost collided with a young woman who came flying out of a doorway.
Cautiously, Ivan attempted to flex his toes within his boots.  It took some concentration, but he was fairly sure that he could move his left big toe.
As Angelo bustled off, Sherlock considered the long, curved piece of metal rising up from the table. “You’re far more insecure than I expected from ‘Three Continents’ Watson.”
The second day passed much like the first, except that the hills rose and became true mountains.  The wind that blew down from them carried a scent of ice and pine.  Again, Ivan made camp for the night.  Again, he did not dream.
dealer.  Or perhaps supplier would be a better word.  He didn’t have any other customers, and I never paid him.”
The door at the top of staircase was, to Ivan’s surprise, unlocked.  “I didn’t have time to lock it behind me when I was interrupted previously,” Sherlock explained.  “And apparently
“Hmmm, classical design features...  Looks like work favoured a few decades ago, especially by...  Oh.  No, he wouldn’t have sold his own pieces in his shop.  If I’m correct, Wilson designed and created them out of sentiment for times gone by.”
day.  It’s as if all the criminals are on holidays.  Nothing’s really happening, so I’ve got no excuse not to catch up on paperwork.  To be honest, I’ll take a good crime scene over paperwork any day.”
Muircheartaigh giggled again.  “Be honest, Sherlock.  My work fascinated you.  That’s why you offered yourself to me as an apprentice.”
John looked across to spot a second camera, also pointed at him.  When had London become infested by security cameras?
As the crocuses and daffodils began to appear outdoors in late February, Mary became noticeably more restless about having to stay inside all the time. Still, John thought she was bearing up with reasonable grace.
John was grinning as he let himself in. Sherlock’s bedroom door was shut, with a sliver of light showing from underneath. His laptop and latest stack of beekeeping material were missing from the living room, where they had occupied a position of prominence earlier that day.
John maintained that he was perfectly capable of following verbal instructions and pointed out that Sherlock certainly had no problems telling him what to do in
“Oh, really? You could have fooled me.” The kettle boiled. John looked at the single mug he’d set out and sighed. “Tea?”
Sherlock seemed to take the insult in stride, merely replying that he was here to see Detective Inspector Lestrade and that yes, he’d been invited.  But when the woman persisted in questioning him as to
The driver’s expression didn’t change.  “Please get in the car, sir.”  His voice was a gravelly bass.
says” – Nigel had returned to his normal voice now – “’Piss off!’  And he throws up all over the junky’s shoes!”
“Fine!” snapped Sherlock. “I don’t need your assistance in any case. I’m perfectly capable of buying my own maternity clothes.”
“Welcome home, my son,” said the tsar to Ivan.  “Our family is cursed, but at least we can all be cursed together.”  Then he laughed, and his laughter was bitter and crazed.
“I remember this bit,” said John. “We had something of a fight about it in class. You know how in most mammalian species, both females and males have pouches?”
Sherlock looked up from his microscope and studied John a moment. “You think you’ve just realized that in escaping from the hospital, I was risking my life for the sole purpose of demonstrating Mary’s duplicity to you.” He shrugged. “I would have had to leave the hospital anyway. I was too vulnerable lying there, drugged up on morphine.”
“He wouldn’t take them, Mum.” Tyler hesitated. “I’m sorry.  Maybe I could’ve tried harder or something?  I just...  I didn’t know what to do.”
When the bus came to a stop in front of the high-rises and the driver announced, “Everyone out!” the passengers stared.  This was not the London they remembered.
“Indeed not.  He was promptly executed.  Perhaps a little too promptly.  I’ve often wondered if he was a plant.”
When Sherlock handed John a pair of latex gloves, John indicated his own coverall.  “Aren’t you gonna put one on?”
“When the creature proposed that we should invade the castle, the two of us alone, I saw this for the madness it was and escaped into the forest.  But my path was turned around through some trickery...”
“You grabbed him and yelled at me to run. You were wrapped in Semtex, you knew there were snipers aiming at you. You tried to sacrifice your life to give me a chance to escape.” Sherlock’s voice was intent, focussed as a laser beam. “When did
Sherlock gave John an approving nod and reassured their landlady.  “We’re all right, Mrs Hudson.  It’s just Mycroft sticking his fat nose in where it doesn’t belong again.”
After they had eaten, Manya sat for awhile, studying Ivan but not speaking.  When she finally spoke, he did not expect the question she asked.
John didn’t fall for the attempt at deflection. “It’s incredibly hot that you chose me to be the first person you wanted to experience this with.” He ran his hand along the side of Sherlock’s face.
the medications made his stomach hurt, Mr Caustlin, or was there one in particular he avoided taking?”
Ivan cursed and began pulling his clothes on.  The forest was no place for an elderly woman alone.  As he was just reaching for his sword and walking stick, he glanced out the window again – to see Marfa Hudovna coming back, this time with a jug and a piece of cloth.  Ivan heard the kitchen door open and close again.
Sherlock smirked.  “The office contained ledgers, files, papers, a recently purchased refurbished laptop – and a crucifix in a stand on the desk.  Mr Antonelli liked to take risks, but only to a limited degree.  In the event of an unscheduled inspection, the crucifix on the desk could be picked up and tossed into a drawer more easily than one hung on the wall
At about midday, he came to a small village.  In the centre of the village was a well, and at the well stood a slight young woman with mousy brown hair, drawing water.  Seeing Ivan approach, she poured a bucket of water into the horse trough next to the well so that Bezimyan could drink.
Sherlock didn’t respond, but he did comply.  Then he looked at John.  “John, you’re a medical man.  What do you make of the body?”
“We can’t afford to have Mrs Hudson spot her while she’s running up and down the stairs, so she’ll have to stay in my – in
John knew he owed Sherlock an apology. As the doors closed on the lift that would take them back down to the ground floor, he opened his mouth to make it – only to have Sherlock cut him off by remarking offhandedly, “From what I saw, Miranda Caustlin appears to have forgiven you for manhandling her son.”
Sherlock took a breath, yes, he did, but things had changed. And even though he didn’t mean for it to come out of his mouth, he meant it with ever fibre in his being. “When you came back from the military… I wasn’t the same man, John. You must realise that. I wanted to marry you before you left, when I first fell in love with you… but your ‘death’ didn’t treat me well. I closed myself off and even though you were back, I remained shielded because I was so afraid you would leave again… but now here you are. And we’ve been through so much, so much that if anyone else had gone through what we’ve gone through they wouldn’t have made it. You’re the one I’m meant to be with, John. You’re the one I want to spend the rest of my life with… So please. I ask you again. Will you marry me?”
John's mouth snapped shut and he nodded slowly. He just stared at Sherlock, not say anything, barely even breathing. Out of all the reactions he was expecting to happen, it wasn’t… that.
Sherlock growled and looked down at the ground, he didn’t like it when people demanded things of him. He didn’t realise that that now extended to John as well, especially when it didn’t use to. He swallowed thickly and thought about everything in his head, if this was a dream he would want to savour the time he had with John and he wouldn’t want it to become an awful nightmare where he told John no and stayed behind. He had those dreams before and he always woke up feeling empty. However, he woke up feeling empty when he did go see John so Sherlock supposed it was a lose, lose situation. “Fine... I’ll be over in a few minutes.” He missed John so much he wasn’t going to pass this opportunity by him. John didn’t hear him though; he had already hung up the phone right when he finished giving his little speech.
“Well Sir, then we located the tent and stayed on them, all night, and sure enough, the next morning they went out, dressed just as pretty as you please and straight to Westminster and jewelry stores - just like you said they would.”
“C’mon lads, we are going to the circus,” smiled Wiggins as the boys ran across Kensington Road towards a whole world full of new sights, smells, and opportunities.
“Well, Holmes at times you quite astound me, as your method employs both deduction and presumption.”
The Amazing Mysterio and his assistant finished their afternoon performance and made their way back to their tent only to be surprised by three men waiting inside.
“Two days ago I brought out a display tray to show to a customer when I noticed that there was an odd looking ring on the tray. I picked up this ring and examined it and found it to be cheap theatre jewelry. It was sitting in place of a nice diamond ring that was now missing, and I have no idea where the missing ring is, or how this costume ring came into its place.”
So, a few hours later, accompanied by two of his younger charges, Wiggins made his way to Hyde Park, the current temporary home of the Britannia Traveling Circus. The boys came upon the park via Kensington Road, and there, on the old football pitches on South Carriage Drive was a row of colorful tents, each with banners flying from their main poles, and just beyond these was a huge striped tent.
That drew a chuckle from the Doctor, as Holmes often quipped but rarely joked. And with that, the two men left Baker Street and took a cab to Fleet Street to meet with the despondent jeweler.
They decided to finish their tea before setting out, but they were interrupted by a knock at the door and the entrance of Mrs. Hudson, who had returned from her errands.
“I will be away from Baker Street for a day - perhaps more. I will send you word where to contact me if you gather the information I seek. Here is your fee up front, with some additional coin to cover a telegram.”
Henry Toombs recognized that pin as a British Army collar badge designating service in India - except it looked smaller than army issue he thought, so perhaps it was jewelry made as a copy.
Holmes and Watson returned to Baker Street where they relaxed with whiskey and pipe smoking as Mrs. Hudson prepared a late meal.
Mrs. Hudson was out for the morning, so as a result Holmes was compelled to answer the front door. The fact that it was Dr. Watson immediately improved Holmes’ apparently foul demeanor at having to see to the doorbell, and after greeting his friend, the two men bounded up the stairs to discuss Watson’s proposal.
Holmes smiled after this statement, and Watson raised his glass in simple acknowledgment of the two paths of judgment awaiting Mr. Harrison.
Watson sipped his tea and waited to see if Holmes would expound on his statement; which he did not, still, secrecy and mystery were familiar bedfellows in their relationship.
He dispatched telegrams to Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson (she was to contact Wiggins) to have any information sent to him via the constabulary office in Woking.
With one exception, as a single pair of eyes watched him from the bushes; he hadn’t planned on being caught, particularly by a detective he thought was in London.
He was so overcome with joy and relief that he could hardly contain himself. He placed the document in his cloak and climbed back out the window, pulling the window closed behind him, he couldn’t believe that it came off just like he had planned.
“Oh, there was a young couple, very excited, looking to purchase an engagement ring. Well, we didn’t have what they were looking for, so they contracted me to create a ring for them - they gave me a deposit.”
Holmes and Watson returned to London the evening of the 30th, then took the morning train back to Woking the following day. After meeting with Mr. Phelps and his sister, it was decided that Holmes, Watson, and Phelps would return to London that afternoon to continue the investigation and that in their absence, Mrs. Harrison would remain in the sick room, without fail.
“In the event, some form of medial malfeasance should surface, I could use the opinion of a good Doctor…do you know any?”
Harrison swallowed hard, then took a drink of his beer, and keeping his eyes on the table nodded his understanding. A man who bullies others quickly recognizes when he is confronted by a stronger individual, and the great irony is how quickly he conforms to a state of resignation.
“Oh, they were nicely dressed, a bit colorful and flamboyant, I suppose, but then that’s the fashion today, and they were talkative and laughing, and just very…well, excited.”
“I have developed a plan to get the item, even if Mr. Phelps still occupies the room,” quickly replied Harrison, hoping to satisfy Toombs of his commitment to complete the transaction.
“Have you got it?” asked Toombs. There was no point in nuance, as time was now an enemy and results were all that mattered.
The cab delivered Holmes and Watson to Gregson’s Jewelry Shop where they met with the owner, Mr. Tobias Gregson. The shop was small but was well turned out, as Fleet Street catered to the wealthy citizens of London, and Mr. Gregson’s shop was no exception. A modest room furnished with a small table and two chairs, a counter with a glass display case and a backroom with working space for two jewelers assistants and a separate small enclosed office. A large safe was located in the office.
“Who the bloody hell are you?” said "The Great Mysterio, Master of Magic and that Arcane Arts," a man more commonly known as Clive Silverton. The Great Mysterio puffed himself up with defiant bravado as he faced the strangers.
It was now July, and fate had cast another mystery across the paths of Holmes and Watson and as such would draw them together in common cause.
“I am Sherlock Holmes, this is my associate Dr. Watson, and this stern looking gentleman is Inspector Lestrade of the Metropolitan Police.”
Holmes was in the center of the room, épeé in hand, standing in the en garde position, facing a women’s dressing mannequin.
“This way Sir,” replied the Stewart, and he turned and led Toombs past the fearful tiger and through the open archway into a large lounge where several tables were occupied by men playing cards or reading the papers. Smoke floated about the room decorated with portraits of Queen Victoria and General Charles “Chinese” Gordon, a large set of elephant tusks, and a large tapestry of Hindi characters performing various tasks. Servants dressed in khaki stood by at the ready, linen towels over their forearms, and holding silver trays waiting for their next delivery of sherry or whiskey.
"Let go of me, Myc. Let me go!" Sherlock extended one arm towards Irene. "I'll show her who's in charge!"
"You like that, do you boy?" Greg flicked that one off immediately and snatched the peg off before, doing the same thing again.
Sherlock couldn't help but think Irene wanted something. He took the fucking for a moment before deciding he should give her what she obviously so desperately needed.
“Sir?” he asked, slightly wrong footed. The man hadn’t spoken to stop him, just casually touched his box.
Sherlock tried to turn around, to glare at his Dom but Greg grabbed his cock. He wrapped his fist around it hard and squeezed around the pegs.
"Lay down, boy," John ordered from the bed. He knew the brat was still on his knees, and a tired submissive would not make the following day easier to deal with.
"Nope," he popped the p and ruffled Mycroft's hair. "How's the mud? It's a good job I didn't let you kneel there in your pristine suit, isn't it?"
John was having a great time of it. It surprised him how much he was enjoying tickling his pet's feet with the gentle pressure he was using.
When he was done, John kissed him again and noticed that his vision was a lot more focused now and he was looking around less drowsily; more dazed and confused.
It was half an hour before there was any sign or movement and the Dom was beginning to think that the detective wasn’t in here at all and was indeed down in his lab concentrating on some experiment, that to John, who’s degree was in medicine, not chemistry, would be absolute gibberish. However, slowly, a mop of brown curls appeared first, then the rest of the boy. He stood up as quickly and quietly as he could and made for the door immediately.
He had been so angry… nearly as angry as when he had come without permission. He didn’t know what to do, he couldn’t go and find John to apologise. The leash probably had more spare inside it as it had retreated back inside the device when he had sat upright, but there was undoubtedly not enough to get him to the door and God knows what John would do if he found him trying to get out. He should learn to control his curiosity but this had been the first time the Dom had left him alone in the house for a significant amount of time and he had wanted to find out what the older man kept hidden away. He hadn’t found anything though, so it was definitely not worthwhile, he was starting to think that even if he had found a dirty secret, this would not have been worth it. The doctor had also discussed with him how strict he would have to be now and Sherlock had realised then he was just another sub to a professional Dom. Yes, he liked John; respected him, even, but this wouldn’t last. It couldn’t. Sherlock was a detective, he ran around London for fun, ducking in and out of alleyways after murderers and hiding on rooftops. John was an ex-army doctor with a psychosomatic limp and a very successful business judging by the size of his house. Incompatible in Sherlock’s view. That didn’t stop him from feeling guilty though.
The doctor started walking towards the water again. “Think about it.” He scooped Finn up and threw him onto his good shoulder.
"Yes, ma'am," one of the guards snapped as he went over to Irene and pulled her to her feet, then dragged her from the cell.
“Oh, yeah, you probably haven’t heard of it. It’s a huge convention held every year in Belgium. I met this couple there. They seemed nice enough but at the time, I was seeing Janine and, y’know, Sherlock, so I didn’t think anything of it. But I ran into them again recently, it turns out they live near London and, well, I’m
Sherlock sighed.  “Fine.  The police don’t consider my hypotheses to be ‘real evidence.’  Even Lestrade wouldn’t be able to justify sending anyone.”
, young man, no more peeping in at girls’ windows!  If you’re interested in a girl, show her you have some guts by introducing yourself to her face.”
“If you fall I’ll probably be able to catch you before you hit the ground,” Sherlock promised in an off-handed tone.  “Look at the castle.  What do you see?”
“Three hours. Walked through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens to the Round Pond, sat there approximately twenty minutes.  There are still flakes of paint from the bench on your jeans.”
Sally looked nonplussed.  “I don’t...”  Then she seemed to notice John for the first time.  “Er, who’s this?”
A branch hit Ivan in the face and he realized that he’d started to turn Bezimyan off the road, towards the voice.  Shaking his head, he corrected his course.  A woman laughed somewhere in the woods slightly ahead of him.  His mother laughed, but his mother was dead.  It must be Harrieta – or perhaps Manya?  But he’d never heard Manya laugh, so how would he know what her laughter sounded like?
But when had John stopped being able to think of Sherlock’s body strictly in medical terms, as he would any other patient’s? When had his imagination begun to insist on drawing in the unknown territory between hip and thigh?  He remembered Buckingham Palace, with Sherlock sitting close to him clad only in a sheet, but the memory kept changing.  In his imagination, Sherlock pulled a corner of the sheet aside, revealing a nicotine patch like a bizarre beauty spot on the inside of his milky-white upper thigh.
“There’s one more thing we need to talk about – and not in public,” John explained as they walked deeper into the park.
“I was trying to think of a word that means endearing but without the same degree of implied sentimentality. Yes, we might discuss getting matching tattoos,
them, from the way Sherlock raised his chin to put his long neck at the perfect level for Dexter’s lips.
.”  Ivan’s voice caught, and his vision was blurred.  When he reached to wipe his eyes, his hand came away wet with tears.
“What about... You said earlier that the ex-husband was the one with a new partner.  But Campbell-Williams and Foucault met three years before she left the States.”
John sputtered into his beer as Greg smiled triumphantly. “Okay, that’s one for you.  Let’s talk about something normal.  News, for example.”
Muircheartaigh leaned forward on his throne and hissed, “Did he tell you that he left Victor behind?  Brought him here and then ran, well,
“Not you, idiot.  The man you stole the sword from.  Don’t look so offended, it’s obvious.  The hilt is plain but the blade is Damascene steel.  Judging by your clothes, your family’s not wealthy enough for you to have inherited
John and Sherlock stared at each other.  Finally John said, forcing his voice to calmness, “Well, that was certainly worth staying up all night for.”
“For a case and therefore irrelevant,” said Sherlock dismissively. “You should kiss me again.  We need the data.”
John took a deep breath and began.  “When I was thirteen, my father was given tickets to a performance by the Royal Ballet, a thank-you gift from a customer.  We all went – Da, Mum, Harry and I.  I’d never been before and to be honest, didn’t expect much from it.  I’d begun to notice girls, though, so I figured there’d at least be pretty ballerinas to look at.”
“Mary apparently did. Here.” Sherlock shoved the laptop back towards John, who blinked at the screen.
.”  Sherlock was clearly trying to maintain a solemn face, but his eyes danced and the corners of his mouth twitched.
He could be kind. He could be caring. He’d cared enough about John (and Lestrade and Mrs Hudson) to jump off a building and spend two years hunting down Moriarty’s network.
Any response Sherlock might have made was interrupted by the arrival of Angelo, bearing menus and not just a candle but rather a decorative bit of metalwork holding
“Yes.  I was, I admit, surprised.  Given the nature of the incident, I would have thought I’d deleted your face.  It had somehow… stuck with me.”
This time Ivan cared not for anonymity but rather chose his horse for speed and endurance on the road.  He rode out of the garrison on a chestnut stallion with a white blaze down its forehead, carrying with him Marfa Hudovna’s gifts and, wrapped in an old shirt in one of his saddle bags, the case that held Sherlock’s heart and feathers.
“With your horribly romantic imagination.” Sherlock was teasing now, and John felt a bit better for it.  They’d be all right.
“Yeah, the uncle’s in his late sixties, has a heart condition and is in the early stages of mild dementia, on medication for both conditions. No other family except Caustlin and her teen-aged son.  He has his own flat.  A caregiver comes in three times a week to fix meals, keep the place clean and make sure he’s okay.  Caustlin does the same thing on the caregiver’s off days.  Actually, it sounded as if she comes by pretty much every day, but she specifically asked her son to visit on the caregiver’s off days while she was gone.”
The man looked at him closely for a moment, then took a notebook out of his inside pocket and opened it.  “What can you tell me about the woman known, among other names, as Mary Elizabeth Morstan?”
Sherlock stood, reaching out to pull John to his feet with both hands. John clasped them firmly in his own, holding on as if never to let go again.
When John got home, he discovered a note from Mary saying she’d gone over to Kate Whitney’s. John spent the better part of the afternoon catching up on medical journals. When Mary reappeared, it was only to remind John that she’d told him ages ago that she had some sort of megs’ night out scheduled with people named Becca and Carol. She offered to cancel. He insisted she go, rather wishing that she’d cancel anyway and then feeling put out when she took him at his word and went.
Greg’s triumph faded into a groan. “Not the divorce laws.  I’ve been hearing about those at the Yard all day.”
“Oh, please. A blind monk could tell that Molly’s as bent as a safety pin. I have no doubt that you asked about her. What better, safer way to convince John that you actually
“My hobby is chasing around after a completely mad consulting detective in the interest of keeping him from killing himself.”
“You’re saying that except for the fling in his forties, Foucault is married to his work,” said John, keeping his face perfectly straight.
John thought about his illegal gun, his addiction to danger and his penchant for psychopaths. “To be honest, no, not completely. And Sherlock and I
The stranger bent his head to whisper something in Sherlock’s ear.  Then the two of them left the pub, the stranger’s arm still around Sherlock’s waist, two lovers, perhaps planning to spend the night together.
“All right, you never heard this and certainly not from me. Someone called 999 this evening from the phone in Magnussen’s flat at the CAM Global News Building. The operator said it was a woman with a strong accent, possibly Australian. She reported that two people had been shot and needed immediate medical attention, then hung up. When the paramedics arrived, they found Sherlock, Magnussen and two more people, possibly Magnussen’s PA and a security guard. Magnussen had been shot through the forehead. Sherlock was lying on the floor bleeding out.”
John decided it might be time to intervene. “Mary, you know how initially a choriovitelline placenta forms from the yolk sac of the fertilized ovum, right?”
Not John himself, then.  Something to do with John, but not Rosamund.  Ah.  Sherlock began John and Mary’s wedding waltz.
“No, I simply walked out. There was no sneaking involved. You sleep fairly soundly unless you have a nightmare. If you
A shred of red fabric hung off the remains of a rusty bolt protruding from the brick near the corner.
John himself had eaten quite well and slept the sleep of the satiated for almost all of the train journey home.
Sherlock went out to meet with an undisclosed person in an undisclosed location and returned with a set of mysterious bottles with handwritten labels.
“Sherlock, Sherlock,” whispered Ivan, turning his head to kiss a cheekbone, an ear, whatever he could reach.  He reached down with his other hand to cradle Sherlock’s balls, felt them drawing up.
“Mrs Hudson just offered to babysit ‘once in a while,’” he announced after closing the door to the flat.
to the Yard when you want to meet Graham for a pint.  You’ve already been living here for almost a month...”
She was certainly pretty enough, but what had Misha been on about, warning Ivan about her sharp tongue?  On the contrary, she seemed a timid sort.  Still, Misha claimed to have a reputation as matchmaker, and this was the woman he had directed Ivan to address.  Ivan gave her his best smile.
“John, your loyalty is the very core of your being. Even if I’d walked you through every detail that I’d seen, if I’d drawn the pattern the details made, even if I’d done all that, you wouldn’t have been
“Someone pays Curran and Ives. Banks gets a share, and Wentworth’s debts get written off, at least partially.”
John smiled wryly and snagged a few crisps before Sherlock got them all. “Apparently so. Maybe I won’t end up with kids after all.”
“John? I liked this.” And Sherlock pulled him close, chest-to-chest, shifting his weight a bit so that John had to put his arms around Sherlock and support him as Sherlock leaned in for a kiss.
The woman talked right over him.  “Come inside, then, and go right up the stairs.  I’m fairly sure he’s in.  Oh, you’ve got a cane!  I know what that’s like, I’ve got a hip, myself.  Just leave your bags inside there, then, they’ll be perfectly safe.  Go on, up with you!”
I ever care to try that again.  I still can’t quite believe I married such a, a... milksop!  And with David in gaol, I have to pay someone to look after the house in Massachusetts until I can sell it.”
“E’ll be all right. I’ll keep an eye on ‘im, like. But... ‘e might not be ‘ome right tonight, you unnerstan’?”
Ivan took a deep breath and squared his shoulders.  “It seems silly to come all this way and not at least try.  Mind, betray me and I’ll break both your wings.  So how are we getting through this gate?”
“I stayed home from school the next day. I’d’ve stayed home the rest of the week, except I knew there’d be too many questions.  I went to school, I came home...  Oh, are you asking about Ms Desimone calling?  I... I listened to the messages, like you guessed.  I went over to Uncle Don’s flat on Saturday.  I was kind of scared that the police might be waiting, but there was no one there.  I fixed it to look as if Uncle Don had been eating and sleeping there.”
Next to it stood the other stone. “Gloria Scott Watson, 2014.”  SIDS typically strikes infants two to four months of age.
Caustlin glanced at each of them but if she recognized their names, she didn’t show it as far as John could tell.
Indeed, all of the furniture had been pushed around the edges of the room. Sherlock looked rather the worse for wear, while Mary merely displayed a nice, rosy glow.
“Yes! Hmmm, interesting.  Whoever wrote this did so with his left hand, even though that’s not his dominant hand.”
“I told him that it could be very nice indeed – with a bit of work, which he could be sure that he was helping me with!  Truth be told, Sherlock’s not very handy, but he’s good at taking things apart to see how they
“Mornin’, doctor,” he said with a broad grin. “Missus Morstan said I was to give this only to you. Right into yer ‘ands, she said. An’ she also said if I ‘ad to wait, Missus ‘udson might feed me.”
Wiggins nodded and began to walk away towards the south end of the bridge. He turned when John called after him. “Bill! I just wanted to say – thank you.”
The wedding day itself arrived. They made it through the ceremony without mishap, after which John found himself standing between Mary and Sherlock on receiving line. Ah, so
disappointed.  After not having visited in so very long, I would have hoped Sherlock would try to make it up to me with a really nice gift, something intriguing and unexpected.  A shopworn princeling armed with nothing more than a sharp sword and a hedge witch’s trinkets hardly qualifies.”
“Sherlock had a meeting with a client this morning. He described it as involving ‘simple blackmail.’ But he’s also working on something that has to do with Charles Augustus Magnussen. And Mycroft seemed to think that Magnussen was out of Sherlock’s league.”
His uncle.  With any luck, his uncle was dead.  If John met the man, he didn’t think he could be responsible for his actions.  Harry, though, he wanted to try and look up Harry.  He’d last seen her being carted off to marry the said uncle’s business partner, an older man who’d already outlived two wives and had a daughter Harry’s age.
John held her a bit more closely for reassurance. “Absolutely none. Never mind him, love. My point is that aside from that fluke, Molly, well, for the longest time she had a desperate crush on Sherlock.”
wake due to a nightmare and discover I was gone, then when I returned I would have told you that I’d gone out for cigarettes. You would have been distracted into lecturing me about smoking.” Sherlock preened a bit more.
“Not quite,” Sherlock replied. “New Scotland Yard arrested the grandnephew on charges of criminal damage.  The boy was released on bail to his mother just before I called you.  Due to the hour, DI Lestrade put off processing the paperwork until tomorrow morning.  However...”
“What royal or even noble family would sacrifice one of their children to the curse that lies upon us?” interrupted the tsar.
“Dr Foucault? Sherlock Holmes.  Will you be at the university for some while yet?...  Yes, it’s in connection with the case...  Excellent.  Dr Watson and I will be there shortly.”
The baggage crew got busy unloading the plane, strewing the passengers’ bags and cases across the tarmac.  After a moment, people started searching about for their belongings.  The assistants came forward and helped, calling out names from luggage tags.  John was quickly able to locate his suitcase and duffel bag, although juggling them with the cane was tricky.
Abruptly, Ivan could neither draw breath nor expel it.  His lungs, the muscles of his throat and chest had ceased to function.  He could only stand, trying to fight down the rising panic as the edges of his vision darkened.
owner of the corpse at our feet was reported missing.  Then he handed me the envelope, told me it was for you and left.  Look, I think he might have the right idea.  Not just about the quiet.  This flat...  John, it’s getting to be a bit of tip.”
John’s embarrassed interest in Sherlock’s love life evaporated, to be replaced by the beginnings of anger.
Sherlock tensed hard enough to break bones, yelled a single syllable against John’s skin and came, his semen splattering John’s hand and his own stomach.
watch your mouth!  I heard Nelly Markham the next block over already put a complaint about you into the Committee not even a month ago.  You want another complaint filed, you just keep talking.”
Miranda Caustlin burst into fresh tears and extracted a wad of tissues from her purse. “Yes.  That’s him, that’s Uncle Don.  He’s really...”  Her mouth formed a letter D but she was crying too hard to go on.  She turned towards her son, who looked lost in the face of his mother’s sorrow but who put an awkward arm around her shoulders.
“The man you’re here to meet tonight isn’t coming.” Sherlock, thank god, had come up behind the blonde’s shoulder.  “This isn’t the first time he’s stood you up, but it’s the last.  You’ll find him unavailable after this.  The lackluster quality of your sexual relationship isn’t enough to make up for the fact that it’s become obvious you’re not soulmates.  John, we’re leaving now.”
Eventually Mycroft got rid of the minions and John got rid of Mycroft before Sherlock inflicted any more physical damage on his brother. John couldn’t say that he himself was sorry to see Mycroft in pain.
Hesitating only a moment, Mycroft answered grimly, "If he were to lose you... that would be the end of him, John. I'm convinced of it."
Greg chuckled and knelt down behind his sub. He leant forward and bit his boy's shoulder, stopping just short of breaking skin.
Sherlock ground his teeth, surprised he was continuing to control himself. Maybe it was the 'girlfriend' comment. The moment Eurus had uttered it, Irene had released Mycroft's cock and taken a step back. It was obvious she was struggling to control herself.
Feeling the need to regain control, “I will never punish you when I am angry. If I feel my temper is likely to get the better of me, I’ll leave you in time out until I am calm enough to deal with you.”
Sherlock nodded mutely, but John didn’t push for a verbal response. The sub was clearly confused enough as it was.
It wasn’t that much longer than the first half of Sherlock’s trip before the detective came in through the door.
Sherlock swallowed a lump in his throat. "I love you too." He set Finn down in the bubbly water, scooping up a handful of bubbles and placing them on his son's head.
What concerned the doctor was the choice of restaurant Mycroft had made. He hadn't told them where they were going but they were clearly driving too far for it to actually be Angelos. He just hoped the kids wouldn’t be too bored wherever they ended up.
John tipped his head on one side, regarding Sherlock for a minute, he supposed he could understand that. "We need to eat. But first," he leant forward to remove the buckle from his collar to the armbinder.
By the time she finished with the chair, it was nothing more than splinters. She stood over the pieces, breathing heavily with her fingers tangled in his hair.
"I want an apology first," John said, stepping back and still holding the gag. "I want you to apologise to me for your attitude and your childish behaviour and then you are going to beg me to gag you."
They peered into Sherlock's room first. He seemed calm enough, but he didn't seem to have noticed their presence yet.
Sherlock sat on the bunk and watched as the cell door slammed in his face. This wasn't good. This was really bad. He wanted John. He wanted to go back to his Dom's house. He'd sit on that god damn chair if it meant getting out of here.
The next morning, much to Sherlock's little complaints and protests (which was far more than it had been the night before), Mycroft carried his brother down the stairs and settled him in one of the taller chairs at the table.
It took a while, but the sub was eventually calm enough to follow the older man out of the bedroom and towards the stairs. “Yes, sir.” Even now he was being shown kindness. He watched the Dom’s hand around his as they walked.
Irene paced between the two kneeling Holmeses for a while before pausing and glancing at the screen. "What would you like me to do to them now, Eurus?"
“What's that supposed to mean?” He frowned in confusion, trying to work out what she was going on about.
Of course. He should have predicted that. Sherlock, still facing the window, closed his eyes. This entire thing was making him slow. Too much of his brain power was preoccupied with the upcoming trial. He wouldn't be able to concentrate on a case even if one came his way.
Sherlock closed his eyes. Not through choice! His scream was internal, which was probably a good thing.
John was watching his sub cautiously as Mycroft glanced between them. “Well, yes, little brother. Too much leg work involved on this one. What are you-“
John frowned as he tried to recall his history classes from school.  “I thought that was Wat Tyler?”
Sherlock went out to see Lestrade’s betologist and returned quite pleased, with reams of notes indecipherable to anyone but himself, not because they were encrypted but because Sherlock’s handwriting was just that bad.
That focused cerulean gaze was unnerving John.  “After all, it’s been 14 years, it would be entirely natural, I was hardly celibate myself...”  Damn, now he was babbling.
“That plus the fact that Angie Stevens’ corpse was found in a room that could be sealed to be almost airtight.  The one window had been painted shut, and the door shut so tightly that it took Lestrade a considerable amount of effort to open it again.”
Left to himself to work the problem out, John did so and smiled. A brand new, high quality parka would draw the wrong kind of attention to a homeless man. A parka with visible signs of wear, much less so. And a cast-off – “Here, my brother gave me this, give it to someone else if you don’t want it” – might be easier to accept than an overly extravagant gift.
After that first evening, he never said two words to John, including the phrase, “Thank you.” He did, however, deign to accept cups of tea.  And occasionally the leftover take-away that John had meant to keep for lunch the next day mysteriously vanished from the refrigerator.
“Today we saw two people make vows. I’ve never made a vow in my life, and after tonight I never will again. So, here in front of you all, my first and last vow. Mary and John: whatever it takes, whatever happens, from now on I swear I will
Ivan drew his sword with both hands and stabbed viciously upwards into the base of the nearest man’s unarmoured skull.  Then he yanked the blade free, slashed another man across the eyes, kicked out at a third and was almost in time to block a thrust from a fourth.  Almost, but not completely – he deflected the main force of the blow, but the guard’s blade still tore through his surcoat and shirt, into the flesh below.  Ivan felt hot blood began to seep into the shirt.
“That’s it. The Yarders figure that’s a lot more likely than Sherlock actually finding a soulmate.  But
“But not fatally,” Sherlock insisted. He started to lean forward, winced and lay back again. “And not before asking if you were with me. Your presence in the building would have created a problem for Mary. She couldn’t have let you become a suspect in Magnussen’s murder. She would have had to shoot me in any case, but she also would have had to leave Magnussen alive.”
In the meantime, John went to work each day. He stopped for groceries and take-away on the way back to Baker Street so that he’d have something to eat and if he bought a bit extra, it was only because it seemed polite.  He tidied up around the flat, partly so that Mrs Hudson wouldn’t have to and partly because Greg’s tip remark had stung.  He’d got out of the habit of taking care of things like that and needed practice, so he was practicing on Sherlock’s flat, that was all.
“First off, I wouldn’t call your dealer a ‘friend.’ If you killed him, the world’s probably better off for it.”
“One evening, he persuaded the boy to accompany him to the university. He’d almost certainly read Dr Campbell-Williams’ comments in die Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung predicting an imminent breakthrough.  He knew where you work.  He found an unlocked door...”
Sherlock sat up immediately, straddling John, looking imperiously debauched. He locked eyes with John, put his long-fingered hands to his own throat and began to unbutton his shirt. John’s mouth went dry. He couldn’t look away, couldn’t help licking his lips, but he managed to croak, “Bedroom?”
Sherlock looked so exasperated that John jumped in before he could say something scathing and incriminating.  “Souvenir of an amateur production of Hamlet.  If you’re not going to go look at the bedroom right away, my husband would like to get dressed.”
John discreetly checked his watch.  Five more minutes, he promised himself.  Five more minutes and he’d stop looking for a conversational break into which he could insert his farewells.  Five more minutes and he’d just walk out.
Something in John’s heart started to sing. He reached across the table and took Sherlock’s hands. “I guess I shouldn’t forget who’s the genius in this family, should I?”
John found himself at loose ends once he arrived back at Baker Street.  He’d regained his breath on the ride home.  Once he’d divested himself of his jacket and tucked the gun away underneath the mattress in the bedroom, he wasn’t sure what to do next.  Wait for word from Sherlock, presumably.
Sherlock’s text alert went off. “Name, address and phone number for his betologist!” Sherlock leapt to his feet and headed for his Belstaff.
“I knew that the results would have to be tested. Since I was working undercover, as it were, my access to subjects was limited to two laboratory rats borrowed from the university’s cages.  I chose two with easily identifiable markings so that I could release them back into the cages for the day and then retrieve them again.”
.  Raised in England, mainly but not exclusively in Lancashire.  Spent a significant portion of her adult life in the States, you can tell by her vowels, but returned to the UK some years ago – more than three, less than ten.”
John’s mind supplied an altogether superfluous and horrific image of how Sherlock might have ‘motivated’ this Victor fellow.
Foucault looked slightly shocked. “Yes, of course!  What do you think?  Then again, in view of what happened, I suppose it is not an unreasonable question.  Yes, we ran trials.  We ran them on samples of skin and of muscle tissue.  We did not... run tests on bone.”
John made note of the café’s location. For a man who was married to his work, Sherlock was showing something of a talent for finding good places to bring a date.
“I do hear you and thank you for your counsel... gospozha,” replied Ivan, and was pleased to see her blush and smile slightly.  Perhaps if things didn’t work out with her friend Marfa, he could come back and court Manya herself.  It wouldn’t be the worst idea.
“Precisely.  The walls are bespelled to sound an alert if I fly directly overhead and we’re likely to be spotted if I keep circling around the outside, but we should be able to find a good vantage point among the trees.”  Sherlock held out its, no,
“There was no case, it was death by incompetence.” Sherlock turned away slightly as he hiked his nursing tunic up a bit to slip Madeleine into his pouch.
Right, Watson, John berated himself. Really smooth.  Your best friend tells you how he lost his soulmate, so you decide that’s a good time to kiss him.
in a way that the other had not been.  Ivan had long looked on his companion with appreciation and a fair bit of awe, but the growing warmth he now felt in the pit of his belly was new – and not unwelcome, at least not to him.  What Sherlock might be feeling, he had no idea, and so he stood quite still, waiting to see what Sherlock would do.
.  You can choose to destroy both hearts – or neither.  I suppose you could even destroy one heart at random, just to find out whose it is.  Are you a gambling man, Vanechka?”  Muircheartaigh giggled again.  The sound scraped at Ivan’s ears.
enjoyed the trial run would cause John to refuse to allow Sherlock to reciprocate.  Ever.  He had adopted the stance that since John was a novice, his learning experience should start with a demonstration provided by, of course, Sherlock.
John pulled himself together. If Sherlock wanted to talk now, John was damn well going to listen. “Neither. The fettucini is fine and
“Seems to be a long list, as far as I can tell. I keep following leads and then having them vanish. Or get cut off.”
Shezza? God, no!  He’d be all too likely to forget what he was doing in a drug-induced haze and bite down.  And yet...  John found himself imagining Sherlock on his knees, dressed in Shezza’s ragged layers, looking up through his lashes with clear, knowing eyes.  Not Shezza, but Sherlock Holmes playing the
“They’ve got him on a higher floor this time. Also, you might want to post a constable or two outside his door. Protective custody for a material witness in your investigation.”
“I said that maybe Magnussen had a Mind Palace, like you two. Look, it was meant to be a joke, ignore it. I’m making tea, do you want some?”
“I don’t mean past-you.  I mean you now.  You and me now, with all we’ve learned.  Sherlock, if you thought there was any real chance of this harming Rosie, you wouldn’t have ever mentioned it.”
The hours trudged by. He went into work because sitting at home doing nothing would have been unbearable.  Greg called from time to time to ask this or that irrelevant question, all of them really amounting to nothing more than, “Hang on, we’re working on it.”
Campbell-Williams wore a simple black dress with her hair in a messy knot instead of its usual messy ponytail. She also wore a wire, although this was not visible to the casual observer.  She looked remarkably poised for a civilian – far more poised than her dinner companion.  Wentworth was a handsome middle-aged man whose fine dark suit advertised his broad shoulders but didn’t do much for the visible sheen of sweat on his face.
“Sherlock, whatever you want. I swear, whatever you want. But if you want to save something, something for the third date... Sherlock!” He got hold of Sherlock’s chin and tipped it up. They were practically nose to nose. “If you want to save something for the third date, we have to stop now.”
“John” – Sherlock touched his shoulder – “wait before you decide.” He walked towards Mary and gestured at her neck. “If I may?”
John hadn’t quite understood at the time.  He did now.  Four sausage rolls for five dollars and a pushcart vendor who was all too happy to get dollars instead of pounds.
“Magnussen wasn’t supposed to be there. Sherlock said he inveigled Ms Hawkins into giving him Magnussen’s schedule, which is why she was pissed off at him. The whole story hangs together, but it doesn’t leave me much to go on.”
“We need to enter separately.  I’ll go first.  Wait three minutes before following.  Order some common kind of beer or ale and then act as if you're waiting for someone.  Don’t stand or sit too close to where I am.”
“Victor’s parents certainly seemed to think it was.  They wanted me executed.  They used the circumstances of Carl Power’s death to argue for this sentence and won the support of both the other nobles and the commoners.  My brother barely managed to arrange for me to be exiled instead.”
“My anus was still stinging from the cayenne paste you gave me to apply, and the dried semen all over my arse
“Case.  Also, I prefer honey.  Shower... you may be correct.”  Sherlock reached up, ran his fingers through his hair and then sniffed at them.  As he did so, his dressing gown sleeve fell back.
“Just so.  Especially considering that the UBR has significant differences in political and economic structure.”
John lurched awake as the driver hit the bus’ brakes and horn hard, cursing all the while.  It was dark outside now, but they seemed to be near the centre of the city.
Happily bemused, John made two mugs of tea and a plate of toast, then took them to the sofa. When he sat down, Sherlock leaned – really, almost cuddled – against him, sitting up straight only to make the occasional addition to his notes.
“Well, well,” said the stranger, “Isn’t this an unexpected pleasure?”  The motion of his hands sketching another shape was the last thing Ivan remembered.
He looked away from Lestrade to watch as Sherlock traced another character on the whiteboard. When Sherlock turned suddenly, their eyes met.  “
“Yeah, well, if she was in Sherlock’s pouch right this minute she’d have her face inches away from a dead body.” Both men looked over to where Sherlock was deducing the corpse, then back at Madeleine, who appeared to be studying Lestrade in return.
It was with this glorious feeling still thrumming through this mind that John heard Sherlock give his final speech of the evening.
Beset from all sides, Clara had finally had enough.  The marriage had not been performed according to the rites of her homeland.  It would be easy enough for her to have it annulled there.  She had packed her personal jewels and belongings, gathered together those courtiers and servants still loyal to her and ridden out, heading for the border.
When Mary cursed “whatever bloody fucking idiot thought up this arsehole method of getting bloody fucking children born,” Sherlock started to point out that the child wasn’t going to come out her ars... mmmph!
Sherlock lifted his violin back into position.  When the music next soared and stumbled, he was ready for it.  The opening notes of John’s theme slid into the brief moment between stumble and fall, and the fall... changed.  Was somehow tempered.  It sank as low as before but suddenly, there was a whisper of promise.
John kept in touch with Sherlock after the wedding, of course. Not every day but at least once a week. Perhaps every two weeks. Or so. Certainly it hadn’t been longer than a month –
“There would also have been mud on the dress shoes worn by the killer, a man of about my height but with a heavier build.”  Anderson stopped sneering.  Lestrade nodded and John grinned outright.  “And I’ll need the files for the other cases,” Sherlock went on.
Chills had started running down John’s spine at the first words.  By the time Nigel was finished, they’d pooled into a pit of cold low in his belly.
“No, dear, but it’s easier for people here to say,” Marfa Hudovna replied composedly.  “My husband Boris was from this country.  Oh, he was a fine-looking man!  And when we first married, he treated me like a queen.  But after that nasty business with the Powers boy, Sherlock left the court, ah, his mother’s household.”  She shot Ivan a quick glance, as if to see if he’d noticed the slip.
Sherlock ignored her. “I told you this would happen, John. Mrs Hudson did what people always do. She observed a bare fraction of the available details, made up a hypothesis and then instead of
Sometime later it occurred to John that if neither of them got a flannel and wiped up, they’d be stuck together in the morning. But Sherlock had already collapsed next to him and gone to sleep. John was still mulling the problem over when he fell asleep too.
“I had no need to break in. You left John with the job of clearing everything out. He arranged to have a charity come around to pick up the contents. He also gave Bill Wiggins the keys so that Wiggins could be there to let the charity’s volunteers in.”
“Boring. The body in the canal wasn’t the one the police were looking for, which in turn wasn’t the one they
was different from his uni days and different again from the man who’d hit Canada after five years of sand and dust and heat and blood in Afghanistan.  Hell, it was a wonder the Canadian government hadn’t locked them all up, him and his mates, kept them in custody until they calmed down a bit.
to escape. Not you, never you.” He added another finger, stroking, massaging, but when he withdrew his hand, Sherlock grabbed him suddenly and flipped them over.
The men whispered among themselves, believing the bird to be a bad omen.  “Come on,” said the tsarevich to hearten them, “We’ve fought enemies far more fearsome and won!  Will you be scared of a bird?”
John sniffed the corpse’s mouth.  There was something there – something acrid? – but it was faint and gone almost as soon as he noticed it.  “No scent of alcohol.  Drugs are a possibility.”
“No, your partner’s got a point. I just...  I just wish I didn’t feel like such an idiot for marrying David in the first place.”
One man, pale and silent, didn’t seem to realize at first that the bread was food.  He sniffed it cautiously and eventually licked it, but made no move to put it into his mouth.  The woman sitting next to him tore off a bite-size piece, placed it in his mouth and gently began to move his jaw up and down.  After a moment, he began chewing on his own.
Sherlock shrugged. “Some people might question my motives in expediting your wife’s departure from the country and your own re-establishment in 221B.”
It wasn’t until Sherlock straightened that John realized he hadn’t already been standing to his full height. Forget the gunfight images. Sherlock was a sword blade, long and slim and deadly.
“Any chance that Wentworth might be responsible for the threatening messages Campbell-Williams received?”
The door at the top of the stairs opened before he could knock.  John looked up – and up again.  God, the man was tall.  And exotically gorgeous, with his almond-shaped eyes, high cheekbones and full lips.
noted the age – or lack thereof – of Sherlock’s scars while Sherlock was in the hospital. He’d been much more focussed on the fact that his best friend was fighting to stay alive. But John had seen the scars many times since.
Already beginning to sit down, John rose back up to his feet.  “Speaking both from experience and as a doctor, I can assure you that psychosomatic pain is still genuinely
John didn’t hesitate.  They ran down the alley, which led to a flight of stairs, with Sherlock giving instructions all the way.  “Down the stairs, turn left, 80 metres on, knock the sand off your shoes and go back up.  Get home as quick as you can.”
John nodded.  “Just transferred in.  And about to be transferred right out again, if he doesn’t shape up.”
“The man needs to buy a jacket with larger pockets.  Envelope he forgot to mail sticking out of one pocket.  The return address is for Pecksniff & Watson, Brokers.  Your cousin doesn’t have first billing.  Small bag from a pharmacy sticking out of the other pocket, complete with label.  He picked up something ending in -mycin for Patricia Watson.  Kept glancing out the window as we spoke, expecting someone.  Well-made clothes and shoes, would have originally been quite pricey but they’re being worn past the time a well-off man would replace them.  He can no longer afford to.”
Ivan dressed carefully.  He poured Harrieta’s jewels out of their case onto a piece of cloth, wrapped them up and tucked this smaller bundle inside his shirt.  Then he pulled on his leather surcoat, belted his sword on over it and picked up his walking stick.
Mrs Hudson was of the opinion that Rosamund was interested only in the motions rather than the music, which missed the point entirely.  Music wasn’t just a noise that came out of nowhere.  It was tied to motion – playing an instrument, singing, dancing.  Once you understood that, you could hear the motion in the music even when it was recorded.  Certainly a former exotic dancer ought to realize this?
Ivan requested horses and an escort of soldiers for a journey to the capital, then sat up late that night writing letters by lamplight to his father, Harrieta and Uilleam an t-Moireach.  He asked his father to render his companions all assistance in returning to their homes or wherever else they might want to go.  Andreyev had already declared, with surprising ferocity, his determination to return to his former lord’s castle and to find out what had happened to his wife.  Tyuleneva had declared – and this was no surprise – that she would accompany Andreyev.  Ivan suggested in his letter to his father that it might be appropriate to lend the pair an armed escort as well, in case Tyuleneva should need back-up.
She giggled, shook her head and returned to the paper. “All the quotes are from her, none from Dexter... Oh, dear.”
Oh. John glanced at the bedroom door. It remained closed, as it had been when they returned home the night before. He looked back at Sherlock, laying visual siege to the kettle instead of trying to concentrate on work. Nerves?
“Let him,” advised Sherlock from the sofa. “You need to walk out the door looking like my birthmother, and she’d never hesitate to accept his offer.”
“When I happened on her and Magnussen” – he was breathing heavily, why was he breathing so heavily? – “she had a problem. More specifically, she had a witness. The solution, of course, was simple. Kill us both and leave.”
Muircheartaigh giggled unpleasantly and spoke for the first time in his own voice.  “Efficient.  I like it.  But no qualms about misleading the unwary – or the stupid?  No misgivings deep in your heart?  Oh, silly me, I’ve forgot!  You don’t have one.”
daughter. He licked his lips and then blushed, knowing that Sherlock had to have noticed the gesture.
Ivan casually fell in alongside her.  “So,” he began after they’d covered a few yards.  “I was a soldier, and Svinarnikov was a guard.  Where’d
explanations, and that takes time. Forced to choose between explaining and saving your life, John Watson, I will
After this Sherlock seemed to lapse into a sort of reverie that lasted until they arrived at the former St Bart’s.  Then he sprang from the car, leaving John to pay the driver as before.  It occurred to John that he really needed to get hold of some British currency so that he could save his Canadian dollars for true emergencies.
“Piss off,” said Ives sourly. And then to the husky young constable with the handcuffs, “I said piss off!  You can’t cuff me, my wrist’s broken!”
“We won’t be exiting by the usual door.  Hurry, this way!”  Ivan followed Sherlock out of the hall and through a tangle of corridors, struggling to keep up with the other’s longer, claw-footed strides.  “Your friend Sanka wishes you luck, by the way.”
Sherlock sat up abruptly, stared at John for approximately 34 seconds and then relaxed. “No you wouldn’t.  But as regards your boxes, you’ve been here almost a month.  Very little of what remained in your previous flat was yours – you’d brought most of your own things over already.  Everything else is in 221C.  Mrs Hudson said that if you didn’t want to go through it yourself, she has a friend who volunteers with Oxfam who would take care of it for you.”
Ivan called out for help, to Misha, to Harrieta, to his horse, but the only answer came from the flames themselves.  He could almost but never quite make out words in their crackling and hissing.  He took a step closer, trying to catch what they were saying, then realized what he was doing and stepped back.  But when he stepped back the fire followed.  It came up behind him, as unexpectedly as Harrieta, and then he was surrounded, the flames licking at his bare feet.
“Drug manufacture and use.  You’re obviously wondering how much of Anderson’s babbling was the truth.”
Marfa Hudovna brought Ivan a glass of hot tea and then a plate of freshly baked pirozhki filled with beef and onions.  She kept him company as he ate, asking many questions about his life as a soldier and his journey to find a spouse and somewhere to settle down.  She sounded so genuinely kind and interested that Ivan felt vaguely guilty.  Nothing he told her was a lie, but he was certainly leaving out some important pieces of the truth.
Ivan, finally realizing why the sack had never offered plums or apricots, replied, “This tree has helped me more than you know, gospozha.”
John let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding, slung his duffle over his good shoulder and took hold of his cane with that hand, using the other hand to manage his suitcase.  As he started forward another man, already heading for the Inverness bus, turned to argue.  “How come he gets to go to London and we’re being shipped up to bloody Scotland?”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed. “Skills don’t get jobs, John – credentials do.  I’d been expelled from university with nothing to show for my years there except a cocaine addiction.  If Mycroft had been able to lay hands on me, he would have had me locked up.  I didn’t
Moments later Sherlock, sleep-deprived for days, began to emit soft snores, the curse of the weak-chinned.  The noise itself wouldn’t have bothered John – he’d always found it rather comforting to know that his bunkmates were still breathing – but he’d already spent half the day sleeping and was still wired from the events of the evening.  Sleep was elusive.
He put the kettle on for tea and considered the possibility of an early supper, seeing how he’d missed lunch.  “Sherlock, I’m making toasted cheese.  D’you want some?”
John had never in his life felt so much like shooting something, and that included his time in Afghanistan.
“Mr Holmes. Don’t bother to return to reprints you removed from the lab after you got me out of the room.  I’ve already obtained copies – and re-read them.  I take it that our vandal was that poor bastard who had his hand amputated after that muck-up of Blessington’s four decades ago?  Robert’s still feeling guilty over that.  God knows why, as he was only a graduate student at the time and it wasn’t his decision.  Still, I’m not surprised that he had the university drop the charges.”
By the time John had escaped upstairs, found homes for his new books and browsed through several trying to decide which to read first, the afternoon was well past.  Something light for supper, he thought, so he made himself an omelet.  For once he could understand Sherlock’s refusal to eat anything, but Sherlock was a civilian through and through.  John had been a soldier and had learned to eat and sleep when he could.
She gave John a cheeky smile and then headed for the exit. At the door, she turned, smiled at him again and then left.
John swallowed dryly and his face hardened, “What.” It wasn’t a question, it was a statement. John didn’t like Jim... He didn't like Jim at all... in fact he hated the little worm! He always tried to outsmart him and to be the best at everything! He tried to steal all of John's boyfriends and beat him at the science fair and even steal some of his clients. He hated Jim more than he hated anyone in his whole entire life, but Sebby had been a good friend to him and his heart broke for the man. Well, as much as it can when you don’t actually have a heart.
“I did, Sherlock. It was time. Even if my body told me I wasn’t ready… I should have done this a long time ago. I just was caring about what people thought rather than what you thought and how you felt. I’m sorry, Sherlock, I’ll do better, I promise.”
John couldn’t help it... he tried to stop the tears from coming, but they came anyway and John hated that. At least they were silent and he wasn’t ugly sobbing, Sherlock was also there for him and not put off by the water works so that was something to be grateful for. Sherlock kept hitting his prostate over and over again and soon he was coming and clenching around Sherlock in the most pleasant way. He whimpered and cried while he pressed his face in Sherlock's neck, just breathing him in. He would miss Sherlock's smell the most he thought.
“There. Now we are even.” He smiled up at John and then rolled over to cuddle with him. “Just don’t do it again...” He whispered, so quietly he didn’t know if John even heard him, but he must have because he felt John brush his hair out of his face and nod slowly.
sorry... I may be a tad obsessed with this song at the moment and it's playing currently... so like I fixed it up a bit to fit... ahahahhah! for anyone out there wondering it's I Write The Songs by Barry Manilow
Sherlock banged his head on the desk and growled at John, “What part of ‘you are the worst person to live with and I’m
“And you seem to have stayed with me... you really didn’t need to.” He frowned some and pursed his lips.
find that man. He would make him pay. So Mycroft just sighed, brought him some clothes, and the two of them worked on trying to find Sigar Holmes together.
“John... we- we thought you were dead... we didn’t get any letters from you...” He swallowed thickly and shifted slightly, how had he let this happen? Where were the letters going? Because it certainly wasn’t to them.
“Sherlock is like a really dry pie. You keep having to break off his layers of crust before you get to the centre of his heart. He doesn’t let just anyone in.. You have to be special, but sadly no one in his life really, really liked pie… So after the third or fourth layer they just gave up. They figured that that pie didn’t have any filling and that it was just a pan full of crust. I know that’s not true… and to be honest it pains me that he died not knowing that he could be loved. Thinking that no one cared for him and that life just sucked. That he was unlovable… Because that isn’t the case at all.” John whispered and swallowed as he looked down.
. Mycroft swallowed and turned around as he watched John's face contort into pain, he placed his umbrella in front of him, stood up ramrod straight, and waited.
“And what did you do that my brilliance wouldn’t be able to fix?” He sat down next to Sherlock and then wrapped his arms around his little brother, it was an awkward movement and something he never thought he would be doing in his life, but it felt right...
Sherlock just laid there because he hated talking and he rarely ever talked lately. Only when he really needed to and that was very seldom. Mycroft worried and so did his mother, but he couldn’t help feel this way... Brian worried too, but in his own way… Sherlock thought it was more of a worry to losing Sherlock and not being able to have him, rather than a worry about Sherlock's actual life. He closed his eyes and Brian finally injected the fluid into his arm. It took long enough for him to find it, but Sherlock just assumed that it was because he didn’t want it to burn or something or another. The liquid filled his vein and Sherlock gasped and arched his back. It was like a rush he had never experienced and colour was brought to life – still not what it would look like if John were here, but there was colour instead of gray!
Sherlock frowned and nodded, he really didn’t like that tone of voice, but sat down anyway, “What is it?”
John felt another wave of anger wash over him just as his mobile started buzzing again, “Sherlock…” He said in a warning tone. He was not a happy camper at the moment and Sherlock wasn’t going to shimmy his way out of this one.
The DI smiled and looked at Sherlock. “Yesterday night John here came to me. I tried to get him to go away, but he was very insistent. I told him I didn’t have time for his childish games and he begged me to give him just ten minutes… so I did. He told me about the crime scene and about what had happened and then he told me to question the husband. When I told him that that case was already closed and they had taken the son into custody he begged me to reopen it. Just to talk to the husband and interrogate him more than we did. I told him that wasn’t possible, but he has a lot of faith in you… He said that if he was wrong then he would take the blame and that we could throw him in jail for a couple of days because he wasted our time. So I thought to myself ‘a young boy like this. With such a brilliant future ahead of him was willing to risk it all away because he had such faith in this Sherlock Holmes character.’ So I agreed and I’ll be damned. After five minutes he confessed to killing his wife. He found out she was cheating on him with another man and he lost it and then tried to blame the son... You’re a brilliant man Sherlock Holmes. It would be an honour if you were to work with us one day.”
John ignored him and kept hitting his father. He kept punching him until his hand was bleeding and then he continued to punch him some more. He couldn’t even feel the pain in his hands as he heard the crack of bone under his knuckles. He only saw red, he honestly thought that was an expression. Apparently it was not.
Sherlock only told John to leave because he was about to break down and he didn’t want John to see that, he had seen enough of that. The door slowly shut and Sherlock rested his head on the edge of the bed and sobbed. He tried to be quiet because he didn’t want to wake his mother. She needed her sleep, but she happened to wake up anyway.
“It stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space. I think the name rather gives it away, but it travels through time and space! Anywhere you wanna go anytime!” He smirked as he watched Sherlock's face light up.
, it was about destroying my son.” He huffed a bit. “Your words were meaningless to me and again, since this wasn’t about you I respected your privacy.”
A couple of hours later John woke up and tried to get out of bed, but collapsed almost immediately and groaned. His whole body felt achy, his head hurt so much, and his legs were clearly not working at the moment. He tried to think back to why he was hurting, but he couldn’t remember anything really. He tried to climb back onto the bed to reach Sherlock, but just ended up groaning some more. “Sherlock… Sherlock! Wake up…”
Sherlock noticed though and frowned slightly, what did he possibly do now? He had just been sitting there. “Yes, John?” he asked as he closed his laptop and sat back.
Sherlock grinned from ear to ear, “We are going into that arcade place!” He sung and started skipping towards the door.
John, instead of being angry… instead of yelling at him, or throwing things, did the opposite of what Sherlock expected. He gave a small smile and lifted his shoulder up just so, barely noticeable, but Sherlock still saw it. “Me too.”
Sherlock gasped and then came a couple of seconds later, he snickered and pulled John down on top of him. He didn’t care if John landed in his mess... he wasn’t about to let go of John – or the dog tags for that matter.
“Oh... no... I wouldn’t do that... you should give it a week.” He should probably prepare Sherlock for this... If John just showed up announced, he would see what Sherlock had been getting himself into, and Sherlock would probably end it right there. Cursing his brain for playing such cruel tricks on him. Or John would end up leaving him because of Sherlock's new life choices… Honestly, neither outcome was a good one.
“Tell me... Who is going to find you Mycroft? Who is coming? Because your dear, heartbroken brother can’t even find you. It makes him feel like a failure. How does that make big brother feel?” He smirked.
They went back to the flat and John sat down. He took a few deep breaths and then walked into the kitchen. He grabbed a bag of Sherlock's experiments and put it down the disposal.
"John..." She whispered quietly and walked over until she was sat on the edge of the bed. "I have something for you..." God, he looked awful. He had dark circles under his eyes and he honestly looked like an empty shell, he looked exhausted, but she knew it was probably impossible for him to sleep right now.
he thought briefly with a small smile. His eyes fell shut, but then opened when he thought about Harry. He wanted to tell her to come with him, to tell her that Sherlock has plenty of space and that he wouldn’t mind, but when he looked at the spot she was recently standing in… she wasn’t there. He sighed as he realised she must have already ran off now that she knew John wasn’t in any danger. He let his eyes slip closed again as Sherlock carried him to the car and back to a place where he could call home.
John was sobbing and he pressed his face into Sherlock’s hair. “But I don’t want you to be an orb of fucking light!! I want you to be Sherlock! My Sherlock! A Sherlock who is here and living and breathing with me and please!! Please just hold on!!”
John looked up from across the lunch table and to what was known as ‘Sherlock’s tree’. He always sat there and people tended to stay as far away from the tree as much as possible… unless of course you were going to pick on him. John smiled as he watched Sherlock read ‘Treasure Island’, obviously he couldn’t make out the book from that far away, but Sherlock had spoken to him in detail about it the other night. John didn’t want to bring it up because he didn’t want to cross a line he didn’t know existed, but that book was so worn he imagined that Sherlock had read, and reread, it a lot. Though, he did want to ask Sherlock about it. Ask him if that book maybe brought him comfort when nothing else would, or could. Their relationship was just so new though that John was treading lightly, still learning what he could and couldn’t say. Sherlock, however, looked so beautiful sitting up against the tree trunk and the sun—
, I took my chance.” He gave a long suffering sigh at that, thinking of how exhausting all of this had been for him.
John opened his mouth to speak, but couldn’t find his voice so he cleared his throat and tried again, “Do what...” He said and he wasn’t even sure if Sherlock could hear him, it was so weak.
John rolled his eyes, but kept the flower in his hair anyway. He walked around the garden taking in each and every flower that he possibly could while Sherlock followed close behind. He got to the middle of the garden and realised there was a little stony path. He looked over at Sherlock to ask if he was allowed to go on the stony path. Sherlock smiled and nodded and so John slowly moved his feet and started walking through the trees on the path. When he got to the end the trees opened up to a beautiful secret secluded area. There was a stone bench in the middle of the grassy area and a little waterfall right next to it. John could hear birds chirping up in the trees and the sun beamed down from the sky, the light making the water sparkle. The only sorts of flowers in the area were tulips. John gasped as he took it all in, it was absolutely breath taking. He had never seen anything like it before. He turned and looked at Sherlock who walked up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist while resting his chin on John's shoulder.
John shook his head again. He swallowed and looked at the kind man in front of him. “I’m John…” He said quietly.
Mike blinked rapidly, “umm why have you thrown this at me...?” He frowned as he watched John shred off his Westwood jacket, take off his button down shirt, and then walked over to the tile. He didn’t understand why John was getting half naked, but Mike didn’t understand a lot of things John did so he never questioned anything.
“My body… It just… It feels so, so heavy, like a rock! But it also feels like I’m floating! Mmmm. Sherlock!! Sherlock!! Am I a bird??” He burst into giggles at the thought of being a bird. That would be so nice, he could go anywhere he wanted. He really hoped he had turned into a bird because that would be nice.
“John! John!! Calm down!! I just need to know what you took so I can figure out how to help you… I’m not angry…” He spoke softly.
Blake frowned a bit, but didn’t say anything. He watched as John slowly guided his hand towards him and then John gently set the palm of his hand down on his groin. John groaned softly and let his head fall back against the back of the couch. He let go of Blake’s wrist and then rested both hands behind his head.
“Plus, you two didn’t end on a good note... I’m rather excited. You jump. John lives a miserable life, until he inevitably breaks your promise. Or you stay... and you watch John get shot in the head. Your choice.” Moriarty growled. “Sometimes the only choices you have are bad ones, but you still have to choose.” He said lowly, his eyes flickering all over Sherlock's face.
John hummed when he felt Sherlock get harder. He licked up the clothed shaft and put the head into his mouth. He sucked softly as his hands moved up and down Sherlock's chest before settling on Sherlock's dog tags, holding them tightly in his hand.
John groaned, “if you would let me finish.” He grumbled as he narrowed his eyes, Sherlock at least had the decency to look apologetic. He took a breath and tried this again. Right then. Rip the plaster off. “Sherlock, I’m joining the army.”
The door opened and the woman blinked rapidly when her eyes fell on her son, “John…?” She swallowed slightly and wrapped her cardigan tighter around her body.
Brian thought about this and then a slow smile spread across his lips. He saw the way John was looking at him…and this would only prove his theory. He had his suspicions on Friday when he saw them actually
John rolled his eyes a bit. “I thought it was rather obvious... Don’t make me spell it out for you.”
John would have laughed if the situation was different, Sherlock trying to be ordinary was always hilarious to him. “Not when I know that’s not actually the reason you called, and the fact you hate small talk.”
John screamed and sobbed as the car door jerked opened. Mycroft was standing there wide eyed. “Shit… John! Get him into my car now!!”
Soon they were all dressed and ready. They were both still sporting headaches, but Sherlock tried to push that feeling away. Though, it wasn’t working and that made him angry and a tad bit annoyed. They walked for what felt like miles and Sherlock had absolutely no idea where they were... though, he would never admit it. He also knew John didn’t understand why they didn’t get a cab, but Sherlock couldn’t exactly tell the cabbie the address so walking it was.
how do you put hyperlinks (or links) in your notes?! *me from the future. i dont think anyone answered that question and thats so sad to me. hahahahha *It's 2019 and this question is still relevant to me.
John stood there for a minute staring at the floor before he nodded and slowly made his way over to Sherlock. He climbed into the bed and nuzzled himself into Sherlock's arms. The warmth of Sherlock wrapping around his naked back soothed him and he closed his eyes. “It’s my fault…” he whispered.
Sherlock just smiled as he wrapped his arms around John and closed his eyes. Minutes passed before he spoke again. “What are we doing about school…?”
“Oh relax, love! It’s nothing like the arcade! I promised I would never do that again, remember?!” Sherlock smiled softly and slipped his hand into John's. He took off again, but this time he was holding onto John, because there was no one around and he liked running with John holding his hand.
John caught up with him a little down the street and they just walked in silence. He didn’t know where they were going, but after a while Sherlock slowly took his hand and continued walking, at least there was hope then. John couldn’t help but smile a bit and squeezed his hand, letting him know that no matter what happened he would be there for him.
“No…” Sherlock said slowly, “But I want to…” He frowned slightly as he turned his head to look at him.
“Sherlock… Maybe John is telling the truth. Why don’t you ask him what happened yesterday…? And while you are at it, give him some space. Come stand over here next to me.” He huffed as Sherlock was practically crawling on John making sure everything was in check.
“If something ever happened to me... if I wasn’t here anymore, would you stay here... on the earth, I mean. Would you keep going – for me?”
“That’s enough to be going on, don’t you think?” He hummed and walked to the door where he opened it and started walking out. He stopped and poked his head back in where he smirked at john, “The names Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street.” He clicked his mouth and winked at John before nodding, “Afternoon!” and with that he left.
“Where are they? What did you do with the letters? Because I know for a fact you were the one who made sure Sherlock wouldn’t be receiving any.” He stopped walking once he got in the middle of the room, he needed some distance between them still.
Sherlock ran up to Zack's door and pounded on it with his fist. He probably gave them a heart attack, but he was panicking and nothing was going to ease his panic until he saw that John was safe! He
Claire took a breath and then sighed, she had no idea how to help John at all, but she would figure it out. She stood up and then went about cleaning up the flat, making sure she didn’t touch any of Sherlock's things. Afterwards, she found a blanket and curled up on the couch, trying to find sleep.
“WHY! What did he do that was so bad that you hate him?” He screamed. He was shaking and he just didn’t understand anything – he actually didn’t understand a lot of things lately and it made him rather angry. It made him feel stupid when he knew he was very far from stupid.
"No, deserve to sit in the hot tub." He nodded some and then laid down and looked up at the ceiling.
John flapped his hands and wiggled a bit, but in the end decided to follow Sherlock. They pushed through the doors and John was overcome with arcade music humming through the air. The place looked very retro and it had arcade games everywhere. It was no doubt a place where unwanted kids came to sort of cool off. There weren’t any staff either so John guessed the kids had found this place and managed to spruce it up. With what money he wasn’t sure, but he wasn’t sure he wanted to figure that out so he left it alone. Sherlock kept walking through the arcade until he came across a photo booth. He snickered at John and knocked three times, “It’s me, Sherlock!” He sung happily and glanced over at John again.
John laughed softly and took his hand, kissing it once, “I actually think I’m the lucky one.” He whispered. It was an insane thought, but maybe Claire would be the one to fix everything between the two of them without even realising it.
The DI was silent for a long while before he finally spoke again, Sherlock suspected it was to calm himself down before he spoke. “Your brother tipped us a few days ago, Sherlock. He killed your father.”
Sherlock took a shaky breath and waited a few minutes before leaving too, but to the roof top of St. Barts.
Sherlock walked through the doors and talked to the receptionist to see where his mother was staying. Once they got done talking he nodded and drug John to the second floor. Sherlock was slightly angry with himself as well, he came here for work all the time and didn’t even know his mother was in the same building, fighting for her life. John swallowed as Sherlock stopped in front of one of the doors; he slowly opened it, and then stepped inside. Sherlock let go of John's hand and made his way towards the bed slowly, he swallowed hard and sat down in a chair next to her bed as he reached out and grabbed her hand. She was sleeping so he didn’t want to wake her just yet. She needed her rest.
She flinched and watched as John walked away. Claire stayed there for a minute looking down at the grave that probably held an empty casket, perhaps it held someone else entirely so they didn’t waste a space in the ground – someone nobody would miss. She sighed at the thought and then just followed John home.
Sherlock blacked out for ten seconds and John was sobbing and holding him in his arms when he finally woke up. John should have been mortified that Sherlock saw him like that, but he wasn’t. And now they were currently in the middle of the living room at Baker Street and John is just screaming at Sherlock.
“I’m sure it will, John.” He forced a smile and then stood up. He grabbed his rucksack and walked out of the door without another word.
“Sir, please! I think you will want this soldier because he kept asking about you and no one even knows who you are! I don’t know how
“So... Last day of school! What are you doing for your summer, John? Shagging Sherlock?” A player by the name of Alex smirked, the day John was able to come back to school he told the players everything that happened between Sherlock and him. They were super understanding and accepting of it and even though John and Sherlock weren’t on speaking terms, John still wanted to tell his friends.
"I don't even understand why you're doing this!! He's breaking, Sherlock! He tried to kill himself three months ago! I fear he'll try again soon and what if I'm not around..? What if I don't make it in time! I would come over to check on him only to stumble upon his dead body! Not to mention he would have died for nothing!" She growled out.
John was currently under the covers, with just his face poking out. He was staring at the wall and trying to find sleep, but every time he closed his eyes he thought of Sherlock and it hurt so much... So he just opted to keep them opened.
Sherlock melts and kisses him back with everything he has. There's still hope and he isn’t about to let it go just yet.
“Cliché..?” He blinked some more and looked around slightly, making sure no cars were coming. Why in the world John would pull them into the street was beyond him.
Sherlock glared right back at him and stood up, “excuse you?? You left me, remember?? I don’t think you have any right getting upset over the fact that I have a new boyfriend now.”
Sherlock looked down and nodded. “Yes, I know…” He whispered, he honestly didn’t know, but with how his father always treated him… well, he had his suspicions.
A month after his mother passed the texts started to say where Sherlock was and what he was doing. That he couldn't hide from the man who was harassing him and that they would find him no matter where Sherlock decided to go or hide. Sherlock never replied and he never told John, but that just made the mysterious sender angry. Why would the sender want him to tell John anyway? He understood not replying – of course the stalker wanted a reaction, but Sherlock wasn’t about to give him one.
John smiled sadly and nodded, “Yeah, you always are, aren’t you?” He sighed and just snuggled up against him instead, he knew what Sherlock was doing – why he was doing it and wasn’t offended at all, he understood.
Sherlock took a breath and looked at John with narrowed eyes, “you’re being ridiculous.” He said slowly.
“Please! Just tell me he’s here and I’ll go! I need to know if he’s safe... If he’s okay!” Sherlock was on the verge of tears. He didn’t know why, but he was so scared and they were threatening to come up. John was most likely fine, he was just overreacting.
“I’ve already forgiven you…. Because I love you, but that doesn’t mean I’m not mad…” He whispered. “Come here…”
The man blinked and had no idea how the man in front of him knew he hurt his shoulder. He was probably subconsciously grabbing it or something. “It’s fine.. Really.” The man stood up and stood there awkwardly.
Thankfully the ride wasn’t a long one and soon the car was stopping. John opened his eyes and handed the cabbie a couple of pounds. He got out of the car and walked through the headstones until he found the onyx black one with golden lettering. Slowly, he sat down on the grass and stared at the headstone for a long time, looking over the lettering and letting the unbelievable sadness he felt wash over him. Usually he tamped it down, or drowned it out with alcohol, but today he let himself feel. Eventually, he reached out and traced his fingers over Sherlock's name – something he hadn’t ever been able to bring himself to do before. Something so simple… he was just touching lettering on a slab of stone, but it meant so much to him. He took a sharp breath as the tears prickled his eyes.
Greg reached out and snagged Mycroft’s hand, giving it a squeeze. He knew his boyfriend was just as moved as he was, even if Mycroft didn’t show it.
“Well… he still went to prison, but for the burglary on the other side of town rather than murder. He didn’t even know the guy. I have no idea how New Scotland Yard made such an elaborate leap. Just because he was ‘in the area’. They wouldn’t know-”
When he got it, he opened the door and stepped into the room, pushing those thoughts away, he was subconsciously underestimating his sub. It wasn’t something he did anymore, mainly because the brat could outsmart him at every turn. He didn’t often knock when he entered rooms in his own house, but the lab was a private space for Sherlock and he often did weird and dangerous stuff inside. He didn’t want to risk that ending up all over the place.
"Get in the bath and get cleaned up, then we'll both put on clean clothes." Sherlock poured some bubble bath under the running water. "I promise you, everyone here had an accident like that at some point growing up."
There was no response, but rather than get angry, he moved his toe slightly, lifting Sherlock’s head up and making the younger man groan in annoyance.
John laughed silently to himself, the boy was so like Sherlock, it was as if the pair was actually blood related.
The Dom took a deep breath but didn’t release his hold over the boy, he knew his game. Safe wording would end everything, it would cancel the contract instantly and they both knew that. It was the moment of truth. “Well?”
And, like all those years ago, she ran it along his jawline and over his cheek. "I can't wait to show you how this should really be used, but first-" Irene slapped him hard across his right cheek then again across his left. "Mm, yes. Those cheeks were made to be slapped."
The boy ducked his head, but John pulled him upright. “You look at me, boy. You don’t look away. You don’t hide.”
“Are you sure? Only these past few days, although they haven’t been easy, they have been getting better, why did you suddenly run this morning?”
Throwing all caution to the wind, the doctor let his stick lean against the wall and he wrapped his arms around the younger man. “That was fantastic.”
“Yes, sir.” Just be good. Just be good. Be good and he’ll leave. Unless… maybe John had got bored of him like everyone else… maybe instead of sending him back to Mycroft, John was going to pass him over like a loaf of bread. It was well within his rights. There was nothing Sherlock could do, seeing that the only phone he had access to was the one for emergencies in the kitchen drawer. His Dom had said earlier that he’d contacted him because he wanted advice on a business like John’s. Maybe Sherlock would be his first client? He took another involuntary step backwards. John tightened the grip on his leash, forcing the younger man to take a step forward, putting him back where he had just been.
