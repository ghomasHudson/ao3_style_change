Steve didn’t answer his question. Instead, he stood up from the beach chair. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small blue box no bigger than a half dollar coin. Blue package clutched firmly in his hand, Steve knelt down on one knee.
"I know, but really? This couldn't wait until tomorrow?” Or the day after? Any time other than this would have been much better than right now, just as he was about to deliver something very illegal.
“Fumbling like a drunken fool. And then you have to nerve to barricade yourself into your lab, leaving me and Obie to deal with the falling out.”
Tony was baffled. He didn’t want to spend time talking with Carol, Natasha, or Jan. He wanted to spend time with Tony. Out of all the pretty girls offering their company, out of all the activities they offered from gambling to board games, this man wanted to spend time learning how to make donuts with Tony? “You sure you don’t want me to call over one of the girls to-”
Steve jumped, but it wasn’t out of fear. He covered his face with his hands as his pale cheeks immediately turned scarlet red.
“Okay,” Tony said, more than a little shaken by how close his fingers had gotten to being someone’s dinner. “So you are hungry.”
Bruce glared at him. “And a twelve percent chance that he’s not,” he said, pulling on the string a little harder than necessary.
When the echo finally faded, Tony looked up. The wolf was gone and in his place was one of the most beautiful men Tony had ever seen. Sharp blue eyes peeked out from beneath an unkempt mop of blond hair. Pale skin glistened in the morning mildew. His body was thin from malnutrition, but Tony could see the strong muscle hidden underneath taut skin. He most definitely did not take advantage of the man’s nakedness to sneak a peek at the family jewels because “Wow,” was the only thing Tony could say as the man bathed in the morning sunlight for the first time in years.
Tony understood that. Understood why she had to leave. Why they couldn’t be together anymore. It didn't stop the hurt though. Didn’t stop the guilt when he caught himself looking at someone else. Most likely, it would never stop, just fade to hurt less. “Couldn’t leave even if you wanted,” he said, with a pained smile. “I sign your checks.”
Now, I can finally see Age of Ultron! I'm so excited! As always, thank you kuailong for the beta! 25k! Woot! Never thought I'D make it this far.
“Enjoy the whiskey, Steve,” whispered Tony as he watched the rich, warm spirit disappear into the ground. “Can’t go buying you flowers, so I got you the good stuff. Hope you appreciate it, you uncultured swine.”
“Did I mention that I was making presents for everyone and that you’re in charge of everything I don't want until I get back?"
It’s late when Tony Stark snuck out of the ship’s sleeping quarters and out onto the deck. The Avengers had set anchor for the night. They had searched long and hard, but even heroes need their rest.
He tried to play it off cool. This wasn’t his first rodeo. He could control how he acted around others. But what do you said to a metal monster challenging your right to love a man, Italian or not. “I don’t see how that’s any of your business,” Steve said, more flippantly than normal.
Steve snorted at the impossible possibility. “Wouldn’t that be nice.” Steve knew Sam was trying to make him feel better, but on a day like today, it just made him feel worse. There were moments when he felt so close and moments where it felt like there was an ocean between them instead of a couple dozen blocks of concrete.
Tony was ready to give up and just let the guy have at it until the cows comes home when a large mass streaked overhead, knocking Tony’s assaulter to the ground. Tony barely caught himself from falling at an odd angle with his injured arm. The lightning bolt of pain surging up his body sure didn’t make the catch worth the effort. Face twisted, his mouth dropped open in silent agony.
As the doors secured around them and the metal box descended, Tony switched over to work mode. No more fake smiles. No more hidden agenda. A stright back, squred shoulders, and cold heart at the ready. The plans swarming around in his head flipped over, and he began doing a quick mental check of all the components necessary for their transofrmation. “Pepper? What’s the status on the suit?”
“I’ll take care of that,” assured Steve. “Just get those two punks out before they mess up somebody’s face.”
Natasha’s face softened. “I’m sorry,” she said quietly, placing a warm hand on top of his. He squeezed it for strength and she rubbed a comforting thumb across the back of his hand. “It’ll get better. You’ll see.”
“Why can’t you listen to white jazz like other people your age? Like Jack Tegarden, Bix Biederbecke, or even the Original Dixieland Jazz Band?”
“Ms. Johnson, is this man giving you problems?” A ginger dame equipped with heels that could kill sauntered up behind them.
Steve let out a sigh in annoyance. Ethics and personal feelings aside, they needed the money. Both Steve and Bucky had exhausted all other resources in trying to find alternate buyers with no luck. Besides, with Hydra already stirring up a ruckus practically every day, not caring if they hit lowlifes or civilians, they might as well go all in. Wasn’t like their situation could get that much worse.
“I’m not harassing,” Stane looked very offended. “I’m just asking about the future. Once she gets married, she’s not going to stick around much longer.”
Tony tumbled out of the wolf’s embrace like an uncoordinated puppy. He whirled around, expecting Steve to look hurt or at least offended at Tony’s departure. Instead, Steve was shaking like a scared deer. He whimpered and pawed furiously at his face as if trying to claw something off his muzzle. His back paws dug into the ground like he was trying to dig his feet into something he couldn’t quite get a hold of.
“Me? No,” the man brushed off the comment like it was nothing. “Parents were Italian and Spanish. Hence the soft leather skin,” he said with a mischievous eyebrow waggle that made Steve want to laugh. “You’ll get none of that religious bigotry from me.”
“What?” he tried to remember what Stane could be talking about. “The helping hand?” It was hard to believe the investors would give that piece of scrap metal the time of day. It was just a theory that had been forced to the back burner because of everything else, but Tony had every intention of finishing it; provided biologists and engineers could get their heads out of their asses long enough to provide him with solid research.
A high pitched whirl developed into a scream as Schmidt drew the arm up to eye level and fired a burning white blast of energy into the warehouse. A resounding
Steve was sitting on a stool across the dressing room door. A soft smile spread across his face as Tony strutted down an invisible runway. “I think it looks good on you,” he said. Because, of course, Steve loved everything the kid did.
They stood in silence as Steve tried to catch his breath. Tony had stopped pulling in objection. “Job didn’t come through?”
The implication slowly sunk into his bones like the cold of winter. Starvation, human trafficking, suicide brought on by hopelessness. The possibilities of what could happen hit a little too close to home.
“Oh.” Steve looked down to try and hide his embarrassment. Even Steve would not deny that he heard disappointment in his voice.
“But I wanted to see the guys shit their pants when we came home with wedding bands.” Steve looked at Tony and stuck out his bottom lip in the most over the top sad puppy look Steve could muster. “Can’t we just get a little married before we go back to work?”
“God, it must be so nice to be you,” said Tony to Steve as the wolf trotted over, pacing around the man in a lazy circle. “Gold fur, blue eyes, strong lycan muscles for days, you must look like a god when you’re human.”
Steve let out an excited yip and began running around the enclosure like a puppy who just got a new toy.
Steve didn’t bother to lift his head when he heard the familiar whine of energy. The bright definition of white light against Steve’s dark shadow told him more than enough. He was dead. A single blast from Iron Man’s hand would end him. If he was lucky, Bucky might be able to retrieve some of his ashes after the battle.
I plan on posting the rest of "Chapter 9" by (the latest) first weekend of October. Have a good weekend kiddies!
If worst came to worst, he should set up a soup kitchen like Capone did in Chicago. That was an option. Then his people wouldn’t go hungry. `Maybe Steve could help,’ he thought, the blissful idea tugging a sad smile to one side of his face.
“You sure that’s not yours?” he asked, eyeing Steve’s bloody fingers and purpling knuckles. He tried to lift the sides of his lips at the cruel joke, but his body seemed to be set on ignoring him.
Tony cursed. Steve was either being stubborn or his com was still broken. Tony prayed it was the former. “Forget it Steve. You need to get out of there, now! You don’t know what that thing will do.”
Carol gave Tony a wink. “Thanks for the easy money.” Together she and Steve’s friend pulled down the awning and covered the windows of the truck.
“As do I. Watch over him, friend. Should anything happen to Barnes, you shall be the first to know.”
Steve’s stomach dropped. Cops don’t take out lights. Cops were stupid and marched in single fine like cattle. If these people were smart enough to take out the lights so people wouldn’t be able to see, if it wasn’t the cops, who in the hell could it be?
Tony’s mouth opened and closed like a fish for a few seconds. “I lied,” he finally said. “There’s nothing to see.”
“You know you can’t have it, right? It’s full of stuff that’s not good for you; chemicals, preserves, salt, grease. The only reason I’m eating it is because I’m okay with that kind of stuff in my body.”
It was a damn miracle that nobody got hurt bad in the scuffles. Couple of them still carried cuts, gun grazes, and bruises, but that was nothing compared to the througheral throttling Steve had given to a group of four that decided (on a whim funny enough) to come at him that morning. Steve’s crowd looked good all things considering, but if fingers were a bit more twitchy and eyes a bit more shifty than normal, Steve tried to pay it no mind. They had a job to do and he couldn’t allow personal feelings to get in the way.
What the hell? He was Tony fucking Stark! He was the one who made the first move in a relationship. Smooth lines, flirty suggestions, a kiss on the lips after a first date of wining and dinning always got him the girl. But here was Steve who plowed through all Tony’s expectations, destroyed his carefully crafted plan to come back to all this later, and kissed him like it was the best date ever and one of them wasn’t bleeding out on the street. Damn it! Steve wasn’t supposed to move this quickly.
Tony let out a long sigh and shoved his hands deep into his pockets. He turned his back to the dead and started the long, quiet trip back to civilization. But just as Tony was about to leave, he noticed a woman with vibrant red hair on the other side of the cemetery gate.
“But you know what I mean,” replied Obie with a smile. “Relax. Read a book. Take a walk.” Stane took a whiff of Tony’s hair and made a face. “Maybe take a shower too. When was the last time you took care of yourself?”
Rhodey hacked out a cough through a drained laugh. “Hold you to it Tones,” he said, voice slurred with exhaustion.
“Why don’t you join the others on the dance floor?” suggested Tony. “Be a lot more fun than standing by a boring truck waiting on little old me.”
In the dark corners of Tony’s mind, he thought one day it would all end. Steve would wake up from their ‘honeymoon period’ and know he deserved someone better. He’d call Tony a selfish, vain asshole or something like that and leave him to marry some blond haired, blue eyed girl to raise two and a half kids in a house in the suburbs with a white picket fence. To hear such praise from Steve’s own lips, to hear how much Steve loved him, it didn’t feed his ego like all the gossip magazines thought it did. It made his heart grow two sizes bigger. It made his chest feel like it was about to explode. It felt like time stopped. It felt like he was going to die all over again.
Steve laughed. “Guess I’ll have to work harder to be more important. And I think I have an idea as to how,” Steve said as he traced his fingers along Tony’s scarred flesh.
“You want to grow up and marry Captain America, right? You gotta impress him,” said Bucky, placing his metal arm around Tony’s shoulders. “Eat your damn fruit.”
“Let me do this, please? You’re the one that got injured, Steve. Let me be the one to clean you up.”
“What? It’s true.” True except the name. The Engineer did get hit with a Stark shrapnel bomb (military grade. It was supposed to be in the testing stages), landing Tony with a chest full of metal. By all accounts, he should have died, heck he almost did. But Yinsen and Bruce, god bless Bruce Banner, did enough of a patch job that Tony recovered enough to finish the job himself.
Steve tried hard not to blush. “And as I said before those multiple times you offered to pay for our calls, it’s fine. I can pay my own way.” It was always sweet when Tony offered, but Steve felt the need to pay his own whenever he could. Tony may claim to have deep pockets, but Steve still had his pride.
"No! No. You're fine. Just caught us at a bad time," Steve said, motioning for Sam to put the gun away. Sam gave him a confused look, but did as he was ordered. "How did you find us?"
“Hey,” Sam grabbed Steve’s arm. “I know you’re worried about Bucky. We all are. But don’t let yourself get too carried away. Killing won’t help anyone.”
“I’ve got all these ideas running around in my head, but technology is not far enough along to accommodate me, and my hands aren’t nearly fast enough to accurately write down everything that goes on up there. Do you even understand what that’s like Obie? To want to create something only to realize you don’t have the tech to go from point A to point B? It’s aggravating! I have all the resources I could ever what, unlimited funding, but no matter what I try, I don’t have what I need to get this thing up to 500 horsepower without burning out!” he emphasized throwing a wrench against the wall.
“Just confuse them enough to buy me some more time. I don’t want their expectations too high when I actually knock their socks off with my genius,” Tony said, heading for the door.
Steve shivered at the image. The longer his imagination dwelt on the possibilities, the worse it got for Tony. What if Iron Man wasn’t so merciful? What he if did more than torture? Steve could go back for him right now. Rescue him like a knight in shining armour.
“It’s a job,” she said, seeming tired of the debate. “It’s a recon job and it pays. I just did a little extra research to see if we can’t take some of the goods. We can, so here we are.”
With a request for giggle juice, it was possible that they were supposed to meet were in a completely different room.  Considering that there was a dark painted door at the back of the shop hidden in the shadows, Steve bet his hunch was correct. With a leader’s confidence, he went over and nudged the smooth surface, expecting the door to be locked. Surprisingly, the door opened without as much as a squeak to a larger than life speakeasy.
"Of all days to have a gun, I didn't expect to use it this way," remarked Sam, pulling out his firearm. He flinched as the second volley cut the air and the rain of bullets resumed.
Steve pulled back the top of the box and revealed a simple gold band. “Anthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?”
“So? What’s the big deal?” His normal snappish attitude was heavily clouded in the dozy haze of waking up. Tony rolled his head so it faced the floor. He dragged a lazy finger against the grain of floor. Were there always so many small stones embedded into the cement? “Steve found out,” he murmured, not bothering to look up.
Stane shook his head. “Sometimes I can’t tell if you’re really a genius or just fucking with us,” he muttered. “But it’ll work for the meeting. I’ll do what I can to keep them off our backs.”
Tony didn’t move. Steve could almost see the ‘processing’ bar above his head. Tony peeked out from between his arms and looked at Steve. There was a bit of hesitation in Tony’s eyes, but as soon as Steve spotted it, Tony buried his head back down between his arms and shook his head.
Finally, a light at the end of the ever darkening tunnel. “And you have no idea how grateful I am for that.”
Tony jumped out of his hiding spot and into Steve’s arms. Tony wrapped his small arms around Steve’s neck latching on like a leech. “I didn’t mean to,” he cried into Steve’s shoulder. His entire body was shaking. “I know I’m a big boy and I’m supposed to sleep all by myself, but I forgot. Everything’s so different and scary. First there were those guys in yellow hazmat suits. And they kept poking and prodding me and asking me questions. And I was so scared. And I didn’t know what to do. And then you came. And I… I… Please don’t let him hurt me.”
Tony was silent a few more minutes as he watched Steve turn out two more perfectly golden pancakes. “Steve, can a man be a wife?” Tony asked as Steve poured the last of the batter into the pan.
“Tony,” Rhodey put a stop on their tangent discussion. “I’m just worried about you. We all are. About a lot of things: Stark Industries, the Iron Family, but this is different, and new, and…” his eye darted back and forth searching for the correct words. Probably something that didn't sound like fag or fairy. “Are you sure he can accept you? All of you?” he asked quietly.
“No, Tony. A man can be a husband, but he can’t be a wife,” Steve said, absentmindedly as he began washing the now empty bowl.
With a tired sigh, Tony caved. “We are talking about this later, right? This whole misunderstanding thing going on between us,” Tony said, motioning between their chests only inches apart.
Steve took a second to emotionally prepare himself before putting his hands back under the water. Goosebumps ran up the back of his arms. He let the water cascade down and around his fingers. The cold felt good on his hands. The brusque chill helped ground his thoughts. Helped him not think about the ‘what if’s and ‘should have done’.
Sam’s hands stilled. The tap squeaked as he turned off the water. He was waited for Steve to say something else or claim it was all just a joke. But Sam knew Steve like he knew the back of his hand. He knew Steve wasn’t joking about this.
“Yes please!” Tony’s face lit up as he pulled up a seat. “Talk deli to me Pep. What local New York specials are we getting today?”
Ms. Potts rubbed her forehead with a free hand. “I can’t believe he didn’t tell you,” she said in a tired tone. “No, scratch that. I actually can.”
There, perfectly frozen in time, was the legendary Captain America. Bright red boots were tangled in a military green parachute. The red, white, and blue of his uniform had faded over time, but the fabric looked as strong and as sturdy as the day it came off the line. The white star that stretched across the width of his broad, beautiful chest sparkled in the early morning moonlight. His lips and skin were as pale and as perfect as freshly fallen snow, while his golden hair haloed around head making him look like an angel descending down from heaven.
Happy shrugged. “You do have a history of making very bad choices when left to your own devices. And we do have a very recent hit to be concerned about."
Steve was still a little hesitant, but with Tony’s guidance Steve started getting the hang of it. Obliviously, he was less practiced than Tony. His hand placement was wrong and his movements were very slow and too deliberate. However, the level of focus and the look of concentration on Steve’s face made Tony wish Steve was a Donut Doll and not another soldier. The way Steve worked with dough was strangely erotic. The more Tony thought about it, the more he realized it wouldn’t be too hard to fill an entire book with with endless passages describing how Steve looked in that moment.
“Tony!” A familiar hand, that definitely didn’t belong to Steve, clasped his shoulders. “It’s been an age my boy. How’ve you been?”
Tony sighed. “I’m not asking you to trust me ‘just because.’ I just… can you please try and eat? Just a little? You’re so beautiful. I don’t want you dying on me.”
“I see you back there,” sneered Rumlow, swinging the glowing gauntlet in front of his face. “Why don’t you come out and play with ol’ Crossbones?”
Tony thought about the Hydra filth bleeding out in the back of Clint’s car. He thought about how sweet it would be to hear the man’s tortured screams in a few short hours. He thought about the man, begging for his life when face with Iron Man’s ‘special’ interrogation. Tony wouldn’t do give it, but he’d relish in the man’s pain until he breathed his last breath.
“How can I calm down after that what just happened?” Steve yelled, thrashing around in an attempt to get out of the mess. “He betrayed me. He betrayed us! And now I bet ya’ he’s laughing all the way to the bank for making me look like a fool.”
Eventually, Tony’s patience ran low and time ran out. He recalled the car and tossed the uneaten rabbit on the pile of meat from that morning.
Everyone else was smiling in celebration. Bucky was busy admiring the scope of a beautiful rifle, testing out the balance and recoil with empty rounds. Meanwhile, Thor and Sam worked at popping open the lids like they were boxes of cracker jacks. Natasha, as was par for the course in her line of work, was nowhere to be seen.
Tony turned his head and his heart skipped a beat. There he was, right behind him. Captain Steve Rogers of the Howling Commandos was looking at him with eyes so big and blue Tony felt like he could drown in them. Steve bit down on his lip. His pump, pink lips were so close and so tantalizing that Tony could barely suppress the growing need in his stomach to tilt his head and kiss those perfect lips.
Steve poked his head out from behind their wall of wooden crates, looking for anyone making nightly rounds. “No,” he whispered. “But of all the places you could have picked, you pick the one that looks like it get the most foot traffic and the most likely place for people to notice stuff going missing.”
Morgan nodded. She reached into her bag and brought a black box absolutely covered in stickers and glitter glue. “I decorated it myself. What do you think?”
“Then why give us the info at all?” asked Iron Man, crossing his arms across the glow of the reactor. “Information brokers like you usually want something in return. Why tell us for free when we could knock each other off in revenge?”
Steve glanced at his hands curled up in his lap. Black and red scabs decorated the back of his knuckles. Ruby red blood stained his fingernails and dotted the palm of his hand. It should hurt, but for some reason, every nerve in his body felt numb. His entire brain felt like mush. It was as if he was a stranger in his own body.
Clint snorted and spun to a stop. “Get him? He's richer than God, anything he wants he probably already owns a dozen of.”
“They’re just animals, like a flying horse. My friend worked in the stables and he said they had to corral and muzzle the beasts to get them to behave.”
“We’re having a moment,” Tony said at the same time. Steve glared at him and Tony shrugged. “What, I can’t multitask?”
Tony was in shock. Was he really talking to a dragon? Not only a dragon, but the Captain’s dragon, the dragon who saved the keep and won the war?
Hammer pumped a fist into the air in a cheer. “I’ve been promoted! Please, hold your applause, you wouldn’t want to give away your position, would you? I’ll be running the games from here on out, and I’ll make sure it’s a show for the ages. Good night, and may the odds be ever in your favor!”
Clint patted him on the back consolingly. “So have you recovered? Do you think you're up to get back in there and give it another go? I promise I'll protect you if it looks like Tony's about to say something nice.”
“I caught him swinging around Queens in a old hoodie with no combat training and took him on as a intern.”
“Just for the record, I love you too.” Tony whispered hesitantly, shy as a deer, and Steve felt warm from head to toe.
“We have bonded. Heart to heart-” The tip of her tail tapped the center of Tony’s chest where the reactor was set, then Liberty’s own chest where the battery glowed an identical shade of blue. “And soul to soul…” Her tail flicked outward to where Steve was standing, petting the head of a green dragon. “Splintered parts of one whole.”
Steve blinked up at him. “Are you real? I saw them drag you away yesterday, and no one comes back once they take you.” He giggled and started singing. “Play the wrong game, back the wrong horse, it’s all the same, they take you away, didn’t say goodbye but I got nothing left to say, it's time for the bad kids to go away.”
“It looked painful last time.” Steve continued, his concerns not assured. He never wanted to hear those horrible noises Tony had been making again. Better for them to talk it through now, awkward as it was, then have Tony get stuck halfway and leave Steve having no idea what to do later. “Is there any way I could help?”
He started gathering up the parts he needed, the robot dog, the engine of an rc car, a computer, and on a whim he took the hand from a mechanical claw game. Soon his arms were overflowing and Steve had to tell him to slow down.
Steve put his coat on and shoved his hands in his pockets. They walked outside, where it had started to snow lightly. Steve kept his head down. “She must be a special lady.”
What in the world could he say to convince Tony to leave his perfect world and return to real one, where his family was all dead and his heart was filled with metal? Should he even convince Tony to return? He was happy here, Bruce could probably hook his body up to some sort of machine and keep Tony here, happy, safe, and content for the rest of his life. The life of a superhero wasn’t an easy one. Steve had seen the bruises darkening against Tony’s skin where the suit dented after every mission. He watched Tony stretch to reach the top shelf of a cabinet and hunch over with a wince, clutching his chest where the metal ring of a missile casing rubbed against rough sawn ribs and scarred skin. He had caught Tony staring out the window at 2 am, dark circles under his eyes and a cup of scotch in his hand.
He shook his head. “I don't know. They most likely believe me to be dead. Maybe have gone scouting and failed to return, as Bucky did. They warned me it was foolish before I set out.”
He posted it and hopped off the ride, offering Steve a hand down. “My image is that I’m a dumbass. The world is already aware. Let’s go get some snacks.”
Steve nodded and stroked his dragon’s head one more time, promising that he would be back. He pressed a kiss to her scaled head and used the boulders to push himself to his feet. Tony wrapped an arm around his back, and they started the trip back. Tony felt an aching sadness as they left the dragon, and did his best to shake it off. It was a beautiful creature and he was sad whenever an animal got hurt, but it shouldn't have been affecting him that much. Maybe he was picking up the general mood from Steve who was clearly devastated to be leaving his dragon alone and injured.
Tony wished he had enough energy to tell Steve that he was helping, just by being there. It felt good not to be alone, to feel someone else’s warmth and comforting touch.
“I had a cousin who raised sheep, there was a dragon that preyed on them so he set a trap. The next day the sheep were gone and the trap was taken down and all the parts stacked in a pile at his done.”
Tony was unaware that he had done a guide for Brooklyn. The situation around his travel books was...complicated.
Steve patted his hand. “It’s ok, I asked you to play along at being in love, and you did great. We got what we needed, didn’t we?” he said, moving away. Tony grabbed his arm.
Once Clint brushed the last of the nuts from his hair, they got in the truck and Steve started driving towards the venue. Bucky still hadn’t returned, and they were hoping he would meet them there in time for the ceremony.
The comms were quiet for a second, then Tony caved, because he could fight you on anything until the ends of the earth, but was a complete sucker for a please and thank you.
“How much time will it take?” Tony asked, worried that someone would come looking for the missing peacekeeper lying in the hallway.
Steve shook Tony off and went outside to inspect the plane. The fuel gauge read half a tank. Steve bet he could get it off the ground, and flying would be much faster and safer than walking. He settled himself in the pilot's seat and started flicking switches. The engine started warming up with a quiet rumble. Tony still stood in the doorway of the kitchen, arm’s crossed.
But the day had stopped resetting and all of the commandos had died in the line of duty, following Steve’s orders.
“You’re the one who messed it up! Withholding medicine and technology, hiding the truth so you could better control us. The only thing your stupid Hunger Games have proved is that the districts don’t need the Capitol. It deserves to burn!”
“I’m sorry Mr. Rogers, I’m afraid there must have been a misunderstanding. You’re still about fifteen thousand short, on the house loan alone.”
Steve peered over at Tony. He seemed pretty content to just stand here with him and pet Dottie. Maybe he was having fun taking some time to slow down, to enjoy the simple life on the ranch.
Steve let Tony pull him closer, let him rest his head against his shoulder, shifting his grip from his wrist to holding his hand.
He put the torch down and walked over to one of the many holograms lighting the room in a soft blue glow. Jarvis pulled up several grainy camera feeds.
Steve looked up at the muddy grey sky. “Looks like rain, so we’ll do something indoors. How about the Brooklyn Historical Society?”
“Apparently. Is there anything you two used to like to do together, that you could hang out and ease yourselves back into it?”
“Alright you glorified turkey, now you’ve pissed me off.” He raised his arms and tried to fire his repulsors. One shot out a weak pulse that pittered out before it hit the bird, and the other remained dark. Jarvis was never going to let him live this down.
That had to be a joke, right? That was nothing like how a reaping was supposed to go, it was supposed to be a great honor to be picked.
“You’re lucky you did. I don’t want to think what would Stane would have done to you if you didn’t.”
He did his best to keep up as the group traveled through the forest, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other and not falling over any tree roots. Steve lead the way, while Clint watched for other tributes and Natasha stood guard in the back. They searched along the river first, since that had been the only place safe from the smoke and flames. After an hour of looking, they came up empty, and decided to go back to where they had been separated, and search outwards from there. It meant that they had to go all the way back the way they came. Tony wanted to cry. He should have stayed in his cave.
“Two hours?” Tony asked in shock. “Before they’re here? Don’t they need to prepare? Convince people?”
“Cherry, Watermelon, Blue Raspberry or Grape? Any ring you want, nothing is too extravagant for my very own ray of sunshine.”
Steve grinned. “I am healed through your tender care. My thanks. I will have to find a way to repay you.”
Steve half heartedly kicked Clint from where he was sitting. “Leave Tony alone. He’s been very helpful with a lot of things.”
“It's your birthday this week right? Well, happy birthday. There's your gift, and if you want we could go get lunch or something.”
“Someone in the crowd? You can’t trust random videos, they’re fake. You can make up anything you want with computers anymore. You remember the movie we saw last weekend? You really think they found an octopus the size of a house and had him eat the actors? No. It’s not real.”
Steve took the bait, more than eager to talk about her. “She is, isn’t she. From the first second in her presence you can tell she is strong of body and kind of heart. She saved my life more times than I can count. Her name is Liberty.”
Steve took a moment to consider that. “You don’t get a choice? I figured that the people in the Capital did whatever they wanted, and it was the Districts who had to be careful of the rules.”
Tony sighed. He was happy? Or maybe it was relief he was feeling? Bruce would get to go home, and that felt good, that felt right. Out of the group, Bruce had been the least of a fighter, the most out of place as he made his little fires while everyone else practiced with weapons. Tony had noticed it from his first question in the first interview; Bruce didn’t belong in this place.
From his vantage point flying above, Tony watched Cap walk closer and assess the situation. Tony was closer than Steve had ordered, but he was lucky Tony was listening at all.
Steve’s fingers curled back and he tried to draw back his hand. Tony held on, his thumb rubbing gently across the pulse in his wrist. It grounded him.
“Wow! Would you look at that! $21 grand! I must have gotten confused. Oh well, silly me! Now there is absolutely nothing stopping you from finally closing this account.”
They went and got caramel corn and sat down on a bench to watch the water. The waves lapped in and out, and in the background they could still hear the carousel playing cheerful music. The sun had started to set and the air cooled to a pleasant temperature. Tony couldn't remember the last time he felt so content.
Steve had no idea what was going on. Knowing Clint, probably trouble. He tried to go outside to see what Clint was doing, and was stopped by Jan’s steel like grip on his arm.
He didn’t know what this was, this thing where he felt stripped bare, and the whole world narrowed down to the two of them, and the thin line of connection tied between them.
“What the hell?” he whispered to himself. He fisted his hand in his hair and leaned forward, staring blankly at the floor.
“And you really needed to come ask me this now?” Steve asked, a little put out. He had to be up by 5 tomorrow, for god’s sake. Through his sleep muddled haze Steve was trying to connect the dots of what exactly was going on. Before he could figure anything out, Tony was already up, leaving, making excuses.
“Yet here you sit. You were out, for a brief hour. I had no clue where you were and no way to find out. You could have stayed that way, could have gone to one of the districts and lived out the rest of your life in anonymity. But then again, you were always the sentimental sort, never able to let things go... I saw you found your little friends. ”
He glowered and handed over the parts. Tony immediately set to work repairing the engine, his hands moving with complete confidence. He reinstalled the compression tube, tightened a few other lose bolts, and hopped around the front and started the truck, first try. Steve was impressed despite himself. The pickup hadn’t started first try in years, not since Clint tried to run it off vegetable oil instead of gasoline. Tony really had a way with machines.
“Oh, shut up.” He said with a blush. He should be used to Jan's teasing by now, but anything involving Tony seemed to make him red as a tomato. Jan was loving getting a rise out of him.
What would it have been like to go home alone? To wake up alone in bed shaking from another nightmare, to call himself crazy and broken to keep up the odd habits that had saved his life in the arena and didn't make sense now that he was home. To spend his days missing the friends that had fallen. Whenever he thought about it he had to go find Steve and reassure himself that they were both alive, they were both ok.
His fingers hovered over the keyboard. He typed the best description of it that he could, and hit enter.
“Wonderfully addicting, isn’t it? I’d much rather watch a nice show about love than all this savagery. Sure, we all know that the people of the outer districts will tear each other apart at the slightest chance, but do we really need to see it? So I have no idea what this job is all about, but when the President himself asks, you don’t refuse! If he thinks I’m the right man for the job then I’m going to do it to the best of my ability, and have some fun along the way.”
“Artillery it is,” he thought to himself, as he fired a shoulder rocket at the bird. The missile flew right through like it was smoke. Which made sense, because according to all of his scans, the bird was made of smoke. The claws that grabbed him, however, were very solid. He was thrown against the ground again and again, and the bird grabbed him so tightly he could hear metal bending with a screech. That wasn't good.
Tony pawed around the ground until his fingers found a thick branch. He used it to lever himself to his feet. Now alone and weaponless, it would be too dangerous to spend time out in the open. He needed to find a new cave or a thick bush where he could hide. He stumbled forward, picking a direction at random. He tried to be as quiet as he could, his feet shuffling through the ash as he walked, his bare foot stinging as he stepped on the uneven ground, and his head pounding in time with his steps. After a half hour he started to clear the burned area, the soot on the ground turning to fallen leaves and the air becoming fresher. He felt more sheltered under the canopy of the trees. He leaned against a tree to rest and catch his breath. In the distance, he could hear the burble of a stream, and he was reminded of how dry his mouth was. He had lost his water bottle along with his backpack, so he was parched. Was it safe to drink water directly from the stream? He didn’t have much of a choice. He set off in the direction of the sound, and after a few minutes of painful limping he broke through the trees and found the stream. It was much narrower and more shallow here than when it passed his little cave, the water being maybe knee high, and he wondered if he would be able to find his safe spot again if he followed it upstream.
Steve was frozen in shock, his eyes locked onto the bleeding form of his brother. Stane took advantage of his distraction and pinned him to the ground with one enormous hand/paw hybrid. Steve struggled against his hold and Stane leaned in, breathing wet and metallic in Steve’s face, rivulets of blood and drool running down his muzzle. “You have beautiful fur. I might kill you quick, then keep you as a rug. I’d mount your head in my office next to Tony’s.”
Tony opened his eyes and blinked up at Steve. Steve kissed him then pulled him into a hug. From over Steve’s shoulder Tony saw that the room was filling with people. The Dragon Guard, the rebels from the mining camp. They all parted to let the other man from the prison pass. He had washed off his face and pulled his long hair back into a low ponytail, for the first time in months he was once again recognizable as Thor Odinson, the rightful king. Tony and Steve struggled to their feet and started to bow. Thor held out a hand and stopped them, instead pulling both of them into a bear hug.
Steve let out a roar of incoherent rage. He ripped off his shirt and dropped down and shifted to his wolf form, his skin erupting with white fur as his jaw lengthened. He wiggled out of his pants, the whole process from man to wolf taking less than three seconds. He lunged forward, lashing out. Tony jumped out of the way, and Steve paced, waiting to see what he would do.
Steve dropped it. If he could trust Tony with his heart a second time, and trust him to help piece together Bucky’s shattered mind, and to whip the accords into something reasonable, he could trust Tony to feed himself. Tony gave his leg a few pats under the table.
“The hazing is later, and it’s going to be a whole lot worse than this.” Tony paused what he was doing and blinked at him.
“Let’s start over. As long as we are not touching, all he will get are impressions of how I am feeling. What is your name?”
When the reached the right street Steve pointed out the direction Tony needed to go, and left to catch a train home. Instead of going into the bar, Tony ducked into an alleyway and called Pepper.
He leaned over and wrapped a hand around Steve's wrist, holding his hand steady. He could feel his pulse hot and quick under his fingers as he drank carefully from Steve’s hands, the gesture leaving him feeling vulnerable and open in a way their kiss hadn’t.
“I can’t start over. I know you’re always looking forward, and that’s great. I’m not like that. I can’t toss away everything between us. Trying to ignore our past is going to lead us into repeating the same mistakes, and I can’t do something like Siberia to you again.”
Sam pushed himself away from the wall where he was leaning and crossed his arms, frowning. “Something wrong?”
This sounded too similar to many of the thoughts Steve had first had when met Tony. He was going to stop his brother right there, before things got any further off the rails.
Tony held up his hand and tilted it side to side. “Sorta? I got one shift in when I was little, and after that they started me on the shots. That was my first shift as an adult. My pack always believed that you couldn’t control your wolf, and most werewolf myths supported that theory. I never tested it, when the consequences were attacking your friends and the possibility of being put down by a cop or ranger.
“Tame? No, never. One cannot tame a dragon any more than one can tame the wind, and to do so would be an abomination against everything she is.”
“You’re saying a lot of things out loud. I’m glad the rest of the team is in the waiting room. The doctor will be back in a minute, he said you’re going to be fine. You have a concussion that should be gone in a few hours, and you’re about to go into surgery to get the metal shards out of you. They don’t have any of the drugs Helen made that work on you, so we’re waiting for Sam to get back from the compound.”
Steve squashed his hopes back down and crossed his arms defensively. Right. This was more along the lines of what he was expecting. Petty insults, blame, and complete self-centeredness sounded about par for the course. He snorted dismissively.
He made it sound so reasonable and Tony hated him. In the past few months of working with Tony, Steve had learned that if he went in fighting it would escalate things until nobody won, because you can't change the mind of the rock steady Captain America, and no one out stubborns the infamous Tony Stark. So being a master tactician, Steve had started trying different things until he settled on a unbeatable mix of kindness and logic that got Tony every single damn time. The kicker was that Tony knew exactly what he was doing, and it still worked.
Tony frowned into the distance, already thinking it through. “Well….” he started…”I'd probably have to be some form of reactor, there wouldn't be enough room for any other decent power supply without weighing down the boot. But I don’t think I could get a reactor much smaller than the one powering the suit without it becoming radioactive and unstable.” He continued, talking more to himself at this point, and Steve relaxed. Tony hadn’t realized his friend was tense until he watched his shoulders come down to normal. Must have been stressed about going in to fight alone.
“Neither of us is going to win anyway,” Tony said, matter of fact. Steve scooted closer. “We might.”
“You’re early? I didn’t even know that was possible. I was about to go over to your place to drag you back here.”
“Jarvis?” Steve asked dumbly. Tony had a couple small photos pinned to a tactboard in the back of his lab alongside semantics for phones and planes. There was a picture cut from a magazine of a young Tony crouched near DUM-E, a picture of the two of them at a press event also cut from a magazine, and finally a tattered polaroid of this very man along with two women standing next to Tony at graduation.
Steve frowned and followed him to the hanger bay, and handed him tools as Tony expertly stripped wires and soldered metal. Working with Tony felt natural. Their conversation flowed easily and Tony seemed to know where he would move before he did himself. By the end of the modifications, the suit was unrecognizable. The arms and legs were covered in gold plating, and Tony hammered a missile shell into a crude mask. Steve shivered as Tony slid it over his face, blue eyes peeking out through thick cut holes in the metal.
Obie shook his head. “You have to follow the prompter. Being Game Master is a big responsibility, and I was trusting you to be mature enough to handle it.”
not doing laundry, and put on the cleanest of his shirts. He trotted out to the barn, and opened the door to let the cows out. He grabbed the basket by the door, and started gathering the eggs from beneath the sleepy hens. He filled his basket in no time, and went back inside the house. He slotted them into cartons without washing them. Eggs naturally had a coating around the outside protecting them, and washing it off made them spoil faster. It probably wouldn't fly in the big city supermarkets, but out here people appreciated it. He filled as many cartons as he could while still reserving eggs for his pack’s breakfast. The stove was still in pieces, so he cracked the eggs into a pot, whisked them together with a fork and shoved them in the oven set to ‘volcano’. Jan wandered downstairs into the kitchen.
“Are you even hearing yourself? That’s crazy. Beyond crazy. How much did you have to drink before you came over here?”
“I was going to start by shutting off the power. But even with the automatic defenses down, there’s still going to be almost a hundred peacekeepers between us and the President.” Tony responded. Steve smiled.
“I’m sorry Mr. Rogers, that’s incorrect. You’re still short. You still have three weeks before I have to file the paperwork to take further action, is there any way you could raise the money in time?”
“We DO live like this! And I’m trying! When something breaks you just call a contractor, but we can’t! Even if we could afford it, I don’t own a fucking phone! When something breaks, I fix it, and I’m not a plumber! I don’t know cars or furnaces or anything! I was never supposed to be in charge, I never wanted to be in charge, and now I am, so I’m doing the best I fucking can!”
“The ranch isn't worth you tossing away your future and marrying some spoiled brat you'd never even met! Look, I'll go talk to Stane, I'll find you a way out of this, some loophole since we already have the cash.”
Clint agreed, barely listening as he ran his hands up and down the shiny silver finish, mumbling about how much left over pizza he was going to save now.
He reached around desperately for anything to help. His hands scrambled around the concrete floor until they found a familiar cool edge of metal. He picked up his shield and smashed it into the face of the armor. The armor’s head jerked sideways, denting open. A brown eye stared at him through the crack, wide with pain and fear. Tony’s voice broke through Steve’s frenzy.
“So that’s a yes. Where do you live? I’m coming by to pick you up. I want an official tour of Brooklyn.”
“If I’m more famous than Beyonce then I don’t have time for reading, now do I?” Tony said. “Why do you care?”
“We can’t do this. You’re not leaving the country in a week, if I mess this up it will ruin the whole team. What we have now is good, it’s enough.”
With 24 people, it was easy to lose track of who all had spoken and who hadn’t, especially when the games happened every year and Tony didn’t care to watch closely. He didn’t like to know who the contestants were because then he got upset when they died. It was better to not get invested.
Then he flipped the final switch and the propeller started spinning with a load roar. A group of ten Chitauri burst from the barn and raced towards the plane.
He got up and stalked out of the room, and peacekeeper shutting the door behind them and standing in front of it with his arms crossed.
Steve must have had the same thought because his arm tightened around Tony. They both were quiet for the rest of the night.
Tony did his best to answer her question. “I was a little busy trying not to throw up or pass out on my feet, thank you very much. I did get his name, he goes by Brian, also known as Captain Britain. I had Jarvis look him up, he's like the British version of Steve, except he claims to have gotten his super strength and all that jazz from magic.” Tony made a face, and Steve met his eyes, acknowledging his hatred of magic and silently reminding him to stay on topic. Tony abandoned his perfectly reasonable tangent about the horrors of magic, and continued.
“You know what, I think I’m going to write a thank you note to SHIELD, these hard hitting questions have really helped me understand you on a deeper level, and really connect with you as a person.” Tony said, his face dead serious and his eyes dancing with mirth.
“Yeah? Well now it's your fucking dump too, so if there's anything you don't like you can get off your ass and fix it yourself.”
Tony patted his hand and they laid in silence for a few moments. Steve loosened his grip and Tony shifted slightly. “Hey, you know what I did today? I threw away a perfectly good apple pie. I graffitied a baseball stadium. I stomped on a flag.”
There, see, he was horribly cocky and self inflated and all those other spoiled brat things. No regrets at all. He grabbed one of his bags, and walked with him outside. It was time for him to go, so he could get things back to normal, and figure out some new plan for dealing with the bank. Clint and Jan were standing by the truck, arguing.
“You’re the one who’s famous, what if someone gets a picture of you looking stupid on a metal horse?”
Steve swallowed. Leave it to Tony to figure it all out in about thirty seconds. If he backed out now, he would have to admit he was right, and the other thing he had learned the first week was to never admit Tony was right. Ever. Forget the other rule, this was number one. It went above touching Natasha's throwing knives or Thor's cape. So he slapped on a smile, and told Tony to meet him at the elevator in thirty.
Howard shook him roughly. “Knock it off, Anthony. Stark men are made of iron, we don’t cry. This is all part of the games, you need to get used to it.”
They went downstairs and most of the team was already sitting around the kitchen table. Conveniently, there were scrambled eggs already on the stove, so Steve dished up two plates and passed one to Tony, both of them taking a seat at the table. The teams cheerful chatter was cut off by a beep from Friday.
“It’s coming from the parachute,” Clint said, pointing. Their eyes followed his finger to land on a white speck, coming closer and closer. It landed on the ground in front of them, still beeping softly. Steve stepped forward cautiously and picked it up. There was a white paper note attached to the top of a metal container. Steve twisted the container open to reveal a thick roll of white bandages.
Steve nodded in agreement, and started running. He bashed down Chitauri as they charged at him, and wove his way through the battlefield. His instincts told him to turn around and fight until all the Chitauri laid dead at his feet, but he forced himself to keep moving. Tony had done this before, it was important to follow his plans. He reached the grey car and found the keys in the sun visor. He started it up, and a second later Tony landed on the roof.
Tony scoffed. “Not a full patent, those take forever to get approved. But the preliminary rights, yeah. I can do this, I know I can do this,” he pleaded. Steve stood up. He was starting to get excited. He felt hope blossom in his chest.
Tony shoved the sticks and blanket out of the way, limping through the water and up the bank. He coughed roughly as the smoke hit his throat. This was a bad idea, this was such a bad idea. He wrapped and arm around Steve’s shoulders and dragged him into the cave, where the both collapsed. Tony quickly put the sticks back up and covered them with a blanket, the smoke that had gotten in slowly clearing from the air. Tony rubbed Steve’s back as he coughed, slumping back against the wall as Steve finally drew in a full breath. Steve pushed himself into a sitting position against the wall and tried to wipe the smoke out of his watering eyes. He blinked a few times and squinted. “Tony?”
They sat in the waiting room together, Clint and Jan on their best behavior under Steve’s sharp eye. Tony wandered around the room, sitting in a chair, bouncing a few times, then getting up to wander again. Steve shoved all of the pens from the table into his pocket. He would use them for drawing later, and figured the bank could spare him a few measly pens after all the interest his family had paid over the years. So he was petty. Sue him.
Tony threw out his arms, ignoring the proffered bag. “What if it wasn’t like that? What if our wolf sides weren’t uncontrollable?”
He looked around the group to make sure everyone understood, then held himself still as Wanda swept them down to the street in a swirl of red. He landed gracefully on the ground and ran for the first enemy, arm raised back. The man was facing the other way and Steve was able to down him with a single punch, holding back enough not to kill him. He tried to avoid unnecessary casualties, and the man would be down for a good few hours, more than enough time for the police to come in a collect people with cuffs. The man’s pained grunt as he went down alerted the men around him, and they spun to face Wanda, Natasha and Steve. Wanda took a few of them down in a sweep of red magic, and Natasha got another with a swing of her stun baton. Steve charged forward to the next group. They raised their guns and fired, the blue energy blast dissipating harmlessly against the shield Wanda threw up. She dropped it and Steve took out a man with a kick. Natasha was like a ghost, dodging between men, taking them down with barely a sound and not a single wasted movement. Wanda was also taken down swatches of the militia with every wave of her arms. There was a whistling sound and the man in front of Steve fell, an arrow embedded in his chest.
Steve gave Tony a goofy grin. “I’ll start with the only part I got right last time. I love you, I love you so much, I could spend the rest of my life saying it and it wouldn’t be enough. And when we first met I didn’t even like you? I thought you were annoying, I thought you were stuck up.”
“It is an honor to meet the famed guard. Your heroic deeds are the stuff of legend, and I am honored to join your resistance.”
“Alright, we’ll go tonight to help, then we must return to camp so that the overseer is not alerted. Is that agreeable?”
“Are they carrot flavored?” That seemed like the most likely option of the choices. If Tony was trying to make yarn flavored muffins they were going to have a hard time.
He played the longest video that showed up in his search results and watched shaky handheld footage of the tops of people’s heads as an overdressed woman dug her hand around in a fishbowl full of paper. She pulled out a slip and read, “James Barnes!”
The other man took it, and shook it firmly, shooting him a cocky smile. “Captain Britain, but you can call me Brian.”
“So you can use that room, or pick a new one if you want. I’m next to Rhodey now. Let Friday know if you need anything.”
All the same, now that Steve had brought it up his eyes dropped down to Steve’s lips, pink and chapped. Their first kiss had been so short, so unsatisfying. If Steve gave him the chance Tony knew he could do better. Tony licked his lips and grinned as he saw color start to rise to Steve’s cheeks. He stood up quickly, clearing his throat. “I’m the one who suggested it. It won’t bother me, come on.”
The kid had introduced himself as Bryce or Bruce or something like that and was squirming awkwardly in his seat, clearly uncomfortable with being on TV. Tony wondered why he volunteered if he didn’t want to be here.
Their return was bitter sweet. The compound was the only home Steve had had in the twenty first century and he had missed its familiar comforts. He wanted to step inside the doors, and have everything go back to the way things used to be, when he could always find Bruce in the kitchen and Clint and Nat competing down at the range and Tony in the lab where he would always greet Steve with a smile and a kiss.
“I was trying to find your chosen in the woods. He is fleet of foot, much like a hart. I should have known that he had found his way back to you. That is how it is meant to be.”
There was a commotion outside, the sound of shouting echoing through the mine. All the prisoners looked up, wondering what was going on. The overseer walked down the row of prisoners, looking until his eyes latched onto Tony, who flinched. Being singled out was never good. Tony was shocked when instead of being yelled at or hit, he was unlocked from the line and pushed up the path and outside. Tony held up a hand to shield his eyes as he was hit by full power of the sun for the first time in months. Normally they stayed in the mines until they were brought up at nightfall to eat and rest. He blinked until his eyes adjusted, and he saw the source of the commotion. There were two men tied up and lying down in a cart, which in and of itself was not an unusual occurrence as Loki continued to root out loyalists to Thor. What had people in an uproar were the scaled metallic uniforms of the men. They must have been part of the dragon guard, the elite fighting force that were deathly loyal to the king, composed of his most trusted men that were gifted with the greatest honor of all; a dragon mount. Tony had seen the dragons sometimes, flying through the sky above the castle and resting in the stables. They were what had given him idea for an airplane. The dragons were incredibly useful for scouting and transporting messages, but you didn’t ask the king’s most favored knights to deliver your mail. Tony had learned from messages passed between travelers that all of the dragon guard had stayed loyal to Thor. Half of them had been taken down in the coup, the rest had fled to the mountains to regroup and start forming the resistance. Tony had been planning since the moment he got here on how he would get himself and the rest of the prisoners to the rebel camp. These men would be able to direct them through the many trails weaving through the mountains, if they survived.
Steve shook his head. “He disabled it. He wouldn’t have gone into a fight with me knowing how to shut down his suit with a few words.”
They were interrupted by the doorbell. Tony waved at Jarvis in the kitchen, and went to open it, Steve following. Tony opened the door to reveal Peggy standing there, a little older but just as beautiful as Steve remembered her. Tony greeted her warmly, inviting her inside and taking her coat. Steve managed to stutter out a welcome, as he mentally reeled. Strange had warned him people from his past would start to show up, and it made since that she was the first to appear, since Tony had a connection to her as well.
The guard pushed Tony's head down and forced him in the car like he was some sort of criminal. He tried the door handle and it was locked. He pounded on the divider between him and the driver. “Let me out! Hey!”
Tony felt tears streaming down his face as Howard's large hands dug into his side, his lungs tightening under pressure until he could breathe. Tony whimpered, and tears squeezed their way out of his eyes.
Getting the security footage of the skill trials took only seconds, and soon enough he was fast forwarding to Steve’s part. Steve stepped up to the glass, and on the other side Tony watched himself be dragged out of the room. He hadn’t realized at the time that Steve had paused painting. He looked worried, and left a white hand print on the glass where he leaned against it. He might have been talking but the footage had no sound. After a couple seconds pause he went back to his work. He used the full length of his arm to draw a circle on the glass, then drew a smaller circle inside of it. At the center he drew a star and stared definitely at the judges, some of which had jumped to their feet. Four peacekeepers entered the room to drag him out, and he didn’t fight. Instead, he kept his eyes locked on to the judges the whole time, and through the cameras Tony could feel the heat of his glare.
“I was mad at you. You yelled at me for going in to fight the birds alone then did the same thing today.” Tony retorted, punching his arm playfully. “I think I figured it out though. You’re upset about Brian.”
“Tony! How are you faring?” He stood up and was at Tony’s side in a flash, guiding him to a chair and handing him food and drink which Tony took eagerly, suppressed hunger roaring back to life. Steve introduced the people at the table as Clint, Bruce, Hank and Jan. Tony nodded at them politely.
The last time Steve had seen him, he had been slamming his shield into his chest, and Tony had a reactor again. It wasn’t hard to connect the dots.
He boarded his plane and the engines rumbled then died. Someone announced over crackling speakers that there were mechanical troubles and it would be an hour before they got into the air. Steve waited impatiently in the hold until they fixed the problem. Rumors of sabotage ran rampant. Whatever was wrong with the plane wasn’t normal wear and tear. Finally they took off, slow and rumbling. He could hear explosions as they approached the battlefield, and the plane tilted alarmingly as the pilot tried to avoid oncoming fire. There was a boom and the plane shook, trying to hold level. The bottom of the plane opened up, and Steve descended down a rope to the ground alongside his unit. The fighting on the ground was chaotic, and Steve stretched his reflexes to their fullest extent to block shots from the Chirtauri coming from all sides. The Chitauri soldier in front of him paused and Steve used the opening to knock him down with a throw of his shield. The shield bounced back to his hand and he turned to block an incoming blow. No strike came. The Chitauri behind him was frozen. Steve turned his head and realized that all of the aliens were standing stock still. Then as one, they fell to the ground like puppets whose strings had been cut. Steve approached one cautiously and kicked it. It didn’t move. It was dead, and somehow the humans had won. Cheers rose up from all across the battlefield.
The work never ended on the ranch, and they were horribly understaffed. After meeting him, he doubted Tony was going to be anything more than another mouth to feed, and he was going to use up almost the entire dowry to pay off the loan on the house, and what was left would go towards paying of the bills on the truck. He might have just dug himself into a deeper hole to get the bank off his back in the short run. Too late to worry about it now, there was alfalfa to be tossed and cattle to be rounded up and-well, you get the picture.
Weaponless and outnumbered, Steve and Tony dropped their hammers and raised their hands in surrender. A guard inspected the planes and came back, shaking his head. “They’re all ruined, the king is going to be furious. We must bring them to him immediately.”
“I can’t promise I’ll be able to change anything, I’ve been branded a traitor, no one would listen to me-”
So now I know rationally that nothing bad will happen when I shift, but I still have all these voices in the back of my head screaming, “Danger!”, “Monster!”, “Unnatural!”
Steve just shook his head in pure disbelief. Bucky. After all this time, Bucky was here, he was alive, he was healthy. Jan and Clint pulled him to the kitchen table to weasel out more details about where he’d been, and Tony tentatively joined them. Steve went up stairs to grab his brother some clothes. When he pushed open the door to Bucky’s room a cloud of dust swirled up. No one had been inside for the entire time he had been dead. Except he hadn't been dead. Just missing.
Steve let out a sad sound. “Oh, Tony.” He made sure Tony was looking into his eyes, so he could convey his complete sincerity. “You are your wolf and your wolf is you. There is nothing to be afraid of, nothing to try to hide away.”
Steve jumped in to reassure him. “No, it’s helpful. Wait, no, I meant nice. And helpful. Um. Both. Look, I like not having to guess what you’re thinking. Makes things easier, I’m bad at reading people.” He rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly.
Tony nodded. “Yeah, me too. Obie always told me I trusted people too easily. That I rolled over like a pup for a treat every time someone told me I did a good job. I think he took advantage of it a little to be honest. He only did it because he loves me, though.” he concluded.
“You are going to help me. This is good for both of us, less competition. And once you do this for me, I’ll let you go.”
Yay, happy ending! I ended up finishing in less chapters than I expected, but I'm glad I finished before Endgame. Thanks for reading my story, let me know if you liked it!
Coming back now, a few months later, it hurt to see that time had gone on without him. There were little things that were different. Tony had added the Avengers symbol to the lobby, the conference room had the chairs rearranged for a press conference instead of for team meetings. The plant by the front desk had died and there was a plastic one in its place. Steve knew he was the only one who watered it.
He put a heavy hand on Tony’s shoulder and he felt himself bending under the weight. He ducked his head, keeping his eyes on the ground.
“Yeah, fuck you too, buddy.” Tony snarled, and stomped out of the room with a angry huff. There were a few seconds of awkward silence.
“Are you alright?” Steve was looking at him, the tilt of his head betraying his curiosity and concern. Tony tugged up the bottom of his shirt, and Steve’s eyes widened.
He put a hand on his shoulder and Steve welcomed the familiar weight, even if the concern was unnecessary. “Look, I'll start at the beginning. Things were a real mess for a while, with the bank. We were dead broke even before we had to get sell off half the cows and pay for repairs and funeral costs. We got pretty deep in the hole, and the bank was going to take the ranch. So, I made a deal with Obadiah Stane.”
“No, no, no,” Stane interrupted with a wave of his hand and a sharp smile. “You know what, I think it might be possible for us to make a deal after all. You wanted money, another wolf, and a political alliance right?”
“Really? That explains why you were being so tight lipped about it. You shared just about everything else. I already know about Bucky.”
“I knew you were going to win,” Steve said happily. His eyebrows drew together in concern. “Tony? You alright?”
Tony waved a knife at him threateningly. “I will kill you. I will actually, literally kill you, if you don't read me the recipe.”
Steve bristled. Frugal. They both knew he meant ‘dirt poor’. And preserving the traditions of the pack didn't make them out dated, it meant they were real wolves, unlike this man who was prancing around in his monkey suit and smoking smelly cigars that would stick in his nose for days. At this point, after so many losses, traditions were all his pack had left.
"What? Why?" Tony asked. This was the only part of being Game Master that he had done right so far, he wasn’t going to leave in the middle!
“You’re still a threat,” Tony said, but lowered his hand and refolded the gauntlet into a thick watch band. He flopped back down onto his bed with a sigh.
“That’s right! Things were always coming between you poor star crossed lovers. Terrible for you, great for ratings. Thousands of people were tuning in to watch you two, this has been the most popular hunger games in the past five decades! Everyone was rooting for you.”
Problem was, he had no idea what place she was talking about and had no way of asking without giving away the game. He didn’t think he was going to get an invitation back to her place if he admitted to only being the name on the cover and not much else.
“Obie, there's something wrong. The contestant’s aren’t actually volunteers, we can’t send them into the arena.”
“-a puppy with delusions of grandeur.” Steve finished. “He grew up rich in the city, he’s not gonna want any dumb flowers. And he doesn’t like me like that.” he tried to explain a little desperately.
The guard’s face smoothed out as his suspicion vanished. He nodded and walked off. Steve and Tony breathed simultaneous sighs of relief.
Thanks for reading! Things still aren't going great for the boys but I promise things will get better! (Eventually.....)
“Hurts.” Tony mumbled. His head was pounding so hard he could barely think and his back was a mass of pain.
When he woke up in the future he had to start over a second time. He didn’t have so much as a single chair. Hell, he didn’t even own a pair of shoes. It had taken him a long time to start collecting things again. He had lived entirely in Shield issue t-shirts and pants for a depressingly long time. It wasn’t until Tony and Natasha dragged him out that he got some decent clothes, and moving into the tower was the first time he owned his own furniture and had more than a small barracks style bed and a metal desk. He had just about cried when he saw the comfortable chair, a neat desk, and drawers to put his clothes in that Tony had picked out and put in the room for him. When the whole team shifted to the compound, he had moved in with Tony, along with all of the stuff he had started to build up. An easel, his sketchbooks, a plant, a photo of Brooklyn. Little things, that made it a home instead of a hotel. If Tony had decided he needed a fresh start after their fight then those things would have gone straight into the garbage and Steve would be starting from scratch for the third time. With Thanos coming any day, he wouldn’t have time to waste on something like decorating so he would have to deal with living like it was temporary. For all he knew it was temporary; after Thanos it was possible that he would have to go back on the run. That was a depressing thought.
They immediately headed to the pawn shop. They busted in the door, the bell over head the door almost knocked of its hook. They went up to the front, where the jewelry was kept in a glass display case. The owner welcomed them.
Tony stuck his tongue out at him and settled in deeper. “Think of it as revenge for earlier,” he replied. On the surface he was referring to Clint stealing his chair at breakfast that morning, but it also held a barb for Steve, who was sitting alone in the spot they usually shared and shoving popcorn into his mouth and pretending not to listen. Clint sat of the arm of the love seat next to Steve with a grumble. “I’m picking the movie then.”
“Actually, that was the whole story. She still stops by in the summer when migrating. He's kind to animals, that's the point. I bet he's gotten Dottie out of that ditch a hundred times, easy. She's been getting in there every week since the fence broke.”
Steve closed his eyes and heard Tony’s footsteps as he walked to the plane. Would he have been able to kill the queen if he had known that it would cost Bucky and the Commandos their lives? Steve's hand tightened on the joystick.
They each picked a side and lunged, perfectly in sync after years of hunting together. Steve got a big mouthful of skin, and felt blood run between his teeth, tasting bitterly of chemicals. He let go and dived away in time to avoid the teeth of his opponent. With Stane’s head straining towards Steve, Bucky went for his throat, swiping with his claws and missing by an inch as Stane reared back. He snapped his head forward, grabbing Bucky’s leg in a death grip.
“Oh, that’s good. Last guy was here to collect a debt that Steve shouldn’t have had to pay, and me and Lucky took care of him.” The man patted a dirty purple bow that was half covered with duct tape. It was unclear if Lucky was the name of the dog or the bow. Tony didn’t want to find out.
Not your room, not our old room, just room, Steve noted with interest. Tony was trying so hard to be neutral.
Another shot barely missed him and hit a car which violently exploded, sending civilians screaming and covering as Natasha tried to usher them away while fighting off more men. The sound made his ears ring, and he barely missed being hit again. He threw a man into another man and punched the third. The fourth slammed the barrel of his gun into Steve’s back and he fell. As soon as he hit the ground he swept a leg out, knocking the man down before bouncing back to his feet and finishing him with a blow to the head. He fought his way forward, trying to keep the militia away from the innocents, and inadvertently separating himself from the rest of the team. Natasha tried to yell something at him over the noise of the battle. Even with his enhanced hearing, she wasn’t getting through.
Steve nodded and noted which room Tony entered, so he wouldn’t have to pay Natasha any more 4AM visits. The door closed before he could see inside, and Steve felt his curiosity spark to life. He would have to make an excuse to see.
At the park, Steve started to relax. The place seemed to hold a lot of happy memories for him. Tony got a hot dog, and followed Steve around as he pointed things out. The view of the water and the bridge was amazing. There was a carousel and after noticing Steve gaze at it with a dreamy expression, Tony insisted on taking a ride. Steve snapped back to reality and crossed his arms.
Tony fought down a wave of jealousy. Why did he care that Steve used to hold someone else like this? Everything they were doing was either practical or a lie for the cameras. All that mattered was that Steve was alive, and he was here. Tony shifted backwards to press tighter against him.
“Is she ok? She’s going to be ok?” he asked desperately, looking from his mom to Jarvis, searching for reassurance. They all looked away, and Howard was the one to respond.
He stared at the bed, where the coat hung over the side. Here he was again, still trying to take care of Tony, when Tony hadn’t asked him to, and probably didn’t want his help. They would return to the meeting room tomorrow, and Tony would get his coat back, probably having never realized that it was missing. And even if it was lost forever, Tony had tons of coats and plenty of money to buy more. Steve had taken it because he wanted to give it back, not because Tony needed him to.
Instead he woke up in the hospital, people patting him on the back and calling him ‘Captain America’, the man with the plan, a practical superhero. Steve didn’t know if it was killing the queen specifically, or that he had finally gotten them all, but he had broken the loop. It was a new day.
I made a mistake with the chapters, I labeled two different chapters #6, and I decided to put the ending in a new chapter, so it turns out there's actually 12 chapters in this story, not 10. Tony originally had a much longer and sadder backstory that I removed while editing and that messed up my chapters a bit. Tony's past still isn't all puppies and rainbows, and I think we got more than enough extra sadness from Steve here.
“Thanks for talking with me, I think I get it now. I won’t try to interfere with anything between you and the new guy. Goodnight, Tony.”
Steve raced the car out of the lot, driving back down the dirt road to the same unfamiliar town that they had passed on the way in. He pulled over at the first few buildings and Tony hopped out before the car rolled to a stop.
“I’m willing to offer you a position in my new kingdom. Unlike the others you were never cruel to me, always happy enough to tinker away and make my men such beautiful weapons. Your work is beyond measure, Stark, and I want more of it. Thor was always too blinded by the ways of war to truly appreciate the conquests of science. Your battery powered carts revolutionized our mines, and your plans will change the way we trade and communicate and fight forever, making those horrible dragons obsolete. You would be appreciated like you deserve, in my new kingdom. You can keep your title and your riches, and I’ll build you a new forge, one a thousand times larger and more splendid. All you have to do is kneel for me. What do you say?”
He handed over the quiver and she drew out all six arrows, and broke the tips off of five. She put them back in the quiver and slid off the side of the cornucopia to the ground, where she stuck them into the ground in one big fistful, hiding the tips in the dirt and making them all stick up the same height. She stepped back and gestured at them. “Gentlemen, draw your straws.”
Natasha snapped her gum and grinned. “He could have thrown something. Or shot you. This is Tony we’re talking about.”
The Captain looked him over, taking in the threadbare clothes and dusty calloused hands. He seemed to decided that Tony was telling the truth.
Tony squirmed under Steve’s steady look. “It’s in a drawer of my desk in the lab,” he finally admitted. Steve smiled and gave him a brief kiss.
The whole way, Steve stayed carefully within the speed limits, and they went straight to the bank. They walked up to the front door, and neither was embarrassed as they tracked dirt from the field onto the bank’s previously pristine floors. Steve was taking a gleeful satisfaction from it, stomping his feet unnecessarily hard to dislodge extra mud. He went to the receptionist and asked if Stern was in. She said he was and motioned them back with a wave. Tony followed him a step behind, his bold stride boosting Steve’s own confidence. They were really going to do this. After years of debt, months of work, it was almost over.
“That’s what it looked like. There was enough blood to fill lake Michigan and you had about twenty pieces of shrapnel the length of my thumb sticking out of you. Why the hell did you rip the star off? It was there for a reason, it’s extra material to keep you safe.”
“Don't tell me not to worry! I’m not worried! And if I was worried, it would be perfectly reasonable because Tony is missing!” Steve retorted and started pacing again.
Rhodey nodded and drove off. Tony approached the door and jiggled the handle of the back door they used for deliveries and trash. It was locked. It was also electronic, and that meant it was only a few seconds work for Tony to connect to it with his phone and hack it. He made his way inside the building, ducking behind corners whenever he heard footsteps. He made it to an emergency stairwell and descending into the lower levels of the building to where the electrical systems were stored. Before he could get to Obie he had to make it past several layers of automated security, including scanners, automatic weapons hidden in the walls, and silent alarms that would summon peacekeepers from all over the city. Rather than try to hack through all of them, Tony was going to shut the whole system down.
The trio sat in silence, both Sam and Steve savouring the suddenly tasteless dog. Natasha rapped her well-kept nails on the cobblestone road. She made some faces at the sky before pushing herself up off the ground. Her posture was confident and her head nodded up and down with reassurance. “Okay,” she said.
“No,” Steve fumed. The word came out as a low growl, rage threatening to tear the nearest person apart at the seams.
“So,” War Machine was apparently crap at starting casual conversations.  “You’re interested in a Tony.”
Through the small eye slots, Tony could see the murderous resolve in Steve’s darkened eyes. It sent a chill down his spine knowing that he was the source for Steve’s dark demeanor. “Steve,” Tony begged from behind the mask.
A breath caught in Steve’s throat. Tony was closer now than ever. Steve could only watch as Tony’s pink tongue wet the snow white handkerchief. White cloth darkened to gray as the strong fingers held the damp cloth against his face. It didn’t feel slimy and weird like when his mom did it. It was warm, and nice. The dilation of Tony's eyes as they floated across Steve's face. Tony’s breath against his. Steve’s chest migrated closer to Tony, as if pulled by an unknown magnetic force. God, it would be so easy. It wouldn't even take that much to lean a bit closer and-
He tried to pull away, but Tony held onto Steve’s hands and stopped him. “Calm down Cap. I’m not done with him either. But it doesn’t look like he’ll talking any time soon. Why don’t we go upstairs? Get something to drink. Make him wait and imagine what we have in store for him.”
Storage boxes lined the small section separating the cargo from its passengers. Supplies leftover from the mission were thrown on the floor in disarray. There were only so many places to hide a small boy, and thankfully, the younger Tony had picked a very easy to find spot. Curled up in a ball behind supply crates may not be the most original, but it certainly made Steve’s job easier.
“God no,” said Tony. “Bed is warm and it’s too early to get up. Besides, the last thing mini me needs is detailed knowledge about how he’s fucking his childhood icon.”
In frustration, Tony threw down his pair of wire cutters and plopped down in an empty chair. Why didn’t Obie understand? Why didn’t anybody understand? Why couldn’t the world just put its revolutions and political uprisings on hold until he figured everything out!
“What the fuck do you know about anything Sam?” Steve growled, thrashing about in the putrid stink. “Let me go this instant! I’m going to punch some fucking sense into his stupid fucking face. He can’t do this to us, Sam. He can’t do this to me!”
“Do you know the one thing in common all four of those companies have?” asked Natasha, dismissing another tower of dust covered cubes. “Very intelligent, very stupid men at the top of the tower.”
Tony reached for some loose fabric of the nightshirt. But the kid was fast. He dodged out of Tony’s reach and in less than a second, the kid had pushed himself up on the counter. He crawled across the counter until he was face to face with Steve. The kid grabbed Steve’s face with both hands and placed a syrupy, wet kiss on Steve’s lips.
Closing his eyes, Tony took it all in. The scent of crisp morning air and cold sweat, the heat radiating off Steve’s body, almost inviting him to come closer. Their hands brushing against each other as tiny sparks of contact jump between their fingers. A ghost of lips, close to his, mercilessly tempting him to give in and take a bite. Tony let out a breath and felt the air effortlessly roll off Steve’s parted lips. High off the light feeling inside his chest, Tony followed the script to reach out and couple their lips together, but abruptly stopped.
“He needs to know,” Sam insisted.  “He needs to know about how you feel about him and about the baggage you come with. Otherwise you two will get hung up over this whole gang business, and then you’ll spend the prime years of your life pining after him like an idiot.”
She crossed her arms, but the fire was gone from her eyes. Tony counted that as a win. “I don’t like it.”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure I’ll think of something.” Steve’s stubbornness coming out in full force. He would not bow down to Tony’s goading, no matter how much it rang true.  They didn’t have the money to buy arms. He knew that and Tony knew that. The Brooklyn Boys would have to face extinction at the hands of Hydra unless they did something drastic. But Steve would not allow Tony the satisfaction of being right for the last time. Tony betrayed him, took advantage of him. Steve had every right to be mad. He had every right to hate Tony. And he would do everything in his power to make sure Tony knew that as soon as the glimmer of happiness in his heart stopped crying from their loss.
On the screen a boy screamed as a girl tackled him to the ground, stabbing at his face with her knife. Blood sprayed and Tony forced himself to keep his eyes open.
He sat down at the table and Jan slid him a plate of eggs. He ate quickly and gathered up the dishes. He tossed them in the sink to do later, and started herding everyone towards the truck. He took the driver's seat, and after a vigorous game of Rock, Paper, Scissors, Tony claimed shotgun. The other two got in the bed, along with the milk and eggs. Steve started up the car, second try, and they were off. The half hour ride to town was peaceful, it still being too early for Clint and Jan to squabble. Tony dozed with his head resting on the window. The pack started to wake up more when he stopped the truck at the first house they delivered to. Clint carried a carton of eggs and a gallon of milk to the front door, and they moved on to their next stop. It was a Monday, so they had about six houses to deliver to. When they finished with the houses, Steve drove them the final stretch into town. He parked the truck, and they all helped carry the remaining milk jugs and eggs inside the grocery store. Steve did his usual haggling with the grocer, while Tony wandered around exploring the store. At this point it was almost eleven, so Clint and Jan left to go save them a table at the bar, where they could get lunch before they finished up their errands. After a few minutes of friendly negotiations Steve was able to get a satisfactory price, and the grocer handed over a chunk of cash. He would be getting most of it back anyway, after the pack came back after lunch to stock up. Steve wasn't going to suffer through the rest of the week surviving on canned ravioli if he could help it. He found Tony wandering through the cereal aisles, and they went outside to find the other two.
“This is what the people in the districts are like,” Howard said, matter of fact. To him, this is how things were. The sky was blue, gravity pulls things down, the districts were made up of monsters.
Steve laughed, as the whole situation sunk in. The brother he had mourned for everyday for the past year was here, in front of him, giving him his familiar stupid grin.
“Since Tony wanted to bring every shirt and knick knack he’s ever owned, he can figure it out himself. Get the cases out of the truck, then the two of you can help me out back. We need to make up for not being here all morning before it gets too dark.”
“Our Game Master has turned against the Capital, and us as a people. As of today, I denounce him as a traitor.”
