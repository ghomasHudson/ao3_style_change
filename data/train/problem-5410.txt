“Uh, it gave Stane all of our properties and all the money. It also gave him SI. He now holds 60% of the company’s shares”.
They had been together for two years now. Tony remembered the day they met like it was yesterday. Rhodey got tired of his roommates shenanigans ― Tony had been in a “inventing spree” for three days, which meant little food, smelly clothes and very deep dark circles under his eyes ― and decided enough was enough. He took Tony by the ear ― literally, he might add ― and locked him in the bathroom until he took a shower, shaved and put on clean clothes. When he resembled a normal person again, Rhodey took him out to a party to
“Just… She’s not kicking right now, just wait a minute”, he got a little bit closer and started whispering to his own stomach, “Come on, Maguna, give us a little kick!”
sound. The corpse, then, took a few steps away from the computer and, when it was far enough from it, let itself fall to the ground and there it stayed, moving no longer.
She narrowed her eyes, closely watching Barnes before turning her attention to Steve. She circled her desk and walked slowly towards him, putting both her hands firmly on either side of the chair armrests. Steve’s eyes widened and he discreetly pulled back a little more, trying to put some space between the Director’s irate face and his own.
And so, together, the group started walking towards the lit path, feeling not entirely ready for an adventure.
“That’s…” Steve tried to deny it, but, in the end, merely sighed and agreed, “Yep, that’s exactly what I’m doing”.
“Right, so, we made a wedding invitation using this weird website we found and sent it to Tony Stark and he kind of called today to invite us over for brunch at this stupid expensive hotel and to RSVP to the wedding”.
more than just business partners. In fact, they were barely that, especially now that Stane had been selling them old tech and trying to pass it as new. Still, the blond sighed and replied.
“Hey, look who came to eat with the lower class”, the archer exclaimed with his mouth full, pointing the dripping spoon at Tony, “I thought you’d lock yourself in your room and cry over Cap’s absence”.
“I haven’t been here since the funeral. I asked the company that cleans the house to keep everything the way it was, so I knew what to expect when I got here, I just…”
“The program is inside this flash drive”, he turned to Natasha, showing her the device, “All you have to do is insert it in a USB port and it will do all the work for you”.
Mario’s was completely empty. All the tables had been removed, leaving only one in the middle of the restaurant, with a white tablecloth, two blue orchids and some lit candles.
Jessica knew this wouldn’t be an easy job. In her experience as a Private Investigator, a perfect crime usually required only two things: money and connections. And, sadly, her target had both to spare.
She blinked deliberately slowly and took a step closer, "Are you implying that I'm lying, Agent Gardner?"
“I’ll hold you to it, Natalie”, and with a final exchange of smiles, Evelyn walked away towards the elevators to meet her friends.
“I’m aware, Mr. Stark”, the doctor said, once more looking around with fear in his eyes, “I came upon these photos thanks to a reporter who has been investigating this situation. But I can tell you, it is not the first time something like this has come to my attention”.
“I’m in my room. Please, please, will you come here, please?” the child begged once more, sniffling.
“I missed you too, sweetheart. Don’t worry, I’m okay”, he said before the engineer could ask, taking his face in his hands and kissing him. Tony winced slightly at the touch, making Steve frown.
The whole situation sucked; there was no other way to put it. Steve was adamant that nothing could happen between them, especially given the fact that he was an agent working to protect Tony, and that a romantic relationship would be not only unethical, but also might complicate his job too much. Tony wasn’t thrilled about it, but respected and accepted Steve’s reasons nonetheless. The fact that they couldn’t be together, however, did not mean they couldn’t flirt shamelessly all the time. A touch on the arm whenever possible, holding hands when they went out to get food, lying his head on Steve’s shoulder during a movie or even running his fingers through Steve’s hair when he lay down with his head on Tony’s legs. The touches were harmless, but they were enough to drive him insane. There were times, however, when Steve seemed to forget himself and he’d just touch the engineer in an intimate way. Like when they were both on the line for Tacos and Tony felt Steve’s arms slowly encircle his waist. He held his breath and even closed his eyes, feeling the strong arms gently squeeze him just a bit, and then… his lips were on Tony’s neck, not exactly touching the skin, just… hovering there. He could feel Steve’s breath on his neck, slow and steady, making him shiver… His lips stood there for a few seconds, just blowing hot air on Tony’s neck, before he came to his senses and, with a sigh, stepped away, letting his arms fall from the engineer’s waist. Tony had turned them, his breathing erratic, only to be met with Steve’s sweet, sad smile. They never talked about these moments of weakness, preferring to pretend they had never happened instead, and cherishing them when they were in their own bedrooms, alone and free to remember and fantasize about things that could never happen.
me, the thought that someday I’m going to ask something of you, and you won't say no, even though you should. I can't be the reason you get hurt. Don't make me,
“Steve?” Tony asked, hoarse, because he’s seen mixed messages more than once in his life, but this is a whole ‘nother level of thing.
Okay, that was… pretty impressive. And Wayne seemed pretty pleased that Tony had turned up, from the way his eyes flicked over Tony and the way his arm slung over Tony’s shoulders, and the fresh glasses of champagne that kept appearing in his hands, and—
eked out win, all in the frigid battleground of the Siberian tundra: the Cabal beaten back by a terrifyingly narrow margin.
“No,” Tony says. Whispers. His voice is gritty, hoarse. He barely shakes his head, like he’s terrified of dislodging Steve’s grip.
And Tony wasn't a total bastard, he’d been nice, brought Steve off with his hands and mouth, fast and dirty, the best way he knew how.
“Can I—Tell me what you want, my mouth, I could,” Steve had said, and Tony had to close his eyes, because that.
“Steve?” he said softly, but though Steve's eyes were on him, the gaze was blurred, hazy, like a meth addict on a perfect high.
“Can I— I have a quick question for you, Miss Lewis,” Steve said, settling down on the other end of her couch. It was a pleasantly boring Tuesday evening; Darcy was playing an intense level of Kwazy Lupcakes, and she held up an imperious finger, frowning in concentration, before the phone trilled with news of her victory and she turned to him. “Shoot, pretty boy. How can I help?”
happening. Tony had liked the Bond novels when he was younger. He liked that thing from Goldfinger, the line about how once was happenstance, twice was coincidence but three times was enemy action.
The first time it happened, it was at a trashy party in West Hollywood the Avengers had just saved from being eaten by giant, undead, gorilla-zombies, reanimated by this SFX technician who’d worked on the last Kong movie. (It had flopped. He’d gotten cranky.
“Aw, Tony…” Steve protests, but Tony can feel him sinking into his side, a long line of heat, and he hides a smirk.
he’s finally getting it, fingers hooking tightly into Steve’s belt loops, yanking him close, bodies almost slamming together. With his other hand, he blindly feels around the workstation, before he finds what he apparently needs - a lugnut, about an inch wide. “Steve, Steven, oh Captain, my Captain, will you do me the very great honor—”
Steve got up. He was taller than Tony — it was starkly obvious now, as he looked down. Tony felt his throat dry up. Those eyes were dark and huge, and they were fixed intently on him. “Okay,” he said softly. Steve’s voice felt like it was sliding all over him. “Where to?”
“Okay,” Steve says. The drop of sweat has pooled in his clavicle. Some part of his brain is roaring alarms, but that part of brain doesn’t seem to control his hand, because he lifts it up, up, all the way, the nail of his index finger wiping away that perfect round drop, smearing it across his collarbone, a gleam of wetness, and Tony—
Something dark crosses the light, and in the dimness, his vision gradually recovers. Blue eyes stare into his, a forehead creased with fear. “Tony?” a painfully familiar voice is saying. That hand is still on his shoulder. “Tony!”
a hand coming around him, rubbing Tony’s bulge through his pants, mouthing his neck, that cock still grinding into the small of his back, terrifyingly big, perfectly sized,
“Well, that’s a shame,” Tony remarked lightly. There was a hot, bright feeling expanding in his chest, like a star going nova inside his ribs, expanding and heating and brightening, and it felt like he was glowing, like there was light pouring out of his fingertips and his eyes.
Steve narrows his eyes. “I’m not letting you dream up some crazy ideas in your head, where you think this is a one night stand, or something like that. You want this, you’re in it for the long haul.” That scotch mustn’t be all that strong, Steve figures, because it doesn’t stop his stomach from swooping unsteadily now. “Unless you don’t want— this. Which is—” He carefully loosens his grip, something cold fisting in his stomach. “Which is fine, of course, I don’t—”
?” Tony asks, letting himself into Steve’s hideous little flat in Bed-Stuy. He kicks at the threadbare, industrial grey carpeting and tries hard not to let existential horror overtake him when he sees the dull, green paint on the walls. It matches the kitchen appliances. Everything in the room looks like it was last refurbished in the Hoover administration. Tony can feel an asbestos coming on. “This is— I don’t think they make words for this anymore.”
“Look,” Steve goes on, both hands braced on either side of the bag to steady it, while sand bleeds out to the ground. “Since I'm likely going to not be your freeloading tenant very soon, I feel okay saying this.”
swimsuit models, Natasha twerked with a tipsy ballerina from the Swedish National Ballet company, Clint constructed a six foot high shot glass pyramid, lit it on fire, and then
“That’s not what I—” There is a bead of sweat working it’s way down Tony’s neck, glistening golden in the sunlight. Steve keeps getting distracted by it, and then by the angry flash in those dark eyes, the steady rise and fall of his chest. His sweatpants have slipped… dangerously low.
“I thought—” And now it was Steve’s turn to pause, and stutter, and struggle to look Tony in the eye. “After we— After we last talked, what I said, I thought maybe you wouldn’t want me to—”
“Fuck off,” she said, but nicely, and Steve obeyed with a smile. Something was starting to pound quite viciously in his throat. Tony hadn’t asked Pepper to move in, and Steve couldn’t help but feel that that was, almost definitely, his own stupid fault. God damn it.
Amanda was staring at him like he’d just mooned a nun. “Good God, I really don’t understand you Americans,” she muttered, and then—
“Well, why the fuck not,” Tony muttered crankily, and dove in for another kiss, Steve huffing a quiet laugh, threading his hand through those layers of soft, damp, ash blond hair, curving his jaw to exactly the right angle, walking him backwards into the bed.
It's always surprising, every time they come this close, which isn't often in the first place, how unbalanced it makes him feel, how it makes his skin prickle, and his heartbeat stutter, having this chance to step in close and have Steve meet his eyes.
Things finally came to a head in Gotham, where the Martha Wayne Memorial Foundation was throwing its massive annual fundraiser, except this time Steve had found out Tony had gotten an invite and guilted him into attending. ‘They do really good work, Tony,’ and ‘Isn’t it nice of Mr. Wayne to help out the community like that?’ as if Tony didn’t literally hurl himself bodily at gunrunners, every other day. What the hell was so impressive about Bruce Wayne, anyway, was what Tony was thinking grumpily the whole flight there, until they put down the jet on one of the Manor’s helipads and Tony finally caught sight of the man himself, clad in a gorgeously tailored tux, all clean dark lines and those magnificent shoulders.
Steve’s still looking at him steadily, and his voice is as full of conviction as only Captain America's can be. “Somebody, or something, along the way, made you convinced you're the bad guy, and you're just not. I don't know what kinds of bedtime stories they tell these days, but Tony… You put on a literal shining suit of armour and
. It was horrible. Tony had no idea what the fine for sexual harassment was, and he definitely didn’t want to find out.
“Speak for yourself, old man,” Tony replies easily. He watches Steve out of the corner of his eye. “I like him just the way he is.”
Tony gasps awake, to the sound of shearing metal. The dark headpiece of the device is ripped off, and light streams in, crystal bright and twice as harsh, and Tony blinks into the sudden onslaught. There’s a hand on his shoulder, shaking him.
Steve borrows a dramful of that ten thousand year old Asgardian scotch from Thor — Well, borrows implies intent to return. Commandeers, that might be a better word. Nothing quite like liquid courage, right?
“Beautiful,” Steve murmured, spine rising sinuously off the bed, finding Tony's mouth, drawing them together. Steve kissed him lazily, sloppy, gripping his jaw and tongue-fucking his mouth. His hips had started some kind of slow rocking motion, and it made that cock rub agaisnt Tony’s oversensitive prostate, pain flaring through his nerves, on the electric edge of pleasure.
The music was slowly coming back on. Someone was winding through the crowd, a staff member. “Sir,” the twinky little hipster shithead was saying, “I'm going to have to ask you and your friend to leave, please.”
“Yeah, well. Honestly? This feels like a good idea right now.” He looks at Tony then, stops fiddling with the dial to his gym locker for three whole seconds. “I need to do this. It’d be nice if you were, I don’t know, happy for me or something.”
to know, you lunatic?” Tony demanded, stalking angrily towards Steve, jabbing a finger into his chest. “You’ve never even
That's the part of it that doesn't make sense, because he’s wanted to kiss Steve for— for ages, forever, it feels like, but he’s always managed to talk himself off the ledge before. Their friendship is more important, the team is more important. And the thing is—
“Only if you bring him right back,” she replied with a quirk of her lips, and Steve nodded before touching Tony’s arm and guiding him away.
He put on his tightest jeans, the kind that made his ass look seven kinds of fuckable, and a dark silk shirt that he left mostly unbuttoned, letting the reactor do its job, and got into his Lotus and roared off to the seediest gay bar he could find in the East Village.
“Tony. That’s not going to make you happier,” Steve said quietly, and Tony stopped breathing. “I don’t know what’s up with you, but— you keep doing this, every time we go somewhere new, and I see the way you look the next morning and it isn’t— this isn’t the answer, don’t you see? This isn’t the solution. There’s someone new at every party, but they never make you happier, Tony, and it’s—”
“No I don’t,” came his immediate reply. “No, I really don’t, because apparently I’ve been missing clues this whole— this
Another rolling thrust, and Tony groaned, like he'd taken a gut punch, eyes falling shut, gasping for breath.
“It does?” Tony asks. Even to his ears, his voice sounds breathless. Jesus, he sounds like a girl. A
“I’m gonna let you rethink that one in a couple of seconds.” Tony snorts, and crosses his arms over the reactor, while Steve goes on, “I don't know who told you you're a bad guy.
Tony had lots of theories on that, but his favourite was along the lines of, an ass that fine shouldn’t belong to a straight man. Not like he was gonna tell Steve that one. Pepper had instituted a swear jar on the Avengers common based off of some Scandinavian road traffic fine model — everytime
“If you’re thinking about food,” Tony began to growl, outraged, and Steve tugged him close with an impatient snap of his wrist. And as their hips slotted together, and Tony felt the hard bulge in Steve’s trousers nudge up against his own, his eyes went wide
“Natasha’s my friend,” Steve says, all placid, getting into the elevator, hitting the button for the gym floor. “I like spending time with my friends.”
” Steve protests, but his hand’s on Tony’s shoulder, an dhis feet move in time to the music, and where their hands are clasped, Steve’s grip is tight and warm.
“JARVIS can control pretty much the entire building, from the lights to the elevators. He’ll make sure the security cameras won’t be a problem to you”, he said to Natasha, who nodded, “You’re going to enter the building through this door right here, on the side. The only people who use this entrance are the delivery men and maintenance crew, so it will be deserted. Pepper will be waiting for you there, to open the door for you and take you to the service elevator”.
Rage was burning inside of him. He wanted to punch him, to hurt him, to kill him in the worst possible way. He could feel the tears filling his eyes, but he refused to let them fall. He looked over the man’s shoulder and saw Natasha, a few feet away, ready to jump him. She nodded and, in that moment, he knew exactly what he needed to do.
Soon, the waitress brought them their plates and they ate and talked and laughed all night long. And, for a few hours, Tony forgot about all his insecurities and his doubts and just let himself enjoy Steve’s company.
Tony walked to the door and opened it with a smile, ready to tease Bucky about the knocking. His smile suddenly disappeared as he looked into the face of Obadiah Stane.
They quickly parted ways. Steve ran to the nearest bathroom, opening the door with more force than necessary, frantically looking around.
He was begging. He looked so sad and so lost, Tony’s heart melted a little. So, he crossed his arms and waited for Steve to talk.
Tony shook his head and motioned with his hand, as if telling Natasha to go ahead and do it already.
Bucky and Steve just looked at each other, not knowing what to say. Tony, probably thinking they were speechless out of gratitude for the gesture, got up from his chair, phone in hand.
The team searched every floor and every room of the building for what seemed like hours and finally managed to find the missing soldiers in Conference Room B. Clint and Steve walked in first, shield and bows at the ready, and quickly lowered them when they saw the people inside.
― because that’s what I am to them, a dumb kid ― to own the largest technological empire in the world. What do you do?”
He had to tell Ty. Did he even want kids? They’d never talked about it before. I mean, sure, they were going to get married soon, but kids? Kids were a whole different story.
he wanted— but that would mean not kissing Steve, and that wasn’t an option, that could never be an option, so all Tony did was hitch his thigh up, let his quads rub against that magnificent cock, swallow the rough, needy sounds Steve was making into his mouth.
He looked like he was close to actually breaking a sweat, his chest already red and blotchy, his eyes engulfed in black. And
He turns around slowly. That isn’t actually true. Jarvis would not get bored. Jarvis wouldn’t fall asleep. Jarvis would be a
Steve’s hands were on him now, those hands that had once not dared to touch Tony. They were stroking his hip, palming his ass, groping the tense length of his thighs. Tony's cock was soft now, sweat drying uncomfortably on his skin, his ass throbbing around the intrusion of Steve’s cock.
The second time it happened, it wasn’t anything like that. It was practically respectable. The UN Security Council had invited them to a little soirée in Brussels and they’d shown up in style — suits and tuxes and in Natasha’s case, a stunning de la Renta. And then Tony and the British ambassador to who-cared-where got to talking, and as it turned out, she had a Masters in Advanced Mathematics, and she was telling him about some Captain America fansite that had developed a polynomial function to describe the curve of Steve’s ass — while he had his hand on her waist, sure, and her dress had no back, okay, and he had been rubbing slow idly circles at the base of her spine for a minute or so now, possibly, and she was showing no signs that she minded, and in fact, that she felt the exact opposite — when Tony felt his neck prickle and speak of the devil, turned to see
, he said sniffling, with tears in his eyes, while Steve pulled him closer, touching his forehead with his lips and murmuring words of comfort.
Iron Man, aka billionaire playboy Tony Stark, saved hundreds of lives last night from a terrorist attack perpetrated by Russian terrorist Ivan Vanko. According to sources, military contractor and CEO of Hammer Industries, Justin Hammer, was also involved and is now in the custody of the FBI.
He smiled. “Not on your life, soldier”, he whispered before meeting his lover half way, slamming their lips together in a desperate kiss. Tony slowly ran his hands down Steve’s chest and played a bit with the hem of the towel while they thoroughly explored each other’s mouths. The mechanic finally broke the kiss, running his lips down Steve’s chin and neck. He untied the towel around his lover’s waist and smiled wickedly at him.
“No, ma’am. The Winter Soldier, Hawkeye and I remained with our faces covered the entire time. The Black Widow, however, was exposed”.
Sorry for the delay, guys! I finally got the new Animal Crossing and I just couldn't put it down, plus quarantine had me spiraling these few days. Hope everyone is doing well and being safe!
It was a disaster. There was no other way to put it. Bucky and Sam had been, well, not helpful at all. First, they had laughed at Steve and called him a ‘dumb blond with legs for days’ and then they had insisted that he had to tell Tony how he felt – which was insane, of course. Tony was having a baby! Another man’s baby! He had a lot on his plate already, Steve couldn’t possibly just go over to his apartment and say ‘hey, by the way? Totally in love with you over here, would sure like to kiss you and bed you, 10/10 would like to be your baby’s other daddy, so how about it?’ Yeah, no, it was absolute insanity. All he needed to do was to keep his mouth shut and try not to look like a lovesick puppy every time Tony so much as took a step.
“I spent all my life in the spotlight”, Tony replied, squeezing Steve’s arm as they neared the end of the red carpet and climbed the steps towards the entrance, “I never really liked it. Not so much because of the attention, because, if I’m being honest, I love being the center of attention”, he laughed under his breath”, but the scrutiny, the judgment… It was tough growing up like that”.
“Nah”, Tony denied, gesturing with his hand as if the whole thing was no big deal, “It’s fine, I mean, what are you going to do, introduce me to everyone as your fuck buddy? That would be awkward, right?”
Steve smiled and nodded, putting his shield on his back and stepping on the engineer’s feet, holding the small hooks that Tony had put in the armor especially for this. He closed his eyes and felt the wind hitting his face. He buried his head on Tony’s neck, hiding it until they finally landed.
Suddenly Bucky jumped on the couch, crouching and looking at Steve with wide eyes, “Stevie, Stevie, hear me out. You said Tony flirted with you, right?”
, not even waiting for a response as he grabbed his jacket and closed the door to his shophouse, running down the stairs to meet his date. He opened the door downstairs with a smile, stepping outside. Steve was smiling as well, but he looked nervous. It was adorable.
“Let me see if I understand this”, Loki said, curving himself over the table to look at the teens, “you sit around a table with pieces of paper and pretend to be other people in a game of make believe? Is this common practice amongst Midgardians?”
After everything they had been through… SHIELD falling, the accords, Siberia, the fucking purple asshole… Everything that had happened and yet the universe had thrown them together again and again and again. They were meant to be together. And Goddamn it they were going to be together because Bucky was NOT about to just accept this shit.
“He’ll be persuaded of nothing! Boy is just as much a stubborn ass as his father! He needs to be gone so
But Tony still didn’t sound too sincere. He looked at the car in awe, as if he very much wanted to touch it, but was too afraid to do it. Steve quickly opened the door for him, helping Tony inside.
He looked down to see Tony’s hand on his crotch and moaned out loud when he started fondling through his jeans.
The doctors insisted on checking Steve once more before sending him home. They had a very hard time doing it, however, because the blonde refused to let go of Tony’s hand, all the while staring at him like he was seeing him for the very first time. When it was finally clear that there was nothing physically wrong with the super soldier, they were allowed to leave.
Steve smiled and nodded, taking his towel from the floor and going back to their bedroom to change. Tony stood there, biting his own lip as he watched his lover go, admiring his bare ass and imagining all the things he’d do to Steve that night. He smiled and took a deep breath to calm himself, and his cock, down. There would be plenty of time for that later.
“I got the message. No need for a repeat performance”, Tony said, turning back to the engine he was supposed to fix.
“Damn right I did. The guy I’d been madly in love with for two years wanted to date me, you bet your ass I ran to him”.
Little Morgan entered the room much like a hurricane, throwing herself in Steve’s arm with a loud scream of “Papa! Look at my dress!”
“We’re in a very good mood today, uh boss?”, Happy asked, looking at Steve through the rear view mirror.
It wasn’t something Steve was comfortable with, to be honest, but he learned to live with it all the same. And so, every agent, from level 1 to 9, knew a little piece of information that the others didn’t know. There was only one thing none of them knew: the Director’s identity.
“No, you shouldn’t. But I understand how terrible you feel right now. And I’ll forgive you if you come with me”.
“Tony, calm down or we’re gonna have to sedate you”, Natasha said. She tried to grab his face, to force him to look at her and not at the closed door where Steve had just gone through, but stopped before she could touch him, looking at her bloodied hands.
“You can’t go on this date”, Bucky replied, walking from one side of their small living room to the other.
They heard Bucky’s voice echo through the hallway and turned in time to see Steve running towards them, a desperate look on his face. Tony immediately uncrossed his arms and stepped forward, worried.
Loki had suddenly materialized without any warning, as he usually did, arms behind his back as he looked around the living room with a frown.
He helped Tony up and out of the store, leaving some money to the woman on the nearest counter as he quickly explained the situation, and was about to call an Uber when Tony mentioned his car parked right outside. As quickly as he could, Steve drove to the nearest hospital, holding Tony’s hand and calming him down during the whole ride.
Anthony had arrived on a Thursday, in the middle of one of the worst thunderstorms Malibu had seen in years. Peggy had arrived a few hours after the birth, absolutely soaking wet despite the umbrella poor Jarvis held for her all the way to the door.
The gate soon opened and the team stepped inside into what appeared to be an empty reception. Clint lowered his bow and put the arrow back into his quiver.
The bartender woke him from his daydreams, pushing his drink towards him. Steve picked it up and walked back to where Bruce and Tony were talking. He frowned when he saw Dr. Banner standing there, alone.
“I get that. And, to be honest, I’d much rather if you didn’t, but that dumbass is head over heels in love with you. You’re going to break his heart”.
His mother cried when he told her. She even begged him not to do it. But he had no choice. She needed the treatment and that was the only way he could pay for it. The army was a hard choice, but it was the right one. Even if he died, at least his mother would get enough money to pay for part of the treatment. It was all he could do. So he enlisted that same afternoon. Passing the ASVAB was easy. The real problem was the medical exam.
It had taken her a few days to find the man responsible for the cameras that particular night. Adrian Toomes, 51 years old, recently opened a small electronics firm with an old friend. Jessica was currently sitting right outside his house, snapping pictures with her camera. The house was big and looked expensive; she’d bet her right kidney that there was a big pool on the backyard. Fancy stuff for a guy who up until a year ago was working as a night watchman for a shitty security company. It was suspicious enough to make Jessica curious.
Matthew’s eyes were hidden behind the sunglasses, but Tony would bet everything he had that they were filled with determination. He whispered a polite, and grateful, thank you and watched as Steve walked Matthew to the door.
“Sir, look”, the Private said, typing something on his computer, making the small screen bigger, “They look fine”.
Margaret was already on her feet, telling Fury to secure her a jet right that moment while trying to calm her godson down at the same time.
So, the reason I didn't finish this sooner is because I watched Endgame Wednesday and I've been crying ever since, so I needed a few days to... Cry less, I guess, 'cause I'm still crying lol
Natasha raised an eyebrow, crossing her arms. “Do I understand what it’s like to look the man you have always loved in the eyes and see no recognition on them? Do I know what is like to be around the man you love and not be able to touch him or kiss him or hug him because he doesn’t remember who you are or what you meant to each other? Yes, Tony, I think I know a little about that”.
“There’s smoke. There, near the mountains!”, Bucky shouted, pointed at the place where thick, black smoke was rising slowly.
People were staring at him; had been since he left the restaurant twenty minutes ago. He knew that, logically, these people in the supermarket could not know what had just happened to him and therefore were not, in fact, looking at him with pity, but his traitorous mind didn’t seem to want to accept that fact.
The three men exchanged a look before nodding. They radioed the base, giving them the coordinates for the war camp before getting into the helicopter once more. For the next three hours they flew around the exploded area, eyes wide open, trying to catch anything out of the ordinary. Natasha was just about to tell them they were running out of gas when she spotted something.
He understood the words, of course he did. He was a genius and, even if he wasn’t, they were easy enough to understand. Still, he asked:
, Captain, but for a… let’s say business proposition. Just hear me out. SHIELD trains the best people. And I happen to know a few people in very high positions in our government who would be very interested in a… let’s say… merger”, he started, gesturing to the chair nearby. Steve sat down, still looking very suspicious. “We both know how the world works. Civilians think it’s all black and white, good and bad, but
“I put my tongue in your mouth daily, Natasha, I can handle your germs”, he replied with his mouth still full, earning a slap on the back of the head.
He saw the flash of hurt passing through her eyes, the sadness that seemed to set in them. It wasn’t fair, he knew. Aunt Peggy had done everything that she could to protect Tony. It wasn’t her fault that that hadn’t been enough. He refused to apologize for his words, however. Tony stood his ground, head held high, staring his aunt down with such determination that, after a few seconds, she finally relented with a sigh.
as he walked. Steve and Bucky, still silent, just stared at his back. Well, Bucky stared at his back. Steve was staring a little bit more south of there.
“No. This is common practice amongst nerds. Which we are’, Harley replied, staring dead eyed at Loki and raising his hand for a high five, to which Cassie promptly slapped.
Tony is dying, there is no denying it. Even though he still has hope that somehow he will find a replacement for the palladium, he is a practical man, always has been. And so, he starts to get his affairs in order.
“A little scared, but she’ll be fine”, he replied, putting away his own gun and holding the girl a bit tighter, “Come one, there’s nothing left here. Let’s go”.
I'm incredibly sorry about the delay, guys! I'll try to update this fic more frequently now, since it's almost done! lol Thank you for all your kind comments on the previous chapters and I hope you can leave me some more nice comments on this one! (; Have a nice week, everyone!
So, no computer yet, guys! I bought a SSD on Amazon to fix my computer, but they sent me one that didn't work so I had to return it and it's been six days and they still haven't given me my money back, so great!
“You know, when I ordered the hit on you… It wasn’t personal. You’re good at this creating thing, Tony. The weapons, the missiles, the tech… They were all amazing. So much better than anything Howard ever did, that’s for sure”, he explained, grabbing Tony’s face, smiling down at him, “but you’re turning 21 soon and that means you’d get the company. I worked too damn hard to let that happen”.
Tony tried to move, but found that he couldn’t. For a second, he thought maybe his legs and hands were bound by ropes, but a quick look down told him that wasn’t the case. In fact, there was nothing holding him down, nothing restraining him, and yet, for some reason, his body would not move no matter how hard he tried.
“Only a crazy person would stand you up. But hey, their loss is my gain! So, can I interest you in the best burger you’ll ever eat?”
Steve took his hand, touching Tony’s face slightly, turning it so they could look into each other’s eyes. “It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me, but… I really like you and, if you’d be willing to do this again, then I’d like to know. So I can work on whatever it is”.
And as it turns out, four years later, the lugnut, which was a spare from an old Iron Man suit, was made of gold-titanium alloy - incidentally, a fine material for ring-making.
“Sure you are, cheesecake. Come on. There’s another Steve in this one - prettiest thing Hollywood ever made, you’ll love him.”
They didn't speak until they’d gotten into the car—apparently Steve had taken a cab, and made it all the way home, a lot faster than they should've done.
“Wanted me to fuck you, isn't that right, sweetheart. Wanted to find out how many times I can come for you.”
“Yes, Mr. Stark,” Hipster Douche replied, equable, his eyes dropping meaningfully to Tony’s chest, and Tony had to give it to him: That took serious balls, taking that tone around a man with a kill count. Who woulda thought. “I know who you are,” he continued. “I’m going to have to ask you to leave anyway.”
“Don’t— dont do that,” Steve said. His voice was tight and rushed, each syllable coming out clipped and uneven. “You don’t have to reciprocate— That is, I mean to say, I don’t expect you to— I’m trying to— to get over it,” Steve said wretchedly. “I’m trying, I swear I am—”
Tony didn’t know. He really, really didn’t. He was just sick of waiting and wanting and never being able to—
“That I’m a terrible boyfriend,” Tony says quietly, desperately, hands curling into fists, nails digging into his palms. He knows that. Pepper deserves better. Why would Steve point that out? Tony
Tony snarled, and there must have been something in his voice, some kind of panic, because Steve complied immediately, backing away. There was fear on his face, blanched and grey, and in his words: “Tony? Are you— Did I—”
Tony had smirked, and quietly enjoyed the way Steve swallowed, like his throat had gone dry. He leaned down, brushed an almost gentle kiss to the corner of an eye. “Let's find out.”
“Not you,” Steve said, hoarse, raw, each word coming out like it was drawing blood from his throat. “I can't
Why, unless… unless he isn’t. Embarrassment can look an awful lot like rage, sometimes, can’t it? And— And—
“There’s a dance I don’t want to miss,” he says, almost to himself, setting the highball glass on the bartop, and winding his way through the crowd.
So maybe it was a good thing, that in the next second, Steve had wrenched himself away, practically thrown himself backwards, a flat, horrified look on his face.
Put that way, it does seem… unbelievably arrogant. Oh jeez. “I didn’t mean to— to presume. It was just that, I heard you didn’t ask her to move in, and we had had that, uh, conversation that day—”
But he goes to Steve’s recently emptied apartment first, wanders the rooms. It's not like the space is empty; the furniture came with. Tony wanders the space quietly. He feels like a ghost.
Tony was quiet, because of course Tony was quiet. His head wasn’t working right. And it was into that silence that Steve said, “Anyway. That’s what I — if it seemed like I disapproved, it was because I…”
“If it’s alright with you,” Steve said, breaking that awful silence, “I would really like to move in.” Tony’s gaze whipped up to meet his. Steve let the corner of his mouth quirk into a grin. “I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but this place is kind of a dump.”
“Yes,” Jarvis continues. “Therefrom, it was reasonable to predict that you would pursue Captain Rogers, once your bisexuality was public. And considering his own fluid preferences in partners—”
“Yeah.” Tony was beginning to smile now, if only because Steve looked like he’d been struck by a stray bolt of lightning. “Guess what.”
“You have to get cartons,” Steve goes on relentlessly. He’s put on his workout clothes and headed to the sandbags, all of which makes it a lot easier to get mad at him again.
Tony! Senator Vinnick’s an important guy, how do you think he’s gonna feel that you pulled me away so we could
“You’re only just figuring this out?” Tony managed. He sounded a little breathless but that couldn’t be helped —
Steve grins. “Oh no you don’t,” he says, and kisses Tony again, one of those fond, quick kisses, like sips of honey, and Tony’s fast, he’s got
Tony tossed another spoon at him, with extreme prejudice. Bullshit, he was whipped. He wasn’t even getting laid.
The shirt comes off first, button by button, a slow tease, revealing the pale, smooth lines of his chest inch by torturous inch, and oh
“This guy givin’ you a hard time, Senator?” Tony asks Arnie lightly, sliding his palm to rest at the small of Steve’s back. “You want I should boot him out for ya?”
Jesus Christ, no wonder he was so cranky all the damn time. Tony would be too, if he was that pent up.
Tony scowls at him. That's unfair, that is. How are you supposed to say no to that face? “You're supposed to use your powers for good, not evil,” Tony complains, and Steve twinkles at him, the bastard.
Tony shakes his head. Laughs softly. He can barely hear it, over the roar of the sea, of his heartbeat. “You know, sometimes… sometimes, Jarvis, you really are…. very sweet.”
“Just got Manchin to side with us on HR 431. Next week is going to be…” She whistles, cheeky and bold, and Tony tips his G&T in her direction before taking a sip.
Again, he did it, with excruciating slowness, and Steve made another mindless, guttural sound, and again, and again, and Steve’s hips jolted right off the bed, suspending Tony on nothing, impaled on the bruising length of his cock. Tony whimpered, shivering with a white hot rush of pleasure, and then Steve began
“Oh,” Steve said, grinning wryly, palms stroking his sides, feeling the rapid rise and fall of his chest, the thunder of his heartbeat. Son of a bitch wasn't even out of breath.
Steve glanced, questioning, at Tony's cock, saturated a dark red now, the head a dusky purple, velvety and wet and Steve wanted to
he never managed to say, because that was enough time for Tony to grasp his nape and pull him down, to turn him over so the ridge of his cock was rubbing against Tony’s hole, wet and open, loose from all of Steve’s hard work.
“I’m just saying.” Tony shrugged. “I talk a lot of shit. You might hate me. In which case, not moving in is totally understandab—”
So maybe that's why: the downrush after the adrenaline, the warmth of the coffee, the lingering warmth from the alcohol. Maybe it's because of the memory of the cold that they’ve all been trying to banish. Maybe that edge of fear that Tony's carried deep underneath the pulsing blue core of the arc reactor, ever since Afghanistan:
Tony turned to his right, saw Steve entering the corridor. There were two flutes of champagne in his hands. He was very still.
,” Tony says harshly. “No more. You shouldn’t— I shouldn’t find out from— If anyone tells me about that, it should be
The thing is, people fall for billionaires pretty easily, and that's the sad truth, and Tony knows he’s decent looking, and pretty smooth to bat; there's not a whole lot of people who can withstand that sort of charm offensive, but clearly the Avengers are immune.
Tony grinned back. Just a little, but it felt like someone had reached a hand between his ribs and into the soft, vulnerable parts underneath, and squeezed.
And it worked. Of course it worked. Tony burned off the caffeine high with tequila and flaming vodka shots that someone else bought him—and wasn't that a crime?
His hand is gripping Tony’s shoulder even tighter. His hair is falling into his face. And all that lovely concern…
A delighted smile flickered onto his face, making him look several years younger. “That was for me?” He asks, like a little boy who just had an entire chocolate bunny dumped into his Halloween candy haul.
sleep, deep and thoroughly restful, and you climbed out of unhurriedly, like swimming through a warm, clouded lake, unwilling to let go of the last dregs of peace. He shifted in his bed, blinking languorously. The room was filled with a dull, golden glow, like it was mid-afternoon, and there was, Tony could now hear, somebody else in bed with him, a hard, long body against his, a thickly muscled arm thrown over his chest. Tony turned into that glorious heat, his palm finding warm silken skin, palm skating down a long golden back.
“You're up,” the other man murmured, and that’s when Tony finally took notice because— because, even low and sleep-fuzzled— god, that voice was terribly familiar, wasn’t it?
“And I’m not under the impression that homophobia is the sole province of heterosexuals, there’s plenty of self-hatred to go around when the whole world wants to tell you you’re fucked up, but I’m—”
, Tony found himself curled up pathetically on a couch while the latest party wound down around them — Sif was in town with a contingent from the Asgardian Royal Army, they had defeated a Jabberwocky thingamajig in Bali Hai, apparently Asgardian custom demanded a feast after a victory blah di blah blah shoot him now.
Steve is easy to find, a golden head just above most of the crowd. He’s arguing with Senator Vinnick because that’s what those two idiots always do, and Arnie’s got that same indulgent smile on his face that Tony’s seen him wear around his grandkids.
Jarvis pauses. Cocks his head to the side. He looks so alarmingly like Tony in that second, it catches him right in the chest. If he ever had kids, Tony starts to think, and then stamps that thought down with extreme prejudice. “Perhaps,” Jarvis allows slowly. “I did not extrapolate purely from your single line statement. I hypothesized you wanted to come out because of an instigating factor. From there, it was easy to determine that Captain Rogers had captured your… interest.”
“Narcissist. So you voluntarily didn’t sleep with… triplets?” Bruce sounded deeply skeptical, which was fair. Tony also felt deeply skeptical about the state of his sanity.
so Tony paused, thought about it, and then said, “Because Steve looked sad.” God in Heaven, what was wrong with his brain.
“I don’t want to… to get in the middle of whatever you two have going on. Ordinary jealous exes are bad enough, darling — I’m not mad enough to think I could take on the Captain.”
“Why him. That’s all I want to know, and then I won’t— I’ll leave this be, I swear to god. Just— why him.”
In the beginning, Steve had been playful, sparkling with mirth, kissing Tony sweetly, arching into his touch, a slow delicious grind through their pants, like they were teenagers making out in the secret quiet.
get here?” Tony shot back reflexively, but instead of the disapproving frown he’d come to expect, Steve rolled his eyes, smiled a little. His hand touched Tony’s cheek. Rubbed a spot just below his mouth. “I missed you,” Steve whispered, and then he was dipping downwards, brushing their lips together, before, Jesus god, before pulling away.
romantic, you ungrateful asswipe, will you do me the incredible honor of going to dinner with me, holy
. I’m about as straight as a crazy straw, this isn’t homophobia, this is what having a functional grasp on
He must have made some kind of sound, something desperate and needy and pitched, the kind of sound you made just before you said,
His hands were fisted in the sheets, and there were slow rips opening up in the thousand-count Egyptian cotton. Which is why those hands were not on Tony's hips, because, they both knew, he wasn't entirely sure he would be able to hold back, be able to not harm Tony, not crush his bones to powder, he was so desperate to come.
“That’s a little homophobic,” Amanda said, frowning, and Tony manfully resisted the urge to hit something.
Tony pressed the electrodes to his temples, sat down in the custom built chair that formed the central unit of the device. Pulled the padded straps over his chest, felt the large, hemispherical top of the machine descend over his head, so the rim was just level with his mouth, almost totally obscuring his peripheral vision. He felt the hum of the machine build around him, a barely perceptible vibration, felt it groan and tremble and grow steadily louder.
It’s fun. Really fun. They heckle the Nazis, boo the prison camp officers, polish off three bowls of popcorn before Jarvis has the kitchens send up platefuls of sandwiches. BLTs, Tony tries not to notice. Tony sniffles a little at the end, while Steve turns completely distraught.
Tony woke up slowly. It was one of those rare moments, when you knew you were mostly asleep, but it had been a
“Well, you’re young, I’m in love,” Tony says blithely, smile firmly in place, though his heart, god, the way it’s pounding. He’s never said this before, never, not even to himself, but
But then Steve leans closer, and their mouths brush together. There’s salt on his lips, buttery glaze from the popcorn. Tony groans into it, licks away the taste, until it’s all Steve, only Steve. When he pulls away, their lips cling together, and Tony can barely breathe past the ache in his chest, all the way sunk into his bones. He shivers.
“He will,” Jarvis says, with perfect conviction. “He would. No one you have ever pursued has turned you down. If you wanted him, you would have him.”
He imagined it, before. He had, in excruciating detail. And when that hadn’t been enough, he built a billion dollar machine to imagine it for him. To make it so real it had crashed the Greater New York Metropolitan Area’s energy grid, and nearly fried his brains. In every way, in every shape, he had dreamed it and wanted it — he had
“Don't you dare,” Tony growled, his voice low and heavy. There were lines of sweat trickling down his back, making his hair wet, dripping over his forehead, into his eyes, trickling opalescent over the reactor.
That was the thing: for the first, delirious few seconds, Steve had surged into Tony's body, had dropped his mug with an unheard crash, and knocked him into the counter
He stops short at the door to Tony’s lab. He can hear music pounding through the glass. “The boss okay for a visit, JARVIS?” Steve asks at the door. He has he access code, of course, but Steve was taught to knock before entering, and this seems like the next best thing.
Tony smiled wickedly, and kissed him again, soft this time, on the corner of his kiss-bitten mouth. “A date?” he asked. The movement made their hips grind together, and Steve’s hand turned vice-like on his waist.
Steve laughed meanly. “I don’t know,” he said , bitterness in every word. “Christ, I really don’t know. Can I just ask—”
“So trust me,” Tony said urgently, bright golden hope flaring like a starburst inside him, like ignition fluid catching spark. “Trust me. I’m a selfish bastard, Rogers. I’d never let you do anything that’d hurt me.”
“Well, of course it was in your head, sir.” Jarvis’ voice is fading, coming from far, far away. “But why on earth should that mean it can’t ever
Tony stiffened. Someone screamed. He turned around carefully, and found his mystery dance partner being choked, a hand around his throat, his shoes a foot off the ground and it was
Tony slants her a happy grin. “A glass of white for the lady,” he says to the bartender, before turning back to her. “You havin’ a good time?”
The Hyatt Regency Malibu abuts a sheer, limestone cliff: rooms on the seaside have plate glass windows that don’t open, and a gorgeous view for which you have pay 150% extra. Most people do. The sea is stunning, even at night. Tony watches the sea, watches a tiny wave break white foam over the water. Watches the spot. Six seconds later, it breaks again.
and Tony’s neck felt unbearably hot, when realization struck him like a lightning bolt: “You thought I wouldn’t
, Banner,” he sneered. “I’m sure you have no concept of it, but people actually want to fuck me.” He thought about the Chrises. “A lot.”
“While the place was under construction, sure. She was surprising the build and stuff. It’s her money, innit?”
Tony smiles, and pulls him in, for another quiet, yearning kiss. It ain’t bad, he thinks, this love business. And the future looks wonderful.
He comes out of it slowly. By then Steve’s already cleaned them out with a handful of Kleenex, and he’s splayed out on his belly next to Tony, carding his fingers through dark, sweat-damp hair.
Steve rolls his eyes. “Yeah, okay. No dragons tonight either, Tony. C’mon,” he says, hustling them towards the car, “get in. I’m not driving that deathtrap of yours.”
“Oh,” Tony said weakly. “Well, good.” He paused. “Hang on a minute, then why haven’t you moved in?!”
“You know they all think you hate me, right?” Tony demanded. “Like, they think I insulted your mother’s honor or something, and now you won’t—” He paused. “Wait, did I? I didn’t mean to. I meant to insult
How long has he been staring? “Tony,” Steve manages. Wow, maybe the scotch hadn’t been the excellent-est idea, huh? “I thought we should talk.”
Steve falters, his next punch so vicious it smashes a cavity right through the sandbag. “That's not true,” he snarls back.
He covered the distance between them into two, impatient strides, a hand foster at Tony's nape with almost cruel, ruthless pressure.
Tony's version of hell. This is like sending an addict into a crackhouse. Not that Steve is cocaine. Or that Tony is addicted to him. Because that would be—haha, what. “Look,” Tony says, sinking down onto a bench, “I'm planning to ask her to move in with me. Into the tower.”
He hissed, involuntary, and that seemed to spur Steve further, his slow smile widening dangerously, still sloe-eyed, hazy.
Hey, where had Steve gone to? Tony wondered, muzzily. The whole world had acquired a soft glittery golden glow, and when Bruce laughed at the mayor’s joke, Tony could feel the vibration of it rumble through his chest.
“Okay! Fine! It was more than once, god, you don't have to be—” Steve is down to his underwear and socks. This is hell. This is
like me,” Steve murmured to himself. His hand had found Tony’s waist, had somehow managed to ruck up his shirt, and now his thumb was tracing slow lazy circles just above the waistline of his trousers.
huh?” Pepper says, breathless, when she comes to find him at the bar. Her hair is wispy from dancing, and her cheeks are prettily flushed.
“Sorry,” Tony said, trying to dredge up his party smile. It was shockingly hard to find. “Some new intel came in on— Well, I actually can’t tell you on whom—”
Steve drops his forehead against Tony’s, and for just a moment, they breathe. The machine hadn’t been able to imagine
“Bruce said you were having a nervous breakdown last week, so I figured… what’s it this time? You two breaking up again?”
Steve's words were practically branded into his mind, a field of fire and ash. “Not me.” He barked a caustic laugh. “Of course. Captain America's gotta have standards.”
that was such a great ass — and then threaded his way through the crowd to where Steve was sat, all by himself.
“Don't worry about it,” Steve says, and his voice is normal now, steady and even-keeled, like nothing out of the last fifteen minutes just happened. “I’ll be out of your hair by tomorrow evening. Sorry about this, by the way,” he adds, gesturing to the sandbag.
Steve arches a disbelieving eyebrow. “Are we not counting the time you guys stopped talking after the kraken incident? And the time she took Rhodey as her date for the Black and Pink Ball? And the time—”
Bucky choked on the brioche he was eating, prompting Steve to give him a very hard slap on the back.
“I’m sorry. There isn’t. Your memories are still there, Captain”, Strange said, turning back to Steve, “but there is a powerful spell preventing you from accessing them. I do not have the means to break this spell right now, but I will do some research with Wong. I’m sure we will find something soon”.
“You remember this one, right? It’s a shame the government didn’t approve of this; such a useful little thing”.
and smiled awkwardly at Steve as the blond pulled the chair for him. They sat down at the table outside and the mechanic took a moment to admire the beautiful view they had of the city before accepting a menu from the hostess.
“We met at the army”, Natasha told him after, sipping her drink, “He was my Captain and one of the few men who didn’t treat me like I didn’t belong there”.
“You know, Stevie, I always knew you were a huge prick, but you didn’t have to take it out on Tony”.
“Why the ever loving fuck not? Are you embarrassed of us or something?”, Bucky asked, feigning offense.
But Steve wasn’t listening. He was too busy staring at the engineer’s stomach with absolute fascination.
The island looked almost abandoned, which was weird considering it was a still active military base. From their position at the beach, they could see a radio tower far ahead and, on their left, a long staircase with a big building at its end.
He smiled. They had exchanged phone numbers that night after the hospital and ever since then they’d talked pretty much every day. From their childhoods to their favorite TV shows, they discussed everything and anything, as if they’d been friends their entire lives.
“Did you hear what he said as well?” Steve inquired, crossing his arms, “He basically said she spared them because they didn’t know. Didn’t know what?”
“Uh, it’s Pe… Eldrin. My name is Eldrin”, he introduced himself with a nod, “Listen, Quill, I have some friends over there, on top of that hill, and we’re here to free you and all the other animals. But we need your help! If I get you out of this cage, can you attack the goblins?”
“My dear boy”, Jarvis said with a smile, “He chose you every time he came over to watch, yet again, those silly space movies you love so much. He chose you every time he comforted you after a fight with your father. He chose you when he introduced you to his mother, his only family in this world, as his boyfriend. He chose you when he gave up a scholarship at another school only because he could not bear to be parted from you”.
The Strategic Homeland Intervention and Enforcement Logistics Division, also known as SHIELD, was a secret organization. In fact, they were so secret that most agents, even the ones with a high level clearance, didn’t know who they worked for. Steve and Bucky were both Level 7 in the scale, being outranked only by their handler, Agent Coulson, Commander Hill and Deputy Director Fury. SHIELD believed in compartmentalizing every piece of information.
Tony looked away for a second, deep in thought. On one hand, Steve did seem like a great guy. On the other, the mechanic had been very wrong about this sort of thing before. He looked into Steve’s eyes and, for a moment, all he saw was sincerity and affection. And in that moment he made his decision. He stood on his toes, putting his hands on Steve’s neck and pulling him down for a kiss. The blond wasted no time, pressing the smaller man against the door as they kissed.
Suddenly, “The Way You Look Tonight” came on and Tony felt like crying. He took a deep breath and swallowed the tears that threatened to fall while Thor swayed him from one side to the other.
“Oh. So, yeah, I… I do like Bonnie, a lot. But, hey, the serum fixed a lot of things, but my awkwardness in dates was not one of them”, he said, smiling sadly.
“Wow. Well, you need to really think about this, Steve. You don’t want to make a mistake and have to live with it for the rest of your life”.
So Tony approached him carefully. He’d learned the hard way to never assume a guy was, well, interested in guys. Straight men could be real dick heads about getting hit on by another man. So he introduced himself with a smile, asked for Steve’s name, which he promptly gave, and they started talking. As the party went on, they talked about everything… college, parents, favorite movies, favorite food, how cool is the new Star Wars movie, and on and on. At one point, Tony asked if Steve was interested in going somewhere private. They ended up in Steve’s apartment, with a very satisfied Tony being thoroughly fucked against a wall.
As he walked, he replayed the whole scene in his head. He couldn’t understand it. He’d been so sure Connie was going to say yes; so sure. He could feel the tears filling his eyes again, but he took a deep breath and refused to let them fall. He was heartbroken, yes, and confused and angry at himself and miserable, but he was definitely NOT going to start crying in the middle of a Walmart. No way.
Both agents walked inside her office and sat down in front of her. The Director, however, remained standing, walking from one side of the room to the other, hands clasped behind her back as she did so.
“Go”, Sam nodded, turning back to Stone as Steve and Coulson left the bathroom, “Answer the question. What do you mean by that?”
Jarvis and Ana watched, in silence, as he ate some toast and drank some coffee. He could tell they wanted to say something, but were holding themselves back.
Steve knew he was in trouble as soon as he walked inside and saw Tony in his Armani suit, looking positively delectable. He actually stopped walking and just stared at the billionaire, his mouth hanging open, until Bucky cleared his throat to call for his attention. Embarrassed, he murmured a
“I don’t need to fuck you to help you out, Tony…” Steve whispered, pulling his pants down a bit and mouthing his cock through his underwear, “Just relax, sweetheart”.
Tony had had enough. With tears now streaming down his face, he got up and ran. He heard Steve shouting his name, but he didn’t stop. He was already outside of the cafeteria when he felt a hand stopping him, holding him back.
“I asked around, Mr. Stark. There are no official documents regarding the shipment of weapons to those parts, but…”
With that, he got up, putting the arc reactor inside the small suitcase and closing it. He took one last look at his godson and smiled before leaving the house, and Tony, behind.
The corridor of fourth floor was almost empty, save from two agents who were standing guard in front of interrogation room 2. Natasha marched to them, her face completely void of any emotion. She reconigzed them as soon as they turned their heads in her direction; she'd trained them a while ago. It would be easy to scare them into letting her in.
”, he said the last word in a mocking tone, “he just wants me to meet his boyfriend. So I said I’d bring you”.
Steve was pacing in the waiting room. He’d never been this worried in his entire life. Well, that wasn’t strictly true. He’d been pretty worried when Bucky and Sam – those dumbasses –  had tried to put up Christmas lights while drunk… in February. Dumbasses. He shook his head, trying to clear his head, and looked over at the corridor again, hoping to see the doctor or the very helpful nurse who had taken Tony away in a wheelchair, but there was no one there. With yet another sigh, he averted his eyes and started pacing again.
Natasha huffed, biting her lip. “Tell you what, Anthony. You tell me something and I tell you something, how’s that?”
But he couldn’t think like that, couldn’t dwell on his hatred for the sand and the damn heat and the stupid cold. No, he couldn’t dwell on that because today was a special day. Today, whatever day it was, was the day Tony finally gave in and promised Abu Bakaar that he would build them the Jericho. Of course, he had absolutely no intention whatsoever to give the most dangerous terrorist group on this side of the planet a special missile that could destroy an entire city in less than minutes. No, sir. He had a much better idea. He was going to burn all of them, burn the entire war camp to the ground, and then Yinsen and he would step on their ashes as they walked to freedom. That’s what he was going to do.
“That’s what we thought was happening today. Actually, that’s what Tony thought was happening today”.
“Trust me, it’s hilarious”, Steve replied, opening the car door for him and helping Tony get inside, “Come on, I’ll drive you home”.
