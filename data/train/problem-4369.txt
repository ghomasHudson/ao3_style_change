He takes his time driving back to town. He takes in the trees and water. He looks up at the sky a few times to watch the birds fly overhead. He can’t stop himself from feeling better and better as he makes his way back to his apartment, but there’s also the feeling of dread. How is he going to get through this? The last time he had to talk about his past he could barely get it out. His panic attack was almost immediate and lasted an hour. He texts Charlie when he’s a few minutes away to give her a heads up that he’s nearly there and had gotten her messages.
“Sammy?” Dean says and gives his brother a little shake. Sam sits up and the papers and book go flying in all different directions.
“Shower?” Dean suggests and they both run to the bathroom laughing and grabbing at eachother. The shower doesn’t do anything except get them all riled up again. Shower blowjobs with Cas are probably Dean’s favorite thing in the world now. After both boys are mostly clean they make their way back to Dean’s bed, but not before Cas forces Dean to change the sheets.
Dean pulls himself up onto his knees and slides himself over to the kid. His face is sickly white and his lips are blue. He carefully takes the boys chin in his hands and tips his head back to open up his airway. His dad blows one long breath into the boy and starts the compressions again. He tries his best not to be scared.
“I don’t care about your past,” Cas says. Dean notices Charlie’s reaction next to him. She looks like she’s about to cry. She looks like she wants to say something, but she doesn’t.
He takes a deep breath and opens the envelope, pulling out all the papers in one grab. They feel heavy in his hands. On the top of the stack is a hand written letter.
His dad doesn’t answer. He stands his back to Dean near the kitchen sink. He can see that his father is holding something else, but he’s not sure what it is. Dean takes a few steps into the kitchen and pulls out the coffee and some mugs. He might as well start his day. The Impala needs an oil change.
He turns on the shower and sits on the toilet waiting for the water to warm up. He lets his mind wander,
“I only went a few times until I couldn’t anymore. I couldn’t take it and Dean and his brother kinda took me in and we just left. Dean used to be different. He’s not this...what’s happening right now isn’t normal. This isn’t Dean. I know what it looks like. I know that it looks like I’m trying to fix him, but I know that I can’t. I know that nothing I do or say can make him better. He has to want to get better on his own. But I can’t just let him go. I can’t stop loving him or wanting to be there for him when he gets like this. He’s come so far, Gabe and if I leave him now, I’ll never see him again.”
This is new. It’s new and exciting and terrifying because I don’t know what it means. I want to believe that this is the real Cas, but I can’t help but feel like it’s the effect of the drugs. It has to be.
The next day, Dean’s shift ends. He showers as fast as he can and is out of the yard before anyone can say anything to him or question him about why he's in such a hurry. He drives downtown and parks his car in a park and ride and walks the three blocks to where the blue-eyed man usually hangs out. He carries an old backpack on his back with the gloves, a sandwich, some apples and oranges, and a few bottles of water. He also stuffed a burger and fries in there too. He rounds the corner into the alley and sees the man sitting there wrapped up in a dirty trench coat. He’s asleep and Dean can’t help but feel instant relief that the man looks unharmed.
Benny nods at the man as the realization of what he is washes over him. He knows that he should be running or at least trying to get answers but he feels stuck. Like there is a weight on him that’s preventing him from speaking or moving. The man carefully walks towards him and places the small bottle on the ground about a few feet from where he’s leaning against the tree.
Cas starts dinner and watches the garage door from the window. He smiles at the memory of Dean being absolutely sure that the garage can be off the house if they have a decent sized yard. It’s a few minutes before dinner is ready when the door finally opens and Dean emerges. He’s filthy from head to toe and Cas has never been more turned on. He audibly gasps at the sight of his future walking towards the house.
“I think we’re getting close,” Dean days, dropping the wood near Cas’ feet. Cas hums in agreement and turns to leave. Dean stares after him with a confused look on his face. He turns to Benny as if to ask what’s going on but Benny just shrugs and also walks away leaving Dean alone.
“Thank you, Charlie,” Dean says and walks over to talk with her in the kitchen. Cas stands there in awe of the man he loves. In the past, Dean would have totally shut down and ignored her comment. He would have rather talked about his failed conversion therapy than his mother. This was big. This was monumental and Cas isn’t sure he can deal. He watches the two as they share a short hug. Dean looks up and Cas and his face changes to something a little darker. It’s there and then it’s gone.
Seattle is next. He loves it. It’s beautiful and green and makes him feel like he’s finally found a place that he might be able to call home. He works at a bar and saves up money to fix up the Impala. She’s still beautiful, but he’d like to upgrade the engine and have the seats redone. He meets a girl named Cassie. She’s beautiful and smart and strong, but they don’t last long after he comes clean about his past. He’s not sure if they don’t make their year long relationship work because of his past or because she’s scared of him. He leaves her but he keeps Washington.
He waits a moment before stepping into the shower. The hot water on his tired, achy muscles is calming in ways that Dean will never be able to explain. The shower is what he needs and feels much better once he gets out and starts to towel off. He catches sight of himself in the mirror and his eyes rest on the scar taking up a large portion of his right shoulder. It has healed a lot since the last time he saw it.
"What had you upset earlier?" Dean asks. Cas takes a moment to think about what he wants to say before he says it.
Whatever is behind him is getting closer and closer. Whatever it is it isn’t human. Its snarling and growling sends panic and fear shooting down Dean’s spine. He turns around just in time to see a leviathan loose it’s head. He glances to the left and see’s Benny standing there with the thing’s head in his hand, thick black goo dripping from the fresh cut.
Sunday feels conflicted. He loves Cas. Cas is leaving. His bags is all packed and it’s sitting next to the front door. Sam is working on his homework at the kitchen table and Dean and Cas and laying on the couch trying to prolong the inevitable. If Cas doesn’t leave soon he won’t be home until it’s dark.
“You’re looking for the angel. I know where he is,” Dean slowly turns around to face the man, makeshift knife in hand.
Cas sniffles and a few tears find their way down his cheeks. Dean moves his hand to Cas’s shoulder and gives it a reassuring squeeze. Cas covers Dean’s hand with his own.
“Come on, Dean. Fuck me.” He says. I can still feel the drugs in my veins and I flip us over so I’m on top of him. I can’t be sure, but I think he just actually whimpered.
“Yeah, dudes. I needed a break from work. Numbers, numbers, numbers all day every day. I’m over it. I knocked, the door was unlocked.” She looks down at their hands intertwined, “Did I interrupt?”
I lean back on my heels and look around the bed for the lube Cas usually has laying around. I find it and open the cap. Cas lets out a low groan and I don’t know if I can do this anymore. I don’t know if I’m going to be able to last. He looks too good under me.
It had been a long time since they had done anything sexual and Cas been aware of that fact for the last few weeks but isn’t pushing the issue. He had an appointment with Ava about this very thing. She told him to let Dean come to him and it’s been bearable. They make out and sometimes dry hump, but Dean always stops before anything else can happen.
“How did you find me?” Cas’ eyes don’t leave Benny and it leaves Dean feeling unsettled. Dean stepped in front of Benny forcing Cas to look at him.
Thank you all so much for the support. I don't know what else to say. I feel so happy and honored to be writing this for you all who are enjoying it!
“I’m done waiting for him to come around,” Dean slams the book he’s holding down on the table in front of sam and leaves the library before he can talk himself out of what he’s about to do. Dean paces in front of Cas’ door a few times before knocking. There is no answer and he knows the longer he just stands there the more he’ll chicken out. He places a hand on the door handle and slowly turns it. He steps inside the darkness and closes the door behind him to let his eyes adjust. He take a few steps towards the light switch.
“This place, Dean. It’s not...it’s not right here. Everything is wrong. I do not doubt our bond or our friendship,” Cas’ words wrap around Dean’s throat and squeeze. He’s not good enough. He should have known that he wasn’t good enough.
“Dean?” Cas pokes his head in the doorway of Dean’s room, causing Dean to stop pacing and look at Cas for the first time in a few days, “I was going to make a trip to the store..but I’m...I’m not myself. Would you take me?”
Dean stops what he’s doing. He can feel his jaw clenching in anger. It isn’t fair. Cas shouldn’t have done this. He shouldn’t have tried to save him again. No matter what, in the end, Dean only has himself.  If he’s not enough for Cas or Sam how can he be enough for himself?
“I went to see Dean while he was in the hospital and I told him something that wasn’t true. I lied to him to help him and if I were to tell him the truth now it would ruin him,” She turns around and faces Sam. There are already tears in her eyes and a few are running down her cheeks.
“Hello, Dean,” Dean isn’t sure who reaches out to who first, but being in Cas’s arms is like being in heaven. He can’t help but breathe the other man in. Being in Cas’s arms is like coming home after a long day of work. He doesn’t even hide the fact that he can’t hold his tears in. They stay like that for a few moments before Charlie comes out and clears her throat.
“Hey, no need to apologize. I brought you some stuff yesterday and you weren’t here. Kinda freaked me out, man. It’s getting colder out here,” Dean stands and his eyes land on the man's face. He looks awful. He could use a shower and a shave. Maybe some food.
Crowley is interesting. He’s charming, but there is something about him that’s downright terrifying. Dean meets with him at seven and they take a short drive to one of the local shops in town. It’s a small cake shop that opened a year ago. Dean remembers he and Sam went to the grand opening at Dean was upset there was no pie.
“They took me to conversion therapy. They said that I was broken. I went because I didn’t want to disappoint them. I didn’t want to lose you or Anna. They made me think that there was something wrong with me and I gave in. I went.”
The sun is beating down on Dean’s face and chest and he’s starting to feel too warm. He sits up and rolls onto his stomach. Once he’s comfortable again he hears an excited gasp from Cas next to him and he smiles to himself.
It isn’t that he wants to ignore Cas, in fact, he wants to do the exact opposite. It’s the fact that if he starts talking to him, or to anyone for that matter, he would have to say and remember things he doesn’t want to think about. Things he’s not ready to admit to or try to explain to anyone because he barely understands them himself.
“No, I haven’t told him yet. I don’t think now is the best time,” she says. Sam takes a quiet step back around the corner out of sight. What hasn’t she told him? He hears her laugh and tell whoever she’s talking to goodbye. He waits a few moments before walking into the kitchen to say hello.
“I just- I get so angry. Why did we get dealt these cards? We were just kids when mom died and dad...he just lost it. He just became so obsessed with that bat shit crazy church and their archaic and backward ideology. Are you ever just angry?” He finally looks Dean in the eye. It’s almost like he’s begging Dean to answer. Like, he needs Dean to assure him that what he’s feeling is okay.
Dean’s stomach twists in ways he didn’t know it could and his chest tightens so tight he thinks it might explode.
I am so sorry for not updating for so long. It's been a crazy few months. But, I'm back and I'm determined to finish this damn thing! Thank you for sticking around and I'll do my best to keep this little guy going. Also, I have posted a few more fics for your reading enjoyment...so, please feel free to take a look! :)
“Yes, ma'am,” Benny replies and starts trimming the ends of her hair. Dean watches as Benny moves. He’s like a samurai with scissors. Dean thinks maybe he should let Benny cut his hair and give him a shave. Not here, but later when he has another day off because he’s starting to look like a lumberjack and not in a good way.
He finishes his pie and a few cups of coffee. He looks down at his phone and he’s been there for close to thirty minutes. Only one couple has come in since he arrived and no one else looks like they are waiting for him. The waitress watches him from where she stands and then walks over carrying a small white box. She sets it down on the table and before he can say anything she starts talking.
“Did you know about this?” Cas asks. His words cut deep and leave Dean feeling light headed. Charlie’s eyes find Dean’s and she looks much the same as Cas did. Afraid. Angry. Disappointed.
“I’ll get you some. I’ll get you all the water in damn the world. Alright, buddy?” Dean’s not sure why Gabe is so happy or why there are tears coming from his eyes, but there are.
Sam left for school with a fat wallet and an even fatter savings account. Dean didn’t tell him that he had nearly a quarter million dollars saved up for Sam and himself. Dean had just simply told him not to worry about anything and he would give him money as he needed. Dean watched Sam’s spending and sent him three hundred a week. Sam still got a part time job and saved most of what Dean sent him. The largest purchases he made were books and computer programs.
“Did you like it? On C Street. Did you like what you had to do?” Dean knew questions were coming, but he didn’t expect that one. He knows honesty is the best policy, but he wants to lie right now.
“Cas, I’m going out to dinner with a friend. Do you want me to bring you anything back?” Cas eyes him suspiciously and shakes his head. Dean doesn’t let his gaze linger too long. “I should be back around eleven.”
He stays with Andy for a while. It’s comfortable. Andy is kind and thoughtful. He makes Dean’s meals. He covers him with extra blankets and sometimes they kiss. It never goes past that though and Dean’s pretty sure that it has something to do with what happened on C Street. He doesn’t mention it, though. He and Andy become close. Gabe comes by every once and awhile to check in. He never comes when Andy is home and it makes Dean a little sad because he knows that they would be great friends.
“You have her fucking eyes and you’re fucking disgusting. I can’t even look at you. You’re pathetic. I didn’t raise you like this, you fucking faggot.” A kick to the ribs leaves Dean in tears sobbing. He still can’t move. He can’t speak. He just takes it. This is what he deserves. Things get blurry after that. He knows that his father is hitting him, but he can’t seem to make his arms and legs move. He can feel every punch and every kick. He can taste the blood and he accepts that this is where he’s going to die.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs, looking at Sam as if he could will him to understand. Sam takes a small step back looking confused, hurt, and then angry all in a matter of seconds. His eyes are searching Dean’s face for any kind of explanation.
“Castiel? Nah, Sammy. Cas is cool.” Dean responds and goes back to cooking. Dean decides if Cas is a faggot, he doesn’t care.
“Cas, you stupid son of a bitch. I fucking fought for you. I killed for you,” He rolls over onto his stomach and lets the tears he had been holding back for so long run freely into the blanket below him. He slowly lets the wall down and pain seeps in. He lets it consume him. He doesn’t care who can hears him. He’s lets it all out. He sobs, cries, and screams into the musty mattress under him.
“Scoot back,” He says as he pulls the rest of his clothes off. His body in front of me is like something out of a magazine. He’s perfect. I slide back to towards the middle of the bed and let my body relax into the soft bedding underneath me while I watch him stroke his dick a few times. He throws his head back and lets out a long low moan. My own dick twitches in response. He looks down at me with a look I’ve never seen on his face before.
Dean barely has time to move before his father’s hand is hitting him in the face. Dean hits the ground hard. He can’t move. He can’t make his body move. He can’t make himself get out of the way of what he knows is coming. Maybe he does deserve this. Maybe Gabe was wrong. Maybe there isn’t hope.
Things are going to kinda shift and move a little quicker now. Thank you for reading. I appreciate it a lot. :) If you have any questions please ask!
Dean walks down the hallway to the lobby of the police station. He can see Cas sitting twenty feet from him. He’s leaning forward with his elbows on his knees. His eyes are downcast. Dean stops and stares for a moment. It takes him longer than it should to realize that Cas is praying. He’s praying hard. He’s so caught up in it he doesn’t look up until Dean touches his shoulder. There are tears in his eyes. He jumps up and wraps his arms around Dean so tightly Dean can barely breathe.
Next, was page after page of typed text. Most of the pages have been blacked out and there are notes written in the margins. Phone numbers, addresses, and states. He skimmed the parts he was able to read, but one part stuck out the most:
“No, no. I’m nothing like them,” Dean turns to the guy and sighs, “Look, when I was down on my luck, no one really cared what happened to me. You weren’t here yesterday and I...I just wanted to make sure you’re alright.”
Cas comes quickly after that. Leaving teeth marks on Dean’s collarbone. Dean collapses on top of Cas and they lay for for a few minutes catching their breaths and kissing lazily.
“Yes, Sir,” Dean replies and looks to Sammy who’s still clinging to the pole at the end of the dock.
“I should have tried Benny first. I’m so sorry.” He looks so small and so broken and it’s starting to make Dean feel uncomfortable. It’s bringing up things he doesn’t want to think about. He hadn’t actually been in a hospital room in years. He didn’t like they way they smelled. Everything was too clean.
“Well, what kind of stuff do you like?” Again, a simple question. What does he like? What is he even good at? Cars. He was good at fixing up cars and he likes trying new beers and cooking and he might like being outdoors, but he has yet to test that theory.
Dean whips around and looks at the angel with disbelief. He feels sick. Cas had left him on purpose? “You what?”
Dean is so deep in his self pity he almost misses the fact that his cell phone has been ringing. He drags himself out of bed and stares at the screen. It’s Sam. He wants to answer but his fingers are already moving to ignore the call. He sets the phone down and stares at it.
Dean doesn’t stick around to hear what Sam has to say. He’s been cooped up in the bunker for weeks and knows he needs to get away. Everything is happening too fast and he’s not sure if he’s going to be able to shoulder all of the responsibility coming his way. He needs a little ‘Dean Time’. He knows his brother has been worried about him since Purgatory, but Dean doesn’t mention it so it doesn’t exist. Except when it does and Dean wakes up in a cold sweat, gripping his bedding like his life depends on it. Purgatory is the realm where nightmares take place, but there’s a small part of him that wishes he could go back.
“Hello Dean,” Cas replies and turns around to close the door. He takes in the sight of the entryway and notices that everything is clean. There are no weird smells or clothes lying everywhere. In fact, he can smell something cooking in the kitchen.
“I have a past,” Dean starts. He has to take a few mind clearing breaths. “I have a past that... I’ll be okay. I just- I need to go home.”
Sam slowly reaches out a hand and rests it on Dean's shoulder. He gives it a gentle squeeze before he speaks and drops his hand back to the seat between them.
Cas’s face totally relaxes and Dean can’t help but feel like he wants to be the reason he looks so content. In fact, if he was totally honest with himself, he’d really like to be the one running his hands through Cas’s hair.
Dean keeps his mouth shut but continues looking at Benny who had already gone back to sharpening his blade. Does he love Cas? Of course he does, he’s his best friend. But does he
There’s that word again “friend”. He’s just a good friend. His best friend, if he wanted to be brave. Dean had had one other best friend, besides Sam, when he was thirteen. They had lived in one place for a near and Dean started to get comfortable. He had loved this boy as much as he loved Sam. His father had found them holding hands in the back of the Impala and then they  moved.
Cas doesn’t say anything. He sits down on the couch and opens the paper bag, pulling out two large muffins. He sets one in front of himself and one in front of the empty space next to him.
I sigh and watch him cover my body with his own. Our dicks are rubbing together in the most delightful way and I let out another moan. He covers my mouth with his hand and bites me on my collarbone hard. My hips buck up onto his torso and pleasure courses through my body. I thrust again and he bites me again.
Gabriel feels sick. He doesn’t want to know anymore. He’s heard about places like those. He’s heard the awful stories about electroshock therapy and the abuse. He doesn’t want to think about his brother in a place like that. He doesn’t want to think about his parents dropping him off and going to have ice-cream while their son was being tortured.
The line clicks before Dean can respond. Something doesn’t feel right, but Chuck assured him that this guy was legit and that it would be fine. He kicks himself for not asking what he’s delivering or even asking a name. He looks at the time and realizes that Sam will be home any minute. The kid is graduating in a few weeks and Dean needs to get as much money together as possible before the big day. He throws on his shoes and his jacket and leaves a note for Sam.
“I’m okay. Just give me a minute,” He replies and opens his eyes again. There are big white fluffy clouds passing above him and he focuses on them until he’s calmed down. He slowly sits up and tries to stand. Benny is still sitting next to him and helps him up. “Thanks.”
“I have something embarrassing to tell you,” Dean says. Cas looks at him and wills him to continue. He can’t imagine that Dean had ever done anything that embarrassing. “When you were staying at Gabe’s...I slept in here. I couldn’t stand to be in our room without you. Anyway, I ate some of Charlie’s famous ‘Wonder Brownie’, and jerked it while thinking about you. I think I made it in less than two minutes.”
Benny turns to the angel and takes a few steps towards him and smiles, “Yeah? Well, you also told me not to mention that I had seen you. What was I supposed to do? He was hell bent on finding you.”
“Trust you? Crowley, please. I don’t trust you as far as I can throw you and I can’t even fucking lift you.”
“Do you want to go?” Dean asks and Sam nods. Dean leaves a ten on the table for the trouble and they both climb into the impala and Dean can’t help but be transported back to when they would sit in the car and talk when they were younger. They hadn’t done it in years. This was going to be one of those talks and even though Dean had been asking and asking for some type of communication from his brother, he might not be ready for this. But Sam is ready and that is what's most important.
Dean turns his head and meets Cas’s eyes. It’s not that he’s shocked, not really. It’s that he never thought in a million years that Cas would be the one to say it first. Not because Cas isn’t capable of love or anything but because he just wasn’t one to just say things.
It’s not so much that he’s feeling weird. He’s embarrassed. He had tried to explain what he was feeling that night in the garage and he can’t seem to translate it into words. It's weird to know you want to die and have the means to do it in your hand, but then there's that other side. The side that tells you not to do it. It's not as prominent as the side that wants you to do it. But it's there. How can he explain that he wasn't going to do it, but wanted to?
“You seem different,” Cas says. Dean looks up at him. He’s standing in the middle of the room with his arms crossed over his chest. He still looks angry. Like, the anger he’s holding in is bubbling right below the surface and the wrong word or gesture will send him spinning into a tornado of rage. Charlie stands a few feet away holding the folder in her hands. She turns it over a few times but doesn’t open it. Cas stares at it. Dean looks between the two wanting them to say something or do something. The quiet is making him feel crazy.
Dean makes a fist and lets his nails dig into his palm. The pain keeps him grounded. He should have just talked to him. This was his fault. Why would Cas do something like this? Why had he started the trials to begin with? He can’t look at his brother anymore so he looks at the ground. Why couldn’t he just have one freaking good thing in his life? Why couldn’t he just not be fucked up? He can’t be here anymore.
“What?” Dean asks. Benny doesn’t say anything. He just continues to look at Dean while his hands move in Cas’ hair.
It isn’t until it’s nearly dinner time that Dean realizes how much he’d been talking. Andy hadn’t really shared much about anything except his job. He didn’t talk about C Street or how Dean had found him. He didn’t talk about Alistair or what Alistair and Crowley did with him after he dropped him off. He just talks about his work and how he’s happy that he’s found himself again. He says it in a way that makes Dean believe him. He says it so convincingly that Dean finds himself staring at the man wishing that he could kiss him.
Dean stands keeping his back to the unfamiliar voice, “Is that right?” He asks, looking down at the lifeless body at his feet. Killing things for information on Cas had gotten much easier. Maybe too easy.
Thursday Dean finds a note and money on his dresser. It’s from his dad. He won’t be home for two weeks.
“Are you okay?” She asks. He nods and tries to sit up. Everything hurts and his throat is so dry it sends him into a coughing fit. Her hands leave his face and she digs around next to him for a moment before handing him a bottle of water. He takes a few sips and looks around. It’s still dark out and he’s still in the car. Charlie is on her knees next to him in the middle seat leaning into his space.
How does he do that? How does he know what Dean’s thinking all the damn time. Sam is mostly right. Cas is an angel, but that doesn’t mean that he’s safe from what was happening all around them.
“Where are you taking me, big boy?” Andy asks. Dean wants to throw up. He asked that once and ended up not being able to to sit down for a week. It was the worst week of his life.
“Andrew was my nephew.” The word ‘was’ makes Dean feel uncomfortable. He watches her as she sits down and hands the envelope back to him. “Go ahead.”
Dean spends his time not with Castiel thinking about Castiel. He still doesn’t talk much, but they see each other almost every day. Summer is coming to a close. Dean knows he’s going to have to leave Castiel behind and go back to school. It makes him feel sad. Besides Sam, Castiel is practically his only other friend. Sure he has a few kids he likes back home, but they aren’t his friends.
“I didn’t know who else to call. Your number was on one of the tags on your backpack. I kept it just in case. They said it’s not safe for me to go back to the camp. They said that I should find somewhere else to go,” Cas still won’t look him in the eye.
“Thank you,” Dean says and takes his hand while they pull onto the highway towards home. Despite the appointment with Ava leaving Dean feeling a bit raw, he feels good. He smiles to himself and drives the rest of the way home humming.
His drive to work is calming. He finds comfort in the sound the engine of his 67’ Impala makes when he accelerates. He smiles as he approaches the gates to Singer Waste Management. His boss, Bobby, is opening the gate. He pulls through with a wave to the older man. The man nods and follows him in on foot.
“Dean,” I freeze at his voice, maybe he doesn’t want this. Is he going to tell me to stop? Did I ruin everything? “Do it.”
“I didn’t bring it up to you sooner because I feel like I need the support from Ava as well. There are things that I need to talk about too and I see now that it’s important for us to not only share our pain but heal by talking about it.”
Cas just smiles and leans up into Dean. Their lips meet and the kisses are no longer sweet and innocent. They are passionate full of understanding and love. Cas runs his hands down Dean’s back and hooks his thumbs in the waistband of his boxes and pushes them down. Dean sits up on his knees and then leans to the side awkwardly to pull them off and toss them to the floor.
Dean paces back in forth in front of Sam who is practically buried in papers, books, and lore. It seems like the only time that Sam is relaxed these days is when he’s in the library, searching through stacks and stacks of information, or organizing paperwork that’s older than dirt. The eight foot table is totally covered except for the small area around Sam’s laptop.
"Sammy, that's not- that's not how this works. Dad is the one who is responsible for that. Thank God you didn't come out when we were younger. It was an actual nightmare. Nothing that happened to me would I wish on my worst enemy. "
A few days pass and nothing happens. They continue on like they don’t have a care in the world. Cas takes care of Dean and Dean lets him. It’s all very domestic and it makes Dean’s skin crawl. He wants to leave. He wants to get away and leave Cas before something bad happens. He thinks about it everyday on his way to work. He could just keep driving. He could leave without a word, but he won’t.
Dean tries not to look like he’s won the lottery. Cas is giving him a look so he knows he’s failed. So, Cas does want to be his friend. Good. That’s good.
“I’m not leaving with you. I can’t go back,” Cas looks towards Dean to make sure he doesn’t hear their conversation.
“You hungry?” Dean doesn’t wait for Sam to answer; he starts pulling things from the cupboards to make mac and cheese.
Cas stands and heads to the kitchen. He watches as Dean stirs something on the stove. He notices that there is only one knife in the knife block and that some of the other kitchen items are missing. Ava had said that Sam had been staying with Dean since he left the hospital. Cas feels guilty that it’s not him here taking care of Dean. It should be him, but he can’t. He can’t help him this time. He has to want it.
“Why do you keep bringing me things?” The man asks. He sets the burger down on his lap and frowns. Dean feels like he should tell him the truth. Maybe just a half truth. Can he even trust this guy?
“Yeah, Dean. Me too.” Sam looks at him again and smiles. Dean sits there for a few more moments and then starts the car. He feels like he just had therapy. He’s raw and unstable. Sam still needed him. And more importantly, still wanted him in his life. He felt good. He felt a little freer. Things were going well for him. He was starting to feel what happiness felt like and he didn’t feel like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.
“You left me to fight off God knows what and all you can say is ‘I had to’? I looked for you Cas. For months! I prayed to you every single fucking night and all you’ve got is ‘I had to’?” Dean’s stance changes. He feels defensive and he tries to keep his temper under control. He had looked for Cas for so long. It was painful to stand here and explain himself.
Wait, since when has Gabe been an expert in grief and relationships? Sams mentioned him twice now. Sam and Gabriel have been talking? About serious things?
“Don’t move,” He says and my body tenses. I close my eyes and try to even out my breaths while I wait. I don’t hear anything, but I know what he’s doing. I know that he’s going to make me feel like a new man.
When Benny had first arrived in Purgatory he remembered his old life as clear as day, but as time went on he started to forget things. Not to mention that if you died you would not only lose memories but you would lose whole chunks of time. The first time Benny was killed it was only a few hours after he had gotten into Purgatory. He had come back and had forgotten the name of his first pet. The second time was a few months after that and was left wondering what his mother and fathers names were. The third time he couldn’t remember much about where he grew up. After that he decided he wouldn’t be killed again.
“Dean, if you don’t stop doing that I’m going to come. We both know once that happens I’m totally useless.” As if to make his point his hips come up off the bed again and he moans so loudly that my breath gets caught in my throat. His eyes are closed and he looks totally blissed out. This is happening. I’m going to fuck him. He wants me to fuck him. He wants me.
Cas lets out a loud moan. Dean can’t help the swell of pride that fills his chest because he’s the reason Cas is making the most heavenly sounds he’s ever heard. He opens his mouth and takes in a few inches of Cas.
“What?” There is a scandalized look on her face, “Dude, there is so much to do here. I mean, the bar scene is snoozeville and full of misogynistic douchebags, but there are some awesome events that some of the local places put on. You should come out with me.”
Dean decides that driving all the way to the next town is a bad idea. Crowley has ways of knowing anytime the Winchesters sneeze and he wasn’t going to take any chances getting caught. He drives about thirty miles to a storage unit facility to store his car and then takes a cab the rest of the way to the motel. He sends a quick text to Sam so he can pick him and the car up later.
“You asked me years ago about my friend. You asked me and I lied,” Cas’s voice trembles at the admission. He waits for his brother to yell at him or hit him or force him to leave, but he doesn’t. He just stands there. He doesn’t look angry, sad, upset, nothing. His brother probably thought he had died and now he's in his office pacing like a lunatic. Why did he come here? Why would he risk this? Dean. Dean was in trouble. He, himself was in trouble.
After what seems like an eternity, Charlie sits on the far end of the couch and Cas pulls up a chair from the kitchen. Dean feels like he’s going to shake out of his skin. He feels restless and he just wants to get it over with. He just wants them to know so they can leave him. He just wants to get the heartbreak over with. He wants them to yell at him and scream at him for being so stupid. He wants them to tell him he’s disgusting and worthless so that when they decide to leave it won’t hurt so bad. He loves them, but he’ll leave them if that’s what they want.
Dean opens his eyes. He’s in Purgatory again but it isn’t quite right. The shadows are too bright. The smell is too sweet. It takes him a moment before he realizes he’s in Cas’ memory. And there was Benny standing right there. Right in front of him. Close enough to touch.
“I think Alistair is here for me. I moved here a year ago, Cas. I moved here to get away from him and my past and I think he followed me.”
“I haven’t been here before, have you?” Sam asks as he sits down. He picks up the menu in front of him and gives it a glance before setting it back down and rubbing his hands on his thighs. He looks nervous and worried.
“You deserve this! She’s gone because of you!” His father screams. He’s heard his father yell before many times, but this is different. This is terrifying and Dean can’t seem to do anything, but lay there and take his punishment. He can’t move. Dean slips into death silently and slowly. He doesn’t want to wake up. It was only a matter of time before Sammy found out about what he did and he wouldn’t want to be a part of him either. It wasn’t worth it to be alone.
“Yeah, me too. I love burgers,” Dean sits next to the guy and the guy stops chewing and stares at him. “What?”
“Yet another thing we have in common. Listen, Sam. Feel however you want to feel and if you like him, then you like him. It’s not gonna change how I see or feel about you. I am however your big brother and I’m obligated to tell you to be careful and take it slow. Like glaciers pace.”
“Such a good boy,” He says and now I’m painfully aware of the hard on pressing against my jeans. As if on cue his right-hand makes it’s way down to the front my chest and to the front my pants. He palms my erection gently. He’s not pressing hard enough for me to feel any relief and I can’t stop my hips from thrusting forward. He bites my neck and then kisses the spot. I know it’s just a warning, but I almost want to thrust again so he’ll bite me harder.
“Dean,” Sam is standing in front of him now and there are two nurses flanking him. One of them is holding a syringe in his hand. They know he’s a runner, but he’s not going to run this time. He lets them take him inside and place him in a room that’s much too small. It makes his brain feel like it’s being squeezed inside his head. His lungs breathe in and out too quickly and his vision is starting to darken around the edges.
“Fuck, Sammy! I don’t know. I was just driving and he passed out,” Dean stands and slams Cas’ door and gets back into drivers seat.
The thought of the last time we were together floods my mind and I’m hard before I even get to his door. I take a few mind clearing breaths. The cold air is calming, but I’m still anxious. I knock and wait.
This Tuesday is the same as the others, but when he walks out to his car there is a chill in the air and he can see his breath when he exhales. He runs back inside and grabs his old pair of gloves for the man by the dumpster. They're worn and the outer layer of the fabric is cracking, but the insides are fleece and they are warm and soft. He also makes an extra sandwich and fills up another thermos with hot coffee.
“I knew when I took you to the camp. You said you have a past that you aren't proud of. I don’t know why, but things clicked. I called Gabriel and told him you were here and I had never heard him so happy. He thought you had died. I...I agreed to the lunch to tell you who I was and to tell you that you ruined my brother's life, but then I saw you at Benny’s and I knew that nothing I could tell you was going to hurt you as much as you had hurt yourself. You looked so different. You looked like you were seeing yourself for the first time in a long time.”
From here on out there will be no schedule for the remaining chapters but I will do my best to keep them weekly. I had an accident with my computer I lost several chapters and I have to re-write them to the best of my ability. Everything (the previous chapters and the few that I was able to dig up from my rough draft) is now backed up on Google Docs.
“Hey, man, no one just belongs on the street. Look,” Dean’s shocked at how upset he feels and how sad he is that Castiel wants to take his chances with the cold. “I don’t know your story, and I’m not askin’, but I’ll be damned if I let you stay out here when I’ve got more than enough at home.”
I delete the message and pocket my phone. I know what I’m doing isn’t right, but I can’t seem to function without it. I can’t live without him and everything he does to and for me.
The third delivery doesn’t go as smoothly. Dean has to pick up the delivery at six and it has to be dropped off by seven. Sam has to be at school at seven. He puts on his watch and knocks on Sam’s door to get him up and moving. If Sam was ready to go by six-forty-five Dean would have just enough time to drop off Sam and drop off the delivery on time.
“Dean, before you answer, I want you to really think about what Cas is saying,” Ava says gently. Even she didn’t see Cas opening up like this.
“It’s fine. Do you need anything else before I start cleaning up?” Dean knows now that he’s not be the only one with a painful past and it makes him feel angry. Cas is kind and thoughtful and always puts others before himself. He doesn’t want to imagine that something bad had happened to Cas.
We’ve always been clear about our relationship. Things seem too real. I know that I should get up and leave but the weight of the drugs in my veins keeps me pinned to the bed. I stare at his face and try to determine the look he’s giving me, but my eyes keep closing.
Why was being gay the reason he was homeless? Did he and his family have a falling out and he was kicked out? Dean knew the pain of that situation. Cas had mentioned that his family was religious. Maybe that had something to do with it. He realizes there is so much he doesn’t know about Castiel, but he wants to.
Cas doesn’t know what’s hit him. Dean’s in his space and kissing him hard. There really isn’t time to react. Dean’s already half naked. He gives up trying to make sense of it and kisses Dean back just as hard. Dean moans.
“There’s something you haven’t told me?” He asks. She stills her motions but doesn’t turn around. He doesn’t think she’s going to answer but then she takes a deep breath and grips the lip of the counter. Soap and water drip off her fingers, and land on the floor.
This chapter was really hard for me to write. I'm not in the best place mentally and writing so much happiness when you aren't happy was a little too much.
“Sam is your brother?” Cas asks and takes another huge bite of his burger ignoring the napkin in front of him. They hadn’t really talked about their families before. They hadn’t really talked about anything before. Dean had tried to avoid talking about himself too much. He didn’t want people to get too attached in case he had to leave again. It’s not like he’s on the run, but after a few years he gets that nagging feeling that he has to leave and start all over again.
He doesn’t like to think about his past, but what if this man is in a similar situation? He makes a mental note to go see if he can find him after his shift tomorrow. He will ask him his name and maybe find out what he’s doing for Thanksgiving. It’s still a month away, but it doesn’t hurt to ask.
"I'm sorry, Dean." Sorry? He was sorry. Dean took a deep breath and turned to face Cas. Anger was the only thing motivating him at this point.
“I think-I think Alistair followed me here. I used to work for him. Five years ago,” She doesn’t say anything at first. She just stares at him. She tries several times to respond, but it seems like she can’t get the words out. He tries to grab her hand to comfort her, but she moves it away. His chest constricts. Charlie stands and goes back into the bedroom and closes the door. Maybe he will take the shower and then maybe make some breakfast.
“I...I have to go. I can’t, Sammy. I can’t do this,” Dean stands to leave but is stopped when Sam grabs him by the arm.
“I’m taking you to my boss,” Dean replies. The guy is so high, drunk, or both he’s not going to remember anything happening.
The two boys spend the rest of the afternoon walking around in the woods and throwing rocks into the lake. They don’t talk much and Dean’s okay with that, but he does have some questions. Where does Castiel come from? Why does he stare like that? Where is his mother? How old is he?
“I-I just wanted to give him a reason to live. Clearly, you aren’t enough, Sam! I had to tell him something. I had to give him hope for something.”
“Cassie?” Cas sighs in response and paces back in forth in front of his brother's large desk. His brother is frozen in place; half sitting half standing. “Castiel?”
“Tell him I’ll be back in a few days to collect.” Crowley makes a face at the cupcake and then drops it on the floor, “You should get someone to clean that up.”
“God, yes,” I moan and close my eyes. I know what I’m asking for, but I still don’t like to watch it happen. It reminds me of a childhood that I have been trying to forget for too long. He presses the needle gently into my skin and the bright blue liquid feels cool as it’s emptied into my vein.
Dean falls asleep after a bit and doesn’t wake up until the next day. Tuesday. He wakes up to his alarm blaring and rolls over to turn it off, but it’s already off before he can get to it. He sees a mess of dark hair moving next to him. He watches as the figure gets up and walks out into the hallway. Cas won’t sleep alone anymore. Dean doesn’t mind. He can hear footsteps and then gurgles from the coffee maker and coffee mugs being set out. He listens as pots and pans are being moved around and silverware is being taken from the drawer. He slips into a peaceful rest listening to the movements in the other room.
“Dean, where did you learn to cook like this?” Cas asks. His mouth is covered in barbecue sauce and mustard and Dean can’t help but laugh and pass him a napkin.
He drives downtown and parks at the park and ride. He’s kind of shocked at all the little stores packed into such a small area. He finds a small bookstore and goes in. Maybe he can find something to send Sam. He likes books about supernatural lore and historical fiction. He’s sure he can find something. He runs his hands across the spines different books. He picks one up about vampires and flips through it. Not really paying attention to where he’s going.
“So, what is going on with Gabriel?” Dean asked as casually as he could. Sam turns and looks at him. There’s a hint of a smile playing at his lips. So, it’s getting serious then. Maybe not boyfriends, but something more than just friends.
Just to explain a little bit, Dean isn't having actual flashbacks at this point. Cas has him in a sleep like coma and he's basically filling in all the blanks for Dean. I'm not sure if that's the way it's coming across, but that's what's happening.
"I feel like I want to leave this appointment. I feel like I'm trying and trying to prove that I'm not how I was, and no one can see it but me. No one can see that I'm different. I know how it looks. I know how scared you guys must be, but I'm here and I'm working through it."
Dean knows he’s getting fired. He hasn’t even gotten his first paycheck yet, and he’s already fired. Maybe they’ll give him the money he has already worked for. He doesn’t count on it as he makes his way to Roman Enterprises.
He focuses on the eyes and takes his first deep breath. The burning in his lungs eases and he takes another and another. He’s breathing. In and out. In and out. The hands are soft and gentle on his face and he slowly calms down and is able to remember a name. Gold eyes.
Dean adds this moment to the many he and Sam had shared. Moments that were only for the two of them because, at the end of the day, they were it. Their relationship was more than a little on the codependent side, but it’s what had gotten them here. Their relationship was unique and strong but also very complicated. He’s sure Ava will bring it up at some point, but for now, he’s content with how things are.
“For being late one time? I hardly care about one honest mistake.” The man opens the drawer next to him and pulls out a file. Dean’s name is written on the tab. He opens it and looks over the papers. “It says here you’re willing to work every day?”
After an hour, Dean walks Castiel to his front steps and watches him go to the front door. Dean turns to leave but something stops him and he turns back. Castiel has now moved back to the top of the stairs.
“Thanks. I uh- I brought you something,” Dean hands her the folder and makes his way to the couch. It’s best if he’s sitting to talk about this in case he has a panic attack and passes out.
“Weather’s starting to change,” Bobby says. “We’re gonna have to start preppin’ for winter in a couple months.” He hands Dean the keys to his truck. Dean nods and looks over to his rig. She’s old, but she gets the job done. If you would have asked Dean what he wanted to be when he grew up, he wouldn’t have said a garbage man. It was one of the only things available when he first moved to town and he's grown to like it. He makes more than enough to live on and he's able to save some and send some to his little brother. Stanford wasn't going to pay for itself no matter how many odd jobs his brother got.
“Where are you, Cas?” Even though the angel hasn’t answered in weeks Dean keeps hoping that he will show up. Maybe this one time will be the time that he comes back.
Gabriel watches as his brother falls apart in front of him. He doesn’t really know what to do to make Cas see that his relationship might be in its final stages. He doesn’t move for a moment but then finds himself holding the younger man in his lap while he cries.
“What’s going on, Castiel? Are you alright?” Gabriel’s voice is calm and even. He takes a hesitant step forward.
He remembers always being tired. Maybe from all the pretending or lack of sleep because he had nightmares about what was happening to him behind closed doors. He could barely stay awake in his classes so he dropped out a few credits shy of being able to graduate and got a job. It wasn’t much but it helped when their dad would disappear for days, sometimes weeks at a time.
Sunday night Dean’s walking up the front steps of his house when he hears yelling coming from inside. As soon as he hears his brother’s voice he knows it’s going to be a bad night. He pushes the door open and quickly closes it behind him so the neighbors don’t have more to talk about.
The man sits there are stares at the bag. He doesn’t think the man is going to take it, but slowly he takes the bag from Dean’s hand and sets it on the ground next to him.
Benny tips Dean’s head back and places a warm washcloth on his face and neck. It feels weird to have someone touching his face. It feels so foreign and strange. He realizes it’s been a long time since he’s even touched another person for longer than a handshake.
His Saturday didn’t get worse so that was good, but it didn’t get better either. His mood was foul and he knew it. It didn’t matter how fast he drove on the back roads or how loud he played his music he couldn’t make himself feel better. He felt stuck in a never ending loop of bad luck. He was sure it had something to do with the fact that it would be the first year that he wouldn’t be able to put flowers on his mother’s grave. It would also be the first year he would miss his best friends birthday. He should call him and see how he’s doing. It’s been a few weeks since their last talk and he hadn’t gotten a letter in at least a month.
“So, you’ve got that whole, like, cliche attractive librarian thing going on?” Cas tilts his head in confusion and Dean’s eyes go wide. He turns back to the shelf and puts the book back to hide his embarrassment.
“No, no. I was kidding! I mean if anything I bother you,” He defends. Holy shit, when did Cas’s eyes get so blue? Cas relaxes and turns back around and starts walking again. Dean follows. Further away from him this time. It’s clear Cas has little or no concept of personal space and Dean doesn’t want to get caught off guard again.
“Dad, come on. Let's get you in bed.” Dean says and stands, turning to face his father. He ignores the tears stinging in his eyes and walks to the kitchen and reaches for his dad's arm.
“Did I say something wrong?” Dean asks. Dean figured Charlie would have told Cas about what had happened last night. Or at least about what he had said this morning. Maybe she hadn’t.
Dean realizes that this could be the last time he see’s Cas. This could be the last time he speaks to him ever. Dean sits on the edge of the bed and keeps his eyes on the floor, “What truth?”
“I need to tell you the truth,” Cas offers. The truth? What truth? Dean looks at everything except the angels face. “I don’t have much time.”
He quickly remembers that he’s in a barber shop and clears his throat. If Benny or Charlie noticed his minor emotional breakdown they didn’t say anything and he’s thankful. He's also thankful Benny doesn't mention his panic attack.
The next time Dean sees Andy he’s a completely different person. He’s cleaned up and almost shiny. He’s in uniform and Dean can’t help but think he looks really good.
“Have me, Dean,” He says. He thrusts his hips into the air and moans again. He’s still teasing me and whatever he’s trying to do is working. It’s working, and God I don’t want him to stop. I squeeze out a liberal amount of lube onto my fingers and rub Cas’s entrance.
"Disappearing on me? Letting me think you were dead?" The thoughts were out of his mouth before he could really think about what he was saying. Dean's anger was slowly building. Anger he didn't want to feel.
“It’s a tracking device. Get rid of it the first chance you get. They won’t be able to find you after that. Dean?”
He turns me around and I open my eyes. His eyes only have a small ring of blue visible. I know he’s already high. I smile at him and lean forward crashing our mouths together. At first I don’t think he’s going to kiss back and I start to pull away but then he grabs my hair roughly and presses his mouth to mine. He sighs into my mouth and digs the nails of his free hand into the skin on my back. I push him back until we’re pressed up against the wall behind us. The skin on his chest is pressed into mine and it feels like silk. I want to rip it off and wrap myself in it and never leave.
When Dean comes to he’s laying back in the hotel. He as a headache and he feels drained. He turns his head and see's  Cas sitting in a chair next to the bed. He looks at Dean but doesn’t say any anything. Cas smiles but it doesn’t reach his eyes. Dean doesn’t have the energy to speak or keep his eyes open. He groans and closes his eyes, falling back into his "angel mojo" induced coma.
By the time he gets to the last text he’s decided to call and at least let him know he’s okay. But there is no way in hell he’s going back to that bunker.
Dean knows this motion. He’s done it enough times because of his father to know that someone has been hitting him. Dean pulls his hand back. The two boys sit there staring at each other for a few moments before Castiel stands up. There are still tears streaking his face. Dean wants to reach out and wipe them away from his face, the same as he does with Sammy, but he keeps his hands to himself.
Wednesday he and his brother got into a fight, which resulted in both of them giving each other the silent treatment.
I'm sorry if anything seems OOC. I watched the scene where Dean and Benny meet for the first time and tried to base this off of that. I don't know if it's coming across correctly and I feel like it's lacking a bit, but I decided to post it anyway.
“The truth about Benny. It wasn’t an accident that he found you,” Cas looks to the empty space beside Dean as if wants to sit there but doesn’t. Instead he sits on the floor in front of Dean. It makes Dean feel uncomfortable. He doesn’t want to have look down at the angel.
“Dean, are you alright?” He feels a hand on his back. The hand starts moving, rubbing small reassuring circles. “Hey, you’re alright, brother. Deep breaths.”
“I’m looking for Andy. Are you him?” Dean asks. The man lets out a few huge tears and Dean can feel the pain of knowing what happens here flood his mind. The man is probably high out of his mind.
Dean doesn’t go to school. He drops off Sam and takes off to the lake with half a bottle of whiskey he stole from the freezer. He can’t go back to school until his face has healed up. He doesn’t want to answer questions. Unfortunately, he’ll still have to go to work. That’s going to be worse. At least he has the day off.
I open my eyes and find his. They are so blue. I can feel the drug taking over my body and I totally relax. He smiles and puts the black box and all its contents away while I take a step back and lean against the counter. I close my eyes and allow myself to fall deeper and deeper into the moment.
“You have me. I mean...Sammy and I. Both of us. Kevin too, if you want,” more shifting in the room. He can hear Cas moving around the room and it makes him nervous.
“She wouldn’t have wanted this,” John says suddenly. Dean’s heart clenches in his chest and he feels like he’s going to fall over. His dad never talks about his mom. Never. The only time he had ever heard him talk about his was when he was nine and his dad had disappeared for days after leaving Sam and Dean with nothing but peanut butter and jelly. “You’re fucking disgusting.”
“I don’t understand,” Dean says. He knows how he sounds and he’s sure Benny does too but he doesn’t say anything and Dean’s thankful for it.
“This is a portion of my grace,” The man pulls a small bottle from his coat and lets the grace float into it, “I need you to take it and find Dean Winchester. Find him and get him out of here. The portal will stay open as long as he is alive. Do not look for me. Do not tell him of our arrangement. Do not tell him you have seen me. I need you to understand the importance of this.”
“You didn’t even know her!” Dean yells. He knows he shouldn’t have said that but it’s too late. The pain is already there. He can’t take it back. Tears are falling down his brother’s face and he’s the reason they are there.
It’s Saturday, Dean’s day off and he’s awake too early. Cas had agreed to lunch. They’re meeting at the bakery around ten. It was only seven. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t a little bit excited to see Cas today.
I know I shouldn’t move because we have an agreement that I’m to do as I’m told. Just standing there in his doorway when he’s this close to me is too much and I lean forward to place a kiss on his full lips. He pulls away from me and grabs me by the hair on the back of my head. He pulls me inside his apartment and slams the door without letting go of me. It hurts, but it feels so good. I need the pain and he knows it.
“We had to take a lot of the information out, because the less you know, the better. Unfortunately, there is nothing that I can do to protect you from the law, however, Alistair is gone. I’ll let you have a few days to get your things in order and then we’ll go from there. My nephew gave the ultimate sacrifice for you. I suspect you’ll stay put for the time being.”
“I’m sorry, Sammy.” Dean says as his brother walks to the front door. Sam turns and gives his brother a small smile and then leaves for the bus.
Cas slams his car into park and stares up at the large building in front of him. He has to see his brother. It’s been years but he pushes his way into the building and ignores the guard at the front desk. He runs up the stairs and scans the doors looking for his brother’s name. He finds it and opens the door without knocking.
He opens the door and runs up the stairs to his room. He quickly scans the room for any red blinking lights. He finds none. He grabs his duffel bag from under the bed and fills it with clothes. He puts his watch in the side pocket of the bag. He can probably sell it later if he needs to. He gets his stash of cash from the closet and the one from the underside of his night table. It should be more than enough to get him started. He leaves the rest in case Sammy needs it later. He runs downstairs and grabs a few things from the cabinets for food and then leaves again. He’s in and out in less than five minutes.
“What’s in it for me?” Benny’s asks. He’s not stupid. He knows there is going to be some kind of risk involved with trying to find a human and he knows he’s going to have to risk his life to keep Dean from getting killed and letting the portal close and that means losing more memories.
“This isn’t your house. This is Dean’s house. He pays for everything. He buys the food and cooks our meals. Hell, he’s even paid rent a few times.”
It takes Dean a few minutes to realize that it’s not Cas touching him but Benny. That helps soothe him a little. After a few minutes he sits up and sees Cas standing in front of him. The hoodie is covered by a light blue windbreaker and Dean feels instant relief. He remembers Benny is next to him. Benny is talking, but he’s not sure what he’s saying exactly until he sees the water bottle in his face. Dean takes it and takes a few sips.
“Did I do something? Was seeing where I live too much?” Cas asks quietly. Dean stops and forces himself to look at his friend. Cas looks defeated and really sad. Dean has to stop himself from reaching out to the other man. God, he wants to tell him everything. He knows he should have someone to talk to about all this. He can’t keep pushing it down forever. It will eat him alive if he tries.
“I’m sorry that I make you feel that way. I’m never upset with you personally. I just get frustrated and need time for myself. I sometimes feel like you're upset with me and I just need to figure out what I did. I don't mean to seem angry with you.”
Cas smiles and so does Dean. It’s true. He does feel like living, but there is something else there. Something bad and scary. Something that no matter how hard he tries keeps nagging at him and trying to pull him back to where he started.
"That asshole was trying to get Benny to do business with him. Turns out that sad sack is wanted in like seven states for drug trafficking." She's just finished talking when the agent and Benny walk out.
“It’s simple, man. Ask her for a study date. That way if it goes to shit you can just focus on your books and whatever. If it goes good, you can take her out after for a drink or something.”
Benny stands there and watches as the angel walks away. He bends down and plucks the bottle from the ground, and holds it flat in the palm of his hand. The grace looks like liquid smoke. It’s bright and he feels a slight vibration in his hand from it.
“So, you’re working for Alistair? He’s made quite a name for himself in the last year,” Gabe says and hands Dean an empty pizza box.
He gets up and takes a long shower hoping to waste a little time. He makes himself an elaborate breakfast and even cleans the kitchen right away. It’s still too early at eight thirty. Maybe he’ll catch up on some TV. He turns on his favorite show and watches it for a total of five minutes before he sighs in frustration. He can’t focus. Maybe he’ll just go for a walk downtown and wait for Cas to show up. He hadn’t really ever been downtown besides to work. It could be a learning experience about the place he currently calls home.
Dean puts a quarter in the machine and plays one of the few songs he can stand while he waits for Sam. Cas had shown up to help Gabe unload the u-haul as Dean was leaving for the restaurant.
Cas tries to talk to Dean but Dean just pretends Cas isn’t there. He ignores him and finally Cas does the same but he can still feel Cas’ eyes on his back when they are in the same room and sometimes Cas catches Dean staring at him. They never speak unless it’s absolutely necessary and Dean is okay with it - at least he pretends to be okay with it. He wishes he could talk to Cas, but when he feels like he’s going to do it something stops him. He’s starting to feel trapped and he’s starting to feel like he needs to escape.
Dean takes a step away from Cas and sighs. He doesn’t know what his emotions are doing. He feels relieved that Cas already knew, but there’s something else brewing underneath his skin.
“I help where I can, but sometimes I feel like I’m not doing enough. Most of these people are good people. They just...they’re doing what they have to do.” Dean doesn’t miss the way that Castiel’s voice changes when talking about people doing what they have to do. He knows the kinds of things people have to do to survive. Cas turns and starts walking towards the tents. Dean follows.
Dean leans his face down close to Cas’s body and kisses along his thighs. Cas squirms and and lets out a gasp as Dean gets closer to Cas’s hard on. He presses a kiss to the tip and then lightly licks it.
"Cas, I- I can't explain it and I'm sorry. I feel like I want to die, but I don't want to be dead. I don't want you to find my body. I don't want to make you feel like this."
“No, you should go. I’m not much fun right now anyway,” He says and stands. Dean watches as Cas walks to the bathroom and closes the door. He stands at the front door for a moment listening for Cas to come back out to double check that he doesn't want him to stay, but he doesn’t. The shower turns on and so does the shower radio. Dean leaves.
"For what, Cas?"  Even though there is still a few feet between them Dean feels like he’s being smothered but he also wants to take a step closer. Dean stays where he is and Cas takes the step closer.
“Come on Cas, you can’t possibly want to stay. I haven’t done a decent thing in my whole damn life.”
Dean bites the inside of his lip to stop from screaming at Cas. He had spent so much time thinking that he had failed Cas. He convinced himself that it was his fault that he had changed in Purgatory, but it wasn’t. It had been what Cas had wanted all along. He wanted to suffer and hurt and feel. He didn’t want to be saved. Everything makes sense now. The hushed conversations with between Benny and Cas and the tension. Benny had known all along and it makes his heart feel like it weighs a thousand pounds.
"Dean, I love you. I can't imagine my life without you. I know that you know that, but I feel like I need to remind you.."
Leaving your best friend behind wasn’t ideal. The boy promised to call and write as often as possible. It helped with the loneliness a little, but there was still a Cas sized hole in his life.
“Benny,” The man takes his hand from Dean’s and turns back to the line of people behind him. He’s confused as to what he’s seeing and his confusion must be written on his face because Cas laughs.
Her eyes are pleading with him. She doesn’t want to tell him. He doesn’t want to be angry because he would have done anything to make Dean better too, but lying? She doesn’t speak for a long time. She just cries and usually, Sam would be there to comfort her to make her feel better but he can’t. His brother's life hangs in the balance.
“Don’t talk like that in my house!” John says from the floor. Sam lets out a dark laugh and bends down in his dad’s face. Dean tries to grab him but his hands are covered in blood and he can’t afford to go to the laundromat for a few more days.
“Nice to meet you too,” Dean says and sets the papers down in front of Marv who takes them and sets them in a folder next to him. Marv stands and motions for Dean to follow him. Dr. Alva doesn’t say anything else.
Dean drives home more confused than anything. Why had Cas made it a point to come out at that moment? He didn’t seem angry. It was like he just wanted Dean to know, but didn’t want to talk about it further. Maybe it was his way of saying that he understands and that he’s there if Dean needs anything. He had blurted it out and took off before Dean had time to process anything.
“Cas, I want you to meet someone. This is Benny,” Dean gestures to the vampire behind him and Benny smiles but then looks quickly at the ground. Dean smiles and turns back to Cas.
Dean looks up to respond and freezes when he sees something moving behind Benny. Dean reaches for his weapon and nods to Benny. They had become so close over the past few months, Dean didn’t have to say anything to let him know there was something wrong. Benny stands and turns around just in time to see Cas walking out of the woods from nearly exactly the same spot they had just come though.
He takes a step towards the bed and my eyes find his. He’s staring at me. I feel like he can see into my soul. He knows all my secrets and fears, he knows it all and he doesn’t care. My eyes start to close, but I quickly open them when my thigh is smacked with an open hand. I look down and see that a red mark is starting to form already.
Dean bends down and taps him on the shoulder, “Hey,” The man opens his eyes and pulls the coat up as if to hide from an intruder, “It’s just me.”
“Fuck, Cas.” I have lost the ability to think. He’s perfect. Laying there fucking himself with his own fingers. I crawl up the length of Cas’ body and kiss him. His arms come up around my neck and he rolls his hips up to me. His erection pressing into my stomach.
“I heard you,” Cas’ gaze is burning into him. He feels tiny under his gaze but looking the angel in eye is not going to happen.
Dean slams on the brakes, pulling off to the side of the road. He pulls out his cell phone and dials Sam. While he waits for an answer he opens his door, gets out of the car, and walks to the passenger side. He pulls Cas’ door open and touches Cas’ face. His fingers burn where his skin meets Cas’ and he pulls them away like he’s touched a hot stove. Sam finally answers.
“What was that all about?” Benny asks and takes the bottle from Dean’s hands. Dean doesn’t have an answer that he feels comfortable saying, so he just stays quiet and leans back closing his eyes. He can’t just tell them about his past. He can’t just explain that seeing that hoodie makes him feel like he’s somewhere else. Somewhere he doesn’t want to be. “Dean?”
His dad removes his hand from his shoulder and starts to walk away but stops and calls over his shoulder, “You’ll be paying me back for the shoes.”
“This has always been your favorite part,” Benny laughs and tips the computer chair back and starts rinsing the shampoo from his scalp. The smell of the soap is overwhelming. It smells like pine trees, spice, and a hint of something sweet. After the soap is rinsed Benny towels off Cas’ head and his hair is sticking up all over the place. Dean snorts in laughter.
Dean follows the man through a series of doors while he talks about the company and what they do. They provide food products like flour and sugar to local bakeries and grocery stores. Dean is relieved that he’s not doing something illegal. In fact, he’s so pleased that every fear or reservation about the job disappears. This was a job that he could be proud of. This was an honest job that didn’t involve questionable deeds.
Dean walks to the couch and picks up his jacket and shoes. He slips them on and leaves the other two standing in his living room without saying a word. He has to get away from them. He can’t let them get more hurt than they already have. He has to leave town. Maybe if he goes, Alistair will follow him and leave them alone. Maybe he won’t hurt them anymore.
He quickly puts his shirt on. Out of sight, out of mind. He can do this. He can focus and do what needs to be done and if Cas wants to fly off into the night with and leave Dean behind, then so be it.
“Cas is staying,” Sam adds and walks towards the library leaving Dean with the war raging inside his chest. Sam’s words melt into him and seep into thoughts. Sam was right. He had changed. Purgatory changed him. He had spent a year in that place searching for Cas. Killing and stabbing to stay alive. He had spent months thinking Cas was dead or had been taken by some creature trying to get revenge on Dean. That journey led him to someone he knows he'll never see again. Someone who Dean owed a lot to and he would never be able to repay that debt.
Dean wakes again and it’s light outside his window. He looks to his left and sees Andy staring at him. Dean tries to smile, but it’s doesn’t feel right.
“Cas, please don’t.” Dean pleads half-heartedly. Cas takes another step forward. Dean feels light headed. He knows Cas wants to show him more, but he’s not ready. He closes his eyes. He doesn’t want to hear about Cas’ pain anymore or think about Benny. Even with the truth hanging out there in the open he still doesn’t want to reach out and grab it.
Dean stands there and lets the truth crash over him like waves. The weight crushes him. Cas’ didn’t want to be found. He didn’t want Dean to look for him. His eyes sting with tears but he can’t look away from Cas. He tried so hard to look away, and he couldn’t.
The car is barely in park before he’s out the door and running up the stairs. The front door is still locked and he can hear Charlie running up behind him when he finally gets the door open. He looks to the couch and Cas isn’t there. He heart leaps up into his chest and tears start to form in his eyes. He looks around the living room and sees Cas’s shoes by the door and his bag hanging off the back of one of the kitchen chairs.
“I’m sorry,” Cas says and tilts Deans head up. Dean’s skin warms where Cas’ hand touches his face. Dean opens his eyes and looks into Cas’. There are tears forming in his eyes. Angels don’t cry. Something in Dean starts to crumble.
“Charlie, I need to tell you something. You aren’t going to like it,” Dean says quietly. She finally looks up at him. There are already tears in her eyes and it makes Dean feel uneasy. He never did well with women crying. It reminded him of all the times he would find his mother crying when she thought no one could hear.
A few months later Sam calls and tells Dean that their dad isn’t doing well. Dean knows he shouldn’t go back but he does it anyway. He grows out his hair and colors it darker and hopes that no one will notice him. His dad isn’t happy to see him. They fight and it leaves Sam with so many questions that Dean can’t stay. He takes the Impala and heads back to the Pacific Northwest.
“Dean?” I sit myself up a little straighter and unwrap my legs from around his waist and pull away from him. What does he mean he’s wanted this for a long time? “What do you mean ‘a long time’?”
The timing is a little messed up so just kind of ignore the days/months. I tried to fix it but only ended up confusing myself further. Thank you for reading! Let me know how you like it so far! :)
Dean doesn’t say anything else. He would be lying if he said he wasn’t scared that they’ve found him.
Purgatory hadn’t only changed Dean. It had changed Cas as well. He was more detached and less angel like. Dean had taken a portal from Purgatory to some random woods and was able to find Sam and get to safety. Dean was sure that Cas would never get out of there so, he mourned his friend and moved on. About two months after Dean has gotten back and the nightmares happened only a few nights a week, Cas showed up unable to remember anything about how he had gotten out. Dean was sure that Cas was going to stay and help them but he had left in the middle of the night as soon as he was healed. No note. Nothing. They haven’t heard from Cas in weeks and it’s taking it’s toll.
“Don’t,” He freezes when Cas’ voice cuts through the darkness. His voice is wrong and it makes Dean’s hands itch to continue to the light but he doesn’t. Instead he puts his hands in his pockets and digs his fingernails into his palms to stop himself from turning around and leaving. He puts his back to the wall and slides down until he’s sitting on the floor facing the center of the room. His eyes are adjusted just enough that he can see a faint outline of the angel curled up into a ball at the end of his bed.
"I want to try, but it just doesn't seem like I can. I guess I want Sam and Cas to know that I'm okay. I want them to know that even though what happened happened, I’m not going to try anything."
“You’re the one? You’re the one who sent him to the hospital? You piece of shit!” Dean spits. The fear and shock are long gone and anger has taken their place. He knew this man because this wasn’t the first time that this man had hurt a friend.
"Dean, come on. He’s an angel for one thing and it’s not like he isn’t prepared,” Sam stops typing for a moment, “Besides, we need all the help we can get.”
Dean slowly slips back into consciousness. He rolls over and presses his face into his pillow. He had had too much to drink and was still drunk. He raises his head slightly and glances at his clock. It’s only been a few hours since he passed out. He closes his eyes and hopes that the pounding on his door will stop.
Benny nods in an understanding of what Cas needs and gets to work and Cas closes his eyes. Something happened there and Dean missed it.
“What do you want?” The words leave Benny’s mouth harsher than he means and forces himself to look away from the blood. He keeps his breathing even while breathing out of his mouth to avoid smelling the blood.
“I mean it, Cas,” Dean stands and takes a step towards the light switch, “We’re here for you. You’re part of our family. Okay?”
He had a meeting with Crowley and Alister soon and they were no doubt going to move his position up in the company. Watching Crowley beat the crap out of people had been exhilarating to watch, but Dean was ready to get his own hands bloody. He had a few of his own ideas on how to get people to pay up or start talking.
“Dean, you have to get out of here. You have to go before Andy gets back.” Gabe is shoving Dean back into the house and grabbing everything he can find that looks like Dean’s.
He cracks one eye open when he feels movement beside him. Cas is sitting over him with a look of deep concentration on his face. His hand slowly and softly moving over his face, his finger outstretched and touching Dean’s cheeks and forehead lightly. It’s not painful but it is a little weird.
“Do it,” He breathes. I move my hand down to my dick and line it up. Cas’s nails are digging into my back in anticipation and I slowly push in. The heat is almost too much. I don’t think this is going to last long. I push in slowly and wait a few moments for him to get adjusted.
