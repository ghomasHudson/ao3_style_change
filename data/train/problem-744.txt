“That you are lad” he smiled and took my arm.
“Please don’t mate, you’re fucking terrifying. In medieval times they would’ve burned you at the stake or something, you know that?”
Oh god, Sherlock rolled his eyes, “couldn’t they have sent someone less annoying….or can’t you just be a disembodied voice or something?…I’m pretty sure it isn’t a requirement that you physically follow me around”
Oh yes… He smirked.
“What do you mean by that?” he spluttered, choking at little on his mouthful of cereal and milk.
John didn’t even know them or know jack-shit about their relationship. He simply could have misjudged things. But John couldn’t shake the fact that this felt wrong, somehow.
“I’m afraid so”, said Mycroft, “and they may want to discuss your other little injuries, I only think it fair to warn you, although I’m sure they’ve seen it all before”.
“Fuck you Sherlock!”
Sherlock breathed as he yanked John’s jumper off over his head leaving them both naked from the waist up. He shivered, “Bed?”
Really? Well that was…unexpected…Sherlock without his phone was like severing one of his limbs.
He walked slowly towards the bed and sat down, and tried not to notice the smug look currently levelled at him.
This time it was Sherlock hauling John to his feet, clasping his outstretched hand and yanking him up, slipping and sliding as his smooth rubber soles scrabbled for purchase on the wet, snowy ground.
“Damn it you bastard” he squirmed as John gazed down at him, amused, “What do you want, for me to beg you?”
Maybe he should just get this over and done with right now and jump right in.
“Ready?”
“Ah Ah!” John scolded, moving back, teasingly out of reach. Sherlock whined and made to grasp him round the back of the neck to pull him down. John laughed softly, enjoying his power and Sherlock’s complete lack of self-control as he pinned his wrists down , breathing deeply through his nose to calm his own pounding heart as Sherlock, bucked and writhed driven to the point of desperation by the lack of friction.
It was one thing to admire the physique of a fellow athlete, but quite another entirely to experience what was undoubtedly the start of an erection while watching said athlete perform. And that’s what Sherlock undoubtedly was, an athlete in every sense of the word, just as much as John and all his rugby mates, if not more so. If only they could see this, witness it for themselves, the sheer power, the strength, flexibility and endless stamina.
“Probably not…”
They parried back and forth, both steadfast and determined to press his point. This was not John’s fight though, it was mine and mine alone. I forced my unwilling limbs to motion and faced my accuser, the destroyer of my happiness, and if I was to fall it was also in my power to bring him down too. I had no reason to feel shame and held my head aloft, no more the cowering boy he had forced himself upon.
“It is my father”, John said, before he even read it, the wax seal unbroken, the note still clutched in his hand, “All is well Sarah, go now Sarah, you did right to take it and I’d far rather you have the advantage of it than any other in this house”. She bobbed a curtsy, relief on her delicate features and retreated with an anxious glance to John.
hmm?”
He shot Sherlock a wide-eyed look and Sherlock raised his eyebrows in reply.
Sherlock smirked triumphantly. John had backed Mycroft into a corner and the bell had just rung for the end of the round.
“You never answered, I didn’t expect you to come”
“Are you sure boy?”
“Er…not really…. We haven’t played that for years have we?”
Sherlock’s eyes were gleaming, as he tapped away at the keyboard firing off messages on various forums as far as John could make out. He pulled out his phone and sent a few texts too, flipping through contacts with his left hand while continuing to tap on the computer with his right, his ability to multi-task astounding as his brain clicked into overdrive. He looked so alive, and focused, a complete contrast to the shivering boy in the back of the van, and John couldn’t help but worry just how long it would last before he crashed when only an hour ago he had looked like he was barely hanging on.
“With jeans this tight?”
“And I know what I know sir…should you like your son to hear of it?”
There was nothing between them now, just honesty and skin.
“As I was saying” she scowled, Mr Holmes will be staying with us and will be sorted tonight….I’m sure he will be a valuable addition to whichever House he ends up in” she gave Sherlock an icy glare that would have turned any other student into a quivering wreck, but Sherlock merely quirked an eyebrow and gave her a slight bow before folding himself onto the tiny stool, bony knees almost touching his chin.
Sherlock popped the ‘p’, just to annoy him, and fiddled with the blanket in his lap, head down, his right hand still wrapped in John’s, fingers interlinked. John felt uneasy, there was obviously something going on that he didn’t know, a glitch in the recovery, some underlying injury or internal damage which could have serious implications. It was his head for god’s sake, that amazing brain, grey matter encased in a breakable shell which some dickhead had tried to shatter tonight and destroy.
“But why did you decide that time is now? You looked scared to death a couple of hours ago when you thought I was going to molest you in the photocopy room”
He left at noon, and just as before I vented my displeasure to hide my true feelings in a shameful display of childish petulance, for I was afraid that they would guess at his part in my flight and cause him harm, with no-one there to bear witness. Truly, I do not know how he found the patience to deal with my volatile temperament that had vexed so many before. That, I can only attribute to his own sweet nature and plain common sense in the face of my emotional excess. I had surely for that, found the other half to my whole.
Twenty minutes later they stood on the pavement outside 221B.
He hesitated, then continued, “We thought we should at least wait to see that you came home safely, they sounded like dangerous people”
Victor looked into his eyes with a steady gaze, as if happy with the reaction the slightest touch had caused
“Quite something isn’t he?”
Sherlock wrapped a long leg around his waist, shifted to the side and casually flipped them over. John’s head connected with the floorboards with a thunk.
“Can go somewhere else now?” he almost pleaded, retrieving his coat from under a chair.
Going outside was too much of a chore, so Sherlock crossed to the window and undid the sash. He pushed it up half way and then perched on the sill with his arm stuck out to carry the smoke away on the cool night air. He took a long drag, holding the heat and chemicals in his lungs before slowly blowing out.
‘I wish to train as a Physician, but my father says he will not waste a penny more on education, but there is hope yet, my grandmother would dearly love to see me fulfil my ambitions and will gladly pay if only he would agree to it’
“I thought that fucking torture would never end”
“Treat me like what?” Sherlock said, and sounded genuinely puzzled. He looked at John properly then, tilting his head to one side.
“Sherlock, you do realise you’ve got come on your jeans?”
“Yeah, have you seen him? I mean, last night that is, I don’t know if he got home okay and I’m a bit worried to be honest” he shifted nervously from foot to foot. Billy jumped down from the table and opened his battered old guitar case, laying the instrument inside with infinite care, he lifted his head to look at John with undisguised curiosity, as if gauging whether he could trust him. His shoulders relaxed as he stood up, ready to leave.
“Why would I do that?”
‘Look at me Sherlock’ he said, ‘I do not seek to hurt you, I will only do as you want me to and nothing more for your pleasure means as much to me as my own’.
“Because we both know how much you like it”
“Yes, both Doug Miller’s bully-boys, seems like him and Frank Hudson are indulging in a little tit- for- tat. But double murder, that’s a game changer. I’m going to need access to the toxicology reports, maybe I can trace it back to the origins of the drug that was administered. But there must be something else, something I’m missing…fuck why can’t I just think” he growled, clenching his jaw and ramming a fist into the side of his temple.
No more sorry's. No more next times.
John flashed him an apologetic look and pushed up from the wall, heading inside to the downstairs cloakroom.
“T….Tom…?” the voice that escaped my lips sounded broken and lost, even to my own mind. And I stood agape, feet fixed upon the floor as a smile broke out across that fondly cherished face and he rushed across the room toward me.
"Hardly wise", remarks Mycroft.
“Yeah, it’s class”, he stood still and watched while the boy hopped off the bed and knelt down beside an old sound system with a double tape deck and slotted the cassette inside. I lilting guitar riff chimed out, sounding only slightly tinny through the ancient speaker’s built into the chunky unit.
“Here, have another, looks like you bloody well need one”.
She smells of lavender…that’s actually quite nice, was his overriding thought.
A flashlight almost blinded him as it swept over his face from the top of the stairs.
To his surprise Sherlock continued, deep voice vibrating into his skin.
Jesus Christ he was fucked, John didn’t know how, but he was sure the bastard could tell there was something weird and quite possibly inappropriate going on inside his head, and now for god’s sake, he was going to have to share a room with him aswell?
“Just hold it there pal, you’re coming with us”.
John just smiled at him again, and Sherlock couldn’t help noticing the cute little crinkles around his eyes.
“Nice to see my brother’s love affair with cake is alive and well in this universe” he chuckled.
How was I to answer? What could I say to match such sentiment so tenderly expressed?
“Wouldn’t you say I’m both?” Sherlock gave a wry smile, “But yes, like me in a way, not in every way though….anyway..”
“You’ll look ridiculous by the way” he said peevishly, licking the remnants of salt from oily fingertips, as John fished a battered old backpack out of the under-stairs cupboard in the hall. “This isn’t a boy scout’s camping trip…what next? Pitching a tent and toasting marshmallows over the glowing red embers? It’s a crime scene John, not a jolly little jaunt”.
"I did love him, you know. It wasn't always.... like that".
My cheeks burned. I understood the implication. She had already guessed we did not have her money, but had reckoned how to make more. “Two weeks the rent is overdue dear – or else there are others who’d be willing to take up your burden, I’m sure, pretty face like yours.”
“What the hell are you standing there for? Get over here, I need you” he said peevishly, and John dived forward, crushing them together a little too roughly perhaps for someone with a head injury, but happy, just so fucking happy to have him awake, warm, responsive, his own sweet obnoxious self, back again.
Mike held up his hand, palm forward to fend off John’s advance.
“So, what else do you want to know?”
Sherlock stood on the front doorstep, soaked through to the bone in his grey wool coat and shuddering violently against the cold, his face a picture of utter pain and misery as he clutched a brown leather collar to his skinny little chest.
“The photo-shoot John, for the school magazine? Greg said you’d drop by sometime this week.”
John rolled his eyes.
I took my inspiration for this story from a scene in 'The Perk's Of Being A Wallflower' where Charlie plays a game of truth or dare, and if you haven't seen this movie or read the book, I would highly recommend that you repair this heinous oversight immediately - you won't regret it!
John was blinded for a second as he forgot to look away from the light, red and green dancing before his eyes. Sherlock growled in annoyance and grabbed a handful of robe, almost pushing him out through the door. The common room was deserted and so was the outer corridor too as they tentatively dropped through the portrait hole and stole silently down the first flight of stairs heading determinedly for the main doors.
“Let me guess” Anderson the drummer butted in before Greg could answer (stringy hair, ratty face John thought)
And there it was again, the not- really- a- question – but an invitation, and John gave the only answer he ever wanted to now or ever could.
“Nice to see you too Sherlock” Sherlock flipped over on the mattress and in one smooth movement stood up, using his extra height to full advantage, he loomed over John and pressed him back into the cold plaster wall.
The man nodded in agreement to something she said, his eyes flickering up to rove around the room again. He paused when he caught Sherlock staring and smiled, mouth quirking up at the corners in the ‘
“Smoke breaks over Lestrade…back to work” the irritatingly clipped voice of Sally Donovan echoed across the road. Since when did she have the authority to order Lestrade around like that?
“And what exactly are you implying Lestrade?”
Carefully, he pressed a full three fingers, where his cock had withdrawn, slipping smoothly inside Sherlock’s still-stretched hole, hot and slick with come, fucking in and out relentlessly, as Sherlock ground back frantically. John felt his way inside, until he found what he sought, rubbing merciless teasing strokes over the sensitive nub, counting two, three, four, five, watching the tremors grow, spreading up Sherlock’s shaking thighs and trembling body, satisfied as Sherlock shook and gasped.
John exploded into laughter at his side, the real shoulder-shaking, tears running down the face kind, and Sherlock could hear the words before he even opened his mouth. Oh god, oh fuck John don’t don’t don’t….
“Because I can see it in your eyes, and that funny little crease you get along the top of your nose”.
The two cups of coffee kicked in on the walk back down so they parted, Greg walking on while John dipped into the loo’s for a piss, the kick of caffeine making his heart skip a little, a butterfly- flutter in his chest.
“And that” said Sherlock coolly as he disappeared from view “is exactly why you should”
‘I am not helpless’, I said in protest, for how could I count myself a man if I hid behind the coattails of another and let them deal with my indiscretions?
“Can I have your attention please” her soft Scottish brogue belied the steel and authority in her tone and the room immediately fell silent as hundreds of eyes turned to watch the new boy climb the steps to the stool and stand expectantly, looking out over the room, a cool confident gaze sweeping over and assessing the faces staring back at him. He was, quite frankly, gorgeous, John thought.
Mrs Hudson sat quietly, her chest heaved as she trembled slightly. With the most shocking aspect of the news revealed, he continued calmly, as she regarded him tearfully.
, neither wanting to be the first to give in, and it was the best sex he’d ever had in his life, John thought, coated in sweat, muscles burning, skin on fire, and any second now he would fill this arse so full….
The cold surface chilled his skin as he clawed his way upright, hand closing around the cool metal casing of the object of his destruction as he rose.
He gently pushed Sherlock back and silvery eyes stared down at him questioningly. Christ, he was tall. And bloody hell he was turned on right now. His cock throbbed painfully against the seam of his jeans.
“Look at me John…is this what you want?”
Ah well, so much for secrecy.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably, eyes cast down as he fiddled nervously with the mobile, now in his right hand. He took a steadying breath.
John huffed, a small laugh and ran his hands up and down the length of his thighs, warming the icy skin. He shuffled back a step or two and stuck his arse out further, in what he imagined was a helpful way, there was a height difference to consider, and he didn’t want to accidently abrade his cock against the wall.
“Oh my god Myc…when?”
"Sorry about hijacking your room and all that…it’s a bit shit, I know …but I promise not to snore too much or hog the blankets and stuff…and I won’t eat any food that might make me fart, so I guess that means the Brussel sprouts off limits for once”
Despite what he said, John set about disrobing me quite of his own accord. And whilst I teased him for such a display of impatience, I let his hands roam over me, touching and stroking, felt the light, stinging scratch of the stubble on his chin as he peeled off my jacket, then waistcoat, then shirt, mouthing each inch of skin that was uncovered. Kisses pressed down the length of my spine which made me arch and gasp and curse him beneath my breath but more of a benediction in nature than from any desire for him to stop. And he did not stop, continued as I knew, and yes, hoped that he would. He looped a hand around my chest and traced his fingertip over the ring while his dominant left hand slid down, down, beyond the curve of my back stealing beneath the boundary of my smallclothes.
‘And is that what you want? I do not mean to presume, but wouldn’t you rather have one man to love and protect you and who would not suffer you to be had by anyone else?’
Greg was there too, leaning against the window sill with his arms folded, looking up at the sound of Sherlock, poised and ready to object. “Listen, I’ve kept quiet on a lot of things, but Myc’s right, this is all getting a bit too serious now. You’ve both been hurt and I still think you were wrong John for staying quiet on that one, but this isn’t a bloody game of ‘let’s play detective’ or something no matter how you’ve tried to convince yourselves…these are bad people you’re on the wrong side of…if this was down to them that is”.
“I doubt it” his voice sounded hollow and flat, drained of emotion, but he took the drink and sipped, fire cutting through the ice, sensation coursing back through his aching limbs. They sat for a while, in silence, just drinking slowly, Irene rising to refill his glass as it emptied. Finally she broke the silence.
My calm voice belied an inner turmoil. I kept my back straight, and my gaze clear and steady, but I know not how I kept my legs as the floor pitched and swayed beneath my feet.
John detected a slight hint of panic in the other boy’s voice.
’ you mean Victor? Yes, he touched the handle, the door when he came in, nothing else I don’t think, it was seconds John…I told him to fuck off and he left, Mycroft spoke to him and then you served him drinks at the bar, after that who knows…but honestly, I really don’t think he’d do that, smack me on the head…he just…wouldn’t”.
“Get her out of there Irene, or I’ll begin to worry if your powers are waning, she had sub written all over her, surely it won’t be that hard?”
“Oh Sherlock”
After much sweet assurance of future delights on his part on that particular Thursday in the month of May, we found ourselves, John and I, rapping smartly on the door for admittance. The air was warm yet, and the last rays of the early summer sun still heated our backs as we waited there, my lips tingled yet from the numerous whiskery kisses received on our journey and the kerchief at John’s neck concealed a most startling bruise that I had placed there. The breeze caught the edge and raised it, exposing the mark I had made and I turned to him and gestured that he secure the silk a little more.
Would it interest you to know that I can come from just the flick of a tongue against the ring through my nipple if I focus? Perhaps if I mentioned that the filthy mental imagery conjured is of your mussed blond hair and rugby players thighs?
“I am sorry if I scared you. I swear by god Sherlock I would never seek to hurt you in that way, I….”
“Have you done it? Did you invite him then?”
“Come on, let’s just get this over with” he stands, one graceful fluid motion even as shit-faced as he is, and holds out a hand, hauling John back onto his feet.
This time he chose to run not walk, crashing through doors and taking the stairs three at a time. He raced towards his room, and fumbled desperately for his key card, top button of his jeans already undone, left hand already shoved down inside his pants. He had just managed to slam the door shut with his back and was sloppily fisting his aching cock when his phone buzzed again.
Where the hell were all the taxi’s when you needed one? John grumbled to himself as he walked along the deserted streets, arms clasped around his body to keep out the biting cold.
We sat, and I raised up my eyebrow at John who just smiled and rolled his eyes. I would not even have the illicit thrill of our hands brushing close when we ate, or the press of a thigh as I shifted in my seat. The lady to my right was unknown to me and spoke to her neighbour instead. It suited me well.
“Oh don’t fuss, it worked, they’ve gone, what more do you want?”
His phone vibrated once against his hip.
“That was amazing Billy”
“Don’t move and don’t make a single sound kid”
“Perhaps”, she smiled, “As do you I think”.
“Firstly, an item was delivered to the house this morning, an unmarked plain brown envelope, no indication from whence it came or who the intended recipient was. I took the liberty of making some discreet enquiries on your behalf, but to no avail, the sender remains a mystery, although I dare to entertain my own suspicions” Mycroft said as he smoothed a hand down the crease of his trousers, a tell, to Sherlock at least, that he was quietly furious. Sherlock decided to ignore this deduction lest the fury should be thrown in his direction, choosing instead to relax into the caress of John’s teasing fingers.
“Ah, it’s a bit….technical…suffice to say Isaac was in your immediate present and this is a version of the past….it’s time to go now John, there’s nothing more to be done here…."
Only once seated in the carriage at last had I time to gather my thoughts. We sat opposite one another, knees bumping lightly with the motion of the wheels over cobblestones; Tom looked fondly at me knowing I had much to ask, but I not yet knowing how little he could tell.
Sherlock was annoyed to say the least, and fact utter cold fury would be a better description entirely, he thought. Mummy had just informed him in no uncertain terms that he was to share his overly large bedroom with one of their Christmas guests , the grandchild of their housekeeper, Eleanor, in other words, some idiot boy, no less.
I felt her gaze upon us as John led me across the sumptuous hall to the other side of the mansion house. We passed through a door and down a long passage and up a narrow staircase to a sparsely furnished private landing. There was only one door here, heavy oak like the entrance, with a worked iron knocker and large heavy hinges. This had more of the look of a private study than what I would take to be a library. John rapped on the door with four brisk knocks and he waited, ear pressed close to the wood until he heard a distant call of “Come”. He pushed the door open and ushered me inside, and I gazed in wonder as I tried to comprehend the vast, warm room lined from ceiling to floor with the finest mahogany shelves simply bursting at the seams with books.
“Not a word mate, been talking to Mycroft”
‘You are out of your way sir’, Tom interceded, ‘please take your friend back’, he nodded to the other lad.
Graham Watson cleared his throat. “Just don’t stay out too late,” he said. “But if you do,” he threw John a significant look again. “Just be quiet when you come in or Harry will do her nut, so erm...just keep that in mind, if you, uh…” he waved a hand, gesturing helplessly. “Do whatever it is you boys do…”
“Well the hell would you drink a lager through a straw?”
“I am master of nothing, truly”, I answered, as John led the way, “I thought it but a child’s trick which I used to tease the maids when I was small. He was one small man, and you forget the most important part, I had you by my side and that is where I draw my strength and courage. I am weak alone”.
There, have I shocked you?
“Of course, definitely” John shoved his hands down into his pockets felling inexplicably awkward. Sherlock turned to go.
Oh for god’s sake, not this again, please.
He didn’t add the element of personal acquaintance to his statement, because John remained at present, thankfully unaware.
“Such beauty is worth more than a rich man’s vaults”, he said, sliding a hand beneath the linen of my shirt to rest there flush against my abdomen, warm and dry, as he pressed up against me from behind, “and all for me I fancy. Is it not so?”
The wind increased, invading his filthy little haven, so he pulled his coat in tighter and moved another few paces inside. The sensitive hair at the nape of his neck began to prickle and stand on end. He was no longer alone. Sherlock pressed back into the shadows, concealed behind an old wooden door, propped up against the wall.
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath at the pain and let a soft moan of pleasure, the signals scrambled in his head, he was sick, this was wrong, it hurt so much and it was so fucking good…
John stopped, and looked thoughtful. “You understand much…then how is it that you do not know yourself?”
“Please don’t.” Sherlock snapped back at him, hoisting his bag up on his shoulder and barging his way through the door.
“Is that what he told you?” Victor slurred, “Because I didn’t exactly have to chase very hard when he had his fucking tongue down my throat and his hand around my prick…we only stopped cause he was high as a kite”.
Mary got up from the table and squeezed past his chair to the other side. She helped Daisy down from the seat next to John and bustled off towards the ladies room with a Marks and Spencer carrier bag and a dripping wet child. Poppy ignored the whole thing, munching happily on the biscotti that had come with Sherlock’s coffee.
Sherlock shuddered, sinking a finger into his body, he rolled his hips and his mouth fell open. He placed his right hand on John’s stomach to steady himself and rocked up and down slowly. John could see the tension in his thighs, the way the muscles quivered with every shallow little thrust. The steady rhythm stuttered a little as he eased another finger inside his own body and dropped forward, body curled over John’s fucking faster against his own hand. His breath ghosted over John’s body as he panted desperately, hips slowing and stuttering to a halt.
Eight missed messages.
“That was barely four months ago Victor, you’ve been gone a hell of a lot longer than that, try again”
“Perhaps”, John smiled softly, with something of sadness and longing in his eyes, “And it seems now that I am an orphan too …I wonder what is to become of us?”
“Yeah, and twice as much to spare, but that won’t matter when him and his mates beat the crap out of us”
“Since when did the wizarding world ever take logic into account? Hmm?...Think about it Sherlock”
“She’s a dominatrix John”
As the music started up again, Sherlock moved with effortless grace across the room, and even though John knew squat about ballet he knew enough to spot good technique and flawless execution in the intricate series of steps, leaps and spins he sped through while barely breaking a sweat.
“I am no thieving whore sir, nor ever was…on that I think you well know”.
The girls at the table sat still at their work, casting us only a passing glance and John a little more I fancied, and we stood there rather awkwardly till a well turned-out lady in her fifties at least appeared from a door to the right. She was small in appearance with soft brown waves of hair that framed a small face, fined boned and pretty in appearance. In her younger days she would have been a rare beauty indeed, delicate and trim of figure with a pleasing smile that made her green eyes sparkle like jewels.
“Bullshit Sherlock….you never guess”.
This toff was weird for sure, John thought, what was his game anyway? If he touched another mark, he might just turn John over to the law. And who would believe him, a slum kid, that some posh brat had helped him on the rob?
‘Stop sir, please stop I beg of you’ I cried finding my voice again, and he gave pause, but only to throw off his own waistcoat and unbutton the front of his breeches, making a determined attempt to force his knee between my thighs. But I held fast, pressing my legs together in denial of access as he panted and cursed at me to ‘open your legs you damned little slut’. But I would not, and he grunted and rutted against my leg like a randy dog collapsing soon after, head buried beneath my armpit, lain unnaturally still.
“Nah, it always does that, worse if you drink it through a straw”
The next few minutes were a blur. John tried to stop him with a hand curled around his upper arm, he shrugged him off roughly and stumbled over a tangle of legs and bodies as he fought his way towards the door. The sound of raised voices echoed down the hall as he pulled his coat from the pile on the floor by the staircase and shrugged it on, still with the presence of mind to fish the scarf from his pocket and loop it messily around his neck.
So, not a lock-up garage, Sherlock mused, an actual car mechanic’s workshop. It was clearly a family business -- John’s family.
John was flattered by his avian substitute and was keen to learn how Sherlock viewed himself, probably something rare like a Golden Eagle, he guessed.
Sara cut him off – “Sherlock?” she said, incredulous, “What sort of ridiculous pansy-arse name is that?”
Nothing could be further from the truth.
His eyes flickered over that long pale neck that was tilted slightly over to the right, and rested for a moment on dark mark against the white skin, a bruise that he didn’t put there that night.
Never, in over three years had he even come close to the sneakiest of peeks, no matter how many times John had ‘accidently’ walked in on a shower or bathroom break. Sherlock guarded that thing like the fucking crown jewels, he may as well stick it in a bullet-proof case. But hell, at least now he knew it was indeed a thing of beauty, and he had to see it again.
There was obviously something going on here, a layer of subtext, every word had a double meaning John was sure, but she was hardly Sherlock’s type now, was she?
“He married someone else….he doesn’t need me anymore”
My eyes searched amongst the soberly clad patrons of the pub with increasing agitation, stretched up upon my toes to over their heads as far as the smoky atmosphere would allow.
He shifted position a little and John bucked underneath him with a strangled gasp, his legs falling down from Sherlock’s shoulders to flop on the mattress at his side, writhing as he thrust to meet the rhythmic fucking of Sherlock’s fingers.
The voice came from far away, niggling at the edges of his consciousness as the world faded around him again, the cold, dank graveyard giving way to a bright, searingly hot summer sun. Sweat dripped down his forehead into his eyes and he brushed it away, holding a hand to his face to shield it from the glare. John looked down to unzip his thick winter coat and found it already gone, replaced by lightweight khaki’s and a worn beige t-shirt, eliciting bitter memories of the not too distant past.
“Doesn’t it? I thought it was rather effective….expressing my gratitude for your sexual prowess is exactly the same as a thank you”.
“That depends if you’ve been bad or good” he squeaked, terrified and turned-on at the same time.
John gave a snort of laughter. It was a wonderfully accurate assessment. “Yeah, that sounds fair…go on.”
John snatched his hand away as if he’d been burnt and Sherlock hissed as he felt the scratch of a fingernail on sensitive flesh. He still had the presence of mind to grab the quilted throw from where it had pooled around mid-thigh and pulled it quickly over their exposed bodies. A head of wispy brown hair peeped cautiously around the door frame.
“Going to hide the evidence you mean, you dick!” she shot at him as he backed out of the room.
“That was quick…you okay?” John asked when he joined him again seconds later, the concern in his eyes genuine. his head already free of the creeping unease and anxiety. How to answer.
She laughed at the horrified look on his face.
He let me go with an air of triumph.
Ah, Sherlock thought, and a shiver ran down his spine as the guy advanced towards him, pressing him back against the cool rough brick of the building and plucking the unlit fag from his mouth. Well that was unexpected, he gasped in surprise, and before he had the time to process another thought, the bloke was on him, bodies flush together and a hand behind his neck to pull him down. Sherlock jerked back, caught off-guard and they paused, breathing heavily simply staring at each other unblinking.
“But why?” I said brokenly, unsure of the answer that I sought. “You’ll see soon enough” he said archly, “Are you ready? Shall we go?”
Mycroft rolled his eyes at them.
“Very eloquent John…Actually I do know him…quite well in fact, but he’s been off the grid for a while and I wasn’t sure…” Sherlock paused to cast a searching look at John, “if he was still alive or not”.
He felt John shift beside him as he leaned over for a closer look, the leather seat squeaking under his damp arse, he cleared his throat and Sherlock felt a lead weight fall into his stomach. He didn’t give a shit about the pictures, but cared deeply about John’s reaction to them.
“Get your coat Malcolm, you’re taking me to the police station…now”.
“I’m sorry Sherlock…for what happened at the weekend…what I did…I lost it again and I’m an idiot I know that…but I would never, ever hurt you, you know that…don’t you?”
“I’m so sorry sirs, begging your pardon young sirs, but the gentleman was most insistent that you have this now. I told him sir, I said you were not to be bothered in the daytime, but he gave me this sirs, and please forgive me I couldn’t say no”.
He told me how his companions had abandoned him when on seeing me in the hallway he had declared there and then to them that he would have no other, and being as he was in no condition to enjoy the pleasures of one of the ladies of the house he had retired to the comfort of a warm chair and drank port until he passed out. But now he said, imagine his joy on waking to see the one whom had made so much more than an ordinary impression upon him here at his knee and looking so lovely?
“Fuck Sherlock, you’re not going anywhere mate, that skinny little shit will just have to wait…if you won’t go to the hospital then you’re staying right here, twenty-four hours observation or I’ll drag you to A&E myself”
“Shit, sorry cramp” he stuttered apologetically to Charlotte as he mimicked a ‘wincing’ face and rubbed at his leg.
The red light blinked benignly in the darkness.
“Ah good, I thought I heard something…have you managed with the bed all right? If Sherlock doesn’t like it there’s the fold-out chair from Harriet’s room?”
When they got to the warehouse the entire place was empty and dark, no fires, no candles and definitely no people. Even most of the mattresses and pillows had gone. There had either been a tip-off or the police had gone through afterwards and cleared everything out, as a signal not to bother coming back again. But he had to go and check the rooms on the upper floor, feet turning automatically towards the old stairwell, thinking only of Sherlock.
(Oh god yes – fuck!)
“The unsociable hours and stuff?”
He stubbed out the butt on the window sill and hopped down, brushing stray ash off his jeans onto the carpet below. John scowled from the doorway, and emerged, clad in a towel hair still wet, in a cloud of deodorant and shampoo from his second shower of the morning.
Always In Our Hearts
The tailor was a small thin fellow, with a balding head who hovered like a little bird as soon as we walked in. He greeted John like a long-lost son, with many shakes of the hand and claps upon the back, marvelling at the turn of his neck and the fine set of his shoulders in the coat that he had purchased there but a few weeks earlier, as he circled around him. John bore it in good humour, the slightly lingering looks and the hand on an arm to admire the fine embroidery but which lingered on that little bit too long.
“Hang on, you complete berk” John called, running to catch up, “…I never said I was going home, you just assumed that”
Tom huffed, “And you can get that out your head lad too, your John isn’t like that nor I for that matter, the only way I can get away from those bloody twittering girls is hidden away in my room, you remember?”.
“Why in the hell when all you want from life is a damn good fuck is there never anyone here I’d let anywhere near me?” Sherlock said incredulously, wiping a string of saliva from the side of his mouth.
Mary was busy with her head bent down, leaning into the back seat of the car for a baby-bag of nappies and wet-wipes and god knows what other paraphernalia small children seem to need. Good. She wouldn’t want to see this.
to hurt yourself, you idiot?”  Sherlock was spinning with his head thrown back, arms stretched wide. John fished his free hand down his front jeans pocket and pulled out his phone, turning on the torch function. He swept it across the floor in a careful arc. “This…Sherlock…this is…amazing.”
What the fuck! This wasn’t exactly the area to cruise for that sort of business.
The retort came quick and sharp, “Well you never complained before”.
The Forester’s stood at the junction of Arun, and Athelston Way, backing on to Bennet’s Field, a large area of parkland where John had spent much of his childhood playing football and building camps in the woods . An ordinary pub, the kind you stopped by after work for a quiet pint, or took the family to for a meal, roast dinner on a Sunday afternoon, and a kick around on the grass out back after, in other words terminally dull.
“It isn’t on your phone Elsa, I’ve just checked” Kate appeared in the background, long red hair tied back in a ponytail, a simple jeans and t-shirt, she looked like a student not a stripper, John thought, although what the hell did he know?
“Relax, nobody else knows about this place” Sherlock yanked away from his grip and stalked over to the edge of an old raised flower bed, (a roof garden then?) now an empty graveyard of soil and old cigarettes. He perched on the narrow side and lit up with a defiant air, just daring John to object. John didn’t. It was the sexiest fucking thing he’d ever seen.
And he appeared to want John Watson.
Oh god, he was even spouting cliché in his own damn head.
“There are ways to get the money if you’re desperate….or you can always find some other way to pay”
“Yes madame, or was…he passed some ten months ago, taken by the small pox, he and my mother both”.
“Come to bed…I want to take you apart…” Victor growled as Sherlock pitched forward clinging to his waist.
“I do not wish to court attention John”.
“Really?” Sherlock stared up at the garish neon sign, incredulous, “That, is a fucking travesty, a gross abuse of the English language”
“Enough Sherlock, stop, please”
Anderson and Dimmock were already seated inside the van. Anderson tutted impatiently as Sherlock took his place in the back amongst the guitars and amps. Really, Anderson made it too bloody easy sometimes.
“Anything yet?…although I do realise you’re mind has recently been on other things”.
“Going somewhere” the tall slender figure stiffened in the dark.
“Oh I’m sure John wouldn’t mind dear, you always seemed to get along, before he went away, that is. I’ll ring Angela if you like, I just saw her yesterday, she was so excited to have both John and Harriet home this year for a real family Christmas, just like we’re going to have dear”
“Hang on a sec,” John called out. “Oh…shit.”
. He slipped it on my finger, the third from the left. The fit was perfection. It was truly beautiful.
‘Silly you’ she laughed, ‘he likes to sit on both sides of the fence does that one although he is very particular. You should think yourself lucky to be chosen by him, I heard tell he is monstrously rich’.
I would be proud to walk on his arm this night, the only chance we may ever have to be open with each other in a public space. The frisson was undeniable, for others to see us together and to wonder, is it part of the game, the deceit of the masquerade? Or is it truth? And to look in their eyes as they imagine us together, naked and fucking in the dark. I pitied them their commonplace existence, these strangers I had yet to meet.
It helps to pass the time.
He didn’t want to smile dammit, but the corners of his mouth quirked upwards despite his best efforts.
He hates it when she wins. So he tells her.
“He was most gentle, and although I had lain with at least a dozen girls he knew he was the first man to have me….But yes, I liked it better from the first, as I knew I would…does that surprise you, that a young man should know his own mind and seek to have it?”
The door whipped open and a young student nurse, just there to check on the patient chart came scuttling out, red-faced and wide-eyed, patently terrified. She looked between them both before scurrying off down the corridor and out of sight.
“I won’t…look…I’m right here”
Sara picked up her bag from the floor and pushed back her seat with a screech of metal on wood.
Victor’s voice was cold and flat as he pushed Sherlock away and covered his face with his hands.
Can John Watson solve the mystery in time to have a happy holiday?
This time, John had made it as far as S. He’d gone through the whole damn twenty-seven letters at least four times now and was rapidly losing the will to live as well all upper body sensation. He traced out one final, desperate, ‘kill-me-please’ just at the moment his shoulder decided to give up the ghost for good and his arm went out from under him. He planted face down in Angela-Andrea-Sandra’s impressively hairy muff.
Then Sherlock liked to curl around him while they watched crap movies, and sometimes they would both fall asleep like that. He had never actually turned up in the middle of a school day before.
He broke into a run, Greg turning in surprise at the sound of rapid footfall as he leant against the wall outside the door and holding a hand up for him to stop before he could reach for the handle and let himself in.
“Shit, you’re not going to vom are you? Christ, just hang on”.
“I hate guessing,” Sherlock pouted, and his bottom lip poked out like a petulant child. His front teeth closed over it, as he bit down in concentration, and John found he had to look away again because some things were too much. If Sherlock saw his face he would
“Yes….yes I will” he answered, and Sherlock pressed his face into the pillow barely stifling a moan that could almost have been a sob.
Victor seemed to have forgotten the main point of his question and Sherlock didn’t want to remind him. Usually he was more than eager to share the filthy details of their weekend activities, but this time it felt different, like John wouldn’t want him to cheapen what had happened by blabbing about it, not even to his best mate.
“Yes”
He heaved a sigh of relief as Greg beat Sherlock to it.
It was time.
Get it together John for fuck’s sake. He only gave himself a second, just to catch his breath enough to move again, he needed light, the room still steeped in darkness, should check him over properly and shit, yeah, call a fucking Ambulance. So he rose, snapping on the light, and scrambled up the bed to reach his phone on the table at its side, pressed 999 with a shaking thumb.
“Don’t! Not yet” John growled, seeing what was about to happen. He had an overwhelming urge to call the shots this time, to have Sherlock shivering underneath him, begging John to give him what he craved.
“What?”
The stable out back was quite warm and dry, smelling strongly of horse and sweat and leather and something else that Sherlock couldn’t quite define. It was his favourite place to be, curled up in a corner somewhere, just listening to the horses snuffle and breathe. It made him feel calm and at peace.
Oh fuck he was going to come, balls so tight and tense…
That calculating, icy stare locked on his and John felt a flutter in his chest as Sherlock smiled and said “Oh yes…I’m sure he will”
“Need some help?”
“Aren’t there places where kids like him can go, Local Authority places, hostels and stuff?”
“Oh god, what parent would do that?”
And just to show this meant something, even though it didn’t, he kissed him. A long slow snog with tongues and a little bit of biting.
Sherlock hummed his assent as drool dripped down his chin and then ran down his neck. He would damn well make sure that those fingers were good and wet. John pulled them out with a audible pop and spread his arse apart with one hand. A cool, wet finger drew a teased a trail from cleft to the base of his cock and he shivered violently. John drew back.
The venom in his voice took him by surprise, the tension inside him desperate for release. He was hanging on by a thread here and Sherlock looked like John had physically slapped him with his words. His guts boiled again.
“Tell me what you want” he rasped
And to add to his problems, just this morning Mycroft had summoned him to the study, tight-lipped and tense, on his desk another plain envelope, much smaller than the last containing a small silver flash drive.
“And what would the penalty be if I broke that law?” John gasped softly, grinding back against Sherlock’s disappointingly clothed and rapidly hardening cock.
“I would laugh, but there’s actually an element of truth in there isn’t there?”
He was sweating slightly when he got back to the flat, slotting the key in the big iron door. It always got stuck so he gave it a shove, announcing his arrival with a metallic clang as it bounced off the brick wall. Greg was standing at the top of the stairs harassed and indignant, watching as two young lads helped themselves to the last of his beers in the kitchen and sauntered back to the living space to flop down heavily on the sofa as if they owned the place.
(anything John…yes)
Irene passes him the joint and he takes a drag, inhales, and holds it there. Sweet oblivion curls around his insides.
Christ, he actually used to be good at this shit once upon a time, a different girl almost every weekend until Sara came along…not that he ever did much… ‘stuff’, but that wasn’t really the point….
“You fucking bastard, the whole street probably heard that….what will Mycroft think, hearing you buggering his baby brother like this…”
He should move, he needed to move.
“But…you don’t know your way around, and it’s fucking dangerous in the dark….and I didn’t think you even knew the password” he was sounding a bit pathetic now, even to his own ears, offering excuse after excuse as to why this infuriating boy should be in need of his help. The annoying thing was, that he couldn’t put his finger on why it bothered him so much.
“Perfect….shall we?” he holds out his arm like a gentleman and waits, huffing with impatience as she takes the damn shoes off again to walk down the stairs.
“I’m deeply offended John”, he said, rising from the bed in one graceful move to catch John in a hug, he kissed the frown on his face until it softened and was reciprocated with a degree of enthusiasm, “Anyway”, he said, breaking away, satisfied, “Mum’s love me, I’m charming”.
“Hey, take it as a compliment and run with it, god knows it’s been a long time coming”
And this time it was all him, bringing two hands up to cup Sherlock’s face, tilting his head and bringing their lips together. It was his tongue that slid in first tasting stale, smoky breath and pizza and it was fine, all fine when Sherlock bit back and slowly ran his hands down the length of his body, cupping his arse through his jeans and yanking their hips together just a little too hard, and making sweet little moans into his open mouth, because this was good, and it was real and he could feel it, that missing piece he’d been chasing, the reason why everything felt wrong…until suddenly it didn’t anymore.
“Sherlock yes….funny how his name always crops up….I’ve had it up to here with all this, so I’ll tell you what John….why don’t you go and fuck your former flat-mate, because everyone knows that’s what you really want”
“Ah Greg, glad I caught you before you leave – a word alone if you would”.
“Ah… fuck John…going to come…ah”
“I was attempting subtlety and consideration for the feelings of others John, thank you for your helpful contribution” (too sarcastic?) John looked crestfallen
“Something wrong?” he asked, fighting back the urge to bite down on his bottom lip. John tracked the movement anyway, and cleared his throat. “Um, yeah, you’ve got….let me just…”
“Nonsense, consider this payment for services rendered, namely preventing this young idiot here from killing himself….come now, the carriage is waiting, I’ll wait for you both outside”
Sherlock wondered when it had started, if John had slept with her while he was still sleeping with him. That was certainly the way it looked.
John tried to imagine how he would feel if faced with the person who he’d heard fucking his sister the night before – God no! Not Mycroft, definitely not Mycroft, and anyway, there was always the slim possibility that Sherlock was wrong.
“Oi! I was talking to you Homo”
Greg nodded and turned on the engine and the battered old car sprung to life. He paused and turned to look at Sherlock again. “Look kid, I know it’s none of my business…but I thought you sort of had…a thing…with John, couldn’t he help you out?”
John came out on top, literally, hands braced on either side of Sherlock’s head as he hovered over the body, spread out beneath him like an invitation, a promise. Sherlock arched his head back, exposing his neck, wordlessly begging to be taken, and well, John had never been one to hold back when he wanted something, or in this case, someone, so he lowered himself down with a groan, latching on like a starving man or some sort of animal marking his territory in bruises and blood.
“I want you to come straight home after work today John”
Sherlock didn’t want this to be the end.
Sherlock snorted through his nose and desperately tried to turn it into a cough.
He’d been laughing. While Sherlock was wheeled off unconscious on a stretcher in front of his eyes the bastard didn’t even lift his head. Well John would lift it for him and knock it clean off his fucking shoulders.
But still, I look back now upon our first days at St James as happy ones. Our rooms themselves were adequate, plainly furnished and comfortable each with a bed of four posts, a wardrobe for clothing and a chaise set before a small hearth in which a merry fire burnt warm and inviting. John saw no sense in spending more of our limited finance to furnish them with anything finer, and I must applaud his frugality in this regard, he being ever the practical one.
Red, he bloody well hated that colour.
Sherlock watched the study door close with a frown. They were discussing him, he was sure of it. Mycroft would be asking Greg to watch him even more carefully tonight to avoid any more escape attempts or inappropriate sexual exploits (the more inappropriate the better where John Watson was concerned). Sherlock had already had a quick wank in the shower after school, relieving a day of pent-up frustration, and fantasising about John, how he had looked last night, so beautiful and so scared when he had finally stood naked before Sherlock in the dark bedroom, and how Sherlock had kissed away his doubts and fears, had taken him apart and left him breathless beneath him. He wanted to do that again, soon, and Mycroft and his minions were certainly not going to stop him.
“Up now Sherlock, before the poor beast tears its mouth to shreds”
“John…please”
“I need his guitar from the back of the van….if he expects me to work on some new riffs for him I need a fucking six string”
John sat down in his chair, and Walter took the chair across, Sherlock’s. There was no sense in standing when there was no telling if the git would just lie like that for hours. John remembered when he had sprawled there for almost forty-eight hours, the only evidence of life were the empty coffee cups and crusts of toast that he had put there on his way out to work and afterwards when he popped back in to get changed before going for drinks down the pub with Mike Stamford.
“Oh, I think it’s very necessary….who’s the coward now?”
“Oh please… you won’t last another two seconds… in fact…”
“Ah god, condoms sorry…bit out of practice…haven’t done this for a while”.
“I’m ready now”, I said.
“Steady on, show your mother a little respect John”
“In Florida” Mabel began, and Sherlock let out a shaky exhale, a new life in America didn’t sound too bad and Mrs Hudson had often expressed a burning desire to live abroad, not that she would of course, being the very bones of Baker Street.
They both held their breath, frozen in the aftermath as an impatient foot tapped a beat onto the ground.
Sherlock pumped a good handful of shower gel from a glass dispenser on the wall and soaped up his hands with fragrant citrus foam. He ran his coated palms down John’s neck and sides, rubbing over wet, slippery skin in smooth, firm circles. He could tell exactly where John was still tender and sore simply by feel and the barely perceptible twitches he made when Sherlock’s fingers traced over the patchwork of multi-coloured bruises scattered across his torso. John’s hands shot up to still the movement, fingers curled loosely around Sherlock’s wrists, guiding them back to his hips.
Sherlock’s skin was already hot to the touch overlaid with a film of silky sweat. The smell of sex hung heavy in the air between them. John inhaled deeply, tasting it on the back of his throat and tongue. He had to get these jeans off now to relieve the almost painful press of his hot aching cock against the rough-edged denim seam. He squeezed a little tighter on Sherlock’s hips before pushing him back, off his lap, while curling a hand under the back of his head until he was spread out on his back on the floor. Sherlock peered up at him, heavy-lidded and panting , so aroused his cock was leaking in a steady stream, leaving a slick trail on his abdomen..
He was panting hard.
John crossed the room in three quick strides and cupped Sherlock’s jaw, yanking his head down to claim his mouth in a hard, possessive kiss, the other hand tangled in his hair pulling hard enough to make his eyes water. John stepped back again releasing him, breath heavy and panting, and Sherlock whined pathetically, actually fucking whined, and that was one of the least embarrassing noises John always seemed to pull from him. He was gone, a mess, totally besotted and he couldn’t do a damn thing about it.
His head snapped up at the sound of the metal door downstairs as it clanged shut.
“So” John began, “I just got back yesterday (I know, thought Sherlock, I watched you arrive) and I thought it might be cool to get together, invite some of the gang round….”
“Perhaps if I could actually see it.” John squinted, hard, in the dark, as if narrowing his eyes even more would somehow help him to see things better. It didn’t. “So, if it’s not a church, but it’s still sort of looks like one, then what is it? He said, tapping a finger against his lip in thought.
“Yeah, you’ve already made your opinion very clear mate”, Greg interjected, successfully nipping Sherlock’s stream of abuse in the bud, “Now bugger off, both of you, and go do what normal teenage boys do…for a change” Greg drew up by the kerb and gestured for them to leave, he looked at his watch with an impatient growl. John could sense the unspoken ‘what the hell does he mean by that?’ that radiated from Sherlock’s incredulous face, but he knew Greg probably meant something along the lines of X-Box, pizza and beer, three of the least likely things Sherlock would ever deign to engage in. But hey, he had mates more than willing to do that sort of thing and he much preferred Sherlock’s version of normal anyway.
“Yes I’m beginning to see that” “Doesn’t it bother you?”
Tom laid a hand gently on my arm. “You must come away now Sherlock, there is nothing more to be done here.”
The visceral smell of sex in the air fuelled his fantasy and made it real.
Sherlock’s eyes flickered over his face, he searched his eyes, breathing heavily and slowly trailed down to settle over his mouth. John felt pinned down. He held his breath and unconsciously worried at the skin on his bottom lip. And for one terrifying moment, he though it could actually happen, that Sherlock might kiss him, but instead he just sighed and stepped away, continuing up the stairs.
“Battered sausage” John mumbled through a starchy mouthful, “try it…s’nice”
Sherlock nodded mutely as John slid his fingers down to the sexy green tights that had been the cause of all this. Sherlock’s frantic rocking had worked him loose, the head of his cock poked up above the waistband, pre-come leaving a growing dark stain and leaving John with no doubt that for most of that day he hadn’t been wearing any pants. (Thank god he had worn the stripy shorts for work).
(I'm posting this a day later than planned because I've been trapped in Christmas shopping hell - Bah Humbug!)
“Right, about this morning…” he began.
He grabbed Sherlock’s hand and pulled him towards the stairs, thankful that Mrs Hudson was out, because of the noise they were making in their haste to get inside the flat, tripping over their own clumsy feet and laughing like two naughty school boys. The door slammed shut and John was on him, pushing him backwards into the kitchen until he was backed-up against the table-top. A set of glass vials in a wooden test-tube tray teetered on the edge, but thankfully didn’t fall. Not that he would care anyway, not when Sherlock was making such desperate little noises and dragging his nails down John’s back while he worried at the skin of that soft white neck, sucking his mark there so that even in the light of day they couldn’t hide the fact that they had done this.
Sherlock had attended Hampdon College boys boarding school between the ages of nine and sixteen (well, he had made it part way through year 11 anyway, leaving (expelled) just after Easter and sitting his GCSE’s privately while Mycroft looked for another school that would take him at short notice). But surprisingly (or not, really) few schools were willing to take on a boy recently expelled for smoking weed behind the Chemistry lab while already on a written warning after being caught in bed with two other boys (at the same time, not on separate occasions – a very enjoyable evening as Sherlock recalled).
He pulled back with a jerk and wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. It was a reflex reaction, and then he felt like an idiot because what if Sherlock was offended, and why did he care anyway, it was just a blow-back wasn’t it?, and not even a proper one really. Not an actual kiss or anything.
He sighed and rolled his eyes. Eating was boring, a pure mechanical exercise to fuel his transport, nothing more. Sherlock ate the bare minimum, because it was simply dull to sit there like a cow in a field chewing the cud.
And the idiot was shaking it, with a stupid, buggering grin on his face.
‘And I will not disappoint…please John’, tears of frustration and humiliation pricked at my eyes, ashamed at my failure, ‘please let us try once more’.
“Yeah right…later Sherlock”, he smiled and waved as the boy bent down to give Dawn a final pat on the head before he turned to walk back down the path.
Eight pairs of eyes turned to look as they crossed the room to their seats. Sherlock didn’t care, it wasn’t as if it was a secret that he was gay, it was common knowledge amongst friends and family and Mummy had long ago stopped bemoaning the fact that she would never have a daughter-in law one day, but Mrs Jessop still stared at them wide-eyed, as if they were a pair of freakish oddities
Sherlock still refused to believe that any of this was the fault of Victor Trevor. He was wild long before that, and if anything, his mission to get into Victor’s pants had slowed him down for a few months, a focus for his attentions, a game to see how far he had to push before Victor gave in, four months from their first meeting as it turned out, probably sooner if he had been legal, but unfortunately for him Victor’s moral compass had railed against sodomising underage boys (but had been perfectly fine with a happy new year hand job, so it had seemed).
John’s hand twitched at his side as he fought the urge to reach up and touch Sherlock’s face.
- As a violinist myself, who never invested in a shoulder rest I can attest to how bloody uncomfortable this is, especially if you're quite bony in that area as I am (and Sherlock is).
Christ that was it, he could feel it building within him, he was coming, he was coming…Now, Now, Now.
“And who the fuck is that?”
John was biting his lip, but the tremor Sherlock heard in his voice had nothing to do with nerves.
The safe solid form of Greg Lestrade stood behind him, in plain clothes now, smelling of coffee and the faint whiff of diesel fumes. He must have just come off shift, tired, dark eyes looking heavy and face a little pinched with worry and fatigue. He nodded to Mycroft but didn’t go over, and taking John by the arm he led him gently over to the bed and made him sit down. He sat down by him and scrubbed his hands through his hair as they watched the medics settling Sherlock on the stretcher.
“Yeah but if you got caught the entire House suffers, we’ll get docked a shit-load of Championship points, and we’re currently a hundred and fifty up”
“Maybe, can we go now?” John said, a little quickly, clearly keen to be off now they’d at least exchanged pleasantries and acknowledged her presence. Sherlock felt uneasy, in a way he couldn’t quite grasp, there was a sadness there, a distance, not through a lack of love between them, but something else.
“Behave yourself Sherlock” John chuckled, winding a hand under his abdomen to help him to his knees and guide his thighs apart. He felt so exposed and at John’s mercy with his wrists bound and his arse in the air, spread wide and waiting to be filled. His loosened hole twitched and fluttered at the thought, a slick trail of lube dripping down his balls and sliding down his inner thigh.
“Yeah, just, I think. Fucking hell that was a bit rough”
Mycroft arched a brow as if to say ‘are you really so stupid?’, and smiled, a rictus grin. “To ruin your chances at Cambridge, to embarrass the family, threaten my position in government” this final reason was thickly laced with venom. Sherlock almost felt sorry for this unknown person, they obviously had no idea what Mycroft was capable of, splinter’s under the fingernails if they were lucky, or if Mycroft was feeling particularly generous some impromptu root canal work, minus the aneasthetic.
He pulled me to my feet and said darkly, “It is your turn. Now take off your clothes, I need to see you.”
“It’s just too damn hot in here”, Sherlock sighed and stretched, arching his back. It was all very ‘look at me’ but it worked. John could feel his heart rate pick up, thumping erratically, fast, slow, skip a beat, repeat.
His tone was light in jest, but his eyes were dark as bowed his head to me, and taking up one of my folded hands, placed it upon his chest. He closed his eyes and sighed, hunching down further to lay his head against the back of the chaise and jolted only a little as my hands decided on another path than the one that he had placed me on, working deftly at the buttons below his belt. For I knew what I wished to do, to take him in my mouth as he had me, to feel the weight of his hard, velvet shaft upon my tongue and taste the bitter liquid passions that would spill there. And so I freed him, warm and pulsing, the musky scent a balm to my senses, cock-head already ruby red and glistening at the slit. I marvelled at how once this would have scared me, the size, the animal ferocity, the very maleness of him, and that now I craved it all, the bone deep desire to be taken and fucked. He shivered at the first gentle press of my tongue, just a touch light and quick then off again, retreating to look back in wonder as it twitched and jerked as if it possessed a will all its own. Then boldly, my hand at the root for guidance, I spread my lips wide and crammed my mouth full.
“Don’t give a fuck” Sherlock lied, but his patience was gone, if he’d wanted a tease he could have tried another round with last week’s straight guy, but Sherlock was done with waiting for tonight. He pressed his lips against the older man’s, tilted his head and flicked his tongue out.
“It irks”, I snapped, stealing a kiss to his brow in lieu, “That we should pander to such intolerable attempts to play cupid week upon week, he knows how things stand between us, you and I, but still he persists in his quest to throw more new and pretty acquaintances into your path”.
Perhaps I should have thought to enquire as to our destination for I knew not where we were. Still in the centre of the city I guessed, going by the speed of the carriage and the time it had taken us to get there. John climbed down from on top of me with a shy smile full of apology for my disordered state, although I must admit, he himself looked no better than I for the experience. We brushed ourselves off as best we could, I tucked in my shirt and waited while John in an act of chivalry undid the clasps on my trunk and drew out a jacket and waistcoat, items I had failed to put on in the initial desperate flight. For our heightened colour and sweat-soaked skin there was nothing to be done, the saving grace being that neither one had spilled, not for lack of trying I might add, but still the unmistakable scent of sex hung in the air.
Something looked different, the light in the room was suddenly warmer and John gasped in surprise and realisation.
He was being deliberately provocative and rude, in the way normally reserved for…well everyone other than John to tell the truth. This affected air of indifference was so hard to maintain while his heart threatened to beat out of his chest. A cold sweat prickled at his skin and slowly ran down his back.
John reached over and dragged him up from the sofa, kissed him hard and teasingly pinched a nipple between his thumb and forefinger. Sherlock gasped as John pulled and twisted slightly.
“God that voice”, John said, “Do you have any fucking idea?”, he crawled across the bed and Sherlock rolled forward onto his stomach, arms tucked beneath his body his head turned to face him. John straddled him, arse resting on the backs of his thighs and stroked his hand up the length of his strong smooth back, thumbing and kneading the tight, perfect muscles. He kneaded his fingers in the back of Sherlock’s neck and the boy groaned into the pillows. “I do believe I was promised a blow- job”, he whispered.
“Great minds think alike… isn’t that the saying?”
“We are….. truly disgusting”
“Just how many schools are we talking about? Mycroft said you were at the only one who would take you this year”
“And you”, said Victor, sitting up and rubbing his eyes, “Look exactly like someone who got his arse fucked last night. Nice decoration”, he added, pointing to Sherlock’s throat.

It was not ingratitude, neither was it deference. If she did not see our faces we were never here at all.
John whirled around as Mike padded in, pausing in the doorway in shock and surprise.
“Oh shit…this doesn’t mean something illegal does it? I’ll kill you myself if this night ends with both of us under arrest”.
