The demon clenched his jaw briefly with anger before he visibly forced himself to calm down. He smoothed his shaking hands over his suit and rolled his shoulders. “His grace is still there. Barely. I can feel it, radiating power, but it feels almost like someone threw a blanket over it. Or caged it.” He narrowed his eyes and stared at the Angel, his voice terse and clipped. “Your grace is like... hm, a muscle. When you don’t use it, it goes away. You’ll be human soon.”
Overwhelming sorrow struck at Dean’s heart, making it beat hard and painfully as he stared into the night with regret. The sweet taste of freedom had been too much for Icarus and the ghost of his laughter was, too, taken by the night sky.
The newspaper was dated from eight years before, a small nobody local paper. The front line was ‘NOVAK SCANDAL: SINS OF THE YOUTH!”. There weren't any pictures but the article went on about how the youngest of the sons had been caught in the bathroom nude with another boy, both found in a very compromising position. The son’s name was Castiel Novak, a rebellious teenager who shocked his poor mother with the entire situation. Supposedly the family was extremely religious and there were speculations about whether or not there would be a disowning.
Meg reached over to gently trace her fingers across the tattoo that peeked out from under his right sleeve, following the trail to his wrist with a touch that made him shiver slightly. The tattoo was a cage with a raven inside, his falling feathers lining a trail from his bicep to his wrist, blue black stylized feathers. The background of the cage was a wash of watercolours, mostly blue and purple, looking like a galaxy hiding behind the captured raven. A few stars were freckled in with the background.. He batted away her hand and plucked up his coffee, sipping at it in an attempt to ignore his blush at her crass words.
“Who are you?” The Hunter had a surprisingly deep, gruff voice. Castiel brushed his fingers over the page, eyes scanning the words as he replied with the obvious, “Castiel”. He noted the change from grudgingly curious to frustrated when Dean amended his statement, “Yeah. I figured that much. I mean
He picked out a faded red t-shirt that just said ‘i’m awesome’ on it and a comfortable pair of grey sweat pants, skipping the boxers. Some things just needed a little freedom sometimes. He stretched lazily after getting dressed, reaching up for the ceiling with a groan. He fingered a hole in the hem of his shirt as he walked back down the hallway. He found Sam bent over the table, writing furiously on a torn piece of paper, his journal set aside. The kid worked too hard sometimes. As he looked over his shoulder, he saw a mess of circled ideas and crooked lines, some disaster of a brainstorm on the paper.
“Hey, it was kosher this time.” Dean protested meekly, “I just wanted to look something up and didn’t feel like trying to do it on my phone. Want a pizza for lunch?” He extended his olive branch to smooth over Sam’s ruffled attitude. 30 minutes later, they were both digging into some Domino's pizza, with Sam multitasking, eating and typing.
“The usual. All in $100 bills, wrapped in ten bundles of a thousand. Try to not spend it all at once, ok?” The payment shut Castiel up as he grumpily scooped the bag up with a muttered ‘thanks’. “Mother has a party next month, you’d better make sure you’re there. On time. In a suit. She’s signing over CEO to me.” Michael dropped the news with nonchalance but failed to hide the glimmer of smugness.
Dean sucked in a hard breath, harsh words just resting on the tip of his tongue, ready to be shouted or screamed. He opened his mouth, moments from spewing out the hateful sentences but then he blinked and all the fight drained out of the Hunter. Instead of speaking, he dropped the back of the chair and stumbled over to Bobby. A few gulps of whiskey, a muttered curse or two, and he was back to being the usual Dean. Which wasn’t saying much, the usual Dean was just wrecked but stubbornly determined.
He swiped absently at his forehead, brushing away the sweat that had collected, threatening to drip into his eyes, flicking his arm afterwards. A few hundred feet ahead was what appeared to be a gas station, the kind with the old fashioned red pumps. The building looked grimy, two dusty cars sitting in the parking lot. He hastened his pace, his parched throat reminding him that he badly needed water.
“Traps and talismans from every faith on the globe,” the old mechanic was saying. He had finished the last of his ‘art project’ and walked over to the table Dean was preparing. He hesitated for a moment before tacking on, “How you doing?” The frantic behaviour of the Hunter was setting Bobby on edge. Dean was twitchy and restless in the confines of the shed; he arranged and re-arranged the tables over and over with an obsessive need to move and be useful.
Castiel pointed over to his painting that was leaning up against the table in Michaels’ foyer, “Does your client want this or not?” He asked, voice a little rude with impatience for his callous brother. Even though he was his own worst critic, Castiel actually almost liked this piece. It was a majestic painting of an angel with sweeping black wings. The inspiration had come out of nowhere and he soon found himself painting someone that looked vaguely like him, if only because the blue eyes and messy black hair complimented the black feathers that stretched up as if to reach for the sky. Complete with a silver halo, glowing faintly against the backdrop of stormy grey clouds.
Galadriel’s rich voice overtook the soft music, “The world is changed… I feel it in the water… I feel it in the Earth… I smell it in the air….”
“Great. That didn’t take too long. Leave your balls at home?” Cass made a noise of dissatisfaction at Dean’s taunt, making the Hunter frown briefly. Then he sighed noisily through his nose and cut away his other taunts that were already lined up to be said. “Alright. Alright. We want to know what is wrong with his grace.” He jerked a hand sideways to point toward Castiel, who now studied Dean with his head cocked to the side.
“Forgive me, I must leave to investigate this mystery. I apologise that you sustained injury during my attack.” He rose while speaking, cautiously extending his wings in a slow stretch. They quivered for a moment in an unfelt breeze before rising and falling in a powerful beat. Yet, instead of disappearing with that tell-tale sound of feathers through air, the Angel instead dropped to his knees with an inhumane scream that shattered the windows of the warehouse. Dean slapped his palms over his ears, a scream ripped free as blood immediately rushed from his nose and ears.
Oh. Icarus. The name came to him in a rush and the story with it, the tragedy that followed the freedom of flight.
There was one damned soul that Alastair took a particular liking to. He made his rounds each and every day, sauntering through the half dried blood that soaked the floor. He made the same offer countless times, the offer to be released from their chains and rack. It was a simple offer, all they had to do to earn their freedom was help him torture the endless souls sent to Hell. Take up the tools of pain and use them to inflict delicious pain. Yet there was one soul in particular whose response to his offer was always a source of amusement.
Despite her efforts, he did not leave the club with a date or a man on his arm. Instead they stumbled out together arm and arm and dove head first into their uber, her parking meter forgotten and probably overdue. Meg slept on his bed while he took the couch, something he was due to regret by morning when his back was aching. His dreams were vague that night and he woke up thinking strangely of an unknown pair of forest green eyes and a spread of freckles looking like stars against tanned skin. Something unfamiliar but tempting.
He groaned grumpily, grogginess tugging at his limbs like a heavy weight as he threw the blanket off his legs. Rather than get up like a normal person, he instead rolled straight out of bed and onto the floor with a crash, nevermind the downstairs neighbors. His knees banged against the floor painfully and he tiredly blinked at the floor, his thoughts slower than molasses. The alarm beeped jarringly at him from his end table and he reached over to turn it off, hitting it a little harder than was necessary.
“Dean, Dean.” Cass rushed to whisper, desperate to make him understand his next words. “I raised you from the pits of Hell. I am the one who gripped you tight and rescued you from Perdition. I saw your soul in the purest way, even through the corruption of Alastair. Your soul is beautiful and pure, Dean. I rebuilt it, I purged the corruption. Do not be bound by the guilt of Hell, it no longer stains you.” He pressed his hands tighter against the bottle still clutched in his grasp. “If anyone is worthy of guilt, it is me. You would not have needed to relive those memories if I hadn’t asked you.”
“It is an honour to meet you. You’re quite a legend downstairs.” He lazily stretched his hands through the air as if he presented a banner. “Dean Winchester. ‘The One That Got Away”. The demon stopped his inspection and stood in front of Dean with a sleepy looking smile that matched his eyes. He raked his gaze once more down Dean’s body with an admiring glint and he waited for the inevitable words.
She turned her own set of puppy eyes on him, a pleading look that melted his resolve. “Oh, I suppose we can do that. I’ll put off the grocery shopping for tomorrow. Will you let Rain out while I clean this up?” Meg clapped happily at the proclaimed lazy day and hopped down from the stool. She clipped a leash onto the bright pink collar of Rain,  taking her outside. He tidied up the mess they’d made then went upstairs to grab a new canvas and a few sketching pencils. An idea was already brewing in his mind.
The hallway carpet stuck to his feet as he padded to his room, making him crinkle his nose in disgust. He hated the texture and the first thing he pulled on were a pair of thick black socks, one of which had a hole in the heel that sort of defeated the purpose of it all. He hummed to himself as he rifled through his collection of old band t-shirts and cheap walmart shirts, hunting for something comfortable to wear.
Whomever it was, they argued viciously with Castiel and their raised voices were alarmingly loud in the crossroads. It wasn’t in a language that he recognized and he took a wary step forward. Castiel flinched at the crunch of boots, his too wide eyes turning toward Dean as if he had suddenly remembered him. The argument died down as Cass walked toward him, wings outstretched again, flared with his temper. Feathers rained down on the ground with each step.
He sighed as he made his way to Sam, plunking himself down in the pew next to him. On his other side was Bobby, looking just as awkward in his suit as Sam. Bobby wasn’t the type to really dress up, preferring his jeans, flannels, and old button-ups with the odd t-shirt or two. Seeing him without his signature vest was downright weird for Dean, especially since the last time Bobby wore a suit was to his parent’s funeral. The memories were immediately smothered. Sam and Bobby started to talk quietly to each other, while Dean fished out his phone to play his game.
. It wasn’t overwhelmingly obvious, in fact he was suppressing much of the sounds and his face barely betrayed his emotion. It was only the wet trail down his cheek betraying the path of a tear and the nasally catch of his breathing unable to pass through his nose. Castiel hesitated at the realization, uncertain how to proceed.
He deduced the alcohol had broken the inhibitions that prevented the Hunter from previously breaking down. The two of them had nearly drained the bottle by now, only a few sips left in the clear glass. He worried his bottom lip with the press of his teeth, biting absently in a gesture learned from Dean. What was he supposed to do? What was the human approach to grief, to pain, sorrow? He did not know what was appropriate and he was slowed down with the drunken weight of whiskey.
That was something Dean always did that confused Sam. Every single night when dinner was done, he left to go take a shower. He always complained that he hated how he smelled like whatever it was he had cooked and it was worse combined with the stink of grease and exhaust from his job. And sure enough, as soon as he finished wiping down the table, he could hear the hiss and sputter of the shower starting up quickly followed by the loud sound of Dean’s radio blasting his old ass music.
Thankfully though, there was an Advance Auto Parts just off the highway. He coasted through the exit a little too fast but he didn’t particularly care. He parked up at the front and hurried into the store, all too aware of his short timeframe to fix his errors. The cashier greeted him with a bored to death voice that he ignored as he immediately spit out the hoses he needed.
“Dean-o, how you doing?” Alastair sang merrily as he leaned forward to inspect him with a smirk. “Ready to accept my offer today? It’s only been, hm, almost thirty years?” The former Hunter raised his head slowly, staring at Alastair with a temporarily blank expression. Then hate twisted his features, turning his eyes dark with absolute rage. His swollen mouth worked for a moment before he spat a glob of blood and phlegm at the demon.
Every day in Hell left Castiel a little more drained, he felt the strain on his Grace as he fought to stay hidden from the denizens of Hell. The Angel never took rest, he was always on guard. Always dodging into the endless shadows, sometimes flying away with a downward jerk of his wings. Nothing would stop his quest as he searched for that one soul he needed. The one that glowed to his Angelic sight unlike any other soul. That shining star in a sea of consuming darkness, a beacon in the void of suffering.
Castiel was already asleep, curled up in the middle of the bed, snoring ever so softly. His wings were curled protectively over his body, shining dully in the light of a lamp next to the bed. Dean snorted softly, shaking his head at the sight of an Angel sleeping. It was oddity that was for certain. But the Hunter barely had the energy to ponder the situation before darkness washed over him, the pull of sleep too strong to resist. Within moments, the room was filled with the quiet sound of two different snores; one was quick and snuffly, the other slow and growly.
Dean took a long draw from his beer, sighing happily as the cold liquid slipped down his throat. He immediately stole a handful of popcorn out of Sam’s bowl, earning himself a solid smack on his hand. They did that throughout the three hour long movie, bickering with each other between repeating the lines dramatically to each other. At one point, Sam was tipsily sprawled across Dean’s lap, dramatically repeating Gandalf’s powerful cry of, “You shall not pass!” and knocking the almost empty bowl of popcorn onto the ground, scattering the kernels across the carpet .Dean shoved him off, dumping him on the floor as they both cracked up during what should have been a somber scene.
“Sorry, Sammy. I was thirsty.” Dean half heartedly bantered, even as he downed the remains of his current cup. He grimaced, it had gone cold while he was playing his game. Sam grumped out something too quiet for him to hear but before he could say anything, his phone started blasting Highway to Hell, his ringtone. He blinked at it stupidly for a moment, wondering who in the hell would be calling him at 7:15 in the friggin’ morning, until Bobby’s name finally registered. He picked up with a yawned ‘hello?’.
He smoothed dull grey and muted blues over the scenery, which was a scarce few tufts of grass, a broken sidewalk, an angry sky with heavy clouds. When the clock turned from three in the morning to four in the morning, he cleaned up the paint, left the brushes in a pool of water, and collapsed onto his rumpled bed. Within a few minutes, his short stuffy snore filled the room, mixing into the forgotten music, still murmuring through the speakers. The painting was left to dry, crookedly laid across the desk. It was painstakingly realistic… except for the tufts of grass, coloured a muted grey, looking forgotten in the vibrant colours staining the rest of the page.
Dean went to speak, already heated words ready to lash out with sarcasm but Cass silenced him with a pointed look. He instead spoke up himself, voice neutral with only a vague hint of gratitude. “Thank you, Uriel, for your interference. Perhaps you may instead provide the information we were seeking.” He splayed his hand out toward the demon to indicate it, “We have discovered my grace had been locked away. The demon was about to reveal who attacked me. Without my grace, I, myself, cannot find the answer but surely you are able.”
There was only one place safe enough to take care of a broken Angel. A broken Angel that was unwilling to admit he was broken. A place where broken cars litter a gravel lined lot, where weeds sway lazily in the breeze, and a house sits on a dusty patch of grass, sagging with that lived in, homey look. That place was owned by Bobby Singer, an old mechanic who liked his alcohol too much and had a slight hoarding problem. It was the perfect place to take a broken Angel, a perfect place to slap on a mental band aid and look into a solution to fix what was broken.
Dean threw his hands up dramatically, “God, Sam, work me like a slave. Make me dinner, Dean. Make me popcorn, Dean. Do this Dean, do that Dean.” His words fell on deaf ears as Sam went to their living room to put the DVD in. He smiled as the familiar soundtrack started up as he started unwrapping the plastic from the microwave popcorn, leaving the trash on the countertop. He looked up at the clock and saw it wasn’t too late, hopefully they wouldn’t get a noise complaint.
A low whine greeted him as he settled his things on the bartop separating the kitchen from the tiny dining room. “Hey baby,” he reached down and ruffled the ears of his dog, smiling as she enthusiastically licked every millimeter of his hands twice over.. “Who's a good girl, huh? Who's a good girl.” She waggled the nub of her tail excitedly and ran circles around his legs before sitting down to watch him wash his hands and unload the breakfast onto a few recyclable paper plates. She was a gorgeous brindle boxer with bright eyes and a loving personality, plus she had puppy eyes that could soften even the hardiest of hearts.
Dean gritted his teeth when the edge of the knife dug carefully into his skin, pushing through the thin layer to bite into the muscle. He ground out “fuck you” before sinking his teeth into his lips, swallowing down a pained yell. Alastair just smiled a bit more, bracing his other hand against the Hunter’s chest, pushing harder with his knife. The skin parted so easily under the blade, his hand twitching to work out intricate designs in the flesh. Occasionally he would wipe away the blood with his hand, ‘tsk’ing softly.
He fumbled with his keys when he arrived home, sliding in the correct key, jiggling it just right to unlock the door. His shoes got kicked off into a laundry basket beside the door, where a few other pairs rested in a haphazard pile. His keys were hung up on a thumbtack pressed into the wall next to the door, his wallet and phone tossed onto the kitchen table as he walked by. He flipped on the lights and made a pot of coffee, the rich scent of a dark blend filling the air in seconds.
Dean Winchester was a wildfire, scorching through life in a whirl of heat and smoke. During the day he worked, a mechanic with oil stains on his hands and ingrained in his clothes. During the night he lived, another guy that winked at everything passing him by, too much alcohol sliding down his throat. He drank liquor like water, relishing the burn down his throat, the singe of it in his veins, and the comfortable blanket it threw over his life.
“It’s not cold enough to freeze your ba-” Cass started to explain but he was quickly cut off by Dean flapping his hands, waving away the explanation. “Phrase of speech, Cass.” The Angel blew out a short sigh of annoyance, he still struggled with expressions. Dean wiggled uncomfortably in the sudden silence before he blurted, “Let’s go, Cass. That vamp ain’t dying with us collecting dust here.” He barely finished the words before the Angel had an arm around him and the noise of feathers brushing through air filled his ears.
Hey, welcome to the story. I'm very sporadic about updating. Some days I may post more than one chapter. Sometimes I may go a few days without an update. Everything is posted as I write it. I also do very little editing, I just write and toss it up on here. So my apologies for any errors. Comments+Kudos are appreciated! I especially like comments. I want to know how my story is, how my writing is, etc.
The church wasn’t anything special. It looked the same as any old church in Kansas, with stained glass windows and a white cross on the top of the peaked roof. The tiny parking lot was full of cars, Dean was stuck parking in the very back. As it was, their luck went sour as fat raindrops started to fall just as he turned the car off. Sam muttered something about ‘it had better not ruin their suits’ and they both ran to the doors to avoid getting soaked.
“Alright, you ready? I’ll go bury this,” he fished out a small box from his coat pocket and raised it briefly, “and you hide off to the side.” He turned with the last of his words to look over toward Castiel, the barest hint of a smile marking his face. The thrill of adrenaline surged through his veins, filled him with a reckless sort of energy. Castiel, though, looked a bit sour at the thought of having to hide. He started to open his mouth, as if a few hot words were ready to be spat out but then he snapped his lips shut. All Dean got for a reply was a terse nod and a mighty scowl while he unhappily walked away.
When he was done, he double checked all the tires and refilled the rear passenger side, it was a touch low. He cleaned up the mess from his work and by then another car was dropped off to be worked on. He went straight to it and the rest of the day passed without further incident, at least from him. The altima was picked up and Bobby had a shouting match with the owner when he tried to refuse paying the bill. He accused them of being thieves and only paid up when Bobby threatened to impound the car and call the police.
It became an unspoken agreement between the two: that night was top on the “do not speak of” list. Neither were willing to acknowledge what had happened between the two while their blood drowned in whiskey. So, when the morning dawned too early and too brightly, they hurriedly stumbled their own way with pounding heads and heaving bodies. Bobby was less than sympathetic to their case; he only threw aspirin down onto the table, followed quickly with the slap of a newspaper hitting the old wood surface. Dean winced at the sound, hand clutching his coffee mug a bit tighter.
By the time he was walking back into the shop, it was a quarter to 9 and his time was dwindling. It didn’t really take long to replace and reconnect hoses but if the client came back early, he would be screwed. Bobby seemed to have vanished during his trip to town and he was thankful to avoid the disapproval. He wasted no time, immediately getting to work on the replacement. And still, those same few seconds of song kept repeating over and over in his head, as if to mock him.
With the too large clothes of the Hunter on, Castiel looked smaller than he had before. His shoulders were hunched inwards as if a great weight were settled atop them, his head ducked downwards, giving his form a diminutive appearance. His wings weren’t pulled in tight, the usual habit of the Angel when he stayed indoors. Rather they were loosely spread, feathers dripping onto the bed. Dean noticed the towels sitting folded in Cass’ lap, now wrinkled from use. “I require your assistance. I cannot reach far enough.”
He would be damned if this was how he died. Again? When he thought it would be his death again, his hands broke free from the dirt. The air was hot against his skin as he flattened his palms against firmer dirt and hauled himself free of the grave. The grass prickled sharply, turned brittle by the sun. The Hunter groaned, arms trembling with the effort to free him. Temporarily exhausted from his effort and finally free of the sucking dirt, he collapsed into the grass and rolled onto his back.
Dean shucked off shirt and jeans, dropping them in a pile with his coat on the dirty tile of the small bathroom. He turned on the faucet of the tub, waiting until the rushing water was a lukewarm temperature to swap it into the shower setting (it felt molten to his half numb hands). The hiss of falling water was soothing, softer than the pounding rain of the storm outside. A low rumble of thunder rattled the walls, followed soon by a sharp crack of lightning.
The morning of the funeral dawned grey and unusually cool for late August. Dean almost shivered, despite the fact he was wearing a cheap suit rental. Sam looked ridiculous in his suit, his floppy hair and gangly body an awkward match for the formal wear. He had a long way to go if he ever wanted to dominate the courts. The threat of rain was damp in the air and the clouds were a depressing collage of monochromatic greys.
The drive to town was quiet. His embarrassment had his face feeling hot and his concentration was shot to hell, the thought of putting music on forgotten. He was pissed at himself, his mind circulating with internal insults, beyond frustrated. The cost for the hoses wouldn’t be too much but he didn’t really have that much spare to afford the cost of his stupid mistake. He smacked his hands hard against the steering wheel with a growl.
It took twenty minutes, four garbage bags, and a plethora of cursing to cover his wings. Dean muttered the curses, hands smoothing the plastic over his feathers and taping it into place. The thin plastic clung uncomfortably, rippling noisily, the tape rubbing against his skin. It was terribly unpleasant, yet he did not offer complaint. “There, that should work,” Dean took a step back to survey his work for a moment; then he turned the water back on, the soothing hiss of the water filling the room. He left the small room with a spry little wave, speaking over his shoulder, “Call if you need help, don’t drown!”
Dean, with surprising patience, guided him through the hazardous process of shaving. He smeared the foam over his face, smoothing it over the spots he had missed. The razor was tricky to maneuver, it bumped unevenly over his face, grazing through the shaving cream. He winced at a sharp pain but moved onwards at Dean’s urging, dipping the blade in water a few times. When it was all done, he sighed at his reflection in the mirror. A half dozen nicks bleed openly over his face, but all the stubble was gone, lessening the gaunt look to his face. He used a splash of water and the towel to wipe away a few stray flecks of cream.
The clock read 10:30 PM when he began and had changed to 2:24 AM when he stumbled out of the bar, feet unsteady against the sidewalk. The hours always flew past him in a blur of alcohol and flirting, occasionally broken by the boo of a crowd whenever he tried karaoke, his tune broke voice grating out only a few words before he cheerfully exited the stage, shirt stained with thrown beer cups.
Today was just like every other day, rushing past him with barely a chance to breathe, leaving him to stumble along and hope he didn’t fall behind. His hands worked without rest, scanning and packing each item even as he faked a smile and cheer, eyes dancing with false happiness. Most barely responded to him, some mumbled a ‘thank you’ and ‘good day’, and a scarce few bothered to ask about his day, eyes sliding away even as they forgot his reply before it was spoken.
An hour later, Castiel was dressed in clean clothes and sat down on the couch with a hot cup of tea settled in his hands. He felt the hot burn of a blush across his cheeks as he quietly explained what had happened to Dean. “The water. It was hot and comfortable one moment, then turned extremely cold the next moment. It, uh… It, it startled me. I panicked.” He hunched forward, waiting for the laughter. Instead, Dean just snorted and plopped down onto the couch next to him, shaking his head.
He was distracted for a moment when Castiel shifted in his seat, wings rustling as he adjusted them. When Castiel spoke up, it jostled Dean free from staring a bit too intently at his wings. “You cannot sell your soul for me. I refuse to let you,” Uncharacteristic anger bloomed through the Angel’s voice and his fist banged down suddenly against the table. “I rescued your soul from Hell, Dean! You will
The scent of pine lurked ever so slightly in his nose as he coughed weakly again before breathing out, “Help.” The hoarseness of his voice surprised him, he gasped another breath in before choking out another soft and strangled ‘help’. Why was it so hard to breathe? His lungs ached sharply, the air too thin inside the stagnant box. He pressed against the walls, feeling splinters snag at his skin.
“Hey there, uh,” he squinted for a second at the name tag pinned to his shirt, “Castiel? Castiel. Can you ring this up under my name, I need it for a car out back. Some crazy ol’ lady swore she’d rip me a new one if I didn’t use this brand.” He gestured toward the mechanic’s door, rolling his eyes heavenward. The clerk didn’t even notice, he was busy scanning the item with a cute blush staining his cheeks pink.  He paused for a moment before realizing he had left his name tag in his tool box. “My name is Dean. Dean Winchester,” he tossed in a wink with a playful smile, trying to coax out a reaction.
Cass was a good patient for Dean; he barely moved throughout the process, only hissed in pain once or twice when Dean accidentally dug the needle in a bit too deep. “Alright, dinner is cold by now but you should eat. Lost a bit of blood there,” he commented as he started cleaning up the aftermath of the impromptu surgery. When the bloodied gauze and excess thread and stained wash rag was cleaned up, Dean turned to check on Cass. He was curled up on the couch, hidden in a mass of blue black, snoring not so quietly. Dean rolled his eyes heavenward at the sight, sparing only a moment to throw a blanket over Cass’ exposed legs. Then he packed away their dinner into the fridge and left for the bedroom, feeling too exhausted himself to care. In fact, he was so exhausted, he ended up falling asleep with his shoes still on.
Cass swung sleepily into the store, feet scuffing against the tile tiredly as he clocked in and took up his position near the register. Despite being minutes after 8 AM, there was already four customers milling around the store, walking in seconds after he opened the store. He offered a women a tired smile as he rang up her purchase, a new car battery, mumbling the total through a yawn. She paid and left without a word, hurrying off with a crackle of plastic.
He was on a mission of utmost importance. A mission that could not be jeopardized from hesitation. He was an Angel of the Lord, not some weak willed human! He steeled himself against his revulsion, reminding himself firmly of his goal. A higher power had sent him here, to Hell, to rescue a soul, here to rip free someone of unfathomable importance from the chains of Hell. The mission had come with a dire warning, it would not be accomplished in a short amount of time. No, the Angel would wander the realm of pain and suffering for years to find this particular soul. It was well hidden among the damned.
” The demon started to choke and gag now, throat convulsing as smoke oozed brokenly from his mouth. He gasped and heaved with desperation against the exorcism and he fell to his hands and knees as his body twitched viciously.
“We’re busy today, you idjit. Got two cars for ya already. Cobalt needs a new battery and alternator tested. Probably just the battery is bad but y’never know, the damn things love to cause trouble. Her owner towed her in just half an hour ago and he wants her back by 10. Bastard is lucky I’m in a good mood, or it woulda been tonight. Hell, maybe tomorrow. And then we got an altima with bad coolant hoses..” Bobby groused as he set down his tool box and pointed to the two cars filling up their tiny garage. That poor altima had seen better days, its paint faded to a dusty looking bruise of a blue and the front was dented to hell. The cobalt was in better shape, a sparkling fresh washed silver with only a small dent marking the passenger side door.
He dragged himself out of his room and to the kitchen, pushing the button on the coffee maker to start the brew. Bless Sam, who always made sure to set the coffee pot up to brew in the morning. The sound of percolating coffee blended with the steady tick of the clock in the dining room. The smell was almost enough to perk him up as he stared longingly at the pot, watching it fill up with excruciating slowness. As soon as a cup worth had brewed, he pulled out the carafe and poured it into a chipped mug that said ‘mornings are for losers’ on it and returned the pot to finish brewing.
It wasn’t much longer until Dean was forced into the wordless scream of true and utter pain, his voice robbed from him as he writhed on the rack. Alastair watched the crimson tide that poured from the carved flesh, pulsing in time with a phantom heartbeat that raced furiously. Then and only then did he set down the knife, drenched with a fresh layer of blood that would seep into the handle with the thousands of other layers of unwashed blood.
He smoothed his hand lovingly over the hood of his impala as he walked around to his door. He unlocked the car and slid inside, “Good morning, baby.” He should have felt embarrassed to be speaking to his car but it was probably the only true love of his life. The rumble and roar of the engine was comforting as he grabbed a cassette and popped it in, music blaring to life loudly. He only cranked the volume up, the howl of Metallica a good choice as he backed up out of the parking lot.
Castiel flicked his turn signal on and merged onto the highway with minimal trouble, something he appreciated. He hated driving and highways especially made him nervous but it was the only way back home from Michael’s. “The church bought my painting, the angel I’ve been working on for over a month. I’m ten grand richer.” He found himself going ten under, stuck behind a semi. He happily stayed behind it, enjoying the more peaceful flow (or lack thereof) of traffic. People in their usual rushes just went around him and his new semi friend, some angrily merging and roaring past.
When he opened his eyes, he found himself lying in the middle of a field with a thousand wildflowers swaying in the breeze. He stared up at a brilliant sky full of fat, fluffy clouds gilded in gold and crimson. Was it a sunrise or a sunset? He couldn’t figure out where the sun was coming from, the colours were everywhere. Whichever it was, it was beautiful and he laid there for too long, enjoying the peace of watching the shapes and whispers of clouds float by.
Sam’s voice was almost too loud in the apartment as he dropped his backpack onto the ground beside the table and slouched down into a worn out ikea chair. He flicked a few crumbs off the equally worn out table and pulled out books, binders, and a pencil case and spread them out. His books were obviously second hand and well used, the binding peeling and in some places taped back down. His binders all had other classes marked out on the spine, a new class scribbled under it.
It was almost noon when the mechanic door slammed open, doors hitting the walls. Loud rock and roll music broke the silence, startling the only customer currently inside the shop. An oil and grease stained man strolled through the doors, a content smirk settled on his lips. He moved with a self-assured swagger, boots thumping against the tile. Cass found himself staring at the man, eyes narrowing at the surprising familiarity. The mechanic bore a striking resemblance to the angel he had painted last night.
Sam flipped the page over to the next one and continued the story, his voice bored. He had already read the myth through a few times today. “Icarus doesn’t listen to Daedalus and he started to fly too close to the sun. The wax melted and his feathers fell out until he couldn’t fly anymore. He ends up drowning in the ocean. Have you ever heard the phrase ‘Don’t fly too close to the sun’? That is called an ‘idiom’ and it basically comes from the story of Icarus.”
“Jesus Christ, Bobby. That sounds insane,” Dean managed. “Steve was always a paranoid guy, but I mean, him and dad were pretty tight when he was around.” He winced at the unwanted memories and shoved them ruthlessly down before he could think too hard about his father. “What about his family? Are they just letting it go?” Sam sat down next to him, the chair squeaking against the linoleum. Dean was distracted for a second, thinking about how they really should put something on the chairs before the linoleum got ruined.
sorry if this chapter comes off a bit hasty. next chapter should be actiony! and finally give us some answers!
He eased himself out of the vehicle, sighing with pleasure at the brisk wind that brushed through his wings. They flared out behind him, arching upwards toward the sky in a lazy stretch that had the muscles burning temporarily. Then he shook himself vigorously, feeling comfortably loose after the too tight squeeze of the car. A curious look around showed nothing special beyond snow coated trees and an almost hidden gravel road. He puffed out a breath that smoked in the frosty air then followed in Dean’s footsteps toward the door.
Dean watched as a man dressed in a trench coat marched his way into the shed, moving with a confidence that stuck even the cocky hunter. It looked like a human, one with scruffy black hair and eyes bright enough a blue to see from where Dean stood. A human that didn’t even flinch when Bobby and Dean started firing, shotguns recoiling in their hands. The lights overhead continued to explode in flashes of light, showering everyone beneath with sparks and glass. The man continued to walk at his sedate pace, staring down the Hunters with an intense gaze.
“Ooh, Cassie, we’ve got a hottie for a waiter,” Meg whispered to him after a handsome man took their drink orders and recommended his favourite appetizer, crostini with tomatoes grown fresh at the restaurant. Castiel blushed at Meg’s boldness, shushing her quickly. She grinned at him with a wink before stealing his menu, even though hers was right there.
Had it not been for that glow seeping through the corruption on his soul, he would have guessed he had the wrong one. No. There was no escaping, no mistaking the call to his Grace from the soul, begging him internally for salvation. Castiel purged his doubts with a prayer to God and before they returned, he lunged forward. His hand fastened onto Dean Winchester’s shoulder, wrenching free a hoarse cry from his charge as he shoved his wings downward. Castiel held him tight as they flew free from Hell amid the scream of pain that worked free from the throat of the hunter, whose newborn flesh bubbled under the hand of the Angel.
The ring of a bell signaled the end of his shift, loudly clanging through the roar of his music. He snatched up his coat, tossed a tool into the mess that was his tool box, and bellowed a farewell to his boss as he left. He clapped a hand against the shoulder of the mechanic trading shifts with him, wished him a good night, and was on his merry way. He slid into his car, a gorgeous ‘67 Impala, sleek black and glistening from a fresh waxing. The car roared to life with a rumble, subsiding into a smooth purr as he pulled away and raced off to his favourite bar.
“Something has bound me, I cannot access but a small fraction of my grace. It is similar to a wall with a crack, allowing the tiniest portion free for my use. I am unable to use enough for the purposes you speak of. It took everything I had to heal you earlier, in the warehouse.” Castiel held mostly still under Dean’s ministrations, occasionally flinching or shuddering at a stray touch. The Hunter just worked as quickly as he could without doing damage until the wings looked almost normal, if a bit roughed up in places. “I feel tired, Dean. My eyes feel weighted,” the Angel mumbled.
Meg thanked him as she walked into the restaurant. They were almost immediately seated, the storm having put a damper on what was usually a very busy time for a Saturday night. The decor was elegant but minimal with soft lighting that he appreciated. He, personally, disliked the bright fluorescent lighting most places used.
Dean had watched the encounter with a blank expression for a moment too long, belatedly reaching down to help Cass up. His mind reeled with painful memories of a faded face and almost forgotten voice, already all blurred with time. The desperate desire to see his brother again seized his chest painfully, his heart hammered with the need. He looked at Castiel with a broken expression, the curses of the demon a faint sound in the background, drowned out by the roar in his ears. His Angel stared back with sympathy and his wings dropped with it, the tips brushed the ground.
“You were explaining something about a seal before it happened,” he offered when he looked up at Cass, now sitting next to Dean. His wings were folded tight against his body once more but now there was a noticeable damage, feathers sticking out, broken from his episode. Castiel’s expression darkened with confusion, his voice thick and slow. “A seal? I know nothing of a seal, beyond the fundamental requirement of seals such as those around doors.” His head tilted off to the side, that curious little movement that was purely Castiel.
Since his hands were now taken care of, the Hunter looked over the desk for a moment. He snatched up a book at random that was most likely made from human skin, the cover dry and crackly under his fingers and flopped down onto the now vacated couch. He sat down the half empty bottle of alcohol onto the floor next to him after another generous gulp. It was rationalized as being a bracing shot for reading the book, which already had his skin crawling with revulsion. And to think it was only page one.
Sam distracted him from his thoughts by banging loudly on his door, shouting through with irritation. “Dean, give me back my laptop! I have that essay to finish editing and I haven’t done my citations yet.” Dean scooped up the computer and unlocked his door, handing it over without argument. Sam glowered at him with suspicion, “I better not find any viruses. I still remember my old one you killed with your horrible habits.”
It was awkward moments like this that Dean missed Sam the most. Castiel never offered more than the strictly necessary few words whereas Sam would banter and laugh with Dean through any hard case. The loss squeezed his heart as he rolled his shoulders, loosening the muscles that tightened when he felt nervous. “Alright chatty Kathy, let’s roll.” The machete was drawn with a smooth pull, the metal gleaming wickedly in the flare of lightning that lit up the warehouse every few seconds.
It was currently 31 degrees Fahrenheit outside. Just barely a degree under freezing, which meant the rain would pound down for an hour or two before turning into heavy, wet snow. The Weatherman predicted it would get as low as 23 degrees overnight and warned people to be cautious of ice in the morning. Despite the chilly night, a lone person stood outside dressed in nothing but a black t-shirt, ripped blue jeans, and sturdy boots of an unknown colour. The wind tugged at their clothes insistently, making the fabric ripple over their body. It was hard to disguise the hard muscles that lay under the thin cloth.
“Dean. If you want your brother back instead…” He started in a quiet voice, devoid of any trace of regret or anger. Dean felt his gaze begin to drop but it was taken by the sight of the red that bloomed through Castiel’s white button up. It was enough to help Dean steel himself against the need that burned through him, he shook his head vigorously and turned back to the demon. He threw his shoulder back and straightened up; brought a cocky smirk to his chapped lips.
The cashier awkwardly packed up the hoses and receipt, “Um, have a good day, thank you for shopping at Advance.” The words ended up directed to Dean’s back as he hurried out of the shop, oblivious to his rude behavior, only aware of his irritation and need to hurry. He tossed the bag into the truck and back out of the parking lot with a screech, racing back to the highway.
“Cass, you have a lot to learn. How about some TV. Let’s watch it for a bit while the aspirin works on your cracked head, ok?”
That same night, Cass had briskly explained he was there to help Dean. He barely let his words sink in before Dean was doubled over as his ribs burst with sudden pain. The Angel had etched enochian wards into the very bone of Dean and Bobby’s ribs; wards meant to hide the two from any searching demons or Angels. Remembering that awful pain, Dean absently rubbed a hand over his ribs until Cass coughed politely. “Dean? What do you want?” He repeated in a bored voice.
“You know, even Gabriel is turning into something worthwhile. Admittedly the idea of owning a bakery, of all things, is still beneath us but at least he is a businessman. He makes a very generous salary. Studying abroad in France almost paid off for the brat.” Michael carefully stowed the painting in a thin box that sat atop the table, packing the extra space with tissue paper to keep the painting from jostling during transport.
Castiel tenderly turned the memory over in his head, relishing the gentle beginning and rough end. Dean just vomited copiously for a while before he came out, shaking and pale. He urged Cass up with a touch to his arm, not even uttering a word. And there they stumbled with aching heads and heaving bodies into the kitchen. And now he was crammed into the too small backseat of the racing Impala. His wings ached something fierce, wanting to be freed from the confinement of the car.
Bobby coughed loudly and disrupted Dean’s thoughts. He guiltily jerked his head to look at his boss, who was looking at him with a raised eyebrow and impatient expression. Dean hurriedly grabbed the toolkit Bobby had carried in with him plus a few extra off the shelves nearby. Bobby nodded approvingly as Dean got to moving, turning his attention back to the phone where he started loudly arguing with whoever was on the other end of the line. Probably the auction. He doubted Rufus had given Bobby an accurate price, he had a habit of exaggerating the deals he found.
He had slept the entire night and got a decent six hours worth of snoozing, but it felt like he hadn’t slept in a week! It was ridiculous. Maybe he was getting old at the tender age of 26. He narrowed his eyes at himself through the mirror, then rolled his shoulders and left to get a second cup of joe, breaking his usual routine of only having one cup. It made brushing his teeth seem useless as he winced against the acrid taste of toothpaste mixing with black coffee.
Today he drew the profile of a nondescript person, turned away from prying eyes, walking away. He sketched snug fitting jeans and a loose shirt on them, fitting them with a sturdy pair of worn out boots. He worried at his bottom lip as he worked, teeth sinking in lightly, biting down as he focused. When the basic figure was fleshed out, he changed to a thin stick of charcoal, roughing it over the paper with a few strokes. Slowly a pair of wings came to life under his hand, arcing gracefully from the back of the person he’d made.
It had been left ajar and he felt a wonderful heat easing out, urging him inside. Cold and warmth were new sensations to him, although he felt he was a bit too acquainted with cold. He hated the way it numbed his skin and made his body shake; no, he definitely enjoyed warmth a lot more. His borrowed boots tracked snow on the scarred wood floor as he walked inside, hand shutting the door behind him. It was pleasantly cozy inside the cabin, cleaner than he had expected with comfortably worn furniture. Dean was busy lighting a fire inside the hearth, Cass heard his voice as he muttered curses.
The twenty minute mark had Dean drawing lazy designs in the wood of the table he sat on, legs kicking restlessly in the air. He chewed on his words for barely a moment before asking, “You sure you did the ritual right?” Bobby threw him the dirtiest of looks, one that might have scorched his eyebrows off. He flipped the dagger over, hastily amending his earlier statement with a flush and a “sorry”. He clicked his tongue against his teeth, sighed, and then laid the dagger flat on the table. “Touchy, touchy, hm.”
Castiel Novak was, well, he was a little bit of something and a whole lot of nothing. Three days a week he goes to college, four days a week he works and works and works. Between each day he sleeps very little and draws too much, painting his life as it flies right by with a splash of colour here and a bold line there. His hands were always stained with flecks and swipes of paint, finger tips smudged with pencil and charcoal.
The air was thin, dust tickling heavily at his lungs as he coughed violently. His breaths came in short pants, his hands scrabbled at his jeans. His mind lurched with confusion, disjointed screams echoing inside his head. A soft click echoed noisily inside the tight darkness before a whoosh overwhelmed his ears. Light burst free from a small flame of the lighter he held tight in one hand.
Dean crawled back over to the Angel, unable to see from a rapidly swelling eye. Damn that would be a wonderful shiner in the morning. He clamped a hand down on Castiel, creeping his fingers up to firmly hold onto his jaw. “Damn it Cass, you’ll choke on your own tongue, if you aren’t already!” The Hunter was panicking, his voice trembling as he shouted. He worked his hand into the mouth of Cass, yelling when the Angel bit down on his fingers. He pried his jaw back open, slipping the stained leather of his belt over Castiel’s tongue, holding it down.
The ceiling groaned and popped, randomly settling in the way old buildings did. The entire time they sat in that tub, the water slowly turning skin pink with the heat, Castiel did not move or speak. His only sign of life was the rise and fall of his chest; the occasional slow blink of his still bloodshot blue eyes. He sat still, huddled in the tub next to Dean, water running in rivulets over his skin. When Dean no longer shivered or felt as if ice were sitting thick in his veins, he shut the water off. The drain gurgled loudly in the thick of the silence, pipes groaning as water drained away.
Bobby gave him the stink eye and asked where he’d been, to which Dean shrugged and mumbled something noncommittal. The name Novak was floating around his head, insistently trampling other thoughts. Was it an obsession? Maybe. But it wasn’t one that was hurting anyone. He made his goodbyes and almost dragged Sam out the door, citing he just wanted to get home before the rain got worse. He drove like a bat out of hell, gunning his engine impatiently at every stop. Sam, wisely, said nothing but kept a firm grip on the aptly named ‘oh shit handle’.
Sam didn’t seem to notice his burned popcorn as he accepted a beer and started the movie, ignoring Dean’s complaints about their poor couch. The comforting sound of Galadriel filled the room and he reached over to turn off the lamp next to their couch, plunging the room into darkness, save for the glow of their small TV.
“Aw, don’t be shy. You’re hot, I bet I could land you a date tonight without hardly trying…” She winked salaciously at him. “I want to wrap that ass in your tightest pair of black skinny jeans. And that nice pair of black boots your brother got you last year. The badass emo look is totally all in right now.” When he opened his mouth to protest, she shushed him with a finger pressed to his lips. “No, no. You promised me. I don’t feel like driving home, do you want to just be lazy today? I’ll put on a movie while you paint, I know you get itchy when you finish one and want to start a new one pronto.”
It started when he was rifling through the cash register, the weirdness he had been waiting for. The TV flickered on, static blaring as a ringing started inside the building. He flicked it off even as the radio burst into the life. The TV turned back on as he looked around, then rushed to a shelf. He closed a hand around a salt container before running to a window, dumping it hastily over the ledge. The fine white grains spilled onto the floor as the ringing became louder. A pressure built in his head as he tried to pour more salt but it was soon too much. He dropped to his knees, hands clasped to his ears as he groaned with the pain. A short burst and the windows started to explode, knocking him sideways.
By the grace of … something, they made it to their destination in one piece and uscathed, though his hand ached from holding on what Meg called the ‘oh shit bar’. He eagerly slid out of the pink abomination that was her minivan, skirting around a massive puddle and rushing to go hold the door open for her. Breakfast had been too long ago, his stomach growling. They had opted to skip lunch in favor of the heavy dinner and probably equally as heavy drinking.
It was one more pot of coffee and another hour later that Dean found himself watching Bobby spray paint what seemed like a billion symbols all over the inside of a shed. Two tables were shoved up against walls, lined with every weapon variety they could each think of. Knives made of silver, of steel, of iron. A few canisters of rock salt, a jug of holy water, Hell they even had a crow bar. Their arsenal was intended to fight of everything imaginable from Demons to Werewolves. From Shifters to Vampires.
But, instead, he was struck with shock, staring wide eyed at the picture before him. His breath caught in his throat, his heart started to beat frantically in his chest. Right before his eyes was his Icarus! The same blue eyes that haunted his dreams now stared out from the paint, up and off to the side with a baleful expression of brooding beauty. Huge black wings stretched up and over, arched gracefully toward a sky of stormy looking clouds, similar to the ones outside. His hands were stretched up in a pleading gesture, as if begging for forgiveness, pressed together in an unspoken prayer. In this depiction, the man wasn’t Icarus, but an angel with a faint halo hanging crooked over a mess of black curls.
Castiel absently shook his wings with a flick, snow falling away in clumps. Dean worriedly noticed that a few feathers fell too, quickly lost in the white of the ground. “I felt caged inside, it was too stifling. I needed to stretch and think. It’s peaceful out here.” His voice sounded mournful, too soft and almost stolen by the wind. Dean felt a rush of guilt grip him hard but he shoved it aside as his remembered solution exploded back into his thoughts.
He grinned when he saw the cashier bent over the counter, browsing through what looked like a catalog. He was a cutie for sure with messy black hair, looking as if he had just rolled out of bed. The cashier’s clothes were a bit strange though, a white button up with a backwards grey tie and a pair of black slacks. Nonetheless, Dean marched up to him, whistling merrily along to the tune in his head. He set down the anti-freeze, barely hearing the stuttered ‘hello’ before he breezed through the standard.
in the hunt for a spell to summon the demon. Hours filled with the screams of their fights had haunted the house. Too many bottles of alcohol had tumbled down throats. More and more restless nights had wrecked through him while he searched through book after book, unraveled dozens of scrolls.
He jerked his shirt back down then hissed as pain lanced through his shoulder. With a puzzled scowl, he rolled the sleeve upwards. The sight of a hand print emblazoned in his skin startled him. He stared at it for a long moment, running a finger over the blistered skin before he smoothed the sleeve back down and cursed loudly. The Hunter whirled around and began to gather supplies. He stuffed protein bars into a plastic sack, dropped a few bottles in beside them, and even snagged a skinmag. He munched absently at the chocolate bar hanging in his mouth.
Castiel was an artist, it was how he lived, and the pictures in his mind were brought to life on creamy paper. Unfortunately, he was an unlucky artist. His soul mate had green eyes, an unseen colour he grew to hate. Everything was green. Trees looked bleak and dull, their grey leaves rustling through the wind. Grass looked downright sad. The world felt so incomplete to him, especially in his paintings, always left unfinished with splats of grey to mark where green ought to be.
Neither of them had expected it to be the whole damn family. They used their child as bait, a small boy that couldn’t be older than six but was more blood thirsty than either of his parents. They had burst the door down to find the boy chowing down on his own father’s heart, absolutely drenched in blood. Behind them his mother arrived, her shocked voice breaking the silence with a heart broken, “Cameron, no!” Then it dissolved into a snarl when she caught the sight of the silver blade clasped in Dean’s hand.
Dean nodded in agreement, “It’s beautiful…” At hearing how wistful and soft his voice was, he cleared his throat again and moved on with a gruff voice. He did not want this pastor to think he was some sissy or weak kneed boy! “Did you happen to get the artist’s name?” He pointed to the corner of the painting. Instead of a signature, there was only a feather that curved into a ‘C’. “I wonder if it’s the guy I know. Never thought of him as a painter,” he lied.
“Get dressed, Cassie. We’re in for a fun night, the storm be damned.” She disappeared into the bathroom to freshen up while he got dressed. He purposefully took his time to get dressed, still casting worried looks to the window that lit up with flashes of lightning. The evening was still young, the sun not yet ready to set. But it was now a sickly looking yellow outside and the thunder continued with the heavy drum of the rain. He knew Meg would have to drive, the idea of driving in the dismal weather enough to make his heart speed up with fear.
With his prize secured, Dean locked his door and plunked down onto his bed. He was wise enough to turn on the incognito mode, pulling up google. He stared at the search engine for a moment, dredging up the courage to type in ‘Novaks’.  To steel his nerves, he leaned over and turned up his radio, letting the music ease his raw nerves. It all felt so surreal, seeing his dreams alive in a painting. It was too similar to be coincidence and that made him extremely uncomfortable.
Dinner was just quick and easy skillet burgers with some fries on the side. Sam made his classic bitch face until Dean added a sad looking side salad that was just shredded iceberg and carrots that were looking a little past their due. But it made Sam happy and that's what mattered. He squeezed out an ungodly amount of ranch on top, pretending to enjoy it for his brother’s sake. His brother and his rabbit food…
When the oil was successfully changed, he rolled out from under the car, brushing clinging specks of litter from his jeans. Cat litter was great for soaking up spills but it was every damn where in the shop. Dean lowered the car down carefully before whisking away to the next, an old beast that needed a change of spark plugs. He worked tirelessly, sung tunelessly, and enjoyed every minute of it. He was a damn good mechanic, a job born from the curiosity to know every function of every part.
It was perhaps a bit early to be visiting him but Alastair did not mind deviating from his normal routine to visit a favourite. One moment he was strolling through puddles of blood down a hallway of screams, the next moment he was standing in front of the heaving chest of a man. He hung limply in his leather cuffs, gasping for air through the bubble of blood that dripped freely from his mouth, trailing a red stripe down his throat, down his chest to pool in the cuts littering his abdomen.
As the last of the word died in the air, Bobby leaned over and snatched up a sawed off shotgun loaded with rock salt shells. Dean stood at the ready, weapon raised defensively as he looked around the room frantically. The moment ticked by with agonizing slowness, fading into a minute, then five, then ten. With each passing minute, both Hunters started to relax a fraction. When it marked fifteen minutes past, Bobby muttered a curse and sat down on the table, resting his gun in his lap.
” He grasped him by the tan fabric of his trench coat and shook vigorously until he was staring into bloodshot blue eyes once more. A hand clamped down on the Hunter’s arm, trembling as the body near him heaved with gasping breaths.
One of these days, Dean needed to find the backroads and let his baby loose. The sedate 35 MPH through town was boring for him, his lead foot easing it up to a chaste 45 MPH. A little speeding wouldn’t hurt him. He was too tired to sing along to his music but the thudding of the bass made his heartbeat quicken a little, an illusion of energy as he drove to work.
Because of her antics, it was all too soon that they were paying up and the anxiety of the club started to creep under Castiel’s skin, making him fidgety. Outside the rain had dulled into a generous sprinkle, dotting their hair with tiny droplets. The club was within walking distance from the restaurant and she had parked in paid parking. He topped off their meter for the evening and offered Meg his arm, considering she wore high heels taller than his dreams.
But Cass did show and he saved Dean’s life, plunging the bronze blade first into the shoulder of Dean then into the heart of the siren, moving with the impossible grace and speed of an Angel. Then he had the audacity to scold Dean about letting his guard down, the body of the siren still warm and bleeding on the floor. It took almost an hour to shut the damn Angel up and even then, it was because Dean had cursed him up, down, and sideways. He had thrown the Hunter such a dirty look before plunging his wings down and disappearing with the soft sound of feathers through the air.
“Right, yeah, ok. Uh, damn. Wait, we have some garbage bags. A little tape and walla, water proof wings, right?” Dean edged past him after he shut the water off, brushing against his feathers as he left the small room. Within a few minutes he was back with a roll of tape in one hand and a bundle of black plastic in the other. “Ok, this will be interesting. C’mon, shirt off, you don’t shower with clothes o- just the shirt Cass!” Dean’s voice turned to a slight yelp, cracking at the last word.
As if Dean had read his thoughts, the car started to slow until they pulled off the highway to bump down a gravel side road. Within minutes the car was pulled into the driveway of a shady looking cabin that sat crookedly in the beginning to a forest. An early March snow dusted the house, doing nothing to hide the signs of age. Dean slipped out of the car, running a hand over the top as he walked toward the cabin’s door, leaving the Angel to sit with uncertainty in the backseat. He bit at his lip with irritation, an emotion he was growing too familiar with, then made his mind up.
He squinted at the clock above their entertainment center and saw it was half past midnight. He groaned tiredly, knowing the morning would be hell on both of them. Sam mumbled something close to a good night as he shuffled by and headed down the hall to his room, his door squealing as it shut behind him. Dean smothered his yawn as he stumbled toward his own room, telling himself he needed to buy some WD-40 for those hinges.
“Uh, sorry, man. Little out of it. I think that bitch knocked out what little sense I had,” he barked out a coarse laugh, moved to stand a bit closer. “Let’s get cleaned up back at the cabin and then I’ll make some dinner. Burgers are on the menu! We deserve a treat.” He edged past Cass and hurried through the usual process of wiping away their finger prints, he erased the signs of their involvement with practice guiding his tired hands. Castiel did not offer another word for Dean, instead he stood awkwardly off to the side.
. Although Dean was not one to talk, he had caught himself staring at the Angel’s wings more times than he could count.
He made a quick stop at a local bakery, ordering up some breakfast croissants with a variety of options. Whatever was leftover would be his breakfasts over the next few days. Another stop at Starbucks loaded him up with their caffeine fix of the day. He liked their chai latte with a few extra shots of espresso. Both him and Meg were monsters when it came to espresso, never less than three shots to get their motors running. One of these days it would probably stop their hearts but if the day ever came, at least it ended on their beloved coffee.
The Hunter methodically worked through the process of cleaning up his mess, he dumped bleach on the bloodied ground then used a hose to wash the mix down a drain. He took an hour to burn and bury the body and another half hour to wash himself clean in a scorching hot shower that left his skin red and almost raw. When he stomped down the stairs to seek out a bottle of whiskey, he stumbled into the hard body of Castiel, standing at the bottom of the stairway. “Dean? Did you get the information you wanted?”
“Of course you already knew where the vampire was,” Dean muttered when he finally looked around, recognizing the warehouse he had scoped out two days before. He was glad there was a machete already belted around his waist, left there from earlier. Castiel just stood with his serious eyes and stared at Dean, not offering a word of opinion as the Hunter floundered awkwardly. “It’s in the next warehouse, we can go through the door over there,” a flick of his hand pointed where, “and the guy nests down there.”
The door pushed hard against him as Dean struggled to get into the bathroom, shouting the entire time. Castiel groaned at the commotion, head aching horribly as he wiggled over just enough to let Dean through. The Hunter burst into the bathroom, almost tripping over him, a shotgun brandished. “Cass! Were you attacked? What happened? Wait… did you break the door? Damn it, Cass.” He was speaking too fast to keep up with, voice rushing through emotions: fear then confusion then amused yet disgruntled.
Bobby stared at Dean for a long moment before he sank down into a chair, running a hand over his face. “Damn, son. That… that is rough.” His voice cracked slightly, “If only Sammy were here.” A sharp note of sadness tainted the man’s voice and Dean turned to stare at him. His green eyes darkened with fear as he rushed over to the table and dropped to his knees, ignoring the flash of pain from hitting the floor.
OH BOY. I got inspiration thanks to my sister. I have fleshed out the next, like, six chapters, oh buddy. So buckle up. Shit is about to go DOWN.
They were surprisingly soft and warm, brushing over his skin in a way that brought goose bumps rising up. There was a brief moment of weightlessness before his feet slammed hard into sudden ground and had it not been for Castiel’s arm wrapped tight around his waist, Dean might have stumbled or fallen. As it was, the Hunter ripped himself free of wings and arms, taking a hard step backwards and away from Cass. Breathing suddenly felt a little more difficult, his lungs clenching hard for a brief moment. Then he forced down the discomfort like so many times before.
The sound of the shower told Dean that Sam was up. He hoped his brother had slept better than he did because he barely left enough coffee for a cup for Sam as he grabbed his keys off the counter and headed out the door. Even though someone was home, he still locked the door behind him out of habit. Their apartment wasn’t in the friendliest of neighborhoods, though nothing bad had happened to them. Yet.
Sam sighed as he sat back down at the table and grabbed a pen. He might as well start his rough draft now. Dean would be in the shower for at least half an hour, if not longer. His brother was worse than a girl when it came to using up all the hot water in their tiny apartment. He looked down at the grainy picture of Icarus. It showed the man with wings falling through the sky, feathers surrounding him as he plunged toward the ocean. The picture made him uncomfortable for some reason and he quickly turned the page.
In front of the Hunter was a bloodied wreck of a body, black eyes staring with uncontained rage. It was a pretty vessel, or had been before Dean began working it over. A curvy woman dressed in a glittering black dress with flaming bright hair, curling artfully in a cascade down her back. Her once pretty face was twisted with inhumane hatred, snarling her reply through clenched teeth stained in blood. “You can take that knife and shove it up your ass, Winchester.”
Dean blinked tiredly at his phone for a moment before standing up to get another cup of coffee. If he died from an overdose of caffeine, so be it. He also poured some for Sam since he had forgotten about it and added his fancy oat milk creamer. He said it was healthier than the usual coffee mate Dean bought when he wanted a little more flavor than half&half could offer.
He groaned as he fell back into bed, rubbing the palms of his hands against his gritty feeling eyes. The dream had been giving him what felt like nightmares all week, leaving him more and more exhausted every morning. He knew it had to be more dreams about his strange Icarus, but it was always forgotten as soon as he woke up. Dean looked over at his clock and groaned again. It was his day off and here he was awake at 5:45 AM. Adrenaline still ran sluggishly through his veins from the nightmare, a promise he would not be falling back asleep any time soon.
He jerked open the door to the fridge, looked at his supply of beer for a brief moment and cursed loudly. There were only four bottles of beer left; actually, three now as he grabbed one and slammed the door shut. A twist of his wrist had the cap off and soon the cool liquid was gliding down his throat as he gulped a long pull down, absently wiping away a few clinging drops with the back of his hand. He worked his way over to the bed, flopping down with a groan (mindful to not spill his drink).
!” Dean bellowed as he wrestled desperately with a werewolf, she snarled and snapped inches away from his throat. In the corner of his eye, he saw his Angel about to be pounced on by the kid. He should have known the case was too easy, the body trail too clumsy and neatly followed. Castiel successfully ducked under the attack, using a buffet of his wings to stun the pup.
“Yeah, I’ve got one I think. Unhook that one and I’ll go fetch the other,” Bobby was already walking away as he talked. Dean could tell he was still a bit ticked off at the mistake from earlier and he disconnected the battery with extra care, leaving it off to the side. He double checked for any signs of leaking battery acid or corrosion but found none, it was all squeaky clean. Bobby returned with the new battery and they had it connected and tested in no time, the volts already shooting up just fine. He went around to the front of the cobalt, connecting the meter to the red probe and touching the black connector to a separate metal part of the car. Bobby started the car for him and it immediately read out to 14.1 volts, a sign that the alternator itself was fine.
Dean immediately felt uncomfortable as they both walked into the building, brushing a few clinging drops off their suits. Sam wasted no time in heading into the inner sanctuary, securing him and Bobby a seat near the back. For a man who had almost no family, the church was surprisingly busy and nearly full, the pews crowded with people. Steve might have been a paranoid man, but his heart had been kind and he was well liked despite his oddities. Dean almost wondered how the suicide would stay a suicide before he remembered people simply wouldn’t care that much to fight it.
Humans. What a frustrating batch to deal with! Castiel mentally sighed as he brushed away the attacks from the humans. The blasts of their guns echoed dully in his ears yet he didn’t feel a thing, just the sensation of his clothing being torn. The knife did sting a little but it was worth the expression of shock that flared into life on Dean’s face. But even he had to admit the crowbar was a bit excessively. The metal parted through the feathers of his extended wings, warning him of the impending blow, his arm jerking upwards to deflect it.
“What are you doin’, you stupid boy?!” Bobby thundered.. no roared, his face quickly starting to turn an alarming shade of angry red and purple. “You’re supposedta take the hoses off the altima, not the friggin’ cobalt!” He pointed a finger accusingly at the cobalt, as if it were somehow the car’s fault, too. “Damn it, Dean, the owner’s gonna be here in a few hours to pick her up!”
They climbed into the impala and Dean almost flicked the heat on but abstained at the thought of the stinky first heater smell. Besides, it wasn’t that cold outside. Instead he switched the AC off and rumbled away, the GPS instructing him down some familiar backroads. He had never actually heard of the church, Freewill Baptist, but the roads were something he often raced down when the itch for speed became too overwhelming.
The Hunter could see his wings! The realization had him jerking his wings in tight against his back, the feathers fluffing outwards with discomfort. Dean licked his lips nervously as he watched, his voice a hoarse whisper. “I-I can see your… Your wings? They weren’t there a moment ago. God damn. What the Hell?” The Angel glowered at the blasphemy, muscles tightening with the urge to scold the human.
Bobby came back at that point and Dean waved him over to help with the meter. He had Bobby watch it as he ducked into the car and turned it on for just a few seconds. The cobalt struggled to catch before roaring to life. He counted his mississippis to ten then turned the car off, stepping out to look at the meter and sighed at the low voltage. Maybe the battery had a dead cell? “I think it is the battery. But hell, could still be an alternator. Do we have any charged to swap it out?” he asked Bobby, still frowning at the meter.
Dean went outside for a few minutes to fetch their supplies, all of which were dumped unceremoniously onto a coffee table. “Here you go, feathers. Read up.” A pile of newspapers and a book or two tumbled into his lap, thanks to the Hunter. Castiel looked down at the headline for the top paper, it was something about a sport. Dean left him to his task, taking up residence at the kitchen table; he tapped away animatedly at the small laptop he’d brought in. A small rumble clenched his stomach and the Angel hoped that lunch would be soon even as he started flipping through pages, half distracted by his empty stomach.
“Alright, Bobby, it was the battery. Alt is reading out just fine. I’ll write up the invoice,” he shut the hood of the car as gently as he did earlier. The invoice tickets were sitting on the desk and he had it written out quickly, hoping that their client didn’t argue about the price. A new battery wasn’t cheap but definitely better than a new alternator. Those were a bitch to replace. He left the paper on the desk, moving on to work on the altima.
“Dean. I am the one who yanked your soul free from the chains of Hell. We share a profound bond. Only special humans can see the wings of an Angel.” He took the factual route, words dripping free with an almost scornful tone. He neglected to mention his half of the bond, the soft thumping of a second heartbeat that pulsed in his chest, hammering in sync with the Hunter’s racing heart. “I was sent by God to rescue you.”
Dean continued mercilessly through the chant and now Castiel had joined, his voice strong and clear. “
The Angel and Hunter sat like that on the couch. Dean leaned into the warmth of Castiel’s wing, head drooping against his shoulder, his thumb lazily dragging against the back of the Angel’s hand. Castiel let his cheek rest against Dean’s soft hair, slowly breathing in the faint scent of his shampoo. They both soon gave way to the drag of sleep, alcohol still rushing through their veins like a thick drug. It erased the boundary that usually stood between them. And when Bobby found them slumped together on the couch, he just muttered ‘idjits’ and draped a blanket over the two, shutting off the light and carrying away the empty bottle of booze.
The clothes he fetched for Castiel were his pajamas, a comfortable set of sweat pants and another black t-shirt. He ran a hand through his still wet hair, wondering if Cass had been given enough time to dry off and be decent. The Hunter blew out a sigh before turning back toward the bathroom. He immediately whirled around with a startled oath, his voice tight with alarm. “Damn it Cass! The towel goes around your waist! I did not want to see you totally naked.” While Dean had been getting dressed, Castiel had stripped himself of his remaining sodden garments and now stood in the doorway to the bathroom. Rather than use the towels to dry himself off, he just stood with a confused expression, water dripping onto the carpet.
The warning also spoke of his well-being. This was a perilous task set upon his shoulder, his chances of escaping unscathed were near nonexistent. To escape unscathed with a soul intact was nigh impossible. Such a terrible burden would make lesser Angels tremble and doubt but he was a good soldier, he did not question his orders. Instead he had plunged into Hell with determination to succeed, not looking back even once.
It had been a cookie cutter case, all tied up in a little bow, ready to be delivered into his hands. A family of werewolves got a bit too sloppy, left their killed victims to be discovered by accident, chests ripped open and missing hearts. It barely took two days to track them down and find their home. Dean had sworn it was just the husband, who spent the previous night drunk at a bar. Castiel argued it may have been the wife, who had been unobserved at home.
“You’re sleepy, Cass. You take the bed, I’ll take the floor. I’m sure there is a spot we haven’t dripped on.” Dean scooted over until he hopped off the bed, feet thumping against the floor. He spared a few minutes to gather the scattered bits of clothing that littered the room, arranging them over the back of chairs, the side of the tub, and even over the shower rod holding up the curtain. He folded the damp towels, leaving them on the counter next to the sink. The Hunter barely had the energy to brush his teeth before he was stumbling over to a chair.
In the two months of working here, Cass had only met two people: his boss and the other cashier that worked the days he didn’t. He hadn’t once met or seen the mechanics, though he knew there was two. He leaned against the counter, pretending to look through a catalog when in reality he was watching the other man. Damn he was hot. Cass couldn’t help but admire the way his body flexed under snug fitting clothes as he reached for a container above his head. A small strip of his stomach showed where his shirt had ridden up. Apparently satisfied with the item, the mechanic turned away from the shelf and walked toward the check out.
A disdainful note sparked in Uriel’s voice as he replied, a sneer too evident. “If you were stupid enough to get attacked, Castiel, why should I levy the information you need to you? Find the answers without my aid. Surely you and your savage can find them through another method. Though I advise you exercise more caution for I may not be there to save you again.” It was now that Dean realised he could not see the wings of the other Angel for all he heard was a soft whoosh as Uriel vanished.
Bobby exhaled sharply as if he wanted to say something, then he shook his head slightly and moved over to the second table. The table was already prepared for the spell, the required supplies mixed accordingly. All Bobby had to do was pick up a bowl and sprinkle a pinch of the contents into a silver dish, which expelled a lazy stream of smoke in response. He murmured the required words to the spell, voice firm.
He took a slow sip from his thermos, sighing happily at the taste of heavily sweetened coffee. Then he settled back, prepared for another day of the usual. It was a surprisingly busy morning, person after person showing up, buying, leaving with barely a word said. He got a few polite ‘hello’s and one or two ‘thank you’s, but otherwise it was a quiet and busy day. At least it was quiet to begin with.
Castiel jumped slightly when he heard a polite cough, blushing bright red when he realised the customer was waiting for him to scan her items. He mumbled a quick apology, ringing up her items quickly. She just smiled at him, paid, and left without a word. He took a moment to check if any other people were in the store but, no, it was only him and the mechanic now. He was at the back wall, poking through a selection of anti-freeze while whistling cheerfully.
With great reluctance, he rolled himself out of bed and plodded down the hall to the kitchen. He started up the coffee pot early, stopping to listen to the sound of the percolating brew and inhaling the fresh coffee scent. He did what he always did, stealing the first cup as soon as it brewed, enjoying the almost too strong coffee. He settled down at the table with a yawn and healthy slurp of his hot bean juice.
He spared a moment’s glance at the Angel, whose eyes were beginning to grow glassy, his wings drooping drunkenly around him. Cass offered him a sloppy nod and lurched forward, shoes scuffing against the ground as he followed Dean into the adjacent room. They dropped onto the couch together, it groaned under their weight. Dean twisted the cap off his bottle, taking a quick gulp before handing it off. “I’m sorry, man. I… I tried my best. But they aren’t guilty. For once.”
He walked past the souls that laughed as they struck other souls with whips, chains, blades. Those were the ones that made him shudder the most as he saw their humanity slowly draining from their flicking souls, watching the red and black ooze staining their humanity. Each strike of the knife, each welt raised by the whip, it all slowly erased what used to make them human. Their laughter was cold and menacing, echoing under the higher sound of torment. They were nearly as numerous as the demons that raised their own tools to the air to bring down on the imagined flesh before them.
The sound of splintering wood shattered the silence of the room, followed shortly after with a shout of frustration. Next the leg to a broken chair sailed across the room to smash into the wall, exploding into a shower of splinters that scattered into the carpet. Dean was prepared to throw another part of the chair he had broken moments before but a polite cough interrupted him. He turned around with the back of the chair clutched in his hands, which were oozing a slow drip of blood that stained the floor in splashes of bright red.
Her words oozed out brokenly, breast heaving as she gasped in desperate air. Her limbs still convulsed in her bonds, growing weaker as she adjusted to the pain, a crimson tide trailing down her cheek. “We don’t know. It wasn’t a demon attack,” she sobbed. Dean watched her emotionlessly with the syringe still in hand, water dripping slowly from the needle. He cocked his head to the side as he dropped the syringe onto his tray; it clattered noisily and the demon flinched with fear. That was the last sound she ever heard for a split moment later, her head was rolling on the ground. Dean withdrew with a machete in hand.
The pastor gave him a knowing smile, moving over to stand next to Dean, looking at the painting with him. “That is cherubs. And while white wings are more common, this is a special one. The young man who painted this has ties that are quite close to the church. He is on good terms with the Novak family. In fact, the Novaks helped pay for this new building a few years ago. Their donation was very generous and in return, we did not hesitate to commission this fine piece. It’s different from what we usually have but the emotion is pure and captivating.”
The sky was dark grey edged in soft blues, heaving with angry storm clouds that seemed to think the world needed a watering. Flickers of lightning illuminated the edges of the roiling clouds every so often, quickly followed the dull roar of thunder booming through the night sky. A brisk breeze brought goose bumps prickling over any exposed skin, quickly numbing the affected areas. It was the dragging end of winter, the fickle end of February.
Dean reached out to touch the painting, sure it was a figment of his imagination, but the thick oily paint was all too real under his trembling fingertips. He took a hesitant step back, still staring at the angel with wide eyes. Until someone coughed gently behind him, an awkward clearing of their throat. He whirled around, guiltily, to see the pastor looking at him with what could only described as a worried expression. “You okay, son?”
Dean shot up in bed with a gasp, hands fisted in his sheets. He was drenched with sweat, the blanket tangled up in his feet like some elaborate knot. He blinked blearily around his room, already soothed by the familiar chug of the air conditioning and the tinny sound of his radio in the background. He felt disoriented and the realities of the dream escaped him, just barely out of reach for him to remember much more than haunting blue eyes and a chilling laugh.
He sucked in a deep breath, let it out slow, and hit enter. The results that pulled up were too much for him to sift through, showing thousands of searches, so he tagged on ‘Kansas’ as well, hoping they were local. They must have been local if they were tied to a small country church, tucked away on the backroads like it was.
“Damn it Bobby,” he breathed after spitting the water to the side, a fierce frown scoring his features. The other man shrugged and muttered something about ‘just checking’. Dean flipped him off and walked over to the counter, grabbing an open bottle of whiskey. He gulped down two shots worth before setting the bottle down. In a few terse sentences he caught Bobby up on his situation, only barely keeping his voice from becoming a growl.
“Castiel!” His voice was immediately whisked away by a greedy gust of wind, the name falling into nothing. He forced his feet to move through the heaviness of the thick, wet snow toward the Angel. “Cass,” he shouted when he was in a closer proximity. The nickname seemed to reach Castiel, for he turned slightly toward the sound. An expression of surprise flickered across his face before falling away into a frown.
His Angel surprised him when he gently pressed his hand against the gun, encouraging Dean to lower it. His hand was comfortably warm, finger splayed across Dean’s own and the cool metal of the gun. He reluctantly obeyed and murmured in a soft voice, still focused on the stranger. “Do you know him, Cass?” It was an almost too long moment before Cass withdrew his hand, moving to stand beside him again. He felt the slight tickle of feathers through his coat as Cass pressed his wing against Dean.
The screams of the damned echoed indefinitely, overlapping into a cacophony of pain with the delicious undertones of insane laughter and sincere pleading. The sound was music to the ears of Alastair as he made his rounds. Some pleaded with those that bore the whips, crying out with pure desperation, claiming there had been a mistake. They did not belong here! Others screamed for forgiveness, their wrecked voices begging too late for they were already trapped with leather cuffs to the racks. Their skin already peeling, bleeding, shriveling under the unending torture.
“I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.” The monster came to a stop just in front of Dean. It spoke with a deep voice, tone cool and factual with a bit of a gravelly note. It cocked its head toward the side, raising an eyebrow a fraction, as if daring Dean to reply. Dean growled, “thanks for that”, and lunged forward with the knife raised. The blade sank with a wet squish into the chest of the monster, who didn’t even blink at the motion. No, it actually smirked at Dean with another little eyebrow raise.
That was how it was in customer service. Each person was too busy, they wanted to march on with their life, newly bought items in tow. Especially where he worked, an auto part store that doubled as a mechanic repair service. Most purchases that were scanned with his hands were needed immediately to fix the customer’s car and get them back into the flow of a busy life. When they spoke, it was in hurried and harried tones that asked for immediate relief as they requested to know where their needed item was.
Meg pulled herself free of the couch cushions, stretching out pops and cracks from her joints. “Nope, sorry, Castiel. We’re going out. Your dog will be fine. Your dick on the other hand? It needs some company. Let’s go get you dressed, buttercup.” She tsked at him before climbing the stairs to his loft bedroom, already familiar enough with his home to barge happily into the walk in closet.
Then he hurriedly rushed to assure him, his words blurred together as he hastened to explain. “No, no, Cass. We’re going to trap the demon. No one is losing their soul. There is a water tower near the site I have in mind, I figured we can paint a trap on the underside and lure the demon under it. That way we bargain their freedom for our information, no soul needed.” His hands waved absently as he spoke, fingers spreading in a gesture at the end. Castiel pondered the plan, the flush of anger changing to one of embarrassment as he took a quick drink of his coffee to hide it.
Once the radiator hoses were connected and the coolant refilled, he hunted down their multimeter. He shut the bonnet of the car with extra care, not daring to let it shut with bang in case Bobby was still feeling touchy. He moved around to the back and popped open the trunk, pushing up the false bottom to expose the battery. Why they put the battery in the trunk, he never knew. It was a weird spot and backing up for a jump was a nightmare. He hooked the multimeter up, making sure to connect the red to the positive and the black to the negative.
“Of course you do, Dean. Why else would you summon me?” His breath smelled sweet, like rotten blood, and Dean repressed the shudder of revulsion that threatened to shiver through him. “Let me guess. You want your brother back, huh? Want your little Sammy alive and well again, hunting at your side as you two wreak havoc across the states.” His hand rose to gently cup Dean’s face, his fingers tightened briefly on his chin.
“I’m fine, Bobby. I just slept bad,” Dean kicked half heartedly at his pile of useless hoses, regretting now that he had used the knife. If he’d done the other way, he might have been able to save them. He hurried over to their work sink and washed the coolant off his hands, the familiar smell of fast orange wafting up from the steaming water. He dried his hands on his jeans and snatched his keys off the work desk, leaving without another word. Bobby watched him as he stalked out the door, his expression now turned to one of almost concern.
Only a second later, the front door slammed open with a shout, causing his dog to bark and charge at whoever was coming in. “CASSSSIE! It’s me! The light of your life! Coming for her coffee!” The spiel was interrupted with a thump and a curse, “Oh, jesus christ. Down Rain, down!” He peeked over the bar to see Meg carefully knocking Rain back off of her before she made her way to one of the stools at the bartop. “Your dog tried to eat my face-- Ooh, you truly do love me, Cas! Croissants and coffee? If I weren’t off the market, I just might propose right now.” She hooked a plate over and dug into the still warm breakfast sandwich. Meg was always a spark of energy, excitable and interrupting herself.
are you?” Cass finally looked up to stare at the Hunter, unable to hide the slight note of confusion from his voice. “I’m an Angel of the Lord.” Wasn’t it obvious what he was? Humans!
The liquor aided him with the press of guilt. It blanketed all his emotions with a warm blur, smothering them into a tolerable level. It gave him the strength to speak even though it slurred his words, “You did everything you could. For that, I cannot thank you enough, Dean.” He shifted forward a fraction, shuffling his wings tighter against his back to ease the discomfort of sitting against the couch. He blinked dozily, a slight noise bothering his ears when his words faded into silence.
He repeated the routine with the white bar he found, rubbing it over his skin until he was covered in a thick layer of soap. A few splashes of the hot water rinsed him clean, leaving him free to enjoy the feel of the shower. His muscles slowly loosened under the hard spray, he shifted enough to lean against the wall, pleased as his eyes closed. Cass didn’t know how long he stood there; it was long enough that his skin turned a shade of vibrant pink. But, in the space of one second to the next, the water flushed into an icy cold.
“Cass, get your feathery ass back inside.” Dean lowered his voice, now only slightly above normal while he stood beside his companion, face creased with worry and irritation. “It’s freezing balls out here, man. You’re going to get sick. You aren’t even wearing your stupid trench coat,” a note of accusation coloured his tone now as he gave the Angel a quick once over. “Why are you out here in the middle of a friggin’ storm?”
Dean moved from the table to the couch, switching the TV on. He settled himself comfortably into the cushions, cradling the coffee in his hands. Unwanted memories of his father swirled in his head that he kept stubbornly squashing. He didn’t want to think about his father, or his mother, or their deaths. He put on a loud car show that drowned them out and eventually dozed off on the couch.
“Cas, my wayward bird. Whyever would you be calling me at 8:30 AM on a Saturday?” Meg’s voice was a soft, sleepy purr in his ear, punctuated with a delicate yawn. “I don’t have the brats to handle for another two weeks, I like sleeping in while I still can.” He heard some shuffling and the sound of a keurig heating up, the clink of a mug against the countertop. She must have him on speaker phone then.
Only ten minutes earlier, Dean had woken with a gasp in his bed, heart hammering hard in his chest. His mind roared with a half forgotten dream and a sudden revelation, a solution to their plight. Before it could disappear with his dream, his feet had hit the ground with a thump and he almost ran out of the room. When he turned the corner of the hallway, all he found inside the living room was an empty couch and a blanket on the floor near the door.
Within moments the Angel stood within a forest, standing before a sloppily made grave, long since overgrown with weeds. His wings were spread wide for balance and in his arms he cradled the newly made body of Dean Winchester, a body remade so that the man might walk once more on Earth. He held that body tightly, secure against his chest as Cass pondered a strange and new sensation. He was perplexed, confused at what pulsed softly under his skin. A dull throb, similar to a second heart beat that had begun when they left Perdition.
“Okay my dude, let me check if we’ve got it all, m’kay?” the cashier smiled awkwardly before ducking his head at the lack of response from Dean. He hurried uncomfortably away and was gone for what felt like forever but was less than 5 minutes. “Okay, um, your total will be, um, $253.77. You’re lucky you came in today, we had a sale on them hoses.” The boy babbled at Dean and tried another smile that went ignored again. Dean winced at the price but just jammed his card through the machine, sliding it down maybe a little too forcefully.
It was six in the morning. Snow fell heavily from the pre-dawn grey of the sky, swirling in gusts of biting wind. Enormous snow banks were already formed against the walls of the cabin, some up to the window. A figure was tucked away in the haze of the flurries, barely seen as the flecks clung to him. Another person, still hidden inside the warmth and shelter of the cabin, watched the figure with a pair of concerned green eyes, still foggy from sleep.
“I woke up in my own grave, dug myself free like a friggin’ zombie, and then got attacked at a friggin’ gas station. Something is after me, Bobby. It’s got enough juice to explode windows and makes a god awful sound that almost had my ears bleeding. Hell, they’re still ringing like a church on Sunday!” He slammed his fist onto the counter before taking another gulp from the bottle.
“You require my assistance in the defeat of a vampire?” Castiel repeated mildly, cocking an eyebrow for a moment before he nodded. “I will assist you. When do we depart?” The Angel always spoke so matter of fact. Dean rubbed a hand over his cheeks, over his mouth, over his flexing jaw as he forced down the sarcastic reply. Sarcasm was wasted on Cass, he took the words too literally and might disappear on Dean.
Michael’s voice was firm with disapproval and laced with disdain as he glared at his younger brother. “And some new clothes. The ‘artist who can’t keep his paint on the palette’ look is unbecoming of a Novak.” He waved his hand to indicate Castiel’s well loved clothes, the smudges and splatters a constellation of color against the otherwise ordinary fabric. He wore what used to be a nice pair of jeans and a plain black t-shirt, just a hair too snug against his skin.
“Bobby. Bobby! What happened to Sam?” His voice was barely above a whisper, his hands shooting out to grab the seat of the chair. “Where… Where is Sammy?” The old mechanic looked down at Dean with sorrow in his eyes and sighed as his eyes closed briefly. He steeled himself for a moment before he croaked out:
“Cass, I’m not hauling you out, you hear?” Dean braced his hands against the lip of the tub, pulling himself up until he stood, scattering droplets of water as he did. “Get your ass up. You can borrow my spare clothes but there ain’t a chance in Hell that I’m changing you into them.” He gently nudged the Angel with his foot before climbing over the side of the tub, wincing at the chill of the tile under his heated skin. He set two towels down on the seat of the toilet, “Dry off. I’ll be back with clothes in a few, alright?”
Bobby raised an eyebrow at the wreck of a boy that stood, swaying, before him. “Well, ya gotta say, there’s a spell for everything.” He gestured sharply toward the bookshelves lining the walls, the scattering of scrolls lying on his desk, the room that was so full of knowledge. “Start digging, boy. I’ll get the coffee started ‘cause I don’t think either of us are sleeping tonight. And for gods’ sake, slow down on the booze there and do something about your hands.” The end of his little speech was punctured by a tired groan as he hauled himself off the couch and headed into the kitchen.
Dean scoffed as he chased a stray piece of chicken across his plate with a torn tortilla. He wished he had grabbed the hot sauce on his way out, the meal lacking some heat.“Sammy, you’re thinking way too hard about this. You’re not usually this dense, are you? Dude what happened doesn’t actually matter, it’s whatever bullshit lesson you’re supposed to learn about it. Besides, the kid probably just wanted to be free.” He shrugged.
The hoarse scream bounced dully off the walls of the basement, echoing back in a faint overlap. A wet slick cut off the tail end of the next scream, ending it in a bubbling gurgle turned to a cough. Dean licked his lips and grimaced at the vile hint of iron; blood had sprayed on him from his, ah, delicate ministrations. His tongue clicked against his teeth as he paced back and forth, tapping a knife lightly against his cheek. “I’m not fluent in screams. Are you ready to answer my question yet?”
He tumbled into his bed while he dragged his shirt off, throwing it onto the floor without caring. The AC chugged noisily from the hallway and mixed with the soft sound of his radio, playing on the end table next to his bed. He threw the blankets haphazardly over his legs and was asleep in minutes, the low drone of the radio chasing him with a song too quiet to actually draw him in.
He resisted the urge to sigh at her, instead reluctantly agreeing. It had been weeks since he’d last had a little outing; he’d earned a little more fun than watching TV or painting. “I’ll go, Meg, but only if you promise to not throw every eligible, and not eligible, man at me. If anything happens, I’d prefer it was natural and mutual. You’re a terror and you know it.” The thought of pasta made his stomach growl, reminding him he had skipped his breakfast in order to catch Michael before his day got too busy. “How about I bring you breakfast and we can go over dinner plans? I’ll even let you dress me.”
As Sam finishes the short summary, Dean comes out of the kitchen with two heaping plates of food. “Huh. So the dude toasted his wings and drowned to death? What a cheerful story,” he plopped down across from Sam at the table and set his plate down directly on the story packet. “Fajitas tonight. I tried something new and roasted the peppers on the stove. I read that it really ‘enhances’ the taste. But we’ll see..”
Outside he could hear the dumpster truck banging the dumpster against the ground, beeping as it backed up and roared away. A guilty look showed the kitchen trash was still almost overflowing but he couldn’t be bothered to get up and take it out. Instead took another healthy gulp and scratched absently at his chest, his skin still sticky from the night sweats, making his shirt rub uncomfortably.
Castiel discovered in a short amount of time that hot water felt incredible. The water pressure was excellent, spraying hard against skin in a comforting way. It took some coordination to wash himself, his wings kept brushing against the wall, making the tape pull tight against his skin. He scanned the back of the bottle labeled ‘shampoo’, mouthing the directions before squirting a dollop into his hand, scrubbing it vigorously through his hair. He had to crane his head a bit to rinse the suds free, water hitting the plastic over his wings with a light pattering sound.
After the third or fourth person, Dean’s discomfort grew too strong. Sitting there, listening to those lamenting over the dead, was too much for him. He whispered over to Sam something about the bathroom then sneaked out as quietly as he could with murmured apologies as he edged out of the pews. Couldn’t they have made this with more leg room in mind? Thankfully the inner sanctuary was closed off from the rest of the church and he was alone as he emerged into the lobby area.
The computer beeped as he pulled up the name in the computer, face a furious shade of red. He was flustered at the smooth rumble of Dean’s voice and he was downright startled at the wink and flirtatious tone, shyly looking down at his hands as he scanned the anti-freeze. Yet Castiel felt his gaze being drawn upwards as he handed the bottle over, eyes slowly traveling up the muscled plane of Dean’s chest, over his strong jawline, pausing at his lips still caught in a smirk. He blinked when Dean chuckled, a warm and amused sound, “Take a picture, it lasts longer.”
The hallway was a bit narrow but still more comfortable than the suffocating blanket of grief that was the funeral. In the background he could hear a shrill woman recounting a story about Steve and he shuddered away from the noise. The hallway was lined tastefully with a few potted plants and oil paintings in gilded frames. He stopped in front of one painting, intending to just idly look it over, a good alibi if someone came out to and saw him skipping out.
“Use the towel and wrap it around your waist, c’mon man. Show some modesty,” Dean instructed as he ran a hand over his face, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.

A short moment later the clothing was gently taken, “The shirt, you can cut the back if you need to for your wings.”

It was gone now, leaving the coffin empty and ready for the new body to be placed in. Castiel drew his wings in flush against his back once more as he looked down to the peaceful face of the unconscious man. He wrestled internally with the puzzle of the new sensation of their… bond? He sucked in a hard breath before he willed the body into the coffin.
