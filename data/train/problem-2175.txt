“Listen, you have to speak to me some time or the other.”
Sherlock lowered the violin and stared blankly in front of him, recalling Mycroft’s words. He was not going to make friends. He was perfectly fine on his own. He had to get his act together, though. Exams started next week and he didn’t open a book, yet. He was neglecting his studies and could only blame himself for it.
“Coo-coo, I brought you some tea and biscuits,” she announced and entered uninvited.
He narrowed his eyes as he gazed at his student. “I don’t want to see you with closed eyes in my class again.” He turned around while asking them to open their textbooks.
Without a word, Sherlock turned around and walked back to the bedroom.
At ten, he had back-to-back science with professor Linder. He had to look him in the eye sometime or the other, but why today for two hours.
“Oh, let me.” John took the tray from her and placed it on the kitchen table.
“What the hell do you mean?”
“I know what I said, Molly,” he cried out, cutting her off mid-sentence. He rushed out of the locker room and hurried down to the morgue.
“Keep it, you have to practice.” She took it from him when he shook his head. “I’m here every day, except on Sundays.”
With tears in his eyes, Mycroft left the control room.
“Stop this bullshit. We’ve had this discussion already. I love you and I don’t want anyone else, but you. When is your day off?”
“Ugh, don’t be silly. You didn’t answer my question, yet.”
Mycroft chuckled. “Fortunately not, brother dear.” He moved his chair closer. “I see you became a child of the night.”
“Saturday violin lessons and on Sunday I have to work.”
“No, why do you ask, Professor?”
He continued to play the violin. On his off days, he went back to Willa at the university for more lessons.
“I’m Professor Andrew Marks,” the new lector said while writing his name on the black board. He turned back to the students and smiled as he glanced over each of them. His brow arched when he noticed Sherlock’s blasé attitude.
John glanced at him.
“Yes, the only one in the world.”
He arched a brow when he felt the bulge in John’s trousers growing bigger. “Oh, I can feel you want me.”
After he packed a few things, he put on his coat and scarf. He frowned when he noticed the expression on John’s face. “Don’t look so worried. I’ll come back.”
“I believe you two have met, thanks to my brother.”
His eyes enlarged. “I thought you said we have to keep it a secret.”
After they gave their order to waiter, he deduced people entering the restaurant, avoiding eye contact with Simon.
He shut his bedroom door behind him.
He shook his head. “Nothing,” he murmured and turned his head away.
Sherlock smiled when he stepped into the kitchen. “His plus one is Greg.”
He nodded, struggling to find the right words he kept on staring at the man in front of him. He swallowed a dry lump before he took a deep breath. “I’m not ready for a relationship, Simon. I hardly know you. Besides, I’m so busy at the lab I don’t have time to social.” Sherlock rolled his eyes after Simon broke eye contact. What a lame excuse, why didn’t he tell the man he couldn’t be in a physical relationship, not now – maybe never.
After the waiter brought his food, he stopped him before he could leave. “Could you bring me a burger and large chips as well, takeaway?”
“Consulting detective, Anderson. Get your facts straight.”
“You’d be surprise. I had over two thousand hits on the previous one.”
When he pulled his legs up, Simon took hold of the elastic band and slipped Sherlock’s shorts off before he got rid of his tracksuit pants.
“Will you cover for me? I think I’ll go home as you suggested. I’m anyway off tomorrow.”
That afternoon, Mycroft visited him after receiving a phone call from the Dean. “You can’t go on like this. You need professional help, Sherlock.”
He shrugged and let go of her baby bump. “Figure of speech, love.”
When he came out he nearly bumped into him. “I’m sorry for leaving, John.” He moved past him and hurried to his bedroom.
The chicken portions covered the outlet, keeping the water from draining. The sink filled up with water until it flowed over the side.
Mycroft glared at his brother. “None of your business.”
“And what?”
“John Watson,” he said while shaking his hand.
An hour later, he took his violin and started playing. A knock on the door distracted him. He started over and stopped again when another knock followed. He grimaced when he put the violin down.
“You poor thing, you sit here the whole night listening to my yelling.”
Half an hour later, John stood in front of the apartment building he called home for three years. He smiled as he glanced at the doorknocker slanting to the right and shook his head before opening the door.
“Then why didn’t you allow me to stay with you in London six years ago?”
He glanced at John. “Is there something else I can buy, since you don’t want coffee?”
“He’s your brother, Sherlock. I’m living here for almost two months and I didn’t know you had a brother. You never talk about him.”
“You were making noises in your sleep. You were having a bad dream. Are you okay?”
Anderson was already inside, discussing a forensics report with Lestrade. He rolled his eyes when he noticed Sherlock. “Oh god,” he mumbled. “Coming to solve another case, Mister Detective wannabe?”
“We brought a bottle of white wine,” Greg announced, took it out of the bag and walked over to John.
“He said you would come looking for him. He’s at St. Bart’s, at the morgue.”
One night, a voice woke Sherlock. He held his breath to listen. He sighed with relief. It was coming from somewhere in the flat and not from his head as he thought. He reached out to John, but he wasn’t next to him in bed. He stood up and without switching on a light, he paced down the corridor. He frowned when he approached the living room. Someone was moaning and mumbling in there.
He frowned. “Do you mean Willa?”
The young man shrugged and shut the door.
The dormitories opened the second week in January for the students to move in, enroll into classes and get their study rosters, before attending university the following Wednesday.
“There’s only six months of school left, why can’t I stay with Mycroft?”
Sherlock retreated to the bathroom. He reached for the mop in the dark. After finding it, he returned to the living room doorway. He narrowed his eyes, trying to focus in the dark. There was someone on the couch.
Sherlock ignored Simon’s phone calls after that weekend. When he knocked on his flat door after work, he pretended to be not at home. He avoided him for a month until Simon showed up at the lab one morning.
Sherlock glanced at the professor’s gaping face. He looked back at the board. “Did I make a mistake?”
The professor remained standing in the back of the class watching the boy’s cute butt as he walked away. He rolled his eyes again, covered them with his hand while pressing his thumb and forefinger on his temples. He had to stop doing this and concentrate.
“What does she want from us, now?”
Sherlock glanced inside the empty bag. “What are you cooking tonight?”
“Anything will make me happy.”
He sighed when he pushed the empty bowl backwards. He didn’t finish his wine, stood up and took the brown paper bag with burger and chips inside. He left enough money on the table and left the diner.
“Are you here about the flat?”
He found his brother passed out on the couch and gasped when he noticed how skinny he became. When he walked up to him, something cracked underneath his shoe. He picked up the broken container and arched a brow. How many of these did he take? He shook him, but couldn’t wake him up. “Oh Sherlock, what have you done.”
He put his arms around Sherlock’s slender body and smiled as he held him tight.
John didn’t wait for the end of that following week to relocate. He moved in two days later. He accompanied Sherlock to every crime scene, helped him searching for clues and solving cases.
He cast his eyes down. “I’m sorry, Mummy. You’re right as always.”
Sally gaped at him. “I didn’t say anything.”
“Listen, I’m not going to hurt you. You don’t have to be scared of me.” Simon sighed. “I, um… I’ll be gentle if you just allow me.” He moved out from under his head and stood up.

Sherlock smiled as he gazed into John’s eyes. “Of course, what will I do without my blogger?”
Mycroft nodded and sighed with relief. At least Sherlock wasn’t losing his mind.
His brow flicked once, the only indication that he was he pulling himself together. “On the contrary, Professor Marks.”
Two weeks passed before Sherlock had another nightmare again. After the first incident, John didn’t shut his door anymore. He left it ajar to hear as soon as the screaming started.
Sherlock visited the professor more often at home. Simon found it more and more difficult to keep the promise he made with each visit. Sherlock wakened feelings inside him he never thought existed. The sexual tension building up frustrated him. Each time after a visit, he had to speed back home, to take a cold shower after dropping him at the flat – but not today, not tonight. Sherlock agreed to stay over for the weekend.
The two brothers glared at each other.
“Oh John, I miss this,” he mumbled out of breath. “I miss you. I miss us.”
Mycroft smiled as he glanced at his brother in the car. “Well, well, well, my brother has a friend.” He looked back at his mother. “Who would’ve guessed?”
Sherlock pushed him gently away and frowned. “Why did you wear my coat?”
Simon caught up with him in the corridor. “What’s going on with you?”
The professor arched a brow. “Yes, Willa.”
Andrew grabbed his hand and dragged him into the living room. “Come sit and relax. Forget about classes and uni. Just be yourself.”
“I’ll pick you up at ten.”
“Which one?”
He flung around and marched back to the lift.
John sat down in his chair opposite him. “Tell me, did you save Britain?”
The side of his mouth slouched as tried to hide a smile. “If you promise not to rush me into anything, we can give it a try.”
His mother scoffed at him. “You told me a few hours ago you’re all grown up.”
“I know it’s out of the blue, but do you have a vacant flat?” He nodded. “I can come tomorrow.” He smiled. “No need to write it down, I’ll remember the address, Missis Hudson.” He chuckled. “Yes, two two one B, Baker Street. Good day to you too, Missis Hudson.” He ended the call and jumped in the air, yelling. “Yes.”
John and Mary returned from their honeymoon. They had two weeks of bliss on an island in the South Pacific.
“What kind of work are you doing?”
He sighed after the person dropped the call.
Tears welled up in his eyes. “I don’t want you to.”
In the beginning of his fifth and final year, his science professor fell ill and had to go on sick leave for the remainder of the year.
She snorted. “Set the table I’m bringing the food.” She turned away and walked over to the kitchen.
“Missis Hudson,” he hollered, cutting her off mid-sentence.
Sherlock was a straight-A student, like in high school. The other students became jealous of him. They made fun him. Some called him a vampire for his pale skin and tall slender physique, while others called him a geek for being constantly in the library.
He opened his briefcase on the desk and took a bottle of water out. He drank from it, put it down on the desk and pulled himself together before continuing the lecture.
Not wanting to go to sleep, he popped another tablet. It kept him awake and free from nightmares.
Mike stepped into the lab and glanced around. “Where’s Sherlock?”
“No you don’t have to, Sherlock. I’ll mind my own business and stop worrying about you.”
After experiencing Sherlock’s intelligent questions during lectures and looking at his previous test scores, professor Marks realized Sherlock had an inquisitive mind that absorbs relevant information like a sponge. With a mind like that, he had bright future ahead of him. He reached out to him to enhance his ability from A-grade student to a cum laude student.
“This is what you want, isn’t it?” He continued pushing Sherlock backward until he ended up on the couch, and fell on top of him.
He moved to the edge of the chair, placing his hand on Sherlock’s knee. “Don’t go there, please.”
Simon turned around and smiled. “You can’t go to bed on an empty stomach, Mister Holmes.” He turned back and trotted down the stairs.
Mycroft sent his chauffeur to pick him up at hospital with a message that he would visit him later that evening.
He arched his brows. “Sherlock doesn’t have friends, Mummy. Well, as far as I know.”
“It was only two weeks and it ended today.”
Greg placed his hand on Mycroft’s arm. “No love, it’s not a secret. I’ll tell him.”
Sherlock nodded, took the suitcase from John and jumped in the back of the car.
“Just coffee, thanks.”
After they cleaned up the kitchen, they said good night and disappeared into separate bedrooms.
The woman chuckled. “To teach you how to play the violin.”
“How are you? Heard you got shot in Afghanistan.”
John reached for his phone. “I’m calling the police if I don’t get answers from you soon.”
He returned his gaze to Simon. He did like him. Maybe he should give him a chance. While licking his lower lip and after sucking on it, he noticed a sparkle in Simon’s eyes. He was turning the man on. He let go of his lip immediately and placed the back of his fingers in front of his mouth, distracting him.

He flung around. “Greg, what are you doing here?” When he turned back, Whitey was gone. “Now looked what you’ve done,” he cried out. “Did Mycroft send you?”
The next morning, Sherlock had to attend his first science class. He paused in front of the door for a while before he entered.
She smiled and adjusted a button on the bottom of the video until they could here Sherlock screaming.
He took a deep breath before he grabbed the chicken, cut it into portions and rinsed it in the sink. With the water still running, he stared blindly in front of him, thinking of those warm tender lips on his cheek.
Noises of satisfaction echoed through the flat as the two men exploded, reaching an orgasm.
Mycroft’s face flushed. “You refused to go back to that university. I couldn’t allow you to throw four years of study down the bloody drain,” he cried out. “I thought I did good to bring you here, but apparently not.” He stood up from the chair, leaned on his umbrella and glared at his brother. “Get your act together, Sherlock. I don’t want another call from the Dean, ever.” He walked over to the door, opened it and turned around. “Make some friends, for god’s sakes.”
“Half-sister,” the brothers remarked simultaneously.
Sherlock grimaced, accentuating his words as he announced. “I don’t need friends.” He fell down on his bed, turned his back on the door and pulled his knees up to his chest.
He held his breath as he searched for the light switch on the wall. When he found it, he raised the mop and flipped the light on while yelling. “Who are you?” He dropped the mop on the floor and gaped at John wearing his coat.
After the medical personnel pumped Sherlock’s stomach, they admitted him into the psych ward, before Mycroft could see him.
He glanced at the tore edges, looked up and shook his head again. “I’m not going and I don’t want to become a lawyer.”
Simon thanked him and headed back to the entrance. He found the notice board and next to it the list of room numbers. He searched until he found Sherlock’s number. “First floor, number fifteen,” he whispered. He trotted up the stairs, found his room and paused in front of it. Maybe he should leave the bag in front of the door. No, someone might take it.
Minutes after his brother left, his phoned beeped. It was Greg, sending a text message with Missis Hudson’s cell phone number.
Sherlock stopped laughing. “No Missis Hudson, you’re impeccable and so is your timing,” he said and chuckled again when he glanced at John.
He turned around, nodded and walked past his mother to her car.
Sherlock’s face dulled. “It’s mine. I moved in two days ago. It will be out of the way when you move in.”
John rolled his eyes. “Why didn’t you bloody say so in the first place? I’m staying there for nearly two months and you never visit him once. Why don’t you stop by one afternoon? Come and see for yourself how he’s doing.” He bit on his teeth. “Now open this bloody door and let me out.”
John grabbed one of the biscuits and dunked it in the tea. “Do you want me to help you solving cases again?”
With effort, he rolled onto his stomach when he noticed a lighter part in the darkness around him and crawled towards it. He sighed with relief as he reached it. It was a door. He continued crawling until he was out on the pavement.
He smiled before shaking his head.
“Only Sunday.”
Sherlock stared into his bright blue eyes. His heart pounded rapidly.
Simon drove back to the university. He passed the faculty members’ parking and stopped in front of the dormitory entrance. He got out of his car and rolled his eyes. How could he give the food to him, he didn’t know his room number?
Thanks for reading and leaving kudos ♥
After visiting Simon’s house on Sunday, Sherlock agreed to another visit. This time he allowed him to kiss him goodnight after taking him back to the flat.
She puckered her lips. “Half-sister.”
“John,” he called out again.
“It’s Mike, from school.”
Mycroft let his head hang and covered his face with his hand.
“Come on, love. Don’t you want me to solve the case, get the scum in jail and tidy Britain’s streets up a bit?”
He pointed over the living room. “This boxes and stuff, will Missis Hudson remove it?”
Sherlock gasped and raised his head.
He snorted, walked past John to the kitchen and put the kettle on.
Sherlock kept a straight face while hiding a smile behind his hand. This was the first time he saw him angry. It made him look kind of sexy. He also adored it when he called him Mister Holmes.
“Not if you are going to ignore me.”
He jumped in. “221 B Baker Street,” he said and glanced out the window as the taxi took off.
“Janet.”
Sherlock smiled. “No.”
John stood outside the door waiting for him.
Simon grabbed his arm and pulled him back on his lap. “I don’t want someone else, I want you, Sherlock. Don’t you understand? I love you.”
Sherlock’s eyes enlarged. Before he could jump up, the professor fell on top off him, pinning him down. “No,” he cried out.
“Oh, I’m impressed alright.” Greg put his hand on Mycroft’s thigh and gave it a squeeze. “Maybe Sherlock can help me on a case I’m struggling to solve.”
He nodded. “I’ll take some.”
He couldn’t stop staring at the man’s crotch. He wanted to grab him, undress him and…
Sherlock pointed to his ear. “Traces of shaving cream.”
Professor Linder strolled down to the front and checked his watch. He sighed, still another thirty minutes to go. Why was this lecture taking so long today?
Mycroft rolled his eyes. “He can’t afford a grand restaurant on his salary.”
“No different from Mycroft and me. He makes my life hell and I annoy him.”
He took place next to his brother again. “Dear Missis Hudson, she said if I ever needed a flat I can call her anytime. Well, I need a bigger flat.”
Sherlock opened his eyes and glared at him. “I don’t have any cases to solve.” He jumped up and paced towards John. “Aren’t you supposed to be on honeymoon?”
He patted Mycroft on the hand. “Yes love, this sounds very interesting.”
Sherlock gaped at him, his eyes wild and enlarged.
“Mycroft had plenty to talk about. I thought he came just to say goodbye,” Sherlock remarked after his mother climbed back in the car.
John blinked a few times when he became aware of water running down his legs. His eyes enlarged when he noticed the sink had overflowed. “Oh fuck,” he cried out and shoved the chicken aside to drain the water.
They took the lift up to the lab.
“Why not, why won’t you tell me what’s haunting you?” Simon took the hand from his faced and drew it against his chest. “Every time we kiss, you push me away as soon as it steams up between us. Don’t you think after six months I need more than just kisses?”
“How can you eat that greasy food? When last did you check your cholesterol?”
He pulled his face and blinked as he forced his eyes open. “What…” he grunted. He rubbed his eyes and glanced down at Sherlock staring at him with enlarged eyes. He gasped aloud and jumped out of bed. “Oh my god, I fell asleep.” He sat down on the edge of the bed, yawned and scratched the back of his head with both hands.
Sherlock sighed as he struggled to make his way through and over boxes standing on the floor. He had to find a new flat, and soon.
“I sat with you every night while you were having them. Usually I stay awake and leave before five. I don’t know why I dozed off this time.”
After they unloaded the shopping bags, he showed Sherlock his room before taking him for a tour through the house.
He sighed inward when he took place next to him. The only thing he would find interesting now, was shagging him. He put his hand on his bare thigh.
John frowned and blinked a few times. “But don’t the police have a forensics lab to analyze the evidence?”
“Yes, that’s the one. I saw him only once or twice. But how did you know who he was?”
Greg sighed, while watching him, before he followed.
“Taxi,” he called out, sticking his hand in the air.
As they drove through the gate, a black sedan with tinted windows pulled up next to them. A chauffeur jumped out, hurried over to the backdoor and opened it.
“He’s my brother, we don’t have secrets.” He turned to Sherlock and smirked. “Do we, brother mine?”
John turned his head, facing him again. He started panting as Sherlock pushed up against him, arousing him.
“Last night when I checked my budget.” Sherlock got out when the lift stopped on the top floor.
Sherlock placed his hands around John’s head, bent over and kissed him on the lips.
"How many people are usually in one of the capsules?" John asked looking up at Sherlock. He grinned.
"Wouldn't dream of it." With that, Sherlock grabbed his coat and was out the door.
The waiter left after taking their orders and Sherlock was left alone with John again.
. The only thought on John’s mind. He needed to get to him. It didn’t matter how fast John had to run, how far he had to go. He was going to find him.
"Yeah, that sounds good." Sherlock tried to hide the excitement that he felt rushing through him.
John awoke to the sound of the violin. He listened for a few moments to the beautiful sounds that Sherlock could create out of that piece of wood. The bow moved across the strings in drawn-out notes. He put so much passion and emotion into each phrase, that John couldn't help but fix his ears on the magnificent sound and soak it in. Sherlock playing the violin this early meant that he was perplexed and couldn't sleep. John understood that, but he didn't understand what on earth could be bothering Sherlock.
"Actually, I have some stuff to-" John started to say as Sherlock’s smile morphed into a sad pout.
"Please sir, Captain Watson I need more". Deciding to give Sherlock what he was desperately pleading for, he inserted a third finger. Being an army doctor and knowing his way around a body, he brushed his prostate, teasing him. Sherlock let out a sharp cry and his head fell back, his curls falling on his face.
John: Yep. So you'll be there?
"Mr. And Mrs. Holmes." was on the front of almost every envelope with the exception of a few from other people John didn't know. He held his breath and quickly opened one before he could stop himself.
"It is not." Sherlock fussed and tried to straighten it out. John ran his hands through it and made it messy again.
"Thanks." She gave a small smile that was obviously fake. Everyone knew how she had a crush on Sherlock, but it didn't seem right for her to not know that he and Sherlock were together now and it was okay for her to give up. John was thinking about how he met Sherlock that day in the lab and how lucky he was to have met him. Then he remembered.
"Sherlock, I would love to be your boyfriend." His face lit up with a smile. "On one condition, though." Sherlock raised his eyebrow.
"Hey, it's not your fault. It was the drunk driver's." John took a shaky breath and leaned in towards Sherlock. He wrapped his arms around him and it took Sherlock by surprise at first, but he remembered that normal people are supposed to hug back. He awkwardly put his arms around John and breathed in his scent. It was marvelous. When John finally pulled away, Sherlock was unsatisfied. He wanted more; he wanted to claim John as his own and map out every inch of his body beneath his fingers.
Sherlock's POV
"God, you're a savior! I owe you, Sherlock."
“Calm down, won’t you, love? Everything is going to be okay; I’ll be with you the entire time.” John said, taking Sherlock’s hands, forcing him to stop pacing.
(See the end of the chapter for
John sighed and turned back to Diana. "You know, you guys are an adorable couple." She said with an innocent smile. John almost had a panic attack. "Well, we aren't actually... We don't... We're not together." John managed to get out. "You seem disappointed," Diana said laughing. "I would be. He looks like one hell of a bloke. Those cheekbones..." She swooned. John caught his breath.
"I'll eat something for you since you seem to think it's important," Sherlock said, exasperated. John swelled with pride. Sherlock was eating something for him. That was just about as nice as his flatmate got, and John was overjoyed that he could, at least, convince Sherlock to take care of himself like this. It was highly unlikely that anyone else could.
"Will there be a seating test for the upcoming concert to see who is the most deserving of first chair?" An unhappy Sally spat out.
"Morning, love." John saw Sherlock smile. John tried to fix his own disheveled hair a bit, but it did nothing so he gave up and sat next to Sherlock. He put his hand on Sherlock's upper thigh and started drawing circles with his fingers. Sherlock let out a little content sigh and continued his experiment.
"Can I see you in the morning? I need to talk to you in person. SH"
"Do we have a case?"
"Oy you two, get a room. It's only been half a day and you're already flirting with each other." Mike said and took a sip of his soda deviously. Sherlock's face turned red and he saw John's turn an even darker shade.
?: Who is this?
“John… Please. I don’t think you are being honest with me. What’s wrong?” Sherlock said in a deep, almost comforting voice.
“Thank you for stating the obvious, dear sister.”
"Magnificent" John finished and kissed Sherlock's forehead tenderly.
It was about lunch time when John got a text message from Sherlock.
"Of course."
"Only if you tell me about yourself too."
“Gorgeous,” John smiled.
"Good, I'll call them." John gave one more squeeze and then stood up to go get his phone. The calls went a bit something like this:
"And your cheekbones."
"Yeah, tell him what we were talking about Sherlock!" Greg nudged him so hard he almost fell over.
"I-I love that song." Sherlock stammered and rifled through his sheet music to find it.
~.~.~.~.~
“Lestrade called and asked us if we could meet him in half an hour. Something about a body of a man found in the lake…” Sherlock trailed off obviously deep in thought about it.
“Your clock is slow, remember? It’s an hour later than it says.”
"Come on Sherlock. Don't lie to yourself. It's okay to be nervous! How about we practice together sometime? At my place; well my aunt's more like."
John stared at the letter as if it was from outer space. He kept forgetting that Sherlock even had parents and that he was, well,
“I uh…”
"What do you want me to do now, Captain Watson?" Sherlock looked up at John.
“I meant to tell you earlier I honestly did.”
“Why do things have to be so complicated?” Sherlock mumbled with a hint of defeat in his voice. John put his hands on Sherlock’s shoulders and looked him straight in the eyes.
"John," Sherlock said, stopping with a concerned look on his sculpted face. Wait, sculpted? Where had that come from? It's true Sherlock had beautiful cheekbones, but-- Damn, he had done it again.
Oh my god I am so sorry guys. I've had no motivation to write at all and I finally pushed myself to finish this chapter. Also I'm very sorry if this has many errors. I am TIRED. Love you guys so much :)
"Okay, well you do that. I'm going to take a shower. I have raw egg on my arm and I don't even know how that happened." John walked into the bathroom and pulled off his dressing gown. He started running the water and waited for it to heat up.
"You never thought what, Sherlock?" John said sweetly and brushed the tears off with his thumb.
Sherlock's POV
"Sherlock, I'm so sorry. I didn't know they would show up tonight. I didn't think this would happen." Sherlock sank to his knees and looked up at John.
“I just want to sleep.”
"I believe I know who the killer is," Sherlock said with a straight face and opened the door.
Sorry for not updating in forever. Writer's block is a bitch... Also, sorry for it being so short. Again, writer's block .-.
“But it’s a sin! It’s not natural! Why would you want to keep being this way?”
Sherlock hadn't gotten a second of sleep. That used to be normal for him, until John.
flat?"
Sherlock, in danger. As he ran, he thought about how he would much rather have Sherlock by his side to make him feel safe. That’s what Sherlock did for John, what he had always done. He gave him a home, a purpose, and made him feel like he belonged. Sherlock had a way of making John feel like nothing bad could ever happen to him.
John opened his eyes slowly and saw the rays of sunshine beginning to peek through the curtains of his window. He wasn't really surprised, just disappointed when Sherlock wasn't still curled up next to him. He sat up and rubbed his eyes profusely, yawning wide. He grabbed his rumpled dressing gown from the corner and put it on sluggishly.
“I love you too, Sherlock. And I’m so-” Sherlock put a finger to John’s lips.
"And Mr. U's mood!" Mike said laughing.
"What's on?" Sherlock rolled his eyes at the suggestion.
"Sally Donovan and I, are constantly trying to win the position of the first violin. We are basically equally good at the violin and it just depends on the piece." Sherlock said bitterly staring down at his salad.
“Shite.” John jumped out in a panic and scanned their surroundings to see where Sherlock went, but there was no sign of him. They had been dropped off right in front of their flat, but Sherlock took off in the other direction.
"Do you have to?" John pouted.
~.~.~.~.~
"I love you, Sherlock. I really, truly love you." Sherlock looked at John and smiled the most genuine smile John had ever seen.
When he opened it, he was greeted by a friendly looking, older Romanian man.
"I just- I never thought..." He let a few tears spill.
"Sherlock?" John said gently nudging his shoulder. John hated waking Sherlock up since he rarely got enough sleep, but John needed food and he wanted Sherlock to come try out a new Thai restaurant a few miles away from the flat. Sherlock stirred and opened his eyes sleepily. "Would you like to go get dinner with me?" John asked hopefully.
"Git"
Lestrade:
"It's okay, John. We can call him later and tell him." Sherlock put his hand on John's shoulder and John leaned into him.
“So shall we begin? I’ll go first.” Sherlock says smiling mischievously.
John laughed, "Don't be. It felt amazing and now I'm marked as yours."
"And a new cake is in the oven." Sherlock smirked. John went on his tip toes and gave him a peck on the cheek.
"Yes, the view is quite amazing," Sherlock said and stared directly at John's lips.
"Well, I think I'll er- head back to my dormitory now. Goodbye." Sherlock said taking his food. Not exactly the best exit plan, but he needed to go before he made a mess out of everything. John Watson was having an effect on him, he knew that for certain. Now the only question was: what was he doing?
"Why wouldn't it be?" Sherlock asked.
“Oh yeah,” John grinned sheepishly.
John could never grow tired of awakening to the sight of a sleeping Sherlock curled up beside him. Never. It was too perfect a sight to miss. Raven curls spilling onto the cream colored pillow and a single streak of light escaping from behind the almost closed curtains, highlighting the bow-shaped curves of his lips. John wanted to trace those lips with his own and memorize every single detail. Not a single thing would be overlooked. If anything made John love Sherlock more than he had previously, it was coming as close as he did to losing him.
"You like that? You like it when I slap your arse and make it red? You like it when I claim you as my own?" He slapped once more; the harsh sound of flesh slapping flesh turned John on almost as much as it did for Sherlock.
"I do believe you're trying to get me drunk," John said and nuzzled at his neck. He felt Sherlock shiver under him.
He cleaned himself off and returned to the bedroom. Sherlock and Valerian were talking and motioned for him to come over.
"Almost John, just give me a few more minutes."
"That's a way of putting it, I suppose."
"No Sherlock. I understand that I invaded your privacy, but I just wanted you to fix whatever was wrong between you and your parents. You're a grown man and a silly feud-"
John was famished. He hadn't eaten in 24 hours and his stomach was making sure he knew it. It was four o'clock and Sherlock was taking a nap on the couch. He was muttering incoherently, and it was amusing, to say the least.
"What friends? Telling them what?" Sherlock asked looking up from the small pillar of flame.
Sherlock stuck his arse out way farther than necessary while he did another turn and winked at him in a completely flirtatious way. John shifted his weight again as it became almost painful how hard he was.
"Fine." He finally said and went back to his experiment and pouting.
"Yeah. I guess. You really want to spend time with me?"
The second John saw how tight Sherlock’s pants were, he knew he was in trouble. They hugged his lean frame and displayed every perfect muscle in Sherlock’s legs.
“G’night Sherlock,” John muttered, shoving his face into his pillow.
“You’re welcome.”
"So, when are we going to practice?" Sherlock asked, setting his violin case on the ground next to the sofa.
"Honestly, you two. It was just a matter of time." Mrs. Hudson said and wiped at her eyes. They cut the cake and talked about life in between bites of sickeningly sweet cake and rather bland Chinese food. It was a lovely evening and John was a bit disappointed when it was over. It was nearing 10 when they started heading back to their houses. They all left with a pleasant goodbye and wished Sherlock and John a happy relationship. Then the door was closed and they both exhaled simultaneously.
“You’re not going anywhere, young man.” Sherlock wrestled to get his arm free, but it wouldn’t budge. His father’s grip was like an iron clamp.
"I kind of figured that. A few nights ago was proof that you've got a few kinks."
“Why’d you do it?” Sherlock asked, his lower lip trembling uncontrollably.
“You have a lovely flat, John,” Walter smiled, looking around.
"Precisely. It was a Tuesday and it was exactly 6:47 p.m."
“You shouldn’t have left me, you bloody idiot. I love you. You hold on you hear me? Hold on for me.” John sobbed as he held Sherlock’s hand.
"Well I'm just taking it for the credit, but maybe it would be fun with you as my lab partner," John said, still smiling. Sherlock was seriously considering running at this point. All these emotions were too much for him to handle at once. All of that anxiety, however, was washed away when John grabbed his hand and said,
“Is that an order captain?”
"Yes please, Daddy. I need it now." Sherlock whined. John slapped his arse again and saw the redness swell up right before his eyes. He positioned himself over Sherlock and slowly pushed himself in. Sherlock's moaning and cursing were beautiful music to John's ears and he pushed in a bit more.
"So glad you guys could make it!" John greeted everyone.
After explaining the story multiple times to Harry on the cab drive to her flat, she finally looked like she understood it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What?”
When he finally heard the door opening a few minutes later, he smirked; thinking about just what he was going to do to Sherlock when he got his hands on him.
"I miss you too, Sherlock. I'm so sorry. Please forgive me. I love you."
There will be smut in this chapter!! Hooray! Also it's a bit long to make up for last time :)
"Oh shut up, John. Of course, you were." John giggled a bit and kissed Sherlock on the forehead.
"Sherlock! Hey! How are you?" John said enthusiastically.
"You're so gorgeous," John said looking deep into Sherlock's captivating eyes. He saw them fill with tears and heard Sherlock choke back a sob.
"Thank you. I look forward to this class." John said smiling warmly. The other students began to come in, but Sherlock was focused only on the new boy. Not only was he gorgeous, but he also had a great taste in music. Sherlock sighed to himself.
“I think you definitely made the right decision,” she said, smiling.
It was obvious to both of them that something was definitely “up”. Sherlock was pretty sure that neither of them wanted to confront each other about it, though, so they looked at their menus. The waiter brought some bread, cheese, and grapes to them and set it on the table.
"Love you too," John said then stuck his tongue out at him.
"Your morning hair is adorable." John giggled.
Am I really? Sherlock, you didn't come out to me last year so that I could be a supportive friend. I mean, you did but that's not all I'm here for. If I see you checking out a guy, I want to help you out."
John: No Mrs. Hudson it's alright. We're fine. We were just wondering if you were free tonight and want to come to a party at our flat at around 7.
"So," John said setting his cello case on the ground and unpacking it as he spoke, "why were you here so early?"
“I don’t know how to explain it, John. I just
"I just draw whenever I can. It's a great stress reliever, along with playing an instrument." John said with a shy smile.
"Sherlock... I'm so sorry." He sent it and closed his phone. He didn't know how long it would take to earn back Sherlock's trust, but he would stop at nothing.
"No problem, mate. I mean it." He had unpacked his cello now and was setting himself up to play.
"You play cello, piano, and you draw?" Sherlock whispered, still admiring the beautiful picture.
"Sherlock, my dear. It's been too long."
Hey! I am so sorry that I took forever to update. This chapter is kind of short so I'll try to update again soon to make up for it. Let me know that you think!
"A lot."
"Why? Because you know you're gonna fall?" John smiled as Sherlock turned to face him.
"Let's have the violins and cellos look at measure 57. Who can tell me what volume we going to play it at?" John raised his hand and was called on.
"Don't take too long."
“Of course, I remembered, Love. It’s one of my favorite things about you.” John smiled lovingly at the perfect man in front of him whom he was lucky enough to be in love with. Most of the people who knew Sherlock would never get to see this side of him the way John did. The gentler, more human side. The man who was a fantastic violinist, dancer, a passionate chemist, and most importantly: an incredible boyfriend. While most people saw Sherlock as a cold-blooded machine and a sociopath, John knew that he was just misunderstood by people who didn’t take the time to really get to know him. That may be partly because Sherlock wouldn’t let anyone see that side of him like he let John.
"You still don't see what's wrong with this? You looked at my obviously personal stuff and contacted my parents!"
"Would it hurt to talk to them?" Sherlock scoffed.
“We’ll be back,” Sherlock yelled over his shoulder. When they got outside, it was already nighttime and the streetlights that were just now coming on were their only means of seeing. They hailed the first cab that drove by and quickly got in.
"Alright, Sally. Next class, we can have a seating test. You will have to play all of Viva la Vida in front of the class, mind you." She looked over at Sherlock with an evil smirk.
"Sure, I wouldn't mind," John said trying to keep a poker face. "Wonderful. I'll see you in a few minutes. We'll take a cab," Sherlock said grabbing his coat and putting on his navy blue scarf. John was sure something would go wrong, but if Sherlock had a lead, it was only right that he should tag along.
. Do it now.” Sherlock looked surprised and actually whimpered a bit. John felt himself harden as Sherlock’s long fingers fumbled with the buttons on his purple shirt. God the things he wanted to do… Sherlock’s shirt was now gone and his beautiful, pale torso was now on display for John to admire.
"How could I not?"
"Be a good boy, Sherlock. Be a good boy and I'll fuck you very good. Right up against this wall. You want that?"
"So I've been told." John punched him on the arm.
“Coming!”
"Our friends, Sherlock. Mrs. Hudson, Lestrade, Molly. Whoever else." John said rolling his eyes.
“How’s Sherlock been?” He asked, looking mildly concerned.
"So now do you understand chemical bonding?" Sherlock asked looking at John's busy notebook, full of little doodles.
"Don't be like that dear, please. We've come all this way." His woman who was obviously his mother spoke. She had silver hair and almost a perfect match of Sherlock's eyes.
“Uh.. yeah, okay truth or dare?”
Well shit's about to go down so hang onto your sanity as this emotional roller coaster continues.
"Yes."
"How the hell did that happen?" John raised his eyebrow.
"How did you know?"
“Everything alright, love?” John took his hand and squeezed it.
"Glad to see that some people are practicing."
“I can’t believe you got me a lesson,” Sherlock said, still amazed, “I mean, I can’t believe you even remembered that I like to dance”.
"Don't worry, I've got some extra clothes that you can wear. Well, it's just a big shirt, but I hope it will work for you?" John led Sherlock into his room. It was small and organized, with a large bed pushed into the corner. What made Sherlock the happiest, though, was what was on the walls. Tons and tons of John's drawings; beautiful drawings.
"I feel so vulnerable", Sherlock whispered and hung his head. John lifted Sherlock's chin up with his fingers and their eyes met.
“No. Don’t ever talk to me again. Don’t you dare come looking for me! I’m going to make it on my own, and I don’t need you two. Don’t ask Mycroft where I am, he won’t tell you.” Sherlock stood and started to walk out, but his father grabbed him by his arm.
"Oh well, it's been far too long. We deeply regret that little... incident that happened before and we realize how unfortunate it was for our dear boy." Sherlock felt all his muscles tense up.
“Okay the give him some time. Let him reach out to you. You can stay at my place until then. Only if you cook, though.”
"Deal."
“Who hasn’t?” Valerian laughed. Sherlock smiled a bit at that. John gave Sherlock a reassuring smile and then seated himself in the corner with a chair to watch the lesson.
“I was serious about getting those trousers off” Sherlock mumbled through the kiss. John stood up and hoisted Sherlock up with him.
The food was delivered and Sherlock stared at it as if he couldn't believe he had agreed to eat it. John gave him a look and Sherlock sighed. He took slow bites as if making sure the food endured every bit of torture it could, before being swallowed. He chewed with such anger it was almost funny to watch. "Oh come on Sherlock, what did the food do to you?" John said, handing him a napkin. Sherlock grimaced, "It decided to get set on a plate and eaten. So that's what I'm doing to it."
“And no offense dear but you would think that your
“God, I'm sorry, Sherlock!” John shouts.
~.~.~.~.~
“What?” John asked, genuinely confused. “Do I embarrass you, John Watson!?” Sherlock practically yelled.
he begged, "another one, John."
The scene he saw before him would be burned into his memory until the day he died. Sherlock was slumped against the wall, pressing on his abdomen as hard as he could. Two figures were surrounding him yelling something.
"Damn it!" He heard Sherlock shout, followed by the clattering of pans. John winced at the mess Sherlock was making in the kitchen. At least, he was trying.
John pulled away the duvet and set Sherlock down gently. He pulled off his shirt and lay down as close to him as possible. Sherlock’s sobbing had turned into heavy breathing and a hot feeling in his face. His eyes had swollen shut and he had a headache, but he knew that John was next to him and he loved him. He knew that everything was going to be okay, so he put the past and those horrible memories behind him and focused on the present. He drifted to sleep with John’s lips on his forehead.
~.~.~.~.~
"I guess you will just have to wear your pants." John shrugged. Sherlock's face felt warm, but he nodded and pulled his shirt over his head. Changing in front of John Watson was probably one of the hardest things to do. He didn't dare let himself look at John's reaction to his naked chest, or bare legs. It drove him crazy, but he had to keep it together. This proved almost impossible, however, when John informed him of the sleeping arrangements.
"What about me?" John raised his eyebrow.
Greg: Yeah I am. Want to go to the pub?
John was lucky and he knew, god he knew, how lucky he was to have a life where he had accomplished so much. A soldier and now the boyfriend of the best, and only, consulting detective in the world. Lucky indeed. A vision of a future was starting to materialize in John’s imagination. A future that included growing old with Sherlock and never leaving each other’s sides. It was as if John had known Sherlock his whole life. Almost nothing was as significant as meeting and falling in love with Sherlock. Nothing could even compare. Sherlock was the most important thing in John’s life.
“Fine.” He sat up and ran his hands through his hair nervously. Everything seemed darker. As if most of the color had been drained from every object. John didn’t like it one bit.
John smiled nodding in Sherlock’s direction “Believe me, it was his pleasure.” Lestrade smirked and leaned in to whisper in John’s ear, “And I’m sure you would know lots about that, mate.” Then he walked away, cackling before John could process what he meant. His face flushed and he felt his cheeks go hot. He looked down so Sherlock wouldn’t notice. He knew how everyone loved to tease him about his relationship with Sherlock. They had been flatmates for as long as he could remember. In fact, John could barely remember his life before 221B Baker Street and Sherlock. Coming home to experiments in the kitchen, and listening to Sherlock play his violin late at night while John drifted to sleep. John didn’t need any other life than that; he was content. “Come along, John.” Sherlock interrupted his train of thought.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Well, we do have this compartment all to ourselves for another half hour."
"Keep your voice down!" Sherlock hissed.
I really need to try to update more often. So sorry.
"Want to go for a walk? It's only 6:30. We can kill time before going back to the flat if you want." Sherlock said with a small smile.
HELLO! I am finally back. Enjoy this chapter :)
"It was Diana Reid," Sherlock said as soon as Lestrade walked over. "Who is that and how do you know?" Lestrade said with a puzzled look on his face. Sherlock took a deep breath.
“Finally John. My god, I thought you were going to be in there forever,” Sherlock said as he opened the door. “I took less than fifteen minutes, Sherlock. Good thing you aren’t living with a woman. You would lose all of your patience.” Sherlock made a sort of huffing sound in John’s direction before stepping outside into the brisk London air. John followed, feeling mildly annoyed, but mostly just happy that Sherlock was up and about. He had been moping around the flat with nothing to do and it was driving John insane, almost as much as it was Sherlock. They needed this case.
“Not yet.” He muttered under his breath.
"When are we planning on telling our friends?" John said after a few minutes of pleasant silence.
"You want to know why I never wanted to see my parents ever again? As a teenager, they sent me to clinics to "cure" me of my homosexuality. They let those awful doctors shock me and inject me with all sorts of drugs. They stood by and watched as their youngest son at age 15 was tortured brutally. Mycroft had no idea until they had stopped. He was already away in college by the time they started." Sherlock had his head buried between his knees and was sobbing.
, oh my god." Sherlock panted and gripped the sheets so hard his knuckles turned chalk white. With his free hand, John gripped Sherlock's waist and inserted another finger. Sherlock squirmed under John's touch and grunted through gritted teeth.
"Loving you is elementary, my dear Watson."
"I'm sure it's not too hard." Sherlock called back. Boy were they wrong. Six failed attempts later, John looked at the wrecked kitchen in defeat.
"Heights don't agree with you." John nodded and Sherlock squeezed his hand.
“For what?”
to you" he whispered in Sherlock's ear, smirking. Sherlock let out a small whimper and nodded.
"Another perk of paying all that money was, we don't have to wait in line," Sherlock stated proudly and handed their tickets to the person working at the front.
"Yeah. I do." John flew at him and wrapped his arms around him. Sherlock stumbled backward and they both landed on the bed.
“John, I am almost certain about the killer. Would you like to come with me to present the evidence to Lestrade?" Sherlock's voice shook him back into reality. "Yes, I'll come; I want to know what happened," John said smiling at Sherlock.
“Alright then. I dare you to take off your trousers. Not your boxers, though.” He sipped his wine and added “
"Thanks for the tea."
"About the seating test thing."
John felt his pants getting uncomfortably tight as he kept watching Sherlock move. He shifted in his seat to cover it up, but he was sure that the combination of his face and Sherlock’s ability to deduce practically anything gave away the fact that he was hiding a boner. Sherlock smirked and turned so that his backside was facing John.
As the door swung open, Sherlock knew this meeting wasn't going to end well. He wanted to run and hide in his room for the rest of his life and never see those monsters again.
“I’m in the kitchen, love,” John replied. Sherlock practically sprinted to him.
“What’s that, dear? Do what?” his mother stared at him sweetly, as if she was innocent.
“Thank you so much for coming, Walter.” Sherlock beamed at him with a clear adoration in his eyes.
The cab stopped at 221B Baker Street and Sherlock angrily got out. He tossed the driver some money and stormed inside the flat as John chased after him.
I forgot to invite Mike!" John shouted.
"Thank you for your hard work. I will call you when she is arrested." Lestrade said, looking pleased. John and Sherlock both nodded and headed back home. "Want to go get some lunch?" Sherlock asked looking down. "Sure, I'll follow you," John answered and walked next to Sherlock. Lunch with his crush, Sherlock. How exciting...
"That hurt. I guess I won't bring you home the present I bought you. SH" John rolled his eyes and typed his response.
“John!” She laughed happily.
Mycroft: I doubt Sherlock wants me to come.
"Don't be cheeky; it doesn't suit you. I like it when you're commanding and sexy." Sherlock said with a straight face.
"Good choice."
There will be intense smut in the next chapter. If you do not wish to read, please skip foward to the chapter after. You will not have missed any of the plot. Thanks, guys!
Molly: Of course. Wouldn't miss it.
"My cock; please can you help me?" Sherlock pleaded. John saw how red and hard Sherlock was and he groaned, thrusting again. He took hold of Sherlock's length and pulled. He thrust and stroked to the same pace, and it soon became faster and faster. John was jerking off Sherlock with one hand and slapping his, now pink, arse with the other.
Sherlock walked over and smiled coldly. "I believe my work here is done. Let's go John." He turned to face Diana. "I'm sure I'll be seeing you again soon." He gave another cold smile and walked out leaving John to wonder what he meant and why they just spent an hour in a flower shop.
John could feel his cheeks colour at the thought.
He takes ten times longer calming himself, gearing up to apologise. Schooling his features into something appropriate for the eyes of patients. Even wipes up the coffee and throws the broken mug into the trash.
He's been mostly numb since the divorce.
"I wasn’t complaining about you being close, I was complaining about the brooding," said Sherlock, who was draped over the sofa, pillows piled under him at strategic places to make the position as compfortable as possible. "I’ll just make the tea.”
Of course he did.
"She was one of the top dogs in this organization. She would've remained so, if she hadn't panicked at the murder of her sister, gone underground and contacted me, wondering why her boss had wanted her dead."
"I'm not sure," John mutters, as he thrusts against Sherlock, "that we'll manage to cover quite everything in this go."
He raised the slipper again.
He knows they're not a couple. He knows that Sherlock isn't looking for things like that.
"He will be if you do this right," she says. "And I want you to do this right, Sherlock. You're my boys," and she gives him an oddly wobbly smile, like she's about to cry. "Or at least you were. For a time."
And Ella made notes and asked questions and made silly, stupid assumptions about John and Sherlock that people had been making about them for years and…and then she suggested looking at gay porn.
Sherlock doesn't reply.
But all this wondering makes his head hurt. Thinking about Sherlock suggests that he should be thinking about a host of other things that he's been ignoring. John really can't deal with any of that at the moment.
John hadn’t known that this stupid meme – joke – whatever – would be the thing that pushed them over the edge, although he wasn’t particularly surprised that a catalyst had turned up.
"Affection?"
was a bit odd. There was no little voice at the back of his head going: “Christ, you’re kissing
Luckily, the terrorist they were chasing was lurking among the hotel staff during the ceremony, unable to resist the spectacle of Sherlock Holmes marrying his Dr. Watson. It all worked out rather well.
“What do you mean?”
"Mhm."
"Might be difficult without a reference from this one."
John smiled.
“Mmm. I guess.”
He thinks he can see a flicker of hurt flit across her face at the mention of the pregnancy. But only for a moment.
"There was no need to do something like this, Sherlock. There’ll be other cases. I'm not dying, you know, I'm just going back to work." John hesitates. "Unless your client and his friends actually manage to kill us tonight."
Starting a conversation about something other than a case is… Difficult. Eye contact even more so.
That sort of people was not supposed to suggest rubbing one out over a couple of naked chaps going at it in front of a camera!
Sherlock teases the rim of his hole, licking, sucking, kissing, blowing and John cannot think at all, cannot remember how all of this happened, all he knows is that this is the best thing he's ever felt.
John rubbed his temple, stared at his flatmate who still refused to meet his eyes and decided to let the matter drop. For now.
John hadn’t thought about it much before now. Not at all, really. But now he found himself wondering about it. How long had it been? Short – he was sure of that. Had any parts of them touched other than their lips? He couldn’t remember. He wasn’t sure if either of them reached out a hand to the other one’s face. Or if the kiss had happened in a half-way hug. Had there maybe been a tentative hand on his waist? He wasn’t sure.  When he thought back to the moment all he could remember was their shared mirth, the twinkle in Sherlock’s eye over how outrageous they were, how audacious.
He bristles, like he does every time she suggests that she knows things about John that he doesn’t.
"In Sussex Downs, yes."
John thinks about apologising for his inexperience, but then decides it doesn't matter. He can’t think of this as his first time with a man, it's his first time with
John grit his teeth and carried on. He found a recipe he liked the look of, he went to the shops and he gathered the supplies. He also placed in his basket a tiny, stupidly expensive box of chocolates that he intended to place on top of the refrigerator as the promised reward for good behaviour.
“What do you mean?” John could hear his voice as if it was coming from a distance.
Sherlock’s eyes had closed, but when John sank to his knees, they jerked right open.
John didn’t know where to look or what to feel. The slow suction, the leisurely licking threatened to drive him mad, while the sensations below the belt were nothing like a simple hand job had a right to conjure.
"Well, some sort of benefits then.” Sherlock waved a hand. “Medical decision making. Inheritance. Whatever."
“What party?”
"Oh, you'd be surprised how much fun he can be when he’s pliant.” She grins at him.
He felt almost lindsided. He hadn’t even realised properly that this was what they were headed for. There was so much he needed to figure out.
That's something, he supposes. He had, after all, wondered. What Sherlock’s presence might bring. He hadn’t worried, but the thought had occurred. He'd wondered if there was a reason why Sherlock hadn't gone back to Baker Street. And all in all it is preferable that no mad criminals might turn up at his door. No others than Sherlock, that is.
They didn’t speak, they didn’t kiss, they just looked at each other in silence, listened to each other breathing and slowly unbuttoned those shirts. There was a sense of unreality about it all - his mind struggled to place Sherlock in a completely new category of reality in his head - but is still didn't feel wrong or unnatural. Just new and exciting.
"Hey, Sherlock?"
“What are you doing, John?” Sherlock was still standing close to him, crowding him, towering over him and John didn’t know where to look. He felt dizzy.
“Can you dismantle a USB drive like that?” John asks, gesturing to the A.G.R.A. stick as he hangs up on Molly, who has – rather pathetically – said that she has nothing on for the next few weeks and can take Rosie whenever. “Without damaging it, I mean?”
He can't really bear the idea of staying there, with memories of Mary in every room, with Sarah, with Nurse Idiot and the rest of them. He'll do his walk of shame and return tomorrow - but it'll be easier to do that if he knows that he's taking steps to get out.
"Sherlock?"
But he doesn't go back too late. Both because he needs to get up early in the morning, but also because he doesn't want Sherlock to go to bed without him. If Sherlock has gone to his bedroom and - and even closed the door - what would John do then? Knock? Or go upstairs for the first time for weeks?
"I don't have to wake up at all," John says as he rubs his temples.
John had promised to take him to a petting zoo in the new year and Sherlock was plotting revenge for next year’s gift exchange. So far the best ideas had included a surprise striptease sent to the Diogenes club at tea time and a botox gift-card. Sherlock assured John that the botox suggestion would make Mycroft so paranoid about his looks that a long internal debate filled with doubts about bluffs and double bluffs would surely end with Mycroft actually redeeming the card, thus providing Sherlock with ammunition for years to come.
They ate in silence, and John drank wine and looked at the person who could without a doubt be called the man in his life. His partner, his flat-mate, his best friend, his husband. The subject of all his writings and the would-be focus of most of the stories he'd tell when old age had managed to wipe most of his memories away. After weeks of unease John could almost feel the tension leave the room with every bite of food, every sip of wine.
They had touched often before. Fuck, they’d carried each other before. They’d held each other up, they’d helped each other undress, they’d run across London while holding hands.
“Good,” John said as he let go of Sherlock’s wrist. “Don’t move.”
Their marital bed, even.
John was focusing on not thinking. In. And out.
And when they finally touched, when their lips finally met, there, in their own kitchen, far away from any bearded men and long-dead polar bears – then John felt sure that they had never kissed before. Because surely – surely – this was no repetition, because John had never felt anything like this from a single kiss. Every point of contact between them was electrified, his hands frantically grabbed at Sherlock, with one going for his neck and the other one sliding around his back.
The gesture is crude, considering everything that is behind it, even though John’s palm is warm and soft on Sherlock’s thigh. But after everything that has remained unsaid between the two of them it feels decidedly vulgar to finally broach the subject with a hand to the upper thigh, fingers digging into Sherlock’s skin.
John doesn't ask why he's there, rather than at Baker Street. He doesn't ask what happened with Moriarty. He doesn't ask after the health of his former wife. He doesn't ask anything. He just sits on his sofa, eats Sherlock's food and goes to bed. His and Mary's bed. His marital bed, even.
John thought he must be a bit tipsy – he couldn’t imagine a sober Sherlock talking about loving someone.
And yet…
They go, solve the case, get the sample, and a good time is had by all. (All apart from the poor sod who was murdered with a ballpoint pen, obviously.)
“Yes,” Sherlock said in a low, rumbling voice. John imagined he could feel the heat radiating off his body, he could certainly smell his cologne. He held his breath as Sherlock said in a low voice: “Some of the above.”
All things told, it was hardly the craziest thing they had ever done. At some point in the future they’d probably do something even stupider. It wasn’t a big deal.
Interesting.
Christ.
But now it was here and he could feel wild joy and hesitant excitement curl up in his chest.
He almost wanted to go to an ice-skating rink but that idea stranded on him not having a suitable partner for the venture, and middled aged men on their own in the skating rink were members of a demography John preferred to avoid.
Sherlock takes a deep breath, as he ponders the absurdity of the statement, but she plows on. "I know you think that this doesn't apply to you and him. That he knows without being told. That he'll be happy just being near you, like he was. But it doesn't work like that. Not if you're supposed to be more than flatmates. And also... Well. Things have changed, haven't they, Sherlock?"
Not now. Not after all those weeks.
These past few days had been different still. Like a window into a future that could’ve been but never was. A future where John didn’t get married, a future that was still theirs and still filled with possibility.
Now they constantly tiptoed around each other.
It had now been a whole day of knowing that he was married to Sherlock Holmes and John had no idea why he felt so unsettled. Why it bothered him more to learn that he was married to Sherlock than the actual wedding ever had.
It’s something of an adjustment to find that these things are available to him again. After a whirlwind weekend of deducing, directing Mycroft’s troops, and a fair bit of actual running around, here he is.
“Well, a little…” John coughed, “a little intimate, perhaps, but we are, I’m given to understand, married. Hardly out of bounds for a couple of married people, is it?”
This is yet another thing that John doesn't know what to feel about.
