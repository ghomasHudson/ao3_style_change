He goes over their family in his head again. Updates on Sam, check. Updates on Eileen, check. Updates on Jack? Whoops.
“Does that mean I should wait in the – ”
“Why’d I decide this was a good idea?”
Then Dean shifts to talking about the bunker. Sam did . . . something to help them get back to full power after Jack restored to the cosmic level warding, so they keep finding new cool rooms. There’s a fully functional greenhouse, a forge and workshop, and, of course, more rooms with ten thousand books.
And after that, well, Dean experiences a rather worrying moment where he doesn’t have any idea what to do.
And just like that, the Shadow turns to ooze again, melting into the floor so rapidly and Dean hits the ground with a jolt that hurts his probably-bruised ribs. He reaches out tentatively, but there is no more screaming, no more taunting, and no more inky tendrils, just a solid unending floor of darkness.
“Ah ah,” the demon croons. “There’ll be no running. We put so much effort into the welcome mat, after all.”
Castiel turns his head back to the demon. Even without his blade, he still looks dangerous, eyes set and wings churning at his back. “What do you want?”
“Just peachy,” Dean rasps.
“Dude, your apartment is way too small for two more people. We’ll get a hotel room and come back tomorrow.”
“I know. If you had, I probably would have shot you again.”
“The blade is inscribed with special sigils. There are not many left in the world. I had thought that they’d all been destroyed long ago.”
Castiel doesn’t blink at the gunshot. He doesn’t panic or scream or attack. Worst of all, he doesn’t even die. He just looks down and frowns at the new round hole in his trench coat, smooths a hand over it, and just like that, the bullet hole is gone.
“If you stay, I stay,” Dean calls out. “We aren’t doing this again.” He swallows hard, the memory of that ticking clock flashing in front of his eyes. “I would’ve stayed. In purgatory. If I hadn’t found you. Did you know that? I was gonna stay. I didn’t – I couldn’t leave you behind. Not again. And I – I never told you. What I had to say down there. I know you said you heard my prayer but that – that wasn’t all of it, Cas. Not by a long shot.”
“Longer than I thought I’d get away with it. You’re getting rusty.”
“For you, always,” Castiel says, because he’s sappy like that sometimes. He brushes a wing down Dean’s arm, where his feather rests, and hums in satisfaction at the resulting spark of warmth. “If you need me, pray.”
Castiel finally shows up a few hours later, when Dean is getting out of the shower in their hotel room. Dean does not flinch when he opens the curtain and finds Castiel two inches away and staring at him, but he does allow Castiel to help him climb out of the shower before he slips and falls flat on his face.
He sounds a bit drunk and when Dean leans forward, he can see that Castiel’s eyes are closed shut and his face is lax like a contend cat. Dean hasn’t even touched his left wing, but it’s fully splayed out and relaxed on the bed, no longer arched up and shielding them both like Castiel normally has it. Dean is sure that at any sign of danger, it would flick up immediately, but for now, Castiel is basically putty in Dean’s hands.
“I can’t,” the Shadow agrees cheerfully. “This is a celestial being only hangout only, kiddo.”
“Aw, you big softy.”
“When I touched you for the first time. It only took a moment.”
The wing drifts a little closer. The colors are even more mesmerizing right under Dean’s nose, because they are truly beyond definition. Calling Castiel’s wings purple and green would be like calling the sun yellow; it’s so much more than that.
, Dean’s angel who burns monsters and ghosts at the snap of his fingers, Dean’s partner who stares down belligerent sheriffs without breaking a sweat, Dean’s soulmate whose fighting is poetry with blade and fists?
“Hmm. I’ll have to speak to my superiors, of course, but it’s unlikely to be rejected.”
Oh, right. He needs to speak. Communicate. Words. Those are things. Castiel can read Dean’s mind, but he doesn’t often, because Dean asked him not to. Because Dean’s an idiot.
“I am glad that you called for me,” Castiel replies. “I love you too.”
So he looks at Castiel with his messy bedhead and backwards tie and weird trench coat, and he says, “Prove it.”
“Absolutely not.”
“I don’t require such weapons. And I can see in the dark, Dean.”
“So, no portal?”
It’s also, perhaps, the most words Dean has least wanted to hear Castiel say.
Dean clears his throat. “Cas? Is that you?”
Castiel pivots on his heel and faces the three remaining demons. His wings snap out and spread wide, sliding between Dean and the demons as if to shield him.
“I’m sure Heaven is much better than down here.”
“Don’t be silly,” it chides, suddenly back to cheerful condescension, not a hint of the rage from earlier. “If I was going to kill you, I’d have to wake Castiel up so he could watch as I slowly flayed your body and soul and mind apart! And with my luck he’d never fall asleep again.”
Those fiery wings close around Dean and Castiel, like a cocoon, and Castiel says, “Dean, where are you hurt?”
“What’s with the wing show? I thought you put them away yesterday cuz you didn’t want people to see.”
“I’m – ” The words die in Dean’s throat, because he is very much not fine, so he quickly switches to: “I’ll be fine.”
“You just got that phone recently,” Castiel points out, because he knows Dean too well.
“Yep,” the Shadow says, in the exact same tone Dean had first used. “Good bye, Dean Winchester. May we never, ever meet again.”
“So that’s what smiting looks like,” Dean says, staring at the monster and its blackened, still faintly smoking face.
Fortunately, when the first feather comes out after Dean touches it, Castiel blows out a long sigh and his shoulders relax. Seeing his clear relief helps Dean get over his instinct to freeze, and he gently lays the feather down at his side.
“When I go back to Heaven for good,” Castiel says softly, “it will be with you, and not a minute, not a
, the phone informs Dean, and he opens the alert on auto-pilot before he remembers just what, exactly, he had set a timer for.
“Oh,” says the woman who is not Sam but is standing in Sam’s apartment, wearing shorts and a Smurfs T-shirt. “I thought the pizza place had for once managed to get to us on time. Are you lost?”
“Listen, your soulmate has no manners, and you better get used to it,” Dean tells him, closing his eyes.
“Huh,” Dean says. “That looks like when a demon is trapped in a – ”
If only he had brought it with him.
But Dean is never able to forget that Castiel is not at all human. He moves too quietly, doesn’t blink or breathe or eat or drink, and stares at Dean if they’re not actively conversing. Hell, even if they are conversing. Sometimes it’s really funny, because Castiel knows exactly nothing about technology or pop culture, but most of the time, Dean will look up and catch Castiel’s gaze and be hard pressed not to shift into fight or flight. Castiel is unmistakably a warrior and a predator, and every instinct Dean has screams at him not to show his back.
, and because of that I did too. I believed we could win. I believed we could fix the world. I believed we could find you again and bring you home. And I believed – ”
She screeches in his face, fury written in every line of her transparent form, and slams him against the tombstone again. It’s not enough to make him lose consciousness, but it is enough for him to know that he’s going to have a fun headache in the morning.
“You’re getting better at this,” Castiel comments.
“You tryin’ lock me in?” Dean jokes weakly.
Dean wastes a bit more time talking about Rowena and the new state of hell. It’s a relief to stop having to watch over their shoulders for demons trying to gank them at every opportunity, for sure, and it sure makes Dean breathe a bit easier when he sends hunters into the field. There are still rogues, of course, but nowadays they encounter a lot more human monsters than demonic ones.
Dean looks at Sam and sees the exact same resigned panic of their soulmates ganging up on them on his brother’s face. And just like that, the spell is broken – Sam ducks away to scoop up his books and close the door and Dean gets out of Jess’s way before she slaps him again. Somehow, they manage to rearrange the chairs and the sofa so that everybody fits in the tiny living room.
“And you’ll just . . . let another angel watch over us.”
What comes out, though, is: “What the
And, well, Dean does the reasonable thing after that: he gets up, he readjusts his clothes, and he charges straight at the Shadow.
Castiel handcuffs Dean to the bed, because he expects Dean to take him at his word but blatantly does not take Dean at his. It’s rude and annoying as hell, so Dean makes faces at him and rattles the cuffs the second Castiel backs away, just because he can.
“Shut up and let me enjoy my breakfast. It’s too early for science lectures, Cas.”
“And after you sleep and are sufficiently rested,” Castiel continues, blithely ignoring him, “I think I would like to have sex.”
The Shadow’s entire body ripples. It points its hands at the floor – or whatever the eternal darkness below their feet is – and more shadowy tendrils bubble up from the floor. The ooze spreads and spreads, until the floor around Dean is shifting and undulating like the sea at night. More figures climb out of the ooze, one by one, until Dean is utterly surrounded on all sides by Castiel doppelgängers, each bearing malicious grins and blank eyes.
Which is when Dean remembers that, oh yeah, Castiel flashed an FBI badge at him. “And you, uh, work for the FBI? Do they know?” he asks, angling for as casual as he can while he goes back to working on escaping the handcuffs. “Or is that fake?”
Specifically, Dean takes one step and then passes out. Because it’s just his luck.
Dean grabs his hand and drags him off before they get arrested. Castiel, after a brief pause where he’s as immovable as a pillar of stone, follows his lead, although he keeps sniffing the air like a damn bloodhound and attracting strange looks from every person they pass. Dean grits his teeth and pulls harder and blesses his lucky stars that he grabbed everything from the sheriff before they went into the morgue.
“Who successfully pursued and achieved a GED in your own time,” Castiel reminds him. “And besides, as you very well know, hunting is more about instincts than college degrees.”
“Oh, apparently there was some demon posse following you. Cas flew off to, uh, interrogate one. He killed the rest. He might also request someone from his garrison to shadow you and Jess. For a couple days, anyways, til we figure this all out.”
Even the humanoid figure at the center of those wings is unnatural. It stands too still, it doesn’t blink, its chest doesn’t rise and fall. And for some reason it’s dressed like a rich person accountant, complete with a full suit, dark blue tie, and long, tan trench coat. Dean’s seen many monsters try to blend in with humanity, but never one who aimed for, like, Wall Street normal.
And swallows hard.
“Which makes three out of three – ”
, there is one person in the entire damn universe who might not leave Dean high and dry like every other member of his family.
And then he sits in the chair, and waits, and hopes.
,” Castiel says, voice as terrible as a roaring forest fire, “touch my soulmate.”
Castiel doesn’t answer. Typical.
Dean turns, just to make sure that the Shadow is stalking him from behind, but he doesn’t see any ooze or tendrils. The feeling of being watched doesn’t go away, either.
Unfortunately, Castiel does not die.
Castiel rolls his eyes just as Sam runs up, dirt smeared across his hands and blood dripping down the side of his face. It’s a job well done, Dean thinks, except of course when he goes to stand up, his ankle and his throbbing head make themselves known again.
“Rugaru are best handled with fire. What’s next?” Castiel asks.
“I, uh, saw an advertisement for a pie festival. Assuming that we get out of this place and ten thousand years haven’t passed, I think we need to go. I’ve bet Sam that I can eat at least ten slices. And hey, even if I lose, that just means more pie to bring home. Plus, you haven’t had some of these varieties yet, Cas, and that’s totally something we need to fix one you are, uh, you know. In possession of a body again. Hey, you did have a vessel again when the Shadow spat you out last time, right? Like you didn’t make your vessel? You popped up fully formed?”
“Like hell do I – ”
He stops, right in front of it, and takes another fortifying breath. Now or never.
After all, it’s a bit late to turn back now.
Dean grabs the pipe, jumps to his feet, and swings as hard as he can at the chanting demon. He connects with a very satisfying
“Better than most. She’s probably going to have lots more questions when she wakes up.”
“Wow. So you really can fly.”
“Uh,” Sam says, “Dean, Castiel, this is my roommate, Brady.”
The sincerity burns Dean better than any whiskey ever has; he has to clear his throat a few times and look away to gather himself. Castiel is not only very literal, he’s just so
With the land, the sky, and the water all accounted for, the soulmate summoning ritual is basically primed for ignition. All that remains is the personal touch, the bit that makes the magic go and seek out the face of his soulmate, his other half, his beloved and relays the image into the flames that appear before the one who is doing the seeking. So Dean grabs the knife, cuts his palm, and lets his blood flow into the bowl, watching as the sigil painted in the grass goes from white to gold and not even wincing as the air begins to crackle with energy.
Then again, the only thing harder than getting into the Empty would be leaving it without what he came here for.
“Oh, so now it’s my fault?”
“Dude, the ghosts are gone and we need to get out of here before anyone comes to check out that light show, we don’t have time for a heart to heart,” Dean points out.
Of course, Sam didn’t shed feathers as long as Dean’s arm.
Dean clears his throat. “Anyone wanna fill me in?”
“Nowhere. But you need to sleep.”
He pushes himself upright. “You uh. Want some help?”
“You really have no idea what it takes to resurrect someone, do you?” the Shadow drawls. It lifts a hand and starts examining it, turning it to and fro, picking at its nail, poking at its skin. “It’s not just a body, Dean. Don’t you remember when Castiel resurrected you? I mean, sure, he gave you a shiny new virgin body, but he also had to reassemble your soul and reconstruct your mind. And Castiel is – how did he say it – a ‘multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent’. He’s a far more complicated puzzle piece than, well, you.”
“You take hot showers.”
Castiel sighs and closes his eyes. “That’s better.”
Castiel laughs at that. “Dean, as I keep reminding you, I am an angel. You would find it very difficult to hurt me.”
Then again, the other reason that most people are happy to leave it to psychics is because sometimes summoning the appearance of your soulmate can cause a feedback loop and an explosion, but Dean isn’t most people.
Such dangerous truths. Dean shuts his eyes and takes a deep breath. If he owes anyone the truth, it’s his soulmate.
And Dean’s gun is on the other side of the barn, but there is a large pipe next to him.
The first door Dean knocks on doesn’t answer, even after ten minutes of rattling the knob, so Dean gives up. The second door is opened by a bleary-eyed woman in a thick robe, who snaps that she just checked in at the crack of dawn and knows nothing and if Dean asks her another question she’s going to strangle him with her bare hands. And the third door, well, the less said about the eyeful Dean got in there the better.
“Nothing of import.”
Castiel raises an arm – and then stops. It looks like he hits an invisible wall, and when he presses hard against it, his hand doesn’t move an inch. And Dean has seen Castiel lift a car with one hand without any effort.
And, well, Dean has to kiss him for that. He pulls on Castiel’s arms and Castiel comes, like he always done, answering Dean with an open heart and matching him beat for beat, like they are two puzzle pieces fitting perfectly together, two birds in perfect flight, two notes in perfect harmony. They kiss until Dean is dizzy and breathless, as much from the lack of air as from the sheer wonder that is having Castiel.
“Thought you didn’t need sleep,” Dean mocks, because if he thinks for more than a second about having Castiel’s wing on him, he is going to pee his pants. Or spontaneously combust.
Castiel squeezes his shoulder tight. It feels possessive, like a brand. Dean should want to pack up and run away and never look back, but he doesn’t. He wants to lean into Castiel, into his constant unending staring, into his confused face when Dean makes jokes, into his soft, silky, strong wings. He wants to believe that just this once he gets lucky, and he gets to have this amazing soulmate who is all his, who is an angel of the Lord and somehow wants
Dean’s hands, curled in an anxious tight ball on his lap, snap open like Castiel just gave the password to a lockbox. It would be embarrassing if he weren’t wound so tightly that if Castiel weren’t holding him up with his wings he’d probably fall off the bed.
, Dean’s soulmate who likes burgers, hates jam, and one time wandered off in the middle of an interrogation to follow a bee and came back an hour later with honey. Cas, who likes to sun his wings in the morning and watch children’s cartoons all night along.
Dean whistles lowly. “Wow, you’re ugly,” he comments.
Fortunately, Castiel seems content to just sit there. It’s a little creepy, the way he watches Dean without ever seeming to blink, but Dean’s eaten under worse conditions and cold fries are disgusting, so he just keeps shoveling food in his mouth until it’s all gone and he can sprawl back in his chair with a contented burp.
“No. I have been searching for you for
And, Christ, what the hell is Dean supposed to do with that? What is he supposed to do when an angel, a celestial being, a warrior of God looks at him and says
“As fine as I can be,” Dean replies, shaking his head to try and make the ringing in his ears stop. “You?”
So he goes on the offensive. Looking up, he crosses his arms and says, “What’s it to you?”
The demon hums a little and flicks an imaginary speck of dust from his collar. “Well, I want a lot of things: a vacation, and a tender soul to rend apart on the rack, and maybe a hellhound. But, you know, I figured, might as well start small. This meatsuit’s a little . . . beaten up. Honestly it’s barely holding together. Can’t quite contain all of . . . well, me.” He smirks, walking forward. “But then I got to thinking – rumor has it that a seraph of Heaven has been following around a human, and he’s got his own personal, made to order, practically indestructible meatsuit! And, well, if it can hold an angel, certainly it can hold little ol’ me.”
The Shadow presses still-black fingers to its temples and rubs like it has a migraine. It mutters something under its breath, still in a language Dean doesn’t know, and heaves a deep sigh. “Fine,” it says, “fine, fine,
“And I’ve missed you too,” Dean says, lamely. “It’s not the same. Without you. I’ve had to drive that ugly car of yours, for starters. We are so getting you a better car. We’ve got like seven dozen in the garage, one of them must – ”
Dean bites his lip. “That’s . . . a lot more than a werewolf normally takes,” he mutters. He prods tentatively at the seriously savaged body. “Maybe it is a – Cas, what are you doing?”
“And you know what will rejuvenate me? Sex.”
“Prove it,” Dean repeats.
So, of course, that’s when the demons find them.
Dean swallows hard and is suddenly very, very grateful that Castiel is his soulmate and didn’t smite him the second he came down from Heaven.
“Are you worried about Sam? We would recruit him as well, and offer him tuition assistance if he wishes to complete his degree.”
“Hell yes, you can go procure me some breakfast.”
“I don’t understand that reference,” Castiel replies grumpily. “Also, you still have not explained why
, high-pitched and agonized. Dean yells too, because this hurts more than all the kicks and punches combined, like Castiel’s true voice but amped up to a thousand, at once too high and too low, tearing through the very fiber of his being like shockwaves on the level of his soul.
Dean crosses his arms and glares at the doppelgänger. It’s a little disconcerting, to say the least; Dean had just gotten used to the featureless darkness that stretched in every direction around him when parts of the darkness had started moving, tentacles writhing and flowing together to coalesce into a humanoid figure. He’d been duly impressed – until colors had rippled across the blackness and resolved themselves into Castiel, blue eyes and tan trench coat and dark hair.
Dean tells himself.
“No. I like it.”
“You are my soulmate,” Castiel states, deep and low and unyielding as diamond. “You touching my wing is not anymore blasphemous than me touching your arm.”
expecting Castiel’s eyes to light up to a blinding blue, or Castiel’s hand to start glowing, or Castiel to press said glowing hand right to his chest.
And, oh yeah, that’s right. Dean is doing this for Castiel too. Sam should meet Dean’s soulmate, that’s only right. And Dean should congratulate Sam on surviving a semester at college, that’s also right. It’s the proper brotherly thing to do.
“From other demons?”
Just because he can, Dean raises a hand and waves obnoxiously, because he’s sure the Shadow is still watching. Then he turns around and starts walking before the Shadow decides to go back on its word and flay him alive anyways.
He’s just craning his head to make the turn where he hears the strangest sort of flapping, rustling noise, like a nature documentary has interrupted the radio. Dean turns his head and is nearly slapped in the face by a huge wing.
“To recruit you, not arrest you,” Castiel explains. “You can refuse to work with us, you know. And I thought. Well. I would not hold you here if it wasn’t what you wanted, Dean.”
Fortunately, now that Castiel is actually out of his way – although he still keeps moving, orbiting Dean at a careful three steps away like he’s the moon and Dean is the earth and it’s terribly distracting – Dean is able to get everything else packed in short order. It’s not much, since Dean learned a long time ago not to get attached, but Dean still double checks the table, bed, and drawer before he zips up his bag and heads out. Castiel follows like a silent puppy as Dean locks the room, checks out at the front desk, and raids the vending machine, and yet, somehow, when Dean goes to head out into the parking lot, there is no stalker shadow at his back when he reaches the Impala.
“Yes, Jack has given us all our wings back. He has also reopened Heaven. I suspect within time he may need to make new angels, but for now at least, Heaven has stabilized.”
The thing about salt and burns is that they are either classic, straightforward, and easy, or they’re difficult, complex, and really, really obnoxious. Dean had been hoping that this would be one of the classic ones, especially given that they have an extra hand to move dirt and conduct research, but the second his shovel hits wood, there’s an unholy, eerie screech, and he’s getting hauled out of the grave by a seriously pissed off ghost.
The flames burn out, abruptly, going from roaring forest fire to simmering ashes in seconds, the magic in the ritual having consumed all the blood Dean gave it. Dean swears and kicks at the bowl, and then swears some more when the heat sears his toes through his shoes. He examines the sigil in the grass, now seared into the ground, but it’s as perfect as the one he looked up last night, and all the ingredients were legitimate. And the invocation isn’t exactly easily messed up, given how short it is.
,” Castiel snarls, and then he stomps forward and grabs Dean by the lapel and lifts him clear off the floor, clearly mostly recovered from their little foray into what passes as death for angels. “How could you do something so
“Dude!” Dean exclaims, because seriously. “Would you just let me go? I promise I won’t come back.”
Dean would totally give up his memory foam for Castiel, but Castiel doesn’t need to know it. Instead he just grins and says, “Second nightstand is all yours, then.”
The way Castiel’s eyes narrow tells Dean that he totally heard the attempted lie.
“You two are going to gang up on me, aren’t you?” Dean sighs.
“Yeah, Sam got her up to speed. You can probably give her the anti-possession sigil tomorrow.”
Dean tips his head forward and rests it against Castiel’s neck. Castiel takes his weight easily, and Dean knows that even if Castiel lost his powers and couldn’t actually pick Dean up with one hand without breaking a sweat, he’d still let Dean do this, and that knowledge is heady.
The roiling mess in his stomach is even worse, now. He has no idea what he imagined Castiel’s response would be, but somehow what Castiel did say is even worse. Because Castiel is
There is a moment of silence. Dean stares at the Shadow. The Shadow stares at Dean.
Dean clears his throat. “You, uh, sure that’s a good diversion of Heaven’s resources?”
“I suppose grace would register as warmth to human skin,” Castiel says, which explains exactly nothing, but the smile is back on his face, and his wings shimmer back to that gorgeous array of blacks and purples and greens. He turns himself around and one of his wings arcs towards Dean, curving to a stop just in front of his knees. “Would you like to touch them?”
“No, teleportation is – ”
“How the hell do you know about Sam?”
“An ancient Kurdish – ”
“How did you think angels conducted combat? With their fists?”
“Well, the knife does not work on
Still, he can’t let Castiel win. “Hey, I survived over twenty years without you.”
Luckily, Castiel doesn’t seem to notice. He walks over to the briefcase on the desk, presses a few buttons, and it snaps open. He immediately starts rifling through, so completely focused it’s like he’s forgotten Dean’s in the room.
“There’s our ticket out,” Dean announces, pointing like Castiel doesn’t have eyes because, hey, maybe he doesn’t yet. “You and me, we’re almost home.”
“Your bed has your beloved memory foam,” Castiel answers, which is fair enough.
“I’ll watch over you,” Castiel says and perches on the desk chair like some kind of night sentry, unblinking as always. Dean’s learned the hard way that Castiel takes almost everything very, very literally now, and he can just imagine Castiel staring at him all night, and just. No.
“Are we getting a motel room?”
The lightshow ends as abruptly as it began. The monster’s screams cut off as abruptly as though it had been muted, and Castiel lets it fall to a heap in the ground, his expression shifting into quiet disinterest. He looks more like he just stepped on an ant than he murdered a monster via angelic power, not the least bit out of breath or scared.
And for the icing on the cake, before Dean can even register his new position or protest, Castiel is lowering his wing back down, covering them both like a warm, fluffy, bullet proof blanket.
“Dean,” Sam breathes, and the flood of emotions on his face is almost too painful to see. Especially the fear. Sam should never be afraid.
But Dean steels himself and steadies his hand, because hey, hunters discover new monsters all the time. It’s kind of how hunting works. He even tries to cheer himself up with the knowledge that if he does discover this creature and kill it, he’ll probably get to name it.
“My true form is approximately the size of your Chrysler Building,” Castiel explains mildly, like he’s explaining how to load a gun and not confiding precious bits of angelic lore. “This vessel allows me to compress myself to your plane of existence, but it is . . . I suppose the closest analogy would be putting your foot in a shoe that is a few times smaller. Serviceable, but not exactly the most comfortable.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says, and lifts his face asking for a kiss. Perhaps he’s greedy, and certainly Sam has actually pelted them with a tomato when they got carried away in the kitchen, but this is still too shiny and new for Dean not to be greedy. He’ll take everything of Castiel he can get, everything and anything, until the sun burns out and the stars fall and the earth crumbles to ash.
“Cas?”
“Not ten of them in a week.”
“I know what else you like,” Dean says, because it’s been years but he still remembers almost everything about their night together: the way Castiel’s eyes widened when he pressed their groins together; the gorgeous noises he made when Dean sunk his teeth into Castiel’s neck; how Castiel purred like a cat when Dean stroked his hair. Each moment, shining and perfect in a little Castiel collection – one ready for expansion. “But maybe we should go for a refresher? Just in case.”
“I’m – ”
“What is it?”
He starts with, perhaps, the easiest. “I’m sorry.” They’re words he’s said so many times – to John, to Sam – and usually it gets brushed off.
“Wait, are you serious?”
Surprisingly, though, the Shadow does not fly into a rage, like the archangels did, or reel back in shock, like the princes of hell did. A smile curves the lips of the one Dean is looking at, revealing perfect black teeth, and it says, “My, my, you really are a brave one. Castiel’s memories did not do you justice.”
No matter what Dean does – stomping his feet, yelling at the top of his lungs, clapping his hands – the Shadow does not re-emerge. Even worse, the feeling of being watched ratchets up. It was already bad when the Shadow was prowling around him; now the hairs on the back of his head are really standing up, and it’s even worse when Dean remembers just how many powerful, ancient, dead celestial beings are probably all around, trapped in eternal slumber, probably just out of Dean’s eyesight.
“God, me too,” Sam replies, and he tightens his arms so much that Dean’s ribs creak in protest. Any tighter and he’d probably break something.
“I don’t sense any EMF or sulphur, so that rules out ghostly and demonic activity,” Castiel says. “This person did suffer from a mild . . . hmm. A mild bladder infection.”
and know that he’s referring to his own. It’s even more of a thrill to see the way Castiel clearly lights up – and not the scary way with his powers, the normal people way where he sits up straighter and his smile widens. It ignites a swarm of warm and hopelessly soft butterflies in his stomach.
And Dean can’t answer (
Castiel tucks something warm and soft and long into his open hands. It feels a lot like a feather.
“I also maybe said that you might get them an angel babysitter?”
“I. I, uh.” Dean looks sideways, down, left, right. Anywhere to escape Castiel’s piercing blue eyes. “Angels aren’t exactly common, okay?”
Dean side-eyes him for that, halfway through his burger, and then regrets it and nearly chokes when Sam claps him heavily on the back and whispers, “Don’t be a self-sacrificing jerk.”
“Dean?” Castiel-the-one-time-roll-in-the-sack-Dean-accidentally-came-out-to says, blinking rapidly. “Is that . . . Is that you?”
“I must admit that I don’t quite grasp how human transactions work, but that sounds like an expensive endeavor.”
Brady screams in agony when Castiel’s palm touches his face. Sam yells in shock, Jess shrieks – and then it’s over.
Which is, of course, when the door bursts open and Sam leaps into the room.
“I can’t lie to you.”
The Shadow shrieks in rage. Its outline goes blurry again, dark tendrils and black ooze, and this time when it reassembles, it pounces onto Dean’s chest and locks its hands around his throat.
It shouldn’t help, this reminder of how gone they are for each other, but it does, somehow. It gives Dean the strength to turn his face into Castiel’s palm and plant a tiny kiss on the skin there, a silent
“But you need rest,” Castiel objects. “The spell to resurrect me took a lot of energy – ”
“Okay, but . . .”
“No wonder God wanted to wipe you out.” The Shadow sighs. “Normally, this is when I would fling you out of the nearest portal powered by your soul. But nooooooooooooo. Castiel
“We all have our faults,” Castiel tells him. “You are not the only person who lashes out when they feel impatient, or angry, or scared. Or who fails to communicate when it would be wise.”
“Yes, Dean?”
Still, at least Dean hasn’t been cried on or had to awkwardly comfort anyone, so he’s whistling happily as he knocks on the fourth door and waits for an answer.
Castiel inclines his head at the door. “Well, is there anyone else who you are hunting with who is now attempting to pick the lock on my door?”
A huge gust of wind blows into the clearing when the creature alights on the grass. The wings, which had already been terrifying by the size of their shadows alone, are truly awe-inspiring, stretching to the edges of the clearing, flexing and shifting, and Dean would almost think that they’re real feathers of a real bird. But they’re not, he knows they’re not, because the colors – deep greens and purples that darken into black as deep as midnight – are out of this world and utterly unnatural.
Castiel has his chin lifted, as if to increase the surface area upon which the sun can shine, and he is sitting cross legged and shirtless, his back a wide expanse of smooth, unmarked skin as far as Dean’s eyes can see. Most damning of all, though, are his wings, which are spread up and wide, curving where they’re too long and about to bump into the wall.
, he is an angel billions of years older than Dean, he’s fought wars more ancient than Dean’s own bloodline, and he probably did have a plan that was more elegant than Dean’s
“Or I’ll find the one wacko who didn’t.”
“You were a very difficult quarry.”
Which is when, of course, the ghost comes back.
Castiel flicks his blade up, fury in every line of his face. His wings crackle like thunderstorms behind him and Dean is sure that if he could get out of the angel trap, he’d burn the entire place to the ground instantly. “You dare to attack one of Heaven’s Host?”
Then again, Dean’s not really ready to talk about that.
The Shadow screams and screams and screams, and each scream hurts Dean, but Dean’s touch seems to hurt the Shadow more, so Dean grits his teeth and tightens his hands and puts everything he has to holding on. It’s probably the hardest thing he’s ever done, but if Castiel is in reach, if Castiel’s life is stake, if Dean can get Castiel back – it’s all worth it.
“Uh. . . should I not call you that? It’s a nickname.” When Castiel continues to stare at him, Dean explains hastily, “Humans give nicknames as like. A sign of affection. It’s not an insult, I promise.”
Which is why Dean is here, alone in the woods at daybreak, spray painting a sigil into the grass and praying that this soulmate summoning thing actually works. That maybe, just
Castiel looks down at the empty plate, a mournful expression in his eyes. “Ah. I seem to have finished it.”
The woman’s eyes, which were already wide when she heard Castiel’s name, go saucer-sized when she hears
! You owe me and god damn it, I will say it right here and now and let every sleeping monster in this place hear me if you don’t get back here right now.”
would have a soulmate who works for the FBI and wants to recruit us and – and you found him years ago and slept with him and ran away! Only you, Dean!”
. Castiel trembles against him.
“Not that either.”
“Um,” Dean says eloquently. “Hi?”
“You’re not a hammer, Cas. You tried to fix Heaven, and yeah, you messed up, but hey, I started the apocalypse, I’m not one to talk. And you – you changed me too. You had
“So,” Dean says, “I got some stuff to say, Cas. You better put your listening ears on. Or listening wings, whatever.”
It’s a pretty basic sigil, all things considered. Five points, a star in the center, and various symbols of protection and invocation scattered around the edges. Most people don’t bother learning it because psychics insist only they can properly use it, but the truth is that anyone can use this summoning sigil as long as they know how to draw it correctly, and the first thing Dean learned to draw after his name was a devil’s trap.
are lying to you?” he repeats. “So what the hell are you?”
“You’ll also increase your chances of getting lost.”
Dean says, “I need a drink.”
Dean turns around. The Shadow is standing behind him, still wearing Castiel’s face, but now instead of malice, wariness lines every inch of its alien form. It looks at Dean like a lion who has bitten a mouse only to find out that the mouse’s whiskers are razorblades. And there is black ooze all over its hands, like it’s trying to reform itself but can’t quite.
Castiel does not like pancakes, waffles, or hash browns. He makes a curious face at the eggs, but ultimately declines those too.
“You have a . . . baby?” Castiel pronounces the word like it’s a foreign concept and not, like, the beginning stage for every human being. It’s adorable, and Dean should not find it adorable, but he does.
Sam chokes on his burger. “A what?”
So Dean croaks out, “Why the hell did you answer the call?”
Next up is water. It doesn’t matter whether water or air is represented next, since humans can use both, but Dean would rather put the holy water in now as a deterrent against evil morons gatecrashing the party, so he empties the flask over the earth in the bowl and repeats again, “I invoke, conjure, and command you, appear unto me before this circle.”
“Oh, nothing much. Just tore into his mind and laid open every little juicy wound,” Shadow says casually. “Every single morsel of regret, every single bite of fear, every little drop of sadness – ah, they were delicious. I do think Castiel has been my favorite, to be honest. I could feed off of him, well, forever.”
“I would resurrect him,” Castiel shoots back. He says it as casually as he says
And wow, if there weren’t already a bevy of alarm bells going off in Dean’s head, there is, like, an entire army of them now. “How do you have my fingerprints?” Dean asks warily, sizing Castiel up and thinking about the knife in his boot.
Still muttering, the Shadow turns away and raises its hand. It snaps its fingers and Dean flinches, because that sound never usually bodes well, but nothing happens beyond a weird reverberation in the darkness around them. It kind of sounds like a huge something in the distance has fallen.
“Yes.”
Dean about falls off the bed.
vessel. And that is assuming that the demon would even survive contact with the grace that would linger inside the vessel.”
Dean clears his throat. “That sounds like you plan to, uh, stick around. With me. On Earth. Even though I just pissed you off.”
“Yes.” Castiel strokes his thumb against Dean’s shoulder, like he’s reassuring himself. “Every second we were apart, I counted. I had to know.”
But Castiel looks at Dean, and his eyes . . .
,” Castiel repeats, and he’s not just glowing, he’s vibrating with energy that crackles all up and down his wings and torso. An awful, high pitched ringing sound splits the air and Dean cringes, curling in on himself, tucking his face into his knees and covering his ears with his hand as Castiel goes nuclear on the demons.
“I’ll need to hide my wings again, so I might as well get used to the human way of travel. Even if it is remarkably slower.”
“I’m not well versed in firearms, no. But I can protect myself.”
His great big wings spread wide and then Castiel is gone with the sound of feathers, leaving Dean with a pissed off Sam, a very confused Jessica, and a smoking demon corpse.
“Ugh, fine,” Dean groans. “This is revenge for every time I tried to make you talk about purgatory, isn’t it? Fine. Well, we covered Jack. Uh, so Rowena is queen of hell now. Yeah. She whipped them into shape fast. No more demon deals.”
“I said,
“I know how you see yourself, Dean,” Castiel tells him solemnly. “You see yourself the way our enemies see you: destructive and angry and broken. And you think that hate and anger is all you are. But I see
About five minutes later, Dean gets bored of the silence. He really wishes he could hear or see Castiel, but the Empty seems to swallow all sound and he doesn’t actually want his eyes to burn out of his skull Pamela-style, so Dean does what he does best: he opens his mouth and fills the echoing nothingness with his own voice.
The demon looks at the ground, where the angel trap is, and then back up. “Not from inside that trap, you wouldn’t,” he says smugly. “You’re cut off from Heaven. And who knows how long it would take for someone to come by and let you out? Your human might be nothing but dust and bone fragments by then.”
The second thing Dean sees is Sam and his shaggy hair flopping all over his face as he leans over Dean.
Dean swallows hard and pinches himself, just to be sure. Then he reaches out one trembling hand and touches Castiel’s wing, and god. There are no words. The feathers are unbelievably silky, like the best, highest count thread sheets Dean has ever laid down on. They’re also incredibly strong when he runs his hand down one, because they don’t even bend a little bit under his pressure. And, best of all, they are
“Hey, don’t insult my car.”
Castiel is still there in the morning. Dean might dismiss it as a hallucination or a very vivid dream, but when he yawns and rolls over, scrubbing at his eyes, the sight that greets him is way beyond his ability to imagine.
Silence falls again, and Dean no longer feels like he’s being hunted.
“And I’m just supposed to, what, trust you?” Dean sneers.
It becomes a ritual for them: Dean finds a hunt, Castiel rides shotgun, Dean interrogates witnesses and cops while Castiel looms in the background, they find the monster and kill it, and afterwards they go and find some pie and burgers to celebrate. Dean educates Castiel on pop culture and music and How Humans Act, and Castiel talks Dean’s ear off about the inaccuracies in monster lore and, weirdly enough, bees.
Castiel opens one eye and glares at him. “I am restoring my grace through my connection to Heaven,” he says archly, all high and mighty like Dean didn’t have to carry him all the way from the car and dump his motionless body on the bed. “It is a slow process and very taxing. And I did not wish to leave you.”
He takes a deep breath. Sam had tried to have a heart to heart with Dean, after he’d looked up from their dinner with Eileen and the rest and saw Dean’s face, but Dean had brushed him off. There are some things a man can only say to their . . . well, whatever the hell Castiel is to him.
Well, one dude and one angel of the Lord.
Castiel makes an amused sound. “You should read the Bible,” he remarks, which is so not what Dean expected him to say. “Angels are warriors of God. I’m a soldier, Dean. Fluffy wings would only be a detriment in combat. And if I showed you my halo, your eyes would burn out of your skull.”
Castiel takes one look at the article and makes a face. “You think that is supernatural in origin? Animals do attack humans, Dean.”
Castiel gives him a look over his shoulder that says he doesn’t quite believe Dean. His wings don’t vanish, but they do fold up, pressing close to Castiel’s back and making him look suddenly smaller again. Vulnerable.
They’ve kissed before of course, many times. Dean likes to kiss Castiel’s neck or the arch of his back, and sometimes he is daring and kisses Castiel’s feathers for the shivers it earns him. Castiel likes whatever part of Dean he can get; he seems to be equally as enamored with Dean’s back as his face.
“I hate you,” Dean declares and stomps towards Sam’s apartment building before he can lose his nerve again.
“Personal space,” Dean repeats. “Like. My space bubble. That other people don’t come into. Because it’s mine.”
“Guess again.”
Dean opens his eyes all the way. He blinks. Blinks again.
Castiel, the bastard, isn’t even out of breath when he snaps, “Stop struggling. I’m not going to hurt you, Dean.”
“ – a phoenix,” Castiel is saying.
“Why her?”
And, just like that, Castiel comes alive again: his hand clenches too tight on Dean’s shoulder, his wings close in and push them together, and Castiel brings his face so close that if he did breathe, they’d be sharing breaths.
,” Castiel snarls in response, and Dean jumps because he didn’t even see Castiel stand, but his soulmate is standing in front of him now, fists clenched at his sides.
Dean freezes. Because he can’t possibly have heard that correctly. “What?”
“Dean!” Castiel snaps. “Angels may not have the freedom of thought and will that humans do, but do not do me the disservice of thinking me an unfeeling robot. Any angel with a human soulmate has a standing order to protect them; what hurts you hurts us, and what hurts us hurts the Host, and what hurts the Host hurts Heaven itself. Furthermore, I have fought demons many more times than you have. I am older than the Earth, Dean; I killed demons in the first war, when Michael cast down Lucifer, and I have commanded garrisons against them many times after that. Even if the demons had succeeded in forcing me out, I would have returned to destroy them, because this is
Castiel hums in the affirmative. “I can give Sam and Jess anti-possession sigils like the one I gave you. If they want.”
Of course, things are different now.
Then, confusingly, Castiel moves and
Dean glares at him. Castiel hadn’t really reacted when Dean had given him a fake ID for Castiel Winchester, and it’s just like him to use the full name now when he wants to punch Dean in the heart.
“I am not saying ‘what the heaven.’”
“You’re an angel.”
“That other people and
Castiel dutifully blinks. Just once. And just one eye.
Dean is just putting his key into the ignition when a thought occurs to him. “You know how to use a gun, right?”
Dean lifts his hand and reaches for the closest patch. Then he hesitates when a new fear takes shape. “What if I pull some out?”
“What the hell?”
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel says. His voice is deeper and rougher than normal, like he’s spent all night screaming instead of being silently passed out on the bed. “Why are you on the floor?”
“We salt and burn the – oh, okay, good to know angels can just, uh, set fire to bodies,” Dean says belatedly, after Castiel has snapped his fingers and gotten a healthy little blaze going. He’s a little sad, because it’s cathartic as hell to burn the monster and know it’ll never hurt anyone else, but then he brightens, because there’s another post hunt ritual he can drag Castiel into instead.
The Empty rumbles around him, like the sounds of something huge lumbering forward, but just as Dean flinches, certain he’s about to be eaten, a new sound enters the area. It’s a single high note, like a bell being rung, and as it echoes, it rises in pitch to an ear-splitting whine instead of falling like a normal bell.
Dean shuffles his feet. It’s one thing to discuss the supernatural with those in the know, but with civilians who don’t it’s a whole other ballgame. And Dean hates being the one who has to give the Talk.
“I presumed you were being overly cautious.”
“Don’t you dare, Cas,” Dean snaps.
Castiel hums. “I prefer the word soulmates. Less dumb. Less ass.”
Dean glares.
The demon’s face sours dramatically. “Fine,” he spits. “Then we’ll do this the hard way.”
“Are my wings not proof enough?”
Castiel stares at him like he doesn’t understand English. Dean gestures wildly between them and almost whacks Castiel on the arm, because Castiel is seriously way too damn close.
All of this has now created a nice little patch of empty floor where Castiel is, apparently, sunning himself.
. His eyes are shining that white-hot blue, his outline is flickering like flames dancing, and there are two huge, spectral, fiery things that are arcing out of his back. They’re so bright they look like someone cut a hole in the void of the night sky and revealed a second sun hiding in another plane of existence. They’re terrifying and beautiful and they are moving as Castiel does, like they have a mind of their own.
Dean tugs off one shoe and then tackles the other. “Well, I need my four hours, so . . .”
“Yes.”
“Dean, are you okay?”
Wings, Dean realizes dimly. Castiel’s wings, pure fire like the phoenix he is.
The entire bowl ignites like it was filled with gasoline and not wet dirt and a feather. The flames shoot up high, intense enough that Dean stumbles back a little, because he’d expected, like, a human-face-sized bit of flame for him to peer into and not a column of light that stretches towards the sky like a skyscraper. He also knows that the flames sometimes are different colors depending on exactly what materials are used to represent the three elements, but he’s never heard of or seen flames in this color, this white-hot blue light that reminds him of star fire and comets.
“Of course I want you,” Castiel tells him. “Of course I want this. Why do you think I searched for you for so long?”
The Shadow leaps off of him, staring at its hands. “What have you done?” it spits. “What are you?”
“Hey, Cas,” he says, quieter this time. “Took you long enough.”
“Hey, Cas,” Dean says quietly. “I guess that’s my cue to go, then.”
“The Bureau’s been tracking you for a long time. I was assigned your case when I was promoted to heading my own team.”
“I could learn more if I – ” Castiel begins to say, and lowers his hand towards the open chest cavity he had been sniffing.
“Shut up!” the Shadow roars, and hits him again so he goes sprawling on his back. “Shut up, shut up,
Dean closes his eyes.
“Promise on what?”
“Yep. Oh.”
“Didn’t you talk about personal space?” Castiel retorts.
“No!”
His ankle goes bright with pain and a scream bubbles out of his throat, echoing in the dim night. Fortunately, it coincides with Sam’s own yelps, so at least Dean can be safe in knowing he’s not alone in being attacked.
That’s when Dean realizes that the monster isn’t glowing; Castiel is, and he’s basically burning the monster alive.
That being said, Dean finds no salt barrier, no iron, no silver, and when he toes back the rug, he sees no devil’s trap.
And stops.
He works through Castiel’s left wing, combing through healthy feathers and gently tugging out loose ones, and midway he looks over and sees that Castiel has let his head loll to the right, appearing for all intents and purposes like he’s fallen asleep again. He looks strangely young like that, not the millennia-old warrior of God or the intense, unyielding celestial being who’d flown down and claimed Dean as his. He just looks like
“You can’t be serious.”
So that leaves Dean with the worst case scenario – the one where he sits around and waits and hopes.
“I’m not leaving without him.”
It’s not Sam.
Or worse, pity.
Dean tries to imagine Castiel engaging in the types of sins Dean does. He pictures Castiel drunk, tie loosened, shirt unbuttoned, eyes glazed over, voice even deeper from too much alcohol, even more prone to staring and touching Dean and saying all kinds of stupidly intimate stuff, and all too suddenly that is just. Too much. Dean’s just done with the day.
are you?”
The hunt starts off innocuously enough. There’s a town where people are going missing in droves and their families are reporting that they all went nuts beforehand: lashed out, showed inhuman strength, got weirdly obsessed over strange things like salt-free diets. One or two crazies going off their rocker is weird; seventeen and counting means something supernatural is afoot.
A hand on his knee cuts him off. Castiel’s hand is as warm and grounding as his wings, fingers closed firmly on his knee. He has no idea how it’s comfortable for Castiel, but he shuffles forward to close the distance anyways, until his chest brushes against Castiel’s back when he breathes.
He walks in silence for a little bit, after all. Silence with Castiel is never really silence, after all. Castiel can be still as stone, but he’s been around humans long enough to pick up their ticks; he blinks, sometimes, he shuffles his hands and feet, he leans forward or moves back. And he can pack a whole insult in a single glare.
Dean suddenly wishes he hadn’t insisted he and Castiel split up.
“A moron wearing Castiel’s face?”
“Cas – ”
Which all means one thing: Dean has no soulmate.
The Shadow easily evades his grip. Dean’s not sure whether it moves or it moves him, but he blinks and it’s exactly the same distance away as it was before he jumped. The many doppelgängers stick their hands in their pockets, lax and slouched in a way Castiel never was, and the Shadow’s voice echoes from a new doppelgänger at Dean’s back.
“Damn it,” Dean says.
“Hmm. And Sam?”
“I gotta check out of the hotel. Make sure Baby is okay. And, uh, probably try and find someplace to eat.”
their boyfriend back!” the thing wearing Castiel’s face splutters.
Castiel’s angel mojo gets them into the apartment building, and fortunately, most of the college students are too harried to give them a second glance. That or Castiel is redirecting them. Either way, Dean is very happy that they don’t get stopped or questioned, because he really is sweating too hard to throw on his fake smile and turn up the charm, and relying on Castiel to lie convincingly is like asking a vampire not to drink blood.
But instead, Castiel’s right wing slowly curves backwards, all of those gorgeous purple and green feathers brushing up against Dean’s arm, tentative like a kicked puppy who is hopeful for pets instead of blows but can’t be sure. This close, Dean can see the numerous patches where feathers were ruffled out of alignment by the fight and the demons, and he’s almost too afraid to touch them and make it worse, even though he’s the one that offered.
Castiel hums. “It was more uncomfortable than I thought, containing my wings within this vessel. I would prefer to have them out when I can, if you don’t mind. Also, I can tend to them much more easily in this form than on the plane we hide our wings on.”
Some animal instinct in Dean – the primal, raw beating heart of his soul, the part that John honed into a fine hunter – wants to turn tail and flee, because he’s never seen any monster that looks like this, that has this kind of otherworldly power, that can part the heavens and command the sunlight. And no demon would do this kind of lightshow, they’d just hop in his meatsuit and drag him all over the earth.
Castiel relaxes his palm and the blade winks out of existence. It almost looks like Castiel slides it up his sleeve, but there’s no telltale bulge of weaponry up his arm, and Dean figures it makes more sense for Castiel to be able to summon his blade and wings out of another plane than to just physically carry a blade around all the time.
The feeling of being watched shifts, a little bit. It’s like a tiny tug in his gut. It feels a bit like sadness.
Dean throws himself to the side as the creature blows past the spot where he was. It smells truly awful and it’s snarling like a motor engine, landing on all fours like a cat and baring misshapen teeth at Dean.
“Vessel?” Dean repeats, because that’s a word that never goes well in sentences. He slides out of his bed and crosses to the other one so that he can stare more closely at Castiel, because he didn’t think angels would be like demons – but then again, his references for angels are cartoons and church stained glass windows. “Are you possessing some poor bastard?”
Except: “I don’t sleep,” Castiel says, frowning slightly. “Angels do not require rest anymore than we require sustenance.”
“And now,” Castiel says when Dean stares at him with accusing eyes, “you cannot run. You can, however, get off the bed. Is this acceptable?”
It’s perfect.
Castiel takes two more.
“Sam! Cas! You okay?”
Plus: “Cas can fly anywhere on Earth in like the blink of an eye. If you need me, I’ll be here,” Dean promises.
All at once, Dean feels completely wide awake, energized and alert, all his aches gone, all his needs satisfied. It’s like eating a full course dinner without the bellyache and drinking a whole case of beer without the intoxication. It’s amazing.
Dean lifts his gun, cocks it, and points it straight up at the heavens –
Later that night, Dean is just changing into his comfortable dead guy robe when he hears the distinct flapping of feathers that comes with angel express, and he grins and looks up to see Castiel standing at the end of his bed.
“Only you,” Sam wheezes, “only
“This is a very small room,” Castiel observes, from
“They’re your family, Dean. That means they’re mine as well.”
Maybe someone else would be uneasy walking into a forest in the middle of nowhere when it’s still dark outside, but Dean has a gun and a stake, and he’s not afraid to use either.
Meanwhile, it appears his brother and his soulmate have managed to cover introductions, brief each other, and start researching, because the bed Dean had been chained to is now covered by papers, and both Castiel and Sam have their laptops open.
“I don’t know, I figured you would have flapped back to Heaven by now! Don’t you have important angel things to do?”
Castiel’s casual, off-hand tone catches on that roiling feeling in Dean’s stomach like sticks in a bicycle chain, jamming everything into a great big mess. Dean says lowly, “Are you planning to report to your superiors that you were gonna serve those demons up an angelic vessel on a silver platter?”
He swats at her, even though he knows it won’t help anything because the shovel is still in the grave and he doesn’t have any iron, and she laughs in his face. Cold hands wrap around his throat and go tight, and Dean gasps and struggles and kicks futilely at thin air.
So Dean says it again, because he’s learned that words are important. “I love you, Cas.”
, like a bath that’s just a little too hot but is perfect to soothe away the injuries of a long hunt.
“I will return,” Castiel replies, completing their little ritual, and the soft look on his face – that’s all for Dean.
“Oh, Cas is an angel.”
Castiel takes one step back.
“Well, this ain’t my credit card,” Dean informs him smugly, and flags down the waitress to order more food. Fortunately, this is a 24/7 diner, and serves breakfast all day, so Dean grabs Castiel’s fries and sets about ordering some breakfast.
“That’s not gonna happen,” Dean tells him and drops the second shoe by the first.
Dean clears his throat. “So. Uh. Sam. Wanna give Jess the Talk?”
One downside of Castiel sharing a bed with him: he sometimes starts super deep conversations when Dean is half asleep. Probably because he knows Dean is more likely to blurt out the truth. Because he knows Dean like that.
“Oh,” Castiel says, brightening. His wings fluff up and spread wide, as if he’s preparing to fly. “A human method of transport. Yes. That will be useful.”
Normally, this is when Sam would turn up and save the day.
Dean stares at him, and for a moment he feels too many emotions and has too many questions. He wants to jump for joy, he wants to hug Castiel, he wants to grab him by the shoulders and shake him. He wants to say
That sounds like something dangerously close to the kind of forever happiness Dean never imagined.
Sam’s braying laughter rings out in the darkness, followed by a gruff admonition that’s from Castiel, probably to tell his gigantor brother to lower his voice. Dean rolls his eyes and heaves himself out of bed to follow, mostly to check on his brother but also because his growling stomach is insistent on finding food.
And Castiel has the audacity to sound confused, like he doesn’t understand. Like he hasn’t already got ample evidence of why Dean is a terrible human being. But hey, maybe Dean’s a better actor than he thought. That’s okay, he’s still got words. His words drove away Sam; they can drive away Castiel.
“Excuse me?”
And Dean isn’t stupid, he knows the rules, he knows soulmates cannot lie to each other no matter what and it sure makes for some awkward-as-hell first dates but – but Dean had met Castiel once and within five seconds had spilled the story about Sam, he had told Castiel about being bisexual when he still hasn’t even told Sam or Bobby, and when he had walked away it had physically hurt with each step, like a part of him was being left behind.
,” Castiel hisses, eyes going blue-white hot with power.
“I understand.”
“Uh, thanks,” Dean mumbles.
Dean looks up. “I don’t have a ring,” he repeats, “but I’ll get you one. It’s only fair. One eternal token for another and all that.”
Cas, who he almost lost.
Warmth curls in Dean’s belly, settling in amongst the hot waffles and fresh pie and salty fries. Sure, Castiel has never expressed unhappiness with following Dean around and insists he likes it better than Heaven, but there’s a big difference in hearing Castiel say it and seeing him actually, visibly enjoying himself.
Dean edges away, eyeing the window. They’re on the second floor, but it’s not that big of a gap. Dean can probably make it. “I, uh, you know it was a one night kind of thing right?” he laughs nervously. “I don’t really – I don’t do long term stuff. You know.”
“Cas would’ve protected me, if you were a threat,” Dean points out.
“Kinky,” Dean says. “But I’m not really into – ” And the words die in his mouth because, oh right, he can’t lie to his soulmate.
“Why, have you forgotten how to exorcise demons?”
Castiel lifts one shoulder and drops it in an awkward shrug. “I healed you,” he explains. “A phoenix’s flames heal us, when we are mortally wounded; they can also be used to heal others, if we choose to. You would have developed bruises from when I pinned you to the floor. Now you will not.” He frowns suddenly. “Also, you won’t be able to get out of those handcuffs. They’re spelled.”
“I’m a high school dropout!”
“No!” Dean blurts out. “No, it doesn’t.”
Castiel’s wings brush against Dean’s skin, sliding up and then down like he just shrugged his shoulders. Or maybe sighed, because Dean can feel the air from Castiel’s exhale. Either way, Castiel takes his hand off of Dean’s waist and does something.
“Rock paper scissors?” Dean offers.
“Cool,” Dean says, and crams more tater tots in his mouth.
Which is when Castiel pulls a very familiar-looking laminated badge from his trench coat pocket. Except for the bit where his is actually official.
He’s not sure what direction he picks or why, but he just concentrates on putting one foot in front of the other. It’s what he did in purgatory, and if the Shadow speaks the truth and a portal will eventually form to spit him out, the closer he gets to the veil at the end of the Empty, the faster the portal will manifest.
“And I’m to trust your word?”
He clears his throat and tries again. “Cas.”
“Hey,” Dean says, after a long while. “Does that mean you’re moving in with me?”
“Oh, Dean,” the Shadow says, “I know bravado is your style, but that won’t work on me. Do you even know what I am?”
Dean rolls his eyes. It takes a lot more effort than he expects, given the demon’s psychic hold on him. “Well, how about you just happen to take a nosedive on Castiel’s blade and we’ll call it even?” he says.
“I guess we’re both kinda dumb when we’re apart,” Dean says finally, when he finds his voice again.
Dean scowls and tucks the extra flashlight into his pocket. “Then why’d you let me add all this stuff if you weren’t gonna use it?”
Finally, though, everything has been neatly shoved back into Dean’s bag. Dean slings it over his shoulder and offers Castiel a polite smile. “So, uh, nice meeting you?” he says.
So tonight, like most nights, Dean slides under the sheets and Castiel slips a wing over him, sheltering him from head to toe, radiating warmth like a heater.
Lucifer
“Oh, that’s right, how did I forget,” the demon says, mockingly sad. “Oh wait, I didn’t. I’ve done my homework, angel. If you were to leave that vessel, it’d be free real estate. And seeing as I’ve got your soulmate at my mercy, I’m thinking you’ll do it.”
“Heaven’s resources should always be utilized to thwart Hell’s plans,” Castiel answers. “And Sam is important to me. He is family now, as you are. I would defend him myself, but I will not leave you.”
It’s the most words Dean has ever heard Castiel say at one time.
“I can tell when humans are lying to me,” Castiel replies in an absent tone of voice, and oh good, he isn’t ignoring Dean completely. “You only told me the truth. It seemed very strange, since you seemed like the type to lie. And then I found myself telling you about Lucifer and then I knew.”
The kiss he gives Dean is gentle, though, and it speaks volumes. So Dean leans up, wraps his arms around his soulmate, and kisses Castiel back, knowing Castiel will understand the truth he wants to say.
Fortunately, this makes Sam turn around and stop looking at Jess with a gooey face.
Jess, as she introduces herself to Castiel, keeps up politely cheery conversation with them as they walk inside. It’s a tiny apartment, and since the living room is basically a size too small for two people let alone three, Dean waves the box he’s carrying and sets off for the kitchen to look for a place to set it down. And to snoop.
He’s happily filling his mouth with them when Sam stretches and yawns very conspicuously, like he’s trying to let a predator know he’s there so he won’t get pounced on.
“I agree with Jess,” Castiel pipes up.
Sam blinks. He lowers his arms and comes into the kitchen. “Wow,” he says. “I never thought I’d see the day that you let someone else watch your back. Besides like. You know. Me or dad.”
“So . . . you can teleport.”
“That was rude,” Castiel tells him, frowning slightly.
Castiel, who is currently so close to the ripped-open chest cavity that he’s basically nose deep inside it, does not stand up. He instead closes his eyes, tilts his head, and inhales even more deeply, and wow, Dean does not want to know what he’s picking up.
“I will restore the room to rights when we leave,” Castiel promises.
“Did the talk with Sam and Jess go all right?”
Sometime in the middle of the night, Castiel must have finally given up in his quest to stare at Dean. The curtains, which Dean definitely closed after he brushed his teeth, are now flung wide open and are letting in the morning sun. The two chairs that were in front of the window have been neatly piled by the desk Castiel was sitting on during their argument over whether or not to leave the light on because
But Dean left Castiel behind once. He won’t be doing it again.
He’s just about to start drying stuff when his feather bracelet grows warm on his arm. Dean knows exactly what that means, so he smiles and leans back, just in time for Castiel to appear in a rustling of feathers. Castiel slips his wings and arms around Dean, grumbling quietly to himself, and presses close until they’re touching from chest to toes.
Dean swallows hard. He doesn’t exactly want to die here in a broken down barn at a demon’s hand, but he also does not want to think about a demon walking around in Castiel’s vessel. For one thing, it’s Castiel’s. For another, he can’t imagine the kind of wreckage a demon could do in a specially-made angelic vessel.
“Let’s try this again,” the demon says. “Put away your blade, seraph.”
That’s okay. Castiel can fix it.
“Not as hot as you,” Dean teases, tracing a finger over the feather bracelet on his arm. Castiel bent it into a circle for him, in order to make it easier for Dean to keep on his person. Usually he keeps it hidden under his clothes, but he never takes it off. It’s not like he can damage it, after all, and he prefers to keep it close by, visible proof of Castiel for whenever he has doubts.
“Uh . . . Okay?”
“And the reason for the tax accountant get-up is . . . ?”
“Right before the Empty came for you, you said that knowing me changed you, that it made you care,” Dean says, because he knows every single word Castiel said, because they are seared into his mind and pressed into his soul. “You said. You said that you loved me. And I think – I know that there are things you need to know too.
But that’s a smile Dean can hear in Castiel’s voice, and when he tentatively winds his arms around Castiel’s chest, Castiel covers them with his free hand instantly. His wings squeeze Dean tightly, not cutting off his air but certainly making him feel like he’s wrapped up in a blanket of something much bigger than himself, something much stronger than their stupid arguments, something so scary he’s almost afraid to put a name to it.
“Good,” Castiel replies. “Now. What is the customary ritual of ending the hunt?”
“I love you,” Dean blurts out.
And now, he’s wavering on giving up everything for Dean.
The ghost rematerializes next to her grave, sneering at them. Castiel snarls at her, deep in his throat, and glows even brighter, if that were possible. His wings flare up, spreading like a peacock’s tail to make his outline even bigger.
“Your roommate was a demon,” Castiel announces dispassionately, and then he drops the burnt-out husk of the demon’s body onto the floor like a cat releasing a dead mouse. “I think it would be wise to add protections to this apartment, Sam. And I should see if there are more demons.”
Castiel looks at Dean, expectant.
Then he stands, as if he means to leave right then and now. And sure, Castiel has accumulated possessions that Dean knows he treasures, but still, that can all wait until morning. Maybe even until after breakfast, since Castiel doesn’t eat.
That sounds like a vow.
Castiel finally stops pinning Dean against the tree when Dean’s stomach lets out a loud rumble, complaining about the breakfast he didn’t eat. He doesn’t go far though, and it’s seriously annoying, because Dean almost trips over Castiel or his wings about seven times as he tries to hastily pack everything. When he finally gets annoyed enough to make Castiel stand a solid six feet away and stop poking things like some five year old child, Castiel stares at him without blinking, because apparently angels don’t need to. Weirdos.
“Have it your way, then,” Dean starts to say, but then the feeling of watched morphs into a distinct feeling of being hunted. Dean whips out the angel blade from his coat pocket, spinning to face whatever threat is charging at him, but to his shock, the blade simply melts, pouring down his arm like it’s just liquid silver and not pure angelic power manifested into a weapon. Cursing, he digs out his knife, but that melts too, dissolving into nothingness on the floor.
And then Dean smells it: that undefinable, indescribable, undeniable scent of fresh air. Sun and wind and grass. Pies and burgers and fries. Life.
So Dean tries again. “I don’t want that, Cas,” he says softly. “I don’t want that on my hands or my conscience.”
Castiel frowns and smooths a hand down his trench coat. He seems genuinely hurt by the question, which is bizarre. “I like my coat. And the Bureau has a dress code.”
Dean really wants to needle Castiel about the whole brother-named-after-the-devil thing, but he’s got bigger problems. “You can tell when
Or, rather, what used to be thin air. Now there’s a gleaming short blade clasped in his palm, with a rounded hilt and sharp edges that come to an impossibly fine point at the tip. Dean has no doubts it can cut through flesh like butter.
too close to Dean, but he’s never actually had to say it.
“What if I hurt you?”
And Dean’s never been the praying kind, but well, he doesn’t want to end up the dead kind, so he puts all his strength into keeping the damn monster off his face and thinks, hopes, prays,
It’s the best time Dean’s ever had. There are no cases they can’t solve, no places they can’t reach, no monsters they can’t kill.
“We met after Sam left for Stanford,” Castiel volunteers. “And you?”
Dean thunks his head back against the headboard. “Cas,” he whines.
The man at the door freezes and growls, “What the hell are
He finds his brother and his soulmate in the next motel room, the interconnecting door swung open to allow passage; Sam must’ve switched their room reservations to get one that connects with Castiel’s. Sam is sprawled on the bed, grinning with a half-eaten salad in front of him, and Castiel is perched neatly at the desk, a mostly devoured burger still in the foil clutched in his hands. The atmosphere is relaxed and cozy, and Dean soaks it in, feeling lighter than air, buoyed at the idea of the two parts of his family getting along.
After that, Dean moves onto the rest of their family. He covers Claire and Kaia, Jody and Donna, Garth and his kids. Charlie and Bobby and all the other hunters from the other world. With each subsequent name, the feeling of Castiel grows a little brighter, a little stronger, a little more real. Dean doesn’t dare look, but he imagines himself being followed by a tiny ball of light, growing bigger and bigger as Castiel begins to reassemble.
and he just says things like that, and it does absolutely terrible things to Dean.
“Oh. Well, you did insist that we drive. I could have flown us here in heartbeat.”
“Yeah, I’m gonna believe my soulmate over you,” Dean tells Sam. “Given that he can’t lie to me.”
Or not.
“That’s a non-starter if I’ve ever heard one,” the Shadow snorts. Then it tilts its head, so reminiscent of Castiel but somehow even more alien, because it has none of Castiel’s curiosity or confusion. Just ancient malice, looking for a new bug to tear the legs off of.
“Nah, that’s what I call my car.”
“Hey, don’t pull those puppy dog eyes on me,” Dean says. “Heaven was a wreck long before we happened to it, buddy, and you know it. And Jack said he could fix it. Plus he can probably give you your wings back. Although that is
“You kept me waiting a long time, Dean,” Castiel says severely.
“Because I just sinned? Doesn’t that mean my soul is damned to hell?”
“It would have gone faster had I returned to Heaven,” Castiel admits. “Filtering energy through a vessel takes effort. Also, although Heaven’s power is mighty, the further you are, the longer it takes to travel.”
The whole world falls silent, and the switch is so abrupt and surprising that Dean almost wants to pinch himself, but he does not take his hands off the gun, because a shaft of brilliant sunlight is falling through the hole in the parted clouds and
When Dean finishes the right wing, he smooths a hand down the entire length of it, marveling at the wingspan. He takes a small sense of pride in how the feathers are all perfectly aligned and shimmering in the sunlight now, all the loose ones carefully piled on the bed. When he pulls his hands away, Castiel stretches his wing and hums in satisfaction.
Dean gestures half-heartedly at the wings Castiel still has sprawled all over the bed. At least they look better now, vibrant and gleaming again under the sun. “Your wings. They were – I didn’t wanna – ”
“My home is here. With you.”
Dean rambles about Sam and Eileen, because he’s happy for them. They’ve turned the bunker into a new Hunter HQ, complete with a team of dedicated researchers, rotating shifts in the classroom for hunters to learn basic skills, and a fully staffed medical wing. Sam and Eileen are also disgustingly gross and in love, and if Dean walks in them one more time kissing while making breakfast, he will start throwing eggs at them.
Castiel makes a rumbling noise of displeasure. His face wrinkles against the bed and his wings lift high into the air, rotating and flexing, like he’s testing his range of motion. Then he sighs wearily and says, “No. It’s much harder to kill an angel, I assure you. And much messier; my wings would be seared into the ground, and the explosion of grace would likely have leveled the barn.”
Dean cups his hands around his mouth, takes a deep breath, and yells, “CAS!”
Castiel’s wings tense. Dean has always known they were strong, as invincible and unyielding as Castiel himself, but there’s knowing that fact in the back of his mind and there’s feeling the feathers lock up like an immovable stone blanket pinning him to the bed. Dean would probably have better luck clawing into the mattress to escape than pushing that wing off of him.
Even with his eyes squeezed shut, the light still stings.
“Hey, I saved your life,” Dean retorts, kicking at the air until Castiel lowers him an inch or two and he can feel solid ground again. “And it worked, so don’t yell at me.”
Sam smugly takes the sheaf of papers they got from the police chief, which has a bare-bones description of the three people who’ve turned up dead in the past week. They’ve already ruled out sulfur and demons, but that still leaves any of the, oh, twenty dozen other supernatural creatures who are physically or magically strong enough to tear people in half. Fortunately, the medical examiner happily agreed to let one of them come and take a look.
And then Castiel frowns and leans forward. “You missed the turn for the park, Dean.”
Suddenly, the creature yelps and goes backwards. Bright light surrounds its head, too bright, and the monster screeches and screams as it’s hauled off of Dean by something.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Welcome to the Winchester way of life, Cas. Eventful is what we do.”
“A moment,” Dean repeats. “A moment to do all of that?”
Castiel frowns at him. “He’s your brother. Of course you want him protected. And so do I. Besides, we need more information, and it is possible that the demons will try again after we leave.”
It’s not lost on him, the fact that he is mirroring Castiel’s behavior. Castiel watches him all the time and normally Dean hates it, but now he’d give anything for Castiel to sit up and stare at him with those all-seeing blue eyes again.
Dean leans forward and kisses Castiel. It’s awkward for all of two seconds before Castiel kisses back, wings fluttering in joy around them and gripping Dean so tight he’s pretty sure he’ll have a handprint shaped bruise on his shoulder.
Castiel rears back, confusion written all over his face. “This vessel cannot contain an angel and a demon,” he says. “My grace would destroy you in an instant.”
Castiel whirls on him. His wings flash into existence at his sides, shimmery and translucent, but they’re crackling with energy and agitation, little sparks running up and down. “It’s an angel trap,” Castiel snarls. “Dean, you have to run. Run, now!”
Dean swings his shovel – well, actually, Castiel’s shovel, which apparently has iron inlaid in it, because the ghost shrieks and flickers out of existence. The downside of this is, of course, that the ghostly hand that had been wrapped around his throat vanishes too, and Dean plummets back into the six foot hole he had been digging.
And then he’s gone again, leaving Dean cold and alone and –
“Well, we’re sure as hell not gonna fit on the couch, and I am not sleeping in a demon’s bedroom,” Dean says. “We can come back tomorrow. Did you ward the walls?”
Dean, who is now so close that they’re basically glued together, just grins and shrugs. “Not my fault if you let me get away with it. But dude, seriously, at least pretend to blink.”
He had thought, just for once, maybe, he’d get a lucky break. Sam had gotten his – Jack had just snapped his fingers, and Eileen had barreled out of the bunker and slammed full tilt into Sam and there had been kissing and crying and a lot of yelling. But then Jack had turned sorrowful eyes on Dean, and Dean had known there would be no such easy fix for Castiel.
The Shadow snarls, “You wouldn’t dare.”
“Because you are my soulmate, and you asked me to come,” Castiel answers simply, and his wing brushes down Dean’s face, a caress softer than any hand. “So I came.”
“I am an angel of the Lord,” Castiel reminds him. “I can fly faster than you can see, I can speak any human language, and I can kill almost any monster you will ever encounter. Healing you is but a small feat of the power at my disposal.”
“What? Cas? Do you want me to stop?”
The demon screeches, its whole face flashes orange and white, and then it slumps over, eyes burned out.
And the way Castiel says that, like it’s a stupid, impossible question –
A laugh bubbles out of Dean’s throat before he can stop it. “Okay, okay, I get the message,” he says, eagerly burying his hands in the expanse of feathers.
Unfortunately, that leaves Dean with the very fun task of knocking on the doors of everyone who was staying at the motel where the third dead body turned up. He’s really not looking forward to it.
Castiel turns out not to have been joking about the handcuff being spelled. Although Dean holds it up to the light and pries at it, he can find no seam, and although it’s thinner than a pencil, he can’t bend it at all. When he tries to jam it open using a knife, sigils light up in the metal, like a warning, and Dean gives up and stomps out of the bathroom.
Castiel blinks, as if he’d forgotten it was still there. “Oh, I meant to remove that,” he murmurs, leaning forward. He catches Dean’s hand before Dean can pull it back, fingers warmer than any human’s should be. He mutters a soft word and the handcuff splits neatly apart. Then he retreats, leaving Dean cold and confused.
“Why would I do that?”
“Are you experiencing a problem with your jaw? I can probably heal – ”
Castiel is saved.
“Dean? Are you all right?”
As the sigil dries, Dean walks back over to his bag and double checks the contents, just in case. Hunters can’t afford to be cocky and think one check is enough, after all, and it’ll be a long goddamn walk if he missed something when rooting around in the Impala’s trunk under the light of a flickering streetlamp. Fortunately, it’s all there: sharp knife, large bowl, lighter, feather, holy water.
“My angel blade.”
Well, Dean can’t argue with that. Rock salt and iron can only make ghosts retreat for so long. With a groan, Dean bites back the pain and whacks at the coffin below him. It’s cheap and brittle, the wood having buckled under years of mold and rot and water damage and, after putting his back into it, he manages to break a sizeable hole in the top. He drops his shovel and grabs the can of gasoline and pours a liberal amount everywhere, wincing as it splatters on his shoes and the dirt. That finished, he goes to hop out of the grave, fiddling with his lighter.
“Or how about you wake him up and let him come back to Earth and we never bother you again,” Dean says. “That seems way more reasonable to me. And less effort.”
Sam is here. Sam is happy to see him. Sam is hugging him.
“Uh,” Dean says, because he has no idea where to even start with that. Most people do assume that they’re soulmates, because Castiel has a habit of standing
In lieu of answering, Castiel just lifts his left wing lazily and presses it against Dean, butting it against him like a cat.
Unfortunately, it is apparently turning out to be a cloudy day, because even though Dean’s internal clock tells him the sun should be well and truly above the horizon, the daylight is muted and the air is cold.
The creature gets closer and, as Dean squints against the sunlight, he realizes that the shadow looked so weird because, firstly, the creature has two wings that are moving, slow and graceful like an eagle, and secondly, the wings are supporting a humanoid sort of figure. Which, again, nothing Dean has ever seen, but hey, at least it gives him a nice central mass to aim for.
Dean shakes his head. “I’m definitely not.”
The Shadow turns back to Dean. “Now, then,” it says, obnoxiously pleasant, “I have some ground rules.”
And hey, if there’s one thing Dean can ramble about, it’s food.
“Your soul is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. It is far too righteous for hell,” Castiel says earnestly.
That ancient malice intensifies. “Speaking of walking . . . How the hell did you even get in here?” it demands, prowling around him. Each step is military precise, the exact same distance, the exact same movement, perfect and inhuman, like it watched a documentary and copied it. Even Castiel didn’t walk like that, not even when he was brand new to his vessel.
Each word is like a little dagger into Dean’s heart. But Dean learned a long time ago to operate under pain, so he breathes it in and says the next thing. “I don’t know why I got so angry. I just do, sometimes. When things go wrong, it just comes out and I can’t – I can’t stop it. No matter how much I want to. I just lash out and say stupid things, mean things at anyone who’s nearby and I can’t – ”
He hefts his bag higher and stomps towards his room, muttering under his breath.
“This feather will not die, or wither, or vanish,” Castiel explains. “I shed it willingly while I still lived, and so it will stay until I perish. If you ever have cause to doubt me, then look to this, and know that as I still live, I will return to you.”
Dean leans close, batting away one of the Shadow’s flailing limbs. “Give Cas back,” he says, “or not only will I come back until I wake every single being here, I will tackle you until you can’t even remember what sleep feels like.”
Dean’s jacket moves, like a whiff of wind had tugged on it.
For that, he’s treated to another patented Castiel eye roll. “My true form is, yes, but if you saw that your eyes would burn out of your skull.”
“No, this was a, uh. Surprise.” Castiel inclines his head at the gift in Dean’s hands. “We wanted to congratulate him on a successful first semester.”
, you could have
Sam knows a serious threat when he hears one, so he snaps Dean a mocking salute and gets out of the car. And yeah, Dean isn’t exactly raring to go stare at some gory corpses, but sometimes questioning civilians is way, way worse. At least most of the police officers leave them alone when they go digging in files. But sitting here moping won’t accomplish anything, so Dean puts the car into gear and heads back to the motel. Even if he doesn’t find out anything, at least there will be burgers tonight and that’s enough to put any man in a good mood.
“Being really, really strong will not help you kill a werewolf, dude.”
“I’m sure you know what happens when a human looks at an angel’s true form,” the Shadow interrupts casually. “If you look at your boyfriend before he’s on earth in a vessel, you’ll be a melted puddle of atoms on the ground. And, you know, Castiel will be stuck here, awake forever, with only your sad little pile of atoms for company. So, no pressure.”
Dean swallows hard. Castiel’s damn wing still keeps his head from moving, but he lets his gaze go out of focus. He stares at Castiel’s ear rather than his eye, anything but his all-too-knowing eyes. It’s one thing to know something about yourself; it’s another for an angel of the goddamn Lord to call you out on it. And if Castiel can look deep enough into his soul to figure it out, well, then he can probably see exactly why Dean doesn’t deserve a soulmate.
Sam, predictably, laughs so hard about the situation that Castiel has to hastily shove a chair in his direction before the gigantic moron falls to the floor. He laughs for several more minutes while Castiel closes the door, locks it, and then goes to perch at the chair in the desk, completely at ease with the entire situation. It’s kind of hot, but mostly annoying, because Dean is still in handcuffs.
Castiel says, “You set that timer for how long I had been gone.”
“Yep. And you are?”
Castiel, as always, remains the unique outlier. “I’m sorry too,” he says, voice gentle and soft. “I didn’t mean to brush off your concerns. I just. You are very important to me, Dean. I would give anything for you not to feel pain again.”
After Castiel and Sam stop vibrating, maybe.
“You are my soulmate, and I am yours,” Castiel tells him, eyes locked onto Dean’s. “I will never hurt you. Ever.”
Castiel’s frown deepens, and he opens his mouth, as if to argue, but then his shoulders slump and he sighs deeply. “I always forget,” he murmurs, almost to himself. “Humans are very prone to taking the initiative.”
Dean shrugs casually. “Oh, you know. Bit of blood, bit of magic, bit of celestial energy. No biggie.”
The first thing Dean sees when he lands on earth is the ceiling of the bunker, because he lands hard on his back.
Dean yanks his hands away. “Uh, pretty sure I shouldn’t be – ”
He strikes a match and lets it fly, shouting one last time: “I, Dean Winchester, summon my soulmate before this circle!”
Castiel backs away, a smug little smile on his face, and Dean realizes that the wrist Castiel flicked now has the other cuff on it. If he squints, he can just make out the faintest, glittering thread that connects them, like a magical rope or chain.
Dean grins. “Thanks, Cas,” he says, and manfully doesn’t point out that Dean wouldn’t have shouted if Castiel hadn’t just left.
And most unfortunate of all, Castiel says, “Is it customary to greet your soulmate by shooting them?”
Or someone.
It is not, in fact, a werewolf. Dean finds this out when he manages to con their way into the morgue to get a look at some of the bodies. Fortunately, Castiel’s dead-eyed-stare and professional dress – although Dean had had to fix his tie, and why in god’s name Castiel can recite any known language but not correctly knot his own tie defies explanation – had done wonders to get them past any close scrutiny of their fake badges.
It starts to say something in a language Dean doesn’t know, but then it
“Hmm.”
And Brady throws his head back and a cloud of black smoke comes screaming out, streaking towards the window, probably to find some other poor schmuck to possess. Sam and Dean both yell, but it doesn’t matter, because in the blink of an eye, Castiel is just
Which is how Dean finds out that they are hunting long-lost twin-sibling ghosts, who were separated at birth and found each other only to die tragically in an accident because their parents couldn’t get along and who are now murdering anyone who happens to disturb their old house. Sam figured out there might be more than one ghost while poking around at the morgue, Castiel figured out that the two ghosts might be related using his enormous FBI database of resources, and now they have a date with the cemetery to burn the bodies.
Perhaps he takes Dean’s silence as disagreement, for Castiel’s face goes stormy and sullen. He sits up with a huff, lifting his wing off of Dean, and moves to the edge of the bed. But his voice is softer when he speaks again, no longer the righteous angel of the Lord, just tired and sad. “Please have a little faith in me, Dean. I have placed so much in you.”
“No portal,” the Shadow agrees tiredly. “For a while, anyways. His grace shields you.”
, as if they were never there.
Dean shoots him again. This time, he aims for the head.
Then again, Dean hasn’t lived this long relying on just his imagination and feelings. That’s how he ends up betrayed or stabbed.
do not come into!”
“The ground rules are for
It’s what Dean expected to hear. It’s still a blow.
“Cas,” Dean whines.
There’s no answer. His words don’t echo. But the feeling of a thousand eyes shifts somewhat; Dean can still feel that edge of malice, which is probably the Shadow, but he can also feel . . . something else. He has no words to describe it, but it’s there and a part of him knows it, recognizes it, delights in it. It’s like getting a whiff of fresh outside air in a deep, dark, winding cave; he can’t say what makes it special, but his body knows it is.
That is not what Dean had expected Castiel to say. “What?”
“Dean,” Castiel says, patient as always. “What’s wrong?”
“How’d you know I was – ”
“They look really awesome, Cas,” Dean interrupts, rolling his eyes. “I know your wings are warm. Angels run hot, huh?”
“You are a hunter.”
“No! But like. Usually you’d never let me out of your sight.”
“How can someone not like waffles?” Dean mutters, shaking his head. He pushes his half-eaten burger to the side – well, more like towards Castiel, because the table is getting kind of full – and digs into the waffles himself. They’re best hot, after all, and he can always zap the burger in a microwave on the road.
Which is when Castiel unhinges his jaw like some kind of snake and takes a humongous bite of burger. It’s like Sam but even worse, because Castiel doesn’t need to breathe and can’t choke, so he just happily inhales half a burger without the slightest pause. He must chew with angel speed too, because it’s only a few seconds before he does that weird jaw thing again and halves the burger with another bite.
“Yes, Dean?”
because this isn’t like a blanket corner or a stray dust ball; this movement is purposeful and alive, and Dean’s eyes are shooting open because his brain is finally kicking in and –
“Feather got warm.”
“Essential piece of – Cas! You nearly gave those demons a free meatsuit!”
Castiel leans forward and clamps a hand on his shoulder, tight and unbreakable, and the world goes very dark for a moment, colors spinning into nothingness at his feet, the very air growing still against his body, like he’s been hurtled through space and time.
Too late, Dean realizes that he’s said too much. Castiel still sucks at sarcasm and pop culture references, but math and logic? Castiel knows the very fabric of the universe; he can solve a problem like nobody’s business. It’s what made him the kind of tactician that Heaven would send down to Hell to rescue the righteous man.
He rattles them at Castiel, hoping to get them removed, but instead he just sets Sam off again.
After three hours, the adrenaline crash really hits Dean hard. He finds himself starting to nod off in his chair, and the fifth time he nearly hits the floor he gives up and relocates. He has no desire to accidentally hurt Castiel by jostling his wings, so Dean bunches up his jacket into a nice pillow and sits on the floor next to the bed. It’s an awkward angle, but he’s definitely slept in worse positions, and this gives him the optimum position to immediately see if Castiel’s eyes open.
“I’m still not sure how,” Castiel says. “You have many scars. And you have terrible eating habits. I assume our Father must have really wanted us to meet, otherwise you would have likely come to Heaven instead of me coming to earth.”
Castiel looks at him – really looks at him, from the bottom of his feet to the very top of his head, one long slow drag, impossibly slow for how fast Dean’s seen him move. It’s unbearably intimate, it’s torturously thorough, and it’s
It is a feather. And not one of the loose, unhealthy ones that Dean plucked out. This one is vibrant and beautiful, gleaming from the top to the bottom, green as vibrant as an emerald, purple as deep as an amethyst. When he shifts his hand a little bit, specks of color dance across the space between them, like stars glinting in the darkness of their own little universe, cocooned with Castiel’s wings.
Dean stops. “Cas. Was that you? I swear to god if you’ve had the ability to do that this whole time and haven’t talked to me – ”
Castiel doesn’t say anything back – nothing stupid about Heaven being his home or wanting to strike out from the bunker or even going to check on Claire and the rest – and that is when it dawns upon Dean that perhaps this is the perfect time to have their little chat. He’s not sure how Castiel will respond, after all, and what better place than somewhere like the Empty where no one, not even Jack, can eavesdrop?
“I guess at least we aren’t caked in filth and blood this time,” Dean muses. “I had to shower so much, even the second time. Hey, maybe you can angel mojo us both clean this time. I’ve got stuff to say to you.”
Dean sets off again towards the portal. He can see it now, a glowing, rippling circle of light in the distance, throwing off blue and gold sparks. It looks about the size of his arm, but that could just be because it’s too far away or it’s not at full size yet.
Castiel’s wings shiver, a little movement that starts at the center of Castiel’s back and ripples outward towards the ends, sending a cascade of purple and green lights flashing across the room. It’s only when the movement reaches the end and the wingtips flick that Dean realizes Castiel is actually slightly amused, like he wanted to laugh but didn’t know how to manipulate shoulders and so used his wings to approximate how a human would.
He is alone.
“Cas,” he says. “Cas! Don’t you dare.”
Castiel’s hand shoots out. He grabs Dean’s shoulder and
Dean bolts for the window –
And it’s also really freaking pretty. Dean has lost countless hours tracing the shimmering purples and greens.
“Well, it’s not much, but I’ll take it,” Dean says. “Now I just need to make sure I have silver bullets."
The words are like sparks on dry wood; Dean is leaping forward before he even registers the movement. “What did you do to him?” he snarls.
“No. Nor should they be. I will need to report to my superiors so that they are aware.”
So Dean jumps into the portal and prays, and the words in his mind are all for Castiel.
The Shadow laughs. The sound echoes, which is weird, because when Dean had arrived and yelled out for Castiel, his voice hadn’t carried at all, like the darkness had absorbed everything. Now, though, the laughter reverberates all around them, like a dozen church bells going off right next to his ear, harsh and grating and loud.
Dean tilts his head up. “I’m not giving up!” he yells.
Castiel squeezes his shoulder tight, so tight it almost burns. Dean welcomes that pain, the reminder of Castiel’s angelic strength, his unyielding nature, his single-minded determination.
And of course Dean knows that Castiel can’t lie to him, but it’s different, somehow, hearing Castiel say words that clearly pain him, seeing Castiel fidget and look down, watching how his shoulders shrink and he hunches in on himself. He obviously thinks that Dean is going to do a runner, pack his things and vanish into the night like he did all those years ago.
It’s a thrill, to say the word
He was listening to Dean pray.
“Wait, really? I thought only your blade could do that.”
The Shadow yawns and slumps further into its throne. “Yes, you will. Human souls don’t belong here; your kind goes to Heaven or Hell. Eventually, a tiny little portal will open and you’ll be sucked through it like dust up a vacuum cleaner. One of God’s little loopholes, to make sure every realm functions perfectly.”
Castiel tilts his head. “Your words . . . Do you mean to stay with me, then?”
“Yes. That’s why I won’t be going back to Heaven.”
Even more unfortunately, Castiel’s giant fricking wings move, so fast they blur in Dean’s eyesight, and, between one blink and the next, Dean finds himself slammed against the nearest tree, those big wings caging him in, his hands pinned by his sides, and Castiel’s face inches from his own. His eyes are blue, as searing and unnatural as the greens and purples of his wings, and Dean kind of feels like they’re peering into the depths of his very soul.
Castiel relaxes his hand and the blade vanishes. The demon opens his fist, and Dean wheezes as air streams into his lungs again.
This time, though, the ghost is just suddenly
“Well, you kinda sucked at finding me.”
The Shadow rolls its eyes. A throne oozes into existence and one of the doppelgängers hops into it, sprawling sideways, as the rest shift to form a sort of honor guard around it.
The last time it twinged was when Castiel shoved him to the cold, hard floor. It’s not a happy memory.
Castiel cups his face with one hand. The other finds Dean’s shoulder, firm and steady. It’s good, it’s right, it’s grounding and it’s what Dean needs, because it means Castiel isn’t leaving.
“And?” Dean prompt, when it becomes clear that Castiel is not going to actually answer him.
What Dean means to say is a fairly well-rehearsed script: “Hi, my name is Agent Young, I have a few questions related to the incident that happened about two, three nights ago.”
The Shadow unravels, tendrils falling to the floor and dissolving, and then Dean is alone.
With each word and step, Dean gets closer to the portal. It’s grown in size now, tall and slender, just enough for an adult human man to squeeze through. Dean knows without being told that it will suck, but also that it will bring them home.
“Cas, please stop smelling the dead guy,” Dean tells him, which is a sentence he never thought he’d have to say to anyone, much less his soulmate. “Also, seriously? You got all that from a sniff?”
“I can smell your blood,” Castiel interrupts. He pokes Dean hard in the cheek and shoulder before Dean begrudgingly pulls up his ruined shirt and reveals his wound. Castiel puts his palm down, going quiet, and that super bright light starts to shine again.
Still, he wishes so much that he could just hear
Dean yelps and almost trips. “Dude! Personal space!”
When he picks himself back up, his eyes land on a horrifying sight: Castiel on his knees, face bloodied, a demon pulling on each arm and another grabbing at his wings.
“Perhaps it is a pack.”
Dean only complains a little bit. Just for show. He has to maintain his reputation, after all.
“And you’re . . . my soulmate?”
“Well, I have no interest in going to jail, so how about you – ”
Castiel rolls his eyes and rolls his shoulders like he’s working a kink out of them, and then the entire room spins dizzily around them. Dean finds himself suddenly not in his chair anymore, but flat on his back on the bed, out of breath, with Castiel perched on top of him, warm and beautiful and smug as a cat that got the canary.
“Sure thing,” Dean says, because he has no desire to wake up anything or anyone else. “Anything else?”
“Is that common knowledge? Angel traps and angel exorcisms?”
Dean musters up all his strength – the strength that carried him against Azazel and against Lucifer and against God himself – and says, “Watch me.”
Dean sighs and looks at the way he came. He marked the trees, and he could always pack everything up and go back – but go back to what? Sam’s gone, his dad’s likely going to make a break for it as soon as he wakes up, like he always does, and then Dean’ll just be staring at the wall and going out of his mind. Again. And this time, Sam won’t come back after he cools off. If there’s one person Dean knows inside and out, it’s Sam, and he’s never seen Sam so angry. He knows Sam meant it, when he said he’d leave, and he also knows that John bellowing that he shouldn’t come back would only cement Sam’s determination.
Yep, the deep voice wasn’t a hallucination either. “Morning,” Dean replies. “You, uh, felt the need to redecorate last night?”
Castiel is standing there, face set in that focused expression, eyes narrowed and jaw clenched, but there’s none of the softness that accompanies his focus when he looks at Dean. Now he looks truly the part of the avenging warrior, wings spread wide and high, one arm locked tight around the monster’s neck and his free hand pressed to the monster’s skull.
For a long moment, he almost thinks Castiel will ignore him, and bile rises in his mouth because if Castiel leaves can he ever come back? Even if he can, will he? Everyone leaves and it is not surprising, but for the first time, it’s not fine, Dean doesn’t want Castiel to go, he wants to see Castiel inhaling burgers, he wants to admire Castiel sunning himself, he wants to feel Castiel’s warmth when they lean against each other to watch movies. He wants all of Castiel and more.
“Come back safe,” Dean says on automatic.
Castiel looks at him for a long, long moment. He can practically see Castiel thinking, although he can’t tell what, but, either way, after a few minutes Castiel nods to himself and steps forward. Dean’s not sure what, exactly, he is expecting, but he is
“Left one?”
Dean sighs. “Come on, man, work with me. I didn’t really tell Jack you needed a body, and I don’t feel like being blinded. I mean, I guess Jack could fix that, but I don’t fancy the pain.”
Still, the column stabilizes after a moment, so Dean dutifully scoots closer and squints, trying to make out a face or some kind of landmark in the flames. Usually, if people are lucky and everything goes perfectly, they get a glimpse of their soulmate’s face. If they’re not so lucky, they might get an image of a place their soulmate’s been, or an impression of their voice, or something far less helpful.
Then the last part of Castiel’s words register. Dean swallows hard. “So, I’m not special, huh?”
“Please do not. It was unpleasant.”
He’s too afraid to leave and get food, so he crams a granola bar into his mouth and washes it down with water from the bathroom sink. He takes the fastest five minute shower he’s ever taken, just to get the demon stink off of him, but Castiel is still passed out and unmoving on the bed when he returns. He paces around the room, lining the walls with salt and carving a devil’s trap into the bottom of the bathmat which he places at the room door.
