"Stop, Clint." Sam was surprised to hear Wanda's voice. "Steve, I am going to get us all some drinks, would you help me?"
"Hey there Winter, Patriot." She smiled. "Pick up the packages with minimal damage?"
Over the next few days Steve only left Tony’s side to shower, leaving Nat or James to sit with him. The children visited everyday and brought cards and other gifts with them. Dianne brought Steve lunch everyday with extra cups of the orange jello he liked. Peter and Shuri would come and talk about different ideas they had for Tony to experiment with them on when he woke up. Most of it Steve couldn’t follow, but he appreciated their enthusiasm none the less. Usually there were a few of their friends in the room with Steve at any given time, but there were moments where he had time to himself with Tony. He spent a lot of that time just talking to the unconscious man, telling him about Wakanda, life growing up, and other distractions. Sam brought him his sketchbook on the third day and he distracted himself with that, speaking out loud as he drew.
The King stood and shook his hand firmly. “Captain Rogers, it is good to see you again.” Steve tried to push away the feeling of jealousy at how Tony had greeted T’Challa. He was better than petty jealousy. “Likewise, Sir, I’m glad you’re here.” Steve got the feeling that T’Challa knew his thoughts though, since the King was looking at him with that gaze that always made Steve feel like he knew more than he was letting on.
Making a decision, he stood and exited his lab, riding the elevator up to the shared level before he could change his mind. As he walked into the kitchen he passed James lounging on the couch. He held his finger to his lips as he walked into the kitchen area and leaned against the counter, watching Sam with a smile.
?” His rank was nearly a sneer out of her pretty mouth. Wow. She was nearly as good as Tony at this game. He knew when to back off. “Of course, Miss Potts.” He said in surrender.
“O-Oh. I had no idea.” He stuttered. Pepper’s smile was positively predatory. “Well as of right now you wont be in attendance, so you shouldn’t need to worry about it, should you,
Steve looked around at the floor. It already looked clean to him, but he wasn’t going to say that.
"My oh my, so this is how you were able to get all those men stuck in your web, huh Widow?" Natasha smiled and bat her eyelashes at him in a practiced motion that he knew must have had men usually falling all over themselves.
"It's nice to see you all again." He tried for nonchalant as he addressed Natasha, Vision, and Bruce."
"Now, on advice of my doctor, I am going to the penthouse to lie down. The rest of the compound is yours, have at it kiddos."
After landing, she slipped a supportive arm around him as they slowly made their way from the ship to the door of the building.
"Is our friendly neighborhood Wakandan following us?"
FRIDAY interrupted his thoughts.
The team had taken the QuinJet, which Tony had made several modifications to, and arrived on the scene in Chicago in less than 20 minutes.
"There are still people in there!" Peter shouted back.
“Naatttt…” Clint whined.
She only nodded as they made their way up to the living floors.
Turning around to face Ross again Tony put his hands out to the sides as a barrier between the soldiers and Wanda. He looked past the guards at Ross and stood tall, squaring his shoulders and lifting his chin, eyes flashing. “Not only did I read the Accords, I
Ross growled before his words were cut off by the sound of something slamming on the roof of the car. “Did that sound like a super soldier to you?” Tony asked. Gunshots ran through the air as the guards shot at a motorcycle that pulled up along side the car. “You do that and you’ll just make her mad!” Tony called to the guards currently shooting at Black Widow. One by one the SUVs were taken out by the Superheroes as the high speed chase continued through the streets. A stray bullet went through the back of the driver’s head, causing the car to suddenly careen out of control. The rear wheels caught on wreckage and the footage cut in and out as the car flipped and rolled multiple times before finally sliding to a stop under an overpass.
The people Tony had allowed to seeing footage of Siberia was one thing. To have the others not only see it but see it in the simulation room was another level that he was sure must be hurting Tony greatly, although he was being careful to hide it under his bluster and façade.
The camera crew watched as Tony’s car pulled up to the venue for the press conference. It was being held outside, regardless of the rain, though a huge canopy had been set up over the podium at the top of the riser. Umbrellas and raincoats were everywhere, everyone set on staying for the conference.
“Tony!” Laura exclaimed. “You know I hate when you do that, you’ll squish the bread!”
So the Rogue Avengers were pardoned, and T'Challa was flying home with five copies of the newly approved accords, the final product of all of the work he and Tony and put in over the months. Tony had joked that it was their baby, and he could not have been more proud to have fathered it with him. T'Challa could do nothing more than laugh as Laura had thrown one of Nathaniel's stuffed animals at Tony's face.
T'Challa couldn't help himself when he sat down next to Tony and allowed himself to join in the laughter, both men wiping the tears from their eyes.
And what could Steve say to that? How could he possibly deny him?
Later, after Steve had given up trying to kill Sam with his feather down pillow, they had ventured out into the kitchen again, and found it abandoned.
"No, Barton, I am saying that you didn't think to reach out to those you were less familiar with."
After the doors closed, it was Steve and Tony alone. Tony turned in the direction Steve was standing. "He may not know it yet, but I know how sharp your hearing is, Captain."
“When we were in Wakanda, Sam said Steve never let that stupid flip phone outta his sight. He lived for the chance that you might call. He knew you didn’t need him, cause you’re Tony Stark, and you don’t need anyone to take care of you, but he drove himself crazy with the hope that you might call cause you
"Don't even try to start with that bullshit, Stark. I think you know exactly why I am here. I've been trying to get through to you for over a week!"
Bucky's first few days at the Compound were filled with silence, other than the few times FRIDAY has addressed him, and waiting for Stark to show up. The only floor he was allowed on was the floor that housed Tony's lab, which had been extended by knocking out some walls and setting up new safety protocols throughout the entire Compound.
Peter had to try and remind himself that he still wasn’t 100% on board with liking Steve, even though Tony had told him that he should try and get to know the man underneath the Captain America costume. It wasn’t that he didn’t like the guy, he just wasn’t sure he knew how to reconcile the man who was smiling at him now from the man that he knew kept Tony up at night in his nightmares.
“There isn’t even any posturing. There’s nothing artificial in the confidence that Tony Stark holds, not here. Here in this corporate world, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts rule with absolute power. Between the two of them they bring the competition to their knees.”
"He looks so happy. I never thought I'd see him that happy again." Steve told him, as he moved towards a chair to sit down as well.
The hospital staff knew how to handle difficult situations, but James was sure they didn’t expect all of the Avengers, a Wakandan Princess, along with the Barton and Lang children to burst through the front doors and cause as much commotion as they did. Steve hardly waited at the reception desk to hear which room Tony was in before he took off down the indicated hall with the nurse shouting after him. The rest of the group gave her apologetic looks and shouts as they followed the direction of the blonde super soldier.
Tony leaned forward and whispered something in the reporter's ear that had her blushing and giggling before he turned and winked at the camera and started back up the stairs towards his party.
Shuri had mentioned she and her mother wanted to watch the live coverage of the Stark Charity Gala happening tonight in New York City, hoping to catch glimpses of all of the famous attendees, her brother and King among them. Steve had insisted that she do it with them, as they had nothing better to do and wanted to be kept informed.
He and Tony were just too different, always butting heads. The world didn't need that, they deserved a real team. And truthfully, Tony wouldn't be able to stand next to Rogers in the field, of that he was fairly sure. He wouldn't trust him, he couldn't follow him, and that would probably end up getting someone hurt or killed. Tony wouldn't be responsible for that.
Steve felt anger and heat he'd almost never felt before rise inside of him. This wasn't fair, this wasn't right, Tony would see through this man, wouldn't he? Tony was smarter than this.
Shuri had almost gleefully told Bucky all about it.
"Penny for your thoughts?" She whispered into the darkness, barely loud enough to hear over the sound of the rain pounding on the windows.
Sam nodded, staring into space as his brain worked. James glanced at him with a smile and then did a double take, his smile faltering and eyebrows knitting together at the look on Sam’s face.
For a moment, everyone froze as they began talking. They all looked at each other, not sure if they should turn off the feed and give the men their privacy or not. It was Peter who finally voiced the question, “Shouldn’t we- well I mean, I’m not sure that we should-” but FRIDAY’s soft voice filled the room as she said,
"And what about you, Tony, what do you have?" T'Challa asked.
Tony could only again give a nod, nearly imperceptible.
“What are we going to do?” Natasha’s whispered question went unanswered in the silence of the room. No one had any answers.
Seeing Tony’s bright smile, his face flushed, and his tank riding up his hips while his sweats rode low, Steve hurriedly excused himself from the room to go refill his water bottle before things got embarrassing for him. With a last glance backwards Steve saw James looking at him with a knowing smirk.
Sam stopped short as realization settled on him. “Are they butterscotch?”
quickly, trying his best not to think of Tony, ultimately failing, coming hard whispering Tony's name like a prayer.
Coming VERY soon: Science Squad! Amazing Shuri! Tony and Steve's first confrontation since they arrived. I'm very excited about these, I hope you are too!
“Do something!” Wanda shouted to Vision. The man shook his head, “I cannot. Tony made sure his lab was secured with the upgrades. I cannot pass through the walls.” His voice was tight. Natasha turned towards Bruce who looked lost for a moment, considering what additional damage turning into the Hulk might cause. “The children upstairs…” He said weakly.
"In fact, it would. I had a few hours to kill so I used it to calm down and think things over afterwards and I think that you have a point. We can discuss it more tonight, if you are free?"
Sam smiled at him hopefully and nodded before saying breathlessly, "Yes, I would appreciate that very much. Thank you, sir. If the chance comes up, maybe… maybe you could tell Stark the same thing?"
Drinking and partying, reckless behavior and avoidance that ultimately led to pain and crushing guilt. She saw unfamiliar faces of young Terrans before they were suddenly killed, followed by confusion before seeing a bomb that read
"Yes, the plan. I am so sorry I had to keep you all out of the loop but now that it's rolling I can tell you. The only way that we get the old team back is if Ross and the others think it was their idea. The Accords need to be amended legally for them to come back safely, but it can't look as if it is for happening for them. We need to make all the mistakes so that they amend them as they should. I've already lined up a few missions that will push those items of concern to the forefront. The last hurdle is to make them think that we are bringing them back because they want them back. Ross wants to make me unhappy because I have been making his life hell. How is he going to do that? By bringing back the one thing he thinks I want to stay gone. I'm out of control, yes, so when was the last time they felt like I was under control? When I had a holier-than-thou Star Spangled bastard keeping me in line. So, they'll want to put me back in line, right? The best way to do that is get him back here, but they can't do that unless they think they can control him too. We all know that the one thing we can rely on to manipulate the good Captain; James Barnes."
“Don’t-” Tony hissed.
“Why are you so angry?” He simply asks as his fingers press down on different parts of her arm.
"You aren't babysitting, you are watching each other's backs, Patriot, and you both let your team member down." Natasha opened her mouth for a rebuttal but Tony moved on to Wanda herself.
She said, her voice urgent.
“Why do I care if you believe it?” She shot back as she spooned into more of her banana yogurt finally taking her knowing eyes off of Steve as he tried to breathe again.
Half an hour later they were back at the Compound, Tony took the elevator straight to the Penthouse and sat down on the couch as he pulled a little bit to loosen his tie. He had arranged for Maggie and Laura to take the kids out for the day right after the interview was over, knowing that there was a chance the Press Conference might go south. He wouldn’t say it had gone completely south, but it sure as hell had taken a slight turn. A few minutes later T’Challa came walking in, dry despite the steady drizzle outside.
“What are you looking for?” She spits, uncomfortable with her own feelings of confusion over his actions.
“When we moved back in, Steve found a bag of them in the drawer of his nightstand.”
“Alright, I’m going to see if I can find my wallet. It’s gotta be here somewhere. Meet me back here in 5.”
From the look on Tony’s face, Steve would guess that no, he didn’t remember in the slightest. He didn’t even bother hiding his amused smile as Tony tried to cover it up.
He had arrived to a barren wasteland. No one appeared to guide him as Clint had described Johann Schmidt had for him and Natasha. Deserted.
His AI's voice came through his earpiece,
floor. Well. Now that his embarrassment faded he thought about things. Tony had been direct and made a fairly obvious pass at him, he doubted that he read that wrong. Maybe Tony was kidding, trying to make him uncomfortable, but maybe… maybe not. Maybe Tony’s interest was genuine. Steve glanced at the floor number he was currently on. Well. If he stared heading there now he could arrive with a few minutes before Tony would be back in his office. He could beat him there and wait for him in his office.
James had backed away and was stumbling over to where Steve was slumped against the wall with Wanda. Clint was standing between them all with a hand on Scott’s shoulder, still kneeing where he had fallen to his knees earlier.
Barton opened his mouth to respond when Wanda put her hand on his arm and shook her head, communicating he should drop the subject for now. Clint looked angry, but obeyed.
"Alright hold on, before anyone says anything I think it's past these kid's bedtime, isn't that right squirts? Let's get that done and then we can all come back in here and you can plan how best to end my life together, okay?"
He could take a hint. T'Challa was allowing him to view the call, but telling him to stay out of sight of the camera.
The next few days were full of simulations and training sessions. None of them went overly well, but none of them went as catastrophically wrong as that first one. Tony avoided Steve and everything do with with him, arriving right before they began and exiting immediately once they were over.
Between the increasingly heated kisses and wandering hands, Steve managed to breathe out, “Thought I’d lost you.”  Tony nipped at his bottom lip lightly before moving down to place kisses along his jaw. “Again.” He sighed.
He hadn’t bothered to lie about the alcohol or the drug usage, it was clear that he was self medicating. What had surprised her was that he maintained the true reason he was in such a bad state was because he was trying to clean up. He had leaned forward and held her hand lightly, removing his sunglasses and telling her that he had considered Clint family. He didn’t blame Clint, although that didn’t mean what happened didn’t still hurt.
"And yet you love him. He's a good kid, Tones. I spoke to May when she came over for lunch a few days ago, she says that he's never been happier. He was under a shadow for a long time, with the passing of his parents and his uncle, but since meeting you, since becoming part of this team, he's a happy kid again."
“I don’t doubt it. You are insufferable.”
“What the hell did you just say?” She said as she took a step toward him before suddenly Tony was up and grabbing her by the wrist now, pulling her away towards him and holding her there.
Peter and Shuri crawled on hands and knees, still laughing, to the door and Peter reached up and opened it, the two of them toppling out into the hallway where everyone else stood laughing, revealing themselves, and the rest of them, as the masterminds of the whole thing.
"I had been so sure Buck…" A small noise that sounded suspiciously like a sniffle, "I never second guessed myself. I should have. I should have. Why didn't I? Now it's too late. Its broken. I did what I had to do in the moment, I honestly didn't see an other option. Even now, I know what I was thinking and I know why I did it. How can I be sorry, while still not being sorry?"
Trying to get himself under control, Tony kept wiping at his eyes and said, “This is my favorite day!”
"Don't you
He stopped in his tracks when he saw her tear-streaked cheeks. He had never seen her cry. Hell, he had hardly seen any emotions from the Black Widow that didn't end with her breaking bones. It dawned on him as he rounded the couch and sunk to his knees in front of her that this wasn't the Black Widow he was seeing; hell it was hardly even Natasha.
"Is that all you did, Cap?" Clint looked up at him from the couch where he had sat down. "Cause Stark is mad as hell."
It was early evening when Rocket came running into the hall in which they were all gathered. He was clutching a piece of tech in his paws as he told them he made contact with The Guardian’s ship.
There was a pause before the stern voice of Pepper Pott’s filled the training room. “Tony, where are you?”
The relief flooding the King's eyes was nearly laughable. It was like the man was drowning and Tony was his human life preserver.
Realization dawned on James face and he smiled softly at Sam before looking at Tony down the isle, obviously torn between the selections of cookies he was considering.
All heads turned towards T’Challa, who’s jaw was clenched and his dark eyes were narrow as he glared back at Ross. Finally, he gave a stiff nod. “That is accurate, however-” But Ross cut him off and waved his guards forward to place the cuffs on Wanda, one guard producing the collar from the Raft. She shrunk back into Visions arms, her eyes fearful.
Tony looked affronted. "No, of course not. The kids did it after I fell asleep, the little demons." He searched his desk for one of the screwdriver heads he was missing.
Tony shuffled over to the coffee maker tiredly, not paying much mind to Clint. He decided the best way to let Stark know he was there would be to continue throwing the bouncy ball at the wall.
“And then suddenly I am awake and they are telling me that I am some kind of hero and they need me to fight. I had just woken up Tony. I woke up to find out that everyone I cared about was gone, long dead, but for me it was like it was yesterday. Can’t you understand that loss? Even a little bit? I was thrown into a world that called me a hero when I didn’t deserve it, but they said it like it was a hard truth and I couldn’t argue. I dealt with all of this grief quietly, visiting Peggy in the hospital, trying to find a way to dissuade the guilt. And then suddenly, Bucky was back and he was in trouble, but this time, I could save him. This time, I could catch him before he fell again. I had to Tony, I had to do it. I couldn’t fail him a second time.”
His bottom lip was split open, some dried blood still clinging to it as it stretched. His was holding his wrapped sprained wrist to his chest somewhat protectively over the ribs that they had heard were bruised badly. His breath was shallow, but Steve honestly didn't know if that was from physical pain or from the sight of seeing them all standing in the living area of their floor. Tony's warm brown eyes looked dim as they landed on each of the others, resolutely avoiding landing on Steve.
Steve felt hurt, but not at all surprised. Truthfully, he knew that the words would rub Tony wrong as soon as they left his mouth. Still, he had hoped for once that things might not continue to deteriorate and blow up in his face. His eyebrows drew together as he said, "Tony, I'm trying to-"
A resounding slap echoed through the feed as Ross backhanded Tony across the face. “I may not have gotten who I came for, but that doesn’t mean I can’t take pleasure in second place.” Ross spat. Tony chuckled as he licked the blood from his lip. “I should have realized you had a hard on for me Ross, since you’ve been so focused on my ‘whoring’.” Ross’ face contorted in rage and he motioned to the guard on Tony’s right. The guard brought the end of his rifle down hard into Tony’s stomach, making him double over in pain.
“Please, tell us what happened on Titan?”
He heard the door to the lab hiss open and from his upside down vantage point he watched Tony walk into the lab. The man looked beyond exhausted.
Shakily raising her communicator, she quickly speaks harshly into it to send the message, “Compromised. Leave.” to Stark back at the ship before turning back to the fight at hand and attempting to raise herself back up on a shaky right arm.
"No, Tony, it doesn't. It seems like the public version of you." This time it was Vision who spoke up.
"You wandered away from your teammates, would you care to explain to them why?" He said, sweeping his arm out in a gesture of invitation.
T’Challa stood behind them, rolling his eyes at Tony but smiling proudly at someone recognizing his sister’s brilliance so publicly. Tony turned around and with a flippant wave of his wrist in his direction said, “And that’s the King, he’s got a cool Cat-Suit, but that’s about it.” Steve thought for a moment that Tony was being incredibly rude, but he watched T’Challa break out into a smile and heard his low chuckle at Tony’s words. Tony gave T’Challa a huge wink and smirk at that.
Leave me a comment and let me know what you think so far!
Steve heard Laura call his name from the kitchen with the King as she beckoned him over. He gave one last glance at the stairwell door Sam, James, and Natasha had just disappeared through before heading in her direction.
"Peter?"
What could he say, now faced with the Wakandan who knew too much, and yet did not set fire to Tony’s life even further by telling anyone? Just as he was trying to scramble for something close to a response, the King spoke again.
If Tony was being truthful, the kindness from the King meant the world to him. Tony would have expected that with everything the King had seen and heard, he would have found the man beneath the armor more trouble that he was worth. There were very few people in his life these days who willingly spent time with him, let alone praise his friendship or honor. It was almost unsettling. He simply didn’t know how to respond.
Tony turned to look at everyone gathered around him. “Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow, The Soldier, Vision, Hulk.”
Tony felt like he had been slapped. He glanced away from T’Challa’s eyes that obviously saw too much, knew too much, though how he wasn’t sure. He again fought the large lump in his throat. “Not for myself.” It came out as barely more than a whisper.
“My problem? Since when are you and Stark having sex on the couch?” Tony and Natasha’s eyes both go wide as their jaws drop.
She narrowed her eyes and countered, "Is that what you are going to call a stairwell quickie? There are cameras all over the place Tony, there is no way you make it in there without them seeing and connecting the dots. You weren't exactly subtle earlier."
They released each others hands and for a moment Tony felt like he could breathe, like he could do this. The feeling was short lived however, when St-Rogers decided to open his mouth.
The press conference had gone well; Tony had stood tall and composed as he delivered the forgiving words that Ross had demanded of him, his eyes again hidden by the dark glasses he refused to remove. The press and public ate it up voraciously.
Finally, after an awkward moment where Steve called Tony a pet name and Peter’s face had gone so red T’Challa worried he had stopped breathing, Tony had called out to FRIDAY to take the restrictions off. Instantly, most of them shot up out of their seats and took either the elevator or the stairs back down to the communal floor. There was a brief moment of awkwardness as they all entered the floor, but Tony quickly swept it away as he asked that, “Someone, please, for the love of God, get this shit off of our hands.”
Tony’s hand stopped the door closing as he leaned out once more and fixed T’Challa with a pointed look. “Try to enjoy yourself up here for a while huh? Don’t look so sad, I still love you, I just can’t resist the mind of your brilliant sister. I’ve got a lab full of things that need her attention, the first one being my notebook full of questions.” He winked at the King as the doors closed for the last time.
"Clint, don't let anger or jealously blind you. Those kids love their Uncle Tony, so if you want your family back, don't try and take them. Try joining them. Whether you," She turned to everyone in the room, "any of you, think so or not, Tony Stark is a hero and he's done a lot for you."
Distantly, she heard Tony’s voice starting to cut through the cloudiness in her mind. His hand on her back rubbing soothing circles.
“The memo, oh yes, the memo. Definitely got it. Because I do read your memos, Pep.”
Shuri had thrown her arms around his neck with a laugh and told him, "I will miss your lovesick pouting face, 'Merica. Give your man a sloppy kiss for me, yes?" At the mortified look on Steve's face she only laughed harder, taking his hand he felt her push something into his palm.
"Damn, Natasha, that wasn't a very nice welcome."
Bucky had only rolled his eyes and given Steve a one armed hug, holding him for a bit before pulling back and saying, "Stevie, please, I haven't had a choice in so long, please let me have this one."
"This panic attack, if it has to do with Siberia, my presence may make it worse."
"Yeah, right now, he's just behind that door." Peter shot up out of his seat and handed his phone to Pepper as he all but ran through the hospital room door. Pepper was left standing in the hallway. With a smile on her face, Pepper Pott's familiar features came into focus on the QuinJet screen. Once the kid was through the door her smile fell a bit.
Steve paid no mind though and continued, “And even if I hadn’t been, I see it every time I close my eyes! On top of that, we all saw the memory play out in perfect detail today thanks to your simulation.”
“I have to tell you the truth, Tony. I can’t keep that to myself. I love you.” He pulled back the covers so that Tony could slide in next to him, trying to keep the fear from his face as Tony stood there. Tony hesitated only briefly before sliding under the covers as well and asking FRIDAY to turn off the lights. Steve gathered him into his arms and held him tightly but carefully, mindful of his still healing injuries. Tony turned into the hug and buried his face in Steve’s chest, wrapping his own arms solidly around Steve as well, breathing deeply.
.” Tony groaned.
Apparently, it didn’t take much to get Ross riled up, because he raised his voice as he shouted, “No your reckless actions forced us into this.” Tony rolled his eyes again. “My reckless actions? Did you forget I signed your precious accords? I signed them first, and then you used me as your attack dog to try and make the rest of them sign.”
She laughed lightly before saying, "I'll keep you updated. We are getting ready to receive your cargo here. Check in later." Her waving image flashed on the screen for a second more before vanishing.
Steve had come to realize over his time in Wakanda, his biggest fear was that of the unknown future. If there was one person who embodied unknowable and future, it was Tony Stark.
"Have I ever told you how perfectly you fit in my life, Happy?"
Clint had listened to Laura relive the last year of their lives, first on the down low with bodyguards paid for by Tony Stark. She recounted a miserable life, one with a lot of fear and constant moving around. Then, one day a few months in, Tony Stark himself had shown up on the doorstep of the safe house they were currently hiding in. He had lost too much weight his eyes were a bit sunken. They sat together and he told her what had really happened with the Accords and Siberia.
“Alright, alright, hold on, back you savage children!” Tony exclaimed as he held the candy bars above his head out of their reach. “I am nothing, if not a business man. So, impress Mr. Stark and sell to me. Why should I give you such delectable treats, hmm? And you’ll need confirmation this time, not like last time when you got treats after giving your mothers a heart attack disappearing from the store!” His eyes sparkled with mischief.
Steve shook his head, "I tried to stop him, but he just kept coming. Every time we put him down he stood back up."
On the eighth day, he was sitting alone in the room when he thought he heard the beeping on the machine next to him change slightly. He sat up and studied Tony’s face hard for a few minutes but nothing else happened. Over the next few hours he thought it happened a few more times, but Tony never woke or moved. When it was late and Steve’s eyes were heavy he did the same thing he had done every night since the first day. He checked Tony was tucked in snugly with his arms above the covers, smoothed his soft hair back, kissed the bruised inside of his wrist on his pulse point, whispered that he loved him, and laid his head down on the mattress next to his hand.
“You had options. You were never alone. You just didn’t bother to look around yourself.” He felt Steve’s eyes burning into him as Tony spoke. “You once said you watched the footage of me fighting and that I only fought for myself. Well, I watched your footage too, and god knows I heard the stories. Do you know the theme I noticed in each one? You didn’t rely on others, you relied on yourself. You worked with a team, sure, but you weren’t really part of it, you just led it. So the few times something went wrong you put the blame on yourself, not the team. Each time you changed your mind you didn’t inform the team, you just changed direction and gave everyone whiplash.” Tony finally turned to Steve, bouncing Nate on his hip. It was surprisingly easy to stay calm and collected as he held the little boy in his arms.
"How is Tones, Pep? Is he really alright?"
T’Challa sat down and pulled out his phone, dialing a number and holding it to his ear as he answered. “You heard what was said at the press conference. As your guardian, Tony signed his name on the line next to each and every one of you.” Steve cut in, “I thought that was just if we did something wrong. They don’t have solid proof that Wanda did anything, and we all know she didn’t, there’s no way she left the Compound.”
"I look great? Well sweetheart, I am completely flattered, though not entirely surprised. I should hope that I look good since I have to impress beautiful people like yourself. What's your name, gorgeous?"
"I didn't think I'd ever hear you call me 'Captain' again." Steve said tentatively smiling. When Tony didn't answer, he added, "I also never thought I'd hold the shield again."
“Why not get one from inside?” Sam asked him.
The transmission cut out and silence reigned in the QuinJet. Steve couldn't take the silence anymore.
T'Challa's heart broke a bit for the man sitting in front of him. He gave him a genuine smile and said, "I hope you will get the chance to do just that. Until then, I go to New York tonight, for a UN Meeting and the Stark Charity Gala in the next few days. I will pass along the sentiment, if I am able to do so without giving away your location."
2. His life with the Barton and Lang kids have softened him a little bit. Especially Peter. Wanda isn't much older than Peter. Tony can see how the wrong choices and life's unfair twists and turns may make someone make certain choices.
"I would encourage you to speak to Steve again. You made a choice and you followed your Captain. That responsibility falls on your shoulders. Clarification should have been asked for by you before you made any choices."
“Fri, tell me that there are still some of us left?”
James opened him mouth to answer but Tony beat him to it, rolling his eyes as he said, “James insists that if you take one from outside, it’s one less that the employee has to retrieve later. He’s a true gentleman like that.”
Tony released a breath and it came out as a small sob. Seeing Tony so broken, his kind eyes so unsure, made James feel a protectiveness he hadn't felt in years. It was like having Stevie back in front of him before the serum. Shifting closer, James enveloped Tony in a gentle but firm hug.
She was absolutely loath to admit it, but she was in no condition to fight. Physically and even emotionally, she was unsteady, Titan had taken its toll on her as well as her companion back on the ship. She shouldn’t have risked leaving the ship at all. ‘
Tony stood and gathered all of the kids around him as he ushered them down the hallway toward what T'Challa assumed must have been their bedrooms. As they passed him, Tony leaned in and whispered, "If you thought I was above using these kids as a human shield right now, you are wrong. And before you blame me, look at the daggers being glared into my back right now."
. The voice in his head whispered knowingly.
Yay for Stony!! :D
“To save you, asshole. Everything I did, I did in because I thought I could save you all from the nightmare that I could not get out of my head no matter how much booze I bathed in, how many joints or cigarettes I chain-smoked. I can literally hear you in my head every time I close my fucking eyes.
“Mr. Stark, do you trust Captain Rogers?” Tony’s mask didn’t slip an inch. “Of course I do, he’s Captain America.” He replied breezily. “But didn’t he betray you?” Someone called out. He waved aside.
He had watched the fugitives he housed in his own kingdom for the last months begin to feel the consequences of the actions both sides had taken. It had not been pretty.
Clint's glare turned on Tony but Laura cut him off quickly, "You don't have to, baby. Lets all go, come on, take your sister back upstairs, please. I told you that you could see Tony and Peter and we have. Let's go." Nathaniel began to cry at being led away from Tony.
He had a mission though, and his actions were means to an end. They didn't have to mean anything he told himself over and over. When he finally got out of this place he would make sure to talk to her and help her understand why he did it, but first he needed to find the King of Wakanda.
Tony slid into the car and collapsed into the leather seats.
Wanda would often sit in the open communal area of the housing T'Challa had provided them. A large while chair with various soft pillows had become her favorite place to sit, overlooking the great Wakandan plains. She would sit for hours, staring blankly.
He thought.
“Tony?” She asked. “Yes?” Tony hesitated. “Stop. Just make sure you’re here at 3.” Tony nodded with a smile and said, “You got it, Potts.”
Tony didn’t have to guess who T’Challa was referring to. Silence had been one of the first requirements he had given the King when they started their journey. None of the exiled Avengers could know that Tony had a hand in anything being done. If they did, they probably wouldn’t trust the outcome. T’Challa reluctantly agreed to Tony’s stipulation, though he had many times expressed his unhappiness with the situation. So they had kept it a secret, meeting when the King was in New York, video and phone chats when he was back in Wakanda.
Tony couldn't help snapping. Hearing St-Rogers speak like Tony owed him anything was too much. "The whole story? I don't think so. You don't pick and choose when you get to know the whole story."
T’Challa’s voice was quiet, but no less strong when he leaned forward slightly and said, “I do believe that we can do some good here, Mr. Stark. Is that not what we have always endeavored for? I know the rumors about you. The rumors you let be passed around. Though I do wonder why you never bother to correct them, I do not wonder if every action you take, every life you save, every piece of Stark technology you create, is not your own way of proving to yourself that the rumors are lies.”
“So…?” His voice sounds confused as he gingerly turns her arm over in his fingers.
“You’ve taken care of my family when I wasn’t there to do it. I know that my choices made it happen, and it doesn’t really matter if they were for the right or wrong reasons. The point is that I made those choices and it meant that I left my family in danger. You made my family your family, even when I gave you no reason to think of me as family. I said terrible things, in a situation I didn’t understand but thought I did. I can’t stress how sorry I am for that. You’ve made a family here again, even when yours was taken from you, more than once.” Tony flinched minutely at that. “I…I would…I want to be a part of your family again, Tony. But this time I want to be a family member towards you, too. I want to earn it and deserve it. I know trust like that takes a while to build, even under the best circumstances, which we aren’t in, so I understand if you-”
Steve smiled at the sight before turning to resume heading to the middle of the room.
Bucky laughed again and piped in "If Tony takes him out for ice cream and doesn't bring me back any mint chip, I'm going to make sure he can't find any spoons in the Compound for a month."
Steve and the rest of the team who had to stay behind gathered together in the communal area where Shuri and Peter quickly set up something like a command center. They had speakers patched in to the team’s comms and visual of the scene from the vantage of each team member’s, thanks to the camera’s implemented in each member’s outfit.
“Injuries.” He murmurs quietly as he gently places a large hand on her chin and turns her head to the side to take in a deep cut and bruise on her cheek. She jerks her head out of his grasp and pulls her head back to eye him warily.
The room was dark, windows blacked out, and James let his eyes adjust for a moment and strained his ears to pick up any noises. After surveying the room his eyes found Tony sitting on the floor of the bathroom, his knees drawn to his chest, elbows on this knees, his hands threaded through his hair clutching his head as he struggled to breathe.
He stood there barefoot, his hair mussed from sleep, shirtless, sweat pants riding dangerously low on his tanned hips. Steve felt his mouth go dry at the sight, until his eyes wandered to the Arc Reactor in the middle of his chest. The Arc Reactor itself was fine, but his eyes were drawn to the angry red scar that formed an upside down half crescent. The realization of what made that mark hit him squarely in the gut, nearly knocking the air right out of him.
T’Challa greeted him first. “No costume tonight, Spider-Man?” He said with a smile. Peter was about to open his mouth and go into what Steve was sure would have been a Tony-worthy babbling rant, but Shuri stepped in first. “Peter! I brought that
He doesn’t seem to take any offence or be put off by her actions, his gaze instead zeroing in on her non-functional left arm as his soft voice replies, “And if I had, you might be dead or-”
Steve was positively shaking with rage at this point. Only Tony’s hand in his and remembering that he had promised Tony that he would be invisible kept him from snapping this pathetic little man in front of them.
"No I don't mean Nat, knucklehead, although she might be up there too." James let a tentative smile slowly spread on his face. "Tony, are you saying I'm allowed to follow you upstairs?"
"You reek of alcohol, Stark. Get a hold of yourself."
Again he shook his head and his lips twisted into a humorless smile before continuing, "I don't think he realized what this whole thing would actually do. Every other time something has happened we have been able to get by with minimal deep loss. We fight and forgive, eventually moving forward. Not this time. We lost family this time around, although no one realized that until it was too late. Tony… Tony meant a lot to all of us, he and Steve together, they were like our dysfunctional parents who constantly bickered, but always came back together in the end."
After he started to put his shattered pieces back together he had apologized and started to keep in regular contact with Peter, though he was careful. If Peter called while he was in a bad way he had FRIDAY make up an excuse and, after he had pulled himself together, he would return the call immediately. Peter was one of the very few people he still felt the need to put a show on for, because the kid was simply
“How often have you two done the domestic grocery shopping?” Sam asked James teasingly.
He felt her hand rest on his shoulder for a moment before she spoke again. “I have worked here for a long long time; I know the look of relief that shows on a person’s face when they realize they haven’t lost their chance to admit their feelings to the one they love. I can even guess whether or not the one who is hurt loves that person in return.” Steve’s tears continued to fall as she spoke. “Of course, it’s always a little easier to tell when the one who is hurt repeatedly asks for the other person while they are half conscious.” She added with an amusement. “Even if I didn’t watch the news, I would have known you were ‘Steve’.” She gave his shoulder a last gentle pat before he heard her footsteps retreat to the door and close it behind her.
He had thought about offering to install something upstairs for her until it occurred to him that he already had. Many of them. That way Ste-Rogers could watch the History Channel and other shit while Clint, Sam, and Thor played on the TV Console. For some reason she was choosing to spend her time with him while he swore at his robots and tinkered on all of his tech. He supposed it might be to keep an eye on how much he drank while he was down there.
From his tone and posture it was obvious Tony was waiting for Steve to push back and insist that he let them join in. Steve had changed though, and Peter’s words echoed in his mind.
The King considered his answer for a moment before answering carefully, "No, Agent Barton, I did not. I would much rather you had stayed in New York with the rest of the Avengers and been the team you were all meant to be. However, we cannot change the past. Now we move forward, and we strive to be better than we once were."
“You didn’t even bother to use your brain. I’m assuming you do have a brain, don’t you? The only other Terran I’ve met was Quill and I was really hoping that he was an exception, not the rule.” Even as she said it, the words twisted wrongly inside of her chest. Quill was gone and even though she hadn’t exactly liked him, he had meant something. Gamora had found something worth loving in him.
At that, James, Bruce, Vision, and Natasha shared a worried glance and sprang up towards the elevator. Steve stood too, noticing that Scott, Wanda, Sam and Clint were right there as well. No one stopped them as they all gathered in the elevator, obviously they were all too focused on getting to Tony to consider that the other’s shouldn’t be with them. It made Steve even more worried that FRIDAY didn’t try to enforce their restricted floor rules either. Something must have been drastically wrong.
“You could have saved us.” He choked out before going still, eyes staring upwards at the darkness. A voice carried through the cold air, asking, “Why didn’t you do more?”
As Steve passed Tony he was able to pull himself together enough to throw Tony a small shy smile before his eyes found the floor again. He was nearly out the door when Tony’s hand shot out to grab his bicep. The grip was strong but gentle and there wasn’t any force behind it.
"Parker, education is important, that's one thing I actually took fairly seriously. You're gonna have to just stick it out." Tony huffed, "Okay, listen up Spiderling, the best I can do is this; tell your teacher that you were up late working on a Stark Industries internship project. I'll have FRI send something out to confirm it."
“Wow, Stark, I never knew you were so
The team shifted into defensive stances immediately and looked around at each other before Steve yelled for them to calm down and raised both of his hands to shoulder height. The others followed suit and soon they all stood in the middle of their living area with their hands raised in surrender as they were surrounded by the soldiers.
"You got it, man."
Steve turned to stare at Wanda. “Its-I didn’t-I never meant-” She scrambled for words.
The group approached closer and with every step Steve felt like his legs would give out. Behind him, heard someone’s knees hit the ground. A glance confirmed that it was Scott, his eyes wide and terrified. Steve continued to walk forward with James and the others. His stomach wrenched as his eyes glided, one by one, over the dead or dying bodies of the Avengers.
“Maybe I should go for the Barton and Lang families.” Ross whispered. Tony’s head snapped up at that. “Yes, I know you’ve been playing house with them. Very foolish of you. Haven’t you learned that anyone you consider family ends up dead? Those innocent children, you wont be around to protect them anymore.”
Around 10:00 pm the elevator doors had slid open and the sound of voices flooded the quiet Penthouse.
He huffed in response and tilted his head back without responding. Growing more annoyed at his lack of response and seeming lack of care that he had made his injuries worse by risking so much instead of just leaving like she had asked, she pushed again.
Tony thought.
After a beat, she narrows her eyes at him slightly and nods once, releasing him from her stare.
"Him." Tony corrected quietly. "You wont let him down."
“Tony, please. Normally I would appreciate what you’re doing, and I would take the easy way out of this that you are offering, but right now I need you to look in my eyes and know that I mean every single word.” He hesitated and slowly raised an open palm up to Tony’s shoulder, slow enough that Tony could stop him if he needed or wanted. Tony eyed the hand and tensed but didn’t step away or stop him. “You are my family, and I’m going to be there for you, like family should be.”
“It’s good to see so many people here for him.” Dianne said with a fond smile as she made some scribbles on Tony’s chart. “I remember the times when the foolish man would walk himself in and out of here alone. I’m glad he has someone to call home now.” Steve raised watery eyes to her face at that. “We-” he cleared his throat and shook his head, “He doesn’t come home to me.”
T'Challa smiled before standing and offering Sam his hand. Sam returned his smile and clasped his hand, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet.
Steve decided to run down and say hello to his friend while he had the chance.
A reporter stood in front of the camera with her microphone, adorned in a beautiful formal dress, her makeup expertly done and every hair in place as she began her broadcast.
Steve had expected a large bedroom, but the actual room was gigantic. In the corner was another open door that led to a huge bathroom. Along the length of the room was a massive window overlooking the dark grounds with a mini bar tucked away on the side. The room didn’t look particularly lived in, but it did have a nice feel and a modern look to it.
Once in the lab, Tony motioned for Nebula to sit down on one of the stools.
To his surprise, Ross wasn't alone.
“Why am I-? For you, obviously. Can you walk?” He says as he approaches and squats down next to her, his hands hovering and large eyes flitting over her form as if they were looking for something.
, Maggie had reminded him. As Scott channel surfed the elevator opened again. This time, Peter Parker came stumbling out, out of breath and sporting a gigantic smile, clutching his backpack to his chest. The excitement was rolling off of the kid in waves as he came nearly running to the counter and fished in his backpack for a paper.
"You'll be allowed home. With provisions, as always. But once you sign the Accords, you're past is pardoned and you will be welcomed back into the United States. Clint, Scott, your family will be waiting for you, however you will be required to live at the Avengers Compound, under guardian supervision for a set amount of time. After it is determined that you will comply with the accords and you have proven yourself, those restrictions will be lifted. Your families have already been made aware that you have been pardoned."
She nodded, "Yeah, yeah they said he's alright. Already telling them he wants to go home." Bucky snorted at that. "And the kid?"
"And just how do you plan on helping without your gear. Wilson, do you want your wings back or not?"
With much effort, Steve tilted his chin upwards and opened his watery eyes to stare up into Tony’s soft brown ones. “There they are.” Tony’s lips lifted into a soft smile. “God, look at those beautiful eyes. I live for those, you know.” Tears continued to pour out of his eyes and onto the bed sheet covering Tony’s chest. “Been so scared.” He choked out as he clutched the sheets at Tony’s sides. Tony’s hand in his hair moved down to cup his upturned jaw and stroke his thumb over his cheek lovingly. “Can’t leave you just yet, Steve. Love you too damn much.” He whispered.
James couldn’t help but laugh at the floored look on Steve’s face as Tony put a baby in the blonde’s arms without a second thought. Steve held the baby like he wasn’t sure what he should do with it. Steve made a move as if to hand off the baby to James, but he held up his hands and backed away. Tony’s voice came from he and Peter’s hug saying, “Don’t you put that kid down, Rogers.”
"Yeah, we've got them all here, it went off without a hitch."
They spent the next hour going over the BARF technology, how it worked, why it worked, what they hoped to achieve with it, and most importantly, why it would help James Buchanan Barnes.
Steve opened his moth to retort but James stepped in hastily, “Alright, Stevie, we are all exhausted, can we just go to bed now?” Steve threw one last look at Tony, who was now scrubbing his hand in the sink next to T’Challa and Rhodes. He sighed heavily, said goodnight, and got up to follow James down the hallway to their rooms. Once in the hall, James suddenly stopped and pushed Steve flat against the wall. Surprised, Steve opened his mouth to say something but James put a hand over his mouth. “Stevie, I need you to watch something, okay? Watch T’Challa,
T'Challa steeled himself. "Yes, there are provisions that the Council has set and they are resolute. The first is that you are to live and operate under strict supervision until it is determined whether the treatment is working."
. Its about betrayal from the one person I thought I could count on.”
Tony’s voice continued on the screen. “Knowing we had been called out on a mission you were counting on the Compound being half empty. My absence especially important, to prevent this very situation. Let me guess, you were hoping either A.) They’d let you take Wanda under the permission of the Accords, or B.) They’d put up a fight and re-brand themselves all as criminals. You didn’t plan on us coming back so soon, making a compound full of Avengers. Boy, I sure am glad I keep tabs on people I don’t trust, it gave us enough time to make it back just after you arrived.”
"While I am sure that would be amusing for some, I doubt you'll see much of Mr. Stark."
Steve’s throat closed on him as he listened to Peter. He wanted to say something but remembered the lesson his books and meetings with Dr. Field repeated often; listen with the intent to understand, not to reply. So he waited, and let Peter continue.
There are constant calls and requests for a comment from what seems like nearly every news station in the world. Reporters and paparazzi have taken to camping out outside of the Compound gates, hoping to catch a glimpse of anything that they can twist and sell to the public.
Sam was left dumbfounded in the kitchen as the doors closed behind them. He stood there for a second more before taking off down the hallway to his own room to change. He was going grocery shopping. He was going grocery shopping with Iron Man and The Winter Soldier. He was glad no one was there to see the gigantic goofy smile he was sure was currently stretched across his face as he tried to find his other shoe.
Tony let out a sound that was somewhere between an ironic chuckle and a scoff. "Rogers- "
"NO STEVE. No. Do not apologize. It's not a secret that I don't lose any sleep over Tony Stark. But, I know that you do, and you have even before this whole thing began. Stop pretending everything is alright. It's not, so tell me what you want to do about it?"
"I'm getting way too old for this; you guys know that right? One day when I can't stand and you all have to feed and dress me, you'll remember this moment."
“Welcome, Captain. Does your presence bring good tidings for your task?”
“What about other vigilantes and so called superheroes who are operating unchecked on the streets?” Tony lifted an eyebrow, “What about them?”
Tony turned his head in the direction of Steve’s voice, but didn’t open his eyes. Steve released the breath he had been holding and carefully leaned forward to slide his hand over Tony’s open palm and intertwine their fingers while he said, “Tony, it’s Steve, I’m right here. I’m right here.”
Tony didn’t have a chance to answer before Ross said “Surely you saw all the reporters waiting at the gate? They’re here to get a glimpse of the criminal Witch in handcuffs.”
"We had disagreements, that doesn't mean we don't care about the people we left behind." He had explained to them. Sam raised an eyebrow at Steve, unimpressed with his flimsy excuse. Sam knew that Steve was always monitoring for news on Tony, and now that there was a party being held by the man himself, complete with cameras and live footage, there was no way Cap was going to miss it.
, he didn't need to know Tony had done anything for any of them, it didn't matter.
Next to Steve, James seemed calm, his eyes appraising the situation, but his taut body language gave him away. The situation was deteriorating out of their hands, quickly.
“He’s right here.” Tony called as he came walking down the hallway with Nate babbling in his arms.
Tony thought back to months ago when T’Challa had approached him after yet another UN hearing dealing with the aftereffects of what the media had dubbed “Civil War”. Things had been at an all time low.
Bucky's laughter bubbled up out of him as he fought vainly to maintain his mask of innocence.
"Just tired. We had a late night last night and I woke up with sharpie all over my face, let me tell you how much of a bitch that was to scrub off, I took off the top 3 layers of my skin at least."
"If you've seen that video, I would damn well hope that your brain works better than to honestly think shit like that. That monster
Steve tried to contain his frustration and anger. He was distracted when the screen came to life, filtering in footage. The picture focus was clear and the voices unmistakable. Ross was seated across from Tony; who’s glance was on the guns of the soldiers next to him before his gaze snapped back to Ross when he spoke. “Well, well. It seems that your little team is closer than we were all led to believe.” He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. “You
Also, I LOVE the comments and kudos, please keep them coming!!
“You didn’t deserve it.” Peter pressed.
Even a short moment was too long for Tony though, who cleared his throat and with a smile told Bucky, "Then move your ass outta my chair Barnes."
"You know, even Captain America needs to eat, punk."
He let his arm fall across T'Challa's shoulders as he turned toward the old woman holding him hostage.
“Did you learn something today, Captain?” Tony whispered, his voice a
The rest of them were left standing there in silence for a moment when the elevator doors opened again and Tony stuck his head out. “Science Squad is missing a member. Where is he? Lang, get your ass in here!” He called. Scott looked dumbfounded. “Me?” he said pointing to himself. Everyone looked between Scott and Tony. Tony gave Scott a distinctly unimpressed look. “We both know that you have considerable knowledge in the tech world, Lang, don’t try that innocent princess crap on me. This elevator has places to be so...” His eyebrows rose at Scott as he jerked his head towards the elevator. Scott looked so shocked he couldn’t move. Tony rolled his eyes. “Lang, if you aren’t in this elevator in 3 seconds, I’m sicking Peter and Shuri on you.” The mentioned teenager’s heads popped up over each of Tony’s shoulders. Scott obviously didn’t need anymore pressing and he hopped up and jogged himself over to the elevator. ‘Science Squad’ cheered as their last member joined the ranks.
Tony eyed him for a moment longer before he released Steve from his piercing brown gaze and turned his attention back to Cassie.
Tony turned and put a hand on his shoulder. “I know you’re pissed, I get it. I’m sorry I didn’t fill you in on how this would go down. I’m going to go shower, then I’m going to try not to stab my eyes out with a pen as I suffer through a meeting with the SI Board, and then I’ll be back and you can beat your frustration out in the simulation, alright?”
. They both knew what she meant when she said that. Rogers had told them time and again that together was the only way they would succeed. He nodded and took a deep breath before looking down at her again.
"Did Rhodey or Pepper put you up to this? No. It doesn't, at least not for long enough. But it helps me forget for a while."
About 2 hours into the flight, they were all startled by the ring of the comms. Bucky pressed the button to answer the call and the video image of Natasha Romanoff popped up on the large screen.
Tony was quiet for a second before he finally said, “…Well, hindsight is 20/20, isn’t it? You recovered just fine.” Steve’s voice was hoarse as he squeezed Tony’s hand in his and said, “I don’t think I ever recovered.”
Steve dropped his hand back to his side, disappointed. With a last squeeze to each others arms, Steve and Bucky released each other and Steve turned to go back toward the seats, claiming the one in between Sam and Scott and beginning to strap himself in.
“Your powers are incredible Wanda, but you must know that you
"I'm proud of you Tony, I hope you know that. We just have to get through tonight."
things. He could feel different textures and temperature in his fingers. No one would know it wasn't real flesh. For the first time in a long time, James Barnes pictured himself walking around crowds of people and no one staring at him or his arm. He would be just like anyone else.
.” Bruce was holding his stomach, laughing so hard it was causing him pain. Scott echoed his sentiment, holding his abs and repeating “It hurts!” over and over again. On the floor, Peter and Shuri were an absolute mess of hysterics.
“I love him.” He whispered. “I love him more than anything in the world. I’d die for him in a heartbeat. If Tony was in trouble and I had to choose between him and saving a city, I’d let the city burn, even though he would hate me for it. At least I’d know he was alive to hate me.” Everyone in the room was silent at his admission. Rhodes sat quietly and observed him, but Steve paid no attention and continued, “I thought I loved Peggy, and I did in a way, but not like I love him. I’ve never loved anyone or anything like I love him. If she was a raindrop, Tony is a thunderstorm. I don’t know what happened and I can’t give you or him any good excuse why I didn’t see it before.”
He was so afraid for Bucky, remembering the look in Tony's eyes in the bunker in Siberia. Why would Tony even agree to something like this? Why would he ever agree to be Bucky's guardian when he made it clear he didn't think Bucky could be trusted. If Bucky was out of control, and Tony had made it clear he had thought he was, why would Tony agree to take responsibility for what he thought was inevitable?
A few moments later Tony was regaining his senses and realizing what had happened. Shaking, he stood up and glared at everyone around him.
. He wanted to get lost in those eyes again. Those eyes that had so earnestly been seeking his forgiveness for months. What if Tony didn’t ever get to tell him that he forgave him, that he actually loved him? That would kill Steve, he knew it. Steve would hold on to that pain and regret, he would beat himself up about it forever. He was so tired, but he had fought hard enough to get here, what harm would come from fighting for just a little longer? If he got to see those eyes again, it would be worth it.
“Amended Sokovian Accords Section 141 Sub-Clause A-D: Contingent upon his signature, Captain Steven Grant Rogers has been pardoned by the UN and its Affiliates under the terms of the Accords. Possible future damages and responsibility demanded for actions deemed as a breach of agreements set within these Accords shall be attributed to the signed, as well as the co-signed party, who shall pledge consequences under the same.”
Tony dropped the packet of papers in the middle of the table and took the seat opposite Bucky, leaning over and placing one of the coffee cups in front of Bucky as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
Tony raised a hand before cutting him off, "I'm going to have to stop you right there. First, it's Tony, I'm not Howard, and you are literally living in my lab like a hamster. Second, this isn't a selfless act, alright? Helping you helps the people that I care about. I'll admit you are one tough son of a bitch, so let's call it a draw and leave the past where it belongs, huh?"
“Yeah baby, it looks worse than it is.” Clint called back to her. Cooper said nothing, but watched his father with mild concern.
He knew that was wrong though, when he caught Clint’s eye. As he sat down next to him Clint quietly asked, “Everything okay, Cap?” Steve nodded and gave him a tight smile. “Quite a kid, huh?” Steve relaxed slightly and gave Clint a soft smile. “That he is.”
Just as Maggie opened her mouth to say something else the bell to the elevator signaled another arrival to the floor and opened to reveal a seething Pepper Potts, still in her dress from the Gala. She stepped off the elevator and made a beeline for Tony at the same time that a door opened and Natasha and Bruce came walking back into the room.
Laura Barton and Maggie Lang were trying to contain Cooper, Lila, Cassie from running full speed at Tony.
“Nat made sure all I have is apple juice, but the good news is that it is organic.” Tony quipped sarcastically as he retrieved a carton out of the mini-fridge and set two glasses on the bar, his back to Steve. While he did so, Steve walked up behind him slowly and deliberately, making noise so that Tony knew where he was and his intention to approach. He came up behind Tony and put one hand on the counter on each side of the man. Tony stood boxed between Steve’s arms, but didn’t react as he unscrewed the lid and quietly said, “Say when.”
Tony knew Ross wouldn't be stupid. Each "mistake" was carefully calculated. The last "mistake" had been designed to show the issue with response and approval time the Accords had previously set. Tony made sure that there weren't civilian casualties, but the damage to the city and structures had been more than significant. The UN Counsel decided that a change was needed so that the next time something came up, Tony and his team would have a way to respond without needing the vote of the entire Counsel. Instead, he would only need approval from one of any of the top three Chair Members. No calling a meeting, no holding a vote, and yet still some regulation.
James broke out into a huge smile which Tony returned as they embraced in a hug until Tony winced and James broke it off quickly. He jumped up from his chair and opened the blinds, rapping on the window to get the attention of the occupants in the waiting room, waving his arms and shouting, “Each of you assholes owe me a hundred bucks, I got through to one of them!” As he pointed to Tony, who let his head fall into his hands with a groan. James turned away from the window and said, “Don’t worry, Stevie ain’t out there right now. Probably went to clean out the snacks from one of those machines somewhere. You’ll be able to shower him with your own cutesy version of this on your own time.” He said with a wink.
Steve glanced up from his spot on the floor for a second before going back to staring out at the rain. “Hey. Yeah, just thinkin’.” James took a deep calming breath.
Tony nodded and waved his other hand, “Fine, Steve, fine. Just tired.” He answered as he closed his eyes. Steve slowly raised a hand and placed it on Tony’s arm in what he hoped conveyed some sense of comfort. He was very aware of not wanting to cause Tony any distress or overstep any boundaries. “I’m not made of glass, Steve.” Tony said, eyes still closed.
Tony’s mouth was hanging open, his eyes wide. If this hadn’t been such a serious moment, Steve might have laughed at the billionaire, genius, playboy, philanthropist, suddenly rendered speechless. Instead, “Tony Stark with nothing to say?” He teased lightly.
"Yeah. Peter. You've already met him. Sometimes he likes to put on spandex and run around shooting webs at Super Soldiers."
He had told her about Ultron and the disaster that had caused and he had told her about the disagreement between the other Avengers that had resulted in them being split when the attack for the Time Stone began.
He smiled kindly in response and tried to discreetly check the cushion as he lowered himself into a chair next to the couch. Pepper, Natasha, and Bruce sat on the longest couch, leaving an open space which was suddenly occupied by Vision, though T'Challa didn't know just when the AI had come into the room.
Steve whipped around and asked, “Who are they FRIDAY?”
Happy checked his mirrors again before answering, "Indeed he is, sir. Keeping a bit of distance but he will be right behind us."
Scott answered him with a huge grin, “Sorry Cap, it’s way too late for that. Consider yourself an accomplice.”
The next hour was spent in anxious silence. If Steve thought he was fidgety and nervous before, it was nothing compared to the anxiety sweeping through his veins now.
With a quick kiss to her cheek and final meaningful look he slid past her and out into the stairwell where the other man was waiting. She felt sick. He knew the camera was watching, he knew what it looked like, and he even admitted to the physical act he was about to preform as if it were nothing. He didn't seem to want to go, yet he went with his head held high anyways with an almost sacrificial attitude. What the hell was happening?
“I-I don’t…” Steve stumbled.
James uncrossed his arms and came over to sit next to Steve on the bed. “I’ve been reading a lot, and more importantly, I’ve been seeing someone. Bruce thought maybe it would be a good idea to have someone who actually knows what they are doing come and talk to me. It’s been really helpful, Steve. I know Tony has gone a few times too.”
Natasha rolled her eyes at Bucky's reproach. "Don't act like such a hardass Barnes, you know Tony made the right call to empty it out room by room. Remember the kitten he found under the table?"
Finally, it becomes clear that even in their despair, they need to figure things out. They need to understand if they can. The sudden appearance of a man who introduced himself as Wong starts them on that path. They all gather in the old throne room, the air heavy. Thor and Bruce tell their part of the tale to their gathered audience, Thor continuing from the point that Bruce was sent back to Earth. Natasha and Steve do their best to fill in the blanks of the story with their path. Bruce fills them in on falling to Earth and landing in The Sanctum, asking for Tony.
"Oh, hey Karen. Where is P-Spider-Man?"
He only looked a little bit surprised to see her. "Actually yes, I need a break for a moment."
"First step is to get The Winter Soldier back."
. But he knew this memory. He knew what happened next and no amount of his sobs or pleading would change it. He barely heard himself tell Tony that he didn’t know it was Bucky’s specifically. Tony’s voice telling him not to bullshit him and asking again, “
T'Challa stomped on this automatic reaction to tell Steve that no, Tony Stark was not okay, in fact he was far from it, he was just a much better actor than anyone gave him credit for. Instead, he changed the conversation topic.
"Going somewhere, Tony?"
Steve watched the exchange with a fond smile. Uncle Tony was absolutely endearing and quickly becoming one of his favorite parts Tony played. Cooper spoke first, “I shot 10 for 10 at the archery range yesterday. I beat everyone in my class!” Tony whistled, clearly impressed, and handed him the 3 Musketeer bar after checking out his story with Laura.
Tony’s fingers closed around his and returned some of the pressure and Steve’s teary eyes filled again as he let out a sound somewhere between and laugh and a sob when Tony’s cracked voice whispered, “Steve?”
“It is.” Tony sighs.
Bucky's small smile grew in to a full-blown grin. "You mean, after we spoke about how our dear Stevie here was always sick?" Bucky turned at held Steve's gaze the entire time he asked.
James answered him as he approached Bruce and laid a hand on his shaking shoulder. “It was BARF.”
Steve was so close; Tony hadn’t let him this close since before Siberia. “Say my name Tony, please. Just once more.” He asked, his voice a more than a little broken. Tony glanced off to the side. “I say your name all the time, Rogers.”
“My friend, connection to the ship means nothing if there is no answer in return.” Thor tried, softly. Rocket’s face twisted in sarcasm as he replied, “Good thing I got a reply then, huh pretty boy?”
"Is this the mask you will wear for the public, or is this the voice of your heart?"
He had Rhodey and Pepper, of course, but that was different. Rhodey was his best friend, and had been for as long as Tony could remember. Rhodey hadn’t deserted him, even in Afghanistan the man had been in the helicopters that had rescued him, never giving up on the idea Tony was alive and would make it through.
Nothing.
"Huh? Oh, sorry, sorry. My head, I'm kinda lost. There was just a lot of blood when FRI opened the suit. His eyes were weirdly dazed. We were just supposed to have a look; we didn't think there would be anyone there."
“I’ll try to forget this moment next time you are giving us orders in the field.” Clint said and the rest of them tried to smother their laughs and scoffs.
Thor answered with a heavy sigh and regretful eyes and answered, “No, Rabbit. It is…unlikely that they survived.”
When he was crashing the plane into the Ocean back in World War II he had known that it meant death, and he had only been slightly afraid of it. At least he knew what he was facing.
Steve closed his eyes and bowed his head, giving a tiny nod.
. He could have gotten behind that wheel and killed himself and I would have mourned him like a
"Calm down, Steve," Natasha said from her place at the bar counter, sitting noticeably away from the rest of them at the table. "Tony isn't a patient; he visits every Tuesday he is available."
“Ugh. I cannot believe I just gave you a heartfelt chick moment, and you are comparing me to Scott Lang.”
"And our guardian? If you tell me they've assigned Tony Stark, I don't know if I can accept." Wanda stated contemptuously.
“If I have to follow those rules so do you.” He called in return to her retreating back. She turned around and found his gaze on her, his eyes holding more life now.
Both Bucky and Rhodes sighed. "Damn it, I told you guys that we should have taken those assholes out with one of Tony's long range missiles."
Steve finally tore his tired eyes from Tony and looked into Rhodes’ serious face. “I never told you about Afghanistan. I was a wreck when the Humvees were attacked and Tony was taken prisoner. I couldn’t eat or sleep and I refused to even try for days afterwards. While he was gone I’d go on stretches for days where I didn’t do anything but pour over maps and join the soldiers who were out looking for him. I was completely consumed by the need to find him. See cause I was his friend, I was supposed to have his back, and the moment that I didn’t, he was gone.”
"Then you shouldn't have left them, Barton." She bit back.
Steve was sorry but Captain America would probably still have made the same choice if he had to do it over again. Steve cared about him but Captain America only ever saw his flaws. Tony could separate James Barnes from the Winter Soldier, but he couldn’t do the same with Steve Rogers and Captain America. He knew why, it came down to choice. James didn’t have a choice who he hurt and James hadn’t ever meant to hurt Tony. Steve did have a choice and Steve chose to hurt him.
“Peter?” Natasha pressed him. Tony smiled as he handed her the paper in his hands and put an arm around Peters shoulders. Natasha took the paper and read out, “The Effects of a Father: Bonds Deeper Than Blood”.
"Honey, you know he didn't mean to."
On the footage, Wanda had given up all pretenses and was against the wall laughing. Vision had caught on to the act and could be heard calling, “Oh verrryy funny, Tony! Ha. Ha. Get out here and fix this you lunatic!” Unfortunately for him, the whole ordeal had attracted everyone else in the tower, who had now come into the hallway and were witnessing Vision’s plight.
A woman's voice answered,
Confused, he looked at the box in her palm and then up at her. She was already looking at him, watching him watch the box with a smile playing on the corners of her mouth. “It looks like my fingerprint doesn’t unlock it, who might have guessed?” She teased. He scoffed at her, “I think the creator of the box might have.”
Immediately, the air in the room changed and Tony's body language shifted. T'Challa nearly felt the man's walls come back up. "I'm not sure I've had enough sleep or enough booze to hear any messages from them tonight."
Tony's smile grew as a blush rose on his cheeks. "I'm lucky to have them all. I don't know where I would be without them."
At that moment, in true Stark fashion, the elevator door opened and the man himself came walking out, a sleek tablet in his hand and Peter Parker bounding along at his side, wheeling in a large cart with locked metal bins stacked up on it.
"I enjoy sharks." Thor said, "They are incredibly interesting. Tony and I watched programs about them a few days ago. Very informative. A whole week of television dedicated to them, can you imagine?"
care for him and make the decision to leave. I truly do not understand why you are both so set upon only having one or the other."
. Looking at to his left, Shuri had her head resting on his shoulder. He loved their bond. As siblings, it seemed they always could tell what the other was thinking and right now, he knew she was watching and thinking the same thing. The Avengers were starting to come together.
In his rush to get away from James and his
"Okay, Nat, listen, I know I didn't talk to you about it first, but I promise I am not as stupid as you think I am right now. It was part of a plan, I swear."
. And guess what? My answer will haunt me and hurt me long after any of the physical pain has healed."
Rhodes gave him a small nod as he steered Pepper in the direction of the couch and suggested a drink, leaving Steve and Sam alone. “She is absolutely terrifying. No wonder Stark put her in charge.” Sam said as they watched them walk away. Steve could only nod in agreement, the woman was a force.
, Barton,” He breathed, lowering his arm, the gauntlet disappearing back into the bracelet on his wrist. He lifted his hand to his chest and pressed his palm against the arc reactor. “What is wrong with you?”
"Hey, Peter- ", Bucky called out. That was the first time he heard anyone use the kid's name. They had been careful about his identity.
"I will gladly open the lines of communication, thank you for your generosity, she will be thrilled to have another mind to converse with about these things. While we are on the subject, I have a message to pass on to you from another guest currently staying in my palace."
? Did you really think I wanted to kill you? I would never have gone that far, not on you or James. I was angry and I was blinded by that anger, but I am not a killer. I… I couldn’t have killed you. I had the shot and I didn’t take it.”
“My friend,” came the accented reply, “I know what this has cost you. Although I cannot say that I know the pain you feel, I can tell you that after everything I have witnessed and heard, I know it must be great. I am…” he hesitated, “most impressed with you. To face the demons is difficult enough, but to overcome them as you have, that is strength of another kind. Over our time I have grown quite fond of you, and your friendship is greatly appreciated. You are honorable, no matter what anyone might say.”
Tony again shook his head at his friend. “Alright Kat-hmandu, that will be quite enough of that. You know how I can’t stand the sentimental mush.”
The momentary elation he felt was quickly crushed as he heard Sam report over the comm, "Cap, we got a big problem. Three more blasts have gone off around the city, there are trapped civilians."
It was Natasha who answered, "Wanda broke off from Rhodes and I a few minutes ago. We haven't seen her."
T’Challa and Natasha arrived at the scene and Natasha dropped to her knees next to him to fuss over him and run her fingers through his bloody hair. T’Challa and Rhodes went back to the car and the King peered inside. “Ross is alive.” He reported as he pulled the man out of the car, not bothering to be careful. Ross hissed in pain as he was unceremoniously dumped on the ground. Other than a few scrapes and bruises, he was mostly unharmed, which is why T’Challa didn’t stop Rhodes when he hauled the man to his feet by his lapels, only to punch him square in the jaw and send him back down to the asphalt.
T’Challa found himself in awe, not for the first time, of how the pain of the past shaped the future. Even more so, he was impressed with how a person’s pain could tear lives apart, only to then mend them back together. What happened with Tony, James, and Steve was horrible, in every way. It had hurt people and broken trust, and yet, he was seeing a new level to the Avengers, one that hadn’t been there before and one that had the promise of making them so much stronger. The irony wasn’t lost on him that in order to build this trust and bond, the previous trust had to be absolutely decimated.
On legs that felt like they might suddenly give out, he forced his steps to approach the cart and peer into the bin. He barely managed to contain the sob threatening to tear from his throat when he saw the shield.
Tony huffed at that, “Touché. That’s Ste-Rodgers fault though.” Clint didn’t miss how Tony couldn’t say Steve’s name, but he chose not to comment.
Even the Soul Stone, which he saved for last, was simple to return.
“So he’s buying her some because she’s acting too childish to accept a gift from him?” Sam asked, trying not to sound too annoyed. James only shrugged as he continued to push the cart behind Tony, who said, “She won’t know. Vision will say he picked them up.”
is right. Anyone want to explain?"
"I was." He answered evenly, meeting Sam's gaze.
********
"I'll give you a tour of the lab and the BARF tech so you can see and understand it for yourself. You don't like it or you don't trust me and you can walk at any time. I will be clear and honest with you; I don't know that I can ever completely forget what happened with Barnes. I know it wasn't his fault, and I don't blame him, but I still lost my parents to his hands. If I blamed him for what happened I would have to blame Clint for the actions he committed under Loki's influence. That doesn't mean that I want to be his friend, but I won't attack him again."
sound, as though the world suddenly made sense.
"Steve, please, don't insult me with that bullshit."
T’Challa and Tony both had left early with Pepper and Rhodes to go over notes and speaking points with the lawyers. Natasha had gone with them as support and back up should anything go wrong at the press event.  Shuri stayed behind, and was now laughing at the table with Peter as they tried to balance hardboiled eggs on their foreheads. Soon, everyone is there and they are moving to the chairs and couches and turning on the television.
3. Tony has royally messed up before too, okay? And he thought he had all the right reasons for it. If anyone knows how it feels to lash out at someone who hurt your family in the heat of the moment, it should be Tony. cough*Siberia*cough. If he can forgive Bucky and the others, he can forgive Wanda for something she did before she was even part of their team.
“How you doin’ there, old man?” Tony whispered as he lifted Steve’s left arm and situated himself under it, wrapping his other arm around Steve snugly and hauling him upwards to stand. “’m okay.” He whispered back as Tony steadied him. “Seems to run on some form of electricity.” He joked with a wince. Tony smiled softly at him for that. He didn’t immediately let go either, instead he stayed tucked under Steve’s arm and braced him with his arm wrapped around Steve’s middle and his other palm pressed to the middle of Steve’s chest.
“He did well.” Nebula continued. She continued to stare deep into Steve’s eyes as she said it. “He got in more hits than anyone else, he even made him bleed.”
As he poured, Steve moved his left hand and laid it over Tony’s hand that was holding the glass. At the contact Tony jerked a bit and the steady pour splashed and spilled for a moment before he gained control again and set the carton down. Steve could see Tony’s reflection in the dark window as he stared at the counter hard, the muscle in his jaw working. Steve kept his hand firmly in place over Tony’s as he dipped his head and nuzzled the spot where Tony’s neck and shoulder met.
Laura came over and pushed a wet wash cloth against the cut and Clint looked up at her. Steve turned away as Clint’s hand reached for Laura’s other hand at her side. She was tense for a moment before she squeezed his hand back for a moment before releasing his hand and using hers to push his hair back and wipe the blood on his forehead away.
please.” Steve looked confused by gave a nod. James nodded back and took his hand away from Steve’s mouth. They both peered around the corner into the kitchen where Tony, T’Challa, and Rhodes were still standing
Steve had only glared at Bucky as he had laughed.
A silent moment passed before FRIDAY said,
They had all arrived in small groups until nearly everyone was there. Steve was in his outfit, but was missing his shield. He felt incredibly awkward without it but would didn't voice the fact to anyone other than Bucky –
“But you have it, none the less. You also have my respect and my admiration. I watched you fight him. On that note, don’t refer to that monster as your father. He wasn’t your father and he doesn’t deserve that title. Not showing emotion is not what makes you perfect or strong. You are strong.”
"Tony?" A few steps closer. "Tony, its James." He lowered himself down to the floor and shuffled a little closer to the man. The only sounds were Tony's staggered and uneven breaths, desperately trying to gain some control over them. "Tony, you're home, at the Avengers Compound. It's me James. Maggie and Laura are out shopping with the kids, but they'll be home soon."
With Tony in his thoughts he felt himself start to drift off before being brought back with the sudden ring of the comm. Again, Bucky answered and Natasha's face was on the monitor, but she looked far from the happy calm she had been composed of earlier. Before anyone could even greet her she was speaking frantically.
"Alright, enough, that's enough. We don't need a play by play." Tony rushed to end this. They weren't supposed to know these things. Rogers could keep his
At T’Challa’s look, Tony added Black Panther to the list as well. Peter looked beseechingly at Tony, but Tony shook his head and said, “I don’t know the current situation. Aunt May would kill me. Sit this one out, okay Pete?” The kid looked disappointed, but nodded his acceptance when Shuri linked her arm with his and gave him a smile.
The elevator bell alerted them that they had arrived at their floor. One by one they all stepped off into the familiar area.
Steve stepped forward and put a hand on T’Challa’s shoulder. “Please, I am begging you-” But T’Challa raised a hand. “I am sorry, Steve, I cannot. We will bring him back, but you need to stay. Shuri, transmit this to our comms and send us his location.”
James nodded and responded, “Got it FRI, tell him I’ll be right down.” Steve felt a stab of jealousy. He used to love watching Tony work in his lab, and his favorite was when Tony would ask for his help holding something while he fixed it or anything else Tony would allow him to do.
T'Challa smiled at her before answering, "Thank you, we are very glad to be here. It is an important night."
Tony wouldn't meet his gaze, though his eyes flicked in his direction.
At first it was only Bucky and Tony together in the secure living space of the lab, but after they had been forced to spend hours together Tony seemed to start to relax around him a little bit more.
Clint tried not to let the tears fall as he smiled and whispered back, “Sleep tight, baby. I love you.”
Lila turned to follow the others down the hallway. Clint caught Tony’s gaze for only a moment, but tried to convey as much gratitude as he possibly could. Tony’s lips gave a small upward quirk before he followed Lila’s footsteps, leaving just the two of them again.
“Because you made a stupid decision! You should have left; you should have continued on! We have a mission and a purpose and-”
I am SO sorry this update has come so late! I have had so much going on lately with work and school. Updates will be coming often from now on.
Tony finally came to the lab and accessed his secure area a few days into his arrival.
Steve couldn’t fight the giant smile on his face as he watched Peter nearly die of embarrassment on the spot, Tony looking every bit the smug proud father at his side. It’s obvious that the paper is about the relationship and father figure that Tony represents in Peter’s life. Tony choked up momentarily, before recovering and pulling a surprised Peter into the kitchen saying, “Come on blood, we’ve got celebratory ice cream calling our names.”
"Ant-Man, get out of that building, its about to go down." Rhodes called. "I have a bomb signature popping up on my screen."
He and Sam laughed as Tony looked perplexed. Sam answered, “No.” but adjusted his seat anyways.
Cooper, Lila, and Cassie quickly approached Tony. The two girls had tears flowing down their cheeks seeing the bruising and blood on his face. Cooper's face was scrunched up, the poor boy trying to hold back any tears and appear strong.
Tony fought the impulse to roll his eyes at Ross' predictability.
Defensive immediately, she snapped, “I don’t need your pity.”
James turned a positively gleeful look on Steve as he told him that he and Natasha were going to go hang it on the Lab door. Steve shook his head as he watched them take off with Sam in tow. Children. He was absolutely surrounded by children.
Steve shook himself. Tony was right. It was a simulation but it was important. He could do this, he had to do this. With the familiar weight of the shield in his hand he felt the need to prove to everyone, but most importantly to Tony, that he deserved it.
It was Bucky who spoke up and took over the call, to Steve's surprise. "Hey Web-Kid, feeling up to a status report?"
Steve watched the muscle in Tony’s jaw jump as the clenched his jaw. “You’re messing with the wrong person, Ross.” He warned, eyes growing darkly sober.
“You used your powers to show that to Tony.” Vision stared at her.
She watched as a camera crew followed Tony's path to the stairwell and for a moment she considered putting a stop to this whole charade, before remembering Tony's words. He had said it was important and he had basically asked her to trust him. If she put a stop to whatever plan he was in the middle of, it would make him think she didn't trust him. Sighing, she let the camera crew pass her.
Sam rushed forward and Peter gave him a bright smile as he handed the little flying robot to Sam who took it reverently.
As usual, she was on an important phone call putting together last minute preparations, so he waited and looked around until she finished.
T'Challa continued to smile as he watched Tony Stark heard the children down the hall into their bedrooms.
James Barnes was laying on the couch in Stark's lab. Tony had begun letting move freely in and out of the lab between his living space, even when the genius wasn't around. He was careful not to touch anything though, first because he was sure he might hurt himself, and second he didn't want Tony to regret the trust he had begun to show him.
Steve forces a smile on his face and walks the rest of the way into the room where he is met with the surprise of seeing Tony not only awake, but dressed and sitting on the edge of the bed with Peter next to him, holding a duffel bag with his things in it.
“I know that you are going to be angry, but you know that I have to ask; What the hell do you mean by that?” He said as he held her gaze with determination.
"Colonel Rhodes." Steve breathed out and held out his hand for a handshake. The Colonel turned a cool gaze on Steve and suddenly Steve felt the urge to fidget under his eyes.
"And did you tell them where you were going? You left your family in a position to be just as worried as you were. Lucky for them, you all don't know how to disappear without help."
"Why didn't you alert them to that fact? Why not go together? You left them unprotected as well and you paid the ultimate price for it."
Rhodes finally cut in, "Nat, what is the problem?"
Tony’s vitals spiked at Ross’ words, his heart rate picking up.
The AI's voice was detached and emotionless as she listed,
, Dr. Field had said- better.
"What happened," Tony said, coming down the stairs, limping slightly, "Is that you just lost two of your teammates. Had that simulation been real, you would be now reporting to the world the following statistics: FRIDAY, read them out."
Next he turned to Scott, "You ended up dying as well. The hostages had already been executed, you knew that."
, he corrected himself.
As he came closer he gave her a soft smile, this time leaning in and kissing her cheek before telling her, "Truly Nat, you look lovely." She ducked her head in a silent thank you. "However, I think you may just be missing something." Her nose crinkled in confusion before Tony pulled out a small box from his pants pocket.
To everyone's surprise, Steve picked up the pen next to his packet, flipped the document to the back page and signed his name with a flourish. He knew exactly what they said and the changes that had been made.
, and damn but it was beautiful. Tony swallowed a few times, then started biting his lip and Steve could almost hear the gears in Tony’s head turning. He cleared his throat and stepped away from Steve a bit and called out, “FRI, take off the Penthouse restriction. We’re going to need a little help finding out how to get this off our hands.”
Left standing in the bathroom T'Challa shook his head. Yes, this would be difficult. Stark was as guarded as they come, his walls built so high it seemed they were nearly impossible to scale. And yet, T'Challa had made himself a promise after Siberia. He had seen a strong, smart, good man brought low, in a way he had never imagined seeing another human being before. He had seen the look in his eyes as the betrayal had sunk in. The clear pain and agony over losing those who meant the most to him.
"Alright," he called, "Clint, find yourself a high vantage point, you can cover us from there. Sam, lets have you and Vision in the sky, you be our eyes and let us know where we need to be. Spider-Man, you and I will take evacuation of civilians with Barnes and Ant-Man. Widow you are with Colonel Rhodes, use his suit's capabilities to find the bombs and take Scarlet Witch with you, she can use her force fields to contain the blasts if anything goes wrong."
"FRIDAY, where is Tony now?" Steve asked the AI as he raised his coffee cup to his lips.
Was young, but not that young.
Steve suddenly decided he wasn’t hungry anymore and retreated to his room. Sam looked at him suspiciously.
“Tony created Ultron because of Wanda’s vision, didn’t he?” Clint sighed. “And then we made him fight next to her and house her.” Natasha put a hand on his shoulder and said, “Come on Clint, we need to finish cleaning your head.” She wiped her eyes on her sleeve and tried to maintain some confidence in her step as the guided him out of the lab.
Steve tried to smile hearing Bucky's voice. He had been awake for over 2 weeks now, and Steve had done his best to give his friend his focus and happiness, but Bucky wasn't stupid. He might not always feel like James "Bucky" Barnes all the time, but he still knew when Steve lied. It hadn't taken long for Steve to come clean. Of course, Sam threatening to do it for him might have sped up the process.
Tony chuckled at that and James knew he had gotten through to him. “He’s an idiot, but he’s a good one. He doesn’t know how to do anything unless he does it 100%, he’s gonna be good to you, Tones. How about you, are you gonna be good to him?”
"Or is that what you want, Stark? Because I guarantee you, I can make things very very difficult for you if you are even thinking of trying to play your way out of this and help your criminal friends."
control other peoples fear.” She nodded. “How can we trust each other?” Wanda whispered into the silence of the room after their tears had subsided. Tony sighed. “I trust that you will do your best. You fought with the others and you protected them fiercely. Do you trust that I will do my best?” Again, she nodded. “That’s all we can do, isn’t it? We’ll work on it, okay?”
most of them.” Ross’ sneer contorted into something truly ugly.
He shouldn't listen in to the mans one sided conversation, and yet the Captain's voice was deep with emotion and sounded frankly, broken beyond shattered.
So, yes, I know that this may be an unpopular direction and that's okay, you don't have to love it. :)
“FRIDAY, Critical Situation Override. Authorization: Rogers, Steven. Code: CAP1945”
"Yes!" Both Laura and Maggie answered together.
James snorts at him and smacks the back of his head before he stands up and offers Tony a hand up as he rolls onto his back. “You are absolutely impossible, Stark. What’s wrong, has it been a while, playboy?”
Steve felt himself tear up at that. God, he was so pathetic, but Tony standing here, even with his back to him, talking to him, it was something Steve thought he would never get again.
A few moments later, the elevator doors opened and Secretary Ross strolled into the room like he owned it. He looked around for a moment before his gaze landed on Tony, slumped in a chair, his hair mussed up, a nearly empty bottle of scotch open in front of him.
Tony and Peter stepped off the elevator, in the middle of a debate. “Peter, if I give you a room here, you’ll never leave.” Peter held Cassie’s small hand in his as he answered, “What?! I would so! I do have a life, you know- friends! It would just be like, in case I needed to stay over or something.”  Maggie, who was holding a sleepy Nathaniel in her arms, rolled her eyes as she stepped off the elevator behind them, Cooper and Lila trailing after her.
Tony could hear T’Challa’s smile through his sleek SI phone he held pressed to his ear. Even across the world in Wakanda, he could picture the smug smile that would be stretching across the King’s face. Tony nearly wished he were there to smack it off him.
Tony turned an exasperated but knowing smile on him and began to walk away towards the doors, calling out, "FRI, baby, please take off the safely protocols keeping Sergeant Barnes confined to this floor. We're going to take a little field trip."
“Sit. I will look for supplies and salvage what I am able.” She instructs before heading off.
T'Challa's voice brought him back to the conversation at hand. The King clearly felt he needed to clear one thing up.
Ross would have to be completely incompetent not to suspect that it wasn't a coincidence that many of the concerns the Avengers had voiced were suddenly being addressed and amended.
Shaking his head at how truly helpful having the AI was he responded, “Thank you FRIDAY, you really are an amazing gal.”
floor!” and “Kiss
Lila looked into Tony’s eyes, uncertain, but he gave her a smile and an encouraging nod.
. If he really knew the truth, and he had not only let it shatter me anyways, but
Tony bit his lip and after a beat he nodded his head with a smile. “Hell yeah I am.”
Peter clutched the paper in his hand tightly as he ran up to Tony excitedly and pushed the paper into Tony’s free hand.
About 30 minutes later they were headed to the front of the store with a cart full of the strangest assortment of items Sam had ever seen. Tony had insisted on Sam picking out at least three items, saying that he was an important business man and wouldn’t be able to go grocery shopping every time Sam was having a cupboard crisis.
She reported.
His mind began to swim in the moments between being conscious and falling into the darkness. He didn’t know exactly where he was and he couldn’t make out the noises or voices around him. Vaguely he wondered if everyone else was okay. A pair of sad blue eyes stood out in his mind.
Spider-Mans AI, Karen, spoke over the comms,
The smile fell from Tony’s face at his words and was replaced with something more real. “Steve-” He started.
“Hmm.” Was the only noise Tony made, his head tipped back against the headboard and his eyes closed.
Things had slowly improved when she had started to come down to the lab while he worked. At first they hardly spoke, she would slide into the lab and sit in the chair at one of his many desks and play games on his computers. She was damn good at those first person shooter ones; it was really unfair to the other online players.
Tony pulled back and Steve got a good look at just how beautifully wrecked he looked in the low light. His lips red and swollen from being kissed and bitten, eyes dark, chest heaving. His husky voice was equally wrecked when he whispered, “Will you sleep here with me tonight?”
Everyone smiled as they passed Peter, slapping him on the back and congratulating him for being so ‘brave’. Peter looked less than thrilled as they filed past him. Natasha gave him a love slap on the cheek and said, “Way to take one for the team, Parker.”
"When did you start drinking again? I know you had quit; in fact, you were quite proud of it."
Steve was momentarily thrown that Tony had an implant in his eye, but upon hearing what it would do for them he felt relief and gratitude. They gathered together again around the screen on the wall. Shuri exclaimed in success as the information from the implant started to stream on the large screen. Steve called to T’Challa who was still on the phone and said, “I need permission to go after him.” James rose from his place next to Shuri and voiced the same, followed by the others in the compound.

Steve looked to his left at Sam, but the other man's eyes were downcast, occasionally glancing towards the front of the Jet at the pilot's chair. "Hey Sam," he called, getting the man's attention, "You'll be okay. He's a good man. Just give it a little more time, maybe privacy."
Steve was about to argue when he saw them all pulling out wallets and swapping money with each other. Natasha grinned triumphantly as she collected the largest sums.
T’Challa acknowledged this with yet another tiny nod. “And yet, what was left behind has the foundations to build upon it, does it not?”
