‚ÄúAbsolutely lovely? More like an absolute nightmare. I can‚Äôt wait to hear your ideas on how to explain this to the SI board.‚Äù
Peter snapped out of his traitorous thoughts and realized this whole time he had been sitting there with his mouth half open, his burger only inches from his mouth as he spaced out. He could feel the flush overtake his cheeks, he hated how easily he blushed around Tony.
He tried ignoring it the first time it had happened about 4 weeks ago. He managed alright and was able to get some fitful sleep in once he willed it down to a semi hard-on by imagining everything undesirable as he could: Ned in a tutu, painfully remembering walking in on his Aunt accidentally in the shower when he was 8, MJ and Flash suddenly dating with excessive PDA; you know, standard stuff. The second time, he tried the cold shower method, still determined that he was not going to get off to Mr. Stark in his own Tower.
Peter got impossibly pinker, hating how he tripped all over his words like his tongue was sliding over a sheet of black ice.
The third time he gave up and submitted to the thought of getting off in Stark Tower, to Tony Stark, in his own shower. Which apparently he was going to do now, as his mind so helpfully jumped on board and began to play out his fantasies. Wrapping his hand around himself he began to imagine it was Stark‚Äôs, rough from working with metal and blow torches despite being perfectly manicured.
Once Peter was no longer crouched over him, Pepper was next to appear, and her audible gasp of surprise before she clapped her hand over her mouth, eyes wide, scared Tony. Pepper had seen a lot of things; if she was shocked, it probably wasn‚Äôt good.
Tony‚Äôs hand involuntarily clutched his chest, right where the arc reactor used to be, in the exact spot Steve had smashed his shield into the Iron Man armor so hard he cracked Tony‚Äôs already fragile sternum that previously had to be reconstructed after the removal of the arc reactor. He was six weeks recovered from the surgery to repair it, adding yet another snarled scar to chest. He was finally cleared to lift objects under 30 pounds, but he did seem to remember the doctor saying something about being susceptible to infection now the subject arose.
Peter watched with rapt attention, his eyes rounding with barely contained excitement upon witnessing the Sorcerer‚Äôs powers. His eyes bounced back and forth, following the person who talked as Tony and Stephen bantered and then it happened- Strange started showing Tony the end of the world.
Strange smiled, and Tony was struck by how much the action simultaneously illuminated the man‚Äôs face and made him look lethal.
And that's all, folks! (Keep an eye out for maybe some bonus art from tina in the future üëÄ). Hope you had fun; we had a BLAST making this! Thanks for reading <3
Steve sighed. They actually did look really comfy. He grabbed the last pillow and the duvet and shuffled off the edge of the bed. He snuggled up against Bucky‚Äôs back, tucking the duvet around all three of them. Tony purred and reached around wildly until Steve grabbed his hand and wound their fingers together, resting them on Bucky‚Äôs hip. He nuzzled his face into the back of Bucky‚Äôs neck. The soft, gentle presence of the two of them made all the tension melt out of his body.
Tony shut him up with a look. ‚ÄúThis is my thing, okay? I‚Äôm not going to make you get a suit for it. Bring Buck and Pegs or whoever, and I‚Äôll get us all a car, we can arrive as a group.‚Äù
He knew he shouldn‚Äôt be mad at the guy who‚Äôd done what he couldn‚Äôt, and he knew he shouldn‚Äôt be mad at Steve for not seeing what had been right in front of him all along, but he couldn‚Äôt help it. Those feelings welled up anyway, and he was afraid of how they might come out. He‚Äôd never left movie night before - he wondered if Steve would even notice he was gone, even care - but he couldn‚Äôt sit there and pretend he was okay when he really wasn‚Äôt.
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt mind me.‚Äù Tony starts backing away, as subtly as he can. He doesn‚Äôt have a gauntlet watch, JARVIS glasses, or even underwear, so he isn‚Äôt eager to get into it with a pair of slightly inebriated thugs.
But it wasn‚Äôt true. He‚Äôd built a life here, one brick at a time, and that was the true terror of his nightmare. He‚Äôd finally managed a family again, finally found love and friendship in his life again, and it could just as easily be ripped away from him, as it had before. He was the perfect soldier, and the perfect soldier gave his life for his cause, right? Seve had done so, over and over, and yet he knew he‚Äôd be asked to again, and he didn‚Äôt know if he could.
Steve brushed his fingers over the front of the reactor once more then stepped back. ‚ÄúTony? Anytime.‚Äù
-‚Äù Tony ground down on Steve‚Äôs face, pulling hard enough on the chains to make the hooks in the wall creak and groan along with him. He was sobbing now, begging wordlessly, and Steve didn‚Äôt relent, didn‚Äôt slow down, and didn‚Äôt touch Tony‚Äôs cock.
Steve watched helplessly as Tony came yet again, the tentacle sounding his cock blocking anything from coming out, but the telltale shake and cry making it clear what was happening. He was stunning in his pleasure, taut and slick and dripping, drool slipping down his chin, legs shaking where they were bound. Steve couldn't help wishing he'd been the one to bring Tony there.
‚ÄúI -‚Äù Steve cut himself off. He rubbed his face across the tops of his knees where they were drawn up to his chest. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. It‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ harming me. I just - I don‚Äôt like the cold. I don‚Äôt - I can‚Äôt -‚Äù He cut off sharply.
Tony could help but laugh. ‚ÄúHe is brilliant, gorgeous, charming, and a tiger in the sack, but never let it be said Bucky Barnes is good with math.‚Äù
Tony blushed prettily. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know you were going to go to all this trouble so I sort of ordered a custom, white chocolate and caramel cake from Giovanni. Sorry‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what I always do on my birthday. I guess it never occured to me that you guys might do something. But it doesn‚Äôt matter!‚Äù He walked back to the front hall and tugged a big, white box with orange ribbon off the table by the door. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just freeze it. Or I‚Äôll bring it to work on Monday and give it to my staff to eat.‚Äù
Vision just gave him a searching look, his blue eyes doing that thing that made Tony feel like the android was seeing into his very core.
Tony eyed him while chewing thoughtfully on a fry. They elapsed into a mostly comfortable silence while they polished off their food. The waitress came back after a while and whisked away their trash and trays, and delivering their thick, handmade milkshakes. Peter pulled his happily to him, desperate for a sugar fix to make him feel better about his awkward realization.
Vision setting a mug of steaming brew before him jarred him from his thoughts and Tony murmured a low thank you, accepting cream and sugar when the android offered it. He wrapped his hands around the porcelain and let the heat seep into his hands in the way Pepper used to do on rainy days when she made her favorite tea. It was a comforting gesture and feeling somewhat fortified, Tony lifted his eyes to meet Vision‚Äôs.
‚ÄúThat was the year I became CEO of Stark Industries. It was a good a year‚Ä¶I think. There were a lot of parties. I was often‚Ä¶moderately functional. Lots of women‚Ä¶yeah, it was a good year.‚Äù
He was doing that thing he did, where he talked a mile a minute and his tawny brown eyes grew wide and his cheeks flushed pink with embarrassment. Tony was a sucker for that; Peter was a ball of passionate energy and he threw himself wholeheartedly into every situation he got himself into. Just like Rogers, Tony thought to himself before he pushed the thought away hurriedly.
‚ÄúYou are going to want to drink a lot of water after this,‚Äù he advised, do that weird thing he did with his hands.
By the way, the anti-aging science Peter is working on is called microlipoinjection. We are pretending that for this fiction, it isn't a thing yet.
Peter hated silences and filled the elevator with excited chatter edged with nervousness about what he had read in some of the medical journals about some experimental trials and the findings. He knew Tony was only half listening and was ok with it that not everything he was saying was sticking anywhere in the older genius‚Äôs brain. Even if it was only momentarily, even if it was just partially, Peter was glad to provide some sort of comforting distraction to the man he so admired. Even after having a considerable amount of Tony‚Äôs attention for the couple of months since Siberia, Peter still had episodes of word vomit around Tony that left him flushed with embarrassment.
Tony realized his hand was still stretched across the table and pulled it back. This was Peter. He was an innocent
Tony looked at the image and fought down a wave of violent d√©j√† vu with deep breaths. The Sorcerer showed him what looked like a giant purple alien, wearing gold colored armor, cackling while the world burned. In each hand he held the limp bodies of Tony‚Äôs friends- in his right hand was the large green body of the Hulk, whose face was smashed in beyond recognition. His left held Peter‚Äôs broken form by the back of his war tattered suit, his head hanging from an unnatural angle.
Once the thought hits, Steve can‚Äôt find the thread of it again, can‚Äôt find the end so he can follow it, inch by inch, back to where the idea starts. It‚Äôs like, one minute, Tony Stark is his best friend and teammate, and the next minute, the entire concept of loving him has beamed, fully formed, into Steve‚Äôs head, and he‚Äôs left blinking and stunned.
He rolled his hips faster now, pushing breathy gasps out of Tony's throat that shot straight to his cock. They were both building, tentacles surrounding every inch of them. A firm slick tentacle massaged Steve prostate from behind, stretching his hole around its length, other tendrils curled around his throat, his fingers, his ankles, stroking, pressing, teasing, and the mass of them kept the two body cocooned in a soft, undulating nest, free-floating in the lack of gravity.
Tony guided him through it slowly but surely, his voice steady even when the rest of him started to shake.
Steve blinked awake, smacking his dry tongue against the roof of his mouth. They needed to get a humidifier or something; he always woke up parched here. Tony was curled in the curve of Steve‚Äôs body, one hand tucked under his pillow, the other resting lightly on Steve‚Äôs bicep where it was trapped under Tony‚Äôs neck. Steve snuck his free arm under Tony‚Äôs shirt, pressing it flat against his chest and got a sleepy, little groan in response.
‚ÄúDid I - ? Yes.‚Äù Tony shuffled half off his stool. ‚ÄúI thought maybe you didn‚Äôt. You were so scared and everything‚Ä¶‚Äù
Thanks to an anon on tumblr who gave us the jumping point for this one! (Though we had to tame it down a lot for our own delicate sensibilities :O)
Tony turned down a sidestreet, sighing with relief when a tall, brick building blocked some of the wind. A car rumbled down the street behind him. He just wanted to sit in the bottom of his tub with the wine he was supposed to be drinking with his boyfriend tonight, hot water on full blast and be left alone. But he was still six blocks from home and it was starting to get dark.
He laughed and clapped the man on the shoulder. ‚ÄúThank you. Your performance was delightful. I guess I‚Äôll just have to wait and see who it was from. I hope they make themselves known to me soon. I‚Äôd very much like to thank them.‚Äù
Ant placed his pointer finger gently on the large yellow duck on the centre of the box. "Dah?" he asked around the binky.
The snowball slammed into the side of Tony‚Äôs head with perfect accuracy, and Tony threw his hands up over his head and stumbled sideways into the snow. He came up spluttering, scraping snow out of his jacket collar. He started yelling across the yard, and Bucky merely threw his arms in the air then crossed them, managing to shrug at the same time.
the music faded out to nothing, and Bucky straightened up suddenly, his waistband snapping back into place. ‚ÄúWelp, that‚Äôs it, I guess. What‚Äôs for dinner?‚Äù
‚ÄúBrock and Justin made a bet with me that I couldn‚Äôt get the hottest guy in school to go to prom with me.‚Äù Tony grinned and bounced on his toes. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt know we know each other! They bet me fifty bucks.‚Äù
This is a fill for my bday party prompts 2019. rogers-stark45 asked for: "SteveTony, getting together, maybe tony is in denial of his feelings for Steve but one day he hears him speak French and he internally explodes"
But then Tony pointed one way, towards the auxiliary garage, and Bucky pointed the other, throwing his hands in the air when Tony crossed his arms and shook his head. Tony turned away, marching through the snow towards the garage, and Steve watched as Bucky stared after him for a moment then reached down and packed a ball of snow into his metal palm. He shaped it then lined up, sniper‚Äôs eyes going narrow and focused, and then he let fly.
‚ÄúUm. Sure. Same, I guess.‚Äù Steve waited until the waiter walked away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, are you going to call the cops or what?‚Äù
A melancholy bassline wound through, shifting the melody down, even overpowering it at times. Steve‚Äôs hands clenched into fists in his lap. He couldn‚Äôt breathe.
how he‚Äôd been told to behave when meeting his future husband for the first time, but there was no going back now.
Steve turned a cheeky grin on Tony that was just a little bit too lucid to be a mistake. ‚ÄúI know. That‚Äôs why I said, someday.‚Äù
There was something playful in Tony‚Äôs voice, so Steve took a breath then took a chance. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ just kind, attractive regulars.‚Äù
"Maybe try a different pocket. Wouldn't want it falling out and being rescued by someone handsomer than me."
Tony sighed and rubbed his hand over his face. "Sorry isn't going to cut it, Buck. Do you know what this means?"
Tony watched Steve ratchet tighter. It was like every one of his gears was rusting before Tony‚Äôs eyes, clenching and catching and creaking. Creases that Steve‚Äôs perfect face usually didn‚Äôt display appeared at the corner of his eyes. His hands clenched into fists at his sides, then released, then clenched again.
‚ÄúMhm.‚Äù Tony leaned over onto the counter and looked up at Steve through far too many, long, dark eyelashes. ‚ÄúYour number.‚Äù
Tony looked up from his book at the shuffle of lazy footsteps coming down the hall. He smiled when Captain America appeared, in all his Yummy Sushi pajama glory, eyes still half-shut and a pout staying firmly fixed to his face.
‚ÄúFirst painting as homeowners!‚Äù Tony‚Äôs fingers drew random circles on the outside of Steve‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúRowdy did his first pee on his very own grass.‚Äù
Steve snorted. "I'm tiny, not sick, Tony. I'll be fine." But a moment later, a glass of coconut water was deposited in his hand.
Steve stabbed a piece of bitter, underripe cantaloupe with a fork. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not your fault, Stark. You shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with my shit.‚Äù
"Yeah, yeah." Steve couldn't meet Bucky's eye. "You know I hate being useless. I want to contribute. Like you do."
‚ÄúI‚Äôll try my best not to sully your reputation.‚Äù Steve grinned and swooped low again then shot straight up. He could feel the g-forces of the movement, but not as much as he expected; it was softened somehow by the structure of the suit.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright. It‚Äôs not really, I mean, it‚Äôs not a normal thing‚Ä¶ to notice. You were right to be freaked out. But it‚Äôs totally innocent, I swear. I don‚Äôt know anything about your company.‚Äù Steve resisted the urge to shove the sharpie cap between his teeth and start chewing. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù
Steve slipped down onto his back and shoved his head between Tony‚Äôs knees, grabbing one in each hand and yanking him forward as far as the chains would let him go. Steve‚Äôs hands were iron clamps on Tony‚Äôs thighs, and he held him still as he thrust up to nuzzle into the cleft of Tony‚Äôs ass.
‚ÄúThat feels so good,‚Äù Steve breathed, and Tony choked a little, moaned, then picked up the pace again. ‚ÄúYou like that? Being told how good you feel, how good you are?‚Äù
‚ÄúWell, as I said, I‚Äôm an investigative reporter and I‚Äôm looking into a murder that happened five days ago. A man was shot and killed in his locked study with no witnesses except the gardener who was outside and saw a confrontation through the window. She swore up and down it was the man‚Äôs son who killed him.‚Äù
Tony smiled softly and fiddled with the lapel on Steve‚Äôs jacket. ‚ÄúReally. It‚Äôs always been you. Why do you think I let you win at Street Fighter so much?‚Äù
‚ÄúI can sleep at the end of the book, JARVIS, right now we‚Äôre go-go-go. Because deadlines. And potatoes.‚Äù
Natasha smiled indulgently. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs probably on the roof. He‚Äôs been up there a lot with the B-team since you left.‚Äù
Thor looked across the room to where Tony and Steve were sprawled on the couch. Steve was gazing at Tony the same way he always did, chin resting on his arm, nodding along while Tony described his latest project in detail. ‚ÄúSteve?‚Äù Thor asked, breaking into the conversation. ‚ÄúDo you feel alright?‚Äù
It had been a fabulous night, one of the best hook-ups Steve had ever had, and now he was about to have one hell of a souvenir, and he needed to let Tony know.
His cock ached, heavy and full between his legs, and he longed for a touch on it, needed to fill Steve‚Äôs hot length press inside him and his huge hand around his cock, stroking, pulling, gripping almost too hard, threatening that super soldier strength. He groaned, dropping his head down between his arms and tugging on the thick, fabric straps until his fingers tingled.
"Your side being that it's better to pretend to be my boyfriend, in front of my actual boyfriend, than deal with every woman at this party flirting with you?"
‚ÄúI‚Äôm awful. I mean, that‚Äôs what everyone says. Rightfully so! I‚Äôm loud and I babble and I don‚Äôt make any sense and I talk out of turn and I can never remember what I‚Äôm supposed to say or where I‚Äôm supposed to sit or what fork I‚Äôm supposed to use.‚Äù
"No, I'm afraid not. I really need to talk to you. Privately." At the uncomfortable looks everyone else gave him, Steve sighed. "I can make an appointment to come back another time. I'm sure you're very busy. But I didn't get your number, and your‚Ä¶ very dedicated staff won't let me through without one."
Steve always had a lot to give, filling Tony up so he dripped and spilled when Steve pulled free, but for now, Steve stayed buried deep inside him, folded over to press soft lips to Tony‚Äôs chest, locked tight. If Tony closed his eyes, breathed in the scent of sex and sweat and Steve, maybe this moment would go on forever. He was a good boy; he deserved it.
‚ÄúI guess so.‚Äù Steve took the seat opposite him. The lunch room was crowded, but Tony had managed to snag an empty table for the two of them.
And Peter‚Äôs hips jerked forward as he sprayed himself all over the tile in front of him, dick pulsing as he emptied his balls of what felt like a week's worth of semen. He rested his forehead against the tiles and let the water wash away the evidence. He wished it could wash away the burning shame that lit his face and tips of his ears on fire. Surely if Stark knew what Peter really thought of him, he‚Äôd be utterly disgusted and that would be the last Peter ever saw of him. But Peter had no idea how to escape the infatuation he had with his mentor, and he‚Äôd accepted it was just a burning secret he was going to have to live with for the rest of his natural life.
‚ÄúYou, young man, have made a grave error in judgement. By feeding me this most ridiculously delicious breakfast, you have thus doomed yourself to be the personal breakfast chef of Tony Stark. I hope you made a lot because if I remember correctly, my 21-year-old self can eat a lot.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs too late anyhow,‚Äù Strange continued, albeit in a softer, more gentle tone. Tony‚Äôs eyes snapped to his and saw sympathy shining there.
‚ÄúUm, yeah. Is that not ok? I totally get it, you probably follow a strict diet, I probably should too, being a hero means you should stay fit, right? You don‚Äôt have to eat it, it‚Äôs just something that May and I do when she‚Äôs not working on the weekends and I thought, since I‚Äôm usually here, that maybe I‚Äôd carry the tradition over, but it‚Äôs ok, Mr. Stark, really you don‚Äôt have to eat any of it.‚Äù
‚ÄúAh-ah. Before you sully your taste buds with chocolate, real original, by the way, you need to taste this beauty,‚Äù Tony commanded, dipping his silver long handled spoon down into his frosty treat and producing a heaping helping for Peter, extending it out to him.
‚ÄúFRIDAY, scan my sternum for possible signs of osteomyelitis,‚Äù Tony asked, arching a brow smugly at the Sorcerer, who simply arched one back.
Said Sorcerer‚Äôs hands were bathed in a purple light that had swirling circles of what looked like ancient runes. Tony made for the button on his watch but Strange beat him by miles, aiming both hands at Tony and encasing him in the purple light. Tony‚Äôs eyes went wide with shock- he could feel the magic coursing through his body, twisting in his veins, curling around his bones, tingling up his nerves. It didn‚Äôt hurt, it was a warm feeling, and almost pleasurable the way a lover‚Äôs caress is across the back of your hand.
‚ÄúOk, right, so kid, trigger warning. There‚Äôs something you are about to watch that‚Äôs rather, well, gruesome? Hard to swallow. So, if you need FRIDAY to stop playing the video, just say the word.‚Äù
‚ÄúNot at the moment, thank you FRIDAY,‚Äù Tony replied. He felt scandalized that some complete stranger had strolled his way into his garage by some sort of fairy dust method and thought he fucking knew everything about him.
Peter swelled with pride; this was the happiest he‚Äôd seen Tony in weeks. Aunt May always told him that good food equaled a good mood; Peter was pleased that it worked. He just wanted to take care of Tony, in any way Tony would let him, and he figured if telling a little white lie about a ‚Äúbreakfast tradition‚Äù got him closer to that goal, it would be ok. He‚Äôd punish himself for it by washing all the dishes instead of letting the house maids do so.
‚ÄúYou need better friends, kid, if hanging out with me is the highlight of your week. Come on,‚Äù he said, sliding his hand down to place it between Peter‚Äôs shoulder blades, guiding him toward the wide wrap- around white leather couch, ‚Äúyou are going to want to sit down for this one.‚Äù
‚ÄúThank you, Mr. Stark. But if you are going to insist on paying, I‚Äôm going to insist on you letting me leave the tip.‚Äù
They sat at a secluded vinyl booth in the back of the restaurant away from the windows. It wasn‚Äôt the most capacious design and Peter flushed hotly as his legs brushed against Tony‚Äôs beneath the table. He snatched up a menu and hid his flaming face behind it, trying to focus on reading the words. He chewed his bottom lip as he tried to contemplate why suddenly being within close proximity and even touched by Tony now affected him like this, when so many times before the same actions barely blipped on his radar beyond the awe he always held for Tony.
‚ÄúUm, so I, if you want, and if not it‚Äôs totally ok too, I see you are busy and I don‚Äôt know when you got up, so maybe, already, and that‚Äôs fine because you can always heat it up later, but I ‚Äì ‚Äú
Tony stirred groggily on the floor. Somewhere in the distance he thought he could hear FRIDAY, but it was far away and his head HURT. He felt like he‚Äôd been smashed into the side of a building by the Hulk without his armor on and somehow lived to tell the tale. Maybe that is what happened. Maybe Bruce had finally come back, gotten pissed at the state of abuse Tony had put his recovering body through, and Hulked out on him. God, he missed his science bro.
‚ÄúHey kid,‚Äù Tony croaked out, bringing an arm up to rest on Peter‚Äôs shoulder in what he hoped was a reassuring gesture. It had been Peter who recovered him from his crash landing on the helipad after Siberia. The kid had helped pry him from the damaged armor and rushed him to medical, and was an ever-present appearance at his bedside as much as Pepper and Rhodey would allow before Tony was lucid enough to decide what he wanted Peter around to see. He hated that Peter had seen any of it, honestly. Tony wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted Peter seeing whatever this was, either.
Peter mentally face-palmed. Of all the people in the world to get a crush on, he had to choose Stark. The multi-billionaire genius who could get anyone he wanted who would not so much as look at a scrawny teenage boy in that type of way. Oh, he was so fucked.
A shudder ran down his spine as he began to stroke, imagining what it would feel like having Tony‚Äôs larger body pressed against his back, whispering sweet nothings and encouragements into his ear. He pictured feeling the hard muscles his mentor kept concealed beneath his thousand dollar suits and what it would be like to be the object of Tony Stark‚Äôs utmost attention, because keeping the attention of the genius was no easy feat.
‚ÄúKid, mirror,‚Äù Tony snapped, and Peter was hauling up him with inhuman strength, shouldering Tony‚Äôs weight as he half dragged his boss to the car he was lying a few feet from. He helped Tony sit in the driver‚Äôs seat and Tony snapped down the visor, sucking in a harsh breath at his reflection.
‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù agreed Peter, his long fingers splayed out across his knees, so eager to get on with it that it twisted Tony‚Äôs guts into knots and he felt as if he was suffering a bout of food poisoning.
‚ÄúWhoever it is, tell them to go away,‚Äù Tony said absently to his AI, focused on replacing the oil filter until the voice of his supposed visitor spoke, the tone scraping along Tony‚Äôs nerves and fueling a light wave of panic that bloomed in his chest. Nobody should be able to get into the garage or the lab when he was in lockdown mode. He knew FRIDAY wouldn‚Äôt permit anyone to enter that didn‚Äôt have an override.
Peter surveyed Tony‚Äôs face and it was impassive but he didn‚Äôt need his spider-senses to tell him whatever Tony was about to reveal wasn‚Äôt good stuff. If he was hiding it, from Miss Potts of all people, it definitely was bad business. Peter had come to be able to read Tony‚Äôs body language like a book after spending so much time at his side and knew Tony was the king of closing off all emotion, putting on and hiding behind the celebrity persona that Peter was slowly learning to hate.
The science behind it really was brilliant, if Tony himself had anything to say about it. He let Peter run with that since if anyone could really crack the code, it would be Peter. Tony was discovering more and more how multifaceted Peter was in his intelligence. Some part of him in the back of his brain even acknowledged with the right guidance and education, Peter would probably someday surpass him in that department.
Tony slipped his arm free, his heart racing like he‚Äôd run a mile on the treadmill. He didn‚Äôt even have a comeback for that, just stuttered a ‚Äúthanks for the chat,‚Äù and made like a banana and split. Vision just shook his fondly, watching as the billionaire bolted for the elevator and wondered how a genius could be so dense. Humans were truly interesting, mysterious creatures.
Tony pushed off the wall. He had the sudden craving for a shot or seventy of bourbon. He wasn‚Äôt going to go that route again, but in times of having to deal with emotions he‚Äôd rather not, he sure missed the burn of alcohol and the way warmth bloomed throughout your chest and you just stopped giving a shit about everything.
Peter nearly tripped over his Converse sheathed feet trying to get to the platter, and Tony had the fleeting thought that if DUM-E were human he‚Äôd have Peter‚Äôs grace. His enthusiasm was endearing and Tony caught himself smiling fondly. Peter returned with a plate heaped with still steaming pancakes, and the aroma permeated the air.
‚ÄúNo-no sir,‚Äù stammered Peter, shaking his head, ‚Äúyou have nothing to apologize to me for! You‚Äôve been great, amazing! Really sir, being able to come spend the weekends here is the only thing that gets me through the week at school.‚Äù
When Peter swung back through his window to his room in the Tower, it was well past 3 am. He said goodnight to Karen before pulling off the mask and placing it carefully on the comforter of the bed. For being surprising both light and tight, the suit peeled off quite easily, as if it had a non-stick Teflon coating on the inside. Knowing Tony, it probably did. He placed the suit delicately on a hanger in the closet and scurried across the room to the bathroom. Even 90 floors up, Peter was paranoid of someone seeing him naked save for a thong.
Tony leaned forward and physically clapped his hand over Peter‚Äôs mouth. Peter froze and his eyes went impossibly wide. Tony watched him intently for a moment before slowly removing his hand, settling back on his stool.
Tony took a deep breath and nodded. All Peter talked about was him? Yeah, the kid really did need a life. If Tony was the most interesting thing in his life, Peter was definitely doing something wrong‚Ä¶especially going around licking spoons like a god damn porn star, all in public too, little exhibitionist- TONY NO!
‚ÄúDo not disregard the boy. What you are told by society; disregard it. He‚Äôs the web that will weave you all together.‚Äù
Peter grinned at him sheepishly, making the dimple in his chin appear. Another one of those weird things that Tony‚Äôs brain cataloged for no apparent reason.
He could do it, he could hold it together. He was god damn Iron Man. Stark men are made of iron, right?
‚ÄúSure thing boss,‚Äù FRIDAY quipped and Peter followed Tony into the elevator, FRIDAY lifting them automatically to their destination.
The sadness in his eyes when they stepped out of the elevator onto the commons floor wasn‚Äôt something Tony couldn‚Äôt hide either as he swept around the room. The ghosts of his family that was now nothing but tattered shreds of misplaced anger and regret still haunted this place. This was only the second time since Siberia that he set foot on this floor. The first time was just after he was cleared to leave medical and he went into Steve‚Äôs abandoned room where it still smelled like Old Spice and clean soap, collapsed on the perfectly made bed and screamed into Steve‚Äôs pillows with so much anguish and rage he ripped the stitches open above his left eye.
‚ÄúI swear, Mr. Stark, not Ned, not Aunt May. Not even under torture, I swear I won‚Äôt tell a soul!‚Äù Peter assured in that mile a minute way of his, leaning forward slightly in his seat.
Peter was literally tickled pink, and they ate their breakfast, Tony declaring loudly to FRIDAY to note that Peter was now his most favorite and best Avenger when Peter passed him a whole thermos of freshly brewed coffee. Tony didn‚Äôt miss the way the kid‚Äôs eyes lit warm like the sunrise with every forkful Tony swallowed. That was something to think about.
Peter could feel his face heating up at the confession, but the small genuine smile that broke out over Tony‚Äôs face at his admission made the embarrassment totally worth it. Peter loved it when Tony smiled, real true smiles, and on his now younger face he could see how ladies had just dropped into his bed with just a look. He got distracted from that line of thought when Tony wrapped a hand around the back of his neck, squeezing lightly, and Peter hoped Tony wasn‚Äôt feeling the same heat on his skin that he was feeling. The skin beneath Tony‚Äôs work roughened hand suddenly felt like molten lava.
Vision let this hang in the air and Tony could not deny any of it. If it was Steve saying this, Tony would deflect, would go on defensive, would escalate the situation until they were both so incensed that they forgot they were discussing Tony‚Äôs inadequacies. There was something about Vision that wouldn‚Äôt allow Tony to be false beyond a practiced smile.
‚ÄúHoly tits on a goldfish, Parker, you scared the shit out of me!‚Äù Tony barked, instantly feeling terrible at the way Peter shrank back.
‚ÄúI think,‚Äù Peter said as he scrunched up his nose a little bit, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs a little more sea salt than I‚Äôd like.‚Äù
Sighing, he shoved himself up from bed and padded across carpet so lush his toes sank into it toward his massive walk-in closet for a shirt. If he was going to be awake, he might as well get some work done. He tugged a faded Metallica t-shirt over his head, realizing the irony of actually owning and wearing the same t-shirt when he was originally 21 the first time. Fucking magic.
Tony didn‚Äôt want to think about the implications of Vision‚Äôs words and how they paired with Strange‚Äôs weird warning, so he did the usual Tony thing and buried himself in his workshop, beginning a complicated project that would require all his attention so he could think of nothing else. He had FRIDAY blast loud rock music while he worked, his AI favoring his fashion choice of the day and choosing Metallica. Tony was half way through the Black album and hunched over a complicated schematic when a hand touched his shoulder. Tony just about jumped out of his skin, whirling around on his wheeled stool as FRIDAY lowered the music to more tolerable levels for human beings.
‚ÄúT‚ÄôChalla will be in contact,‚Äù Steve replied, and before he could take another breath the line went dead.
Fire shot through Peter‚Äôs veins and pooled in all the wrong (right) places. Alarms were going off in his head and he realized now what was going on.
Arms wrapped around him from behind as Bucky‚Äôs lean frame pressed against his back, holding on to him tightly as if he could keep Steve together.
‚ÄúNo, but thanks man. Go get some sleep, you have a flight in the morning to catch. I‚Äôll have it done before you leave.‚Äù
‚ÄúThere‚Äôs too much at stake for you to poison me now, Parker, do it for after we save the world,‚Äù Tony grunted, stuffing a large helping of pancake into his mouth.
‚ÄúKid, I got something to show you. I didn‚Äôt want Pep to see it; not today at least, after everything that already happened. Let‚Äôs go up in the common area; FRIDAY, if you‚Äôd please.‚Äù
The embarrassing article of ‚Äúclothing‚Äù was removed and put in the rucksack he used to transport his dirty clothes from the Tower back home. He refused to let anyone but himself do his laundry, not even May. FRIDAY, the lovely and intelligent AI that she was, already catalogued Peter‚Äôs preferences of the water pressure and temperature of the shower; it came to life automatically, as most things did in Stark Tower. Peter slid himself beneath the spray and sighed, trying to relax and let the adrenaline and exhilaration of being a superhero bleed out of his nervous system.
‚ÄúThanks, doll,‚Äù Tony said, shooting the waitress that million-dollar press smile that caused her to blush and rush hurriedly away. Tony turned and looked at his burger in what Peter could only describe as predatory and he wondered briefly at the feeling of jealousy toward the dead flesh of cow. He picked up his burger when Tony did and went to take a bite but his efforts were thwarted when Tony bit into his burger and let out a low groan of pleasure at the taste.
Tony simply snapped his glasses over his eyes and made the gesture that indicated ‚Äòafter you.‚Äô Peter slid from the booth with his shake, and as he headed for the door Tony reached in his jeans pocket and pulled out a small wad of bills. He tossed it on the table without caring to count it and followed the kid, resolutely looking everywhere but at the kid as they climbed back into the car as Happy held the door open for them.
While Tony and Pepper deliberated over SI business, Peter kept himself busy by starting his research into the anti-aging theory. When Tony finally got Pepper into the elevator and FRIDAY confirmed she was out of the building he found the kid surrounded by blue holographic screens displaying dense medical research and even one screen was displaying a liposuction procedure. Tony made a face at that and parted Peter‚Äôs screens.
Stephen simply twisted his fingers into what looked like a weird mudra to Tony and suddenly an image appeared before him. It was like a holographic that FRIDAY could produce but not brought about by scientific means. Again, Tony was reminded of how he wasn‚Äôt fond of magic and subtly flinched back.
Tony sat on the edge of the bed staring at it. An inconspicuous, completely outdated fossil of technology that was the one and only link to the person he didn‚Äôt know how to talk to anymore. Tony scoffed at it; a stupid AT&T flip phone. It was so Rogers. The man was so far removed from the world and instead of embracing Stark Technologies, he got with the times by getting a flip phone. Hell, the end table the phone was sitting on was worth more than that compact hunk of junk. Tony felt a rush of empathy for the components that made up the cell phone‚Äôs inner workings. They could‚Äôve been put to better use.
Steve lay dead at the monster‚Äôs feet, his shield shattered, the blue of his eyes muted in death but boring straight into Tony‚Äôs just as they had in Wanda‚Äôs vison. Something churned in Tony‚Äôs gut and he tore his eyes away from Steve‚Äôs; looking beyond the fallen Captain, he saw the War Machine armor was a mostly a mass of twisted and dented metal as if it were nothing more than crumpled up aluminum foil. Rhodey was dead and broken within. Bodies of deceased heroes littered the scene.
‚ÄúWhat looks good, kid?‚Äù Tony asked, and Peter lowered the menu enough to peer over the laminated sheet at Tony, who‚Äôd removed his glasses and some sort of amusement was glowing his eyes. Peter swallowed thickly and glanced back at the menu, registering pictures. He sighed to himself and lowered the menu with a half-smile.
‚ÄúYou certainly aren‚Äôt, and thank Thor for that,‚Äù commented Tony whole-heartedly before throwing back the rest of his coffee. He made to stand, but Vision reached out and gently laid a hand on his forearm.
‚ÄúCan‚Äôt say I‚Äôm pleased to make your acquaintance,‚Äù Tony snarked, eyeing the amulet suspiciously that hung from the man‚Äôs neck. His fingers twitched, knowing with the push of a button on his watch the suit would automatically wrap around his body for protection. He knew his baby girl was running the man‚Äôs name now and would compile the information for him to look through after this, well,
Tony took a breath to steady himself and stepped off the elevator when FRIDAY opened the doors. He clenched his fists at his sides and resolved not to look in direction of the couch, where just the other day he had nearly pulled Peter into his arms, awash with a fierce instinct to comfort and protect the boy after he watched himself die at Thanos‚Äô hand. If he looked, he‚Äôd remember falling into the way Peter‚Äôs eyes shone when he said he believed in Tony, how it made his new, young heart squeeze with pride. He‚Äôd feel the flex of toned muscle in Peter‚Äôs shoulders where his hands gripped the boy that night. And that sinful way the kid licked that milkshake spoon‚Ä¶
The best they could come up with for his now roguishly youthful face was he took an extended vacation and while on it, decided that staring 50 in the face was midlife crisis material and underwent an extensive plastic surgery that restored him to his former glory. It was Peter‚Äôs idea that said he decided to try an experimental trial of injecting his fat into the cells of his face that had enhanced collagen to revitalize the skin after the surgery.*
He and Tony hadn‚Äôt met before, but like anyone else, even before becoming Sorcerer Supreme, Strange knew of Stark. From what he‚Äôd seen of Tony from media in the past, he could see the toll the Accords and the Civil War between the Avengers had taken on the man. Tony would always look good, he was too blessed genetically, but the man had lost a good ten pounds. He had more wrinkles in his face and around his eyes than he had two months ago. Not having left his lab in weeks, more gray had streaked through his hair than he probably would‚Äôve normally allowed and his usually sharply groomed facial hair was getting out of control.
Peter caught his eye, and Tony was momentarily terrified the kid could tell what direction his thoughts had taken.
Peter watched the city go by out of the windows, sipping his shake. Tony pretended to be engrossed in his phone the whole way home, just one thing on his mind.
Peter smiled a small smile, ducking his head in embarrassment and pointed to the nearest work bench. Tony looked in the direction Peter indicated, noticing a large silver covered platter. His eyebrows nearly shot into his hairline.
Tony was fully unprepared for Peter to lean forward and capture the spoon between his lips, slowly pulling back from it, the ice cream having disappeared from the utensil and into his mouth while Tony was too busy staring at how Peter looked up at him from beneath his long, long eyelashes. Peter sat and innocently savored the treat in his mouth, looking thoughtful as the flavors burst across his tongue.
Tony was about to make a comment about magical blow up dolls but Strange interrupted him and stole his thunder.
‚ÄúSadly, no. You suffer a widow maker while they have you open on the table. Your heart has been through too much; resuscitation isn‚Äôt successful.‚Äù
Then Tony‚Äôs hand would go into his hair, tightening in his brown curls just enough to be on the right side of painful and jerk his head back. He‚Äôd tell him with grunt he was going to paint his pretty face, and Peter would have just enough time to snake his tongue out before warm ropes of cum splashed over his skin. Maybe Tony would even scrape some off his cheek and feed it to him‚Ä¶
‚ÄúUh, yeah, it‚Äôs me,‚Äù Tony answered. He sounded different. Steve could hear a softness there that was not usually associated with Tony Stark. From Steve‚Äôs knowledge, the only people who got that side of Tony were privileged few, and his heart wrenched with every beat that it was still there, even after he‚Äôd-
Tony made grabby hands at the plate and Peter passed it to him with a chuckle. He left and came back with another plate, this one laden with sausage and bacon, a little glass bowl of maple syrup, and a fork balanced on the side.
‚ÄúIt isn‚Äôt your fault, Vis. Anyone on this planet could hold that stone, it wouldn‚Äôt make it their fault either. He‚Äôs just a power-hungry tyrant, as all villains are, but we are going to put in him in his place. Strange gave me this do-over for a reason, and I‚Äôm going to make sure this world ends up on the winning side.‚Äù
‚ÄúSo, I made them with blueberries, well, because you are always eating blueberries, so I figured you‚Äôd appreciate them in pancakes.‚Äù
He let himself slump further down into the softness of the mountain of pillows spread at the head of the bed and contemplate life. In just one day his life totally tilted on its axis in a brand-new way and Tony never really did like surprises. What had happened to him in the last 24 hours somehow seemed more draining than having an absent and abusive father, years of being a playboy and drowning in alcoholism, Afghanistan, losing Pepper, his responsibilities as Tony Stark and Iron Man, and the fucking Accords and Siberia. He supposed if it was going to happen to anyone, it would happen to Tony Stark.
‚ÄúWhy? I‚Äôm absolutely lovely. Don‚Äôt say things like that Pep, you‚Äôll give Petey-pie the wrong impression of me,‚Äù Tony whined.
Tony‚Äôs legs that were more blackened with oil stains than the actual color of the denim fabric of his work jeans were all that were visible from under the Audi R8 Spyder. He‚Äôd purchased himself a new one after its predecessor had been blown to bits and buried at sea in Malibu. Tony was meticulous about regular maintenance on his babies, and thus was beneath the sleek car changing the oil.
, and Tony was obviously a pervert for thinking that Peter could‚Äôve known how downright sexual that move was he just did. A disgusting pervert for how it made heat flash down Tony‚Äôs body as his horrid brain replaced the spoon with his dick and Peter on his knees in front of him. He called up his best memory of Pepper saying, ‚Äú
Tony was used to people looking like they wanted to carve his eyes out with a plastic spork, so Strange‚Äôs look of murder at his comment bounced off him as if he was wearing the Iron Man suit.
Tony looked at Vision sharply, trying to dismantle what those words meant. Vision couldn‚Äôt possibly know about this weird, perverse train of thought Tony had been on surrounding Peter. The kid needed him to be a mentor. He didn‚Äôt need Tony trying to get in his pants‚Ä¶his delectably tight, ass hugging pants (TONY NO!). Being 21 again was fucking awesome but Peter still wasn‚Äôt the age of consent; the gap was still wide enough that Tony could go to jail in the state of New York.
Pepper was kneeling gracefully next to him, stroking his face, the corners of his eyes, and pushing back his hair that had fallen across his forehead.
So although he looked bored, he was actually watching Rhodey‚Äôs face as FRIDAY played back how Tony had been made young again and the horror of what Dr. Strange foretold of. Tony was able to pick up the marvel at Strange‚Äôs magic (ugh), the narrowing of eyes at the start of the story and the minute swallowing when seeing himself a twisted wreck of metal and deceased. When the show was over FRIDAY silently took away the projection and Tony watched Rhodey pace over to the window, the slight whir of the gears in the braces the only sound in the room. He scrubbed at his face as he looked out at some of the best views of Manhattan before turning to his friend.
However, whatever Strange was doing was rapidly draining his energy and Tony could feel his eyes growing heavy. It was almost like he‚Äôd been injected with a heavy sedative. He fought it although he knew he‚Äôd never win. Just before he drifted into unconsciousness he heard Strange‚Äôs voice echo through his mind.‚Äù
‚ÄúGreat!‚Äù Tony exclaimed, pushing himself up and away from Peter, who stood and followed Tony back to the elevator. The doors opened with a barely there ‚Äúshick‚Äù and they stepped inside.
Tony watched Peter‚Äôs face as it slowly morphed in horror, eyes pinned on his own lifeless form hanging in the alien monster‚Äôs hand. The brown orbs took in the deceased bodies of his fallen comrades and all the other dead heroes he had yet to even meet. His fingers gripped tightly around his knees until his knuckles turned white and his eyes snapped up to find Tony‚Äôs, full of panic and questions that even Tony probably didn‚Äôt have answers to. Tony didn‚Äôt like it at all; it hit him in the chest and curled tight beneath his sternum. He never wanted Peter to look at him like that ever again- large brown eyes nearly hopeless and filled with doubt.
‚ÄúI do require, however, an explanation of how you are suddenly sitting before me looking 30 years younger than when I saw you a week ago.‚Äù
The tentacles at his waist cinched tighter, and the one surrounding his cock pulled, lining him up. He couldn't help the jerk of his hips when the head of his cock brushed against Tony's skin. He was so warm, slick from the slippery tentacle that had been fucking into him for hours, but it made space for Steve now, pulling away so the smaller tendrils could guide Steve into Tony's heat. And Steve knew he wasn't going to be able to hold out much longer. The drug told him to thrust and drive and
Steve was still smiling. ‚ÄúI can never remember what fork I‚Äôm supposed to use either. Let‚Äôs eat all of dinner tonight with just our dessert spoons.‚Äù
Second last chapter! The epilogue will be posted next weekend. Thanks so much for reading along guys :D
Bucky‚Äôs brow twisted. ‚ÄúMaybe after it cools‚Ä¶?‚Äù Steve shot him a look. Neither of them believed that. ‚ÄúWe can trim the darkest bits off.‚Äù
Steve‚Äôs breath caught in his throat. ‚ÄúI - you - what? Why?‚Äù Had Tony finally figured out that Steve had been in love with him for upwards of six months now?
Tony sighed, but smiled, then pulled Steve down into his arms. He pressed a kiss to his forehead. ‚ÄúWell, I guess that‚Äôs alright then‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered. ‚ÄúAs long as I‚Äôm your Tony.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt really was.‚Äù Steve stood when Tony did, but before he could slip away, Steve hooked his elbow and pulled him into another hug, warm and tight.¬† ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about your friend who died.‚Äù Tony squeezed, burrowing into Steve and splaying his hands out flat on his back. They hung there, neither pulling away.
Tony drifted closer to the window, watching Hot Window Guy reorganize things. When the guy straightened up to wipe clean the chalkboard that listed the discounts, bright blue eyes flicked out the window and settled on Tony. Hot Window Guy smiled, waved, and Tony turned on his heel and marched off, mortified. His cheeks burned, despite the cool weather, and he kept up a speed-walk pace until he turned the corner and started up the next block. Fleeing was almost certainly more suspicious than just waving back, but Tony had reacted on instinct instead of logic.
That was enough to urge Steve into action, and he pushed Tony‚Äôs leg up higher and began fucking into him in earnest. The new angle meant Steve was pounding relentlessly against Tony‚Äôs prostate, and he instantly went from ‚Äúhorny and enjoying himself‚Äù to ‚Äúon the absolute edge of complete destruction.‚Äù Leather rubbed a rough patch over the inside of Tony‚Äôs thighs, and an endless stream of half-formed babble spilled out of Tony‚Äôs mouth. Steve surged up to capture it with his lips, devouring Tony with eager kiss after eager kiss.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what we do,‚Äù Steve whispers, under the jeers and catcalls of their whooping teammates, ‚Äúas long as we do it together.‚Äù

He thought about bumping the bottom of the mattress above him - not hard, just enough to pop the kid out of sleep - but immediately rolled his eyes at himself. He couldn‚Äôt do that. This kid was lucky to be insomnia free. Tony was just jealous.
"I‚Ä¶ don't know what that means," Steve laughed. "Don't be embarrassed though. It's really nice to have a regular. Gets lonely out there with all those people walking by. Seriously." He reached out and hooked a knuckle under Tony's chin, drawing his face up again. "Don't be embarrassed."
But Steve grit his teeth and balled his fists in his lap and forced himself not to break a table with Greg‚Äôs face. He didn‚Äôt know how to play this; Tony would.
Tony‚Äôs brow creased and he rocked back on his heels. ‚ÄúUnless - oh were you going to ask someone? You just said last week you were gonna go stag with Bucky and Peggy, and I thought maybe you wouldn‚Äôt mind. I‚Äôll split the money with you. It‚Äôs mostly just to see the look on their faces.‚Äù
Subject SR-616 is not responding to the AOGKR-5 as quickly or dramatically as TS-616. A second, larger dose has been administered. This is contrary to the dosage calculations performed by Outreach Team YYY-6. Note: Either a larger sample size is needed to study drug effects or subject SR-616 is an outlier.
The store was on day eight of a two-week sale on art supplies they‚Äôd labeled ‚ÄúTry Something New!‚Äù where a new art medium was deeply discounted each day. Normally, this would affect Tony not at all, since he couldn‚Äôt draw his way out of a paper bag, but he‚Äôd happened to walk past the window in the evening of day two and screeched to a stop.
There was so much he was willing to sacrifice to save his country, his world, but it was too much to ask this of him a second time.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the only way down, Iron Man!‚Äù he called back as he launched himself across the floor towards the window. He curled up into a ball as he collided with the glass and heard a cacophony of cursing flood the comms. Wind whistled past as he plummeted towards the ground, holding the shield underneath him to try and take some of the impact.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre shivering.‚Äù Steve pulled Tony even deeper into his hold, and the warmth flooded his veins like a shot of brandy.
Bucky stopped and stared up at the building in front of him. Huh. It really was a windmill. If someone were to say, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a mad genius who lives in a windmill,‚Äù your first thought would be that they were overreacting, but at least part of it seemed to be very true in this case. Bucky checked his notebook again. Stark was the name. Tony Stark.
His voice made Steve jump. Tony had known he was here all along. The open door started to take on a different flavour.
He stuck out his hand, and Tony shook it, warm and firm in his grip. Butterflies filled Tony‚Äôs stomach. ‚ÄúTony.‚Äù
Bucky startled up from where he'd been hunched over his laptop, poking at a journal article. He stared at his husband, perplexed. "What?"
The lab was dusty and decrepit. One wall had collapsed, machinery and supplies smashed across the floor among the brick dust. It looked like it had been partially destroyed and abandoned.
Tony sighed. "I miss the days when you could chuck him around like a football while he was sleeping and he wouldn't wake up."
Tony held up a shaky finger. ‚ÄúYeah, okay. Half an hour, forty if the roads are bad. Yup. Okay.‚Äù He hung up. ‚ÄúOh my god.‚Äù
Steve tapped his pen on the crossword in front of him, jiggling his leg in time with his taps. He glanced at the clock again. It was quarter after eight. Tony was supposed to pick him up for their da-
He peeked around the door frame and almost immediately, Tony‚Äôs eyes snapped up like they were magnetic and met his. There was a long moment where they just stared, then Tony said something to Clint and stepped away from the group, approaching Steve.
When the tentacles gave them a breath of space, Steve arched back and made the mistake of looking down. It was a mistake because the view immediately punched an orgasm out of him with no warning. He cried out, feeling like he'd been shot. Tony was still plugged by the tentacle stretching down his cock, come beading up around it as it rocked in and out, a thick trail dripping down onto Tony's stomach. As far as Steve could tell, Tony was coming near constantly now. And as Steve tumbled over the edge with him, he briefly considered the possibility that they would be stuck like this forever, until they passed out or died of heart attacks, caught in endless pleasure for eternity.
Boldly, he reached out and gave Tony's wrist a gentle squeeze. "I'm sorry. I've had a lot longer to adjust to the idea. I was a mess when the first one came back positive."
Bruce shrugged. ‚ÄúI think he went to get a drink? He said he‚Äôd give us privacy for a bit. We have some things to talk about.‚Äù
‚ÄúFantastic,‚Äù Tony growled back, and Steve suppressed a grin. The open car hood blocked Tony‚Äôs face from view, but Steve slipped his eyes shut and he could picture it perfectly: the tongue trapped tightly between his teeth, the twist to his brow, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, arms deep in the chest of the convertible.
But he didn‚Äôt want him for a bad reason. He was in love with the iron-clad engineer. The way his suit of armour worked, the amazing weapons he built, and his devotion to his inventions - the bad man loved them all. He was determined to make Tony his, no matter what it took.
‚ÄúIt will be. You‚Äôll see.‚Äù Bucky patted him on the shoulder then turned back to the bowl. ‚ÄúOkay. Read it out again.‚Äù

Steve sighed and rolled his eyes. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my boyfriend, Tony. Rhodey‚Äôs on keys, I sing, and you know Clint, of course. Bruce is our manager but he couldn‚Äôt make it today. Clint give you some of our tabs?‚Äù
Tony pulled them both into the penthouse then immediately took all his clothes off. Steve watched, helpless, as Tony gazed at himself in the mirror. His chest was smooth and perfect, no lines, no scars. Well -
‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I made you think you were crazy for seventy years,‚Äù Tony says, not sure what kind of Hallmark card this situation calls for.
‚ÄúFuck you,‚Äù Steve growled, struggling again, muscles clenching with each shock from the cuffs. He was drained, and the adrenaline that flushed through his veins was only serving to make him panic more, not giving him the strength to escape. He‚Äôd thought this base was mostly empty. If he‚Äôd known it was still in use, he would have called the rest of the team in. Steve squeezed his eyes shut as they pushed him in until his shoulders hit the back of the cryo tube. His heart was racing, breath coming in short gasps. He was going to lose everything again.
Tony‚Äôs not about to argue with the guy that knows his way around, so he lets himself be led. What he‚Äôd assumed was the end of the alley, actually isn‚Äôt, and Steve shows him how to shuffle around the end of the fence until they‚Äôre in a closed off area behind a boarded up shop.
Bucky was in the kitchen in nothing but his boxers, and Steve was already back in his shorts and t-shirt. Tony handed Steve the shoes. ‚ÄúFound these in the closet.‚Äù
Two weeks before his experiment was due to end, Steve hiked up the stairs to his usual spot to find that Tony was already there. It was a wet day, drizzly and chilly, and Tony was sitting on the top step, arms wrapped around his knees, bags in a halo around him, face tucked down and hidden behind his usual sunglasses. As Steve approached, he realized Tony was wet and shivering, hair plastered to his face in damp curls.
Clint scoffed. ‚ÄúCome on, Stark, are you high? There‚Äôs no way you can beat Steve. He‚Äôs chemically enhanced.‚Äù
"I think that's it for me." Tony grabbed his towel from the corner of the mats and wiped his face, hiding how heavily his chest was heaving. If Steve weren't an actual supersoldier, their sparring sessions would be giving Tony some sort of complex by now.
Everyone took a treat - cookies or candy or chocolate - and Tony watched, helplessly charmed, as Steve wrapped his lips around a bottle of bright purple soda and took a sip. ‚ÄúDelicious,‚Äù Steve said, turning his smile to Tony.
"Yes. It's fine. I'm not trying to cause trouble, I just really need to see Tony Stark, on a very urgent personal matter." Steve's anxiety ramped up and brought a wave of nausea with it. Great, he was going to puke in Tony Stark's lobby and still not get to talk to the damn man.
Steve marched into the arena to the jeers and cries of the blood-thirsty alien audience. Tony watched, stomach in knots, as Steve's powers were stripped away. He looks so small, so human, so vulnerable out there, and Tony rattled his chains, wishing he could take his place.
The tentacles managed to strip Steve bare, working down the last zipper and shifting his pants down over his hips. Apparently not wanting to risk Steve escaping if they bared any of his limbs, the creatures left his uniform hanging off his body, his chest bare, underwear torn and removed, pants down around his thighs.
We are forced to classify this planet as INCONCLUSIVE. It has been marked as a possible return for further testing, if funding allows.
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna go broke.‚Äù Steve shifted down between Tony‚Äôs legs until he was slumped, almost flat, his full tummy pressing against his waistband. He popped the button with a happy sigh.
‚ÄúI know. You‚Äôre very impressive and skilled and good hands and all that stuff,‚Äù Steve murmured against Tony‚Äôs lips.
His lips were bright red and wet, and he was grinning, eyes dancing. Tony clamped his legs together and slumped down on the bed, still shaking. His hole was wet with Steve‚Äôs spit, clenching around nothing as he floated through the aftershocks. ‚ÄúSteeeve,‚Äù he whined, fingers opening and closing helplessly.
With the gang all gathered together, they both carefully didn‚Äôt mention their fight, sticking to the topic at hand, but Steve could feel Tony‚Äôs words burning in the back of his mind. He cringed when he remembered the anger that had welled up within him. It wasn‚Äôt fair to take it out on Tony - Tony had no idea what the witch had shown Steve. And he‚Äôd have to tell him, eventually, but he didn‚Äôt want to. He knew how Tony would take it. That Steve wasn‚Äôt happy in his new life, Steve wanted to go back, to go home.
The two of them curled up in the corner on a bench and spoke quietly, heads together. Steve stepped out. There were three doors to his left, the bathroom, then Tony‚Äôs door on the other side, then Clint and Laura‚Äôs door at the end of the hall. Fury was asleep at the other end, in Lila‚Äôs room, and Lila was in with her parents.
‚ÄúTwo sugars,‚Äù Steve said, then he stilled, heart dropping down into his shoes. It took a moment for what he‚Äôd said to sink in, but he saw when it clicked and Tony looked up from his phone, brow twisted in confusion.
"So you'll give us a chance?" Tony asked, catching his lip between his teeth and biting down to hold back a sudden wave of anxiety.
‚ÄúI just left to go get the mail and I come back to find you‚Äôve turned our apartment into a strip club,‚Äù Steve said.
Tony nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. I always do. Still think it‚Äôs easier to have them shipped in by the crateful but‚Ä¶‚Äù
‚ÄúRight.‚Äù Steve nodded back then walked over to the counter, lifted the half-burnt, crooked monstrosity and tipped it in the trash.
Tony had also rented a limo, picking up Peggy and Bucky on the way, and Steve had to admit that part was fun. At the doors to the gymnasium, Tony paused and held his hand out, his eyes going soft and his smile wavering a bit. Steve looked down at his offered hand then slipped his own in it, wrapping his fingers around Tony‚Äôs. Tony‚Äôs hand was warm but not sweaty, and his fingers threaded perfectly in between Steve‚Äôs like they were puzzle pieces made to fit together.
‚ÄúI just suddenly realized‚Ä¶ I thought that was what I wanted, what he could provide for me, but when I had the chance to take it‚Ä¶ the only place I wanted to be was wherever you were.‚Äù
Tony sighed, more disappointed than he had any right to be. It was all for the best, really; he needed to start getting over this guy.
Tony shot him another look, the corner of his lip curling up in the hint of a smirk this time. ‚ÄúSure thing.‚Äù
Steve let go of Tony‚Äôs hand to bring his fingers to his chin, tip it up until their eyes met. ‚ÄúWe will be,‚Äù he said firmly, and something in Tony settled.
"Hoping to find someone to share the incredibly exorbitant fruit platter I'm guessing the airport hotel is going to send up when they realize I'm staying in one of their rooms tonight?"
The man shook his head, raising his hands. "No, it's fine. I'm fine. Just glad you've been reunited with it." There was something bright and interested shining in his eyes, and it made Tony take a step closer. Fuck but he was gorgeous.
It was weird light, actually, soft, as if it was a cloudy midday, but it was still early, too early for anything but harsh morning rays. Steve padded down the hall and pushed open Anthony‚Äôs door. He could see him clearly, on his back in the crib, holding a foot in each hand and wiggling them slowly back and forth. He turned at the noise, and grinned wide. ‚ÄúTeeeee,‚Äù he murmured, holding his arms out, but refusing to stand.
The shower, on the other hand‚Ä¶ Tony dropped his clothes in a haphazard path to the shower stalls at the back of the locker room. He was hard before he even turned on the water, remembering how many times Steve had pinned him to the mats with his ungodly thighs. This crush was getting slightly out of Tony's control. Steve would always be, first and foremost, Tony's friend and teammate, but the fact that he was also the focus of several frequent and intense fantasies involving candlelight, a fireplace, and a bear skin rug, made it hard to remember that sometimes.
‚ÄúSo, uh, who are you anyway? When I walked by I thought you were Al. He lives back here, doesn‚Äôt have anywhere else to go, you know? And people pick on him sometimes. But um‚Ä¶‚Äù Steve‚Äôs eyes flick down over Tony‚Äôs naked body then snap up to a spot about a mile and half over his shoulder. Steve clears his throat. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not Al.‚Äù
The song cut off abruptly; Tony‚Äôs hands stilled. They both sat in silence for a long time, unmoving. Finally, Tony whispered, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how it ends‚Ä¶‚Äù
? If Steve was into guys and into PDA, why hadn‚Äôt he chosen Tony? Tony was right there all along, waiting, hoping, but instead Steve had offered his heart to some rando he met at the grocery store, and the guy seemed inclined to take it.
Steve threw himself against the glass. He was desperate now, begging, sobbing, but he couldn‚Äôt summon any embarrassment. All he could think about was waking up with his whole life torn apart again. He couldn‚Äôt do it. He couldn‚Äôt. This would be the end of him. ‚ÄúNo!‚Äù He slammed his shoulder against the glass, but it didn‚Äôt even wobble under the assault. They would come. They had to come for him. Someone had to come for him. A frustrated tear tracked down his cheek as Strucker reached for the controls. ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Steve tried.
"You know, it never occurred to me that it would ever be a problem that we both work for the same University, that so many of our students are shared."
Tony worked his lip between his teeth. His eyes flicked away. ‚ÄúI guess that‚Äôs not a lie,‚Äù he muttered.
Steve's heart shot back out of his shoes in time to start pounding with fear. Tony had gone into the showers right after their sparring session, almost five hours ago. What if he was hurt or unconscious? And Steve had just been sitting around pinning like an idiot when Tony needed him?
"What?" Steve startled backwards and the puppy saw her chance. She leaped through the open door and landed square in the middle of Steve's chest, knocking him backwards in surprise. "What the -" He looked down at the puppy in his arms, then the staff fired again, the magic hitting Steve square in the face. There was a popping sound, then he landed on his suddenly much smaller butt in the hallway, the puppy in his arms.
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre doing great. Try going up a little higher so you don‚Äôt have to worry about buildings.‚Äù Tony‚Äôs voice was crisp and clear through the helmet speakers.
Steve smiled as warm as he could and opened his arms, drawing Tony in against his chest. He held him tightly, one hand coming up to cup the back of his head. "Don't worry, Tony, I always save the best one for you."
Ults Tony doesn't seem to have a canon bday so we went with his MCU bday. For Ant's bday, Steve and Tony used the doctor's judgment and picked a date they liked. Since he was frozen in time for four months, and then came back randomly as an eight/nine-month-old, there was no way to be sure, but it wouldn't be the same birthday as Tony's.
Huge thank you to thewaythatwerust for helping me dig my way out of this one and ashes0909 for beta.
Tony sat down opposite him and started to eat, even though all he wanted was a drink. Maybe Steve would start modelling behaviour. Maybe he was a terrible person to model off of. ‚ÄúSleep okay?‚Äù
to stop, to help Steve find a way out of here, but all he could do was shift and groan and beg and shake.
He swallowed harder and shifted up onto his elbow, driving down onto Steve like he was riding him, as if he was chasing his own orgasm instead of Steve‚Äôs. And Steve realized he kind of was. Tony was painfully hard-looking, and though neither of his hands moved to touch himself, he was thrusting more intently now, the wet patch spreading.
‚ÄúI remember Bucky,‚Äù Steve said, squinting off into the middle distance, his hands hooked around his microphone stand. ‚ÄúWe used to play capture the flag up and down the whole street.‚Äù
Tony blinked awake in the dark, not sure what had woken him. The room was dark and quiet, save for the glow of the arc reactor and the soft sigh of Steve‚Äôs breathing. Steve, thankfully, was asleep, but Tony was - Tony was
Tony padded across the room to the huge walk-in closet, and rustled around for something soft and cozy. He settled on Steve‚Äôs sweatpants and the unicorn sweater Clint bought for Bucky. He found Steve‚Äôs running shoes by the laundry pile, and he picked those up and took them with him on the way out to the living room.
They slammed together, the drug in Tony's veins singing again, cock hard and leaking where it was trapped between their stomachs. He jumped up to hook his legs around Steve's waist, and Steve set off, carrying him towards the elevators, mouths locked together. "We should tell the others‚Ä¶ possible alien invasion‚Ä¶" Steve muttered between kisses.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.
Steve whispered to him. He laid his enormous head in Tony‚Äôs lap and let Tony‚Äôs fingers curl around his ear.
Tony leaned in too, close enough that Steve could feel heat radiating off him. ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù He smiled again, and Steve‚Äôs heart skipped. ‚ÄúNeeds more red.‚Äù
‚ÄúHere.‚Äù Steve wriggled back up and brought a couch cushion with him. ‚ÄúI brought these over to pad between the dish boxes. We can sleep on these.‚Äù
Steve tried not to blush as he realized he had no idea what Bucky even liked to drink. "I'm with Bucky Barnes?" Steve tried.
He had one more hour with the man he loved. Steve huddled Tony close to him, face buried in his hair, as the snow and wind whipped around them, whistling through the trees, neither of them any warmer than the wilderness that surrounded them.
Steve gasped as Tony‚Äôs throat contracted around his cock again. He twitched but the tentacles wound around him prevented him from moving. It was almost a relief, now, because his self control was so dental floss thin that without the restraint he was worried he wouldn‚Äôt be able to stop himself from fucking down Tony‚Äôs throat.
‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm going to die of boredom before exposure,‚Äù Tony sighed, rolling from the moth-bitten couch onto the floor and letting himself flop there.

Steve was slick and hot and huge and every push deep inside Tony set off a new barrage of fireworks under his skin. As much as he wanted to watch, Tony‚Äôs eyes fell closed again as he arched back on the sheets, hips kicking up to meet Steve each time he bottomed out.
He paused outside the window and couldn‚Äôt help watching for a moment. This man - he didn‚Äôt even know his name. He looked at the chart a nurse had hurriedly scratched out, flipping to the second page. Steve Rogers.
‚ÄúYou saved me, I‚Äôm okay.‚Äù Tony burrowed into Steve‚Äôs neck. He was huge and warm and wrapped all around him, closer than the blanket. ‚ÄúMaybe next time we should use a codeword instead of you ripping my heart to shreds, though. Just a suggestion.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre trying to reassure me that I‚Äôm not an old, decrepit mess who no one could love, but all you‚Äôre actually doing is convincing me that I need to dress the armour up as Mary Poppins for Halloween.‚Äù
This was their favourite game, Steve taking his time, Tony begging for more, faster. Tony was pretty sure they had about an equal win-rate, and he was also pretty sure that he was a shoe-in tonight. He pulled out all the stops, moaning, gasping, rocking up to meet Steve‚Äôs shallow thrusts. And, sure enough, it wasn‚Äôt long before Steve‚Äôs hand clenched around Tony‚Äôs thigh and he pushed forward, sheathing himself fully inside Tony with a gasp.
Then he drew the lone man with intense eyes, gorgeous clothes and a working man's hands. Steve sketched the sharpness of his jaw, the clean edge of his beard, and the high-class cut of his suit. But he couldn't get the eyes quite right.
Steve brushes the hand from Tony‚Äôs jaw back into his hair, dislodging leaves and sticks which flutter to the ground. The other hand lands on Tony‚Äôs hip, drawing him forward, slotting their bodies together. Tony is strong, and steady, and wonderful in Steve‚Äôs arms, and what a waste it was not to realize this earlier, but also, what a blessing to have it now.
Tony yelled long enough that Bucky started yelling back and then Tony reached down and packed a snowball of his own, lobbing it across the lawn. Bucky dodged it, but it hit the side of the compound with explosive force. Tony had a good arm on him - two actually, Steve had seen him type, write, eat, and throw with both arms. And lo and behold, he had another snowball already, whipping it out before Bucky could get his balance again in the deep snow.
Steve‚Äôs fingers ran through Tony‚Äôs hair, and he whimpered and pushed into the touch. The stone floor was so cold and Steve was so warm. ‚ÄúI know.‚Äù
Steve struggled as hard as he could, feeling a bone pop in his wrist as he twisted against the cuffs, but they shocked him with every movement, and, eventually, fighting against the endless jolts of electricity sent Steve limp in his attackers‚Äô arms. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do this.‚Äù
He shouted and stomped and threw every plate from his cupboard on the floor until they were all smashed. Up on his screen, his secret cameras were supposed to show Tony admiring the watch, putting it on, hoping to find the one who‚Äôd sent it and thank them. But instead, he‚Äôd given the watch away, without even wrapping it around his wrist. The nerve!
They hit Anthony's room next, Anthony pressing his hand over his mouth and stage-whispering, "Shhhh," to both his parents. Tony looked at Steve and he shrugged. Apparently, this had become a stealth mission. Steve crept in behind his son, Tony's hand on his lower back. They found Anthony's Glow Duck - a large, plastic toy duck with a light inside. It burned through batteries at a shocking rate, but this time, Steve was grateful it didn't plug in. They also found Anthony's soft duck, his lion, and his skunk - all the current favourites. Anthony filled Steve's arms with everything then grabbed his blankie. They headed back to the living room, Tony walking behind Anthony so he could hold up the edge of his blankie and keep him from tripping, like a king with a servant to hold up his cloak.
‚ÄúNot telling.‚Äù Steve nuzzled into his neck. ‚ÄúI promise you‚Äôll like it. It‚Äôs just ten of us. Nothing big.‚Äù
Steve could see the moment it hit him, when the humour of earlier wore off in the face of suddenly aging thirty years in a single heartbeat. He could see the disappointment Tony tried to hide, the slight shake to his breath, the way his jaw clenched while he stared resolutely at his hands.
The smoke cleared, and at first Tony's heart stopped when Steve wasn't there. But then he saw him, curled up on the ground in an impossibly tiny ball. What had that spell done to him?
Tony continued his non-stop muttering, and Steve rolled away, as far as he could go, trapped under the sheets as he was, and pressed his pillow over his head. It didn‚Äôt help. He resigned himself to a sleepless night.
‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt ruin it!‚Äù Tony insisted. Steve‚Äôs hand was warm and comforting in his, and well, if he got a second date out of it, Tabitha Fortis‚Äô stupid hair didn‚Äôt seem quite so annoying anymore. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad you got to meet your Art Einstein, honestly. She seemed very cool.‚Äù
Soft, sleepy, porn, established relationship, minor uniform kink, Steve keeps the gloves on, clothes sharing
There was an intensity in his eyes that gave Steve pause, and he left his eyes trained on the man for a long time, trying to determine what the focus of his intent gaze was, but he found no answers. Steve's fingers itched to pull out his notebook and record the man's likeness, but in a place like this, "taking notes" wouldn't look too good.
‚ÄúYou are a good man, Anthony Stark. If nothing else proves it to you, let your guidance of Peter prove it to you. He comes to see me often, and all he ever talks about is you. He wants so badly to make you proud.‚Äù
Steve stood there silently for a few beats, listening to the silence on the other end of the phone, eyes unseeing the Wakandan scenery before him.
Peter smiled, glad Tony wasn‚Äôt touching anywhere on his body that would give away how his pulse was racing right now. He felt like his brain was short circuiting right now. Having Tony‚Äôs complete and intense attention on him like this overwhelming to say the least. He swallowed hard, willing his voice not to shake.
Steve snorted then reached out and wrapped his arm around Tony‚Äôs shoulders, tugging him in close. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare.‚Äù
The next morning, Steve woke before the sun, as he often did, and when he came downstairs for his breakfast, the kitchen was clean once more and the coffeemaker was back in once piece, gleaming and happy. There was a sticky note on it that read:
This. This was why he and Bucky used to go to the Stark Expo. This was what saving the future was all about. Utterly incredible.
He straightened his clothes and walked across the room then settled on his knees beside the bed. This was it - he‚Äôd finally have the love of his life all to himself!
He watched Tony spin Justine effortlessly around the dance floor, dodging her gown with grace. That had always been the difference between them, between him and Tony. Tony was graceful, suave, charismatic.
But when he took out his book and pressed pencil to paper, balconies and fire escapes weren't what flowed out of it; he drew faces. Thor, first, then Bucky, Sam, and Natasha up on stage.
‚ÄúCome on, Spidey,‚Äù Tony croaked, making grabby hands at Peter. ‚ÄúGet me to the lab. We‚Äôve got work to do.‚Äù
‚ÄúTony, I swear if you got drunk and this is another famous Stark hangover, I‚Äôm officially quitting. If you cannot take your health seriously and want to kill yourself, I can‚Äôt stand by and watch you do it,‚Äù Pepper threatened, although she couldn‚Äôt quite keep the shakiness out that Tony knew all too well was her holding back tears of anger.
‚ÄúUh, yeah, I-uh, just had a thought about the research is all,‚Äù Peter stammered and promptly shut himself up by taking a large bite of his burger.
‚ÄúFRIDAY, have like, 3 cases of water delivered to the lab. I feel like I swallowed the desert. Unfortunately, I do have experience with that, ah, watch the goods, kid!‚Äù Tony groaned when Peter shifted him a little too roughly.
‚ÄúI believe it was Mark Twain who said: Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don‚Äôt mind, it doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Vision supplied, his iridescent eyes watching Tony‚Äôs face.
‚ÄúTony?‚Äù he questioned finally, thinking maybe something happened to Tony and someone else had now acquired the phone. Something inside him twisted at the thought but he shoved it away, hearing the other person exhale.
Peter sat on the couch while Tony preferred to stand, eyeing Peter and for once choosing his words carefully.
Tony walked straight through the projection to Peter, taking a knee in front of the boy and placing his hands on both of Peter‚Äôs shoulders. Peter shuddered just slightly beneath his touch and Tony gripped just a bit harder, wanting to ground Peter with his presence and chase out the fear. This was so much, compiled with everything he already put the kid through; too much if he was being perfectly honest with himself, for a 15-year-old boy. It was selfish, and the guilt roiled in Tony‚Äôs heart.
‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt bite you,‚Äù FRIDAY snarked after he‚Äôd been sitting there for sometime, just trying to figure out how he was going to do this. He snatched it up, flipped it open with an eye roll at the absurdity of the action and hit the call button before he could chicken out of his big boy pants.
Tony shares with Peter what Dr. Strange showed him. They go out for burgers. Both realize something.
He stepped into the elevator and leaned against the cool railing, fishing his Stark Phone out of the pocket of the black cotton jogger pants he wore to bed.
‚ÄúPulse 88, temperature 100.5. He seems to be suffering from a great deal of dehydration, Miss Potts,‚Äù informed his AI. Ah, his baby girl. She was a beautiful work of artful engineering.
He held up a hand to stop Peter‚Äôs tirade, which surely would carry on for at least another ten minutes if Tony let it.
Tony sucked in a breath and nodded, hoping the kid was right to believe in him. He wasn‚Äôt feeling as confident as he led Peter to believe, but he meant every word he said. He‚Äôd go down trying to keep this world from burning.
In Tony‚Äôs mind, he could see Clint seated atop the back of the couch, screaming obscenities into a head set while he slaughtered online players in Call of Duty. Vison and Wanda would be huddled around the stove while she attempted to teach the android to cook. Natasha and Bruce were doing yoga poses that even Tony wouldn‚Äôt dare on mats near the western windows where the afternoon sun flooded in and bathed them in it‚Äôs warm light. Thor and Cap would be engaged in some silly challenge initiated by Thor, like arm wrestling, and Tony would be on a Stark Pad, bitching at the two of them not to break his house for the thousandth time just to have his eye twitch at the sound of splintering wood.
‚ÄúHmm‚Ä¶‚Äù Tony shifted in his seat, moving closer. He started folding up his woolies and setting them on his bag down in the footwell.
"Well then." Steve pushed up to his feet and held out a hand for Tony. "Let's see what this body can do."
Steve blinked awake. The bedroom was dark and quiet, the blackout tint on the window‚Äôs still activated, and he had that hazy, muffled feeling that told him he‚Äôd woken up too early. When he rolled over to check on his boyfriends, he realized why: the bed was empty.
At least one of them must have been about how to get out of handcuffs - surely? Tony rattled them against the pipe then stilled when it echoed around the space. There was no need to draw any attention to himself. But the shift reminded him that he had his phone in his back pocket, and his kidnappers apparently hadn‚Äôt found it.
Bucky counted to sixty in his head, wondering if it was a literal minute or if he was actually supposed to wait for someone to open the door. At fifty-six seconds, the door wrenched open to reveal a man holding a taxidermied fox.
Chapters 73-96, were written for the Steve Tony Games, and I was on Team Angst. Some of these have happy endings, some do not. They're mostly darker than what I normally write. I will put tags in the notes here on each one, but do be aware that angst was the primary motivation for these (and points :P) so they taste a little different from what I usually put up.

‚ÄúWait. Hottest guy?‚Äù Steve shot Tony an incredulous look as he dug out his books and slammed his locker shut.
Tony snorted. It was adorable, really, the way Steve managed to make ‚Äúare you avoiding me?‚Äù about worrying for Tony instead. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been avoiding you,‚Äù Tony said bluntly, because if he was going to go for this, he wasn‚Äôt going to waste time and nervous energy pussyfooting around.
Steve‚Äôs eyes dropped to the table along with his fork. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I forget, you know. That you‚Äôre not him. That‚Äôll you‚Äôll remember.‚Äù
‚ÄúAwesome. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù Tony turned and marched off down the alley, but Steve called after him, stilling him.
"Well, apparently, you're going to be on your ass for at least twenty-four hours, and the truth is, we don't know what the side effects will be like. So. I'm here to look after you."
A churning mix of four different kinds of guilt nodded Steve's head. "One song. And if we get arrested, you're never living it down, bud."
‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù Steve glued his eyes to the road. It hadn‚Äôt even crossed his mind before, but Tony‚Äôs flirting set a heat throbbing low in his gut. He‚Äôd been so focused on school and taking care of his ma, making time for a date hadn‚Äôt been a priority a long time. But Tony was hot, and kept shooting Steve flirty little smiles as they trundled along the road.
He frowned. The scent clung to the back of his throat and stayed there, making the gay, lively room suddenly feel cloying and oppressive. He eyed up a couple at a table to his left, their heads pressed close together as they talked. Steve couldn't help but wonder if the man had a wife waiting at home‚Ä¶ a kid‚Ä¶
