John nodded. "I'll be right there." The door was already closing, then Rosie's giggle again. John breathed deep again, feeling the tension but choosing this - home, his family, and the mindfulness of the evening in front of him. The smile didn’t quite reach his eyes, but it was a start.
"Get my nurse." Rather than question him as to why, he stands, spreads his arms as if asking the question with the gesture. Sherlock's words are clipped. "I'm tired. I'm getting back in bed. And you're leaving."
Rosie drops the cup again.
"This is nothing like what my coming home was supposed to be like."
"Why don't I get up, I'll have a shower. And then, I'll put the kettle on. We both probably need tea," John said as he wriggled his feet against Sherlock's, both of which were mildly warmer, "and we'll figure this out, yeah?" At Sherlock's discomfort, his silence, John lay still a moment. "Okay?" He nodded, and John somewhat reluctantly swung his legs out of bed.
"What's happening?" Sherlock asked later that night, after dinner. Rosie was long tucked in bed, and they were sharing the couch, watching a TV program, mindless entertainment.
"I was on scene, and they'd forwarded the texts. Your name came through." There was a moment of appreciation as Greg complimented him. "Nice job, by the way."
Her smile was genuinely kind this time. "But it gets a little dark sometimes before the dawn. These transitions are understandably hard. But you're doing well." A pat on the arm, a reassuring smile. "See you on Thursday."
Moments later, more customers came in, their tea and coffee emptied, Rosie got a little restless, and they exchanged more bland pleasantries, a quick farewell, and parted ways.
I will add, If you aren't feeling well, please stay away from people.
The man smiled, a warm and friendly smile that was heartfelt and wholly kind. He reached out a hand toward Sameer to shake it, and unleashed a few sentences in Dari. Sameer listened, enrapt, his smile also broad. He spoke so quickly that John of course didn't recognise a single syllable, but Sameer was enthralled. The man chuckled then, and gave a quick nod at John and Sherlock then addressed Sameer. "Your English is probably better than mine," the man said, teasingly.
"No. Coming back here. Thought you might need your beauty sleep." A wrinkle appears over his nose, then changes into laugh lines at his eyes and mouth as he adds, "I see it didn't help," and he meets John's questioning gaze. "And I did make you a promise."
"Even though he started it? And he shoved me first?"
Ella leaned forward. "Are you a little jealous of him?" Sharply, John looked up at her, a little alarmed, a little confused. "That his struggles are over?"
"No," growled the lump in the bed.
Indeed.
"No, I know that. But this will not interfere with your life. Your lifestyle. Your livelihood."
"Kandahar."
have been flirting, or being interested, but thought that perhaps it had been Sherlock's misguided social cues, his somewhat strange attempt at trying to be gentle before breaking bad news to him. The disorientation of the strange situation, the fact that he was apparently unwanted in Sherlock's bed ...
Rosie snuffles in the metal, industrial hospital cot, where she is resting but less restless against the pale pillow. Her favourite stuffed animal peeks out from under her arm with the IV in it. It strikes John
Sherlock had been called to a crime scene to help sort out the details, the note, the confusion, and the strange evidence left behind. Although the specifics were yet to be fully known, there had been substances, a suicide pact, a history of depression, and isolation. The couple had left a cryptic note and it would be up to DI Lestrade to follow up on. But the despair, the high-risk behaviour, that had been apparent.
"Don't pull. And you’re catching your IV site." Warm fingers not his own pressed down on his wrist. "You're okay." The hand was warm on his arm but felt oddly distant, as if it didn't belong to him. "Deep breath." He attempted to comply, then again tried to twist his head away, trying to dislodge the device under his nose. John's voice, "Open your eyes. Test's all done now." The plastic piece in his nose was reseated, and there was a pat on his shoulder, followed by John's voice again. "I see you frowning, know you're awake. Sort of." There was another wave, a drifting, and heaviness settled back over him and the fingers on his wrist disappeared. "Whatever, resting is good too," came the muttering near him.
"Week or so," Sherlock breathed quietly, his eyes a little glassy. "Maybe longer. Off and on." Pausing a moment to glance at John, who met his gaze, he amended his statement. "Mostly on."
There are names on the wall, some photos, a few tables with tasteful tributes, flowers, and frames to sign or write a memory on.
"I'm all for it."
John's quick words sliced into the argument. "Enough."
"What were you saying about me and deductive reasoning?" Smirking, Sherlock kept the pads of his fingers over John's pulse. "Try again with this wrist." John held out his other arm but Sherlock didn't move.
"Don't be thinking that you have the market on bad days." Sherlock's gaze sharply cut to John, disbelieving and annoyed. John only smiled as he tilted his head. "I'm not saying your day - okay, or days weren't extremely hard. But ..."
"It's not your decision to make." Mycroft's tone wasn't much better.
Sameer came over at one point to where all the adults were seated with them with the oldest child of the visiting family along. To Mycroft, Sameer said, "He wants to know if you have any pets."
"No one will miss me, in fact, getting me out of the picture will make things much better for almost everyone."
Most of you already know me, but for those who don't, I'm Rosie, Sam's annoying little sister. Or fabulous, wonderful, amazing, brilliant little sister, depending. I'm mostly okay with either description.
"I know. Just --" Sherlock begins and then changes his mind. His frustration, annoyance, and ... something close to despair is apparent.
The piece is titled Survival Mode for a reason. Survival mode:  short term, fear-based mode of thinking triggered by perceived danger. A fight-or-flight mentality that leads to
In response, she'd burbled something back.
From across the room, Sherlock managed to utter a few words-turned growl followed by a ridiculous, exaggerated cough. John was fairly certain the words he'd managed to keep unintelligible from the children sounded like 'good lord.' He didn't disagree.
Shamelessly, John took advantage of Sherlock's shortness of breath and turned his back while he'd spoken to the dispatch, explained the symptoms, given their address.
Seeing someone else standing there, casually lighting a cigarette, was completely unexpected, and John tensed, hissed out an expletive, then demanded with a growl, “Who the fuck are you?”
"I thought it needed it. The coat."
In a few moments, having watched Sherlock breathe, settle, rest, John reached for the water bottle, tucked a straw into it. "Here, a few swallows of water." He let a finger slide along Sherlock's face near his mouth, cuing. "You can open for the straw," he whispered as Sherlock took a few long pulls at the water. "I'll be fetching something from the kitchen. While I'm gone, deep breaths. In for the slow count of two, exhale for three. Try to keep your eyes closed." He offered the straw again, and there was another pull. "Good, just relax. Deep breaths."
"Friends?"
One final note: Any romantic involvement between the two of you is considered outside the scope of this contract and, while it may be ill-advised, it is not specifically prohibited. Although I would personally caution you to think quite carefully before becoming sentimental regarding him or allowing him to develop feeling for you. Trust me on this - I have known him much longer than you and urge you to have a care for his heart.
A short time later, he is brought to the room. An ultrasound technician is just finishing up, wiping down her equipment and working at the console.
The water glass makes a dull sound as he sets it down, then stands casually at the front, his eyes are bright, hair carefully combed. "Thanks Mike.
John stared, briefly, wondering to himself at what point mercy would give way to retaliation.
I vividly remember being in the hallway outside one of the Covid units, texting Sherlock with my mobile in a plastic bag, just checking in, I don't recall the message. Nor does it matter.
John knew they'd probably seen it all and had to ask. "No. Flatmate."
"You know what I mean. We were ... lucky this time."
"We've a long few days ahead." John at least knows the theme is going to be all focused on getting out of the hospital as early as possible, damn the consequences.
"She needs to check, Sherlock."
"I know."
. Thin, dry, scaly, weak." He angled both calves, considering the asymmetry. "Pale."
." The fact that John did sometimes seem to have to parent three children was not lost on him, again - some days it was worse than others - but Sherlock was by far the most skilled at pushing his buttons, getting a rise out of him, and occasionally being too cute and clever to reprimand too severely. Although Rosie and Sameer mostly wanted to do the right thing, to please John, Sherlock on the other hand, enjoyed being blatantly defiant some of the time.
Mycroft watched him carefully as he nodded, letting his eyes drift closed in docile acquiescence, but he wasn't buying the subdued demeanor one iota.
"It was as they were getting ready to start the procedure, you were really fighting the sedation, so I mentioned that as a ... distraction."
"No one ever does."
John blinked, sipped at his coffee, wondering and hoping Sherlock would explain himself.
Sherlock frowned then. "I'm not sure that's ..." he began but stopped immediately when John drastically increased the pressure on his foot again and silenced him with a warning look.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I've reconsidered," the man spoke, dully. He pressed up on his elbows, lifting his chest off the floor, though the rest of him was immobilised by a few branches, including the one that was impaling the back of his calf.
going on holiday? You tried to deceive me into cooperating."
"Learning to blend in is also a skill." Stan shook his head briefly, and moved on to the point of why he was there. "If you're interested, I would recommend getting into a couple elective courses. Foundational criminology, forensics, just to see what's out there. It's not a direct start to constable, but the City has some options for you. I recommend it, particularly if you'd like an accelerated career path. Possibly an internship." He handed him a business card. "My direct contact information. And I'll be in touch."
This first night in, they left the activities up to Rosie, whose simple list included watch Princess Bride, build a blanket fort, and eat popcorn.
John blinks, hearing the words, realising that this is a medical update, personally relevant. This is
There was the milestone of medication adjustments as one finishes, and then another. Current recommendations, thankfully, do not indicate lifelong continuation except for the low strength aspirin. And if John is grateful, Sherlock is
"And that's just at school. Because unfortunately, you're in a bit of trouble here at home too."
"Well you're off to a commendable start, warming the lube up in your pocket ... for my comfort."
- access to all chauffeur services, twenty-four/seven, with expected trips to be made primarily to my estate outside Northern London (while my other residence is being repaired), Barts Medical School, and the physiotherapy rehab center on behalf of my brother as he is treated for his injuries, said treatment will be attended by both of them as long as Sherlock's physicians indicate necessary.
"Let's go home instead."
"We could have asked --"
"Believe me when I say that there is no finer man on the force than DI Gregory Lestrade." Greg is seated nearby, facing the room. "You will be missed. Thanks for your many years of service.
With a flair, John signed both pieces of paper that were on the table, and handed them to Sam, who tucked them into his backpack.
"Tomorrow then?"
"Oh hush."
Although John's eyes are on the physician, waiting, he feels Sherlock's fingers seek and creep into his own as they rest on the siderail of the bed. Their fingers, with a small amount of desperation,
John sighed, smiled, and then without a word, nodded at her. What he wanted, though, was to hug her for the effort.
"You're not even a real doctor," Sherlock protested, skeptically.
(See the end of the chapter for
Gazing steadily, Ella smiled warmly, and her eyes conveyed trust and confidence, reflecting how much progress the man opposite her had made. "I do. But the rest, the other issues, are going to have to be up to you." She eyed the papers in front of her and gave him a hopeful smile. "We should keep moving, then. As you said at the beginning, you have a job interview later today. Let's be sure you're there on time."
He furrows his eyebrows, stretches, and coughs. "Are you sure it's not going to bother her? Me, here."
The nurse disconnects, and Marjorie waits just a bit, still watching the chambers, valves, contractility with the scope still down in Sherlock's oesophagus. John has subconsciously stepped forward, closer, and studies Sherlock's face.
"Chest, ribs. Calf - lower leg was bad the other day. And the back of my elbow."
). "Those other body fluids, no thank you."
"Wow," he breathed, as the other man came up to the window next to him, witnessing the damage outside. "We should --" He was about to comment that they should seek shelter away from the windows and had actually taken a few steps toward safety, when suddenly there was another strike right outside the window, the area fully lit up by the blue light of electricity, followed by the immediate sounds of another tree decimated by the storm, the ground shaking and trembling ominously. John's feet were already on the move in the opposite direction when the ceiling gave way under the force of the tree falling on that corner of the house. It all happened so fast.
"It's only one more night. And then you'll be free." John spoke the words out loud, meaning them as much for the nurse as for Sherlock.
John could almost feel the eye-roll. "Didn't he give you some warning about family issues? Must be slipping." He tipped his head back, closed his eyes (missing John's nod of recollection), but his features were still quite awake, tense. "I'm not exactly welcome."
Until his brain engaged,
He was huddled under his covers, the occasional rattle and flash that flickered from outside gave John plenty of light to see by.
"Yes." John launched just barely one sentence of a report that began with 'forty-two year old male in otherwise good health with new onset palpitations and shortness of breath.'
"Or that replenishes itself. Grows."
"You need help."
"That's fine." It really isn't, John thinks, crossing to Sherlock's side. There really isn't anything different about how he looks, other than the fact that the breathing tube is on the opposite corner of his mouth. The equipment, the infusion, everything else looks as it had when he'd left.
"You were watching for me." He looks down, sees John's shoes. "You were actually going to come out and find me. You want more tea."
[While my mum would never understand my fanfic involvement, there's a little post-script to this chapter:  rest in peace mum, remember that you were so very loved even though I hadn't seen you for eight long weeks. And damn you, coronavirus: I despise you so much.]
"Oh for god's sake," John muttered, taking a closer view of his face as he brushed some of the debris back in order to see clearly. "What hurts?"
"You know this is not your problem to solve directly. This is Sherlock's."
Conversation is benign for a few minutes, Greg looking at them intently while Rosie chatters on, showing them some various things that were somehow relevant to her day. John laughs at her antics, tells her he misses her, makes faces that make her giggle. He plays peekaboo with her, just once, which she finds hysterical but Sherlock does not, and he reaches up to grab John's hands away with an admonition to stop being ridiculous.
Home is Baker Street, I suppose, but home even more importantly is with Sherlock and Rosie. The two of them are ... adorable together and in all likelihood the best things that have ever happened to me. It feels ... right and complete.
else." Sherlock shuddered and muttered rather viciously,
"Mycroft, I swear --" Sherlock sneered at his brother. "No one's even here yet, just your hired help and your office minions and --"
"Squad called in." One of the nurses had taken the call, and spoke to the A&E physician, Dr. Franco, as they finished up from the continuous cycle of treat and street with the occasional arrest, admit, or pronounce thrown in for good measure. "Thirty something male. Collapsed near Euston Square station."
John could almost feel his eyes misting just a little, the sound of the words together, the choice behind it, the meaning and belonging. He was slightly glad Sherlock had not accompanied them, because he would have noticed that transient display of emotion and mocked him mercilessly for it (later, he hoped). "I like that a lot too. And keeping, even having three names isn't uncommon here." Sameer -
"Then I might know a thing or two about that particular warehouse job." Greg couldn't stop the faint pride at what the man had said. "They never figured it out, eh?"
"I think I'm ..." The foot pumps are removed, slippers placed, the long oxygen tubing he just assures will reach across the room unencumbered, and he straightens his tee shirt, re-ties the pyjama drawstring before taking care of the IV pump. "Got it."
"Oh, I don't think --" he tried to say.
-- John
needed to share it with you.
"Right. It's taking care of Rosie. And not minding when I need some quiet. And to have a shower immediately upon coming home." John gestured over his shoulder, at the building, at where he'd left Dan with the aides again. "You don't go through this, make a huge career change, stare death in the eyes, and somehow manage to cheat it" and at this moment, they both hesitated as John's words became living, applicable, and a little personal, "and not come out the other side a changed man." They began walking, knowing eventually they would hail a cab, but for the moment, at least moving away from this place was needed, together.
A pair of muted blue and green plaid pair of sleep pants is in front of him, along with an oversized tee shirt. "It's not ideal, but it'll help." Sherlock's expression turns annoyed. "What? What's the matter?"
"Dr. Richards will be back in to talk with him. With you. Might need to have the conversation again, you and he, later on."
"Okay. Good." She adjusted the patient gown then, straightening it, her manner conveying her appreciation for John's presence, his unrushed words. "Thanks for your help, earlier." They'd been in contact, an update about the deterioration, a request for medication in case the patient's respiratory status became more laboured, to ensure that there would be no struggling, and then later, the phone call noting no breathing, no pulse along with the request for him to come pronounce the patient. She smiled again, shrugged, tucking the sheet up along the patient and laying her still, pale-white hands together, reverently, neatly, across the stomach. "Hands tell quite a story, don't they?"
"You hear me?" John says, keeping his voice calm. "Nod your head yes."
It's very stressful coming home, and as John mentioned, the emotional exhaustion is real. The knowledge that despite everything, by the time the patient is on the ventilator, the odds are very much stacked against survival, is just so sobering. And the isolation - protective gear as well as no family presence - is stressful. As much as he can, John is still going to social distance even at home, keeping the exposures to as low a risk as possible. Some providers are getting hotel rooms or staying somewhere else, or have sent their families somewhere else if that's reasonable.
"That's fantastic!" Sherlock told her, his attention firmly on her, a brow raised when she looked away. "Are you disappointed?"
His report, along with photos, observations, and times were passed along to his supervisor. He was thanked and, according to the plan, dismissed. It occurred to him that he'd worked himself right out of a job. Part of it, the undercover assignment part, he had really liked.
"One day you'll learn."
Tears spilled over and down Rosie's cheeks, and John brought his hands to cup Rosie's face gently, wiping at the tears with his thumbs. "I'm going to miss her," Rosie moaned, her voice warbly and young.
"Not good news, I take it."
"Thanks for coming. And thanks for inviting me to the retirement party.
He couldn't get the words, the thoughts, the news out of his mind. There'd been a text message, a group text, sent by a former army buddy. It was meant to be benign, informative, an FYI type of thing. Probably for everyone else, it was exactly that. The sad breaking of news.
"He didn't need to."
John knows this is mostly true, but he has been quite vigilant in keeping his complaints to himself. "I haven't said ..."
John hedged, the room light enough to make out Sherlock's gaze, his eyes open, blinking, the silhouette of his head against the pillow. "Have you been awake long, wondering about this?" It seemed to John an odd thing to be focused on. "Because going on holiday sounds ... nice, actually, if it's something you'd like."
A few seconds, lingering, waiting, then he nods again, forwards another slide, more data. Totals in their hospital. Trends of new cases, community and facility spread, he highlights quickly and tells the story without getting bogged down. He doesn't read anything on the slides verbatim, but highlights their survival rates, their extubation rates, their length of stay, and their days since the last positive coronavirus patient. They are all well aware that for healthcare all over the world, there is a
"I can see you're worried about me robbing you blind while you sleep." With an arched eye, he looked around, shaking his head barely as if finding the entire place wanting. "Despite what you seem to remember from before, I have no intention."
"I did not."
"Of course I would. It's natural now. Everyone who is honest would agree that they are a little worried." Their hands touched, met, and Sherlock's long fingers intertwined with John's cooler ones. "Thanks for trusting me. It'll be all right."
Steady steps ascended the steps. Rosie was down for her nap and John had just straightened up, was enjoying the stillness and order of the flat. Knuckles tapped on the door, quietly, but John had already moved to answer it before there was more noise and the chance of disrupting the sleeping toddler.
It was a surgical headpiece, a fabric cap that tied at the nape of the neck. The cloth, skull and crossbones in a very discreet and somehow tasteful pattern. He toyed with asking for a second for Sherlock but didn't, knowing that he would never in a million years wear something that had the potential to muss his hair. His glorious hair, he admitted to himself as Molly cautioned him, "Just don't wear it until after tomorrow. That's the first donation, going up first thing in the morning."
"Oh trust me, make no mistake, I'm ready for home now."
"You've been avoiding me."
No response.
"That's because, even after all these years, and being together in every way possible, you're still, unfortunately an idiot." With a typical, embellished dramatic spin, he grabbed his coat and strode from the flat, leaving the door wide.
"Does it make you sad, remembering your mama?"
He nods, watches as she removes the wrist restraints completely and the respiratory therapist binds up the ventilator tubing, stows it into the corner of the room. Although John understands the need to keep it close in the initial time period after extubation, in case it is needed again, he finds the machine's presence a little ominous. There is another pass of the suction device in Sherlock's mouth, followed by a mint-flavoured toothbrush/swab, and then Dawn stands back. She waits, eyeing his chest, the monitor, the little puffs of mist that disappear when Sherlock inhales. She watches with enough intensity that John studies her and then Sherlock, trying to figure out what she is tuned into.
It was worst, I think, for the nurses who had to video call (zoom, facetime, whatever) with families before the breathing tubes went in, those breathy and winded words, sometimes interspersed with them giggling or shallowness when we as providers knew it was goodbye. We knew, and they didn't. We offered hope when there wasn't much. The lying has taken a toll.
"I left a message, but I believe someone had reached --"
Little bit of a future time slide in the beginning, but don't worry, hardly a spoiler, and then the story picks right back up in the thickest part of the storm. I just needed that little touch of comfort.
"Watch the teeth," John cautioned.
(See the end of the chapter for
"This is me
Sherlock rounded the corner from the kitchen, shaking his head. He looked fairly tired, himself, as he watched John's efforts, listened to him interact with his daughter. "Hey you," he crooned into Rosie's cheek, "it's okay. You're all right. Bit of a bump, but you're in one piece. No harm done."
Things could have been so different. I wouldn't be here typing into an online journal by myself for starters. But ... I didn't, and he didn't. And these are my choices. (and what was I thinking, considering inviting him along to something like this? He would have been an absolute nightmare in a room of strangers, honestly)
"Good. I'm here. We'll get through this." John keeps holding one of Sherlock's hands, takes his other, brushes at Sherlock's face, by his temple. Pale eyes continue to stare into John's. There is focus, recognition. Inwardly, John can feel nothing but relief, the worry somewhat squelched, suppressed, and now that he is awake, the relief is enormous. "You're all right. I'll explain everything soon." His words just keep flowing, slowly, calmly, quietly, and he is vaguely aware that the sedation is finally put on standby. Sherlock's fingers are firm, clinging, holding fast to John's hand. "Just breathe." Jack comes in and out, evaluating from time to time. John is afraid to turn even one moment of his focus, his concentration, off Sherlock to talk with him much.
Molly patted John's arm. "We're fine. And yes of course. But it shan't be necessary."
Of assurance - I'll take care of everyone, of Rosie and the kids.
A few minutes later, the cake was mostly gone and enjoyed by them all, and Rosie had opened gifts - a new mobile from John and Sherlock, a necklace from Molly, a set of coloured pens and a journal from Mycroft.
"You know, that last day. He was here; he was gone. I felt the exact moment ..."
Sherlock raises his head with interest at that as well.
"Fine."
Chemo brain - also, a somewhat frequent complaint that some chemotherapy medications, used to treat certain types of cancer, are somewhat dulling to memory and thought processes.
John watched Sherlock's silhouette, which didn't change. He felt compelled to at least be polite. "Okay, thanks."
"What is this?" he said, lifting it with his elegant fingers until he very quickly figured it out.
"I know. I'm sorry."
With a tug at her bathrobe, she raised her chin as she stepped away a little. "Aren't you going to get married?"
"Here's the form to indicate where to send your pension checks. Sign here on this honourable medical discharge form."
Their eyes locked, Mycroft standing with his shoulders back slightly, looking down his nose at Sherlock, whose chin raised a little at the consideration. "Well, usually. You're not so clever tonight."
"Until the present day, I'm sure," John added, unable to keep quiet.
Sherlock thumbs through the small pile of mail, extracts an envelope, and flicks it closer to John with a bit of a dramatic flair. "Stop worrying. It's a good thing."
"No." The surgeon offered a brief touch, his hand resting on John's unaffected, uninjured arm and he clearly would be moving along. Except that John spoke again. "Hey. Do a good job?" The man hesitated then smiled warmly as he nodded, and with a grimace John added, "It's just, I'm their doc. They'll be needing me."
"Count on it." Greg sits quietly while Molly offers a few sentences about Rosie's day, that they're doing well, then gets up to tend to the rest of the evening activities. Greg turns back to the screen. With a smile and a nod, he points a finger at them, waggling it slightly. "I think it's great, you know. And it's about bloody time, you two."
"Yes." The intercom buzzes again, and John holds his breath a little as he gathers that it's not going too well inside the procedure room. "Right, I'll call blood bank." The technician makes a shooing gesture and dismisses John as he picks up the telephone. "I need that unit of A neg, rapid release for Holmes, in IR room one." A pause. "Right. Courier it over stat, I have no one to send."
A few eyes turned toward them as they entered, and immediately John could tell that something had gone on, that there had been some drama or event there that they had missed. Damage control, then. One of the officers looked at him with a faint amount of reproach, as if John could ever truly wrangle Sherlock into changed behaviour or into doing something he didn't want to.
Sherlock connected the dots and provided the solution. "Stroke risk," he offered.
"Oh, I don't think so." She speaks slowly as she looks with a small amount of alarm at John, who looks back at her with the same concern. "I think it's going to be a few days, actually, so that --"
"Well, actually there are some things you can control. Is now a bad time to mention that you have smoked your last cigarette ever?"
The nod is stronger, more agreement. Sherlock's eyes open, and he blinks, then his pale eyes stutter about. He gazes from one side of the bed to the other, finally settle and stay on John. His pale eyes are foggy, but open and tracking him.
The fact that Sherlock didn't pull away, that he didn't resist or insist he was fine, that he permitted John's touch, his monitoring, was completely uncharacteristic. He himself was worried. And in that, John found
"You realise that was based on history, right. That actually happened. History came first, and then the musical?"
When one of them hurt, the rest shared it, lightened the load. When they left the base on a mission or an errand or a project, the rest had their backs. And deep down, they knew it was a special thing, an unusual pleasure, to be savoured and protected. They also knew but didn't acknowledge that it would not be forever. One of them would get shipped home, or transferred, or promoted. But while they had it, it was a very good thing.
Alive.
By this point, John has Rosie unbuckled and is holding her, trying to gauge her reactions. He slides into the chair by Sherlock's bed and Rosie is immediately scrambling off. And trying to climb determinedly onto Sherlock's bed, patting it and bouncing, clearly communicating that she wants to be UP! The smile Sherlock bestows on her is warm and sweet, and he reaches to assist her, with John's help, on climbing all the way up. She crawls toward his face, knee in the gut, the other knee too close for comfort on an even more sensitive area. Her hand reaches toward the oxygen tubing on his face. She has every intention of pulling it off and remains focused on that until John realises that he is losing the battle and sounds a retreat, pulling her back onto his own lap.
John watched them go. "Thanks for seeing us."
"I'm taking it easy on you. Out of pity."
Sherlock's arms come around him, easily, slowly, naturally as they lie together in bed a few days later. He can feel relief, senses the sweat cooling on his skin, the elevated heart rate sliding back down to normal ranges, the faint tremor of John's chest as he sighs, also in relief. The physician preferred that they stay overnight, and so they’d done so, for which John is grateful, because Rosie within a few days had been back to her normal, sweet, healthy self.
Sherlock smiled a bit, the frown between his eyebrows flickering like a beacon. Off. On. Off. On. Waiting until Sherlock's exhale seemed a little more full, John could see the very moment that he figured it out and was ready for more, and let the blanket roll gradually down onto Sherlock's legs, slowly, a sensual pace, settling over shins, knees, stopping at mid-thigh. He folded the blanket then, letting it be doubled over areas already covered, while he used a nearby towel to quickly wipe off body fluids that were already growing sticky. Once he knew the blanket would be safe, he moved it again, slowly, taking his time, until it was up and over Sherlock's waist, covering his hands where they rested.
By all means, grab the extra long charging cable if you're headed to the hospital. Outlets are almost never convenient, although newer patient beds have a USB port built right into the siderail.
"Oh dear lord. Of course I do, I'm not an idiot like ..."
Pounds, stone, kilograms - whatever. Obviously 19 stone would be a ridiculous weight gain so I compromised. Please don't let the detail distract you.
Everyone's atrial fibrillation story is different. Certain hospitals, providers, and areas treat afib differently, and of course almost no two patients are exactly the same either. I am always open to other stories and experiences, and the one told here is an every day occurrence at my facility.
"Eight."
, and this will always be your home." When Sam looked down, John tipped his face back up to meet John's eyes. "Do you understand that?"
Both of them turned abruptly to see him, neither expecting his presence, although John was watching Rosie for her reaction.
"Seems to me you haven't." John slides the folding chair into place at Sherlock's side. "How are you feeling, really? I do want an answer to that."
(See the end of the chapter for
"... date of birth? Thank you. Which arm would you ..." A retired banker.
"I am helping you. Surely, someday you will understand. When you have a reason to be clean, to stay clean." The brother sighs, tightens the screws. "Someday, maybe you will meet someone who isn't interested in an addict. Have you already met, perhaps? Is there a child to consider?" There is a huff. "Need I say more?"
Time passes slowly, with neither of them speaking overly much, and the nurse calls report and then shortly after that, John follows the staff pushing Sherlock's bed, delivering him back to the ICU. There is another hand-off, the dressing is checked along with pulses of his feet, and a targeted neuro exam. As has been the case previously, Sherlock's nurse performs a thorough assessment including the neuro exam that Sherlock had fussed about so much previously, although this time he is mostly just flat and a bit caustic. She pulls a computer to the doorway so she can fill them in on the expectations for the rest of the afternoon and evening, reviewing post-procedural orders with them. "No stress on the groin puncture site. Bedrest, with the head of the bed elevation no more than thirty degrees, which it's at now, after four hours, you can sit up more. Perhaps, as long as six hours have passed and the site is okay, if you're feeling adventurous, you could get into a chair around dinnertime."
"Sure, moments away from cracking your cast. Or your head." He tugged, firmly, until Sherlock was back on the floor, and given that neither cane nor crutches were anywhere within reach, he pressed again until Sherlock was seated. "That," he indicated the fiberglass cast, "should be elevated. To prevent swelling, remember?" Stubbornly, Sherlock stayed put, silently protesting. "As was explained to you quite clearly when it was placed."
"We?"
Sameer's wide eyes blinked, taking in the unfamiliar equipment, the heart monitor, the IV pump, the bed and siderails, not to mention John's frailty, but his stubborn feet didn't move until the nurse dismissed the guard and ushered him in, guiding him closer to John's bedside. It was then, when they were in close proximity, that Sameer saw John up close, living, breathing, moving and watching him back, it was then that he just let out a guttural sob and ...
"Nevermind." John chuckled, hoping that it would be enough of a distraction. "Ignore him. It's ... basically a rude word that -"
Briefly, Mycroft was tempted to reach into his pocket, pull out a few notes. He considered that helping someone took many forms, that to be someone's safety net - or cash - was not always in their best interests. Moreso, he doubted this man could find Sherlock when CCTV and some others in his realm couldn't. "Not today."
"Mmm."
"Were you born at night time, do you know?"
Sherlock was also frowning as he took note of the way John entered the flat, curious, puzzled, and on his feet in rapt attention.
John is not wrong in his assumption, and Sherlock catches sight of him, immediately letting the words fly. "Let's go, John. This is ridiculous. You can certainly just ..."
"You don't want us to move out?"
As John watches very closely, he feels Sherlock's hand slip into his own, squeeze twice before releasing, and then they see Sameer's shoulder shake a time or two. There are a few silent sobs, obviously, and Molly is speaking, hushed comforting words as she holds him. The hug radiates much emotion and John thinks it is one of the most tender moments he's seen in a very long while. The hand stroking the back of Sameer's head rubs, slows, and finally stills but they do not immediately move apart.
John chuckled harder. "How about, Sam, get me a cup of tea!"
"Yes. Exactly. Maybe you should go blow your nose again, hurry things along." John prickled back at him with a squeeze, making sure he knew that John was teasing. "It's the nature of medicine. It's not exactly true that the cure seems worse than the disease. Not in this case ..."
Lydia greets him at the door with tea - probably a
The call connected, and Mycroft could be seen at his massive desk, leaning back, relaxed and casual, though he probably wasn't that relaxed, in all reality.
It doesn't matter, he lies to himself. He had months - years - in which to act, and because he didn't, the rift is awash with regret. He is settling for second best and second choice - and she is too. He knows that she is waiting and curiously willing, that she must know deep down his allegiance, the reason for his grief, his utter devastation at unrequited ... whatever he never had with Sherlock. [Relationship? Partnership? Romance? The label is irrelevant. It died along with the cold body and the cold suicide in the even-colder ground.]
"Horrors, how will you find my obituary tomorrow without it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"No." John couldn't stop the actual face of disgust at that idea. He tried to avoid tourists and the touristy things whenever possible.
"John, thank goodness. They said you were ..." Greg begins and then sees the looks, the heavy atmosphere in the room, the expression on all three faces. He moves immediately to John's side, looking for information, searching the eyes for any sort of clue. A hand slides down to John's shoulder, squeezes once, and he realises that the news is bad but that Sherlock must be close by, that it is serious and that he's in a bad way. But that he's still here, that there's a chance, that there's hope to be had. John's hand reaches up to where Greg's hand rests on his shoulder, makes contact, takes a deep breath. Greg's voice is soft but sure. "I got here soon as I could. What is it?"
John wriggles into the lift, near as he can get to the head of the bed, hoping that Sherlock's eyes will be able to find him, if he is even interested or able. Sherlock's gaze, though, is still a little random, his blinking indicating some sort of mental fog. The lift is quick, and it is just as the soft chime announces their arrival to the destination floor that Sherlock's pale eyes do finally land on John's face.
Her words come across neutral, "Of course." There is a bit of relief in the nurse's eyes and a silent communication, a warning, a caution, a desire to make sure John knows Sherlock is particularly oppositional.
Sherlock interrupted hastily, cutting off John's next word, although they both knew what it was. "I just wanted you here, and I wanted you included in the conversation. That's the extent of it."
He didn't think he'd awakened for an emergency. Or his mobile. Or a call of nature. Just a ... sense that something had roused him. The room was still quiet but the bed - and his hand was empty - it had become something of a custom to fall asleep holding hands. Or sometimes feet, depending on how cold either of them were.
." The shirt was opened, slid to the floor with a simple extension of Sherlock's arms and a quick shimmy. "Because I'm thinking this is a self-serving demonstration of yours. Not that I'm complaining. And barring pain play, bloodshed, or the addition of another person, I'm likely to be inclined to humour you on almost all of your deepest fantasies."
The sigh Sherlock exhaled was one of long-standing tolerance. And something like disappointment. "I haven't said it lately, but even after all these years, you see but do not observe."
August 29
"I refuse to be seen in public with that." The cane had been mostly unused, leaning on the corner of the couch.
One morning he wondered if he'd been studying too hard, because he was absolutely certain he'd left his takeaway container in the refrigerator, but found it - empty - in the trash. And off to school he'd gone, when a few minutes down the road realised he'd left the tea kettle on. So he'd turned around, only to find that the kettle was not only off the burner, but empty. He had zero recollection of that, and given his very uncharacteristic forgetfulness, he made up his mind to pay more attention as he enjoyed having the place to himself.
"And that hair, it's so dark!"
John meets it and responds, "No." His expression is sad, hopeful, and introspective all at the same time. "Will you go with me?"
Sameer still stood quietly, troubled, his eyes wide and solemn. He didn't move.
John stands, feeling that too-familiar angst at leaving him again. "Have the nurse call me ... I can be back if you ..."
Her words echoed in his head as he did in fact do a little shopping on the way home. Later, he ate a small lunch while looking at the new accessory to his small table:  a ridiculous statue of an upright, leggy frog playing the violin.
Mycroft Holmes, Executive Director, MI-6
Sherlock turned on him. "Says the man with trust issues who chose med school because he couldn't fix his own family --"
Sherlock’s smile is fleeting but one of the most genuine ones he’s worn since his collapse, his admission, this terrible journey. The single word conveys his gratitude, his increased comfort, his appreciation. “John.”
There is applause after a moment, during which time John finds his seat and Mike comes back to the front of the room to introduce the next person, knowing even as he did so that it really wasn't necessary. The evening could end right there, complete in a sense, mission accomplished, exactly what they'd set out to do. It was already a rousing success.
"What are you doing?"
"For the short term. I'm hoping to find someplace closer if things work out." He pondered the Baker Street location but didn't dwell on the opportunity. "Or once I'm here on a more regular basis with longer shifts."
"I found her researching tracking devices."
kind of build-up. Both of them, anticipating some time together when Rosie was finally starting to get well. John had a few babysitters in his arsenal, and he tested the waters for the possibility of a late evening, perhaps even one where Rosie could spend the night at Molly's. Both of them knew it was coming, both wanted it. And yet, the waiting grew long even though it was a few days that stretched into a few more.
"And maybe a dash out to ... I don't know, the park or something later?"
Off the edges of the porch, there is the sound of a night animal calling to another, quietly. There are the soft chirps of crickets, of the faint wind in the distant trees, of a car still a long way off. There are soft smiles as they stand up, still holding fingertips, and carry their things inside. The door is closed, locked, and inside, their breaths become warmer and the sheets envelop them softly, the weight of the duvet insulating them from the rest. Quiet affirmations - oh god yes, more, yes please, just like that, almost - hover in the air, the quiet moan beyond actual words, dissipate into the woodwork, leaving behind the sweet, sleepy snuggles of two sated, happy men who are at peace with each other and with the world.
One morning, John makes tea for them both, sets out a small assortment of toast, fruit, yoghurt. Sherlock eats absolutely nothing.
His mind wandered.
John's eyes grew darker, his hand coming out to reach subconsciously for Sherlock's arm, a flicker of only his gaze to Sherlock's mouth.
John sat there a moment, staring off, wondering if Harry was available that evening. He looked over at Sam again, who was resting, face flushed, eyes closed, breathing fast. Under his skin, John knew his body was at war, fighting off an infection, making every attempt to win the battle that was raging. He looked forward to the surgeon's work, to fix and remove the problem, yet he was so very nervous too. The hard part was not letting it show in front of Sam.
Sherlock's cheekbones are tinged pink and he is looking away but the protestations have stopped.
"You do understand how this game is actually played, don't you?"
Isolation is one of those circumstances - collateral damage - downplayed and glossed over by much of the public. But riddle me this, why are the non-covid death rates at nursing homes now higher than usual or expected? Have you measured increases in drug use and suicide, in mental health and emotional distress? Why do family members insist on "full code" status in the face of absolute medical futility and prolonged suffering? I'll tell you - it's because people are alone. And isolation is detrimental.
In the meantime, he chats with Lydia a little, worrying at his mobile, until finally Lydia sighs with mock despair. She looks at him with no small degree of frustration, her grin at him good-natured and followed by a gesture of expectancy. Stubbornly, John doesn't answer at first.
John's mobile chirped.
"You enjoyed tonight? It was fun?"
"Are you planning on asking for something, and trying to pay it forward so I'll agree?"
"And why does it matter to you anyway? It's not like we had something planned."
"Don't do it."
"We're okay. We're better together. And you're careful?" Against Sherlock's embrace, John nodded. "This works, then." John's eyes drifted closed as he felt Sherlock's lips press against his temple. It was a sweet gesture of comfort. Of affection. "Breathe. Rest if you can."
Vaccination won't fix everything right away. But it will allow resources to be distributed much more fairly, based on need rather than availability.
He was neither disappointed nor surprised when Mrs. Hudson and her pastries (from downstairs) and Sherlock (from down the hallway), descended upon the kitchen all within several minutes of each other. One was wearing an apron over clothing, the other, a dressing gown over rumpled cotton pyjamas. They were both endearing - for different reasons.
, shall I?"
"What is it?" Sherlock asked, his eyes still closed, trying to follow John's instructions. He turned his head, listening, and John could see how quickly his eyes were moving behind the closed lids, as if that would help.
"How are you feeling?"
"Yes." John's throat is suddenly dry, but he will not evade this now. When Sherlock is ready to talk, John must be ready too.
," he muttered as he emphasised the words, "could be much better used for other things, rather than saying stupid, idiotic, untrue, misguided, or misdirected statements." Silence stretched between them, both of them comfortable in it, for a little while.
"Hand me the form. I'll sign." He holds out a steady hand, but for a moment no one moves. "I do hope if something happens to me while under your care, for example, you have a wire and a device in my heart, you'll find it possible to act a bit more expediently?"
One eye narrowed as he recalled the last he'd interacted with the patient through the glass doors of the covid unit. "To a rehab? On oxygen?"
With a huff, Sherlock pulled back a little more, offering up his forearm. "Go ahead, then. If you must."
For nearly an hour. And by the end of it, he was giving mental high fives to this particular Detective Inspector for his boundaries, his handling of Sherlock, and his professionalism. Although the DI obviously knew Sherlock's name, Sherlock himself could not say the same thing.
It was John, laying in his hospital bed, cardiac monitor a-glow and the pixelated white sheets crawling into focus. The head of the bed was elevated. Also visible was an IV pump, illuminating the siderail with faint light from the display, a pillow, the usual hospital paraphernalia - overbed table, tissues, basin, nurse call. John's hair looked dark and tousled in the indirect lighting.
"And what to do about it."
As if he wasn't good enough. As if he'd been disconnected, refused, and found wanting.
"Obviously. I did call you."
"I'll be fine here, then." John watches them, nearly ready, paying close attention to the arterial line, and finish the task that will connect the portable ventilator, unlock the bed, and all the rest. Sherlock looks the same, perhaps a bit haggard now, his chin much more stubbley than he ever lets it get, but his colour is good and he is well-medicated, relaxed. Speaking quietly to Sherlock, John leans closer, "See you soon." He squeezes the hand he is still holding, smooths the blanket back in place, and watches them make the familiar trip back to the other department.
Sherlock is glaring, and John waits for a moment, listening to what he is really saying. He hopes his face isn't glaring back, although part of him would like to.
When bad news came from home, it was to each other that bore some of the strain, the worry. There was the occasional illness, or hangover, or injury. Homesick or lonely. One of them now and again threw a somewhat understandable temper tantrum, and they all waited it out, forgave much with an offer of a beer or a game of catch or a sharing of news or internet access. When one of them had been wronged, there was unwavering support, offers of retaliation - and although nothing ever came of it, the camaraderie was quickly deepening, strengthening, becoming bonded, close-knit.
When he tries, it uncomfortably leads to frustration, with what-ifs, with wishing to turn back time. He is all five stages of grief - shock, denial, bargaining, but very little acceptance, and anger holding it all together. The tube fiasco, the stag-do, the pain, all goes undiscussed. The anger fades under numb scars and they move past; wedding plans and such carry them along under an avalanche of business.
"Not going."
, John thinks, and the echoes of the phrase swirl in his mind for a moment. But there is none.
"Yes."
He briefly considered the home, without power, a corner open to the elements and already water damaged, and then the man with injuries that could yet be quite serious. He would be neglecting a responsibility no matter what he chose. And it wasn't really a question nor a difficult decision.
A charged moment between them threatened to explode as they looked at each other, John cool and rational, Sherlock vibrating with irritation. "I don't think so."
There were signatures, congratulations, and good wishes from their closer friends who attended. Afterward, their carefully packed bags ended up in a rented car boot, and the three of them escaped to a not-too-far-away Holmes family cottage for a two-part trip - the first few days with Rosie, and the remainder of the week, without.
With a teasing, sinister growl, Sherlock took John's arm and lunged, taking them both in a flash down the hidden alcove between a couple of buildings. It was almost completely black there, out of the glow of any streetlamps or signage. They both breathed a little heavy as Sherlock nudged at John's chest. "I'll give you something to worry about." He tucked his knee between both of John's as he eased them back against the wall, using his hands to prevent smudge or damage to John's tuxedo jacket. "You realise, distraction is a far more enjoyable activity. Far better than your incessant worrying."
"Is there a photo of the entire family?"
"Holmes?"
John had been trying to hold in his laughter and failed miserably. "You do realise, you madman, that this is a caricature of a frog, and by definition, all of it is impossible. Not meant to be realistic at all."
(and in one case, destroyed for a reason no one actually knew). When they dined out, John had learned to eat the choicer bites first because Sherlock apparently seemed to think he had access rights when it came to taking them. So John ate the crunchiest chips, the tenderest steak, the most golden brown mushroom first. Because none of it was ever guaranteed to survive Sherlock's pilfering.
Intently.
"Nice try."
The trip home, uneventful. Mindless tube stops, a few blocks walk. Baker Street, the beacon at the center, calling him and yet, he hesitated at the door.
"I'm fine."
"The swearing, though," Sam teased, pulling the pastry plate closer to him, then smiling across at John as he neatly polished off the rest of it.
Sherlock is giving the nurse a very hard time, and John stops to listen to the nurse hold her own, plead her case, and offer calm, logical explanations. All of these fall on mostly deaf ears and Sherlock is just having an impossible time with all of it. It very quickly includes his plan of care, mobility, medication instructions, oxygen therapies, and other various explanations. She uses words like 'the doctor ordered these, and we've explained it' and John hears the interruption, Sherlock's tone of voice reply with words like 'ridiculous' and a moment later some muttering about being better off at home. He turns personally on the nurse and the phrase 'you're suffering with imposter syndrome and probably shouldn't be here at all.'
Speedy's in the morning was crowded. For this reason, on those rare moments when both John and Sherlock ventured out to get a cup outside of their flat, it was usually off-peak. John's just restarting surgery hours were still rather limited (since his services were only temporary and now complete, in the Covid Unit at Barts), cases for Greg were at a completely understandable and welcome lull, and it was (of course, naturally,
"I understood none of that, you know." Greg is still standing awkwardly as John takes another bite of something in front of him, bins the trash, recaps the water bottle.
"If Rosie wants bloody noses, I'm growing inclined to give in to that request," John told the room. "Starting with yours," he directed this at Sherlock.
Sherlock matches it. "You know as well as I, there really wasn't a choice to make."
One of the aides who'd accompanied the stretcher paused long enough in the hall to grab a blanket from the warmer, spread it over Sherlock. The short trip - hallway, elevator, hallway, doors - finally came to a silent halt, where John was directed into a waiting area. There was a TV, refreshment area, couches, a visitor bathroom, and a rack of informational brochures.
"Pffft," Sherlock makes a puff of his own, places one hand over his face, and leans his head back against the back of the chair, his eyes drifting closed.
His first thought is that somehow Sherlock has managed to play a joke on all of them, that this is a terrible experiment gone awry. He wonders if he had sneaked a manikin arm into the bed and was hiding his own arm under the side of his body. And his second thought right on the heels of the first is that although Sherlock is clever, this is not a joke. He is too sick and he is ... well, not as dark or macabre as that would be. His fingers, hand, arm, feel quite different in temperature and turgor. John knows his own breath hitches as his hand splays out over Sherlock's wrist. Something ... is ... very ...
Our family has indeed done hard things, John mused in the present, watching the dog nibbling on a chew toy, watching Rosie turn up the volume on a favourite song, watching Sherlock as he poked and prodded the fire, tucking a variety of things into the base of the flames, probably running calculations of flammability or some other observation known and appreciated only by him.
"I thought you ... were coming in ... to fuss at me." The patient had been warned the nurses were sending the doc in, and that if he wouldn't listen to them, perhaps he would if it came from a physician.
"Doesn't change that it's patriarchal nonsense."
Personal and Confidential
"Yes. Of course. It was wonderful."
"I don't know," John tries outright pleading ignorance.
"My life was mostly working." John considered the truth of his assertion. He had primarily thrived at his pre-army job, done some research on his off hours - work-related of course, and picked up extra time when there was a need.
The first time it had happened, when the foundation of their relationship had begun to shift, John and Sherlock had just returned from dinner. It had been a glorious evening, Rosie very well behaved, a little charmer, enjoying being the center of attention. And not just attention from them. The older couple sitting at Angelo's. Angelo himself. And Mrs. Hudson when they'd returned home.
"Nothing. Just keeping your fussing from carrying down the hallway."
"You are not obligated. This is far bigger than one provider in one hospital of many in the city." Unconvinced, John waited, watched, listened. "Do you want me to absolve you of any responsibility?" John's faint smile answered that as a no thank you. "I'm certain you can find other ways to help. Tele-medicine this time, perhaps." John's shoulders responded to that, a faint non-committal rise but did not reject the idea outright. "Perhaps this wave is meant to see you riding it out here."
"I believe you'll find it rather self-explanatory."
Shortbread biscuits, with apricot filling, rested on an oval platter, given to them many years before by Mrs. Hudson.
When he comes back into the room, Sherlock is still forlorn, but he opens an eye. "I certainly hope you're not expecting me to thank you for doing that."
John waited, frowning, trying to keep up with Sherlock's statements, his sharp mind that was somewhere far ahead of where John was trying to catch up. After a moment or two, John shrugged. "I have no idea what you're talking about."
With both hands, the doctor supported Sherlock's foot, watching Sherlock's reaction, "Let me know if this hurts," and he dorsiflexed his foot, bringing his toes up toward his body.
John awakened early, still for the most part it was dark out, and he knew before opening his eyes that he was in Sherlock's bed. The scent, the pillow, the high thread count of the sheets,
"I know. It'll pass. How about we --?"
Glancing over at John's words, there is a second or two of actually listening to what John said, his word choices. John hesitates, recalling, as one side of Sherlock's mouth quirks in a smile, and he looks back at John with amusement.
In the wake of the gift, the room full of honour, John makes the rounds, congratulating a few, thanking many, and disappears unnoticed, exiting quietly out the door. His shoes make little sound along the sidewalk as he leaves the building behind him.
"Papa?" His voice crackled with emotion and stress, and sounded very young.
It wasn't limited to John. To be certain, Mycroft, Greg and any or all who worked at the Met, anyone in earshot, actually any criminal in London, even Mrs. Hudson was fair game if Sherlock was able to ... discover something. And heaven help the audience when the madman decided to inappropriately disclose it. Financial, behavioral, affairs, kinks, habits, illegal substances, relationship indiscretions, criminal, or just something embarrassing and personal - it was all fair game.
"So, all this time had gone by," Ella had looked up at him to find John nodding, eyes bright and wide, "and then you got, what? A text message?"
The smile morphed into something a bit more concrete, not quite genuine but an echo of it. It was so gratifying that he didn't have to really explain much, that he'd already shared more than enough of this terrible COVID19 journey, that of course Sherlock knew. "Yes." He'd streamlined the process of coming home, the clothing being removed, shoes set aside, so that the dressing gown he wore presently wrapped around, snug, comfortable, warm. The shower ritual, the strip-tease by the doorway, although very necessary, had become tedious. "Yes I did."
Sherlock was outside the doors of the rehab centre when John emerged a brief time later. His eyes sparkled as he took in the location. "You get asked to leave?"
Sherlock's toes, specifically his
They've all agreed that leaving Sherlock to rest, cluster activity and assessments, treatments and repositioning, best they can should help him. Early in the evening, more labwork is sent, checking on blood counts, coagulation times to assure the heparin is still running at the appropriate rate, an arterial blood gas just to be thorough, and another metabolic panel. After reviewing the results - mostly expected - Rob offers Sherlock an ice chip, which he takes enthusiastically, and so John ends up with the cup of ice chips and a spoon, to dole out carefully. He is transitioned from the oxygen mask to nasal cannula, and his levels hover right around ninety with high flow rates, which, according to Rob, is marginally okay at this stage of recovery. The arterial line is discontinued, and, because it's an arterial puncture and Sherlock is on an anticoagulant, Rob holds pressure on it for quite a while to assure that there will be no bleeding or oozing from the site. Now that he is off the ventilator and there are no more blood samples to be drawn until morning, he really doesn't need it and will feel better and be safer without it.
"Another fifty and fifty. And we'll get started."
"Absolutely not," John mutters almost immediately. "You'll be threatening my person and demanding that I take you home. Or give me the slip." They fold a blanket over Sherlock's legs, ignoring his growling about looking like an invalid. They help him put his feet on the footrests, and there is a moment where all of them, all four of the people in the room, can feel a bit of a tingle in the air. "Not gonna lie, it's going to feel good to get away from here," John says quietly.
Her birthday dinner, also her request for her papa's cottage pie, had just been finished, dishes removed, stomachs not too full for dessert. The cake, baked and brought along by Molly (who'd arrived just midday), vanilla with a coffee-flavoured creme filling, waited. Her Uncle Mycroft's hand was poised with the lighter hovering over the candles, and he smiled in her direction. "Ready?"
The phrase was translated, and the glance was immediate to John's eyes and with something of a surprised look about her. Nervously, she said, "I am Sonya Zubair, and --"
"I hate you."
"Yeah, that sounds ..." He rubs a tired hand over his face, knowing that his smile is lost and forlorn, and knows she is right about his heart. "Okay. Good idea. You'll let me --"
"If I could just stand up," Sherlock complains and his eyes are more focused. "Or even sit up."
Had Sherlock been looking at John, he would have seen the fond eye-roll. As it was, John blotted again with the alcohol, pressed hard as he dried it, and dart-like, administered the jab, delivering the medication and withdrawing the needle smoothly. "There, you're done."
Some of it was in the way both John and Sherlock kept him informed.
And Sherlock's hand still has no pulse.
When Sam was calm enough to listen, John soothed him further, explaining, "Your mama getting sick had nothing to do with taking care of you. It was not your fault." Sam clearly didn't believe him given the sad look about him. John tried to explain it differently. "The disease she had was just one of those terrible things. Nothing she did caused it, and it was nothing you did." Sam shuddered a bit, exhaling fiercely, then left his eyes closed as he seemed to finally settle and lean more comfortably on John's shoulder. "Not your fault," he whispered again. "Do you understand me?"
"Come on you," John says quietly, to Sherlock who is still sprawled out on his chair. The afternoon and evening have been on a much lower-key pace than the hospital. But unfortunately, John finds that Sherlock is just as ornery. And much less tolerant. "You'll be more comfortable laying down."
In Sherlock's voice, in his mind, he hears the fondly spoken 'my idiot' and answers back in silent communion 'my genius.'
John felt Sherlock's hand touch lightly on his back, saw the other one come along to rest on Rosie's arm. He lay his hand overtop's Sherlock's, completing the circle. "Yes," he agreed softly. "We all are."
"Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me."  Ps 42:7
"I want to go home."
"... coming in today for the jab. Any ..." A housekeeper for a hotel.
The man in the corner was smirking -
of potential. The makings of a great man, a diamond in the rough. It called somehow, something deep inside Greg’s core - instinct and empathy - that he had a job to do, tasks above and beyond, to come to the aid of this particular kid.
"Tell Mrs. Hudson I want ginger biscuits."
"I know."
This latest call from the police "come get him at the precinct" and he was stuck in a small waiting room while one of the officers went and brought Sherlock out to him to be taken home. He'd had to sign papers that detailed drug testing schedules and some sort of probation, where he needed to check in with an assigned officer periodically. He would be expected at that next meeting to detail a plan and to stay clean. There were dire consequences described but Mycroft didn't hang high hopes on any of them. They'd never had an impact before.
"Oh no," John agreed. "He's a lot of things, but never that." He pondered briefly the expensive toiletries, the posh accessories, the cost of his bespoke clothes. "Not cheap in any regard, actually." Keeping it light, John leaned his head back against the wall, smiling. The sense of relief dissipated from within his chest, settling. He took a deep breath while the nurse left. It felt like the first deep breath since ... since before all this happened.
The medical advisor, the physician heard the imperial demand, the cool distance, the need for knowledge. "Somewhere a bit more than fifty percent, given the massive pulmonary embolism with cardiovascular collapse and refractory hypoxaemia."
sounds like fun," Sam muttered with a sweet smile and a chuckle. If nothing else, he and Sherlock had made sure he understood sarcasm. And boy, did he ever.
"I have no need of a crayon from my brother." Sherlock cast another disdainful glance at John. "Now who's being ridiculous."
"No thanks. I only wanted one change made to this bedroom," and his arms came around John easily. "And it seems to be have happened already."
John smiled, gripping his phone, thrilled to have at least heard from him. He considered his options before responding.
"Do you want me to call someone?"
Stonily, Sherlock crossed his arms and looked away.
"You won't be worth it then, either." Mycroft's mouth, just faintly, twitched at his own retort. "Childishly appropriate for a juvenile birthday party."
John could well believe that. At his darkest moments, the emotion was buried quite far from the surface. He could still recall how it felt to be cold, flat, steely. Uncaring. Even as he remembered, he was grateful to have moved past that.
Sherlock had cleared his throat, one eye narrowed over his mobile as he glared at her, apparently having noticed something amiss. Before he could fire off a scathing remark or otherwise be too annoying, John took a step closer to him and halted with one foot over the toes of his bare feet, a threat. "Fine," John answered.
For a few panicky moments I couldn't get these guys ... *ahem* ... where I wanted them and thought this would be dropped to a T rating.  Which is fine, by the way.  [Yes I love quoting that even in RL and find it amusing].  But they manage it (several times), and the M stays.
Heading out of town for the rest of the weekend. If there are edits, anything unclear, be assured I'll be getting to that in a few days. Wanted to get this out there anyway, thanks for reading!
No further words were necessary.
Allison spoke quietly, calmly, as she manoeuvred the scope around. "Here's LV, mitral valve looks great. All we need actually, a few housekeeping images first," and she worked with the echo tech, well coordinated as they viewed and snapped images of chambers and valves. John watched the screen, watching the activity of valves, muscles, contractility, systole, diastole, all working together except for the quivering even he could identify of the atria, the irregularity of the snapping of the valves, the quivering of the muscle. It was a sobering experience, seeing this part of Sherlock, this piece usually hidden. His heart rate had slowed a bit, thankfully. Finally, a few adjustments of the camera angle using a dial, and Allison began narrating again. "So right over here, just a little, coming into focus now, looking for that left atrial appendage, that boot section. He's pretty photogenic here, it's ... right there. See? No clot, looks very clean." The echosonographer snapped a few more images, recording the various angles. "Good. We're done with this part, I'll just run the aorta on our way out."
"Not if you keep this up."
"Why? I don't need gear just to watch."
"I could get --"
"Tim's going home today."
"It's a terrible rendition about American history, and who really cares," Sherlock began.
John nods and kind of brushes her kindly away. "Thanks, you've been great, but I think we're good." She hesitates. "I've got it from here, thanks."
"Sherlock Holmes." The answer is tremulous and somewhat dazed.
"Yes, papa."
"Three days?" Sherlock presses for an answer. "Maybe we could just do all this at home?"
"That's not yours, and not a toy. Don't touch that please."
John answered the knock on the door. Rosie and Sam were still seated at the table, finishing lunch. Sherlock was out. "Yes?" he said, still in the process of wiping his own mouth on a napkin, getting rid of the remnants of his own meal. He opened the door more fully to find two visitors, a woman standing there, a man next to her. She was older, trim, and stood boldly. She wore a long skirt in dark brown with a matching long-sleeved jacket, a head scarf, understated but elegant jewelry. The attire and skin tone, that of a Middle Eastern complexion, with dark hair pulled back.
The moment is over too quickly, and John returns to his seat. Mary's hand on his is oddly rigid and distant. They exchange glances, hers cool and suspicious, his as if caught in the act, and they mutely resolve that this moment is over will not be discussed. And then Sherlock announces the coming addition to the Watson family. And if there had been any hope that they might someday be more than friends, the glimmer of that disappears without a trace.
"Never mind."
John appreciates her send-off, the wisdom of helping him - helping them - make the transition, and he speaks what they are all thinking:  "And a step closer to home."
This letter is to officially end our previous agreement and to make you an offer to continue living at 221b Baker Street. I have already negotiated a very reasonable monthly rent on your behalf. While officially, your services as PA are no longer needed in a paid capacity, it would be greatly appreciated if you would continue to reside with Sherlock. He has certainly benefitted from your influence, direction, example, and companionship, and I do not wish for that to change.
"About twenty minutes." Dawn hovers nearby, ready to help if needed, keeping an eye on things.
Rosie had not stopped chattering since John had picked her up after her return from the science programme. She'd learned a lot, made tonnes of new friends, had adventures, and placed a respectable fourth in the overall project presentation. "... and then after that we snuck out in the middle of the night to get pizza, and Gwen told spooky stories on the walk back like she wasn't scared a'tall but when I quick grabbed her arm while we were walking, she screamed and we almost got caught! ..."
"Something we need to know?"
"For something that is so automatic as a heart beat is, it's annoying to be aware of it. I can feel it, and just the sensation of it is ... It's like waiting for it to happen again. That acceleration that used to be there."
On cue, some vigorous laughter sounded from within the flat upstairs. John smiled, patiently reassuring him. Sherlock, after all, hadn't had the days of planning and plotting that John'd had. "Truly, they're fine."
"Nope."
Go away, coronavirus. We are tired of your exhausting presence and the pall you have cast over all aspects of our lives.
"Your loss."
"Did you try calling him?"
Sherlock is afraid.
Healthcare language - it is extremely difficult to hide.
. It is always with a snarl, and John doesn't especially blame him. They've only been home for a handful of days and John knows - and can't stop - that he hovers. He watches chest rise, chest fall, movement, for focal neuro deficits. He notices body functions, offers more water or juice when he thinks Sherlock is becoming dehydrated. He watches
"You're so pretty." The slur was delivered with enough of a smile not to be as offensive as it could have been. "Seriously, no one gives real names on those sites. And not only Slavic heritage, but not especially bright, to leave this particular volume here. It's a limited edition and relatively valuable."
They never searched too hard - they simply knew.
"I'm angry at life."
"I understand. Then find someone you know, either of those friends, ask to borrow something for a little while. Set it out somewhere. The point is to find something to look at other than drab open spaces. Give your mind something to appreciate." Both of them stood, knowing it was time to move John along, end the appointment. The brief, in-office nap had actually helped him, and he was feeling less exhausted than when he'd arrived. "Are you at least willing to consider it?"
"The one I have today, Sheila, was deployed for two years."
"That was it?" Sherlock snapped his attention to where John had activated the needle-guard and was disposing of the empty syringe into the needlebox. "I didn't even ... are you sure?"
Rob appears again, explains that it is change of shift, that he will be giving report and will come back in to introduce the new nurse. John turns to really see Sherlock, laying still, chest rising, falling, under support of the ventilator. And he doesn't fault Mycroft overmuch for wanting to get away. John doesn't particularly care to see Sherlock like this either, truth be told. The tubes, lines, wires, and monitors don't especially bother him, but the knowledge that none of it is remotely comfortable and that underneath it all is someone he cares about very deeply is ... disturbing. And it is unsettling that Sherlock is still, quiet, receptive, compliant even, and not fighting the therapies that have been instituted.
"So," John hedged, "yesterday, you started to say something about Rosie. About while she was away."
"Go. It's where you need to be, I think. We're fine here, and you're not bad company. Not at all. But your head - and your heart - is elsewhere." She offers a few suggestions as he grabs his laptop, charger, a few movies, and his smile becomes a trace more hopeful.
"Couple of days." Sherlock had seemed aggrieved but had obviously surrendered to what he know he has to do. The huff, annoyed.
That last paragraph would understandably freak Sherlock out. I remember saying that I wasn't afraid - in the early days, before we knew. Now, I know enough to be very afraid.
"It used to." Sherlock's eyes met and held John's when he looked over, but it wasn't a glare or a particularly emotional statement. Unrushed, he looked over at Sameer, to clarify. "So if it bothers you, that's okay. But there'll be a time when you just overlook it. No matter what, some people are still going to be idiots."
Sherlock chuckled, reached his arm around Rosie to pull her close, awkward given the chairs and the proximity of the firepit. "He's just being polite, in case I was stroppy about his making a unilateral decision. Which I'm not."
And then Rob's words: "He's okay."
Not that the waiting was easy. Occasionally, one of them was more snippy, more stressed, projecting the frustration onto something they shouldn't. One brief surge of annoyance from Sherlock resulted in a door-slamming flat exit. John hadn't thought of the phrase 'danger night' in a long time, and when Sherlock had not returned when John bunked in for the night, he'd left a note, a hastily scribbled,
"There isn't one." John's words cut into the room, although they were quiet. "And even if there were,
voice.
"Shut up. You have no idea ..." The words trailed off into mumbling, and then John could hear more wind noise in the speaker of the phone.
"Still can't get much of a blood pressure," one of the nurses said. "Name?"
If you develop symptoms that recur such as chest pain, shortness of breath, collapse, bleeding or oozing from procedure sites, you may come to the A&E or call 999 if you cannot reach your regular physician.
"Yes, if you were thirteen, that would have been hysterical." He does not surrender the pants right away, but unhooks the foot pumps so Sherlock can slide his feet in and then gestures to the floor so he can stand up, slide the pants up and to tie the drawstring, the gown fluttering in front of him. After sitting back down, John studies the gown, the IV, and it takes a little bit of doing, but the gown is eventually swapped out for the tee shirt, a brief aseptic disconnection of the IV, the oxygen and telemetry monitoring still attached, and just that activity has Sherlock's breathing a bit laboured, his respiratory rate, and most likely his heart rate too, elevated.
"Oh god, do that again."
They are taking a handful of days, a holiday just for themselves, in a borrowed cabin in the outskirts north of Ipswich. A vague connection from one of John's military days, a no-strings offer, a surprisingly posh home despite the rustic location.
With a sigh, John leaned in a little closer. "I chose the side that I don't sleep on. But it really doesn't matter."
"I believe my score is still a zero."
." There was another smirk. "And I'm not the one that the press used to refer to as confirmed bachelor, either, as you recall."
"It is
"We'll figure it out. Long as you're sure you're interested."
He shrugged, knowing he would be making up something ridiculous and on the receiving end of their scorn, but he was willing to sacrifice himself at least a little in the interest of them getting along. "It's obvious. A puppy." He picked up the newspaper he'd been reading and pointedly did not look at the looks of disdain at his pitiful attempt.
Friend.
He'd coughed a few times, not his usual morning post-smoking hack, blamed it on John's withholding cigarettes.
Another squeeze in response.
John opens a piece that he knows Sherlock likes, sets it by the pillow, and for a few moments, Sherlock listens.
All John had actively done was to hold the door for him as he'd exited the cab. Rather than answer him - I'm not actually fussing - John had said nothing, done nothing, and escaped into the kitchen. The dark cloud of annoyance was circling Sherlock's head when he returned with one cup of hot tea, set it next to him, and waited. There was no acknowledgement, and John could feel the barometric change and plummet as the storm intensified.
, John thought,
"She's fine." Sherlock turned the light off, joining John on the bed. "But I think by morning, she's going to have a complete and total redecorating plan for that bedroom."
"Okay."
"Oh please." Rosie certainly didn't seem particularly upset; her voice was low. "... and if he went out, his mobile's gone but his jacket is here ..."
John decides to keep quiet about that for the moment.
"Not especially. They know how to reach us. Why, did you?"
The leading tone of his statement seemed to imply that he was afraid of something else, though, and Sherlock didn't miss the opportunity. "Well, if not that, what are you afraid of?"
"That is fair," Sonya said through the interpreter. "I agree."
"I just need ..." He presses an elbow into the mattress as if he's going to get up.
John is just clearing up Rosie's dinner of some finely chopped chicken, squash, rice. He has taken to giving her a self-feeder, too, in which he can place various soft foods and she can gnaw on them through the large holes of the finely woven silicone pouch. It keeps her hands busy and takes the stress off him to be everywhere in keeping her hands away from her feeding spoon or sippy cup. For himself, he simply found the oldest takeaway still in the refrigerator that was still safe for human consumption and ate in between talking with Rosie and listening to her ever increasing plethora of sounds and vocal experimentation. Mrs. Hudson has told him previously that Rosie at times sounds like one of those exotic bird exhibits at the zoo with all her sounds, and she serenades him for the sole purpose of getting a reaction.
"No. You're giving it to her. It'll keep."
Feeling much better now.
Sameer nodded, though he was somewhat less animated than John had expected. "That'd be nice."
"Blood clot in the lung, was what you said." From behind the oxygen mask, Sherlock looks at John, a little bit accusatory. "From clot in the leg."
Blinking several times as if that would clear his mental capacity, John lay there not processing well. "My squad?" His voice, raspy and uneven, was even more distorted under the oxygen mask he wore.
Greg doesn't speak much on the short drive back to Baker Street, and John is grateful, tips his head back against the car seat. He has read and sent several texts before closing his eyes in the car, just to rest them.
"Damn." Sherlock nearly grits his teeth, glares at John, who looks back questioningly and very intentionally, daringly silent. Sherlock seethes, stubborn, and a few moments go by before he finally surrenders. "I ... Can you --?"
"You're too competitive for that."
"I would have deleted them, obviously."
He flings it off his face. "No more. Enough."
The adults on the screen seem a bit surprised at this and there is a few seconds of awkward silence as, at least on Baker Street, Greg smiles a mite victoriously and Molly frowns and angles her head trying to figure out what just happened and how Greg figured it out.
He is already on hyper-alert, and on his feet without conscious decision. His hand presses on his mobile in his pocket, and he knows he didn't miss a call. "Is everything okay?" he asks, then spies Rosie in the stroller, holding onto one of her favourite items this past week, a fabric book with crinkley pages. She makes a noise of greeting, holds out the book to him.
"Maybe
He managed to give himself an internal, mental shake. He needed quite expeditiously to tamp down on the unease, the negativity, the ... darkness inside before going to talk to Ella. He would hide it, shove it away, bury it, keep it under wraps. The last thing he needed was for his therapist to discover the depths of the despair within him.
"You all right?"
"Doctors are terrible rule followers. Almost as bad as nurses."
"Stroke risk?" he whispers. For as much distress as Sherlock is in, he is for the moment anyway processing well, operating on all cylinders, making connections, given that he has just asked a rather insightful question.
Sherlock's worry lines fade a little, and his smile more genuine. "I always thought I'd retire here. Keep bees. Eat honey. Be that crazy old man everyone thinks is a serial killer." The uncertainty tugs at John’s core as Sherlock adds, “But …”
"I wouldn't recommend that either. You still ask her for the occasional favour. I'd think you'd hate for your morgue access or body supplies to be curtailed in any way now, would you?" There was an answering huff. "Fine, you can sulk all you want. Just don't take this away from them. It's not worth it."
"That's not funny."
"Yes."
John was just shaking his head as Rosie, spying the gesture, commented on Sherlock's having been rude. A few hours later, when John had asked Rosie to do something and instead, she stuck her tongue out at him, John deposited Rosie, squirming and protesting, into Sherlock's lap. "Here. You can explain yourself and why it absolutely is not okay to do that." He raised a brow, considering that there were definitely times he felt he actually had three children living with him. Of course, he was sleeping with the ring-leader. He pointed a finger at them. "And then I want an apology from you both." He counted himself just a little bit fortunate that she hadn't picked up on his
"So is this day one or day two?"
"It's fine."
There was one mildly uncomfortable discussion that followed a news media announcement about a famous celebrity coming out as bisexual. Up until that moment Sameer didn't know what the term meant nor that it even existed. Both Sherlock and John answered his few questions, but only Sherlock was watching him carefully for the instant that it clicked, that some people have preferences for either or perhaps sometimes felt attraction for both genders, and he could tell the moment it clicked for Sameer. He looked at John, Rosie, a collection of photos that included Mary and Rosie, then the one of the family as it currently was. A wide smile, a sparkle of his Watson-eyes, and a satisfied stare back at John as if he now understood. "Ohhhhh," he finally said, nodding to himself, the word long and drawn out.
"Long as we're clear then, I have no problem with that." If Sherlock expected more protestation, he did not seem surprised as John continued, nodding his head toward the other man's waist. "Trousers. Off." The order was calm, direct, flat. "And then the rest."
"Good, because you know there's very little in the budget for that."
Rosie continues to lunge toward Sherlock, intent on the nasal cannula (on
The curtains were more filtering as opposed to darkening, so the room was actually a bit lighter, but overall it was a very quiet, insular house. Quiet enough to hear the difference between a regular, normal breath and the deeper sigh of relaxation. "It's odd. Unusual. Not having anything particular to get up for."
"Oh, I suppose," Mrs. Hudson said with an exaggerated, low key sigh. She could feel her maternal heart just breaking at Sameer's behavior, his worry, at his young age, being so aware of money and the need to scrape by. She wondered how many nights they had gone to bed hungry, and an idea struck her. Raising her head, she said with a loud exhale, "I'm rather partial to lamb, but if you really insist..." She kept half an eye on him, considering how much to push, definitely not wanting him to take her comment the wrong way. "Haven't had lamb in so long," she whispered, knowing she was playing him and considering - not for the first time - that for all she put up with from John and Sherlock, that this was perfectly all right.
Rosie elbowed her way into John's lap, no longer content unless she was right in the middle of things. She considered the grouping, then pointed at both of the smaller photos. "My mama. And your mama." Her brow wrinkled. "Did they know each other?"
Arriving home, John was still in the routine of strip-shower-supper, and once in lounge pants or pyjamas, he would most often prefer to talk about anything but the virus, the hospital, the severity of their co-worker, or even world trends and cases. They no longer watched the news.
"Do I have him transferred to another hospital?" The restating of the question was simply to keep them both focused.
Business-like steps approach, and they reluctantly separate. Mycroft appears, of course, and Rosie's physician.
"Increase fluids for sure. Drinking water will help. Roughage, fruit juice, higher fiber foods." John shakes his head as Rosie overhears them discussing fruit juice and brings her sippy cup over, hands it to Sherlock. He continues to be amazed - and perhaps mildly alarmed - at how much she really understands. "Yes, that's so nice. Thank you very much."
John is relieved at that, and glad that it didn't require another puncture, line placement, or procedure - the groin site was already accessed. "More protection." The filter is the one John learned initially as a Greenfield filter, rested like a mesh umbrella low in the inferior vena cava to catch any further clot that might break free from Sherlock’s legs, keeping them from the more central circulation. Keeping the clot from reaching the lungs.
"So ..." John began.
"Of course."
"I know it was rough," John said quietly, trying not to panic. "All I had with me was a little lidocaine, and a number thirteen scalpel. But the pain was ..."
He shakes his head on the inside at the roller-coaster of this past week. And then he snuffles a bit, catching Sherlock's glance, realising that the roller coaster began at the bequest of Mike Stamford.
"Exactly."
"Please don't," she says with a frown as Rosie splashes in the running water.
John felt bad for him, that the desperation had won. That he'd given up and then given in. And even as he began to mourn the loss, deep down, he could completely understand it.
Allison and John exchanged glances, mostly each querying the other if intervention was needed. John shook his head, knowing Sherlock needed mostly to vent about it. And to put some distance between himself and the hospital as soon as they could manage it. "I'll see you in two weeks. You'll call for any questions?" The question she directed at Sherlock initially, who - as expected - rolled his eyes and looked away. Meanwhile, John murmured in the affirmative.
"Great. So you're telling me instead of dying from stroke, I'm going to exsanguinate due to a side effect of what's supposed to keep me safe."
"That's ridiculous." Sherlock glared at John, waiting for intervention and when there was none, he looked at the doctor as if awaiting rescue.
"Yes, and it was easy, easier than I thought, switching back and forth between Dari and English, helping them."
Leaving his PA and his driver kerbside, Mycroft sighed as he set foot inside one of the places he knew Sherlock slept from time to time. At his arrival, the few people that had been in the building had quickly scattered out the back doors in alarm. Much of the detritus was meager belongings - clothing, a few books, random bedding, and stashes of food. He recognised only one thing as belonging to his brother, a long, threadbare coat that was missing buttons. The lining was torn, there were stains, and it was many years out of date.
"Sherlock."
"I'll catch up with you in the ICU a little later, then. Okay?" Dr. Benson makes sure John nods, that he is okay before leaving.
"Oh, okay, that's a great idea, because clearly not talking about it is helping. I'm sure, after all you just went through, that you'd love to get readmitted with a bowel obstruction -"
"No, you said you lied --"
Sameer removed a gift box he'd been hiding under the couch. He was grinning as he handed John the brightly wrapped, heavy box.
Until this latest escapade when it became unavoidable.
"After performing a non-consented surgical procedure, without proper equipment, certainly no license or authorisation!"
Sherlock hesitates at that, watching John closely for his reaction, and John himself blinks for only a moment. The times he has ever surprised Sherlock he can count on one hand, and this is probably as good a time as any for another - what he thinks will be, anyway - moment to surprise the man. With a knowing look, he clears his throat before speaking. "Me too. well ADD, not the other," John admits, and when Sherlock cuts a quick, surprised stare at him, he adds, "Seriously. Couldn't sit still, trouble paying attention in school."
"This was not what I expected. While Rosie was away, I'd ..."
Sherlock blinks once, glances at the white board in the room for the date. "This is day four."
"John is perfectly capable —" Sherlock mutters.
The cough wracks him a few times, and he murmurs an apology to the man standing near him who is casting a sly look. His eyes cut quickly to the tube system map, and he considers getting out of the crowded car and just walking a few blocks to get some fresh air and away from people. He could cut back underground if needed, catch something closer to Baker Street. Or perhaps, he thinks, beginning to feel a mite more peaked, a cab. His chest is aching more and he feels exhausted out of proportion to what he should be. As if his tank is half full and he's oddly a bit lightheaded.
"We'll call you."
"Phew," John breathed, "that's good news." He could feel the tension in his shoulders ease, and he reached out to take Sherlock's hand, their fingers twining together briefly before releasing again.
John doesn't take the piss. "Okay. Don't wake me if you do, so, either way, I'll see you in the morning then."
It was during one of those o'dark-thirty mornings that he ended up online, scrolling through apps, mail, social media, and messaging. The hospital used a secure messaging system that had an indicator when the app was active, being used, and the provider was online/available. A text message came through, a little startling given the hour and that he wasn't at work. It was from Dan, the nurse, one of the more senior nurses, very competent. Experienced.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm not in a rush to leave just yet. You do realise, we both just want you --"
"They're bringing him out in a moment."
"Nothing!" Sherlock hissed back. "It was the way he told me, the demand. You saw his attitude, and ..." His words trailed off as John let out a short burst of laughter and Sherlock got indignant seeing John's amusement at his expense. "Stop it, this is not funny."
“And Mrs. Hudson is away.” John chuckled at Sherlock's protectiveness. "Here you go. The kids'll take care of her." Reluctantly, Mycroft huffed. "Sam, can you take the leash, make sure she gets settled?"
They pass a little bit of time discussing the visit from the interventional cardiologist, that John hadn't been present for, and that there was nothing further that was going to require their attention. Sherlock's oxygen level stays high, but he looks a bit more exhausted sitting out of bed. On a routine check in with Sheila, John mentions that he was probably going to step out for a little walk. "And I think he was looking to get back in bed when you have a moment."
- until another annoying, downright obnoxious coughing spasm interrupts his deductions. His ribs hurt, in the front, in the back, from coughing and it is acute, exquisite pain at the height of inspiration. When his keeps his breaths shallow and light, the pain is minimised.
"I do, yes." The handshaking is brief.
"We can manage this at home." He looks at the IV pump again, where the green light blinks slowly, infusing, infusing, infusing. "That is unnecessary." His fingers find a portion of the oxygen tubing that snakes around in his bed before slinking over his shoulder to the wall unit. "And you said it yourself, this can be obtained for home use."
"No, not really. I mean, Rosie's ... she's doing fine. You're the one seeing days that are ... just bad."
Ted chuckled then, a somewhat harsh sound. "Yes you are." He swatted at John's calf and earned another curse as a reward.
Attached to it was the codicil, the amendment, specifying Sameer's request for a legal name change.
"Because cinnamon, parsley, and sriracha on the risotto didn't seem too complimentary."
Slowly.
"No," John said carefully. "But we're all one family now, aren't we?"
"There's a car waiting," John said, quietly, beginning to lead the way down the steps.
He hears sweet reminders spoken quietly to him - We love you. Thank you.
The texts came in quick succession after that.
"I'm sorry you're in a bad patch."
"David Garrett."
Sherlock leans down, carefully not to catch his IV on anything, takes the blanket and spreads it over them both. John scoots closer to the edge of the recliner so that they are near enough to feel each other's body heat. The movie, the beer, the pretzels, and the blanket are a nice combination. It's not the sitting room on Baker Street, not like sitting near each other on their couch, but it is satisfying all the same. Although they only speak a little, the words aren't necessary to enjoy where they are. Despite the warmth of the blanket and the company, John feels the chill of the room in his feet, tucks his toes under Sherlock's pyjama-clad calves.
Taking the paper, John quickly perused the list. It included substance and alcohol abuse, having a concrete plan for suicide (and he could picture the times he either looked at or thought about his weapon), lethality of various means, insomnia, isolation, domestic violence, and human trafficking. There were a few tips and options about how to end a call, including more urgent suggestions such as calling back in one hour or following up the next day, to not being alone, to self-care. "All right. These look pretty complete actually."
