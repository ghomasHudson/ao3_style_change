Charlie was right. So, he probed, “Then, what do I do, Red?”
He focused on-
Oh how his heart melted. His heart and soul carried so much fondness for this tiny 3 year old. ‘It’ll be ok, big guy’ is something his little brother Sammy always repeatedly told him, and it seemed his little one had picked up on it. Sammy always reminded him that he was doing good as a single dad. He brushed aside a strand of his son’s sandy blonde hair that had fallen unto his little ones forehead, watching as his little one’s eye lids finally drooped fully shut, alseep at last.
“Nope, not God, Cas. Janes! And, they have been making the best damn burgers for nearly 20 years now. I used to come here a lot in high school”. Cas’ look of bliss was making his tummy flutter- Cas being happy, made him feel all tingly and full with pride.
Pam sighed, seeing that he would stand firm to his analysis. She got up and walked over to a golden chest, she opened it and pulled out a really expensive gold and white silk clothe, “Well you may believe what you want to, it is your free will. I’m just saying that I’ve never seen Dean dress his omega in expensive wear and provide them a platter of food after sex.” She held up the dress towards him, “I’m pretty sure he loves your scent too, kinda caught his nose buried into your neck while you were asleep, humming in delight and looking at you like you were the most adoring thing he has ever laid eyes on.”
Both Castiel and Gabriel greeted, “Good morning Kaylen.”
Castiel visited his brother’s grave straight after. He removed the old white roses, emptied the water inside the vase, filled the vase up with water from a bottle he had carried with him and refilled the vase with the 18 fresh white roses he had purchased.
“I’m sorry, Dean. But, Castiel is infertile. You will be taking up the Winchester Pack title in a few year time, but before that, you need an heir!”
Dean knew about this Craven dude.
Castiel shook his head, turning to meet his eyes with such kindness, “I would love for Kaylen to show me the bees and streams. It would certainly be an exciting adventure.”
Dr. Pamela Barns- one of Dean’s oldest friends- was more than happy to serve them.
In the tent of the alpha leader Dean, he waited with a beating heart, wondering when the green eyed alpha would come in, drunk off his ass and demand he strip and present like a good omega would. The alpha would take him, not so gentle at times, till the wolf came hard, howling and filling his womb with thick cum.
It’s been a week since his loss.
He already felt tears flooding his eyes, as he stood by the gravestone he so dearly yearned to see. His eyes taking in the fresh white roses placed in a crème colored vase, before Jimmy’s headstone. Someone had been visiting Jimmy’s grave and showering the teen with his favorite white roses.
It was too much.
Chuck who seemed to be looking quite scared, took a step back and stuttered in denial, “No! It’s all lies!”
He hoped his ancestors were with them. He needed their fighting spirit.
There was a
Gabriel shrugged, “Your boyfriend knows more than you think, Cassie. Maybe, you should ask him why he’s hiding that little piece of information from his BELOVED.”
The answer is
He started pinching off the label on his beer bottle. “He said a few things that sounded nice, then, he got a little…dismissive…then, well, he said more nice things. And then, the rest of the day went fine”.
Dean agreed. He would only perform or allow Cas to perform what is suitable to him.
Victory!
But, he refused to let it dictate his life. He wanted to be like my momma- caring, sweet, but at the same time, spoke her mind and demanded respect and equality.
And maybe, if he had been thinking with his upstairs brain, he would have taken the initiative to meet Jimmy’s twin. Maybe, he would have discovered love earlier.
Whereas Ellen sighed loudly, “If I knew you were both pains in the asses, I would have kicked both of your behinds to the moon. Jeez, you’re worse than girls who gossip and pups that throw tantrums over a piece of candy!” Obviously, Ellen had had enough, ordering, “Now, don’t make me kick both your asses out the council halls. NOT ANOTHER WORD OUTTA YOU TWO!”
Castiel’s eyes fell to the ground, nodding with so much obedience, “Ok alpha. I will fetch her for you”.
“Cassie, people will see a new establishment and want to give it a try. There’s nothing wrong with that. They’ll come back”.
That tongue. So flexible, so nasty, so desperate. The way Dean’s warm slippery muscle slid in and out of his tight hole, digging deeper, as if searching, had him on the brink of insanity. And then, that big alpha cock stretching his mouth- that was a strange feeling- but he loved it. He loved wrapping his tongue around Dean’s big cock, he loved sucking on Dean’s thick cockhead, he loved the taste of his alpha, he grew a little wilder with the drops of Dean’s precum on his tongue and when Dean finally came down his throat- he felt like a hungry wolf greedily swallowing his alphas essence- every drop heavenly.
- whom he knew was slumbering with the other Novak’s in the shed. He would wake her up, no foreplay, no kissing, just straight to burying himself into her wet, eager hole.
He knew in his heart, that his old friend’s final task had been completed.
Let me know what you think!🙂
. His alpha will see him and be filled with disgust, rage and hate. And, he wouldn’t blame the alpha for being upset and anguished. Not with what
He wondered what that felt like. He would always be wondering….
He rolled his eyes.
“YOU ARE A CHILD!”
Something was up with his little brother, something or someone had spooked Castiel that he looked white as a sheet begging to leave the engagement party. Yes, he was upset that Castiel couldn’t stay longer, I mean they just got there, but it was best they leave lest his little brother have a full blown panic attack.
Dean nodded but said nothing more.
He missed home. Mom’s apple pies and home cooked meals, dad’s great alpha stories and teachings, Sammy’s clinginess and love for all things vegetarian, and Cas snuggles, as well as, his stubbornness.
Soon, both lycan and vampire were losing themselves again in their heightened states of want and pleasure.
He found his surrogate father working under the hood of a fancy BMW. He didn’t give the man any warning; just stomped over to his surrogate dad and said rather harshly, “why didn’t you tell me that the damn accountant was Jimmy Novak’s twin brother?”
Everything was just…
Cas held him tight too, whispering, “Me too, Dean”. A minute later Cas asked him a question that both shocked him and made him want to crack up in laughter. The man asked, “Dean, does that mean you will love my car too and not burn it to a crisp?”
Anna narrowed her eyes, tapping her feet repeatedly into the ground. “I can have both! I want you as my mate too, Dean!”
He was spending more time alone now. He was spending more time with Sam. This only resulted in him getting more cranky with Dean.
Maybe?
The green eyed alpha nodded, smile a little saddened as he acknowledged so tenderly, “I saw, sweet omega, however, that doesn’t make you imperfect. In my eyes you will never be imperfect, I can promise you that.”
14 years of Dean by his side. 14 years of the alpha rooming right next to him. 14 years of shared laughter and heartache- and now, here they finally were.
“Thanks Sammy”. He added, “So, I gotta go, Sammy. I look forward to meeting you and your lovely fiancé tonight”.
Samuel grit his teeth, getting all up in his namesake/grandsons face. “I will do as I please! Your parents are dead, making me the sole guardian of you boys! You will obey me, Sam!”
Dean rubbed the side of his head affectionately into the side of Cas head.
In this chapter, Dean is speaking with his mouth, Cas is replying telepathically.
A beautiful papa Cas would make someday to their pups.
He looked forward to lunch with a man, he was sure, he loved.
Sadly, the rule of Council is law. The pack alphas come under the rule of Council, and have no say in their deliberating-
He knew what sex was because he lived in a small home, where things weren’t so private.
The green eyed alpha blushed light pink, rubbing the hairs on the nape of his neck, “Um- you’re really…beautiful, omega. You smell real good too.”
He shivered and finally released a whine as his alpha gripped his hips lightly, lips now whispering hot words into his ear with such gruffness. “Fuck Cas. You smell so good that I wanna eat you up.”
….He asked. “Why?”
Dean is around 9 years old in this chapter. Cas is 5 years old. Dean is in human form in this chapter, whilst, Cas is in his wolf form.
dad, with all this newfound information. He knew, it was all up to the Winchester Pack alpha to decide what their next steps would be. John would know what to do.
He couldn’t help it. His cheeks ached as he smiled lightly at Dean who returned a smiling wink.
Yeah, it didn’t really hit him, what he had asked Cas- until he was inside the garage- staring at a rusty Camaro that needed a complete overhaul. He swallowed hard and felt sweat begin to surface on his skin, he began pacing back and forth, mulling over the conversation with Cas a few minutes ago.
They all took long drags of their beers for that.
He was tired, he was sweating through his clothes, his feet felt like they were swollen by the time they reached their stop for the night. Luckily they weren’t traveling too fast and stopped for food and water along the way otherwise he would probably be dragged on the dirt because he wouldn’t be able to walk anymore.
This time it wasn’t Heather or Michael that answered. It was Cas. His omega looked at him with hope in those saddened blue eyes,
(damnit Sammy!). The omegas voice sounded in his head, “
Cas decided to turn his head towards him, eyes peering into his and whispering, “Nothings wrong, Dean. It’s just…I miss your warmth.”
Kaylen, the smart pup, knew not to ask much questions and made his way into the house. He on the other hand, was very terrified that he was frozen on the spot. Mary sensing his fear stood before him, reaching out for his hand and squeezing it lightly.
“Cassie, even if I hadn’t said anything or told Dean about the omega with the apple pie scent, I am positively sure that he would have still found you!” He shrugged and hugged Castiel once more, “He would have followed his alpha nose- they are very sensitive to smell big bro. That’s why alpha noses are so ginormous.”
“Three guesses who?” Cas half teased, half giggled.
Yeah, these feelings were getting serious after the revelation with John, Mary and Sam.
Cas sounded wise in his words.
In his heart, he knew that Jimmy was his past.
Bobby, in his shock, smacked the top of his head against the hood. He groaned, pressing a palm into the sore spot, “Ow boy! Don’t scare an old man like that!”
Cas pushed, so, he pushed back.
. It was only for the safety of Castiel and his own lycan family. Lycan’s were more forgiving but vampires despised his kind and would effortlessly start a war. He answered, “Not some random vampire dad. He's my boyfriend".
Gabe really didn’t like Anna. He chuckled and shrugged, “She’s wasting her time. Dean only has eyes for one omega now.”
The setting was beautiful, chairs filled up with Winchester Pack wolves. They were all under a huge tree, on a sunny cloudless day. Gabe and Sam sat at the very front beaming happily at him and….Dean….he had to gulp, his heart beat slowly climbing as he took in the beautiful man smiling in a handsome black tux- up in the very front- in the middle of it all.
I hope you enjoy this chapter. And, I hope I still got it...hehe.
Castiel was getting under his skin, pretty damn quick, and, he despised it!
It was quiet for a while. He just studied Gabe: the man looking like he wanted to say something more and in deep contemplation. This was a familiar habit he saw every year before Gabe attended the annual meet- it saddened him, because he knew what Gabe was going to ask him- the same question the younger wolf would ask him every year.
He couldn’t wait for his own wedding day when he would officially become bound to Sam. But, first the oldest Winchester son shall have his special day- as is the tradition or custom of wolves. His glory and shine will come next week.
- then, damn….fate really had a way of toying with people before the big reveal.
The pool balls scattered and he managed to pocket a stripe pool ball. He grinned, “Yours is the solid pool ball. Go on. Take a hit. Give it a try”.
An omega who was one of the lucky few to be blessed with a career of being a Lawyer.
Both lay panting, cuddling and sharing sweet kisses. Castiel loved listening to Dean’s heartbeat and feeling the man’s warmth against him. He thumbed at his lovers nipple. “I don’t want us to ever end, Dean”.
Lucifer put his hands up, “Sorry Dean! Just wanted to fuck with the loser!”
Those words only broke his heart further. His happy and content bubble, that included him and Dean, was slowly breaking.
He felt so giddy with love, he murmured, “You’re welcome, Dean. Now, let’s enjoy some home cooked meal.”
For a moment, he stood stunned on the spot.
The pup loved to climb into his bed-
Dean knew that the consummation of their mating could take place later, in private, but, the bite was important to be sighted by the alpha leaders of a pack as they would bare witness to this union. So, he turned his green wolf eyes to meet his omegas blues,
Sam and Gabriel’s engagement party was the perfect opportunity to introduce himself back into the Winchester Pack, offer the couple his well wishes and look out for his sweet Castiel. If he was there that is, if not, he would have to locate Castiel, hopefully crossing his fingers that the omega was still around and mateless.
Dean eyed him with a thankful smile; there was so much adoration bouncing off those green orbs. The man grabbed his hand that was rested atop the table, bringing it to those pouty lips and giving his knuckle a gentle kiss. “Thank you, Cas. This is perfect and smells heavenly. I can’t wait to try this delicious meal”.
“How I feel doesn’t matter, Dean.” For the first time, Cas dropped his stubborn façade, glancing down at the floor in what looked like sadness. The omega murmuring, “Like I said she is your girlfriend.”
A/N: I hope you enjoyed the read. I’d like to thank all my readers for giving this fic a chance! You are my inspiration- ALWAYS!🙂
“I’m sorry son. It was wrong on my part not to tell you”.
Cas face scrunched up in disbelief, “I can’t believe I haven’t come here before! Christ, I’m such a recluse!”
He was startled out of his depressive thoughts when a series of soft knocks on his bedroom door sounded. His little brother entered the room, meeting his eyes through the mirror. “Cassie, mom and dad says to come down to the gardens. Our mates are almost here.”
Charlie and Dorothy were so in love, always doting on the other. It was kinda funny, seeing as they completely loathed each other in their high school days. Well, somehow, they had matured and finally ran into each other again at a LARP event. This time, Charlie bucked up and asked Dorothy out….and the rest they say is history.
He knew that there were no other options but this.
Dean chuckled, lowering his head and nudging the pups tummy lightly with his nose in greeting. The pup caught his snout playfully between the soft pads of his paws. Dean’s alpha purred in adoration. This pup was orphaned, both parents meeting a tragic end, just a few weeks after his birth. John had taken it upon himself to raise the kid as a Winchester. The pup, an omega, had grown on Sam and Dean. Dean definitely felt protective of the little one. And it seemed the little one had developed much more cheekiness towards Dean.
Sam…..Sam, on the other hand, despised Bal and kept pestering him to tell Dean that he was now dating an alpha. Sam always defended his big brother Dean, trying to push the fact that Dean couldn’t come home in the last 2 years because his
He swallowed thickly, eyes bashfully looking at a couple just a few feet from them, who were full on engaged in passionate intercourse, where the completely naked female omega was riding her equally exposed alpha whilst seated on that muscular lap- not a care in the world for anyone around them.
Dean held out a hand, drawling out, “Come on then, gorgeous.”
“Alright. Great!” Charlie eyed him with those eyes that stated ‘
. He sat up straighter, “Did they hurt you!?” Instinct kicked in above all else.
They were too into their own need to get off, that they didn’t hear the deep rumble of a classic car pulling into the driveway of the Winchester house, nor the sound of the front door opening, nor the deep yet young alpha voice calling ‘
Mary pitched in, “Oh sweetheart, no. You are allowed to spend time with your girlfriend. You have that freedom to do so, however, your time has to be shared with others who also love you. Do you understand where I’m coming from, honey?”
. Again, Mary wasn’t one to mince her words, asking, “You sure the bond is just brotherly, boys?”
He met his dads saddened gaze, “But?”
He could only muster a barely audible, “Good night, Dean.”
Do leave a comment and kudos if you want. Stay safe and take care ❤️
In his heart, he already knew the best solution to this whole situation- but that would be for Cas and Dean to decide if/when they felt ready to.
John kissed the top of his wife’s head, breathing in her rose scented shampoo that lingered in her blonde curls. “Of course my love. Our son knows that we love him and that we will respect his chosen one.”
Some watched in intense enjoyment whilst fondling their mates, some were making out intensely, some were just grinding fully clothed or bare breasted to the drumming tribal music. It was a little too much sexual energy for him than he was used to. Guess, this is the normal in any barbarian celebration where all were presumedly drunk and horny.
(He really wished he hadn’t had to call his dad to get Dean out of a 24-hour holding cell because the man still hadn’t let it go and it had been almost a year.)
Stiles was happy that it meant he wouldn’t have any downtime while in Beacon Hills.
But then Scott messaged him asking what the section on mermaids said in one of the texts and Stiles realized, well, fuck, guess they still needed him to work for them after all.
Stiles grinned, listening to Derek fall apart over the phone, hearing him touching himself while he did the same. Stiles egged Derek on, getting him to comment more about what he wanted to do, how it would feel, and Stiles could almost imagine he was the one there having Derek under his fingertips.
“Okay, fine, we are cuddling.” Stiles frowned, pushing himself down further in his bed so his head laid on his pillow, looking up at the ceiling. “I did something stupid.”
It was
“And when were you going to tell me?”
and hated celebrating birthdays (his own or others).
“Unless you expect me to mash a pot and pan together for an hour straight, I don’t know why you’re calling me for help.” Sam sighed, rolling his eyes at his brother’s melodrama when he caught Stiles’ eyes from across the room.
“How’s it going, kid?”
Derek’s smile matched the Sheriff’s, “Don’t look at me, I’m looking forward to it.”
Still, he stuck around, taping up boxes while he watched Sam and Stiles unmix their belongings and all of the items they had accumulated in three short years of living in the house. John was happy Stiles had met a nice enough guy his freshman year, that he had made friends easily, but damn if he didn’t wish Sam could’ve had a brother who was also pursuing law and didn’t live a vagabond life to pull his own son into.
He was leaning against the wall outside their room, thumbing through the comments on the band’s Instagram, when the sound of the police cruiser pulling in caught his attention. He shot a quick message off to Cas:
“They do that to everyone,” he commented, glancing towards Erica and Lydia. “Whenever Lydia’s back in town, they start ganging up on everyone else.”
“It’s great to finally meet you guys,” Stiles shook his hand with a grin. He leaned against the counter from where he sat, “What I really wonder is if you guys can actually live up to the stories Sam’s been telling.”
Looking back, Stiles should have realized having their band play in Jungle, intersecting the known gay club clientele with the unexpected and unpredictable punk scene was an obvious recipe for success, because the things Dean and Cas were doing on stage was nothing that the dance floor of Jungle hadn’t already seen.
“And I already told you, Dean didn’t
“Wouldn’t be the first time we had a genderbend performance.” Dean remarked from where he sat on the floor.
Stiles rolled his eyes at the moniker Dean used, but joined them. He leaned back, fingers tapping against his knees, pulling at the ripped strands of denim along the fraying edges against his knees. “Killer set tonight,” Stiles commented.
“Dude, I don’t have a crush on the guy,” Stiles yelled. Sam laughed, turning around in his chair, laughing harder at the face of sheer embarrassment on Stiles’ face.
Stiles wasn’t sure if Derek was actually okay with the sudden addition of phone sex, but he hadn’t complained, or hung up on Stiles, every time he called after getting back from their sets the rest of the time they were in Oregon. By the sounds of things, he was getting off just as much as Stiles from it, anyway.
For all the jokes, Stiles wasn’t actually all that mad about it. He liked watching the ink on his arms flex with his muscles as they strengthened.
By the end of the show, Isaac and Scott ended up joining Erica and Boyd down in the pit, making Stiles wonder if Scott’s wolfsbane booze blend was put into their drinks that they had been ordering all night. It would make sense; Derek becoming a local bartender, local pack finally getting a way to take part in normal behavior like getting intoxicated out in bars. If he really thought about it, he might actually say the idea was near genius.
Stiles sat in the jeep, door swung open and feet resting on the side ledge as he continued scrolling. He liked his dad’s message, the blue thumbs up highlighting the message. He had a message from Scott with a picture attached. Looks like their band flyer was being reshared by the venue hosting their gig:
Stiles’ eyes were bleary as he watched the looped video, saving it to his phone before clicking send and tapping at the list of available friends. It was pretty much everyone who was already here, but then he saw Derek’s name in his list, and stopped. He had totally forgotten about last winter, when Derek had finally broken down and gotten the app after pestering from both Stiles and Erica. He figured the guy would’ve deleted him by now. He grinned toothily, checking off Derek’s name, and sending the looping video to everyone at once.
“Holy Hell. Where’d you learn to talk like that?” Dean questions looking at the spent angel.
He feels the body stir but then it falls limp again.
“I've been trying to contact you for the past fucking week, that's what! You only seem to come around when you and your damn angel friends need help. What about us? We need your help too, Cass!” Dean says looking over at the dark haired man.
After having the shirt removed, Cass starts to unbuckle his belt, having trouble with it, having never needed to take it off before.
“I will be out as soon as my vessel dries.” Cass simply answers, not meeting Dean's eyes.
“Shit, Cass!” Dean gasps out as his head falls back, hips thrusting up into the angel's hands.
“You okay in there, dude?” Dean's voice rings in from the other side of the door.
“No, you're fine, Cass. We were just talking about you. Nothing bad, though. Here, sit down and eat.” Sam says, pushing out the chair next to Dean with his foot.
“When I was...unconscious....I thought I heard you...” Cass trails off, looking down at his hands.
“I have never taken a shower. I do not know what to do.” He replies, not meeting the other man's eyes.
“In a minute sweetheart. just enjoy how this feels.” Dean leans down to suck Cass’ cock into his mouth as he adds the third finger.
“Thank you. But why were you talking about me? Have I done something wrong?” Cass questions, looking at Dean, who refused to meet his gaze.
“What?” Dean's eyebrows rise as he looks at the boy.
They both watch Sam leave the room, and finish eating in silence. After eating, Dean goes and turns the TV on, sitting at the end of his bed, not really watching it. Cass shifts nervously, still sitting at the small table.
“Fill me up, Dean. Cum in my ass.” Cass demands before reaching for his overstimulated cock.
Dean watches Cass’ eyes go wide as his cock twitches and erupts between them, cum splattering up Cass’s chest with a little landing on his chin. Dean leans  down to lick his chin clean before shoving his tongue into his mouth.
“He was supposed to be protected. God needed him for a very important mission. However, the demons got to him before we could. He is too tainted now. We can no longer use him. You have to kill him.” Castiel says walking over and putting a hand on the boy's shoulder.
Walking over to the boy, Dean meets his eyes, a silent apology hidden beneath all the pain. Bringing the knife up to the boy's heart, he lets a small tear roll down his face.
Dean moans loudly as his hips stutter with his release, feeling Cass’ hole clench down on his dick as Cass cums again. They’re both panting hard as Dean slowly pulls out and falls to the bed next to the angel.
“I'm sorry, Tyler.” Dean says before plunging the knife into the boy's heart and wrapping a hand around the boy's back to keep him from falling.
“Dean.” Cass whispers against the hunter's lips, opening his eyes to find green orbs looking back into his own in question. “You’re wearing too much clothing. I find it offensive.” He says a glint of lust undiluted in his eyes.
“Nothing, I must have imagined it. Where is Sam?” The angel asks, looking around the room.
“No need to be grumpy. I'm no threat to you. I just came to talk. It's about your brother.” The boy says, stepping closer to Dean, his face dropping into a sad expression.
“You're sorry? Well, that just makes me feel so much better!” Dean yells, slamming his hands down on the roof of the car.
Cass feels his heart swell with love and adoration at this new, gentle, more caring side of the hunter he's rapidly falling in love with. He's unable to speak because of the love he feels so he nods his head 'yes'.
“Feel good Cass?” Dean asks, nibbling on the hardening bud as his hands glide over Cass' sides.
“Why the hell would you, a demon, care about that?” Dean asks, his voice low, thoughtful.
“He went out to get food and coffee. He'll be back in a few.” Dean says standing up, grabbing the clothes he had asked Sam to set out, handing them to Castiel.
“Sammy, I'm bringing Cass back to the room. I need you to get the first aid kit out and ready. I also need you to take out my sweat pants and my gray tee shirt. Thanks, we'll be there in a few.” Dean says starting the car and speeding down the street.
“Why? Oh right. Yea, if you have trouble with anything, let me know. If I need to come in, I promise. I won't look.” Dean says, feeling blush leak into his features.
“So are you.” Dean replies before tugging the gray shirt he had let Cass wear, up over his head.
“What? If you're helping us, why would I kill you? You're just a kid.” Dean whispers the last part.
“What do you think I said and why is it impossible?” Dean requests.
“I love you too, Dean.” Cass smiles before sitting up and pulling Dean off the bed.
“Usually I'm strong enough I can just make myself clean. But I do not have the strength for that at this time.” Castiel says, dropping the clothes on the sink.
“Dean, I'm not sure what to do next.” Cass whispers; ashamed of being so inexperienced.
“I am in pain. But it is not too bad. My angel 'mojo', as you put it, is speeding up my healing process.” He says taking the water handed to him and guzzling it.
Cass pushes Dean's pants down only to see that Dean isn't wearing anything under them. This makes Cass' breath catch, his hand acting on its own as he wraps his fingers around Dean's long, thick erection.
Which was why Dean was drinking from his flask with a laugh—Stiles assumed it was whiskey, based on the smell on Dean’s breath when they passed each other cables and set up their equipment on the stage at Jungle. Dean would argue he didn’t drink to get fucked up, but the dude definitely liked being cross faded more often than not.
“Stiles.”
“Then stop acting like some groupie, they’re so annoying.” Sam huffed, directing his attention back to his open text at his desk. The new semester hadn’t started yet, but syllabi were being posted, and Sam was getting a head start on his reading.
“Dean and Cas,” he replied freely, “they’re just checking in.”
Derek huffed, smiling as he watched Stiles pull up the document. “Go ahead.”
Late into Saturday night, Derek had (finally) sent Stiles a photo back when they ended the call, and it took everything in him not to try and screenshot and save the picture of Derek’s chest, the white strips of come drying on his lower half. Stiles quickly took a forward facing photo, his hand tugging at his hair, biting his lip, his face honestly frozen after seeing what Derek had sent him.
“Ass.” Stiles huffed. “Fine, why are you a bartender at a gay club?”
part of their name, seeing as how Dean hadn’t had the time to go on a hunt in over a year. The guy had messed his hair up in retaliation, reminding Stiles that you never actually leave the life, but they all understood the sentiment.
“I need this more than you,” Stiles pulled the pen out of Dean’s hands, taking a couple deep hits before handing it back to Castiel, mumbling thanks as he jumped down from the stage for a second time.
“Our audience has grown,” Castiel remarked, threading his fingers through Dean’s hair, a calming gesture Stiles had come to recognize.
“Nope. Nope, nope, nope.” Stiles shook his head. “We are not having this conversation. We are going back to the station, I am driving to meet up with Cas and Dean, and after I color my hair hot fucking pink, I’m going to go bang my brains out on the drums.” He looked up at dad, “You got a problem with that?”
“Who you smiling about, back there?” Erica teased, eyeing his phone cautiously.
Stiles pulled the door of the building open harder than he probably needed to, frowning when he looked at the person manning the front desk. He had no idea who they were. Stiles frowned harder, trying to remember a time when he
Stiles nodded, stepping away from where Derek had stood closely next to him, fingers flexing from where he had shoved them into his front pockets. He walked up to Scott, nudging him with his shoulder. “So, what do you guys get up to on pack nights, anyway?”
Stiles grinned, leaning back in his seat, listening to his dad intently while eating his way through a second order of fries. Maybe things were going to get better.
“We really gotta stop meeting like this,” Stiles grumbled, frowning at the smirk Derek sent his way as he heard the comment. He walked over, leaning against the table edge instead of climbing on top like Castiel and Stiles had.
Stiles would remind his dad that, no, being a parttime drummer in a punk band didn’t make him a
“I agree.” She stopped, pulling a flask out of her back pocket, “Which is why I liberated my own stash.”
Stiles had stayed relatively quiet during the ride, fingers twitching where they tapped out rhythms against his denim-covered knees, closing his eyes and reliving the last couple of hours as best he could. He had finally looked up after they had been seated with menus and waters covering the table. He turned to Jess and Sam, “Did you guys catch any of that on your phones?”
The first time it happened, Stiles woke to lazy kisses from Derek, him dotting the line where his shoulders connect with his neck, only to remember he hadn’t told the guys where’d he’d gone off to and, judging by how lit up the room was, they were going to have to meet up sooner than later before their final night in town for the week.
“But you’re so cool, dude!” Stiles stood up, ignoring the unpleasant
Before Stiles could call them out on their bullshit, twisting his back to stretch, he noticed Derek watching him carefully. “What, man? I showered at Erica’s when she did my hair so I know I don’t still smell like ass.”
The loft may be pack, but this was his scene.
While contemplating who, if anyone, he could call to drown his sorrows with, his phone pinged with a notification from Erica. It was a quick snap, her flipping off the coffee shop sign as it hung behind her, clearly ending her shift from the morning now that the lunch hour was over. They didn’t talk much, but their snap streak
to connect his phone to the speaker system, sound more distorted than right most days. It’s not his fault he didn’t know his phone was blowing up during the first three hours he spent on the road, catching the list of notifications only when he stopped to fuel up. Erica and Lydia had replied, as expected, but they apparently forwarded the message to the others. Including Scott. And his dad.
Erica rolled her eyes, “Anything that guy does makes me want to jump his bones.”
Cas leaned back, eyeing his handiwork and adding more smudges to one eye to even out the look. “Is it? Sam travels with us, and he travels home. I will travel with Gabriel back home. But you never do.”
They were unpacking, back in the same motel they had been in the last time they played at Jungle, when Stiles looked over at Dean and Castiel. “I think we need to call Meg.” They both paused what they were doing; Stiles hadn’t mentioned needing a replacement since before graduating.
Stiles sat up, eyes wide, “Don’t touch my desk!”
now.”
“And you’re
Stiles ignored the two, pushing past to give Jess a hug. “You’ve made us into stars,” he mumbled against her hair.
They were driving back to the same motel from before, with Gabriel agreeing to bunk with Stiles like they had dozens of times during past trips. Stiles was sure Gabe would end up spending just as many nights out of their room as he did in it, as he was often known to.
“Are you trying to be a comedian, Derek?” Stiles finally said, laughter dying off and glaring at Derek with renewed passion. “Because that was one sick fucking joke.”
“Hey, you can’t—” the guy stood up, trying to block Stiles’ access. Luckily for them both, John stepped out just as Stiles pulled on the door.
At least it wasn’t a video of him dancing on the table or giving Scott a lap dance.
.” Castiel stared at him in response until Stiles gave it up. “Fine. No more weed or tequila, I’ll be a good boy.”
Stiles grinned, leaning back against the wall, with his body half tilted towards Derek’s. When Derek let go of his wrist, Stiles grabbed hold of his side, pulling their bodies closer together. He looked up at Derek, nearly level with each other, his grin turning feral the longer they stared at each other. Sense memory was a bitch, even with the crossfade he had going on, and Stiles felt a sense of déjà vu when Derek’s breath ghosted over his mouth like it had four years prior.
The yells from the crowd egged them on.
It wasn’t fun.
“Bless you both.” Stiles grumbled, resurfacing with eyes barely squinted open to retrieve the offered items. After taking a second swig of the water, he stretched out his limbs and looked down.
up there. Stiles sometimes thought he turned into a different guy when he was on stage. Nothing crazy, just more alive.
“Nobody makes Lydia do anything,” Stiles corrected.
These ladies were drinking steamy hot vaginas and Stiles screenshotted every single one sent his way.
She rolled his eyes at his comment, but nodded anyway, “Glad you remembered.” She stood up, pulling a platter leftover from the party from the fridge to snack on, putting it down between them on the island counter.
. He didn’t want to hide things from him, but according to Scott he was worried if he brought it up too much, Stiles would stop answering.
, which turned into them playing
Turns out, Stiles was the only one shocked about the recent developments between him and Derek. Dean had practically thrown him over the bar when Stiles mentioned he was going to hang back and wait for Derek to close up after their second night back at Jungle, yelling at him to finally
By the time they had finished, Stiles could hear Derek’s ragged breathing over the line.
?” When Stiles shoved against his shoulder, he laughed. “You just told me you’re staying in town and planning to cut down on the time spent on the road. I’m not arguing with you.”
No fears or worries, just him and the music and the crowd.
“This was a trap,” Stiles muttered.
Stiles shoved the phone back into his pocket before climbing in.
“A damn good bribe, at that.” John laughed, eating his own burger with a smile. “You forgot how good they were, didn’t you?”
“Kid, I have a spoon, and I know how to use it,” Gabriel teased, raising the wooden utensil in question.
John stared at Stiles for a moment before answering, “We both remember what happened last time I came to one of your shows, Stiles.”
Sometimes the towns they went through had a local pack or supernatural presence and the guys were used to being stopped by local representatives telling them to back out, leave, because they were causing too much of a disturbance to the peace with their shenanigans.
Sam may be right, he could be over-assuming and being paranoid, but something didn’t feel right this time around. Stiles decided not to push it, wanting to give Scott the benefit of the doubt and tell him on his own. He just hoped it would come out sooner than later.
He grinned wider. Maybe next time.
“He did ask if I had taken you to get an anti-possession tattoo yet.” Sam looking up from his computer.
he saw it and felt it, but he let the guy give himself blue balls.
“Uh, yeah, glad we’re not playing phone tag,” Stiles mumbled.
He liked having extra money more.
Stiles’ eyes narrowed as he listened, “Pretty sure you had my number, man. And email. And if you didn’t have the balls to let me know, you know I was still talking to Scott on the regular.”
“Exactly.” Stiles agreed, leaning back. He scrolled back to the top of the page, where a new post caught his eye. It was one of their flyers, with some of their upcoming dates in southern California listed. He scrolled to the next image, where snaps of the different band members were cut together. He hadn’t thought about being part of a band in years, probably since he first started messing around with drumming only to find out Scott was completely tone deaf and had no chances of learning guitar, but he liked the group they had. They would rotate through players, depending on where in the country they were or the time of year. It made playing on the road while working on getting his degree fit together perfectly. “Look dad, we have some gigs later this month down here.”
to remember me by.”
“What did you do to him?” Jess questioned from where they stood in the doorway.
After the years of fighting off the forces of evil and attempting to maintain some normalcy in their teenage lives, Stiles shouldn’t have been surprised by how well him and Erica got along, but then she did shit like this and it made him question most of everything. She had shoved a bag of frozen treats into the kitchen freezer, grabbing one pint and two spoons before making her way upstairs to join Stiles in his room. She threw the spoon onto his chest, forcing his body to make room for hers without pause. Stiles had wordlessly pulled out his computer and they watched B-Horror movies without a word spoken until they made it halfway through the second film.
“Does this mean we’re cool?” Sam asked cautiously.
Well.
For as icy as Stiles had been to Derek since he got back into town, the man barely looked like it phased him. Stiles wondered if that came with being a bartender. He was mixing drinks, pouring beers for their friends, and soon time passed quickly enough that Stiles was back on the stage, drumming through a mix of their songs while Dean tested the acoustics and sound mixing. They didn’t practice outside of gig warmups, and sometimes they ended up jamming more than playing the written tracks, especially when Stiles got to play alongside Crowley, but the crowd ate it up. They let the energy of the group and the venue guide how they played – Jess always complained it made marketing their sound harder, but Stiles loved it. They couldn’t be captured on a CD, reproduced for mass consumption. You had to be there for the live performance, and every one after that, because no two were alike.
“I heard that!” Dean hollered over.
He sat there, tapping the bottom of the shot glass from where he had flipped it over, leg bouncing from where it set resting on the edge of the bar stool. Derek watched the fidgeting hand movements before glancing up at Stiles. Before Stiles could say anything else, Dean was yelling at him to
Stiles groaned before thumbing through his screen. He was still getting notifications from the band’s account, but he went past all of them to find a message from Jess. She had been watching Isaac’s posts as they came out and freaking
“That
Erica and Boyd stopped, looking at him and then back at each other. Boyd sighed, crossing his arms over his chest, pointedly looking at Erica to explain.
“That happen a lot where you come from?”
“Thanks for the payment,” Isaac grinned, pulling out the forgotten phone without delay. “Shit’s been blowing up, man.”
“Like you weren’t going to spend it laying around, getting high.”
Jess laughed, shaking her head, “That’s all you guys.” She sat back against the bed next to where Stiles had left his bag open. “June’s almost completely booked up.”
“Stiles—”
“This your mix, too?” Stiles asked.
“I didn’t have an answer for you a week ago, what makes you think I’ve got it figured out now?”
He translated the text. Because of course he still cared to know that the pack was doing okay, cares about what Erica, and Scott, and everyone else is getting up to. If the only way he could do that was by translating random things Derek sent his way, then he would suck it up and do it.
dad,” Stiles muttered, sitting up in the chair. He glanced at his phone, noticing it was still mid-morning. “I’m still at Lydia’s.”
“Uh,” Stiles squinted as he looked out the window, “No, not in a couple years.”
“Thanks guys,” Stiles grinned. “I’ll call Jess so we can plan it out. Between Meg and Benny, we should be able to work it out so you don’t miss out on any of the gigs.” He pulled out his phone, pressing on Jess’s name to make the call.
“There’s the spirit,” Dean grinned, knocking shoulders with Stiles as they walked in.
“Benny the vampire,” John remarked coldly.
Enough trips on the road, sharing homes with Dean and Sam, and Stiles had heard this conversation plenty of times that he started to wonder if it was scripted. Stiles saw the influence Dean and Sam’s dad had on him, the way they lined salt across the entrance to every place they ever stayed. After a particularly bad trip, Dean was acting more paranoid than usual, and dumped an entire container in a circle around their tent.
“Why isn’t he just giving it to you?” Stiles asked cautiously.
It’s not like he came out here tonight with the plan to completely shatter whatever idea of normalcy they had gotten for themselves, but Stiles was damned if he wasn’t going to at least try and make a point that just because he was gone didn’t mean he wasn’t still on top of his shit.
“Seriously? Dude,” Sam tugged down the collar of his shirt. “Keeps things from possessing you.”
“And the pay is double,” Jess added, frowning at Dean with her arms crossed.
“Did he tell you to make the call?” Stiles asked.
After a couple quick fake outs, Gabriel did manage to catch Stiles and swatted at his arm with the spoon just as the oven timer went out. “You’re lucky.”
The crowd ate it up.
Stiles drew the pillow back, holding Erica’s in a firm look, “No, Erica, he did not kiss me, he did not show any reciprocation of my feelings, and pulled me out the house before shutting the door in my face.”
“Isaac,” he started, “thanks for shooting tonight.”
“Tips are better.” The grin turned into a smirk, “Clientele, too.”
“And best burgers.” Stiles commented, watching his dad cautiously.
Stiles shot off the messages to the girls like he had planned, and opened up his email. He didn’t realize he was holding his breath until he let it out when he saw Derek’s response.
Dean didn’t respond besides liking his message. Cas sent him a separate message, wishing him luck. Stiles grinned down at his phone, happily reminded yet again why he loved doing the shit they did together.
strategies that guys had helped him get a hold of.
“Yeah, yeah, I heard Dean,” Sam started after taking Dean off of speaker. “No, I am not going to give him the Dean Makeover Experience. You fuckers can do that.” He rolled his eyes, “Yes I’ll come to the show. I’ll bring Jess too. Bye Dean.” A pause, “Yeah, man, I love you too.”
“Good morning, Stiles,” Lydia’s voice interrupted his momentary panic. She sat beside him at the kitchen island. “Have fun?”
“Fine.” Dean relented, “But don’t say I didn’t warn you guys if everything goes straight to hell.”
Erica turned to Stiles quickly before looking back towards the other two.
“Why do you need to know Latin, Stiles?” Sam asked cautiously. It was true, one time he walked in while Stiles was muttering to himself in the dead language, and Sam had caught enough of a snippet that he repeated it in English, much to Stiles’ surprise. It was something they hadn’t brought up again, though.
“You weren’t so bad yourself,” Dean’s voice rang out as he and Cas walked into the room, both grabbing waters from the table. Stiles barely noticed the change in their clothes, zippers half down and hair even more blown out than before. Him and Sam had become so desensitized to their fucking he barely acknowledged a change anymore. “You were kicking ass out in that crowd.”
Maybe he didn’t want Stiles bringing the cops to the shows, after all.
Cas hummed, “We don’t play gigs down in Kansas, still.”
and fuck around.”
“Have I told you lately that I love you,” Dean crooned, grabbing both sides of Jess’s face to plan a kiss on her forehead.
“That’s rude.” Stiles frowned, tugging Erica over.
“Did you tell them about this?” Sam asked.
John had traveled back to Beacon Hills after the week had come to a close. Jess and Sam were traveling down the coast to visit her family (“Again, she’s taking time off the band to see
Compared to the first meal they shared, and the dozens of phone calls over the years, Stiles actually felt like this was the first time they sat and talked, no cut off arguments about what Stiles was doing with his life because for once neither of them brought it up. John mentioned how, at the weekly Rotary Club meeting, the local business owners were talking about the recent uptick in business. Stiles grinned, his dad finally starting to see how what they did was about more than just
Stiles had tried bringing up the show to Scott over their next video call, but his best friend didn’t quite catch the enthusiasm that Stiles was sharing. He nodded, listening, but Stiles could tell something was off. When he tried to push it, Scott only shrugged off his concern.
“Big mean Latin books.” Stiles muttered, resting his head down again. “No good grumpy werewolves need translations. Can’t show you guys, though. No, no, no. Even if you know Latin better than me.” He looked back up at Sam, “Hey! Sam! Can you do me a favor? I need you to teach me Latin.”
Dean shot him a message back pretty quickly:
Stiles realized he couldn’t tug at his hair after he finishing spiking it up, tapping his foot incessantly while he surrounded his eyes in the signature smudged liner look. By the third pace he did around the small room, Gabriel shoved him towards the bathroom, pushing the wooden box of rolled joints into his hands, “And don’t come out until you’ve jerked off at least once and hot boxed the damn room!”
“We are not
“Because you don’t kill your own pack, dude.” Stiles rolled his eyes before stopping.
.” Sam remarked, standing back before turning in the open door to look back at Gabriel.
Just as August was starting, they had traveled back down to Louisiana, the heat of the summer making Stiles sweat even with the jeep’s air conditioning blasting. He had learned some towns and venues were the equivalent of a one-night stand for the guys, and then there were other venues that expected them back as naturally as the seasons changed. Down in Louisiana, where Dean’s buddy Benny lived, was one of those places. Several venues coordinated a gig schedule with Jess months in advance, and sometimes Stiles wondered if they booked the rest of their shows and travel plans around those ones.
With the amount of teaching Sam had done, and the amount of translating Stiles had to practice, he didn’t bother asking the guy for help for these ones. Both of them had semester-end projects coming up, then finals, and Stiles knew Sam was interviewing for internships and studying extra for the LSATs. Him and Jess had already told Dean they weren’t going to be around much that summer, and Stiles was thankful Jess spent so much time pre-planning their tours for that year. He meant it when he told Jess he was going to consider his work like an internship, giving it his all, because he really did need the work experience and he was glad to be doing it for something he loved.
“Looks like you’re going to have to leave them begging for more,” Castiel leaning forward in his perch on Dean, grin feral.
They ended in the familiar rhythm of the song, with Stiles hitting his kick drum with three sharp beats, as Dean bit into Castiel’s mouth, a sharp tug at Cas’s hair as they moved with more tongue and spit than any regular kiss. Cas tugged at Dean’s tongue, his stud clicking against his teeth as he pulled. They held their foreheads together, bent towards each other as Castiel let the final chord ring out.
Erica had sent several of the photos to her phone from Dean’s before saving her number in his contacts. “Next time Stiles play a show with you guys and decides his friends don’t need to know about it, give a girl a ring, would you?” She handed the phone back over with a soft throw.
“They planned this,” Stiles argued, standing up and walking out onto the porch. Derek followed behind him, closing the door softly behind them.
.” Stiles muttered to himself, pulling his phone out of his pocket. He had shot Scott a message, but his best friend said he was working a double shift at the vet clinic and wouldn’t be around for a round of games until the next night. Stiles considered who else he could call. Technically, all of his friends were packmates. And while they had all grown closer since sophomore year, he still wasn’t exactly buddy-buddy with pretty much anyone else.
Stiles sighed, “I have an hour, tops, before I need to head to the motel. My gear’s still in the jeep and I haven’t done my hair yet.”
Isaac grinned wide, clearly thriving under the praise. Stiles gripped his shoulder before turning back towards the room. Just as he turned, Dean grabbed him from around the shoulders and hollered in greeting. “Why the
“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me.” He stared down at his phone, glaring at the map to show him any other area. He fired off a text to Dean:
“Someone has to keep you out of trouble,” She smirked before pulling back.
“You remember your lease is ending soon,” John added.
He could’ve sworn he was only asleep for ten minutes when the sound of his phone ringing forced him awake. He blearily looked at the time—
Stiles was pacing around the living room in the rebuilt Hale house. He had been staring at Derek, eyes piercing, as he rambled, not letting Derek stop him from getting this out. He had been ignoring what seemed like the most obvious
“Castiel,” He stated, looking at Stiles with a firm stare, holding out his own hand.
“Well damn,” Stiles muttered, pocketing his phone so he could go pay for the hair color. While camped out in the motel’s bathroom, hair processing, Stiles pulled his phone out again, ready to send a snap of the process to Erica and Lydia, already planning his debate about blondes having more fun, when he saw the notification from Derek still sitting, unopened.
“You can see the stage from the streets. No way are they gonna let us do our regular set.” Dean leaned back in his seat, frowning.
“I’m sure Derek loved that.” Stiles dropped his head to rest on his arms where they sat folded on the counter.
“It’s good to have you back.”
“And where did he run off to?”
“So, what, we go ride around town and pretend shit isn’t weird?”
Stiles would say the biggest surprise of the holiday was Derek driving down to celebrate with them, but Sam proposing to Jess took the cake.
As they drove through Grand Rapids, Stiles sketched out mini replications of the books currently sitting in his backpack. Sam laughed when he looked over and saw the images before turning his eyes back to the road, driving the jeep after Stiles’ six-hour turn had ended. “You serious?”
Stiles laughed, typing quickly back:
“You look like shit,” John said in greeting.
“Because, as I already told him, you need at least
“I’ve only tested it out once, but I think I finally figured out a good balance of booze and wolfsbane.” Scott grinned, catching the attention of the other wolves sitting around the firepit.
By their fourth night in Beacon Hills, Stiles agreed to go back to the house with Derek for the second time, but only under the condition that he’d drop him back off before they fell asleep. They had just finished their Wednesday night set and had three shows lined up in Portland before they’d come back Sunday afternoon. Derek complained they were running around like kids in high school, to which Stiles fired back that they
“You were one of my best friends,” Stiles admitted. “You didn’t even say goodbye when we left for school.”
“I think we found our new favorite drummer.” Dean nodded in agreement.
“Not confirmed,” Stiles grinned sharply. “But there is a vampire—”
“Okay, so there was a whole pack?”
He pulled his phone out, clicking through his notifications and seeing that Erica had tagged him in her stories on Instagram. Boyd had gotten a shot of her stage performance, and it was followed up by Stiles banging away at the drums during their last song, leaning over his kit with concentrated rhythm while the tense muscles along his shoulders and torso were clear from where they stood in the front. Stiles shared it to his own page with a grin.
, jeeze, right before attaching several pictures in an email.
“No one looks for me,” Stiles grumbled, standing up. He liked the anonymity he had grown accustomed to on these gigs, getting to bang out his music, feel damn good about the crowd roaring in front of them, and then get to go home without any of the social pressure that people knew it was
He thought a moment longer before turning back to Erica, “Fine.” He cut her off before she could say more, “But if I want to leave at any point, you are driving my ass back to the motel. No questions asked.” Erica happily agreed, cleaning up with more haste than normal, eagerly tugging on Stiles’ arm.
Stiles rolled his eyes – this was old news. Not only did they regularly play Halloween / Rocky Horror inspired gigs in the fall, with or without Stiles, but there was almost a straight year where Castiel wore predominantly skirts instead of pants. Dean made his joyous opinion of the change happily known, every day.
“Exactly.” She nodded. Lydia stood back up, walking towards the front foyer of her home before returning. “Derek dropped this off this morning.”
before walking away. If it’s not a ghoul, he doesn’t care. And he’s not going to go around and tell another hunter like our dad, so you’re fine.”
“Dad’s always been more of a hunter.” Sam leaned back on his hands from where he sat on his bed. “Dean, too, but he sticks to ghosts and ghouls.”
He took a seat at his own desk with a sigh. Sam had a point, though. It didn’t want to be some weirdo groupie. For all that he had seen back in Beacon Hills, Dean was this completely different type of guy. Hard, brash, mean looking, especially when he wore his lip ring and had his hair all spiked up and wore more punk than foreman clothes. But then he spoke, or was around Cas, and melted into a freaking teddy bear. He had as much pride in Sam as Stiles’ dad had in him, and could be as rough as he needed to get what he wanted, but was nothing but nice to Stiles.
Stiles tried not to let it affect him. He kept going to parties with Sam, sometimes Sam and Jess, and sometimes just Jess, flirting with mostly anyone who gave him a second glance. It was fun, getting to go out and actually act like a normal eighteen-year-old for once.
before pocketing his phone.
So they knew Derek was a bartender, was a bartender
Stiles sat up, “Wait, Sam,”
He really should’ve gotten Dean to upgrade the jeep to a better media hook up. His CD player barely worked, instead electing to use a cassette with an aux cord attached
Stiles grinned, “No promises!”
—when he accepted the call. “Hey dad,” he mumbled, rubbing a hand over his eyes sleepily.
“And what, you want me to move back here?” Stiles laughed at the thought. When John stayed quiet, Stiles looking from the window back to his dad. “Seriously? Hell no! The road is calling me, dad.”
Stiles had snapped a photo of his face, joint tucked into the corner of his mouth as he took the second drag, eyes already half lidded. He typed out the caption:
Derek’s laugh forced Stiles to look back at over. “And what the hell is so funny?”
, and margaritas quickly turned into tequila shots, which turned into body shots, which turned into Boyd glaring at Stiles as he did a shot off of Erica and Lydia. He grinned, the wedge of a lime caught between his teeth from where he pulled it of Lydia’s mouth. The girls were laughing, hopping off the table where they had laid down. Stiles looked up to see Isaac had taken a snap of the event on his phone before tossing it back to Stiles. He gave a shrug at Stiles’ questioning look but laughed it off to go find Scott to get another cup of his booze.
“I mean, not before now, but—”
. Who the hell says that?”
Castiel nodded, brushing shoulders with Stiles, “And no tequila.”
When he left the bathroom, Gabriel tossed a pair of drumsticks to Stiles. He caught them easily enough, shoving one into his back pocket and twirling the other with his hand with a grin. He had met Castiel’s older brother when they all grabbed dinner earlier, laughing at the way the guy got under Castiel’s skin. It reminded him of the way he used to rib Scott. He wondered what his best friend would think if he saw him. Stiles tossed his phone back at Gabe, his snapchat app already pulled up, “C’mon, man, if this is my debut and curtain call, we gotta document it.”
“It’s worked so far,” Dean shrugged.
“That is suspiciously very responsible of you, Stiles.”
“And do what? Show up on my dad’s door?” Dean let out a bitter laugh. “No way, baby, I do not need that bullshit. I got you, the stage, and the open road.”
They drove back and forth between Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico until the seasons turned warmer, gearing up to return to Beacon Hills in May for a repeat of the residency they had done the first time around.
“You promise you’re not a crimefighting superhero in your free time?” Erica questioned, eyeing Stiles with a sharpened stare.
Thankfully, they made it out of Sin City without having to pay anyone’s bail.
“He didn’t argue.” Lydia handed the large book over. “And if I were you, I would count that as a win.”
Genuinely. He had the full moon circled in his calendar, but rather than waiting anxiously by his phone, he had barely realized an entire month had passed and what the silver marked circle on the calendar meant (red meant bills were due, blue was for his exams, green for Sam’s, and silver for supernatural fun).
Dean yelling into the mic, telling the crowd to
John laughed, “Yeah, yeah, kid.” He paused, “You kids have fun? Were safe?”
“That
Halfway through the first set, while banging out an improvised rhythm, Stiles looked up and laughed, because,
He still got snaps from Erica, who refused to let their streak end even after so many years, and typed out art school-worthy critiques of the latte art Isaac sent him when he started picking up shifts with Erica. He particularly liked seeing mugs adorned with calla lilies and Isaac sneaking shots of unsuspecting patrons commenting on how
Which he had never done before now.
the flowers looked and they were so charmed to receive a drink that had so much care and thought put into it.
“We had to give them their own shelf,” Derek added, looking at the row of binders with content.
Stiles yelled out his pleased response, grabbing a bottle of whiskey from the table before pouring it into an empty plastic cup. They toasted their respective drinks before tossing them back, with Stiles finishing what he had poured in one go and Erica capping the flask before pocketing it.
He pulled out the book, quickly translated the part Scott needed, and begrudgingly added the texts to his touring duffel bag.
And they wondered why he didn’t come back home.
“This is why I don’t go back to Kansas,” Dean huffed from where he sat, taking a hit off of the vape Castiel handed to him, face softening as he breathed out.
Castiel and Dean had been planning on leaving the city the previous day, but then a friend heard they were around and contacted them about doing one more basement gig before they hit the road. The guys were excited about the timing, happy to catch one more gig before leaving. Only, apparently there was an issue, since the guys they had found to play with them didn’t stay in the area after what they thought was their last show, and weren’t going to make it back in time.
” Derek pushed Stiles through the opened door, shutting it behind him. Stiles heard the latch close as Derek turned the deadbolt. He took a deep breath, watching the door for several seconds before he realized, as the pain in his back faded to a dull ache like he had grown accustomed to since getting out of the hospital, that Derek had rejected him.
Stiles knew it wasn’t going to be easy, exploring this thing with Derek, and for now it was just good fun, but Stiles knew not to fall too deep like he had the first time around. They were hitting the road soon, anyway. It wasn’t like him and Derek had professed some undying love or shit—Stiles hadn’t done it before and he wasn’t about to start now. But their attempts at talking, really getting to know who they had become in the years of silence, quickly dissolved into them making out with little to no words actually shared.
.” Derek had cut Stiles off and stepped closer, his glare narrowing in on Stiles.
“More like anarchist.” Sam shrugged. “With a lawyer brother. We’ll be a hit at family parties.”
“We’re not talking about the Winchesters, Stiles.” John remarked. “How their father wanted them to live has nothing to do with us.”
By the time the first book was typed up and he was starting on the second of the three Derek had shipped him, Stiles’ hair had faded from the bright orange he started the summer with to a pale yellow. He had just sent Derek the file for the first book when he was out picking up another color—banana yellow—when his phone dinged in response.
“You know that’s not how I meant it,” Stiles added after the silence stretched on longer.
Sam had walked back downstairs with Jess in tow when they stopped and caught Stiles’ frowning. “What’s with the long face? You actually look like a star.”
“Oh. Okay.” Stiles nodded, “That’s good to know.”
When he woke up again, it was to the sounds of Dean and Cas kissing their way into the shower together. He rolled his eyes before grabbing his phone again. If he actually cared about catching them in the act, he’d fork over the money to get his own room.
“Damn straight, I am.” Stiles grinned. He leaned over, planting a kiss on Derek’s cheek, just as he had with Erica and Boyd and the countless he shared with Dean, Cas and Sam over the years. It was friendly, but he felt Derek inhale quickly when he did it, unlike the others ever had. With a wink, he climbed out of the camaro and into the motel room.
Even Scott started talking about pack things with him again. Stiles had questioned him, asking why he had stopped back during freshman year and Scott’s response was not what Stiles had been expecting. Everyone figured out something had happened between him and Derek, and thought bringing wolf-related things up was going to
He at least finally got to have that father’s day beer about a month after he finished his junior year.
loved was kind of mind blowing. Okay, sure—werewolves, ghosts, the existence of the supernatural were also mind blowing. Nearly being ripped in half by one set of claws, mind blowing.
Stiles’ eyes hadn’t left Derek’s as they drank, though, turning over the glass without pause.
By the time the summer was ending, Jess was fully managing four bands in total, including the
“Man, he’s not that much older than us.” Sam rolled his eyes, “He lives by the skin of his teeth, floating from place to place, never putting roots down beyond Cas.”
“About that—” Stiles pulled some other clothes out of his bag, kicking off his shoes, “Dad’s going to be in the crowd tonight.”
Dean looked up from where he had been untwisting some of their cables, “You know it’s true, Stiles. We haven’t had this kind of crowd outside of Baton Rouge and Phoenix, and right off the bat, before.”
“That was with only five-hours notice,” Dean had commented, pounding fists with Derek in celebration. “Hell yeah!” He hopped back onto the stage, grabbing Cas in a celebratory kiss before punching a fist in the air. Cas grinned happily at the show, finishing tuning up his guitar before placing it on the stand beside his amp.
“No, you let it die.” Stiles rolled his eyes. “You haven’t spoken to me since Wednesday. Or, Thursday? Whatever fucking day it was.” There was a pause, but Stiles continued, “Besides, you guys sent
“No.” Stiles shot him down, hopping off the table quickly before joining the throng of people, quickly finding Erica among the mass of bodies.
“Well isn’t that nice,” Crowley grinned, pulling out his phone and scrolling, updating his social media story with the latest news.
“Remember, you’re the only one who would probably call it
“Don’t look at me like that, Sam” Gabe rolled his eyes, “You’re not the one sharing a bed with the kid.”
“And I’ve told you, being a Sheriff shouldn’t be the only thing stopping that boy from dropping trout on stage.”
Stiles leveled a glare at Dean just as Cas came around the other side, first acknowledging the sound set up before directing his attention to the guys. “Sorry we took so long.”
Stiles sighed, “You know, for a guy acting so concerned this week, you really didn’t seem to care when you kept shipping those books out. Pretty sure you were the one who complained when it took a little extra time to get back to you.” He looked pointedly at Derek.
“And what about you?” Stiles stopped and looked at Sam.
“Duh,” Erica shrugged. “That’s nothing new.”
“Prove it.” Stiles’ eyes narrowed. In a second, he let out a sharp yell, twinges of pain from his back shooting up and down as Derek grabbed him by his elbow and walked him to the front door.
know the entire law enforcement team in town.
degree, so how about you get your head out of your ass and actually talk to the guy.”
“I’ll call you Joker!” She yelled over her shoulder with a laugh.
“So,” Stiles started, “we’re talking.”
“Yea, okay.” Dean replies, not really paying attention to anything other than his hurt friend.
“What?” Dean asks, guarded.
“Where, Cass? Where do you want me?” Dean asks, sliding his hand back up Cass' cock. “Here?” Dean asks, applying a little more pressure to the throbbing red penis.
“Fuck, Dean! Fuck me already! Please.” The words come out hoarse and quiet with a slight edge.
Dean kisses and nibbles at Cass' jaw and neck, working his way down to the angel's collarbone. He starts to suck at his collarbone, biting into the skin just hard enough to get Cass to hiss. Pulling away so he can see his work, Dean chuckles before leaning down and licking at Cass' nipples.
“We need to shower before Sam gets back.” Cass smiles and enjoys the way Dean’s eye darken with lust again.
The angel stirs again, this time his eyes slowly open, trying to focus on the foggy figure beside him. Once he focuses on Dean his eyebrows furrow together.
“What...happened? I feel...dizzy?” Cass says, not sure how to describe the pounding in his head.
“What, Cass?” Dean asks, nervous.
Twenty minutes later Dean and Castiel are burying the boy's body, Dean's hands shaking as he throws the last bit of dirt onto the hole.
“More.” Castiel moans loudly. “Want. You. Dean, need you.” Cass mumbles, unsure if Dean can understand what he means.
“I thought I heard you...saying things to me. But that's impossible.”
“Can you lift your arms above your head?” Dean asks and frowns when Cass tries and whimpers.
“My apologies. But the boy is right. About all of it.” Castiel says, not meeting Dean's eyes.
“Demons killed my family.  My mom. My dad. My sister who was engaged. And my little brother, only 8-months-old. Then they killed my friends. My girlfriend. They wanted me, I don't know why and I don't expect you to trust me. But Sam needs to get out of here and fast.” The boy says, taking something out of his jacket pocket.
“Yes, Dean. Please.” Cass begs as he rolls his hips down to meet Dean’s finger.
“I wish there was something else we could do, but there is not. If you don't do it, I will. Your way would be less painful.” Castiel says, voice low, sad.
“Dean Winchester. What a surprise this is. How is it that you managed to get out of Hell...and with your soul intact for that matter?” The boy asked.
“I am sorry that you had to do it. But it's what he wanted and it needed to be done.” Cass says, still not meeting Dean's eyes.
“CASS! Are you okay? Are you in pain?” Dean asks, standing up to get the angel water.
Walking out into the main room, Dean grabs a pair of scissors and shows them to Cass, as if asking for approval. After Cass nods Dean walks back into the too small bathroom and slowly cuts up the front of Cass' shirt.
“Know what?” Dean asks back, confused.
“He doesn't know, does he?” Sam asks, looking at his brother thoughtfully.
“I just killed an innocent little boy! What am I supposed to say, Cass? Really, tell me, what you would like me to say about this!” Dean yells the end, jabbing a finger toward the new grave.
“Wait.” Cass whispers as Dean starts to shut the door.
“Thank you. I do not deserve your kindness.” Cass whispers as Dean shuts the door and takes his phone out.
“Dean...” Cass huffs out a breath, biting his lip.
Dean keeps the slow pace going while he lets their lips slide together, swallowing all of the noises coming from Castiel. Cass tightens his legs around Dean’s waste and bucks his hips to urge him to go faster, harder. Dean’s not one to refuse Cass anything so he pulls back and grabs his thighs and snaps his hips forward, picking up speed.
“Shh. It's okay baby. I've got you. Let me take care of you.” Dean says looking into the bright blue eyes of the man, no...angel, he's come to love as he kicks his pants aside.
Dean laughs and rolls to bring their lips together again. “I love you.”
“Heard me what?” Dean asks, lying back on his bed, arm stretched above him.
“Ugh, here, let me. These things can be a bitch.” Dean suggests, almost moaning at how close his hands are now to Castiel's groin.
“You're serious?” Dean asks, stunned.
Cass nods and watches as the man closes the door. He slowly finishes undressing and looks at the long, thick, hard length hanging from between his legs. Curiosity getting the better of the inexperienced angel, he gently strokes his finger along it, moaning, too loud, at the contact.
Before Cass could open the door, Dean had them face to face, Cass' back pressed to the door. Mere inches away, they could smell one another.
It's only now that Dean notices all of the marks on Castiel's face. His shirt is torn open exposing deep gashes on his smooth chest.
“He's in danger. Real, life threatening danger. Lilith is hot on his trail and we cannot allow her to find him. It would prove fatal to the existence of this world.” The boy says, voice strained.
Dean slowly lays his lips on Cass' as he pushes him toward the bed. As Cass' legs hit the edge of the mattress, he allows himself to fall onto the bed with a small bounce causing his and Dean's erections to grind together.
“What...Cas what are you doing? I was comfortable..” Dean pouts.
“You’re gonna be a sex addict now, aren’t you?” Dean laughs as he closes the bathroom door behind them, effectively shutting out the rest of the world.
“Actually, you two need to talk. I'm gonna go for a walk. Text me when it's safe to come back.” Sam says, playfully winking at the two men sitting awkwardly next to each other.
“Thank you.” Cass says as Dean helps him into the bathroom.
“Tyler. Tyler Morris.” The boy whispers his response.
Hearing a grunt from Dean makes Cass sigh in relief. If Dean were to ever find out how Cass felt for the man, Dean would kill him. Literally. Sam too, probably. But it feels like lately, he's having trouble controlling himself around the hunter.  Almost pressing into the hunter's touch when said hunter was undoing Cass' belt.
Cass looks up, meeting Dean's eyes through the reflection of the window. Something in Dean's eyes told him it was okay to be honest.
Hearing the Impala leave, Dean gets up and sits next to the limp body on his bed. Hands hesitant, he strokes the angel's hair, a tear falling down his face.
Ten minutes later Dean pulls into the motel parking lot. Shutting the car off he gets out and over to Castiel's side. Lifting the unconscious angel from the car he looks up to see Sam holding the door open. Getting right to work, Sam starts cleaning the cuts, working with the worst ones first. After Cass is patched up, they leave him on Dean's bed letting him rest.
Dean takes pity on his lover by sliding his hand over Cass' stomach, down to his hip before reaching his thick, throbbing cock. Dean wraps his fingers around Cass' cock in a light grip, starting a slow, soft up-pull, down-push. Feeling the angel shudder under him, Dean leans up and captures his lips in an urgent, deep, teeth-clashing kiss.
“Cass, what do you want? You have to tell me.” Dean whispers against Castiel's ear before biting on the lobe.
“Because if you don't they'll find me. They'll use torture to get your location out of me. I won't be able to help it. You know what torture does to people. No matter how hard you try, they always get their information. Besides, I don't want to be like the things that killed everyone I loved. It's all I ask.” The boy says, looking over Dean's shoulder, staring at something.
Walking through the small town, he kept a watchful eye out for anything that could be hiding in the shadows. He had been walking around for about two hours, thinking about things other than the case he and his brother were working on. Demon omens have skyrocketed in this little town. They needed the angel's help but he couldn't be bothered with that thought right now. Not when his brother's life was in danger once again.
Dean moans at this offering and slowly trails his finger down, past Castiel's balls to his puckered hole. Rubbing lightly over it he nearly comes apart at the noise Cass makes. “Here?” Already knowing the answer.
“Right. Thank you.” Cass says, still standing there. “Dean? What are you looking at?” Cass asks, suddenly feeling very small under the gaze of the beautiful man.
*~*~*~FIN~*~*~*
“So you can take a shower. You'll feel a lot better after you're clean.” Dean says, helping Cass stand up.
“Don't tell me. You're a 'good' demon? You want the humans and angels to win?” Dean asks as the boy nods. “You know, the last demonic piece of shit that said that decided to feed my brother demon blood, almost turning him into a monster. So forgive the hell out of me if I don't believe you.”
“I’m not gonna last much longer, baby. Fuck, you feel so damn good.” Dean growls as his thrusts start to become erratic.
“What do you remember?” Dean asks, taking a seat by Sam's opened laptop at the little table in front of the window.
“Sorry. I was....I'm....going. Get dressed and get out here.” Dean says, getting defensive.
Quickly cleaning his hair and washing his body, he turns the heat up on the water. Feeling the heat over his muscles is very relaxing, soothing the aches and pains in his shoulders and back. Stepping out after shutting the water off he stands there, waiting to dry off.
“I am sorry. I seem to have interrupted a very important conversation. Shall I go back into the bathroom and wait till you two are done?” Cass says looking from brother to brother, Sam smirking, Dean's features anxious.
Cass nods as Dean looks back at him, a light tint coating his cheeks as he tries to remove his trench coat, only to wince in pain.
“There is something I'd like to talk about.” Cass whispers, looking out the window.
“Stay with me Cass. We're almost there. Come on, damn it. Keep talking. You gotta stay awake, man.” Dean says, pushing the accelerator to the floor.
Dean pulls back to add lube to his cock before leaning over his angel and slowly pushing the head of his cock inside. He tries to stop so that Cass can adjust but Cass brings his legs up so his feet are resting on Dean’s ass and with the leverage Cass pulls Dean closer, deeper. They both moan as Dean bottoms out. Dean doesn’t even think of waiting now, pulling back and slowly sliding back in.
Closing the door without a response, Dean walks over and starts eating the McDonald's that Sam had brought back with him.
Dean lubes up three of his fingers and goes back to circling Cass’ entrance before slowly pushing one finger in. Dean has to bite back his out groan when he watches the way Cass’ body undulates from the pleasure, hips coming down to take more of his finger.  Dean wastes no time working Castiel up to a second finger, cock twitching at the filthy sounds coming for the angel.
Without thinking, Castiel leans in the rest of the way, connecting their lips in a soft kiss. Pulling away, he looks into Dean's eyes, fear momentarily taking place until Dean leans back in, kissing Cass with more force. Lightly gliding his tongue over the angel's lips, asking for entrance. Slowly, Castiel opens this mouth, allowing Dean to explore his warm mouth. Cass slides his arms up to rest around Dean's neck as Dean's hands grip onto Cass' waist.
“DAMN IT!” Dean yells.
“That you want him.” Sam says bluntly just as Cass walks out, dressed in Dean's clothing.
“Detained? What the hell does that mean? You're an angel, damn it! You can just zap in and out whenever you wish. You do it to me all the fucking time!” Dean says, now in Castiel's face.
“Porn.” Cass replies like it’s an obvious answer.
“I would never hurt you, Cass, not on purpose. You heard right. I do love you, and I've been hiding it for way too long. I have wanted you so badly that it literally drives me mad.” Dean says, leaning in closer to Castiel. “Just tell me that you don't want this. That you don't want me, and I'll let you leave and we'll never speak of this again.”
“Looking for me?” A voice sounded from behind him, making him jump.
“So you want me to kill an innocent little boy?” Dean asks, back tensing again.
Cass, feeling the cold metal of the blade touch his skin, shivers then lets out a low groan. Not sure why he made such a noise, he tilts his head to one side as he realizes Dean has stopped mid-cut.
“Fuck, you’re beautiful like this. Begging me to fuck you, the way your body wants it.” Dean chuckles as he reaches for his bag to grab the lube.
“But you're always so clean.” Dean says stepping back inside the bathroom.
“I thought I heard you saying certain things that were of comfort to me. And it is impossible because...” Cass sighs, forcing the words out of his mouth. “...you couldn't possibly feel for me, the way I feel for you.” He whispers.
“I'm going to get some food and some coffee. I'll be back in a few, okay man?” Sam asks, his voice low, worried.
“Jesus! What's with you people and sneaking up on me?” Dean growls, looking to Castiel.
“Dean...I'm not sure...if I'll make...it.” Cass says, his voice slowly fading out.
“You've been quiet.” Castiel states, as he sits on the hood of the Impala.
“What's your name?” Dean asks almost too low for anyone to hear.
“Oh, okay. These two nozzles control how warm the water is. This one on the right is cold and this one on the left is hot.” Dean says turning them on and adjusting them. “Then you pull this up and it turns the shower head on.” He continues pulling up the little lever. “Then you wash your hair with a little bit of shampoo then conditioner and wash your...body...with the body wash.” Dean finishes pointing to each.
“Uh...Dean...I think you should leave now.” Cass says stepping away from Dean after his belt is off.
“Cass, are you still breathing in there?” Dean asks, knocking on the door. “Sam has food for us. I know you don't eat but it might make you feel better.” Dean says poking his head in to see a naked, wet Castiel standing there, hands covering his lower body parts.
“Cass? Can you hear me?” He asks, and when he gets no response he continues. “Cass, you need to get up. You need to come back to me. I...I love you, Cass. You can't leave me. You hear me, damn it?!” Dean yells the last part.
“He's right Dean.” Another, deeper, voice sounds from behind him.
“You gotta be okay, Cass. I know I'm a dick to you sometimes but I can't lose you. You're my best friend. What would I do without your annoying ass popping in on me all the time?” Deans asks, now stroking the man's cheek.
“More, Dean, don’t stop. Please, don’t stop.” Cass begs, his cock remaining hard where it bounces lightly by his hip.
“What do you think I said to you Cass?” Dean asks, getting up and slowly walking toward the angel.
“What is it?” Dean asks, panic lacing his tone.
“I am sorry. I was...detained.” He spoke softly.
“Oh fuck.” Castiel gasps, reaching his arms over his head to grab onto the edge of the bed. “Fuck, Dean, something’s….something’s happening.”
“Can't...keep eyes…op...” And with that Cass is out.
“Come on.” Dean says opening the passenger side door of the Impala. “Let’s get you back to the hotel so we can patch you up. Then you can rest.” Dean says watching the angel limp over and slide into the seat, wincing.
Cass reaches down and starts to unbutton Dean's jeans, followed by the zipper being pulled down. Not knowing what to do next, Cass sets his hand on the small of Dean's back as Dean kicks off his shoes and toes off his socks. Cass brings his lips down to connect with Dean's neck, sucking hard on the skin above his pulse point.
