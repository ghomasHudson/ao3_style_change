Zach awoke again just after they got back to camp and livened up enough to have a brief splash in the lake with Peter and have his dinner, but shortly after he was yawning so much that Tony put him to bed for an early night.
In his lab he cleared out and created a baby safe zone, complete with three feet high fencing, padded on the baby side so that when he or she started walking they wouldn’t get hurt. He had the floor padded too so it’d be soft under the feet, and had a soft ball pit put in, a baby bouncer, and all sorts of rattles and other toys for the baby to play with.
Natasha let out an audible groan, “Stark?” She said, “The whole world knows where he is, he goes out for coffee and there’s a dozen tweets in five seconds, you don’t need to spy to know where he is, just look at social media.”
A frown flitted over Tony’s face but before he had a chance to question Steve he was moved up into Steve’s arms and supported there by his waist with Steve holding him with just the one arm, while his free hand carefully spread Tony’s legs so they either side of Steve’s body, then, as Steve sat himself on the bed, Tony found himself straddling Steve’s groin.
“We can go slow next time.” He panted lifting his body up and down so he could meet Steve’s thrusts and have him going deeper inside him than ever,
He had already undergone a laser ablation surgery on his fallopian tubes to clear away the scar tissue. He’d told a white lie, or a big fat lie, and said he was going to a series of meetings in Malibu, where in reality he’d spent a few days in a clinic getting the treatment.
“I had no idea she’d do that.” Tony said to Steve. “I mean it’s not like I really am her Father, but I guess I look similar enough for her to think I am.” Steve nodded, blinking back a suspicious shimmer in his eyes,
Tony was lain on a bed attached to monitors and drips, his chest covered in bandages, his left and leg in casts. He was too pale, his face mottled in bruising and swollen about his eyes and cheeks, with a dark cut stretching down from his forehead.
“I’m sure you could.” Bruce replied as he began to get the neck brace about Tony’s neck and shoulders, he glanced up and followed Thor with his head as the God retrieved the sceptre from its pedestal and slid it between the straps of his armour so that it was secured to his back. At any other time they would have been celebrating this victory, but right now no one cared what happened to the sceptre not with Tony so seriously injured.
“Take a seat Mr Parker-Stark.” The Principal said. He perched on the edge of his desk looking uncomfortable. This set of Peter’s nerves and he tensed as he sat down, right on the edge of his seat.
“Wow, this is really good Zach, it looks just like me doesn’t it?” Tony said, holding up the picture for everyone to see.
Peter blushed as Steve’s eyes met his in the rear view mirror, “Badass huh?” He asked, Peter slumped in the seat and ducked his head, there was no way he was living this down.
He let out a deep exhale and just stared up at the ceiling above the bed. What was he going to do? He didn’t belong here, this wasn’t his world. His world had burned and he was the only one left.
“Surface level and this is, sub basement two, of course, it couldn’t be just one flight of stairs could it?”
He hated lying to his parents, hated that he was so bad at lying that Steve had seen through his act of being perfectly fine and had come to speak to him about it. Peter had been lucky that Steve had just figured it was to do with his enhancements, which, technically was true. But that just made his guilt all the worse, because Steve trusted him enough to never suspect that Peter would be hiding something so big from him and Tony.
Again, Tony typed on the tablet, “We don’t know for certain, obviously your senses have been greatly increased, which is why smell, sight, hearing, and everything was suddenly so strong for you; Bruce and I are looking into ways to desensitize you. Help you gain control of your senses, so you won’t be so overwhelmed.”
“For Christ sakes Stark, are you drunk?” Tony was suddenly shoved away from Rogers. His legs having turned to jelly immediately buckled and he fell to the floor shaking like a leaf,
“Long story Bruce.” Tony said, “I’ll tell you enroute. Strange, I need to take Lily to Pepper and get them both to the shelters before I mobilize.”
“The hell, Sharon?” Tony cried, coughing into his fist, he was still regaining his breath from running and his chest was aching both from the cracked ribs and the arc reactor.
“Play it.” Tony said, scooting over the bench so Steve could sit besides him, “Wanna watch a Shield/Hydra home movie?”
“But you are my AI!” Tony whined giving into the urge to stomp his foot, “I made you, I nurtured you and taught you, and have helped you grow from a baby AI to an adult AI. I gave virtual birth to you Jarvis. I am your Mother and creator, and…… and it’s not fair if you take Steve’s side over mine!”
“Mr Stark, Thank Heavens I have found you.” Vision said looking Tony over and made swift work of the wrist cuffs and took hold of Tony as the Omega lurched forward,
“More like a sack of…” Tony held up a finger to Natasha who had a far too smug looking smirk on her face,
“Cap I’m getting Clint to the jet.” Sam called over the Coms, taking Clint from Natasha and lifting him into the air, flying him back to the jet to get him medical attention.
“Yeah because having their customers cutting off each others body parts would be great for business.” Sam said as he swept the occupants of a tower watch out, depositing them on the ground.
Tony grit his teeth, he hadn’t wanted to share this information with Steve, with anyone. He knew what they’d say, that he needed therapy, that his PTSD was catching up with him, that it was only to be expected after what he’d been through.
Killian let out at laugh as Tony let out a yelp as the contents of one of the crates exploded, sending flames shooting up the walls and licking at the catwalk, making it impossible for him to cross and heating the metal beneath his feet.
Making Tony witness the brutal deaths of his children, of his family, to hear his family blame him for the deaths. It was a torture beyond anything Steve could imagine. His hatred for Wanda was greater and more intense than he had ever thought possible.
After dinner everyone settled down to relax, reading, watching TV, surfing the net. Tony and Steve went out onto the balcony together to enjoy the last of the sunset.
His final few weeks in the hospital had been devoted to rehab, he’d learned how to get himself from his bed to the chair, from the chair to the toilet, and from his chair to a shower stool and back again.
“Water bombs, flour bombs, and eggs, Sir, Master Peter has also decided to use his nerf gun. So I do urge you to head there soon.”
The silence that followed made Peter wish he could die, while MJ might have meant well, she’d just increased the attention on him ten-fold.
With the contract agreed upon and signed by all parties, the Avengers welcomed Dynamic Productions into the tower to record them during their day to day life.
Curien swallowed hard and wet his lips. It was guaranteed protection, he knew the avengers wouldn’t go that far for him, not after what he’d done, but it was more protection than just a new identity and location which Ross could easily find.
Both Steve and Tony sat up straighter at that. Natasha had gotten away, she was alive, but…. Did that mean she’d been lucky or that she had betrayed Fury, betrayed them?
The Skrull shrugged, “I have his memories, all of them.” He looked to Steve, “Even the ones he didn’t want himself. The Alpha he loved betraying him, lying to his face about his parents Murders and then leaving him for dead.” The Skrull laughed, “He was pitiful, lying there, in that bunker, all broken and bruised, wasn’t even capable of putting up a fight, well, it isn’t surprising is it, after what you and that one armed friend of yours had done.”
Grey hair was also a norm, there was hair dye but it was very harsh and people simply couldn’t afford it, not the type that stayed put longer than one wash anyway, henna was commonly used, as were other natural dyes to hide the grey.
Everyone was there of course, sitting around the table with mugs of coffee, tea, or hot chocolate, glasses of juice, and plates waiting for the pancakes, bacon, sausage, and eggs that Steve was cooking up.
He also made out that Rogers was nothing more than a propaganda tool, the dancing monkey he had drawn himself as.
He bent down and picked Zach up, holding him against his chest and began to rub the boys back, Zach wrapped his arms about Steve’s neck and buried his face into his chest sobbing.
Smiling, he took Tony’s arm and together with Clint, Natasha, and Bruce, they got into the lift and headed down to the garage where the limo was waiting for them.
The Skrull laughed and morphed into Tony again, Clint loosened his hold for a second then punched the Skrull in the stomach, “Answer me!”
Rogers made to get to his feet and launch into another plea for Bucky to listen to him but was smacked around the head by the shield that had been thrown at him.
“Tony has every right to be here, he is an avenger and he owns the property.” Natasha icily reprimanded the Witch who glowered at Tony.
“Well met Man of Iron,” Thor greeted, he frowned as Steve joined them, face bloody and one shoulder clear dislocated, “You have aged and grown since last we met Captain.”
“Mr Parker-Stark you are coming to the office.” One of the teachers said sternly. “On your feet, and with me now.”
“What the hell was Osborn doing here?” One of the Fire rescue workers said looking at the remains of what might have been a lion or lizard.
For his hearing Tony created a set of earphones that could completely cancel out sound, but could also receive sound with different settings, so Peter could gradually increase the amount of sound he was exposed to until he learned to control his ears enough to not need to shut out sound at all.
Tony and Steve would be staying out with them Friday night and Thor would be with them the Saturday night, as they were getting to the Island so late they wouldn’t bother putting the tents up until Friday and would just spend the night in the villa instead.
“You don’t speak to us that way!” Wanda shrieked, readying her magic, pausing when Vision placed himself between her and the Colonel.
"It's that dipshit Osborn's fault." Tony growled, "And he's going to pay for it if it's the last thing I do."
“Promises, promises.” Tony purred, leaning back against the pillows and watching with rapt attention as Steve lubed up his fingers. He lifted his left leg, maintaining eye contact with Steve the whole time, as he placed his heel on the man’s shoulder and smirked at him.
Peter nodded in agreement, privately pleased to be considered old enough to understand and to be treated like a grown up.
“Its politics.” Tony corrected, “Its double talk, back stabbing, and bullshit. Its also what we’re going to be dealing with as Avengers.”
“I think you have more chance of convincing Miss Pots that building a Laser Quest in the Tower is a good idea, Sir.” Jarvis dryly replied, “But please do not allow me to dissuade you on your attempts.”
The factory. Damnit, Curien had been making such progress there. Obviously he’d hit the self destruct and that should have destroyed everything in the labs, leaving nothing but ash.
Tony lay listless in bed. He wanted to get up and get out of Shield Medical, but his leg had yet to finish healing, something the Doctors estimated would be done in a month rather than the three months that normal people would have to wait.
“Completely evil.” Happy agreed, tickling Zach’s sides as he went to get his own seat and breakfast.
Steve sighed heavily, “How long has this been going on?” He asked, “How long have you been dealing with this?”
“With Steve.” Tony said, managing a weak smile, “Cap took him out for ice cream. He can still be bribed with ice cream.”
Tony clutched his chest in dramatic wounding making Peter snicker then sigh heavily, “Why do people die?” he asked frowning at Tony.
“We’ll talk every day I promise.” Tony said to Zach, ruffling his hair, “We’ll video call and you can tell me everything that you are doing at school, and you can tell me what Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU have been getting up to. Jarvis and Friday are supposed to tell me but they secretly conspire with them, it’s a whole AI union thing, I think they are secretly plotting to take over the world, they are probably programming sentient toasters, microwaves, and fridges in the lab right now and will unleash them on the unsuspecting world, within a few weeks the world will be over run by unstable sentient kitchen ware, there will be war on the streets, people will be bombed with burnt toast, microwavable food, and milk cartons!”
“Popcorn, pizza, doritos, salsa, ice cream, and fizzy drinks, all present and accounted for.” Tony listed looking at the abundance of junk food that had been amassed.
Pepper’s voice startled him out of his thoughts and he looked at her, “You’ve got a dopey smile on your face and you’re holding your stomach.”
“Christ no,” Tony said, snorting at the thought, “He wouldn’t dance with anyone at all, least of all me.”
Steve felt pinpricks in his hand and glanced down seeing Tony white knuckling his hand. "Will he be alright?" The Billionaire asked in a tight voice.
“I’ll help hide the body.” Natasha said, She then sat up straighter and look Clint in the eye, “We need to consider contingency plans. Hopefully everything will play out in Stark’s favour, but just in case it doesn’t we need to be able to get him, Rogers, and the boys out of this country quickly and safely.”
“I’m afraid you may not be able to speak right away, that is perfectly normal following intubation.” The Doctor said,
“Damn right I hit you!” Steve shot back, as he helped Tony get to his feet. “How dare you speak to Tony like that, let alone raise your hand to him.” Steve looked Rogers over, his top lip pulling back to reveal his perfect top teeth and his nostrils flaring as if he smelt something unpleasant. “You walk around all puffed up and proud, convinced of your own superiority and entitlement, when you are nothing more than a common back alley bully throwing your weight around on those smaller than you.”
Steve felt a twist of guilt in his guts again. Peggy had nearly died, had been badly hurt because he’d failed to destroy Hydra seventy years before.
For a few seconds Tony struggled to register that he was not on fire, he still had both legs, and the world wasn’t burning to ash before his eyes. As his brain registered that information he became aware of the fact he was covered in sweat and he was about to vomit.
Rolling over on his bunk, Steve looked at Natasha sleeping soundly as only a soldier could, having learned to just fall asleep whenever and wherever they got the chance to conserve energy, and Wanda, curled up in a ball in the bunk beneath.
“And Happy, tell them I love them very much.” Ending the call Tony sighed and turned off the blow torch, pulled back his goggles and eyed the helmet, “Show time.” He breathed.
While they were in the car Tony’s mobile rang and it was Fury calling him to come and look at something at Shield HQ in Washington, he also said to bring Steve along but wouldn’t say more over the phone, probably being concerned about the line not being secure.
"It is?" Peter slurred, his tongue was starting to feel funny, like it was too big for his mouth, his head was light and everything seemed to spinning, noises and shapes getting blurred, and his skin was hot, it was too hot, everything was too hot and he couldn't breathe, he couldn't breathe.....
Bruce smiled. Peter really was the best of kids, many who’d suffered what he had would have become sullen and aggressive, turning their backs on the world which had caused them so much pain. Peter however was friendly and kind, a very well adjusted child which was remarkable considering what he’d been through.
“Sorry.” Tony whispered, gripping Steve’s shirt tightly, he felt so childish doing this, but he couldn’t help it, he needed Steve to hold him, needed him like he needed air,
“No one,” Steve said, “The end was coming when Reed shoved me through the portal with Lily, everyone was gone by then, save perhaps for a few civilians in hiding, waiting to burn with the rest of the planet.”
“So like if they are crap at math but good at English you’d focus and teaching them English.” Peter said.
Wanda was cold but she was elated. Since entering Stark’s mind at the base she had been able to continue to torment him no matter the distance they were. It seemed the nightmares she had already planted in his brain were continued to haunt him so it took her very little effort to get into his mind through them and increase his torment.
Bucky was the first to awake the following morning. He felt warm and content, a feeling that he had not experienced in far too long. The soreness in his muscles and feet were gone, the serum having healed him over night. Yawning, he stretched and blinked open his eyes expecting to see his dingy apartment in Bucharest, only to find himself in Stark’s Luxurious hotel room, curled up in an arm chair, with Stark asleep on the sofa over a giant version of his one time friend, and a couple of other men asleep on the sofa around him.
“Umm, yes we did fight Hydra,” Steve said looking to Tony uncertainly, he wasn’t sure if Tony would want him to tell Zach anything about the fight.
“Fine.” Tony sighed, “You may give your statement to the court and it will be judged fairly without bias.”
She bolted down the street as fast as she could go, not stopping until a dark car pulled up in front of her and one of Killian’s men got out.
Tony glanced to Sam, “Locate the Falcon wings from the EXO project and send me the address. Monitor Shield activity,” He paused and glanced at the time on the computer, “Has Natasha or Fury called?”
Bucky wasn’t particularly chatty and after asking him if he wanted to use the hotel gym or swimming pool, both of which got a head shake, Sam decided to put another movie on. He stuck to Disney since Bucky had seemed to enjoy the simple happy endings to the cartoon adventures and settled in to watch The Little Mermaid while Matt got on with some work via his laptop, (Which Bucky was curious to find had brail keys and a vocal interface designed specifically for those with only partial or no sight)
“The City will be on fire soon then, and covered in spider webbing, we’ll be getting calls from the local police department about raging infernos and people sticking to walls, buildings, and the streets!” Tony prophesized, “And Clint will be encouraging the mayhem, because he always encourages mayhem, Laura told me that he engaged in open warfare with Lila and Cooper and over two dozen eggs were sacrificed and her living room had to be completely redecorated!”
“If this works I shouldn’t even have to sacrifice too much additional space in the suit.” Tony said, “The trick is going to be getting the right amount of movement to the legs. The suits got enough strength to rip my limbs off if they move too hard and fast.”
With Peter safely off to school, Bruce down in his lab with enough tea and snacks to keep from needing to surface before dinner, the rest of the team go themselves ready to meet the documentary crew.
If Sam’s eyes had been wide before they were dinner plates now, “Holy shit, Captain America!, I’ve got Iron Man and Captain America in my backyard at two in the morning.”
“Yes.” Tony said drawing out the word, “A tentative yes,” He glanced over his shoulder, “Jarvis schedule me an appointment with my Doctor for a pelvic exam and blood work.”
“You’ll only act when commanded to.” Pierce told him sharply, “And before you forget, you and your task force are baseline, Rogers is a super soldier and Stark has that suit of his. It will take more than just your usual brawn to deal with them.”
“When will they be back?” Rogers demanded, cutting off Clint’s ramble, which to be fair, could go on for hours. Clint shrugged,
“Try me, you never know. So long as it isn’t one of those stupid made up names that celebrities give their kids, or a fruit or something.”
Peter was surprised by Zach’s question, while he’d been asking about Steve becoming his new Daddy if he and Tony got together he’d not said that he wanted to call him Daddy.
“I don’t think there are “Right hands” for this, Madame. We are speaking of the most powerful weapon to ever be created. Only a saint could be considered really fit to have full control of such a device. But sadly there are no saints, only us humans, so we’ll have to make do with what we have got.”
Tony’s breath caught in his throat as he gazed into rich royal blue eyes that held not a single lie within them. Steve was being honest in his intentions, he was not looking to just buy Tony with pretty words, have his way and depart before dawn, he really did want more than a tumble beneath the bed sheets.
“Uh, do you have anything to eat?” Steve asked blushing a little, it was at times embarrassing that he had to eat so much, but his metabolism now ran so fast that he had no choice. It had been difficult back in the war with the rationing and he’d felt guilty, getting double the rations to everyone else, he’d made it a rule to never complain, to eat whatever was put in front of him regardless of whether or not he actually enjoyed it, after all, what right did he have to complain about the food he was getting when he was getting far more nutrition than anyone else?
“I suppose its too much to hope that they might blow themselves up with it?” Steve asked, but it wasn’t really a question, they all knew they wouldn’t be that lucky.
“How lost you feel when you have no Mother to turn to for guidance and comfort.” Natasha whispered. She did not remember her parents, she had been too young to recall them, but, from what she had observed, how others spoke of their parents, their mothers. How families interacted, how Peter and Zach were with Tony, Natasha could feel that longing for her own Mother, the woman who had given her birth whose face she could not recall.
Well beggars couldn’t be choosers and frankly after weeks of a liquid diet a stale taco would be tasty!
Tony blinked, surprised, “That actually sounds like a Gala I would like to attend, God knows it’ll be a hell of a lot more fun than the usual ones, full of stuffy old farts and brain dead socialites.”
“I’ve baby sat three times, changed more nappies than I want to remember, been puked on when Peter let Zach have a dozen cookies, and actually it’s four times I’ve baby sat. I baby sat you too!”
“Much better Sir, thank you.” Jarvis replied, “And I believe you will have company in a few moments.”
“But how would…why would they find a reading of it in my brain?” Tony asked, having to clear his throat as it was choked up with phlegm,
Ever patient Steve waited until Tony was ready before he began to move, rocking in and out of his body, his cock pummelling Tony’s prostate and having him hard again within moments.
“You need to move on, Man,” Sam said. His voice sounded gentle, but his tone was mocking, and he was acting like he was talking down to Tony, like a wise man to a fool. “Cling onto this because it was Iron Man’s most glorious moment is not doing you any good…” he trailed off, as Tony promptly turned, placing Lily in Steve’s arms and marched out of the room, letting the door slam behind him.
“Smart or not, it still wasn’t your fault.” Steve said, “You did nothing wrong, so don’t blame yourself, and you are doing a wonderful job with Peter, he clearly adores you and little Zach.”
While they hoped that they would bait Thanos with the Mind Stone enough to get him to the compound there was no guarantee of that and they wanted to keep civilian casualties to a minimum, so when Thanos attacked an immediate evacuation order would be put into place, with everyone being urged to go to the shelters, which had been built with vibranium from Wakanda who had joined the global effort in defended the planet.
“God.” Tony breathed, running his hands up Steve’s perfect torso, “You are so perfect, so unbelievably perfect.”
Tony jumped as the cell door opened and he tried to get up from the bed reaching out for his daughter.
“She must have taken Zach, she kidnapped him!” Steve raked a hand through his hair, “I let her up to the penthouse. She told security she might know something about this Mandarin guy and I let her in!” Sickness swirled in his stomach at the thought, “I should have gone downstairs, if I had, none of this would have happened.”
Steve struggled to comply, struggling to make his body do as Sam was telling him, but slowly his breathing began to calm down, his heart slowing as he followed the breathing exercise until he was breathing normally again, at which point he found that he was kneeling in the snow and shaking all over, his body horribly damp with sweat and face sore from tears that had been attacked by the harsh wind.
“Meh, give or take.” Steve said with a shrug, “I’ll get lessons so I don’t tread all over your feet or bump into the others.”
He still wasn’t clear on who this Bucky was, or who this blonde with the shield was, although the shield seemed familiar somehow, as did the outfit the blonde wore, but something about the outfit didn’t seem right, it wasn’t bright enough, or shiny enough.
“That won’t be my name.” Peter said hoping it would not become a nickname but had a horrid feeling it would.”
“Doom’s energy weapons bounced off Thor’s hammer and hit the arc reactor.” Natasha said, “You fell over fifty feet and hit a building on the way down. That broke the fall somewhat and with the armour, probably saved your life.”
Thankfully his suit jacket was a little more forgiving and hid his rounded abdomen from view, without him having to go and looking through the bedroom draws to see if Pepper had left a pair of Bridget Jones knickers he could borrow.
“Down here?” Steve asked with a frown, “Why?” What could possibly be down there that Tony would be interested in?
“Tony!” Steve cried as he saw the Iron Man drop from the sky, the repulsors failing and then sparking back to life just before he hit a rooftop.
Deadpool clasped both hands over his cheeks, “Well your denial of our searing hot romance is killing me!”
Steve unscrewed the cap and downed most of the water in a few gulps, “Why hasn’t Peter awoken?” he asked, kneeling down besides Peter.
Natasha snorted, “Are you smoking the same crack as that fuckwit Slattery? Stark was drunk and drugged out of his mind when he made you that promise. How stupid are you that you took the word of man who could have barely strung a sentence together?”
Pete had been in kindergarten with Ned and their friendship had lasted all the way through to middle school, so there was a good chance that Zach would make just as solid friendships himself.
Tony groaned, trying to loosen Steve’s hold only to find himself flat on his back with Steve on top of him, a hard cock that was not his own pressing against his thigh!
With her heart racing she had loaded the pistol in the lift, firing as soon as she was through the doors, taking down Stark’s elder kid and his new boyfriend, leaving the Pup alone.
“Deal.” Tony said, he held out his hand for Curien to take with his remaining hand, but as the Doctor slipped his hand into Tony’s the billionaire yanked on his arm and shoved the IV needle back with his thumb, “You try and fuck us over and I will cut this arm off and shove it so far up your arse that your hand will be gripping your tonsils, understand me?”
“I resent being called evil.” Jarvis said, “But I and Friday would welcome assistance in keeping Dumm-E, Butterfingers, and YOU occupied.”
“Coming.” With a backpack of his own Peter joined them following Steve and Zach out of the hotel door and headed to the lift to go down to the lobby and out of the hotel. Fortunately the hotel was only a short walk from the hospital and it gave them a chance to get some fresh air before they were cooped up inside all day.
It took three days for the last of the Thanos’ forces to be dealt with, and when they were the entire planet erupted into a celebration.
“Fine.” Tony grumbled stomping over to help Steve get the tents put up, “But when we are brutally murdered don’t say I didn’t warn you.”
“You are going down for all of this.” Clint said, “Accomplice to terrorism, murder, grievous bodily harm, assault, kidnap, and quite frankly, for being a worthless piece of shit!”
“You have no reason to be sorry and every reason to be upset. Don’t feel bad about that, Tony.” He handed Tony a couple of tissues from his pocket, gratefully Tony took them and blew his nose.
“You and Pete are gonna go and finish packing up your rooms today.” Tony said, running his fingers through Zach’s hair, “If you finish early I’ll have Happy take you to the Met.”
“You need to treat your own wounds Cap.” Tony said, feeling very exposed before the alpha and male beta. He never used to have an issue showing off his body, but that had been before Afghanistan, his chest was littered with scars centred mainly around the arc reactor which glowed brightly from his chest, he was also very aware that his body was not what it had been before he’d had Zach. While he had lost the weight he’d gained during the pregnancy, his core muscles were not as strong and his belly not as flat as it had been, he had stretch marks and his pelvis was wider, the muscles having been stretched by the pregnancy and birth.
Tony smiled with genuine warmth, “You’re not asking, I’m offering, and you are going to say yes, or I’ll have Hulk carry you princess style through the streets!” he poked Bruce’s side, “Whaddya say, Jolly Green? Wanna carry Princess Steve?”
Natasha was naturally earning a great deal of male attention, she might be an Alpha, but her curvaceous figure made her look more like a Beta woman rather than the typically flat chested whip cord lean figures that female Alphas were prone to.
Unsurprisingly Ross and Stern did not miss a chance at getting a dig in at Tony, while they offered their “Condolences” they also pointed out how unsurprising it was for a civilian and an amateur to become injured when engaging in something they did not fully understand like warfare and combat.
“Well it sounds that way to me.” Steve growled, “And I am damned if I am going to be sat here and be accused of things I haven’t done.” He got to his feet and stormed over to the lift.
“I don’t know,” Tony whispered, he looked dazed, his eyes were too wide, like that of a deer caught in the headlights or a rabbit in a trap. He was confused and uncertain, bewildered as if he didn’t know where he was or what was going on.
“It was, and the truth is, the fact we were all suffering, hunger, disease, poverty, it made us hardened and blind to the injustices going on around us, it wasn’t until something extreme happened that our eyes were opened and we all had to see and realise that what was going on wasn’t right.”
With Tony cradled in his arms, Steve jumped through the museum window, shattering it with his shoulder and twisted in the air so his body took the impact when they landed outside. Natasha followed, tucking and rolling and sprung to her feet with the grace of a cat, “C’mon!” She shouted to the two men.
“No!” MJ yelled pounding her fist on the glass, “His Son, Peter, he’s in danger, you have to let us in!”
That was another difference. Steve’s Tony had never been so uncertain that he’d be second guessing himself, nor did he ever have that earnest, bordering on desperate desire to please in his eyes that this Tony did. At least, not until the aftermath of The Purple Man.
“Hold on baby boy.” Tony said, “I’m coming.” He took to the air flying through the factory, up to the third floor and went right on to the end of the corridor. He didn’t bother trying to find a door, he just blasted through the walls and shoved his way through smashing the brickwork that was in the way.
“They are pains in my ass.” Tony said as he went and threw himself down on the sofa besides Steve. “And back to the Doctor, we can’t speak with him because he’s dead. He conveniently died in a car accident of his own a month after Howard and Maria’s deaths.”
Norman met Tony’s gaze unflinching, one businessman to another, “Your Son’s education or your precious law suit.” He said, “If he is excluded then you will have difficulty getting him into any school, any decent one anyway, and I have plenty of influence with such schools, and colleges.”
From the air Rhodey fired at Proxima who screeched in rage, firing her own weapon back at him as she set hyena like creatures on Hawkeye, whom Falcon lifted into the air out of their reach as he rained arrows down on them.
After that he started going back out onto the streets, short patrols on Wednesday and Sunday nights, and a long patrol on Friday night.
“Ladies, gentlemen, children, and other designations. Welcome to The Avengers, ten-thousand calorie challenge, starring Clint Barton!”
Peter went up to his room and got onto his laptop, setting about doing his homework, while he was typing an e-mail came through from Ned asking him about the Web fluid and his suit.
Clint and Bruce began a meaningless conversation to pass the time until Thor and Sam returned, when they did Steve had a cup of terrible coffee pushed into his hand and a prepacked sandwich dropped on his lap along with a bag of crisps and a chocolate bar.
“I’m kind of a solo act, but in the event of like an invasion, then I’d be happy to help. I mean I can’t be a friendly neighbourhood spiderman if there’s no neighbourhood can I?”
Curien laughed sounding almost as if he were bordering on hysteria, “God, for someone so smart you are really fucking dumb aren’t you Stark?” His breath hitched as Steve’s powerful hand wrapped about the shin of his injured leg.
“Look after them!” Steve yelled to Sam and Thor, meaning Zach and Peter, then he too dove under the water just as Clint surfaced laughing. His laughter died when he saw the expressions on Thor and Sam’s faces.
“Ah, that’s the stuff,” Clint said, getting to his feet and straightening his shirt, “You looking for Tony?” he asked Rogers, “Because he’s not here. He and your really, really big brother have gone to a Gala.”
“I can.” Peter replied from inside the cubicle, “Its safer here, you don’t know. I’ve been proposition by five people MJ, five! Three girls and two boys and they want to do things with me in spandex!”
Both Steve and Tony were silent considering this, “So what was the endgame?” Tony asked, “Ross wasn’t just going to build himself a super human army and leave it at that, what is his plan?”
“Thanks J.” Peter’s stomach twisted at doing this, at lying to Jarvis. He hoped he wouldn’t get the AI in trouble with Tony when Tony inevitably found out about what Peter and his friends were doing. Jarvis wouldn’t have been listening to their conversation, he didn’t do that unless prompted to do so by Tony, and Peter knew his Mother wouldn’t do such a thing. He’d have only had Jarvis check they were still in one piece every once in a while. So right now no one but himself, Ned and MJ knew of their plans and he could stop it right here, he could just go back up to bed and get some sleep then tell his parents about MJ’s suspicions in the morning.
“I know honey, I’m so sorry. I’ll be with you as soon as I can, just…just breathe, deep breathing, Clint says you mustn’t push until you are ten centimetres dilated.”
“Steve just kissed me.” Tony said to himself. “He kissed me, held me in his arms after I puked,” he looked down at himself, his nose wrinkling, “And I have puke on myself, yet he hugged me!”
Peter made himself keep going, past the cages and towards the tanks where he found creatures that belonged in horror movies.
“It’s for the best Tony, it’s what you deserve.” Steve said to him, and Tony looked up to see Steve dressed in Captain America regalia holding his shield over his thighs, “This is justice.”
“Even so.” Steve said, “And if you follow that line of thinking, does that mean every public figure who has children are to blame when people attack their children, hold them for ransom, or threaten their lives? No, of course not, it is the perpetrator who is responsible.”
“What?” That didn’t make sense to Steve, he’d read the file, the report on Vanko and the dead CEO Hammer, they’d been the ones responsible for the disaster at the Expo, not Tony. The file had also contained the true account of what had happened with Stane, not the one that the public had been informed of. How Tony would handle telling Zach about his Father, Steve didn’t know, he certainly didn’t envy Tony the task of telling the little boy that his Father had been a murderer, had tried to kill Tony while he’d been pregnant with Zach.
By 1992 betrothals were rare in Europe and America, but were still legally binding, so Tony had no choice even though Howard and Maria were dead, to agree and marry Obie.
MJ rolled her eyes and leaned forward, lowering her voice even though there was no one but them in the living room. Likewise Peter and Ned leaned forward too.
With his suit still compromised and the fact he was sporting several fractures, Tony wasn’t going to be fighting, his job was to disable the engines and get the hell out, leaving Steve and Sam to handle any Hydra assholes that got in their way.
As soon as MJ cut the alarms Peter broke through the door and marched into the lab. He make out shapes of things but it was too dark to see anything clearly. Fumbling around he found a light switch and gagged at the what he saw.
Tony shot him a leer which the Director returned as Steve stammered, his cheeks flushed red as he tried to protest Fury’s words, while assuring Tony of how important he was.
“Baby sitting,” Clint replied, glancing at Rogers before looking back to the infant and bopping her on the head with the teddy bear he was waving over her head. She let out a shriek of laughter and made grabby hands for the toy. “Oh you want bear, you want bear do you? Well you’ve got to do better than that!” he bopped her on the head with the bear again and lifted it just out of reach, teasing her and making the infant squirm and giggle until he finally let her have the bear, which she promptly began to chew on!
“Yeah, on the other side of the Island.” Tony said, “There’s a cliff face and several rocks you can dive from, the sea is deep enough that you won’t hit the bottom.”
It had been heart breaking when Zach had come to him, asking Steve to teach him how to fight bad guys, so that no one could hurt his Mamma anymore.
Eight months, Jesus Christ, eight months! Digging the needle in deeper, Tony snarled into the Man’s face, “My baby?”
“Dad, what’s going on, you’re being all weird and….smiling like a demented clown.” Peter set his laptop to one side, “Is there something wrong, with Mamma?”
“Well Sir is troubled over his lack of grief over his Mother. He fears that he is a bad person because he did not feel the loss of her as greatly as you and others have for their own Mother’s.” Jarvis explained to Steve as the Captain made his way to the lift to go down to the lab. “Sir was not close to his Mother. From what have learned over the years, she was not a Mother too him, was not well enough in her own mind and heart to be a Mother, and while I do believe she loved her Son, she did not care for him as she should have, or protected him from his Father.”
Tony, Steve, Peter, and Zach watched the press conference from Peter’s hospital room. Zach had been brought in by Clint after his breakfast and was now sat in Steve’s lap staring up at the TV with wide eyes.
“I’m not happy about how you went about this.” Steve said, “We need to have a long conversation about trust and honesty, and I need to convince you that I love you regardless of age. But.” He smiled, “If there is a chance for us to make a baby then I don’t want to throw it away.”
“God forgive me, I’m sorry Buck.” Steve choked out, wrapping his arms about Tony’s neck he kicked down onto Bucky’s face, kicking him repeatedly until the soldier let go and Tony was able to get them away.
“Peter.” Tony breathed rushing to his side, narrowing the beam he cut through the restraints freeing his son.
“Yeah it’s all sorted.” Rhodey replied, sitting down in one of the arm chairs, “Any word from the UN, all this shit kind of messed up their session.”
“So, what do you fancy?” Steve asked, “To eat I mean,” At Tony’s snicker he groaned, “Food wise, not… not that!”
Tubes and wires rose up and out from beneath the brace connecting to dozens of machines that beeped and hummed, yet more tubes extended from Tony’s arms, IV’s were set up and were slowly dripping fluids into his veins, blood, saline, antibiotics, pain relief. Under the bed sheets more tubes were inserted into Tony’s anus and urethra to collect the waste as drained from his body, discretely being drained away into bags that were hidden from view.
“No need to get so upset.” Natasha added, eyeing Steve and Tony. They weren’t bonded, but Steve was giving off protective vibes like a beacon, he was practically screaming out, “My Omega, My Omega!” and the funniest part was, he didn’t seem to realize that he was doing it.
“What happened to kicking my ass?” Steve asked, certainly not complaining, not when he had Tony flush against him and his juicy ass clutched in his hands.
The reporters and journalists quietened down, and Pepper glanced down at her notes noticing that her hands were shaking, not much, but enough for her to notice and despise her bodies weakness for it. She cleared her throat and began to speak;
“Best get her some breakfast then,” Tony said, sliding off the bed, he staggered towards the door, uncoordinated and disoriented with his half asleep state, something that Steve suspected would not change until he’d downed a gallon of coffee, God knows his Tony had never been able to function without drinking pounds of coffee every day, his blood content had to have been at least three parts coffee!
Dumm-E beeped sadly at his side and nudged at Tony’s shoulder with his camera, “S’ok, bud.” Tony said, giving him a pat the way one would a dog, “I’m just being sentimental and sappy.” Sighed he got to his feet and tilted his head from side to side until his neck cracked, “Pull up my work list Jay, and lets get some shit done.”
“Then that’s where we’re going.” Tony said, turning around so he was facing Steve, realizing how close they were once more, almost touching, “Once we’re ready to, of course.” He cleared his throat and moved slightly away from Steve, his skin tingling as if feather light touches had been run over him until all his nerves were hyper sensitive.
“Watch it, or I’ll dunk you and leave you down there permanently.” Tony growled at Clint. The archer stuck his tongue out and settled down to enjoy the sun for a while.
Out of the corner of his eye he caught sight of olive skin and a white vest top. Kicking his legs Steve swam in that direction, finding Tony floating in the water, air bubbles leaving his mouth and nose, his eyes closed and body limp.
Peter rose an eyebrow at him, “Liar.” He accused, “You wouldn’t ask Mamma out on a date until the two of you had nearly been killed in front of each-other.”
“The bullet went through his back.” Bruce said, not unkindly, but needed Thor to understand what that meant, “It was a centre shot Thor, dead centre, so unless a miracle took place, his spine was hit and most likely severed.”
The entertainment took Tony’s mind off his roiling stomach and throbbing back, and he was able to ignore it until it was time for dinner. Then it seemed to get much worse, with the throb shifting around to start cramping in his lower abdomen.
Tony also needed to get Zach to his lab as soon as possible and start working on stabilizing Extremis.
The Chitauri fell to the ground, the leviathan crashing down, their connection to the Mothership severed.
“The lockers are on the surface level where the garage is. My locker is 17A, phone pin 1999, but why…” He didn’t get the finished the question as Tony delivered a sharp blow to the back of his head with his fist rendering the Doctor unconscious.
“He won’t be conscious for a while.” The consultant said to the detective who came in once the officers had reported that they had found Curien, “He’s in an induced coma to help his healing and will be for the next ten days.”
He brushed his teeth, ran a brush through his hair and got into his pyjamas, getting under the bed covers and said goodnight to Tony and Steve when they came and kissed him goodnight. Some people might think that his age he was too old for a kiss goodnight, but Peter liked it, it made him feel warm and safe.
Humming Clint looked over the counter until he found the limes and a knife and set about wedging them.
“I know, but you can do it, you can do this.” Steve encouraged him, taking a damp cloth that was shoved into his hand by Clint.
“Ohh he is so feisty, and seriously hot when he is mad. I’ll bet that you could fry eggs on that suit of his!”
“Trying to keep me in shape, Cap?” Tony teased, his own cheeks a little red from Steve’s suggestive comment.
As they stood on the battle field of Wakanda surveying the damage and helping the clean up, Steve had a brilliant idea. “Why don’t we get married here?”
Recollection of the night before came to him and he almost blushed at the thought of spending a night eating desserts and watching cartoons with grown men. Even if said grown men had engaged in a spoon fight over profiter rolls.
“Its time for you speech,” She said, handing him her own napkin, since his had been screwed up into a ball and discarded, “Wipe your mouth, there is drool on your chin!”
“Oh for christ sakes gag him!” The driver complained, “I don’t want to listen to that all the way to Miami.”
“I’ll tell you it in fifteen if it’ll make you believe me!” Steve snapped, “Fuck sakes!” he shoved back from the bed and began to pace the floor making Tony envy him for the ability to do so, it seemed you really didn’t appreciate being able stomp around or storm off until you were unable to do it anymore.
“The bomb was made by my Father for the Vietnamese war.” Tony explained, “At the end of the war, all the remaining weapons and arsenal should have been destroyed or shipped back to the US. But not all Generals play by the rules. Some like to line their own pockets, which this one did, and the remaining Stark weapons were sold to a black market arms dealer, who then sold them on to the Russians, where they were backwards engineered to improve soviet tech, put back together and left in a silo for thirty odd years, until Sokovia purchased weapons from Russia to aid them during the war. The Government could not afford state of the art weapons and had to make do with stuff that was decades out of date, including the bomb that malfunctioned and killed Wanda’s parents.” Tony spread his arms and sighed deeply, “So I did not kill her parents, I am not directly responsible for Ultron, I have done nothing but try to help you and be a friend to you, but I see now that such a thing is impossible. You don’t want a friendship with me, you want nothing but what you can get from me, well let me tell you here and now Rogers. I am done with you. I do not want to see you again, I do not want you calling me, texting me, or coming anywhere near me, do you understand?”
Again Peter nodded. Maybe if he got his senses under control then it might turn out to be kind of cool to have them, enhanced senses could be useful in a battle. He could see and hear danger before it approached, he’d be able to smell toxins and track scents. He could be a superhero!
Zach sucked in his bottom lip and worried his fingers nervously in his lap. He didn’t want to show it but he was very scared, very scared. He didn’t know where his Mamma was, his Daddy and Peter were hurt and he was on his own with strange bad people. He wanted to cry but he wouldn’t do it, he would be brave and strong, he would make his Mamma and Daddy proud. He was Iron Man’s Son and no one was going to see him cry.
Grinning Tony broke away from Steve’s mouth and began to kiss his way down Steve’s throat, nipping the skin lightly with his teeth, while he reached down towards his right thigh and grabbed hold of his pyjama bottom using it to lift the limb and move it.
Pepper selected him a pair of Ralph Lauren vintage style jeans with a Dolci and Gabbana cotton martini fit shirt in light blue, tucked in at the waist and a Dolci and Gabbana belt slipped on for added style, and to complete the look a Gucci wool blazer in charcoal grey.
Tony allowed the teenagers to stay up until One AM as it was Friday and they wouldn’t have to be up early on the Saturday, he then sent them off to bed, wishing Peter a goodnight before going to bed himself with Steve.
“Yeah,” Steve said, “Well, adopted, biologically she’s Tony and Pepper’s…,” he paused, “I mean, my reality’s Tony and Pepper. She acted as surrogate for us, me and Tony I mean. I couldn’t be sure what effect the serum would have on a baby, so Tony donated… what was needed,”
“Sure he does,” Peter said jumping over the back of the sofa, something Happy let him get away with where Tony would have scolded him, “And we’ve got lots of delicious junk food to eat while we watch bad Sci Fi movies that Mamma never lets us see.”
Seeing that this was a losing battle Sam sighed and nodded, “Thank you.” He said to Tony who barely acknowledged it, ten grand was hardly worth mentioning to him.
“I don’t see why not.” Steve agreed, “We can work out in the gym together, so long as you can keep up with your schoolwork too.”
“I think it is almost a given that he will.” Tony sighed, reaching around to scratch the back of his head, “There are too many similarities with this world and the one Steve is from. We can’t ignore this threat.”
As for those of you who are bullying others. I won’t name you or ask you to stand up. I will say this. Stop. Now. You might think you are funny; you might think you aren’t doing anything serious; you might think this is all a big joke. Well guess what, it is not, and this behaviour, this could follow you, out of school, when it comes time to applying for colleges they will want to know what kind of person you before they grant scholarships and the like, they aren’t going to want someone who is known to be violent or disruptive on their campus. Future employers won’t have someone like that working for them, and remember, thanks to social media practically your whole life is on display for the world to see, so if you do get named as a bully, then colleges, employers, even future romantic interests will likely learn of it and be disinclined to accept you.
Since becoming enhanced Peter’s appetite had shot through the roof. He’d initially lost weight as he had struggled to eat enough to maintain his body weight now his metabolism was running so much faster.
Tony grit his teeth and groaned, Zach was becoming much to good at making arguments like this to try and get his own way, and the worst part was that he knew exactly how to make himself look innocent and adorable while doing it which meant that it pulled on Tony’s heart strings when he had to stand firm and say no.
“Oh is that right, are you giving Uncle Happy a hard time, Stellina?” Tony asked bouncing Zach slightly, “How about we go have a bath, eh? Lots of big bubbles and we’ll get you ready for bed, yeah?”
“Miami. A.I.M is based in Miami. Owner of the company…..” Tony slapped the steering wheel in frustration as he tried to recall the name of the billionaire owner and creator of the outfit. Pepper had a meeting with him recently, Happy had been unhappy about it. Alan…Arlen….Adrian? Tony couldn’t remember.
“I’m not him.” The words were out of his mouth before he could stop them and Tony regretted them the moment he saw the hurt on Steve’s face.
The sky was crystal clear and an impossible shade of blue, the sun was shining brightly and making the sea sparkle and the sand seem golden.
Steve nodded and looked to Bucky with a welcoming smile, holding out his hand for Bucky to shake, “I know I’m not the Steve Rogers you grew up with, but I did know your counter-part very well and I am pleased to meet you, Sergeant Barnes.”
Rogers’ eyes widened and his expression turned murderous, “You told the Police?” He shouted at Tony, grabbing him by the arms and shaking him violently. Tony let out an animalistic howl at his broken arm being jostled, and Rogers was landed flat on his back, as Steve’s fist met with his face for a second time. This time it broke his nose, completely smashing it.
Screaming like a little girl, Clint and tumbled out of the vents and landed on his ass, disoriented and confused, which became embarrassed when a video of the whole thing was played on every TV, Phone, and Tablet owned by the team. Tony had set up a mini camera on the Dalek so it recorded everything.
Sighing, he poured a cup of coffee and lifted it to his lips to take a sip, only to drop the cup, shattering it on the floor, as a blinding white light exploded in the lab, a swirling vortex appeared in the centre of the light, spreading out until it was six foot by six foot.
As they had shared countless time before, Natasha and Clint took the second bedroom without batting an eyelid, leaving Thor, Bruce, and Sam in the third room.
The week before Christmas was utter mayhem as everyone was buying last minute gifts, checking that they had everything for Christmas dinner, Sam was heading back to Washington to be with his Mother for Christmas, Clint was going to his family, whom he had finally told the team about and would be bringing them to New York in the New Year to meet everyone.
Steve took the time to speak quietly with Bruce about the Sceptre and what he and Jarvis had discovered. Jarvis had been working remotely from Prague having not left until today as he’d wanted to remain by Tony’s side.
The reason Steve had seen the flash of red in Tony’s eyes that night had been because he had felt hope at Steve’s declaration of love. Wanda’s spell had trying to prevent him from feeling anything but despair and had flared up when he’d felt hope at Steve’s words.
Vaguely he was aware of Zach crying and the others calling out, but all he could focus on was the lack of air and the cold closing in on him.
He’d had nightmares after Afghanistan, nightmares where he’d be back in the cave, being tortured by the Ten Rings, with Raza looking on, sadistically amused as his men brutalized Tony.
“Oh call me Tony,” The billionaire said with a wave of his hand, which he regretted as it pulled on his ribs, he heard a subtle cough from behind him and half turned, “Sergeant Wilson, meet my good friend, Steve Rogers.”
Not far away was Thor, his skull beaten in and his brains spilling out across the ground, Mjolnir laying near his side, just out of reach of his lifeless fingers.
“Well, this thing has Tony’s memories, that suggests that there was some kind of link between them, one that I would guess is now broken, since this things form was revealed against its will. He was electrocuted right?” Rhodey nodded, “Tony may have felt a jolt through the link, something to… give him some encouragement and maybe spark some hope in him that help is coming, all he needs to do is send us a sign.”
“Zach.” Tony said not looking up from tracing Zach’s face with his fingers, “Zachary Yinsen Stark.” He smiled down at his Son, staring into baby blue eyes, “We are going to have so much fun together as you grown up, I’m going to teach you so much about the world and how everything works, and I’m going to teach you how to speak, how to walk, and I’ll play with you everyday, we’ll go on camping trips, beach trips, horse riding, rock climbing, I’ll even take you flying one day, when you’re bigger. I’ll make you a special suit and harness so you can fly with me.” He lifted Zach up and kissed his forehead. “It’s going to be perfect, I promise.”
From there it was a matter of digitally mapping out the old expo which Jarvis did, revealing a new element, one that hadn’t yet been synthesized. (Yet)
The image, while amused, was not encouraging when it came to imagining Tony in charge of his personal safety.
“I know.” Steve said a little defensively, “But we can prove they are lying, go to the authorities, warn them of what Pierce, Sitwell, and Hydra are planning.”
However, the insecure thoughts did not linger in Tony’s mind, one look at the adoration in Steve’s eyes and the very hard reminder at his thigh was clear enough indication of what Steve’s thoughts were in regards to his body.
Wade mimed zipping his lips and then made a wanking gesture on the left side of his mouth while shoving his tongue into the right cheek.
I’m thrilled that so much has changed and I want to tell people about it, but I worry that if I mention it at all then they’ll think I’m being mocking or am lying or something when I’m not, and gay marriage! People went to prison for homosexual relationships in my day, or were considered insane and thrown into asylums, yet now we have Pride parades in New York!”
“Oh.” Steve managed to cover it but couldn’t help but feel elated at Tony’s admission. He’d always thought the Billionaire was off limits because of his relationship with Pepper, but now he was single which meant there was no reason that Steve couldn’t pursue him. Well, none but Tony’s health, which clearly needed addressing.
The restaurant that Steve had chosen for them was a small, family run steak house. While he was enjoying trying new cuisine, Steve still liked the foods he was familiar with and had always enjoyed, Steak especially, since meat had been rationed during in the war, and difficult and expensive to buy, at least decent cuts had been during the depression, a really good steak had been a rare treat.
“Shower’s free.” Peter said, coming out of the bathroom rubbing his hair dry on a towel. At the familiar music of the DR Who soundtrack he rolled his eyes, “Really, we even have Dr Who here?”
Steve cursed wanting to get to Tony and not being able. The battle seemed to be lasting too long, the minutes stretching out and Tony still not moving, still not making a sound over the coms, just laying there on the ground.
Natasha and Clint were thrown back too, tucking and rolling, covering their heads as debris rained down on them.
“Fucked if I know,” he winced and looked down at the infant, “Don’t tell your Mommy and Daddy that I swore, okay sweetiepie?”
“Well you don’t have the right do that, Stark,” Wanda sneered, “You’re not an Avenger anymore,” her smug smirk did not last for long, as Tony, steeled himself and glared at her,
Tony smiled easily, “Lily is beautiful. Probably the most beautiful baby I have ever seen. You will undoubtedly get to see her at some point, but we didn’t want to overwhelm her with all the cameras and noise today.”
Happily Zach did as she said, running at top speed into the school eager to get to class and start his first lesson.
Thankfully the serum and his years of hard missions made him able to handle the long trek from Hungary to Austria, keeping up a jog that would have had a normal person struggling to maintain, especially after hours with no rest and only a little food and drink.
“He has suffered serious internal trauma due to the bullet,” The consultant went on, “It appears that the electromagnet in his chest altered the trajectory of the bullet, so instead of going in a straight line through his body it arched up and cut through his gallbladder, stomach, and spleen as it exited his body. The damage to his stomach and gallbladder were repairable, and we have removed his spleen which had stopped the bleeding.”
This was a problem and one the two of them had been dealing with since Zach had learned how to walk and when he was able to scramble out of his cot and make his way to his Mother’s bedroom when he was eighteen months old.
“True.” Tony said, “The serum made you super healthy, where my body has been through a shit load of abuse. It really might not be possible and….well as much as I love you Steve I don’t think I could face IVF, the treatments are really gruelling and not guaranteed.”
Footage was also recorded of a two day long argument between Tony and Clint as to which was better, Star Trek or Star Wars, and was finally settled with the two battling it out on the playstation until Tony defeated Clint, who buried his sorrows in cookies.
Natasha would then be nearby, her legs a mangled ruin beneath her crumpled body, her intestines spilling out over her ruined thighs.
“Of course I have no proof.” Jarvis said, “But her powers came for her being exposed to the Sceptre, if I might suggest myself, Dr Banner, and Friday examining the Sceptre closer we may be able to discover how the Witches powers work and how to neutralize them.”
Tony sighed, he liked cats, but he wasn’t sure that he had the time to deal with pets, however, one look at Zach playing with both kittens on the couch with such a look of adoration on his face and Tony knew he couldn’t say no.
“Hey, no you didn’t, and you were very brave for trying to face your fear. You should be proud that you did that, no beating yourself up because it triggered you.”
He had built them a fire which had provided some warmth but that was now burned low, there were only a few embers left and the air was cold.
“Get up Peter, Santa’s been!” Zach enthused, pulling back the duvet and began to tug on Peter’s arm until Peter got out of bed, he insisted on being allowed to go to the bathroom first so he could relieve himself and brush his teeth before he accompanied Zach to go and wake up Steve and Tony.
The smile Steve gave him was more generous and heart felt than ever the Steve from this reality had given him, and the gratitude far more genuine, “Thank you Tony, I’m very grateful for this,”
“No Stark, I was worried for Rogers.” Fury replied, “For some reason he likes you and would be deeply hurt by your loss, where I would be celebrating.”
“No one, not the full details, if you don’t include the team and family.” Steve said, “There has been a press release by Pepper, but it only said you were seriously injured not what your injuries were.”
“Can you imagine that, being awake while your chest is being carved open, feeling every cut, bone being severed and pulled out? I was beyond begging, beyond screaming, all I could do was lay there and wait to die. Only I didn’t, I lived, I survived, and instead of building them the weapons they wanted I miniaturized the arc reactor and built the first suit out of a box of fucking scraps.”
“It’s okay. I understand.” Steve said stoking his wet fingers up and down Tony’s arm. “I don’t like it, but I understand.”
The latter was explained when a left over from Woodstock staggered out of the bathroom telling his two bed partners not to go into the bathroom for twenty minutes.
“Juvie? You want to put two innocent kids into juvie because they are different?” Reynolds cried, “Why not go all the way and put them in a supermax?”
“You mean you won’t be dancing to the Star Spangled Man for my personal entertainment?” Tony placed a hand over his heart as if he were hurt making Steve snort with laughter.
“I don’t know. My hack was discovered and I had to cut the connection, I haven’t been able to get back in since then.”
Pepper was very taken aback when she was told that her alternate self, had been the surrogate mother of Lily. She stared at the infant who was laying in Tony’s arms during the meeting, blowing spit bubbles and babbling in baby-speak. She wasn’t quite yet up to actual words but it probably wouldn’t be long before she was.
Peter snickered from the back seat while Steve rolled his eyes, “It isn’t Camp Crystal Lake, Tony.” He said as he parked the car, “And this was never a summer camp and no one named Jason died here.”
This got Steve’s attention, he couldn’t say that he trusted Natasha that much, not yet, he didn’t know her well enough, but Tony seemed to have something personal against her. “What happened between the two of you?” He asked.
Steve was on the edge of his seat throughout most of the movie, fascinated by the story and even shed a few tears when M died in Bond’s arms.
Tony turned his head to the side, sweat beading his brow which was creased as he dreamed, or rather as he suffered his recurring nightmare.
The rest of the team ignored him, letting him suffer in solitude, however, Clint’s video was a hit on Youtube when he posted it the next day and plenty of fans began to ask for Steve and Thor to try the twenty-thousand calorie challenge since ten-thousand wouldn’t be that much of a strain for their metabolic rates.
“Several weeks ago while on a school trip to Oscorp, Peter Parker Stark was bitten by a spider that had been exposed to high levels of radiation, this incident did become public knowledge, as did his severe reaction to the bite which resulted in his hospitalization where he was in a coma on life support for several days.
“Ancient, I’m younger than you.” Steve protested, nudging Tony back, taking care not to use much strength, he didn’t want to knock him over. Tony of course retaliated, elbowing Steve and poking at him until the Captain lifted him up and carried him over one shoulder with Tony hooting with laughter, oblivious to the stares that came from the Shield staff observing their antics.
Tony snorted softly, because clearly things weren’t going to work out, their evening had already gone to shit.
Peter looked up at his friends, holding his breath as he waited for their response. He was cursing his heightened sense now because he could hear their heartbeats having quickened, their rapid intake of breath. He knew if he tried then he’d be able to smell the sweat gathering in the glands on their skin and see the hair standing up on the bodies. Ignorance really was bliss, being able to see someone’s bodily reaction when you waiting for them to respond was not enlightening, it just added to your own nervousness.
“Dude!” Ned breathed, “You’re a freakin’ superhero!” A grin spread over his face, “Holy cra….cow, My best friend is a superhero, this is so awesome, and I am gonna be like the your guy in the chair!”
As he reached the end of the tunnel he pushed open the grill with his feet and stepped out into the night air in Nassau County. Taking off his lab coat with some difficulty he wrapped it about his wounded shoulder and began walking along the road, hoping that a car would come along and he could get a lift to the nearest hospital.
"Hold still kid!" one of the lab techs said lifting the spider from Peter's leg, "Oh shit it's bit him!"
Fresh tears filled Tony’s eyes but these were tears of joy as he held his baby girl for the first time, taking in the details of her face, her chubby little limbs, tiny hands and feet, the wispy tuft of hair dusting her scalp, she was the most precious and perfect thing Tony had ever seen in his life.
Zach for once relented on his pancake argument but only because Bruce had cooked up banana and oatmeal muffins for breakfast instead of his beloved pancakes.
“You know I was sick a lot before the serum.” Steve said running his thumb over Tony’s scarred knuckles, years of electrical burns, scrapes, and other engineering injuries had taken their toll on Tony’s hands, they were calloused and scarred, showing the years of hard work and creation on his skin, something Steve loved to feel, the proof of Tony’s diligence and genius when they touched.
“No!” Tony screamed fighting against the restraints trying desperately to escape them to get to his baby, but Commander Kovarian ignored him, taking the baby out of the cell heedless of Tony’s screams.
He’d come to associate hospitals with nothing but misery since his Mother’s death and so far this new century hadn’t changed that view. He supposed it might change if and when he had a child with Tony, then they would be in a hospital for a good and happy reason, not one filled with fear.
Steve sighed his shoulders slumping in defeat, “Sorry Pete, I wanted to put you at ease.” He admitted, “I guess I’m not much good at this stuff huh?” He chuckled self-deprecatingly.
Thor leading a group of warriors from Space including a talking Racoon with a gun and a talking, walking tree!
But he had to go and spend Christmas with the others, had to act as if he was perfectly fine or he’d spoil this for everyone else.
They could not go to the hospital as Steve and Tony, nor as Captain America and Iron Man, they would be noticed right away and any chance of doing this without the police and the rest of the world knowing would be lost.
“Maybe.” Tony said, “We’ll ask him when he comes back.” He leaned down and kissed Zach’s head “Now you go off to sleep, remember you have to be asleep or Santa won’t come.”
“I think that’s enough, kid.” Clint said, patting his shoulder, he looked sadly at Natasha, “I thought you were better than this.” Natasha met his eyes silently pleading with him to save her, but Clint shook his head, “You made your bed, Nat. It didn’t have to be this way. But you chose to follow Rogers and cover up murder, now you have to pay the price.”
“My parents?” Tony whispered looking sick, his skin colour had leached away, his face was pasty and grey.
Immediately he began to panic, coughing and trying to spit the thing out of his throat but he was held down, the doctor and other people holding him telling him to relax, then slowly the thing, the tube was removed and Tony could cough and clear his aching throat.
“We’re gonna save the world today Morgan!” She declared to her baby sister, “Captain Iron Girl to the rescue, all enemies will be disintegrated!”
On the other hand. Tony had been in boarding school most of his childhood, he’d been packed off and pretty much abandoned by his parents, Howard being too busy with work and thoroughly disinterested in an Omega Son, while Maria had been too busy drowning in Valium, wine, and vodka.
Instead he aimed the repulsers at the ground and blasted off into the air, knocking Rogers from his torso, but the bastard wouldn’t let go, he held onto Tony’s boot, yanking him back down, and hit him again across the head with the shield.
“So we’ll have to go into Shield.” Natasha said with a shrug, “I’ve gotten in and out of worse places.”
Tony rolled his eyes, “Can’t you sing another song, Romanoff? You’re starting to sound like a record with the needle stuck in a groove.”
Zach nodded, wrapping his small hand around Mjolnir’s handle with Thor’s and they rose up into the air flying back to the hospital at a much slower speed than the one Thor had used to get Zach to the fountain.
“I do not disagree, I read the journal, he refers to Tony as The Infant, rather than his Son or by name. He also continued to examine Tony after he recovered, testing him, his reflexes, tolerance for pain, endurance, healing. He goes into detail of how swiftly Tony healed from a broken arm when he was nine months old, I can only hazard a guess as to how the limb was broken.”
While Steve didn’t want to think of it, he did not find it hard to imagine Howard being cruel to Tony, wanting to strip away his confidence so that the Omega would doubt himself. But how he could be cruel to his own Pup, especially if Tony had been anything like Zach, Steve had no idea. Just the thought of upsetting the adorable Pup made Steve sick to his stomach, he never wanted to see anything but a smile on Zach’s face, although, that pout was pretty cute too.
He headed down the marble stairs, admiring the art work adorning the walls, noting that there were no pictures of Tony, although there were several of Howard, including an oil painting. There were a couple of a woman that Steve assumed was Tony’s Mother, she was much younger than Howard and had a glazed kind of look about her in the photos.
By the time Zach and Peter got home from school Steve and Natasha had worked out a strategy for the ground assault on the Hydra base while Tony and Sam had worked out a coordinated arial strike. (They had stopped including Thor in strategizing because Thor’s main strategy when it came to battles while it hit everything that moved until it stopped moving and that also included air attacks)
When he got back to New York his kids were going to kill him, Steve was going to kill him, huh, maybe he’d just tie him to the bed, that could be fun.
“Is coming with me.” Tony said cutting her off. Gone was the playful and ease and in its place a steely resolve. He stepped forward getting into Natasha’s space and looking her dead in the eye, “Those fuckwits you work for just tried to nuke the city, frankly I trust them even less than I trust you. So there is no way in hell I am letting them get their claws on Bruce, understood?”
As Peter went with Tony to put his little brother to bed, the others quietly went with Happy, getting towels and sheets from a closet on their way.
“Umm, Dad said I’m grounded until next week and can only use the internet for school work.” Peter said, “Would researching how to make some kind of web like spider silk count as school work?”
Steve had to proceed with caution and try to keep Tony calm. “No one is going to get me, honey.” He said, giving Tony a reassuring smile, “I’m only going next door to get you some ice, I’ll only be a second or two.”
Steve was filmed lifting a bell bar with Tony, Zach, and Peter hanging off the bar, there was also filming of Steve doing push ups with Zach sat between his shoulders giggling as Peter counted the reps for Steve.
Steve winced as he heard a door slam and knew that it had been Tony who’d slammed it, “Wade, could you possibly consider not behaving in such a… you like way?”
Tony’s eyes were open but glazed as he rose from the bed, Steve was laid out snoring quietly but Tony didn’t see him, he didn’t see his bedroom, or the penthouse at all, what he was seeing was a wasteland of a destroyed, post-apocalyptic world.
“I hacked Oscorp.” MJ said with a shrug looking rather smug when the two boys gaped at her, “After Peter got bit, I was suspicious, because Spiders getting out of containment? That’s effed up. So I went looking on the Dark Web and eventually hacked into Oscorp’s mainframe.”
“Don’t go!” Tony’s voice came out as a frightened and hurried whisper, “You can’t… you’ll… they’ll get you if you go.”
Both Tony and Steve were easy-going as parents, letting Peter and Zach get away with a lot more than some parents would, they were both allowed to stay up late so long as it wasn’t a school night, were rarely refused activities, new toys, or games. They both had their own computers and all the latest apps and phones. They were dressed in high end fashion, had the latest trends in trainers, jeans, and other clothing, they didn’t really have chores to do beyond keeping their own bedrooms tidy and their grades up in school, and their allowances were eye-watering.
A spoonful of the pink goo and the headphones on and blocking out the noise and Peter’s headache began to subside and his stomach stopped twisting so painfully, allowing him to sit up straight without feeling like he was going to topple over or throw up everywhere.
“Dude, if you go there you’re gonna cause WWIII in like ten seconds flat.” Peter snorted, he sat down on the sofa, “Do you think Mr Stark would mind if we ordered snacks, I’m really hungry, like starving hungry. Like I might faint if I don’t eat soon hungry.”
“I know you do little Man, but he’ll be home soon.” Happy said, “And in the mean time you’ve got me, and you’ve got Dr Banner, and Peter.”
The host was a young bubbly blonde woman who seemed to have a permanent smile on her face and had a rather high pitched giggle that she used frequently. She was joined with a camera man and sound tech who seemed friendly enough as they were introduced to the team.
Zach closed his eyes tight and held his breath waiting for more pain to begin but the pain never struck as suddenly there came the sound of an explosion followed by Killian swearing and taking his hands away. Zach let out the breath he’d been holding and strained his upper body to sit up, looking about the lab and at the computer monitors which showed the outside of the factory and the destroyed gates where War Machine had set down and was firing at everything that moved. Two other monitors showed The Black Widow, and Hawkeye at different points in the factory, Hawkyeye from a vantage point shooting at Killian’s men and Natasha fighting on the ground.
Several of the UN security guards offered testimony as did other eye witnesses to what had occurred in Vienna.
Wanda managed to convince the Captain to take them as far as Zonguldak and from there they could get a train to Istanbul where they would be certain to find a ship heading to the Med and quite possibly one going to America.
“I just wasn’t expecting……it’s not every day you meet a celebrity.” The woman said, “I feel like I should ask for an autograph.”
Zach however wasn’t a fan of the oat bath and threw a tantrum about it, crying and shouting all the way through and kicking his legs so much that Tony and the bathroom were covered in soggy oats.
“You didn’t have to do all this.” Harley’s Mother, Grace Keener said, she was still reeling over Tony having bought the bank and written off her mortgage, a sum of money she could hardly fathom him gifting her and her family no top of all of the toys for the children.
“Morning, how are you feeling?” Steve asked cheerfully, he was already on the mend, his injuries far less visible and no longer painful thanks to the serum; Tony envied him that.
Tony put an arm around Peter’s shoulder’s “Peter was extremely traumatized by what he went through, he was in a coma for days.” He said glaring at Norman. “And he was too ill to return to school for weeks.”
Bracing his hands on the rocks Steve lifted himself out of the sea and followed after them, his heart skipping a beat as he saw Bruce taking Tony’s pulse. The Doctor nodded and with Sam he moved Tony onto his side and began to rub at Tony’s back.
“This could be embarrassing,” Tony murmured, trying to squirm free, but Steve only held on tighter and murmured against his neck, kissing him gently. Tony’s cheeks flamed and he willed his cock not to respond, not that it listened to him, hardening anyway.
“Freedom of speech, freedom of the press.” Tony said, rubbing at Steve’s shoulders; he was very touched by how offended Steve was on his behalf, this wasn’t the first time that the press and general public had questioned his abilities to be a parent and it probably wouldn’t be the last; but Steve’s support and his disgust at the comments helped to stifle his own doubts about his parenting skills.
Steve really wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he went to Shield, he did hand over the ten bucks to Fury though, never let it be said that Steve Rogers didn’t pay his gambling debts.
“A custom made terror threat.” Clint spat in disgust. He’d seen some sick shit in his time, too much really, but this was beyond belief. That someone could be low enough to become the face for a terror organisation just to get drug fixes and a few expensive gifts was unbelievable.
But Peter and Zach needed him to be strong, they needed him to be their father. Later, when they were asleep, then he could cry, when they weren’t there to see it, he could break down then, but right now he had to be a grown up and keep his shit together.
“My God you’re pathetic.” Rogers spat, “No wonder you’re parading around with these queers and fairies. You call yourself Iron Man, you’re not even worthy to call yourself a man..” Rogers diatribe was cut off as a large fist met with his face knocking him clean across the room.
“Yeah,” Steve’s smile was back and it was like the sunshine coming after a long and heavy downpour. “That’d be great.” His chest puffed out, he was so pleased with himself, “My first real Dance Date.”
“Yeah yeah, we’ll see.” Tony scoffed, very much doubting that Steve would be able to catch anything without actual equipment.
“Of course.” Steve said determinedly hiding the dread deep down inside him. Man up Cap, he told himself, it’s just snow, you are going to the park to have fun, there is nothing to be afraid of.
May exchanged a look with Bruce who looked back to Tony and Steve, “But you have had a heat while the two of you were together.”
He had made his peace with it, had been content to be Father to Peter and Zach alone, but now, the option of a baby of his own with Tony was available again, Tony was trying to give him that chance, was putting himself through so much to give this to Steve.
Tony pursed his lips and frowned hard as he thought, “We’d need to draw up a contract with the producers.” He said to Pepper, “NDA’s regarding some things, subjects that are not to be brought up, and final decision on all footage before it’s released to the public.”
“We could do an interview if you want.” Tony said, “I’ve received offers from various magazines wanting to do one with us.”
“Oh.” Steve fumbled with his loose sleep shirt which he’d started wearing since the weather had turned cold.
“And you are a brat who is grounded, and I’ll make the grounding literal if you don’t come down right now.”
After the speeches had finished, came the dancing with music being provided by a full orchestra, and drinks available from a very well stocked bar.
“Maybe he needs some time.” Tony offered by way of explanation, “He’s probably very confused and needs some time and space to get his head together, instead of looking for him, maybe we should give him that time, let him come to us when he’s ready.” He huffed a small laugh, “Its not like we’ll be hard to find, the entire world knows where the Avengers are.”
I can’t actually count the number of times that someone kicked my shins in school, or shoved me into a wall, tripped me when I was walking down the hall, blacked my eye or split my lip. It was a constant thing.
“We’re going to have to get on this, Steve,” Natasha said, to Rogers, “Your double has practically called you homophobic publicly. That’s going to create one hell of a backlash.”
“My Parents!” Tony yelled, “Your boyfriend murdering my parents!” Rogers paled. He’d never been a good liar, but his face revealed the truth without him having to say a word. It wasn’t shock on his face, or grief, it was guilt.
“Fuck the Starks, they’re all evil and deserve to die!” Wanda sneered. Balking as Steve rounded on her.
Steve tore after Zach nearly knocking an elderly couple off their feet as he went, shouting an apology over his shoulder he continued on, leaping down the steps in front of the hotel and charged down the street, “Zachary Yinsen Stark get back here right now!” He shouted at the boy who was at the end of the street waiting to cross the road.
“Okay then.” Steve pulled out into traffic and had to break hard as he was cut up by a sports car. Norman Osborn’s angry face glared at him from the drivers seat and Harry was scowling in the passenger seat.
As he came to what seemed to be a dead end he pushed in one of the bricks until it hit a mechanism which pushed it to the side revealing a palm scanner which Kovarian pressed his hand against, once the scan had been taken the wall slid back revealing the tunnel.
“Yeah.” Tony said, “Of course it’s only a theory and I’m sure religious groups and other scientists would be up in arms over it, but it’s as likely as any other belief out there.”
Despite their differences the team worked seamlessly, even if Hulk did punch Thor for some reason, Nat managed to get to Doctor Selvig who’d suffered a blow to the head and had the mind control knocked out of him, between them they managed to find a way to shut the portal down, except their was a Nuke coming in.
Tony awoke from a very strange dream when Steve came home from his ass crack of dawn run. For some reason Tony had been dreaming that he was a cat and lived in Central Park and was being courted by Cat Steve who kept bringing him birds and mice as courting gifts.
As the lift reached the Penthouse and they stepped out, Tony wondered what the worlds reaction would be to the New Steve Rogers, and what, this realities Steve Rogers would think when his “Big Brother’s” story was plastered all over the news papers for all to see.
“Our training sessions involve trust building exercises, simulated combat training and rescue missions. We do these both in full combat gear and in civilian clothes, so we will be prepared no matter what.”
“Yeah, I guess.” Tony murmured, “But you’re her Father, she should be calling you dad, not me.” Steve gave him a crooked smile,
He snickered at how eagerly Sam bounded up. Poor boy, he was obviously suffering some sort of brain damage, actually enjoying being beaten into the ground by sadistic red head.
“Do you have anymore information about this Chad Davies or know of anyone who might?” Tony asked eagerly.
“You shouldn’t be able to walk away from any kind of fuckery at all, because if you can then it must have been a big fucking disappointment.”
Toby beeped made an indignant popping noise with his springs, offended that Tony did not accept the blackened remains of bread that lay smouldering besides him.
Clint let out a laugh which got everyone’s attention; he held up the tablet showing them the photoshopped photo, which had Steve and Tony taking the places of a bride and groom before a church.
It was after all the tests had been concluded that the Doctor finally told him the extent of his injuries.
The receptionist gave him a withering look, "You'll have to wait for the Doctors to speak with you, I'll page them to let them know you've arrived."
“Lithium dioxide.” Fury said, “It’ll take the edge of the symptoms, help you get back to work. Help you fix this.”
At midnight Rogers and Natasha were taken into custody of the special task force sent to extradite them back to America. The power dampening collar was placed on Rogers’ neck robbing him of the serum and reducing him to the skinny asthmatic he had been before.
“Oh God, Oh my God, What have I done!” Tony cried, as he and Steve got into the limo, “What have I done?”
Natasha’s eye twitched, “I mean Shield. We’re not all bad.” She her tongue as Tony exploded in laughter at that statement.
Rhodey wouldn’t be far behind them, he was flying in from California having gotten immediate compassionate leave to come and be with Tony.
Bath time was always fun. Tony would run a shallow bath and get in the mammoth sized tub with Zach, sitting him on his lap and supported with an arm about his waist, splashing water over him which had Zach kicking his legs and splashing his hands in the water with glee and trying to catch the bubbles. Naturally the bathroom got a thorough drenching every day but seeing his Son’s delight was more important than that.
Firing up the repulsers, Tony closed the face plate and circled back around, “Maximoff, Wilson, Vision, back off. This is between me, Rogers, and Romanoff.”
What passed was a very comfortable nights sleep and Tony was in no hurry for it end, his young Son on the other hand had other ideas.
“And you’re right Pete, it doesn’t matter if Tony can walk or not.” Rhodey said, “He’s still our Tony, and nothing will change that.”
Inside him he felt the baby shift and push against the walls of his womb, the sensation made him double over and clasp his abdomen as if he’d been winded.
When he reached the penthouse floor, Rogers expected to be greeted by Tony, and his Other Self, but instead, he found Clint on his knees on the penthouse floor, waving a toy over the face of a giggling infant, who was laying on a play mat that had other toys dangling from arches over her head.
An hour later found Tony and Zach sat in the porches with 800lbs of weights plus the bike, plus Steve on top of the bike being lifted by Peter while the rest of the team watched.
This of course wasn’t the only lab that Osborn owned, but it was the only one in New York, now Curien would have to go elsewhere to continue his work. He mourned the chance to cut that spider brat open more, what he could have learned from him, his physiology, how he became what he was….ah well, next time.
Zach let out a cry of delight at his Mother’s voice, turning his head to see Tony, bloody, sweaty, and filthy dirty, aiming a gauntlet at Killian.
“He’ll give himself a nervous breakdown trying to control everything, and he’ll be flying about left and right and smack himself right into the side of a building! He’ll be like one of those pigeons that kamikaze the windows every so often, some innocent secretary will be typing away quite happily, then suddenly there will be a thud as Sam splatters over the window, scaring her half to death and we’ll get sued because she’ll spill her coffee all over herself and get third degree burns from it and psychological trauma and probably have a phobia of windows for the rest of her life!”
“It’s not all your fault, Pete.” Steve said, “Don’t start blaming yourself for everything and take the weight of the world on your shoulders. That’s your Mother’s job!” It was a weak joke but it did manage to make Peter smile a little. “You want to know how you can make this up to us?” Steve asked and Peter nodded eagerly.
Tony wet his lips and took a deep breath, forcing himself to remain calm, “The threat of Thanos is far from imagined, especially with the news that Steve has brought, and as for putting together an army, as you call it, I do not see how that is dangerous to anyone but an invading hostile force, as that is what it will be used for. All of us uniting to fight a common enemy.”
“Self-righteous, sanctimonious bastard!” Rogers hissed at the screen, glaring at his double. He didn’t believe half of what this other Steve Rogers was saying. After all, there was no way to prove what he was saying was factual, he could storify himself, make himself seem to be a great man, a hero, when he was nothing but a filthy queer.
Steve paced the halls with the others as they waited for news from the Doctors, who had been babbling about broken bones, internal bleeds, and medical jargon that meant nothing to Steve but Bruce seemed to comprehend it and sank down into a chair, hunching over looking pensive.
Steve stiffened besides Tony, he was tempted to just shove all the reporters aside and take Tony to the waiting car but he knew that if they refused to say something then the less scrupulous amongst them would make up rumours that Tony couldn’t cope with being in a wheelchair, that he was depressed and despairing, falling apart, etcetera, so while it was a nuisance it was better to give the hungry hyenas something to chew on.
Steve, being a polite guest, unlike Tony who was working his way through Sam’s coffee supplies and wouldn’t really begin to function until he’d down an entire pot of it; got the bagels sliced and warmed under the grill, and set up the butter, cream cheese, thin sliced honey roast ham, and a couple of spreads from Sam’s cupboards on the table, so that by the time Sam came back from showering and getting changed, breakfast was ready.
Steve snorted, Tony had lost that image the moment he’d fallen pregnant with Zach, occasionally old photos back from the nineties would be published but for the most part the world had moved on from the heavy drinking and wild party lifestyle that Tony had lead prior to Afghanistan.
Then, as Zach had gotten older he’d been content to be in his play pen in the lab, playing with his building blocks, his rattles, his bouncers, and other toys, fascinating the bots who had been curious about the small human who grew in size and like throwing about soft balls as much as they did.
“Friend?” Bucky half laughed half cried, “The man you were friends with died seventy years ago. I might have some of his memories but I am not that man. Not after all I’ve seen and done and survived. All I wanted was to be left alone, Rogers, and if you really were my friend you’d have granted me that.”
The two were distracted as Sam beat Clint and pinned him down whooping loudly and declaring that the nights movie would be Vertical Limit rather than Robin Hood Prince of Thieves.
Tony had, had enough already, “Alright fuckwit, the Mandarin, the real one, has kidnapped my Son, put one of my best friends in hospital, and my elder Son, not to mention blowing up my house and nearly killing me. I am right at the end of my frigging rope with this shit and if you don’t start talking, I am going to do so much damage to your ugly mug that not even your dentist will be able to identify you!”
“Yeah, it’s a form of punishment without a person going to prison. They are electronic tagged and made to remain in their homes between certain times of the day, but they can still move freely otherwise and interact with their families and so on.” Tony swiftly explained.
“Bitch, you bitch, where’s my Son?” He roared at her yanking on the zip ties so hard they cut into his wrists, “Where is he? I’ll cut your fucking face off and staple it to your ass if you don’t..” One of the thugs punched him in the face stopping the speech.
“Liar!” Peter cried, “I said Komodo Dragons eat people, not tiny lizards. Its not my fault you wet yourself because it found you a nice bed!”
While Steve got breakfast ready, Tony took Zach and Peter to do their business in the woods and then made sure that Zach washed up properly afterwards. Peter was old enough to do this without prompting, but Zach still forgot hygiene when he was distracted or over excited.
“I’ve multiple movies backed up on Netflix and Amazon prime.” Steve said, “Plus playlists of extremely loud noise which our teenage son claims is music.” Steve looked very unconvinced of this, but then he said much the same about Tony’s taste in music.
As the lights came on Steve took his phone from his pocket and found he had several text messages and missed calls from Tony, some asking what they hell he was doing, to answer his damn phone, and ordering him to “Get his perfect ass to the hospital because Tony need to kick his ass, thank him, and kiss him in that order!”
Zach turned, blew a raspberry and ran across the road reaching the other side just as the lights changed and Steve was left with traffic blocking him.
Tony bit down on his bottom lip and gripped the bedsheets, twisting and turning as Steve sucked him down, his teeth providing a wonderful friction and his tongue tormented him and drove him half out of his mind.
Steve had thought that he’d experienced excitement from fans back in his stage days, but this was unlike anything he’d faced before; crowds of people screaming in his face, shoving cameras, phones, and microphones at him, demanding comments, answers, even daring to ask intimate questions about his and Tony’s sex life.
Chuckling Steve got himself up and headed to use the other bathroom and then went to get breakfast ready.
While Rhodey, with the War Machine armour now arrived and at his disposal, and Vision, took charge of escorting Rogers, Natasha, and Wanda to prison and keeping them under guard until an extradition team came to take them back to America, (And brought a power dampening collar for Rogers), the others went back to the hotel.
“Have you any idea how embarrassing it was to make the damn video?” Steve countered, “Or how many condoms I had shoved into my boots, socks, art supplies, inside my draws, and even left in my coffee mug by Clint and Tony after I’d done the video?”
Harry, Norman's obnoxious brat was boasting, his best friend Flash, and really, who names their kid the uphermisim for indecent exposure? was right by his side as always and making snide remarks back at Peter as he always did. Flash liked to try and bully Peter. Emphasis on try because as much of a geek as Peter was, his family were the Avengers and it wasn't just Zach who was being taught self defense. Also there were only so many times you could be told that "Stark only adopted you out of pity" before it became white noise.
Running through the streets and through central park helped Peter to clear his head and deal with the nervous anxiety that had been plaguing him all day. Steve’s pace was punishing, one that a normal person wouldn’t be able to maintain for more than a short sprint, but as they were both enhanced the pair kept the speed going until they were on their return trip to the tower, heading to a fast food place for pizza and burgers on the way.
Bastard, bastard mother fuck Howard, and Tony needed a drink, dear God he needed a drink, and he didn’t mean a soft drink either.
“The knee and thigh took the brunt of the impact by the looks of it.” She said, “I’ll need an X-Ray to confirm but prelim suggests fractured femur and smashed patella.”
Tony had a concussion from where his head had hit the inside of his suit and fractured his skull, and smoke inhalation that was made worse by his decreased lung capacity, but if a rest and time on oxygen he was expected to make a full recovery.
Zach gave a squeal of delight and wrapped his arms about Steve as tight as he could, “Love you Daddy.”
The host faced the camera and smiled even wider, “Welcome, Ladies and Gentlemen, to a first time ever, exclusive access to, The Avengers Tower, and the Avengers themselves.
Tony jerked up, this was not what he’d been expecting to hear, he’d thought Steve would tell him to go to Therapy, to get himself sorted out, to go on medication or something, he’d not thought that Steve would have a scientific theory for his nightmares rather than a psychological one.
The Doctor gagged and implored Tony with his eyes until he lessened his hold on his throat enough so he could speak.
Tony turned looking blinding through the smoke and dust until his eyes came upon Zach, the burned charred remains of his baby boy.
Thor was always ravenous after a battle, so was Bruce, so was Steve normally, but with Tony’s life hanging in the balance he had no appetite at all.
For a moment the two teams froze, neither side giving or taking ground as they stood off against one another. Tony swallowed hard and turned to Rhodey, pushing Lily into his arms,
Neither needed to be told twice, happily vacating the directors office and going back to the life where they were met by Rumlow and his strike team. Steve subtly put himself between Tony and the team of Alphas. He kept his hands loose at his sides but his muscles were all tensed and ready to fight if necessary. The heavy scent of Alpha in the air did nothing to ease his concerns for Tony. Out numbered and out of his suit he was in serious danger if things turned nasty.
Killian laughed, “Oh, so dramatic Tony, all that rage in your eyes, the maternal instincts to protect your progeny must be driving you insane right now.”
“I want to go with you.” Peter said suddenly surging forward and throwing himself into Tony’s arms, “I wanna stay with you and Zach.”
Tony had always had a slim but healthy body mass, enough muscle and fat over his bones in proportion to his height, he’d never been a body builder, he kept himself fit but didn’t spend hours working on it. Now though, his clothes were hanging off his gaunt frame and his bones were painfully visible.
“Tony that isn’t true. You didn’t invite Killian to shoot up Zach with the virus, you didn’t tell Osborn to have his spiders bite Pete, you didn’t do any of this.”
“Stupid middle age metabolism.” He grumbled, recalling a time when he’d been able to eat his body weight in treats without gaining an ounce, much as Peter did now, but it seemed that his age was starting to catch up with him.
“There are no need for restraints.” Tony said, “Sergeant Barnes is willingly going to the station, he has made no aggressive moves towards anyone, he does not need to be cuffed.” The police weren’t happy about this, but after some more arguing they agreed and Bucky found himself being led to a car and shown into the back seat with Tony climbing in besides him.
Once Breakfast was over, Tony sent Zach and Peter off to wash and dress, getting a few minutes with Steve along before Bruce came into the kitchen in search of breakfast and coffee.
“Sir, I have a list of persons who have taken leave of absence or resigned.” Jarvis piped up, “I have taken the liberty of discounting those whose reasons were genuine.”
Then I woke up to fight a world where the President of the USA is black, people who beat their children are prosecuted, and Homosexuality is not only legal but homosexuals can get married and adopt a child or have a surrogate carry a child for them.” He smiled at the host, “It is definitely a world that was worth almost dying for and I am glad that I have been given the chance to experience it.”
They had hitched a ride in a HGV Truck to Nitra, the driver taking them in his cab with only a slight hint of persuasion from Wanda, a little more had him buying them meals along the way so they ate well as they travelled to Nitra.
“Than why make a plea deal?” Tony asked, “Why not just take what was coming if you are being so hard done by.”
Trembling, panicking, Peter tried to hold onto him, tried to keep his head from smacking on the floor, but it made no difference, the man fell completely limp after a few moments, his eyes staring blankly ahead as a thin stream of the black liquid continued to drip from his open lips.
“Relax Feather-head.” Tony said, he was the most relaxed out of everyone. Having had cameras around him all of his life he knew what to expect and how to respond. “Just chill and be yourself, then everything will be fine.”
“No you won’t Cap.” Tony said, “I’ve room for you too. We’ll head to the Mansion, get cleaned up, eat, and then move your stuff from your apartment.”
“You can’t shoot Norman Osborn Tony, we’ve been through this.” Steve said, “And Pete, I can’t think that a bit of name calling and trash talk being enough to make you lash out.”
“Yes, I’ve got your Mamma as my “Guest” and he was very keen to know all about you, so much so that he was willing risk having his face melted off.” Killian lifted his hands and held them out palms up to show Zach as they became red hot. “Do you think you’d recognise your Mamma without his face?” He asked grinning down at Zach, “Do you think he’d recognise you without yours?” he approached the gurney and lay his hands down either side of Zach’s head, “Shall we find out?”
“Morning.” Tony replied, he looked deliciously sleep mussed; his hair was still tangled, there were pillow creases on his face, and his dressing gown was open at the chest revealing the glow of the arc reactor.
The head teacher eventually managed to get the school back under control and outlined a new anti-bullying policy that was to be implemented from that day onwards, where a student could approach any member of staff and report bullying directly and would remain anonymous whether or not it was themselves who were being bullied or a peer. Bullies would from then on be named in assembly, their parents would be informed, and other actions, if required would be taken, such as, Detention, Suspension, and finally if their behaviour remained unchanged Expulsion from the school.
“And Brucey-bear.” Tony said, he didn’t want to up root the kids and drag them to Washington, and Peter needed to attend school so it was better that they stayed in New York. “You okay with that Hapster?” Tony called to Happy.
“That’s not how it goes,” Tony moaned, dropping his head into his hands, “Everyone loves Rogers, its always me they hate, and they always will.”
“He was,” Steve muttered, he ran a hand over his face tiredly, “He’s been playing vigilante, he went into the oscorp factory tonight and got caught.”
“Zach sweetheart, this is something that needs to be done.” Tony tried to explain. “Peter is grounded for a week, that’s why he’s going to be staying in his bedroom.”
Peter laying torn open from neck to groin, his intestines spilling out as he choked on his own blood begging Tony not to let him go, telling him he didn’t want to go, but breathing out his last breath before Tony could reach him.
“Are you going to sleep on me?” she asked, when she heard a snuffle beside her ear, Tony didn’t respond, instead he snuggled further into her and breathed out deeply, his body going limp and boneless. “Perfect.” Pepper sighed, she shook her head and carefully eased Tony off her shoulder and lay him down on the sofa, placing a throw pillow under his head so his neck wouldn’t get stiff, and grabbed a blanket from the back of the sofa to lay over him.
Letting the Doctor’s body slump to the floor, Tony scrambled off the bed and with no small amount of difficulty got down besides him and set about stripping him. He couldn’t very well leave the cell in his hospital gown, that would have alarms ringing right away, but he could sneak out in the Doctors clothes, the lab coat should be enough to conceal his bump, and he should get away with it if he kept his head down.
Tony landed with a thump and retracted the face plate. Rogers blanched as he saw Tony’s expression. Never had Tony Stark looked angrier. Were it possible he would have steam coming from his ears he looked so furious, his entire was shaking with rage and his eyes were so dark they looked nearly black.
“We are.” Steve said, grabbing some tissues and wiping his cheek, “Have you got everything ready to go?”
“Right away Sir.” Jarvis said, “However it appears that several feet of metal now lay between yourself and the suit, and I have detected a missile, several in fact.”
It seemed to take him an age to get across the floor to the door but he reached it eventually and tried the handle, it was locked of course, this was no hospital, they’d have no reason to lock him in a room.
“Just as long as they never come anywhere near my family again, I don’t care what happens to them.” Tony said, rocking Lily back and forth, he was so taken up with the baby he didn’t notice the hush that had fallen over the room right away and when he did he looked up with a frown, “What?”
“Smoothing the militaries ruffled feathers after I’ve brushed them up the wrong way.” Tony replied, the spoon was back in his mouth now and he was typing furiously with one hand while doing something inside the helmet with the tweezers, there was a bright flash and several sparks and the eyes of the armour glowed. “Hey Jay?” Tony asked, taking the spoon from his mouth, “Can you hear me buddy?”
Pepper issued a brief but concise statement that confirmed that Tony had been gravely injured during the Avengers raid on the Sokovian base, but that his condition was now serious but stable.
Steve didn’t care that Tony’s hair was greying, didn’t care if it went completely white or all fell out. He didn’t care if Tony’s skin turned bright green, if he sprouted a second head (expect for the double amount of talking) he was in love with Tony for Tony, not for his appearance. Okay so visual attraction did still play a part, but a few extra pounds, a few more lines and wrinkles, and some greys didn’t radically change anything.
With the departures looming closer, everyone was trying to make the most of the time they had with each other, especially when it came to Tony with his boys, which was what alerted Steve to there being something very wrong when Tony didn’t immediately light up when he saw them.
“I know.” Bruce said, “With any luck once we can match her signature to the sceptre we’ll be able to use it to track her whereabouts anywhere on the planet.”
“Oh hell no, I’m not getting up at the arse crack of dawn to pound the pavement. I had enough of ungodly wake up calls when Zach was a baby to last me a lifetime.”
“No.” Steve admitted, “I could never have imagined this. While it is ignorant to say it, I never really gave much if any thought to how people of colour were treated back then, nor to homosexuals, or the children whose parents beat them. I was not actively against homosexuality, but it was very hushed up, those who were gay did not advertise it, they didn’t dare, and while I suspected that he or she might have had more desire for the same sex I was not the sort of person who would report them to the police. Neither did I engage in any racial brutality, but I also didn’t seek out to put an end to it, not until Nazi Germany happened. Before then I was too focused on the fact I was living during the depression, I was more worried about where the next meal was coming from and if my Ma and I would be able to make next weeks rent.”
There he discovered illegal and frankly horrific human experimentation being conducted in a secret lab, before he could get out and alert the authorities and his parents, he was taken prisoner and was subjected to horrific acts by a Doctor Curien, who at present still remains at large.
“We don’t know that Hydra is involved, this could be pure Shield.” Natasha cut in, “The plan isn’t to harm.”
As well as blood loss, Peter had smoke inhalation and a gun shot wound to the thigh, his femur was broken but didn’t require surgery, it just needed setting and putting in a plaster. With his enhanced healing it would probably only take two or so weeks to heal instead of a minimum of twelve and more likely sixteen.
If the suit could sigh then that was the noise that Jarvis made upon hearing this and the face plate seemed to become distressed at the news.
Once more, as Natasha went to interrogate Loki, and Thor spoke the Coulson, Steve was left feeling like a spare part, which was how he came to wander into the labs in time to see Stark jabbing Banner in the side with something that made the other scientist yelp.
His speed was much greater now, not super speed, but he could outrun a baseline human at ease and quickly gaining on MJ, in fact he managed to get close enough to hear her curse as she ran trying to keep away from him.
“You could have saved us.” Bruce said, he was no longer Hulk, just Bruce, but with a wound that matched Hulk, a gaping seven inch wide wound in his chest that Tony could literally see through.
Peter and Zach showed Tony around the re-modelled penthouse, taking him into their bedrooms where they had both cleared easy pathways to their beds that Tony could take while in the chair, the same had been sorted for the master bedroom and a new lower sink had been put in that Tony could use sitting down, the toilet had hand rails so he could easily move from the chair onto the toilet and back, the shower unit had been taken out and a simple non slip wet room style tiling had been put down with a drain so that Tony didn’t have to try and deal with the lip of the shower stall.
“You are correct about that, Mr Stark.” It said, addressing Tony whom it seemed to observe, the ancient cameras moving to look him over, “Anthony Edward Stark born 1974, Steven Grant Rogers. Born 1918.”
“No!” Tony said immediately, startling himself, Jarvis, and the Nurse as she pulled down the bed sheets. “I’m fine.” He added in a softer tone, “Its nothing, I’m sorry.”
“I needed you awake.” Steve said, “And it was the best way to wake you up, fun for me and alerting for you.” He flopped down on the bed besides Tony and propped himself up on one elbow. “I’ve got something for you.” He said handing Tony a small box.
“Do you think you could make a suit in spandex in time for Lydia’s party?” Ned mused, “That’d be epic, and do you think your Mamma will let you borrow one of his cars, imagine the three of us rolling up in a Ferrari!”
“It won’t really work if you come in with me.” Peter said to Zach to gazed up at him, all tearful dark eyes and wobbling bottom lip. “I did something wrong and I hurt Mamma, so I am learning my lesson with a week in my room.”
“Cool, get the bastard sweating.” Tony said and looked thoughtful, “Maybe I should open my own school. A school for the super smart scientific and engineering geniuses of tomorrow,” His eyes widened, “We could use one of the floors in the Tower, we could offer schooling for our employees children.”
“He’s had a couple of nightmares and wet the bed twice.” Tony said running a hand through his hair, “He can barely stand to be away from me for more than an hour, he’s terrified something is going to happen to me, that someone will take me away from him; he’s even asked Cap to train him so he’ll be able to fight any “Bad guys” who try to hurt me.”
“This is like a high school wet dream come true, or was it a pot induced hallucination in which I was butt naked and in the showers with Steve Rogers?”
“What about Zach?” Steve asked, they had spoken on the phone during the flight back from Miami, but not in detail.
Tony hadn’t wanted to talk about it, had wanted to pretend that the whole thing hadn’t happened, and Steve hadn’t pushed. Had let Tony have his privacy, hadn’t said a word when Tony had been crying into his pillow that night, simply wrapped himself about the smaller man and held him close, letting him cry himself out while providing comfort.
“But what if it does?” Peter asked, “What if social services get involved?” He was old enough to know the risk of Social Services becoming involved, he’d already dealt with them when Tony first adopted him, he knew that if they wanted it they could remove him and Zach and drag Tony through the courts to prevent him from regaining custody. At their ages he and Zach were unlikely to be kept together, most likely they would be split up and sent to different foster homes in different states, possibly even state run homes. Tony might never get him and Zach home, him especially since they were not blood related.
He grabbed the Doctor’s throat in his left hand squeezing his wind pipe and pressed the long needle from his canula against the delicate skin of the mans throat.
“But shouldn’t I feel something, some pain for her not being here, not getting to see her Grandsons?” Tony asked, “But the truth is I hardly care. I’m more thankful that Howard is not here to hurt them than that she never got to see them.”
“Of course.” Steve ground out finding it difficult to feel pity for the woman who had allowed Howard to neglect and abuse her own child. Were he feeling kinder, then he could have reasoned that her spirit had been broken by Howard, by the loss of the Pups and babies before Tony’s birth, that by the time her only living Pup had come into the world she had become too desolate in her heart to find the strength in herself to fight for her Son. But right now Tony was his only concern, not a woman he had never met and would never meet.
Tony bit his bottom lip, he didn’t want to relive his nightmares by telling Steve, didn’t want to give voice to the horror’s he’d seen almost every night since Sokovia, he wanted to bury those memories in the back of his mind and never think of them again. But he knew from past experience that burying thoughts didn’t work, they would come back to haunt him sooner or later.
Thankfully the arc reactors were missing several vital components so whomever had taken them would not succeed in backwards engineering them. The sceptre however was of more concern.
“It would be better if you just spoke to Captain Rogers, Sir.” Jarvis stressed for the umpteenth time, “He will not judge you, he will support you.”
“Boss, Deadpool and Dopinder have departed. Dopinder in the lift, and Deadpool down the side of the building!” Friday reported, Tony rolled his eyes, only half hoping that Wade would splatter himself on the pavement, not that it’d kill him, or injure him for very long, but at least it would hurt. Although, he could land on someone and kill them…
“Wait a minute…” Steve begged trying to take hold of Tony and make him see reason, but the genius wasn’t listening and piece by piece the suit began to appear, “At least wait for back up….” Steve trailed off as Tony fired the repulsors and sped off out of the Tower and up into the sky.
Steve frowned. The law was not something he knew that well, not beyond layman’s understanding. Really they needed professional legal guidance.
“It certainly has.” Steve said shaking the hosts hand as the camera finished and the connection was cut.
“Aye!” Thor declared and swooped down to smash Mjolnir into the nearest cannon shattering the metal with a single blow and then crushing the bunker as the soldiers scrambled to get away from him.
“I do a similar thirty minute run myself.” He said, letting Sam take the bait before adding, “Usually a good twelve to thirteen miles every morning.”
“We need to find the spear.” Tony said, his fingers tapping a nervous rhythm, “We don’t know what its truly capable of. Reindeer games could control minds with it, shoot energy beams from it, whose to know what else it can do, or what it might do to people stupid enough to play around with it.”
His spleen had been removed, an organ he could live without, he’d just have to take asprin everyday and make sure he got his flu shot every year. His gallbladder and stomach had been damaged but repaired, he was going to have to modify his diet for the next six months though to help his gallbladder recover, drastically cut back on fats and even after the six months it would be best if he went for lower fat options at least ninety percent of the time.
Steve winced and clutched the phone tighter, “Tony, it’s Zach….he….he’s been abducted. A woman came to the tower shortly after the mandarin attacked you. She said she knew you, had information about her boss, linking him to the Mandarin. God, I was so stupid, I let her up to the penthouse and she shot me Peter with tranqs, she must have snatched Zach then, Bruce was hulked out in the secure room, there was no one to stop her. Shit!” Steve ran a hand through his hair, “Tony I am so sorry, the police have called an Amber Alert, the team are on their way back to New York, I didn’t mean to let you down, I didn’t…” Steve’s voice cracked and he broke off, biting his lip so hard it tore and bled down his chin.
Bruce wore a pair of grey and black Hawaiian trunks and a t-shirt, he also had a thick book to read and had the presence of mind to put together several beach towels.
“Like I’d leave you to get thrown to the wolves alone.” Pepper scoffed, “If I’m there the host will behave himself and not try to make you uncomfortable or trip you up.”
“M'okay.” Tony murmured, freezing up, he hadn’t had an Alpha holding him like this in… well…ever and he wasn’t really sure how to react to it.
If people would just leave them alone, people like Stern who were stoking the fires of the anti-mutant crowd, then things would start to die down, Tony and his lawyers could reason with the schools, and they could start to get back to normal.
“I didn’t mind you know.” Steve said making Tony frown, “You sleeping on me, it was nice, it made me feel….protective I guess.” He was blushing again and there might have been a faint flush on Tony’s cheeks too. Before he lost his nerve, Steve added, “When this is all over, I’d like to take you out on a date, a proper date, dinner, and a movie.” He felt like scuffing his boots on the floor like a little boy and he remembered something at the last minute, “Should I ask the Colonel for his permission?”
“Exo-program.” Tony said, “He flew the falcon wings, I’ve got Jarvis searching for whatever silo they’ve been dumped in, once he finds them we can go and liberate them from mothballs and we’ll have some air born back up.”
“Mamma, Mamma I was so scared, I tried to get away, I fighted them and struggled but they catched me and they did something to me.” Zach babbled wrapping his arms about Tony’s neck and holding him tight.
Considering Howard’s jealousy and his arrogance, it was not hard to imagine him not liking being outshone by his Son, especially by an Omega, whom in Howard’s youth would have been seen the same as a Beta Woman, good for caring for a house and having Pups.
“This is insane.” Clint said, getting up from the couch and going to the drinks bar, he ran his fingers over the bottles until he found a tequila and then got a shot glass and some salt from the counter, he poured himself a measure and sprinkle the salt on his hand, licking it off he took the shot and grimaced, “Needs lime.”
Steve wasn’t completely without ways of helping Tony though, the physio showed him how to massage Tony’s legs when they spasmed, he was also shown by nurse how to cut Tony’s toe nails safely and how to make sure that his feet were completely dry before he put on socks and shoes.
Steve couldn’t say he disagreed with Tony’s opinion. He had attended a few dinners like that back in his stage days when his employers had been trying to impress the local mayor or governor, they’d take then out to the fanciest most upscale restaurant in town. Steve would feel so uncomfortable in those places, his shoulders seeming too big and wide for the suits he was forced into and his lack of social graces painfully obvious.
“Oh God.” Tony ducked his head towards his chest and sobbed as one by one, the dead Avengers approached him, Clint staggering over, his armless body swaying from side to side as his corpse struggled to find balance, his eye sockets gaping and leaking blood down his ashen face.
He didn’t say anymore, he didn’t have to, they both knew what he was saying without needing the actual words spoken, they may already be too late.
That elation was short lived when he saw the bandages on Tony’s head and the fatigue and worry in his eyes which matched Steve’s expression. “Sorry.” He mumbled knowing he was the reason they were so upset and tired.
“Right,” Tony said, “Where the hell am I, how long have I been here, what is going on, and who is running this little show?”
“Sadly yes, Sir.” Jarvis replied, “I also have a video recording of your confrontation with Loki, would you like me to show that to Miss Potts and Captain Rogers too?”
“Thank God.” Steve breathed, while he didn’t like the thought of Peggy being in a home, he could understand why her family had put her in one, for her safety as well as for her health.
“I should kick your ass for worrying me like that!” Tony sniped at him making Steve chuckle, “Fuck, babe, don’t do that to me, okay? I’ve got a heart condition, I can’t survive that shit.”
“We could do with taking reading while you are suffering a nightmare.” Jarvis said to Tony, not unkindly, just matter of fact.
“Yes.” Tony agreed, “But it will be targeted only enemy ships, hopefully that will never land on earth, but if they do, then… well the best I can offer is to keep the damage to a minimum, to try and draw the ships away from civilian populations before the weapons are fired. But, make no mistake, such an event would mean that we were at war and a sad fact of war is that people die. Civilians as well as soldiers, we can try to keep the deaths to a minimum, but some lives may well be lost.”
Thor sighed and nodded, “Tis true, but your mother is a warrior, and injuries often occur in battle, my father lost his left eye in battle and he is a God. The king of Asgard, and has ruled despite his loss for many centuries.”
There were also less than subtly questions regarding Rhodey’s return to duty, he may be on compassionate leave but said leave was not indefinite.
With how clean and easy life seemed to be in the twenty-first century Steve almost came to believe that people didn’t get ill anymore and he was only reminded of the fact that they were still human and that illness still existed when Zach came down with Chicken Pox.
“Steven Rogers!” Tony mock gasped, “You are supposed to be above such lewd and depraved things, what would America say if they knew their golden boy was such a pervert?”
“Oscorp, you mean you getting sick?” MJ looked to Tony and Steve and then back at Peter, “Oh God, do you have cancer or hepatitis or something?” She asked, “Or rabies, did the spider give you rabies?”
“Uh, TMI Birdbrain.” Tony protested, he tugged on his cuffs, “Are we doing something here or were you dumbasses just looking for some strange house ornaments?” His humour dried up when Maya Hanson came down into the dungeon.
Steve closed his eyes and let out a deep sigh, he felt for Tony, for all he’d gone through trying to make his body ready for a pregnancy only for it to come to nothing.
“Well the water here is very deep so you must stay with myself, your Daddy, Uncle Sam, Uncle Clint, and Aunt Natasha at all times.” Thor said seriously, “As must you, Peter.”
“It’s my Ten-Thousand Calorie challenge video.” Clint explained about a mouthful of pancake. “These things are Youtube gold.” Natasha said something cutting in Russian that had Tony snickering and Clint place a hand on his heart, a wounded expression on his face.
“We have a date with the Black Widow.” Steve corrected, “And hopefully we can start to solve this nightmare.”
Tony shrugged, “I’m an easy target, and I’ve heard worse.” That didn’t make Steve feel any better, he hated the hate that was directed towards Tony, that some people felt that he should be vilified for being rich, as if being born into money was a crime. He could understand the jealousy, he’d been jealous of the rich when he’d been starving in the depression, but never to the point where he’d actively slandered them or attacked them.
Clint meanwhile was firing explosive arrows that were taking out vehicles as well as soldiers, “I think we lost the element of surprise.”
Okay he might have been a little crazy in taking the racing car for a spin in Monaco, but honestly, who could blame him? He did have blood poisoning and he thought watching his Mamma race would be something Zach would enjoy when he was older.
The baby moved and Tony grinned as he felt a tiny foot pushing against his hand, “Doesn’t matter, I’ll know what to call you when I see you. Until then, how does Poppet sound?” He felt a kick and decided to take it as agreement.
It wasn’t fair. Both had lost so much already and now they were being forced to run again. Natasha had never known any home but Shield and the Avengers, and Wanda had lost her family because of Stark only to lose her home again because of him.
“I could design a program to search through Shields database, encrypting the files that have to be protected while uploading the information about those linked to Hydra to the Internet.” Tony mused, “Once I’ve got it ready I can put it onto a USB stick,” He glanced back at Natasha, “You’ll have to directly upload it Shield’s database you won’t be able to do it remotely.”
Refusing to just lie there and take it this time around, Tony bucked up into Steve, meeting each thrust and arching his spine as much as he could, so much so that Steve eventually lifted him and held him up, with Tony sitting in his lap, riding him hard and fast.
“But Ross hates super soldiers and mutants.” Tony said, “He always has, and Stern despises superhero/vigilantes.”
“Obviously. But you can get out of the country, liquidate your assets and put the money in a caymans account so it cannot be frozen.” Ross explained, “I would urge you to do this. You cannot fight the charges and win, but you can make a strategic retreat and regroup, so that the next time you and I go up against these freaks, we win.”
“Margaret Patterson, Lucas Fiore, Philip Lee, and Jane Curtis, have all taken leave for medical reasons. Two to begin cancer treatment, one for IVF treatment, and the fourth to care for her mother who is to undergo surgery.” Jarvis replied, “Michael Flint is taking compassionate leave as his Father has recently died of a stroke. Angela Hamilton is going to assist her sister who has just given birth for the second time but has been abandoned by her husband, and finally Layla Antione is on Jury Service.”
The childish and little shit part of Tony couldn’t resist having Friday snap a couple of photos of their expressions to post on social media as soon as the press conference had gone ahead.
“For what its worth, I’m not Hydra either.” Natasha said, “And I think we can vouch for Fury.” She glanced at Clint who nodded, “Phil too. Maria Hill however…”
Steve did so, watching the blood running through the tubes and down into Tony’s veins, he wanted to think it was making a difference, was helping to save Tony’s life, but he could see the growing red stains beneath Thor’s hand, the packs becoming soaked in blood and needing replacing no matter how much pressure was applied.
“We’ll talk about that at some other time.” Tony said wondering if his face was actually on fire, and if Zach would ever grow out of saying things like this in public.
Okay, so maybe he could have been a little more friendly to Captain America, but Tony still had issues where Rogers was concerned, being compared to him by Howard and found wanting still stung. He also hadn’t been in close proximity to such a dominant Alpha in a long time. Not since Stane had died. Being around those pheromones unnerved him and put him on edge, making him more cutting in his remarks that he needed to be.
Steve startled and turned to see Peter’s grinning face, the pre-teen had gone and got himself some fresh cookies and he held out the bag to Steve to take one.
A scaly monster that looked like it had been cross bred with a Komodo dragon and an alligator snapped vicious jaws at him and watching him with evil eyes.
“Its over now.” He said, looking to Lily who’d cried herself into an exhausted sleep, “Let’s get these assholes locked up and head for home.”
“The last time I checked, concealing a crime, is in fact a crime. Not counting possible charges of Aiding and Abetting, Accessory after the fact. Attempting to pervert the course of justice.”
It was nothing overly fancy, but it showed Peter how much he’d been missed and how happy everyone was that he was home and recovering.
As his jeep sped through the streets of Novi Grad Strucker looked back to see Iron Man drones setting down to protect the civilians from the Hydra soldiers and get them medical attention if needed.
Just when you think life can’t possibly get any weirder…. Steve found himself standing in a place that made the Shield Helicarrier seem outdated.
“It doesn’t matter anyway.” Sam said, “What happened to them is sad, its horrible even, but they aren’t the only kids who have lost their parents during a war. Civilians are always caught in the cross fire, thousands if not millions of children have lost their parents in similar circumstances, especially during the blitz.” He looked to Steve as he said this, the Captain nodding his head in agreement. “And those children have not grown up to join Hydra or other terrorist organisations.”
Zach’s involvement in the killing of Killian they all agreed to keep out of the official story, if the word got out that Zach had helped to kill a man then it would bring him all the worst kinds of attention.
“The fuck I am!” Tony replied, “We’ll let him get to his safe house then have Nat and Clint “Interview” him, after that he’s on his own.”
Steve kept the details of his and Tony’s relationship private, only saying how they were very happy, were taking things slowly, and would not be rushing into anything. He did however elaborate on how much he loved being a part of the Stark family, how much adored Zach and Peter and spending time with them.
“Yeah, but imagine a little mini Captain America running around.” Tony said, grinning as he pictured a tiny version of Steve, all golden hair flopping every which way, bright rosy cheeks, sparkling blue eyes and a winning smile.
Tony didn’t have time to celebrate though, as Rogers shield hit him in the head, sending him spiralling to the ground. He landed badly, his right arm crumpled beneath him and he let out a hoarse cry as her felt bones break. He didn’t have a chance to do more than turn himself over as Rogers was on him, pinning him down and beating at the helmet with the shield.
“Dumm-E stop tha…” Tony didn’t finished the sentence as Dumm-E obedient bot that he was not, turned as soon as Tony said his name, but did not stop fired the extinguisher and Tony, like Zach was soon covered in foam. “Wonderful.” Tony grumbled,
“Well, if you agree not to run off again and not to cause anymore trouble then perhaps we can let this pass just this once.” Steve said, he knew he shouldn’t let Zach get away with misbehaving but the little boy had been deeply stressed and was going to be separated from his Mother for weeks.
“I get surrounded by people like that, who are so busy agreeing with me to win my favour for something that they don’t hear a word I am saying. Barton isn’t like that. He listens and gives his genuine opinion. Maybe not what I always want to hear, but what I need to hear. I respect that, and as much as he drives me up the wall, I actually like the bird brained idiot!”
“This isn’t your fault either.” Steve said cutting Tony off before he could speak, “I know you hate this, being dependant, anyone would. I know its humiliating to not be able to do basic things for yourself, and I know its hurting your pride, but you need to know that no one, especially not me, thinks any less of you.”
Steve had had enough, pushing Tony aside he punched the screen before them cracking it and for a moment Zola disappeared only to reappear again, “As I was saying, your failure to save James Buchanan Barnes provided Hydra with a super soldier of their own, one whom we could shape and hone for our purpose, and ironically, the method that preserved yourself was also used to preserve him. Just think of it Captain, your best friend, now in league with your greatest enemies.”
“Right.” Tony agreed, “Maybe just talk a walk in the snow for a few minutes every day, let yourself get used to it, then slowly start to do more.”
Steve determinedly convinced himself that he could get through a snowball fight with the team and kids and that he would have a good time doing it. Painting a smile on his face the next day as they headed out to Central Park.
