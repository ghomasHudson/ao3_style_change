into that luxuriating calm where nothing matters but this moment, this beautiful here and now. With a long exhale, he settles upon his knees, heels digging into the meat of his ass, heavy yet weightless as the rolling tide with Cas as his guiding moon, his gravitational pull.
The rain doesn’t let up as they pull down the long gravel driveway to the house and park, and when he turns the car off they both sit there quietly, neither quite ready to make a break for it yet.
How can Cas sound so fucking composed, his voice coming out even and methodical like he's reading aloud from a lore manual or spell book? Dean's practically writhing on the sheets, nipples perky and tender, cool air settling upon his warm saliva in a contrast that sends shivers down his spine. Trapped between satin, lace, and the coarse hair of his treasure trail, his cock pulses desperately with each jolt of friction as he shifts his pelvis forward and back. And there Cas is with his gravelly voice comin' out like whiskey and velvet, smooth and steady even as it burns going down. He's a bastard, and the snarky, rebellious part of Dean itches to let him know it.
“Shit, Cas, we could be roommates!” Dean says boisterously, but quickly adds, “Or kick me out, whatever, I can move back into Bobby’s. Don’t matter.”
“Honey, ya weren’t wrong to.” When he looks up, she’s smirking, a twinkle in her warm, wrinkled eyes. Her voice is just as assuring, but there’s a hint of mirth there that perks his ears up and makes him wary.
Dean peeks around the edge of the door, and of course, his cover is blown right away because Cas is hard as fuck to sneak up on. Like the dude has some kinda sixth sense about Dean in particular and can sense his presence from a mile away even without his grace. It’s creepy, but a little comforting too.
He pads to the room across the hall and finds it empty. Dean must have let Claire out when he got up. He smiles, pleased at how thoughtful the man is, despite what her proximity does to him (though it seems to have abated now that Dean’s taken to a regular medicinal regimen). After picking through his suitcase, he slips into the bathroom and turns on the shower. Steps in without waiting for it to warm, half-heartedly hoping the shock of cold will kill his arousal.
Dean tucks the blankets in around him, makes him safe. Presses a cool, wet cloth to his forehead, and says, hardly above a whisper, “You’re okay, Cas. I’m... I’m proud of you, man.”
His body tenses, face pulling into a scowl. When he glances to the side, Bobby’s already gone. And when did he turn the music off?
His eyes trace the sharp jut of Dean’s jaw, sweep across freckle-dusted cheekbones, linger on the thin gap between his plump, parted lips. He watches as Dean’s contented expression flickers with a quiet groan, brow furrowing against some annoyance permeating his dream. Instantly, and without thought, the hand closest to Dean bridges the scant few inches between them and cards through his hair. After all the comfort Dean has brought him, it’s the least he can do to return it.
“Gabe!” He covered the phone with the hand not holding it and glanced at Dean. The other man stood at the sink not three feet away, scrubbing the lasagna pan with a concentrated frown that made the corners of Castiel's lips twitch. He told him he’d be back and stepped out onto the deck, the sound of his brother’s crowing vibrating through the receiver. “He’s not my ‘fuckboy’,” he hissed.
and out pops a short, scrawny man wearing a leather vest, no shirt underneath, and ripped jeans. The man runs his fingers through his hair, drawing Castiel’s attention to his long, light brown mullet. An honest to God
“Perfect,” Castiel croons. “Now get the lubricant, spread it on your fingers. Don't take off the panties, and do not touch your cock. I want to take my time with you, as I would were I there now. Do you understand?”
His brain short-circuits, going completely blank with the overwhelming thrum of desire flooding his veins because
Cas chuckles darkly, but he can hear him speeding up the pace of his own hand. “Not yet. Want to see you like this.” He keens with desperation only to be met with, “
where?” Castiel shakes his head and leans his hip against the desk. “And what exactly am I supposed to do with this information?”
Lust... lust Castiel can deal with. He understands it. These other feelings Dean brings up, however, are perilous in their novelty. He’s treading water here, barely keeping his head above the surface, exhaustion seeping into his limbs and lungs. Then the memories of Dean looking at him with those sparkling eyes and roguish grin arise, and clutching white-knuckled fingers in the pillow beside his cheek is all he can do to stay tethered, focused, present.
Bobby’s gruff, “Morning, Princess” greets him from across the table while Ellen frowns disapprovingly by the stove where she’s frying eggs. He knows the reason behind her expression but isn’t about to prod that issue with a twenty-foot pole before he’s even had his first sip of the day. Hopefully, she’ll be kind enough to give him a five-minute head start.
“If you wanted to move out so bad, why didn't you say so before? You could stay with me and Jess! We have an extra room—”
Dean watches the water wash away the evidence of his morning escapade before turning it off, musing,
Pushing off the floor with a grunt, Dean begins pacing the room, his expression suddenly pensive. There’s a fire in his eyes Castiel hasn’t seen before, yet it reminds him of the passionate way he’d spoken about his job earlier.
They’re outside at Singer’s Salvage now, standing between the rows of hollowed-out metal and plastic vehicle husks. Dean leans against a stack, watching Sam pace a few feet away. Arms spread, shooting him one of his signature bitchfaces. Brow scrunched, eyes squinted, lips pursed. A look skirting the line between worried and annoyed, one that tells him Sam ain’t buying whatever he’s selling.
It’s a struggle, returning to his point. “I did well in school. After, not so much.” He shrugs. “Academia provides a very different lifestyle to one’s average ‘nine to five’. Michael said I got lazy, complacent.”
“You, ah—” He clears his throat, barely managing to tear his eyes away from his waiting prize. Not really a way to ask this that isn’t blunt, so might as well just spit it out. “You clean?”
“Dad left us money, bro! I mean, I was a little surprised, not gonna lie. Thought for sure Mikey would have gotten him to cut us out of the will by now, with him laid up and… you know. But that’s not all. We got a property, with a ton of acreage. You and me.”
But words have never been his fuckin’ forte and all he can think to say is, “Fuck me,” all breathy and humiliatingly desperate. He’d be ashamed if not for the instant flash in Cas’ eyes that tells him maybe he said exactly the right damn thing.
Also, what the actual fuck? Cas is gonna think he offered up his bed just so he could what, molest him in his sleep? Son of a bitch, Dean’s so screwed! (Again, not in the fun way.)
He nods wordlessly and pours coffee into the giant bi-pride-colored Star Trek mug his best friend Charlie got him for Christmas last year, then shuffles into the bathroom to rifle through the medicine cabinet for a bottle of ibuprofen. After popping two tablets and chugging a healthy dose of the refreshing black nectar, he turns to shut the door and finds Ellen leaning, arms crossed, against the frame.
And Gabriel, well... he's an ass too, in a completely different way, but he’s always been there for me. Sometimes I think Michael resents us because Gabe and I have always been more alike, more close. We were the rebels, the ones who ‘fell from grace’, so to speak.”
“Indeed.” Cas nods eagerly. “Dean told me all about your full ride to Stanford. Said you recently passed the bar and have gotten engaged, as well. He is very proud of you.”
at home somewhere. To have a family. To not wake and perform the rote functions of daily life, idle and hollow as they are, alone, spending each workday ravenous for the rare weekends he gets to visit with his small circle of friends. Returning to his empty apartment night after night with only Claire to keep him company.
Might as well rub one out. It’s been a while, and frankly, avoiding doing so won’t alleviate the awkward tension between him and Dean any. If anything, it’s probably made it that much worse. Only one night in and already struggling; how he’s to survive the next ten days is beyond him.
It has been less than twenty-four hours since his father’s funeral, and he now finds himself in the back of a cab traveling through the seemingly endless countryside, past fields of corn and wheat, forests full of elm, spruce, and pine. Just clear blue sky and fresh air for miles and miles around. It's so serene, he begins to think that perhaps a vacation will be good for him, after all.
“Pot, dude,” Dean responds. Ah. Castiel indulged his fair share in college, so at least this is one thing he’s not completely inept with discussing. Though it does seem a little rude for them to do so at his home without asking, he doesn’t really mind since Jody has no plan to break up the party.
Dean rolls his eyes. It’s like taking a child to the store; not even ten minutes in and nearly everything Cas has grabbed, Dean’s given an adamant
Castiel desperately longs to claw it away, to witness that vulnerability again, to know every part of Dean, place each one on a shelf where he can examine them at will, touch them and cherish them, treat them as the delicate and beautiful artifacts they are. But that feeling is dangerous, one Castiel is not willing to indulge, or perhaps unable to. He tamps it down, locks it in a box, buries it.
He pictures the valley between Castiel’s tanned pecs, the way that droplet of water traced its path last night. He feels it beneath his curious fingers through a thin layer of fabric. The hot, lean muscle just below, and the thin trail of hair leading down, down...
—caffeine floating through the air and squinting against the agony of light piercing his lids, he stumbles into the kitchen.
He pulled Dean out of Hell, gave up everything for him. Died for him, more than once. Stood by him for over a decade. Cas has seen the deepest, darkest parts of him—shit, he’s seen Dean’s
“Aw, what crawled up your ass? Or is the problem that nothing's been up there for too long?" Gabriel snorts at his own joke. Castiel doesn't bother confirming or denying just how accurate that assumption is, he won't give his brother the satisfaction. "Come on, Cassie-poo, is that any way to greet your favorite brother? Where’s the love! ‘How are you, Gabe? I miss you! When are you coming to town?’”
Some of the tension bleeds away as Castiel leans back, musing. It does sound reasonable, and Dean has far more experience with this sort of thing than he does. He can’t help the bubble of excitement stirring in his gut at the prospect. Not only having someone’s aid with the house but being close to Dean, spending time with him, watching him work; it’s appealing, to say the least.
If he gets up now, Dean will ask him what’s wrong, and he isn’t ready to answer that. So he waits, participating in the conversation just enough to appear normal until Dean leaves to visit the restroom. The moment he’s out of view, Castiel rises and excuses himself.
Cas sucks in a pointed breath as Dean mouths a path toward his goal. Bringing a hand up to cup and roll Cas’ balls, he presses a sweet kiss to the base of his cock. But it’s not enough to touch, he wants to taste,
Dean pauses, glancing up through his lashes, fork halfway to his mouth. He lowers it slowly with a sigh, cheeks flushing. “Look, um… about this morning—”
for looking over this chapter for me. For their endless support and validation, I am eternally grateful.
“Tell me the truth, Dean,” Cas murmurs lowly, voice like fucking velvet and sandpaper all at once, smooth and deep and rough in that familiar, tortuous way that shoots down his spine and all the way to his groin. “
“On my Sundays off I go to the library to study,” Cas replies, neatly organizing everything on the single-serve shelf.
It’s a Thursday like any other when Dean’s GE 7-4612A alarm sounds, tuned to his favorite station. This particular mid-September morning he wakes to Paul Rodgers crooning the sweet yet melancholic “Ready for Love” and groans, flailing one arm out from beneath the covers with eyes slitted against the meager pink-tinted light of dawn filtering through his curtains to slap clumsily at the off button.
It truly is beautiful here, and so unlike the city. Refreshing in a way no place he’s ever lived before has been. Beneath the clear summer sky, the trees and grass are lush and bright, swishing gently with the pleasant breeze. Most of the land immediately surrounding the house is flat, a few trees interspersed between it, the road, and the forest line at the far edge of the property. It’s stunning, near inconceivable to think that all this land, all this beauty, could be his. Well…
“Why don’t you just ask for his number?” Charlie says way too damn cheerfully one freezing but sunny January morning. Her fugly banana yellow ‘76 Gremlin is at the shop, so he’d picked her up on his way to work to retrieve it. Two birds and all that jazz.
“Sounds great,” Dean says with a grin that moves fluidly from anxious to excited. “I’ll uh, I’ll be right back.”
Back against the headboard, he props up one knee, lets his legs fall slightly akimbo, and reaches his free hand down to tease at the lace edge. Hair wrecked from disrobing so messily, his eyelids hang low and heavy with lust, the gentle lamplight throwing his features into sharp relief. Somehow he knows this is the one, and before he can overthink it, he hits send.
That earns him a playful punch to the shoulder, and it seems to lighten Sam’s mood. They wind their way through the jungle of steel and iron, the organization of which to anyone but Bobby himself would appear haphazard and chaotic, back up to the house.
“...Like music,” Cas says, reflecting Dean’s own thoughts. He glances right. Cas sits opposite him on the bucket seat, and it feels as though Cas has… been there from the start. Or maybe it’s where he’s meant to be. It feels right, anyway. Comfortable.
He grins excitedly and crosses his arms behind his head, watching Cas move down the bed to sit back on his haunches. His fingertips slide between Dean’s pants and skin before slowly shimmying them down. Dean lifts his hips to let Cas pull them over his ass and when his hard cock bobs free, flushed red and weeping, Cas licks his lips, eyes glued to it where it lies upon Dean’s slightly soft but flat stomach.
By his final tally, they have functional electricity, internet, working plumbing, shelter (obviously) and little else. But Dean’s had worse, and if he’s honest the excitement of the project keeps his spirits up. Long as they don’t encounter anything major like foundation issues, a bad roof, asbestos or black mold, it should only take a couple months to get the house in peak condition again.
Sam, standing in front of Cas, snorts and glances at Dean. He pats Cas on the back encouragingly and walks up the steps, tugging Jack away from Dean’s side.
. Awkward and not particularly sociable, preferring quiet mornings in the park, afternoon lunches with friends, or evenings curled up with Claire and an intriguing book to noisy, bustling clubs or extravagant parties. More likely to discuss miscellaneous historical anecdotes or the latest novel he read than celebrity gossip, recent popular movies, or whatever happens to be “trending” on social media. Good-looking, he’s been told, and moderately successful in that he has—well,
Besides, one night stands are uncomfortable enough back in Boston where he can easily disappear among the crowds and never see that person again. In a small town like Eden, the chances of running into the man again are far too high. So while disappointed he did not act on the impulse, he's also a little relieved to avoid the consequences of taking such a risk.
Castiel sighs, a soft, content sound. It feels unusual but welcome. He flicks the bathroom light off, wandering back into the bedroom. Smiling at the back of Dean’s still-sleeping form, he pads to the dresser on silent feet, grabs a pair of his briefs, and slips into the closet. He drops the towel from around his waist and stretches, happy to enjoy the cool air from the A/C they’d finally installed on his naked flesh. Scanning through the hangers, he selects a black Metallica t-shirt that isn’t his and slips it, and the briefs, on.
Rubbing a towel through his mess of hair, he scoffs, because what good has decorum ever done him? Led him to a job he barely tolerates and a lonely, mediocre life? Maybe Gabe’s right (yet again, damn him), and this is his chance to do things differently. Do what he meant to when he first left, when he still had dreams of better things. Before he caved to pressure, duty, and slid right back under his father’s thumb.
He staggers to his desk, grips the edge and slogs his way around it to plop into the chair. It groans under his weight, that one constantly imbalanced wheel dipping it unevenly to one side and rolling it further back. He reaches up, pads of his fingers trailing across one cheek to feel the hot tears that spill unbidden, streaming down into the shadow of stubble along his clenched jaw. His fists dig into the black slacks around his knees, knuckles bleaching to the point of pain, a low growl threatening to erupt from deep within his chest.
“I have work, though. I can’t drop everything to go to South Dakota.” Castiel pinches the bridge of his nose and screws his eyes shut, the telltale ache of a migraine beginning to throb behind them. “What am I even supposed to do there?”
“Dean, you—you’re so—” but the rest of his words are lost to a guttural moan when Dean swallows him down again, relaxing his throat and taking him in until his nose is nearly nestled in the coarse, dark hair at the base.
“Thank you.” Castiel lifts Claire off his lap and sets her in the seat beside him. She meows, annoyed by the disturbance, but quickly resettles and falls back to sleep. “I'll return shortly.”
Bolting upright, he crawls on hands and knees to the edge of the bed, mouth watering at the sight of the most magnificent cock he’s ever seen. About as long as his, though possibly thicker, flushed purple beneath tanned skin and surrounded by neatly trimmed curls. The head glistens with Cas’ arousal, and it’s all Dean can do to keep himself from whining like a bitch in heat just to get his lips around it
Dean takes a swig of his beer and nods, gazing beyond Castiel’s shoulder as he absorbs this new detail. “Makes sense.”
“Told you, I feel fine.” Dean snorts, but even that pains him, and he wonders if Cas might be right, because he’s totally blowing hot air. He’s felt like shit since the morning after fixing that damn pipe. (Apparently wading through water containing who knows how much filthy bacteria in increasingly cooler temperatures for several hours isn’t great for one’s health.)
Just like that, Castiel sees the facade slipping back into place. He wants to rip both of their masks away, tear the walls down that they’ve each spent their entire damn lives building around themselves. Give in to the urges which have plagued him so long, to the way Dean makes him feel inside, show this man just how astounding he is, how loving, beautiful, kind, and brilliant. Make him understand just how much he deserves happiness, peace.
A flush burns across his cheeks. “Oh. Um… It was nothing, man, don’t worry about it.” He chuckles, running fingers through his wet hair, but even to his own ears, it sounds artificial.
Aaron nods, adding, “I mean, yeah, there’s still a lot who hold on to outdated notions. Mostly the older folks. But it’s not as bad as you think. Plus, Jody wouldn’t put up with any bullshit.”
Dean smiles wistfully, wondering what it’d be like in their place. To hold a child of his own, bounce them in his lap and listen to their gurgling fits of giggles. When he tries to picture his partner, it’s no real surprise that a shock of dark hair and blue eyes are the first things to come to mind. His vision becomes fuzzy at the edges and he rubs his eyes with his free hand, fingers sliding together to pinch the bridge of his nose.
An embarrassing gurgle from the region above his belt prompts him forward. Resigned, he pushes the door open. Then a little bell above it signals his entry and
, he notes), but Castiel is distracted from it by the gap of smooth, pale skin revealed between belt and shirt as Dean kneels to inspect the A/C. He quickly averts his gaze before his thoughts can wander further.
So yeah, close as they are, deep and unconditional as their love runs, there’s always gonna be things Dean holds back. Shit he buries. He’s spent his entire life protecting that kid and if that means taking his pain and guilt to the grave to keep from hurting him, so be it.
In his youth, he thought it was due to his strangeness that no one took a keen interest in him. But after a while, he began to believe perhaps it was he who was incapable of feeling the sort of deep, all-encompassing, passionate love he’d always read about in novels or heard his friends speak of.... until he met Dean Winchester.
They’ve barely finished packing up their gear when the first rumble of thunder rolls overhead and rain begins to fall. It’s a mad dash to the Impala from there, and since Dean had parked so far down, they’re fucking soaked to the bone by the time they shut themselves inside.
. It is novel, and a little terrifying, but not entirely unwelcome. So he relaxes with a roll of his shoulders, having long ago finished the meal, and contents himself with listening as Dean regales him with stories about the town, his business, his life. He asks questions when it is prudent to do so, but for the most part, allows Dean to steer the conversation down whatever path he wishes.
There are two bedrooms with a bathroom between them to the left of the sitting area, and to the right, a third bedroom, second bathroom, and enormous storage closet stacked high with boxes and crates full of what look like antiques, books, and old clothing. It's no mansion, to be sure, but a vast improvement on his tiny one-bedroom studio apartment in the city.
Pulling on the hand still holding his, he reels Cas into his arms and cups his cheek. When their lips meet this time, it’s almost delicate, letting the passion build slow and easy.
Standing, Cas lugs him to his feet, and they hold hands the remainder of their journey up the stairs, but once they reach the bedroom Cas’ smile turns bashful. So maybe they’ve lost some of their steam, and it’s no longer wild and rough like before. But this moment is no less magical with Cas’ face tinted pink and uncertain, hand still clutching Dean’s fingers like he’s terrified that if he lets go Dean will disappear.
Dean looks up at Ellen, who now has both eyebrows raised, the corner of her mouth lifting in a smirk that he can’t quite tell the meaning of. “The good stuff tonight, Ellen. A bottle, on me.”
He’d agreed to think about it and hung up, then sat, pensive and lost in said thoughts until Dean came outside asking if he was alright. He deflected, as usual, and Dean’s expression told him exactly how little he believed it. But he didn’t push.
Dean licks a stripe from jaw to ear, flicking the tip of his tongue against the lobe before whispering, “Don’t you want me?”
Fuck it; it’s not a big deal. He’s forty-two, not four. He can deal with cakeless birthdays and no gifts; it’s been like that his whole life. The best he usually gets is a greasy meal, and from time to time, a sloppy drunken lay.
“Emergency call,” he says, coming up beside Cas just as he finishes rolling up his sleeves. “Pipe busted during the renovation over at Sam’s office.”
Sam clears his throat and lets his arms unravel, drawing Castiel’s attention away from the strange look Dean’s shooting Benny. He says hello, and Sam returns the formal greeting with an embrace so surprising and warm that he forgets to hug back for a moment, ends up awkwardly patting the middle of his back instead.
Cas’ jaw makes a valiant attempt to meet the floor, and if not for the niggling of doubt in the back of Dean’s mind now screaming
Dean grins, broad and bright, even as he ignores the stupid little somersault his stomach does upon hearing that deep, gravelly voice again. “Awesome,” he says, waving toward the open seats.
Nothing wrong with that, he supposes. He got free pie and some decent conversation out of it, anyway. But it doesn’t change how the night ended, or the fact that Cas is gone. Dean rubs his temples, sets the coffee down, turns the shower on, and strips.
from the ProfoundBond Discord, who had no qualms in pointing out areas that needed improvement and gave me insight into the reader's POV. Thank you. I'm a better writer for it.
“You sure about that?” she says, head cocked low to catch his eyes again. “Think about it. All he’s given up… that’s not for nothing.”
Still holding Castiel's hand, she leans toward him. With her short stature, it pushes her tits up on the counter, ample cleavage out there for the whole friggin’ world to see. “Mmm, I’m sure you are,” she purrs. “So, what can I do ya for,
It’s got Dean reeling lately. Got him thinking a lot about the people in his life, what they mean to him, and where Cas fits.
Sure, kid’s got his own thing going. A fiance, a fancy degree, a career in the works. All Dean’s hard work has paid off before his very eyes. But now it’s up to him to show his brother that he’s okay too. He
Cas’ contemplative, unblinking eyes fix on the planes of his face as though each feature is a piece of a puzzle Cas longs to solve. He feels them like a caress, sliding over his brow, down his cheekbones, along the hinge of his jaw. His breath hitches in his throat under such intense scrutiny.
Instead, nervous and antsy from the minute they woke up that morning, Cas practically shoved them all out the door when they left and told them to “take their time,” whatever the hell that meant. It was beyond weird. Cas knows everything about Dean, possibly even moreso than Sam does. Knows him
Distracted by the uncomfortable memory, he doesn’t notice when his foot catches on the leg of someone’s chair. It's an out-of-body experience, watching himself stumble in slow motion, brain lagging several seconds behind as his upper half pitches forward. With a desperate cry, he squeezes his eyes shut and plummets to the floor, arms flailing out to catch himself and the noise around him is lost to the rush of blood in his ears when instead, he smacks face-first into what feels like a brick wall. A strangely warm and not at all painful fabric-covered brick wall. Then something crashes to the floor at his feet, a sharp sound too heavy for glass. It shatters, abrupt like a punch to the gut, splattering something sticky and warm all over his pants and shoes. His breath sticks in his throat, shuttered and hesitant.
Currently standing behind the bar, she raises an eyebrow when he passes by his usual seat, instead stalking toward the back corner booth with the most privacy. Dean climbs into it while Cas shucks off his trench coat and blazer, draping them on the opposite seat, finally giving Dean a small glimpse of the body hidden beneath all those ill-fitting layers.
“Almost.” Dean puts the phone down long enough to shirk out of his flannel and pull the t-shirt over his head. “Okay, okay I’m ready,” he says, panting a little from the combined buzz of alcohol and curious elation. “What, uh, what now?”
It isn’t like Castiel doesn’t try. He’s been on his share of dates, even let his friends set him up a few times. He spends occasional nights at the bar, goes to weekend lunches and movies with friends, takes a Sunday yoga class, and goes jogging daily at the park near his apartment. But work leaves little time for much else.
Cas slides across the seat toward him, body radiating heat. Pacifying and electrifying all at once, he craves
He’s never been good at this flirting business, at least not when doing so intentionally and entirely sober. He gulps down half his coffee in short order, avoiding Dean’s stare. The liquid soothes his throat now that it’s had time to cool, but does little for his nerves.
He cuddles in close. Only one other thing could sweeten this moment, but he doesn’t know yet if that’s welcome, if Dean shares the depth of his feelings, what this means for them going forward. How will Dean react when he wakes, when he realizes that he’s all but bared his soul to Castiel?
(He ignores the dark, skulking region of his brain faintly screaming, muffled and distant though it is by the gaping chasm between it and his yearning,
“And Sam, man, he was smart. Kid was going places. I think at some point Dad realized... Anyway, he brought us back here when I was fifteen, dropped us off with Bobby. Visited from time to time, but even when he was here, he wasn’t
Eyes flying open, his brain cycles a mile a minute as full consciousness hits with the force of an actual, physical slap to the face. It’s a weird-ass feeling waking up in your own bed, on your own sheets, but in an unfamiliar room. Fresh from a dream that, while he only recalls in bits and pieces, he’s still a hundred percent sure featured his handsome housemate and totally-not-platonic touching, kissing, moaning.
Next - things heat up between Dean and Cas (yes, it's about to get spicy) and their relationship takes a significant turn. Thoughts/theories? Let me know in the comments! Thanks so much for reading. Love y'all!
“Are you alright?” Cas says, perched above and atop him. A concerned frown hovers in the corners of his lips. “Shit, I’m sorry—”
Making his way outside, he’s confronted with the infamous trio of stoners sitting off to one corner, talking amongst themselves. He takes a large breath of the skunky air bleeding out into the crystal clear obsidian night, staring at the neglected garden beyond the faint ring of deck lights. It’s been sitting so long in disrepair, but hints of its former beauty remain in the outlined maze of plots leading to a dilapidated gazebo, the vines winding through slotted trellises over each section with empty planters still dangling at symmetrical intervals. He’s daydreaming about the hidden possibilities that lie within, what flowers he’d like to one day see blossom there again, about perhaps building an apiary and a greenhouse on the land further out, when the group finally notices his presence.
I hadn't planned for this to be the end for our boys and do have an additional two chapters (conclusion and epilogue) in the works but have taken a hiatus from writing for a bit because
“Woah…” He glances up. Mullet-guy is busy scanning Castiel’s identification, eyebrows reaching for his hairline. “Shurley?”
“Oh, ho! That mean you're stayin'?” Dean offers him the refilled cup and sets the bottle on the nightstand by his side of the bed.
He grips a little harder, and just as Dean’s hand comes to rest upon his, a kitschy disco tune starts playing under the table. Cas yanks his hand away as though burned and fumbles in his pockets for a minute before pulling out his phone. Blushing, he whispers, “Sorry,” before answering.
He barks out a totally-failing-at-casual and way too loud laugh, suddenly looking at everything in the room besides Cas. The ceiling with a small water stain he really hopes isn’t from a leak in the roof but knows probably is. The empty mahogany bed frame in the center of the room. The matching armoire nestled between two windows on the right-hand side of the room. The ugly, faded and peeling floral wallpaper.
He’d tried. He’d worked. Day in, day out, for the better part of a decade. And still, it had never been enough. Not for Michael, not for their father. Not for Castiel. He’ll always be the odd one out, that spanner in the wheel of their well-oiled machine. He’ll never quite
Sam claps a hand over Jack’s mouth and ushers him out of the room, not letting him finish the sentence. Cheeks flaming, Dean glares at his brother and adopted son’s backs.
He jerks his hand away, cheeks burning hot. Suddenly he really wants a stiffer drink, but all the diner has is beer and that ain’t near enough to settle these kinda nerves.
, but suddenly his tongue is thick in his mouth and his head keeps drooping and he’s so very, very tired. He shivers again, curls onto his side, sick yet unbearably relieved.
, ‘cause… well, because of Cas. Thankfully he’s making up for all that celibacy in spades now, and that thought alone makes his downstairs brain stir to life and his pace quicken.
“D-don’t gotta… I ain’t fragile, Cas,” Dean insists. Cas nips the soft flesh of his inner thigh, which earns him a yelp. Chuckling at that, he glances up to find Dean scowling at him between his legs. “You fucker.”
He remembered, and not only did Cas remember, but he—God, he’s just perfect. He’s perfect, and Dean never wants another birthday spent without him. He wants to retire, take Cas to the beach, get a little house to fix up somewhere, maybe a dog. He wants to give Cas the world, wants to wake up next to his newly-human, caffeine-addicted, grumpy and permanently bead-headed ass every single day for the rest of his life and never let him go.
Castiel’s lips part with a reply just as a throat clears beside them. Meg’s standing there, sliding two plates across the counter. Dean realizes he’s still holding Cas’ hand, and by the peculiar expressions on both his and Meg’s faces, has been doing so for way longer than is appropriate.
Jack follows like an eager little puppy, and Dean can’t help throwing an arm around his shoulders and tousling his soft, golden hair. As they both round the corner into the library, he hears frantic, hushed whispers from the kitchen and his ears perk up. Not like he needs to spy or anything, but he slows his steps anyway out of curiosity, holding Jack close to his side so the boy doesn’t give them away.
“Just gorgeous,” Cas mumbles, hands stroking Dean’s thighs for a moment like he’s lost in thought before he comes back to himself and tugs the pants over Dean’s feet, tossing them across the room.
He’s right in the middle of working himself open for the dildo he keeps squirreled away underneath the sink when his phone rings.
Sammy‘s already asleep in his room with the excuse of the long drive back from Eileen’s leaving him wiped out. Dean didn’t buy that for a hot second and didn’t pass up the opportunity to tease Sam with “so... practice your sign language?” (The bitchface was worth it.) Jokes aside, he’s happy for him. Eileen’s a great chick; smart, tough, witty, stubborn. Keeps Sam on his toes and puts that goofy, love-struck smile on his face.
The damp hair at his crown brush Dean’s nose, fluttering gently when he lets out a sigh and breathes in the familiar clean, earthy scent he’s become so addicted to. He regrets having worn a shirt again tonight, wishing he could feel more skin against his, but this isn’t about him. This moment is all for Cas.
anything,” Dean snaps harshly, shooting to his feet. Fists clenching at his sides, he feels a strong urge to punch the wall trembling through his arms, but remains frozen.
Without breaking their gaze, Cas slides down until his mouth hovers tantalizingly above Dean’s left nipple near the tattoo he and his brother share over their hearts. Cas’ tongue dips down, flicking at the nub until it hardens. Teasing, too gentle, the delicacy flickering an ember to life within Dean he’s still scared to acknowledge.
During every stop at the store, Dean loiters as long as he can reasonably get away with. (Luckily Rufus, the manager, has known him for years and so far nobody’s called the cops, but he has gotten some suspicious looks from other customers.) And every time, he tries and mostly fails to strike up a conversation with Cas.
His heart sings beneath his ribcage, beating a steady rhythm to match the rise and fall of Cas’ chest as their eyes pull each other close, closer, just a hair’s breadth away. Their noses touch. Dean tilts his head. Then, a soft press of lips, chaste and sweet.
Dean comes home minutes, hours later, he can't tell. Finds him maudlin, barely coherent, having not moved an inch from the spot on the floor where he crumbled. The heat of his anger subsided long ago, left him cold, bereft. But Dean folds in around him, the warm press of his muscled shoulder against Castiel’s cheek a welcome comfort. He wants to bottle the feeling; it's more effective than booze has ever been.
, and he knows at this moment that he’s in real trouble. The feelings he’d been trying to shove into the “purely lust” category all this time, the ones he’d only been capable of examining in spurts so he could then bury them down to ignore afterward are spilling over in waves and it’s all he can do to ride the tide and pray he survives.
Dean’s expression is a combination of disbelief, irritation, and as his eyes flicker between Castiel and Aaron, something darker Cas can’t quite put his finger on. Upon standing, his head feels light, legs heavy, and a laugh bubbles up from his chest. It bursts from his lips, brazen and uncontainable, his abdominal muscles clenching and eyes watering from the force of it. Dean steps forward, concerned, and grasps his shoulder to guide him away from the others. His skin tingles beneath the weight of those thick, calloused fingers. Eyes slipping briefly closed, the sensation vibrates down and through his chest. Or maybe that's from the humming.
, maybe he's not so unaffected after all. A sly thought crosses Dean's mind. He did say he wanted to hear Dean beg, and he loves cracking Cas' stoic facade just as much as Cas likes turning Dean into a damn puddle. Which he’s definitely succeeding at right now, because Dean’s
While he mans the grill, the ladies drag Cas away to dig through the box of fireworks for later. Ellen and Jess pull him into tight hugs that leave a pretty flush on the exposed skin where his collar is unbuttoned and open under his trench coat. Dean watches as Bobby wanders over, pointing out bottle rockets and mortar shells to Cas, whose hands remain awkwardly at his sides, shoulders forward in that slightly hunched way of his. Though he looks a little out of place, his expression is warm and tender, bringing a smile to Dean’s lips.
“What are you asking me?” he says softly, barely audible over the laughter around them and explosions above.
“Charlie,” he groans. “We’re not in middle school anymore, you can’t say that. But… yeah, I do. A lot.”
Now, Castiel stands in the center of his office, staring dumbly at the name flashing across the phone in his palm, a knot tightening in his gut. Dread sits at one corner of his mind, fraying at the edges, anger seeping in, the sour tinge of bile crawling up his throat. The fingers of his free hand twitch. He flexes them unconsciously.
His head is heavy, the ache that sprouted at its center that morning having steadily spread to his temples despite the over the counter painkillers he took an hour ago, and his throat’s even begun to feel sore. Within minutes, his eyelids begin to droop.
He licks his lips, letting a hand work down to surround himself, just a taste. A tease. He thickens further in his palm, a tingle reverberating through the base of his spine.
“Eh, screw it. They’re gonna do it whether I’m on duty or not. Long as they don’t do anything stupid or dangerous, I don’t care,” Jody says.
Cas rolls his eyes, though the tightening of his lips betray he’s holding back a smile. “I’m beginning to wonder who spends more time on their hair, you or your brother.”
“My name is Castiel.” He holds his hand out over the silver counter and her pale fingers snake over his palm like she can turn a simple handshake into a sexual act. “Pleased to meet you, Meg.
It takes a while to sink in. They stare at each other, sated and speechless, taking stock of their mutually blissful expressions, all blown pupils and swollen mouths, hair drenched and disheveled. Then burst into giggles.
Dean barks out a strained laugh, eyes flitting nervously between Charlie and Cas. Cas tilts his head and squints. His mouth opens, but before he can question her Dean grabs her by the elbow.
The cool July air sweeps over Dean’s skin, crisp and refreshing. It’s a marked contrast to the hot and occasionally humid days, most of which he spends working outdoors fixing whatever needs it all around town. Dean enjoys his job, the freedom of it. He goes where he’s needed and no job is ever exactly the same, and the best part? He gets to do it surrounded by family and friends, people he loves and cares for. It provides stability he lacked throughout his childhood and doesn’t take for granted now that he has it.
“Hmm...” Dean scrubs his chin, expression thoughtful. “Meet me outside when you’re done and we’ll go from there, ‘kay?”
Castiel refuses to claim the downstairs master, discomforted by the idea of sharing the space with the ghosts of grandparents he’d never met, of lying alone in the dark under the weight of their memories. A history unbeknownst to him, elusive, daunting, yet intriguing nonetheless. There are times when it’s painful just being
They enjoy a quick lunch in the city, and Castiel purchases some supplies from Dean’s list. During the return trip, on a quick stop for a restroom break, snacks, and drinks, Castiel exits the gas station to find Dean behind the car. He’s filling her (not "it", Dean was very insistent about that) up, eyes glued to the numbers ticking by on the pump, but something is noticeably off. Dean's on the phone, shoulders hunched, posture rigid. From the brief glimpse Castiel gets, his face is screwed into a frustrated scowl. Hesitantly, he moves toward his new friend and strains to catch what’s being said.
Eyes stinging, he fights against his quivering lip with a harsh bite, heart brimming with an overwhelming juxtaposition of emotion as though it’s simultaneously breaking and bursting. No one’s ever spoken to him this way, treated him like this, held him so protectively, as if he's something precious—not fragile, but
He kisses Cas again, ignoring the curious stares of passersby. The arms encircling his neck, holding him tight, tell him he's safe,
He’s really fucking dying. (And if he’s not, he kinda wants to, because whatever the hell this is feels
Neither of them say a word about what this might mean, just silently climb into the Impala and head to Moseley’s with both windows open to the spring air and Dean’s favorite Zepp mixtape playing through its B-side.
He nods emphatically. “Yeah, I’m fine. Why wouldn’t I be?” Looking away, he shovels pie in his mouth. Focuses on the flavors of apple, cinnamon, and flaky, buttery crust as it explodes on his tongue because pie makes everything better. Until Meg opens her mouth again, that is.
Their gazes lock, Cas’ eyes appearing darker than usual, a look hidden within their depths Dean can’t discern.
“What if…” He sat forward, picking at a loose thread at the hem of his shirt. “What if he doesn’t want me? And even if he does, what if his family doesn’t like me? What if the—”
. “Tonight, I want to listen to you fuck yourself. Pretend it’s my cock you’re riding, filling you up and breaking you apart. I want you begging for me, Dean, pleading for me to let you come. And you won’t come, not until I tell you, because you want to be a good boy for me. Isn’t that right?”
Suddenly Cas slides over on the bucket seat and there’s a hand on his knee, another turning his chin, green eyes meeting blue and the whole world fucking tilts on its axis as it hits him.
Dean sighs and stares at his boots, leaning his butt back on the table. “I’m afraid your radar is off this time.”
His palms feel slick against the wheel. He won’t look at her. Can’t. “Probably not.” He wonders impassively how bad it’d hurt to throw the door open right now, tuck and roll down the pavement. Not that he’d ever abandon Baby, but in this moment escape is preferable to reliving this confrontation and reopening old wounds.
Dean gasps, “Shit—wait, wait,” and scrambles from the wall. His hands flutter restlessly at his sides as though he can’t make up his mind what to do with them.
As Castiel had seen in the mirror earlier, his own appearance is complete with eye-bags, damp hair that refuses to tame, and day-old scruff he didn’t bother shaving because he rarely gets to ignore that part of the routine in his line of work. His clothes aren’t much to speak of, either. By college, he’d spent so long in boarding school uniforms he never developed a personal style beyond slacks and sweater vests. And being consistently broke, he wore whatever cheap, basic items he could thrift or buy in convenient multi-packs.
“I’m sorry. This is all my fault.” He sighs, shoulders slumping, and scrubs at his face with a calloused palm. “Fuck, Char, what am I gonna do? I don’t want to make this weirder than I already have!”
Cas smiles wistfully, glancing down at his glass. “Indeed. Anyway, since turning eighteen and starting university, I’ve been on my own.”
That does make him smile, however lazily, because he knows it to be true. Always has been, always will be.
? She begins backing away toward wherever it is she wandered over from and salutes. “Don’t give up, is all I’m saying. Be seeing you, Dean.”
His heart still desperately attempting to escape his ribcage, Castiel isn’t sure how to respond, or if he should at all. Without meeting Castiel’s eyes, Dean’s smile drops in the ensuing quiet, expression flickering with emotions he can’t quite discern before schooling into placid neutrality.
Dean’s forcefully clenched jaw and determined eyes tell him he is more than displeased with that answer but is biting his tongue against whatever he truly wants to say. “What did you do after that?”
He thinks of refusing, but it’s technically his party, right? He can afford to live a little, as his brother frequently reminds him, so he takes the proffered joint from Andy’s fingers. He puffs once and holds it, exhaling slowly as he sits beside the others.
“Hello, Dean,” Castiel replies, voice surprisingly steady. He moves across the room, one arm extended with his offering. Dean takes it but eyes the liquid within suspiciously before lifting it to his nose. His eyebrows rise.
Giving in to the urge, Castiel leans his back against the wall, legs spread, and thumbs over the head of his cock. Doesn’t even try to bite back the moan that spills from his throat at the satisfaction that little taste of friction provides. His pelvis rocks forward, sliding him easily through a tight circle of soapy fingers as he replays the path Dean took that morning with his free hand.
“Ugh,” Dean interrupts, eyes flitting away. He wiggles uncomfortably, lets out an embarrassed huff. “Think I’m layin’ in my own spunk.”
Disappointment floods through him, as he wants to see, wants to look into Dean’s eyes as he makes love to him. But he shoves the feeling aside, buries it for now. Instead guides Dean up, helps him shift to his knees where he immediately turns around and faceplants into his pillows, ass in the air. Castiel drags his lower lip between his teeth. Perhaps not what he’d intended, but God, it’s still a beautiful sight.
Why he even cares so much, Dean has no clue, aside from it being rare to have new people around. Okay, and yeah, the guy is
“I might chase stories for a living Dean, but if you wanted out you could have saved yours. Told me the truth.”
. He’s never seen him so exposed, so unrestrained. It’s hard for Dean to let go like this, he knows. He knows and doesn’t take it for granted. The trust Dean is handing over, this
“Never have been.” He takes a larger gulp of his coffee. Too soon. He hisses through his teeth as it singes his tongue, burns and numbs in equal measure on the way down.
Suddenly self-conscious, he circles the center island to pour himself coffee, lamenting today’s choice of black slacks (since his jeans are dirty) and plain grey t-shirt. Both of which are horribly wrinkled from sitting in his suitcase all week. He's never placed much priority on his wardrobe, nor had much occasion to regret that fact... until now. Parking a hip against the island beside Dean, Castiel wonders idly what he’d choose, given the option. If he would look more appealing, perhaps, with a little more effort.
Today marks nearly two weeks since Cas first arrived in Eden, though it feels like it’s been twice that. Not that Dean’s counting or anything. (He totally is.) He’s got the day off, so he makes a giant apology breakfast and fixes Cas’ coffee for him just the way he likes it—black with two spoonfuls of local honey instead of sugar, because like the sap Dean apparently is, he’s already got that memorized—and if Cas knows Dean’s being extra nice to make up for last night’s argument, he gracefully doesn’t mention it.
He turns and strips his own shirt, mimicking the process in a rush. He’ll take another shower at home anyway.
More than once, he’s caught Dean staring at him when he thinks Castiel’s not looking. At first, he figured it was possible said staring had nothing to do with Dean finding his physical appearance enticing. For all he knew, he could be little more than an interesting specimen to Dean, no different from a butterfly pinned to a corkboard. Relying on “gaydar”, as Balthazar calls it, is dubious at best and dangerous at worst, so Castiel’s always erred on the side of caution. And even then, if his suspicion proved correct, there would still be the issue of whether or not Dean is out. The intense machismo the man exhibits, what with the clothing and muscle car and attitude, screams overcompensation and performative masculinity.
Dean’s not sure if he should be relieved or ashamed. In truth, he’s a little of both. But he needs Sam to give this a chance; not just Cas, either, but the whole plan. Because regardless of whatever happens with Cas, if he stays or goes, the house is on the line and with that comes a whole chunk of dreams Dean’s forged since he was young. Not only for his sake, but for Sam’s, too.
He rubs the nape of his neck right as Krissy brushes past him with a broom. Backing up another step to give her space, he glances around the diner and doesn’t miss the stares he gets in return. Jo’s smirking from her center table, eyes all lit up. Even Benny’s got a big dumb grin, with Garth beside him in the corner booth looking back and forth, smiling awkwardly like he’s missing out on the joke but desperate to play along. To make matters worse, Meg’s got her elbows on the countertop and is obviously checking the new guy out, head to toe, biting her lip. Dean glares at her before turning back to him and jerking a thumb over his shoulder.
Clearing his throat, Dean steps back and looks down at the shoes in question. Sure enough, he finds a dozen little globs of apple filling clinging to his scuffed steel-toes and the hem of his worn, faded jeans.
Dean shakes his head. “No. Just, I dunno. Worried about you, I guess. You seemed kinda off, then you disappeared, and next thing I know you’re out here getting stoned with these guys...”
Minutes later they’re clambering clumsily up the front steps, laughing, shoulders bumping. As they fling the door open and stumble across the threshold, almost tripping over one another, Castiel feels lighter than he ever has before.
He knows with the same certainty that he knows the sky is blue, or that few things irritate like sunlight on the back of his eyelids in the morning. There are certain absolutes in the universe, and in this case, one absolute is that Michael never calls him for anything. He barely acknowledges his existence.
It isn’t until his hand is on the door that he registers what he’s just done or the stuttered little gasp it elicited from the other man. With a quick glance over his shoulder, he sees Castiel motionless, eyes wide, in the same spot he left him. He looks stunned, a hand resting upon his cheek.
Her hand grips his shoulder, pulls him into her arms. There aren’t many people Dean lets do this, but Ellen’s the closest thing he’s had to a mom since age four. She smells like coffee, wood chips, and cinnamon, and there’s no arguing with her once she’s made up her mind, so he goes with it, sagging against the older woman and inhaling deeply as she strokes his back in small, soothing circles. Slowly, his tension begins to dissipate.
.” Harsh and claiming, he bites at the junction of Dean’s neck and shoulder, all teeth and tongue and
want. I’m tired of being alone, having no one. Besides Gabe, my family has always treated me like a fuckup, a defective tool, like it’d be better if I weren’t around. I was never good enough”—he blinks back tears—“I’ll never be good enough. But my brother’s so far away, and I’m always alone, and now my father is dead and I don’t want to go back to that, I don’t, I
When his gaze returns, the sight that greets him nearly takes his breath away. Castiel’s eyes are glossy and sincere, his own hope and yearning echoing within. Maybe he’s not imagining things after all, maybe it’s now or never to shoot his shot and find out.
Cas stares at the offending appendage so long Dean starts to worry the guy has a thing about germs before he takes it and gives it a sturdy shake. His palms are dry and warm and surprisingly soft against Dean’s own calloused ones and the strength of his grip is giving Dean all kinds of inappropriate fantasies.
Castiel has to admit, the moment he leaves the city lights and tall, cold buildings behind, a weight lifts from his shoulders.
Dean settles for rubbing one out quick and dirty over the toilet (which is exactly as depressing and unsatisfying as it sounds) before cleaning up, putting his stuff away, and dressing in some work clothes.
Dean turns away. Castiel blurts, “Dean, wait.” He glances back, meeting Castiel’s eyes, his own guarded. “Thank you.”
‘Course he knows, he helped him get the damn place. Sam’s been trying to open up his own small law practice to service the county’s five thousand some-odd residents (though Dean swears they count the cows on the census) since he moved back from Stanford, and Jess started teaching at the local elementary school in mid-August.
The flush upon his cheeks spreads down his neck from the compliment, warms him from within until he glows with it.
. Castiel spins in the chair, stands, and stares through the blinds out at the cityscape below his fourteenth-floor view. His heart thuds wildly again in his chest, uncomfortable and abrasive as it hammers against bone. As he moves, the cool air from the overhead fan wisps across the damp sweat clinging to his brow, and for the first time, he notices the crisp white button-down matting itself to the skin of his back.
“Is this…” Dean pauses, cheeks flushing as he rubs his nape. “Is this because of last night? The nightmare? Or what we—”
So he turns, completely silent, and flees to the nearest bathroom. Jacks off rough and fast, biting his knuckles to muffle the desperate moan as he comes hard all over his fingers and the floor. Then mopes guiltily around the house like a kicked puppy because the barbs they traded apparently held enough venom to guarantee the silent treatment. Without a word, Cas has him ready to grovel for forgiveness because yeah, he was definitely being a dick and Castiel not talking to him, the invisible wall he's built up, hurts way more than it should.
This could either be the dumbest decision Dean’s ever made, or the smartest, but fuck it, his hang-ups are his own. Cas needs him—or someone, at least—right now.
He nods. “When I went to work for my father’s company, I was fresh out of university. It was…” he trails off, eyes nailed to the table. Throat constricting on the syllables, he swallows hard. It’s not a time he looks back on fondly.
Dean prefers one in the corner by the window, relishes the way the afternoon sun there makes Cas’ eyes gleam, and that booth is mysteriously never taken when they’re there. About a month down the line, he purposely waits until Cas is a few steps ahead of him to ask Missouri in a hushed whisper if she saves it for them. She just gives him a knowing smile.
“I was in the neighborhood and saw the lights on.” He shrugs, leaning against the front counter, ankles crossed. “Whatcha got left to do? Put me to work, buddy.”
, he’d probably laugh at the stunned expression. Then Cas’ eyes start to actually water and no, no, he screwed up didn’t he? Royally.
The silence grows deafening and tense, though Dean seems undisturbed as he scrolls through his phone laying flat on the table and polishes off his breakfast.
He glares at Sam from the side of his eye, wordlessly warning him to cool it, but Cas doesn’t so much as wince. Even seems to match Sam’s strength, which is entirely unexpected and… all manner of hot. Bobby just watches the exchange, arms crossed and clearly amused.
While Dean stashes the beer in the cooler, Cas takes their chairs over to the others, and Sam lays the food on the foldable table alongside the rest of their bounty. Ellen brought a bowl of her homemade potato salad and savory-sweet brown sugar baked beans (with bacon, of course), Sam his traditional rabbit food, and Dean the burgers and hot dogs.
He feels a little aimless as a host with everyone already having poured their own drinks and helped themselves to the food, stacked high on the styrofoam plates he’d left out. Again, Dean reassures him that this is normal, and not to worry. He offers him a cup of whiskey, which Castiel takes with a soft, pleased smile, and they pick their way through the food side-by-side.
“It’s okay.” Cas exhales softly, body curled in on itself. He still won’t look Dean in the eye and that pains him. “I… well,” Cas mumbles, ducking his head to hide his face. “I was frustrated and took it out on you. So, for what it’s worth, I apologize.”
Even later once they were left with Bobby (who, at the time, was a year off from marrying Ellen, the two of them stuck in some weird, stubborn back and forth) it took a long time to feel like they belonged. So Dean and Sam still went on their midnight cruises, finding comfort in the familiar leather seats of the closest thing they’d ever had to a home and each others’ company. Stuck to each other like glue because the fear permeated every thought, every little thing they did, that one of these days Bobby would leave them too. Kick them out. Give up.
When Gabriel replies, it’s with a slow drawl, enunciating each word clearly and carefully as though speaking to a child. “Dad left us an estate.”
Dean didn’t mean to come off so petulant. Normally he’s a pretty laid-back guy, and there isn’t a lot that gets to him besides family crap. Because those are the people who mean something. Any old stranger could come up to him and start a fight, and yeah, maybe he’d fight for the heck of it if the mood struck him. But it wouldn’t grate on him, and he certainly wouldn’t dwell on it after.
Peeling, crumbling wallpaper coating the house begs to be scraped and the walls painted. The cabinets in the kitchen and bathroom require their own coats, and probably new countertops and hardware to match. All the mattresses have acquired mildew and must be replaced (plus, who the fuck wants to sleep on someone else's dirty old mattress, gross), along with the appliances.
He rocks forward, seeking relief. The sheets are too hot on his skin and the pressure within him builds, teetering on that fine border of pleasure-pain. The hand at his waist slides down to his hip, fingertips digging into his skin, pulling him closer, tangible and solid and—
Dean hasn’t been in many relationships, especially not with men (okay, none, technically, since traded blowjobs in backseats as a teenager and occasional one night stands as an adult hardly make the cut). Not because he’s ashamed, not since Dad…
Castiel stares at his reflection in the bathroom mirror. Notes the color which has returned to his skin, the robust glow it’s taken on in recent weeks. Though he’s fairly certain the bags under his eyes are permanent fixtures, they seem less prominent and dark than the night he learned of his father’s passing. The eyes themselves are clear and bright and his cheeks are less gaunt.
the house. Touching things. Looking at a past not his own. He finds himself drifting, wallowing, every so often, longing for people that were never his to know, wondering how different his life would have been had they still been alive. Daydreaming about a childhood he never had.
conversation go any further. He elbows his brother hard in the ribs and jerks his head toward the hallway.
Dean frowns. He has the urge to shake him and insist that it is but lets it go. "What about your brothers?”
Cas braced himself for this from the moment he hit “send,” yet that doesn’t prevent an icy shudder of trepidation from trickling down his spine when his phone rings Monday morning. He takes a breath. Wipes a paint-stained hand on the jeans now designated for household chores and digs the phone of his pocket, warily lifting it to his ear.
When released, he looks shyly at his feet, worried that Sam will take it as an affront. Knowing how important he is to Dean, it means so much to him that they be friends. Thankfully, the younger Winchester simply gives him an understanding smile that reminds Castiel so much of Dean.
. He takes a short video instead, first putting his stretched and puffy pink hole on full display, ass and legs taut and trembling. Then brings the phone around to his front so Cas can see his entire body’s flushed and gleaming, hair an outright mess, cock red and pulsing and leaking all over his panties. Dean’s irises are overtaken by black, cheeks tinged dark pink and stained with tears he didn’t even know he’d been crying. He looks positively
“So it’s as Gabriel told me,” Michael replies, voice dripping with disdain. “You’re still in South Dakota.”
Dean pauses at that, gives him a strange look. Perhaps it was not the answer he expected. “Oh, well, uh. Don’t need to.” He shrugs. “Not my first rodeo.”
Soon as they arrive, Cas cordons Claire off in an upstairs bedroom with food and toys so she won’t be underfoot. Cas is easy to get along with, which settles any lingering nerves he has over the prospect of living together, however temporarily. His sense of humor is dry as a damn desert, and it’s harder to get a chuckle out of the guy than anyone Dean’s ever met ‘cause he either finds his puns absurd or doesn't get them to start with, but Dean kinda likes it. Adds to the challenge.
Sam’s shoulders sag as he shoves his hands into his jacket and stares at his boot scuffing against the ground. He looks so damn young in that moment, nostalgia hits Dean like a tsunami. Takes him back to the day (age nine or ten if he’s remembering it right) he’d come back from a store not far from their seedy motel at the border between Missouri and Arkansas.
Castiel gently sets her down, and she trots to her bowl with an eager mewl. After pouring her some food (and spilling kibble all over the floor in the process), he wanders into the bathroom. He loosens his tie and sighs, hands falling to grip the sink’s edge.
Dean makes a plan in his head. He’ll wolf down the pie, guzzle the beer, and run to the Roadhouse across the street where Ellen will fix him up good. Then he’ll go home, jerk off, and that’ll be the end of that. Probably won’t ever see Castiel Shurley again, cause for all he knows, the dude’s just passing through. Yeah. A solid plan, if a disappointing one.
There’s a brief silence before his phone pings. And son of a bitch, Cas is already completely nude, spread out on the cheap paisley motel duvet, miles of tanned skin begging for Dean’s mouth, his hands. Castiel’s hair is an absolute disaster like he’s been running those long, slender fingers through it all night, pink lips puffy from obvious biting, hooded eyes dark and intense. From the angle, Cas holds the phone near his hip, giving Dean a glorious view of its sharp edge.
Claire sits curled in his lap, purring contentedly. He’d considered leaving her with Hannah but wasn’t sure how long he’d be away. She wasn’t too happy about flying or being stuck in a crate for part of the trip, but he feels better having her with him. He drags a palm down her silken fur as the cab leaves the pavement and pulls down a winding dirt road that leads to a large, colonial farmhouse. Scratching behind her ears, he peers through the windshield as the driver parks.
, f-fuck,” Cas stutters, eyes rolling back into his head, and if Dean’s mouth weren’t completely full right now he’d grin because

Cas stares down at his hand for a minute, mouth still quirked up on one side, then grips it firmly. “Castiel Shurley. At
By the time he finally works down to the base, the blood in his veins is lighting him up from within, his skin burning hot with want, thighs shaking, chest heaving, pretty panties soaked with lube and precome and sweat.
Running a hand along the length of Dean’s flank, he lubes himself up with the other and settles behind him, holding the base of his cock and letting the head catch and tease at Dean’s rim. Castiel eases carefully inside in one slow, smooth motion, keeping a firm grip on his hip to prevent him from pushing back just yet and fuck,
Castiel has never felt that level of comfort anywhere. He yearns, so deeply that it aches, to know what it’s like. To comprehend Dean’s meaning, not in an abstract, theoretical sense but to truly
Only Sam knows because, as much as Castiel loves Jack, the boy cannot keep a secret. Not for lack of trying, it’s simply in his nature to be bluntly honest. Castiel’s lips twitch as he dusts flour across the sanitized countertop and rolling pin, readying them for the dough. He was once that way, too. Still is, sometimes. But he’s changed so much, grown.
It’s with that ominous start that Dean drags himself through the monotony of his morning ablutions. He takes a piss, brushes his teeth, runs some pomade through his hair, and swipes on a thick layer of deodorant. After throwing a plaid shirt on over a threadbare AC/DC tee, shimmying into a pair of faded-at-the-knee jeans, and tugging his steel-toes over socked feet, he grabs his favorite snapback, an army-green canvas jacket, and heads out the door with plenty of time left to make one stop before work.
. He knows Dean more intimately than anyone in the universe, even his own brother, so with Cas, he doesn’t have to say a word. Cas is sensitive to his needs. Knows without being asked how to give him exactly what he desires, how to take the reins and lift the yolk of responsibility from Dean’s shoulders.
“Dean,” he murmurs, breath gentle against his ear. Skin prickling at the sensation, Dean shivers. Realizing the car’s stopped moving, his hands drop from the wheel to his sides. They fidget on the seat, impatient to reach out, pull Cas into his lap. “Is this okay?” With the first tender kiss to the hinge of his jaw, his eyes slip shut.
So he does, following his angel’s instructions to the letter. It’s a delicious torment, each soft caress ramping up his heart rate that much more, bringing a heaviness to each breath that makes his chest ache.
Sam and the man Castiel assumes to be Benny step out of a truck bearing the same logo as Dean's. He's a vaguely familiar, broad man in a charcoal tweed newsboy cap, about Castiel's own height but seeming larger for his bulk. All hefty muscle and a swagger in his step that screams confidence and charm. As he approaches, Castiel notes piercing yet soulful sky-blue eyes, twinkling with amusement above a lopsided smirk.
Castiel accepts, flicking off the lamp and sliding into bed. Dean hauls the blanket up over them both, lying back with one arm behind his neck. His eyes close, and the slight upturn of his lips, the smoothness to his features, say happy,
to him. Things that are totally not okay to be feeling out in public in a crowded diner during the dinner rush (which, even in a place like Eden is one person too many). And they’re still close, he realizes, enough so he can detect the guy’s scent lingering in the scant space between them. There’s a sharp note of ozone, like right before a thunderstorm, but above it a layer of sweetness. It reminds him of honeysuckle in the spring, of earth and rain, and yet again, “angel” passes through his head involuntarily.
He doesn’t believe in fate; that stuff’s only for fairy tales and romantic comedies and that one play his English teacher had the class read in high school he’ll never acknowledge made him tear up a little. Yet he can’t quite shake the idea that they were meant to meet because... Cas feels like a piece of Dean he never knew was missing.
Dean thinks of asking Cas if he wants one, but can’t bring himself to look at or talk to him right now, choosing instead to storm off toward the coolers in tense silence. He tosses his empty bottle in the bag they’d brought and flips open the lid on the Coleman, popping the cap on a fresh one and taking a long swig before leaves crackling underfoot bring his attention to someone approaching.
Dean responds magnificently, not putty in his palms as he was earlier but demanding in return, slamming back against Castiel. “Right there
Sorry for the time between my last update and now. Been runnin' low on spoons and I wanted to make sure this chapter was perfect for y'all before I put it out there.
The reminder that his new friend's time there is limited twists something beneath his ribs, and it’s a feeling he’d rather not dwell on right now.
Dean glances at Castiel’s reflection in the mirror to see him leaning against the doorframe behind him. To anyone else, his expression remains as casually shuttered as ever, but Dean detects impatience in the minute tic of his jaw and narrowing of his eyes. He flashes the man a haughty grin, running wax-lathered hands through his hair.
Dean glowers at her over his pie, swallows hard, and mouths, “bite me”. She mouths in return, “anytime, baby”. Fed up, he takes a swig of the beer and says, maybe a little too forcefully, “Don’t you have a job to do? One that doesn’t include bugging your customers?”
Shivering, he stumbles toward the bathroom but his vision tunnels, black spots flickering over his eyes. Dean collapses against the doorframe with an agonized groan.
Castiel exhales in a rush, jaw hanging open for several seconds before he snaps it shut, swallowing with an audible click. His mouth is horribly dry. Eyes falling to his lap, he finds his hands had fisted upon his knees. He relaxes them now, fingers aching.
“Yes.” Cas blushes instantly, eyes darting to the floor. “I… I haven’t been with anyone in a long time. But I got tested after my last, um, partner.”
“You have no idea,” Cas says. He’s still smiling as he stuffs his cheeks full of the burger and groans with pleasure.
He squirms in his seat, adjusting himself as subtly as he can in a room full of people. People he knows, no less, which just makes him feel even grosser for the images crossing his mind right now. Cas with tie loose and shirt rumpled, trench coat spread open, hair a delicious mess from Dean’s teasing fingers. Skin flushed, lips parted, moaning like that but around something else entirely.
His voice is abnormally breathy, which Castiel chalks up to the alcohol. But it does his dick no favors, judging by the valiant twitch it gives beneath the fabric of his pants. He’d love nothing more than to hear that word uttered in an entirely different context. Repeatedly.
“I wanted to tell you why I call you Sunshine. Why I would play the same tape on repeat whenever you were in the car with me—and I know you thought I couldn't hear you sing along under your breath, but I could—you can't carry a tune if your life depends on it but I don’t give a shit because I can listen to you all day. I-I wanted to tell you how cute it is when, you know that thing you do when you don't get a joke? And—and the way your nose scrunches up when you
go, all but one ended before the two-month mark, and it’s one he’d sooner forget because the memory still cuts to the quick.
He studies Dean, mentally compiling a list of attributes that stand out. While Dean has numerous physical characteristics that anyone would find pleasing, it’s the inner workings of the man that intrigue Castiel the most. Despite the difficult childhood he described the evening prior, he shows remarkable resolve and determination. He is kind beneath the sarcastic, flirty, sometimes brusque exterior that Castiel is already beginning to believe is a protective front. He’s adaptable, down to earth, charming, and adorably passionate. Dean is utterly unlike anyone Castiel has ever met, and a swell of something akin to fondness builds within him as he absorbs this new information and catalogs it beside the rest.
“I—oh.” Cas scrubs both hands down his face, then stares at the damp palms in disbelief. He slowly turns them over, digging his fingers into the blanket across his thighs. “I’m sorry to have woken you.”
“That sucks. My bad, man.” Ash’s gaze drops back to the computer like it contains solutions to all the world's problems and it's his sole job to fix them.
Castiel relishes the scrape of stubble against his lips, the shiver that runs through Dean, the lascivious groan which escapes when he laves the bruising flesh with his tongue. On autopilot, he bucks into the writhing body in his lap and Dean responds in kind, setting a dirty grind as they both chase the friction they crave. But that voice still nags at the back of his mind, one that reminds him they're moving too fast, that there are things left unspoken and it wouldn't be right to go on without ensuring Dean is of sound mind and this is truly what he wants.
For now, he must find somewhere to stay, at least until he can get the utilities turned on. Castiel pulls out his phone and searches for the nearest hotel, which as it turns out, is “Eden Lodge”, a quaint six-room place just off the main street they’d passed earlier.
Dean picks up extra shifts, works himself to the bone with 60 hour weeks for a while until Bobby cuts him off with the excuse of, “you’re gonna kill my wallet with all this overtime, boy. Go home.” Dean doesn’t believe him. Bobby’s worried, but knowing all too well how Dean reacts to emotional confrontation, he’s probably unwilling to acknowledge it or thinks Dean just needs some space and will come to him when he’s ready.
Dean takes the rest of the week off so they can begin cleaning out the kitchen, upstairs bedrooms, and bathrooms. Sweeping floors, dusting surfaces, carrying out what Castiel doesn’t want to keep either to dump or donate to Singer’s Salvage or the local second-hand store. It’s hard, exhausting, rewarding work, watching the results of his efforts play out in realtime. Slowly but surely, the insect and animal dander (
Don’t get him wrong; he digs the hell out of Bad Company, but love songs have been hitting him in all the wrong places lately. And no, contrary to what his friends will tell you, it’s not because he’s lonely. He has plenty of company. He dates.
He looks back at the guys, eyebrows climbing into his hairline. Jack frowns, head cocked as he sniffs the air, totally perplexed. But Sam—
He pretends his gut doesn’t wrench, teeth don’t grind, and the world doesn’t tint crimson when he hears Cas on the phone with
Gabriel always tells him he is too honest for his own good, and as much as he’s loath to admit it, his brother is usually correct.
Meg’s eyes narrow briefly at Dean as he bursts into raucous laughter, slapping a hand on the table before she flashes another lascivious grin in Castiel’s direction. "It's whatever you want it to be, Clarence." She winks, openly appraising him. "Just stating the obvious."
“Okay, Char, you got me. He’s hot. Catherine Bach hot. Young Harrison Ford hot. But we’re just roommates, I swear.”
“Hmm?” Dean tears his eyes away from Cas, finds Sam has followed his gaze, and awkwardly clears his throat. “How’s what going?”
Apparently, his dick thinks so, too. That or the coffee’s finally scoured the last dregs of sleep away and this is delayed morning wood. He stares down at it, red and heavy between his legs, as though its very presence is an insult.
Scrubbing the wetness from his cheek with a low growl, he shoves everything down, down. Watches as the sky slips into violet dusk, a cumulonimbus cluster forming above the road ahead. Thunder rolls, its echo oddly muffled, muted by the flat expanse of nature stretched around him. Sharp, biting notes of ozone fill the air. Anticipating rain, he rolls the window up just in time for the first few splatters on the windshield. His view obscured, he flips on the wipers and slouches in his seat.
Gravity weighs strangely now, awareness pressing in around him and he starts, vertigo hitting as his brain fights to reconcile too many simultaneous discordant sensations. It’s tipping, evolving, and Dean’s left wavering in the gap, semi-lucid but not quite enough to make himself move or speak. The fog is still too strong, too soft and pleasant, a hazy glow of contentment unfurling in his chest. It won’t allow him to open his eyes because he doesn’t want this to end, not now that Cas is here.
Plating the eggs and bacon, Dean shakes his head, the indulgent smile playing at the corners of his mouth taking the bite out of his next statement. “Just grumpy.”
Castiel doesn’t feel up to making the trek all the way to “his” bathroom, so he uses Dean’s, which is right beside his—their?—room. He shuffles out to check on Claire, who’s perched, alert and tail twitching, on one of the windowsills in the sitting room with the bookshelves, staring at birds or something. Shrugging at her utter lack of interest in him, he pours food into her dish in the other room and goes downstairs to brew coffee.
Apprehension worms through him as he tries to send her a mental signal to please not give Cas “the talk” right here and now, and she gives him a look in return that says Dean’s gonna get one later regardless.
He fights to relax, to slide back into his formerly tranquil state, though the faint unease lingers, buzzing under his skin like an itch that can’t be scratched. Pushing it away, his mind drifts. A part and apart, floating, physical sensation dulls and he fixates on those noises, lets them anchor him to this moment in time and space and hopes the water outside can somehow wash away the pain and guilt, scrub him clean.
Then Ash barges into the room behind them, wiping his hands on an oil rag. “Eeeey, Dean! Caught you just in time.”
“Yes, I’m fine. I’m sorry about your pie. And”—he gestures vaguely in Dean’s direction—“your shoes.”
It’s incredibly discomfiting, walking through someone else’s home, someone else’s life, and his heart thrums, chest feeling tighter with each step. Charles Shurley had been a secretive man, never particularly warm or benevolent toward him or his siblings. Castiel did everything he could to understand the man, to win his approval, had even gone to work for his company a bit after graduating from university. But he was a tough person to know, reclusive, and mercurial.
Cas cocks an eyebrow at that and when Dean points at the tag pinned crookedly to his vest, he looks down at his own chest as though noticing it for the first time and mumbles, “Oh.”
Dean swallows thickly, eyes darting up to catch the back end of Cas’ smirk as he nudges past him and into the hall. “Th-there’s, uh, p-pizza downstairs,” he stammers, watching Cas pad barefoot over the hardwood.
"What I tell you, man, we got some strange folks here. But they're good people. It's a good town. Once it gets its hooks in you it's hard to let go."
Several minutes pass, he’s not sure how long, with him staring out at the other people lining the shore, just thinking to himself. He spots a group of teenagers huddled around a small fire, giggling and sipping what he can guarantee isn’t just punch out of red solo cups. A father carrying his young daughter upon his shoulders, pointing out constellations. Two young boys crouched in the sand, digging through a box of Roman candles, bringing him back to a time when he and Sam had done the same at this very lake for the first time. A mother soothing a fussy toddler in her lap, husband beside her holding out the peace offering of a juice box.
Glancing up, he catches sight of his dripping reflection. Scarlet cheeks, lips kiss-swollen, hair standing at end, pupils still dilated with arousal though his erection has decidedly wilted without attention. He reaches for the hand towel hanging beside the sink and dabs at his face and neck, noticing a fresh mark near his collar where Dean’s lips had bitten and sucked at the flesh. He touches it gently with his fingertips, running over each little impression of Dean’s teeth and suppresses a shudder at the heady rush that brings him.
“Look, I don’t know if he’s uh, into me that way. Or dudes, period. What’s he gonna think if people assume we’re together? What if he thinks that’s what
He never would have pegged Dean for a cuddler, but he couldn’t have been more wrong because the following morning, Castiel wakes to a firm body plastered to his sweating back. While it was grounding the previous night, a soothing balm for all the stress he’s been under and conflicted emotions which culminated in a nightmare he can’t even remember, it’s bordering on uncomfortable right now, almost sweltering.
“Nope. Rest of them are still back home, except Gabe. He lives out in Los Angeles. Visits us sometimes, though.”
He’s halfway down the stairs when Cas rounds the corner at the bottom step, wiping his sweaty, glistening chest with his balled-up shirt, a curious tilt to his head. It’s a struggle to keep Dean’s eyes above his neckline.
Tilting his head, he lets out a hushed, “Goodnight, Dean,” and it’s not long before Dean’s breathing evens out, the first gentle, adorable snores sneaking free. He watches the eyelashes dusting Dean’s skin, the subtle shadows carved beneath his cheekbones, remembers the look in his eyes as he’d
“Not at all.” Cas does that cute little head tilt, then looks at Dean. “Dean speaks very highly of you.”
Startled, Castiel backs toward the front, half expecting some vandal to burst into the room, mask and all, to shake him down. His heart races, nostrils flaring as he reaches one long arm out toward Claire’s crate, ready to make a beeline for the exit.
She frequently references his looks, and now he is unsure whether she's doing so to tease the two men or sincerely finds him attractive. "I'm sorry, is that a flirtation?" he asks.
he shudders, hoping Claire’s pending presence will keep them at bay) is cleared away, the accumulated grit and grime of neglect scrubbed. He's never felt like this from his job. This relief, this sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. A steady glow blossoms within him; it speaks of promise. The future.
Cas’ eyes drill through him analytically as he pats down the bottom corners and, finished smoothing out the poster, settles on his heels to admire it. He pointedly ignores Cas until the guy gives up and moves to sit cross-legged at the foot of the bed, pulling clothing out of the basket to fold.
and he’s floating on cloud nine for how high and giddy he feels right here, right now, in this ancient car that smells of leather and oil and sweat and Dean’s cheap aftershave while rain pelts a steady drumbeat on the roof above their heads in rhythm to the thundering of his too-full heart.
“Heard from our boy lately?” Bobby’s voice is rough but affectionate, somehow clear as crystal over the music.
. This thing between them, it burns brighter than the sun, pulls them into each other’s orbit time and time again. There’s no escaping it, and neither of them wants to. His lips part.
Surprisingly thick thighs strain against the seams of his slacks, which tell Dean that even if he does sit at a desk every day, his off-time is definitely not going to waste. The white collared button-down pulls taut over his shoulders, biceps, and chest, dipping to a slender waist. He's lean and firm in a way that almost makes Dean’s mouth water
Dean lowers the tools, his head hanging in a similar fashion. “You really say whatever’s on your mind, don’t you, Cas?” he murmurs softly.
, to reach up, pull it free with his thumb. Wants to know if it’s as soft and plush as it looks, how it would feel against his own lips, if Cas would taste as lovely as he always smells. Instead, Dean croaks hoarsely, “Wh-what?”
The flush of heat spreads from the tips of his ears down to his collar. With a humiliated lump in his throat, he sluggishly raises his head to meet the most brilliant eyes he’s ever seen. Beautiful, bright green, surrounded by long, full lashes. They crinkle at the corners, sparkling with amusement. And now he can't make up his mind whether this is a nightmare, like the ones he had of showing up to class naked as a kid, or the beginnings of a pornographic
“I will have that, then. Thank you.” Castiel looks her over appreciatively and gives her a smirk that makes Dean’s heart sink into his stomach a little.
He comes to in bits and pieces. At one point sees a blurry Cas pacing the room, speaking in frantic whispers, and Dean can’t tell if he’s talking to himself or he’s on the phone but before he can think much about it, he’s out like a light.
Their bodies aligned, clinging, the minutes drag on. The slick slide of tongues tasting, relishing. He could remain in this moment forever, but oxygen is, unfortunately, a necessity for life so eventually they’re forced to break away, chests heaving and faces pink.
Dean abruptly realizes his mouth is unbelievably dry and what he really wants to do right now is lick the remaining water from every inch—
Cas stay? Sure, he hated his job, that much was obvious. But he had friends there, right? A whole life back in Boston, and he left it behind.
He groans and runs his fingers through his hair, shoving the perpetually messy locks back from his forehead. “Gabriel, now is really not the time, I—”
“Yeah.” He leers anyway, sipping his beer slowly in the way he knows usually makes her hot under the collar. This is him being
So he sinks down again and again, lets muscle memory take over where the mental one's deficient and finds his rhythm as the increasing ache in his jaw and the unashamed pitiful noises Cas is making wash over him.
They’ve rocked the boat their share, but never anything more serious than tension relief. She’s older, experienced, and a real tiger in the sack, and he’d be lying if he said the memory alone didn’t pique his interest. Give him a break, it’s been
A fresh wave of exhaustion hits as he reaches the last set of stairs, so he pauses and leans against the wall, taking a heavy breath. It isn’t the tired one feels at the end of a hard day’s work, or after a long bout of exercise, but a weariness that settles into one’s bones and leaves a profound, empty ache within the heart, a hollow in the stomach no amount of food or drink can fill.
Leaving the Impala at Singer’s, the trio pile into Benny’s pickup and less than ten minutes later, they’re claiming a table at their usual haunt, more than ready to shed the exhaustion of the day with some cheap booze and good grub.
Cas hums and gives a short nod. “If you’re open to it, perhaps we could have some fun with that next time.”
The click of her heels on the freshly stained wood grows distant as she turns the corner toward the stairs to leave, and moments later, the bed sinks next to him. A cool, gentle hand presses to his forehead, and he hears Cas make a displeased noise in the back of his throat. Dean cracks his eyes open; they’re crusted at the corners, burn like hell, and all he can muster is a squint as he peeks out from the covers to see Cas’ furrowed brow above him.
The starry sky’s black as pitch above between the sparkling distant constellations, but Dean’s got all the light he needs from the ethereal silver-blue glow of the moon and sharp yellow glare of Baby’s headlights. Windows down, the only sound for miles chirping cicadas and rustling leaves, the aroma of petrichor and tar thick in the air, rock on the tape deck. This is all he needs, right here.
Smiling, big brown eyes warm and bright, she waves them over. “Dean, sugar,” she croons sweetly, “how you been?”
Cas’ hands, one holding Dean’s purple, blue, and pink plaid shirt and the other a hanger, fall to his lap. He’s staring still, but Dean’s too tired to care. “If I make you some tea, will you actually drink it?”
“Of course,” she croons, watching as they bend in opposite directions to wipe themselves off. “Nothing wrong with getting a little
Dean reaches behind himself, thumbing awkwardly at the flat, round base for the little button, and when it kicks on—
Gut-deep under the hood of a 2002 Toyota Corolla, Dean hums under his breath along to Styx pouring from his earbuds while he works. With spring approaching and the adrenaline of a busy afternoon flowing through him, he’s stripped the top half of his coveralls, leaving the sleeves tied around his waist.
Tuesday evening, July 20th, is stifling and humid due to record-high temps combined with heavy rain earlier in the day that, rather than cooling anything off or quickly drying in the sun, turned the entire goddamn town into a muggy swamp.
The memory of that purchase brings a smile to his face. They hadn’t intended to do so, but while perusing aisles for other things for the house, Castiel had thought of Dean’s abundant collection of coffee mugs and eclectic assortment of other hand-me-down, mismatched dishes, and stopped by the kitchenware section. Dean had a particular fondness for the square, black matte ceramic plates with thin strips of blue-green gradient along the edges. Handcrafted, the label declared. Not that Dean had said anything aloud, but Castiel noticed his gaze linger on them, so he grabbed those alongside a set of faux-crystal glasses in varying sizes.
The days that follow are equal parts awesome and frustrating. Awesome because he’s never been pampered like this a day in his life, and frustrating for… pretty much the same reason. Dean tries to convince Cas to leave or at least sleep on the couch so he doesn’t get sick, to no avail. Dude
“No. You moped till ya passed out and drooled on my bar—thanks, by the way—and I had to damn near carry you to my car, drag you home, and throw your pitiful behind into bed. That isn’t the same as
“Not all I do, no.” Dean shoots him a look over his shoulder. “Started out as a mechanic, but there’s not a ton of business for it in a small town like this. Only so many cars, you know, and I had to pay bills somehow. Got my contractor license and opened up a shop that does a lil’ bit of everything. First and only place like that in Eden.” Castiel doesn’t have to see his face to know he’s beaming with pride. “Cars, houses, crap like this. You name it. Basically, if it needs fixing, I’m your guy, and I've got a few locals hired on for the weirder stuff I can’t do myself. Before, people were stuck jerry-rigging things by themselves or hiring fancy, expensive companies from the city.”
The world becomes a blur of pleasure and harsh breaths as he plunges into that delicious heat, controlling his thrusts with firm grips on the man’s hair and hip. His own hair mats to his forehead and neck, sweat dripping down his brow into lust-hooded eyes and he wipes it away with the back of his forearm, fucking like it’s the end of the world, like tomorrow doesn’t exist, like all there is is this blessed moment. He’s determined to wring every last drop from it if it’s the last goddamn thing he ever does, because they have already come this far and the future brings uncertainty but the here and now? Pure bliss.
He takes a deep breath, puts his cup down, and pushes off the counter. Making his way toward the foyer, he smiles at the sight of Sam and Dean bickering beside a petite blonde with a sweet face and kind smile who he assumes is Jessica.
, and his hushed exhalation of “unless…” in the kitchen only half an hour prior. He opens his mouth to speak, to ask—
Castiel hands him his credit card and driver’s license, requesting to stay the week. The man slides over the sign-in sheet with a cheap blue Bic pen. Hunched over the counter, Castiel avoids his prying gaze, uncaps the pen, and begins filling out the short form.
It’s so brief, he almost doesn’t catch it, but Castiel lifts his beer to his lips at the same time his eyes float down Dean’s body. His heart speeds up, leg bouncing on the lower rail of the stool. On a whim, Dean thrusts out his hand. Meg robbed him of a proper introduction, so he’s gonna do it right, while she’s out of the way.
And really, who can blame Dean for watching Castiel’s ass until he turns the nearest corner? It’s that glorious, and absolutely worth any looks it earns him from passersby. Soon as Cas disappears from view, Dean glances around to make sure no one’s looking directly at him before subtly adjusting his inappropriate semi.
Dean’s eyes cast to the enormous flesh-toned phallus suctioned to the center of the tile floor and he coughs to mask a snort. “Uh, no. Why, what’s up?”
Standing, Cas pulls out his wallet and saunters toward the register, shoulders straight and posture broadcasting confidence definitely not there before. Dean swivels in his seat and follows, unable to wipe the arrogant smile from his face. He ignores Meg’s perceptive look and doesn’t bother checking his other friends' faces behind him as they exit the diner.
He keeps his eyes peeled for the Lincoln as his brain spins scenario after scenario, beginning with the mundane and devolving into the horrific. Thoughts like, maybe Cas has a cold, become maybe Cas got hurt, become maybe Cas is dead, and by the end of the week it takes all Dean’s willpower not to call all the hospitals and morgues and dig through the
?), each movement equal parts arousing and mesmerizing. He exudes graceful, elegant strength, looks for all the world like even the most difficult positions take little to no effort, and seems at peace in a way he hadn’t that first month as if a great burden has been lifted from his shoulders.
The man’s gaze isn’t lewd, nor are his words inappropriately suggestive. Rather, he seems genuinely intrigued. Appreciative, even. Castiel isn’t usually one to preen, but it’s difficult not to do so under such attention. And alright, perhaps a petty part of him also wants to see how Dean responds. He finds himself standing a little straighter as he steps forward to proffer his hand, matching the firmness of Benny’s returned grip. The other man’s grin widens. Either he’s impressed, or thrilled by the challenge, Castiel can’t tell.
Over Castiel’s shoulder, he sees Sam walking toward them and groans, “Fuck,” under his breath. He pulls his hand away, taking a step back from Cas just in time for his brother to clap him on the shoulder.
Even now, it’d offend and insult him coming from anyone else. But when Cas says this, it’s not pain he intends to inflict. It’s not rubbing salt in Dean’s wounds—it’s a salve. Cas means it with absolute sincerity. He says “beautiful” with a voice full of awe, pure adoration, and though it still feels a little weird hearing it like that Dean trusts Cas implicitly, knows he means it, knows it isn’t simply about his face or body (although Cas sure as shit appreciates them, made that clear enough with this awkward monologue on the golden ratio one time). When Cas calls Dean beautiful, he means all of him, inside and out. Makes him feel
Dean takes him down to Moseley’s Diner. It’s a cozy little place which bears some of the city’s best burgers courtesy of its owner, a sweet, stout older lady who’s known near every regular patron since they were knee-high, including Dean and his brother. Soon as they walk in, the tinkling bell above the door signaling their entry, Dean spots the woman herself standing behind the counter.
“What was your reason, then?” Dean asks out of the blue, eyes still on the screen under his fingers.
Aiming a satisfied smirk toward his brother in the shotgun seat, Dean says, “Worth it,” lips spreading even wider at the scowl that earns him. Sammy shakes his head, hair flopping down around his eyes.
Alone in the bunker, he allows his rough, slightly off-key voice to rise, echoing through empty kitchen as he covers the dough in plastic wrap, places it in the refrigerator, and washes his hands.
. Whatever. The important thing is, something about Cas intrigues him, and once he has his sights set, Dean’s a capital-D Dog with a bone(r).
Cas laughs. Dean realizes he’s never heard him laugh before, not like this—it’s higher-pitched than his normal voice, goofy and stuttered, just shy of a straight-up snort—and decides he loves the sound.
Still nursing his injury, he drags his bags into the building to check in. The place looks like it hasn't been redecorated since at least the 70s, with unpainted wood paneling on the walls, mid-century furnishings, and shag carpet. The front desk is eerily empty, but rock music pours from a radio beside the register.
Tina's is nothing at all like the bland, mass-produced corporate chains one sees all across the country, clones upon clones littering every other street corner. There's character in these walls, in the black-and-white checkered floors, red booths lining one wall, round Formica tables down the middle, and long stainless steel counter and vinyl-topped barstools. Maybe a common sight once upon a time, but decades later it fills him with a warm combination of foreign and familiar, much like he felt watching vintage films on Turner Classic Movies with Gabriel as children. A sense of better, more innocent times, though he is at least self-aware enough to recognize the idealistic naivete of that sentiment.
Cas is with Jack, Claire, and Kaia, clearing a vamp nest in southern Texas. Dean had already been halfway to Oregon following a lead with Donna when the call came in—
“No. I’m… I’ll be alright.” Cas lays down again, flat on his back, knees bent, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling as one hand sweeps the wet mass of hair back from his forehead. Dean props his head upon his hand, watching. It’s clear Cas is still shaken up; he can practically feel the melancholy and confusion emanating from the guy.
The lobby is dark when he leaves the room dressed in his running shorts. There’s still time while he waits for the attendant—Ash, he recalls—to inquire about the broken unit in his room, so he sets a leisurely pace down the sidewalk past shops whose lights have barely begun flickering on, limbs still feeling as awkward and lethargic as his brain.
“Well I mind!” he argues, arms folding over his chest to mimic the other man’s defensive posture. “You’re taking my bed.”
Today, Castiel plasters on a calm, solemn expression to mask his turmoil. Once again, Dean sees right through it.
His voice is rougher and smoother all at once. Dark and full of whiskey-coated gravel, each syllable slurring together but only just enough to hint at inebriation. Dean licks his lips, capturing the lingering sweetness from his last drink, and watches as Cas’ eyes follow his tongue.
“I get the feline seal of approval, awesome.” Dean glances up, eyes glistening. “She’s real pretty. Eyes like-like—” His face contorts, nose wrinkling and within seconds erupts with a massive, painfully loud sneeze, sending Claire scurrying between Castiel’s legs to hide beneath the bed with a sharp hiss. “Sorry!” Dean says, appearing genuinely contrite even as he rubs his nose against the back of his hand. “I’m uh, kind of allergic.”
Within minutes he's rocking down against his hand, nudging against his prostate on every third or fourth stroke, the head of his cock rubbing ruthlessly between his lower abdomen and lace with each shift of tense thighs,
He can smell the clean, spicy aroma of Dean’s soap blending with the salty tang and numerous other scents natural to the man. The leather and oil and wood that forever embeds itself in him and lingers upon everything he touches. Their sheets, Dean’s car. Everywhere Castiel goes now, he smells Dean, but this is the first time he’s ever had the privilege to get
” Dean sips his drink. Fiddles with the glass, voice choking on the memories. “He, um—he died after Sammy left for college. 'Bout eight years ago now.”
He cracks his eyes open at the vulnerable, yearning lilt to Cas’ voice, the hitch in his breath, and peers over to see those plush pink lips parting around his name, brilliant blue eyes glittering beneath the rays of moonlight shining through the windows, cheeks rosy around a growing smile and goddamn, in this moment, without a doubt, Castiel is the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen.
He jerks backward so violently he almost falls clear off the side of the bed before Cas’ arm shoots out, catches and reels him in (how the dorky guy’s got reflexes like that is beyond him but they just saved him from having a seriously sore ass, and not in the fun way, so he’s not about to question it).
“What? No—uh, Sam.” A peculiar flush darkens the apples of his cheeks, but he doesn’t appear to be lying. “It’s just a thing we”—he shakes his head, expression now somewhat fond—“nevermind. You ready to hit the road?”
Dean laughs. It’s a full-bodied thing, rumbling straight from his belly and shaking his shoulders. It’s such a lovely, warm, invigorating sound that Castiel wishes he could bottle it, make it a tangible thing, hold it close.
Meg’s eyes narrow, but she doesn’t argue, and Dean knows it’s 'cause she’s had them before (and he makes downright fantastic burgers). Regardless of their banter, they’ve known each other since high school, and all the teasing is more of an inside joke by now than any real bad blood between them.
, he finds himself slowly moving backward and his thighs hit the edge of the bed. He smiles triumphantly into Cas’ skin, mouths at the bolt of his stubbled jaw, down his throat, and when he’s met not with skin but a starched collar, he lets out a noise of frustration.
Cas doesn’t want Dean the way Dean wants Cas. He can’t want him, ‘cause Dean is fucking broken, unworthy of love,
,” Dean starts, tone strained by an affect of nonchalance Castiel doesn’t entirely buy. “Where’s your girlfriend?”
“How about you and me go get some grub, and then I’ll explain? A/C is good to go.” Dean pats his own stomach, still smiling. “It’s about lunchtime anyway.”
Cas doesn’t come close to the trashed hotel rooms of John Winchester’s past drunken tirades, the lazy teenage messes his sasquatch of a brother made, or Bobby’s tendency to horde every miscellaneous book, tool, piece of hardware, and appliance he got his hands on or every old rusted-out jalopy that came into the yard heedless of Dean and Ellen’s profuse complaints. So Dean bitching about such minor things makes him wonder if there’s another reason for his outburst.
Arms crossed, Bobby grunts, “Boyfriend’s here,” and jerks his head, indicating somewhere over his shoulder.
much. They’re lovely.” Dean hears rustling, the drag of a zipper below Cas’ breaths, and pictures Cas palming himself through his boxers to the image of Dean laid out and wanton like this, just for him. “I wish I were there right now.”
“Yeah.” He plops into the chair at his desk and takes a long pull from the beer. “Why? Where are you?”
Like in most of his recent fantasies, he sees Castiel beside him with perfect clarity. Not that he spends a ton of time staring at Cas or anything, memorizing each glorious feature (and if he does, well, nobody needs to know that but him). The perfect, straight patrician nose above plush, lightly chapped lips. The brilliant blue of his eyes, the way the lids slope gently at the corners when he squints. The way he smiles with them more than he does his mouth, which just makes Dean treasure the real grins that much more.
Just then, Claire comes sauntering out from behind Castiel. A confounding mixture of emotions oscillate over Dean’s face, too rapidly for him to comprehend before the man’s lips stretch into a broad grin. The sight tugs at something within Castiel, makes his heart skip a beat.
Strong, calloused fingers loosen the knot in his trapezius muscle before slowly drifting down to pick up the bar of soap. It’s all he can do to abstain, but the memory is still so bright, close enough he can almost touch it. Awkward and quiet one moment, yet confident and blunt the next. The owlish tilt of his head, so endearing Dean can hardly stand it. And that smile—God, that smile.
He doesn’t know what Michael knows, whether he’s been keeping tabs on him, is simply guessing, or prodding in the hopes of reopening an old wound, but this is taking it too far. Perhaps Dean played a part, Castiel is not dense enough to deny the truth of it. He wants to be with Dean in every way the man will allow him to be, even if it’s only as friends. But leaving his job, leaving that life behind, was a decision Castiel had wanted to make for a long time. It had just never occurred to him before that he
“They’ve treated me better in the few weeks I’ve been here than you have in the last thirty-four years!”
“I’m fine, baby. Busy.” She glances between him and Cas. “Don’t be rude now, are you gonna introduce me to your friend?”
Bobby occupies the passenger seat. He hides his grin so well under that beard, but Dean sees it all the same. He grins back, wide and bright, and turns the stereo up. Zeppelin—his favorite.
“Uh-huh. You gonna introduce me to Castiel now or what? I won’t feel comfortable with this till I get a read on him myself.”
He stares dully as the other man putters shamelessly about, making himself comfortable, and ignores the alarm bells going off in his brain. It’s unfathomable that this dude sits in an office five days a week because he looks like a wet dream come true; miles of tanned skin, toned muscles, runner’s thighs that could crush watermelons.
Dean pauses and turns his head, both hands on the wall to keep the Zeppelin poster flat. A sharp pain shoots him between the eyes at the movement and he winces hard, gritting his teeth against it.
on his right flank and into the sparse trail of hair leading from his navel to below the towel’s edge.
Dean looks over again and does a double-take. He’d know that face anywhere. Heart-shaped, framed by thick, dark curls. Cassie’s brown doe eyes turn on him, filled with frustration, maybe regret. They’d dated for a couple weeks their senior year of high school and split not long before he dropped out. She graduated and moved away. Last he heard, she was a journalist down in Chicago or some shit. But here beside him, she looks just the same as he remembers.
Grimacing, he chokes out, “Please, please, I am begging you. Jo, too. Don’t breathe a word of that to Cas.”
Dean rolls toward the nightstand on his side of the bed and flings open the drawer, fishing out the lube. He knows exactly which toys he wants tonight, too, so he sets the vibrating plug and his favorite dildo by the pillows. They’ve got nothing on Cas because ain’t no way cool silicone can match the silken skin of Cas’ cock, the throbbing heat of it that makes him feel so alive, or how Cas puts it to such masterful use. But using them knowing Cas is listening? Getting off to it right along with him? Fuck yeah, they’ll do just fine.
On the second floor, he finds a large open sitting room with more plastic-covered furniture and three windows overlooking the back of the property. Curious, he glances through them and sucks in a breath. The remains of a beautiful garden lie below, on the other side of the deck. He can almost picture himself back there, tending to flowers, watching the bees and hummingbirds flitting about. Drinking coffee during peaceful spring mornings or lounging on the deck in the evenings with a glass of bourbon. And upstairs where he stands, with the glorious view and so much natural light, he sees himself doing yoga, or reading, during the winter.
needs that drink now. If nothing more than to slow this train of thought, or better yet, shut it down entirely.
He tells Dean what he’s done in slurred, garbled words, or at least he tries. He's in that between place, sorta floating and sinking at once, sobbing numbly as he talks with snot running down, catching at the edge of his lip. Probably looks like a disgusting mess, but Dean just listens, expression patient and sympathetic. Then Castiel says he’s made the choice to stay, and
“Cas. Don’t say that.” Dean lays his hand atop Castiel’s, and quiets until Castiel looks at him again. Concern draws Dean’s lips into a thin line and burrows into the corners of his softening gaze. “Look, I’m not good at uh, feelings and shit. But it is important.
Quickly noting that all the tables are full, with only two seats at the counter remaining empty, Castiel fidgets, rocking from foot to foot. He isn’t too keen on crowds on the best of days, though in the city he’s learned to suffer through it. Something about knowing everyone's a stranger to everyone else somehow makes it easier—being the
“Nnngg… no... hospital,” Dean slurs into his friend's shoulder. His head throbs, he can't catch his breath.
But the way Dean looked at him earlier this evening... no one has looked at Castiel with that sort of open, absolute
“Yes.” Cas fidgets a little, shifting on his feet. Their arms brush together and Cas moves away, but rather than the abrupt abandonment of their conversation he typically pulls, he turns and faces Dean fully. “I’m finishing my Masters.”
There’s no Apocalypse on the horizon, no more Big Bads. For the first time in Dean’s life, he can actually see retirement on the horizon and it doesn’t feel like an empty promise.
Castiel exits the car and jogs to the porch, treads gingerly up each step, testing his weight. They hold; it seems the wood is still in good condition, but the windows are dirty and difficult to see through, and the hinges on the front door are rusty and stiff. It takes a few shoves to get it to open.
Unfortunately, Sam’s not taking it near as well as the others. He huffs, “But you just met him, Dean. You don’t know the first thing about the guy! What if he’s a wack job, or a pervert? What if—”
). Rather than behind the register this morning, Cas is fumbling with the door where they store cases of beer that don’t fit in the refrigerated shelves, arms full.
until it snaps and with a sharp, stuttered grunt he comes down Cas’ throat, painting hot white stripes across the ceramic beneath his feet.
want to know the truth?” says a different, equally familiar voice. He winces hard, grimacing. Panic bubbles up in his chest.
Ash now sits in a chair behind the front desk with a giant Monster Energy can beside his forearm, his mop of hair unruly from the early hour, wearing nearly the same attire as the day before but with a different vest. He’s zoned out pecking away at the keyboard of a strange-looking laptop, the wiring visible through its clear shell, but looks up briefly and waves when Castiel approaches.
Stick him in a dark alley with a badge in his pocket, cigarette hangin' from his lips beneath the brim of a deerstalker though? Yeah, he could pull off the former no problem. Suits him, somehow.
A week after that unholy revelation, Dean watches Cas button his shirt in the floor-length mirror they bought for the bedroom, gnawing the inside of his cheek raw because even though Cas insists it’s not a date, an invitation for dinner at Meg’s place,
Instead, Castiel lifts his knee, planting the foot closest to Dean against the mattress in a weak effort to block the little bit of chub he’s sporting from Dean’s view (which is remarkably difficult to do in thin cotton pajamas, by the way). He twists to grab his own beer from the nightstand on his side, left arm reaching across his body. Cool air hits the skin of his exposed hip where the shirt rides up, but with his stifling internal humidity, it comes as a relief more than a bother. He flops back and guzzles the neck, releasing a long sigh as the refreshing liquid washes through him, and attempts resolutely to focus on the TV, let the alcohol work its magic.
Blue-Eyes immediately pulls away from him (to Dean's mixed disappointment and relief) and straightens up, smoothing long, tan fingers down his front. He has dark brown hair, all mussed like he just rolled out of bed and Dean can’t help thinking it’s sexy as hell. Nearly as tall as Dean, broad-shouldered, and about the same age, if not a little older. Can’t tell much else, covered as he is, but he looks fit—not that he’s ogling the guy or anything.
Rufus tells him that Cas had put in his two weeks not long ago with the explanation that he’d recently graduated and had a few jobs lined up he would be busy interviewing for, so he wouldn’t have the time to come in anymore.
he tells her, knowing full well he should question his damn sanity if he’s holding conversations in his mind.
watch the bob of his Adam's apple as he swallows with a small, satisfied smile. He also does not lick his own lips, wondering what the skin of Cas’ throat would feel like against them. Then Cas picks up his burger, eyeing the thing like he hasn’t eaten in a year, and takes a bite.
someone roll their eyes? 'Cause if so, he's pretty sure Cas did just that. Fuck, Dean's an idiot for this guy.
“Don’t be a fool, Castiel. You’re setting yourself up for disappointment and rejection, and if you go down this road, I will not be there to catch you when you inevitably fall again.”
Even fresh from a shower, the combined scents of oil and metal linger on the man’s skin—evidence of his profession—but they aren’t unpleasant. Above that, he detects leather from Baby’s seats, the crisp notes of Dean’s soap, and the heavier wood, musk, and sweet spice of cologne. God, he smells divine; like rich, finely aged bourbon and apple pie savored around a balmy, crackling fireplace on a cold winter’s night. He inhales deeply, gently nuzzling at the hinge of Dean’s jaw.
“Off,” he grunts, hands moving down to fumble with the buttons. Cas chuckles but abides, leaning back just far enough to assist till Dean can shove it from his shoulders. It pools on the floor at their feet, followed shortly after by the undershirt, where he hopes the rest of their clothes will soon join.
Cas appears seemingly from nowhere, hooks his arms beneath Dean’s, and heaves him up, holding him close to his chest. “That’s it, I’m taking you to the hospital.”
He gives in to the feeling and wraps his hand around Cas’. It's broad and warm in his, grounding. Perfect.
Dean’s coffee machine at home rarely sees use—partly because it’s old as balls and more jittery than a chihuahua in winter—and partly because the garage is right next to the Gas-N-Sip, so he never has far to go for blessed caffeine. That’s always his first stop, and that’s where he’s heading now, his shadow stretching across the pavement under a steadily rising sun.
Dean laughs. "Meg's dad ran this place before he retired. Apparently, old man Masters had a thing for this stripper. So he named the diner after her, and the sign out front? Yeah, looks just like her, or so he says."
“Gabe, he sounds like a good guy. But your dad, and Michael? All those other assholes back there? They don’t deserve you.” Castiel chokes back a sob, face pressed into Dean’s neck. “Maybe this is your chance to do things differently. To have a fresh start, a new life. I know we haven’t known each other long, man, but you’re...” he pauses, takes a breath. “You're like family to me, Cas. I just… want you to know that. You’re not alone.”
Dean’s eyes dart so quickly back to the road that Castiel can’t tell if he’s serious or joking. He has no clue how to respond, and as the conversation lapses and stilted silence grows, that uncertainty has him pulling his coat closer around himself like a flimsy shield. Now feeling for all the world like a bedraggled wet cat, Castiel turns to stare out of the window, unblinking as trees and fields flicker by until his vision blurs.
It doesn’t make any sense. Maybe it doesn’t need to. Exhilarating and terrifying, it fills him from the inside, hot and bright as the birth of a star, spreading outward through his limbs until every inch of him vibrates, glows, with the force of it. Castiel can’t pull away from Dean, and doesn’t want to. Not ever.
Cas says nothing, just stares in a way that’s become oddly familiar to Dean even in the brief time since he’s met him. Doesn’t take long before Dean’s getting nervous. Not a bad nervous per se, more a “these butterflies need to cool their shit” nervous because suddenly the pie and alcohol aren’t the only things dancing in his stomach.
Hopefully, Cas has had enough time to cool off and will be more agreeable to his decision, because if he's being technical here, he’s not totally sure if the “fine” he got out of Cas earlier was about the bed situation or the promise of food. With that in mind and the vague demand for drinks, he brought whiskey and a six-pack of Margiekugels to placate him.
And if he gets a silent thrill from the position they’re in, Cas with his wrinkled suit and crooked tie, with that ruffled, messy hair, standing between his legs so close he can just about feel that angelic warmth emanating from his body, the urge to grab his hand and pull him closer building by the second, well that’s his damn business.
of his heartbeat. Castiel's arm drops and hangs limply at his side as he absentmindedly thumbs the screen, ending the call.
Dean wants to look away but finds he can’t, pinned here by both Cas’ body and the wild intensity of his eyes. He almost laughs, because
“I wanted to surprise you,” Cas mumbles shyly. He glances over his shoulder, gesturing with his chin, and Dean’s eyes follow only to widen because there, on top of the stove, sits a pie. Straight out of a magazine with perfectly crimped edges, flaky, golden, egg-washed crust, and one lone candle placed neatly in its center.
Everyone knows something is up, but no one says anything. At least not to him directly, but he hears the whispers and ignores them.
Dean hums noncommittally, pausing to sit on the edge of the bed beside Castiel’s chair. “I want to make you an offer.”
“It’s nice like this. Listening to it, watching the way it changes and shapes the world outside, from the safety of shelter. Especially here, with you.”
He closes his eyes, allowing the white noise to coax him to sleep once more, and that’s when he hears—
When he next wakes, there are multiple people speaking, but the duvet tucked in close under his chin is warm and everything outside of it is freezing and sucks ass so he burrows deeper, shivering violently, body feeling clammy and disgusting. A miserable moan escapes when another bolt of pain lances through his head just from that tiny bit of effort.
Dean holds a hand up, cutting him off. “Nope. Coming here was my idea, so it's my treat. House rules.”
“Plus”—Dean claps his hands and rubs them together excitedly—“anything goes sideways and I’ve got a hotshot lawyer in the family to back me up!”
There's no Chuck or world-ending prophecies. No destiny, or “chosen one” bullshit. Unfortunately, the things that go bump in the night didn’t up and vanish, but there’s a whole new generation of hunters to help keep ‘em at bay.
“So, Cas. You never did tell me why you came to Eden,” Dean says, peering up at him through impossibly long lashes.
understatement. He’s never been one for surprises, but this—oh, fuck, this is better than that skunky, beautiful kush Rowena gifted him for his nineteenth birthday, better than the greasiest, most artery-clogging burger he’s ever had, better than
He shakes it off, resisting the part of him that floods with shame at knowing even from afar, and after all these years, his brother still gets to him. He can visualize Michael’s steely eyes, his hard, unforgiving face. Can feel the disappointment rolling off him in waves, and he’s not even in the damn room. Castiel shudders.
“Not really.” He chuckles, but the sound lacks his usual sincerity and his shoulders are stiff, as are his movements. “I’m just your average Joe, nothing special. What I do have, though, is a GED and a ‘give ‘em hell’ attitude. It ain’t much, but it’s gotten me this far.”
“Y-yeah,” he whispers softly and begins fumbling at the button of his fly with trembling fingers, the phone jammed between his ear and shoulder. His knuckles brush against his slowly filling cock and a pleasurable shudder rushes through him, heady and enticing.
Being sick is the literal worst, and Cas is a real pain in the ass—strict as a schoolmarm and just as scary—but even Dean has to admit, everything else is pretty nice.
There's a fantasy already prepared in his mind, one he’d been too drunk last night to act on. Unsurprising, really, because it’s been a while since he’s been with anyone and, like ships passing in the night, Cas is a mystery, an unknown element amidst the familiarity and routine of Dean’s life. Fascinating because he’s new, different, and unbelievably sexy—nothing more—because he can’t be more, can he? He’s unavailable, he’s gone, Dean will never see him again (and fuck that shouldn’t hurt so much but it does, oh how it hurts).
“That’s awesome, man! My brother Sam goes there too, maybe you’ve met him. Big sasquatch of a guy, hair like he’s the lost Partridge sibling?”
Anxiety nags at the back of his mind. There’s this dark feeling that takes over him when they part in the morning, as though a lifetime of separation waits beyond the front door regardless of how much they text. His heart aches with the knowledge that one of these days, once his eight hours are up and he comes home, it’s gonna be to an empty house, Cas and Claire packed up and gone. (Yeah, he’ll even miss the
With all the resources at their disposal, Sam taking point on training and research, Amara getting Heaven back in order, and Rowena downstairs whipping Hell into shape, they’re leagues away from where they started the day Dean snuck into Sam’s apartment with, “Dad went on a hunting trip and hasn’t been home in a few days,” on his lips and fear in his heart.
. And here Cas was, wasting his evening with him instead. Some washed up nobody and complete stranger.
Dean nuzzles the crease of Cas’ thigh, inhaling the heady scent of him. Crisp, clean, yet earthy and musky in a way that burrows into his memory, making a permanent home. He wants to wrap himself in it like a fucking
His eyes widen. For whatever reason, the idea hadn’t crossed his mind. While he knows Dean is likely the best candidate to do so in all of Eden, and he’d been eagerly (and anxiously) anticipating a mysterious reveal throughout their time at Tina’s, it still shocks him. A “yes” forms readily on the tip of his tongue but he bites it back. He must be logical about this, strategic. Gather the facts.
Dean is no more patient than he, fingers still cold from outside running through Castiel’s hair, across his shoulders, down his chest and back again as though he can’t make up his mind what he wants to touch, returning each kiss like a man starved, like Castiel is his favorite flavor and he can't get enough. The rest of the world falls away as they map out each others’ mouths, the texture and shape of them and the perfect way they meld together like a key finding its lock.
He looks different, yet so much the same, wearing an ill-fitting suit and crooked tie beneath a rumpled beige trenchcoat. His hair is windswept, a bit longer than before, and the circles under his eyes are darker than Dean remembers, the eyes themselves tired. Perhaps even forlorn.
“Anyone without my ability to read people can see what’s between you two. But yeah, you could say that.”
. Yeah, he's way outta practice, but Cas is heavy and bitter on his tongue, and the subtle tremor of Cas' thighs, his hands where they linger on Dean's shoulders, all of it makes him yearn to take the man apart piece by blessed piece.
A silent minute passes. Something twists within him, a flicker of uncertainty. “Was…” He hesitates, glancing at Dean. “Was that alright?” Sure, he’s never had complaints from past partners, but this… this is different. It means more.
Cas heaves a sigh. “If I leave early in the morning, I can make it back to the bunker by 6:30 or 7 p.m. tomorrow.” He pauses. Then his voice drops even lower. Tinny though it is through the phone, it’s a familiar tone, one that brooks no arguments and compels Dean to listen, to
Whether because he wasn’t ready to or because those pieces never belonged to her to begin with, he’ll never know. Looking back, he’s surprised they lasted as long as they did.
He steps closer to lay a hand on Dean’s shoulder. Less to comfort Dean, and more to assure himself that Dean is safe, secure, on the ground with him. He squeezes and their eyes meet. It’d be elementary, so easy to take that final step, close the scant gap between them and feel Dean’s body pressed against him. Warm and solid, strong. There’s a second when he catches Dean’s tongue wetting his bottom lip, his gaze darting from Castiel’s eyes down to his mouth. He’s reminded of the man’s roaming, curious hands, how good it felt simply to be
Castiel stares, bewildered. He’d never heard anyone call his father that before. His brother would probably joke that no one who had “ lived to tell the tale” or some such nonsense. Perhaps it was his attempt to put distance between himself and his small-town roots.
He starts drinking—less at Harvelle’s, and more at his apartment, alone. Gets lazy about shaving. Sleeps through most of his days off. Loses six pounds. A mess of empty cans, mugs, and takeout containers pile up on his coffee table, the kitchen counters, a shelf or two.
But Cas tugs him back by the hair, his cock bobbing free, slippery-wet and pulsing inches from Dean’s swollen lips. A whimper slips out against his will, but he doesn’t get a chance to complain or beg for more (God, when did he get so fucking needy?) because within seconds Cas is pushing at his shoulder and climbing onto his lap, their overheated bodies finally meeting with the full, glorious skin-to-skin contact Dean’s been dreaming of for what feels like a lifetime now.
His phone abruptly shudders toward the corner of his desk, an obnoxious disco song reverberating off the stark white office walls. The unique ringtone Gabriel had set for his contact ID just to bug him, but Castiel never bothered or cared enough to change. Just as the phone slips from the wood surface and careens to the beige carpet beneath his feet, his hand shoots out and catches it mid-air.
