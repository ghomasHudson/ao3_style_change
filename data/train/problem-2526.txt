"Why would I need a whole body?"
It was a ridiculous...what even was the opposite of a mating dance? Someone had to step in, though, because if they waited for the girl to pick up on body language and unspoken clues they’d be here until the end of the world. Or at the very least until she sobered up, and Sherlock wasn’t sure which would come first. “How much money did you exactly owe to Miss Cecchini?” he asked. In English, since she was boosting her knowledge of it.
to save me.”
“We’ll be as quick as we can…and it’ll go much faster if you don't try to hide anything. We’re not trying to harass you,” she said.
They trailed out and, finally, climbed the stairs to the ‘proper’ museum floor. John wasn’t surprised to see the ticket checker fondly smile at Livia. But he was shocked when the man singled out with a glare not Alex, who was loudly complaining about having to buy a ticket in the first place, but Sherlock. What the heck? John was ready to come to the forefront of their group and give the idiot a piece of his mind, when a hand curling around his wrist stopped him. He turned towards his friend, and surprisingly flinty eyes warned him that it wasn’t the moment for a scene. In fact, when it was their turn, Sherlock was extremely polite to the asshole…until the transaction ended. Passing him, he rumbled, “He’d benefit from worrying more about his own failings….and their own hazards. Unsafe sex—especially when remunerated—is dangerous.”
Finally slowing down, Sherlock allowed himself to observe the place. Typical of his brother, finding a museum that once was a Duke’s palace. Sherlock wandered through the halls, with their half-faded frescoes and painstakingly engraved doors, and wondered if Mycroft was planning to eventually take over the director’s job. It would definitely be in his style…and having him a few hundred miles away might actually make him more tolerable.
“This is highly” the lawyer started, but before he could get “irregular” (or any synonym for insane) out, Sherlock was already leaving, and they all had to do their best to catch up with him.
John looked chastened—or maybe pretended to?—but Sherlock refused to indulge her. “If you’re done, we can proceed with our enquiry. I was about to leave on my own. We can't cater to people's feelings until our trail goes cold.”
John kept staring at his phone. When should he text Sherlock? How soon was too soon? His military past had taught him not to linger too long, giving the enemy the time to reorganise. He shouldn't let his new acquaintance alone long enough to ponder all his gaffes and persuade himself that John wasn't even worth wasting fifteen minutes on. Assuming he hadn't been pranked all along. He still couldn’t believe that any sane person would call their baby Sherlock Holmes.
“Any suggestions?” the doctor asked, turning to Gemma. It was an obvious move, but, the journalist would rather ignore the presence of Ball And Chain (his personal nickname for their guardian).
“Let’s start with her flatmate. She would have all she needs to make herself presentable after her murder in the first place. And if college taught me anything, it's that flatmates and dorm mates often want to murder each other. Maybe this one actually went through with it,” Sherlock replied, sitting shotgun in Gemma's car. She would have a hard time maintaining the right facade with her colleagues this way.
“He’s not obvious, for one thing. People’s reactions are terribly predictable, but—he apologised. For hurting my feelings with a Sherlock quip. Not even exactly hurting, he wasn’t spiteful, and if I hadn’t heard those jokes for two decades straight, I wouldn’t have minded. He should have been demanding I apologise to him instead, not joking.” Sherlock sat down himself…on his brother’s desk, rather than the chair.
“I hope that you won’t mind if I take my leave now...crime scenes are not my idea of an entertaining afternoon,” Mycroft said.
“No, we don’t know,” Sherlock replied. Why would she think that they needed even the illusion of not being involved in a murder investigation at the moment? He never dealt in make believe. He’d be writing fiction instead of scientific articles, if he were so inclined.
“Sherlock Holmes,” the journalist said. At her glare, he added, “It might surprise your relative less than you fear. Since you do have a point, though, John is going by Wilbur. Wilbur Bell.”
Gemma sighed deeply. “The power of love!”
“If God was merciful, there would be none.”
He’d gone to check what happened, thinking maybe he could help. The flat’s door was wide open, and Livia’s body lay twisted across the hall’s floor, enough blood splatters around her to be sure his services as a doctor weren’t going to be required. A few policemen were flittering around, taking samples and photos. They yelled at him, asking—he assumed—his name and intent. Shit didn't really hit the fan, though, until the Professor himself appeared. The man noticed him before the body, and greeted him—with a different name than the one he’d just given to the police.
"What do I always ask, Sherlock? Walk me through it. You can't just jump to conclusions. Especially when my heart is on the line."
As expected, Cecchini dropped his watchdog attitude, stepping back from the threshold to allow them in. The others (except Sherlock) threw themselves into mumbled apologies, until a stern look shut them all up.
“Rooms? In different directions? Does it mean you’re not...” Gemma looked from the one to the other, as if she couldn’t conceive that the two of them lived separately.
Well, the best lies have some truth in them. Without any time to concoct an elaborate excuse, sticking to the truth will also help. "Would you believe people expect me and Moriarty to have compatible kinks?"
“Down, girl. You won't have the future in fashion that you aspire to, if you can’t even figure out when people need space to breathe,” Sherlock snapped, taking a step back.
John blinked. He'd met a lot of quirky people, but none who read him like an actual book. With no idea of how to react, he defaulted to irony. "Misha said Holmes, didn't he? Would your first name be Sherlock, by any chance?"
Now, John didn’t understand Italian, but he didn’t need a language course to figure out he was being asked “Where to?” And also suspect that her apparent dull attitude before was a result of not being able to ask, “What have you taken today, mate?”
Sherlock knew this was a bad idea. They'd probably fall into the Thames and then...then again, that might shock the hallucination out of their systems. Not pleasant, but there were worse options. The Colonel (assuming it was him, and present) walked right to them and then past, without attempting to even touch them, John's gun following him but no attempt to tackle him made. Probably his beloved had figured that leaving a contaminated atmosphere would be best for everyone, too.
It was still a pity, though. It was a pity, but there was nothing to be done about it. Maybe tomorrow would bring something more interesting.
He’d been the butt of too many jokes to miss one when he saw it, though even the cruellest of his classmates would at least try for some plausibility in their traps. This one was so blatantly fake that it could almost be true. Still, it was best to get away from the situation before the other shoe dropped. After all, did it matter whether that meant ‘John Watson’ confessing that his name was George Smith, or John Watson realising that Sherlock Holmes was, indeed, intolerable?
John considered disabusing her, but it was too funny to see Sherlock take another step back, as if scared. In fact, if the man wasn’t careful he would end falling down the stairs!
But there
Gemma’s mouth snapped closed, widening into a smile as she led them through the hospital, The pathologist, a forty-something, lanky man, jumped when they entered.
“Us?” the pathologist narrowed his eyes at them both. “Teo already came round to ask...and I have never met your companions. Why aren’t they in uniform, anyway?”
"Stop caring about other people's arses," Sherlock groused.
Sherlock grinned. He would undoubtedly boast later that not everyone needed to be ‘coddled’. “When was the last time you saw Livia Cecchini?” he asked.
“She didn’t,” John replied, voice completely devoid of inflection.
Sherlock wanted to still be furious. But it was hard to do when you were snickering. S–
John opened his mouth, then closed it. Whatever objection he’d had, he’d quashed it. “Thanks,” he said instead. “So? What happens now?” he asked, once they were out of the restaurant. “I mean, how long do you need to follow us? If we’re to be under continuous surveillance, shouldn’t you get someone to relieve you? Or do you get paid for the overtime?”
The former soldier feared for a moment that his attempt to help had caused more damage than his friend could ever do on his own, but Gemma just sped up to keep pace and cooed, “Ooh, clay for bricks, right?”
If he had, it wasn’t something that required immediate intervention, as they moved to the loo. Sherlock on cat feet, while John tried to tiptoe around, just like when he’d come home much later than his parents’ curfew. Once again, the detective started rummaging around, scouring through the laundry basket, peering in the shower—for oddly placed and hence ignored bloodstains, John assumed—and opening drawers. He also checked what looked like the level of their host’s nick stick… Did he think that the murderer might have left some of their own blood in the victims flat, maybe by grabbing the knife without looking? Analysing it all would take ages.
"Wait, wait," John huffed, when he had a second's pause from trying not to land arse first on the floor. "I didn't mean to hurt you."
“Nope,” the journalist replied, popping the p.
“Gemma. I mean, agent Berti if you want to be formal, but it seems odd to be formal when the situation is so fantastical. I mean, unusual. I mean…”
John thought that they looked like ducklings trotting after an especially aloof and shiny-feathered one. He giggled, ignoring the dirty look the lawyer sent his way. Instead, once he had his breath back, he asked the cop—who ‘d fallen in step with him—”Sorry I didn’t ask before, but...since we’re going to be together for a while, what’s your name?”
Sherlock did his best to ignore their guardian, since she was useless as far as investigating went anyway. He’d already noticed three details that should have told the police that no, John wasn’t involved at all. Technically, there were seven, but he’d seen these people. He couldn’t assume that they’d notice the subtler signs, the same way you didn’t expect a first year student to pull off Paganini.
“Have I ever? I could explain to you,
Sherlock glared at his phone. He had suggestions alright. S–
Finally grasping his precious ticket, he followed her directions, using few English words but plenty of theatrical gestures. Even if they’d managed to misunderstand each other once again, there was about a dozen twenty-something boys and girls. In his research, the night before, he’d noticed that Urbino had an university. He hoped they were going there, too, or at least, that one of them would speak better English.
It didn’t take long for Mitch to find John Watson’s number. “I don’t know who you’re trying to conceal, but given the fact that you refused to change your name, the effort is quite poor. Anybody will guess that’s a fake,” he huffed.
“Sherlock? Are you there? Sherlock?” The words became louder and louder. “Sherlock! You might have dialled by mistake.”
His grudge melted when she started acting like a proper tour guide instead. It was hard to stay angry when everyone huddled together, and she whispered—in English, for their sakes—a brief highlight of the art in front of them, as well as the rooms they walked in. Especially since she peppered it with maybe not strictly historical but certainly funny, and sometimes even saucy, anecdotes, and some of the others excitedly interjected with more details. Almost every time, Sergio or Bea. And yes, the art was brilliant, too, of course, even if most of it was religious in nature. How many saints' and Virgin Mary portrayals could a country really need?
“I would have been more than happy to leave you alone for the whole duration of our stay and then some. Pity that John Watson doesn’t agree. What. Are. You. Trying. To. Do.” Sherlock glared at him.
“Oooh, you’re quoting the man himself, this is serious. No, I honestly have no idea what you’re talking about. What couldn’t wait an hour or two?” the older man replied. Of course, his voice was perfectly modulated to allow them privacy. Damn.
“I’m afraid we can’t,” Gemma said, “not if we can’t trust you to be honest with us.”
John suppressed a groan. Okay, it was a stupid joke, but how had he managed to earn such hatred in five minutes?
“You might be interested in conversation, figuring out people’s character and such. I prefer to examine the evidence, which is more likely to be destroyed with every passing hour. I trusted that the flatmates’ presence would hinder his attempts to get rid of every clue, so I conducted a quick search for anything of importance.”
“Second door on the left in the corridor.” Their host shrugged, pointing to the door behind him.
Oh. He hadn’t considered that. Stupid him. Sherlock flushed brightly; he should have known better. That was what he got for concentrating on inorganic chemistry in his studies, and then writing about research that took months anyway. He thought that the pressing needs of catching a murderer would make people develop quicker methods of analysis. But when jail was on the line, accurate trumped speedy. As frustrating as that was, he couldn’t fault their mindset.
“Never better.” John grinned. “Never better.”
“You think you understand these better than I do?” Rachele snapped, turning to face him fully. Her friends frowned, the guests suddenly unwelcome. John bit his lips. Maybe this whole trip had been a bad idea. He should have been quieter. He should have…
Well, that was John’s cue. He came forward, announcing, “Doctor Bell. Wilbur Bell.” He didn’t even crack a grin. “I want to thank you for giving us this chance, Mister…”
“Well, if you say that your name is really Sherlock Holmes, why don’t you deduce it?” she snapped.
coward. “I’m here, There must have been some trouble with the connection.”
Thankfully, that quieted them down. As for John, nobody asked, but his favourite piece—in the area open to the public—wasn’t a painting at all, he discovered. As much as the Duke’s small study was breath-taking, with its feats of marquetry (he kept learning things today, and seriously, it looked as if he could have grabbed that sword—among the many things pictured there), he liked the alcove best. The colours were surprisingly fresh, and the idea of having one’s bed not in a vast stone cold room, but in a small wood enclosure, brilliantly decorated with fake marble and trees, so that lying in bed with your wife you’d feel as if in a lush garden… If you had way more money than you knew how to spend, this would have been a great idea.
"You're not serious." The journalist didn't stop, but he wasn't rushing anymore.
“Oh, I will.” There was total confidence in John’s voice. “Sweetie.”
“Honestly? This is all insane. I’m not sure there’s been anything right since I walked out of the door this morning. And yeah, they’ve proven that they’re petty enough to ask you to investigate and hinder you at the same time. But if we get accused of fucking up their scene, I’m not sure that’s much better.” John shrugged.
A way out. Of course, this was the truth. It had been a dreadful faux pas. He could just ignore his phone until John was bored and hung up. Maybe the disappointment would be just enough to make John see what he was. But no. Sherlock Holmes was hateful, true, but no coward. Fine, no
Soon, the reply came. J
Luca opened his arms in surrender, defeat in every line of his body, and said, “I’m already being as quick as I can.”
A quick survey of the supplies gave him an idea. First, he needed iron, but not in powder form. A few old drawing pins, still weakly stuck to the wall, would do perfectly. They'd held up a periodic table up to five years ago, it was obvious from the difference in photodegradation of the brown paint between them in comparison with the rest of the wall. He was helping the students, really, making sure they didn’t eventually fall into someone’s beaker and cause an unexpected reaction, or injure someone.
is not a fake name.” Finally, the man shook it. “Since we’ll be here for a whole week, I thought that I could steal my brother for a while, no matter how many details you need to sort through. It’s an important matter.”
Oh. John grinned reflexively. He liked their agent. Maybe they wouldn’t need to mount an international scandal. “Erm...I don’t speak nearly as much Italian as I’d like. If someone could translate the pathologist’s words for me, it’d be lovely.”
“Nope,” John replied, popping the p. “I was just lucky to find an affordable place. Actually, I’ve been having quite a bit of luck lately. I’m half afraid of when destiny will present the bill.” He chuckled.
“Yeah, and I’m Irene Adler!” huffed the one who’d been eager for it.
“Oh, well. If he loves art, and doesn’t mind me ranting about it, sure. But who is he?”
“Because it was easier than writing ‘hello, I’m Sherlock’s brother, he gave me this number and this is what you need to know’? I mean, how many Mycrofts do you think are out there?” John quipped.
The blond chuckled. “I should have guessed that. So, shall we?” He glanced at the phone he held loosely—as if his companion wouldn’t deduce that an app gave him directions— and pointed in front of him.
“Ooh yes yes yes. Sorry. Of course. We’re going in. Hold on, shouldn’t we wait to have someone send in the proper coveralls so we don’t contaminate it?”
Down the stairs, Mycroft finally rushed the few steps to catch up to his brother…and grasped his elbow. “Someone better be dead in the family…or someone will be very soon,” he hissed.
“Well, that’d be hard to do,” was Sherlock’s Parthian shot.
“Are you?” John shrugged. “No, seriously, it’s tragically not a nickname, or alias, or anything like that. At least from what I’ve been told.”
“That detail aside. I always think he’s the luckiest, you know. Wouldn’t you want to work into an actual Renaissance palace?”
Rushing back to the balcony without making a sound was a challenge, but John found himself beaming. They had timed it perfectly, as the agent exited onto the terrace no more than ten seconds later.
“Mr. Holmes, you’ve hired me. And then negotiated without my presence something that is beyond all customs, and which lends itself to at least three different objections from a legal standpoint. And now when I offer suggestions that should be obvious to anyone, you argue. Why am I needed, exactly?” the lawyer asked, stepping closer.
“Have you? Damn, you have more money than I expected. Staying next to the palace and all that,” Matteo quipped, green eyes glinting with a new respect.
rather ridiculous. Still willing to let me pick?”
Gemma shrugged. “Off we go, then. But God knows I’m tempted to stop to buy a child leash before we go back to our last suspect.”
Despite supposedly being at work—he figured that negotiating the loan of a Raffaello, even an early work, required the amount of parley normally dedicated to avoiding conflict between small nations—his brother found the time to text him. While being a smug smart aleck, too.
There was no harm in telling him, was there? It wouldn’t make John any closer. S
“Perfect, thank you. That helps a lot. Now, as far as you know, was there anyone who hated her, envied her, or otherwise wished her ill?”
All he could say was that it looked messy. Then again, what college boy’s room didn’t, especially during exam time? Sure, there were stains in a rainbow of colours, on almost everything: old clothes (including the ones he’d been wearing at the museum), the floor and the desk, too. None jumped out at him as blood, though, and God knew that he’d seen blood, old and new, sprayed on an array of things during his service. Of course, he couldn’t be completely sure without a test, as Sergio’s art used plenty of red tones. As it stood, he was ready to shrug and move on...unless Sherlock saw something much more damning, while John was busy gaping.
“Yes, I have. But I’ve also lived with you for the last twenty-three years. You can’t have changed that much in the last two. If you were simply annoyed, you wouldn’t come for help. You’d just verbally skewer the poor man to pieces, and if he still didn’t back down, you have the ability to make him regret ever coming after you. If you’re planning nothing short of emigration, it’s because you don’t trust yourself to actually refuse. So now you’re going to tell me how fascinating this doctor of yours is. In detail.” Mitch grinned.
my Watson.” Sherlock kicked the chair. “But if you want one important reason he shouldn’t be anywhere near me… Here’s one that you really shouldn’t need to have explained. He was an
Livia put a conciliatory hand on her friend’s arm, “Let’s go on. There isn’t anything else to see, and, as you said, the symbolism is quite clear.”
“If you want the murderer to be caught, I need you to tell me three things about your flatmate. I’d add honestly, but I’ll realise if you’ll lie anyway.”
“No, I suppose not. It’s just....I didn’t know that. You look—” the agent’s voice trailed off, and she shuffled, looking unsure of the direction she would take herself.
As heart-warming as that was, it was just one more detail that made him wary. John Watson, finding Sherlock Holmes and appreciating his brasher side? It just wasn’t true. A prank. It had to be a prank. But his brother’s? The universe’s? John’s nonchalant attitude towards their matching names only made the situation more suspicious.
A.N. I know, I know, 'soon' this time... but I'm trying to go back to some sort of regular track. Even if it'll probably take me another week or two. I'm a mess, I know.
This time, they were going to catch the man. Together. John was at his back, carrying the gun, just in case. Should their enemy turn out to actually have some military training, his blogger/captain/lover was the best card Sherlock could ever dream of playing.
Not that John was complaining. A cab brought him from the airport to the station, a train would carry him to Pesaro, and there he could catch a bus to Urbino. There was, technically, a direct bus Ancona—Urbino, but only one a day, and he didn’t feel like spending a day in the city. Not with his goal so tantalizingly close, and time short. Seriously, it was one hour and a half…why wouldn’t there be more buses?
“Oh please. Give me some credit. If I wanted to ruin your life, I’d find a much more elegant way.”
“Sure.” The journalist could swear he’d felt the other’s shrug.
He kept quiet, simply enjoying the company of the friend (and future darling, if he had his way) at his side. At the museum, they bought their tickets (to the
Sherlock bit his lower lip. It was good to have it acknowledged—he
Sherlock sighed softly. He’d have loved to consider it a purposeful obstruction of the investigation, but that was unlikely.
“What?” Gemma looked as if she had no idea what he was talking about. Good God, first day on the job?
“Of course. The commissioner should have known better than to try to use me for her tricks! We’re going to solve this case whether she likes it or not. Honestly, that she thought I would automatically be a hindrance to any investigation is an insult that I won’t forget,” Gemma growled.
“Anyone who manages to throw themselves in has gone to so much effort that they probably did it out of sheer spite for the misapplied warning,” the journalist huffed, glaring at the plastic reinforcing and heightening its walls as if it personally offended him.
Sherlock's translation alarmed the former soldier; something had to be done, before their pathologist lost his last marble and ruined their case. “Please, tell him that we’ve all been overworked and under pressure to perform. We’re here to help. We’ll get the murderer. He just needs to take a deep breath and do his job.”
At least the most obvious of his deductions was confirmed. “If you haven’t met, why would he reach out to you?” There were no obvious tells of lying, but why would Mycroft lure someone he didn’t know?
Mitch glared weakly at him, but his curiosity won over the habit of raising a fuss. Pity. Sherlock hoped that it’d be enough to stop him from enquiring. “You said for one thing. And for another?” the older one asked.
“If you would get on with it, instead of making empty chitchat, I wouldn’t mind having you around. This investigation is so maddening.” Sherlock frowned, but didn’t elaborate.
“I’m assuming you asked him the basics—alibi, how many times he fantasised about murdering Livia, those kind of things,” the consulting detective replied, shrugging.
“If I’m accused, I’ll have to seek legal counsel before I answer any of that. But I’ll give you a free tip: knowing who the victim is might help me explain my relationship with her.” Seriously, who let this person in office? He supposed it was a question of seniority, as she did look to be at least in her late sixties, but idiotic people didn’t improve with age. They weren’t wine!
Annoying as Sherlock found that habit, it didn’t even occur to him to complain this time. Besides, he’d texted Mitch about being on the way to an interview that could prove fruitful not long ago—as always with any evidence that his profession was, indeed, the right choice. “You have to save me!” he whispered, getting in Mitch’s personal space. The elder one might hate it, but there was no time or space for niceties when the very fabric of the world was crumbling.
Her uncle sighed. “
John turned around, catching his gaze, but Sherlock refused to lower his own. He had nothing to feel guilty about. Judging from the grin that spread on the other man’s face, his surprise was without a hint of suspicion…Good thing for the country that the man wasn’t in MI6.
He hung up without replying to the faint, “It won't help,” coming from the line. John’s lack of faith in him didn’t matter. He couldn’t certainly do worse than the man himself.
…So the following morning saw John on a plane going to Ancona, Italy, naturally. There was a last minute offer that meant they almost paid him to go, and as for his room, once he actually landed he’d find something. Yes, it was a gamble, but he’d always liked betting anyway. Besides, it wasn’t as if he was picky about accommodations. Not after Afghanistan, and definitely not with the place he was living in at the moment. He kept telling himself that he wasn’t settled yet, but he knew that unless something unexpected happened there would be few chances to change his life around.
Gemma tilted her head to the left. “The commissioner...didn’t exactly explain. May I see your documents, again?”
"It is."
Bea laughed. “You’re not wrong, but come back, please.” Grudgingly, the other did.
"But let me make sure I have things straight." Straight might not be the best adjective, but Sherlock isn't going to argue semantics now. "You're ApparentlyObvious. You figured out I appreciate your style, and that's what brought the sudden kissing on. Not because a man's alibi depends on it. Or that you decided you need data of some sort. I like it, you like it."
A redhead sat upright, smiling at him. “So? Did you get the cum laude, or what?” she asked – or at least John assumed she did, since he did recognise the word laude at least.
Sherlock didn't admit – was too ashamed to – that despite two-years hunting, he hadn't managed to entirely wipe out Moriarty's web. In fact, he'd missed what whispers around the world claimed was the man's second in command. If it even was a man, some remarked in hushed voices, their attitude hinting that they didn't simply mean a woman. As if the consulting criminal would actually consort with demons, monsters, or whatever else the gossip of the day leaned towards.
“Hey, it’s okay,” John interjected, smiling, “you don’t have to do a single thing you don’t want. As long as you promise neither to leave town nor to investigate on your own, it’s fine, isn’t it?”
No amount of huffing and demanding, more or less forcefully, actual data had ever provided him with more than the man's alias. The Colonel. Of course without any detail to what army he (she?) might have served in, campaigns, or anything that could allow him to put Mycroft to the task and give him at least a shortlist of names. If the bogeyman was ever actually involved in war. The worst of his terrified, nonsensical sources insisted that evidence of the man's inhuman nature was how he'd speak sometimes of wars across all history and the universe as if they were no more than yesterday's job. Maybe the Colonel was no more than a historian with a knack for storytelling? Jim would certainly appreciate a man of his talents. Why waste actual gunpowder to keep his underlings in line when a well-woven story could do as well?
“Oh, I will. But have you seen this town?”
He turned around, hissing, “She’s not objecting, and I don’t remember anyone putting you in charge, Captain.”
It was almost hypnotic how one single drop of quicksilver would activate the solution, making it look like a living creature. If you could observe living creatures’ heartbeat with the naked eye, that was. Sulphuric acid—one of the main players involved—was commonly associated with death, danger and destruction, and indeed deserved its fame. And yet, as long as the correct element was close enough, the least amount of reagent would create something so beautiful. Even with the mixture managing to reach the pin no more than momentarily at every expansion of the fake heart, the result was always its oxidation. In lay terms, the poor thing would end up rusting completely. And when it was completely ruined, the reaction would conclude, and the fake heart stop. It was a constant of chemistry; even the most fascinating reactions ended eventually. Others took their place, true, like the cycles of decay began when the reactions keeping us alive ceased. The only question was, how long would each go on?.
Sherlock shrugs. "It seemed a natural evolution."
John’s laughter made his nerve endings tingle, when it had no business doing so. “Seriously?”
Since the barwas on the other side of the square, though just out of sight, Sherlock loitered at the palace’s entrance, leaning on a corner and ignoring the few tourists that came in. Not just because it felt at least ten degrees cooler than outside. The chance to observe anyone without their knowledge was always more fruitful, and there was a fifty percent…no, more like sixty-six percent chance that he’d be able to examine John covertly. If his brother was interested in John enough to lead him on, obviously Mycroft knew something. Something Sherlock had missed; that was unprecedented.
The cop—a fifty-something, grizzled man—visibly rolled his eyes. “And you would be?” he asked, his accent atrocious.
“We literally met once. We shared one hour on the bus. Four days ago,” John remarked, counting down on his fingers all the ways they were strangers. It seemed that the Italian habit of gesticulating was catching.
John giggled again. That would have been an interesting custom.
"No, you didn't" Sherlock cut in, "then again, nobody ever does."
Perhaps it was, though. When their waitress came along, suggesting dessert and coffee, the doctor glanced at him and shot her down. Bless him for understanding that lingering wasn’t an option. If they couldn’t investigate any longer today, at the very least Sherlock needed to get to his room and delete every interaction not strictly pertaining to the murder. If he managed to, that was.
“Now, if you don’t mind, we were trying to figure something out—and our prof. won’t be happy if we can’t,” the other girl said, waving them away and frowning while she put her sketch under Livia’s nose.
He grinned at the man spluttering and protesting, while at the same time rushing around to look for the documents. It was easy to actually get the job done, if you only knew how to deal with people.
“I suppose I could go for a coffee,” the consulting detective conceded.
“Gee, thanks,” John said, “how sweet of you.”
If his dreams that night were a bizarre mix of sensual and tempestuous, a nameless, faceless body joining him in an outside escapade, while the rumble of thunder sounded like someone he recognised…nobody was going to know. Not even Sherlock Holmes could read dreams. It still beat the nights when he returned to the battleground. A good summer shower wouldn’t have been out of place. Maybe that was what he was missing. Yep, that.
!” Sherlock retorted, fighting to keep still. Usually he would leave when faced with this much idiocy, as life was much too short to be wasted on fools. But he couldn’t leave John in the hands of someone who couldn’t even recognise a proper document of identity from a counterfeit.
The collective gasp from her guests was expected. Her own reaction wasn’t. Bursting into tears? A wordless, strident keen that would have been more fitting for a bird of prey, though the bird wouldn’t be half as loud? Why would she behave that way? Sure, her acquaintance might have been a convenient money source, and if she wasn’t guilty, she might have grieved the loss. But this? Completely unreasonable.
Flint eyes melted into a cloudy haze. It was more fascinating than all the masterpieces John had seen today. “I thought that you would come to your senses, once you saw people reacting to me properly,” Sherlock mumbled.
, Sherlock said, with perfect accent and a teasing look John's way). First, they nipped downstairs, for a quick visit to the basement—ancient stables, dyeing area, and other such places. Despite their acquaintances' effusive commentary, they walked right past a room, sporting a bright red ‘Danger’ sign…or would have, had Sherlock not ducked right in. His loud disappointment made John smile, when it turned out to contain nothing more than a water tank, a few coins littering its bottom.
John uses put upon sigh no. 15, reserved for when Sherlock is being purposefully obnoxious. "Yes, you do. I frankly thought it was some sort of grand plan you had going on, what with the way you took longer than usual to start on a bored fit, but no experiment ever popped up to destroy half the flat. If giving it up whatever it was is so disheartening, put the scheme back on track. Just let me know what I should expect. Were you on the brink of sweet-talking Molly into relinquishing a whole dead body this time, or what?"
John whipped around, an eyebrow lifting almost to his hairline. Seriously?
…And once again his mind wandered to observing Sherlock work rather than their suspect’s surroundings. His commanding officer would have been livid, but with no immediate threat to his life, his eyes didn’t seem able to budge from the most delectable person they’d ever seen. While he prized himself in noticing every sniper he’d come across, he was the first to admit that he felt undertrained for police work.
“Okay. Just to stop you from feeling useless.” It was logical, after all. Nobody would suspect that he would do almost anything if asked in that tone. He wasn’t supposed to care about him. He wasn’t supposed to care about anyone.
Alone, in a fully stocked lab, Sherlock allowed himself to twirl between the cabinets. What was there to spend an afternoon with? He didn’t really have time for something that would increase his knowledge, not that he didn't keep abreast of most recent innovations in chemistry. Experimenting was still a brilliant way to have fun. Now, what to do...
“Was she stalking you?” Gemma let slip, before biting her lips, probably because the sentence came out louder than she’d intended.
“That’s so cuuuute!” she honest-to-God screeched, and John cringed. Better than being lectured or insulted, sure, but not much. Luckily for his eardrums (and sanity), they were almost there.
“It might be a bit much for me. I do know someone who’d fit right in, though. Maybe you wouldn’t mind including him in such a tour?” John replied.
“Can we come in?” Gemma asked, smiling at him.
“You two. Are. Adorable!” she said, clapping once. Okay, this was awkward.
friend?”
“Best friends! I was terrified, but then he helped me practice English conversation, and my panic went away, because after all, an actual British man understood what I was saying. And top marks!” Viola looked confused for a minute, trying to thrust a full glass in the hands of the cop, but the other’s attitude was making it impossible.
The only problem was that, their little issue solved, they were now expected to solve the major one. They could have tried to just retreat to the...thing and figure out how to turn it on (couldn't really trust the Colonel, could they?) but Sherlock was pretty sure they'd be followed, and dealing with hoplites wherever they ended next didn't seem like an appealing prospect. Normally, he'd just nod towards John and unleash him. War was his beloved's specialty. But this war would obviously have parameters quite different from the ones John was trained to.
“You won’t believe me. I can scarcely accept it myself,” the journalist said, turning to stride across the room.
That was the only reason John frowned at it. He wasn't so shallow as to want his new acquaintance in the back just to be beside him. They were still forming any sort of relationship, never mind a sentimental one. “I thought college taught you chemistry,” he said.
“Well, I missed lunch, what with being arrested, so my personal plans included an early dinner,” John said, shrugging.
Sherlock huffed. “Ridiculous.” He’d just found them a number of suspects. What more did the man want? Yes, he was supposed to solve the case, but no one else seemed to be doing anything at all. It was odd. He thought that John’s praise endeared the doctor to him, despite the man's frustrating stubbornness. Now that Gemma was the one complimenting him, though, he was certainly smug, but not nearly as thrilled as he had been. Had he just enjoyed the novelty of the experience, so that he lost much of his glee now that had worn off? He’d hoped that pleasure wouldn’t turn stale quite so quickly, but he should have known; he processed things much quicker than other people, after all.
In fact, another one (Stefano, he thought, the boy with the glasses and auburn hair) yelled, “Look!” The road was winding, upwards and upwards, so without that warning John would have missed the sight that caught his breath. It was a palace, its front offered to the cliff side. Renaissance, if John had to guess. Two slim towers framed the façade, whose middle was decorated by a series of overlapping, arched balconies.
“Oh, that—yes!Actually, one evening uncle invited both me and the lady scientist—a geo-something, sorry, I’m the worst at science—that discovered it. Fascinating! If you’re interested in art, I’d be happy to give you a tour. And maybe we can talk uncle into letting us see some of the things he has to keep off the museum floor proper. Or just explore the castle. Just one tip: if you want more details about that, call her la Gioconda if you must, but don't let uncle hear you use the single n foreign version. In one of the Italian dialects, that'd mean C-word Lisa."
“Do your worst.” He hoped that his companion wouldn’t notice the little shudder which went through him, issuing such a blanket statement. Even in a public place, and with the cop less than a yard from them, it felt like a risk.
At this point, if aliens had landed and entered the place determined to raze it to the ground, Sherlock would have just deduced them, too. “The three girls at the corner table—the one who just got her degree, wearing the laurel, wants to become a teacher. In fact, she’s generally the responsible one, and is the one who drank least despite today being her day. The one in the green dress is her elder sister, the resemblance is obvious, and has a job in retail as you can see from her hands—in fact, I’m wondering if her choice of attire was an unconscious sign of envy. The third is the new graduate’s best friend, and thinks it’s her duty to make sure that her friend has fun, whether she likes it or not. Oh, she’s been light of hand, in fact I’ll be very surprised if some of the make-up she wears wasn’t pilfered, it’s a bit high-end for someone who wears that dress on a festive occasion, but she slipped something from a flask she hides in her purse in her friends’ drink. Vodka, I reckon.”
Promise to behave? What were they, five? Sherlock rolled his eyes so hard he was sure it wasn’t just noticeable, but audible. Still, he didn’t want to be saddled with his current company any longer than necessary. So—just like John—he agreed to the plan. After arranging a meeting for the morrow, they were finally free to go back to their hotels. Or at least he thought they were.
Sherlock flashed him a glare—
“And sit on this landing for another four or five hours until your colleagues deign to turn up? No. You’re obviously not a reliable organization. I’ll just go in now, and any evidence you already collected will have to be enough, if you’re concerned about it. I do hope that you have taken samples of everything on the scene already.”
“Oh, I have just the one.”
“Troops, march!” Livia said, taking the lead and walking towards the museum. Everyone gave up their squabbles and followed, giggling at her cocky attitude. Only John, at the very back of the group, allowed himself to roll his eyes. Then again, nobody here knew his past. Nobody but Sherlock, that was. The brief glance of solidarity from him made the former soldier shrug. People being silly didn’t bother him at all. He would have to give up some of his best friends, if it did.
Sherlock chuckled. Again. God, his laugh was adorable. “Well, yours might be!” the journalist said. He shrugged. “But honestly, I just modelled myself after canon. If mum wants a Sherlock Holmes, she can have him...And even she understood that it’s a nightmare to actually have him around. I don’t know why you are the only one blind to that. Are you sure you're okay?”
“Don’t tell me that you didn’t get an impression of her character,” John replied, raising an eyebrow.
From the next table, Gemma interjected, “Well, can you blame her?” So much for offering them the illusion of privacy. Or of cops connecting enough giant dots to put themselves in other people’s shoes. How did they ever solve anything?” The involuntary consulting detective glared at her, until she lowered her eyes to her own table and started playing with her fork.
Sherlock was dancing. Not literally dancing, it’d be quite concerning if his reaction to blood splatters was bursting into a pirouette, and the ultimate proof that John had been run over on the way to Misha and in a coma ever since. But the way he moved between the stains, the way he’d lean to examine a detail making sure not to brush against anything. A partner in a tutu wouldn’t have been out of place any more than a surprisingly quiet Gemma. You’d think that she would have words—lots of them—”Careful,” and, “Don’t”, and, “What are you even looking at?” The answer to which would be interesting. Instead, she was just looking at him like an oddly fascinated falcon, her head tilting to follow his movements.
“No need to call security, I assure you, prof. Cecchini. This is my brother, who should really know better than to cause a ruckus at his age,” Mycroft interjected, wringing his hands.
Back to the National Gallery it was. Walking into the inner courtyard, he was shocked to find the ticket office at the opposite end of the wing from the main staircase marked as the entrance to the actual museum. No one and nothing was stopping him from just going up. Did they expect an honour system to work? It went against Italians' fame as dogged rule-breakers. Or perhaps, it was the reason the director, according to his brother, loudly complained about lack of funds. But if it was so, no one would be that idiotic…or was he?
“Especially then.” John didn’t wink. There was no need to.
Sherlock laughedat him. “You’d never dare. At worst, you’d sketch me headless. Not exactly the same thing. Besides, you are the one who needs to apologise, not me.”
,” the younger one snapped, his voice echoing much more loudly than he intended. He bit his lips. Mycroft trying to force him into behaving was a brotherly tradition.
John watched him walk away. Odd. No, not that Sherlock had bodily functions...but given the man's attitude, John would have expected him to postpone it. After all, there was a subject to interrogate in depth.
Instead of answering, Sherlock dives for a kiss. Instead, of the immediate enthusiasm he expects, he's shoved off. He should have known. He shouldn't have –
“Leave that decrepit thing alone and
He typed quickly.
Viola, a tall girl with a blinding smile and ringlets of black hair to the small of her back, won the ‘honour’ of sitting by him on the bus by virtue of being a Foreign Languages student and trying for an English exam in two days. And, John suspected, because she could glare people down in a way that she probably thought was subtle but that he had a hard time not snickering at.
“Of course, I’m truly sorry, Professor. I hope you won’t hold my slip of the tongue against us all. Can we step into your castle?” Gosh, John felt ridiculous, but it’s not as if he didn’t have his share of arrogant teachers. Heck, his Pathology prof. obviously considered the day wasted unless at least one pupil burst into tears. He’d learned long ago how to placate their kind.
John smiled. “Oh. Yeah, sure. Nothing objectionable at all about her.”
“So, do you suggest going tomorrow? What are we supposed to do in the meantime?”
John managed to keep in the snort that came to him. No, she didn’t. They reserved that for hapless foreigners, apparently.
“Abbiocco. You know when after a meal you just need to sleep? And if it’s a huge meal, preferably sleep till the next one? That’s it. It’s not exactly a nap. I mean, nap to me sounds like you have a choice. Even after coffee, you won’t be able to think straight with some serious abbiocco. But I can order for you, Sherlock, if you’re nervous about it,” Gemma explained, shrugging.
If Sherlock left, though, he would eventually have to explain his reasons to their parents. There was no doubt that Mycroft would tell on him if he didn’t get his way...whatever his way was. The last thing he needed was a concerned mum asking why he ran away. Once their mother was aware of the situation, the only way for him to be rid of John Watson would be to straight-out murder him and ensure the body was never found, which the journalist would rather avoid. As much as they had to dodge each other, for everyone’s sanity, John hadn’t done anything to deserve death. Yet. In fact, if he’d been called something—anything—else, Sherlock would have accepted his invitation without a beat. Not many people (fine, let’s be honest, nobody to date) praised him. Not after being the object of his deductions.
Sherlock smiled to himself. You really could trust the man to come up with the wrong option.
“Stop deflecting. Who’re we going to question first? If you slow down the investigation, I’ll be forced to suspect you myself, and neither of us wants that, do we?” Sherlock said. Sure, John seemed to have no motive—the police certainly hadn’t produced one—but if he had developed a blind spot, he needed to account for it.
Livia sighed deeply. “That’s it. If we’re having this tour—and I’m all for sharing art with anyone who appreciates it—you’re both using aliases. Uncle is a Very Serious Man. With capitals. He won’t take it kindly if he thinks that you’re…taking the piss, is that the word, yes? Not even for me.”
Once back home, he put that failure behind himself. There were bigger things to care about anyway. Current cases to solve. And, of course, John. He had to work himself back in the man's good graces, and then more than that. That hadn't even been intentional, but when a mix of luck, adrenaline and lessons learned meant that feelings he could barely believe John shared slipped out, well. A perhaps not actually existent figure from Moriarty's web lost all priority. At least until, a few years later, voices of the Colonel's reappearance started again.
“Not right now, or even tonight. I promise it’s not what you think.” John backed away, obviously trying to appear non-threatening. As if anyone could forget what this man was capable of, if only he allowed himself. Sherlock's curiosity would be the end of him some day.
Sergio glared at them, when they went back inside. “If you want to talk about someone, you might as well keep it low enough that said person won’t hear. I would have let you search whatever you wanted as long as you asked. I just hope that you haven’t messed up any room.”
"Don't," Holmes replied, "I'm almost finished anyway—and I can mail you any further questions if necessary, I hope, Mr. Welland? I assume that you'd rather spend your precious time outside of the ward with an old friend and colleague just back from the field in Iraq, or possibly Afghanistan, than talking about work. Far be it from me to deny or even delay a chance at a support network to one of our veterans."
“Well, get to the point,” the boy grumbled.
"Oh, you found those." So John has seen fics. Fine. An accident, undoubtedly. Just like how Sherlock started. "Yeah, I don't know where they got that idea from."
“Crime scene? Are you seriously thinking that you’ll be allowed in?” Gemma frowned, a hand almost going to stop the journalist, before she thought better of it.
She shook her head. “No debts, I'd know about it. I mean, she'd ask me first. I was right there. Loans—to everyone who asked, really, but they were mostly small amounts. You don’t murder for 20 Euros. The only one who came round more often than the others...I mean, I’m not saying she would do that, but... Viola. Classmate, too.”
It was obvious why, once what Sherlock assumed was the director walked after his brother. He was a wiry man of about sixty-five, with an undoubtedly cultivated (possibly even with a minor plastic surgery) likeness to Julius Caesar. Oh joy. The journalist might have just found someone more full of himself than his sibling—and with Mycroft’s chosen alias, Mitchell, meaning “who is like God”, that was a feat.
coming along. The last thing we need is to give your superior any excuse to deny that we did help solve the case, or have her make up any other insane accusations,” the consulting detective declared. Curious how John knew where the Academy was, in the first place. Not that the man was a viable suspect—there was no way that an ordinary girl could escape from the kitchen to the hall, if he wanted to kill her—but he was disappointed in Gemma for not remarking on it.
“Amazing,” John said, again.
“Brilliant.” It was Sherlock, though the students nodded, looking at him with something almost like awe now. This outing had been an amazing idea.
“Oh.” Luca dropped the test tube he'd picked up while talking to her, then rushed to cushion its fall. Laying it gently on a counter, he straightened up into a rigid stance. “I...didn’t know. Why doesn’t anybody tell me things?”
"We've always loved Greece," the Colonel hummed, tilting his chin towards a...well, an actual, walled city not so far under them. A temple shone in pride of place. "I'd say you're lucky to end here."
“You wouldn’t need to ask if you could recognise a British passport when one is smacking you in the face. Or at least your commissioner wouldn’t, and I hope you’d take her word for it,” Sherlock snapped, fidgeting as if he was tempted to physically remove her and get to his crime scene.
“No, I don’t. Sorry, didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable. I meant it as reassurance,” John replied, raising his hands in surrender. “But I
John's frown, though, is odd. It's not his bored frown, not the looking for the right word one (the detective sometimes idly wonders if he's stolen that look since first noticing it). Definitely not the incredulous one that leads to "People did what? Expert's opinion, Lock, what drugs must they have been on?" Nine out of ten, the answer is just their own stupidity. And it's not even the angry one, that makes the detective sure that if he had the person responsible in the room, John would be smiling instead – before putting a bullet in them. It's definitely not the sad, sometimes defeated look Harry's messages are likely to evoke. No, John seems worried. And Sherlock needs to know.
“His hair. It would drive you nuts. So many shades of blond, that a faithful portrait would take ages. Good thing that he still has the military haircut, or he would look like the real life model of an angel, and as kind as he is, that’s definitely not his whole nature. Thank God.”
“Your brother didn’t inform me,” the professor grumbled.
Mycroft paled, but Sherlock grinned at him, offering his hand. “Sherlock Holmes.” As expected, that made the other man frown. “And no,
Mark the date they’d be back, so that he could ask Sherlock out as soon as he was back on British soil? Surely a week would blur the memory of his blunder…or would it fix the negative impression in Sherlock’s mind, with no new experiences to contradict it? Would the man think,
“Either things go your way or I lose my cool and throw you both in a cell, is that how you want to play?” Gemma said, then—much to John's shock—she downright guffawed. “You’re lucky that commissioner De Giovanni is even more aggravating than you are. Or maybe I’ve just had to deal with her for far longer,” she explained, once she had her breath under control. “I’m going to trust you again.”
John bowed to him, still laughing.
“If there’s a madman at this table, it isn’t you.” Sherlock mechanically stirred his drink.
“Questioning,” his partner said, “She was killed by someone she knew. Even if the two coffee cups in the kitchen were old, which I don’t believe, as the residue would have dried further, the door wasn’t forced. Even in Italy, you don’t offer coffee to burglars.”
All the time, in every universe, if you listened to mum. She’d never figured out that just because she sported a name out of Conan Doyle before marrying dad, it didn’t mean that the real world was a Victorian story. If time travel was a reality, he’d go back and pay the man to have her eponymous character described as miserable instead of queenly. That should hopefully be enough to stop her obsession.
John's sudden grin is answered with a confused frown, but Sherlock refuses to ask what in turn.
Part of him thought that he was being an idiot, still hoping to get through to Sherlock while leaving further meetings to chance. His major would have been very disappointed in him. No plans was an awful plan, and a sign of sloppiness. Then again, he’d given Sherlock his word. With how paranoid and how clever the man was already, lying would have sealed the last nail in the coffin of their acquaintance, and rightly so.
“And what makes you think that you would even recognise important evidence?” the agent snapped, pointing at him.
"Step away from there," John ordered, levelling the gun on...well, whoever it was. If someone was actually there, and it wasn't just part of the current hallucination.
He gave in. Even if he didn’t need to, it was obvious that the other didn’t have any to spare for conversation. In fact, when they arrived at a clearing on top, Matteo stopped for a few seconds, panting. John looked around, eyes zeroing in on a monument a bit ahead, but his new friend said, “Ignore Raffaello. There’s much better to come.”
“Don’t get the chips,” she whispered conspiratorially, leaning in under the pretence of adjusting the position of a placeholder. “They’re frozen.”
“Oh, come on! Can’t people even say the obvious, now?” Sherlock snapped.
Thank God that the army had reinforced his already decent sense of direction, otherwise he would be hopelessly lost. All the alleys—and somehow, every street was an alley in this place—looked similar, as soon as you left the only two squares that apparently existed here. And if you left the straight ones (small mercies) for the cross streets, it could be a maze. At least, he discovered a cinema, and a number of restaurants and food places of all kinds, from proper restaurants to not-really-pizzerias specialising in a local flatbread. Called crescia, it proved to be surprisingly delicious, especially when you could make up your own filling and have it toasted on the spot. At least he wouldn’t starve or get bored with his food any day soon.
“The. Crime. Scene,” the journalist ground out, glaring.
“It’s your brother. You tell me.” John replied. “I assume Mycroft is his actual name, too?”
“Yeah, sure, sorry.” John hurried off. He was usually good at reading mood! How had he not realised that they were bothering the group?
“He means yes, thank you,” John interjected, rubbing the nape of his neck, then turned to him, “Unless you’d prefer her company?”
Most of the people walking around seemed to be college kids, and John was hit with nostalgia for that time of his life. Before the army. Before being shot. Before he felt lost and latched on the first human being that made him look forward to the next day in weeks. He hoped that none of them would ever have to feel so adrift.
“I’d ask if you were drunk, if it wasn’t obvious that your vice of choice is much more expensive. But if you think that you can hold us until we pay to have your clearly absurd accusations dropped, you have another think coming.”

“Just saying, turn it upside down and it’s a thing we still use to bring missiles up from underground storage. It ensures a smooth trip, and you really don’t want to shake them up too much. Since a few of these tiles have firearms, I’m assuming that it would be used to bring down, say, a cannon if needed,” he explained.
Finally, they came to a square John recognised, and ever-eager, Sherlock continued to march—in the opposite direction to the victim’s flat. John stifled a laugh, sped ahead of him and brushed his arm. The journalist sucked in a breath, at the unexpected, wordless touch, but then allowed himself to be turned around. Thankfully, this time his martial arts reflexes didn’t kick in; that would have been a difficult thing to explain to Gemma.
A woman asks the chemist for arsenic, and the chemist asks why she needs it. “To kill my husband,” she admits.
One of Livia’s friends, a short man of about twenty-five wearing a white shirt and shorts, snickered at this. Three glares turned on him. “I thought you were joking!” he protested.
His blogger shakes his head. "Just overreacting. Someone who used to post a lot for a while has suddenly disappeared, but I'm sure they're just busy. Or on holiday. Or something. It doesn't mean they're sick or on their deathbed. Sorry. Professional bias, you know."
“Oh, I’d say that’s more a motto for chaotic than evil alignment, and I’m afraid we’re all a bit chaotic, here. The best you can hope for is chaotic good, and I promise you that I actually want to catch the actual murderer. That’s good, isn’t it?” Gemma quipped, playing with one of her cropped auburn curls.
His wandering thoughts were interrupted by, “For someone who wanted to make a nuisance of himself, you’re really quiet.”
The clues had lead them to the most non-descript place the docks had seen. A small, half-rusted cabin, that looked like it might hold some fishing equipment or something similar. Or drugs. Many, many drugs. All in the air. It was a trap. Damn, why didn't he suspect the sudden influx of clues? Sure, they came from his own Irregulars, but. The man worked for (with?) Moriarty. Sherlock should have expected some bad blood from him, if only because he didn't leave the man any organization to inherit.
“It’s about Livia,” John said, “Have you seen her since our trip to the museum?”
John texted back J
The police station was just outside the city centre. Literally the first building on the right, when one rushed out of the main entrance into the square hosting the large parking where buses and every other car owned by an Urbino citizen—it seemed—stopped. Pollution had to be the reason that Sherlock’s breathing was suddenly more difficult. He wasn’t breathless from the trip…and he certainly wasn’t anxious. He was going to get in, explain things, and either drag John out, or at least ensure he had a lawyer before lunch.
“Ridiculous. Vindemius thought he was so clever, just being the instigator and having someone else actually kill the bishop…but a good alibi won’t do you any good if your hired killer can be paid to turn on you. People honestly thought this was a miracle? Did no one have a single active synapse?” the journalist snapped. John held in a snicker, mentally agreeing with him.
“Well, we do know something more,” John remarked as soon as the door closed behind them, his voice aiming for cheerful—if his strained smile was any clue—and hitting nervous instead.
Centuries-old fortress walls cradled what had to have been its ward, given the squared, turreted stronghold in the middle. Not that much of it remained standing. Now, though, the place had been turned into a lovely park. Gravel paths littered with wooden benches sneaked around wide lawns. Pears, heavy with fruits, were growing along the paths, and some young olive trees and a mix of evergreens peppered the lawn. Some modern art fit strangely well against the ancient fortress, though John couldn’t figure out what most of the metallic creations were supposed to represent. The only obvious one was a rusted, highly stylised representation of a cannon. Instinctively, John went to it and lightly patted one of its gigantic wheels.
That was enough to make Sherlock turn sharply towards her, eyes narrowed.
“I could, but I would have to investigate who the owner is first. Or we could go to our other suspect’s place and check if this one is back later. What do you prefer?” she replied.
The journalist snickered. “As I see it, we have a problem.”
The detective’s eyes truly looked like steel at the moment. John feared he would have yet another murder to deal with soon, so instead he said, “What about a snack instead of a full lunch? Come on—for me. Can’t have the person keeping me out of jail fainting on us.”
Sherlock nodded, and strode through the square without waiting for him. Thank God it was only a few steps, because otherwise the heat would have got to him, and slowing down would have been so awkward.
He’d never seen anyone actually scrunch his nose, either, but Sherlock did exactly that, declaring, “We can’t wait that long to solve this!”
The small streets sloped at a sharp inclination, flanked by ancient-looking houses. As much as John recognised a good defensive move when he saw one, he wondered why Sherlock would choose such a place instead of a more accessible one, especially if he didn’t expect John to follow. A sudden holiday might have brought someone else to a more mainstream place. Florence, maybe. Or Rome. But Sherlock preferred a tiny town where you practiced climbing every time you left your room. John wanted to know why. He wanted to solve all the mysteries trapped in his silver eyes. It was fair, after all—Sherlock knew everything about him on sight.
John rubbed the nape of his neck, but refused to let his eyes lower. "You're free not to believe that, but I am here to say sorry. I thought you were playing along. I mean, my name is John freaking Watson, I should have figured out that you weren't joking simply by how fed up you were. I've heard all the stupid quips and then some, what with being an army doctor, too. I just didn't think—"
“Oh, plenty,” she said. “I’m not that great a cook. Shocking, I know.” She winked. Why was it necessary for her to wink? Improper. Disgraceful, even. “But it means I do have all the best restaurants mapped. And we can be at the nearest one in five minutes. If you’ll follow me, gentlemen.”
“Well, don’t blame me when you complain once again that your art lacks ‘punch,’ brother,” Sherlock replied.
When Sherlock came back and interrupted Gemma's questioning with a sharp, “You have his alibi, don’t you? Then we can visit the next witness,” John knew.
