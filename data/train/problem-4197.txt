Dean takes in Thursday for the first time. He gets what Cole meant about his eyes, but they don’t scare him... not at all. In fact, he feels drawn to them. Drawn to Thursday in general. He notices how handsome the man is and wonders what team he bats for, but he knows this isn’t the time or place to ask. “What happened to your last one? He go home and live happily ever after?”
They could see Jagger watching his own monitor, and then saw someone walk across another screen off to the side. Madison gasped and pointed at it. “I saw someone!”
The man was hesitant but reached for the pen. “Is it even worth it? I won’t ask who it is, but... does he at least have a nice ass?” He sighed on the line and slid it over, pulling out his personal belongings.
Jask and Ares walked inside wearing all the signs that there was a fight. Ares had a split lip, and Jask had a busted nose. Even Dean had a scratch under his eye. The door slammed and Dean walked up to stand behind them. “These two were fighting behind the dugout, Cas.” Cas could feel the stress radiating off him, amplified by the fact that Dean had used his nickname in front of students.
Cas huffed, staring down at the grass. “I love how… freely you give. Whether it’s compliments, the shirt off your back, or your help. You are the least selfish person I know. And, while I’ll never admit this again, I love your stupid, ridiculous jokes. They’re only funny because you laugh harder at them than anyone else. It’s so endearing it’s almost annoying.” His nose crinkled with his smile, and the flames were catching him in just the right light. “Oh, and I’d be doing a disservice to the whole world if I neglected to mention your sleepy, morning voice. You take on almost a… southern drawl when you’re tired, and it sometimes makes me regret the fact that you’re usually gone when I get up.” He let out an embarrassed laugh and fidgeted with his fingernails. “Something tells me I probably went too far there.”
“Same goes for you, I’ll still have Drake.” She cleared her throat quietly. “What are we gonna do about living arrangements? Didn’t you have that smokin’ hot bodyguard move in with you?”
He was wearing nothing but boxers, sprawled out on his stomach. Cas stopped dead for a moment, studying the perfect curve of his ass. “Dean?” He cleared his throat quietly and walked over, sitting on the edge of the bed. “Bacon.”
Cas smiled fondly as the memory faded out and he was brought back to present day. Five years later, he was still absolutely, unreasonably in love.
Not having to lie at home about Dean was nice, and being able to call his boyfriend by his actual name and not his ex-bootycall’s name was nicer. He even put up a photo on his nightstand like the lovestruck idiot he was, and probably stared at it more than his TV.
When Ares first agreed to the “swap”, he truly hoped he was making the best decision. He had hoped with every fiber of his being that he was, and everything about Jask
They found their groove as easily as they always did, and soon their bodies moved perfectly together. Both of them so desperate for release that the entire world disappeared around them.
Shifting a little, Dean nodded. “Gym’s empty next period. No one should be in the locker room... I’m just sayin’.”
“I’d be willing to bet a great deal on it, yes.” Cas nodded, thinking of how it was Dean’s idea in the first place to swear off all other lovers when they began the project, and that was before they were in an actual relationship with each other.
Chuckling, Cas nips Dean’s bottom lip. “I know. I won't comment on the fact that it's the same term of endearment you use on weapons.” He wraps his arms around him but keeps their eyes locked. “I love you, Dean.”
Cas took a deep breath and let it out slowly, focusing on relaxing each of the muscles in his body. He was still so wound up with need and lust he could barely focus, but Dean’s finger buried itself in him to the hilt. “I’m sorry, I… I don’t know if I’ve ever wanted anyone or anything this badly.”
Frowning, Cas met his eyes. “The last time we tried something like that, we nearly got caught. Are you sure?”
Frenchie fixes his pants and grabs his radio, smacking it on his palm to make sure it still works. “In ze future, if you want more toast, I’ll get you more toast. You want more orgasms, I help there, too. Maybe try... less fighting.”
A gurgled moan cut off somewhere in Dean’s throat. “Yours, Cas. Fuck…” He reached down, gripping himself and stroking furiously as Cas snapped his hips hard.
“Yeah. What if he doesn’t remember us?” He fidgeted in his seat and drove a little faster. “Or worse, what if he decided he doesn’t like me cause we left him there the first time?”
Silence stretched for a handful of heartbeats, then Rowena bursted out into laughter. “I know who he is, you’re too easy to mess with.” She reached over and patted the top of his hand. “I’m happy for the two of you, particularly because you two were the last to know. We’ve had bets placed for over two years as to how long it would take you numbnuts to finally figure it out. I won, by the way. So, thank you.”
Cas fought the urge to roll his eyes as they got into the car. “One more thing, but you’ll already know this if you read the contract you signed. I’ll be in the room, if he so much as says the word ‘wait’ and you don’t listen, you’ll be escorted out immediately. I won’t interfere otherwise, and you likely won’t remember I’m even there after the first thirty seconds.”
The muscles in his arms started to burn as he continued doing push-ups, at this point, just to stop himself from pointing out that there are other ways to get off that didn’t involve actually having sex. “I’m positive I have no interest in bottoming, and I never said he hasn’t asked.”
“Ew, gross. I don’t think there’s any goin’ back. I’m too awesome.” Dean opened the door and automatically walked towards Baby. “We’re about to pig out on some fake Mexican food. You wanna drive through and park to eat, or go inside?”
Dean tosses his head back with a laugh, thinking about how this day is already so much better than he expected. “This is friggin epic. Cas... I haven’t laughed that hard in years. Alright, lemme in your back door.” He follows, still chuckling as he walks.
He gives Dean a sad smile. “It depends on the block you get transferred to, which will be out of my control. We will see.”
of this, I just... Jimmy is an asshole. I don't want him ruining our first Christmas together because he won't stop making jokes about buttsex."
When he finally managed to get up off the chair, he cleaned up his pie mess and plopped on the couch to watch the game. Basketball wasn’t his favorite sport, but it was better than nothing. He couldn’t wait for football season.
For a moment, all was silent. Then, Cas danced his fingertips down Dean’s spine and added, “I love it, you know. The way I have to work for it, the way it makes my jaw ache. The way it wrecks my voice, so everyone that hears me speak knows I’ve had a thick, pulsing cock shoved in my throat.”
Dean was staring at him with an unreadable expression that quickly turned into a soft smile. “Yeah? We can watch whatever you want, I’m not all that picky.”
“I smell awesome. You’re gonna miss it when you’re gone.” Dean walked over and then grinned, “did I leave that out before? I can’t leave work so... you gotta travel to your new boy toy.”
Dean held out his hand for Cas’, smiling softly at him. “You said this was the line so...” He shrugged, anxiously waiting for Cas to accept his offer.
He was also very aware that Dean was the type of person that wanted whatever he couldn’t have, simply because there
It took a second to locate the two in the sea of kids, but he couldn’t fight the satisfied, sappy look on his face when he caught sight of them dancing close. “Ahh hell, would ya look at that.”
One hand flew to the garage wall behind him in a vain attempt to find something else to hold onto. The fact that Dean was strong enough to hold him like that had Cas leaking so much his boxers were already damp. He rocked down, trying to be careful not to jerk too much as Dean pulled their bodies together. “Dean, that feels so -”
“Months? That’s impossible. You know how needy I am for your attention. Write about that, schoolboy.” Dean called out as Cas took his laptop and disappeared into his room.
A deep hum sent vibrations through his cock that had Ares coming almost embarrassingly fast, but no one could blame him — it was exceedingly rare that he truly got what he craved. When Cas pulled off, he sucked a small, barely distinguishable mark on Ares’ inner thigh, then moved off of him. “Go sit,” he said, his voice wrecked. “I’ll serve.”
The humor has a grin plastered on Dean’s face. “Yeah, definitely was an awesome incentive.” His eyes dance as he pulls his bottom lip between his teeth and looks around to ensure they won’t be overheard. “Actually, I think your incentive’s influence washed down the drain this mornin’... you should uh, refresh my memory.”
After another thirty minutes, Dean was over it. All these people ‘loved’ him, and yet none of them even knew him.
He stared at the house for so long, he didn’t notice the very tall, long-haired man walking up to him. “Hey!” He waved. “I’m Sam, I live around the corner. Just moved in, huh?” Sam handed him a flyer that just said ‘Block Party’ in rainbow lettering and ’Location: Under the sun, just walk outside.’ He smiled, “My brother made them, he’s putting it together for this weekend. Water fights, barbecue food. You’re more than welcome to join us, I believe everyone in this cul-de-sac will be there. Could meet some new people.”
Relief and happiness coursed through Cas’ veins until he thought he’d float with it. They slid the rings on each other’s fingers and Cas kissed him fully, stopping only to laugh as the people around them cheered. “I don’t think I could love you more if I tried.”
“Yes, you should,” Azrian says with all the confidence in the world. “Seems like you want to, so just… do it.”
There was no telling what happened in that room before Cas had come in, but he could make an educated guess based on the angry crowd and the bodyguards trying to keep them at bay.
Bobby sighs. “I suppose I should thank you for that. I was worried sick about that boy until you called me. Still am, but… at least I know if somethin’ happens to him now, it's his own damn fault.”
Dean holds up a breathless thumbs up, his head rolling on his shoulders. “Never—” he takes a breath — “never thought you could get me off once, let alone twice.”
P flattened out against the shower wall with a quiet hiss and then pushed back, giving Dean a good look at the lube leaking down his thighs.
Ishim hisses as he thrusts forward, tugging on Dean's hair to bring him closer. “That's it... use that tongue, boy. Don't make me do all the work.”
“Thought you did. About me, I mean.” He scratched his head, not sure if he was making sense. “Gonna come fuck me soon, J?“
He chuckled bitterly, propping himself up on his elbows. “You’re dumping me cause you’re assuming I don’t wanna deal with you being in the closet anymore? Shit, D. That’s... No. I don’t take your breakup, try again later.”
Seeing that fucking gorgeous hand had Dean gripping the metal wall, knowing there was nothing else to keep him upright. He wanted more, wanted to see that hand wrapped around both of their cocks, wanted to see the damn body attached to that hand. His hips moved involuntarily as he approached the edge, biting his tongue to stop himself from breaking the rules and telling P he was about to come.
Waking up on Saturday morning is actually a gift. Cas smiles as the butterflies in his stomach start their instant assault, but they can do their dirty worst. He's roughly an hour away from spending a whole day with Dean. Nothing is going to get in his way.
“But I do care,” Cas says quietly. “I cared enough to pull him out of the hell he was in, to put him on a path that will lead to him having a better life when he gets out, one that's not just hunting.”
“Nah, that counts plenty.” Dean groaned and laid his head against the carpet. “How could these hands ever disappoint?”
Of course, Cas chased him, wrapping his arms around him and biting the back of his neck once he caught him. “You’re absolutely perfect, Dean. Eat all the pie and bacon you want. You’ll always be perfect.”
“Dean, will you get that please? How many times are you going to let him knock!” Cas was yelling down the stairs, but Dean didn’t particularly feel like moving. He could hear Jask knocking just fine, but getting up to let him in meant… y’know, getting up.
could afford a Delorean, Dean.” He flattened his palm against Dean’s chest and let out a shuddering breath. “You’re burning up. I’m sorry, my suit probably isn’t helping.”
“While I’m flattered, I think we both know I’m Velma.” Cas rolled his eyes with a smile and sat back, licking his lips in concentration. “I have… absolutely no idea how to go about this. Do you think we can just rent out one of those places? Like an escape room or something?”
Cas caught him looking near the end of class and when Dean saw his hand palm at his crotch, his eyes shot up and met those delicious pink irises.
Cas nearly fell over with the force of his orgasm. He covered the toilet seat and grunted with the force of it, but didn’t bother trying to stop himself from wondering how much better
“Not angry.” He pulled on some boxers and then set the suitcase aside. “Doin’ what you told me to do.” Dean climbed under the covers and sighed. “Will you at least lay with me?”
kind of a mess. Maybe he’s getting a little old for these kinds of nights — on a Tuesday — but it’s better than the alternative.
“Just a chick, Cole. Ease up on that arm.” Dean walked closer, looking around to make sure she was alone. “What were you hoping to get here, sweetheart?”
thing on his mind. He wanted to talk to Cas, and he wanted to eat some damn fake Mexican food on his comfy couch. He threw on his Scooby Doo pajama pants and made his way back downstairs, happy to find Cas was still there and not in the kitchen. “Got a lot of homework?”
“Gods, you shine brighter than anyone.” Cas walked over to kiss his cheek. “I’m glad you love him so much. He’s ours, but we have to wait for him to be neutered before he can come home. I think we have a lot of shopping to do.”
Cas' expression doesn't change. “Yes. There was a time when I blindly followed Heaven’s orders. I don't anymore.”
Cas pinches his own arm to make sure he's really awake. “Yes, I… might've gone shopping yesterday. And, I baked you a pie.”
He continued feeding Dean, snorting a laugh at his joke. “Eggs are next, you need something other than bacon. But here, finish this one first.” Cas fed him the rest of that piece and then held the fork to his mouth.
Cole grabbed a fry and walked over to let Dean know, but covered his eyes the second he reached the door. “Dean! Towel!”
Already, it no longer felt like home. “Hello, Ares,” he said quietly. He wasn’t sure if he should hug him or not, kiss him, even. It seemed wrong, but they
Frenchie outright laughs and playfully nudges him. “Fine, but leave my cafétéria. If you fight again on my watch,
Jask let out an involuntary moan and unbuttoned his dress shirt so fast one of the buttons snapped off, and his pants didn’t make it much past his thighs before Ares was shoving his shoulders back and straddling him. “Fuck,” Jask groaned, wiggling his boxer briefs down and pulling Ares into a kiss.
Cas was a ball of nervous energy as they arrived at the bookstore hosting the launch party. He’d been through this a bunch of times, but this was the first time he’d actually written what he’d wanted to. “Can you help?” He turned to Dean, fidgeting with his tie. “I don’t think it’s right.”
That wasn’t the dancing Cas had in mind, but as Dean shimmied his way back over, he realized he couldn’t have picked a better song. “I’m not calling you Al, no matter how many times you make me listen to this.”
— I am... and making you leave that night was one of the most difficult things I've done in millions of years. You didn't screw anything up, you just... made me remember what it's like to
“Like you need it.” Jimmy chuckled. “I’ve never seen him this happy. Ever. So, you two have my full support. But if you dump him and start dating a different student, I deserve to be able to punch you in the face without getting detention. Right?”
time was Dean wasn’t feeling well. Not only that, it seemed him and Jo going to that party only fueled the fans obsession with their relationship. Everyone of every age wanted to talk about how cute they were and blah, blah.
“Sonofabitch, Victor,” Dean grunts, just before releasing into his fist with a long, drawn-out moan.
“On second thought, who cares that it’s the middle of the night? Darkness is better for this sort of thing, anyway.” He grabbed Ares’ hand and dragged him toward the door, then swore under his breath and raced upstairs to grab the lube.
They’d set it up in the garage, and Cas sat there, cringing to himself as the wet clay slid between his hands. He was blindfolded and couldn’t see a damned thing, but heard when the door that led into the house opened up and the beginning of
“You like to torture people, huh?” Dean set the sandwich down and took slow, deliberate steps in. “How’s that banana, sweetheart?”
They kept to themselves all night, but more than once Ares felt his body heat closer and for the first time ever, it didn’t turn him off. He wanted to feel that body heat on top of him, fucking him into the damn mattress and when he woke up the next morning, he was palming himself without realizing.
Cas kissed Dean’s hair again. “Sounds like Vancouver was the perfect choice all along, then.” He stayed put for a moment longer and then rubbed Dean’s arm and leaned back a bit. “Are you ready to go? We’re a little too vulnerable here. I’ll drive.”
In seconds, Dean was buried inside of him again, lifting his ass off the bed to barrel inside of him, chasing his release.
Cas wraps his hand around Dean’s cock again and sends a pulse of something fucking incredible through it with a small smirk. “You won't even notice I'm gone.”
“I missed you. Tell the hairy one to go.” Cas wrapped a leg around Dean and pinned them together, biting on Dean’s lip.
“You better not.” He laid his head against Jask’s strong shoulder, humming along as they swayed. “We fit so good together.”
Cas moved at his own damn pace, squeezing Dean’s ass and driving him deeper into that tight, hot throat, and the vibrations coming from Cas’ moans made him shiver. He picked up speed, bringing a hand forward to play with Dean’s balls and pressed up just behind them.
Cas took a moment to gauge how tired he was, and the likelihood of him falling asleep if he laid with Dean. He thought he felt alright, so he grabbed his gun from the dresser next to him and set it on the bedside table before crawling into the bed behind Dean.
Dean and Jask drank a little more, but ultimately decided not to get too drunk. It was just enough to give them a buzz and help with the inevitable butterflies that kept creeping up anytime either of them looked at the time. “They’re gonna be here soon. Unless they left later than they said. But they said they were leaving right then, didn’t they? Ima shut up now.” Dean blushed and scratched at his chin. “Should I shave?”
“Jesus, he’s ridiculously stunning. 23, like I said.” He glanced down to read Dean’s bio and laughed so loud Jimmy banged on the wall.
The second he turned the corner he pulled out his phone to call Charlie. “No time for formalities, Chuckles. I need you to meet me at the truck stop in like 15 minutes... bring your camera.”
P moved off him, and the vague shadows suggested he was sitting up. He whispered, “What did you say?”
Dean whined so quietly it was barely audible. “Every day till the end of the school year. Promise.” He smiled softly and turned back to Amara, who was sitting back in her seat.
Ashton yelled to someone across the room and then came running over, bodily running into Cas and stepping in front of Dean. He barked a forced laugh but dropped his voice quickly. “I don’t pretend to know what the hell is going on, but we’ve got company. With cameras. And it looked like you were about to make out with
Dean lazily returned the kisses as he brought his clean hand up to rub Cas’ back. He moved down to lay against Cas’ chest and hold him close. “Please tell me you brought a bag to stay the night.”
Dean barely manages a whispered “please” before leaning down to brush their lips together, waiting on Cas to bring it home.
Dean’s tongue on his skin - even something as unsexual as a forehead - was intense. He couldn’t speak for a moment. He just nodded dumbly and turned quickly, staring at the screen. He spotted a ridiculous expression on Edward’s face and decided to count it, but when he whirled back around to grab the filling, Dean had beaten him to it.
“Cause they’re miserable lifers. They don’t want other people having anything good. They don’t want people havin’ hope or a future. It’s shitty.”
It wasn’t clear how long Cas allowed Dean to stay in the safety of his arms, but eventually, they were both too exhausted to stay awake. They made their way to the bedroom, exchanging sleepy, loaded kisses until they were collapsing on the bed and doing their best to get so close they were practically one.
Cas’ entire mood was tanked at that point, so once his stuff was packed, he stood and walked toward the door.
“Oh fu— Cas... so good.” Ares attempted to squirm, but groaned when he couldn’t move an inch. Cas’ mouth was one of those world wonders that deserved a monument, but the fact that so little people knew about how perfect it was was alright with Ares.
“I don’t think I’ll ever get sick of you, a Dean.” He got to his feet and moved a little awkwardly to the bathroom as the plug shifted inside of him. “I think I’d have the opposite problem, actually.”
“Of course.” He took the bags and boxes from Dean, then carried them to the dining room. “I’ll wait for you.”
— completely guilt free — felt like a huge weight was lifted off his chest and he could tell Jask felt the same.
“I work Friday too, but I’ll probably beat you home.” Ares brought their beers and sat close again, his eyes on the screen.
“Fuck... take it out, Frenchie. C’mon.” Dean kisses him again as Frenchie fumbles with his belt, and his radio pops off and clatters to the ground. He ignores it, ignores everything but the way their cocks feel when they're finally fisted in Frenchie’s hand.
It was an effort to pretend like he hadn’t noticed Dean the second he sat down, so Cas was grateful that Dean finally said something. And, apparently already knew what he’d been too scared to say. Cas glanced over at Cole who had his headphones in and lowered his voice. “I’ll stay out of your way as much as I can. I know I’m not your favorite, but I can assure you... even if you don’t believe me... that this is more than a job to me, Dean. I’ll do everything I can to protect you.”
“He beat up that chick just fine.” Dean shot and missed. “Damnit.” He walked over for another drink. “Three drinks? You a lightweight, Cas?”
It doesn’t faze them — they’re all smiles, and Miracle looks relieved to see Dean, but what’s  even more beautiful is Dean
"Sure it was. I still have those condoms if you need them back. Not like I'm getting laid anymore." The last part came out a little more bitter than he intended, but he wanted Dean to know there was no one else. There probably never would be. "I don't get many complaints about my mouth, but I have been told the pros
Smiling, Cas kissed Dean’s head. He’d technically brought enough things to stay for more than a night, but didn’t want to freak Dean out. “Yes, Dean. It’s in my car.”
“Mmhm... so who are your friends?” Dean asks, trying to make him slip about who paid him. He assumes what they wanted was Jask to have to get more time, but he just wants to know who.
Cas slowly worked the plug out as he leaned back on his knees to roll the damned condom on and grab the lube. His breath hitched in his throat at the beauty of Dean all vulnerable and wanting like that, and Cas threw reason aside as he lubed himself up and scooted forward to press his tip against Dean’s entrance.
“His eyes,” Cas whispers. “They're such a beautiful shade of green that I’d never be able to do them justice with words.”
sure of was that he needed to get a grip before he earned a reputation as the ‘weird neighbor’. Dean reached out his hand and Cas was pleased to feel how rough they were.
“Cas!” Dean bites onto Cas’ hand and grunts, coming again completely untouched, squeezing the life out of Cas’ cock.
“I wasn’t gonna try,” he lies. “Was just sayin’. If circumstances were different... he’s definitely my type... which is to say he’s out of my league.”
Cas dropped his eyes to the floor and wasn’t sure he ever blushed so hard in his life, but they now had more urgent issues. “I rented this castle from a red-headed woman named Rowena. If she’s the one that cursed you, we shouldn’t stay here.”
Jask fished his phone out of his pocket and stepped back to let Dean actually walk inside. “We got matched. For the partner swap thing.”
The more time he had for his thoughts, the more he thought of his half brother. They used to speak every so often, but Adam prefered people didn’t know they were related, and Dean had to be understanding.
“I definitely understand that.” Dean walked over and sunk another, then missed. “What happened to Arthur?”
His mother was beaming at them. “He’s looked up to you for a couple of years, but your recent admission has made you his hero.”
His phone chimed and he refrained from checking it until he'd gone inside the house to properly wash his hands. He showered, ordered a pizza, plopped on the couch for the evening game, and opened a cold beer before finally checking his messages.
He hesitated but listened, turning to lean against the pool table with a grin. “Fine, don’t forget the tongue ring.”
One look at Ares’ flushed, gorgeous body had Jask throwing reason out the window. He gripped his own cock, stroking quickly as Ares caught him in another kiss. Jask’s other hand moved before he could stop it, his fingers brushed against the fabric of those lacy, perfect panties and he teased the band, moaning right into his mouth.
“I couldn’t breathe.” He blushed, feeling like a child. “I’m sorry.” Dean didn’t even know why he was apologizing, it just felt... normal. He’d spent his whole life apologizing for being him, but things were different with Cas. He didn’t need to apologize anyore, Cas lov—
Dean pressed the head to P’s hole and slowly sank inside. He guided his cock with his right hand, gripping Pegasus’ hip with his left, and dropped his head against his shoulders.
“Christ,” Dean mumbled. “Have I told you yet today how friggin awesome you are?” He kissed him once more and then got dressed slowly, pulling out his phone. “Gonna text Ares. If I tell Jask, he’ll just try to stop us.”
Cas was so relieved he would have laughed, but knew it wasn’t the time or place for that. He clicked over on his laptop to his notes for the project and jotted down his most recent discovery, feeling much better by the time he left that class.
“Let’s cook and stay home. In our comfiest pajamas.” Cas kissed his head a few times and then laid his head back, each kiss sending a spark down to Cas’ toes… and he wasn’t even the one receiving them.
Alistair shook his head. “No, Ben still works for you, too.” He stopped outside of Sonny’s office. “Would you like to take another guess or would you prefer to see for yourself?”
Cas took that as a personal challenge and took off, turning when he got a few feet away and jogging backward as he smirked at Dean. “Do you really want to test me,
Dean rolled his eyes. “I have? All of you have, too.” He was sure it had to do with the extra load they all carried on their backs now since he fired the handlers, but he wouldn’t admit that.
Cas glared at her with all the love for his sister-in-law he could muster. “Bees are not monsters, Ophelia. Without bees, the entire world would crumble. And they’re not nothing, either.”
Cas was still sleeping peacefully, but he never did mind being woken up to Dean taking him. Dean’s hands slid down Cas’ torso as his hips rutted forward, pressing his already fully-hard erection between Cas’ cheeks. The hum Cas released was all Dean needed for permission, and he moved Cas’ panties to slide his fingers inside, happy he was still pretty open from their fun before bed.
attached that his sister Hera demanded they go to lunch alone just so he could “breathe”. Ares rolled his eyes at the request, but agreed. He didn’t need to breathe away from Jask, he vastly preferred breathing
Dean gripped the waistband of Cas’ pants and pulled them down, biting all along his thighs to tease. He could see Cas was already at full mast, but he wanted to torture him a little.
“Yes, but only for a minute.” Ares grinned and pulled it out, gripping the base while watching Jask’s reaction. His pupils blew and he let out a little grunt, his shoulders tensing.
Cas looks conflicted, but sits on the bed next to him and touches his face. “Dean, I have to. I have to find out how this happened. I won't leave the prison, and I'll be right back.”
“Funny. I almost forgot you were funny. Just for that, you get to serve him his delicious meal. Enjoy.” She smiles smugly and walks out of the kitchen, leaving Cas slack-jawed and irritated.
“If I’m supposed to be undercover, then no. But most of the time, yeah. The kinda people I protect like to be flashy, and that includes the while ‘men in black’ look.” Jask was tempted to ask if he could help, but couldn’t resist watching the way Ares’ body moved. “You have a thing for suits, huh?”
This was the part he wasn’t looking forward to, because he hadn’t talked to Cas about it. “I think he needs to finish out the year. There’s only a few months left, and I think it would be disruptive for him to try and switch now. Better to finish out the year and start fresh in August.” He leaned in to kiss Cas’ cheek and muttered, “I’m sorry, sweetheart.”
Cas chuckled. “Maybe they’re planning to adopt, though, you’re right. She never struck me as the type.” He set his own phone down, content to watch the relaxed expression on Ares’ face. It wasn’t often he seemed so at ease, and it was a gorgeous enough sight that nothing on his phone could be a worthy distraction.
He nodded, like he still felt guilty, but he took a breath and met Jask’s eyes. “I... never mind. Thanks, you’re right. It’s... hard, I know he’s over there doing the actual project with no issues and I’m just over here... trying not to kiss you.”
“Me either, Cas.” He ran his rough hands up his bare skin. “What if I quit my job and my hands get soft? You gonna leave me?” He teased, knowing deep down as much as Cas loved his hands, he loved him more.
“Jask,” Dean laughed, “you can’t tell me you’re down to fuck and then immediately ask me to look at pictures of your crush.” He shook his head with an amused smile and took a sip of his beer. “And no, quit being a creep. I’ll see if I can find him in person Monday.”
Cas being Cas, wrapped his arms around Dean’s neck and deepened the kiss, sliding his tongue in his boyfriend’s mouth proudly. He leaned back after a while, just to look at his friends’ faces and grin. “Yeah, I’m ready to go home, baby.” For the first time in public, Cas interlocked their fingers and started walking down the hall.
Cas smiled at him but couldn’t shake the newfound uneasiness in his chest. What if they tried something like that, and found out they weren’t compatible at
Cas’ face crumpled for a moment and he ducked down, busying himself with cleanup. “That’s unfortunately the price you in particular have to pay for fame, Dean. Your fans see you a very specific way, and if that’s upset for any reason...” He shook his head, staring at the broken pieces in his hand. “Your life is already dangerous enough as-is.”
When Cas relays that message, Dean tosses his head back with a laugh and then bends more to kiss the top of the dog’s head. “That’s my boy.”
“Very rude, yes.” Cas leaned in to bite it but the fucker pulled the fork back. “Speaking of rude…” He couldn’t stop the grin if his life depended on it.
“I suppose it’s a good thing I’m not back in class yet. She can be as loud as she wants.” Cas stood up, draining his beer and heading over to toss the bottle.
too long since he’d had any ‘naked’ time with Dean. “Yes, I did. Ashton helped, he said it was my severance package. He fired me, by the way.”
“I think that’s exactly what it is.” Cas wandered back over and slid the second riddle toward himself.
He continued to speak about how having commitment and passion but no intimacy can often lead to feelings of insecurity down the road. One partner could crave intimacy that the other isn’t capable or willing to give, which can foster resentment, fear, insecurity, and even anger. If neither partner is willing to share in at least a shred of intimacy, there’s more than likely an underlying reason for that.
There's one, tiny second where Cas wonders if Jask would fuck him since Dean's made it pretty clear he's a bottom — but he pushes that out of his mind and offers them both an eye-roll. "You both need a hobby." He tosses the bacon on and gathers what he needs for scrambled eggs, half prepared for Dean to say something snarky when he pulls the carton out.
They skipped the plates entirely and Cas handed him a fork. “Sounds like someone else I know. I don’t know how Ares and I put up with you two.”
Part of him wanted cleanup duty, but he’d made Cole stay with Dean overnight, so fair was fair. “I’ll fly back with him. I’ll touch base when we land.”
"No," he lies defensively, but he also doesn't reach out to take the money. It feels... wrong. Instead, he adds his number in Dean's phone and hands it back without calling himself. "Text me tomorrow when the urge to slam your face into something has dissipated a little, because yes, I need a job." Even if by some miracle he isn't fired yet, he doesn't really want to work there anymore, anyway.
“Awesome.” Dean kisses him, checks out his gorgeous, naked body one last time, and then backs away with his bottom lip between his teeth. “Love you, Cas.”
“So, it’s safe to say he’s never given you a reason to believe he’d be open to something else, then. No… friends he’s a little too chummy with? Strangers he looks a little too closely at?”
He put his hand on Dean’s forehead and tried to remain calm, even though his body was betraying him. Cas chuckled nervously, trying to keep his demeanor light. “Consider me on duty right now.”
“No friggin way!” Dean dropped down, trying to pick up the wiggling puppy and nearly failing. “H—hi — woah, calm down, baby boy.”
an angel over there, but as far as what goes on… nobody knows. The people in that go aren't ever seen again. All I've really heard is that it's the worst of all the blocks in this shithole of a prison. No one wants to go there.”
Cas climbed onto his lap and kissed him, not caring that were covered in come in the middle of their classroom floor. “Yes... we definitely will.”
“About time. Were you trying to pocket my sausage?” He takes an obnoxiously big bite and eyes Cas. “You look a little strung up there...” he leans in and reads Cas’ name tag, “Cas—tiel?”
For a moment he stilled, then dropped forward to kiss Dean again before rolling off him with a satisfied huff. “Incredible.”
Dean huffed a laugh. “I couldn’t even look at that spot without getting hard. Matt was convinced someone broke in, but since nothing was missing he dropped his dumb quest pretty quick. Sam saw my neck and already knew.” Sam knew Dean did
Cas gasped quietly and held on tight, hardening a little between their bodies. He didn’t care where they stayed, he just knew they needed to make it there quickly. “There’s only one bed... I forgot.”
With a startled noise, Jask came. He humped his ass and twisted his hand on Ares’ cock as he lost his rhythm, groaning and kissing over his skin. “Say it again.”
“Um... okay.” Cas moved, his body searching for more Dean. “First question, are you still angry with me for leaving?”
The rest of the night was a blur, just like Cas had hoped it would be, and he hardly left his bed on Sunday thanks to the epic hangover.
He was just taking off his suit jacket when someone knocked on his office door, and he sighed heavily. “Come in!”
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath. “Yeah, please don’t pack anything up. Except for lube. Always pack lube.”
“Nah. Ready when you are, boss.” Dean gets comfy and eyes him — he's not sure at all what to expect anymore, every single thing that's happened since he stepped through the gate to Absolution Row has been a surprise.
His cock was so hard it hurt. He wanted to kiss Cas, but this was definitely worth having to wait a bit.
He stayed on Jask’s lap long after their boners went down, and they enjoyed being close until way past when they should have gone to bed. Ares couldn’t bring himself to move, fearing that the separation would bring doubts, and that was the last thing he wanted either of them to feel.
“Earth to Cassie.” Abbadon snapped her fingers in front of his face and he looked around to see every one of his friends looking at him.
“Show me what? How a gigantor man can squeal like a baby when tickled?” Dean sipped his beer and nearly choked on it at his own joke.
Nothing about Cas’ expression changed as he followed Dean to the room, and as always, he held out his hand for the key. Dean handed it over with an eye-roll and Cas went in first to make sure there weren’t any surprise guests. He was silent for a moment, then those blue eyes peeked around the door. “Clear.”
“My name is Castiel Novak, I was transferred to Mr. Charles’ guard and I was told to start immediately.”
“Could get used to this.” Dean ate happily, staring at Cas with a mix of awe and appreciation. “You’re the only person that’s ever fed me... literally fed me.”
“Come on.” Jask scooped him up in a bridal carry and headed for the bathroom. “It’s time to revisit that bathtub, but this time, you’re just going to relax and let me clean you up, and when you’re all dry and fed, I’ll play with your hair until you fall asleep on my lap. We have a movie to finish, after all.”
When the students filed in, the place got real stuffy real quick, and he completely lost sight of Cas. Chaperoning was a nightmare all around, within the first half hour alone he broke up a fight and had to confiscate a flask from a senior. He sniffed the liquid and chuckled to himself, at least a little impressed the kid was drinking whiskey.
“I want to. I did all the research and I’d still have to go in for a couple hours every Friday, but I wouldn’t be
It’s been awhile since Dean’s gone for a drive, but he’s well overdue. The purr of Baby’s engine calms him nearly as much as a good spanking, and he bites his lip as he speeds down an open road. He knows speeding around here is a privilege that only money can buy, but when you grease a few palms now and again, he thinks it’s well deserved.
“It has...” Ares suddenly got an idea at the word spontaneous. “Want to come back for that honey and frott against someone else’s car?”
Cas fought a laugh. The truth was, they all sounded interesting, but he couldn’t decide if that was because the shows themselves would be interesting, or if Cas was just smitten with Dean. “I’ll never say no a hot guy getting in fights, so… that one.”
"Can I be excused? I told someone I would call them tonight and... well, her dad doesn't want her talking to me past 9:00... so I only have like a little over an hour to talk to her. Shut up, Cas."
“Overachiever,” Dean teased, walking over to lean in and hover. “What kinda class is this? Communications or some shit?”
“Casss... gon—” Dean’s grip on his hair tightened as he released into his mouth, he muffled the groan as much as he could, but the grunt that escaped sounded so incredibly delicious Cas nearly came then and there.
Something about Dean is calling to him in a way he's never felt before, not in all of his millions of years. He wants to hold him, love him, praise him every minute of every day, but if he doesn't do something soon, he's going to lose him.
“Yes, I realized you weren’t fond of the L and T aspects of a BLT, so this one is bacon, egg, and cheese. Breakfast for lunch… is this better?” He slid the plate over and stepped in close.
Cas couldn’t take his eyes off of Dean, afraid that if he did, it would all turn out to be a dream. He was painfully hard, need and desire coursing through his veins and leaking out the tip of his cock. “I don’t think I’m going to be able to stay quiet,” he whispered.
“Best banana ever.” Dean clicked his tongue and walked to the fridge for some water. “Still not done with that sandwich, we might have to get a room.”
Whatever rest he would have gotten was interrupted rather quickly as what started out as a pleasant dream suddenly turned much darker.
The news isn't shocking. “Anna, if he complains again, I'm going to shove these down his throat. You know damn well there hasn't been a single thing wrong with the food.”
Three days before Christmas break, Dean was so lost in a daydream about Cas that he didn’t notice how hard he was squeezing his coffee mug. It shattered, slicing his palm open, and he had to rush out of his first period class and head to the nurse’s office. Thankfully, Ares wasn’t busy and had some Dermabond on hand, but the conversation was still gonna be awkward as hell.
little kept whore.” Dean stood up and gathered their bottles. “Wanna sword fight after my massage, hot stuff?”
Dean quickly looked toward the window and whistled to himself. It was a coward move, but at least Cole would get
Again, Dean saw a look in Cas’ eyes that said Dean was being bratty, but before he could comment on that, Dean reached down to stroke himself. As soon as Cas’ eyes traveled down to his fist, Dean knew he was once again in the clear. Cas pulled out until just the head was inside and slammed back in. Their moans were so loud it was impossible to know who was louder.
Cas briefly wondered if they should move to the bed, but the thought of losing Dean’s touch even for a moment was borderline devastating. There would be plenty of time for comfort — right now, this was nothing more than fulfilling a burning, consuming need.
Dean blushed and huffed a laugh. “Uh... I imagine it was a witch. Her name was Rowena, and I didn’t like her messin’ with my brother Sam. I told her to fuck off and leave him alone. Witches are shady, Cas. Never tangle with one. Next thing I know, she’s breakin’ in my house in the middle of my uh... private time.” He shrugged. “I was kinda aware of little things. Like I came in and out of consciousness. Wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but every so often I would look around and see I was somewhere different, but I couldn’t move. I saw you... yesterday. You looked so fucking hot, and when you stroked my dick...” Dean bit his lip, his cock twitching noticeably. “Thank you... for goin’ for it.”
let those thoughts drag him down, but it seems like Cas is gone for a really long time. So long that Dean starts to fear Cain got to him.
walk all over him, and he’s smart as a whip. Seriously, the kid’s a damn genius, but I think he hates school.” He grunted as they fan came loose and he set it aside, opening up the box with the new one. “You should see the kid’s eyes, Sammy. And I’m not talking about the built-in mood ring bullshit, I mean his eyes. Bluer than you can imagine.”
On some level, Dean knew he should take that a certain way — but now, all he wanted was to hear Cas gush for an hour, a day, a week, about what his favorite subject actually was. He smiled a little, sliding his hands in his pockets and bowing out his elbows. “There are far more interesting things than me, Cas.”
Alistair stretched out his skeleton-looking hand, “Alistair. I’ve been doing this for twenty years, the boy will be fine.”
your job to feed me. Y’know that, right? I just threw one of those frozen pizzas in, no big deal. Besides, seems like you worked that big, giant brain of yours just as hard as I worked my body today. I think we’re even.” He patted Cas’ leg and stood up, making his way toward the door. “C’mon, we’ll eat and have a beer, then you can come right back to bed.”
“Anything can make that marshmallow puke,” Cas shot back, happy that he and Jask were at a place where they could banter. “When’s your wedding, Jaskier? I’m sure Ares would love to marry you.”
“You’re an ass.” Jo smacked his arm playfully and tried to fix it. “Oh, who cares. If you really follow through with this, no one will be paying attention to me, anyway. Now come on… let’s go break a million hearts.”
Brady wasn’t as bad as that dick, Alistair, but Dean still wanted to punch him every morning, right in his dumb blonde head. “Come on, Dean. Did you have pie last night again?”
“The last — and arguably most important piece of Sternberg’s triangle — is commitment. Now, some of you might be sitting there thinking this will be easy. That commitment means marriage, or not engaging with outside individuals. You’re wrong.”
The bar was ridiculously packed. It always was a tight fit, but this night was unusually stuffy. The drunk girl in the corner wearing a tiara told him it was also someone’s birthday.
“No.” Thursday drops his eyes and licks his lips slowly, then smiles slightly. “I’ve never really had a family. What about you?”
“Okay... tonight?” Ares moaned into Cas’ mouth and lapped inside, loving how their precome made Cas’ hand stroke them with ease. “Gods, your hands.” He rutted into Cas’ fist before taking a moment to look around and make sure they weren’t being watched.
Ares pulled their mouths apart and stared down at him with a soft smile. “You don’t regret this, right?”
“Okay,” he muttered to himself as he booted his laptop. “No big deal, just need to find a good way for couples to communicate without therapy. Shouldn’t be too hard, right?”
Ashton screwed up his face in offense. “Christ, Dean. I know we don’t get along all the time, but I’m not an asshole. No, listen...” He glanced around them and pulled Dean further away from everyone else. “Cas told me everything, okay? Don’t be mad at him, I said some really shitty things to get him to tell me. He’s got a car, and he’s outside waiting for you. If you don’t wanna do this, don’t wanna go through with the wedding — you’ve got an out. I’ll cover for you here while you two ride off into the sunset, but you gotta go
Abby’s eyes turned pink at the thought. “Back off, twat. He’s mine, it’s just a matter of time.” She reached over and stole some of his food - like the animal she was - as Jimmy cut in.
It had been a while since Dean had done a photoshoot, and Abaddon had a personal trainer coming over every day of the week to get Dean in shape for his pre-convention shoot. 6am workouts were for demons — Dean was convinced.
After a minute, Jask tried the pose himself but didn’t even come close. He grinned eagerly though, not realizing how poor his posture was. “If you get past the fucking burn, it’s not so bad. Do I look as good as you do?”
Jimmy and Dean practically race to the dinner table, making almost everyone roll their eyes at them.
“Jesus... am I still in solitary? Is this all in my head?” he asks as he strips. Lee just laughs and gives him the room, and Dean takes a long, hot shower for the first time in months.
“Mind if I join you?” Thursday asks, sitting before giving Dean a chance to answer. He's got his own breakfast with him, just a small cup of yogurt and a muffin.
Dean was already dressed when Cas walked in the house. He turned to face Cas with a mouthful of donut and smiled like he was his favorite person in the world. “M’rnin’,” he mumbled.
He sat down on Dean’s couch as Havoc jumped in his lap. Cas frowned at the dog but pet him gently, and he settled quickly. “I’m alright, I’m sorry it’s been so long since the last time I contacted you. My position with Dean has become…
Dean paused mid-bite with noodles hanging out of his mouth as he saw Cas’ eyes, then nudged him with his foot under the table and quickly swallowed his food. “So, Amara. I imagine raising twins isn’t easy, but definitely not when it’s these two. How do you do it?”
as he drives himself in deeper, harder, scratching at Dean’s skin and fisting a hand in the front of his grey, perfectly pressed shirt. “Screw it.” He gives up on the insult and bites the back of Dean’s neck, leaving a mark, and Dean groans, releasing his throbbing cock as Cas bites down. When he bares his neck more, Cas peeks around at it, noting how it looks strained and purple like he’s been edging himself for hours.
Dean chuckled and took his time answering again. “Jask... you asked J if he wanted to fuck, right? While I was gone.”
“You can take your chances,” Jask replies. “But I wouldn't advise it. You've been here, what... two days? Multiply that by ten years and tell me if you think you can go it alone. Benny's a lifer. He's not going anywhere.”
“There are some that want you dead. For the lie, for allegedly breaking Jo’s heart, for… well, for being gay.”
“Ready now.” Dean sat up with a sigh and walked to the bathroom to wash up. It only took him a few moments to walk back out, by which time Cas had the coffee brewing. “Talk to me, Cas. Please.” He shrugged on a t-shirt and walked over to sit on the edge of the bed.
By the time the bell rang and Kevin dashed out to head to class, Cas was ready for the day to be over.
“Mr. Winchester. Very good to see you again.” She walked over and held out her hand, and Dean you took it with a smile, standing up halfway out of his chair.
Though Cas didn’t quite believe him, he didn’t blame him for not going into more detail. All he could do was smile lightly and push off of the counter and follow him. He might not have been allowing Dean to cuddle with him yet, but he didn’t want him to have to fall asleep alone, either.
Sure enough, Havoc had a field day bouncing all over the house, never settling on one toy for more than three or four seconds. He tried out all three beds and chose the fluffiest one, which made Dean nudge Cas. “Told you. Our child likes comfort.”
“Are you sure? I mean… you ignored all my messages for over six years,” Dean jokes, bumping Cas softly with a grin. “Of course I’ll move back in, Jask and Ares will be thrilled.”
“Nothin’ wrong with a little edging.” He gripped the counter as his eyes raked his body. “It was nice to have you fresh in my mind for round two. The dream was already fading away.”
Bottoming out felt like Heaven on Earth, and Cas dropped down to steal a kiss as he rolled his hips to press impossibly deeper.
So what, maybe he stuck his ass out further than necessary, but he wasn’t playing nice this first round.
“Mmm.” Cas reaches through the bars to grab the key, then dangles it in front of Dean’s face. “Then come in here.”
“I’m not a prude, Dean. You don’t need to be embarrassed or apologize — this is your house, after all.” He smiled lightly and flipped the pancakes. “And as for the rest… yes to that, as well.” He couldn’t look Dean in the eyes as he said it out of fear that he’d give too much away.
Cas’ jaw went a little slack, and his cheeks flushed. “Yes. It’s working, but I don’t think I’m supposed to admit that.” He looked down at his bags and fidgeted slightly. “Where should I put these? Do you have a guest room?”
“Fuck… okay,” Jask whispered, digging his ass into the mattress as if he were trying to create some distance between their lengths. He flipped them a moment later, sucking on Ares’ collarbone and pinning him to the bed. “I’ll just make the top half of you mine, then.”
He was staring at Cas with an intense expression, and Cas didn’t need to see past the contacts to know what he was thinking. Dean’s voice was rough when he started the lesson, and when he finally turned around to write on the board, Cas could see his damn pantyline.
Their waitress — Madison, by the name tag — nodded and scribbled it down, then took his drink order as well before turning to Dean. She tilted her head a little bit when they made eye contact, but smiled sweetly even as Dean attempted to hide behind his menu. “And were you ready to order, or did you need a few minutes?”
“No complaints here... me likey.” Dean did a little shoulder dance and handed J back his phone. “You sure about this? I mean, what if Ares isn’t down and you gotta go a month without gettin’ laid? Think you can?”
It looked like Cas struggled a great deal with that when he saw Dean, but he nodded and squeezed his eyes shut. “Okay.”
Somehow, it was even sweeter than last time. Maybe it was the lack of alcohol, or maybe it was something else. But as Cas pushed Dean against the wall and deepened that kiss, feeling it to his very toes… he knew he’d keep fucking hitting himself with that hammer if it meant moments like this in between.
Dean shakes his head slightly. “You... wouldn’t believe me. No one ever does, so I learned to just... not say it. I traveled all over the US to where I was needed, and you can’t really have a normal life with all that traveling y’know?”
“Hey, I dress myself. I just never know what to wear or who it’s made by.” Dean ate another bite with a scowl. “And besides, you obviously can’t feed yourself.”
He got annoyed that tears stung his eyes and he jumped up from his desk and walked out of the room without a word. He took a few moments to pull himself together and splashed some water on his face, wondering when the hell he turned into such a damn sap.
From the grip he had on Cas’ thighs, he knew he was in the presence of a guy that loved frottage as much as he did, which only turned him on even more.
“No?” Dean pulled his head back so he could see Cas’ face. It was much too adorable for his walls not being up yet, but he couldn’t pull his eyes away. “I’m not either.“
When Cas wakes up, it takes a moment to remember where he is. He's not sure why, he spends most nights inside the small cell, but still. It's never quite a conscious decision to go there. It just… happens.
to be famous? Dumb question, Dean knew why. Money and attention were addictive, and he’d let it get the best of him for years. He was willing to lose himself to try and remain Michael friggin Havoc, all for money and attention.
“He just never stops. The way he says my name is annoying.” Ares frowned and leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. “Do you have a boyfriend?”
Sure as shit, they had to do the take like six times because Ashton couldn’t get his shit together enough to make them seem like different people. Dean shook his head and wandered off toward the snack table as Ashton got pointers for something that shoulda been simple. He grumbled to himself, “Shoulda given
ice cream, which… he can do. Cas stands abruptly and heads for the door, stopping only long enough to say “thank you” and “goodbye”, then heads straight home.
“Look. I don’t want to fire you. You’re a great cook. But you can not go off on customers. They’re all assholes, especially the rich ones. I personally think they need a good punch to the face — or a spanking if they look as good as Dean — but regardless, it’s our job to serve them.”
Azrian shakes his head with a fond smile. “Maybe you should go join Novak in that cell, Sheriff. Seems like you can use a night in the drunk tank, too.”
the sheriff, and after all, Cas hasn't ever said anything about this when not six sheets to the wind. But not even Dean can be foolish enough to think there's a human being on the planet that wouldn't take him at least once. Dean Winchester isn't the type of man you regret, not when you go into it as willingly as Cas did.
“Killin’ me, handsome.” Dean still shoved two fingers inside to try and keep Jask from burning too much, but he didn’t work him open long, and soon he was sinking inside with a loud groan.
“I know.” Dean cupped his chin and kissed his lips softly. “If you ever wanna just come home, just come. I’ll be here waitin’. You got this. I’m gonna miss you, this house won’t feel the same.”
It's hard not to notice the way Azrian’s staring at him. He'd be lying to himself if he didn't admit he was at least a little interested, and Az gives off such strong bottom vibes that he knows he won't have to worry about it. The thought is definitely tempting.
and pretty soon… it might as well have been Cas’ last meal. Every time Dean tried to move or buck up, Cas pinned him down and sucked harder, faster, moving his tongue and bobbing his head as his free hand twisted over the shaft.
Dean shook his head quickly and spread his legs further, bracing his hands on the wall on either side of his head to rock back on Cas’ finger. “M’all yours, Cas. Fuck, anywhere, you know that.”
Winchester stepped between them and slapped a paper down on Ashton’s desk, his finger pointing toward the top. “You spelled your own name wrong, bud. Not really sure how you managed that one, but I’m pretty sure you can handle picking Cas’ book up for him. Pretty clumsy of you to knock somethin’ off a desk three feet from you.” He slid Cas’ homework assignment onto his desk, giving Cas his first real look at those glorious hands. “We’re good here, yeah? No issues?”
He stuffs two fingers between Dean’s teeth to keep him silent as he hammers in, that thick cock splitting him open so completely that he probably couldn't have said much, anyway.
“Not stoppin’ baby, gonna come on my cock?” It had been a while since Jask had come untouched, but Dean loved it every time he did. He was sprinting toward the finish line himself but Jask coming just from being fucked was sure to shove him over.
Cas nodded, not letting go. “Yes, but it was also based on you being in the closet. Since you’re not any longer, my guess is he found a way out of it.” He pulled back just enough to look at Dean. “You have nothing to be embarrassed about… or, at the very least… if
His hips cant off the bed as he chases a phantom touch, and it's been so long since he's felt real, tangible hands on him that it's hard to recreate the feeling. He slides his own palm down and grips his length as the Dean in his mind wraps his mouth around it. That pretty, sassy, incorrigible mouth sinks lower until Cas’ cock is sheathed entirely, and the moan he lets out rivals Azrian’s.
“Ahh, the only man around with morals stronger than his boners. Good for him, and good for you for finding him.” Jask got up when the delivery guy knocked on the door, then grabbed the food and came back inside. “Want a beer?”
Cas considered lying simply to facilitate the conversation, but that would be unfair to both of them. “No, I don’t. I haven’t actively dated anyone in quite some time, and my last serious relationship ended about five years ago.”
He slides his hand along the rough fabric until he's gripping Dean’s crotch, and what he finds there only makes him want it more. He makes a show of leaning forward to grab another roll to cover up the way his body moves when he starts to palm him.
Bracing himself on the counter, Ares fought every urge to run to Jask or jack off in the kitchen. He wanted him, no, needed him. Needed to feel his strength and more importantly, that cock.
“See what?” Cas asks with a sly smile, then begins to drive before Dean can even realize he's in the wrong seat. “Are you ready? We need to go get Miracle and then we're going on a little bit of a trip.”
“Nah. I'm too big to walk on water, I just sink right to the bottom every time I try.” The grin Jask flashes him is so adorable that Cas actually laughs.
“I’m definitely the lucky one there, J.” He frowned, thinking of Ares hurting Cas in any way. “That doesn’t really make me feel better, actually. I don’t want him to get dumped when I’m not there to be there for him.”
Hera made a crude joke about dildos that had his water coming out of his nose, but after that, their conversation flowed easily. He’d missed these talks with her and by the end of their lunch, he realized just how badly he’d been neglecting her. “We should do this again soon.”
Dean nodded and wiped his cheek but kept his face in Cas’ chest. “Adam told me he had them and I couldn’t look at them. I wish I did. I feel like I just lost them again. Is that dumb?”
Dean smiled and tossed a heavy leg over Cas’ body. “Mmm, how ‘bout now?” He grinned to himself when he felt Cas squirm under him.
“You’re ridiculous. You’ve never given yourself enough credit, Cas. You’re absolutely stunning, inside and out. He’s a lucky guy.” Ares smiled warmly at him. “Are you going to finally fuck when you go back?”
“Oh, so you’re admitting you’re gonna steal things from me, huh?” Dean grinned a little wider and moved closer, covering himself with the other half of the blanket. “How nice of you to warn me.”
Christmas break was probably the best time of Cas’ life. He spent most of his time with Dean, and the few nights he spent at home felt wrong. If it was up to him, he would have moved in already. Aunt Amara assumed things were going extremely well with Benny, and Cas let her believe that.
Jask picked him up again and carried him back to the bed, carefully laying him down and hovering over him as Ares continued to kiss his skin. He eventually stopped, allowing Jask to roll next to him with a sated, happy smile. “That’s a first for me… but I kinda liked it.”
Dean rolled Cas onto his back and started kissing his neck. “I need to thank you for this mornin’, that okay?” He kissed again, sucking a small mark while he waited for Cas’ answer.
“Dean,” he growls, fisting his hands in Dean's sweats and pulling them together. “Tell me I can have you... right now.”
He made it to his room quickly and stripped, stepping into the shower before the water was even warmed up. After the near-awkwardness of last time, Cas desperately wanted a release before he was forced to listen to Dean have sex again. His mind wandered right back to Dean’s ‘yes, sir’ and his imagination took over as he stroked himself, wondering what Dean would sound like if Cas actually
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he was woken up to the alarm sounding and a crash. It wasn’t the first time someone would have broken into Dean’s house. But the last time, Cas had caught them before they actually got inside. He got out of bed and ran out to the front room, where Cole had someone pinned up against the wall.
With a pout, Dean turned to Cas and gripped his shirt, pulling him in to kiss him again. “You better say some incredibly cheesy shit out there, Cas. If J isn’t throwing up all over the floor by the end of it, we’re not doing our jobs.”
There were few aspects of Cas’ job that he enjoyed less than being on set with Dean. It was boring and seemingly never-ending; he honestly didn’t know how anyone found acting to be an enjoyable career path.
Jask got a little harder and a little closer, but tilted his head with a slight smirk. “Not gonna call me your pretty little whore this time?”
“He’s Sammy’s best friend. He’s a real douche. You’ll probably meet him eventually.” Dean lays his head back against the seat and smiles at Cas. “Tell me more about you.”
crazy.” He took another bite and then checked his phone again. “How do people even date these days?”
professional. He already had to be hidden. He already had to ignore the fact that everyone around Dean had stupid heart eyes at him while he walked around letting everyone believe he was single.
His expression didn’t change. “Okay… why’s that so bad? You’re gonna get about five thousand wedding gifts and it’s not like you gotta fuck her, right?”
Dean wakes up the next morning back in his bed with no memory of actually getting there. He sits up, surprised when he's not sore at all — and then wonders if what happened last night was just a dream. He touches his neck and can feel the tenderness of the hickey Cas left and smiles to himself.
She squealed, and Cole didn’t let up at all. “Oh... em... gee! I’m so sorry, I didn’t know you were home! I just... ow!”
“Charles?” She makes her way out from the kitchen with a sandwich already made. “You didn’t come home last night, Dear. I was worried.”
“Let me help you.” Dean walked over and gently grabbed the ties from Cas’ hands. “I got you, sweetheart. All you gotta do is ask.”
Dean’s eyes darted down to their hands and he brought them up to kiss his knuckles, then looked back at the tv and broke the spell. Cas could tell he didn’t want to pressure him, and half of him was grateful, but the other half…
They changed quickly, not hiding anything from each other, and then crawled into bed. Jask’s dimples stood out as he smiled and opened his arms, and when Ares rolled against him, Jask wrapped him up. “I’m actually a little offended that you fit so well.”
little Seger probably did, too, but Cas didn’t confirm. “There’s nothing wrong with that, and that’s why we have porn, right?”
He knows he doesn't have much time. Dean and Azrian will be done soon, Gabriel can't be trusted to be in charge for long, and he doesn't trust
When it was finally over and Sam got the hint from Dean’s epic bitchface, he finally shut the car off. “Don’t lie to me, Dean. You love it.”
Dean wouldn’t be home for another hour, so Cas used the time to try and get the chubby little guy acquainted with the townhouse, and then cooked dinner. He had it on the table as usual when Dean stepped through the door, and a smile spread across his face at the completely confused look on Dean’s.
“That was the best shit I seen all year. Course I coulda helped you, but the internet was out.” Dean shrugged and walked back out to the patio, leaving Cas’ throw pillow on the floor.
He wasn’t ready to let go now that he had him, so he pulled their bodies together and smiled down at him, waiting for him to open his eyes. “I got you, Ares. Not gonna let you fall.”
Cas bit his lip when Dean stared down at his pink lingerie and from that look alone he felt his skin beginning to heat up. “You like?”
bad… he’s obviously in last night's clothes, it’s obvious he just got laid and is making his way back to the only bar in this neighborhood. Maybe his shirt is a little wrinkled and his jeans… he forgot about the drink his date spilled on him. Okay, so maybe Dean
Cas had spent the last several years priding himself on the fact that he could be whatever Dean needed him to be. He just wasn’t sure he was prepared to add
Cas stared at where their fingers interlocked and nodded a couple of times, almost unsure. “I did, I did do that. Thank you, Dean.” His cheeks flushed and he pointedly looked at the screen, but held a little tighter.
“Ah shit, Cas...” Dean whispered, his eyes slamming shut. “So fucking good.” He began to rock into Cas’ mouth slowly as his left hand fisted in Cas’ hair.
After a quick dinner, he finally decided to start exploring. Most of the castle had been renovated for modern living, but a majority of the lighting still came from the windows which meant he carried a flashlight with him the whole way.
guy. Just looking into your green eyes in person…” Casey trailed off, staring dreamily into his eyes.
Dean opened his eyes and bore into Cas’, rooting them both to the spot. “Okay... I want more. More than just sex and jokes. I want passion... I want... love.” He blushed, and Cas nearly kissed him right then.
Sam shakes his head. “They worked out a few years ago that it was a barber. Can't prove it, of course… but sounds more
“And for me?” Cas was looking down but finally met Dean’s eyes. “I didn’t know you talked to her about it. She didn’t tell me.”
“Cas… Castiel.” Ares blinks, his expression going a little slack. “Castiel Novak? Blue eyes, dark hair? Lives right here in Lebanon?”
“Fuck yeah, hold it steady so I can sink down.” As soon as Cas was lubed and ready, Dean finally sank down on Cas, groaning at the stretch when he pushed past his tight muscles.
He shifted, licking his lower lip. “I’d prefer if you didn’t invite him to be rough with you, some people take that a little too seriously and there’s only so much I can gauge from a person with a single interview.”
He started browsing small, self-catering castles and came across about a dozen potential hits. If he was going to be dropping a ton of money, he wanted to make sure the place he picked was perfect, and started perusing the websites for each one to look at reviews and photographs.
Cas kept going until Dean was grunting and arching off the bed, then abruptly pulled his hand back. “I thought you’d have learned by now to be nicer about it.” He wiped his lubed hand on his dress pants and walked back over to his gun, field stripping it.
Dean huffs. “To be honest, there wasn’t a lot of downtime with my job. It completely took over my life, so when I came here... I realized that I never really took the time to just enjoy life. It’s too late now, but... I dunno, maybe when I’m out I’ll find something I'm good at that isn’t hustling pool. Speaking of, is there a pool table here?”
The friction caused Ares to groan and grind down. It was obvious he craved more, but all that did was make him kiss Jask more desperately.
Dean’s smile widened and he leaned in closer to cheers. “How about dinner tomorrow? My place. A real home cooked meal, not barbeque.” He winked, and it was over. Castiel was hooked.
With that in mind, Cas knows he's only got a day max before he needs to return. He teleports himself out of the prison and to the top of a mountain he used to frequent back before he found his calling. The view is just as gorgeous as he remembers, but there's something… missing this time, and he can't quite place it.
Woody pushed his spent cock further in and deepened the kiss as his left hand gripped Cas’ hair to keep him there.
Dean stayed down there, staring up at Cas for far too long before he finally stood and walked over to his suitcase.
Now, since they’d avoided spending time alone as much as possible yesterday, they’d accomplished absolutely everything they’d needed to do that weekend and were faced with a day of nothing but each other. Cas already felt guilty. He knew Dean wanted a release, and while he
He searched for an hour before he realized he was not going to find the damned thing, and even looked around for his phone to call his phone. That was the moment he realized he was probably too drunk and should just go to bed. He’d find it in the morning.
All he could smell was Dean’s body wash, and he immediately forgot why he was staring into a half-empty bag of flour. “Um... yes?” He flicked his eyes up and then stood back, clearing his throat and grabbing the filling. “We have a couple of minutes before they get on screen, but... did you decide which flavor you want to bake and which one you wanted to use on each other?”
Dean couldn’t fight the huge smile as the plan finally fell into place, and if he didn’t have to grab something from the store, he would have taken Cas right then to propose. “I uh... I gotta... go do something. Don’t put on PJ’s yet, I’ll come back and pick you up.” He turned and rushed to find his keys and Cas tilted his head in that adorable way.
Cas tried his best to steel his facial expression, but he had a terrible feeling that he didn't quite hide the jealousy in his eyes.
get laid? How’d you meet the aardvark?” Dean paced his hotel room after the event, stripping off his dumb fancy suit. It had been too damn long since he released some tension, and it was really showing in his mood.
His blush returned, bringing out his gorgeous freckles in the morning sunlight and he chuckled. “Uh... sorry. I had a really good dream. Couldn’t help myself.”
“Good thing I get to see you two weeks in, huh?” Jask asked, playfully biting Dean’s lip. “I feel like something like this should involve some sappy ‘I love you’ goodbye, so… should we lie to each other for the sake of making fun of chick flicks?”
The thoughts of his fellow Marines led him to one in particular, and he picked his phone up as he adjusted the tongue ring in his mouth and called one of his oldest friends. Two rings in, she answered. “Hello, Duma.”
They were both leaking, rocking against each other and panting as Cas twisted his hand, then finally adjusted his position so he could use both. His abs strained with the effort to keep him upright, but it was worth it - having their cocks encased fully felt so good that Cas was having a hard time staying quiet.
If he were still capable of English, he’d have said something in return. But Dean felt so good inside of him, filling him completely, hitting every right spot - that all he could manage were clipped words from the other languages he knew. “Tellement bon… foirfe… non fermarti…” He bit his lip and focused on Dean’s face, moving his hand out of the way to stroke himself as he moved faster and Dean began fucking up into him.
more than once, and I told him that you deserved better than him.” So many things made sense. Dean’s coldness to him while Jaskier was there, the irritation when he left. “I was off duty, completely, for the first time in months. I had my shirt off and my tongue ring in because I didn’t want the hole to close. He took one look at me, and not even three minutes later he was asking me if I was sure I wasn’t a switch.” Cas closed his eyes, knowing he should’ve told Dean sooner. “I’m sorry.”
“No, it’s alright.” Cas watched him fondly as Jask dragged out the poker chips and cards. “But, I will ask that you don’t beat me too badly… I don’t actually know how to play poker.”
“Damn. Like high school in here, huh?” Dean stands taller and sees he’s much bigger than Ishim. “Nah, that was a one time offer, guy.”
Dean has to take a bite to stifle his moan. “Food is so good.” He does a thumbs up to Astarte and blushes.
Havoc jumped onto his lap, and Cas scratched behind his ears as he waited for Dean to join him on the front porch. The snow had finally made its way out and given way to the faintest hints of spring. It was unusually warm for the season, which was something they planned on taking full advantage of.
“Hey... I know my way around some meat.” Dean winked and walked over with his food to sit on their patio chair.
Everyone stared at Sam, waiting for him to actually say the name. When he didn’t, Cas prodded, “What were the stories about?”
“What brings you to gym class, Dean?” Cas sat two rows below him and looked off like he wasn’t talking to him.
She sighed. “Of course you would, Castiel. It’s your training... and your heart. Have you considered what I said last time? Quitting and finding someone new to guard? You’re torturing yourself.”
“Yes. Hoping this helps,” Henry joked. “I’ll watch out, just don’t take too long.” He nodded and stood near the door.
Cas’ smile went from huge to barely there as that last text came in. He’d already been fired once, bringing someone into Ashton’s house when he was supposed to be on duty would absolutely get him fired again. He knew he should tell Dean no, tell him to wait, to pick another night.
man, I beg to differ.” Cas had had more to drink than any of them, and quickly copied Ares’ movements as he straddled Dean, looking him in the eyes. “I told you no, right? If I didn’t, I am now. No. He can’t have you.”
He clicked on it and laughed, reading aloud: “Dean says I don’t have a personality outside of sex, but he’s wrong. I’m adorable and hilarious. And I work private security, so I can keep you safe… wow, I suck at these. Okay, maybe he’s right.” Cas shook his head and looked up at Ares, seeing an opportunity. “I think they matched us wrong, you’re the one with the suit kink.”
Cas couldn’t breathe as the words registered in his mind and started making sense. He turned his head, finally looking at Dean, and licked the corner of his mouth. “Your dream was about me?”
“And then showin’ me. I didn’t even imagine facefucking you all the time, it was mostly you takin’ what you want and swallowing my come like it’s your last... fucking meal on Earth.”
They had a date later, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t be lazy for a few hours. He grabbed his ‘breakfast in bed’ currency and set it on Cas’ pillow, then tucked his head under his own.
Dean huffs and then climbs on Cas’ lap like he isn’t a full grown man, nuzzling into his neck. “Thought you were gonna make me walk of shame outta here,” he mumbles against his skin. “Yeah, course I’ll stay.”
about to reach out and hug him, but didn’t. “Yeah, okay then. If you change your mind, you know how to reach me.”
“Don’t get ahead of yourself, Dean.” Cas smirked and finished what he started with that first solid ball, grinning to himself and glancing back at him. “Maybe I just needed to warm up?” He looked back at the table again and paced around it, dragging the stick as he searched for a decent angle. His face got progressively more bitchy when he realized he didn’t have a good one and ended up wasting the shot.
Dean nodded and climbed back in. Soaked boxers be damned, he would never pass up an opportunity to be in Cas' arms. He turned so Cas could hold him this time and it felt so good Dean's chest tightened. "Thanks, Cas." he whispered.
He had a towel wrapped around his waist and eyed Cas like he could see right through him. “What’s wrong?”
“About the bed situation. You know you like mine more, let’s sleep in there tonight.” Dean nearly asked Cas to move into his room, but knew he shouldn’t yet.
Cas smiled, even after recognizing the separation. He was used to Ares not wanting to cuddle, but had hoped his efforts with cooling down the room would help. “Yes, I’ll try and stay quiet down here, sleep as long as you need to. I’ll be here when you wake up.” He kissed him briefly, then glanced toward the refrigerator. “Did you eat? You should eat before you lie down.”
“Maybe. But I grabbed towels for that reason. Just keep him on your lap and we’ll be fine.” Cas reached over to pet his ears and drove home. “I think he’s going to love his new home.”
It wasn’t as though Cas wasn’t aware Dean cared for him, it was evident enough in their day to day life. But all of that? It sounded like once upon a time, Dean had had an actual crush on him, which was kind of disappointing. Not because Cas didn’t want it to be true, but because back in high school,
He steels his resolve and pushes the door open again, his heart dropping out of his ass when he sees Cas sitting on the floor with his wings drooped at his sides. Dean doesn’t speak right away. He can't. He walks over and sits across from him with his legs crossed and he scratches his head, not sure how to navigate any of this. “Sorry I left. Just uh… startled the shit outta me, honestly.”
“It’s been weeks Cas, weeks. I can’t sit around waitin’ on Jask when I have limited time as is. How do
She hugged him again, holding on this time and tucking her head against his chest. “If you need anything from me, don’t hesitate to ask. You were the only one I had when I was a kid thrown into this very adult world, and if I can return that favor now… I will.” She looked up, kissing his chin. “I’m really proud of you, Dean. It takes a lot of balls to do what you’re about to do.”
Dean looks confused and slightly taken aback, but Cas doesn’t miss the look in his eyes and it’s obvious no one’s ever cared enough to ask him such a question. “Uh... Sammy. But he was drunk, so...” Dean shrugs.
“Enemies? Little young to have enemies. Who are you talking about?” Dean frowned at the thought, but realized he needed to keep a stoic demeanor with kids like this. Any wrong question or facial expression could shut them down in an instant. He was no Novak with the counseling, but he tried to pay attention. Before Ares could answer, he noticed two girls arguing a few feet behind them. “Excuse me.” Dean jogged over to see what the problem was.
“Can I have a bite? I’ll share my sucker.” He bit his lip and twirled it toward his history teacher. “I don’t have cooties.”
Cas plopped up at the bar and texted Abby that he was there. Benny spotted him right away and walked over with his favorite beer. “Getting lots of tips, Ben?” He grabbed the beer with a small smile and took a drink.
with. He didn’t think that was possible for him, so he never gave it much thought before this. But he’s also aware that this makes him vulnerable. The thought of Cas ever walking out has something tightening in his chest and he pulls away his hand, not wanting to get too invested. He can’t. They
”Every day of my life,” he says quietly. “The saddest part of it is that I don't want it to stop. I'm terrified it's going to stop, and one day I'll wake up and forget what he looked like.”
He chews instead of answering for a while. Dean can feel the shift in the air, but it's not unusual for Cas — not when he's asked a question he doesn't want to answer. “Not really. Still bored, still sad, still drunk. How are you?”
That seemed like a small price to pay for the reward, and Dean wasn’t about to argue. “Cas, I’ll buy you a hundred calendars if it means we get to do this again at some point. Fuck, I’ll buy you a whole new desk. Whatever you want.”
Smiling wider, Jask laughed and reached up to high-five him. “You fucked him? Good for you, D. Ares gave in easier than I thought… and fuck, it’s awesome.”
“Ahh, that makes sense. Do you… want to talk about anything?” Cas eyed him warily and continued before Dean even had a chance to respond. “I want to apologize. The things I said in the boat… I’m sorry. I know you were just trying to help.”
When Dean got off work, his entire body ached. Working as a home repairman had its easy breezy days, but every so often, he’d get a call to damn near redo someone’s entire bathroom with the amount of work they needed. He always left them with a friendly reminder that regular maintenance was key. So many jobs were completely preventable if people just kept up with it — but then again, those people were why he made such good money, so he really couldn’t complain.
Dean smirked. “He’d probably be more embarrassed if he was the only one. He was definitely the first, but
“No wonder you said Ares is your type, then. If ‘nice ass’ and ‘nice car’ are the only criteria…” Cas smirked, knocking his kneecap against Dean’s chest.
Dean mumbled something but instantly fell in line. Cas was so close he could smell him and those damned green eyes were ridiculously intoxicating. Not to mention
The guy behind the counter is tall, dark, and delicious — but Dean didn't come to flirt, he came for pie. Removing his hat, Dean walks over and looks in at all the empty pans with a look of mock betrayal. “Where’s the loot, buddy?!”
The concept was almost laughable, Cas hadn’t had a social life since he was still in his twenties. “Nothing worth noting, I assure you. It’s mostly TV dinners and docuseries, but I do get wild occasionally and actually go outside. I don’t suppose you have much free time at all.”
is the thing that most often bridges the gap between platonic and romantic love. Without passion, well… this is strictly off the record, as I’m delving into areas of conjecture here, but… I’ve never seen a romantic relationship go the distance without some base level of raw, ever-kindling passion.”
“You’re incredible. Seriously, unbelievably incredible.” Cas let out a sated breath and dropped his eyes to the lowest point on Dean he could actually see. “Are you hard for me?” Soft fingers stroked Dean’s cheek. “Do you want my mouth again?”
Dean woke up first — thanks to Mother Nature — and made his way to clean up in the bathroom. Cas was still asleep, probably because of the broken ass sleep he’d had the past few days.
Cas tilts his head and repeats the question telepathically to Miracle, who makes a sound suspiciously close to a laugh. “
“Jody told me they’ve got someone lined up to fill that open handler spot. Just double-checkin’, you sure we can’t go for two?”
Cas only dozed off for an hour before he woke up. He moved so he could see Dean’s face and watched him sleep for an hour more, counting each freckle like he had done so many times before.
He was happy he thought to put on a shirt and pants though, because he ran smack into Adam’s wife when he exited the bathroom. “Oh shi...oot. Hi, kids.” His nephew Jesse waved and Claire hid behind Kate’s leg.
hookers. We both know this is a front and you’re absolutely a pimp.” He takes another bite to keep from laughing.
“Of course not. You just saved me.” Dean cupped his chin and ran his hand through his hair. “You’re also beautiful, so that helps.” He chuckled and laid his head back down. “What year is it?”
Cas shoves him playfully with an embarrassed grin, then goes over to pick up the box. “I can make bacon just fine when I'm not so thoroughly distracted.”
By Saturday, Dean was damn horny again. What was it about this guy that had Dean so hooked already. Was it the mystery? The taboo? That perfect mouth and the way he worked a dick? He wasn’t sure, but whatever it was, he was missing it. He set aside the third wrench he snapped since starting this damn project and wiped his hands on his coveralls.
Cas helped straighten up the room, and watching him sliding up sweatpants over that pink lace had Dean biting his lip. Cas walked over to sit in a desk while Dean put back the papers that fell, and he looked nervous before speaking. “So, um... there’s something else I want to talk about.”
“Dean. Dean, look at me.” Cas waited until he finally made eye contact and let out a slow breath. “You’re good enough, exactly the way that you are. Secrets, no secrets, gay, straight... it doesn’t matter. You are enough, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.”
Every part of Castiel wants to say yes, but this isn't how he wants to truly start things off. He pulls Dean in and hugs him, memorizing every curve of his muscular body just in case things don't go the way he wants them to. “No. Meet me at the diner in the morning. Ten o’clock? We’ll talk then, when we’re both sober.”
Dean leans over and nips Cas’ hip. “Thanks. I’ll hurry.” He kisses his lips softly and strips on the way to the shower, jumping in before he could run back to the bed and hop on Cas’ cock.
It took everything to keep his mouth shut. Dean could feel how close they were to actually fucking and he knew one bratty remark could push things back to step one. He bit his lip in effort to be good and bucked his hips upwards. Cas grabbed his right hip with his free hand and pinned him back down, sliding up and down his length two more times before finally pulling off with a flushed smile.
For a moment, Jask considered arguing with him after the insults, but one look at Dean’s naked body had him nodding like an idiot and dropping to his knees in front of him. However, he did have one little punishment at his disposal. “Surprise, you get to use your own hands. My face will be here for the cleanup.” He smiled cheekily, sitting back on his heels and getting comfortable.
The girl she’d been greeting came over, hugging them both and making small talk for way too damn long. When she finally walked away, Jo pulled Dean further into the shadows. “Sounds like you should be asking
Blue eyes raked down his body and Cas visibly shivered. “You… oh. What was the question, again? I’m sorry.”
He didn’t have the luxury of hiding his blush that time. He nodded, licking his bottom lip slowly. “Yes, I did. After what I assume was a pang of jealousy toward the girl in your bed, I nearly tripped over my own feet trying to get to the bathroom. It was… still shiny. I… came all over the back of the toilet thinking about you buried inside of me and not someone else.”
“Wait, didn’t we go see a scary movie with like seven other people on our first date?” Dean thought back to sophomore year and smiled.
They finished their breakfast and made their way to the couch, both of their faces glued to screens. It took a while, but Dean came across an old bank that sounded exactly like what they were looking for. “Check this out. You can solve mysteries to make it to different vaults in this creepy old bank.” He handed Cas the phone.
Cas was impressed, but shook his head. “Both are already well-accepted methods.” He kept eating, pushing the food around on his plate. “I’ll figure it out. I have all semester.”
Jask smacks the side of his head. “Yes, but I'm serious, D. Don't. You can have any of the other groomsmen. You can fuck his dad for all I care, just keep your
Havoc farted loudly on Cas’ lap and Duma started laughing. “Castiel!” She laughed again. “You do need some time off.”
In the end, he didn’t care if they understood or not. Jask didn’t want to hurt anyone, but he was crazy about Ares and it had barely been a week and a half. He needed more of him every single day, and despite how amazing Dean was, Jask had never felt that way about him. He owed it to himself, and to everyone else, to see things with Ares through.
He licked his lip slowly and grinned. “What? I sweat. You should stretch.” Cas bent down to stretch out, touching his toes a few times and then straightening out and bouncing in place. “Let’s go. I’ll take it easy on you.” He opened the door and took a look around, not sensing any immediate threats or any potential hazards. It was getting dark, so they’d have that on their side soon enough.
Thursday, Dean was tired. He’d been up half the night with nightmares about getting caught fucking Cas, which led to a
Dean huffs a laugh and shoves him off softly. “Yeah, see… tried that and got told to leave. Kinda not ready to be sent to my room again.” He avoids Cas’ eyes because he knows that was childish, but he couldn’t stop his stupid mouth from talking.
Now that he’d found the damn profile, he didn’t know what to do with it. He chuckled to himself at how silly it had been to even look for it, and swiped right just because he could. He pocketed his phone just as Dean finally slid off the bed with that ridiculous modesty pouch and high-fived one of the cameramen.
Dean follows and climbs inside, fumbling with his keys. “Speaking of the whole top/bottom thing. How’d you know?” He looks over with his
“Well, how about you stop feeling that way so someone can love you, Dean. How can you accept love if you don’t accept the fact that you’re
Benny scoffed and rolled onto his back. His apartment wasn’t the nicest, but it beat jacking off at home. “A man always knows when his partner is thinkin’ bout somebody else. Especially when they’re inside them.”
Cas wasn’t sure how he was supposed to stop himself from begging to be touched, but that… was surprisingly enough. He lowered his forehead to Dean’s shoulder and sucked in a breath, content to stay there until someone made him move. “I don’t know how we got here… but I’m glad we did.”
“That’s a good idea. Make it your own. What are you thinking? Classy colors, or going full gay with some purple walls?” She laughed at her joke and choked on her chow mein.
Dean had pictured Cas while jacking off before, but never when he was actually getting fucked. And how fast he came after picturing a tatted Cas should have been embarrassing.
“Sounds like what we need. We need a group of ten, though.” His eyes continued to flick down the screen. “And someone to make sure no one cheats. I bet my father would do it, he’s been home for a couple of weeks now.”
Jask screwed up his face and shook his head. “No way, after a shower, or not at all. Take it or leave it, cowboy.”
He glanced up from his phone with a small smile and saw Dean watching him, then looked back at his phone to read Nick’s reply.
“I agree.” Dean pulled him in and kissed him, his hands running through his hair as he rutted forward. “I miss you.”
It was an extremely good thing Dean was wearing contacts. He clenched his jaw, praying he kept his own mouth shut.
The distance between them lessened as Cas stepped forward. “I didn’t leave on purpose, Dean. I was reassigned, you
“Me too.” Ares went on his tippy toes and nipped his ear. “But we can do something if you want.” He bit harder and darted toward the bedroom, but barely made it through the door before Jask was scooping him up and throwing him onto the bed face down.
Dean tugged harder as his hips thrust up. “Fu- Cas!” He held Cas in place and spilled down the back of his throat.
“Not goin’ anywhere, Cas. I may not have went to therapy, but — I mean I kinda did because Ares was always around and talking and stuff but... I wasn’t coping well either. I— I haven’t had one relationship since you. I couldn’t... none of them were you.”
“You think I’m wearing those?” Cas cackled dramatically, earning himself a shove. “I plan on being naked... in my boyfriend's bed.”
“I've only actually been in A for about six months. I almost died over in C, and when I woke up, I was here. But no, not since moving over here.” He steps a little closer to Dean and cocks his head to the side with a tiny little smirk. “Why, are you offering?”
“Oh, shi—” Cas closed his eyes and groaned so loud Dean clasped a hand over his mouth. Their bodies moved lazily together as they came down and any other noises were swallowed up by Dean’s mouth.
Cas could see he held onto every word and was sadly disappointed when he spoke. “Of course not. I just heard the song this morning. I think I should get to class.”
“Fair enough,” Gad says, picking up his own tools and working under the hood. “I don't think it needs much… just the motor swapped and a good once-over. Between the two of us, I bet we’ll have it road-worthy again by the end of the week.”
Dean made their drinks and got stopped multiple times on his way back. One girl outwardly flirted with him knowing Jo was outside, and it made him laugh. Jo could kick her ass if she actually cared. He made his way back with overflowing cups. “Bottoms up,
Ares was excited about this date and went all out with decorations and old timey liquor. There was already music playing in the background, and Jask held out a box of cigars. “What’s buzzin’, cousin? Take off them stompers and come on in.”
“C’mon, Cas. Thought you knew what you were gettin’ into. You remember what I said I wanted?” He tried to turn and peek at Cas’ face but his grip was sound.
“I honestly don’t know yet, Dean. It’s too soon, and I think we’re only seeing half of the story so far.” He ate another fry and took a sip. “I’m always on high alert when it comes to you, so if it makes you feel better… my personal response to this won’t change either way.”
He came hard, holding Dean’s head with both hands and shoving himself down Dean’s throat as he emptied, groaning his name so loudly it was all Dean could hear.
Dean wipes his face and nearly charges back in but instead turns and goes where Frenchie wants. He definitely doesn’t want him as an enemy. The moment the door swings shut, Frenchie backs him up against the wall.
“You should see... yourself. Fuck!” Cas groaned so loudly as he released he knew there was no way no one heard, but he also didn’t care. Watching Dean’s chin and tongue get painted white with his spend sent a shiver up his spine, and Cas had another moment where he couldn’t believe Dean was his.
“You look sexy as hell, Cas. We’re definitely fucking in these later.” Dean winked and opened the door to make their way to their friends’ house.
Cas stared at Dean’s foot and nearly told him to move it, but this was Dean’s house, and Cas didn’t exactly have the right to tell him which pieces of furniture he could defile. Particularly because Cas was daydreaming about defiling a lot of
Cas was alone there, Cole had gone home. Leaving Dean vulnerable so he could hide a body wasn’t an option, and letting Dean tag along and witness him murder someone wasn’t on the table either. He had no choice but to watch that naked bastard round the corner back into the lobby.
Dean sat in his living room with Benny and Jody, planning the next charity event. They were boring, but basically in the damn job description of being a celebrity. Jo would be his date, of course, but all that did was remind him of his lack of
“I guess that depends on what happens next, honestly.” Cas’ chest tightened with apprehension, but before he could get an answer, Cole walked in.
The problem was, Dean already liked Jask as much as he believed he could. It wasn’t love, that was for sure. The guy was fun and a good lay, he got along with his dog and got all Dean’s movie references. But as much as all of that was nice, they didn’t have that
Cas didn't instantly come, and that was okay. Dean wasn't surprised that he needed a moment to decide whether this was a good idea or not, but when he finally did walk up behind him, Dean smiled to himself as the water cascaded down his body. "Hi."
“Just spreading my oats, Doc. Was this grown adult one of your patients? Cause if they were, I’m callin’ PETA on your ass.”
Something about the news that the most attractive man on planet Earth thought he was hot seemed to short out his brain, and Cas froze with the fork about an inch from his open mouth. Blinking, he realized he probably looked like a dumbass and finished the movement. “Sometimes I think I’m secretly crazy, I’m not sure if that counts or not.”
“All jobs have some kinda break. Just... relax and if anything happens, go back on duty. Would you feel better if we watched the security footage with some popcorn?”
Cas set his phone aside and finished the episode. He was already attached to the direwolves and he had a bad feeling about them.
Dean smiled softly. He’d be lying if he didn’t admit that was the choice he wanted Cas to make. “You’ve got my full support either way, Cas. I’d stick with you no matter what.”
Things with Cas were going better than he ever could have imagined. They were still completely obsessed with one another, but he truly hoped that would never fade. During the week they went on another date for the project. It was a simple; ‘pick out your favorite childhood book and read together’ type deal, but Dean thinks he should have gotten extra credit for acting out Max in ‘Where The Wild Things Are’. Cas’ favorite book turned out to be some holographic number called ‘Ghost Train’, which didn’t seem all that appropriate for kids but sure explained a lot about him as a person.
Cas nods and draws Dean’s cock out of his pants. “Keep watching. You can come for me whenever you're ready, you don't have to hold back this time.” He leans in and sucks the head into his mouth, swirling his tongue and methodically taking him deeper a little at a time.
Memories of his first month on the job came flooding into his mind, and the reminder that he’d already had to save Dean’s life once made him uneasy. “Maybe I’m just overly cautious after what happened in Plano. I understand the fact that he loves his fans, but some of them love him a little
Cas picked him up off the table until their bodies were flush, and trailed a line of wet kisses across the back of Dean’s shoulder as he fucked him harder, bringing one hand up to his neck and gently squeezing the sides. “You’re beautiful, Dean. All of you.”
“Mr. Kline, I’d like to speak with you about some of your college prospects, would you collect your things?”
“Good boy.” It seemed like that’s what Jask had been waiting for, because he didn’t waste another moment. He slid in slowly, letting Ares adjust, then snapped his hips experimentally.
“Mmhm.” He closes his eyes, losing all sense of the world around them. All that's real is Dean… and despite how mad Cas knows he'll be about it later… right now? He's exactly where he wants to be.
There was a brief moment when Cas regretted his little show. Dean had no idea about any of it and he preferred to keep it that way… but chances were good Dean wouldn’t believe Jaskier anyway. “My job isn’t to be
He pulls the map from the glove box and unfolds it, then sets it between them. “Bobby’s. He actually said something about knowing a place we can stay… some sort of bunker? But we need the key. I'd have just gotten it myself, but he wants to see you.”
“No, no. Pick a car,” Cas said quickly, pulling them to one of the more secluded parts of the parking lot.
The sigh Cas lets out is cute. "Right. Are you ready to go, then?" He walks over, wrapping his arms around Dean and squeezing his ass. "Given the fact that we just had sex twenty minutes ago, I think I can survive until tonight. Maybe."
Quickly, Cas shoved the phone down and looked at Ares with wide eyes. “They want us to come over. Tonight. Now. Should we?”
“Mmhmm.” Dean smiled and kept sucking, happy he could feel Cas chubbing in his mouth, and it didn’t take long before Dean was having trouble fitting him all.
Dean literally drooled as he sped up his hand, his eyes locked on P’s flawless ass and within minutes, Dean was coming. He let his head fall back and sighed before looking down at the mess. He snapped a photo, and sent it to P.
As he walks away, he hears Dean bust up laughing. He only makes it a foot more before someone whistles, and the long haired bodyguard yells an “oi!” to get his attention.
Ares says harshly. “I shouldn't have even told you, I was just so fucking dumbfounded that I couldn't help it. I shouldn't even see him again, it's a conflict of interest a mile wide.”
He was surprisingly less nervous than he anticipated as he pulled into Dean’s driveway. Things with him just seemed
“Yes, but I think I’m caught up for now. I was trying to fill in my notes for the project, but…” he trailed off, licking his lips and avoiding Dean’s gaze. “We should eat first, and then talk about why on earth your job kept you so late tonight.”
Losing himself in the feeling of Dean sliding deeper was easy, but holding himself back was not. He bit Dean’s lip and sucked his tongue as Dean started moving, but Cas wrapped his legs around Dean and flipped them over.
drew an outward reaction. Cas snapped his eyes toward Dean and narrowed them, simultaneously confused and annoyed. “Excuse me?”
If that wasn’t enough to thoroughly embarrass Dean, nothing ever would be. He cleared his throat and squeezed Cas’ hand before letting it go so he could eat, deciding to stuff his face instead of saying something stupid.
“Anytime. You know where to find me.” He stood up and winked, walking Cas to the door. “Have a good one, Cas.”
“Dean, would you breathe? Cas doesn’t care about it being perfect. You know he’s going to say yes.” Sam chuckled, making Dean narrow his gaze.
“Haven’t really got that far. Guess I’m hopin’ people don’t hate me. But I’m not holdin’ my breath. Probably find a hole to climb in until people forget. Then just... live. Be me, whatever that means.” He really had no clue. But living in a damn hole as himself was better than living as Michael Havoc in a fake marriage.
It was hard to hear much of anything other than the hammering of his own heart, but Jask must have agreed, because the front door closed a few moments later. Cas broke away to breathe, but kept his hands fisted in the thin fabric of Dean’s shirt. “So… we live together?”
“Mmhmm.” Dean moved his hips in a circle, his heavy cock bouncing on Cas’ stomach. “Burns so good, Cas.”
“You know it.” Dean grinned, kissing him again. “No one could tell me I couldn’t.” He kept kissing him, and when he dropped Cas off back at his house, they agreed to tell Amara together. Dean drove home, wishing they were at a point where they could already be together without judgement, but went to sleep with a smile on his face.
“Roger that,” Dean said in a deep voice. “Affirmative, we’re all clear, Cole. Do you copy?” he fake-talked into his watch.
“I don’t care. My baby gets what my baby wants, and... well... I had five pies delivered to the house already in case you wanted to leave early.” Cas inhaled Dean’s scent and smiled, knowing exactly what what his baby needed. “Let’s go home and have pie, husband.”
“Yeah. I mean, I don’t wanna make you uncomfortable or anything, so we can just see what happens... but if I cross any lines when I’m asleep, just kick me.” He kept their hands together while he pulled Cas along to the room.
Charlie bounded over to snatch one of the files. “Obviously we have to go through the doors, find some clues, then work together to figure it out. That’s how these things work.” She ignored the mocking expression on Jask’s face, then handed three files to each team. “Dean, you guys should figure out the ‘How’, and we’ll figure out ‘Who.’ Sound good?”
“I just find myself struggling not to smell it more, but I’m trying to be respectful.” He took a chance, moving so his foot was resting against Jask’s leg, and grinned. “I can still reach, so I’m not
He took him deeper, gagging slightly but not even pretending to pull back. A single hand slid through the hole to cup his balls, and P squeezed lightly as he sucked him off like he was trying to pull the soul right from his damn body.
“You’re a damn bartender from— whatever. And why’s it seeds anyway? If I’m busting seeds shouldn’t I call a physician for that, too?” Dean starts laughing at the visual and tosses his head back. “You think if we busted a nut and seeds flew out we’d have seed wars, like ‘nah, I can seed further than you, watch’ type competitions?”
Dean hummed like that was a hard decision. “I’m afraid if I get up, you’re gonna disappear or somethin’. But I do love pie…”
“You guys…” Gabe does an obscene hand movement and then tries to give him a high five. “Come on, bro. Live a little.”
“The hell man, you haven’t sent one damn picture. I miss him.” Dean looked around. “Kinda miss you, too.”
Rage coursed through him, not just at the violence, but the slur as well. He dug his knee into the man’s crotch and pinned his arms to the ground, cold fury on his face. “Do you have a problem with
It didn’t deter him in the slightest. Jask bit down gently and slid his hand down to Dean’s ass, squeezing and shaking it. “C’mon. I missed this ass, it was a long day.”
“Oh my god, are they touching the grill? They shouldn’t use fire, Cas. I can hear how trashed they are.” Ares got up and walked over, sliding the door open to reveal Dean and Jask doing exactly that.
“Seriously? Is it like... bad dreams?” Dean met his gaze again. “As long as you don’t jump on my bed and wake me up that way, we’re good. He used to yell it right by my bed just to fuck with me.”
“Alright fine, door number one then. Who knows what room they’d throw me in. Same room, five mins?” Dean doesn’t wait for an answer, just walks out and goes to the room.
The whine was past Cas’ lips before he could stop it. He set the last dish down to dry and ignored how badly his hands — and whole body, for that matter — were shaking, and tried to keep his movements fluid as he finally glanced at Dean. “I promise you, neither you or your subconscious has anything to apologize for.”
Havoc sniffed around the trees, marking the place as his own and Dean pulled out his phone to check on Jo. They hadn’t really spoken in a while, and his decision affected her too. It was selfish of him to come out, but she had his back and he could never express how much that meant to him.
Cas finished his latest novel and took a deep breath. He knew he should feel relieved, or some sense of accomplishment, but writing was the easiest part for him. Editing was horrible, and while he had a professional editor, he preferred to do it himself first in order to turn in the best possible product. It ensured his publisher wouldn’t have to look at the bare bones and see if there was something worth it under the crap, she’d be able to see it right off the bat.
They're barely a half-mile from the prison, but Cas laughs, smiling against his lips and wrapping his arms around him. “You never deserved to be in there, Dean. You're a good man, a
Cas debated on telling Dean he’d see him soon, but something told him this would be worth the wait. “Well, it’s been less than a week.” He stole a kiss and opened the front door. “Think Adam will let you get away with showering with me?”
“No, my other bodyguard is walking the perimeter, he’ll be in here soon, he’ll fill in for two nights. But it’s just you two. I only needed one for a while, still might have to search for a third.”
“I’m in the kitchen!” Cas yelled, and as Dean rounded the corner, Cas turned to him. “I wasn’t sure if you’d have time for an actual hot lunch or not, so I just made you a BLT. Extra bacon.” He slid the plate forward. “You… strike me as the type,” he added, smiling sheepishly.
“Uh huh,” he nodded, ignoring the way his own length was now tenting his sweats from watching Dean. “Gorgeous and all yours, you didn’t even have to put a ring on it.” Jask leaned forward and licked the precome off his tip, but pulled back again. “Sorry. Had to get a taste.”
absolutely doesn’t go to our school — and then before I could walk up and make fun of you, he walked out with the same damn ‘holy shit, I just got laid at school’ look. I just put it all together. You were never this into Benny. You were never actually happy with him, you were content. This is different. You’re in love.”
“Yup. Been a— fuck... been a while. You got some fatass fingers, Butch.” Dean closes his eyes and wonders if he’ll have a single encounter here that he doesn't have to get on board with
A grin spread across his face, and Dean knew that for the time being, that answer was more than good enough. Things were complicated enough without moving in with each other.
Cas’ eyes were wide as he stared at the car. He probably hadn’t even gone outside since they’d arrived, and if he had, it would’ve been while Dean was gone. “She’s beautiful, Dean.”
He's about to say no when that same, massive friend of Ishim’s steps up beside him. “Shed's that way,” he grunts.
enough to stay out of earshot for more than a few minutes at a time… but still. This is a pleasure he hasn't allowed himself in over fifty years, and he wants to enjoy it.
“Got ya, bitches! Get out there and hang some damn streamers, ya horndogs!” She crossed her arms and gave them one of those if-looks-could-kill expressions.
When the last notes of the song trailed off, Cas cleared his throat and took a step closer to Dean’s back. “Only until we’re 70?”
“Yes, I work 12-6 but I’m off tomorrow. You?” Ares interlocked their fingers, just to have some sort of contact as they walked to the kitchen.
“You like when hot guys fight, huh? Too bad I’m older now and only get in like four fights a year.” His eyes darted over to Cas’, and he couldn’t tell if he was joking or not.
They’d reached a point where nothing was quiet. Cas’ hips were smacking loudly against Dean’s ass with every thrust, and Dean’s moans were becoming more pronounced by the second. He was exactly too far gone to care, and when his release ripped through his body, his back arched off the bed and he nearly choked trying to silence his own groan.
“Huh... that’s a good quote.” Dean looked down to pick at some grass while he thought about it. Telling Jask he was gay was unexpected, but was he technically pretending not to be before then? He had never brought it up at work because he was just trying to be professional.
The second Cas said “yes”, Dean was kissing his lips and pushing his pajamas down. He tossed him on the bed with ease and loomed over him with a smirk. “You ready for more, Cas?”
“Of course. That would be fun. And entertaining to watch, sorry... Or almost sorry.” Ares chuckled and grabbed his water.
but there have only been a handful of catastrophes so far this year. Which... is markedly better than last year.” He offered Dean a small, gentle smile and got lost in those green eyes for a moment too long. “How are things with you? Are you coaching at all this year?”
Dean watches them, biting back a grin. When they first got back together, Dean was sad every time he saw them being cute, but now, he’s just happy for them.
Flushing, Cas lowered his face back to Dean’s chest. “That’s just the thing, Dean. I don’t think he will
The second Ares opened his eyes, Jask saw the flame behind his eyes. “Unbutton your shirt, slide down your pants and sit down. Keep the tie on.”
Cas swallowed and nodded, bracing himself for whatever the hell was about to happen. “Tell me. Please.”
“Shit.” Dean cleared his throat. “M’okay. This wasn’t your fault, Cas. You were there right when I needed you. Thank you. No killin’ tho, I need you.”
“Oh, right, you. So, are you just going to stand there and talk shit, or actually do something, tough chick?” Cas raised an eyebrow challengingly, not looking back in Dean’s direction.
“I didn’t mean that with any hidden meaning. Promise. I gotta piss then hit the road, thanks for lunch, Cas.”
“I’ve never met a demon I didn’t like,” Jask said playfully. “Was that your way of telling me she doesn’t bat for my team, and that I should stay away from her?”
When he climbed into the Impala that night, it felt so natural that he knew his eyes were gold as all hell, but he didn’t care. Cas leaned over and kissed him heatedly, making up for being apart all day. Dean lightly grabbed Cas’ hand and brought it to his own crotch, pressing down to make sure Cas could feel exactly how hard he was. “Been thinkin’ about you all day, Cas.”
“Mr. Winchester?” A student named Hael raised her hand. “Was the Battle of Hampton Roads in ‘62 or ‘63?”
Dean looked horrified for a moment at the thought of the poor guy getting fixed, but sighed and nodded, knowing it was for the best. He set Havoc down gently and took Cas’ hand with a pained expression. “Drag me outta here. I don’t wanna leave him.”
Benny joined a moment later, just in time for the lecture. “Dammit, Dean! You just said ‘fuck’… to your fans! They were recording your little Ted Talk, you know that, right? Abaddon is going to flip her lid over this one.”
Brady laughed, and that was probably the only reason the asshat was still around; he had a thick skin. “Ladies love my face. And my body. Do you know why?”
“Dean! Why did you choose bowties? I’m not a stripper,” Cas called out, staring at the suits that Dean picked for their ceremony. He chuckled, not at all surprised by his choice, and slid the laptop away as Dean walked out of the bedroom. “You’re lucky I really,
“Class wasn’t bad. I find I dislike my main relationship psychology courses a lot less now.” Cas winked, taking a bite, and then gestured his fork toward Dean. “What about you? Did anyone notice that ridiculous mess we made?”
Those powerful hands fisted in the sheets as he moved faster, baring his neck for Cas and moaning his name so quietly it was almost lost to the sound of the fan. That perfect, beautiful, tight ass bounced off Cas’ waist every time Dean took him all the way, and Cas couldn’t hold back anymore.
Alistair didn’t waste time, and he was a way crazier driver than Cas was. They pulled up to Sonny’s office way friggin quicker than they should have, and the douchebag got out, not bothering to open Dean’s door.
Jask chuckles. “Both, actually. This fucker named Ashton clocked me trying to start a fight and Mother’s Milk got involved. Somehow, it became my damn fault and I got sent to solitary for three days.”
Jask beams, then skirts around his fiancé to come ruffle Cas’ hair. That alone was annoying, but then the giant oaf puts him in a headlock. “No worries, Cas. I work in mysterious ways.”
Ares started fucking back on Jask’s cock hard, letting Jask know just how close he was, and when his hand lost all rhythm, Jask looked around just in time to watch Ares come. White streaks dripped down the wall in front of them and Jask shuddered, stepping back and pulling Ares with him before bending him almost in half.
Dessert found them at yet another small restaurant, where Dean brought out his most stereotypical British accent and spent the time mocking Cas’ professor. It was irritatingly endearing, and by this point, Cas was feeling both confident
Then there was his ex, who broke up with him and accused him of pretending to be someone he wasn’t. Dean assumed it was a copout, but maybe not.
“Maybe I don't want it to go down yet,” Cas says with a purr. He lifts up just enough to make Dean let out a strangled sound and yank him back down, then circles his hips again until he feels yet another rush of hot come. It settles in his belly and makes it hard to think for a moment — but if there’s nothing he can do about being claimed, he's going to make the most of it.
The protector in Cas responded to that and he glanced toward the door. “Am I your only night guard, or will I be alternating shifts with someone?”
“Yes,” was Cas’ instant response. He rocked up on his toes and kissed Dean’s cheek, then took a half-step back like he was embarrassed. “I… enjoyed that this morning. Thought I’d return the favor.”
Dean chuckled, imagining Cas stopping a fight so he could wash his giant, sexy hands — not that Dean’s noticed. “Dude was tryna cop a feel, huh? Asshat. All he had to do was ask.”
After Dean’s muscles had all relaxed and Jask’s hands started to get sore, Jask moved enough to roll Dean over. He dropped down to kiss him breathless as he rutted against him, way harder than he should’ve been since he hadn’t been the one getting touched.
Ares growled as he jerked forward for more, letting Jask pull his hair so hard it must have hurt. But the pain seemed to spur him on; he slurped and sucked like it was the last thing he’d ever do, and Jask finally let him go just to see what he was capable of.
They don't have much more time to talk after that — the cafeteria starts to fill up and a line forms, and Az gets to work right away. He hands Dean a serving spoon and puts him in charge of the mashed potatoes. It's an effort to remind himself that he's not allowed to eat while on the job, but the second the other prisoners are fed, he eats about three times what he normally would.
It was hard to deny that, not that he’d ever wanna deny Cas anything. “C’mon. Let’s cleaned up… I wanna take your gorgeous ass to dinner.”
Dean smiled back, his eyes roaming every inch of Cas’ face. “I know you’ve got me.” He slowly reached out and took Cas’ hand.
is right there in the room. You got your ‘one that got away’ back… both of you. Mine never will. He’s been in a different relationship for like a billion years now and he probably doesn’t even remember me the same anymore. So, why try? Just because I’ve given up on love doesn’t mean I can’t get laid.”
Dean moved his hand and eyed him. “No, I don’t gotta fuck her. But I don’t wanna marry her. In case you missed the memo, I’m gay. Like... dick up the ass, gay.”
Cas huffed quietly, annoyed at himself for ruining the moment with thoughts like that. He extricated himself slowly, not missing the way Woody’s hand trailed down his thigh like he didn’t want him to go.
“I’d love to see it.” Cas kissed the bridge of his nose and each cheek, almost as if he was kissing the blush away. “How am I supposed to sit at this desk on Monday and
Cas frowned at his screen, wondering why he’d taken the time at all to cultivate a response if it was going to come out like that anyway.
He packed the rest of his things first thing in the morning, and slid a small bottle of lube into his pocket along with a lighter. He was hopeful that if Dean reacted well, they’d be spending some time in the backseat of Dean’s Impala.
“Shh.” Cas swallows Dean’s protests with a kiss and slowly removes his fingers, then pats around the bed trying to find the lube. It takes way too damn long, but finally, he's slicking himself up and groaning as he nudges in. “Fuck,” Cas whispers. “Breathe for me, Dean, you're strangling my cock already and I'm barely an inch in. So… tight.”
Ares watched him take the stairs faster than ever before and chuckled, palming his growing erection.
“I’d never.” Dean thinks of where the wedding is and tries to remember the nearest body of water. “How’d he drown me though, we’re pretty damn far from somewhere he could actually drown me.”
But P leaned back until he was upside down on all fours like a friggin crab and dropped his ass down, rendering Dean to be incapable of rational thoughts. He couldn’t really reach P’s cock anymore, especially without lights, but he could hear it smacking wetly off P’s abs every time he slammed himself down and lifted back up.
Cas leaned back as far as he could, bracing himself against the front seat and thrusting so he was impaling himself and fucking Dean’s fist. “I - Dean!”
Cas smiled to himself, happy that Duma managed to settle down with a family after she was honorably discharged. “It’s been awhile, and Dean didn’t want to leave me behind. I have half a mind to go anyway and just not tell anyone.” He tilted his head back against the couch and rubbed Havoc’s fur behind his ears. “I’m thirty years old, I shouldn’t have to sneak around to do my damn job.”
He walked to the far side of the school and quickly locked himself in the stall. His hands were shaking as he unbuttoned his tight jeans, and when he freed himself his cock bounced so hard it made him hiss.
Cas chuckled and took his arm. “Both our men are jealous ones. Their faces will be priceless.” Before they entered the room, Cas paused and turned toward Ares. “Jask is probably just scared because of what he witnessed with Dean and I, but he’s crazy about you. Don’t ever doubt that.”
Sleeping was hard. Dean wasn’t surprised that Cas denied him for cuddles, nor was he upset over being denied, but he still wished he had said yes. Him saying no made sense, the guy didn’t want to mess anything up with his
Cas could feel Dean’s chest rising and falling against his own and after what felt like an eternity, Dean took a step back. “Yeah... I think you’re right.”
He struggled, trying to break free, but Cas only strengthened his grip. “He admitted it! He’s a cheating gay!”
“Me too.” Dean shifted his face slightly and inhaled Cas’ hair. It was such a small movement that Cas could have missed it, but he felt so intuned with every move Dean made that he knew exactly when he stopped. “Let me cuddle you tonight, Cas.”
“Yeah? We can probably do a few songs. Can you play? I only know one or two on the guitar and the second song I never got to learn all the way, so if you can take over the guitar after the first song, that’d be awesome.”
They ended up edging each other until neither of them could hold back anymore, and it was times like that Jask remembered why he bottomed for Dean, and only Dean. He kissed him thoroughly as they came down, committing the way Dean’s hands felt fisted in his hair to memory. No matter how things played out, it was going to be a long month without him.
There's no point in denying it. With Gabriel being who he is, he'd sense the lie before it even left Castiel’s lips. He sits down in a heap, covering his face with his hands. “I couldn't stop myself.”
“Don’t be. You can touch all you want... even if you don’t let me. Does it count if it’s only one way?” Dean once again blurred the line between right and wrong, but he never did like lines.
“I uh... kinda wanted to kiss you again. I know we said if it happened naturally to just let it happen… but I shouldn’t push it on you in a random moment. You look... fucking adorable. Let’s just eat and get to that pie filling and see where this date takes us.”
Ares did exactly that, sucking and moaning around his fingers so loudly that they didn’t even need the radio to entertain them. By the time they pulled in, Jask’s hand was soaked and he didn’t know if he’d even be able to make it inside. He shut the car off quickly and pulled Ares to him by the shirt, kissing him hard. “Fuck,” he muttered, breaking the kiss. “Okay. Go into H&M. Grab two shirts and head for the dressing rooms, leave your door cracked.”
He can see Cas’ body nearly convulsing for a moment, but he locks eyes with Dean and nods, his pupils blown. He pulls his cock out a moment later and moans around Dean’s length, sucking a little more intensely.
It’s hard to believe today is my 6 month anniversary posting on here. I appreciate all of you more than I can say!
He sat in his office, thinking about how damn happy Cas made him just as a text came in. It was a photo of Cas’ bulge in his slacks that said “Stay after school.” His cock instantly twitched and swelled in his workout pants.
“Lemme help, J.” Dean walked over to rub his shoulders, not liking how tense he was. “Do you need anything from me? Besides a blowjob, cause that’s happenin’ regardless.”
“Did we? Doesn’t feel like it.” Dean laid back on the bed and opened his phone, letting Cas know he was done with that conversation.
Frenchie tilts his head as he stares at the hickey he left on Dean’s neck. “Looks like I already took one, but if you're offering again..."
“Nah, I know you wuv me.” Dean smiled over at Jask and polished off his beer. “I gotta be up at like 4am, gonna call it a damn night soon.”
Cas used the soap as lube, and when he felt he was close enough to the edge, he rinsed him off and spun him around to drop to his knees, letting him empty all over his face and chest. He stared up and licked his lips with a grin. “Let’s go have some pie.”
When Dean got home on Monday, Cas had the record player going and dinner nearly done. He looked happy, and Dean realized he’d never see that smile enough as long as he lived.
“Good for you, man. I’m lookin’ at like ten, but... maybe good behavior can get me out a little sooner. Still... in it for the long haul.”
It takes a moment, but his body begins to slowly relax. After he keeps his vision locked on Cas, all he sees are those gorgeous blue eyes, and it’s all he cares to ever see again. Suddenly, he starts to feel like he’s floating.
His moment, and not even this dick was going to take it from him. “C’mon man, what do you want from me? You gonna bribe me?”
“Alright, alright. So, I got a new cook. He’s got these killer blue eyes and the best dick I’ve ever had, seen, touched— you name it, it’s just the best dick ever.”
Dean leaned in and kissed him again, this time much softer. “I know. We’ll wait. We’ll do it right. But I gotta go jack off or ima explode.”
Dean’s eyes were so pink they may has well have been a new color entirely. He gasped, squeezing the base of his cock and letting out a strangled groan, wrapping his legs around Cas’ back. “Fucking incredible. You fill me up so well… feels amazing.”
Once the show is queued, Dean goes back to his cell phone, this time ordering them food before returning to his Dom search.
“Meet you in rec then, yeah?” Dean winks as Azrian leaves, then ditches his own apron and heads for the rec room.
Woody’s body shuddered and he released a loud groan just as the door squeaked open, but they were too far gone to care. Cas knew he should stop, knew he should be worried that someone would hear them or - if they looked under the stalls - see them. But he just couldn’t care, and when Woody released the wall and grabbed Cas’ hips, he knew he felt the same.
“Yeah, your brother is a nut job. Got it.” He flopped onto his back and threw his arm over his head, extending his body and making every single one of his curves stand out. “I’ll do it, y’know. I’ll bottom for you every day if that’s what you want.”
The command laced through Dean’s words had Cas letting out a whimper, and he couldn’t have stopped then if he wanted to. He twisted his hand, touching himself the way he imagined Dean would if he’d just reach out — and came abruptly with a whispered plea of Dean’s name. He kept going until he was twitching with oversensitivity and went boneless against the bed, his body buzzing and breathing quick.
Their waiter brought them some lemon water and the positive affirmation he offered had Ares biting back a laugh.
Cas watches Dean as he makes his way into the cell, but he can't stop grinning. “Hooligan? That's a new one.”
know he’d seen them both an embarrassing amount of times. It had been so long since he’d used anything else for jack off material that his iPhone no longer recognized his usual porn site as ‘frequently visited’. Part of him thought it was a good thing, but most of him knew it just meant he was screwed.
“Nah, but I’m pretty sure this is the angriest my dick has ever been at me.” He laughed like he wasn’t mad about it and bit his lip. “Not often I get him all worked up to deny him, but I’m not in a hurry.”
Jask took his time, trailing his tongue in little circles over each of his nipples and down the center of his abs. He stopped right around Ares’ hips and nibbled tiny bruises on each of them, their hands laced on both sides and pressed down against the mattress.
want this, and yes, I do. I still want to graduate, but I want to do it at my own pace. I know I’m not the smartest kid at that school, but I learn quickly and then I have to sit around while others play catch up. It’s boring. I want to do this.” He felt confident in his final answer and hoped Amara wouldn’t be disappointed.
There was no point in dignifying that with an answer, so after Cas made sure the guy rounded the corner and was out of sight, he headed back into the room.
Jask could tell Ares loved being pinned down and he pulled on his hair. “Oh my... fuck! Touch it again.” He didn’t specify, but he knew he meant his tight, inviting hole. He was more than happy to oblige, but refused to go beyond teasing.
Cas could practically feel his eyes changing to pink as he watched Dean and slurped up some noodles.
Dean scoffed, looking down at the purple and silver streamers. “Those really aren’t my colors, Charles. And no, I think I’m good here.” He planted a kiss to Cas’ forehead, but Cas pulled back and tore some of the streamers to get free.
He kissed her head. “It’s okay, Maddy. Unless of course you’re the monster, in which case… it’ll hurt, but I won’t hesitate to kill you.”
Ares moaned, baring his neck with a sated sigh. “Fuck me somewhere public today... please. I’ll wear panties and a plug.”
Cole looked pissed and tired, turning to face him. “Enough with the bleeding heart bullshit, Dean. If you don’t start taking this crap seriously, it could be worse next time. Word gets out you’re not pressing charges on the psycho fucking fans that decide to throw bricks through your window and break in when you’re sleeping, there will be more right behind her.”
Even as he reluctantly pulled his hand back, Jask moved in a little closer. “You know I’ll be in a suit, right? Tie and everything. This client requires me to look like a professional. Sure you can handle that?”
“Y— yeah. Dean, fuck, I’m already close.” Cas started rocking in and out and when his cock slipped out for the first time he cussed and shoved it back inside, moving faster and faster toward the finish line. “Dean, I —” He came harder than he expected to and nearly fell over on top of Dean.
Since ‘I go to a grimey truck stop bathroom’ didn’t sound like the greatest follow up, Cas simply nodded, now almost positive that Dean was at least interested in men. “I understand, this isn’t the most forgiving town.” The bell rang, signaling the end of lunch, and Cas stole one more bite. “Thank you again, Dean.”
All his negative thoughts clouded over with the haze of lust, and he tossed his head back against Jask’s shoulder so he could easily have his way with him. Those hands were absolutely the best hands Ares had ever felt, and after being with Cas all these years, that was saying something.
“I mean, it makes sense. The whole ‘you don’t know what you have until it’s gone’ thing, except you don’t have to wait for it to get so far that you lose someone. I wonder what makes people go to this extreme, though.” But even as he said it, he knew why. It actually sounded good for couples, especially if sex or anything that could make a partner insecure were removed.
Cas was finding it difficult to breathe. There was no doubt in his mind he’d be able to fuck Dean like he hated him despite the fact that he was irrationally in love with him, but that wasn’t exactly a fact he could broadcast. “Just make it anonymously. I’ll handle vetting.”
“Omega.” Dean latches onto Cas’ neck as his knot begins to catch on his tight hole and when he finally begins to come he bites harder, breaking the skin and claiming the omega as his. He slams deep inside, bringing his hand down to feel Cas’ belly bloat with his seed.
“I'm tempted to ask you to,” Cas agrees. He reaches over to grip Dean’s hard cock and teases his nipple with his teeth. “I think this qualifies as an emergency, don't you?”
Cas tightened the ball on his ring and made his way back out into the living room, pulling the yoga mat from beside the fireplace and stretching it out. “Do you mind?”
J was already home, and it looked like he had just gotten out of the shower when he walked out of the kitchen to greet Dean. Before Dean could even comment on how adorably comfortable his boyfriend looked, he noticed something much more pressing. “Is that my friggin Zepp shirt?!”
Jask took him quick and dirty, pinning him face-first against the wall the second he walked in the door. While Dean preferred to be the one getting rough, Jask always knew how to turn Dean on anyway, and ended up finishing Dean off a second time using his mouth.
Cas moaned at the feel of him and rolled onto his stomach, wiggling his ass. “Fuck me again, I don’t care that I just came.”
Cas’ free hand went to his gun and he nodded, looking like he wouldn’t be able to deny Dean anything in the damn world. “Of course we can. Whatever you want.”
Even if Dean didn’t mean it the way Cas craved, hearing those words still felt amazing. But stopping himself from kissing every inch of Dean’s flushed skin was an effort that was only getting harder by the second, and he knew he needed to get them out of their current situation before he did something stupid. “Do you want to take a shower, or just go home?”
His question was soon answered when the jocks lapped Ares, and Morningstar stayed behind. Jask was saying something to Ares, and whatever it was had Ares' entire body looking tense.
The groan Dean releases into his mouth makes Cas shiver and stroke just a little faster. “Cas... so good...”
Ares smiles softly and nods, pausing a little before speaking. “He really was a mess without you, Cas. You should have seen him last Christmas after some eggnog.”
“Yes, Sir.” Dean does as told and wiggles his ass, pushing back in anticipation. “C’mon, busboy. Make me feel it.”
in his mind, and his movements are messy until Dean twitches from the feel of saliva running down to his balls. He forces his head forward until that beautiful cock is invading his throat, then swallows and bobs until Dean’s thighs squeeze his head and he comes with the most gorgeous sound Cas has ever heard.
When he returns to the prison, he pushes the button that triggers a lockdown drill. He chuckles to himself as the prisoners scramble to get back to their dorms, and once everyone is safely tucked away, he starts decorating.
“Of course. I believe he’d love that,” she nodded, stepping back from the booth so he could get out. Cas tensed in his seat, but also didn’t stop him.
This time, Dean didn’t pull back, and didn’t make any effort to move Cas off. “I can’t give you up again. Don’t ask me to.”
The smile faltered slightly on Cas’ lips. As much as he wanted to know who was on the other side of the hole, they’d made their arrangement for a reason. It was the first time either of them had used an app like Pinnochio - aptly named for looking for ‘no strings attached’ sex - and it was better for both of them if it remained a mystery.
we were to get married, which one of us would be popping the question… and how. I’m sorry, I suppose that wasn’t entirely on topic.”
