Sherlock snorts, and when Molly turns around, cheeks pinker than before, the murder in her eyes is directed at Sherlock. “Oh my

“Not what?”
He busies himself setting out plates and digging through the bag of takeaway containers while John uncorks the wine and pours them each a glass. Well, mug.
John feels proud that he could give such a proper Muggle answer. Tongue between his teeth, John taps out another message:
. Stretch. First position, second, third. This audition is just like any other.
“Sorry Mum.”
The man carefully stretches back up to full height, exaggeratedly massaging the spot where Irene had landed her blow. “Note to self: don’t underestimate Irene Adler.”
Molly giggles. “That sounds like an ideal situation, if you ask me.”
John was silent. He thought of people pitying him, whispering about him. The weakling, the emotional wreck, the
“That was
Perfect.
Unlike in Sherlock’s hotel room, here John has all the words on a teleprompter, and he adds some…unorthodox choreography to the mix. He clutches the mic, rolls his hips, and strokes his hands along the mic stand, all to shrieking applause.
Sherlock groans, tugging lightly at his hair in frustration, even as he feels a thrill at her words. “But he’s always
Last night had been the perfect moment to finally ask Sherlock out, but John couldn’t manage it. John contemplates what had stopped him. Usually, he doesn’t mind admitting, he’s quite smooth when he’s on the pull. Unbidden, the image of Sherlock’s disappointed face flashes before his eyes yet again. Irene clears her throat pointedly and John realizes he’s been dumping vanilla syrup at an alarming rate into the coffee in front of him. When he looks up to the patron meant to receive the drink, the man looks confused and faintly alarmed. Muttering an apology, John turns to start the drink over again.
. John pushes aside his friends and immediately takes Sherlock’s hand, reaching up to plant a kiss on Sherlock’s lips, right there in front of everyone. When he backs up, he doesn’t release Sherlock’s hand. It doesn’t matter that he only saw him a moment ago. Or that they’ve only been on one date. John is
Oh, no.
They’ve been here before, and it doesn’t take long before Sherlock throws a leg over John’s lap and sits, tongue pushing insistently at John’s mouth, both of them breathing raggedly as they push together. Sherlock runs his hands down John’s sides and plucks his shirt from his trousers, then pushes his hands up along John’s bare torso, skimming over his nipples and exploring his firm, fuzzy chest. John whines, his hips thrusting up against Sherlock involuntarily, hands clenching Sherlock’s backside. Sherlock groans, detaching himself from John’s mouth and starting to nip along John’s throat as his fingers thread through the buttons on John’s shirt.
a response to flattery that John understands and encourages in beautiful men) even as his nose scrunches in confusion.
. The rest of the month leading up to its release, he spends avoiding Molly at all costs. Sherlock is certain that if Molly manages to corner him somewhere private, he will break his contract and tell her every little detail.
“No?” Sherlock asks. “Then what are you doing here.”
The dishes are doing themselves in the sink while Bill’s potions kit simmers and bubbles sluggishly on the floor next to the television.
“Very well. Third periods you say?”
It doesn’t end there.
I have a few johnlock fic outlines in my folder…let me know in the comments which of the following you’d like to see from me next! Two of them involve Harry Watson, as I’ve decided I want to shower this fandom with Harry fics that write her in a positive light.
“You have to put the wire through the back of my shirt,” Sherlock said. Normally he wouldn’t be this helpful, but waters were treacherous. He didn’t want to offend John any more.
With a wink, John shoulders the guitar and walks back on stage to enormous applause.
“You can see something like that?” John asked, suddenly nervous and trying desperately to hide it.
He shrugs. “Couldn’t sleep, and the violin helps me gets my thoughts in order.”
“Sherlock.”
John can’t help but smile, thinking about how much his Mum will like Sherlock. How could she not? He’s brash and witty and sharp and gorgeous and
There are a handful of protesters screaming and waving signs when mummy pulls their car onto the airfield. In the seat beside him, Molly squeezes Sherlock’s hand. His dad shakes his head and mutters darkly that the protesters should ‘get a hobby.’
“Morning sleepy-head,” John murmurs. “Welcome to America.”
“About the show. It’s opening night. Mrs. Hudson said we have a full house.”
“John, darling!” his mum cries, brushing ash off her clothes and stepping around Harry to press a kiss to his cheek.
John doesn’t let the subject go, even has he joins Sherlock to help set their picnic up.
. John tries not to let the distaste show on his face as he contemplates the gruesome Muggle healing technique. He laughs awkwardly to cover up his discomfort.
Sherlock, Molly and Irene are the only reasons that John keeps going, his first month back in England.
Sherlock steps towards John and speaks into his ear, “You couldn’t have given me a heads-up?”
Maybe the DJ saw John, or maybe not, but soon the dance version of
“Um. Yes?” Sherlock says. Molly Hooper gets dangerous when she’s immersed in fannish glee. This is most certainly one of those times.
Sherlock danced
“So you’re not about to kiss me?” Sherlock murmurs.
Mike and Irene descend on Bill, berating him about Muggle transportation and the Statute of Secrecy. They’re too busy arguing with one another to notice that John is sinking into a panic.
He remembers tramping through the Forbidden Forest with Mike and foraging for potions ingredients on weekends. Hunting down rare herbs and fungi that would fill out their medical kits. How John was always glad when the snow thawed and the crocuses came into bloom at the bases of Alihotsy trees. How they signaled the return of fine weather and easy afternoons by the lake on the horizon.

John winced. Mary was right, the football team were a bunch of tossers. And John
John laughs. “Yes, but with less rainbows. Well, you’ll see it for yourself, but actually I’m usually more popular in America. It’s the British bad-boy vibe I give off, you see. Those American birds, they can’t help but fall for it every time.” Sherlock rolls his eyes.
John doesn’t get a chance to relish how pleasantly awkward the whole thing is. Irene’s shouted “Oi!” carries across the shop, loud and irate enough that he can’t ignore her. He turns to the counter and sees that a queue has formed while he sat with Sherlock. John didn’t so much as hear the door open, he was so entranced by his company. Like he was under some kind of undiscovered Muggle spell.
Molly cleared her throat, “You’ll be changing Sherlock’s microphone of course, but the procedure is basically the same. First things first, you’ll need one of these,” she said, and pulled an
He’s astonishingly beautiful. John’s gaze lingers over his full eyelashes and plush lips. John rubs his own lips together, wondering (hoping) what it would be like if he gets a chance to kiss them. He’s looking at the way his dark hair curls softly around his ear when he notices that Sherlock is shifting in his seat, eyes unfocused on the screen in front of him. Distracted by John’s stare?
“Show us again!”
Sherlock ignores him.
Several songs later, the thudding beat of

Wait, what did John ask again?
Rolling his eyes, John yields. He picks up his bow and an arrow, stands at the line about 5 meters from the targets, and
“I was so scared,” Mummy whispers, so soft that Sherlock almost can’t hear. “I don’t know what I’d have done if you…”
“I. I need some air.”
. Muscles pull taught, brow furrows, and eyes sharpen and focus. John pulls the string back, takes a slow breath, and releases. The arrow whistles through the air and–
named Victor you were apparently dating, and what he did…how you found him in bed with another bloke during your night off.” Sherlock winces, and John catches the expression. “I tried to stop Irene when I figured out what she was telling me, it didn’t seem like her story to tell, but she was bloody single-minded. Just kept talking, followed me when I tried to walk away. She…told me how you were her best friend and that if I jerked you around that she would come after me. God, I think she mentioned something about having a whip? I was mostly not listening by that point, just trying to process what she was talking about. So…do you want to tell me what that was about?”
Luckily, once the bus gets moving and people start to quietly chatter or nod off, it doesn’t feel so very different from the other long bus rides spent in each other’s company. Their arms are pressed a bit closer than usual, but John enjoys the simple intimacy.  They’re sitting in peaceful silence as the sun starts to rise through the bus’s windows, when John hears a low moaning, “
“And these are my mother and father,” Sherlock continues. “Margaret and Siger Holmes. Mummy and dad, this is John Watson.”
John giggles. “Sherlock, think about it. Where is your flat, in relation to Speedy’s?”
“Can you? Because I called my brother.
This had all the makings of impending disaster.
There’s that word, again. What all this was meant to be about. When Sherlock dares to peek out from behind his arm, he sees that John has settled down along his side, propped up on a hand to look down at him. His eyes are blue and intense, flickering across his face worriedly. Sherlock hides again, as he takes a deep breath and begins to rapidly deliver the speech he had planned.
“What exactly is ‘
“John, darling? Two things. First of all, we aren’t really dating.” An evil smile came over Mary’s face. “And second - you were checking him out, too.”
Harry sits back, obviously smug to have regained the upper hand. “It may have come up over tea.”
Before he knows it, Sherlock is on the wrong end of John’s dressing room door, more confused than ever, and vowing to ignore the deflated bubble of hope in his lungs.
Sherlock does not drink from it.
“Yes, I do actually. James and I were best friends, and everything was new and difficult, but we figured out that it was more than just friendship between us, eventually. He was the reason I could admit to myself for the first time that I was bisexual, and,
The dark did not deter John, as he’d spent the past two hours working in a dark space. He ignored the building intensity of the speakers’ sound as he rugby-tackled Jeff Hope. They both crashed to the ground. Once horizontal, he wrenched Hope’s right arm up above the boy’s head so that the gun was pointing to a (hopefully deserted) brick wall, opposite of the audience. Not a moment too soon, because a loud

“Oh BOYS!” There’s a beep as someone accesses their room and John glares as Irene enters with a smirk. “This is your wake-up call. Only half an hour ‘til the bus leaves,
Bill’s eyes light up and he crows in delight. “Are you suggesting the
For a moment, Sherlock wishes he was there with her. He so rarely gets homesick: their village is quiet, conservative, and dull. But it’s also familiar. Safe.
There’s a sigh, the long breath blasting interference across the line. “It’s only been a couple weeks since we last spoke. Made it sound like you were getting along so well.”
What did that mean for his military career? Was he going to recover? Was everyone else okay? The beeping on John’s heart monitor sped up rapidly as John began to hyperventilate. John heard the brisk patter of footsteps and a nurse pulled open the hangings around his cot.
(See the end of the chapter for
He's talking about Victor. Victor?
John doesn’t care. He can’t tear his gaze away from the gorgeous bloke in the long coat, and just stares dumbly. The man reaches the counter, sends Irene an absent smile and barely flickers his gaze in John’s direction.
“I never did get around to actually asking,” John mused. “That weird French waiter interrupted us.”
“Hi,” answers John, struck dumb. He tries to smile, but he’s pretty sure it looks stupid, what with the way his eyes must be bugging, faced as they are with this gorgeous man’s intense gaze, flush cheeks, and frizzy curls.
“Yes, him. I thought you two were friends. There’s
“No.”
Oh, please God,
“Well, I was fascinated with bees as a child. I grew up in the countryside, and there wasn’t a proper library for me to visit in the summertime, so I spent all day out of doors.” John leans forward, surprised that Sherlock is divulging a story about his past, and eager to hear more.
As they begin the set, he keeps half an eye on Sherlock, but everything is fine (just as John suspected it would be). The dancer has his signature look of intense seriousness fixed on his face.
“Careful, you know Irene can sense generalized statements concerning gender from a mile off... Don’t you like them? The flowers?”
A slow blush begins to creep up Sherlock’s ears and John can’t help himself. “The trick with the water bottle? Not exactly subtle.”
John’s hissed reproach of, “Sherlock!” went unheeded.
“Anyways, I’m the stage manager. I call the shots during a show and make sure everything happens when it’s supposed to and nothing happens when it isn’t. My ASM’s named Sally Donovan-that’s Assistant Stage Manager by the way, but you’ll get the hang of all the acronyms soon enough. She’s in auditions at the moment, keeping notes for Mrs. Hudson, the director.” Greg whistled at Molly and jerked his head toward John when she turned. Molly smiled and jogged over. “This is Molly, she operates Mechagodzilla.”
“Yeah?” John asks, cautious.
. I’ve always been in love with you.”

John and Sherlock are left alone in the room. It’s quiet without Irene’s boisterousness, and suddenly awkward.

. “I was joking!”

James clears his throat loudly. “Should I be jealous, darling?” he asks, and John realizes he’d been staring rather a long time. He smirks up at James, who had crossed his muscled arms and lifted an eyebrow.
be talking about those tabloids that have been floating around.” Her eyes are sharp on him again, and Sherlock is torn between relief that she’s acting like her old self, and trepidation at the future interrogation.
It’s a nice image. John is center, arms crossed over a white tee, dark stare gazing at the camera. On either side, Irene and Sherlock are in profile: Sherlock gripping his bicep and Irene whispering something in his ear. The three of them were shot in black and white while the words
“Listen up, and listen carefully, because I’ve known you since we were twelve and you were basically a baby Casonova.”
Typical song structure, John’s prose warm and familiar raised under Sherlock’s fingertips. The page is messy and scribbled over, but the story shines through. It starts with ‘Once upon a time,’ and folds out like a fairytale from there.
Merlin, John wishes he didn’t have to stop him. But this is important. John knows that sex between them is a big step, and he doesn’t want his secret lingering between them during their first time together.
“You’re hopeless.”
“John, stop. You should know I’m only teasing,” Mary said. “And I promise I’m not going to make you audition for the play.”
“Hm, I don’t know John. That sounds like an
John stands with a grin towards the floo where Harry appeared. He takes a step towards her when there’s a second
“I suppose that’s part of the reason I like them. Little kids do what they want, when they want. They’re open books. Sure, they can be sneaky, but they’re not duplicitous and false like adults so very often are.” Sherlock cleared his throat, realizing he might be revealing too much. But John was leaning in, his face so damn
The response is immediate, several beeps in sequence as John writes out each message. John must have already had his phone out when Sherlock’s message sent. He’s certainly living the authentic university experience if he’s already texting in class.
He gently takes the hand that John has resting on the coffee cup and turns it over to better inspect the calluses on John’s palms. John can’t help but feel a thrill as the stranger’s elegant hands envelope John’s. “…and you make frequent use of… a quill and ink?” he sounds truly flummoxed.
John’s eyes flickered to Sherlock’s lips, and back up. They pleaded with Sherlock, and begged him to understand.
“You’re…”
“What?” he bristles. The man smiles, big white teeth contrasted with tan skin.
“The least you can do is tell me one thing.” Conan leans in, and John mirrors him. “I'm sure my audience would love to know…are you single?”
Sherlock laughed. Together they polished off a meal his nurse carried in. They talked aimlessly about hospital food and bees and science experiments. John had just brought up Greg’s offer to be assistant stage manager when Sherlock cracked.
fans.” John smirks as the taunt has the desired effect and Sherlock’s reddened face appears indignantly from beneath the blanket.
John smiles widely, and busies himself with gathering the cutlery on the table as the man stands, offended, and sends a hot glower towards John.
Irene scoffs. “That’ll make him good for one thing.”
John looked around at the others to see that none of them had reacted poorly to hearing about Harry. He’d heard the stereotype of theatre being a safe space for gays. But he still thought they’d make a fuss about his sister’s girlfriend, even if only in a positive way. This, though? This genuine

his alcohol loosened tongue.
“Sherlock!” John gasps as he feels a leg slide between his own. His cock twitches, already halfway to hard. “Do you remember,” John gulps, as Sherlock licks at the exposed collarbone at the opening of his robes, “last time we were here.”
“Lowen was a professional Quidditch player and
“John, you can’t say the “M” word in a theater! Has nobody ever told you that?” Sarah said in a hushed voice.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at his boyfriend. They’ve spent the past two weeks at Sherlock’s parents’ house and between his mother’s interference and his father’s obliviousness, they haven’t had any privacy in weeks. Sherlock isn’t going to let a lack of sofa be the reason not to have a night alone with John.
“What's it feel like?” John repeats, as they stroll down Diagon Alley towards the Leaky. “I’ve never had to think about it before.”
“Greg,” John sighed, glad to see his friend but still groggy from the morphine dripping into his veins.
Deep breaths.
“I mean. I mean…I’m. I’m an aspiring detective.”
“Yes, well…um, Rugby season just ended, things have been busy.”
“Are you nervous?” John asked.
Sherlock turns eyes so balefully confused on John that he looks pained by his lack of knowledge.
Molly saw John’s growing anger and attempted to intervene. “Don’t worry about me, John. I

Greg took roll to check that everyone backstage had a working headset before turning off his microphone. John waited, poised by his instrument to begin rehearsal. Janine Hawkins walked onstage to deliver the prologue. “Okay, Watson. Spot at full brightness on our Nurse, there,” Greg said. John eased his spotlight on and watched as Janine began her monologue.
He was supposed to keep his head down until graduation. Not lose his head over a bloke he’d just met. But he remembered Sherlock’s warm breath puffing out against his ear and chuckled, shaking his head. This was a dangerous game. John liked a bit of dangerous.
after all that liquor?” Irene complained, shoving Sherlock with her shoulder. He smirked at her, smug. “Anyways, don’t forget about this new dare.”
It’s not until the next day that shit hits the fan.
“Nice shirt,” John tells Sherlock with a smug grin, raking his eyes down his lean figure in open admiration.
“Yes.” Sherlock doesn’t hesitate, and his dad nods once.
“It’s…nice to see you, Molly. I didn’t hear you get in.” John licks his lips as he glances towards Sherlock.
Sherlock makes a frustrated noise. “I’m not stupid, I knew all those things you were doing were classic John Watson seduction techniques-“
doesn’t deserve to get hurt because you’re afraid of commitment and can’t find the balls to admit that you’re head over heels for the bastard!
He was just considering seeking Molly out when he heard a knock at his dressing room door.
“What can I say, John? The man can dance.”
John slips a lid onto the drink and slides it across the counter. The man reaches to take it, but John doesn’t withdraw his hold on the cup. At last, the man tears his attention away from his mobile and directs a critical gaze toward John. Victory! For a moment they are locked together, John very reluctant to let go of the drink if it makes this intriguing (beautiful) man walk out of the shop so quickly.
“Oh, no.” Molly isn’t Sherlock’s best friend for nothing. He can hear the cause of Sherlock’s emotional disorder dawn on her, and hurries to keep talking before she can do anything embarrassing, like deduce Sherlock’s feelings
The scene continued as Sherlock, snapped out another line, "Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits five times in that ‘ere once in our five wits." John laughed into the otherwise quiet of the theater. Sherlock might as well have been telling Anderson he was lowering the IQ of the entire street for all the vitriolic disdain he put into the words. Was that what acting was? Not taking on a new personality, but rearranging the pieces that you recognized? The trio played through most of the scene with ease. They were talking about dreams when Greg came back on headset.
John tucks a loose strand of hair behind his ear, and licks his lips. “Er. I only work weekends, at the shop. Maybe next Saturday you can tell me about another one of your cases?”
“Oh yeah?” Jim asks. “Well, we wanna see YOU try it!” His calls are echoed by the rest of the children.
Molly (Sherlock’s co-counselor, aforementioned first friend) slides into a plastic seat beside Greg. “Oh, are you asking about the dare then?”
Silence settles comfortably between them, and John puts down his wine and folds his hands in his lap, leaning toward Sherlock.
Too soon, Sherlock is in front of the door. (“Star Dressing Room: JOHN WATSON” neatly chalked out). He’s willing himself to knock when he hears something. A series of chords on an acoustic guitar, John’s voice singing over them. Just a few words, followed by a long pause. Then the chords begin again, then the voice.
Sherlock can recognize the inevitable, and turns to Irene with a sigh and accepts the blue violin and bow to a blast of screams and applause.
“So.”
It really
“Oh my God he’s coming over here, Sherlock! What do I do?”
He grabbed Sherlock’s mic and made a quick escape before she could get a word in.
“What?”
Sherlock hums vaguely in agreement, apparently getting distracted by John’s petting, his hands creeping under John’s shirt as he begins to kiss along John’s neck. He rolls his arse on John’s lap and John instantly begins to harden under the attention. “Sherlock!” John gasps as the man’s hands dip into the back of his trousers. “We can’t shag here. Your dad’s right down the hall!”
Sherlock’s smile is small, and a little pinched. John has to look away as he realizes the implications of this conversation.
Sherlock smooths his curls into place yet again as he walks slowly to John’s dressing room a few hours later. (He can do this).
“Don’t be sorry, John. Looks like you’re getting the hang of the equipment up there!”
It's opening night!
Well, if he was going to make this theatre thing stick, he’d better do
Sherlock bites his lip uncertainly. “He won’t be jealous?”
Molly and Greg exchange a dubious look at this proclamation, but luckily little Anthea (darling, precious Anthea) beckons “Mr. Greg!” to the children’s crafts area, and Sherlock is left to face Molly’s smug-yet-pitying look. “Whatever you decide to do, it better be quick. Mid-Summer Campfire is the night after tomorrow. And you know what happens if you don’t make your move by then…”
Sherlock’s face drops. “Yes, of course. Shall we visit the perfume counter for Irene, then?”
Sherlock hummed, uncomfortable with the sentiment. He cared about Molly, too. It seemed he had a knack for alienating those for whom he cared.
) dove gray blazer. John turns and Sherlock is caught. He examines an older but still irrefutably John Watson from top to bottom, and the man positively
It feels… like perfection.
“Not know?” Sherlock sounds offended at the implication, but there is vulnerability in his eyes.
John turns to Irene, who’s smiling politely at a customer as she makes her change. She glances back at John, eyebrows raised.
“Sherlock!”
Mike is right. He’d slip up sooner rather than later at the worst possible time, and would that damage their trust?
When the final verse ends, soft and sweet, John takes the violin from Sherlock and passes it off to a band member. With a silly bow, John offers Sherlock his hand, looking up through his eyelashes. It’s not until there are sudden cheers from the audience that Sherlock realizes how quiet they had been, spellbound by the music just like Sherlock. When Sherlock accepts the hand, John pulls him into position and waltzes him across the stage. Pretty soon though, the waltz devolves into more of a rhythmic swaying to the final notes, as John presses their joined hands to his chest.
“It’s okay, Sherlock. Just breathe. Nothing bad is happening to you, you’re safe. I’m going to count to ten, try to match your breathing with the numbers okay?” John rubs Sherlock’s forearms in a repetitive motion as he counts, his own anxiety unclenching as Sherlock’s breath gradually evens and his shaking lessens.
He steps onto the duvet beside John and wordlessly collapses onto his back, throwing a forearm over his eyes with an enormous sigh.
“Well, I’m done hiding….So…. Can I take you to bed?”
Eventually Mary pulled back and wiped away her tears. “Enough of this. There’s someone else you need to talk to, isn’t there? I think I’ll just go fetch him.” John laughed. The glint in her eyes bode ill for Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson glances to Sherlock, fidgeting a bit. “It’s about the shows in Las Vegas this weekend.”
Sherlock walks to the other side of the office, embarrassed, and wishes they could skip this part.
“Come in,” John tells him.
Just because John had forced him to listen to Madonna in school doesn’t mean he’d enjoyed it.
- When John showed up to a date wearing a shiny blue plastic jacket and baggy trousers, and Sherlock had spit out his seltzer upon seeing him (John gave Mike a hard time for that one. How was John to know, digging through his friend’s wardrobe unattended, what was day wear and what was intended for a costume party?)
I’ve ever had only began when Victor shoved me up against a wall and stuck his tongue down my throat. That’s really not the approach I’d like to take.”
Sherlock is sitting with his legs folded on the bench, earbuds in, and concentrating fiercely on his computer screen. John knows he has a deadline on his thesis that he needs to meet by this afternoon. The earbuds are a signal to the world at large that today is not the day for distractions, or in John’s case, constant flirting. It’s a smart tactic, because otherwise John would spend the day trying to feed him bites of sweet pastries and pitching love notes and bad poetry at him on balled up pieces of paper.

“But how did you know you’d be able to see anything in the dark?”
“Like you’ve got a leg to stand on, Mr. Best Dressed.” John shoves James’ shoulder with his own, trying not to blush. As much as John likes to flirt, he’s not used to such bold attention from admittedly attractive blokes.
John is nervous. He’s on Sherlock’s front step, shifting his weight from foot to foot.
Once the two of them have giggled over what to caption it and sent the photo to Victor, Sherlock breaks out in an enormous yawn.
those demonic little buggers?” Sherlock burst out laughing at John’s expression. Retaliating, John swatted at him until his chuckles quieted. “But seriously, you do? I have to work with all ages as the Recreation counselor, and it’s by far hardest to keep order with the little ones.”
Sherlock groans, “Where on Earth did they find that?” and John doesn’t get a chance to examine it further because Irene scrolls down. Whoever found this photo has zoomed in, comparing some fuzzy pixels in the background to a (now) vintage poster of The Watsons. It’s unmistakable. Underneath they’ve captioned it,
Coach Donovan rounds up the possible recruits and gives them suicide laps, as many as they can without stopping or passing out. John remembers this stage of his own rugby tryouts vividly. He remembers wanting to pass out or die his legs burned so much, but needing even more to outlast James, who was running easily at his side. The year tens do better than expected, but Holmes is obviously not invested in the exercise. After a few rounds, he simply stops, not even breathing hard. Coach sends him to take a cool-down lap, scribbling on her clipboard.
Sherlock leans against a desk, finally looking back at John. John’s eyes,
“What is that supposed to mean?” He bristles.
“Yes, ‘
Sherlock looks at him critically, but allows John to lead him on their journey towards Molly’s. “I’ve heard about Pranav,” he says abruptly. “Pranav and James, that is.”
- fun fact: the condom thing is real.
“Are you kidding? She wears this stuff all the time.”
John shortly found himself on the wrong side of the studio door. His shoes followed in two clops, and the straining notes of a lone violin began again.
John thinks he's missed his chance with Sherlock. Thankfully, Irene is here to give him a kick where it counts.
John seemed unconvinced, but conceded with a nod and changed the subject. “So…you mentioned cadavers? Are you a med student?”
Sherlock finally meets John’s gaze. “John, I don’t know if that’s a good-“
Most of the rest of the video is drowned out by Molly shout-sobbing in confused happiness, but Sherlock keeps quiet, grinning as he watches the routine he’s been doing in his sleep for a fortnight. On screen, he and Irene are trading John back and forth to dance with each of them a few times. Then some choreographed moves that all three of them do, a slow jib shot climbing over their heads. Sherlock’s favorite moment (and likely Molly’s, going by the squeal) is when he and Irene grab a fistful each of John’s shirt from either side and physically rip it from his body. John is

Sherlock cleared his throat and forced himself to back away. “I must finish preparing. Vocal warm-ups, costume, etc., so if you’ll excuse me.”
As John pulls out disinfectant wipes and butterfly bandages from his carefully organized case, he hears Sherlock mutter, “There’s always something.”
“This is for you,” the man says, and hands Sherlock the coffee he’d ordered.

John hears a faint scoff from Mr. Holmes, who’s seated himself on the couch down the hall. John poses himself carefully in front of the door and calls, “That's the greeting I get? And I came all this way to see you!”
Lips squished between Sherlock’s hands, John’s speech sounds a bit funny when he replies, “I’m glad.” It sounds more like ‘Um glud’
“That was a month ago! I’ve been waiting for you to say something for
this one! Come dance with me!” John calls to Sherlock, swaying with the mop.
“Sherlock’s doing okay, John. He’s a bit shaken up and pretending not to be. Kind of charming, really, that male stoicism. A lot like someone else I know.”
but. Um. Here, I’ll just…”
“Case notes for my blog.”
Mike finds a nearby Muggle pub on his phone (their regular Sunday night place is in Diagon).  John stays close to Sherlock all night, holding his hand on the table or wrapping an arm around his chair. Bill spends the evening wide-eyed with fascination at the unfamiliar chaos of a Muggle pub, and thus Irene spends most of the night preventing him from performing magic or sticking his foot in his mouth.

“It’s just, I was trying all the classic romantic gestures and you didn’t seem to be
By February, the school year has shaped up to be John’s favorite yet.
Eventually, the end of the first act approached. Mrs. Hudson had decided that the scene with Mercutio’s and Tybalt’s deaths would be a perfect middle point for their production, and John agreed. After seeing Sherlock (metaphorically) spill his guts up there, John certainly needed a break.
In the young hours of New Year’s Day, John gets an empty text message from Sherlock and knows something is wrong. He races to Sherlock’s address and sees the lights are out. He locates the ceramic lizard that holds a spare key, and is soon racing around the house to find his friend.
Sherlock, 16, dunking water over himself to get John’s attention. Tugging him by the hand through alleys after a shoplifter, adrenaline singing in their veins. Snorting at John’s terrible jokes. Grown into his dramatic face, stronger, surer, and utterly
“Hey, you kissed me, prat!” John replied.
“Huh?” Oh bloody hell, John sounds like an idiot again. “How do you know about that?”
“Anthea, you’ll go first, distract their first line of defense. Do your adorable face with the big eyes that makes Greg melt – yes, that one, good girl. Jeanette and David, you two will follow, split directions and take the attentions of the jail guards. Mrs. H, you trail them a moment later to make sure everyone on the far side of the field is sufficiently distracted. Molly wouldn’t dare tag you. I’ll sprint in, get Sherlock out of there, and get us back. Anyone who gets jailed for the sake of the mission, we’ll launch a secondary rescue mission for you. Everyone understand? Any questions? Good. Team break. Operation: Capture the Sherlock…GO!”
John pulls out his phone to check the time, and the screen unlocks to his text log. He scrolls through the messages he and Sherlock had exchanged since their
“Thank you places,” the group chorused back. John added his own (slightly delayed) thanks. It seemed there were still plenty of traditions to learn in theatre. At least for this one he got to stay inside.
John feels his pulse spike. “What did he find?”
“John! We’ve missed your face around here. Where’ve you been?”
John expects a scoff, a comment about sentimental drivel. Sherlock looks away. “He’s not…it’s not about that. It’s just…”
.” John finally says, eyes
and Sherlock wishes he could crystallize this moment for eternity. Both of John’s hands come up to cup Sherlock’s head, gentle like it’s something precious. When a tongue sweeps into his mouth, Sherlock thanks a God he did not believe in three minutes ago to finally be rid of those torture devices called braces. John’s tongue slides along his and Sherlock groans deep at the sensation.
Molly snorts. “Oh I know all about those. Have you seen the ones with the red pants?”
That TW from the beginning comes into play in this chapter. Non-graphic description of child abuse.
John was so lost in loving Sherlock he didn’t even notice.
as it happens, and Sherlock cares about him. I can’t just bust my way into their relationship, even if- if what you’re saying is true. The way they touch each other, laugh with each other.” John forces a weak smile. “I walked in on them today. Nothing too explicit, but…”
Their third time (and last in the night’s marathon) is different. It's early morning when Sherlock rolls onto a dozing John and whispers in his ear, “Again?”
The police told him, just like the nurse had, that nobody but John and Hope had been injured in the altercation, but they weren’t able to provide any more details.
“What do you—you don’t even know what I’m talking about!” John yelps.
“Oh you definitely were. Maybe not the fox you are today,” John sweeps a predatory look up and down Sherlock’s figure, causing his blush to shift from rose to vermillion. “But still beautiful. You’ve always had the cheekbones and the bottomless eyes and the effortless grace. I was just a bit behind on the whole ‘bisexuality’ thing. Took me a good few years to work up the courage and admit it to myself, honestly.” John scratches a spot behind his ear, looking uncomfortable. “That’s what I wanted to say. Well, ask, really. I’m sure we’ve both changed some over the years, but we’re still both single and I’ve never quite gotten over you, that is, once I figured out that there
Still laughing, James continues. “Anyways, John. If I’m right about Sherlock, then he’s waited a long time for a chance with you. The least you can do is wait a bit for him in return.”
“Why not?”
They launch into a discussion on wizarding genealogy, which leads to John’s family history. John promises a visit to the Watson ancestral home to meet his mum and sister sometime soon, and so they can browse through John’s dusty collection of textbooks.
“Oh, Johnny,” his mum sighs. “No, sweetie. You’re just growing up. And into a

dizzy last time,” John said, leaning towards Sherlock, hands in pockets. Now that he was gaining confidence, he just couldn’t stop the charm.
When Mary found out what was happening with John’s dad, she offered to play his beard. Begged, really. John had tried to refuse. It wouldn’t be fair to her, and Mary deserved a real relationship. But three weeks, three girls from Surrey, Kent, and Essex later, and one nickname from his rugby mates—‘Three Counties Watson’—John had capitulated. To hear Mary talk about ‘splitting up’ with him now caused panic to flit through his veins.
Mary laughed. “They’re for the
The man then has the nerve to pluck one of Sherlock’s earbuds from his ear. Sherlock freezes, and slowly turns his head to turn a disbelieving glower on this stranger. John tenses, ready to step in should Sherlock need any help. Or step away, if Sherlock decides he likes the look of the man, thinks a small insecure part of John.
“You’re not Irene,” he accuses, eyes narrowed at John from under a mop of truly chaotic hair.
“You think I’m not going to pick my boyfriend up from the airport?” John asks, grinning as he presses a quick kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
This… isn’t what John was expecting. It’s smallish, and has a golden wreath on the door, and he can see Christmas lights through the windows. It's so
“Sorry puppers, but I meant
“Morning, love.” John whispers.
“Don't be such a child, Sherlock,” Mycroft snaps, and Sherlock flinches away at the harshness of the tone. It's all too familiar from their childhood spats. After a long silence, Mycroft sighs again. Sherlock can practically see him kneading at his temples. “Forgive me, little brother. But you’re needed at home. It’s all sorted, Mrs. Hudson will give you the details.”
“I’m not dressed for a club!” John protests, looking down at his cardigan and jeans.

Since Sarah and Stan had left the crew, Greg was pressed for hands. He was operating the light board himself in addition to calling the show, and his assistant Sally Donovan had taken over Stan’s old job of finding and managing props. Billie had volunteered to fly scenery in and out from backstage and John would be running a spotlight from the balcony.

“Am I going to be the one to mention the elephant in the room, then?”
. You know that is not what I meant.”
Sherlock bites his lip. “I might be…going on the North America tour with them this autumn? As a sort of…principal dancer? A bit?”
After all, he’s never seduced a Muggle before.
Just then, Lestrade slams open the stage door with a packet of notes under one arm. “Everybody better be here and ready to rehearse, because we’ve plenty to cover. Places, for top of
Victor sighs. He looks ill, John thinks, and sad. “Am I going to have to give you the shovel talk, John? Or are you going to go back to Sherlock and be there for him like I can’t?”

gorgeous. The boy is all sun-kissed skin, golden hair, and deep blue pools for eyes that make girls weak at the knees. Perhaps not just girls. The first time he’d glimpsed them up close for himself, Sherlock, too, had found himself (reluctantly, hopelessly) infatuated with John Watson.

John collapses against the counter, utterly stunned by the hurricane of a man. “He’s really a Muggle?” he asks, thinking of all the things Sherlock had known about him after a mere instant’s inspection.

“No. I don’t. And I don’t see how that’s relevant, we’re talking about—“
He feels flirtatious and giddy and brave, his heart full to bursting. “Am I your boyfriend?” John smiles slowly back at him.
John felt a ludicrous amount of stress about his minor supporting role in a minor school play, especially considering how well he’d done so far. But John felt like he owed it to this show to do his absolute best, to not fuck up. This show had given him insight into another world, something fun and engaging to do in his spare time, and best of all: some absolutely brilliant new friends.
“If you say so. Where are we going?” Sherlock’s curiosity is insatiable, and John is about to hand him the key to one of the biggest mysteries London has to offer.
“Am I… a woman?”
"Yeah, he's a sweet kid. First time doing the acting thing, he says. And he worships the ground you walk on, if it means anything to you. No idea why."

Pearce was stumbling backwards out of the alley clutching his bleeding face and shouting obscenities, when the constables Sherlock had mentioned appeared at a jog. In a moment, Pearce was in handcuffs, and a constable was asking Sherlock and John questions.
John laughs with relief just as much as happiness. “In that case, I’m glad you’ve agreed to this,

So maybe John can’t ‘play hard to get.’ But this way is more fun anyhow.
“It’s okay,” John tells her as he squats down to get on the girl’s level, ignoring Lestrade’s frustrated groan about being late as he throws up his arms and climbs into the car. “You're our biggest fan, huh? You’re kind of little for our biggest fan.” Sherlock watches, charmed, as John smiles and the girl giggles shyly. “What’s your name?”
“It’s just a plant. They’re harmless,” Sherlock wheedles. One of the nearby tendrils reaches out to wrap itself around Sherlock’s pinky finger. “And friendly, apparently. Are magical plants sentient?”

“I’ve pulled some strings and had a chat with one of the surgeons.” Sherlock looked sharply at his brother, suddenly intensely interested in, even grateful for, his brother’s presence. “She believes John will pull through, and likely recover almost completely. He’s young and strong, after all.”
Mr. Stamford had set John up with a screw gun and a showed him several drafts of what he wanted the set to look like. The show was going to be a hybrid Elizabethan-modern setting, so the scenery had “stone” archways and pillars, but also included metal scaffolding and graffiti. John wasn’t sure he ‘got’ it, but he
John tosses his head back and laughs, eyes sparkling. “You got me there. There’s nothing better in the world than this.” John jerks his head back towards the stage where a chant of, “Encore!” has begun.
Once they’ve teased and comforted John to their hearts’ contents, John signs off. Although he pretended to pout, he does feel a bit lighter after talking to them.
Greg’s chuckle filtered through his left ear between crackles. “I know, John, considering you’re currently fifteen feet away from me.” John looked to his right and saw that Greg was, in fact, sitting behind a nearby table next to Molly. On the table were two boards full of innumerable buttons and sliders (one for lights and another for sound, John surmised), a lamp, and Greg’s script.
John nods, aware of how excruciatingly dull this discussion is. “Oh. Also good. Yeah.”
“Are you sure it’s alright?” John asks yet again, fingers returning to ruffle through hair that feels far too short. He rocks his head side to side. It feels peculiarly light. And what if his neck gets cold?
Sherlock scans the crowd for a man: the only reason he had found—the only reason he had needed—to attend.
John thought about it. “You’re right, I’m not. Someone had to do
But there they are, and it’s happening, right this exact second, and he can’t do anything about it.

Sherlock softens at yet more evidence of what a romantic John is. This is exactly why he had come up with tonight’s impromptu picnic. Resolve to make this moment special burning in his gut, Sherlock sets aside his plate and moves in closer to John (not that there had been much distance between them before).

A moment later, Sherlock gives a violent drag along the strings with the bow and lets out a wordless shout of frustration.
There’s a long stretch of agonizing quiet, interrupted when Billy delivers a basket bread. Then there’s some stilted bread-eating. By the time that’s finished, John is desperate to break the silence.
” she says the final word with the careful precision of someone who has been corrected before.
“John?” Hesitantly, Sherlock reaches a hand and places it on John’s back.
“I should probably be getting on the plane, then.”
“This is my favorite post, personally.” Irene turns the screen around so they can both see. It’s a photograph of what’s obviously a younger Sherlock and Molly, perhaps 14, dressed in their school uniforms and smiling awkwardly up at the camera. Sherlock’s hair is a wild tangle, and his mouth is full of metal braces.
, and I couldn’t just stand there and watch Hope kill Sherlock.” An echo of the panic he’d felt chased through John’s mind. Where was Sherlock? John needed to see him, to see for himself that the boy hadn’t been hurt.
They break apart with a laugh when the audience’s cheers and shrieks grow loud enough that Sherlock has to cover his ears.
that night. And I never called or apologized or said anything, but I’ve been thinking about it for years.” John sighs when he realizes that Sherlock isn’t saying anything. “I guess I’m asking…can we try it again?”
“Not at all. Were Irene and Bill giving you a hard time?” John squints at them, mildly threatening. Sherlock squeezes his hand.
The boy rolls his eyes and crosses his arms over his chest, in a classic defensive stance (one that is rather diminished by the accompanying wince).
He explained this to John, “
The next day at the shop.
The man smiles slightly as he lifts his now-freed drink to his lips to take a sip, making no move to leave his spot at the counter just yet. “Does that mean I was right about everything?”

Waiting for a cue, John reflected on the nature of tech.
Sherlock considers for a moment, then nods his head. “Acceptable.”
All told, it took
“What next?” he asks, bright and enthusiastic about exploring Diagon. John had thought Sherlock would be overwhelmed, after his near panic at John’s flat. Instead, he seems to be happily gathering an infinite amount of new data, shouting out a new deduction or revelation every few minutes.
John sounds less enthused. “Mrs. H, I really don’t think that’s a great idea.”
“That is just brilliant. I knew you must be smart, to’ve skipped a grade,” John says.
“I didn’t ask, but I’ll take your word for it.”

Sherlock Holmes. He finds the prospect terrifying (which he finds in turn, danger addict that he is, thrilling).
John marks out a line fairly close to the targets and gives the wide-eyed children instruction on how to shoot an arrow. The added commentary about Robin Hood, Green Arrow, and Katniss Everdeen magnifies the wonder and excitement blooming undisguised on the children’s faces. John distributes blunted arrows and steps back to allow them to try.
After the choreographed dip, Sherlock lets his hands drag up his chest as he pulls back to standing, snaps his head away to the left and back towards the mirror, and winks. There’s sweat pouring down his neck and his heart rate is pleasantly elevated.  Nothing can stop him. When the song ends, Sherlock’s chest is heaving in exhilaration.

John tells him, “Dump the Scamander and the Waffling, I still have those from my Hogwarts days.

And if you swap out the Pyrites for a second hand version, then you can also get those recent editions of
it. He’s just contemplating waking John for another round when a message from Molly appears in his inbox.
When eventually, John’s knees begin to ache on the hardwood of the living room, John scoops Sherlock up in his arms and carries him to bed. Instead of asking for more details, John just lies beside Sherlock, cards fingers through his hair, and murmurs reassurances and heartfelt apologies. He can feel Sherlock’s trembling in the hands clutched in John’s shirt.
John doesn’t look at any of it.
Edit! I wrote 4,000 words tonight after posting this...so if you haven't seen the final chapter by Sunday, you are encouraged to poke me or something and tell me to finish this fic already!
John reappears in Speedy’s back room, and heads straight for Sherlock’s flat next door.
“I dunno. Do you want to be?”
“Oh. Hi, John. It’s been a while,” he begins awkwardly. He seems remarkably sober in comparison to his fiancé. “And hello, Sherlock. I recognize you from. Everything.”
“So? Tell us.
“What do most people say?”
“It doesn’t take a genius, John,” Mary snapped. “And we’ve been friends practically since birth.”

Sherlock groans, “Must you guess? You never did excel in deduction.”
Irene smirks. “That was Sherlock Holmes. And you, my dear Watson, are in big trouble.”
He passes the lyrics back to John. “Can I hear the music?”
“Hi Victor,” John begins, moving in close to Sherlock so they’re both in frame. “We’re both here. What’s going on?”
“There have been complications with my Green Card. I’m grounded in Moscow until negotiations…settle down. I’ve arranged everything with your Mrs. Hudson. You’re to gather your things and take the red-eye to Heathrow tonight.”
“What? I haven’t told anyone at camp about that.”
It’s dim and dusty, but he has a good view of the talent without being ogled, and only Irene here to bug him.

. That would be a sin.”
When he turns around, Irene is terrifying. Her glare is fearsome and she looks about three times as tall as she bears down on John.
“Listen up, folks!” Irene cries suddenly, breaking the moment as she turns herself around and points the camera (that John had forgotten about) so all three of them will fit in the frame. “If this video gets half a million hits in the next seven days, we’ll add
When John enters through the blue curtain, Sherlock can’t help but smile. He’s wearing a maroon suit with suspenders, his chin stubbled and hair all fluffed up like he hates (but makes him look undeniably sexy). Sherlock barely pays attention to the interview itself, mesmerized as he is by the sight of John laughing, John tapping his fingers on the arm of his chair, John licking his lower lip as he thinks about how to answer a question.
personal favorite activity, as a special treat for your last day of camp. Archery!”
Now that he knows, it’s impossible to ignore. John feels a swoop of desire whenever Sherlock smiles, that mad grin crinkling up his entire face. He has to look away when Sherlock and Victor sit together, cuddled up like puzzle pieces.
John apparates into Speedy’s Cafe and turns to see Irene Adler glowering at him, the fragments of a ceramic plate at her feet.

“Do you want to go out for a drink, Sherlock?” Mike asks, navigating them out of the tricky patch of conversation. Bless Mike Stamford.
“It’s fine, I can call them back. What were you about to say?” John asks, looking earnestly into Sherlock’s eyes. Sherlock waits for the phone to stop ringing before gathering his thoughts to begin again.

“A what?”
“You’re

He creeps back to the sofa, fakes an enormous yawn, and walks to the kitchen a bit louder than he normally would. Mummy is standing from Dad’s lap, wiping at her cheeks. She goes to pour the tea as Sherlock takes a seat adjacent to his dad’s.
John laughed. “I haven’t been holding out on you, I swear. It wasn’t all that complicated. I figured stalling Hope was our best option, so I told Greg to kill the lights and Molly to give some feedback, and I ran downstairs to run interference with the bastard.” John shrugged. “It was pretty simple.”
John looks at him through his lashes, and Sherlock can still see skepticism in his eyes.
With one last sympathetic look and a pat to John’s shoulder, Mrs. Hudson leaves, already tapping away at her mobile.
innuendo when he’d read this play in Year 10. What had they been thinking, assigning a play like this? John wished he could look away as he felt his face heat up, but his job depended on close scrutiny of his subject, and Greg was going to call his cue any moment now.
“Yep.”
Over the course of several hours, Sherlock’s papers have steadily spread across the large table that he occupies, until he’s taking up eight seats of the café. When he isn’t typing away furiously, the man paces in front of the photographs and documents spread across his table, muttering to himself then darting back to his computer to make notes. Mostly, Sherlock works at his computer with an intensity John finds kind of hot. Nobody besides John seems distracted by the manic pacing though, so John assumes that Sherlock must come here and do this regularly. Curiosity is eating away at John, and he agonizes between respecting the man’s work space and plotting a reason to join Sherlock at his table.
