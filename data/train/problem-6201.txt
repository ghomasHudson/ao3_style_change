That little piece of gossip had swept through the neighborhood many months ago. Tony Stark, Brooklyn’s best repairman, was courting his neighbor Ruth Byrne. She was still technically married! The scandal didn’t last long when it was observed that they always kept a respectable distance from each other in public and stayed living separately.
As Tony walked the now familiar street home to their apartment, he kept replaying the previous night in his mind. It was a great start to the new year, 1940. He’d had fun dancing with his date. Steve had finally had a successful date and had even gotten to second base! He’d finally found out just where the two men stood on homosexuality and was pleased to find them not only tolerant but a little
Bucky shook his head harder, pushing away at what Steve had called him. “Don’t,” he choked. “Don’t call me…You shouldn’t…”
By their second glass, however, they’d begun to sing along with the radio, even the little advertisement jingles in between songs. Their third glass had them laughing over the smallest things that probably wouldn’t have been as funny without the eggnog. The fourth glass had them teasing Steve at his perma-blush, the alcohol making his skin flush a deep pink, and the dopey smile that he couldn’t stop making.
Tony listened to his father as different emotions flowed through him. He’d heard bits and pieces of this growing up, but it had never been spoken this way, a casual conversation of what had shaped Howard into the man he became.
so they can have heat and still afford to feed their family. Just because you end up getting something in return for the work you do doesn’t make you selfish.”
The asset part of him had not been happy with the thought of falling asleep in Steve’s bed like he had, but Bucky had shoved that nagging voice aside. Steve had needed him, and he had been falling short for too long when it came to Steve for Bucky to not try to get the man to talk. It had taken a while before he’d mustered up the courage to come to Steve’s floor and ask to stay with him. What if Steve didn’t feel comfortable sleeping next to an assassin?
Howard’s welcome still had Tony a little confused. When he’d walked into the lab after being clapped on the shoulder by the guard standing outside, Howard had looked up from the circuit board he was working on. Tony had watched his father’s brow furrow before he asked, “What the hell are you doing here, Anthony?”
“Well that certainly narrows it down,” Steve said sarcastically as turned to walk away, and Tony swatted his ass. Steve spun around looking shocked.
He looked over to Bucky and found the young man staring at him. His stormy grey eyes were half hidden under eyelids made heavy by the bourbon and long day they’d had. Tony’s breath caught. He was beautiful.
Right, Steve should be focusing on Bucky who was here and needed him now. He would just have to trust in their teammates to keep the search for Tony moving forward. He nodded as he moved around the counter to stand beside Bucky.
Steve and Bucky obviously cared, but they afforded him the option of dealing with it on his own. Tony appreciated that more than he could say. Throughout his life people had treated him like he wasn’t capable of making his own decisions. He would be the first person to admit that he sometimes made horrible decisions, but he was a grown man and they were his bad decisions to make.
Steve watched as Bucky kissed and reassured Tony that he was fine with Tony being in control if they ever decided to do that. Steve was also digesting a lot of information. He never realized sex could be so complicated and come with so many rules. He was very grateful that Bucky and him had never accidently crossed into what Tony had been describing.
Above him Tony pouted as he slowly swiveled his hips above Steve. “Why not? I like it, and don’t you like the thought of me having your marks on my skin?”
The man bent to pick up his belongings, and Tony quickly joined him, grabbing all the papers he could before the wind decided to send them to the Bronx.
And just like that, Bucky was moving toward him, and for once he didn’t look threatening, he looked desperate and scared. Steve’s feet began their way toward the other man without needing the command to move, and he met Bucky in the middle of the room.
Steve exhaled like the air had been punched from his lungs, his eyes blown to almost black at the sight of Tony fucking the man between them. He looked down at Bucky. “Can I Buck? You want him to fuck you onto my cock?”
Suddenly, Bucky didn’t know why he’d chosen to come here. There was no reason for him to be here, and JARVIS had to know that. Still, something inside him wanted to enter the room behind this door, whether he was allowed or not.
They fought side by side as they brutally made their way through the guards and into the factory. Tony used his new gun and began firing at the men in front of him. They fell before his feet as his shots found their mark. You didn’t design weapons for most of your life without knowing how to use them.
Racists abound even in war and the person is on your side. Bucky, Dugan and a few of the others didn’t seem to care about the addition of the black soldiers, but there were definitely some that did. At least they weren’t very vocal about it.
When he entered the apartment, he first thought it was empty since neither of his roomies appeared to be home. As he began to cross the room, however, he heard a faint moan from the bedroom. His first instinct was that Steve was sick, and he quickly went to check on his friend, hoping it wasn’t serious.
For the first time in over three months, Tony forgot about his lost life in the future as he so happily enjoyed the present. He didn’t feel out of place or trapped. He didn’t feel the crushing weight of hopelessness. As they sat around their second hand table in their simple little kitchen and talked of all the new possibilities for them to try and enjoy, the different ways they could give each other pleasure and their plans for their relationship moving forward, Tony just thought one thing.
Tony chuckled and kissed him as he began to walk, carrying Steve toward the bedroom. “At ease, soldier. We’re just cut off from supplies up here.”
Of course, Tony accepted. He really hadn’t had much choice. How many challenges was he actually faced with when it came to his work? You know, besides handsy housewives. So the next day, Tony made the trip to Queens and after over three hours and a trip to the hardware store, Tony had finally fixed the problem. He closed the panel of the machine and hit the power, hearing it churn to life, and Tony clapped his hands once in victory.
“Excuse me, sirs,” JARVIS’s voice rang out, breaking them from the moment. “I apologize for interrupting, but the remaining members of the team that are currently still in the tower are headed to this floor. I thought it best to warn you.”
Erskine outright laughed this time. “This instance didn’t really require much skill in observation, Tony.” He looked more serious as he continued. “Was it that bad, having Stark as your father?”
He concentrated on his plate as the others carried on their conversation around him. They were all so different. Each personality stood out from the others in a study of contrasts. They were loud, ridiculous, sharp, kind, soothing, practical, inventive, honest and so many things that Bucky could not bring himself to be. Not yet.
Steve thought of his own mom. He knew she had loved him, but the rest of the world went out of its way to show that they did not feel the same for Steve. Maybe he should see if he liked being taken care of too. Someday. Maybe.
Steve shivered right before three fingers suddenly pushed their way inside of him. He gasped at the intrusion, and his hands shot up to grab Tony’s shoulders as the man’s fingers resumed their punishing pace from before. Tony’s fingers stretched wide, and Steve groaned at the feeling. He loved it. The ache was a sweet assurance, almost as much as the knowledge that Tony wouldn’t hold back. He’d give Steve everything he’d promised, everything he’d made Steve beg for.
“Something like that.” He sighed, finally lowering his hands to look at them again.  “I can’t believe I did that. I thought I had it under control.”
Bucky sighed. “That would be nice. We’ll make his favorite pasta and could get some of that wine. It wouldn’t affect us, but it would still be nice.”
Steve came back with two glasses of water. Like Tony said, a saint. He and Bucky drained their glasses, and Steve took them and placed them on the dresser before returning to the bed. He looked happy and tired and satisfied, which made Tony thrilled to no end. The night had been amazing, more than he could have hoped for.
At first, he’d thought they would torture him for information. When they’d finally dragged him into this sadistic medical chamber, he’d expected to be cut into or beaten as they asked him questions, but the questions never came.
The movements inside him felt stronger, but that was alright. It felt wonderful to just let it happen, to just feel. Everything felt so good. It was overwhelming and comforting all at once, and Bucky felt the last of himself let go until he was floating on the most wonderful feeling he’d ever experienced. Colors blurred in his vision before a feeling of absolute warmth flowed through him, and nothing else existed but this. He was so warm and so peaceful and so happy as he drifted in this dream, but he knew he wasn’t alone. Somehow, he still knew the love he felt was being shared. It was the last thought he remembered having for a long while.
Despite his heavy breathing, Tony’s voice was nothing but calm menace, “What did I say would happen if you went after Steve again?” Joe gasped, his fingers struggling to pry Tony’s hand away, so Tony leaned down harder on his chest. “I believe I promised to break more than just your arm.”
Tony was a little lost when Steve stopped his movements above him and climbed off. He choked out a groan when Bucky stopped his tonguing and sat up a moment later. He hadn’t even realized he’d closed his eyes until they opened in confusion. Tony was panting as he looked to find the two of them, his body tingling.
Steve’s pace began to pick up as the resulting friction only served to make him crave more. Tony was mesmerized watching his thick length stretch Steve open and feeling the tight heat that squeezed at him. “Ahh, so good, sir.” Steve moaned as he fucked back harder. “So thick.”
“Fuck,” Bucky groaned, nodding desperately, “yes, Stevie. Please.” And opened his mouth for Steve, readying himself, as Steve slid past his lips.
Steve just held up the broken transponder. “Howard’s equipment isn’t as reliable as he thinks it is,” was all he said, and beside him he could hear Tony chuckle.
“Yes, Bucky and I are still remembering new events from our past.” Steve answered. “The added side effect for Bucky is that he has now begun to remember pieces of who he was before the war and everything after.”
Steve was back to packing his bag and barely spared her a glance as he answered, “If that’s what it takes.”
“Steve, calm down.” Tony firmly cut him off. “You don’t need to upset yourself again. I have no plans to leave because of what some jerkoff said. I don’t care what other people think of me, Steve. I never have. People are usually stupid, assholes or both, and I don’t have the time or inclination to try to please them. I know the kind of person you are. You’re the best kind of person, and I don’t need other people choosing my friends for me.”
“There will be no threat when I have accomplished my goal.” Pride, thy name is Umar. “Your presence is not required, Anthony Stark. Return to your drabble of heroes. Surely, they are
“I’m glad you’re still here, Tony.” Steve admitted softly. “I’m so thankful I’m not alone waitin’ for him to get back. At least I didn’t lose both of you.”
“You’re probably right, as usual,” Steve agreed, “but I’m glad he did fall for us. I can barely remember how things were the first time without him, but I do know they were worse. He helped us every step of the way from the moment he got there. I know what you and I had before was something special, and I treasure that, but Tony is just the perfect fit for us. He balanced us in a way I didn’t know was missing.”
Tony had enough scars to know that his skin should not be healing this well. For some reason this made Tony feel like panicking, though he couldn’t really say why. He should be happy that he had fewer marks on his body. God knows he’d only just begun to tolerate the really visible ones. A person shouldn’t complain about good health and their bodies ability to heal so quickly.
Phillips’s face hardened. “Then understand it somewhere else.” He told him as he began to walk away. “If I’ve read the posters correctly, you got somewhere to be in thirty minutes.”
“That’s a very enlightened philosophy, Tony.” Erskine leaned back and watched him. “But how do you know that doesn’t make me a Nazi? I could be a spy.”
places had stolen the joy he’d felt that morning. Thankfully Tony was able to fix the situation. Again.
Steve forced himself to stay quiet and let Bucky work through his thoughts because his friend was right. Steve couldn’t just keep taking responsibility away from Bucky and expect him to learn how to deal with what he’d done and been through. So he bit his tongue and listened, all the while preparing his answer to these profoundly deep and equally off-putting thoughts.
Steve knew they would both miss the man while he was gone throughout the day. They usually did, but he knew it would be even harder after last night. They had so much to catch up on, but he didn’t comment on this. He just grabbed his fork and dug into his breakfast.
Tony sighed. “I do. I won’t discuss details because we are in public, and what you are working on should be protected.” Erskine’s eyes widened at that. “But I will say that what you are doing is important, and you should follow your own wisdom through what is to come. Don’t let anybody persuade you otherwise. When you believe you’ve found the right person for what you’re doing, hold onto that belief.” Tony’s throat tightened. “You won’t be disappointed.”
As Tony brought the hand-rolled cig to his lips, Bucky watched, captivated. Even in almost stillness, Tony radiated a sexy sophistication that most people could never pull off. Yes, Bucky could be charming, but Tony could be smooth and suave just sitting on a barstool. That beard just added to his attractiveness. Instead of looking rough or low-class, Tony was rugged and mysterious. Almost dangerous. Yeah, Bucky really liked that beard.
“It’s quite amusing,” she continued. “What you wish is easily achieved, Anthony. Do you truly long to know your Captain and his Sergeant?”
“Well, yeah,” Steve said as if it was an obvious thing to do, “You can’t have a pastrami on rye without mustard and still call yourself a New Yorker.”
Tony watched the disbelief on all of their faces at that. Morita said, “You don’t have to be tough for us, man. We all heard the screams the weeks we were there.”
It's December, and the season is filled with surprises and fluff. There's sad news and exciting news. And a washing machine!
Tony gave the three a smirk with a lazy salute, turned and sauntered out of the kitchen. Yes, Tony was an asshole, but he was in good company.
Bucky could feel the plates in his arm shifting from his agitation as he pulled at his hair with his fists. His head was shaking, telling the voices
He thought he understood why Bucky liked it. The thing that had attracted Bucky to Tony the most was how the man seemed to want to take care of them.
“You can dance.” And Tony’s mind did not wander with the different possibilities of getting Bucky to dance for him. Nope. No half-naked lap dances here.
“You didn’t have to do this, Steve.” Bucky told him quietly for the third time. “I didn’t want you to go through this trouble for me.”
“Good evening Mr. Byrne,” Tony smiled as he pushed his way past the man and into the apartment. “You’re looking tired. Long night?”
He had to see his sweetheart in the comfort of their home. He needed to make sure they went out the night of the Expo, and he had to make sure that Steve went to the enlistment office instead of wanting to come home early because he was worried over Tony. Everything was coming to a head, and Tony couldn’t let all of his careful planning go wrong because of this.
As the nurse finally removed the needle, he watched as Steve began rolling his sleeve down and sarcastically asked, “Think you’ve got enough.”
Tony’s mask nearly fell as he quickly debated over what to tell them. Eventually, he decided to fuck confidentiality agreements and tell them the truth, or as much as he was able to.
“Wait,” Tony held up a hand, “they were glad she got to play? She’d make it up to them?” Tony’s eyes went wide with understanding. “Oh.
He went over to the antique radio. Using the screwdriver he opened the back panel. The layout was simple, and it was easy to see the problem. A couple of the wires looked like they had overheated at some point and the electron tube was loose. That was easy enough to fix. Tony stood and looked around the apartment.
Tony tries to socialize and sabotages himself. He and Steve have quality bonding time, and we finally learn more about Bucky's filthy mouth. Basically, the title says it all.
The music was halted as a well dressed man stood on the stage to announce the countdown to the new year. Tony glanced at Bucky, and they both grinned as they began to count backwards with everyone else.
Bucky might have said that he didn’t need his daddy as long as he could have the sweeter moments with his honey, but Tony refused to let his boy feel anything less than worshipped. Both of his boys.
Tony looked at the man who had been a casual friend and was now nothing more than his doctor. Tony couldn’t afford to have him as a friend anymore, and he certainly couldn’t allow him to continue to be his doctor. So, Tony shoved his anxiety to the side, stopped being defensive and went on the offensive instead.
was saying this to him. In seventy years he’d be the one to teach Tony a few of those moves. “It was unreal. We stepped forward when we saw the knife, but you just batted it away like nothing. Before we knew it, Joe was on his back, and you were…”
Tony knew Steve especially loved this. On one very memorable occasion, Tony had eaten Steve out so thoroughly that the young man had actually come untouched from it. Tony had been so turned on that he’d fucked Steve’s limp body senseless, manhandling him into a pretzel and reducing him to overstimulated tears as Tony rutted into him. He pulled another orgasm out the blonde before he’d finally allowed himself to come. That had been a good night.
Tony swallowed. This wasn’t a date, he reminded himself. This was getting coffee with a friend, with
by Sun Tzu along with some of the more popular works by poets like Emily Dickinson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Henry Wordsworth Longfellow. The first book was to prepare their minds, the rest were to replenish their souls.
“So Sarge,” the man named Dugan said from beside Bucky, “how do you know the Captain and his…sidekick? Considering they were lookin’ for you when they freed us, I’m guessing there’s a story?”
Steve’s eyes watered with those words as Bucky watched him try to push back whatever it was he was feeling. They had an audience after all, and Bucky didn’t blame him for not wanting to start crying at the dinner table. He was still embarrassed as hell from his mental breakdown being witnessed earlier.
“Correct me if I’m wrong,” Tony couldn’t help but interject, “but from what the doctor has told me, the amount of power that would be needed to run the Vita-ray generator would be massive. You’ll probably blow out the power grid for several blocks.”
The room had been horrific in appearance, and the smell had been awful, especially to his enhanced senses. Steve had detected the stench of other men’s sweat, blood and urine, which made sense because Bucky was coated in sweat and grime and everything else, and Steve wanted to go back and burn the factory down all over again.
Tony tried his best to move forward after that day. He tried so hard, for Steve and Bucky. They didn’t deserve to be dragged down by his fears or feel guilty about having to leave him, especially when they didn’t understand why he was so worried. Sometimes in his more desperate moments, he considered telling them the truth, telling them everything, but he knew that would only worry them more because he knew he would sound crazy.
At her words Tony’s mind flashed to the other Avengers. All of them so much more than he would ever be. Amazing heroes, even Clint. The cut of her words brought the pain she’d intended. Because he knew they would be fine without him, would probably be better without him. He wasn’t that close to any of them and had never tried to be. Even though he’d wanted to.
Thor had come soon after that, telling of his adventure in London fighting elves with his girlfriend or something. Asking about Steve’s heroic battle against the Hydra, not fully understanding that it wasn’t an actual multi-headed Greek monster Steve had fought. Then asking about Tony’s brave crusade against the Mandarin.
He thought about the little box that he kept hidden in their water heater closet. Inside the box was a carefully wrapped pillowcase hiding two of his most valuable possessions, his gauntlet watch and Starkglasses.
“Oh God, Bucky,” he breathed as he rushed over, “what happened? Are you alright? Did you get hurt?” Tony was going to kill the bastard that hurt him.
That’s all Steve registered before a blinding pain exploded behind his eyes. His strength left him, and he felt himself falling forward to the floor. He didn’t even feel the impact over the pain in his head. He was so dizzy. He was….He was…
“So what do you think, Bucky?” Steve’s voice cut through his thoughts and pulled him back to what was being said around him.
“The report just came in over the radio.” Mr. Russo, a nice Italian man who owned the pizza place with his brother chimed in. “They say that thousands are expected to be dead or wounded.”
“It was perfect, beautiful.” He whispered with sincerity. “That’s the only way to describe it. Perfect. As for what I’m used to, this doesn’t even compare to that. It’s not even close. You gave me more than what I wanted; you gave me what I needed.” Tony felt the urge to cry again and pushed it away. “I have never loved anyone or anything as much as I love you and Bucky. Feeling you both inside me, and trusting you the way I do? Even I don’t have words for it.”
Both Abrams and Steve reacted to that, but Tony didn’t care. He wasn’t going to stay here bound to this bed as they poked and prodded until the mystery of Tony’s recovery was solved. He really couldn’t bring himself to think of all the horrible ways that could end for him. One of the worst was being shipped off to some secret lab to be experimented on. He already had a secret lab to go to, thank you very much, and he hadn’t been there for the better part of a week
“I slept very well, thank you.” He answered as Steve all but fell into his chair with a groggy little noise. Adorable. “Longest I’ve slept in a while, actually.”
He was also helping to support them since most of his service check was directed to go to them while he was here. Tony had not been happy when Bucky had told him he’d arranged that for them. Tony snarked and said he’d just invest it for Bucky, so that when he returned, he’d be a wealthy man and would never have to work again. Bucky had just laughed because of course that was something Tony would say.
Tony watched Bucky look around at the future Commandos that were flying with them. The others didn’t seem to be having Bucky’s issues with flying and were quite enjoying the faster way of travelling. Tony suspected that they were focusing on the extra time this was going to give them in London instead of being on a slower moving boat.
“I cannot confirm that, Ms. Romanoff.” JARVIS supplied. “All evidence somehow shows that this name has been documented for decades. I can only agree that your search did not involve the name Anthony Sutton.”
“Alright, fine,” Tony said because Steve would see it work eventually if everything went to plan. “I’m building it because of this stupid fucking war. Don’t interrupt and just listen,” Tony told him, raising a hand. “I built it because I’ve been expecting the news you just brought me. Other USO groups have already gone overseas, and it was just a matter of time before they’d send you once they’d milked the defense bond thing dry. It’s a war zone, Steve. It’s not safe, and pardon me if I’m not comfortable just relying on an army escort while we’re over there. You think I’m willing to risk our safety, your safety, on the courage of a bunch of guys I don’t even know? Not gonna happen, especially when it turns out that I was right. We’re going. I know the USO isn’t gonna pay my way, so I’m fully prepared to buy my own ticket, but we’re going.”
In his daze he saw two blurred figures appear over him. Before his fear had time to grow any larger, he felt the straps at his left foot being ripped free, followed by the others as the shadow to his right softly stroked his face. That couldn’t be right; the people here only hurt him. The only ones who touched him like that were…
It’s not that Bucky didn’t care about Steve because he did, at least as much as he was able to. He just couldn’t remember
“Yes,” Steve said without hesitation as he looked him straight in the face, daring him to comment further on it.
looked, taking in the details he’d been missing all this time. Tony was going to be forty-two in a few months. He’d been here a little over two years. He’d been stressed through a lot of it, and he didn’t have the expensive skin care products he once had access to.
Bucky had come to rely on these memories. It was his second chance at living his life. Each one them, good and bad, were helping him become someone. Reading about things before he got to remember them somehow felt wrong. This was his life, his Steve, his Tony. Those were his friends in black and white on that screen next to them, smiling and laughing, and Bucky didn’t even know why yet. What had been said to make them laugh like that? What had they just finished doing? Where were they about to go? Who was filming them?
“You do plenty, Stevie.” James said seriously. “You’re good at art, and you like it. At least you can make some cash doing what you enjoy.”
“Now I know you two are messing with us,” Sam said. “That man doesn’t know how to make anything other than coffee. I was warned by JARVIS when we moved in to not let him try to cook anything.”
Steve’s jaw dropped at those last sentences, and Tony couldn’t blame him for his shock. That was beyond rude and degrading, especially since everyone else in the room had stood witness to it. Without answering Steve turned and tried to make his way off the stage.
Steve was already naked and sitting in a tub much larger than Bucky was used to seeing. It almost looked like it could fit all of them. He turned to see that his Daddy was already getting undressed.
“Tony,” Bucky’s voice shook. “what if they take us away? I don’t wanna go to one of them places. I’ve heard awful things about what they do.” His breathing sped as he started to panic. “They can’t just drag us there; we’re not sick. You said it’s not wrong. We’re not sick. I don’t want that to happen to me.”
“You coddle him, and you know it.” Steve said dryly then added. “You can’t resist his begging. You might top, but he owns you.”
Curious at this he closed his eyes and continued with the memory. After a lot of begging, Tony had laid him on his side in the middle of bed before lying next to him in a position that put Bucky’s mouth right in front of Tony’s dick. As Bucky had taken Tony into his mouth, the other man had done the same to him, continuing the blowjob he’d been giving Bucky for however long it was they’d prepped and teased him.
“Don’t you even think I’m gonna let you near my baby sisters, you crazy Irishman.” Gabe said good-naturedly.
He would probably do that anyway because it would be very approved off within the heavily Catholic community. See? Sometimes religion could work in his favor. So no, he wasn’t sharing, and he didn’t care how possessive that made him. He was not used to this lifestyle of keeping your preference secret, and he could not handle listening to his sweet boy fuck another woman again.
It took Tony three seconds to realize what he’d just confessed as he heard both of their shocked inhales.
As he drew, he thought about the men next to him. He wasn’t supposed to love either of them the way he did, but it couldn’t be helped. One day, Bucky would get married like was supposed to. Maybe Tony too. If Steve actually found a woman who’d have him, he would probably marry her because that’s what fellas did.
“I can’t believe it.” Steve said thickly. “Japan attacked us. We’re not even at war with them!” His small body was shaking with the weight of what he was feeling.
Steve stopped to turn and look at the woman. “I’m sorry, Agent Carter, but I have to believe that I’m more than this,” he said as he motioned to the spangled uniform under his jacket. “I’m not just a lab rat or a dancing monkey, and we’re going to find our friend, and we’re going to bring him back.”
He set down the spoon and turned off the fire beneath his boiling potatoes. “Please eat. I’m so out of my element here you have to meet me half way and act normal.”
He loved it. The mild degradation Steve was inflicting and the desperation that Bucky was inciting served to silence almost every thought in is head while he focused on this one task: Obey, make Steve feel good.
He could kiss them, fondle them and rub against them, but Tony drew the line at second base. That mouth and dick belonged to him and Steve, and he would not budge an inch on this. He didn’t care if he had to spread it around the neighborhood that they’d found religion and were now saving themselves for marriage, or whatever.
As Steve laid back, he felt that new oddity that he was almost as tall as the bed allowed. That thought left him as a naked Tony slowly began kissing his way up one of Steve’s legs. He hadn’t been kidding when he’d reminded Tony that this kind of worship was usually reserved for Bucky, but as Steve’s senses began to come alive again, he had to admit that it was very pleasurable.
The other two’s mouths slightly smirked, probably knowing Tony had reached his quota on emotions for the evening. Steve turned off the lamp, and they all moved to lay their heads on their pillows. With all of them still naked and Tony in the middle, the other two snuggled up to his sides. Steve pulled their blankets over them.
Another had given Steve a loaf of what appeared to be freshly baked bread, saying that Steve was looking too thin. Tony had to agree. Steve just thanked her with an awkward smile and asked about her son and his new wife in Philadelphia.
Bruce sighed as he removed his glasses and rubbed his eyes. “No, Thor said he couldn’t change destiny or what was meant to happen before the curse was created. You know, major events. He never said that Tony couldn’t add to history.”
“Shit, Stevie!” Bucky was up and across the room, grabbing the smaller man and almost carrying him to the couch that Tony had just jumped up from. Steve was gasping with choked off wheezes and holding his chest. Bucky pulled Steve down to sit between his legs, his back resting against Bucky’s chest. “Come on, breathe. You gotta calm down, buddy, and breathe with me.”
Maybe this was all in his head, and his body was lying on the Sanctum’s floor at this very moment. Strange would return and put this right.
One asked when he would find a nice girl. He just replied with a rueful, “I’ve been looking. They just don’t look back.”
Bucky pulled away from the blonde and pushed himself into the corner of the couch, looking down at his lap as his mind was filled with new memories from the past, but the voice in his head was louder and drowned out everything else.
Tony gave his date a friendly, but mostly chaste kiss as other couples around them did the same. He looked over to search for Steve only to find an empty table. Turning his head to scan around the room, he couldn’t find him anywhere.
Steve finally spoke. “There’s no way of knowing that, Tony, and you’re exhausted. It’s late, and we have to be up early in the morning. I promise that we’ll find out more about Bucky tomorrow. Maybe when we get to the camp we can find someone who knows about the 107th. I’m sure they’ll have someone who can tell us something. Hell, maybe we’ll both be surprised and see Bucky there or someone who’s seen him.”
Then Bucky would worry about Tony for obvious reasons, and fuck, wasn’t that a pain in the ass? This had been the first relationship he’d had where he was stable and dependable. He figured he was still dependable, but he grudgingly admitted that he was about as stable as a one legged man jumping on a three legged table.
The rockface beneath him was unforgiving as he laid on his stomach.  The rifle pressed against his shoulder and supported by his hand had now grown warmer than his body. Around him the wind blew through the cracks in the stone as the land and its creatures stayed silent in fear. The rain continued to lightly fall, but Bucky never moved. His eyes and total focus were trained on the clearing below. They shouldn’t have come.
Bucky looked down at his own and sighed. Yes, he liked being full, and he really liked bacon and waffles. As he saw the others begin to ready themselves to leave, Bucky remembered something he’d wanted to do last night.
Bucky answered for their reckless partner. “Tony’s been lookin’ out for us for years, and it’s kinda hard to stop him from doin’ what he wants, but I’m guessing he found a way to follow Steve here.”
Steve laughed. “With completely different impressions, no less. I think all three of us can say that about each other.”
Tony wanted to believe that Strange was just rude enough to ignore a knock on the door when he was expecting company, but he knew that probably wasn’t true.
It was silent in his wake. After a minute or so, Tony’s nerves got the best of him, and he looked over at Bucky. He was watching Tony with an unreadable expression, which set him on edge because he would very much like to know what the younger man was thinking about what had just happened. What Tony almost did to
“Buck,” Steve voice sounded disapproving, but as the blonde looked down to meet his eyes, Bucky could see laughter in the pale blue orbs.
“Well, yes. It was the truth. Not the thing the about us, obviously, last night was incredible, but really it’s none of his business.” Tony continued. “Have you ever heard the term: Knowledge is power. Or: It’s not what you know, but who you know?”
, Steve thought. He’d long given up on being able to talk about his concerns with someone else, to be able to voice his fears and his failures. Sam would probably tell him that wasn’t healthy, and that everyone needed someone to talk to. Here was Bucky asking Steve to let him in, let him help. Would Steve ignore his request because he’d grown so used to handling everything himself?
“You mean that thing with his tongue?’ Bucky brightened. “Because it was fucking incredible, Stevie. I can’t believe we never thought of tryin’ that.” Bucky looked at him. “I’m sure Tony would want to do that with you, or I can try doin’ it. I don’t have the practice Tony’s had, but I would try.”
, had come home around six looking dead tired. He perked up as he breathed deeply. The smell of the spaghetti filled the apartment. Steve had also taken the bread they’d baked earlier and slathered it with butter and minced garlic before toasting it.
“It’s what they are, Steve,” Bucky said a little defensively, “and what fuckin’ difference does it make when their gonna be tryin’ to shoot at me?”
Steve nodded before smiling, putting up a shield over his feelings. “Good, I hate cooking for just myself.”
“That’s my sweet boy,” the other man told him as he held Bucky’s hand and led him to the other room.
“We owe you for his life, too,” Dugan said as he tilted his head to where Bucky was sleeping as Tony watched over him. “I owe him my life a few times over, and after what they did…Well, I thought he’d finally died after we didn’t hear the screamin’ last night.”
“That’s to be expected,” Bruce said kindly as he looked at them from his position by the stove. “You’ve had to adjust to a lot of new information. What about you, Steve?”
They’d arrived at the little town, and everyone else was busy trying to unload what they’d need to spend the night and find out where they’d be sleeping. Tony had motioned for Steve to follow him away from others.
Steve who seemed to be trying not to squirm. The motion made Tony turn his head, and whatever blood he had left in his brain rushed downward. Steve was looking back at him. His eyes were dark, cheeks flushed and his breathing hard as he met Tony’s gaze. His eyes slowly looked down to Tony’s lap, probably seeing Tony’s erection making a tent in his pants. Tony’s eyes copied the motion and saw Steve’s own physical reaction making his khaki trousers bulge.
Project Rebirth had been a success, but almost everything else about the day had been a disaster. The serum was destroyed, and Dr. Erskine was dead. Tony mourned the loss of his friend and confidant. He’d tried to warn the man despite knowing he shouldn’t. He’d tried, but it was useless. Abraham had just held up a hand and said, “No, Tony, I cannot hear it. No.”
Bucky didn’t know the reason for his tone. This was exciting and a great date night. “I know I will.”
Tony and Erskine gave her their drink orders, and as she went away to collect them, Tony picked up a menu.
At that moment Francesco’s wife who ran the kitchen popped her head through the curtain. “Cesco, they need you in la cucina. Hello, boys,” she added with a smile, “Sorry to steal him away, but there is a little problem with la vino delivery.”
“Of course, sweet boy.” Tony said breathlessly. Bucky was so good at his submission, and Tony wondered how Steve was going to get him to help dominate his daddy. Bucky was Tony’s to cherish, but tonight Tony was Steve’s to use and command. He almost shivered at the thought.
“Good night, Steve,” they both answered. Tony laid there thinking about the past as the other two fell asleep. Considering some of the things Tony had had to do to survive, sharing a bed for warmth really wasn’t that extreme. It was just the bigotry of this era that made this seem like such a big deal.
To Steve’s surprise Bucky shook his head at this, his stubbled jaw lightly scratching against Steve’s shoulder. “No, I want to lay down. I want you to hold me like you used to.”
Tony turned his head to side glance the colonel. He couldn’t seem to make his tense muscles stand down from his confrontation with Howard. God only knows what was about to come out of his father’s mouth now that their commanding officer was here.
Bucky moaned louder when Steve’s fingers changed their angle, and fresh pleasure shot through his body. He wanted to move and chase the feeling. He needed more, but he would wait. They would give him what he needed.
Steve was horrified. Tony’s shoulders, waist, hips, hell even his calves where Steve had grabbed him to move his legs at one point, were already forming a fresh pattern of bruises and popped vessels.
Bucky flashed to the moment he tried to take Tony’s shirt off. The harsh snap of Tony’s voice had shocked him so deeply it almost hurt. Tony had never spoken like that to them before, but once Tony apologized and explained why, Bucky’s heart melted a little.
“You should listen to him about those things,” Steve sassed back, “Lord knows you don’t have any manners of your own, jerk.”
Steve really didn’t look like he could handle hearing any more at the moment as looked back toward the man.
“I do,” Steve admitted as his fingers continued their caresses on Bucky’s scalp, “Just like I still love you.”
“It wasn’t enough that yours was technically the longest already?” Tony teased with a smile. “You had to add a couple inches and some girth?”
“Sorry. Pulled a marathon in the lab. Almost forgot I had an appointment with Strange this morning.”
No one had ever asked Steve that question since he’d woken from the ice. Who wants to ask a hero if his greatest sacrifice had really been an act of cowardice? “I didn’t want to die,” Steve told him. “Not really. But I didn’t want to live either. It was the same on the heli-carrier. I’d have rather died than go through losing you again.”
Tony decided that the boys had been through too much today to go forward with his plans for a special evening of celebration. He got them to relax as he made some sandwiches. Steve had balked that Tony had worked all day, and he could do it, but Tony wasn’t having it. That kind of anxiety was exhausting, and they’d lived with it all day.
“Defended yourself against four assholes who were lookin’ for a fight?” Bucky interrupted. “Against the same guys who have tried to make Steve’s life miserable for years?”
Tony realized that he was living a historic moment. Most of the country had probably grinded to a halt and was listening with bated breath for the summation of this speech and the decision of Congress. He realized that most of the world was probably also listening in, waiting to see if America would join the fray and push back. They were the only superpower not on the board at this point besides Russia, and they would join shortly after the U.S. did if he remembered correctly.
“I don’t,” Bucky said honestly, obviously surprising Steve. “Think about it. Think about how he treated us when he arrived in the past. How hard he tried to prove that he was useful and could pull his own weight. How he went out of his way to defend us, take care of us and everyone who needed it. I’m not sayin’ I want him feeling bad about himself because God knows he doesn’t need help with that. But think of the way he treated you and talked to you, to us. He built you and me up as the best men he’d known, and I think a lot of that had to do with him holdin’ onto those words you’d said as an ideal. It was his second chance, and he wanted to get it right.”
“But,” Steve stammered, “but not really ours. He’s our friend, yes, but not like we have some claim to him. Because what we have is ours, and Tony is his. He’s not like us and…”
He’d work around it; he always did. Luckily, Bucky always seemed eager to take him. It was a reassuring thought as he added a third finger and stretched Steve open even further, causing his lover’s head to bow forward as he made the sweetest sound of desperation. Fuck, Tony loved this, needed this. Nothing else mattered but the three of them, here and together.
Bucky swallowed his food before answering. “They’re healin’ up pretty well. The doc at the med tent said there wasn’t infection, so that’s lucky. They weren’t too serious to be honest.”
Tony kinda wanted to cry. The difference was heartbreaking. This must be how Steve felt every day. For Tony to see the sparkle that played in those eyes, even as they slightly narrowed in suspicion, and know what they would one day become, was like a knife. Fucking Hydra.
“It was a choice I agreed to,” Tony told him. “It was that or stay in the lab. Do you want me to be able to come along and help you, or not?”
. When I felt too dumb for school, he’d help. He never judged me, and he always found a way to explain it so I would understand. When I felt powerless because of the shit at home, he’d always make me feel strong, like I could do anything. When my old man would tell me I was worthless so many times I’d believe him, Stevie just…He’d act like I was the greatest person in the world. He’d look up to me. The best guy I knew looked up to
“Don’t stop,” Steve commanded as he once again tugged at his fistful of Tony’s hair, his grip tight. “I want to know what he feels like.” Steve told him. “So whatever Bucky does to you, I want to feel you do it to me.” His upper body leaned forward as his ass was pushed more firmly into Tony’s face. “Fuck him with your tongue, love. I want to feel him moan against me.”
Tony suppressed a shiver. It was these moments when Steve was so much like his Captain America persona that it threw Tony off balance. The stubborn, challenging set of his jaw and determined look in his eyes was something Tony had seen every time they were called out to fight. Steve’s inner strength was stronger than his shield.
Thank Odin that the beds were still pushed together. He turned them and gently pushed Steve down on the bed before turning to pull Bucky in and kiss him thoroughly. Breaking apart he met Bucky’s eyes and said, “It’s been a while since I was with a man, much less two at once.” He turned to Steve. “I’m gonna take good care of you, baby boy.”
“Steve!” He distantly heard beside him and realized it was Bucky. He couldn’t even enjoy the concern he heard in his friend’s voice because the phantom voices in his mind were growing louder. He recognized them all, but they shouldn’t be there together. Those voices were long past him, and Tony was…
“Not anymore,” Bucky told him in that too honest way he did now. “That’s alright Steve. I know it’s not because I make you unhappy. At least, I know that now. You worry about me, and I know that you should. I also know that it’s not a bad thing that you worry. You’ve always done better when you had someone to take care of. It brings out the best in you.”
“It’s been said,” Steve agreed, “but I’m not wrong about this. I know you think I’m foolish and sentimental. I know you don’t believe you’re worth saving or that you can be saved, and in a way you’re right.”
They had come home on Thanksgiving day. Steve was supposed to stay on bedrest for another day or two, so it was Tony and Bucky who cooked their holiday dinner, Tony decided soup would be best for Steve and followed a recipe he’d been taught by the younger man a few weeks before. Their meal was modest but delicious. The hot soup warmed their chilled bones, and they all sighed as they finished eating.
“If anyone could, it would be him.” Bucky answered softly. “Tony’s stronger than anyone gives him credit for. Like you reminded me earlier, he would wait forever for us, and Tony keeps his promises.”
And sure enough, Tony heard the voice of the Speaker of the House announce the President to Congress. After a few moments, static filled murmurs and voices died as he began his address,
“How did he hear about you?” Steve asked. “It’s not that I don’t know you’re brilliant because you are, but how did a colonel in the U.S. army hear about you?”
The day passed by smoothly, and he was able to catch up on the jobs he’d had to delay. Apologizing repeatedly to his customers that he wasn’t able to get to them sooner and thanking them for waiting for him to get to it and not go to someone else for their repairs.
“And this is what I do,” Tony said as he paused to look at them. “Most of my life, I didn’t have family, so I learned to make my own, and it means more to me than anything I ever had. Anything. I’ve seen enough to know the kind of people you are, and it goes beyond being good soldiers. So, at least for this week, let me repay you how I can.”
They cuddled for a while, trading kisses and lazy touches before cleaning themselves up and getting dressed. Tony did eventually have to go to work. He kissed them thoroughly before leaving and worked his hardest throughout the day so he could get back home to them on time.
Steve sniffed, trying to finish as he watched a tear fall down Bucky’s cheek. “And when I collapsed at the Sanctum this morning, I heard you panic. You were worried about me. You’ve always worried about me and taken care of me. So, yes, you are my hero, and I’d bet my life that you have a soul. I know you do because it’s the same one I fell in love with when I was fifteen.”
The two boys chuckled and went to start putting the much appreciated groceries away. Steve ended up cooking a beef and potato stew with carrots. It was the best Tony had ever had.
Tony sagged against the back of the booth and looked up to the ceiling. It was so surreal to be called out on this. He’d spent the past two years pretending to be what he is and knowing he had to keep this secret, and here was this man telling him point blank that he saw through the charade.
Howard laughed at that. “I don’t see myself married with kids. I’d be horrible at it, and I don’t like failing at something.”
Tony stayed in bed for three days after that before Steve and Bucky grudgingly let him get back to work. It had been a long three days.
Steve sighed as he set down the knife on the cutting board. “I guess,” he began slowly, forcing the truth from his lips, “it was too painful.” He looked up to meet Bucky’s eyes. “It reminded me too much of before. I always cooked for you, and now I remember cooking for you and Tony, but before it was just too difficult to separate the past from the present. Back then, every day I would cook and know you were on your way home to me. You would walk through our door and pull me into a hug or kiss.”
“You should sleep, Barnes.” Dugan grumbled across from him. “It’ll be your watch before ya know it.”
As the soldier she was addressing was dismissed, Agent Carter looked up and spotted them. Her face was one of surprise. “Captain Rogers, I just saw part of your show. I’m sorry the men were so rude to you, but I got called away and couldn’t finish watching. How are you?”
“The paper boy, Tony,” Bucky answered patiently, shaking his head. “The one you just tipped twenty cents. That’s gonna buy him candy for at least a week.”
“There’s a guy who sometimes buys them.” Steve answered sheepishly. “He knows the guy who prints them.”
Steve nodded. “I’m good now. I shoulda known better.” Shaking his head, “The cold air wasn’t doing me any favors, and then I let myself get worked up on my way home.”
Bucky's terror is very understandable as it also showcases their neighbors cruelty at threatening to help send them there. For me, it's even sadder when I think of how Bucky's ultimate fate was to land in the hands of similarly cruel men. Knowing this, I don't think Tony's reaction was too extreme. If faced with the alternative, I'd rather risk a prison sentence for murder as a heterosexual man than find myself in one of those places labeled as an invert. In my mind it's self defense, and he is also protecting Steve and Bucky.
“I can spell,” the man cut him off before his face fell to finally show a new emotion, and that tired sadness was worse than the man’s usual cutting words. He rose from his seat and grabbed a stack of papers. “I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I care to count, but the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.”
Bucky and Steve had taken off after them, and Bucky was worrying how to protect Steve and Tony when they entered the mouth of the alley and stopped dead in shock.
discuss it. He did play referee when things got a little too loud, but he made a point to comment that he understood both of their positions.
“Don’t you call me a little shit on a regular basis?” Steve asked as he raised an eyebrow. “How can you act surprised that I would use this to my advantage?”
, he thought, he’d never had this. Two people he loved more than anything surrounding him and giving him everything he liked for the sole purpose of using and pleasuring him. It was almost overwhelming.
Fuck, Steve felt so good around him. His small hips held tight in Tony’s hands as he pushed forward again into the blonde. He would wreck Steve just like he promised, but he had to make sure Steve was ready. He would never want to really hurt Steve by not taking a few slower thrusts to fully open him. Plus, he kind of wanted Steve to beg a little more. It had been a long week.
“One of these places is here in New York. The people there were wary and dismissive of me at first, which was understandable. Eventually, I earned enough of their trust for them to pull back the curtain for me, for lack of a better term. They even taught me to sense a few things beyond the reality of what is perceived.”
He got up and hurried off to the kitchen, trying to shake off the serious tone that things had taken. How they had gone from a simple opening of presents to that mushy display, he didn’t know. It seemed to be a normal occurrence around the younger men.
He had a split lip. His nose had a trickle of blood coming out, and the skin around his right eye was already swelling and darkening. He was going to have one hell of a shiner. His knuckles were busted up too. So he’d landed a few punches, at least. Good for him.
It was order and chaos rolled into one. Machines that were one of a kind were stationed throughout the large room. Tools Bucky didn’t know the name of were resting on the tops of stainless steel tables. Holographic images of various pieces of technology revolved in midair as scrolling text ran beneath them. Most of them were scientific equations that Bucky couldn’t guess the meanings to.
Tony felt another tear roll down his cheek as he worked his throat around Bucky. He was theirs, body and soul. It was all he could think as he let himself go, focusing only on the words being spoken and the sensations running through him.
Barnes was damn near untouchable in Tony’s tower. It was a fortress, and Tony was wealthy enough and connected enough to go toe-to-toe with the justice system, pentagon, Department of Defense or any other institution that would inevitably call for Barnes’s head. Tony’s lawyers were always on retainer and earned every cent Tony paid them.
Tony just barely had time to catch his balance before he would have been knocked over as he heard the sound of several items falling to the sidewalk. He instinctively reached out a hand to steady the man who’d collided with him.
They both groaned, and he held still to give Bucky time to adjust. “Fuck, sweetheart, you feel so good.” He said breathlessly, and Bucky clenched around him at the praise. “So good for me,” he repeated as he squeezed both hips in his hands, getting a firm grip then began to move.
“You alright, Mister?” But Tony was already walking away, walking fast as if he could outrun his thoughts because this couldn’t be happening. How? How…
“Wait!” Carter stopped him, “You shouldn’t be doing this; you’re a civilian. You don’t have training or an attack plan.”
“Yes,” Steve groaned as his hips began to move faster. “Love the way your beard feels on my skin. Love your mouth. Fuucckk…” he moaned as his ground himself down on Tony’s tongue.
“I know,” Steve told. “Mine too, and I’m worried about him. I’m worried what he’s going through and what that could end up doing to him.”
, and Tony couldn’t stand the thought that his act hadn’t fooled them at all, and they had worried because of it. It was the very thing he’d been trying to prevent.
Tony crossed over to look in the age worn mirror above the dresser. His face stared back at him as he
The plane felt like little more than a bucket of bolts to Tony, but he didn’t care. They were on their way. He had already secured his parachute and was helping Steve with his own as he talked the other man through how to properly use it. He was also silently grateful that this Steve hadn’t yet developed his future habit of jumping from planes without one.
As the water ran over his body, he remembered that Christmas was almost here, and he hadn’t gotten them anything. What the fuck was wrong with him? He’d decided on their gifts weeks ago. He promised himself to try harder.
“No, Tony,” Steve said rolling his eyes fondly. “Me and Buck just decided it had been too long since we’ve gone to our favorite place.”
“Nothing,” Steve shrugged it off, “I caught the edge of a trash can with the back of my head after that last punch.”
He leaned forward and began kissing along Bucky’s chest, and he was melting as he felt both of their mouths on him. He let himself get lost in the sensation of their hands and lips moving over his skin. He felt small between them, but he knew he was safe. He was safe, and nothing hurt.
“Oh my, God, your bleeding.” Bucky cried out as his eyes darted over to the knife on the ground then back to Tony’s reddened shirt before the two men rushed to his sides. “He stabbed you! Oh, shit!”
Jacobson was riding up front with the driver. The man had looked livid when he’d seen Tony board the ship to bring them here. Before he could say anything, however, Tony had just turned his head and stared the man down. His face had been cold, as if daring the man to speak and promising that he wouldn’t like the consequences of it. Jacobson had just turned and walked away.
Erskine’s eyes shone behind his glasses as he smiled. “Aren’t you taking a risk telling me this? What if I choose wrong now?”
“We should be able to drop you right on their doorstep,” Howard called from the front of the plane. “You sure it’s really a good idea to have Anthony going with you?”
Tony smiled softly as he remembered that this would be a big culture shock for the two of them. “I met Francesco a couple of weeks ago after I helped his daughter out of a bad situation. Remember the car that I fixed a couple blocks from our apartment?”
“Dugan, who’s here? How many of us did they take? How long have I been out?” He whispered urgently, preparing himself for the worst as he tried to ignore the stiffness in his body.
Steve and Tony both watched his hunger with sadness, but Steve had to give Tony credit, when he spoke again, his voice was trying to be upbeat. “It came with a chocolate bar,” Tony said as he put it down on Bucky’s thigh, “It got a little smushed, but ya know…chocolate.”
Tony nodded and blew out a stream of breath slowly, trying to relax at the impending “consultation”. He saw it more as a mind fuck.
“I’m not Joe Collins, or the assholes like him. Believe me, I get doing what you have to do to survive. Been there.”
“I’m ready for my gift, Mr. Barnes.” He said as he pulled the paper from his hands. He’d already read it today, and Tony didn’t want him stressing out over a lack of available employment.
“Yeah,” Clint chimed in. “Wouldn’t there be some alternate timeline that Stark created with a new Cap and Barnes? And how come none of us are affected? I mean, I know we weren’t there like they were, but I don’t think anything I’ve learned from history has changed, and if someone was going to change history just by being in the past, it would be Stark. He ain’t exactly low profile.”
Tony’s face softened as he looked at his worried partner. At least Steve was worried about him leaving for the right reasons. “Steve, I told you I’m fine. Yes, I’m sore and bruised and will shamelessly exploit that when we get home and have you play nurse for me, but I don’t need to be here. You’ll see,” Tony assured him, “when the casts come off, and I walk out of here, or roll out here. They will probably insist on that silly rule about wheeling me out in a chair, but you’ll see. The images were faulty, and it made it look more serious than it was.”
Bucky and Steve both shook their heads as Tony began to pull him along toward the door and Steve followed.
“Is this strange, Buck? That we both fell for the same guy when we’re already together?” Steve wondered before remembering. “Lucille and her roommates, Tony said the three of them were probably in a relationship or somethin’. That means it has to be, I dunno, OK? Tony seemed to know somethin’ about it.”
But Steve spoke over him. “I was gone for two hours, Buck. When I came back, he’d just finished fixing the water heater.”
of Steve. The blonde pushed his hips forward again, not stopping until Bucky’s nose was pressed against him, and stayed there. Tony started to lightly grind himself against the mattress as he watched Bucky work his throat, swallowing around the head of Steve’s cock, until Steve pulled back and let him breathe.
They were both crying. The sadness of what had been lost and taken was mixed with the relief of finally finding each other again. Bucky couldn’t even tell who was holding the other one up. Maybe they were both supporting each other, like they always had, like they always would. His Stevie, his doll, was in his arms again, and he remembered, not everything but enough. He didn’t have to be an asset or a dog or an almost person. He could try to be Bucky, a new Bucky. It was more hope than he’d ever let himself have. A hope that he had been too damaged to realize he should have had.
“What’d you say to me?” Joe snarled. Tony swore he could see a vein throb on the side of his overlarge forehead. “Piece of shit, ya think you’re better than us because ya fix broken lamps? I bet you’re just as big an invert as Rogers. If Barnes wasn’t such a slut for anything in a skirt, I’d think he was fuckin’ both of ya.”
Climbing the stairs to the apartment was tiring, and he felt every freshly healed bone protest over having to support him up to their floor, but he could only bring himself to lean on Steve so much. His bones could just groan all they wanted.
Tony released the arm only to grab his shoulders to pull him down as he brought his knee up. As it made contact with the guys stomach, the air rushed out of him in a groan as he fell to his knees. Tony delivered a well-aimed punch that knocked him out cold.
“Ok, you’ve proven that you’re very romantic. Now open the letter.” Steve was trying hard not to seem affected by Tony’s attention, but the pink tint to his cheeks and the curve of his lips told another story.
The next morning was much the same as the first but with little differences. Bucky cooked eggs and toast, but today also had bacon. And coffee. Tony had ground and pressed the beans himself with the ancient little device he’d found in a cupboard. It was pretty good.
The outer yard was a mess of fire, bodies, and destruction. The far wall in front of them had been blasted open. The hole was large enough for a tank, and Steve was grateful that leaving the base would not be a problem for them.
“I doubt you could get past his mustache,” Monty chimed in wearily. “It is a ferocious looking thing.”
“Where did you get this wine?” He asked as he gathered the bottles and began to store them in the top of the icebox. He may be a common repairman, but there was no way he was drinking un-chilled Chardonnay.
One of the guards stepped forward to unlock the cage as Bucky saw the men inside step back from them.
“Steve!” The young blonde finally stopped his worrying and looked up to meet Tony’s eyes. “Let’s hold off on giving me more opiates for now. I’m alright, baby, but I’m thirsty. Could I please have some water?”
Bucky’s breathy laugh was half nerves, half relief. “God, Tony, I don’t think I’ve ever seen him calm down that quickly.” Rubbing his face he continued, “I never knew to do any of those things.” He pulled back a little from Steve. “You alright, punk? You scared the shit outta me.”
It was early in the morning as Bucky sat at the island of the communal kitchen drinking a glass of juice. He watched as Steve stood in front of the stove cooking breakfast. Since arriving here, Bucky had put on twenty more pounds of muscle from the regular meals the Avengers made for him, and he was now the size of Steve, only one or so inches shorter. More importantly, he realized he was beginning to look forward to eating. It wasn’t just a necessary function; he liked the feeling of being full. Before arriving, he had never noticed the near constant hunger his enhanced body had been going through.
Tony gently cupped the side of Bucky’s face and lifted his head to meet Tony’s eyes. He softly rubbed his thumb along his cheekbone and said, “I’m so proud of you, sweetheart, so happy you listened and waited to find a job you wanted. I love you so much, sweet boy.”
They listened to the radio while they worked. Tony vaguely recognizing a few of the songs, but as the morning passed he found himself liking the soft tenor of the old tunes. Who would have thought?
She had happily agreed to it. She wasn’t looking for any man to come around and try for her attention; she was enjoying her independence. She and Tony had built a good friendship over the past several months. She was even close with Steve and Bucky, and all three of them shared dinner together at least once a week. Tony had even met her brother and his
“It’s better.” Steve told him. “Once I stopped fighting the new memories, they just kind of started falling into place naturally. It’s pretty easy to ignore for the most part.”
For one of the first times during sex, he felt that he could let himself fall, and they would catch him. The knowledge left him dizzy as their lips and warm bodies comforted him.
Of course Bucky obeyed, and Tony didn’t have much choice but to moan at the sinful swirl he made with his tongue. He soon felt Bucky start to push his way into Tony’s partially loosened hole, so he did his best to mimic the movements with Steve. Pointing his tongue he pressed against the ring of muscle. He continued his thrusting movements until he finally pushed past it and into Steve.
“It’s not stupid,” Tony corrected, “but this?” He said as he ran his hand around to Steve’s back. “It’s just skin, baby. It’s just muscle. I loved you before, and I love you now. I don’t care if you’re taller or shorter than me. The only thing that has changed is the amount of time it’ll take for me to kiss you from head to toe.”
“Naw,” Steve drawled as his mouth formed a smirk. “I’m thinkin’ that I oughtta just keep tawkin’ to tha guy like the Irish punk that I am. So’s what if he don’t like it, right? Too bad for ‘im.”
“It is absolutely necessary, Tony.” Dr. Abrams’s voice was firmer than before. “Truthfully, you should not be awake right now, much less this aware and energetic. We have no idea as to why you are recovering so quickly.”
Tony laid down and pulled a blanket over his whole body, hiding his face along with his shame. He could feel the sticky mess cooling in his pants and knew it would be an uncomfortable experience in the morning when he’d go to clean himself. He didn’t care. He deserved it. The dried come would remind him of how inappropriate these thoughts were, and how wrong he’d been to have them.
“I swear to you, Steve, that I will be there the whole time. I have helped design and build every piece of machinery. I have gone over every equation at least five times. I will not let anything happen to you.”
“It’s understandable,” Bruce said in that compassionate way of his. “With how you must have had to hide your relationship, and everything that has happened since then, it’s perfectly reasonable that you kept this private.”
“What about the others?” Steve asked because he had to hope for something. Maybe Bucky wasn’t dead. Maybe they could find him. They didn’t have proof he was dead. Steve couldn’t believe that until he had proof. “Are you planning a rescue mission?”
“I can explain,” he started, but he honestly had no good reason for this. He was tired and in pain, and seeing them just brought back the memory of what he’d been trying to escape.
Steve gave a small smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Yeah, Buck can really move. You should see him when he’s really showing off.”
Dum Dum smiled as he lifted his pack to move to the next body. “I’ll do better than that, Sarge. We make it back, and the first three rounds are on me.”
” Tony sat in his workshop, speaking to someone on the monitor in front of him. He looked tired and angry. His cheek had oil smeared across it as he thrummed his fingers against the desktop in aggravation.
They walked for two blocks until they arrived at a diner that sold the best cup of coffee Tony had found so far in this time. It was fairly crowded, but they found a booth for themselves towards the back. After the waitress had brought them their drinks, coffee for Tony and hot chocolate for Steve, they slowly sipped in companionable silence. Of course it was Tony who spoke first.
“Images,” Tony corrected. “you said images. How many did you take?” He asked, wondering how many times his body had been subjected to the radiation. Not that he had to worry, probably, since he was healing from everything else, but it still bothered him that he hadn’t even been awake to oversee their use of the machine.
Tony kept stroking his hair, using the hand that had only recently made him share in Bucky’s torture. Now, it was as if it had never troubled him. Bucky was safe now, and the proof was in Tony’s hand.
“Damn Sarge,” Dugan said to his right, “Must be at least twenty bodies here. One heck of a plan you had.”
be Bucky with everything that came with it. He’d probably just hate himself more than he already did once he discovered what was lost, what could have been, what
They sat there for almost two hours, talking and laughing and getting refills. Tony was having the most fun he’d had on a date in a long time. The thought stopped him cold.
“Does it feel good, Buck?” Steve panted as he continued moving in his mouth. “I know you have a thing for his mouth.” This was news to Tony. “I bet it feels better than you thought about. Wonder how it’s gonna feel when he takes you inside him, that smart mouth you love wrapped around your dick.”
He calmly approached Steve’s bedside, keeping eye contact with him the entire time. “With your permission, Captain, I would need to touch you.”
“Signor Martinelli!” Tony said as he clasped hands with one of his newest friends. “Spero tu stia bene?”
Steve smiled at his best friend. “I’d like either of you doin’ it. You know how much I love your mouth, Buck.” He breathed in again. “But I was wondering what it’d be like to have Tony do more of those things to me. You know, hold me down and make me feel good.”
“Steve, I need you to jump over that gap.” Tony said as he finished and put his hands on to Steve’s shoulders, looking into his eyes. “I need you to jump over there, take this rope and secure it as tightly as you can to the railing. I’ll have the other end.”
God that man was amazing. He’d protected them. Again. Bucky didn’t know if he should be more upset at the thought that Tony essentially admitted he would have disposed of Byrne if it had come down to it. Probably, his mind supplied, but when he thought of the alternative, the harsh action didn’t seem that extreme. Especially when he thought of how Tony had put it. If it’s them or me, it will be them.
“He’ll get here.” Bucky said, probably reassuring them both. “We’ll get him back, and the three of us can be the tragic mess we were meant to be.”
“Of course, Steve,” Tony replied as he set his book to the side and met his eyes. Steve could have sworn that some of the warmth that had once lived in their depths had faded, but he carried on. He needed to tell Tony what he’d done.
“I would, really, but I’m new to this neighborhood and seem to have gotten lost. I don’t think I should just keep wandering around blindly. You never know what kind of people are waiting to take advantage of the vulnerable.” Tony rambled as he slowly drew closer to the group of assholes. “I mean, this is the first alley I turn into, and I stumble across a herd of troglodytes beating on a man half their size. I really don’t want to go find worse because, honestly? This little scene has made me sick to my stomach.”
And then he really started moving. The squeaking of the bed grew faster and louder as their gasps and moans rose in volume and frequency. The faint sound of flesh slapping flesh echoed through the door that separated them from Tony and Steve.
“It was that bad.” Steve corrected. “He called me an old man, said I wore a spangly outfit and wasn’t of use.”
“Hey, hey, hey. Barnes,” Anthony Stark was talking, but it was scared. It could hear the electric machines in the room, and it couldn’t comply with orders it didn’t understand.
Steve and the men around him watched Tony go toward another group where a few men seemed to be bandaging the wounded. Once he was gone, the men turned to look at Steve expectantly. An Asian man with a gun resting against his shoulder asked, “What now, Captain? What are your orders?”
He was actually doing this. He was about to actively take part in WW2 as a member of the Howling Commandos. He knew he shouldn’t, but Tony was never very good at doing the things he was supposed to do. Besides, how much history can one guy in a team of eight really change, especially when he would be trying his hardest to remain a mystery. People wouldn’t know his name. They wouldn’t look at a decades old photograph and say, “Oh my God, that’s Tony Stark!”
He looked to Steve. “What you are experiencing has very similar themes to a tale I heard in my youth. My mother had taught it to my brother and I as a lesson on caution when dealing with those who possess great power in the mystic arts. The spell that was used in the story left a very specific mark upon those involved. There is a way to test this.”
“I miss him, Steve,” Bucky confessed with burning eyes, feeling both weak and strong by saying it. “I’m glad you’re with me, and I love you, but I miss him so much.”
Tony’s mind flashed back to the helicarrier when he’d offered Captain America a blueberry. “Yeah, blueberries are my favorite.”
Eventually, Steve exited the shower. He wrapped a towel around his hips after drying himself and brushed his teeth. As he opened the bathroom door that connected to his rather luxurious bedroom, Steve froze when he saw that he wasn’t alone. Bucky was standing by the doorway to the room, looking uncertain of his presence being welcome.
Tony had to believe that Howard was deluding himself so he could fast track his work. It was always one of Howard’s greatest shortcomings, his impatience. He always had to be moving on to bigger and better things while never taking the time to perfect what he’d created so that it reached it’s fullest potential. Just look at the arc reactor technology that had been shelved for decades until Tony revisited it. Howard created something, got credit for it and moved on.
for years too.” She teared up a little as she continued. “And now I get to see him whenever I want, without making an excuse to my husband, who never liked my brother. That’s another blessing to come from him leaving, even unexpectedly like this.”
Steve smiled. “He did have kind of an unfair advantage with that. He took a crash course on how hard-headed I can be when we first met. Did I ever tell you about that?”
After a few hard thrusts of his finger, Steve firmly pushed the second in alongside it. The burn of the stretch made Tony want to gasp and caused him to choke around Bucky who was planted deep down his throat. It felt so good. The stretch of his ass mirrored the stretch of his throat perfectly, and Tony was so thankful that Bucky was thicker than average. His throat would be raw after this.
When they pulled apart, Steve softly smiled at Bucky who smiled shyly in return. “I love you, Bucky.”
“I can fend for myself, you know.” He said in mock indignation. “But it doesn’t matter anyway. I, uh, have a date tonight too,” he ended sheepishly.
It was like the love Tony had for the two of them. He loved them both, but in different ways for different reasons. He loved Steve for a lot of the same reasons he’d respected Cap. His honesty, bravery, sense of right and wrong and sassy mouth all attracted Tony’s attention and gained his admiration. His artistic talent, his humility, the soft blush of his skin and his kindness had captivated Tony. Also, his pies were fucking delicious. He was a beautiful contradiction, the future officer and constant gentleman. The heart of the fiercest fighter in a small, seemingly fragile package. He was anything but fragile.
As he lay on the couch waiting for sleep, Tony looked out the small window across the living space to the fuzzy lights of the city. The past two days played through his mind. He was trapped in 1939. He had, as of right now, no way to get home. He had no valid I.D. or personal records of any kind. He couldn’t prove that he’d gone to school or was even supposed to be in this country.
“My little soldier,” Tony murmured before he resumed his earlier thrusts and pulled Steve down onto him. Tony’s hips and hands were working in perfect tandem as he fucked into Steve like his life depended on it. Sweat covered both of their bodies, and the hot dampness of their sliding skin mirrored the wet heat that Tony was burying himself in. It was so good, so rough. It was always this way with Steve, animalistic abandon as their two bodies crashed together over and over again.
“Then, it’s just a wake up before we ride southwest about fifty kilometers to the camp where setup will begin. The first show will begin at two, I hope, because I really don’t want to have to hear that man bitch about lost time again.” Tony said as he laid down the file he’d been reading from, only to begin rubbing the top of his right hand with his left as if trying to warm it or ease an ache. He’d started doing that the day before, Steve had noted. His foot was still moving a mile a minute.
“Spoil sport,” but it lacked any conviction. He didn’t really want a drink, hadn’t for a while, and wasn’t that something? They got up, making sure Bucky saw them headed to the door. Tony mimed the universal sign for drinking as he brought his hand to his mouth like he had a cup in it. Bucky frowned, but nodded.
that I don’t need all of this. I’m not going to stay here just because they don’t want to admit that they messed up.”
“Thank you,” Tony choked as he hugged him closer. He only wished he could have it ready when the time came to help save Bucky.
Thankfully, before anything worse could be yelled at him, the music began again as the girls from the group began hurrying onto the stage. Steve saw a few of them smile encouragingly at him as they passed, giving him their permission to leave while they tried to calm the angry men. He would be forever grateful to them for that.
Tony shrugged, trying to keep Bucky focused on the conversation. “The rest of the men that were rescued are on the boats, but Steve requested that us and the others travel with him.”
Howard eyes were skeptical as he looked over Tony’s face, trying to read the new man before him. With the evaluation finally done, Howard smirked. Good. He was about to underestimate Tony.
The woman looked less than impressed by that, for which Tony was grateful. He didn’t need her to run into Howard’s arms from Steve’s lack of interest and somehow become Tony’s mother in some time travel catastrophe. Just... no.
Bucky came back to himself in a cold sweat, still feeling the burning pain of his memory. He didn’t realize at first that the screams he heard weren’t from this latest recollection but were coming from him now. He was thrashing against something big and solid that was trying to hold him down
Tony’s Daddy Issues Alarm sounded in his head, and he wondered what to do. Was this socially acceptable in this time? It hardly was in his time, unless the guy was rich, but he wasn’t rich here. He was just Tony Stark, discount repairman.
It looks at the arms of the weapon. It looks at its own arm. Functionality: Near Critical-Maintenance Required
“And this will make that easier for you,” Steve finished for him. “Having a way to defend yourself, or a possible way of defending yourself.”
An alarm in Tony’s brain began to wail out a warning. The sweetness in her voice made his balls tighten like they were trying to climb up into him and hide. Tony tried at charming nonchalance.
When Bucky nodded, Tony cracked them open and added them to the flour, tossing the shells into the trashcan he’d pulled up next to him.
“Where did you think we should start?” Steve asked as they left the backstage area and moved to the compound. “I don’t think any of those soldiers are gonna want to talk to me.”
Playing along with a dramatically sincere voice, Tony asked, “What do want, Steve? Gold? Jewels? Candy for breakfast? The earth itself? You have only to ask, and I will give it to you or die trying.”
They looked mildly surprised at that but recovered quickly. Monty smiled, “Perhaps in time we shall. You may not feel the need of the title, Captain, but you most certainly earned it.”
The farther they went, Bucky felt his senses becoming sharper, and it was easier to walk, then almost run. He finally allowed himself to believe this was happening. His partners had come for him and were rescuing him from hell.
“I’m not going anywhere if it’s not to follow you into battle.” Tony told him, probably being more truthful than he should.
“I don’t know what half this stuff is.” Bucky said as he looked at the menu. “I don’t speak Italian food. Oh, look, they have spaghetti!”
Bucky moved to deepen the kiss, and Tony enthusiastically returned it. The older man turned to press against his side, and Bucky could feel Tony’s own morning arousal along with the scars that covered the front of his body. Bucky hadn’t gotten to feel them like this last night, and he wondered if it was wrong of him to enjoy the texture of them rubbing against him. The proof of Tony’s strength etched in his skin.
“It is I who am thanking you. You helped mio famiglia. I am happy to host you.” Martinelli turned to Steve and Bucky as he pulled open the curtain to reveal a private room. “Mr. Stark is a very kind man.”
It didn’t know what the voices meant. It didn’t know why looking at the weapon made the voices speak, but as it continued to look at the weapon, it heard another voice. The voice of a child.
“Alright,” he accepted, “but just so you know, I’ve never done this before and barely know the difference between this thing’s shoulders and its ass.”
Steve rushed forward and put a hand on the cast over Tony’s shoulder. “Tony, please calm down!” The worry in his voice was about one of the only things that could have gotten Tony’s attention. Tony stopped his movements and looked at Steve. His beautiful blue eyes were tired and sunken into his face from the recent stress he’d gone through.
He turned and walked to the door, stopping only when he heard them call out from behind him. He turned to calm them. “It’s going to be alright. I’ll handle this.”
“You’re volunteering for active duty?” Phillips asked surprised, and if Tony didn’t know better, a little impressed.
He looked back to Bucky, “When I heard you, it sounded like Steve was pretty dominant towards the end. Is that what you mean by not in control?”
“The shirt stays on!” He snapped, instantly regretting it when they both flinched. He took a deep breath and tried to explain. “It’s…I have a lot of scarring. I don’t let people see it. Trust me, you don’t want to.”
Here it is! This was the longest and hardest chapter to write. I actually wrote an entirely different 2nd half the first time I wrote this, but I was not happy with it. At all. So, I reread the story, some of the chapters several times before I then came back and created this. Now I feel that the characterizations are more natural and make sense with what I'd established.
He could fix this, make the best of this situation and not crumble under the panic that still whirled in the back of his mind. He was Tony Stark, after all.
Steve’s pupils expanded, and he shivered at his words. Apparently, Steve really liked that so he filed it away under the
“What?” Bucky shrugged, “I like Avery toons, and it was funny.” It really had been, and Bucky had liked the funny way the rabbit had outsmarted the pig with a gun. Tony had taken him to see another one before he went to training. Bucky loved that rabbit.
He soon moved on to the second finger, working Steve open as he scissored and fucked both of them into his tight ass.
“We’re not talking to those assholes,” Tony said distractedly as he walked with purpose across the yard. He seemed to know the direction he wanted to go, so Steve followed along beside him.
“Oh god, not that death machine,” Tony muttered. X-ray safety was still unreliable at this time, at least to Tony’s standards.
“I think I remember that.” Tony said, working his memory as the fog slowly cleared. “I’m glad he’s alright.”
Poor Bucky, but at least he has Steve to remind him of the goodness that was always in him. Steve Rogers's Heart of Gold™ to the rescue.
Over Bucky’s shoulder Tony could see Steve looking at the enlistment center. He had to keep Bucky occupied and hope Steve would sneak off like Tony was hoping he’d do. So, Tony kept talking.
“All I can sense is the remnants of a powerful spell.” Thor said from across the room near the grand staircase. His keen blue eyes were serious as he continued. “But this is the home of sorcerers, I do not know if it is related to Stark’s disappearance. If it is, I am not learned enough in magic to distinguish the purpose of the spell.” The thunder god looked to Steve unhappily. “I am sorry, my friend. I wish I could be of more use.”
“Ready when you are, Cap,” Tony told him before they quickly moved to position. “When I give the signal, Steve, throw me into the back. I’m good, but I can’t run as fast as a truck.”
Tony looked around at the soldiers enjoying their cigarettes, and he tried to feel a little better at the fact that they seemed happier. He could see on the interface from his glasses that their stress levels were down and their serotonin levels were much better. A little bit of happiness could that. He would admit snapping at that poor young man was not his finest moment. He hadn’t deserved that despite snorting at Steve’s rank. Any of these young boys, and they were all so young, could have been his Bucky. Scared, tired and missing their loved ones while knowing that at any minute they could be fighting for their lives.
Steve’s face became filled with empathy. “Me too. Sometimes I can picture him in the audience, laughing at me as I move on stage saying all that crap.”
Steve then reached forward and signaled with a touch for Bucky to stand. He gave Bucky a gentle kiss filled with affection before he turned to Tony and pulled him forward by the neck to kiss him far more harshly than Bucky. He dominated the kiss as his tongue pushed its way into Tony’s mouth, licked across the edge of his teeth before going deeper, and Tony submitted.
“Damn man, you’re crazier than I thought.” Gabe said with a trace of admiration. “Any other secrets I should know?”
“Well, since my date seems to be powdering her nose with that guy who works at the deli, you wanna get the hell out of here? I need coffee. Or scotch. Or both.”
Tony was ineligible because of his previous wounds and reduced lung capacity, and Steve was denied for every other reason. Bucky, of course, was accepted, and his name and information would be transferred to the armed forces. He could be sent a letter and shipped off to boot camp at any time they chose.
Steve knew they both needed help, but Bucky was not ready for therapy or counseling. It was still hard for him to speak to the members of the team about everyday things, getting him to try opening up to a stranger would most likely end badly. Steve had faith that they could get there though. Maybe they could go together at first, and Bucky could listen to Steve talk while he got used to the therapist.
“There’s no telling what the future brings,” Tony answered, feeling a bittersweet pang when he noticed Steve was gone. Good. If he could just keep Bucky busy it would give Steve time to meet Erskine, however that happened, and the man will see how great he is, and how he should be given a chance.
“Back to the point,” Natasha said, regaining Steve’s attention. “Stark’s been there for three months? What the hell has he been doing?”
That was when they arrived at the cage elevator that would take them up to their floors, and Bucky felt his breathing begin to quicken as he looked at the small space behind the bars before they were opened by the operator inside. He suspected he wasn’t the only one feeling that trapped sensation as his skin began to itch uncomfortably at the thought of stepping in. The man who worked the elevator stood, watching them expectantly, but Bucky just couldn’t seem to make himself go forward. He’d just gotten out of a cage.
“Christ, Tony! Why are you building something like that?” Steve asked, looking at Tony like he’d lost it.
Tony chuckled, “I’d rather you didn’t. I don’t think my ego could handle that, and it’s been quite a long day.” Curious, he asked, “How old are you, anyway?”
“Well, I can’t fault him there.” Tony admitted and held out his hand. When the doctor clasped his own in Tony’s to shake, he added, “Thanks Doc. You don’t know what this means to me.”
Tony wanted to reach over and grab his hand, but he couldn’t, so he just patted Bucky’s shoulder and leaned in to whisper, “I know, sweetheart, but we’ll be over the channel and back on the ground before you know it.” He leaned back and asked, “Have you been to London yet?”
Tony couldn’t help the smile that formed as he asked, “So are you going to continue the legacy and name your son after him?”
Tony’s jaw dropped. Because No. Way. This. Was. Happening. And had Steve said forever? That would mean they’d done this before.
The weird thing was that Steve could sometimes swear he saw flashes of something move across the lenses, but when he looked again, there was nothing there.
“Dum-E broke it, and chill the fuck out Barton, it’s just a coffee mug! Here, use the ‘Mojo Jojo Java’ mug.” Tony said, squinting at the coffee mug tree on the counter that was filled with novelty mugs.
It had been told about JARVIS, the tower’s handler, and how efficient he was. They were correct because soon a hologram of its arm appeared near the table.
Tony wished he could take their hands or loop his arms around theirs, but he knew that wasn’t a possibility so he just motioned with his head and began walking, knowing they would follow.
“You there,” he said as he approached Tony. Steve looked worried as he stopped his movements to watch from where he stood. “Who are you, and what are you doing here?”
Tony let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding as the tension began to leave him. A movement to his left made him turn his head.
“Everything.” Steve told him sincerely. “Everything that Hydra had to do to you proves it. If you’d lost your soul, why would they continue to wipe your memories? It’s because they knew that you were still in there and would never choose to do the things they made you do. You told me that you didn’t know why you pulled me from the river, but you did it. You had just been wiped. If you didn’t have a soul, you would have let me die. Even before then, you would have killed me on the heli-carrier when I told you to finish it.
Banner’s white coat made his skin itch, made his mind flash with thoughts of electricity and pain and syringes. Bucky hated that white coat. A lot of bad people wore white coats.
Bucky actually chuckled. “So did I. I’m sorry, but I just…I hated hearing that about you. Even if you were the one saying it.
“Anything else?” Steve pressed because now that he was focusing on remembering and not trying to block everything out, all the pieces began falling into place, one after the other in order. His head even hurt less now that he wasn’t fighting it.
As Bucky watched Tony pour the first of the batter in the pan he realized, “Tony, have you had your coffee yet?”
Men around them were shouting as they dove into the hole Bucky and the others were already defending. He could see the line of German soldiers approaching, firing as they came to force the Americans to risk being shot in their attempt to keep them back.
“I’m going to feel floaty?” Steve asked, slightly worried. How could he take care of Bucky if he was floaty too?
“I’m sorry, Tony.” Erskine said sincerely. “It’s not my business to ask, but I am sorry for whatever happened between you and Howard.”
Tony was trying to think of something to say to that when the door opened, and he did a double take at the person who entered. Across the way he watched James Buchanan Barnes walk through the door.
Steve shrugged a little. “I might, it depends. But for now I know I want Tony to take me, even if it’s just to see if I like it as much as I think I would. I do know that I will never want to change what we have.” Steve said, giving Bucky a quick kiss. “As long as you want me that way.”
“Wars cost money, Rogers.” Jacobson interrupted in exasperation. “I don’t think I need to remind you how little this country has at the moment.”
“You’re the one who keeps bringing up his legacy,” Tony reasoned. “What’s going to happen to the company when you’re gone? I know most young people think they’ll live forever, but I can promise you that is not the case.”
“Can I see?” Tony moved to catch a glimpse over the younger man’s shoulder, but Steve deftly tilted the sketchpad away from view.
“I do not know the reason behind it, only the one who created the curse would know such a thing, but he will suffer.” Thor said grimly. “I did not misspeak my words when I said he was locked and bound to you. He cannot leave, not until that which has bound him has passed.”
Tony moved to kiss his neck, his breath was hot on Bucky’s skin as he started speaking softly. “I was having the most wonderful dream, honey.” He said as he licked a stripe along the curve of Bucky’s neck. Fuck, Bucky was sensitive there. “You were in it, and you made the sexiest sounds.”
Bucky shook his head as Steve answered, “We figured a big breakfast with the team would be better. You’ve all been workin’ hard to find Tony while we adjust.”
“There’s got to be at least five mortar companies out there!” Dum yelled against his own side of the hole.
Steve felt like he’d been punched in the gut. Where were they moving him? Had he failed? He turned to quickly begin packing his few belongings into his duffle. His mind whirring with unanswered questions.
“Of course, it will,” Tony told him. “Just trust your instincts, Steve. I’m only here to help. You’re the super-soldier, and more importantly, you were chosen for a reason.”
“We love you too, honey.” Bucky reaffirmed as he wiped at the fresh tears. “And I don’t plan on dyin’ over there. One way or another, I’ll make it back to you.”
The realization didn’t fix anything. It had come far too late, and the damage had already been done to Tony’s self-worth. It was the biggest reason he had hated being compared to his father. Whatever Tony’s faults, he never wanted to be capable of what Howard had put him through.
His lover was right. Tony was mysterious and charming and handsome. He was educated and seemed to know something about everything. He’d never shown them anything but respect and kindness, and that meant more to Steve than he could ever say.
“He saved you,” Steve finished for him, “and now you live your life helping and saving other people.”
played on the radio. It was so perfectly appropriate for the moment, and Tony just smiled and raised his glass in a toast. “Merry Christmas.”
Before Steve could answer, the television on the wall across from them came to life, and as they turned to look, a familiar brown-haired figure appeared on the screen.
He could tell Bucky was not altogether happy about Steve receiving a book about war strategies. He probably believed it would only encourage Steve to keep trying to enlist, but Tony knew that Steve would do that anyway so he wanted his baby boy to be as ready as he could be. Just like he wanted Bucky to be ready.
Tony hated lying to him, again, but he had no other choice. How could he begin to explain that the x-rays and doctors had been right, only to say that he’d healed so quickly in four days. Abrams was right. It couldn’t be explained so Tony had to lie. Too much was at stake to worry about the truth now. Tony’s life had become one big example of the truth being what you made it.
They walked to the edge of the dancefloor just as another song began. Tony and Louise both started moving as Mildred Bailey’s
“They can’t all be that bad,” Tony said as they began walking to the car that would drive them back to Brooklyn.
The husband and wife both made their exits, and Tony was left alone with his boys. “I’d say we don’t need the menus tonight, right?”
“My middle name’s Buchanan.” He smirked ruefully. “There’s a lot of guys named James around here, so I’ve been called Bucky since grade school.” He looked Tony up and down, probably taking in the suit. “Appreciate your help, Mr. Stark.”
Tony got up and got dressed the next morning. He focused on every task intently, not allowing his mind to wander or his thoughts to stray because he couldn’t fucking deal with it if they did. After his realization last night that something was decidedly
Okay, so maybe Tony had talked the landlord into a reduced rate for both of them instead of just letting him live rent free for his services. Tony didn’t technically need to live rent free, and this would help her considerably.
Bucky nodded. “It was true then, and it’s true now. What should we do when we finally get him home?”
The apartment was small. And shabby. The furniture looked like it used to be someone else’s second hand stuff. Maybe older than that.  Could something be third hand? Tony looked at the sofa and mismatched armchair next to it. Maybe fourth hand?
Natasha was the one who spoke from the corner. “If what you’re seeing is real, and Stark has actually been sent into your past somehow, I don’t see how we can get him back without the person who caused this. It seems most likely that it was magic of some kind, but without Strange we can’t even confirm that.”
“Is that the reason for this?” Erskine asked him as he drove. “You won’t even come around and look busy for a few days in the upcoming months just to avoid Howard? You will have to meet him eventually, you know.” Erskine looked speculatively at him. “I’ve met with Howard a few dozen times, and while I don’t know him well, I can say that it is somewhat surprising to think of him being a father.”
He’d just about finished the hands-on part, and all there was to do now was wait when the two had finished eating.
“Now you’re just talking crazy, baby.” Tony said affectionately. As he felt the genuine smile that spread over his face, he realized how much he had missed this these past few days. With Bucky gone their banter had almost dried up completely. They were just trying to adjust to the new way their dynamic had changed with the absence of Bucky. It was like Bucky’s letter had breathed life into them. “I am the definition of a disciplinarian in the bedroom.”
And as he lay there and really thought about it, he realized that nearly every single thing Tony has done since they met him has been for Steve or Bucky himself. Tony is always working, always planning, always trying to do better by them. Bucky wonders if the reason Tony doesn’t like to deal with emotions is because he feels things too deeply, so he
