With Tony, he wasn’t sure about anything.
“Tall-”
“Then-”
“Hey Buck,” Tony sang when he turned around from the stove, the pan of eggs in his hands and a smile that made him look even younger than he already does tugging up his lips, “Breakfast?”
This was one of his favorite things to do, prep Tony and get him to wet and willing for Steve’s cock that the whole was nearly throbbing for the intrusion. He swirled his tongue, sucking a small fraction to get it all nice and swollen before he slides a finger in listening to the hiss Tony released.
He was sitting on the common room couch with knees bent, a book propped on top of his knee with a twizzler between his teeth when Tony realized he was in love with Steve.
“Steven Grant Rogers, I am stupidly telling you that I love you for the first time by asking you to marry me,”
“Its still super early so we can still mosey around mostly unnoticed by the great citizens of New York,” Tony waved his free hand, squeezing Steve’s fingers who, thankfully, squeezed back, “I believe the last time you were here wasn’t an exceptionally marvelous time. Actually, if my snooping recalls correctly, you had run all over town in a desperate act to find out where you were and somehow managed to wind up in the middle of the central park-this was the second time you escaped, am I correct?”
“Bro, showers still exist in the real world y’know,” He slipped off the chair to wedge himself between Natasha and a tight-lipped Bruce. Tony’s eyes looked empty and hollow as he watched his teammate move across the room and something inside of Steve wanted to reach over and smack Clint upside the head. This was the first time in nearly three weeks Tony had stayed longer than asking for coffee with them and Clint had to go and say that? Natasha and Bruce had the decency to look anywhere but Tony. Clint still had his face scrunched up but instead of the breakdown Steve was expecting (and ultimately preparing for) Tony had nodded, placed his cup in the sink and asked JARVIS to start up his shower.
“Can you please stop,” He shoved the shirt back down, moving as far away from the stranger as the wall would let him.
“You’ll like him, I swear, he’s awesome.” Steve kept messing with the collar of Bucky’s jacket, frowning whenever the brunette took a drag from his cigarette.
Afterward, when they were sweaty and sated, guilt was twisting Bucky’s chest tight, stealing his air, and making his head swim he asked Clint who he thought about. The dirty blond had shrugged, mumbled something he could barely hear before sending him a smirk, “Name’s Phil, so Wanna do this again sometime?”
He had leaned closer to Steve while everyone was focused on getting their gear strapped on and ready. His lips just barely brushing across the super soldier’s ear but it was enough to capture the man’s attention, “Seeing you strap yourself it makes me wonder how tight you could strap me down, Sir,” He breathed, letting his voice drop as his breath circled Steve’s ear and he prayed he hadn’t imagined the darkening of Steve’s eyes as he turned towards his boyfriend and pushed him further into the corner and pressed just a little closer to the Iron Man suit than usual.
A sharp, loud laugh sent him reeling asTony threw his head back shoulders shaking while clipped laughter escaped his chest. The twisted smile that pulled the man’s lips up wasn’t his normal full of light grin that he normally wore around Steve, it wasn’t even the predatory leer he reserved for the media known as his Stark face. It was cruel and ugly as tears slipped from his eyes, trailing down his cheeks to wiped away angrily as Tony kept shaking with laughter over and over causing Steve to tense in his spot. He had known there was the possibility of rejection to his help but this was sharp, cut right to the heart of the super soldier as his friend wiped more and more laughing tears from his eyes.
The man must not have heard him because he kept tapping idly at a holograph before him with new schematics for widows new stinging bites. One hand was twisting the wine bottle in his hand, tongue lapping at the cork with oddly disturbing assurance.
It was a picture.
Steve smiled, “Never pegged you for a breakfast man, Tony,”
“Here,” Steve reached around and grabbed Tony’s right arm to place his hand across his cheek, “I want you to hold yourself open for me, Gorgeous, can you do that for me?” Steve heard a grunt into the pillow and he laughed. His could feel his boyfriend shaking beneath him and God it had to be the most beautiful thing in the whole world to ever witness, seeing Tony come undone beneath him- he could barely think.
Steve snorted.
“Spent,” he felt a kiss press to his shoulder before Steve pulled him closer.
Tony ducked his head and Steve tucked him into his chest ignoring the wetness pooling against his chest, pressed his lips to Tony’s temple and softly thanked Sam for showing him that stupid dancing movie that gave Steve the inspiration to march his ass down to Tony’s lab and force the man to talk to him, yell at him or simply just cry.
“Oh,” Steve blinked up at him, “I, uh, wasn’t expecting you home early,”
Steve stumbles to the bed be careful not to let his lubed fingers touch anything but himself as he lays down for Tony and spreads his legs wide enough for the other man to see the whole show. Tony doesn’t say anything as he steps towards the bed, knees touching the edge before he stops and strokes himself lazily. Heat tendrils spread down Steve’s back to settle in his cock as he pressed his fingers against his hole and moaned.
Steve shrugged, “Never knew Tony Stark could obey so easily,”
“COMMON ROOM NOW!” He yells. Bruce looks up at Steve who is trying to hide his laughter and simply shrugs as they make their way into the common area and watch Tony pace back and forth in front of the wall they usually project their movies on. His suit jack had been thrown over the back of one of the love seats as he waited for the team to sit in their respective places. The only one not sitting was Steve who was still trying to not laugh until Tony had his proof.
The coffee shop was sweltering and packed full of students trying to suck some caffeine into their bloodstreams anyway they could short of straight-lining it. Steve hated coming here, hated when he forgot his favorite mug on the counter, and pinch pennies together so he can stay awake long enough to survive his last few classes of the day. For the millionth time, he wishes he’d taken the scholarship to the art school in New York. He loved art, he could spend his entire life painting or drawing if he willfully wished, but he could never lose his first love for architecture. As the line moved forwards once more he sighed remembering that this school was offering him more than he could ever imagine and having to pinch their luck a few times was worth it.
“To-Tony,” He bucks his hips into his hand, fingers flexing and unflexing beneath him.
Steve groaned, one hand carding through Tony’s hair as the other one stroked over his chin, “You’re sharp tongue was made to lick me, wasn’t it Stark?” He shoved his cock in deeper, just past Tony’s teeth so that his tongue slid all the way down the shaft and he wanted so badly to pull Steve in, swallow him whole and gag on his cock as the super soldier fuck his face.
Tony might have been smiling the whole time, a slight curve of his lips as he closed his eyes and drifted off again to the sound of Steve’s breathing beneath his ear.
“Got the eyes down-”
They hadn’t seen him for six days after that.
"Fuck, fuck man, dammit why did you run into me? Shit, dude, are you okay? Oh my God, that shirt is done for, I am so sorry, but really it was your fault, have looked, or at least noticed that I was turning around. Are you okay? Does it hurt? Come here, sit down.” He didn’t have time to process anything the brown-eyed stranger was saying before being tugged towards a rare and free table near the back of the coffee shop. The other man settled Steve down before dropping to his knees and lifting Steve’s shirt.
Steve leaned down, hand landing in a sharp smack across Tony’s ass once more before he massaged the pink flesh, pulled back and smacked hard in three rapid successions. Each one caused the most delicious sounds to fall from Tony’s lips to bleed their way into Steve’s ears and down to his cock. He could barely focus as he smack him one more time, watching him fight against a squirm and his ass getting so damn red Steve wanted to kiss it.
Tony watched the way Steve’s blue eyes lit up with realization, “Absolutely, yeah let's do it,” He agreed with a little too much enthusiasm but the billionaire wasn’t about to question his boyfriend’s sudden excitement. He needed him to be in a happy or fair mood today so that the fear of rejection wouldn’t be so fierce inside him.
“Hey man,” Clint fist bumped him, “So you’re Bucky? The way Steve talked about you, I expected someone bigger.”
“Okay, Rogers, now or never,” He murmured before knocking on the cool glass and listened for the music to be turned down but instead he was met with the same blaring Guns ‘n’ Roses noise as before. Sighing he bit his tongue let the retinal scanner identify him before punching in his key code and letting the door swish open. Stepping into the workshop felt like marching into a minefield. It was messy, Tony never really let it become too cluttered but to say it was disorganized was an understatement. Half finished projects had been pushed off into corners normally reserved for testing, hand-drawn blueprints crumpled up and tossed into the trash bins some crowding around the bins one was even stuck between a heating lamp and a prototype for the Iron Captain suit. Coffee cups were spilling over the recycle container, a few styrofoam containers laying waste on a work table Steve knew was usually used to test gauntlets. Amongst the mess with a bottle of expensive wine pressed to his lips drinking it just resting there as if the act itself was too much work, his usual artfully styled hair was an unruly mess, button-up shirt long discarded for a ragged-looking black tank top arms covered in new bruises and grease stains sat Tony himself.
“I get that,” Bucky grunted leaning into the fridge to grab two beers handing one to Steve who raised a brow but took the offered beverage anyway, “doesn’t mean I ain’t worried bout’cha,”
“Yeah, Loki’s army really did a number,” Steve again fought the urge to reach out and hold Tony’s hand.
“Yes, I want to taste your cock. I want it to slide across my tongue and have it choke me until I gag for air, God Cap, fuck my face,” He didn’t mean to let all of that spill out. He was going to stop at taste your cock but the way Steve’s eyes widened as he begged for it made it all come tumbling down.
Dammit and even Bucky had to admit the young man was dangerously attractive in a deep red button-up shirt, the buttons left loose to show off a lithe frame, dusky nipples visible one being pinched between his left forefinger and thumb, the other hand toying with the dark hair that disappeared beneath the waistband of dark jeans. He was okay, he really was, until his stupid laser eyes took stock of the number of hickeys covering the exposed olive skin.
“So where are we going,” Steve squinted against the bright sun barely noticing the car that had pulled up.
All of that just from Steve holding his hand. (You don’t even wanna know what happens when Steve gets a hold of something a little firmer.)
Steve begun to enjoy it.
‘I don’t have the best advice here, you probably don’t even want advice, but Tony I can say that nothing you are holding inside of you is your fault. None of it is, sometimes these things just happen. People fall out of love and they are forced to accept that sheer will-power alone isn’t going to make things better,” Tony caught his eyes again and a spark of something that made his heart race ignited behind those brown eyes.
Bucky could barely stand and Clint’s hands were warm against him, guiding him into the back of a cab, helping lead him up a few flights of stairs into a mess of an apartment. He barely registered a bra over the back of the couch or the impressive knife collection above the television. Clint brushed it all off with a quick, “I live with my crazy sister,” before tugging Bucky into the furthest bedroom.
“I’m retiring, I give up, being this far away from my marvelous bed and shower for so long has proven my current track of good Samaritan acts isn’t worth it,” Tony ranted as he stumbled into his and Cap’s apartment level, FRIDAY had welcomed them asking Tony if he would like for her to start the automatic shower.
Steve moved his hand from Tony’s hair to his chin, brushing his finger across his jaw and over his over grown facial hair to push against his lips and open that all- too cocky mouth, “ Leave it open, don’t suck unless I tell you too,” He starts watching as Stark’s eyes widen and dilate with lust and every bone in his body wants to just take him now but he knows he needs this.
“Fuck yourself, Tony,” Steve breathed.
Walking back out towards the common area he watched his boyfriend tap away on his Starkpad. He soaked in the image before taking in the marvel that is Tony Stark. The man was beautiful, all dark tousled hair and sculpted goatee that framed his dangerous red lips that could swoon even the toughest of critics when he smiled.
“I don’t deserve you,” He murmured into the soldier’s collarbone.
“I expected more people to be here,” Steve commented when they walked into Central Park. He never got over how much the area had changed over time. How it has grown and adapted to the world around it yet somehow managed to stay as beautiful as Steve remembered. He was rarely able to visit it back in his time, it was nearly an hour and a half away from him by car let alone by foot. The first time he had stepped foot on the bright green grass Bucky had been standing beside him, both their eyes lit up in wonder at what they were seeing. The last time he was all spangled out dancing on a stage during the war-his dignity left someone back in Brooklyn. Now he was standing in it for the fifth time with Tony, his hand aching to reach out and grab the other man’s.
The third time was actually an accident. They were in the compound’s living room, lounging on the couch for the first time in God knows when their fellow Avengers all spread out around the room doing various activities. Thor had been clicking through the channels, asking Clint what each show was until Tony couldn’t handle it anymore, “Just watch it and find out,” He had snapped causing a sharp look from his boyfriend to bite him down.
Tony’s mouth twisted up, “That’s where we see two different ways, Cap,” He leaned back again, “I didn’t understand why I stopped being in love with Pepper. I mean, have you met her?” Steve went to answer when he realized it was rhetorical, but he couldn’t help mentally assessing Ms. Potts in his mind her beautiful ginger hair, fair complex dusted with freckles that he saw Tony brush a kiss over more than once. She moved with an air about her that told the world she could carry it on her shoulders and still have time for a manicure.
Somehow Bucky had ended up with twelve beers under his belt, six shots of whiskey, and a tequila mix that Clint made both him and Sam try but refused to tell them the name of. The drunker he got, the less control he had over his jealousy when he came to Steve and Tony.
He would always do something with his hands, never once sitting or standing still, legs always bouncing, fingers always moving, and sometimes he’d have two to three screwdrivers on him at one time. The first time Steve ever saw Tony outside of the coffee shop they met or the library he was carrying a very heavy looking briefcase, a screwdriver tucked between his fingers, a coffee cup pressed to his chin with a different screwdriver tucked behind his ear. He had smiled at Steve, coffee-colored eyes flashing as he bounded towards him, already going off about this project he was working on with a lab partner named Bruce.
Tony nearly came right then and there. Watching Steve-seeing Steve- there we literally no words he could use to describe how fucking beautiful Steve was opening himself up for Tony. Golden head tossed back in ecstacy, golden chest heaving with every moan that leaves his gorgeous red mouth. Steve was a fucking god splayed out for Tony to worship, to kneel before and pray open with open mouth kisses, mark leaving bite marks and purple hickies that would disappear by morning but he could trace them with his tongue as Steve fucks himself over his fingers before Tony steps up and tells him to suck and like the good sport he is he wraps his mouth around Tony’s cock and goes to town.
Fist resting against the glass he bent his head down took a steadying breathe before lifting his fist once more only to drop it again and sigh in defeat. This time he leaned his head forward to feel the cool surface against his forehead mentally chastising himself for not being able to simply knock. Just knock that's all you have to do. Actually, he didn’t even have to knock he could have asked JARVIS to announce his presence and walk in without so much as an “Access Approved.” he’d done it countless of times before.
He didn’t even get close before the super soldier was tugging him carefully up by his hair but with just enough tug that Tony knew he meant business and wasn’t messing around. “I need to wash my hair, so I want you to dry off and wait kneeled on the bed for me,” He had pulled Tony into his muscled chest so that they breathed with each other. Tony shivered, looked up at those blue eyes and saw the command behind them. This was no game, he was serious and Jesus Tony was hard just by looking at this man’s eyes.
Licking his thumb he pressed the wetness to the awaiting hole, watching it twitch beneath his digit as Tony squirmed against his fingers. He stilled him, holding him down so he can lean over his lover’s body and press himself against his ear, his cock sliding between his open cheeks to press against the tight heat, “Mmm,” he moaned into Tony’s ear who jumped at the sudden noise, bringing his head up so that his ear came up to Cap’s mouth, “I want you to be very still, Tony, I don’t want you to move as I lick your perfect little hole, opening you up with my tongue, my fingers getting you so stretched and wet just for my cock,” He watched Tony bite back a moan, “But by all means, darling, moan so damn loud our team knows what it's like to belong to me,” with that Cap smacked hard down on Tony’s ass causing him to jump and moan out in painful pleasure before he shivered down to his perch.
Continuing his job was becoming rather difficult as he reached Steve’s hips and had to ignore how hard the other man was and God was he hard. In all of Tony’s many sexcapades, he saw some beautiful men and women splayed out before him as an offering. He touched the skin of some of the world’s most beautiful models. Pepper had been gorgeous, still is gorgeous, and he had buried himself in the depth of her beauty but none of them could rival with the architecture that is Steve Roger’s cock. It was definitely proportional to the man’s body thick, veiny and curved at just the right angle to slide against Tony’s throat in such delicious ways. If he could make a religion out of Steve’s cock he would.
He started noticing the hints after Ultron.
“A what?” Clint kept making gestures with his hand, fingers moving quicker than Bucky’s alcohol addled brain could keep up with it. It wasn’t until Clint made a movement towards his ears that Bucky realized the gestures were sign language and he got with the program.
Tony hissed, “Fuck, Steve,”
“Or the third-” Clint smirks and this time he earns a high five instead of a smack.
Clint pulled his arm back and rubbed his neck, the other waving at the doorway, “UH yeah, no, sorry she just got back and wanted to have lunch before she went back to the apartment and I might have double booked myself,”
‘Morning,” Steve didn’t step to close to Tony. He knew he smelled of a three-hour run, he might not have sweated often but when he did it left a powerful stench to rival Jersey.
“I want any and all proof of Captain Rogers hearing the words “I love you” coming from my lips,” he orders.
“Stevie,” Bucky turned his head wanting to kiss him, wanting to taste him but when he turned, it wasn’t Steve holding him it was Tony. Tony’s whose brown eyes were bright, filled with emotion and inquisitive knowledge that always made him feel uncomfortable. Tony who somehow always smelled like motor oil and coconuts rocked him back-and-forth whispering that it was all going to be okay, that he had him, he would always have him.
“Steven Samuel Rogers,"
“Peachy, Cap,” He waved a hand through the air sounding like the real Tony for about 2.5 seconds before a strange bitter chuckle escaped him. “Whats up? Is the coffee maker on the fritz? Someone need an upgrade to their weaponry again? The city being burnt down by overgrown teddy bears on a warpath?” Steve could hear the forced humor behind his friends words.
It made him smile.
Steve halted though, pulling whines from deep inside Tony that begged for him to move, “Last I checked, Stark,” He punctuated his words by thrusting deeply intp Tony, “I’m the Captain here and I give the order,” Reaching down he grabbed a handful of hair and yanked Tony up and back to match his thrusts. He cried out, body shaking against the new angle that pressed right against his prostate. Steve pounded into him, harder and harder as he bounced Tony up and down over his dick, he could feel his balls tightening beneath his lover, the wasy Tony moaned and moved over him shot sparks into his dick that ignited the world.
“Bed, now,” He had ordered. As if he were the boss of Tony.
Thirty minutes later they’re back at the mansion with Tony barreling his way past a questioning looking Clint and a surprised looking Bruce who was making his way past them with a bowl of popcorn.
“It’ll take some physical therapy, but you are already an excellent candidate and Shuri says she can have it finished with a limited need for recalibrations soon,” Stark told him that last time he went in for a fitting. They had sat in the man’s lab for what felt like hours. A younger woman Stark kept calling ‘Princess’ moving around behind him, complaining about how much better her equipment was to his.
Steve’s head went into overdrive as he picked up on the way Tony scratched at his neck, his eyes doing their darting thing when he wasn’t sure what to focus on. He hadn’t said anything for nearly ten minutes and Steve honestly cannot think of a time where Tony being silent meant something good was going to come from it.
“I need to be cleaned,” Steve said softly pulling Tony out of his own head to see his lover handing him a new wash rag with the bar of soap wrapped inside of it.
Just a press of lips, Tony’s to Steve but just that simple press made a fire rage inside of the super soldier as his body melted under Tony’s lips and the other man gratefully reached for Steve’s face and cup it between his hands, palms resting against day old stubble, before sliding back to entangle themselves in Steve’s hair. Tony licked his bottom lip a small tentative question asking if he was allowed and moan escaped Steve who opened his mouth and tasted Tony for the first time. Mind somehow committing to memory the taste of coffee, spearmint and motor oil that felt so right it made his body ache. He leaned forwards, slanting his mouth against the other man’s as his arms wound around Tony’s waist and pulled him up, balancing himself enough to brace the other man on his lap so he could hold him. He could touch him. He could feel the tears splashing against his cheeks as Tony trembled around him. Tears running freely from his closed eyes and Steve chose to kiss those away listening to the hiccuping gasps of the other man as he kissed across his eye lids, his cheeks and jaw and back up to his lips where he tried to tell Tony it was all okay.
“Hi, I’m Tony,” The shorter man stuck out his hand, the other one already occupied by a beer that Bucky was sure he shouldn’t be drinking.
“Here,” The super soldier helped clean him up, fingers playing idly at his swollen hole but much to his dismay he never entered him just cleaned around him before wiping down Tony’s chest, his lips kissing over the path the towel made. Humming his way down Tony’s stomach to his sensitive members twitching between his legs hoping to come back to life. He smiled up at the billionaire who watched him expectedly as Steve licked over the sensitive head to clean away excess cum.
Steve felt a lump rise in his throat, “Do you want to meet him?”
Something dark flashed behind Clint’s eyes, “I’m in love with someone else too and I wish us not being together was something as simple as he’s with someone else.”
“ ‘ When you walk into the room and all you smell is her perfume’ her perfume never lingered. I don’t know why, not really, but it just never settled in the sheets the way-” Tony sniffed again rubbing a hand across his face before breaking to a rueful smile eyes catching Steve’s before dropping again.
“I have to pull off, okay,” There was a hint of something in Tony’s voice that made Steve’s brow furrow. He watched the engineer pull himself up, hissing at the lost of warmth around his softening cock, and move across the workshop to a cabinet where he pulled out two towels. He wiped himself down with one, screwing his face up when he cleaned Steve off him before moving back over to Steve and handing him the extra towel. Steve cleaned himself off slowly terrified to take his eyes off of Tony who pulled his briefs back on followed by his pants but left his shirt and belt discarded across the workshop floor. He bent down and grabbed Steve’s boxers and pants before handing them to the man who arched an eyebrow but took them silently.
“Then make me make them,” Tony groans, grinding his hard cock against Steve’s stomach, aching to feel something more than the tickling tease he was giving him.
He will never deny that his mouth watered a little bit at the sight of how hard, red and wet his boyfriend was for him.
“They do this,” Steve leaned into Bucky’s ear, ‘I’ve caught them a few times when Clint’s been at the coffee shop with Tony and Bruce. It’s like they fall into a rabbit hole of who can say the weirdest thing the longest, and it usually takes drastic measures to bring them back to the surface.”
“When-” Natasha looks back at Steve who holds up his hands.
He really could.
He paid for the breakfast, asked for a couple of crepes to go (
“You’ve already met his friends?” He hadn’t meant to say that, and the guilt-stricken look that flashed across Steve’s face had him apologizing quickly. Steve had already met Tony’s friends. They had been dating seriously for the better half of four months, three weeks since Bucky picked Steve up from the library and had his entire world tipped out from beneath him. Sometimes he still couldn’t believe that Steve had managed to not only gain a boyfriend he didn’t know about but had met the man’s friends and had already slept with him (he would not think too hard about that.)
“I want to taste you,” Steve meant to think the words but when he saw the flush that graced Tony’s cheeks he was beyond happy he said them outloud. In response Tony tugged at the hem of Steve’s shirt groaning when the soldier obliged and let the engineer get his eyes on the golden peak of human perfection before him. Something dark and lustful twisted in Tony’s eyes as his left hand skimmed up Steve’s side, tracing over the well defined abs, nails lightly scratching over his sternum and tracing the edge of his left pec before Tony found his nipple and tweaked it earning an exaggerated moan from the soldier. The painful clash of teeth as he pulled Tony back into him woke up the logical part of his brain that maybe they shouldn’t be doing this kind of exploration so soon after Pepper and Tony’s revelation but then the engineer ground his hips down rubbing his erection across Steve’s and all sensibilities escaped him as he grabbed Tony by the thighs hoisted him up and practically tossed the man onto the couch, following his fall quickly covering his body with his own and attacking the man’s exposed neck.
That earns an all-out laugh from the super soldier who actually ends up doubling over on himself and holding his stomach. Tony stands back up feeling ridiculous kneeling before his boyfriend and being laughed at.
“Nonsense,” the same voice dragged his attention back to the door, “Just join us.”
“Is-is it because-” Tony went to pull away and fear ebbed its way past the pleasure. He pulled Tony closer, sliding them up so that the engineer straddled him and God did that angle feel so damn good. He could barely control the buck of his hips which earned an open mouth moan from the brown eyed love of his life as he moved his hips in sync with Steve’s thrusts.
“Steve-” Tony turned to give him a raised brow look which pulled the soldier back to the here and now and he realized he had been asked a question.
He wasn’t sure how they ended up making out on Clint’s bed, or how Clint’s shirt had come off but sometimes when he looked up at Bucky his eyes were just the right shade of blue, his lips the perfect shape and when he asked if he could blow him and Bucky had mumbled he’d never been with a guy Clint didn’t even bat an eye just smiled and said, “Pretend I’m Steve.” it almost made him sick knowing he was that fucking obvious.
“Yes Sir,” Tony had batted his eyelashes up at his boyfriend hoping to earn an eye roll and a ‘Just try to get some sleep,’ but instead he noticed the way Steve’s eyes had widened and his lips parted as he sucked in a quick breath of air. Tony knew that look, he’d seen it countless times on past lovers who were holding cuff for him to wear or barking orders for him to kneel.
Something in the back of Steve’s mind nagged at him. Told him to pay attention harder than he was because what Tony was saying had a different meaning, that there was multiple phrases coming from his words. Steve needed to read between the lines to get the answer he was searching for just remember how to decode cryptic messaging and here we go. He looked up at Tony, saw the man watching him with open eyes ghosts burning in fire behind the chocolate orbs that gave him all the clues in the world.
“I proposed to Steve,” He starts.
The look in Bucky’s eyes made Steve’s stomach hurt.
“One more, come on Buck, one more.” Steve was standing behind him, hands hovering over the dumb-bell he held in his left hand, or well his prosthetic hand. He curled it up, slowly, one more time that day before letting his friend catch it and place it back on the rack as he made his way over to the bench.
“Tony,” Steve snapped the man froze, fingers hovering mid-air before he dropped them and turned around to look up at Steve with indignation in those chocolate orbs. His jaw was set in a way that Steve wasn’t use to seeing on the genius, it made his teeth ache as bile rose in his throat.
Steve throws his head back the moment his mouth wraps around him, his fingers reaching out to tangle themselves in Tony’s hair as he sucks over his cock, tongue wrapping around the base when slides down him and licking up the nerves as he moves back up. He hollows out his cheeks, relaxes his jaw and lets Steve slide to the back of his throat where the super soldier lets out the sluttiest noise Tony has ever heard and comes quicker than expected. Tony just barely swallows it all down in time, a smirk trying to work its way over his lips as he licks over Steve’s head before lifting up.
Do not even get him started on the amount of self-control it took to keep himself from coming when he was fully sheathed inside of the engineer and moving into Tony so deep, so deep, he felt as if he took his first breath as a free man, so warm, so right so tight he had to pressed his forehead into Tony’s shoulder focusing on the pressure of Tony’s heels against his ass as he pounds into the love of his life because that was what Tony was. He had to be, This had to be some sick twisted deviation from fate pushing them together because nothing, nothing, has ever felt this incredible. Steve had loved Bucky, loved him with every inch of his being but even that paled in comparison to the quivering man beneath him begging him to “Go faster, fuck me harder, come on baby please,”
“Y-yes,” Tony gasped.
“Are you okay?” Steve waved his hand in front of Tony’s face. Things had been going fine, more than fine, they had been going really well all morning, so why was Tony acting as if he had something he needed to get off his chest. Why was he being so fidgety-
“You have no idea how fucking gorgeous you are, Baby, how hard you’re making me as you use your gorgeous mouth to suck me and you fuck yourself ready for me,” He stutters his hips when he feels the back of Steve’s throat, “Do you want me, baby?”
Because this time there would be that elephant in the room.
“Not my name.”
“Steve,” Tony started but closed his mouth only to open it again without sound.
“I love you,” He said roughly before mouthing at Steve’s erection and earning a delicious moan. He licked over the fabric savoring how wet Steve already was for him before he pulled the fabric away and down Steve’s thighs.
“Gross,” Clint murmurs which earns a sharp smack to the back of his head. Wanda and Vision are surprisingly quiet, both of them knew this was coming so there was no shock at the revelation.
Which made no sense at all.
Tony’s eyebrow rose once more this time staying near his hairline before he dropped it and wheeled back around in his chair, “Then thanks for the drop- by, Cap, but I’m pretty busy here,” He waved behind him in a parting gesture. Hands coming back up to the hologram to type in numbers Steve couldn’t follow. He stayed standing behind Tony for a few moments listening to that singer Tony always complained about but still listened to wail about about press printing lies. His stomach rolling over itself trying to decide what to do now. Did he leave? Did he stay and force Tony to acknowledge him? Nothing felt like the right thing to do in this situation. Closing his eyes he pressed his thumb and forefingers into his eyelids until he saw stars inside the darkness. His stomach lurching as his mind conjured images of the smile his friend usually wore how it melted Steve’s worries away even as he rolled his eyes at the man.
Clint and Tony fell into an easy push and pull conversation that left Bucky’s head spinning, trying to keep up with what they were talking about. Somewhere between “explosive arrows” and “painted dildos” Steve has wandered off and returned with a beer for the both of them. He kept glancing at Tony, smiling at the way the he was interacting with his friend, somehow dragging Sam into the whirlwind that was their conversation.
“It will be okay,” Steve had whispered to him.
“Cum for me baby,” He moans fist matching the haggard rhythm of his hips until Steve is tightening up around him, making it harder for him to slide in and out and God the sensation sends Tony over the edge as he cums with Steve’s name falling from his lips like a mantra and it doesn’t take long before Steve arches beneath him and covers both their chests in thick streaks of cum.
Of Tony.
He googled it once, found some very awkward photographs of young ladies tied to bed posts or even some men strapped down with their ass in the air, but he found what he was looking for. Found the article about submissive and dominant partners and the roles they play. It took some digging but he found what Tony could be and it stuck with him for months. He begun to watch his boyfriend carefully, notice the way Tony would sigh when Steve’s hand lingered over his throat or how he'd blush when Captain America and Iron Man got into a screaming match.
Tony was making eggs at their stove with one of Steve’s hoodies on, his hips moving in time to the horrendous pop song on the radio, and his hair was wet. Steve’s was too.
“Oh, he speaks,” The stranger grunted tugging at Steve’s shirt again getting it above his belly button before Steve shot backward in the chair.
and Steve nearly fell speechless at the defined pout pulling his lover’s lips and the way Tony had so willing obeyed him.
Grinning Steve sucked one before pulling off and dropping the towel onto the floor, sidled up next to his boyfriend and buried his face into the genius's neck.
Steve wipes, fucking wipes, away tears as he smiles up at Tony, “Are you serious?”
The only logical thought rushing through his mind was that Tony had cheated on Pepper with someone else, Tony who had thrown his playboy ways out the window to make things with Pepper work had fallen in love with another woman without any of them knowing. He had cheated on Pepper so Steve was obviously outraged. Only that wasn’t right and he knew it, he knew Tony had never cheated on Pepper and he was just trying to stamp down the sudden wave of jealousy that Tony could love someone else.
Steve groans around him and Tony watches beads of pre-come smear across Steve’s stomach as he adds a third finger to his hole and pumps faster into himself.
“Cum inside of me,” Steve pants out.
In a flash Steve’s eyes widen before hooding in pleasure as he bite Tony’s thump, his lips just barely brushing across his head. “Spread your legs,” He says it carefully. Steve obeys, “Good, stay like that,” He walks to their bed and grabs the lube from beneath the pillows. When he steps back in front of Steve he reaches out for his hand and slicks two of his fingers up. Steve watches him his eyes following Tony’s every move as he rubs the warming lube over Steve’s fingers before kissing his palm and smiling.
Steve sighed, “He’s eighteen, I mean I’m barely three years older than him,”
The topic they all skirted around, that they all avoided like the damn plague since the day they heard the subtle shout, heels stomping down the penthouse hallway before Tony disappeared into his shop for the next fifty-six hours only to emerge with ghosts behind his eyes asking if there was coffee. No one had attempted to pull him out of the shop, no one called Rhodey to ask him to help and no one called- well- they left it an open door for Tony to say whatever he wanted when he wanted because that was how they worked. All of them.
Speaking of sitting like this what had gotten into Steve?
“Yeah Boss,” The AI beeps in.
Brown eyes moved back, raising an eyebrow, head cocking to the side, "Didn't mean to offend."
“How do you feel?” Steve murmured into his skin.
‘You did really well today Mr. Barnes.” The physical therapist smiled up at him. Her green eyes were bright, lovely and if Bucky wanted to, he knew he could make them roll back in her head as he pounded his aggression in her.
“Silence,” Tony hold up his free hand, “Steve, we’ve-well-we’ve been through a lot and we’ve done a lot and a lot of shit has happened to us and somehow we always ended back on our feet no matter how hard we fell and we always ended up at each others side. My-my whole life I’ve only ever trusted a select number of people, Rhodey, Pepper, Happy-Jarvis-” He pauses for a second, “And you.”
The doctors kept telling him it would stop hurting; the therapist swore that eventually, he’ll become accustomed to the missing limb. That eventually, he’ll adapt to being armless (He still had a whole other arm, he wasn’t armless, stop saying that) but that it would take time and he would be okay.
Those blue eyes are blown wide, swollen lips parted as his chest rises and falls and God looking at Steve all blissed out is the single most beautiful thing in the world.
He can't-
Tony was holding everything inside of himself, holding it all back as if it didn't exist. As if it didn’t matter that the woman he loved had left him. It did matter, it matter exceptionally because Pepper had been everything and more to Tony and losing her was almost like losing a piece of the man himself and Steve finally realized how much that woman had glued this broken man before him together. Steve moved closer to Tony, not really realizing his feet were moving until Tony’s breathe could be felt against his hand as he stood before his friend. Those ghost Steve hated knowing haunted Tony sprang to life in the man’s eyes as he looked up at Steve, blinked quickly and looked down at his calloused and scarred hands.
“Clint,” An unfamiliar voice called from the back room. Bucky gave Clint a look waiting for an explanation because he knew customers couldn’t be behind the counter and Clint had promised Bucky some, uh, rather much-appreciated stress relief.
“All right,” Steve’s voice made him jump, but the blond was too busy fiddling with his phone to notice, “Sam will be here in a few minutes, we will meet Tony and Clint at the bar and-” Steve’s eyes widened looking down at his phone.
“Steve, three years, six days, ten hours and thirty eight minutes ago I realized I wasn’t in love with the most wonderful woman in the world because I was in love with someone else,” and that sent Steve stumbling backwards, his hand falling away from Tony dropping to his thigh and curling to his fist that pressed his nails in until the skin broke beneath the chipped buds. He tried to reel in the shock, tried to fight back the wave of nausea that had crept up his stomach to reside in his chest but he couldn’t stop the sudden feeling that his world had shifted beneath him. He wasn’t even sure where the feelings had come from.
That explained why he was tasting the saltiness from before, a part of him had just pushed it off to be the taste of sweat across Tony’s shoulder but nope there were tears. He was crying now in fact. Why was he crying?
“Tony,” He murmured.
The billionaire shrugged, “Never pegged myself to be dating an all American hero either but here we are,” he smirked before turning his back to Steve and waving his hand in the air, “I’ll give you time to dress before we leave,”
He probably should.
The first time Tony said it had been a joke, a slip of his tongue during a long night of fighting and trying to finish a project in his workshop that would keep him awake until the early hours of the morning when his body always decided to crash. Steve had come down the stairs, Clint, Bruce, and Nat moving out of his way as he lumbered into Tony’s workshop with that damned eyebrow raised and his lips pouted.
Clint knew Bucky would never leave, ever, not without Steve at his side to ride off into the sunset with.
“You’re practically shaking for it,” Steve smiles down at him, “Licking your lips wanting to taste me, huh?” Their eyes meet and Tony has the decency to blush because yeah he fucking wants to swallow the Captain whole.
He’d have Tony back.
“Never really knew Captain America had a commanding top side to him,” Tony laughed.
He should.
“Not even the second,” Natasha helpfully adds.
Feeling a little too floaty Tony climbed into the middle of the bed, dropped down to his chest and buried his face into the down pillows paying attention to every movement of Steve behind him. The way Steve’s hand slid up his calf, over his thigh to settle at hip and dig into the skin as if just the sheer sight of Tony bent over and willing was enough for him.
“I don’t like repeating myself, Tony,” He breathed into his ear.
“I told myself over and over again that Pepper was the love of my life. That everything was better simply because she was in in my life and for a while that was true but it didn’t stay that way. After a while Pepper stopped being what made it all better and just started being what made it all easier,” There was a flippant air to Tony’s words as he leaned back in his chair and watched Steve with ghosted eyes, “I’m not sure when it happened but at some point this burning love I had for her had dwindled down to this warming sensation in the back of my chest, like, I always knew that I would love her but I didn’t know if I was in love with her,” The finality in Tony’s made Steve shiver. This caught the other man’s attention and he leaned forward to rest his elbows on his knees, “I hate myself,” he tapped his fingers against his left wrist and Steve ached to feel the pressure of those fingers around his own wrist again.
“GAH!” Tony waved his hand over the screen again and pointed the same hand he had used in the recording at Steve, ‘All of these off-hand comment barely even count. I think If I had actually looked at you and said the words, “I love you,” I would have remembered or-” He paused and noticed that Steve’s serious face was in place. He fucked up somehow. Maybe this “I need proof” thing trailed from funny on Steve’s end to now maybe Steve is questioning their whole relationship. Maybe Tony took this all a little too far and he should be remembering telling Steve all those times he said the word love to him, but he couldn’t, he honestly couldn’t remember a single time he-
“I don’t know him. Punk. The first guy you’ve shown interest in since ya told me and I barely know the guy,” The brunette dropped his gaze, “Could have at least told me.”
“Sorry what?” Tony furrowed his brow, “I asked if you were okay that after breakfast we took a walk through Central Park?”
Tony moaned around Steve, his own cock twitching with anticipation as the super soldier starts to thrust into Tony’s mouth and repeatedly hit the back of his throat. Over and over again until Tony knew talking or swallowing would hurt and his stomach tightened as he gagged around Steve’s dick and took every single fucking inch like the damn over achiever he was. His nose repeatedly hit the course blonde hair behind the base of Steve’s dick and Tony could barely breathe in the scent before he pounded into him hard and fast his hand tightening in Tony’s hair,
Sometimes Tony needed an escape, he needed to feel like he could let go and hide until the world couldn’t find him, but finding that escape wasn’t easy. The only time he came close was when Steve had him wrapped in his arms, lips pressing sweet nothings into his ear as his hands traced over his bruises and scars. Being just a little too soft.
That he did.
It made him want to fuck Tony into the couch.
“You want to get lunch before I drop you off at the range?” They were making their way towards Steve's car (New car because only the best for the boyfriend of Tony Stark) Steve carrying Bucky’s bag because he hated wearing the arm after therapy.
“Say it,”
“You’re ass is so beautiful,” Steve mused and he was telling the truth. Tony was a sight to behold and none should forget that. He was all olive skin, taut muscles and bright pink holes just begging to be tasted.
“Never mind, I don’t want to hear you say it, so I’m going to say it. I love you too,” He watched Tony whip his head towards him so quickly he swore they’d be in the medbay for whiplash later tonight. Those damned brown eyes opened so wide he could see the wheels turning in Tony’s mind trying to come up with a reaction, a response, some kind of retort that would glue this all together and make it make sense to him. Steve pressed his palm into Tony’s shoulder and forced the man to look at him, “It’ll be okay, Tony,”
Was that normal?
He hadn’t said a word since they climbed into the truck, his jaw twitching as Steve rambled on about Tony trying to make him understand that this wasn’t just some, some guy he barely knew. That Tony was something special to him, Tony made him feel wanted, Tony, made him feel appreciated, Tony never made him feel like he wasn’t good enough or that he was a shadow.
Steve and Tony had disappeared a few hours later.
His chest heaved with the weight of his indecisiveness feeling the heft rolling across his shoulders, down his back to settle in his stomach. He had strolled down here casually with his hands in his pocket, extra shading pencil tucked behind his ear and the reminder that he had done this numerous of time since he moved into the Tower. Nothing about this was new territory nor was it any strange occurrence for him to walk into Tony’s shop, Tony’s living room and even a time or two his bedroom and sit on the couch, chair or even once a discarded stool pick up one of the many sketchbooks he left in those spaces and just draw as Tony worked away. Sometimes they would talk, sometimes they would sit in complete silence letting the music fill in the space that neither of them knew what to do with. That had become their friendship. It had become expected.
“Come on,” In a brave act Tony reached out and grabbed Steve’s hand, earning a gasp to fall from the blue-eyed man’s lips eyes wide but he ignored the thumping fear in his chest that Steve would rip his hand away and pulled him along.
Did he fuck this up THAT badly?
“You’re so damn tight, “ Steve murmured circling his finger around his hole, his eyes scanning for the lube he had tucked beneath the pillow. He clicked the bottle open squeezing the cold liquid onto his fingers before slipping a second on in and not even hesitating to scissor the billionaire open and pull that fucking gorgeous sound out of him, “You’re so wanting, Baby, so needy for my fingers you want to rock back and fuck yourself against them, don’t you?”
Remembering him going through that wormhole made Steve want to collapse in on himself, they hadn’t been together then, they had only just met nearly months previously but Steve had been drawn to Tony from their first argument. It nearly killed him seeing him- He had to stop.
Tony patted him on the shoulder before entangling his fingers with Steve’s and tugging him towards the karaoke stage. The younger man pushed Steve into a chair leaning over to press their lips together quickly (Bucky might have chugged his beer a, a tad too aggressively during that) before winking his way and stumbling onto the stage where he serenaded the blond with a, surprisingly, not bad, rendition of Pour Some Sugar On Me. Bucky hated every God damn second of it, slamming back beer after beer every time Tony would kiss Steve, touch Steve, climb back onto the stage and sing to Steve.
He pressed his lips together waiting for Tony to continue, “She’s perfect in every sense of the word. She saved me when I didn’t even care to be saved and she kept saving me, Cap, she kept pulling up from the depth as I clung to the last gulp of air I had left. She was my life preserver for so long that I couldn’t keep myself from loving her,” He pressed the heels of his hands into his eyes and Steve watched his shoulders shake with silent tears. Without thinking the soldier leaned forward and touched Tony’s knee causing the man to jerk upright and look into Steve’s eyes.
Both their shirts had managed to disappear and do not even get them started on how they took their pants off without breaking their kiss. Tongues fighting over each other, teeth clashing just enough for it strike match in both of them. Tony pulled them down onto the couch, hovering over Steve as he took this time to explore his neck, biting hard enough to leave a mark that would be gone in seconds but that sound never would. God the sounds Steve makes as Tony works his way down his body kissing, biting and sucking all expanses of his golden flesh until he caught the hem of his briefs could put the grand orchestra to shame.
“I don’t know why I was crying,” Steve was breathless because Tony had tightened around him, “Please do that again,” Steve groaned. Tony obliged grounding his hips down and tightening once more around Steve’s cock. Steve hissed at the pressure and bucked his hips up harder than he meant causing Tony to go slack jawed and unfocused, those calloused working hands grasping desperately at Steve’s shoulders.
The first night he had the arm all to himself, the first night that Tony assured him he could leave it on or take it off at his desire because it wouldn’t chafe, he swore, Bucky had the worst dream of his life.
“God,” Steve groans.
Tony nearly growls in frustration as he hastily ignores his team and stares at his boyfriend- fiance, he hadn't’ said yes just said “I have proof” and grabbed Tony’s hand- who smiled at him with humor and a little adoration.
They kissed in front of the whole team who all sat still for a moment until Tony’s hand started to move and they dispersed from the room quicker than you could say “Avengers Assemble.” Tony and Steve never broke apart not when they stumbled past the couches, not when they hit the elevator wall and certainly not when FRIDAY dinged them to their apartment and they just barely made it to their couch.
It took Steve a while to learn that Tony liked things rough, at least a lot rougher than Steve was used to, that Tony liked to have control over Steve. That he liked to show that he is the cocky genius billionaire who knows not what the word “Stop” means, but there was another side to Tony. Aside from that usually comes out as a snide joke or a drop of his eyes when Captain America has to give a command.
Tony groaned which earned him a sharp smack across the ass, “Answer me.”
“Seventy five degrees, boss,” The replacement for JARVIS speaks out around him and Tony shudders at the sudden reminder that his beloved AI is now, well not really, a purpled man who knows far too much for his own good.
Steve pulls back, “I love the sounds you make,” He breathes into Tony’s ear. He groans again pushing back against the thumb at his entrance wanting to feel the burn of it entering him with no assistance. He needs the pain, needs to suddenly lash out of his own mind where he can do nothing but feel, feel and feel and God does Cap know how to make him feel.
Bucky rolled his eyes, “We’re meeting at a karaoke bar, I don’t think I will like anybody,” He watched Steve closely took in the twitch to the blond’s eye as he straightened out his (new) tight blue button-up. When Steve turned his head to look at the clock Bucky felt his stomach twist painfully at the red mark just peeking out from under the collar of his shirt. Jealousy burned through him, cinching his heart until he felt bile burn his throat at the thought of that other man being able to touch Steve in ways Bucky could only imagine.
“No, ungh, no baby I’m so close, but, but Steve you’re crying,”
He was beautiful.
Steve halted, his hips jerky as Tony milked him dry and kept tight around him as he worked through his orgasm. Tony knew not to expect Steve to go soft, perks of the serum was ridiculous rebound time, but he was always amazed at just how hard his boyfriend could stay until he was well spent. It made for some interesting late night discoveries. “Woah,” Steve breathed finally pulling himself from Tony’s mouth and helping him stand up.
Tony had come to realize very early on in his life that his patience level was rather, well, nonexistent. If he had to wait for it to be made he figures he can make it himself, if he has to wait for it to be delivered, hell he owns a plane he’s on his way, but there is absolutely nothing he can do to make Steve eat any faster. He watches him close his eyes around a blue drizzle crepe with so much powdered sugar on it it might as well be a walking diabetic commercial. His tongue darts out to lick away the extra drizzle and Tony’s head goes a little dizzy because if Steve is going to be licking away anything it should be-
He held up a hand quickly, bottom lip pulled between his teeth before he released it, “I’m crying to you, Cap, let me bawl,” a deep breath, “I didn’t cheat on Pepper, at least not the way you’re probably thinking. I didn’t sleep with anyone else, I didn’t take up take with anyone in any romantic sense, but I did let someone else into the part of me that should have only belonged to her. I didn’t realize it at first, again I didn’t realize any of this for a long time, until that morning. I showered, I changed, I came down for breakfast and through it all this sudden realization rumbled its way through my mind pulling me in and out of this dizzy dream state because this felt real. I kept saying it over and over in my head, “Why do you think this” but everytime I asked myself the answers kept presenting themselves over and over throughout the day, throughout the week over the course of three years my mind kept showing me the answer until I couldn’t hide it anymore. Until Pepper couldn’t ignore it anymore,”
They both fall into each other, breathing heavy and thick and it takes all of Tony’s power to pull out of Steve who whimpers at the loss but sighs when Tony takes him in his arms and kisses him repeating how incredible and beautiful he is with each press of his lips. Fingers carding through short blonde hair before tracing over closed eyelids and satisfied smiles. Tony can’t stop showing Steve that he loves, the dam has been broken and he isn’t sure he wants to patch it back up. Those three words fall from him far too easily now. A stream of "I love yous" followed by a reminder of how wonderful, beautiful, miraculous Steve is and how Tony is the single luckiest man in the world.
“Damn baby,” He breathes over Steve’s cock who moans and shifts beneath him “God you’re so fucking hard,” He grabs him, drinking in the mewls that Steve’s lets out as Tony’s works his fist over him.
“Hey.” A tap on his shoulder had him turning around to see Tony grinning up at him, “Mind if I borrow your bestie? You can keep mine.”
“You’re one of the best candidates we have.” She had told him, patting him on the shoulder before nudging Stark’s elbow, “If it weren’t for Stark pushing his father to open the company to medical equipment-” she trailed off at the look on Tony’s face turning her smile back on Bucky.
“Be nice,” The order came so easily to Cap and without hesitation, Tony answered with a deep,
He turned to look up at Steve that smiled lighting up his face, “Yeah,” Steve smiled back and they left the mansion hand in hand.
“Naw,” He looked past the car hoping his mask held, “Not hungry.” Liar he was starving but anytime Steve brushed against him he’d flashback to his dream and it made him sick.
‘Yes boss,” FRIDAY replies and something in Tony wants to scream for her not to call him that. For her to ignore his every command because he doesn’t deserve to be treated like he is worth something. He can’t even create his own shield to protect the world, to protect his friends and their loved ones without nearly tearing everything to pieces. He nearly lost Pepper to a crazed man with a grudge and now he can barely keep himself together long enough to kneel on the damn bed.
‘I’m going to fuck you know, okay baby? I want your mouth open as I slam my cock into it over and over until I’m spilling down your throat,”
“Tony did-”
Sam long since occupied with a brunette with legs for days and boobs that even made Bucky forget Steve for a moment.
Which is why this time made no sense to him.
Tony groans, “Yes,”
He backed up from Tony, “Look if you need to say something just-”
“Steve,” He pulled back for a moment but saw the look of panic across the other man’s face and shivered giving in to the urge and tugging his arms back enough to pull his shirt off and haphazardly discard it.
“You want me to suck you, baby? You want my mouth around your cock showing how much I fucking love you,” Steve shoots a look down at him that earns a squeeze.
He couldn’t handle that Steve’s boyfriend, the man who took the one best thing in his life away from him, the man who made Steve leave Bucky behind, built him the most beautiful arm in the world. Had spent nearly an entire year creating a masterpiece, fabricating this work of art that Bucky would sometimes look at and cry over the fact that he practically had his arm back.
He nodded, “I’ve been trying,” She smiled checking his blood pressure, doing the regular muscle control tests before declaring he was ready and she would see him on Friday. Steve grinned at him the whole damn time, smiling away as if Bucky was his child and he was a proud parent who was just shown their gold star.
Tony nearly loses his motion, “Baby,”
“I’m going to take that as a strong maybe,” He said a little too soft but that might have been because he couldn’t breathe. When Steve touched him it sometimes felt as if his whole existence had been pulled apart at the seams and he was floating around on this haze cloud looking down at his life. He was dizzy but focused all at once and his heart sometimes stuttered before stopping and restarting with a nearly audible thu-bump.
He added more to it the second time only days later, hoping to play at what he knew Cap wanted but he would never ask Tony for it. Steve was a man of honor and respect and Tony knew it would take some persuasion to get his loving, old-timey boyfriend to admit to what he wanted. Tony had to let him know he was comfortable, settled and needing for Cap to take him by the throat and tell him to kneel like a good boy. He had to let Steve know he wanted and needed this just as much as the super soldier did. So when they were flying across the country towards an island where a man with radioactive spiders was trying to take over the native lands, Tony had pushed his buttons just a little bit.
