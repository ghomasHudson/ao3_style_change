“Or maybe…”  Cresh pauses, seeming to be deep in thought.  “Maybe I should just kill you now.  I think that’s what I’ll do.”  He lifts the knife away from my face, that horrible grin stretching from ear to ear.  “Any last words, Winchester?”
Soft spot?  What does he mean by that?  I mean, I care a lot about Cas and want to make sure he stays safe—I made a promise to myself and to his little brother—but I can’t figure out if Bobby’s words are a compliment or a snide remark.
“Rest,” Dean told him. “I sent Sam out to get medicine and stuff for soup, but you and me? We’re gonna take it easy. Watch some movies, maybe catch up on our shows. The next few days are gonna be lazy and completely stress-free so you can get better as soon as possible. How does that sound?”
For a moment, when Cas stayed silent, Dean was terrified to turn back and meet Cas’ eyes. What if he didn’t like the idea? What if he didn’t want to live in a real house with Dean? What if he thought the whole thing was stupid, and now Dean had ruined everything, and—
A pair of Peacekeepers are there to guide us off the stage while the rest of them corral the wild crowd.  They’re still throwing streamers and other various party items.  With our new keys in hand, we’re told to head to the Victors’ Village and start to get settled in, which is a phrase that both excites me and makes me incredibly nervous.  The requirements are out of the way.  We’re home.  We had the homecoming ceremony.  Now comes the part that I’ve been dreading the most.
I’m still seething on the floor by the time Rowena knocks on my door to let me know dinner is ready, and thankfully, she doesn’t pressure me when I don’t answer.  I can’t go out there.  Not right now, not like this.  I might erupt again, and I’m already embarrassed enough about the first one.  Better if I just stay in here and cool down.
I’ve seen him around the fields, I think, but I’ve never spoken to him, nor have I ever heard him talk.  He mostly just keeps to himself, doing his job and then going home without uttering a single word to any of his fellow workers all day.  I wonder why.  He seems like a nice person.
Cas pokes his head out of the bathroom at the sound of Bobby’s voice.  He exchanges a glance with me—a rather apprehensive one—and joins us in the main room, all freshened up and ready to go.  “Nervous,”  he breathes, wringing his hands together.
Hey guys! I'm leaving for a vacation tomorrow, so unfortunately, the next update won't be until July 11. I know, bad timing, what with things kicking off and getting dramatic, but 10 days to wait isn't too bad, right?
I kick over the nightstand.  I hate the Capitol for tearing my family apart.  I hate the Capitol for killing Cas’ brother and then forcing him into the same situation six years later.  I hate the Capitol for thinking murder is okay, and I hate them for the fact that I might never see the people I love ever again.
So I preordered The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes back in January and it got here yesterday and holy moly it's so good so far.  I'm only like 6 chapters in, but I'm absolutely LOVING it.  Have any of y'all gotten it yet?  10/10 would recommend :)
While Dean appreciated Cas’ concern for him, he didn’t care about the risks. He twisted his head so Cas’ lips connected with his mouth instead of his cheek and kissed him like he meant it; whatever apprehension Cas may have had about the initial contact instantly vanished when Dean’s tongue gently licked at his bottom lip.
Drawing an unsteady breath, she lets me go and tries her hardest to put on an encouraging smile.  “Well, at least they’re allowing two victors if they’re both from the same district now, right?”
“Just when I thought I couldn’t feel any worse,” Cas grumbled as he rubbed the sleepiness out of his eyes and attempted to push himself upright. A cough rumbled through his throat as he did, but it didn’t sound nearly as bad as it had during the night. That was a positive, at least.
A small surge of relief courses through me when Cas nods his head, his shoulders heaving with a sigh.  “Me too.”
As I expected, Charlie heaves a sigh.  “A lot of them are worried about the reaping tomorrow, so they stayed home to spend time with their families,”  she says.  “I’m kind of surprised you didn’t.”
It was a gorgeous day outside, far warmer than it had been the past few days. It was a little uncharacteristic for November in the Midwest, but Dean wasn’t complaining, especially when he bundled Cas up in a hoodie and took him out for a long walk in the nature around the bunker. The crisp, fresh air, the weakening warmth of the sun, the light exercise. It was all a recipe for a lovely morning.
I plunge to my knees at the edge of the gurgling stream.  I scrub the blood off my right hand, scoop a handful of cold water and rinse the blood from my neck, my face, my nose and mouth.  My nose has stopped bleeding, thankfully, so my mouth is free of that metallic tang, but the cuts from the knife still ooze.  It’s as good as I’m going to get.
By the time the week was up, Cas didn’t feel sick anymore. He was tired and worn out from battling his illness, sure, but his fever was gone. His body no longer ached. He wasn’t kept awake at night with unpleasant coughing fits. He was on the road to recovery. He couldn’t have been happier, and he couldn’t have been more grateful for Dean for sticking with him throughout the whole ordeal.
Sam nodded his understanding, his brows knitted together in commiseration. “You should get back to him, just in case,” he said. “I’m sure he still feels awful. I wouldn’t want him to wake up and worry about where you went.”
After making a quick stop in his room to shoot Sam a text about the flavor packets and Gatorade, Dean, drinks in hand, made his way toward the Cave. Originally it had, needless to say, been called the Dean Cave, but Cas spent just about as much time in there as Dean and had suggested calling it something more neutral. Dean had been reluctant to do so at first—that room had been his safe space during difficult times—but as time went on and he came to realize that he didn’t so much need a designated safe space anymore, he grew to like the different name. So the Cave it became.
Another balmy breeze blows over the land.  I draw a deep breath in a desperate attempt to rid myself of those terrifying thoughts.  I’ve survived the reapings for four years now, even with taking tesserae, but it’s impossible to predict the future.  You never know whose name they’re going to pull out of those glass balls.
I faintly hear our escort welcoming the crowd and their cheers in response as I rub my eyes, desperately hoping my skin isn’t too blotchy from all the tears I shed.  Cas, as always, looks great, even with his puffy eyes, but if how hot and swollen my face feels is anything to go on, I’m sure I look like a speckled tomato.  Crowley and my prep team would probably have a cow if they saw how I looked right before a big ceremony like this.  Then Rowena’s introducing us, singing praises about us and how we’re her favorite pair of tributes in the history of the Games, and we have no choice but to take the stage with her and the mayor.
“Still sleeping, I hope,” Dean said, vaguely gesturing in the direction of his room. “I just needed to get out and cool off for a minute. He’s burning up again.”
Rowena is already waiting for us behind the Justice Building, along with the mayor.  He swiftly shakes our hands, congratulates us on our victory, thanks us for bringing pride and hope to District 9 for the first time in years.  I’m not sure how to respond to a compliment like that—and the stunned look on Cas’ face tells me he doesn’t, either—but thankfully, we don’t have to.  Rowena is gushing about how excited she is to start the ceremony, and she doesn’t waste a single second in doing so.  She’s toddling up onto the stage in front of the building before I can even fully process what the mayor said.
Bobby was right.  The ceremony doesn’t last long, but it’s more special than I could’ve even imagined.  After Rowena finishes introducing us and saying how blessed she was to be our escorts, she hands the microphone over to the mayor.  When she brushes past us to leave the stage, she wraps us in a tight hug.  She makes no effort to dry her eyes as she totters down the steps and out of sight.
“Thank you for everything, Dean,” Cas made sure to add. “I know I would’ve been much, much worse without your generosity.”
His venomous laugh chills me to my very core.  He’s going to kill me.  And he’s going to do it slowly.
Then, just like before I left, an impulse strikes me, resonates deep in my gut.  It’s so overpowering that I can’t let it go.  I don’t know what it means.  I don’t know what I’m feeling.  I’m scared and tentative and unsure of where it’s taking me, but I have to trust it, because it’s making me lean back in.  Somewhere, in the depths of my subconscious, I know it must be right.
I try not to think too much about it.  It makes me sick every year.  How can those people in the Capitol stand to let children die like that, let alone
I exchange a glance with Cas.  Why not?  She seems beyond thrilled to tell us her thoughts.  Why not indulge her a little?
I scoop him up into my arms when he leaps at me, and this time, I don’t try to hide my elation.  I drop to my knees as Sam flings his arms around my neck and buries his face in my shoulder.  I hold him so tightly, so desperately, and he holds me tighter.  He’s trembling in my grasp; it doesn’t take long for the tears to start rolling down my cheeks.
My own terrified cry echoes in the air when he grabs my shoulders and flings me off my feet and to the ground.  Again, I try to scramble away, but he catches me, lifts up my trembling body, rams my head against the corner of a trunk.  Black spots start to dance in the corners of my vision.  A horrible blend of blood and saliva dribbles out of my mouth as I try to stand, try to rise to my feet, but nothing is working.  Nothing feels right.  It’s difficult to move my arms, my legs.  I can’t think properly.  Everything is a foggy mess.
Cas hasn’t forgotten a single thing from the edible plants and insects station.  My knowledge is improving, slowly but surely.  The two of us manage to start a fire from scratch in half the time it took us yesterday.  Our snares and knot-tying skills are coming along, too, as well as our subpar camouflage abilities.  We briefly visit the shelter-making station to gather a few tips and tricks, and then we’re ready to tackle the weapon stations.
Charlie falls silent, her usual cheery expression vanishing without a trace.  “How many times?”  she finally asks, her voice so soft it’s nearly carried away by the summery breeze.
I can hear Cas saying my name, can hear Bobby letting go of another sigh, but I don’t stop.  I need to be alone.  I storm into my room and slam the door shut so forcefully that it rattles my bones, and even that isn’t enough to appease my blinding indignation.
Ripping Cas from his thoughts, Dean patted Cas’ hand. “What do you say we go check on him?” he offered. “Then we can look online for some houses for sale. If you want, anyway.”
“I think that sounds lovely,” Cas said, his tone softer than Dean had ever heard it, and when Dean swung his head to look at him, he was met with an expression so full of warmth and love and endearment that it made Dean wonder why he was ever anxious in the first place.
My blood chills to ice.  I can’t move, can’t breathe, but I don’t even need to see the owner of the knife to know who that cold voice belongs to.
Seriously.  All the insane amounts of amazing comments, kudos, bookmarks, and subscriptions have absolutely blown me away.  They made me smile so much!  Especially the incredible comments.  God, the comments.  Reading your comments and your thoughts meant the world to me and more.  Y'all really made my weeks ten times better, ya know that?  I'm so so happy that you enjoyed this story as much as I enjoyed writing it.  You're the best and I love and appreciate you more than words can describe <3
Waiting for me when Gabriel eventually lets me go is Cas’ mother.  There’s a smile on her tear-stained face, composed of happiness and anguish and appreciation and so many other emotions that are too mixed together to discern.  Her shaking hands cup my face, and for a while, she just looks at me, her lips quivering as more tears stream down her cheeks, and I look back.  She doesn’t need to say anything, either.  Seeing their family reunited again is more than I could have ever asked for.
I feel Cas freeze when our lips meet, but it doesn’t take him long to relax, melt into my hand, melt into the kiss that’s making sparks dance over my skin.  He reaches up to drape his fingers over my wrist, rub his thumb along the back of my hand.  My pain doesn’t exist.  I only notice his gentle touch, the electrifying warmth of his lips pressed against my own.
Now, Dean was well aware of how much he’d made fun of people who watched their lovers sleep in the past, because it was just plain creepy, but as he looked down at Cas and gently, carefully ran his fingers through Cas’ dark, damp hair, he just couldn’t help himself. Cas truly was beautiful, the most beautiful person Dean had ever had the pleasure of calling his. Even with the drool stain on his cheek, and his sweaty hair, and his blotchy face from all the tears he’d shed, Dean couldn’t think of a single person in the world who was more beautiful than the angel he’d fallen in love with.
I drop the switchblade, hear it clatter to the ground as I stumble backwards, off the motionless body of the boy I just murdered.  The breaths come in hysterical gasps.  Tears pour out of my eyes.  Bile rises in my constricted throat; I try to swallow it down.  I can’t breathe.  Can’t think.  Can’t believe what just happened, what I’ve just done.
Curiosity gets the better of me.  I pick it up, gaze down at the photos tucked inside, just like mine.  There’s a picture of his parents, wearing the same faint smiles as my parents in my locket.  Then there’s a picture of little Gabriel, and of someone I don’t know.  My heart pangs when I realize it must be his older brother Michael, the one who didn’t survive his Games six years ago.
The thought hits me before I have a chance to plan it out.  I grab the hilt of the blade keeping my hand on the ground and pull on it.  Another wave of intolerable agony shoots through me, messes up my vision, makes a pained scream rise out of my burning chest as the knife slides past skin and bone and muscle and finally out into the open.  There’s a ghastly hole in my hand that I try my best to ignore, because I see the other District 1 boy now, and he sees me.
“Do I need to make myself look like Will Turner to win your affection?” Dean teased, grinning wickedly over his coffee mug. He took it as a win that he didn’t get nearly as upset by Cas’ comment as he did before. Partly because he’d been half-expecting it this time, and partly because it was simply just the truth.
Dean grabbed Cas’ wrist before the latter could pick up the DayQuil again, unable to hide his amusement at Cas’ fierce loathing for the bright orange medicine. “It doesn’t work instantaneously, baby,” Dean laughed. When Cas met his eyes, his own swimming with a poignant mix of dislike and despondency, Dean moved his hand from Cas’ wrist to interlock their fingers. “You’ve just gotta give it twenty minutes or so to kick in. Then you’ll start feeling better. Promise. And if you don’t, then I’ll go back out and get you something different. Okay?”
“‘Course.” Drawing back, Dean shimmied his way to the edge of the bed, peeled the blankets off him, and shoved his feet into a pair of embarrassing but also very endearing white bunny slippers that Cas had bought for him a few months back. Dean never would have worn them normally—the ears were comically large and floppy, and the eyes looked like something out of a bad anime—but they were a gift from his favorite person in the world. Who was he to turn down something that had made Cas so happy when he’d found them in the store?
marathon. They watched all of the movies back to back, with a good deal of bathroom and snack breaks scattered throughout. Cas didn’t eat much, still slightly nauseated by his fever, but he made sure to drink plenty of water, flavored by the tasty flavor packets, and a bottle of Gatorade. And he wasn’t one to say no when Dean offered to make tomato soup and grilled cheese for dinner. Dean always brought him snacks when he wanted them. Dean always made sure to bring him a fresh glass of water when he noticed Cas was running out. Dean always kept an eye on the clock so he knew when Cas could take another dose of medicine. Cas was being spoiled rotten, treated like a king, and he was so overwhelmed with gratitude and the intensity of being sick that he couldn’t help but shed a few tears when Dean presented him with the most delectable-looking bowl of tomato soup he’d ever seen.
“What time is it?” Dean asked as made his way further into the room. Amidst how overheated he felt, the grogginess steeping in his drowsy body was immense. It was either six in the morning, or it was noon. He couldn’t tell.
Another deep, trembling breath filled Dean’s lungs. “What I’m trying to say is: maybe some day, if you want, we could move out, find someplace with a lot of open space and sunshine. Like a ranch in the country, or something like that.”
That pleased, smug smirk still plastered on Sam’s face, the younger Winchester moved to pluck the hastily-written grocery list from beneath a magnet on the fridge. “I’ll be back in a bit,” he said. “Is there anything else you want me to pick up while I’m out?”
Dean was heaving a sigh before he could stop himself. “Really, Sam?” he complained. “You couldn’t have put on a pot of coffee for the late sleepers?”
As fast and sudden as lightning, Cresh stabs the knife into the ground just to the side of my head.  He hadn’t meant to go for the kill, but I still jerk away, a yelp escaping my mouth and a rush of paralyzing adrenaline flooding through my veins.  I’m faintly aware of his amused laughter as I realize I’m not dead yet.
“Got it,” Sam said with a salute, heading for the doorway. “All right, I’m out. If you think of anything else, just text me.”
If Cas got any more adorably grumpy, Dean would’ve melted into a puddle right on the spot. “I know you feel terrible, sweetheart. I’m sorry,” he soothed, stepping forward to plant a kiss on the side of Cas’ head and pull the former angel into his arms; despite his irritability, Cas immediately latched onto Dean and pressed his lips to his shoulder. “You just look so cute. I promise I wasn’t making fun of you. I’ve had my fair share of flu seasons over the years, so I know how you feel. Nothing to laugh about.”
“That’s for ignoring me,”  he says.  When he lowers his punch and slugs me in the gut, my knees almost give out from underneath me.  “And that was just for fun.”
Every twenty-five years, there’s a special kind of Hunger Games called a Quarter Quell.  This year is the hundredth anniversary of the Hunger Games, meaning it’s the fourth Quarter Quell.  Each Quarter Quell is separated from the rest of the regular years by a different rule or method of reaping or arena in general.  In the past, twice as many tributes have been reaped from each district, or the people in the districts voted on who to send to the arena.
I’m not sure why, but I’m not nearly as unnerved about stepping foot in the training gymnasium as I was yesterday.  Maybe it’s because Cas and I have a detailed plan for the day.  Maybe it’s because the initial meeting of the other tributes is done and over with.  Maybe it’s because I’ve unintentionally branded myself as a feisty bruiser from my fight with the District 1 boy, and now everyone who isn’t a Career is looking at me with a strange mix of admiration and unbridled fear.  Whatever the reason for my burst of confidence, I’m not complaining.
“Ready,” Dean echoed without delay, bringing the mug of coffee up to his lips and gently blowing on it to cool it off. Meanwhile, Cas picked up the remote, spared a fond glance at Dean—he really was beyond grateful to have Dean taking care of him so benevolently during his first human sickness—and pressed play.
If it weren’t for Cas’ soft, breathy chuckle, I would probably be standing there with my eyes closed for hours, just listening to those familiar sounds that I missed so dearly.  I look over and see his delighted face, his borderline disbelieving expression, and when his gaze locks with mine, I notice his eyes are glistening with tears.  Happy tears.  And I know they’re happy tears because if there weren’t cameras trained on us, I would be kissing the ground and hugging him and laughing and crying because we’re
“Thank you for taking care of me,” Cas went on, already shifting to snuggle closer to Dean so they could return their attention to the movie.
“Well, I was thinking,” he began unsurely, glancing up at the clear azure sky. “I know fresh air and sunlight are really important to staying healthy. Vitamin D and stuff. And living underground, it’s hard to get that.” A faint chuckle slipped past Dean’s lips as another thought crossed his mind. “You know, it’s probably a miracle we’re not sick all the time. We spend so much time cooped up down there. It’s crazy.”
movie was nothing short of bliss, the added bonus being that the DayQuil did indeed start to make Cas feel better after about twenty minutes. He didn’t feel perfect, but it was ten times better than what he felt like when he woke up, so he took it as a win. It was still early in the morning, too, a bit soon for lunch—which Dean planned on making Cas some chicken noodle soup for—so with no other plans in mind besides relaxing and helping Cas feel better, Dean loaded up the second
I practically leap forward, despite the agony, and throw my arms around him.  It’s like all of my pain instantly melts away when I bury my face in his shoulder, clutch the fabric of his shirt, hold him tighter than I ever have before.  He’s so warm.  I can feel his heart beating, and it makes goosebumps prickle along my skin, makes that warmth bubble inside my chest yet again.
I can’t stop myself from flinching when he nicks my cheek.  I feel a small droplet of blood pooling out of it.
As time passed at the slow, agonizing pace of a snail—but not once did Dean ever let Cas go to look at the clock—Cas eventually cried himself dry and subsequently fell asleep nestled in Dean’s chest, his face still flushed and stained with tear tracks. Nevertheless, he looked much calmer, more at peace, now that he was getting the rest he desperately needed, and that was enough for Dean to allow himself to sleep, too.
“What are you doing up?” he managed to say in between his enamored chuckles, the biggest smile adorning his face as he took in the sight of his glowering, dismal
BUT, please check back in tomorrow for a very big surprise and the final notes update!  I hope you'll be there because I really don't want you to miss it :)
Unfortunately, it was. As soon as Dean stepped into the kitchen, he spotted Sam sitting at the table, taking a sip of an unnaturally green liquid, and the coffee pot on the counter sat abandoned and neglected. The poor thing.
“We’ll all be up front,”  my mother says, her eyes still glistening with tears as she tucks a stray strand of hair behind my ear.  She tells me she loves me, which, of course, prompts a whole round of everyone exchanging those words within their families.  Then Cas joins me at my side, and my hand finds its place on the small of his back as we follow Bobby out of the train station.
“With your coffee,” Cas chaffed, raising an eyebrow as Dean reached for a mug in addition to the glass already in his hand.
There’s a roll of gauze on the ground.  My left hand is all sorts of broken and destroyed, probably beyond repair, and I might not make it back to the hollow if I lose any more blood.  I unroll the bandages with my trembling right hand and wrap it around my left as tightly as I can.  Blood already begins to seep through it, but it’s better.  At least I can’t see the gaping hole anymore.
It’s still just barely past dawn when I leave the hollow and get my bearings.  Golden rays of the rising sun pierce through the canopy and awaken the rainforest around me, bringing forward a new day.  If I’m quick, maybe I can beat some of the other tributes to the Cornucopia and get the supplies I need before they arrive.  It’s early.  It’s possible that most of them were still sleeping or far away from the glade the Games first began in when Claudius made his announcement.  With that in mind to fuel my determination, I start speed walking.
I find the antivenom in the second container I try.  It’s in a small trunk, a syringe filled with blue liquid.  I toss a few strewn bottles of painkillers into the trunk as well as the knife and switchblade, close it up, and hasten out of the mouth of the Cornucopia as fast as my tortured body will allow.  It’s difficult to ignore the two bodies of the boys from District 1 as I stagger out into the open air.
But I suppose we have to start somewhere, and checking out our new houses in the Victors’ Village is as good a place as any.
We’ve only made it halfway to the exit when I hear his voice.  The voice I feared I would never hear again.  The voice so small and so sweet that the instant I hear it, I freeze in place, worried it’s some cruel hallucination meant to toy with me.
Instead of seeming surprised or relieved, as Cas had expected, Dean only smirked over the brim of his mug, his eyes twinkling with roguery. “Told you I had a steel immune system,” he teased.
My heart skips a beat.  The air gets caught in my throat.  I don’t hesitate to lean back in and press my lips to his.  Heat explodes inside my chest, trickles through my blood.  My hand moves by itself, trailing away from his face and to the back of his neck, pulling him closer, deeper into the kiss.  I can feel his breath on my cheek.  I can feel every rapid beat of his heart.  He feels like a dream, too blissful for words, and all I can think about are his lips and his smile and his voice and how happy I am that he’s still alive, here with me, kissing me.
So thank you so SO much for all the lovely comments and the kudos!! You make a sad girl smile. I love and appreciate every single one of you more than words can describe <3
I want to tell her how much I missed her, how glorious it is to see her again, to hold her in my arms again, but I can’t quite find the words to express everything I’m feeling.  Where do I even begin?  Relief of this caliber is so staggering that it can make it impossible to speak.  So all my racing mind manages to come up with is a wholehearted “I missed you so much.”
The mayor then talks about the same things he told us backstage, about how this is the first time in a very long time that District 9 has been victorious in the Games.  And the fact that this year was a Quarter Quell makes it even more incredible.  He talks about how much we inspired the district, how proud we made everyone, how grateful he is to be holding this ceremony right now, which all elicit thunderous rounds of cheers from the crowd.  He continues to congratulate us profusely, thanking us for everything we did.  By the time he starts to wrap up his heartfelt speech, I’m so close to tears again that my lips are quivering and my knees are wobbling.  I’ve really only ever heard this man recite the speech he’s required to before the reapings.  Hearing him pour his heart out because of what Cas and I did is so sweet that it’s almost upsetting me.
When his lips touch mine, I know it’s real.  That everything I’ve felt when I was with him was true and genuine.  That the warmth prickling in my chest was not from familial love or even love for a close friend.  That all the stares, shared smiles, longing embraces meant so much more than I initially thought.
“How do I make it stop?” he groused, squeezing his eyes shut in a desperate attempt to fight off the nausea swirling in his stomach.
We don’t have any other choice.  Unless we want to stay on this train forever, of course, but despite how painfully nervous I am, that’s the last thing I want to do.  We’re finally home.  This is the moment we’ve been waiting for, the moment we fought so hard to obtain.  Why wait any longer?
We finish the rest of the row in silence.  I try to focus on the serenity of the open field, taking in the vast landscape and the warmth of the sun and the gentle breeze that ripples the wheat stalks.  It’s surely the last few moments of peace I’ll get for the next twenty-four hours, at least.  As soon as I get home, Sam’s bound to be panicking about his first day at the reaping tomorrow, and I’ll have to do everything I can to ease his distress while somehow battling my own.
Dean, on the other hand, very nearly choked on his coffee when he heard the sound, spluttering the hot liquid around his mouth as he laughed and laughed. When Cas stared him down with a look of equal parts horror, frustration, and confusion, Dean wiped his coffee-stained face with the back of his hand and tried to compose himself enough to speak. “Looks like Mr. Health Enthusiast’s strict regimen couldn’t save him from getting the flu,” he remarked with an amused grin. Cas didn’t seem amused, though, so Dean was quick to add, “He’ll be fine. Don’t stress. We’ve got plenty of leftover medicine and stuff from when you were sick.”
now dark and rusted with age.  Clearly it’s been a while since anyone has had reason to clean it up.
I have nothing else to throw, nothing else to take my anger and frustration out on.  So instead, I pick up a pillow, collapse to the floor, and scream into the fabric until my throat is raw.
Dean cracked a smile at that, his soft laugh bouncing off the walls of the kitchen, like music to Cas’ ears.
“I know you’re not happy about all of this, Dean,”  he says in a shockingly gentle voice.  I’m taken aback.  “The Games are getting closer.  There’s a lot of pressure.  I know how you’re feeling, but at least try to pretend like you’re having a decent time.  It’s a reality show.  All these people want is a little fun.”
Cas grumbled, snatching his wrist back from Dean’s grip. Dean wanted to make a joke about how hot and cold Cas was being, but thankfully, he bit his tongue before he could. Teasing a feverish, caffeine deficient person about being hot and cold, both literally and figuratively in this case, would probably get him attacked.
That being said, it's going to be another lengthy story.  Probably even longer than this one.  So that means it's going to take me a while to write and publish.  I'm hoping shoot for late December for a publishing date (maybe January or February at the latest) but it'll really just depend on my writing moods.  I go through phases where I write 3,000+ words in one afternoon and then like 10 words in a whole week.  We'll see how it goes!  I hope you're excited nonetheless because I certainly am!!
It’d only been a few months since he and Cas last watched it, but sexy, badass pirates were something neither of them could ever get enough of.
Journeying into the unknown, potentially certain doom, brings a slew of thoughts to mind.  I wonder how excited and eager the people of the Capitol are about the restocking of the Cornucopia.  Usually I think scenarios like these are called feasts, big events that are sure to lure in the tributes who are desperate for life-saving supplies.  I suppose I’m one of those desperate tributes, aren’t I?  Here I am, well aware that I’m waltzing straight into a trap that will undoubtedly end with bloodshed so I can save my district partner.  I just hope it won’t be my blood that gets spilled.
Still, I can’t swallow the fear swelling inside of me.  Anything could happen once I leave the safety of the foliage.  Anything.  But I know I can’t back down, no matter how terrified I am.  If I don’t get that medicine, Cas is going to die.  Plain and simple.  And I can’t die out there, either.  I’m his last hope.  If I die, he dies, and I can’t let that happen.  I made a promise.  I have to get that medicine and stay alive for his sake.
“You’re a lot more stubborn than I thought,”  he says.  “I kind of admire it.  It’ll just make killing you that much more fun.”
“You should’ve come here with a weapon, Winchester,”  Cresh says with a shake of his head.  He almost sounds disappointed.  “That would’ve been so much more fun.”
My vision starts to fade.  My breaths grow heavier, more labored.  It’s a challenge to even remember to breathe.  The pain ebbs and flows like a rippling pond.  A feeble moan slips past my lips as my eyelids begin to flutter.  I’m being pulled toward unconsciousness, and I’m not fighting it.  Anything to make this torture stop.
The only thing important enough to break up our blissful reunion is Bobby.  He tells us that the homecoming ceremony in the square is set to start in less than thirty minutes, and we need to get moving before we’re late.  As much as I’d like to stay here, I know it would not be ideal to be late for our own ceremony.
We share a laugh, one that rings around the open field and into the endless blue sky.  That’s one of the many things I love about Charlie.  Almost every conversation ends with a lighthearted chuckle.  She seems to bring joy everywhere she goes.
The train starts to slow down.  No doubt we’re nearing the station, and Bobby only confirms my suspicion when he backs up, heading for the door once more.  “It’ll be fine,”  he tells us.  “Just take a deep breath, and remember to smile.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right,”  Charlie says with a shrug.  “You do an amazing job, though, Dean.  I hope you know that.”
Pain shoots through my bones, rattles inside my skull as I stumble backwards.  The taste of blood fills my mouth.  I see him stalking toward me again.  I try to lift my arms in a feeble attempt to block his attack, but he just plants his foot right on my stomach and kicks me back so hard that it knocks all the air out of my lungs.  I can’t suppress a yelp when I collide with a pile of metal containers and tumble to the ground, taking them with me.
Cas merely nods, and Bobby laughs because he says they won’t have to work very hard on the bashful part.
I feel another pair of arms wrap around my mother and me, strong but still trembling.  Without a doubt, I know I’m sandwiched between my parents, enveloped in a warm embrace that I never want to escape from.  Somewhere behind me, I hear Cas and his parents talking in garbled sobs.  I’m torn between feeling my heart swell at their reunion and absolutely bawling my eyes out when I think about everything they’ve been through.  I don’t know what to feel anymore.
“Of course,” Cas agreed, but discussing the possibility of their roles being reversed suddenly made him realize something, and it made his face light up. “And as if things couldn’t get any better, you don’t seem to be getting sick. Maybe I didn’t contaminate you after all.”
I don’t have a chance to think for very long.  Cas’ smile vanishes.  He tightens his grip on my wrist, draws a trembling breath, and his voice is softer and weaker and more desperate than I’ve ever heard it.
While climbing to the top of the granary to take stock of the pile of grains inside, my father had tripped and fallen off the ladder, but not before getting his legs caught in the rungs.  He survived, thankfully, but he still can’t walk properly without using a cane to this day.  He hasn’t been able to work in the fields since.
And that makes me realize something, something I never thought I’d experience.  As we sit here, lips pressed together, bodies close, simply grateful for one another’s presence, the realization hits me like a brick wall.  It’s so powerful that I know, without a doubt, it’s real, and I can’t help but smile against his mouth as the sensation washes over me.
I gently shut the locket, hold it in my good hand for a moment longer, try to calm my frayed nerves.  Then, without a word, I take the chain of the necklace and clip it back around Cas’ neck.
A smile tries to form on my face, but it’s fleeting.  There are so many conflicting emotions, so many confusing feelings, rampaging around inside of me.  The warmth is the strongest it’s ever been.  My heart is pounding so fast that I can’t keep track of its beats anymore.  We’re both still alive.  That’s fantastic.  Of course I’m overjoyed, but I can’t ignore a pang of fearful uncertainty.  What would’ve happened if I had died back in the Cornucopia, or I’d been too late to return to the hollow?  Losing Cas is unimaginable.  I can’t even bear to think about it.  So what is this unfamiliar feeling I was trying so hard to decipher before I arrived at the golden horn?
Cas smiled, his heart already hammering against his ribs at the recurring thought of buying a real house with Dean, a place of their own they could live in forever. Dean, of course, was just as eager and ecstatic, but he hadn’t yet browsed the online market. He’d been too nervous, too giddy, wanting to wait until he was with Cas so they could pick out the perfect one together.
I throw each and every one of my pillows against the wall, across the room, anywhere.  I hate the Capitol for creating the Hunger Games.  I hate the Capitol for coming up with the Quarter Quells.  I hate the Capitol for putting us through so much torture, so much agony, all for their entertainment.
My father used to be one of the most well-respected field workers.  He even shared ownership with one of the biggest granaries in the district and earned way more money than I could possibly dream of, but that was before the accident.  I still remember where the sun was in the sky, what kinds of birds were singing outside our house, when the mayor knocked on the door and told us what happened.
I’m startled back to the present, to the quiet room, when Bobby takes a step toward us, gesturing at something behind us.  “I can hold onto your crowns and take them to the Victors’ Village, if you want,”  he says.  “That way you won’t have to worry about them during the homecoming ceremony.”
“You know, I’ve been waiting a long time for this moment,”  Cresh drawls, letting go of my hair and instead tracing my jawline with the tip of the sharp blade.  “I’ve just been itching to see you bleed, hear you beg for mercy, watch as the light slowly drains from your eyes.  I think you’re gonna be my favorite kill by far.”
“Dean!”  my best friend exclaims when she realizes it’s me.  She looks and sounds completely breathless, almost as if she ran all the way here.  “I wanted to meet you when you got off the train, but the Peacekeepers were only allowing family and I tried to tell them that I was basically family but they wouldn’t listen so I just decided to wait out here and—”
Despite how godawful Cas felt—and it just seemed to be getting worse by the minute—he couldn’t help but crack a small smile at Dean’s playfully smug comment. “I’m doomed,” he deadpanned.
“No, no, you’re a very beautiful man, too,” Cas hurried to add, but his preoccupied gaze was still fixed on the screen, on Will Turner’s exceedingly handsome face. “It’s just—”
After she deems our walks as perfectly poised—or at least perfectly poised enough—we move onto seated posture.  She debates between a nonchalant, relaxed pose and an unbending, elegant pose for quite some time before she lets it go and just tells us to do whatever feels right, as long as we’re not slouching too much.  We just have to make sure to smile at all times and address the audience frequently.  They’re here to see and get to know us, after all, the very night before we’re sent off for slaughter.
As the end of our session nears, Rowena has one more thing she wants to go over with us.  Apparently she’s put a lot of thought and effort into it because she pulls out a small notebook and flips through the pages, an eager grin lighting up her face.
“I’m totally okay with being friends with you,”  she said with her head held high, “but I don’t like boys, so don’t get any ideas.”
That was something Cas should’ve known, too. And he did know it, except knowing it and actually hearing it when it directly applied to him were two entirely different animals. It was like his hopes were being crushed into pieces right in front of him. He was going to feel like this for days? Maybe even a whole week? That was too much. The mere thought of a week of this torture was painfully distressing.
Charlie Bradbury is definitely what one would call a unique girl.  Vibrant ginger hair and skin so pale she practically glows in the sunlight.  An attitude so incredibly strong and fierce that no one questioned her when she marched up to the granary owner at age twelve and asked for a job in the fields, which is usually dominated by boys.  A sense of humor so dry and witty that she can make anyone laugh at the drop of a hat.  A love for her friends so extreme that I’ve never had to doubt her loyalty, her care for me, and I can only hope that I’ve given her that same trust.
No time to think.  I’m still alive, somehow.  I have to get out of here before someone else comes running.  I pick up the bloody switchblade with my good hand, wipe it off on my pant leg.  I almost fall over when I clamber to my unsteady feet.  Frantically, my chest on fire and my entire body weak and numb and ready to collapse at any given moment, I rifle through the containers nearest to me.  I still have to find that antivenom.
At first startled by Dean’s sudden appearance, and then amused by his petty annoyance, Sam cracked a smile. “Well, good morning to you, too,” he teased. “I just got out of the shower. Didn’t think you’d be up for another couple of hours, so forgive me for forgetting the coffee, Your Highness.”
Now I have a question for y'all.  When I get around to publishing the sequel, how would you like to be notified?  I can either add an extra chapter to the end of this story, or if you don't want to stay subscribed to this story, you can just subscribe to my account instead (I feel like a cringy YouTuber for saying that I'm so sorry).  That way you'll know when I publish a new story, whether it be the sequel or another short lil one I'm working on :)
I stay silent again and brace myself for the next wave of pain.  I still wince when he nicks the spot just beneath the other.
The other boy from District 1 gets a nine.  The ones from 2 also each receive nines.  Caesar gradually works his way through the list of tributes, and most of their scores range from four to seven.  One of the boys from 4 and one from 6 receive an eight, but otherwise, the scores are rather low.  I feel like I should be relieved by this, but I can’t, not when the reveal of our scores creeps closer and closer with every passing second.
Rage boils inside of me.  I gather up all the blood and saliva in my mouth and spit it at his face.  I almost feel triumphant when he wipes it off with an outraged growl.
I drag her into my arms before she has a chance to finish.  She stops talking immediately, letting go of a trembling sigh, and tightens her own arms around me.  I can feel her shaking as she burrows into my shoulder.
The first trunk I pry open is full of food.  Helpful, but not my objective.  The next two are teeming with shelter kits, tools to build tents and make fires.  I toss those aside and keep searching.  There’s a small container lying on the ground that looks promising, but when I open it, it’s just soup.  I won’t lie and say I didn’t take a sip before closing the container and discarding it.
“Dean.” Cas fought to roll onto his side, his heart pounding against his ribs, but whether or not it was from his rising panic or whatever was happening with his body, he wasn’t sure. He reached over to jab Dean, who was still fast asleep on his stomach, his head smashed into his pillow. “Dean. Wake up. Something’s wrong.”
“But I’m sweating, too,” Cas added miserably. He swallowed, his throat hot and swollen despite the chill that was covering him from head to toe. “I don’t know what’s happening.”
“I know,” Cas sighed, one hand resting atop Dean’s on the table, the other gripping his warm coffee mug. “I hated seeing you so upset about me being miserable.”
We stuff ourselves with a celebratory vanilla cake and blueberry pie that Bobby ordered, chatting and giggling with relieved euphoria, and then it’s off to bed.  Tomorrow we have a full day to prepare with our team for the televised interviews with Caesar the following evening.  It’ll be a lot more laid-back, hopefully, but the pressure of the looming Games is still there, and it won’t be going away any time soon.
Cas didn’t say a word throughout the whole endeavor. When he was afflicted with a cough, he would simply ride it out, and groan and whine at the pain it caused him. It was only after a particularly nasty bit of phlegm got caught in his throat and almost choked him when he finally sat up and peered at the alarm clock on Dean’s nightstand; the numbers he saw glaring back at him through the darkness was like a punch straight to his gut.
Dean laughed again, though much softer this time. He turned onto his side—the whole mattress rocked and about made Cas want to throw up—and lightly brushed a few stray strands of damp hair away from Cas’ forehead. “I know. Fevers suck,” he sympathized. The amusement in his voice was gone, replaced with pure commiseration and solace. “I wish I could tell you there was an easy fix, but there’s really not. You just gotta rest up and drink a lot of fluids. It’ll go away on its own eventually.”
I’m not surprised when Bobby stops the questions to flash me a look.  Now I’m really going to get it.
“Do you know where everyone is today?”  I ask as she snaps off a handful and tosses them into my burlap sack.  I’m fairly certain I know the answer to the question, but I’m curious to see if she has an opinion.
The wheat stalks billow in the warm breeze that sweeps over the vast field.  I listen to them rustle, relish the peaceful serenity of the field that stretches farther than the eye can see.  It’s quiet out here today.  Usually the fields are filled with others like me, snapping seed heads and piling them in tattered burlap sacks to haul back to the granary, but as far as I can tell, it’s just me, maybe a few other wandering souls concealed by the stalks.  I wonder where everyone is.
Dean choked on another laugh, sounding like a mix of surprise, levity, and compassion all wrapped up into one chuckle. “No, no, babe, this isn’t the end for you,” he reassured. He sat up halfway and scooted closer to Cas, then leaned down to press a gentle kiss to his hairline. “You’re just sick. Just a little fever, or flu, or whatever. It sucks, but it’s nothing to worry about, especially when you have me to take care of you.”
An intolerable weight settling on his chest—was it the fever or his own disappointment?—Cas opened his eyes and turned his head so he could look at Dean. “Is this the end for me?” he asked, because it sure felt like it.
Cas was wrapped up in one of the blankets they kept in the Cave for late-night movie-watching, the TV paused on an indistinguishable screen and the remote in his lap. He glanced up when Dean walked in, his face still slightly shrouded by the hoodie, but his grin was as clear as day. “I think you’ll like what I picked,” he said proudly, patting the spot on the couch beside him.
The sound of rapid knocking startles me awake.  My heart leaps up to my throat as my eyelids snap open.  For a fleeting moment, I start to reach for something to defend myself with, but I quickly realize there’s no need to when I hear Rowena’s eager voice coming from the other side of the door.  Part of me is still in the arena, apparently.  I can’t seem to shake that lingering dread.
With a trembling breath, I reach up and hold the little rectangular locket hanging from my neck.  It’s still pleasantly cool to the touch.  I think of the people pictured inside, the people who care about me and are counting on me to make it out of this situation alive.  They believe in me, and I have to believe in myself, too.
There’s a small bedroom on the first floor, far fancier than any bedroom in my old house, and it’s right next to a bathroom.  Full shower, separate bathtub.  Things we never had or even really experienced before the Capitol.  And when I realize the sink has two handles, I reach out to turn them with shaking hands.  Both hot and cold water, whenever we please.  I don’t think Cas’ eyes have stopped widening since we stepped into the house, nor have I bothered to fix my ajar jaw.  There would be no point.
Leaning back against the counter, the percolating coffee filling the rest of the silence in the kitchen, Dean nodded. “Yeah, he’s pretty miserable already,” he said, an uncomfortable ache settling in his chest at the reminder. “I was just gonna bring him something to drink. Keep him hydrated, you know?”
With a growing smirk of his own, Dean drew the hood of Cas’ hoodie back and latched his lips onto Cas’ neck. He was going to utter a low groan for added effect, but when Cas tilted his head to the side, exposing more of his neck to Dean’s keen mouth, and let out an overly pleased hum from deep within his throat, Dean realized he didn’t have to. Sam got the picture, crystal clear.
I don’t get a chance to keep looking.  I’m just popping open the locks to another trunk when I feel the knife press against my throat.
“Why should we play along?”  My blood starts to boil.  I can’t stop myself.  “These people took us from our homes, our families, just so they can, what?  Dress us up in costumes and pretend to care about our feelings and who we are and then turn around and place bets on how long we’ll live?  How are we supposed to play along with people like that?  It’s stupid!  It’s stupid and horrible and morbid!”
The chicken noodle soup was, as Dean had hoped, beyond delectable. Sam thought so, too. The younger Winchester didn’t hesitate to give his compliments to the chef before Dean and Cas disappeared into the Cave to eat and watch a couple movies before bed. Old Westerns, of course. Dean’s pick. Cas wasn’t surprised, but he didn’t mind them, either. They made Dean happy, made his face light up with joy and excitement, and that was something Cas never got tired of.
More pain, and a sickening crunch.  Hot liquid oozes out of my nose, over my lip, into my mouth.  I can’t feel anything other than the pounding headache that worsens with every rapid beat of my heart.
But before he leaves, he stops in the doorway and flashes us an amiable smile of his own.  I don’t think I’ve ever seen such sincerity in his expression.  “I’m proud of you boys,”  he says, softer than I’ve ever heard.  “I hope you know that.”
“Oh no,” Cas said, his eyes stretching wide, the guilt for making Sam sick already beginning to swell in the pit of his stomach.
The chirping birds and the pleasant breeze snap me back to reality.  The reality where all of this is real, and I don’t have to fear for my life ever again.  Not like that.  No, I’m back home, gazing up at the vast cerulean sky, the towering trees.  Cas is right here with me, looking around at the rest of the unoccupied mansions, alive and well and forever going to be a huge part of my life.  Nothing is ever going to change that, and I wouldn’t want it any other way.
I’m starting to get frustrated and panicky.  I’ve been here for too long.  Someone is bound to come running soon, and I still haven’t found a container of medicine.  Not even something as simple as painkillers, let alone the antivenom I specifically came here for.  Dread courses through me when I think about the possibility of the Gamemakers and Claudius lying to get me to come here and encounter another tribute, but the next container I open up holds a bottle of pills.  Now I find the painkillers.  So where’s that antivenom?
Cas wasn’t entirely convinced at first—he was practically built to worry about his family—but he knew Dean was right. Aside from the leftover medicine, Sam was an overall very healthy person. He would probably bounce back even quicker than Cas had. It would just take a bit of time, just like it had for Cas.
They usually broadcast all the tributes’ scores a few hours after the final session, one being the worst and twelve being the very best, essentially unattainable.  We should be able to find out what we received sometime after dinner.  I can’t wait, but I’m also beyond afraid of what number is going to flash on the screen next to my face.
It’s a universally known fact that everyone in Panem between the ages of twelve and eighteen is eligible for the Hunger Games.  Sam just turned twelve.  His name is going to be in that ball tomorrow.  Just once, but once is too many times for my liking, especially with how this year’s event is going to be carried out.
“I have to be,”  I say.  “Who else in my family is capable of spending hours in this boiling field?”
It takes a moment for the ringing in my ears to subside.  Then I hear his frantic, worried voice as he asks me what happened, if I’m okay.  He reaches out to touch the cuts on my face that feel crusted with dried blood, but I’m far from troubled about my injuries right now.  All I can concentrate on is how elated I am that he’s okay.
This has to be a dream.  This has to be some cruel, vivid hallucination caused by my head injuries.  There’s no way this is happening.  I never heard another cannon.  He can’t be dead.  He can’t be.  I survived the feast, got him the antivenom, made it back in one piece, just like I promised.  He can’t be—
“I’ll ask Sam to pick up some flavor packets or Gatorade or something like that so you’re not just drinking water,” Dean reasoned. Cas still didn’t seem satisfied with that offer, so he decided to add, “And, if you behave, and by that I mean drinking plenty of water, I’ll let you have a couple sips of coffee.”
“Dean Winchester, from District Nine, with a score of…”  Caesar pauses for dramatic effect, like he always does, and it’s agonizing.  Just get it over with.  “...nine.”
It’s almost impossible to keep up my defiance when he leans down, close to my face, a murderous glint in his eyes.  “But let’s have some fun first,”  he purrs.  “I’m gonna ask you some more questions.  Every time you don’t answer me, I’m gonna put another cut on that pretty face of yours.  How does that sound?”
“Welcome to the crew, Novak,”  Charlie says, giving him a hard pat on the back.  “There’s no escape for you now.”
That night wasn’t quite as dreadful as the previous, though falling asleep still proved to be a bit of a challenge. The nasty wet cough from before made its unfortunate return, but Cas, although deflated by its recurrence, was more prepared for it this time. With the nighttime medicine, his newfound preparedness, and Dean’s everlasting comfort and consolation, Cas was asleep by one.
His eyes sparkling, Cas lightly pats my wrist.  “Figure something out?”  he offers, his smile widening.
While the following morning wasn’t quite as warm as the previous, the sun was out and bright and shining down on the earth, some of its soothing heat still intact. Cas wasn’t feeling up for another long walk, but he wanted to be outside—he knew the fresh air helped him yesterday—so he and Dean settled for sitting on the steps just outside the bunker. Leaning against each other. Listening to the last few birds who decided to stick around for the colder weather. Basking in what little heat remained of the sunlight. Taking it easy.
Still, there’s not much I can do to calm my rapid heartbeat when the train steadily rolls to a stop.  One quick glance out the window tells me we’ve arrived at the station.  A small flock of cameras swarms the platform, waiting to broadcast our advent to the whole country.  Much to my relief, though, there doesn’t appear to be a massive crowd of people out there, not like in the Capitol.  No, everyone is probably in the square, anticipating the start of this homecoming ceremony.  I barely have a chance to wonder where our families might be in all of this before Cas gently grabs my arm, ripping me back to the reality at hand.
“I’m sorry,”  she murmurs against my chest.  “I wish you and Sam didn’t have to go through this.  It’s horrible.”
“Nope,” Dean replied, popping the “p” for extra comedic emphasis. “You’re the sick person. Pick whatever you want.”
Cas frowned. How could he be warm to the touch? He was sure his insides were turning to ice, which certainly wasn’t natural. Maybe he was cursed. Sam and Dean had dealt with a local rogue witch recently. Maybe she planted a hex bag on them somehow, and now—
An uncomfortable pang shoots through my pounding head as he rips at my hair.  A cry threatens to slip out, but I bite my tongue.  I will not give him the satisfaction.  I will not give him the satisfaction.
As he sits, he draws a full breath, a small smile adorning his face.  “Good,”  he says.  “I just threw knives around at the targets for a few minutes, then aced the edible plants and insects quiz right in front of them.  I think they liked me enough.  I don’t know.  It went well as far as I could tell.”
I can barely move anymore.  Agonizing pain shoots through every part of my throbbing, aching body.  Taking even the smallest of breaths hurts.  Wheezes rattle in my tight throat.  Blood leaks from my nose, floods my mouth, trickles over my lips.  I clamber to my hands and knees, attempt to crawl, but to where, I have no idea.  I don’t even make it an inch before Cresh delivers a swift kick to my ribs, and I cry out, collapse to my stomach.  I don’t think there will be any getting up from this one.
“Trust me, I thought about it,”  I tell her, “but I couldn’t risk not getting food for today.  We’ve been running low for a few weeks now.”
He’s just raising his spear to throw it when I reel back and hurl the bloodied knife at him.  There’s a sickening thud as it lands in his chest.  The booming of the cannon rattles my shuddering body as he slumps to the ground.
I hardly make it to the corner of the hollow before I slump against the rocks and slip into unconsciousness.
“Good,” Dean said, gently kissing where the crook of Cas’ neck would be through the hoodie. “I’m gonna take good care of you. I know it sucks right now, but we’ll get through this together, okay?”
The moment I twist the key in the doorknob and Cas and I head inside, we’re greeted with a lavish foyer and an imposing granite staircase leading to the second story.  Above us, hanging from the tall ceiling, is a sparkling chandelier.  Below us is a stretch of dark hardwood floor so polished that I’m almost afraid I might slip on it.  A princely kitchen, a cozy living room with a striking brick fireplace, and a short corridor leading to another set of unexplored rooms make up the first level.  We’re completely surrounded by luxury, riches we couldn’t even begin to imagine owning a few weeks ago.  It’s no wonder the mere sight of this foyer renders me speechless, and Cas simply breathes out an impressed “whoa.”  There’s so much to take in.
“He’s a very beautiful man,” Cas thought aloud when Will Turner appeared on the screen a few minutes later, which was exactly what he’d said the first time they watched the movie together. Case in point.
“I don’t know why you’re so hell-bent on keeping his location a secret, Winchester,”  Cresh sighs.  My fingers graze the button keeping the pocket shut.  “You’re gonna die here, and my partner and I are gonna find him.  We’re gonna find him, beat him, cut him up until he can’t even cry for help.  But this time, you won’t be around to save him.”
Then my mind wanders away from the twisted Capitol citizens and focuses on home.  Whenever feasts happen, almost everyone gathers in the square to watch, especially if their own tributes are still alive.  I wonder if the people of District 9 are gathering there now, watching in fear and apprehension as I make my way to the Cornucopia in search of that vital antivenom.  Is my family there, surrounded by the support of the rest of the district?  Charlie, too?  What about Cas’ family?  I can’t even imagine what they must be going through right now.  So much rests on this one feast.  My life, Cas’ life.  Whatever happens in that glade is going to decide whether or not District 9 has a shot at obtaining new victors.
Sam loosens his grip on me when we hear approaching footsteps.  It’s my parents, and Cas’ are following closely behind.  I practically jump to my feet and collapse into my mother’s waiting arms without hesitation.  The only thing keeping me from completely crumpling to the floor in an emotional heap is her.  The way she squeezes me like she’s never going to let go.  The way she cradles my head beneath her chin, her lips pressing into my hair.  The way she soothes me, tries to calm my muffled cries, even though she’s crying herself.  Then again, I think it’s safe to say everyone is.
There’s no fight, no energy left in me when he rolls me onto my back.  I can’t do anything when he plants himself on my waist and holds that knife to my throat again, pressing his knees into my sides so I can’t move.  Tears burn in my eyes when I see the ferociously gleeful grin on his face.  He could’ve killed me right off the bat.  Just slit my throat when my back was turned and moved on.  But no, he’s enjoying every second of this.  He wants me to suffer.
The moment I pass through the door and exit the station, though, I nearly collide with someone who starts at my sudden appearance.  All I catch is a glimpse of ginger hair, but that’s all it takes.  In an instant, I know it’s none other than Charlie Bradbury.
This time, Dean wasn’t sure if he should chuckle again or remember how absolutely despairing Cas looked when he realized he was sick. That certainly wasn’t a laughing matter. “Cas, uh,” Dean began distractedly, fumbling with the coffee pot as he got it ready to brew. “He’s got a fever, actually. Maybe the flu, but I’m hoping not.”
His scream stops my heart.  He’s stunned, can’t react, blood oozing out of his abdomen and staining his shirt.  I shove him off me and to the ground far away and clamber upright just as I hear someone else yelling his name.
It’s time to work on content and attitude with Bobby.  He gives us a small handful of snacks to munch on as we take a seat on the sofa and he sinks down in one of the bean bag chairs across from us.  Cas is so pressed up against my side that our legs brush as we sit, but he doesn’t say anything about it, and neither do I.
“Hurry back,” Dean called after him as he strode down the hall and out of sight. He was mostly joking, of course, but a small part of him
My heart skips a beat when Cas rubs his thumb along the back of my hand.  I look at him as his gaze drifts to the ground, and nothing but solace, nothing but happiness, consumes me.  It’s crazy to think about where we began and where we ended up after nearly a month of trials and tribulations.  From strangers to victors.  From district partners to real partners.  And now I can’t even imagine my life without him.  The boy from the fields.  The boy who saved me.
Some of you may have heard, but. . .drum roll please. . .I'm working on a sequel for this story!!  I wasn't ready to say goodbye to this universe and our favorite boys quite yet (and neither have a lot of you guys) so why should we?  Let's keep it rolling.  Plus I had a lot of ideas for a sequel while I was writing this story, and I don't want them to go to waste.  So yeah!!  I'm very excited for a sequel, and I really hope y'all are too!! :)
“You were taking too long,” Cas grumbled. When Dean had to stifle a laugh again, the frown on Cas’ face only deepened. “What’s so funny? I feel terrible, Dean. I don’t find that very amusing.”
Charlie flashes me a sympathetic, reassuring smile as we approach the main storage building.  “It’ll be okay,”  she says, rubbing my arm as the collector comes forward to check our gatherings.
“Speaking of, how’s Sam holding up?”  Charlie asks as we start down the next row of wheat stalks.  Her voice has dropped, and I know why.
In the morning, after a hearty breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and bacon, Rowena and Bobby tell us the plan for the day.  We’ll spend roughly four hours with Rowena to work on our public speaking and presentation skills, then another four hours with Bobby to figure out what kind of demeanor we want to portray to the audience.  This sounds like a lot of work for a three minute interview, but I can’t complain.  Rowena is clearly excited about working with us, and I don’t want to dampen her spirits.
“Just say we annoy you, then. Won’t hurt my feelings,” Dean teased, punching Sam’s shoulder as he walked past to head toward the kitchen; he almost chuckled louder than Sam when Sam let out an insanely overdramatic yelp of pain in response to the punch.
Finally, Caesar reads off the score of six for the second boy from District 8.  My face flashes on the screen next, and the whole world skids to a halt around me.  My heart pounds.  I can’t breathe.  I can’t even bear to look at the screen, and not even the reassurance of both Rowena and Cas gripping my hands can calm me down.
Dean hit the start button on the coffee pot and turned around just in time to see Sam’s eyebrows shoot up. “Cas is sick?” Sam recapitulated, surprised and concerned all wrapped up into one tone of voice. “Oh, man, that really sucks. And he’s never had a human sickness before either, right? So that’s probably making this even worse.”
A faint smirk lights up Bobby’s face.  “Well, I won’t tell you not to be since I was a nervous wreck myself,”  he says, “but it’ll all be good.  You worked hard to get here.  Try to enjoy it as much as you can.”
I reach the line of foliage that separates the rainforest from the open glade where the Cornucopia resides, and everything gets pushed from my mind, everything except the task that lies ahead of me.  I duck down behind a dense fern, the blood roaring in my ears as I carefully scan the clearing.  It doesn’t look like anyone is around.  Not a single soul.  All I can hear is the gurgling of the nearby stream and the birds chirping high up in the trees.  Has no one else come to claim the loot that’s practically spilling out of the golden horn?  Surely I can’t be the only one here, the only one interested by Claudius’ announcement.  This seems too simple, too easy.
In the quiet stillness of the field, it’s difficult to miss the sound of approaching footsteps.  I don’t even have to turn around to know who it is.
I’m showered with congratulatory praises from our team and Cas, who’s grinning like I’ve never seen before.  Bobby even mentions that it’s possible the Gamemakers saw my fight with Cresh and took a liking to my attitude, too.  I’m not sure how true his guess is, but I’ll take it.  I received a decently high score considering the little amount of confidence I had prior to the session, and I couldn’t be happier.
I’m not sure how long we all stand there, squeezing the life out of one another, before my mother finally releases me and plants a kiss on the top of my head.  As my father clasps my shoulder, I see Sam hurrying over to Cas and throwing his arms around his middle.  Cas seems surprised at first—I notice his eyes widen—but he doesn’t hesitate to return my little brother’s embrace.
on who’s going to win?  It’s morally wrong on every single spectrum I can come up with.  Capitol citizens aren’t humans.  They’re a completely different breed, and it’s a kind I would never want to meet in a dark alley.
Once again, Sam got the memo. Cas thanked him for getting all those supplies one more time before Sam left and shut the door behind him, leaving Dean and Cas to their serious movie-watching business. As Dean pressed a final, lingering kiss to the crook of Cas’ neck and leaned back to open the container of muffins—which smelled absolutely divine and freshly baked—Cas unpaused the movie, absentmindedly peeling the sticker off the apple as his attention focused solely back on the misadventures of Will Turner and Jack Sparrow.
Dean thought about Sam’s suggestion to make soup for Cas for about half a second before he spoke. “Yeah, why don’t you grab some stuff to make chicken noodle soup and tomato soup?”
“Cas, can I talk to you about something?” Dean asked. He tried his best to hide the worry in his voice, but he couldn’t hide the way he was wringing his hands in his lap.
Cas slowly came to a few moments later, forcing his heavy eyelids open and groaning as he squinted up at Dean sitting on the edge of the bed. The side of his face was marked with pillow creases, and his hair was even messier than it was before. Dean knew it was likely he still didn’t feel good, but that didn’t alter his beauty in the slightest.
I stay hidden in the foliage for a moment longer, trying to formulate a plan in my racing mind.  There could be other tributes all around me, concealed by the shrubbery like I am, all of us waiting for the other to make the first move and dart out into the glade to retrieve the supplies.  Or, I could be alone.  It’s impossible to tell, and the uncertainty only worsens my growing terror.
Before I can object, Rowena has me flash a lopsided smirk, one with a simpering half-smile and a slightly raised brow.  I barely even make an attempt because I’m sick of this idea already, but it still must look good somehow.  Rowena almost shrieks with delight.  Then she has me run my hand through my hair, but slowly and tantalizingly, because apparently that’s a thing people do when they’re trying to be alluring.  I wouldn’t know.  I’ve never done any of this in my life.  There’s never been a need to.
Cas’ nose crinkled in distaste when he sniffed the liquid in the cup, but he threw his head back and downed it nonetheless; his expression of repugnance only worsened after he swallowed the last drop and returned the cup to Dean. “That tasted like a radioactive orange,” Cas said, barely suppressing a cough from the intense flavor. “Why does it taste so awful?”
Although Cas wasn’t entirely convinced, too overwhelmed by all the horrible sensations of being sick to want to wait twenty whole minutes, he trusted Dean more than anything. Dean knew what it was like to be sick. He knew what to do, knew all the tricks and methods of how to deal with an illness, and Cas believed him.
They kept the ball rolling on their pleasant day thus far when they returned to the bunker and Dean started making preparations for homemade pasta. Homemade chicken noodle soup sounded delicious for dinner, and Cas had zero complaints whatsoever when Dean brought it up to him. But since it wouldn’t be ready for a long while, Sam offered to blend Cas a fruit smoothie for lunch. Yet another thing Cas didn’t have any complaints about. He sipped on his cold, refreshing smoothie while he watched Dean make pasta and while Sam quietly read a book in the corner of the kitchen. None of them spoke much, but it didn’t matter.
I hear someone shouting Cas’ name.  I blink the tears out of my eyes, and I see him stumbling backwards as his little brother Gabriel launches into his arms.  The two of them sink to the floor, clinging to one another like their lives depend on it, shaking and sobbing into each other’s shoulders.  I see Cas gently rocking back and forth as he cradles his sibling’s head, but most of all, I see Gabriel opening his tear-filled eyes.  When they meet mine, he doesn’t even have to say anything.  The glint in his gaze speaks volumes.  A faint smile is just forming on his lips when I give him a nod, just to let him know I understand.
Dean started to smile at the simple but lovely little train of thought, but an unexpected yawn interrupted him. Seven in the morning was still far too early for him, but Cas was miserable, and of course Dean wanted to help him in any way he could, regardless of the ungodly hour. “Just stay put. I’ll be right back,” he said through the end of his yawn, shuffling toward the door in his ridiculous bunny slippers.
“I’m not saying it’s right,”  Bobby counters.  “I’m just saying you have to play along, no matter how much you hate it.”
from me, and they expect me to just chat and laugh along with Caesar Flickerman like there’s nothing at stake?  Like my life won’t be on the line in less than a day?  They’re crazier than I thought if they really expect any of us to be calm and rational during those ridiculous interviews.
The next day, Cas found himself waking up feeling good enough to get out of bed, so in his mind as well as Dean’s, the morning was already off to an amazing start. But instead of sitting cooped up in the Cave for hours and hours again, today Dean had another plan. A finer one, one that would hopefully make Cas feel even better.
Dean shrugged as much as he could while still lying on his side. “Couple days, maybe,” he replied with a sigh. He hated seeing Cas so genuinely miserable, especially when he couldn’t do anything to fix it. “Unless you got the flu somehow. Then you might be looking at a week or so.”
I knew it was the start of an amazing friendship from her parting words to me that day.  They still echo in my head, and they always make me smile.
Or at least it was, until the two of them heard Sam coughing in the distance, the sound muffled by the thick walls of the bunker.
This year, much to my horror, only males are going to be reaped for the special hundredth anniversary of the dreaded Hunger Games.
I think Rowena forgot she was holding onto my hand because when she jumps up to give a squeal of delight, she almost rips my shoulder out of its socket.  But I barely notice.  I’m too overwhelmed with a surge of conflicting emotions.
There was a brief pause in the conversation as Sam glanced down at the corner of his laptop screen to check the time. “Almost ten,” he replied a moment later, pushing his chair back ever so slightly so he could turn to look at Dean. “Rough night? You still look tired.”
Cas returns to the apartment almost exactly fifteen minutes after I did.  I try to read his expression as Rowena excitedly motions for him to join us, but it’s indecipherable.  I hope his session went okay.
There are silver trunks and boxes and containers piled deep into the mouth of the Cornucopia.  One of them has to hold that precious antivenom.  It doesn’t look like any of them are marked, though, so I’ll have to do some rummaging, and quickly.
“Well, the person you love is suffering. That’s never easy,” Sam said, his brow wrinkling into his prominent expression of concern and sympathy. “Hopefully he’ll start to feel better soon, but for now, just do what you
Once again, thank you all so SO much for reading Promises of a Sacrificial Lamb!  I'm beyond happy that so many of you enjoyed this journey.  I definitely did.  And what a journey it was indeed.  Thank you for everything.  Y'all deserve the world <3
Charlie picks up on my apprehension and discomfort in a heartbeat.  I can never hide anything from her.  “This whole Quarter Quell thing sucks,”  she says.  “I feel really bad for you guys.  Are you sure there isn’t anything I can do to help?”
“I’m back, and I brought goodies,” Sam declared, carefully setting the bags down on the coffee table in front of the couch. He rifled through one of them for a moment before fishing out a rather large combo pack of DayQuil and NyQuil. “First and foremost: medicine. I wouldn’t recommend taking it too often ‘cause your body should be able to fight off most of the sickness on its own, but it’s there to help you sleep and stuff.”
Cas managed a faint nod, squinting up at Dean through the darkness and the pain swimming behind his eyes. “All right,” he murmured. “Thank you.”
“You’re gonna be in the square tomorrow, right?”  I ask her.  Even though she won’t be lumped together with the rest of us unlucky boys, I’ll still feel better if I know she’s in the area, just for comfort and support.
“Of course,” Cas replied without a moment’s hesitation, opening his eyes and turning to meet Dean’s gaze. Either he didn’t notice the uncertainty in Dean’s face, or Cas was hiding his own worry now. “What is it?”
A nine!  I actually pulled a nine!  My score is somehow right up there with the rest of the Careers, which is both exhilarating and horrifying for a multitude of different reasons.  I can’t believe I managed to receive a nine.  I thought I’d be lucky to get a seven, maybe even an eight due to my lack of experience, but a nine?  It never even crossed my mind, but I’m elated.
“You came back,”  my little brother whimpers, his frail voice muffled by my shoulder.  I can feel his hot tears soaking through the fabric of my shirt.  “You did it.”
Just as Dean heard the heavy door slam shut in the distance, signaling Sam’s departure, he heard something else from the other end of the hall, this one much softer and frailer than the door to the outside.
I almost jump out of my shoes when he suddenly sucks in a violent breath.  Convulsions shake his body as he flops over onto his back.  It’s the worst fit yet.  Panicked and desperate and hardly controlling my own arms, I fumble with the locks on the trunk and grab the syringe filled with the blue liquid.  I have to press my knee over his elbow to keep his arm steady enough for me to jab the needle into it and squeeze the plunger.  Slowly, the blue liquid disappears into his arm.
Dean stayed awake the entire time, turned on his side so he could keep an eye on the love of his life. It was distressing, really, to lie there in the dark, completely helpless as the person Dean loved most in this world suffered. Every wet, hacking cough clawed at Dean’s heart. Every subsequent whimper of pain and misery only worsened the ache in his chest. He’d given Cas the nighttime medicine, which was supposed to help him sleep. He’d given Cas a glass of water to soothe his throat. And still, Cas was hurting, was racked with sickness, and the fact that Dean didn’t know how else to help just pushed him further and further toward the verge of tears.
“Definitely nervous,”  I agree.  My heartbeat has been steadily quickening since I woke up, and I don’t think it’s going to stop.
“Oh no, it’s three a.m.,” Cas whimpered, the mere thought of being kept awake for so long making his tired eyes burn with tears. And once that first tear fell and slipped down his cheek, there was no stopping the dam he’d just opened up.
But as I tuck my ration ticket in my pocket and turn to leave the fields for the day, I can’t shake the feeling of his bright blue eyes following me as I go.
But this time, when he slowly rose to consciousness in the dim lighting of his and Dean’s bedroom, he was overwhelmed by an entirely different kind of chill. An uncomfortable shiver rippled down his spine. He felt cold all over, even on the inside, like frigid tendrils of ice were unspooling through his veins and leaking into his organs. It was nauseating, and terrifying, and he couldn’t stop his freezing, aching body from trembling underneath the blanket that definitely wasn’t thick enough to keep the cold at bay.
But, he’s not quite done yet.  There’s a pause as he lets the rambunctious crowd settle down, and then the air falls so still and silent that I can hear birds chirping in the distance.  My heartbeat quickens as he turns to us, reaching into his pockets.  What is he doing?  Bobby didn’t tell us anything about this.  The panic begins to seep back into my bloodstream before I can stop it.
Cas was seconds away from nodding again when his tired gaze landed on the coffee pot behind Dean, the one that was slowly filling up with that enticing beverage. His eyes widening—just a smidge—he tried to reach around Dean to grab a mug, but was promptly stopped in his tracks when Dean grabbed his wrist.
All was well. Cas was chuckling without spiraling into a fit of coughing. Dean truly did feel fine, completely healthy, and he loved seeing Cas back on his feet. Everything was back to normal.
Dean almost seemed to read his mind, too, a half-cheeky, half-affectionate smile lighting up his face as he gave Cas’ arm a gentle, playful punch. “Why don’t you go pick out a movie for us to watch?” he suggested, turning to open the cupboard and grab a glass. “I’ll be there in a minute.”
If you want to contact me outside of AO3 to chat or become friends (I'm in need of social interaction) then my Instagram account is starlitshadowsx!
As Dean reached for Cas’ hand and gave it a fond squeeze, so overcome with happiness and relief and affection that it made his stomach do somersaults, Cas leaned forward to press a kiss to Dean’s cheek. “I would kiss you on the mouth,” Cas murmured in Dean’s ear, a slight chuckle in his words, “but I don’t want to risk you getting sick any more than I already have.”
I’m more furious than I’ve been all week, maybe even my entire life, and it only worsens when Bobby heaves a sigh and orders a drink from one of the servants.  “You need to learn how to handle your stress instead of just exploding with rage out of nowhere.”
Something catches my eye, something lying on the ground and glinting in the light that’s peering through the curtain of vines.  I shift to get a closer look—every muscle in my body screams at the slightest movement—and I see that it’s an opened locket.
The playfully fearful glance Cas sends my way only elicits another laugh.  But then he grins, lets out a chuckle of his own, looks genuinely happy to be trapped in Charlie’s tight embrace.  At this rate, who knows?  Maybe they’ll be even better friends than I anticipated.  And in all honesty, I would love nothing more.
Most of the Careers have exhausted the weapons and moved onto some of the intimidating obstacle courses in the corners of the gymnasium, leaving the two of us—along with a handful of tributes from the other outlying districts—plenty of breathing room to get started.  I can tell Cas is nervous, but he assures me he’s ready and still wants to follow through with our plan, so that’s exactly what we do.
I can’t help but think of everyone back home—my parents, Sam, Charlie, even Cas’ family—as the annual Hunger Games host, Caesar Flickerman, appears on the large screen.  They’re undoubtedly watching the same broadcast right now, awaiting the reveal of the scores of their loved ones.  Are they excited?  Terrified?  Too panic-stricken to even look at the screen?  Wondering if we’re doing okay?  I wish I could tell them all that we’re managing, that we’re working well together, that we have a rough plan for our survival in the arena, but I can’t, and that’s almost worse than the stress of finding out our scores.
Somehow, by some divine blessing, I see the vines come into view through my whirling vision.  I sweep them aside and almost tumble down the slope into the safety of the hollow.  I made it.  I survived.  Just barely, but I still survived.  Relief starts to wash over me.
Cas heaved a shuddering sigh, rubbing his thumb over Dean’s hand as he tried to form a coherent apology from the jumbled mess that was his feverish mind. “I apologize for being so irritable, Dean,” he said before the guilt could consume him, his gaze downcast, fixed on their intertwined fingers. “I’ve been stabbed and cursed and exploded and so many other things, but there’s just something about this that I’m struggling to handle. I know that isn’t an excuse, but—”
It doesn’t work.  Unbridled panic surges through me when Cresh snatches the fabric of my shirt and yanks me to my feet.  He slams me against the hard wall of the Cornucopia, pins me to it with his powerful arms.  The back of my head ricochets off the metal, sends a wave of unbearable agony through my skull, makes my vision spin.  My eyes barely have a second to focus before another punch lands on my nose.
“It’s medicine,” Dean chuckled, setting the cup and bottle of DayQuil back on the coffee table. “I don’t know why, but it just always tastes like a corpse, no matter what kind you get.”
“I’ll start wearing eyeliner and never shower again,” Cas said with a smirk, which merely earned him another playful jab in the side.
And just like that, as if I’ve injected some magic elixir, the convulsions stop.  Cas goes perfectly still, a long sigh of alleviation spilling out past his parted lips.  His eyes remain closed as I watch his chest rise and fall with slow, blissfully normal breaths.  I think it worked.  The antivenom worked.
Slowly, trying to shake off his nerves—it was Cas, and Cas never ridiculed him—Dean drew a deep breath. He didn’t know exactly how to go about expressing what was on his mind, but he knew he needed to start somewhere, no matter what it was.
I curl up with the pillow and hold it close to my shuddering body until the anger subsides and allows me to rest.
“Dean?” Cas’ ragged voice called out. The dry cough that followed sounded even closer than his voice; it only took a few seconds for Cas’ shuffling, slouched figure to appear in the doorway to the kitchen. He had bundled up in one of Dean’s old hoodies, his arms tightly wrapped around his stomach and the hood drawn up over his head. He was certainly a sight to behold, what with the sullen frown on his paling face, slightly shadowed by the hood and the hunch in his back. He looked so damn cute that Dean couldn’t help but laugh.
Aside from the medicine, which Cas wasted no time in eagerly grabbing from Sam’s grasp, Sam also bought honey vanilla cough drops, a twelve-pack of light blue Gatorade, a few boxes of cherry-flavored water flavor packets, a box of chamomile tea bags, and a plethora of soup cans, plus ingredients for homemade soup, too. It was a sick person’s treasure trove, a wonderful collection of mitigating goodies, and it was already making Cas feel a bit more optimistic about the days to come.
My chest flutters as I lean forward to press a kiss to his forehead.  “Figure something out,”  I echo.
“Up, up, up!”  our escort chirps, muffled by the walls of the room that’s flooded with bright morning sunlight.  “We’ll be at the train station in less than thirty minutes!”
I have a younger brother—his name is Sam, and he’s my favorite person in the world next to Charlie—but he’s only twelve.  I don’t want him slaving away in these fields for at least another year or two.  He’s too delicate, and I don’t want him scratching himself up or getting heatstroke or anything else that can happen to us field workers.  Not yet.
I comb out the knots in my hair.  While Cas combs his, I return to the bedside table and grab my silver locket.  There’s no way I’m leaving this train without it.  I’m just clipping it around my neck when there’s another knock on the door.
Mocking offense, Dean pinched Cas’ flushed cheek, which only resulted in making both of them laugh. Cas’ laugh, however, quickly devolved into an uncomfortable-sounding cough. Although it didn’t last more than a few seconds, he still shut his eyes and let out a long, frustrated, absolutely despondent groan when the coughing fit finally faded. If he really did have the flu, then he was in for one horrible week. He was already over it, and it had only just begun.
“Think you have a fever, buddy,” Dean said as he tucked his hand back under his pillow, and yeah, that made way more sense than a witch.
