“Well, congratulations. Guess I'll be seeing a lot of you here.” Crowley got up, harshly pressing a button on his phone as he did so. “Megan,” he practically shouted. A short brown-haired woman came in almost immediately. “Take Mr. Winchester to the recording studio Cassie's using.”
Cas didn’t take them off, and even leaned into her half hug as she dragged him out of the hotel to their waiting car.
Cas continued, “You didn’t know where you were though, and you couldn’t know what I needed in order to find you.”
Dean looked up into Cas’ face. He looked worn out. His eyes were soft and seemed like they’d close and send the angel off to dreams. Dean wondered if Cas wasn’t feeling a little more human lately. “Are you okay?” Dean found the nerve to ask.
He did his best to push aside the thoughts of that night, of Dean's wonderous green eyes locked onto his. Yes, it was quick and hot, but it was more than that too. It was the way Dean curled into him. It was the way he looked when he slept. Something in Castiel maybe broke a little that night as he stared down at Dean's sleeping face.
“It’s different, Sam. Go check the spot outside the door. Let me know if you see anything weird. I’ll keep an eye on Ellie here.” Sam nodded and walked off to do just that. Ellie kept a grip on Dean’s finger. Dean smiled at her. Something in him felt quite happy. It wasn’t a weird Amara bond or anything supernatural. It was just the moment that spoke to the secret part of him that always wanted something like this.
“Dean.” It was still all he could say, but he said it with so much reverence. The tone was as close to an
He leaned in slowly and took Dean into his mouth. He could feel Dean shaking a little beneath him. When Cas looked up, he noticed that Dean’s eyes were closed. He was gripping the seat beneath him with one hand, and the other had found it’s way to the back of Cas’ head. The taste of Dean on his tongue, the feel of him writhing about a little beneath him, was enough to make him happy.
Dean rolled his shoulders into a shrug and said, “Make yourself at home.” He thought that he sounded weird when he said it. Cas seemed to note it too with a raised eyebrow. “What?” He didn’t know why he questioned it. He knew what spawned the moment. His voice nearly cracked like he was some pre-pubescent boy asking someone to go steady for the first time. This wasn’t that, and he had no business making the connection.
“A cover song. Weezer just did that whole cover album thing. Figured maybe we could throw in a cover or two on our album.”
“Sure.” Castiel started setting up a soup pot. He got out one of those box soups that come from the Whole Foods back in the city. Soup wasn't complicated. Dean decided to try an actual question. “So you really must hate me then?” He kept his tone light so as not to scare him off.
Castiel just stared at Bobby, hoping he wouldn't have to say it. He knew he had to answer. “I picked him.”
Max stared down at the body. “Not sure I can do this like we did before. This is a strong vessel, even with the decomposition. The fake body would be weaker, not anywhere near strong enough to hold an angel, let alone an archangel.”
“Thought Fallen and Winchester might get together afterwards, after the performance.” Castiel stepped to the window and looked out. It felt like avoidance.
Gabriel was back in control again. “You can talk with him any time. I’m not suppressing him. I’m doing what I can to co-pilot.”
“You don't know what I was doing. Do you always just barge into people's recording time?” This wasn’t how Castiel thought their reconnection would go. Actually he didn't think there would be a reconnection at all, but seeing Dean again did something to him. It stirred up past frustrations. Feelings that never got their release suddenly became petty irritants that drifted from his lips into the space between them.
“Sit,” Cas said, pointing at a simple grey couch in one of his living spaces. Dean did as he was told, then Cas came to the couch, hesitated, then sat at his side. He turned to face Dean, their knees pressing together as he did. “I want us to be friends.”
Castiel moved to Dean’s back and pressed his body to him. He dragged his hands up Dean’s arms and gripped him just below his shoulders. Dean bared his neck to Cas, an invitation that Cas wanted to take. He was already breathing raggedly as Cas pressed in closer. Cas kissed his neck, tasted Dean's skin that still tasted of their swim earlier.
“For a man that just wants his privacy, you sure share a lot. I saw some pictures too. Apparently some things are as I remember them.” He dragged his eyes down over Dean's body.
“And?” Dean went with denial, like that worked for him ever. Three-beer Dean couldn't do better though.
He got out of the car and made his way back to the front of the bar. Dean came out as he approached. “You seen my friend out here by any chance?”
“Follow me,” Uriel said as he started snaking his way past the throngs of people pulling out gear and setting up five million things at once. Dean could hear Jo crooning through her most popular song, ‘Slam Another One Down.’ The crowd was eating it up.
Samuel’s little face scrunched up and turned bright red. The room filled with the scent of his effort. “Well, shit,” Dean said then laughed at his little joke. “That one’s yours.”
“Same,” Cas said. They got to Dean’s room and did the quick change. Dean decided to get Ellie into some fresh clothes, so Cas did the same for Samuel. They weren’t crying, but there was an air of discontent floating around them. “Sam told you about my plans?”
Castiel pulled himself together. “I mean, fuck you, you stupid ass. You’re plenty talented. Now come eat lunch with me so we can finish writing that dumb ass song you shared the other day.”
“You’re welcome.” Cas leaned his head back up into the space between them again. “Why would he send you something though, and then try to discourage your interference at the same time? That’s what doesn’t make sense.”
“Hello, Dean.” He pressed his hands into his pants pockets. How he even had workable pockets in pants that tight was a mystery.
“Can’t be my call. Jack needs what you guys have been doing in heaven. If you can get his power back, he can help heaven. That’s more important than Bunker Bonding.” Dean spent most of the moment staring out the window.
"So you saddle her with a permanent infant and no help? Nice dude, real nice." Dean's derisive tone made Gabriel cringe.
"That's not what I said." Dean looked away. "I gotta be ready for the next hunt. I'm also going a little stir crazy. We've been cooped up for too long."
Uriel joined them, throwing an arm over each of their shoulders. “Did you ever think you'd have so much money?”
Dean struggled for a moment to make the conversational shift. He propped his head on his arm. “I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable.”
The Empty attempted to take on a form but instead shifted through a myriad of globulous shapes that only somewhat represented a humanoid form. The coven seemed to have a plan for something like this. They began a containment spell, casting an orb of glowing purple light to surround the being. It was like the world’s most eerie snowglobe.
Anna's boyfriend, maybe fiance, Cas couldn't keep track, came over and claimed her arm. “Come to the cheesecake table with me. I need someone to take some for me so I can stop looking like a total glutton.”
“World peace,” Dean said in his most serious tone. Castiel laughed at them and walked away to finish setting up for round two of the night.
“I did do a lot of time hopping.” Gabriel looked from one face to the next. “I messed up with her. I admit that. I could have been better. I just had to act quickly. I…”
“Dean wants to know if the babies are okay. The only answer that will be okay for him is to say that the babies are fine and happy.”
“Well, you might be in luck. Castiel packs a back up guitar for his back up guitar. Pretty sure he'd loan you one.”
Dean had it hanging from his back. “No.” He got on the bus. “They’re staying at the Ranch with us. I’ll just hand it off to Cas at dinner tonight.” Dean didn’t make eye contact as he squeezed past his brother and went to one of the seats.
“You were selected. You signed the contract. Welcome to your band.” Crowley threw his arms out at his sides.
“Come on Dean,” Sam called out. Dean snatched up a hat, hardly considering the look of it. Cas could make anything look good, he reckoned.
Cas came to him. “Your methods are not great. Still, I’m glad to have you back.” He pulled Gabriel into a hug, and a few seconds later, Gabriel returned it.
Sam was wandering back to the car. Dean remembered that he had decided to get a drink. The field was pretty. It was not entirely flat. It had the sort of rolling hills in it that would make a kid think of just tumbling over one then the next. Cas moved to the other Dean’s side. He stood close, shoulder to shoulder. His fingers brushed the back of Dean’s hand.
“It’s different from the last trench coat and tie. It’s kinda like your old one, but it’s kinda not too.”
“You can't be confused. Did you just miss the very obvious hand gesture?” Dean's voice rose an octave.
Sorry that this recent update took so long to post. I got way busy with real life. It might be a week or two for the next chapter too, just so you know. Hope all is well in your world.
Dean waited. They just stared at each other. Cas closed the lid to the laptop and set it aside. “Find anything useful in your research?” Dean tried.
Dean remembered this. He had shut it down maybe in order to keep from going after more. They never had time to get where they were going, and that maybe was what was killing him a little each day since North Cove. “You okay?” Cas asked. His voice low and pitched in concern.
“You can submit a list of people that are allowed access to you via your room or a phone call. For instance, your manager is on your list, and so is someone named Ellen Harvelle.”
He drank until the world spun. He wanted to face Dean. He wanted to tell him off. He couldn't though. Night came to him, and eventually the drinking did its job.
"There are many gods for a reason, and we each stick to our areas of purpose. To step out of our place, sometimes even a little, could send the world into chaos. What Loki, I mean, Gabriel did before when he pretended to be a god, even that could have put the world out of balance. But he never worried about such things." She looked back at his vessel again.
“Oh,” Dean liked the idea that Ellen could just pop on in at any time. He smiled at the thought. Then he realized that he wasn’t likely going to be on any list for Castiel. “Yeah, that’s probably…”
The glowing golden tobacco that grew in the vast fields on either side of the long rural road waved gently back and forth on a little autumn breeze. Dean tried to focus on the moment, on the things around him. There was the roar of the engine as he pressed the accelerator as far as he could. There was the feel of the humid air that was everywhere and made breathing feel like a chore. There were the fields, endless and golden like sunshine in summer.
He was fire. He raised up his hands to the smoke and sky. His head tipped back, and Cas said his first word of his new life, “Dean.” He dropped his head and looked around at the yard surrounding the cabin. He couldn’t remember anything beyond the name and face of Dean. He was still as he attempted to roll his thoughts over the little that he had. There had been nothing for so long, a void and darkness. He had spoken with someone. There had always been Dean, his bright soul unforgettable.
Dean swallowed and outwardly struggled for a moment. “Uh, we’ve been here before?” He went with that.
At first, he just lay on his back and breathed in and out as deeply as he could. He stared at the ceiling. Normally he'd focus on the many ridges and grooves in the ceiling texture. It would take his mind off the broader world. Tonight though, his mind wouldn't rest. It had been ten years.
Castiel didn't call out to Dean as he entered the house. He just tossed his bag on the stairs and went on a hunt for him. There was a spring in his step, and a smile that was hurting his cheeks a little spread across his face. Dean wasn't in the house.
“Did he now. Seems I won’t have any secrets left.” Dean laughed. He leaned down to check on Samuel who was now falling asleep in his carseat. Dean was feeling pretty happy with Sam’s choice in carseats. Having the thing act as a makeshift bed right now was a good thing.
Michael slammed down his glass, and retreated to the one space in the bus that could be sealed off from the rest, the bathroom. “We could let him do the last bit of ‘Kansas Cryer,’ Dean suggested.
Gabriel let out a little whoop of victory. “Well, that got the blood a pumping didn’t it?” The barrier fell, The coven sunk to the floor in a collective heap. The children dropped their hands back to their sides.
Cas chalked it up to Crowley's never ending desire for money. And this album was going to be a money maker. Word was already out there about the collaboration between two powerhouse performers. When they added a drummer to the mix, excitement went through the roof, because Kevin Tran wasn't just a drummer in anyone's book.
and never knew what it was to roll around in the dirt a little. The vision in front of him flickered a little. He stopped the car in the middle of the street and got out. He walked down the middle of it and just stopped.
“Yeah,” Dean said with a grin. “Yeah, I think I can be okay with that.” They both got up then and moved to leave. Mary hugged him before they parted. Dean leaned into the doorway for a moment and watched her go before he headed to his room.
“You got it,” Charlie replied, but she sounded weaker. The spell had to be taking a lot out of all of them. The children still held their ground firmly, fiercely.
“I’ll be fine. Castiel has a fine ship. We went over it a hundred times. We even fixed the landing gear up better than ever.” Sam had to make the same explanations, provide the same comfort over and over. “I’ll see you soon,” he finally said as he climbed up into Castiel’s ship.
“Eventually we ended up with Bobby. He knew my dad from before. He had his work cut out for him though, adopting us and all. Sam was 13 by the time it was all legal and shit. I was 17, nearly an adult. I told him he shouldn’t bother with me. Seemed pointless. He tore me a new one for that. Told me I could be thirty, and he’d still want to claim me.” Dean decided to start cutting into his steak. “I’m not much with the whole sharing of feelings and such, but damn if that old man didn’t make me cry.”
Dean took over. “You carved your name into my skin…” Dean held the note just like Castiel would have if he'd been on stage. It was a quieter rendition though.
“How’re you doing?” His eyes were doing the little squinty thing. I could see it even at this distance. A tiny breeze swept past him, puffing up his bright blue shirt. It almost made the little waves on it look like they were rolling.
And most nights he thought of Cas, of the night that almost was. He was full of regrets. He thought that he'd shed the feeling soon enough, but it was always there licking away beneath the surface.
“I’ve seen you change before. It’s weird talking to you with a flimsy barrier between us.” He waved at the outfit. “You ready to parade around yet?”
Cas smiled at him, still so close. “One could say, you are rather easy to read in this moment. It’s not what we need to discuss though. I need to discuss a promise that I need to break.”
Cas got up out of the bed too quickly for Dean to stop. “Put your shoes on. We’re going for a walk.”
Sam came back to his side. “Maybe we should be careful. You shouldn’t have been able to hear a baby whimpering that far away and past all the walls.”
Claire laughed. “You actually think you have time for that?” She laughed again, and sounded like she might choke on her meal. Jack gave her a coupled of wacks on her back, and she continued, “Not sure if you’ve noticed, but you don’t have time for anything beyond childrearing here. It’s just a good thing that you haven’t gotten any more recently.”
“Nope. Doesn’t feel like that.” Dean loosened the wrap around the baby, and a little arm was freed. He put his finger out to let her grip it.
Why was he whispering this? Why was he saying it so close to my ear. His breath was hot and minty. His neck was right there. I could lick him. NO. He stepped back. My heart was slamming out it’s beat in my ears. I could hear nothing. What should I even say now. A confidence was given. He shared the deep secret of people’s kilt wearing habits. I had to respond with something other than freaking out. I leaned in now and puffed out words near his ear. “So did you stick with tradition when you wore it?”
A figure appeared on the road in front of them. It was striding toward them. Cas reached behind his back and undid the Baby Bjorn. Impressively, he removed the pack and handed it to Dean as he stepped fully in front of him. “Take them home.” Dean was frozen for a moment. “Dean!”
At the end of it all, Dean knelt in the woods alone. The smell of the earth was just pungent enough to almost mask the scent of the blood. It was familiar and not. The wet ground soaked into his jeans and gave him a point of focus. The trees loomed up high all around him, blotting out the sky and any stars that might be there. It was a moonless night, and so dark that he wasn’t sure how he was seeing anything.
“We’re driving the babies in the Impala. Sam, Claire, Jack and Rebekah will be in the Buick. I don’t think that we’ll be there as long as them. The babies will have enough park time before they even get there.”
Dean hugged him a bit tighter. “You’re plenty good at that job. I imagine that you had a bit too much on your plate, what with the little hellspawn you had to track, Sam and I going MIA, and add to that extra cases. Even one of those tasks is a full time job.”
Dean had to pull up the calendar on his phone. So many more stops left. Fortunately though, they were all packed into just two more weeks.
Yes he could have gone swimming in the pool at home, but this was nicer. This was private. Dean tossed the floaty into the water, set his beer near the edge, then jumped in. It felt wonderful. The sun was scorching hot overhead, and the water was just cool enough to be refreshing.
I must admit that I'm being influenced by current seasons. To be fair, I always had some feelings about the way their lives were being manipulated, and the compulsion that sent all the kids to the Winchesters was just another layer of manipulation. So, I guess all my plans are coming together on this. Anyway, this was vague, but I hope you like the chapter and are still with me on this rather long journey.
“Well, I’m not so sure I’m the same size as I was last time I was in here. I haven’t exactly been eating right unless you count alcohol as a major food group.” Dean started to moved off with his first outfit, but Cas got up and strode back to him, blocking his path.
“Yes. He won’t admit it. He doesn’t want to leave here. His time with the other nephilim has been a source of joy for him, but if he doesn’t finish the healing, he’ll never feel anything but this constant ache, this sense of not being whole.”
He heard the door close and smiled as he walked to the studio. It was nice to be obeyed. He shook that thought free. “Looks like you did some redecorating,” Dean mused as they walked.
“Yeah, that one. Our album is too depressing. We need one light piece in the mix. Why not a dumb song about donkeys?”
“It’ll always be too soon. I don’t want that again.” He closed his eyes and hoped Crowley would just have mercy and go away. There was a bottle of Jack in the cabinet at the other end of the room; he could make good use of it. “Go.”
“Well, okay then.” Sam’s voice sounded like it was full of unasked questions, but he let them go with that. Cas opened the door, and Dean moved to it.
Sam hugged her back and said, “I’m only helping your dad get back to his vessel. This will be a temporary situation.” Sam patted his chest. “I haven't lied to you yet, and I don't intend to start now.” Phobos shook Sam's sleeve. “Yeah.”
“I just want to see something,” Cas said as he leaned back into his space. “Your downloads are still there at least. I imagine that people got the printed paper too. Why’d anyone bother deleting the online pieces?” He seemed to be just talking to himself.
“In that you’re quite wrong. He is definitely here.” He smiled and turned from her. As he stepped toward the woods. He called back over his shoulder, “Thank you Rowena MacLeod, witch of the Angels.”
And with that Cas pulled him into another one of those perfect hugs, the kind that is warm all the way to the core. Dean said into Cas’ hair, “I'm not ready to be alone.”
“Guess everyone knows my routines except for Claire.” Sam sat on the edge of the bed facing Jack’s desk. Jack turned in his chair and let his arm hang over the edge.
Dean sang the next set of lines, “Maybe I'm amazed at the the way you pulled me out of time//And hung me on a line//Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you.” The song spoke to Dean. He felt like it was their turning point. It was their song. He wondered if the crowd could see how intimate it was. He wondered if they'd already guessed at the feelings that went along with the singing of the piece.
Dean had to focus on that a moment. He stopped walking. He realized that he hadn’t thought about that.
“Two eyes are better than one, I guess.” Dean half smiled as he said it, careful not to let his voice go all stupid.
Crowley just hummed his agreement. “Still, Winchester isn't ready for this, despite what Bobby thinks. He just wants his boy to be doing something. He’s worried that he’s gonna fall apart with all this time on his hands.”
Dean felt something small in him seize up a little. Then the scene in front of him changed, and he watched himself raking leaves. Cas stood off to the side watching him, with a look in his eyes that spoke of sadness and loss and loneliness. Dean wanted to go to him. The scene changed again, and he was asking Cas to take away Ben and Lisa’s memories of him. Dean cringed with the memory.
Castiel entered the conference room that had been transformed for interviews. “Castiel, what a pleasure.” Rowena McLeod  took his hand in both of hers. “It’s been too long.”
Cas smiled at him. “It is good to live again.” He glanced at the clothes. “You going to try on anything else?”
Old Mo said, “She’s got a very devoted mother. She also gets a lot of freedom. She and her mother have been waiting a long time for something stable to come about for them, but…” Old Mo’s voice drifted off like the petals on the parade floats. Sam was staring off at the procession.
That sounded believable. Crowley didn’t have time for anything that didn’t make him money. Cas though. Cas might. Bobby put a hand on Dean’s shoulder and gave it a little squeeze of comfort. “I can’t, Bobby.”
“Really, you don’t want to end me anymore?” She laughed again, and raised the ax. “You were pathetic before, and you’re worse now. Consider this a mercy.” She let the ax swing sharp and fast to his neck. He burst into ash as his head came free. “How nice. No body to bury.”
“Perhaps.” The demon woman stepped toward Rowena’s door. There was still some space between them. Rowena’s finger drew slow symbols onto the doorframe. She had a spell to pair with them. She stepped away from the door into her home. She felt the table behind her. The demons stepped into her home, one behind the other. “Yes, you do not seem to be worth keeping.”
“Maybe. It made you kind. It made you good.” Cas shifted a little and it brought him closer to Dean. He glanced at the babies. They were both sleeping. “They deserve better than me, so I’m glad they have you.”
“Maybe we let Sam and Jack watch them today while we go into Hastings for cribs and supplies,” Dean considered out loud. He looked down at Ellie and wondered if he would be okay with leaving her in Sam and Jack’s care. They were trustworthy, but they lacked all skill in the field of baby care.
I decided to climb down the fire escape. What was I doing? I set the coffee mug down on the landing before committing to the effort. The last leg of the fire escape wasn’t lowered. I undid the latch and slid down with the ladder. It was a cool move that I’d shown Alex when she was a kid. It earned me some points with her. I was trying to earn a different set of points now. He was watching me. I schooled my features and endeavored to be casual on the inside and the outside.
The rest was easy. He was a master promoter. He let them try to keep the college thing going, but that eventually ended as the money and fame took over their lives. “Castiel, are you happy?” Anna had asked him at the end of their first tour.
“I'm a bunch person. I'm not sure if you are.” Castiel was getting out of bed. “I'm going to take a shower. Let yourself in.”
Dean just stared at the letter. It was harsh, and it didn't sound like Cas. Dean carefully folded it back up and slipped it into the envelope. He tucked it into his pants pocket. He considered texting. A brief thank you, an apology, something, but he couldn't think of where to begin. He was angry too. The end was rough. Not seeing Cas, not talking with him after spending so much time with him had been every kind of terrible.
It was just after 11. Keeping up with Sam and Ruby was a challenge. They were a bit drunk. Michael was riding on some sort of high, hanging off Dean's shoulder, thanking Dean for giving him a shot at singing. It had gone fine in Vegas. They let him have moments. It was working for now.
“Did you see the crowd?” Kevin was practically bouncing back stage. “I forgot what the stadium crowds were like. Shit.”
Mary directed her question at Cas. “Did the others come with letters asking that they be cared for by Sam and Dean Winchester?”
“No.” Dean wasn’t sure why he was denying it. He and Cas were clearly a thing. What that thing was was still as yet undefined in a specific sense. That hardly mattered, but he wasn’t ready to get into it with Mary.
“So, I maybe got us some inflatable rafts to take out on the water. They have a swim beach over there.” Sam gestured off to the other end of the park.
Dean let the notes linger on the air between them for one more heartbeat before he pressed in and claimed Castiel's mouth. “Cas,” escaped from his lips before they came together. Dean was still surprised Castiel didn't push him away. He was still waiting for the inevitable. There had to be rejection. Every time he'd ever imagined this, it always ended with Castiel drawing away, making the distance loom up between them again.
“Yes, but that was Lucifer, and not something that we’ve seen before.” Sam paused and closed his eyes. “So how long do we have?”
“I don't get why you'd want that. I mean, we had a good time, I am certainly willing to do more of that.” Dean stopped. He sounded desperate, and truth be told he maybe was. He'd thought of almost nothing but Cas coming home, of him being in Dean's spaces. Now here he was, holding Dean's hand and it felt like an end.
They walked around the side of the house, back past the Impala again. Dean said, “In the beginning, they made me go through a bunch of check in procedures. They had to make sure I wasn't going to slip him anything. I've earned their trust now, it seems. Certainly helps that I was the one that put him here.” There was a little rise in the path. On the other side was the vast Pacific ocean and Sam. “Hey Sam!” Dean called out.
“He’s not a baby.” Clark laughed a little. “I could see why you’d call him that though. Dude didn’t even know about candy.” Clark took a step toward him. He grumbled a little. “I’m supposed to take it easy. Got a little injury last time I saw him.” He moved his hand to his side.
Cas asked, "Why did you sire them? They were conceived at least several years ago. You didn't know anything about heaven falling or any of this at the time."
Dean downed his whole glass and dragged the bottle over for a refill. There was not enough alcohol in the world for this moment. “Look, I don’t know how to do this.”
“Well…” Sam drummed at his knee with his fingers a moment before continuing. “So, he said he was going to send me stuff on a case, and what I do with the information is up to me. He said that he didn’t recommend doing anything, but he had to share it.”
Dean felt the tell tale flutter in his stomach again. Cas just kept setting off one tempest after another within Dean. “I'm sure glad this worked out.”
“No, your money’s no good here. You cured my wife last fall of the coughing sickness.” The barkeep waved his hand between them.
“Yes, from the accident.” Mo looked concerned now too. “You don’t remember the accident?” They were crossing the street between the floats and the procession of bands. Sam and the woman were helping the little girl to her feet. “Sam, I’m taking your brother to see Doc. Seems like he maybe has a concussion too.”
Crowley reached over, closing the video before it ended. “Now listen to this next one.” He was about to open another, but Castiel stopped him.
“Pretty sure Castiel views it that way.” Uriel looked at Anna then back at Dean; the squint deepened. “Sure hope you don’t end up being an asshole.”
Castiel slumped back into the seat. “I chose Dean, but I never really believed he'd say yes. He hates me. We haven't spoken in years. I had to pick someone. Crowley had me there. He said I had to be a band and not just a solo act. It's in my contact.”
“Yes, I’d like to read about them. Can you help me?” She let her head drop a little and looked up at him past long lashes.
Cas smiled. He moved close to Dean then, pressing this body against Dean’s chest. “Hello Dean.” He knew he couldn’t ask outright for Dean’s consent, but he knew he could make it plain in any number of ways just who was riding shotgun in this moment. Dean knew him, and he knew Dean.
"Well hello yourself," Dean said. He bought her and the other women drinks, but it was clear where his attention settled. He even tried to push Cas into conversations, called him his friend, his buddy, but Cas was uninterested in the progress that would come from that.
Cas just hummed a little response and picked up a weight like it was a feather. Dean watched him. “I see.”
Ruby came over and sat on Sam’s lap, kissing him luxuriously. “Get use to it Deany. We famous!” she said after she pulled off Sam’s mouth with a pop. “Let’s have all the sex tonight, babe.” She was staring down into Sam’s eyes. The boy was gone on her.
“Maybe.” Sam looked from Phobos to Deimos. He turned away from Rebekah, but she didn't leave. “You okay?” He set a hand on Deimos’ shoulder.
“Yeah, Sam said it was good for us. He said that you thought that the best thing in the world was to sit on a beach somewhere drinking a beer with your family,” Jack offered up as he gathered the used plates and cups to toss in the garbage.
At that moment, Dean let go of Cas’ hand. He’d felt rejected in that moment. Now watching it from the outside, he saw it differently. He felt the guilt wash over him. “I don’t need a babysitter, Cas.
The band put up with his intensity. Anna tried to get him talking, but he never gave her an inch. She even seemed to guess, asking about Dean and how he was.
“Oh, stop,” Sam said. Then he turned his attention to Cas. “Cas.” It was almost a question. “It's been years.” He reached out his hand, and Cas shook it.
Crowley explained, as Dean hovered over the paper with his pen poised to sign. “This says I get a cut of the income from all joint albums and tours that you complete with Castiel.” Dean signed. “This dictates Bobby's cut of the profits.” Dean signed again. “Here’s the timeline for when each album is due.” Dean signed without reading, trusting Bobby to have his back. “And here you guarantee that you'll stay with Castiel's band for a minimum of one year even if you satisfy the tour and album agreement earlier.”
“Just your happiness.” Cas glanced at him quickly then away. He reached out his hand while not really looking at him and settled his palm over Dean’s heart. Dean was sure his heart was just shy of bursting from his chest right into Cas’ hand. Cas curled his fingers just a little like he was holding Dean there. He finally looked back at Dean. Their eyes were locked on each other, and Dean leaned toward him.
“You won’t get enough sleep if you keep trying to read what I’m already reading.” Cas scooched up the bed so his back was pressed more to the headboard. He angled the laptop a little so that it was harder for Dean to read it.
"I know. It doesn't make sense. I already have Kevin on it." Gabriel pushed open the door to the briefing room.
Dean sat back at the table and poured out a few fingers in each glass. He slid one over to Mary. She took a sip and then said, “No.” She waited a moment then added. “Pretty sure we’re just best friends like you and Cas.” She leveled her gaze on him and didn’t blink.
“Bobby and I can just share my room if it hasn’t been repurposed. It’ll make it easier for us to care for the babies,” Mary said. Dean looked back and forth from the one to the other. Mary moved her arm to Bobby’s shoulder and gave it an affectionate squeeze. He smiled at her.
He poked at her thoughts and saw attraction. "Come with me a moment." He beckoned and walked toward the Impala. She followed. He pulled out Dean’s keys and unlocked it. He wasn't sure why he was doing this, but he was committed. He opened up the door to the back seat and got in. "Get in."
“So glad you wanted to be found,” Dean replied. He reached down and cupped Cas’ cheek in his hand. Castiel nuzzled into him then went back to it. Dean’s fingers were twisting into his hair now. His body was arching up off the bed. He was sure this was it; this was how he would die. Castiel’s mouth on him would be listed as his cause of death. “Cas, Cas, Cas,” he breathed out. And then he was coming. Castiel pulled off as Dean continued. He scrambled back up the bed on top of Dean and lined himself up with the crook of Dean’s thigh. He was thrusting into the space as he kissed into Dean’s neck. He had his fingers twisted up with Dean’s
Halfway home and Cas’ hand found its way back to the seat then Dean’s shoulder. His thumb did the little stroking thing that it had done before.
“I’m getting up.” Dean handed back the tablet, hardly caring about what it had to say. Case or not, Cas was here. He pulled on his sweats and lifted one arm then the other to see if he smelled bad. He pulled off the t-shirt he was wearing and replaced it.
Something felt off, like the world had just gone to static on an old motel television set. There was a high screech and scratch. He felt dizzy.
Dean was met with silence, no follow up, no sign that he'd even read the text. He had. Dean knew that he had.
Castiel took the phone and stepped back. Dean's phone wasn't locked. Cas opened his contacts and added himself. “Can I send myself a text?”
“Have fun with that,” Dean said with a smile. “Pretty sure the babies are gonna do the napping thing here after the meal.”
The motel room in Tennessee was like all of the rooms that the Winchesters seemed to find. The garish carpet and ancient bedding paired with the world’s gaudiest wall art. Somehow it had become easy to ignore. They walked in after finding food in town. Dean tossed his bag on the dresser next to the too-small  TV. He wasn’t quite ready for sleep yet, but he was ready for a shower so he called it, leaving Sam and Cas to themselves.
“TMZ is not news.” Anna rolled her eyes. “Really though, Cas. What if he doesn't know. What if he thinks all of that,” she made air quotes before continuing, “was just faked?”
He took his foot off the accelerator and let the car slow down to a stop. His heartbeat was loud in his ears. The world was a dizzy mess outside the car. The words were there too, a counter to the noise of his panic. He tried not to breath too much. The pollen was here too. It was getting to him. He lowered his head to the steering wheel and pressed against it with his forehead. He just had to keep going. He just couldn't turn back.
Dean blanched. "Mostly." Cas' brows came together. Dean swallowed and explained, "No one likes being a ditchable prom date. If you sleep with someone and it meant something, you stay 'til they wake up in the morning." Dean swallowed again and stared straight ahead at nothing. "I stayed, waited for Gwen to wake up before I left."
Cas got up and set a hand on Gabriel's shoulder. "We've done a lot for Chuck that he never could have appreciated. He's far too self-absorbed for that and perhaps a little cruel." It was a rare criticism coming from Cas. Although he had never voiced much that was negative about Chuck before, it may have only been because he was an angel. Being human seemed to have freed him of certain restrictions.
Dean felt his face warm up with that. Castiel was pulled away by some studio guy. The others all had someone to talk to. Dean stared out the window at the city with all of its lights and mayhem. He subtly scanned the room for small escapes, places where they could go and not be seen.
The projections made it look like Cas was falling. At one point he seemed to resemble the falling angel on the cover of the Zeppelin album that Dean loved so much. Then Cas separated from his guitar and slowly began to actually descend to the stage.
“Not a problem. Thanks man.” Dean took the box and closed the door. He set it down on his dining room table. The penthouse windows were all open. The early morning light was filling the room.
Dean’s hold on him tightened. “You’re not.” Then silence settled into the moment. Dean just kept holding him. “Sam ever tell you what it was like for me when you were gone?” Cas turned a little to him, but their faces were so close he couldn’t really get a good look at him. “I bet he didn’t. Probably thought it was my story to share or something. Well, we both know I’m not the king of communication.”
There would also be fans. They'd line the street and the walkway into the main event. It was that part that Dean hadn't considered nearly enough.
Opening it, reading it, all of that seemed like the worst possible thing to do. Life was full of bad choices, so of course he opened the envelope.
Rowena hummed around the thought of suddenly being perceived of as dead. “In time they will know the truth. People speak of me.”
“You ever miss it? The freedom of just popping off to all of that whenever you wanted.” Dean waved a hand at the ceiling.
He had his leg pressed into my thigh. It was like he was almost straddling me a little. If this room wasn’t gifted with a giant, full window facing out to the street, I might have acted on an impulse. It was good that I didn’t, as he was running a razor over my face. Bleeding wasn’t exactly a turn on for me or him either I reckoned. He finished the shave and scrutinized my features. He leaned in closer. His damn leg pressed in against me.
When she’d finally felt like she’d learned all that she could, she closed the book. She thanked the priest for his patience and left. She cast a glance back at the church. He watched her as she walked away. A good priest would at least pretend to look away. She didn’t mind. She noted the smile that touched his lips.
Dean was in the bed with his eyes closed, but he wasn’t asleep. How could he sleep in his present situation? Even with his eyes closed he knew that across the little gulf between the two motel beds was his brother, mouth agape, the low rumble of air rolling in and out of his sleeping mouth. That wasn’t why he couldn’t sleep though. The reason he couldn’t sleep was right behind him in the same bed. If Cas would just roll over, sleep facing the wall, maybe Dean would be able to sleep. What was really keeping him up though, was the fact that he just knew that Cas was absolutely facing his back and that he was absolutely not asleep.
Dean didn’t know what to say. He wiped his palms down the sides of his pants. “Uh, so, what’d you pick up on?” At least if he knew, there’d be some way of dealing with it he supposed.
They finally settled in for the night many hours later. The babies didn’t want to sleep, and Dean feared that their schedules were now in complete disarray. They were restless, and not still enough for Dean’s liking. It wasn’t much of a shock that at 3:00 am they both started wailing.
“Of course.” Dean stepped to Cas’ side. Cas clapped him on the shoulder and directed him through the door.
“Huh?” Dean just kept staring at the little smiley face. “What the hell is that supposed to mean?” No one was there to help. Dean made sure Michael didn't think this was a good time to bond or some shit, and Sam and Ruby were always happy to be in their own private space.
Dean looked at Bobby, hoping to see any reason to keep from signing. Bobby nodded toward the contract. Dean signed. Crowley was grinning from ear to ear. Bobby was smiling back at him.
Cas sighed. “I know.” He then reached for the stereo and cranked it up nice and loud. “Travelin’ Man” filled the car with a bit too much meaning. They drove on like that until they reached the exit.
This was how the band came to be. Castiel had a bit of a moment in their shared orchestra class. “We need a break. All work and no play is going to kill us.” Looking back it was funny that it was Cas that said any of that. They all started meeting at Uriel’s garage a couple of nights a week.
It took awhile for them to pack the cars and get the babies ready. This gave Dean plenty of time to change and such. Dean was learning that everything takes longer with kids. As Dean got in the car he asked, “Did we pack the formula and the diaper bag?”
Jody texted them the details, a simple haunting really. The difficult part was figuring out what the spirit had attached itself to. Dean refused to get a room, denying that it would even be necessary. He even called Sam at 10 to see if he needed them to come home. Claire answered though. “Sam is sleeping. Who calls a house full of babies this late?”
“Cas.” Dean let his thumb brush an arc over Castiel's cheek. Castiel mirrored the move on Dean. “What now?”
“I don't think you should do that.” Sam pulled Rebekah back to him and into a hug. “You'll see things that will be rather awful. She hasn't always been good, but she is now.”
“It’s new. Well, it’s new by human standards. The light from it hasn’t reached this planet yet. So it makes sense that you wouldn’t have calculated for it. However by not calculating for it, you’re missing key information. Feel free to use my numbers.”
Dean wanted to ask Cas how he’d been. Dean wanted to poke and prod at him until he knew every last detail of the weeks he had spent away from the bunker, away from them. He didn’t know where to begin though. He didn’t know just how Cas would take it. Instead Dean glanced at him every now and then in the rearview mirror, just to make sure he was still well and truly there.
He pulled out his own knife and drew it across his palm. He let the blood pool. Rowena pulled a bowl from her basket and held it out to him. She collected the blood. “What will you do with it?” he asked.
Charlie got up. “Show me.” She started to move out of the kitchen and Sam followed, Rebekah went too. Dean could hear Charlie saying, “She was absolutely fine when we parted.”
There were embers still in the middle of the ashes. They seemed to throb with an amber glow as the first light wash of air brushed over them, then another breeze would do the same a few moments later. One might look at them and see them as heartbeats in the space where everything was consumed. One might even find hope in there if one chose to look.
“Penny for your thoughts,” Bela settled into the seat next to him, her light brown hair pulled up into a neat ponytail.
The cemetery was huge. It spanned what seemed to be a near square mile of mostly unmarked graves. Someone had planted trees, large sycamores, throughout the place to give it something of a park-like setting. The graves that were marked, were old, dating back to the early 1800s. Some people brought their kids to the cemetery for walks in the afternoon.
It was hard to get any research done with all of the baby duty that needed to be done. When Ellie was done feeding, it seemed to be time for Samuel to do the same. Then there were diapers to be changed and holding that needed to happen.
Dean watched Cas not sleep. He waited. He focused on the breathing that came too rapidly to be contributing to a peaceful sleep. There was space between them, a few scant inches. It was nothing really. His hand could slide across the space, take up residence on Cas’ chest, just to let him know that everything was okay.
A phone pinged across the room. Castiel passed the phone back to Dean. Dean looked down at the text that Cas sent to himself.
Dean wasn't sure how secret this all needed to be. He hadn't signed an NDA so he figured it was fine. Still he kept some details to himself. “Might be joining up with a new band.”
The Impala was in the student parking lot. Dean must have moved it there while he and Joan had been alone. “You certainly parked it far enough away from the other cars.”
Dean switched off the stove and removed the bottle. “We have actual baby formula.” Dean started to make up the bottle, but Cas took over. Brie had calmed in his arms since he took her. “Looks like I’m the baby whisperer in these parts.”
“Not yet. I’m studying it though. I think it’ll come in handy given Phobos and Deimos’ parentage.” He reached down and tapped the picture. “Look.” Sam turned his gaze to the image on the page. It was a depiction of Kali in the middle of a river, eyes glowing bright red, skin dark as pitch. She lapped at a pool of blood on the shore.
He was assuming that with good reason. “There’s another star there that hasn’t been discovered yet.”
“No, the end bit of ‘Kansas Cryer.” Dean clapped him on the shoulder. “We’ll see how that one goes.”
“You've been adding sugar. I saw you.” Cas handed the mug back to Claire. “Drink up.” Cas came back to the table and stood near Dean's seat.
Cas stood. "Biology, makes anything Dean and I would have done before safe. I think you're missing the bigger picture though." Cas took his hand. "I'd have thought that you'd have noticed when I hugged you at least."
“No.” Cas didn’t elaborate. He just stared back at Dean. That one word seemed to hang in the space between them.
“I never have been accused of maturity.” Luc laughed now. What really bugged Castiel was that Anna and Uriel laughed with him. “Really was impressed with Sam. Guy can belt out a tune like no one’s business. He and that gal Ruby were singing something new in the elevator. Caught ‘em red handed.”
“Bobby Singer.” The voice on the other end of the camera. Castiel knew about the odd rivalry between the two producers. They weren’t always at each other’s throats though. There were pictures enough to prove that.
Dean thought of the closeness and the desire to keep it. Cas was warm at his side and the computer was the brightest thing in the room. The light from the dinette by the window was dim and barely illuminated the room beyond the table. Outside the world was country dark. A little light was also coming in from under the bathroom door. The glow of the laptop on Cas’ face gave his features a sharp edge. He was all shadows next to Dean.
Lisa was talking about the night they meet, then they were telling about the proposal. Cas felt the drink hitting his stomach. He spoke to the TV, to Dean. “Guess you gotta really care about someone to go on national TV to talk about your engagement. Asshole.”
Afternoon rolled on into early evening, and they packed up to go. The drive was quiet for a time, then the babies woke up and started wailing at full volume in the back seat. “Guess they don’t like being confined now,” Dean said.
“I’m good.” Bobby carried Zeke off with him toward the kitchen. “We figured that the demons took them for some sort of ritual or something. Then we found the letters.” Mary shifted Brie and pulled a letter out of her jacket, which Dean only now noticed was not her jacket at all, but Bobby’s.
I walked over to his appointment counter and looked at his calendar. “Looks like you don’t have anything going on tomorrow night. I’ve got that night off too, as luck would have it.” I picked up a pencil. “Mind if I pencil in dinner here?” Cas nodded. “I’m writing in my number under my name. Shoot me a text if you realize later that you can’t go.”
To be fair, he wanted to get to know the being that he claimed as his father. He wanted to impress him. Dean kind of understood that a lot. He shot a glance into the mirror at Jack who was smiling all gummy and bright out the window. Cas was watching the kid. There was this pure look of admiration painted on his face that made him seem even more alive.
“Then he and Luc should get on great. Two peas in a pod.” The warm air of the studio was almost too much at first.
“You said you hadn’t,” Dean replied as he walked into the room with a heaping bowl of popcorn. Dean sat down right next to Cas and started munching. “You gonna hit play?”
“Not an answer, Cas.” Dean did look at him now. “How would you feel,” he repeated. Cas didn’t answer, so Dean went on. “How would you feel if I told you that we watched a movie together and I laid my head in his lap? How would you feel if I told you that he touched me, stroked my hair, held me?”
Sam didn't answer, so Dean did. “We take care of people, Rebekah. Part of that includes worrying that we're not doing our best.”
So they packed the Impala and headed out. It was a long drive, but they had the promise of a halfway decent bed, since Sam gave them a new credit card to use. He even set them up at a hotel as opposed to a rundown motel. Dean seemed a little giddy with the prospect of a clean room with maybe a mini-bar.
Joan was beautiful. Cas opened his eyes and stared at Dean's eyelashes from up close. His eyes were closed, his lips parted. Cas stepped back from him. "Wait here." He moved toward the door. He couldn't stop thinking about how it wasn't him that Dean wanted. It was Joan's body and before that Gwen's that Dean craved, never him.
Deimos and Phobos closed their eyes in sync, and their mouths moved together, forming words that none of them understood. The room seemed to vibrate with energy. The lights flickered. Then the room was awash in blood, thick and warm. It coated everything. Then a voice echoed through the space, “Who summons me?”
“No Dean.” Castiel pushed him back. He'd meant it to be gentle, but Dean was very unstable. He tried to stop Dean's fall, but he failed. Dean ended up in a humiliated heap at Cas’ feet.
"Like I said before, I have nothing to offer him." He turned to go and said once again, "So thanks." She didn't try to stop him this time.
“You do.” Dean turned around. “When are you going to stop acting like this?” He waved his hand between them. “I gave you what you wanted. I swear to God, Cas, I don’t know what to do here.”
Crowley opened another video, and Castiel watched it. “Don’t pick this one, but feel free to get back in the zone with him. I’ve got ten more to show you after him.”
“Nah, just popping my back. I slept on it wrong, and now it’s all out of whack.” He looked back down to the couch. “Mind if I stretch out on here next to you?”
“Talk to you about things that matter.” Dean played with his glass but didn’t drink from it. The amber liquor swirled around.
“So this is gonna be better than Hank’s burgers?” Hank's was the local burger joint. It was quite good. He’d gone there with Dean. It was what spawned Dean’s proclamations of being the best burger maker ever.
Gabriel and Dean entered the orb. Kali called out, “Get out. We have this under control.” The Empty had split though into multiple forms, and the three of them were trying to attack each one separately.
“Oh, branching out into film? You should have told me. I've got all of the connections.” And she really did. She'd been in two films that premiered this year alone, and both were getting a lot of buzz.
The first couple of cases, they just barreled through. They salted and burned, and fixed what needed fixing. It was all easy stuff, stuff any first time hunter could handle. Cas sensed that Sam was throwing them softballs because he thought that was all they could handle.
The boys raised their hands in a synchronized motion. All at once, both seemed to shoot out a wave of golden energy. Dean had seen this before from Jack. “More nephilim,” Dean whispered. The energy hit E’brem and a moment later he was gone.
Bobby sighed, “Dean, it's a good deal. If you need to get out of it, you'll just have to bust ass and write faster.”
“Back pocket.” Castiel's hands roamed to Dean's lower back then down to his ass. One hand dipped into a pocket to retrieve the phone. The other just held onto the other side.
True, the government was still heavily involved. They had to be. Much had changed though in more recent years. Private citizens could now pay to fly beyond the atmosphere. Before it had been something for the very rich to do, but in recent years it had become something that was available to the only slightly upper class. And in time the middle class would find themselves in the vastness of space too.
Dean read through the rest of the rather pointless messages, then he went to his news feed. There were pictures of the night before, of the various cities that did New Year’s Eve in a big way. He searched for his band and saw pics of them rocking it on stage. The comments seemed good, enthusiastic even. He searched for Fallen next and saw a lot of the same, but in the background he could see himself and Sam. It was nice seeing a little visual reminder of them out together last night.
Castiel rushed out the gate. His car wasn't there, wouldn't be there for at least another 20 minutes. The gate opened behind him. He didn't want to turn, didn't want it to be Dean, but he also didn't want it to be some stranger either.
Dean had wanted to make the full trek all the way back home to the bunker. It was long though. They stopped to stretch their legs. Something was eating at Sam and Cas. Dean remembered that he’d taken some risks that they didn’t like, but that wasn’t what was important about this moment, this place, and now he was standing here witnessing it with this devil kid.
“What the hell are you doing here?” Castiel took another step into the room. It brought him closer to Dean. Dean sucked in a breath and said, “What, you didn't humiliate me enough at the studio? You want to bring round two to my house.”
With that, he turned and walked away. Dean watched him go, the guitar strapped to his back now. Dean considered going after him, trying a little harder. He could fake confidence, push Castiel against the nearest wall and kiss his breath away. The guitar would get hurt. Dean didn't move, didn't catch him before the corner, and like that he was gone.
“You do have too much faith in me. There’s so much even I can’t access.” She sighed though and rested her head on Claire’s shoulder. “Promise me that you won’t let me do anything stupid. I think you might be the only one that could keep me focused on the here and now.”
“Yeah, I’ve been worried about that,” Dean admitted. “I trust you though, so just tell me what you need.”
“Sounds like a solid plan.” Dean lifted back the comforter and sheets on the other side of the bed. There was only one bed. He didn’t think to get two. Angels didn’t sleep after all. He glanced over at the table under the window with its two modern chairs. They didn’t look comfortable, but they were cool in an artsy way. They were made of bright red plastic with vinyl covered cushions on the inside.
Their first song was a fast number that they started playing as they walked out onto the stage. The crowd went crazy. Cas entered the stage from the right and Dean came out on the left. Kevin followed Dean then took to the drums, where he started dropping a beat.
Castiel wondered if they could have waited just a little longer though. Luc was talented, but maybe they could have found someone less pretentious.
"I could move up." Cas got out and took the passenger seat. Dean looked at him like he wanted to say something. The silence just stretched though. Cas decide to break the silence. "You have a good night?"
Dean stepped up to his side and set a hand on him. “Now?” He could feel his heart rate picking up. He wasn’t sure if Cas could feel his hand shaking, but it was, and he couldn’t stop it. “Why now?”
So, that was a very long haitus, and I am sorry. The story just wasn't forming for me, so I let it sit and sit. A lot has happened since I wrote the last chapter, but not a lot of writing. The end is in sight on this one though, and I will be finishing it.
I watched Cas walk down that driveway with his son, and I thought, yeah, I could stand to watch him a bit more. He had these little specks of flour on his cheek, and I wanted to brush them off all night. It would have made things awkward though. Instead I watched him go. I should have exchanged numbers with him. I should have asked him out, but I didn’t. I didn’t want to take a chance at messing it up.
“Sh.” Cas pointedly glanced down at Samuel against his chest. Dean stopped making his nonsense noises. “I suppose this is one of those times when you are not a challenge.”
“I was asleep. Pretty sure I wasn’t giving off any readable vibes.” Dean drove the short distance to the restaurant and parked the car.
“I just mean that when you and Sam were gone, I tried to keep working cases while looking for you. I thought that it’s what you’d want. You both do so much. You save people, and I didn’t want that to stop while you were gone. I tried to step in and do your part. I was not good at that job.”
Everyone took seats around the room. The tables were arranged in a large rectangle. Gabriel stood and turned on the large display. “Welcome, everyone. By now you’ve all heard about the events of the last twenty-four hours. With the exception of Commander Novak, I’d say everyone has at least received the initial briefing.” Gabriel looked to Cas and added a little under his breath, “Don’t worry, I’ll get you up to speed.”
Dean looked away from Cas back to the counter. “I don’t want him to have you.” The confession felt wrung out, twisted from Castiel’s mouth against his will.
Cas introduced himself as a professor from some west coast college. She accepted it. He said that Dean was his assistant. She was kind, and she even showed them her research. Cas could tell that she wasn’t showing them the calculations that mattered. That would have been foolish. It was her discovery to make.
Cas was in his room. Dean was sitting up in bed, but he got up. He moved slowly to Cas, who closed the door behind him with a quiet click. Dean was breathing like he was nervous. He moved toward Cas though, and Cas moved toward him. They met in the middle of the room. Cas reached for him first. He brushed a hand over the back of Dean’s hand. “You can tell me to go.”
“I’m E’brem. I’ve come to let you know that I’ve claimed Hell. I’m the new king.” He stopped moving toward them. Dean had also stopped moving, though he knew that he should be making the trip back to the bunker a quick one.
“Not the same. Go do your week.” Dean looked around the room. “Maybe not tonight though, unless you think Jack needs the healing to start right away.” Dean thought about what he was saying. If Jack was hurting, he didn’t want that. “I think tonight is going to be rough, but Jack is more important.”
She went to town again to read more of the angel book. There was also a part of her that wanted to see the novice again. He was pleasant enough to look at, and that was in its own way encouragement. She did want to know more of what one could expect from an encounter with an angel. Were they dangerous? Warriors or protectors? She’d read conflicting stories. Some showed angels as helpers to man, and others painted them as destroyers of man.
“My pleasure. Seems as though she worked well for you. Your set sounded great.” Cas seemed different, less confident than he was earlier. His whole frame seemed to hunch into the table a little, like the day had been too long.
Dean wanted to protest. It didn’t make sense for them to separate. After all, it was Cas that was going to be sensing things. “Fine,” Dean said instead.
“Ah, you’re in luck,” Becky interrupted. “Looks like Castiel has you on his list.” She tipped her head to the side and said as if to herself, “Just you though, no Sam.”
Dean felt his hands start sweating again. It wasn’t hot in the room. His heart was slamming into his ribs. This was not what relaxation felt like. He kept his eyes closed though. Cas spoke again, still close to Dean’s ear. “You wanted to ask me a question earlier.”
Michael came over and clapped Dean on the back. “Ya wanna go get a drink, celebrate our triumphant return?”
“He doesn't want this. He didn't even know I was coming here today.” Dean was pointing behind him with each sentence.
“You could've just told him you didn't want to work with him. You didn't have to tie yourself up to me.”
“Of course.” Cas moved to Dean’s side and walked with him toward the campus. He wasn’t sure what the point was. They’d established the night before that co-eds were way too young and unappealing. It made Cas settle on a different question though, one that had nothing to do with conquests. “Did you ever want to go to college?”
Cas took a tentative step from the ashes. He brushed at his chest, making a small streak through the ashes that covered him there. He was naked, but he did not feel concerned by that. He walked out of the yard toward a little path that ran along the lake, through the trees. He felt something drawing him that way. He tried to remember more, who he was, who Dean was beyond beautiful and his. He walked until he found a statue of a pirate and a building that smelled of deep fried everything.
Cas said, “It doesn’t look quite right.” Dean fixed it in the mirror. “You always were better at that than me.”
It had been months of touring before they hit New York on New Year's Eve. Dean was exhausted and so was everyone else. Sam and Ruby were curled up in the back of the bus, so heavy with sleep even the jolting of the bus stopping didn't wake them.
“He hates when I call him that, so I guess that's why I do it.” Crowley was still grinning; it was eerie. “I'll keep Bobby company while you boys get acquainted.” Crowley waved him out the door.
Each step was difficult, because Dean's mouth never left him. Somehow they were on the bed. Castiel was looking down at Dean, trying to figure out what to give, what to take. “What?” Cas asked.
By the time evening was descending upon them, Cas had covered the whole cemetery, even Dean’s half. Dean came to his side and walked with him back to the car. He walked close, letting his knuckles graze along the back of Cas’ hand.
A few minutes later and Sam was back inside. “There were footprints that ran back to a set of tire tracks about 300 yards off. Whoever it was is long gone now.”
“I could twist your arms, or someone else’s arms that you care about.” He smiled big and toothy. “I don’t want anything from you. I just want you to let me do what I do without interference.”
“He thinks I'll make the album if I'm tied to someone, to you. He knows I wouldn't want to screw you over.”
The silence settled on them like a weight meant to drag them down and deep. Dean moved in closer to him. Sometimes they could just be close and things would somehow get to a better place. Cas stepped back. He looked up at Dean and said, “So, Mary and Bobby?”
Dean committed to the room and came down to a crouch near them. The babies were still flexing and flailing a little on the floor. “What’re you doing with them?” Dean reached out and gave Ellie’s back a gentle rub.
The kiss ended. Dean’s eyes were still closed and he hovered like he wasn’t really awake, frozen almost in the midst of what he’d been doing. Cas cupped the side of his face. He pressed his forehead to Dean’s. “I can’t stay yet. I’m being selfish. This’ll hurt you too much when I have to go.” He stepped back. “I’m sorry Dean. It’s better you don’t remember this.” He kissed Dean’s forehead and a small glow of grace bloomed between them.
He made his escape then. The courtyard outside was nearly empty. There was an exit at the far end. Cas pulled out his phone and called his car.
When she returned to him, it wasn’t with a cure. She did offer up a comfort. “What do I do with this?” He held the paper in front of him with the words to a simple incantation.
“Not what I was going to say.” Dean stopped again though. Cas set a hand on his. Dean glanced around, a bit of panic tickling up his spine. Dean slipped his hand away from Cas. “I'm not,” Dean started again.
“Well, they did get a ton of sleep during the afternoon nap.” Dean pulled over and Cas got out. “I could sit between them and attempt entertainment.”
Jack seemed to immediately brighten. “Yeah.” He turned to his desk and pulled over a book. He handed it to Sam. “Open it to the page with the paper there.” Jack pointed at the little stub of paper that was wedged between the pages.
When he was finally deposited on the stage, Dean let his guitar go quiet. Kevin kept the song going with a soft drum beat, the heart of the song. Dean reached down, and Cas took his hand to get up. They retrieved Cas’ guitar next and, together played out there last twenty seconds of the song.
“Dean,” Castiel turned on his stool to really face him. “I don’t use her. You will. Seems a shame to not have her getting played. Take her when you go tonight.”
Cas followed the noise to its source. He pushed open the door to the gym to find Dean, shirtless, driving his fists into the punching bag. Cas just watched him a moment before moving into the room more fully. It was 3 am, and Dean should definitely be sleeping.
Uriel, Anna, and Luc found him afterwards at the hotel bar, drinking away the memories of the long morning that was now afternoon. “Don’t get drunk,” Anna said, pushing away the glass from him.
The distant missions that Cas flew were not to places that the pleasure trips and medical trips flew. In time maybe that too would change, but for now, seven to eight months of space travel was too much for most civilians. Cas may have flown numerous missions but even he had only done the trip to Calliope four times. Each trip held a special place in his heart, because the Calliope was the space station located near Mars, the planet that Cas hoped to call home in the future.
Cas waited for more. Dean didn’t move, didn’t say anything else, but it was like he was waiting for something. “You want me to go with you?”
It apparently wasn’t as neural as he thought, because Dean waggled his brows and said, “Someone's jealous.”
“Oh son, I’ve seen more parades than I could shake a stick at. I’ve seen ‘em all. I’m sure I can imagine what’s happening just fine.” He chuckled in a way that sounded like music, a rising stream of tones that fluttered away on the little breeze that coursed by them. He gave Dean’s shoulder a little pat and moved in a way that was meant to guide him back to the sidewalk.
“Maybe, I mean, it’s not like Sam and I really talked about what happened with them at the hotel. I passed out, and the next morning there was more going on between them than there had been the night before. Sam was,” Dean sighed, “gentle with her.”
“You hit your head pretty hard on the side window. I have bits and pieces of it in my head, but it feels more like a dream.” Sam suddenly looked back over his shoulder to the street that they had crossed and the parade.
“I’m always worried. It’s the one constant.” She looked away from Claire to the one empty wall. “I’m afraid of what I’m suppressing. I’m afraid that I know things that are buried deep. I’m afraid of what could happen to the people I care about.”
“Of course. Cas is laid out up in the house there because of it.” Sam looked at him like he was trying to read him.
. “Now Cassie, you're intimidating the boy. Let him in.” She reached past Castiel and beckoned Dean into the bus. “I'm Anna. Please come on in.”
“Like I said, he knew a lot of useful stuff. He was a colossal help back in the day.” And Dean was just grateful that Sam didn’t bring up the demon days so specifically this time. Sam continued, “When he called me this time, it was different.”
“You’re up.” Sam turned a little and gave Dean a smile. “Figured I’d cook up the bacon and eggs that Robert brought us the other day.
“I’ve fought angels. Killed a fair number of them too. I can take you.” His eyes glinted with something fierce. “You should take off your shirt. It’ll get in the way.” Dean moved out to the sparring mat and waited. Cas took off his shirt slowly and watched Dean right back. His chest was already showing signs of effort, though they were just standing there. He could hear Dean’s breathing hitch up as he tossed his shirt to the floor.
The video followed Sam as he circled the Impala’s right flank. Despite knowing that something would go wrong, Cas still felt anxiety building in his stomach over what he was about to see. He liked the younger Winchester, despite only having a few encounters with him. Cas had actually gotten to meet Sam nearly a year ago while Dean was on a rare mission without his brother. In addition to the positive impression that Sam gave him, Cas knew from those that he worked with that Sam had a reputation for both bravery and kindness.
Dean closed his hand around him. Cas bit back a noise that was almost a moan, almost a whimper. Dean wasn’t moving yet. Each choice he’d made up to this point was slow, methodical. He watched Cas, the way his mouth was open, and breathing was ragged.
“A light in the forest seems necessary.” She continued smiling, and delivered her spell with confidence. The ball of light that formed over their heads was bright and hot. The vampire had enough time to glance up but only for a moment. His body burst into ash.
The corner beckoned. Dean had crossed the room in three quick strides and let his hands drag over the rack of hanging clothes. “It’s been too long,” Dean practically whispered.
Dean looked down at his shoes. They'd gotten him close to Cas now. He kicked at some gravel a little. “He didn't misunderstand me. I'm just…” Dean really didn't know how to answer.
“Like I said, we need to take two cars.” Cas pointed over to the other side of the garage to an ugly old Buick. Dean actually groaned and walked over to it. He peered in the back window.
The women he'd kissed before had a softness that Castiel lacked. He was all hard lines and ridges that Dean wanted desperately to explore in greater detail.
“Oh, I didn’t show you the strangest part of all of this.” Cas reached up and clicked open a new tab. “You remember the spot Sam marked on the map for where we’re going?”
Dean felt encouraged. “You know, you’re right. He pulled another outfit from the rack. “Sit, I’ll give this one a go. And no getting up and peeking. Spoils things.”
Although he had set the friendship boundary, he was still human. This vision was testing his resolve. He decided that he should not go out there yet. He didn't have that much self-control. Dean eventually got himself onto the floaty and Cas thought that staring any longer would be weird.
Dean looked down at the hat with the Stampede Motel band and thought, well no. “Yeah.” He slid money across the counter though, since everyone was waiting. It was an ugly hat.
Dean was already plotting. People were already unloading their baggage, so Dean made his way into the hotel. Sam was at the counter and Ruby was next to him with her head resting on the counter. Michael was signing autographs and talking up fans. Dean strolled up to Sam’s side. The girl helping them was way too chipper for so early. “I’m a huge fan of yours Mr. Winchester,” she was saying.
“I think he just might find me convenient. I mean, what other options does he really have out here?”
Next they were in Purgatory and Dean was sleeping for what must have been mere moments. He was leaned up against a tree, and Cas was next to him, awake. Dean watched as his body slid to the side and came to a rest against Cas’ shoulder. Then he slid more and was laying on Cas’ lap. Cas just stroked gentle fingers through his hair, whispering something over him.
She painted a little picture for him with her thoughts. Cas moved into Dean’s lap. “You’re never the third wheel.” Not the most romantic thing he’d ever said, but it seemed to move Dean.
This was not a hook-up. I did a lot of pacing to talk myself down. There was also the very real possibility that this was not a date in the strictest sense. However, the more I thought about it, the more I recalled the heat of him whispering at my ear, the more I believed that this was a very real date, and Cas was very interested.
“A vampire came to you last night, seeking an angel.” The woman spoke in a soft monotone. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun. Her dress was blue and made of very high quality materials. Rowena envied her for that much. Her own dress was made of rough fabrics that wouldn’t be ruined by kneeling in the woods.
Dean let his head fall to his chest. He let out a little gasp of a laugh. “This,” he waved his free hand up in the space between them, “this is why I love you.”
“Rowena isn’t your run of the mill human. If Lucifer couldn’t kill her, I don’t think there’s a thing in the world that could.”
Cas dropped the shirt he was folding into the bag in a heap. Dean looked down at the bag. It was a mess. It was half full of unfolded clothes.
He kept trying not to think, not to let his mind fall into the abyss. Everything felt muddy and a little dangerous. He drove to escape. Staying was dangerous. He immediately regretted his decision. He gripped the steering wheel harder and thought that he could crush it if he really wanted to. He took a deep breath and made himself concentrate on all that was present in the moment. This was necessary. This would make everything right again.
“True, but this way I really could be doing something new. I wouldn't have to lie to him.” Dean felt some relief saying it all.
“He is though,” Sam said. “Or at least some of the times. He swings both ways.” Sam stretched and let the bones in his back pop. The bus started rolling out. “Ruby, don’t hog the bottle,” Sam called over to the dark haired bass guitarist in the back.
“The position we’re in right now, I’m pretty sure I’m stuck here.” Dean tried to laugh, but Cas was too heavy on his chest.
Rebekah reached out to him, her eyes sad and said, "Goodbye, Sam." Her hand held his for a small moment before she released him.
In the late morning, Dean cracked open his eyes. Cas was still there next to him, sleeping peacefully. Dean wondered if he could convince him to have another go. He rolled over and picked up his phone from off the nightstand. Several messages, but that was nothing new. He opened them up. Sam was at the top.
Dean set aside his coffee and started fishing out his guitar. Castiel watched him. He was still toned and gorgeous. He bent to get a pick from the case. Castiel drank in the show that Dean didn’t even know he was giving.
And if one were lucky or unlucky enough to be noticed, one might be invited to join the party that was continuously going on up in the penthouse. Day or night, spring, summer, fall, or winter, the revelers would dance and drink and celebrate literally anything. It was to one of these parties that a woman with chestnut brown hair found herself happily dancing away one late spring night. And it was this woman that captivated a man that typically avoided being captivated by anyone, unless he was telling the story, which he was not.
“It’s more than stashing all that away. It’s the drawers and the plugs and the sharp corners too. We might need to get some baby gates to keep them out of dangerous spaces.” Dean was trying to imagine where they could freely roam and be safe.
“Yeah. She's kinda great like that. God knows why she likes me. Thank goodness I learned a little sign back in college. She puts up with me being horrible at it. I'm getting better though.”
It was a moment he looked back at from time to time. They were happy on their new adventure together. He loved them. They were family in that deep way that friends sometimes were.
Dean dipped his head and dragged his lips to the goal. When he took Cas in, it was enough to spark his brain to action again.
Kevin let out some sort of primal yell in response. The crowd went wild again. Dean started playing. The opening part of the song was lonely sounding, all slow with long held notes. Dean thought that it sounded like being on a desert island.
Cali Fest was huge, and getting offered the spot between Jo's Badass Band and Fallen was something that Dean couldn't seem to wrap his head around. Even as they stood outside their tour bus while their gear was being unloaded, Dean still said for the hundredth time, “Sammy, how?”
Dean opened his own bag and handed Cas a sandwich. “Sam said you weren’t hungry, but I brought you food anyway. Figured you don’t know what’s good for you.”
He wondered how much Cas would accomplish on the research front while they slept. And that wondering carried his mind into other thoughts that he knew he shouldn’t have while standing under the warm water of the shower. It had been a long day though. He raked his fingers up through his hair and soaped over his body. He could feel his muscles relaxing finally. He turned and let the water run down his back. He moved his left hand up to his right shoulder and let it settle there. It was easy enough to imagine a hug from behind that was accompanying that pressure there. It was easy enough to imagine that he wasn’t alone, and might never be alone.
Dean sat across from him on the bed and started taking off his shoes. “I enjoyed taking care of Sammy. I don’t know if I realized it at the time, but hindsight is clarifying on that a great deal.”
“You were not brooding or chicken shit. I don't buy it one bit. You were half naked, hanging out the doorway to your bus.”
“Briefly. They make better friends.” Dean considered Bobby and his vast array of contacts. So many of them ended up in his bed. Dean wondered if Castiel knew about Bobby and Crowley's on again off again connections. Since Crowley was Castiel's manger it seemed likely that he knew.
