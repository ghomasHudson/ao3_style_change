“I mean, I don’t swing that way, but I also ain’t sayin’ no or anything.  Don’t like to leave any leaf unturned, if you know what I mean.”
On the fly, Dean lied.  “Movies.  Gonna see that new horror flick— Been meaning to check it out.”  He knew she wouldn’t ask because she’d always hated horror movies.
Charlie scurried off, leaving Dean to listlessly gather his things, tossing them carelessly into his backpack.  In doing so, he managed to drop one of his course folders, causing a flurry of papers to scatter all over the floor and under the tables in the process.  On some sort of natural instinct, Castiel started forward to help Dean collect them off the floor, grabbing a few that crash-landed closest to the podium.  Castiel straightened them out in his hands, what looked like Algebra coursework, and he hesitantly stepped forward to hand them back to Dean.  Though, in some unforeseen turn of events, one of the other students kneeled down to help as well.  He seemed to be hanging back to speak to Dean just like Castiel.
“Yeah, maybe,” he shrugged, leaning back in his chair.  “Anyway, you guys free right now?  Kind of bored and could use a distraction…”
The ghost of insecurity danced across Castiel’s features so swiftly Dean almost thought he’d imagined it, but he refrained from answering the question and Dean’s stomach tied itself in a knot.
Dean groaned and deposited his gym bag onto his bed.  Grabbing hold of the hem of his sweat-drenched t-shirt, he hoisted it over his head, balling it up, and tossed the thing over his shoulder.  It landed squarely in the center of Castiel’s face before lifelessly dropping to the floor with a splat.
“I realize that now.  I should have.  But I assure you, Dean, I’m not judging you for the panties. I actually, um,” he paused, trying to find the right word, “I actually think it’s hot.”
“Huh.”  Rolling his eyes, Dean turns back to the pantry shelves to pretend to search for something to eat.  All things aside, there’s nothing good on the shelves, but he still shuffles some cans around to look preoccupied.  “He didn’t think it required all hands on deck?”
“Is anyone going to finish the rest of the chili?” asks Jack, rising from the table with a bright smile and Dean just rolls his eyes.
“Surprised by your intellect?  Not at all.  You’re a very intelligent student, Dean.”  When it looked like Dean was about to object, he pressed on: “What I am surprised by is the fact you didn’t make use of your extension.  I don’t give those out so easily, as I’m sure you’re aware.”
“Fuck!  What the hell, Cas!” Dean blustered, righting himself and tearing his hand out of his pants.  In a flash, he stashed the porn under his pillow before Castiel could catch a glimpse and his face turned a deep shade of scarlet, but instead of the anticipated anger, he was more embarrassed than anything.  “Don’t you know what a friggin’ sock on the door means?”
Nonetheless, Castiel complied.  He sunk his grip instead into the faux leather of the sofa back, knuckles turning white in defiance.  No touching.  The golden rule.
“Oh, yeah, for sure!  I’ve only been here once before when I was a kid.  I’m thinking about bringing my girlfriend, Dorothy, back here soon too.  She’s never been.”
Confused, he asked, “Since when was this a date?”  Sam and Jess gave him a look that just highlighted how much of a doofus he felt like.  One that said he’d been set up before he even got off the couch earlier.  “This wasn’t really about the art show was it?”
When Castiel didn’t dignify it with a response, Dean pressed the tip ever so slightly into his throat.  Hardly a scratch, but Castiel’s reaction proved his bluff.  “Go on,” Castiel hoarsely demanded, once he allowed himself to breathe.  Eyes well past the verge of tears, though his face clung to stoicism.
It takes a couple rounds of them metaphorically rolling snake eyes and having to exchange letters before someone adds another word. One of the pitfalls of playing this game is that it's a buttload more challenging than regular Scrabble, but at least Dean finds it interesting and can't say he doesn't know any of the words. Thanks, Pornhub. Speaking of butt loads, the next person to throw down is Cas. ‘SEMEN’ on a triple word score. “Son of a bitch.”
As it stood, it seemed Balthazar had not only been telling the truth, he also seemed to be going out of his way to avoid Castiel altogether.  Only once in the basement bathroom did they actually run into each other, but upon Castiel giving a curt acknowledgment beside him at the urinals, Balthazar snubbed him just as rudely, if not far too childishly.
Mindlessly, he leaned into the warm body next to him and let out an uncontrollable hiccup.  “Can I tell you something, Dean?  I’ve had the
They hardly ever fought either, save for on what to watch on TV together or what to make for dinner, or those pesky times where Dean forgot to clean up his pubes or put the toilet seat down, but Dean hadn’t done that in weeks— not since the last time when Cas fell in trying to take a quick piss and Dean thought he’d never hear the end of it.  So that’s why, when Dean comes through the door to their apartment later that night with a steaming bag of food from Cas’ favorite Thai restaurant down the street, he thinks it might be enough to ebb whatever current frustrations caused Cas to send that godforsaken text in the first place.
“Want you inside me,” he prayed aloud, voice coming out hoarse, but it was enough for Castiel to groan deep and pull him in for another kiss.  A desperate one with their groins colluding in the middle, delivering all the added promise of each one before it.  His strong hands came around again to grope and paw at Dean’s ass over his shorts.  The feeling caught fire, but before Dean let it spread, he was breaking the kiss again and resting his forehead against Castiel’s, breathing steadying breaths.  “Not here,” Dean said with a thick swallow and Castiel slowed his hands at the sound, bringing them around to rest over Dean’s ribs while he mouthed a kiss against the corner of Dean’s parted wet lips.
Dean faltered.  He knew that voice all too well by now, but he’d never heard it shape that word and the sound of it, the deep, gravelled pitch of it, felt like an electrical surge tumbling down his spine.  Surely, he would have remembered that feeling before.
“Dean, honey, could you get that?” his mother Mary called from the kitchen.  Distantly his father echoed the sentiment from the garage in a far harsher tone.
“Yeah, yeah,” he said, brushing off the sentiment.  He didn’t need looking after, he’d been looking out for himself and Sam his entire life.  He was still annoyed, but he appreciated Benny’s concern even if he didn’t appreciate the rest.
Ever the charmer, Dean grumbles, “Yeah, what,” like he's halfway to dead.  Cas shakes the thought.  It's not funny.  They don't know what's wrong with him yet.  But it does make him question why he feels compelled to bring the man coffee in bed when he's got two functioning legs.
It really never occurred to him over the years just exactly how much Sam understood about their family dynamic or how much inner-turmoil Dean felt nearly every moment of every day being in that house.  It was sobering to be seen that way, to say the least.  To be seen at all.
Rising to his knees, Dean snarled, “I am not the devil!  The devil fears me!”  Another splash of holy water and Dean was jerking the cuffs binding his wrists, the rusty water pipe rattling with it.
Reluctantly, Castiel pinned himself against the wall and attempted to use the laptop to obscure himself further.  Dean made himself comfortable almost immediately, snuggling himself deeper under the comforter.  Turning himself on his side to face Castiel, Dean grinned, and there was a moment, however brief and intangible, that their eyes locked together, Dean’s curious and open, Castiel’s nervous and wide.
The wait for the train took nine minutes and thirteen seconds.  He counted each one because every cell in his body was aching to be anywhere else and pretend none of this ever happened.
“An incubus?  There’s no such thing,” he retorts automatically, but Cas’ stern expression makes him question his own intelligence.
The corner of his mouth twitched into a smile at the car’s endearment and any adjoining implications.  He nodded slowly.  “In that case, I’d love to.”
Aside from the light illuminating the porch, Lisa’s house was dark.  It was getting late, minutes pushing closer to curfew the longer he dawdled out there.  What was he putting off?
Dean wasn’t about to let that happen though, so he was quick to dissuade that line of thinking.  Even if he really did hate shellfish.  “No, no,” he said, plucking a half shell between his fingers.  It was grey and slimy and even up close it resembled a hooker with the clap, but Dean smiled at Cas reassuringly before he mustered up the courage to slurp it back.
Dean sat anxiously bouncing his knees and gnawing at a hangnail as Bobby took a seat on the other end of the sofa and started watching the TV.  He always got anxious when Bobby came over for dinner just because he knew his Dad would ask in depth about his schoolwork and the playing schedule, and just generally about all the things Dean wanted to forget about.  And he really didn't want to rehash his win from last night again either; they’d done that enough over breakfast.
“I will show the slide for approximately one minute each and you will identify the piece with the information listed underneath the corresponding number.  It might not seem like it, but one minute should be sufficient.  If you miss one, save it until the last slide and I will go back as necessary.
Dean all but yelped at the feeling of a flat, wet tongue lapping over his hole.  Slow, wet circles.  It felt weird and in the back of his mind, he hoped he cleaned himself well enough, but after a few more laps he forgot to care and then he was practically shaking for more.  Teasing his tongue over Dean’s rim, Castiel worked the tip in.
Castiel laid into his throat with all his force.  “You were never my cross to bear!”  Taking the cross between his fingers, he pressed it against Dean’s chest and Dean shrieked.  “Cast him out, Dean!”
“Yes,” Cas manages awkwardly, “Yes, exactly.  Let me help.”  He reaches for the mugs, handing Dean the first one he lays his fingers on.  It’s a regular, old mug.  No chip to be found.
He should probably be bothered by that, but in the moment, for some reason, he was flattered more than anything else.  “Is that how you got in last time?”
All the houses looked relatively the same, including Dean’s, save for the freshly trimmed rose bush hedging along the fence, clinging to stay alive in the cold.  Lisa had told him once about her gardening over dinner.  He’d added the appropriate “Mhm’s” and nods and asked questions just to fill the gaps and to avoid staring across the table.
The admission made Castiel feel weak at the knees and Dean’s eyes fluttered closed out of some vague sense of self-preservation.  He brought his hand up to Castiel’s to keep it pressed to the side of his face and softly kissed his wrist.  Knocking their foreheads together, he quietly asked,  “What were they like?”
“So it would seem.” He inserts the card into the slot and they’re given the green light. “For my sake, I hope you don’t,” he murmurs to himself.
“Oh, I think I know some of those! At least, the ones Dean says,” proclaims Jack, eagerly clinging to the edge of his seat.
Suddenly the warmth of a rough hand slid over the back of his thigh, fingers skirting the underside of his ass while he was dancing, startling a gasp out of the back of Dean’s throat.  “No touching,” he reminded, as delicately as possible, though he could tell this wasn’t the man’s first time doing this.  He kept dancing for a short while until the customer demanded he get on his lap.  Tossing a knee over the man’s thighs, Dean lowered himself down, desperately disguising his unease by avoiding eye contact.  The scent of straight whiskey was coating the air on every heated exhale.  Dean swiveled and circled his hips around in this man’s lap, focusing all his energy on just moving to the beat, but he could tell the man beneath him was getting frustrated that Dean wasn’t as into it as he should be.
“Sure I can.  I’m sure all you artsy types have heard of Georgia O’Keeffe, right?  Are you going to stand there and tell me she isn’t known for painting persqueeter?”
Castiel stared at it for a long moment like it was a trap, before taking it into his own.  It was warm and slightly calloused, maybe a little damp from the condensation on his beer, but nothing like the sweaty palms of the witch that dragged him upstairs earlier.  He found he liked this one more than he reasonably should.  For a frat bro, anyway.
“Yeah, whatever.”  Whether he wanted to or not, Dean couldn’t bite back the shy smile that grew on his face.  “You’re not so bad to look at either, I guess.”
He didn’t remember leaving the door unlocked, but knowing himself he probably had.  “Why were you in my office in the first place?”  Maybe it was just fortuitous.  The universe offering up an apology to him.  This was what he had intended to do all week anyway, wasn’t it?
Dean pretended to mull the question over for a second.  “Yeah, probably,” he said with a laugh.  “But do I want to?  Probably not.”
He shut the car off then and got out. The door closed with its tell-tale rusted hinges and the sound eased him.  Coming upon the rail, Dean allowed himself to simply be present in the quiet moment.  Nature wasn’t something he often found time to appreciate on Earth. He couldn’t help but think maybe camping for camping’s sake would’ve been fun at least once.  Him, Sam, Jack, and—
“Gotta warn you, though... Dad’s gonna force me to join football, I know it. It's all he talks about. So as long as you can put up with that, and as long as you come be my cheerleader, I think we’re gonna be just fine.”
A disheveled man emerged from one of the rooms with an overly pleased expression on his face.  Castiel wanted to be that man right about now.  He watched him float by on cloud nine until the bouncer announced it actually was Castiel’s turn, but he was at a different door at the end of the hall.  That was for the best; a sober Castiel would have questioned the sanitary conditions of this whole event.  The bouncer gave him a thorough run down of the rules for getting a lapdance.  Castiel didn't know there were so many and his brain struggled to memorize the list.  The main emphasis on the fact he wasn't allowed to touch the dancer.  He could handle that.  If he remembered one rule, it should probably have been that one.  Before he wrapped his head around the rest, he was being corralled into the dimly lit room.
“Professor Novak,” Dean returned, paper clutched in his hands with a self-satisfied grin tugging his lips.  When his smile wasn’t met with one in return, it slipped.  “You seem like you’re a little on edge this week.  Somethin’ wrong?”
Dumping the contents of his failed scavenger hunt into a large saucepan, Dean lets it simmer as he cracks open a bottle of cold beer, letting the condensation settle between his fingers and in a ring on the metal countertop.  He idly twists the bottle with one hand while occasionally stirring the pot with the other.  He notes tonight’s dinner smells eerily reminiscent of exactly what it really is: Shit.  But there isn't much he can do about it right now, and he hates to think Sam’s clean eating habits are having any effects whatsoever on his taste buds.  Fuck vegetables.
After his third attempt to focus on his homework failed, Castiel leaned back in his desk chair and groaned.
Dean had never showered with anyone else before.  He kind of thought it would be like it was in the movies or like in porn.  Just two people covered in soap and shit going at it, but it wasn’t like that.  It was nice, if not a little cramped.
He let out a pleased sound.  “I could possess you instead, or I could lie in wait.  I’m not particular on the details, but my way you at least get to fuck it out,” he offered, as if it were a simple business negotiation.
The remainder of the class dropped theirs too, each one passing with an interesting array of facial expressions to match; those were always a good indicator of what was in store for him when it came to grading them over the weekend.
I wanted you all to get a better idea of where the characters are at, so I decided to post chapter 2.  What can I say I’m impatient lol.
From the security of his blanket, Castiel peered over at him.  His jeans were slung low at the waist, t-shirt inside out, and his carefully sculpted hair from the night before was now suggestively askew.  Deep purple marks littered his neck and dipped below the hem of his shirt.  He was utterly debauched in all sense of the word and something in Castiel silently churned.
“I don’t have a rabbit.”  Cas frowns, tilts his head, and Dean has to stop himself from laughing into the mouth of his beer. “What was wrong with her eyes?”
Charlie was writing her paper on Michelangelo’s sketch of Cleopatra they’d seen at the museum, though she was struggling to find a comparison piece. A simple portrait bust sketched of the figure Cleopatra looking over her shoulder while a serpent twisted its way around her neck, sinking its fangs into the flesh of her breast.  It was a double-sided drawing.  The completed version on the front, while a gnarled, monstrous version existed on the back, so Charlie claimed from her research.  A true depiction of both the ‘sacred’ and ‘profane’.  When Dean questioned why she’d chosen it, she simply replied, “Because of the boob, duh,” and Dean couldn’t really fault her.
“In the boiler room?  Yes, of course, but it was empty aside from the boiler and the water tank and some old, copper piping.  Why?  You don’t think…” Cas trails off, furrowing his brows.
“Dean,” he says, tone hushed, “I think it would mean a lot to Jack if we all did something together.” He looks pained. Like he's just saying it because it's the right thing to do. And it might be, but Dean could think of at least two other things he would rather do tonight, both of which uncoincidentally involve Cas, but he doesn't need to know that.
It only took a moment to steel himself, then he was climbing out of the Impala and rounding on the backseat.  He opened the door and the whine of the rusted hinges distantly stirred a dog back to life.
The first thought Dean had was how the fuck could they just let him do this to himself?  But in reality he knew Castiel was like a force of nature.  Controlling him was like trying to catch a goddamn hurricane with a butterfly net; Next to impossible and stupid to even try.  Nobody let Castiel do anything, he just did them and reaped the consequences later.   Yet here Dean was still trying to wake him up as someone unexpectedly dropped a pile of towels next to him on the cement.
“Sam, there’s always tomorrow.  I think it would be best to let Dean rest tonight,” Cas says.  His words are commanding, but when his eyes meet Dean’s they’re still rife with concern.  “I’m sure after that, Dean will be ready to discuss the case…”  His words linger between them as he glances back to Dean, air growing heavy with implication.  And of course, Dean is picking up what Cas is putting down.  He’s not stupid.  But Dean would be pretty satisfied never to discuss any of this again.  If only life were that easy.
The only reason Dean had made Cas play this game with him in the past was because it was a surefire way for him to win. Okay, maybe there was another reason too. Namely, just for an excuse to make Cas say dirty words, but who could blame him? His voice is practically made for that and it's not like Cas connected the dots anyway. And yeah, maybe Dean had taught him all the dick-centric words for reasons, but had Dean known Cas was actually taking pointers and improving his game skills in the process, Dean never would have agreed to play this at all. Afterall, Sam was still half right in his assessment. Dean is an enormously sore loser.
“What!  Why?  Everyone forgets the first by the end of the night.  You know doin’ the solos gets me more dances.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, I-” started Castiel.  With a thick swallow, he hazarded a glance in Dean’s direction.  “I didn’t mean to-”
She was practically pouting.  “Fine, but one of these days I'm going to get you to have fun.  You're too young to be a workaholic.”
Michael raised his open palms in pathetic defense and Castiel’s free hand automatically went searching for the pocketknife he kept tucked away in his boot.  Just as the blade snapped out and tickled under Michael’s chin, it was out of his grip, skittering away down the hall, and Castiel was being roughly dragged to his feet, boots screeching across the floor.  He met the lockers again in a daze, a strong forearm pressed into his throat as Michael scrambled to his feet with legitimate fear in his eyes.
Looking between the path to freedom and the spot next to Dean, he couldn’t argue with the notion it was his fault.  In the moment, though, he wasn’t sure why that affected his decision to sit back down.  With a strenuous eye roll, he sank into the seat beside Dean with a dramatic huff and kicked his feet up onto the lab table, carefully balancing in his chair.
He ate his food in silence and shouldered his ‘girlfriend’s’ meager attempts at conversation. Frustrated, he was struggling to tear into a carton of 2% milk, when he sensed eyes on him from the other side of the cafeteria.
Eventually Dean finds his way into the kitchen following the scent of another pot of coffee brewing.  He doesn’t trust Cas to make the food.  Cas never blames him.  His head is still foggy as he digs around looking for something to eat for breakfast? Lunch?
Dean sucked in a deep breath through his nose just to shut him up, but then Castiel was pushing back in and it came tumbling out of his mouth.  A punched out sound, something akin to a moan, at the feeling of being filled.  And it still burned.  Fuck, did it ever.  And it still felt alien inside of him, but after a few carefully measured thrusts, Dean grew used to the feeling and the burning stretch of his hole started to feel almost good.
Absently, Castiel hummed and shuffled to get comfortable again. “It’s weird,” he finally admitted after a beat.
Carelessly dropping his things onto the nearest stack of books, he crossed the room like a spooked animal.  It wasn't as if he had any doubts as to who it was from, rather the tangible confirmation that at the very least he wasn't insane.  Removing the apple, he unfolded the small scrap of paper and skimmed over the black ink scratched into its surface.  It was only five words.  Five words, but Castel could hear the drawl of the person that wrote them rattling around his head clear as day.
"You know me?  Enlighten me then," Cas mocked as Dean had asked him to do last week.  It hadn’t gone over so well then and it wasn’t now either.
“Dinner was lovely, Dean,” Castiel said in a fit of nerves.  Something he’d already said twice before they left the house.  Just something to fill the empty space in the vain chance God was still listening to him anymore.
“Yes.  I remember because up until that point, I spent much of the evening being incredibly jealous you weren’t there as my date.”
Fondly, Cas shakes his head and chuckles to himself as he does the same at a normal, unflappable pace. His blue hibiscus patterned shirt hangs loosely, unbuttoned down the front, showing off the new tan he got that day accentuated by the bright ley still hung around his neck and Dean finds himself distracted by the strip of skin as he trips over his own feet.
She emphasized the word as though it weren’t within the realm of possibility that Castiel had anything better to do with his time than lounge around on their second-hand sofa and fuck himself up.  He didn’t, but it was the principle of the thing.  And on any other day, hell maybe even last week, he would’ve done it too.  Stuck himself with something or sniffed dust or smoked whatever was burning, but today was Monday.  It was a new week, and call him crazy, but he just really wasn’t looking to spend quality time with the two people that supposedly left him for dead. That same sense of dread was still lingering in the center of his chest.
“Castiel,” he murmured softly, jostling the damp leg of his jeans.  “You’re home, man.  Time to get up.”  The steady rise and fall of his chest as the breath tumbled over his lips was a comfort, but then Dean remembered why he was here at all.  “Cas—”
He managed to slip into third period English without issue.  Today was a double, and that was just his luck.  Apparently word around the hallways was that he’d died at Gallagher’s party, so when he walked into the classroom his presence was met with calculated awe and gravitas like the second coming of Jesus.  He slumped himself down in his usual back row seat, opened his tattered copy of Moby Dick, and took a well-deserved nap for the next hour or so as Ms. Hester droned about the nature of the allegory.
Distractedly, Castiel almost missed it when the light turned green, head still swimming in the clouds on his drive across town.  He was alerted by an obnoxious horn blaring from behind his old Cadillac, the only other one on the road at this hour.  “Yeah, I got it,” he irritably muttered aloud as he pressed his foot to the gas, shaking himself out of it.
He did not get one.  Dreams of heated, freckled skin and glitter danced across the backs of his eyelids.  Panted moans.  His new student asking him for a different kind of extension altogether.   All in all, this weekend was going the exact opposite of good, but he supposed Dean knew that would happen when the words left his mouth.  The little shit.
Blearily, Dean gave an acknowledging grunt through another sneeze and watched Castiel disappear down the hall.  Sam, who’d been radio silent, stood beside him and slowly catalogued the cluttered apartment.  He cleared his throat and caught Dean’s attention from where it had been rapt.
“I won’t listen to you!”  He carried on with the exorcism and the darkness behind Dean’s eyes grew desperate.
“He was asking for you again,” Sam said eventually, as he turned onto a narrow side road.  “Demanding, really.”
Not knowing how to rectify the situation or when Dean would return to the dorm room, Castiel decided that maybe a nice gesture would put him in Dean’s good graces for whatever stupid things he’d said or done while under the influence, so he set about trying to clean their shared space.
Castiel shot Dean a withering glare.  “I have a sex life.  I just don’t broadcast it to the world like you do.”
She stood with her hands clasped together, clearly awaiting a response, but Castiel wasn't sure what to say.  He wasn't expecting her to be delivering a backhanded compliment in person, much less to himself.  Realizing he was just staring blankly at her, he cleared his throat and began, “Thank you, it's no trouble at all actually.  I rather enjoy being able to teach both.  They're not so different subjects, really, since both are focused on depictions of the human form.”
Castiel gave a slight nod and a hum.  “Of course,” he said.  He wasn’t going to win this one anyway.
Just then the walk sign turned and Dean started scrambling to get away, but looking back he honestly felt bad for the dude.  He hesitated in his tracks.  “Hey... you wanna wash that coat, man?  I’ll spot you the change,” he said, shaking the bag of quarters in his pocket.  It was literally the least he could do.
Four texts from Charlie.  The first of which was his name dragged out unnecessarily long.  The second, an ‘I miss you’.  The third demanded Dean leave work immediately and come hang out.  And the fourth confirmed that Charlie was most definitely drunk by way of a shakily snapped photo of her and Dorothy clinging to each other with too-big grins.
Drugs were funny like that, he supposed.  And when sleep finally did come, it really didn’t make him feel any better.
Assessing the cage in his tacky palm, Dean weighed it for a few moments longer before he begrudgingly conceded and slipped himself back into it. One by one, the pins and the lock clicked into place like an old, familiar friend. It was the second time he’d been forced into it this week, afterall, and Cas was capable of exerting so much more control over him than he currently was; than he really deserved, and the thought alone made him feel that much weaker to him because even still he had the overwhelming urge to be good for him despite being rendered useless.
“Nothing,” he said dismissively, despite the fact he swayed a little getting off the train.  “Not that it’s any of your concern.”  He was nowhere close to as far gone as he’d been last time.
It was something, but it wasn’t the right something.  Definitely not the route Castiel wanted to take any further conversation.  But Castiel remembered enough.  He’d woken up the next morning spread eagle on his living room floor.  Face flush against the wood grain, the starched sensation of dried, flaking semen coating both sides of his jeans.  If 2 plus 2 still equalled 4, he could figure out the math.  He hadn’t even been surprised that Balthazar left him on the floor instead of the couch.  It wasn’t hard to guess what happened.  And even in the afterglow, smelling like someone else’s cum and waking up still intoxicated, Castiel had felt better that morning than he had in a long time.  An otherworldly orgasm achieved by some anonymous, divine creature he would have probably never seen again if it weren’t for Fate tampering with the universe.  But here Dean was, sat beside him on a museum bench, ever in his orbit these last few weeks, and very much of this world.  Every instinct in him wanted to get this part over with.  A full admission of guilt.  A spiritual cleansing.  He could leave this room rejuvenated once and for all.  They both could.  But life couldn’t be that simple and Castiel’s mouth was working faster than his brain.
Dean follows him in with a palm splayed on the small of Cas’ back. He flips on the switch by the door, but when the light comes on he has to take it all in one more time.
What did he even want to say here?  ‘Thank you for the sex, see you next Tuesday’?  ‘Sorry I’m a constant disappointment’?  ‘You’re beautiful when you sleep’?  He started to write something, but he ended up scribbling it out just as quickly.  Maybe not mentioning anything they’d done would be a better route to take, but he had to say something.  He couldn’t just fuck and flee like a coward, though that was exactly what his lizard brain was telling him to do.
Dean released a breath like he was releasing trapped steam and ran his fingers through his hair.  “Yeah, it was a customer.”
“Where, the treehouse?” Dean joked, but Castiel looked uncharacteristically serious. The way he only got when they were alone and something was really eating at him.
“Yeah, well that makes one of us,” he muttered under his breath, swinging the door open.  In his haste to escape, he came crashing into a solid body waiting just on the other side of the door and the air rushed out of his lungs not for the first time this afternoon.
“Listen, Cas…”  When Jo walked back to the bar, Dean turned to him then.  “Here’s the thing you need to know about the Roadhouse,” he said under his breath.  “The food here is awful and that’s coming from me.  I’ve eaten literal garbage better than this place.”  Sam and Jess laughed from the other side of the booth, but really couldn’t disagree.  “There’s only two good things on the menu here and that’s booze and grease.  You got that?”
After the second dance, Dean collected his things and changed back into his wrinkled street clothes.  He’d counted his cash.  It wasn’t as much as usual due to the fact the first asshole didn’t tip, but it was enough to send some to Sam at least, and that was one the top of Dean’s list of priorities.  He headed up the stairs, cash now securely in his wallet, and left out the rear exit leading to the alley way.
Last thing he needed was to try to be set up with some artist chick Jess knew.  Artist’s were practically known for being batshit crazy.  The good ones anyway.
Castiel vaguely registered the man at the end of the hall as someone he’d seen before.  He was seated in a low back chair with his feet kicked up on a stool, eyes poring over the contents of a fetishistic pornography magazine.
“They’ll smell it on me,” he reasoned, ditching the t-shirt in the corner. “It’s fucking cold up here though. Can I borrow your sweatshirt?”
Sure enough, he was wearing a thong.  A black lace thong to be precise.  But he was only wearing it to get used to the feeling since he had to wear them at work so much.  Definitely not because he liked how it looked and definitely not because he liked being looked at in them.
“I- I puked on you,” he slurred, water dripping down his chin, as he leveled the gross stain smeared down Dean’s shirt.
There’s tension here and Dean doesn’t know how to cut it, so he simply offers, “Wanna help me make dinner?” and it seems to work infinitesimally.
The air had more of a cold nip this late into the night and Castiel drew his jacket tighter around himself.  Sure enough, Balthazar was seated on the edge of the curb, mindlessly scrolling through his phone.  Taking those few steps forward, Castiel lowered himself ungracefully onto the curb, letting out an amused huff.  “So, what happened?”  Balthazar gave a vague acknowledgment to the glow Castiel could feel himself radiating.  It was either that or the smell of sex he was now exuding in abundance.  Castiel was high as a kite and he was feeling amazing right about then, the only thing better would be wrapping himself in clean sheets.
Signing the cross over his chest, Castiel sprinkled the holy water as he watched Dean squirm.  “Why Dean?”
“He go out again last night?”  Dean asked, voice instantly filling with concern despite trying to dampen it.
Castiel may as well have facepalmed then and there.  He couldn’t believe he’d forgotten, but then again, he’d had more insistent things on his mind these last few days, even if he didn’t entertain them.
Dean was checked out of the conversation, absently lost in thought about sparklers and car accidents among other long repressed things, but he nodded along to her anyway, making the appropriate noises, and taking the last dish to stack on the drying rack.  “I’m, uh, I'm gonna head out soon,” he said, once he finally registered she’d stopped talking.
I had the time to squeeze out the next chapter and I'm too impatient to wait around to post it, so I hope you like it!  I'm working on some art to go with this too. xo
A corner of Cas’ mouth lifts, almost amused were it not for the concern bleeding into his eyes.  “Yes, I know very well.”  After a few beats, Cas closes the book with a dusty clap and leans back into his chair, bringing a hand up to rest his chin on.  His eyes meet Sam's again across the table and they exchange the same look.  “Just give him some time, he’ll come around.  He just needs rest.”
When the hammering didn’t stop, he knocked three more times.  “Mrs. Birdell,” he called out, voice still rough with sleep.  “Moira!”
“Maybe I can eat it later,” Castiel said, taking the bag.  “Thank you, though.”  He knew Dean was upset he just didn’t know why.  He’d expected this, he just never quite figured out what to say yet, but before he said anything Dean sighed.  “Dean, what’s wrong?”
Dean bit the inside of his cheek to stave of a grin of his own.  “What can I say, all part of my charm.”
Castiel sized him up where he sat and he seemed earnest enough, but it still didn’t sit right with him.  “Charlie’s a nice girl and I know your type, you don’t have a chance--”
Grabbing Cas by the front of his shirt, Dean hauled him to his feet and into a sloppy kiss, encouraging him to follow along as he walked them both towards the bedroom.  “C’mon, Cas,” he gasped between enthusiastic rolls of his tongue, “Let’s go test that theory of yours.”
Dean was sizing him up, hands in his pockets, and it did nothing to make Castiel not blush.  Suddenly, Dean’s arm playfully wrapped around his neck and his stomach fell to his feet.  “I bet you’re a fun drunk, Cas.”
If Dean didn’t know any better, he’d say the corners of Castiel’s lips were fighting back a smile.  “You’re awfully fresh for someone who was begging for it a moment ago.”  He lazily lifted the hand laying between them to pinch at Dean’s side.
Dean isn't going to let this impromptu game night get in the way of all of his plans. With his ratty, old sweatpants loosely in place, he kicks his legs up on the edge of the research table and reaches over for a slice of greasy as hell pizza; just the way he likes it. By accident, he opens the lid to the mystery pizza with the green bits on it. He hasn't got the faintest clue why Sam insists on trying to make even pizza seem healthy. On the other side of the table, Sam makes the same mistake with Dean’s pizza. They both grimace in disgust at each others choices. “Yo, swap with me, Samsquatch.” They slide the boxes to their respective sides of the table. “That one is for you guys to share. This beauty is all mine,” he says, rubbing his hands together before lifting the lid. Meat lover's. The only kind.
Castiel hadn’t seen Dean in weeks, though the last time he had, Dean was hostile in tone and belligerent in action.  Slinging wicked insults and attempting bodily harm.  A far cry, from the Dean he’d observed over the course of their Sunday dinners.  From the Dean he’d come to know in the dark.  But they were out of options now.
Dean scoffs, but he’s actually slightly amused.  “Sometimes I forget you got that upload.  Kinda miss when the joke flew over your head.”
“To warm up the pie,” Cas answered simply, not even bothering to wrap a towel around his waist.  “We’ll need our energy for round two,” he added with an obvious wink.
Balthazar just gave a flippant hand gesture as he reached for Castiel’s beer again.  “I didn’t like him,” was all Balthazar had the audacity to say.
Tugging on the constrictive seatbelt Cas had forced on him when they squeezed into this death trap, Dean grumbles, “Yeah, and what does this make me? Miss Daisy?”
“Probably.”  He got to his feet, extending a hand down to Castiel.  Castiel clasped it, hauling himself back up.  “Let's get you home, Cassie.”
“Cas!” The caller gasps urgently over the line before Cas can even speak. Cas pulls the phone away to look at the caller ID.  "I called three times already!"
Of course it was Winchester again, standing in his way of all places, ‘inconspicuously’ perusing the colorful fliers tacked on the bulletin board.
Blearily, he blinked over to his nightstand and groaned.  The time on his busted alarm clock read half past 8am.  He struggled to sit up, surveying the floor for his jeans, and pulled them closer once he located them, but of course his cell phone was dead.
“I’m going to Chemistry,” he declared abruptly, ignoring her and dumping his soggy remainders into the garbage bin.
“Yeah,” Dean whined, strangled with a moan, as Cas’ hand joined him on his dick.  “Wanna be good for you, Cas.  Make me come for you.”
“Nothing,” he lied and she accepted it for what it was.  She always accepted his lies for what they were.
“If you don't get out of this bed right this instant, I'm coming in with you.”  Castiel rolled his eyes, but after quick consideration he reluctantly pushed back the covers and pulled on some clothes.
That kind of anticlimactic meet-cute shouldn’t warrant a personally signed love letter, but Dean was conditioned to expect blunt force trauma for every fuck up he’d ever caused.  Sometimes even for the ones he hadn’t too.  At the time,“It’s not your fault” seemed like a novel concept in comparison.
Benny was back sitting on the couch again watching the latest episode of Game of Thrones on his phone when Dean stopped in front of him again, eyebrows pinching.  He cleared his uncomfortably dry throat and Benny paused his show, looking up in question.
As Dean made his way to the hors d'oeuvres table, he couldn’t really pick one conversation interesting enough to eavesdrop on for longer than a few seconds.   He found the table off in the far corner with its pristine, white tablecloth spread out with an array of cheeses and other more questionable items.  He stuffed his cheeks full to bursting with the stuff, grabbing more to peck at, and nabbed a glass of wine from one of the catering staff as they passed by.  He wasn’t a huge fan of red wine all things considered, but free is free, so he took a few inelegant gulps as he meandered towards a large collection of paintings haphazardly hung on the wall.
“As far as I knew, these demons were locked up in Hell, but Asmodeus must have taken care of that I presume.  Besides, there were more pressing distractions at the time,” he admits, almost abashed.
If you’d have asked Castiel a few days ago if Balthazar had been lying about the whole ‘not being friends’ ordeal, he might have given you a 50/50 wager that it was a bluff.
Castiel didn't really have a problem with aging, not like Balthazar at least, but he didn't fight the explanation because he needed to get on the other side of one of these doors.  Whichever one housed the man with the body sculpted from smooth marble.  An actual Adonis.  He could teach a lesson on that ass alone.
“It's not a big deal,” he insisted.  “And hey, speaking of being a guest, thanks for blowin’ my cover too.  Really had to make me look like a charity case in front of him, didn't you?”
Benny hummed in consideration.  “I should be askin’ you that question, more like.  The hell were you thinkin’?”
Ushering Castiel through the front door, Sam led him past the living room and down the hall towards the kitchen.  The basement door was just around the corner, but Sam made no move to go near it, instead angling himself against the edge of the formica countertop.
A beat passed where Castiel thought he was in the clear, but moments later Dean was closing his textbook with a heavy thud and turning so fast in his seat that if Castiel weren’t expecting it he might’ve just stabbed him.
“Yeah, I said it.  You ever hear of a little thing called ‘The Death of the Author’?  Barthes said it best, but really, it doesn’t matter what this is supposed to be about.  Arts for other people to interpret however they want.  So if I see a big ol’ massive dick, that’s what this painting is about.”
“Course not, but he doesn’t have to.  Who else is gonna pull in all the old perverts?  They’re the ones forking over the big bucks.  Besides, I’m the only one he’s got limber enough to shave behind their own friggin’ balls and what Crowley doesn’t know won’t hurt him.  If he hasn’t found out yet, he’s not going to, unless somebody tells him.  I doubt Ash would.  Nobody else was even payin’ attention.  That leaves you.  So, are you gonna tell him?”
“You’re hurt,” Castiel said, cutting him off mid-thought.  He gingerly took hold of Dean’s hand to inspect his wounded knuckles and, for whatever reason, Dean let him.
Dean laughed and clapped a firm hand on his shoulder.  “C’mon, Cas, it’s just what guys do.  It’s guy talk.”
,” Cas hissed, thrusting impossibly deeper. He slid a hand around Dean’s throat as he hung in wait, feeling the girth of him expanding Dean from the inside. “You feel so good, Dean. So—
Dean kissed like he was starving and Castiel was the thing he’d been craving for months.  His lips and tongue lingered when he came to the hem of Castiel’s jeans.  “God, Cas,” he rasped, coming up for a steadying breath, “I want to fuck you so bad right now.”
“What d’you mean?”  Dean hadn’t even given retirement any real thought other than taking a trip to the beach once the summer rolled around.  He never thought he’d get this far; he hadn’t exactly drafted up a five year plan or whatever.  But apparently Cas had something more immediate in mind.
Maybe Castiel wasn’t so different to any of those men as he had so desperately wanted to believe if that was the way Dean was perceiving him.  And at what point had Dean assumed Castiel was special?
.  I literally got in bed with you!  I’ve only been dropping hints six different ways from Sunday that I’m into you, Cas, and the only reason I said yes to Lisa in the first place was so I wouldn’t make a complete ass out of myself trying to get your attention because I didn’t want to mess up the good thing we had goin’ on, but I guess not even that worked because apparently I still acted like a goddamn idiot.
“Bite me,” he demanded with a shuddering groan while Aaron was sucking a wet mark in the hollow of his throat.
Dean’s fingertips pressed bruises into the skin of Castiel’s hip and shoulder as he began picking up an almost brutal pace.  On every third thrust, he hit Castiel’s prostate and punched a shout from his throat.
“Maybe what, Dean?” Sam egged, but Dean couldn’t bring himself to admit it out loud.  It sounded too pathetic in words.
Castiel bit back a moan at the feeling of Dean thrusting against his hand, hot and wanting, and he slid the hem of Dean’s slacks under his ass, letting his flushed erection bob free against his stomach like an offering.  With obvious desire, Castiel positioned himself over Dean’s hips and dipped his head to place open mouthed kisses down Dean’s stomach and over his hip bones as he squirmed underneath him, impatience only growing.  But Dean was spread out for him and the part of Castiel that was saying this was wrong was long gone now.  Without further preamble, he licked a long, wet stripe up the underside of Dean’s cock, all the way from the balls to the tip, letting his tongue flit under the head.  He could taste the precum beading at the tip.  A bitter, salty flavor that Castiel couldn’t seem to get enough of if he tried.
Dean placed open mouthed kisses all the way down his shaft, slow, deliberate sucks moving lower until he came to his balls.  Taking them into the warmth of his mouth, he mouthed them one at a time and hummed around them.  When he let them go, he smirked again at the way Castiel was fighting himself as he struggled to scan over the sheet of paper with what must have been a tortured look on his face.
This wig looked nothing like her real hair, his mind was practically screaming it, but he promised to act normal.  It was short and wavy and artificially blonde.  It sorely reminded him how much he used to like brushing her long hair for her when he was a kid, before his Dad told him he had to man up, and he supposed, maybe that was why she only asked him nowadays.  But he’d never tell her anything different, despite the fact she chose to shave it off.
Castiel nodded, even though Dean couldn’t really see him.  “And for how long have these thoughts been plaguing you?”
His body was shaking.  His plush lower lip trembled precariously between his teeth, trapping an indecent moan from tumbling out.  Flushed skin burning like fire under his palms against the cool grey sheets.   Castiel had spent longer than usual opening Dean tonight solely for the fact they had the time to do so.  He wanted to savor this for however long he had to wait until they could do it again.  To his surprise, Dean was much the same way; much like him in more ways than he’d initially cared to realize.
Looking over his shoulder, Sam waits until the man is out the door and walking back to his rusted out truck with the squeaky hinges, before he turns back to look at Jack.  He sighs.  “Jack, you can’t just go around saying things to people, not like that.  There’s a time and a place for some things, and sometimes people aren’t as friendly as you’d hope they’d be.  Especially not in the backwoods and especially not people like him,” he adds with a slight chuckle.  They really were in the middle of nowhere right now.
Everyone was still staring and Dean did his best to ignore their probing eyes.  He was clearly on something heavy, but fuck if Dean knew what.  He gestured for someone to pull up one of the stools and forced Castiel down into it.  He didn’t sit as much as collapse into it.
“Why would I--”  But Dean was gone before he finished the thought.  Castiel scoffed to the empty room; it wasn’t like he usually did.  Not on purpose, anyway.  He stared after the still-open doorway.  With an annoyed huff, he got to his feet, closed the door, and distractedly tripped his way back to his desk, wondering how many orgasms it might take for Dean to actually clean his side of the dorm.  He didn’t get very far with that thought.
Within moments, Dean was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.  He stood there frozen, taking in the sight of Cas; white shirt covered in blood; hair electrified; as smoke billowed from the saute pan on the stovetop.  To his benefit, there were only a few food splatters on the walls and the counters and it wasn’t like he couldn’t just mop the floors again, even though he could’ve sworn he just cleaned the place the other day.
“She might be, but her boobs are new,” Dean would always counter, because it honestly, truly didn’t matter to him one way or the other.  Good boobs were good boobs.
If Dean knew what was happening, he didn’t let it bother him.  He simply rolled his eyes again in fond exasperation, and said “Yeah, I did.  Don’t tell anyone, but sometimes I actually like you.  Sue me.”  He reached over and hit the play button in Castiel’s lap and it took all the willpower Castiel had left for him to keep his eyes trained on the screen.
Castiel peered over his shoulder in the mirror, noting his friend’s less than sober appearance.  “I guess I'm not surprised that you're already intoxicated,” he said, disapprovingly, “I don't think your v-neck is low enough either, Bal.”  He was surprised he couldn't see his friend’s navel given how much his shirt left to the imagination.  Suddenly, he felt over-dressed.
Errantly, Dean reached out a hand to flip the switch by the door and the lamp on the nightstand filled the room in a soft glow just before the backs of his knees hit the edge of the mattress.  He fell down onto the disheveled mess of blankets willingly.  Castiel wasn’t far behind, sprawling his body out on top of him as he leaned in for another wet, urgent kiss.  But there was a glaring issue here that Dean wanted remedied immediately.
Castiel rolled his eyes, and shrugged Balthazar off.  “I’m not,” Castiel assured him.  “This is my friend, Balthazar.”  He made sure to emphasize the word for everyone involved.  “Don’t mind him, he’s just an asshole.”
Cas looks… like something crawled up his ass and died there actually, but his attention is purposely directed at the early morning news broadcast instead of at Dean.  Something about the case.  The sheriff getting Sam’s tip off about the bodies.  Some badly delivered one liner in poor taste by the douchey news anchor man.  It's hard to hear through the occasional bouts of static, but it sounds like their work here is done at least.
Castiel steeled his expression.  “I would never.”  He was feeling mildly drunk.  It was easier to flirt like this, he supposed.  None of his usual hangups cloistering his personality away.
Standing from the table, backpack slung over his shoulder and keys to the Impala in hand, Dean cleared his throat.  “You comin’ or what?”
Dean was passing the Roadhouse now.  He paused outside the window.  The smell of greasy frying oil permeated the air as he scuffed his boots on the ground.  He was hungry after everything.  He was still high, after all.  But he talked himself out of going inside.  He thought of Ellen and her no nonsense policies and he shook his head despite no one asking him anything.  He wanted to go in, though.  Despite his coworkers being near strangers, he felt more at home here than he did anywhere else.  Maybe even ever.
Halfway through, Dean was being pestered by the nuisance seated to his left and it took most of his will power not to march across the front of the room and drag him away by his ear or something equally ridiculous.  He couldn’t hear what was being exchanged between them over his own incessant droning, but Aaron looked pathetically desperate.  Though in regards to Dean, Castiel figured he wasn’t much better off.
He saw Dean for thirty seconds on his way back from the cafeteria.  He was laughing with Charlie on the green again, but he didn’t see him pass.  Castiel didn’t dare approach him out in the open.  Dean was forbidden fruit here and he couldn’t risk what his body might do.
“The one with the old broad in the tub,” he said.  Like the clarification would suddenly make all the difference.
Setting his book aside, Cas fixed his sights on Sam, who was still seemingly engulfed in his own lore, until he felt the inerrant staring in his peripheral vision.  “Sam, can I ask you something?”
It couldn’t have taken more than a minute for Castiel to ascend the winding stairway up to the apartment.  Dean could hear his heavy footfalls echoing, growing closer.  It wasn’t enough time to panic about what they were about to do or to question himself because before the thought could even cross his mind there was a knock on the door.  A timid rapping of a knuckle against the wood.  Dean didn’t even bother disguising the fact he was waiting on the other side of it, reaching his hand out on autopilot to let him in.
“He came home drunk again,” Sam explained.  “I’m fine.  He destroyed a couple dishes, but I managed to stay out of the way.  I’m working on my homework now.  What are you doing?”
The chant caught fire all the way up to the nosebleeds and just in this moment, Dean allowed himself to get caught up in it.  He smiled up at his parents and his little brother Sam watching on from the bleachers and he waved to them with the scant energy still stored in his reserves.  They bumped fists with the players from Olathe South, customary congratulations, some not so friendly accusations made on either side, while others met up with people waiting in the wings.
Four corners. Six sides.  Eight feet of impacted earth and one layer of impenetrable iron separating him from the world.
Castiel gave him a mildly disapproving look over the top of his glasses, but it wasn’t as if he were one to talk.  By the looks of it, he hadn’t even pretended to get any shut eye.  “I know the feeling,” he conceded in lieu of the tutting Dean could tell he was holding back.  He sighed then too.  “Hopefully the couch wasn’t too uncomfortable for you.”
In no time at all, he was pulling up alongside the curb across the Castiel’s apartment building, engine stalling as much as he seemed to be.
He looked both ways and crossed the street, angling towards their little table under the overhang.  “Hey, guys,” he started with a huff, shoving his hands in his pockets,  “What’s good?”
“Fuck, Cas you’re so tight,” he gasped.  “Dunno how long I’m gonna last.  Feels so good.”  His nails dug half moons into the meat of Castiel’s thighs, indecisive in whether to keep him still for longer or to get him moving.
“I’m sorry… dead?”  An unnamable feeling surged through him at the news.  He wasn’t lucid enough for this conversation.
“This is getting no where,” Castiel heaved a worn out sigh, “I just think it would be best for everyone involved if we acted like this whole… unfortunate incident... never happened.  I am your professor, you are my student.  That is all.  I’m practically twice your age.  Nothing good would come from anyone finding out about this.  Especially not for myself.  Do you understand?”
When he looked up again, Damien was still seated in his lap, looking down at Castiel like he was the most bizarre yet intriguing thing he'd ever seen.  His eyes danced back and forth between Castiel’s, alight with something that Castiel couldn't place, but whatever it was made the confident man in his lap falter.
Michael ignored him. “Yo, Trailer Trash, sober the fuck up and get out of here!  Nobody invited you for a reason.  And Dean here’s just not that into you.”
The red glow of the exposed bulbs lining the brick wall offered out a warning, but Castiel didn’t want to take it this time.  Some part of him desperately wanted to construct this whole night as having never happened.  He was on a precipice, after all.  A precarious place where he could either cling to the edge of reason and back away or he could fling himself face first over that very same edge without any promise of safety awaiting him at rock bottom.
Dean showers longer than intended, but it’s not his fault really. He doesn’t know whether it’s the water pressure, the fact he’s on an honest to god vacation in Hawaii, or if it’s because he’s happier than he ever recalls being, but this is the best shower he’s ever taken in his life, bar none.
Collecting himself, Chuck turned back to flip his burger with the look of a man grasping at straws.  There wasn’t really that much to do and they both knew it.  Most of the college kids were out getting wasted not getting burgers and the rest of their usual clientele was sat at the bar bantering with Ellen about the Cowboys versus the Steelers on the big screen.
“An aphrodisiac. The Romans considered them particularly beneficial when it came to… increasing libido.”  Cas paused here, watching as Dean set down the yet another empty half shell.  He swallowed this one slowly, hoping beyond hope he was picking up what Cas was putting down here.
“That’s it, huh?  That what you’re doin’?  Tryin’ to turn my own son against me?  You think you could do a better job?”
Dean threw his head back again with a boisterous laugh and shoved at Castiel’s shoulder.  “You know what I mean.”
A feeling coiling in the pit of his stomach is telling him something is still wrong with Dean.  Something other than embarrassment or the usual emotional constipation they’re all so familiar with, but if Dean won't talk, Cas can't force him.  It still hurts.  This feeling.  Something akin to rejection, he supposes.  He's knows it well enough by now.
“Hi, Cas,” Anna said in some watery kind of way.  “It’s Anna...”  She blew her nose again.  “Listen, I know we haven’t spoken in a while… It’s just that--”  A weak sob.  “Cas, it’s dad---”
The bruise painting the side of his face was now concealed better than it had been at the restaurant last night, but Castiel knew it was there all the same.  What he didn't know was why it affected him at all, but he could no longer deny that it did.  When those somber green eyes flitted back to lock on Castiel, he cleared his throat, remembering himself.  He reminded himself he was actually excited about the lecture he planned for today.
“My Dad, he was workin’ an early shift, and my Mom, she was still in bed.  I told Sammy I’d make him breakfast, but I didn’t know how to do it back then.  I’d seen Mom do it so many times, ya know?  And I just said I could do it cuz I was older and I thought I knew everything.  How hard could it be, right?”  Dean forced an awkward laugh and shook his head at his own signature brand of naivety as he felt his eyes starting to burn for the umpteenth time tonight.  There was one particular spot beyond Castiel’s shoulder that suddenly seemed really interesting.  “Mom, she, uh, she didn’t make it out.”
Dean lowers the volume on the radio and dims the headlights as they pull up outside an old, abandoned factory that once housed the business ‘Hot Press Games’ according to the dilapidated sign hanging by a nail. The local sheriff’s department got a call reporting some unusual activity here, but claimed to have found nothing while doing a sweep of the building last week. None of the people they spoke with earlier could keep their stories straight either so they aren’t even sure what they’re walking into. Sounded like some sort of witch though based on the descriptions they were given.
“You know perfectly well.  He’s out there parading himself around campus in your bloody jacket like Cinderella in her glass slipper.  You can’t honestly believe I wouldn’t notice.”
Balthazar proceeded to casually shovel a fork full of salad into his mouth as he looked between Castiel and the still swinging door Dean had just disappeared behind.
Crouching down by his head, Castiel smiled up at him, grass clippings sticking to the back of his sweatshirt and out his messy head of hair.  “C’mon in, the water’s fine,” he said, eliciting another bout of giggles.
Scratching his bearded cheek, Benny looked up at him.  “Oh, I was just gonna tell you, I wash my underwear in cold water, but I definitely want the bedding in hot,” he said with a grin.
“Uh, dunno, Animal Control should be here sometime,” he said.  “Just found some food and filled the bowls, cuz well, you don’t wanna know what they been eating for who knows how long.”
Castiel stretched like a cat and groaned into the pillow.  He knew by the height of the sun it was still too early for a Saturday-- for any day. “Hello, Dean,” he grumbled in return.  His voice came out grating.  Ignoring the headache forming behind his eyes, he took the glass of water and drank.  It tasted like morning breath and residual stomach bile, but he drank until the glass was empty and handed it back.
Castiel did know.  They’d had this conversation more than once and every time they did Castiel promised “soon”, but it had been months and he was still making hollow promises.  Frankly, he didn’t know what anyone saw in him.
“Language,” she tutted.  “And he will, eventually.  That’s just how he is.  He just wants what’s best for you.”
“Well, you saw the monster too, so it obviously takes the form of another person.  Whoever it came to you as could form a link.  It might help explain what it is or what the witch bound it for, it's nature.”
“Dean…”  Castiel wracked his brain trying to formulate a coherent thought.  “Dean’s my roommate,” he shouted back to the guy over the loud music.
Instantly, Dean’s grip on his hips tightened.  With both hands, he tugged them closer by the belt loops, pressing them together at the groin, and captured Castiel’s lips in a searing kiss.  He blindly walked Castiel backwards towards his bed and they collapsed down on it together, knocking the folded laundry to the floor in a mounded heap.
He served himself a square of lasagna and cut one for Hannah, leaving it on a plate by the stove.  Making his way into the living room, he sat on the couch and calculated, pretending to watch the soap drama Hannah must have DVR’d unfolding on the television screen.
Dean’s confused beyond belief as to what just happened, but he knows this is the real Cas now.  Namely because this Cas is embarrassed as all hell, has all his layers on, and didn’t forget his shoes in the matrix.  Maybe Cas has no idea, what’s going on.  Hazarding a glance towards his friend, he follows Cas’ line of vision to the blue tie and the white button-up strewn at the foot of the bed that are identical to the ones the actual, dreamwalking Cas is sporting.  Cas rubs the back of his neck and looks away.
“I just think you can do a lot better than that guy.” Or any of the ones he’s brought home for that matter. “I don’t get what you get out of fucking all these random guys anyway. I don’t want to have to listen to it every time either.”
He knew Mick was hitting on him, and he knew he probably wasn’t interested, but what could a beer hurt anyway?  “Sure, why not?  A beer sounds good,” he said before tilting his head back to catch the rest of his drink.  Planting the glass on the bar, he gave Mick a small smile in return.
“Truthfully, I've been sleeping on the couch for the better part of the week so I assure you it's no trouble,” Castiel said.
Idly, he scanned the nearly-empty room in search of anything that might be of interest for the remainder of his time, but he was coming up blank.  The only other person here with him was Winchester sat at the neighboring lab table and he didn’t deem him interesting enough to warrant any real conversation, but he found himself watching him anyway. Just for something to do.  His freckled nose was studiously crammed into a splayed chemistry textbook and his pencil was feverishly erasing as he mouthed along with his reading.  His lips shaped the text between soft mutterings of curse words.
“You know,” started Castiel, chewing the inside of his cheek, “before you arrived back at the table, Dean… He thought we were on a date.” Castiel was musing more to himself than anything.  “He thinks we’re together.  I never got the chance to correct him.”  He let out a soft snort at the whole situation, gently shaking his head.
Castiel could have almost convinced himself Dean wasn't in the class, almost, had he not taken it upon himself to approach the podium.  Castiel fumbled with the phone in his hands when he glanced up to see that familiar smile.  “Hello, Mr. Winchester,” he said, as professionally as possible.  “Can I help you with something?”
“Cuz it’s more comfortable?” He laughed, casually stepping out of his jeans.  “Dude, why are you being so weird?”
“Kissing you, I suppose,” he answered, seemingly faraway.  “Without the pretense of alcohol or desperation.  Although, you seemed somewhat desperate earlier, so maybe it doesn’t count.”
Castiel, on the other hand, wasn't feeling anything.  “I don't think it's working,” he decided after a few minutes.
Dean smoothly pulled the headphones down around his neck, the tinny riff of a guitar solo spreading through the space between them.  “S’okay, Professor,” he said, eyes appraising, a sly smile tugging on his lips, “I don’t bite.”  Maybe it was coincidence that the tip of his tongue peaked out to wet them.  “Get it while it’s hot.”  Lowering his leg, Dean exaggeratedly slapped the open spot beside him.
She stared in shock at Castiel’s limp frame for a moment longer, before meeting Dean’s eyes.  A combination of emotions crossed her face, but mostly she was still just drunk.  Shaking her head, she said, “Um, no, I’m okay.  I can get a ride with Michael or something, but call me when you get home?”
“What’s in these?” he asked, picking up another one.  He was ready for it now so he tossed it back much more readily and at the sight that little light in Cas’ eyes began to flicker back to life.
Dean chuckled, taking the next wet plate from her.  “Nothin’ illegal, got it.”  He’d kind of been hoping she'd tell him he couldn't go, actually.
He wasn’t going to let it get to him anymore than he’d already let it.  He’d thought of hardly anything else for the last couple weeks and it got him nowhere, clearly.  He wouldn’t allow himself the energy to do so tonight.  Why should he?  Sometimes things were best laid to rest.  Besides, he was out of wine and if he were going to ruminate any more on any of the incessant shit threatening to drown him, he’d have to be properly drunk to do so.
“I’ve been waiting for you a long time, Castiel.  Perched on your shoulder.  Clawing through your perverted mind,” he spat.  “You’ve put up quite the fight for nothing.  You might as well give in now.”
Dean inched closer, lowering his voice as he leaned in to ask, “You think this painting looks like a massive dick or is it just me?”
Castiel wasn’t sure what to say.  Were they a couple?  No, he was straight.  He had a girlfriend.  Castiel was utterly lost.
Suddenly, the storm brewing behind Cas’ eyes passes.  The crease irons out.  He gives a light laugh as he shakes his head. “No, Dean.  Not like a lesbian,” is all he says.
Crossing the room, he took his usual seat on the other side of her desk.  At least this seat was cushioned.  His ass was starting to go numb out there and he told her as much.
Castiel fought off another small smile, but it slipped anyway.  “Like I said, awfully fresh,” he murmured almost fondly as he headed for the door.
That causes Dean to pause.  He closes the closet door with a frown pinching his forehead. “You don’t wanna shower with me? Thought we could have a little fun with that fancy showerhead or whatever.”
Charlie couldn’t have been gone more than a few minutes before a shorter woman in a ‘sexy’ witch costume appeared in front of him with a sly smile on her face.
When he pulled away, he regarded every inch of Dean with heavily lidded eyes.  “Forgive me,” he murmured so close Dean could still feel his warmth, “I've been wanting to try that for weeks.”
“And yet, in all of it, you never stopped to question why that was?  All that time?”  Their eyes met again, Balthazar’s quietly searching, but Castiel couldn’t hold the contact for long.  “God, what am I saying…  Of course you didn’t.  You think nothing of nobody, but yourself.  You’re so wrapped up in it you can’t even find your own way out.”
“Um,” he stammered, mouth seemingly dry.  “Y-yes.  I suppose you do.  Look... fuckable, I mean.”  He swallowed thickly, unable to meet Dean’s eye.
“Dean,” Castiel cried when his movements slowed to a stop.  He looked on with vacant eyes, past the haunting face staring up at the sky, to the disturbed earth underneath.  The black pool of blood forming a halo behind his head.  He looked down to his own hand holding the knife and how everything swam into focus in an instant.
What he wanted to do just then was text Balthazar and go grab a table for brunch, his finger was already hovering over the name before he could think any better of it, but he couldn’t do that now could he?  So he didn’t.
Sam cautiously flexes his joints as a test, like he still can't believe Cas is capable after all this time of fixing things with one touch. The action is so terribly reminiscent of Dean that Cas can’t dwell on the fact they aren't out of the woods yet, so to speak. To Sam, he asks, “What's the plan now?”
He was being naive and stupid.  Dean realized that, but for whatever reason he still felt drawn to his professor.  Well, he had -- ‘had’ being the operative word, because his professor seemed to be under the impression that Dean was a blackmailing, two-faced hooker, but whatever.  C’est la vie.  Apparently, Dean’s resulting scowl was more obvious than he’d thought given the concern in Benny’s eyes, but he didn’t have time for this and it wasn’t exactly something he wanted to discuss in the first place.
“Fuckin’ hell, Benny.”  Dean groaned, painfully abstaining from rolling his eyes, as he willed himself to open the apartment door.
With a gulp, he cleared the voice in his head and got on with it already.  He carefully divested Castiel of his boots, his shirt, his pants.  He couldn’t bring himself to remove more.  He found a clean, oversized t-shirt in the top drawer of the nearby dresser and pulled it on over his shoulders.  It would have to do, he supposed.  But he still looked cold.  Struggling to wrestle it out from under him and feeling utterly ridiculous, Dean tucked the comforter around him and Castiel seemed to breathe a little easier.
grumpy.”  Wordlessly, Dean raised an eyebrow and Castiel rolled his eyes.  “Truthfully I’ve never gotten drunk before, so I wouldn’t know,” he admitted, staring at the ground.  He could feel Dean’s face light up without even having to see it.
With a perfunctory nod, Dean continued into Benny’s room, gathering up the bedding off the mattress.  The pillowcases still had subtle notes of coconut shampoo masking the undertones of Benny’s aftershave.  It was an odd combination, but the only thing Dean was thinking about was the way Castiel’s dark tufts of hair had felt between his fingers and the way his mouth felt around his dick.  With a reluctant groan, he stuffed the bedding into Benny’s half-full hamper before he managed to work up another boner.  How he was going to manage to drag both baskets the couple blocks down to the laundromat, he hadn’t the faintest clue.
Either Sam’s patience is drawing thin this morning, or the nagging feeling in his gut is that something is grimly wrong, because he can’t stop bouncing on his heels and the site of the mailbox beside the door eats at him so much he can’t stop himself from going through it.  Bills, he finds.  Bills and more bills.  All piled up from the first of the month.  Sam looks at his phone for the date and frowns.  Not surprisingly, that was over a week ago -- before she went missing.
Castiel tilted his head, mulling it over.  “Then I would say I’m in no position to judge you one way or the other, and I would say thank you for trusting me enough to be the one to share that experience with you.”
“Byzantium.  After the fall of Constantine.”  Castiel lifts an eyebrow.  “I think the better question might be: where did you get yours?”
“You can have me, Cas,” he urged with a kiss to the angel’s wrist.  “You’ve always had me.  I- I love you.”
“I sure hope not, for your own sake,” she said.  “But hey, not much in way of business tonight.  Whaddya say you head on home early, fix yourself up, find yourself a real band-aid, huh?”
In that, he was reminded of that first time Castiel had asked, Are you alright?  Of the time when Dean wasn’t really alright, and how even now, he still wasn’t if he’d ever been alright at all.  People kept asking him that like they didn’t already know the answer by taking one good look at him.
“Yeah, yeah, whatever.”  Sam was usually right, even if Dean didn’t want to acknowledge it most of the time.  “Night, Sammy.”
“Good afternoon,” he greeted, making his way over to turn out the lights by the classroom door.  “I'm going to assume you all read the assigned pages last night.”  Castiel waited for any sign of assenting groans before continuing with a nod, having to trust they were telling the truth.  “Good.  Continuing our discussion from our last session, today we will be discussing the sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini.  In particular, this piece completed in 1652.”  He presented the first slide, entitled ‘The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa’ which elicited a few immature, yet anticipated snickers around the auditorium.  “Come on guys, you're all considered adults somehow,” he attempted a joke, but still had to suppress an eyeroll.
“Yes,” Castiel half-joked.  “But also because my subconscious told me I needed to find you.  Because it knew being around you, in any capacity, was better than any alternative.”  Castiel let slip a smile against his temple.  “I’m inexplicably drawn to you, Dean.  I don’t much care to figure out why.”
“It’s real, Dean— I’m real.  Jack resurrected me.”  For all of Cas’ restraint, he started to slip, bringing hesitant hands around to gently embrace him back.  He sagged under Dean’s hold with a weak, shuddered sigh before he latched on just as tightly.  “I wasn’t expecting to see you so soon,” he lamented.  “You shouldn’t be here yet.”
The first floor served as a restaurant until 11pm though they hardly ate.  The second floor acted as a lounge complete with a full bar and white leather booths lining the walls.  Not quite a club, Castiel decided, as the music was far too quiet for that and the atmosphere relaxed, but it was loud enough that he could barely hear himself think regardless of its classification.  A weird electronic melody that bounced around the room like an erratic, pulsing heartbeat.
“Hey, Aaron!” she called out to him, waving her hands over her head until he spotted them across the way.
“You know I do,” Dean teased back, leaning in for a slow kiss, that quickly deepened to something more.
The sound of Chuck tapping the dinner bell with the back of his spatula pulled Dean out of his own head.  “Order up,” he said, despite the fact Dean was standing right next to him.
When he pulled away, Dean opened his eyes and smiled.  Voice hoarse and quiet, he said, “Would ya look at that, no visitors.”  He hoisted himself to his feet on unsteady knees, and unceremoniously sat back on the messy surface of Castiel’s desk, reaching for his own belt buckle.  “My turn.”
Castiel sighed.  “You’re incorrigible.”  He straightened up fully, still unwilling to leave Dean’s orbit.
The bathroom was quickly steaming up causing the air to feel thick and heavy.  She had a towel wrapped around her and nothing else.  Reaching up to his collar, her fingers worked to undo the knot in his tie.
“I do not!  He’s my best friend— We friggin’ live together!” Dean rolls his eyes when his counterargument falls on deaf ears. “Anyways. About a month ago, Cas broke up with Meg—“
“Wow.  Color me impressed.  You deserve an Oscar,” he intoned.  Rubbing a palm over his face, Dean forced a laugh in feigned amusement as he shook his head.  “Hell, you don’t even know what you’re apologizing for, do you?”
“I’m right here, y’know,” said Dean, walking over to gather the cheeseburger and salad in both hands.
Sunday was spent on the floor.  Castiel’s apartment was cramped, much like his office, full of books, art, and things he found to be of particular interest for one reason or another.  So it was no surprise there was hardly enough work space to spread his drawing paper out on.  Part of him secretly preferred to work on the floor though, a full body experience, but he dreaded the day he wound up on a Life Alert commercial.
Exasperated, Castiel snorted and shook his head, stopping for a moment on the sidewalk to grant her shorter legs some reprieve.
“I’ve always been more mature than you,” Sam pointed out, and Dean forced a laugh as he turned to leave.
Dean searched for a hole in his argument, but he was coming up woefully short. Castiel simply smirked in some self-satisfied way and a subtle blush crept up on him.  He looked down to the paper then to hide it.
He probably just ruined the only close to genuine friendship he’d ever had.  Even if it wasn’t the healthiest relationship, Balthazar was always there, whether Castiel wanted him to be or not.  Who the fuck did he expect to be there for him now?  Michelangelo?  The cat didn’t even have opposable thumbs!
, Castiel thought, instinctually recalling the image of Dean with his hand down his pants. The thought did nothing to stop him from blushing in front of him now.  Cautiously, he reached out to take it and Dean turned his back on him with his face in his hands.  It was then, Castiel realized it wasn’t technically a magazine at all.  It was a catalogue.  Upon giving it a cursory flip-through, it was a women’s underwear catalogue to be specific.  The corner’s of his lips turned down in some vague sense of a question, but Castiel wasn’t sure what to do beyond that.  He didn’t want to dwell on the idea of Dean and Lisa picking out her panties together, not especially now.
The man shrugged.  “Your call.  But yeah, gross shit, so I heard,” he digressed.  “Gives me the heebie jeebies just thinking about it.”
“Nonsense, Father,” he said with his usual gleaming white smile.  Flipping through the bills, Dean said to the driver, “The Father here saved my life.  Payin’ for his cab is the least I can do.”  He handed the money to the driver and instructed him to keep the change before reaching to open the back door for him.
The only thing pulling him out was the sound of a rich gravel voice tumbling like river rocks against the side of his neck.  “Tell me what you want,” Castiel asked of him.  And it shouldn’t have meant anything, but it did.  Because no one’s ever asked him that before.  Not like this.
“Dean, that’s not necessary,” started Castiel, still fumbling with his own wallet, “I have the appropriate change.”
She stares at Sam, not believing a word he’s saying.  The woman looks to Cas again for an explanation to his existence outside of her mind.
There was static and the subtle sounds of papers fluttering.  And then there was the crystal clear thump of a glass bottle hitting the formica table in their cramped kitchen and a soft slew of curses muttered off in the distance.  Whiskey, bottom shelf label.  Made for quantity not quality.
This wasn’t the first time his feet lead him here either.  He’d found himself standing here more than once over the last month, mind convinced it was simply a nice place to go for a walk.  Lying to himself as if to say he didn’t want to go inside again.  As if to say the whole thing was just one big coincidence instead of fate.
Castiel watched the flickering, repetitive neon sign blinking at him through the rain.  The green snake biting into the juicy, red apple continuously on a loop.  A fluorescent smear painting the side of the brick wall next to the door.  It was entrancing, like a beacon guiding him.  Like a siren calling him to shore.
“The whole town knows how he gets.  Always blustering down at the bar lately.  Must be that time of year.”
Smacking his palms against the wet tiles, Dean eagerly widened his stance as he braced himself for Cas’ fingers, but Cas was preoccupied laying gentle kisses across Dean’s shoulders and over the top of his spine.  His hands were taking their sweet ass time to get there too, washing over him, and tripping over his perky nipples just because he knew Dean liked it.
As soon as they were out of earshot, Castiel stepped closer to him, facing him again.  “You should go enjoy the rest of the gallery, Dean,” he suggested lowly,  “I’ll see you at dinner.”
Truth be told, Castiel couldn’t feel his face and he wasn’t entirely convinced he even had one anymore.  That had been the first thing to go, but he knew he was grinning.  Warm all over.  His arms tingled and his legs were a little bit like jello too.  Definitely grape, not cherry.  He couldn’t decide if that was a good thing or a bad thing right now, but he found he didn’t really care yet.  Right now, he didn’t really care about anything and it felt fucking fantastic.
Something in the back of his mind whispered he was going to regret this, but he tampered the voice down when the bartender handed them both another shot of vodka, slinging them back with ease.  Balthazar always said if you couldn't see the calories then it didn't actually count.
“How did my hair look tonight?” she asked eventually.  She always asked these days.  It was part of the routine now.
Castiel scoffed.  He could hear them down the hall in the Ceramics studio through the crack in his door.  He couldn’t close it because then any student hoping to speak with him during office hours would be shit out of luck.  Maybe he wasn’t closing it because he wanted to listen, but he pushed that thought from his mind and resolved to do more work while ignoring the soft sounds of tentative flirting echoing down the hall.
The resounding silence on the other end of the line was a heavy weight in his gut.  There was a moment when Castiel almost hung up, but then the voice on the other end of the line cleared its throat and spoke, quiet and quivering and on the unmistakable verge of tears.
The silence was a tangible weight and Dean knew he phrased that all wrong, but Castiel was already processing it. He tilted his head, studying Dean’s reaction closely when he gently asked, “What about a boy?”
Dean blanches. “You don’t mean that,” he says, with a painful grimace disguised as a smile, but Cas isn’t smiling. “Hey, c’mon— Cas, just wait a minute.” He reaches out to grab him by the hand, but Cas is quicker than that.
A wave of sound drowned him out of his fleeting thoughts as he opened the entrance to the club.  He should have expected it given the first and only time he’d been here, but he wasn’t thinking of the first time, he was only thinking of the here and now and it left him with the low thumping of adrenaline coursing underneath his skin.  He came here with a purpose, subconscious or not.  He came here for a reason.  He just wasn't sure what it was.
It was dark, but Castiel would place bets the poor girl was blushing.  This was clearly Greek to her, and Castiel scolded himself again for the clumsy mental pun.
Once his head was freed, hair sticking up like an electric shock, he shot Dean a glare, filled with an entirely different kind of heat.  “Another remark and you’ll be feeling me for a week,” he promised as he fumbled with his belt buckle and fly.  He slid his pants and boxers down his legs in one swift motion as he abandoned them in a pile on the floor, exposing his equally toned thighs.
Dean was up to his elbows in suds when he felt his phone vibrate in his back pocket.  He’d been waiting for a reply from Sam for the better part of the day and every hour that went by without an update had his stomach twisting itself into knots.  Sam always replied.  Sam was good like that.  Stripping one arm free of his obnoxiously yellow rubber gloves, he pulled his phone out to reveal it wasn’t a text from Sam, but from Charlie.
With that Castiel took the book from Dean’s fidgeting hands and placed it on the table.  Dean looked to him then with confusion until he realized Castiel was closer than he was only a moment ago and it caused his breath to hitch and stumble.  The warmth from Castiel’s breath tickled Dean’s face as he leaned in closer and experimentally brushed their lips together.  It was soft and sweet like jelly and remarkably purposeful and when Castiel’s tongue grazed the seam of his mouth, Dean opened to it easily, nearly forgetting himself as it inevitably shifted from gentle to something deeper.  Something more.
“Wanna be inside you,” Dean purred against the side of his face, warm breath ghosting over Castiel’s rough cheek.  “Wanna fuck you, Cas.  Please.”  He emphasized it with another nip to his lower lip.  “Can I?”
It was a low blow, one that hit below the belt, but Castiel had to give him props for that because it made him almost reconsider if it weren’t for the fact in helping Dean he would have to speak to him every day.  An act he tried to avoid if at all humanly possible. But it wasn’t like looking at him without speaking was any less of a thorn in his side either.
He wasn’t really sure how to feel about Benny knowing who Castiel was to him either.  Not that he was anything really, besides his professor and the guy that just fucked him, but in his head, he’d imagined anyone finding out about it to be a bigger bomb shell.  Like a grenade instead of a firecracker.  Maybe it was just because Benny wasn’t personally invested in Dean’s college life, or he was just trying to mind his own.  Dean couldn’t decide, but in some small way it was a relief to know that he wasn’t alone in knowing.  Not that he was going to gab to him about it like girls at a sleepover or anything.  Just a way to relieve some of this burden of keeping things so close to his sleeve.  And fuck, Benny genuinely did not care about the rest, even if he was an asshole.
Balthazar seemed confident, but Castiel knew otherwise.  He didn't want to leave this bed until absolutely necessary.  “That seems unlikely and you didn't answer my question.”
“Yeah, bye.  I’m leaving now,” he muttered, dragging the hampers onto the landing and closing the door behind him. Feeling around in his jean pockets, he realized just as quickly he forgot the bag of quarters.
Eventually, feeling the wisps of Dean’s easy breath across his chest, Castiel drifted back to sleep too.
“Okay, okay. Sorry.”  Collecting herself, she takes a deep breath and hits him with her best attempt at stoicism. “What makes you think you’re homophobic?”
” he called, until the lock clicked on the other side of the door.  As soon as it opened, he was tumbling through it, practically crashing into Sam into the kitchen.  “Phone the paramedics,” he panted, hands falling to his knees, “I think I’ve finally done it!”
“You love taking my cock like this, don’t you? Love being Daddy’s— little— toy,” he asked between sharp, accentuated thrusts. “You’re being so good for me, Dean,” Cas praised in that rough, graveled way, knowing- just knowing- the way it made Dean shiver. Cas’ large hands cupped his face and he stared down at him openly, lovingly, nearing reverence himself as Dean’s reddened, swollen lips worked over him. “You’re beautiful like this.”
“I did, but that doesn’t matter!  It’s a demon.  A succubus,” Cas blurts without any preamble.  His abrupt certainty gives Sam pause.  “Or, in this case, an incubus,” he clarifies.
Dean just huffed a mirthless laugh.  “Yeah, something like that.”  He thought everybody knew that.  He also knew that if Castiel were awake and sober right now, he’d be telling Dean to go fuck himself.  He was more sure of that than the sky being blue.  “He wouldn’t want me helping him right now.”
“Hey, actually, before you go, I was wondering if you’d ever want to come take a look at my stuff sometime.  No pressure or anything, just might be cool.  And if you’re down, I got a spot by the basement exit to aid in my ‘higher education’,” he said, wagging his eyebrows.
Castiel pondered the question before he met Dean’s eye.  “I find I like just about anyone who’s willing to discuss my art with me.  Most people aren’t willing to be as forthcoming as you, Dean.  It’s refreshing,” he said, “So, thank you.”
Begrudgingly, he settled in the student lounge down the hall to continue on with his coursework, ignoring the jealous monster eating away at him.  Yet still, even with the mental images of Dean and Lisa springing unbidden in his mind, the unsolicited advice to just tell Dean how he felt was wearing away at his resolve to take this whole embarrassing debacle to the grave.
Dean searched the room as though it might have a better answer.  “Well, it would prove to Ms. Barnes you don’t need a tutor for starters.”
“Well,” she continued, swallowing her mouthful, “I think that you’re both cute and you’re both single and you should give him a chance.”
“C’mere,” ordered the customer, who had now reached between his wide legs and was rubbing his half-hard cock through his tailored dress pants.  Dean obeyed, crossing the carpet to place himself in front of the man on the couch, thrusting his hips suggestively to the beat coming through the speakers.  “Turn around.”  So, he did.  He circled his ass in the air, bending and twerking and whatever else to please the whims of this total stranger.
Coming up to the center island, he asked “Don't talk to who?” as he popped the caps off the bottles.
“Truthfully, I think I'm too old to be doing any of this,” admitted Castiel, as he gave himself a final once over and straightened out a few errant hairs.
If he thought he was entitled to know anything about Dean, the very same guy he accused of being a money hungry whore, then he had another fucking thing coming.
Castiel scanned the scene with lost, wide eyes.  Deer in headlights would be putting it mildly.  The blaring sound of the synthesizer flooded his ears and the suffocating way people bumped up against him were enough to make him want to bolt.
Hiding his blush, Dean hollowed his cheeks and sucked hard, causing Cas to swear under his breath before he was allowed to pull off.
“Like why the witch cast a binding spell in the first place?  Like what were they doing with those bodies?  Like, if you and Cas claim it wasn’t a djinn, then what the hell was it?”
“Hey, look at you with the jacket though,” added Benny with a low impressed whistle.  He clapped him on the shoulder as the other’s congratulated him too, and Dean smiled and actually blushed a bit at the unprecedented praise.  Especially since Victor and Gordon already got theirs the tail end of junior year.
“Me too,” he said, but Dean could tell the gears in his head were still turning. He didn’t prompt him to speak, and honestly, Dean was a little scared to hear what else he had to say. So they sat in the quiet, Dean’s arm around him, Castiel leaning into it, listening to the peeper frogs, until he inevitably started up talking again. “Do you think… Do you think we’ll be friends?”
“Nah, man, I'm not like that.  That shit doesn't matter to me, but you're fine.  I mean you're not ugly,” Dean stammered out awkwardly, taking another sip of his coffee to occupy his mouth.  He glanced out the window as other students passed by on the sidewalk.
Pacing a short circle, Sam ponders the question for a moment.  The factory is silent other than Sam’s own breathing and the persistent dripping from the water pipe running along the ceiling.  Sam’s eyes track the length of the pipe, moving down the side of the wall where it disappears through the plaster behind the door labelled, ‘BOILER ROOM’.  He catches Cas’ eyes again and returns his gaze to the door.  “Huh... did you guys check in there?”
"The sacred–profane dichotomy is an idea posited by French sociologist Émile Durkheim, who considered it to be the central characteristic of religion: "religion is a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, that is to say, things set apart and forbidden."[1] In Durkheim's theory, the sacred represented the interests of the group, especially unity, which were embodied in sacred group symbols, or totems. The profane, on the other hand, involved mundane individual concerns. Durkheim explicitly stated that the sacred–profane dichotomy was not equivalent to good/evil. The sacred could be good or evil, and the profane could be either as well."
“Do not gorge yourself like a common animal on tainted blood,” scolds Castiel, pulling the thumb from Dean’s mouth.  “You’ll spoil your appetite.”  The clouds in his vision have barely begun to part when Castiel releases his painful grip and Dean straightens his posture against the wall.
Reaching out, Dean laid his hand over Cas’ and squeezed, fingers lacing together.  “Move, Cas,” he urged, “Feel so fuckin’ good, sweetheart.”
Dean catches his stubbled jaw and cuts him off with a soft, lingering kiss. Cas’ lips brush sweetly against his when they part and Dean can’t help the grin that splits his face. “Is it?”
With numb fingers, he fished the thing out and squinted against the bright spot in the dark, sagging when he saw the caller ID.
Dean cleared his throat and blushed, hand absently gripping the outline of the cell phone in his pocket a little tighter than it had before.  “A date?”
Cas heaves a heavy, put-upon sigh as if he’s told him this a hundred times instead of just the once. “Dean, I’m aware of my sexual history, but I don’t know what to tell you. Sexuality and gender are fluid,” he offers with a shrug. “It’s something I think I’ve known for a while, but never was comfortable enough with my body to explore; women felt safer. Now, though, I’ve decided I’d like to explore my sexuality fully, I just didn’t know how to tell you because I wasn’t sure how you’d react.”
After about five minutes had passed, Balthazar let out an annoyed huff.  “I will say this,” he said, reaching into his trouser pocket for his leather wallet, “The blonde girl may not be the most charming server I’ve ever encountered, but her service was infinitely more prompt.”  He thumbed through the bills in his wallet and pulled out what Castiel could surmise as being far more than what the actual bill called for.  He waved them around a bit for Castiel’s benefit before laying them on the table.
Slipping one of his palms around, he massaged it into the tensing muscle of Dean’s thigh, inching circles higher and higher.  Dean’s cock was thicker now, almost full.  Castiel didn’t deliberate for long.  He dragged the heel of his palm over Dean’s length and he stroked him once under the golden spandex.  Finally, a stifled groan managed to break free from Dean’s now parted lips, but his eyes pinched shut, face scrunched into something unreadable like a child waiting for some invisible monster to dissipate.  Wrapping a hand around the back of Dean’s neck, Castiel tugged him in, capturing Dean’s lower lip in a slow, wet kiss and it broke whatever spell Dean was under.  He responded in earnest, kissing back with the kind of unbridled energy only an eighteen year old can muster.
Dean couldn’t disagree.  There was lube drying tacky between his ass cheeks on top of everything else.  “Um, shower… I mean we could use it, I guess.”
Dean makes it home later than usual, hoping against all better reasoning that he’ll catch Cas before he’s holed himself up in his room again— because for all of the weapons in Dean’s own arsenal, Cas has a few avoidance tactics of his own. But when he comes through the door to an empty living room for the fourth night in a row, he realizes he’s already too late. He hangs his keys up by the door with a long sigh, toes out of his boots like usual, but the sustained quiet as he heats up something for dinner is driving him up the wall. It’s been like this all damn week. Dean’s not hungry either. He never is during times like these.
From where he stood, Castiel could see the whites of his tainted eyes.  He didn’t answer him.  He found his place in the Book and he began to read from the Litany of Saints, weakly stringing together their names, as he bent over to bestow the cross upon Dean as well.  Dean hissed like a snake, a spitting thing at the back of his throat, but when Castiel continued reading he began to laugh all the while.
Just then, the door to the stairwell swung open.  “Hey! You two,” shouted Vice Principal Adler, and Dean fell back.  Castiel rubbed his sore throat and reluctantly averted his glare from Dean to the bald man currently charging at them like an angry bull.  “Why aren’t you two in class?”
The air was cold tonight.  It was biting at his skin on the walk home, threatening to creep under his jacket, so he tugged it tighter around himself and kept moving.  His boots felt heavy still and there was the distinct smell of crisp autumn air rolling in off the water, despite it not being autumn for a few more days, that was working to sober him up faster than he wanted.
He smiled at Castiel’s oblivious, frowning face, trying pitifully to connect the dots.  “So everyone knew, but me.”
“I just need enough time to talk to Wendy and hit the warehouse again.  See if there's anything we missed.”
Her lazy smile spread wider.  “We’re gonna have a good time, Clarence,” she drunkenly slurred, and before Castiel could correct her on the name, she was gripping his hand tighter and using it to tug him through the crowd towards the stairs.
The lecture carried on in a similar vein, only stopping briefly to answer a rare question about the Baroque style,  until the clock hands signaled it was time for him to give it a rest.  With that, Castiel bid his students adieu, reminding them again of their reading and an upcoming paper, before packing away his belongings and heading back to his corner office in the dank basement.
After a long pause, “No.  I suppose I don't.”  Cas tries for a smile, but it doesn't quite reach his eyes again.
Rock bottom didn’t seem as dire as he’d always imagined it being.  If he didn’t know better, he’d say he’d been wasting a lot of time worrying about something that never mattered in the long run.  He was here again and as it turned out, no one gave a single fuck.  Himself included.
“Because I’m a nerd,” he lamented, “And I’m gonna die alone with weird shoes because you like appliances.”  Before Dean could respond to that, Castiel shot up from his stool.  “Dean, I don’t think I like tequila,” he said with growing urgency, “I think I’m gonna throw up.”
“Hey, you don’t gotta defend it, I ain’t judging.  I got some pretty weird kinks myself,” countered Dean with a casual shrug.  “But I mean it, man. Course you can come.”
“No?”  Obnoxiously, Balthazar craned his neck as if he hadn’t heard him correctly.  “Since when does Castiel Novak not care about tenure?”
Sam got onto the main road and headed east, without so much as a word, until they started seeing rolling cornfields.
Wordlessly Dean takes it, assessing him from the other side of the counter, but he still can’t shake the feeling that something is different.  He hates to open that door, the one where they get mushy about their feelings, but he finds himself asking anyway.  “Everything good with you, man?”
They were walking towards the green to eat as the question caught up to him.  “Wait… who?  What are we talking about?”
Backing his way out, he turned to check the bar, but the only one there was the bartender cleaning up empty glasses and wiping down the bartop.  Clearly a failure to launch, but he approached anyway.  “Have you seen my friend?”  The bartender didn't hear him at first so he repeated it, louder.  He looked up from where he was cleaning and gave Castiel a critical once-over, hooking his thumb in the direction of the back exit.  He nodded his thanks as he moved around the bar towards the exit.
The looming prospect of his Dad inevitably finding out about his detention made him queasy, if Bobby hadn’t told him already.  He dropped the pizza onto his plate and managed another smile.  It came out more like a grimace.  “Practice was good, just worked on a couple plays.”
Castiel was sat on a white leather stool at the bar, idly swirling the remnants of his drink inside the pristine glass while he waited for Balthazar to inevitably strike out again.  He’d already struck out twice so far and if Castiel didn’t know any better, he might say that Balthazar was deliberately approaching people he knew he wouldn’t have a shot with.  Whether it was to be a better wingman to Castiel, or for an altogether more unsavory reason, he couldn’t decide.  He wasn’t going to leave here with Balthazar no matter how many drinks either of them had; not like that at least.  Castiel was on the dregs of number two, Balthazar already had three.  He was always one step ahead.
Castiel spilled the holy water on his face, into his mouth and up his nose, and Dean sputtered and squealed around it, limbs flailing as he struggled to breathe.  He laid his crucifix to Dean’s forehead, embedding it with his palm, and he raised his voice higher over him still, repeating the exorcism, casting him out once more and ignoring the way Dean’s body contorted and convulsed against the mattress.
He wasn’t sure what he thought being drunk would feel like, but he was unsteady on his feet and he really had to piss.  Instead he just closed his eyes and sat down at the closest available stool.
Bringing his hands to his face, Dean pulled on his cheeks and groaned out a laugh.  “Y’know, I'm beginning to think you'd look awesome in green, dude.  You always this jealous or am I just special?”
The next morning is different, however, because Dean never even really slept.  He can hear them quietly greeting each other down the hall and he can hear the heavy weight of the bunker door close behind them when they leave.  And he’s still awake when they come back an hour or so later.  He still doesn't get it.
“I didn’t break up with Meg because of- because of her eyes, Dean,” he blisters.  “This is veering off topic.” He sighs again, running a hand over his peach fuzz.  “I guess I should just say it.”  He struggles to get comfortable and ends up sitting uncomfortably straight against the arm of the couch. Dean takes a swig of beer and slides it onto the coffee table in anticipation, but nothing can prepare him for what Cas says next:
With the guy’s temper across the table quickly mounting, Castiel stood from the table and deposited his books onto a nearby cart.  Charlie quickly followed suit, haphazardly collecting all her things to chase after him.
“It’s still there.”  Watching him with suppressed amusement, Castiel asked, “You said you needed my help with something?”
“Yeah, yeah.”  Heaving himself out of the car, Dean tossed Jess a wink on his way around and glared at Sam as he passed him on the curb.  “Somebody better show me where the wine and cheese are at first.”
He rubbed back the blurred edges of sleep, before beckoning, “Yes, come in,” through pinched lids.  If he was this exhausted after a week, he had no idea what he would be like come December.
With that, Dean breathes a little easier and sags more comfortably into the couch cushions.  “Okay,” he says, “it’s all good,” but Cas looks far from it. Tentatively, he rests a grounding hand on Cas’ shoulder and squeezes.  “Hey, Cas, look at me.” It takes a minute. Cas seems obstinate in his resolve, but Dean waits him out until those big blue eyes are all on him. He smiles then, hoping it comes off reassuring more than anything else.  “Whatever it is, you can tell me, man. I’m not going to be mad. Scout’s honor.”
Not wanting to let temptations lie in wait, he marched into the bathroom with renewed purpose and flushed the tissue.  He couldn't be sure he wouldn't try to add it to his phone after he got drunk, which he was now going to have to do to forget all about this again.  Wine was invented for times like this.  He poured himself four full glasses, chugging each one in earnest, before stumbling his way into bed later that night with the hopes for a dreamless sleep.
“Just think,” he said, closing his laptop while the students began to close up their notebooks for the day, “I’m probably one of your cooler professors.  Let that sink in this weekend, while you choose a subject for your paper.”
“You need to bury me, Dean,” he'd said to the barn wall in a moment of divine clarity.  A state that was calm, rational, and few and far between.  Anything, he’d told himself, to keep humanity safe in a world full of monsters.  Anything to keep Dean safe.
“You know you’re not the bad guy here, Dean,” Sam said.  “You’re just a guy that went to college.  You don’t have to keep blaming yourself for everything that was never your fault to begin with.”
He filled the silence with food as Balthazar absorbed all the information that was just dumped in his lap.  Setting down his fork, Balthazar cleared his throat.  “So, this Dean Winchester is the twinkie from the club who has a special interest in… sculpture?  Honestly, if I were you I'd be throwing a parade, but seeing as how I'm not, you obviously can't do anything regarding...this.”  He gestured flippantly at the air around a bite of his crepe.
Placing his water on the step beside him, Castiel lightly gripped the beer bottle and awkwardly shifted himself around on the step.  Unsure, he lifted his head to meet the boy’s gaze and offer him ritual thanks whichever way he decided, but he was caught off guard by the face before him.  His eyes were bright even by the glow of the porch light, a single, silver angel wing glinting as it dangled from his ear lobe, and he was looking at Castiel intently.  A gentle smirk pulled at the corner of his lips revealed a curious set of party store vampire fangs affixed to his teeth.  The smirk only widened as Castiel caught himself lingering on them.
Slowly, appraisingly, the guy gave Dean a once over and Dean felt himself blush, if only slightly.  The guy must’ve liked what he saw because he turned his body then, to face Dean more fully.  “No, unfortunately the only one that dragged me out here was myself.”  He went back to half-heartedly analyzing the painting to his left, as Dean scanned the room.
“Cas -- it's been a while,” he’d said one day, like it was a phone conversation amongst friends catching up, not the inevitable end.  “I'm sorry I never told you before things went south.  I'm sorry I never told you when things were good either. Just... I gotta say it cuz I don't know how much time I got, but,” He swallowed, collecting himself, “I love you, Cas.”  He sucked in a sharp, watery breath, and released a soul-wracking sob. “I needed you to know that before I do something stupid on purpose.  Cuz this world… Without you, without Sammy… Well, it ain’t got much left for me, does it?  And I just- I needed you to know, in case this is the last chance I get to say anything.  I know it's selfish, but it's what I deserve.  Just remember that for me?  Please?”
He waited at the bar for lack of anything better to do with his time.  He felt impatient and every minute that ticked by devastatingly slow was a minute closer to being disappointingly sober.  Castiel didn’t want to be sober.  Being sober meant he had to reflect on his actions, be that his poor choice of words to Balthazar or the very fact he was sat at the bar of this gay club again where the glasses had to be peeled off the counter.  Neither of which were things he wanted to deal with, particularly not now.
Some minutes passed and Castiel spent them absentmindedly gazing at the dancer that was on stage.  He wasn’t exactly capturing Castiel’s interest.  He was too muscular and his movements were too jerky and he had too much hair on his chest, but more than any of that he wasn’t Dean and Castiel hated himself a little more just for having the thought.  For all he knew, Dean still hated him too.  What was he even doing here?
“Maybe.  I’ll come down for Thanksgiving or something, how’s that?  It’s not so far.”  Sam gave a reluctant hum, acknowledging Dean brushing him off.  “But, hey listen, I gotta get back or else I won’t make enough to send for the groceries and shit.  If that fucker tries anything else tonight you call me back and if I don’t answer, give Bobby a ring to come get you, you hear me?”
“That’s how you get it done,”  Dean lauded. He sipped his hot coffee with a pleased grin and held out the other for Castiel.
He passed the joint off to somebody else before he could do anymore damage to himself.  “I tell you one thing though,” leaning in, he conspires, “She’s definitely ‘head’ somethin’.”  He over-exaggeratedly wagged his eyebrows and Benny tittered and nudged him, and the other guys busted out laughing and giving him more congratulatory claps on the shoulder, more vigorous than for any old letterman jacket.  The shameful feeling corroded his stomach, but he smiled all the same.
“Anyway,” Dean segued with a smirk, eyeing him suspiciously over his bacon, “Enough about my night.  How was yours?”
Just then he noticed an old woman across the train car keeping a wary eye on the pair of them like they were suspicious characters plotting to steal her purse or something.  The two of them probably looked ridiculous sitting there together, battered and bruised.
Sam purses his lips together at the sight, forcibly not thinking about the fact they still haven’t found Dean.  “That’s... great, Jack.  Good job.”
“Yeah,” he sighed, “Always.” Looking him in the eye, he trailed down his length with his lips and tongue and licked a long, wet stripe up the underside.
Mary finally turned to look back at them and when she spotted her husband, she gasped.  “John, you’re filthy!  Go on upstairs and change before we eat.”
“Hello, Dean.”  Castiel rolled his eyes.  “And that’s not what I meant.  I just wasn’t expecting you back tonight.”
“Hey, sorry, he didn’t mean anything by it,” assuages Sam, gently, to calm the man down.  How would Sam know if he meant it though?  That’s silly.
“Will wonders never cease!  You look better than me, you bloody Casanova!”  Shockingly he'd opted out of his usual revealing v-neck in favor of a modest black turtleneck.
Pulling away after a long minute, voice slightly rough and breathless, he wiped the saliva from his lips on the back of his sleeve.  “So, where are we going?”
The grill sizzled as another burger patty was slapped down on the cooktop.  The sharp hiss and crackle of fat echoed past the sounds of the sprayer nozzle in the sink as Dean worked.  He had on those obnoxiously yellow rubber gloves and a useless hairnet strapped over his short hair.  The front of his shirt and apron were drenched with dirty dish water.  All in all, he was a mess, but what did it even matter back here?  Chuck didn’t look any better than he did.
Castiel blinked hard and really looked at them.  Brown eyes, brown hair.  He shook his head like an Etch-a-sketch when he realized the person supporting all of his weight wasn’t in fact Dean or any of his friends, but a virtual stranger.
“He is,” Sam interjected out of nowhere and Jess giggled at Dean’s grumpy face.  “Matt Brody is his man-crush.  He’s watched about a hundred episodes of Baywatch this week alone.  Don’t even get him started on his crush on Pamela Anderson’s boobs or you might never hear about anything else.  Not mentioning it is really a public service at this point.”
“I’m holding you to that, Dean Winchester.  One of these days, I’d like to have sex with my boyfriend again.”
“I- I guess I never told you ‘cus I thought I deserved it.  It was only me, ya know?  It wasn’t every time.  I thought I could handle him myself and then we had you to go to eventually when it got bad and I’m grateful for it— You don’t even know how grateful I am for it— but I’m at school now and  I thought it would stop with me being gone, but it didn’t.  It didn’t stop and now I don’t know how to protect him, Bobby!  He’s my little brother and I can’t even protect him.  I don’t know what to do and I just— please, Bobby, I need your help,” Dean finished with an abortive sniff, realizing too late that he’d already started crying like a frustrated child.
Truthfully, the story didn’t paint him in a very good light.  Castiel knew now, regret felt exactly like this.
There was probably an obvious answer lying hidden in plain sight, but Castiel’s mind was swirling with alcohol and low-blood sugar and the floodgate had been unleashed.  This wasn’t what he wanted to say.  This wasn’t about Dean, but his mind was taking it there anyway.  Almost immediately, he was filled with insurmountable regret, a shaking hand coming up to scrub at the ever present stubble on his cheeks.   His face was warm and he couldn’t look Balthazar in the eye.  He didn’t want to see his friends face whether it be filled with hurt or anger or sadness or some immutable combination of the three.
When his cock slid tantalizingly between Dean’s fingers, Castiel figured he didn't really have much of a choice in the matter anymore.  “What's the game?” he stammered between hitched breaths.  He could feel Dean smiling against his skin more than he could see it, knowing he’d successfully reeled him in.
Dropping the wet rag to the counter, John turned to them and offered a tight-lipped, hardly reassuring smile.  “Your mother’s fine, boys.  She just wasn’t hungry tonight,” he said gruffly, undoubtedly trying to convince himself more than the room.  From above, Mary called down for him and he steeled himself, before setting the cleaning aside.  “Eat your dinner and clean up after yourselves when you’re done,” he said as he headed for the stairs.
“Um, yeah, I did.  Thanks again,” he eked out.  His voice was rough and squeaky all at once.  Out of the blue, his stomach gave a loud rumbling growl.
“You were very nearly dead,” Castiel supplies as if it helps anything. “Condolences,” he adds to the crumpled look on Dean’s face.
“Fuck—”  Dean winced at the feeling of Cas slipping out and then Cas turned his chin for a surprisingly gentle, languid kiss.  Relishing every second of it.
“I've been wanting to do this ever since I first saw you,” whispered Damien, humid against his ear.  It sounded like an admission, but Castiel couldn't figure out the riddle; there wasn't enough blood left in his brain.  “How ‘bout a happy ending, Birthday Boy?”
He decided to send off a text to Charlie asking about that party he missed just for something else to do.  Though in retrospect, he really didn’t feel like he’d missed anything.  Last night had turned out infinitely better than he’d originally anticipated, all things considered.
“Thank you for your divine wisdom, Balthazar.  Whatever would I do without you?”  He balled up his napkin and tossed it on his plate, nudging it off to the side.  “I know I can't do anything, but I already signed the course form.  He's in the class.  I can't just remove him.  That would raise a few unnecessary red flags, wouldn't it?”
The team bounded toward the locker room not long after to change out of their uniforms and wash away the sweat and kicked up dirt caked on their faces.  It smelled like ass and body odor and piss and he couldn’t hear himself think in there with all the other guys shooting the shit about their big win and how sour the Olathe South guys looked about losing to them again.
Balthazar began to back out of the doorway, but stopped short when Castiel blurted out “Mrs. Birdell died.”
“I just need to say I’m sorry, Sam.  I should’ve been there.  I’ve been so busy with work and with school, I never really made time to stop and check in on you.  I didn’t think he’d, y’know, with you and,” he stuttered and amended, “I just didn’t think.  But I- I shoulda known better.  I shoulda been there to stop him.”
“That was your own doing,” Castiel said with a huff.  “I seem to recall you going out of your way not to touch me.”
“Dean, wait,” he says, pushing the door back open, far too easily.  Dean does as he's told, though, and stops a few feet from where he started.  He doesn't say anything, just turns his head back to look at Cas standing in the doorway, waiting on the other side of the threshold just like he’s waiting for that same friggin’ invitation.  “May I come in?  Please?”
“No, sir!  Not tonight!”  Pushing the door back open, Balthazar snaked a hand around Castiel’s wrist and tugged him out into the hall.  “I can see you’re wearing your good jeans tonight and that can only mean one thing…”
The waitress stopped by and took their order then.  Sam got a short stack and Dean ordered another coffee, black.  Their order came back to the table in no time.  The more he drank, the more his knee bounced uncontrollably under the table.  Sam shifted his overstuffed backpack in the booth beside him to withdraw the cash to pay and that was when it really sank in. Idle chit chat could only last for so long.
“Dean,” Cas sighed against his lips, his own eyes glassy with unshed tears.  “I love you too.  And I’m never going to leave you again.”
Castiel met with his students briefly at the admissions counter to hand them all discount stickers for their IDs.  After that they seemed to scatter of their own accord, for which he was grateful because he was genuinely looking forward to the quiet serenity that often came with being surrounded by art.  Naturally, Charlie and Dean stuck together; practically bound at the hip as new friends often are.  He didn’t dwell.  He paid for his own admission and wandered his way up the ornate stairwell that climbed both sides of  the rotunda.
“I’m sorry, I need to… I need to go.”  In a rush of breath, he tacked on a “thank you”. For what, he didn't know.
“That’s what we were disagreeing on,” chimed Castiel, much to his and Dean’s apparent surprise.  “I ate his grilled cheese.  He’s very protective over his food..”
When Dean fell back limply against the bed, Castiel collapsed with him.  “Fuck,” he groaned, muscles tightening to keep Dean from slipping out just yet.
Haphazardly, he stuffs the mail back in the box.  “Something’s not right,” he voices to Jack.  “We’re gonna have to break--”  Sam stops short when Jack opens the front door with an abundance of ease.
They traded smiles and Dean walked with him across the living room towards the front door.  They both ignored Benny who was sat on the sofa with his bare feet propped up on the coffee table, noisily slurping a bowl of cereal.  As they passed, Castiel took stock of the lumpy bed pillow propped on one end of the couch along with the quilted blanket folded next to it, but he didn’t mention it.  It wasn’t his place.  As they went out onto the hallway landing.  A muffled, “Bye, Daddy,” could be heard as they closed the door behind them.
“Oh, don't even pull that!”  Dean scrubbed a hand down his quickly reddening face and suddenly he was in Castiel’s space again, glowering down at him.  “You think I don’t care?  Huh?  You think I’m the asshole?  How the fuck do you think you even got home from Gallagher’s party the other night?  You think you just fucking flew?”  He scoffed and rolled his eyes.  “Oh wait, that’s right, you were so out of it, you probably do.  That’s some fucking girlfriend you got there, fucking ditched your ass and left you for dead!  So tell me,
“What, like you don’t remember?”  Disbelieving, but not quite enough, Dean huffed a bitter laugh.  “Told me to ‘get the fuck out and don’t ever come back.’  Told me if I ever showed my ‘faggot’ ass round there again you wouldn’t go so easy on me.  You damn near killed me, practically beat me to a fuckin’ pulp.  Any of that ringing a bell?”  Dean sniffed, sucking back his own brand of self-loathing, suddenly glassy eyes roving over the cracks in the asphalt.    His father didn’t answer the question, but the silence weighed heavy.  “If I wanted you to know where I was, I’d’ve told you,” he stated bluntly.
Balthazar was talking incessantly about the upscale restaurant-turned-lounge that he made arrangements for them to attend.  “The Heavenly Host,” he had called it.  He was talking too fast for Castiel to pay attention to much of the words; they ended up bleeding together after a while.  Castiel just let him ramble.  They were probably sat for five minutes more before the train lurched forward, but as soon as it had, the voice over the intercom announced they'd have to disembark at the next stop.  They hadn't even made it close to that side of the city.
“Perhaps if all goes well, you can find out for yourself,” he added with a wink just before turning the key in the lock and Dean knew then he looked like a babbling idiot out here on the sidewalk.  “Goodnight, Dean.  I’ll be in touch.”
Fondly, Dean shakes his head, chuckling to himself as he tosses the thing in the garbage and reaches for the filled syringe. He comes to kneel between Cas’ bare feet on the bathmat, hand resting on Cas’ inner thigh, when Cas’ eyes startle open and Dean can’t help the smile ticking the corner of his mouth at the pissbaby look on his friend’s face.
Castiel swallowed, but he didn’t speak.  He wouldn’t play into its mind games anymore than he had to.  He resolved it would be best to just cut to the chase then if he wanted to finish this before Bobby returned home.
Balthazar rolled his eyes as he crossed the room to plant his hands on Castiel’s shoulders.  “It never killed anyone to have a little fun, Cas.”
They agreed to go to the Roadhouse on the grounds that it was close by and Ellen always let them drink for free.  Nabbing a table for four, Dean found himself squeezed into a booth next to Castiel again, with that same blush spreading across his cheeks and down his neck.
Balthazar was his best friend and as pathetic as it would be to admit it out loud, Balthazar was his only friend.  He needed him regardless of the way he was.  So Castiel put up with the selfishness and the incessant monologuing.  And he feigned interest in his gossip and snark.  Sometimes his penchant for doing everything under the influence managed to make things more interesting.  It certainly had the night he met Dean.  Who needed to go on walks?  That was what the fucking train was for!
There was silence.  Then the heavy thud of what Castiel presumed was a power tool dropping to the wood floor.
Dean scrubbed a hand over the back of his neck and blew out a deep breath.  His face looked ten degrees warmer than the rest of him.  “Look, man, I’m sorry.  I swear I’ll go to the laundromat later today, on me.”
“Honestly?  It was the Melissa Etheridge CD in your car, but you should probably keep that ‘Scar Jo’ thing to yourself,” he replies with a judgmental twist of his lips. She rolls her eyes and starts to walk away when he stops her. “No, listen, I- I changed my mind. I actually could use some advice.”
He contemplated as he chewed.  He hummed as he swallowed.  Unsurprisingly, the decision he came to was, “No.”
“Dean, you need to promise me,” Castiel growled over him, “when the time comes, you'll be the one to do it.”
“Hello again, Mr. Winchester,” greeted Castiel, with a hairsbreadth of exasperation coloring his tone.  It was a falsity to disguise the jolt in his blood pressure. “And thank you, but it’s really not much.”
“Hey,” Castiel said after a while, and Dean met his eyes only for him to chew pensively on his lip and deflect. “Nevermind.”
Heading back to the car, Dean settled in behind the wheel feeling a few degrees too warm for such a cold night.  He started up the car and pointedly ignored the torrent of questions pouring in from the backseat the entire drive home.  He figured the smile he couldn’t fight off was answer enough.
With a forced swallow, Dean decides to appeal to him anyway. “Listen, man, I- I messed up. The other night. I dunno who that guy was, but I need you to know I don’t have a problem with you, Cas. Of course, I don’t have a problem with you,” he stresses firmly. “Gay, straight, whatever. You’re my best friend. And I know I’ve been shitty to you lately— I know that— And I—”
They both let out guttural noises in tandem at the heat and the stretch.  The fullness on Castiel’s end.  At letting Dean inside of him.  Dean waited a moment as he panted and Castiel adjusted around him before he started dragging himself out slow and back in even slower.  Barely there jerks of his hips.
Turning his back on him, Balthazar headed for the door.  “Have a wonderful evening, Castiel, I truly hope you’re happy.”
Cas filled Sam in on Dean’s condition on the ride over and right now he’s choosing to accept Dean’s unchanged condition as good news as well.  “All things considered.”
“Just needed to ask her something else, dude,” he was quick to explain.  Too quick in Castiel’s opinion.  “You shouldn’t talk to her like that,” he added disdainfully.
He was a bit frazzled and he had charcoal smears on the front of his button down, having forgotten to wear a smock, but it would have to do.  Pulling open the slideshow about the Sistine Chapel, he was now thankful they’d introduced this the other day because it meant he might be able to finish this lecture with the remaining time.  He requested everyone’s attention to the projector screen and once he finally set his line of sight on the auditorium and began to give his lecture it hit him like a punch to the gut.
Dean chuckled as he shuffled through his dresser for a fresh shirt.  “Dude, when did you go to bed last night?”
“C’mon, Dean, it’s one night of your life!  You can’t wallow in self-pity forever.  Jess and I are really starting to worry about you, dude.”
Cas tosses Sam and Jack a look trying to convey exactly why that would be.  Sam nods, though Jack doesn’t pick up on it.  Fortunately, he doesn’t press her on the subject.
And then Dean was rounding on him again, face so close Castiel could feel the heat radiating off him.  “I’m sorry, you never asked me to?  You never asked me to!?
But his lack of conviction did nothing to dissuade him.  Dean wasn't buying it.  Playfully, he countered, “Why not?”
A stifled moan escaped past his lips when Cas replaced the thumb with two long fingers. Cas considered him forcibly on his knees, tongue weaving between his fingers, for far longer than Dean would’ve liked, before he pulled them out altogether. Dean looked entirely too eager for his own good, but Cas’ expression was the same controlled thing it always was.  Impassive, even, despite the obvious erection now straining in his pants.
