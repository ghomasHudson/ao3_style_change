Sherlock details through what he already knows of her history: former intelligence agent, not English, on the run from something, Magnussen knows her secrets, and she befriended Janine solely to get closer to her blackmailer. She insists that Magnussen should be killed, and John wonders aloud how he didn’t see that she was an assassin. She argues that he did, but married her anyway.
“And that happened...because of me?” John asks, and if Sherlock isn’t mistaken, it seems like John’s voice has gotten deeper and more aroused. Blotches of colour snake up John’s chest and neck and he clears his throat, “Because of what I did?”
. Like a building pressure. Like…like a volcano. The pressure is under the surface and it’s pushing up and up and eventually it has nowhere else to go than to explode.”
Mary demands that John run Sherlock so he knows that things won’t change between them once they’re married. John goes back in to the room and begs Sherlock to find an interesting case for them to work so that he isn’t driven crazy by these wedding details that he doesn’t care about. They agree on The Bloody Guardsman and Mary gives them both a thumbs up, having been working both boys to take the other out on a case.
Sherlock nodded, conceding that the thought had merit. When his hand wrapped around his cock, he hissed and his hips bucked upwards, “Oh…” he moaned quietly in wonderment.
“Oh, right, clearly,” Watson stresses sarcastically, “Why were they sharing plates of food? If I remember correctly, you barely ate on this trip at all, as per usual.”
“A truly dreadful plan,” Holmes says, deducing Sherlock’s thought process (supposedly sharing a brain with the man, it’s not that difficult).
Sherlock sighs at his lover’s sentimentality, running his right hand through John’s hair reassuringly.
She doesn’t say anything, simply slow blinks at Holmes as though she’s dismissing countless retorts about the absurdity of that scenario.
“Of course you did, you git,” John assured him, cupping Sherlock’s jaw in his hand, “You were perfect.”
John inhales sharply to hear it spoken aloud and reflexively looks towards his closed door, expecting to see Sherlock standing there. He’s not.
“John is going to punch Sherlock again,” he says in a tone which implies that he supports the decision after seeing John’s reaction to the realization.
“It’s about time! I’m dehydrating over here!” Bill needles, grabbing one of the drinks from Sherlock’s hand and gulping a third of it down in one go.
Sherlock goes on to explain how she chose to wound him and knock out Magnussen instead of killing them both and making it appear as though John had done it. She phoned for the ambulance after walking out, ensuring that it would get to him in time.
Sherlock huffed and wiped the come away before placing it in his mouth and sucking, “Not terrible. I don’t see what all the fuss is about.”
“No,” Watson shakes his head resolutely, “There’s a difference between thrill seeking and choosing to love a hired killer.”
Bill is, of course, getting married to his long-term girlfriend, Bridget. David is already married to a woman he was with before he deployed; they have two kids and sound happy. Alan and John are both divorced (John even made it through his portion without having to get all dramatic and lay out all of the crazy details), and Zach has never been able to tie anyone down - male or female, he specifies to no one's surprise.
John smirks, "It's designed for battery efficiency; since it's just a reader with e-ink and not a smart device, a charge lasts for weeks."
Sherlock blinked rapidly and cleared his throat a bit before meeting his eyes and admitting, “Of course I knew,” with a bit of defensiveness towards his brilliance, “I just didn’t think you were ready to admit it yet.”
Sherlock lets his shoulders fall back down, unaware that his discomfort had raised them in the first place, “Alright.”
He runs his right thumb over Sherlock’s left cheekbone and smiles when the still-sleeping man lifts his face, like a cat seeking more attention.
“Show me,” Sherlock repeated calmly, “those wretched videos aren’t anything like reality, and I need to understand why and how it all works.”
Magnussen pees in their fireplace, refusing to work with the genius. He leaves the flat and Sherlock goes in to a bout of deductions about how the letters must be here in London, then leaves to do some shopping.
Sherlock leans down to be able to hide his still-embarrassed face in John’s neck before whispering, “John,” in a tone that’s completely new to both of their ears.
John looked up from the paper and turned his head to the left to see his friend, “I’m not really sure,” he admitted.
John tried to clear his mind of all the arguments of why this was Not Good and focussed instead on the long, pale fingers which were now wrapping around Sherlock’s cock, stroking it and keeping it hard whilst Sherlock tilted his head, obviously waiting for his next prompt.
“I mean it. Utterly brilliant,” he continues, “I could watch you solve crimes all day and be perfectly happy.”
There is this one particular day that stands out in my memory. I look back on it now and I…there’s this strange juxtaposition of fondness and aching melancholy.
I didn't see this happening. I really didn't. But, here you are: five chapters of different sleep "ailments" and how they affect our boys.
“You can’t possibly mean…” but he couldn’t bring himself to voice it aloud. Could they have possibly been hiding from each other all these years?
Sherlock hears the faint sound of the door to the street opening and closing nearly silently. Mycroft must have seen her in route via CCTV and sent Lestrade to investigate. Though Sherlock hadn’t ever observed the man to move this silently - he apparently knew exactly which parts of which stairs to avoid so as not to make a single sound - he figures that he must possess these skills to have become a detective inspector.
Then, just as sudden, the sadness gives way to anger. He is furious with John for staying in such a situation when he could simply leave and return to him and Baker Street at any time. Why hasn’t he?
After a few minutes of silence, Sherlock whispers the answer he couldn’t before, “I had lost you. My nightmares are always about something happening to you.”
He still looks uncertain about whether he should believe Sherlock or not, but he agrees hesitantly anyway, “Alright then.”
Sherlock’s eyes hold a veritable array of conflicting emotions and questions and longings that John has no hope of even beginning to read, but he nods and answers with a quiet, honest, “Of course.”
They watch Sherlock spruce up the apartment after John makes an off-handed comment about the clutter. They watch Sherlock celebrate another murder – not an uncommon thing for Holmes to do – before waltzing out the door.
John falls to his knees between Sherlock’s spread legs, running his hands from knees up to the button and fly of the other man’s trousers now. John grabs the fabric of both trousers and pants, pulling gently at first to try to avoid causing any discomfort to the other man’s cock, while Sherlock lifts his hips to aid their departure.
Standing in the small group, Sherlock was arguing with a large, pasty-faced whale of a man who was pointing his thick finger into Sherlock's face, practically foaming at the mouth whilst Sherlock argued back. John felt his hair immediately stand on end, his anger building to bursting point as he clenched his fists and walked outside.
John smiles brightly and closes his eyes briefly while he allows himself to believe the words for the first time in his life. He opens them again, “I love you, too, Sherlock.”
They all sit down: Bill, Alan, and Zach on one side and Sherlock, John, and David on the other. Mostly the five former soldiers chat about old stories and “remember when”s as Sherlock happily sits taking in all of the small details about a John-before-Sherlock.
“And when she died?” Watson asks quietly, “Why not then? Why not give me a reason to believe in something worth living for again?”
“They’re nothing spectacular,” Holmes lies. He secretly holds his parents in high regard, even if they do tend to smother him occasionally.
Sherlock comes seconds later, untouched, and John’s orgasm is brought on quickly as his alpha side preens to have caused it to happen.
Wiggins moves on to deducing further about John’s cycling to work by noticing that his shirt has creases, as though it’s been folded.
an arse,” John grumps but calms down, “here, let me help you grab the rest of these,” he says, but before grabbing any pints, he lays his hand where Zach’s had been moments before and dares to look Sherlock in the eye, “Are we okay?”
What he sees when he opens it is nothing like what he expected. He expected scrawling notes of observations, or maths equations, or drawings of plants…anything but what he actually finds: confessions.
John began thrusting again, but he was definitely curious, “Oh yeah? Tell me another one,” he challenged.
“I saw you standing over here all alone, and I just thought…” but she doesn’t get any further as Sherlock returns and nonchalantly hands John his new glass of bubbly. John watches as her eyes take in the not-the-same-shade-of-blue-but-might-as-well-be compliments of his and Sherlock’s outfits before she’s stuttering out an apology, “Oh, I’m so sorry! I had no idea.”
All John had wanted to do when Sherlock returned from the dead was to never let him leave his sight ever again. But Sherlock caught him at an awkward moment that - while not a completed marriage proposal - could not be undone and John was angry at him for leaving and John had grieved for so long and…
“No, he is dating,” Mr. Holmes answered, “He’s bringing him up to meet us next month when they get time off. He says that his boyfriend is extremely busy. High profile job, from what I hear…”
This time, when Sherlock’s lips trace timidly from his cheek to his mouth, he pulls him closer instead of pushing him away.
I'm clearly a music nerd, recognizing the thing about The Planets (and legitimately becoming upset by it each time I rewatch).
Greg, Sally, and some more police officers arrive at the Tower of London to find Moriarty inside the glass case, wearing the crown jewels and sitting on the throne. He cheekily proclaims that there was no rush.
The next day, as Sherlock reviews the footage, he’s a bit surprised by what he finds. Physically they stayed close, even doing what most would classify as “cuddling”, but it’s the talking that catches him off guard. John had of course mentioned that he talks in his sleep at times, but Sherlock was unaware that
Holmes sighs as though put upon before replying, “Yes, but if it’s a video about Jupiter, why are they playing
“They’re challenge coins,” John explains quietly, “they’re handed out upon merit. I got my Armed Forces one upon joining the squadron, as a unity tool. Once I earned my rank of Captain, the Medical Corps honored me with one of theirs.”
John crossed his legs, fussing with the fraying edges of his robe as he considered his words, “It was really that bad?”
The song the boys dance to is one that I (Kittie) adore, the second song is one which Goddess added.
out, much less any of the million words that have been left unsaid between him and his deceased friend.
John shook his head, still smiling, and dropped his head to kiss Sherlock again, “Alright, git,” he whispered fondly, nudging their noses together briefly before moving to support himself above his body once more.
Hope you caught/enjoyed the parallel of Sherlock/John deciding whether to watch the movies same as Holmes/Watson did in the last fic!
But Holmes knows that isn’t it at all. Anyone else who has tried to make him more personable has always been belittled in return; he’s only ever allowed Watson to do it. Why? Because Watson is a special case all his own, in many respects, which is what has led Holmes to acknowledge that he is in love with the other man. There’s no other explanation for it.
Sherlock freezes, he can feel the throbbing in his hugely erect penis, precome dripping out into his silk boxers to stain and mark the fabric. It’s too much, the sensations are too enormous for someone to deal with. He can’t -- he can’t -- Oh god.
“Oh,” John says quietly before looking at the floor. He can feel Sherlock’s gaze still on him, but can’t bring himself to meet the mostly empty eyes.
to – and I’m glad you found happiness again. But it doesn’t make the lump in my throat any less bitter: the lump that has longed to finally confess that I love you, now that it’s too late for you to possibly consider returning the sentiment.
Holmes groans at the poor come-on, but it’s also tinged with the tiniest bit of interest as his traitorous cock agrees that it
Sensing the positive response, Sherlock proceeded to take the right testicle into his mouth, lavishing it with attention as he played with the weight, rolling it slightly on his tongue.
They stand awkwardly, waiting for the other to reveal what was so enlightening, but they’re scared that somehow the message was different.
"Power's out," John informs Sherlock when he goes back downstairs in his dry clothes. He's still cold, but it's a start.
“But you don’t know him like I do. He doesn’t do these sorts of feelings. I don’t know if he’s even capable of it.”
Kissing Sherlock’s leg once more, John leaned forward and breathed hot air across Sherlock’s tip, moving in to messily kiss the leaking head as his eyes flicked to Sherlock’s face. Sensing Sherlock’s impatience
Without fully thinking it through, John scoots higher up on the bed with his pillow, making Sherlock’s head fall just about at shoulder height. He then closes the minimal space that separates their bodies and gently (as gently as he can manage when the scenario calls for him to place his still slightly-aching arm under the other man’s head) settles Sherlock on top of his left side.
Sure, it wasn’t a flat-out declaration, but a declaration all the same. Personally I’m just proud of myself for not waxing poetic about how you were…are…forever will be…that famous happy ending for me that they talk about in those stupid romantic movies.
John wakes to knocking on the door. One of their neighbors’ sons with a drug habit has gone missing. John offers to go retrieve him and Mary insists on coming along – pregnant or not. They arrive at the crack den and John places a tire iron down his trousers.
Sherlock gracefully stands from the floor when he hears the door close, folding the ring in to his right fist as he takes her seat. With a confused rumble, the restaurant resumes its noises, trying to cover the awkwardness of an unanswered marriage proposal.
I honestly can’t remember who started the kiss, but suddenly you’re in my lap, kissing me as though you have never wanted anything more.
“What?” Sherlock asked, confused, but desperately wanting John to resume fucking him instead of dealing with all this talking.
The next few seconds stretched out in a slow dance of tongues and kisses, the only sound in the room being their breathing and the soft click of their kiss before John slowly began to push inside, inch by inch, as slowly as he could, only stopping when he was halfway inside.
Sherlock’s hands tighten on John’s legs for a moment before he lifts his red eyes to examine John’s face reverently.
At one point, Sherlock grumbles in annoyance at being pushed around and, still asleep, rolls on to his right side so that he’s now facing John. This obviously makes the snoring louder, because science. John growls angrily as he rolls on to his left side, facing Sherlock with mere inches between them.
Watson stares at the side of his face in shock for a few moments longer before he’s drawn back to the telly himself.
A few sentences from John Watson’s mouth, however, and Sherlock Holmes knows/knew what was happening before the vest was even exposed.
They share a smile, Watson squeezes the other man’s hand, and then their hands both drop as they turn back to the telly.
“Well, get some sleep. It'll be a long day tomorrow,” John smiled, reaching over to squeeze Sherlock's hand, “You know where I am if you need me.”
John is silent as he gathers his courage to vocalize a question he’s not entirely certain he wants an answer to, “What the hell do you
John chuckled fondly at his utter innocence, “It’s woefully inadequate,” he said, watching as Sherlock’s face turned guarded at the perceived slight, “but ‘partner’ might better describe it.”
Sherlock looks confused as he snatches the last case from the other man’s hands to read it. John merely rolls his eyes and places the other three cases in a different spot on the table.
And if John will not allow him to sign his letters, he decides that he will end them all the same from here on out.
“Tell me to stop if it’s too much,” John whispered, his hand moving to stroke a lock of hair away from Sherlock’s sweaty forehead.
Greg laughed as he sat back on his sofa and laid his gun aside, aware of his nakedness only being covered by a stag patterned cushion, “You’re a bloody madman.”
Sherlock locks eyes with him a bit guiltily, unsure what to do now that his consciousness has reclaimed its hold. To his horror, Sherlock’s hips thrust forward of their own volition, reminding both men that their erections have not abated one iota. They both moan and John can’t help himself as he dives in to claim Sherlock’s lips with his own, his right hand moving from his cheek to the back of his head to hold him tight. Sherlock moans deep in his throat as John pulls slightly at his hair, same as in his dream.
John is looking at evidence pictures and recognizes the wax seal from the envelope he picked up earlier. Sherlock makes the connection to the tale of Hansel and Gretel and the poisoned chocolate they must be eating. Sherlock, with the aid of his homeless network, discovers the location of the children. They arrive at Addleston and bring the children in to the police department for questioning.
They stood staring at each other for another half a minute before Sherlock abruptly took off towards the door.
I regret how obvious it is that The Blind Banker is my least favorite episode. I skimped a bit on this one, and for that I apologize. They definitely become more detailed after this one, I promise.
. He is given a box as a gift which he deduces contains diamond cufflinks and he callously points out that all his cuffs have buttons. John translates his dismissal in to polite human for the gifter, forcing Sherlock to say “Thank You” himself.
a scratchy sensation which usually meant the information had been deleted, “Nope,” he said with a shake of his head.
“Nope,” John shook his head, standing and walking to the hallway where he collected his coat and shoes before turning back to Sherlock, “I’m going away now. To forget this.”
John walks out in to the night and sees the Morse code message again, so he goes to investigate. What he finds is quite mentally scarring and he’d rather delete it but doesn’t know how.
"I wouldn't say I prefer it - there's still no comparison for a new book smell and flipping the pages - but sometimes I want to read a thousand-page Stephen King novel without carrying all 1,000 pages around."
John’s eyes shoot open in embarrassment at having been caught, his hand pulling from himself quickly in reflex, “Sherlock…shit, sorry.”
John’s eyes shine with affection as he lifts one side of his mouth in a reassuring smirk, “We’ll have plenty of time to talk this out while I’m being seen to,” he tells him before leaning back in for a gentle, fleeting, affirming kiss.
“Yes, there was no skill to it like this shows, he was merely hoping for fate to keep him safe. It worked many times before, and I am glad you came along for me.”
Sherlock and Mycroft continue discussing the imminent terrorist bombing, but all Sherlock cares about is getting back in to London and seeing John. Sherlock is handed a file and sees the picture of John with his facial hair for the first time.
Scene change to Sherlock talking to Anderson and a camera, detailing the Lazarus plan that resulted in his not dying after jumping off the roof of a building. Anderson isn’t quite convinced by the story, saying it could have been done better. While he’s working out the details that don’t quite add up, Sherlock sneaks out.
of the conversations we have could fall into that category,” Sherlock smirked in return, causing John to laugh and Sherlock to smile in relief.
“Say my name,” Sherlock requested on a whisper, his pupils wide as he watched John’s hand moving up and down, twisting at the tip to coax out more precome, “When you ejaculate, say my name.”
Moriarty goes on about how much Sherlock is going to enjoy being dead - how wonderful it is – but that people will miss him.
The next morning Sherlock finds John eating breakfast outside and they discuss the case. John asks him what happened in the lab, slowly coming to the realization that Sherlock drugged - or, rather,
“Shhhh,” Holmes cuts him off, feeling something different about what’s playing out but he can’t yet put his finger on it.
“Sleep,” he says, knowing he can’t send his friend back to his shared dorm. Not that he thinks he’ll do anything untoward with the others, but because he needs to make sure he’s alright through the night.
Is this what loving someone feels like? He’s never been in love, only theorized it enough to be able to fake it for cases in the past. But, if he had to place a descriptor on his feelings for his best friend, the ache in his chest demands that the word be: besotted.
This chapter is not a song-fic, but anyone who is familiar with "Fantasies Come True" from the musical Avenue Q will notice some familiar lines. I consider it an homage, and I in no way mean any harm by their inclusion.
Sherlock smiles sadly at the gesture, knowing John’s train of thought without him even needing to speak. He has not used drugs since the middle of the Magnussen case. As soon as John came back in to his life - including moving back in to 221B after things fell through with Mary - he had no need for them. Love and admiration are the new drugs, and John is his only dealer. He rolls his eyes at his own teenage poetic sentimentality, but John doesn’t notice as he moves back to his left arm.
Sherlock and John make their way back to Baker Street, flat 221C, and find the sneakers of Carl Powers.
Magnussen returns to his home, down in to what appears to be an archive, and finds Lady Smallwood’s file. After refreshing his memory, he finds her in her office and threatens to release the letters that her husband wrote to an underage girl. Magnussen licks her face (to prove that he can) and both Holmes and Watson shudder. Lady Smallwood, on her way home, decides abruptly to seek the assistance of Sherlock Holmes to end the blackmail on her.
Sherlock and Molly go to the flat of the client who left his hat. Sherlock returns it and then discusses the security footage of one of Sherlock’s rats/markers on the tube, somehow disappearing between one stop and the next.
They’re pulled back to the screen when Sherlock is talking to Molly about how to not get completely vomitus during their stag night pub crawl.
They look back down at the discs for a moment before Sherlock speaks up again, “So, shall we watch them, then?”
Sherlock catches them a cab as effortlessly as he ever does and they sit with a respectable distance between them, hands to themselves.
Sherlock and Molly leave the client’s flat and part ways with the agreement that such a day will not happen again. Watson wants to add that it won’t happen again because Sherlock has John and doesn’t need Molly, in any way whatsoever, but tamps it down because of how jealous it sounds.
But no, just as he thinks it, Sherlock lets out an even louder snore than before. John’s eyes shoot open as his jaw clenches again. John reaches out and pushes at Sherlock’s arm, not entirely certain what his game plan was for the move. To move him back to his left side? To wake him up so they can both be miserable? Either way, it’s not an entirely kind move to make, but John couldn’t care less at the moment.
It only takes a few minutes of John running his hand through Sherlock’s unmanageable curls before the lankier man wakes.
The door to the street opens almost immediately; you pause briefly to remove your coat. My heart races as I hear your cautious footsteps and reflect that 17 stairs have never taken this long to climb before. I stand from the couch and watch the door with warring feelings of trepidation and hope.
Sherlock disappears downstairs and John returns to reading his Nook - finally activating the backlight. John looks up again about ten minutes later when Sherlock bursts back into the flat with empty hands and a scowling face.
” as his right hand comes up to grasp the back of John’s head to hold him closer. His hips jerk reflexively upwards while his left hand presses John’s hips down, causing the older man to moan in to his neck as their cocks rub together through the fabric of their trousers. It’s not a spot with a freckle, but John doesn’t stray from it until he’s driven Sherlock mad with desire and has left a mark of his own on the milky expanse.
John…especially not after all the things he’s put him through. He allows himself exactly one moment to close his eyes and shake his head against the pain at the thought before he rolls over to grab his phone from the night stand.
John doesn’t have a good grasp on his friend’s hand in return, but he squeezes back reassuringly as best he can. As John unknowingly begins to drift off, face turned away from the other man, Sherlock speaks up again.
So we meet in secret and I act as though I don’t hate the fact that she makes you sneak around with me. You keep promising that things won’t be different when you’re married, but don’t you see? They already
In his mind, Sherlock keeps hearing words in John’s voice but the John above him hasn’t moved his mouth at all, has simply frozen staring at him hungrily. When he feels a hand on his left cheek without John moving his arm, he is shocked to realize that maybe - just maybe - the noises and touches are coming from outside of his mind, which would mean…
Two years ago John had injured his right leg and left shoulder in a Quidditch accident. It ended his time as a (very good) Chaser, but he didn’t mind too much; he always knew he wasn’t going to play Quidditch forever and the injury allowed him to start focusing more on his post-graduate plans of studying medicine.
After the hug and clapping end, Sherlock goes in to funny stories of his time with John, which consists mostly of John’s overly romanticized blog accounts of their adventures, and the stag night.
The last window catches John off guard so much that the smile falls from his face as the air is stolen from his lungs.
Sherlock leads John to seeing Mary as a client (skipping over “My lying wife” and “The woman who’s carrying my child who has lied to me since the day I met her”). The look on John’s face is completely manic as he assumes his natural role as assistant to Sherlock - only, for the first time ever, John’s empathy for the client is less than Sherlock’s.
As John’s left hand moved to Sherlock’s chest, finding his right nipple through his t-shirt and teasing it through the thin fabric, Sherlock bucked again. He was already closer to an orgasm than he had ever been while awake, and the feelings were so intensely powerful and almost overwhelming. It was becoming clearer by the second: Sherlock’s body wanted this, and Sherlock wanted it to be with John.
“More alcohol?” Sherlock asks with distaste, feeling an intense dislike for his new-found enemy that loosens his tongue too far.
This story honestly took me nearly a month to complete. I think it was just hard for me to think of John in a situation like this and all the emotions that went in to it.
“Did you just ask for my hand by proposing to my father?” Sherlock asked, still with a vague look of being offline.
Outside the door, Sherlock’s brain had skidded offline. He could still hear the sounds of John’s self-pleasure. The slick sound of flesh combined with John’s deep groaning seemed to echo around Sherlock’s mind palace, spreading out and sticking to every surface so that Sherlock was unable to walk the corridors without hearing his name being wantonly moaned.
John swallows thickly as he pulls him closer and entwines their legs. He places his lips against Sherlock’s wild curls before whispering vehemently, “I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Alright, Sherlock,” John easily flipped the switch to his flirtatious bedroom demeanor, “take your pants off.”
John walked around Regent’s Park for an hour before deciding he needed to return to the flat as it was starting to get cold and his shoulder ached. Walking back into the living room, he found Sherlock in the exact same position he had left him in.
John looks up at him suddenly, looking as though Sherlock brought him out of a trance with the words. His hand stills, continuing to hold the other man’s.
The pair enters the flat, removing coats and placing them on the rack as normal. As though nothing is at all different. They silently ascend the 17 steps to the flat where John sits in his chair while Sherlock begins to pace while thinking.
“Someone once told me that skin to skin contact is the best way to treat hypothermia,” John says as a way to distract himself from the beautiful sight before him.
“We know it’s hard to believe,” Watson assures her after a few more seconds of uncomfortable silence.
“Shhh,” John whispered, smiling as he pretended that Sherlock’s cock was his own and doing his own routine (two long strokes followed by a thumb across the wet slit). Sherlock’s breathing hitched, deep groans resonating from the detective’s chest which rumbled through to John’s own skin as he worked, stroking and caressing the small bundle of nerves under the head in a circular motion. Sherlock’s hips shuddered, a shiver running through his body as he let his head fall backwards onto John’s shoulder with a hum of pleasure.
to lose her, and the cancer took her quick, but at least I had a warning and time to come to terms with it. But with you…” he trails off, eyes casting down to the floor once more, “you were just
It takes him a second to gather his courage before he whispers, “Because you were just going to leave again.”
Inspector Jones, for his part, did not appear to notice that neither of us were very receptive to his tone, so he continued on as though we were in on some joke with him, “From what I can figure, the two perverts left that bathhouse there,” he said while pointing to the nearby building, “probably after they engaged in their indecent behavior after having just met, and were murdered on the spot,” he finished speaking almost as though he believed they deserved to be killed.
Irene texts Sherlock, letting him know that she’s not dead, and both John and Irene are surprised to hear the text alert moaning nearby. Sherlock strides out, unsure what to make of the conversation he just overheard. He arrives back at Baker Street and notices that the door has been forced. He deduces that Mrs. Hudson has been dragged up the stairs against her will.
With a kiss to Sherlock’s hair and a jaw-cracking yawn from them both, they finally rest comfortably in each other’s arms.
They flash through a number of their cases (The Hollow Client, The Poisoned Giant, the mysterious matchbox case, a generic love affair, and The Elephant in the Room) before Sherlock goes in to full detail of The Bloody Guardsman.
Holmes doesn’t answer, because he’s entranced by the body language on the screen. He can feel the tension building up.
John briefly stood from the bed again to remove his boxers and shirt, then hesitated on where to settle on the bed. The sitting position he had been in wasn’t ideal for a wank, but anywhere else seemed too…
to undress John; to have the experience for the other man to call upon because those are the rules of this game, aren’t they?
“Oh, fuck,” John moans, hips slamming harder against Sherlock as he hears the curse escape the lips of this overly refined, bespoke-suit-wearing, posh Adonis below him. He really can’t believe his luck.
That’s when the idea takes hold in Watson’s brain. It’s so simple; why hadn’t he thought of it before? He’s so caught up in the idea that he hardly registers Mycroft finally leaving them alone in the flat.
no case. If you must know, I’m going to text Lestrade in the cab to tell him to clean this mess up before we get back and offer to answer questions for him in the meantime. You are not to talk to anyone about this until you’ve been treated by a doctor,” he adds seriously.
Sherlock falls asleep on the floor as John falls asleep against a support pipe. Tessa calls Sherlock’s name (waking John) before the landlord bodily handles Sherlock in to a kneeling position. John instinctively moves to place himself between Sherlock and the landlord protectively.
Holmes rolls his eyes and Sherlock swallows thickly, nervous. He has spent so long avoiding deducing John’s feelings because he doesn’t want to find them absent. But this is giving him hope, which is absolutely terrifying.
He had gotten the message from Bill Murray a week ago; he was getting married and wanted to meet up for a night out with the old gang, could he make it?
“But you lived here? As a child?” John continued to ask, seeming to be stunned at the sheer size. It looked like something from an old documentary he had watched about royalty.
But, Sherlock reasons, if he can work the experiment like a lie-detector test by asking easily corroborated questions, he should be able to tell that way. He spends the rest of the day coming up with a plan, as well as a list of questions for the night.
Then Sherlock begins to deduce him about the events of this morning – his train ride and breakfast – and asking him what had happened last night to bring him to London. While Henry appears to be impressed by Sherlock, as most people are at first, John looks exasperated at the direction that his own life has taken.
Holmes softens immediately, “I don’t know why Sherlock can’t seem to grasp what it is that John needs; maybe it’s Mary being in the picture and he’s not certain where he fits in himself now. I don’t know. But I assure you that it’s as insufferable for me to watch as it is for you.”
“And did you talk to him first? Or just demand he whips his impressive willy out?” Lestrade asked, raising an eyebrow as though already aware of the answer.
“I’ve heard,” John replied, turning to pick up their bags only to see them already disappearing into the house with the staff.
“Freak thinks he’s some sort of proper genius,” Sally sneers, “and Sidekick over there thinks Freak hung the moon.”
“Dull,” Sherlock complained, taking a sip of his tea and putting it aside, “It's probably another of those tedious fan letters.”
The car arrives at Battersea and John walks inside, thinking he’s talking to Mycroft but is faced with Irene. John asks her to tell Sherlock that she’s alive; surely that would fix everything for his friend, if he just knew. They have witty banter back and forth where John presents as jealous and Irene – joining the ranks of, well, everyone – insists that they’re a couple. Their own experience at Battersea did not include the innuendo.
“Oh, but I am,” he assures, then steps a little closer, “and you know what I think?” Sherlock shakes his head, “I think you dressed us in closely matching blues on purpose; you
When he finally came back to full awareness - although still trembling hard - Sherlock had the good grace to feel sheepish at not having lasted longer, even considering it was his first-ever conscious orgasm. One look at John’s face put his fears to rest, however; John was smiling at him like he’s never seen anything more stunning and couldn’t possibly be any more pleased at his good fortune.
Sherlock considers. He’s not done going through the case in his mind, perturbed with himself for having gotten John hurt when all he wanted to do was help him. Yes, it wasn’t really much of an injury but... “Maybe in a bit. Feel free to sleep in your own bed tonight if you’d like.”
“You may attempt it, but I doubt it will work,” Sherlock responded flippantly, even as his body tilted his head to the side to grant better access to the doctor.
I shook my head, “No, I’m alright,” I told him with a smile, but it was not genuine and I knew that he could see that.
John is still panting, but slowly getting his breathing under control. His muscles ache from being tense and he stares tiredly at the ceiling instead of Sherlock’s eyes because he is just so mentally and physically exhausted. Once he calms, Sherlock finally speaks.
Watson crosses his arms and performs an honest-to-God pout, remembering that he’s already been planning to shave later. And if the look on Holmes’ face is anything to go by, he knows it, too.
“Oh god, Sherlock,” John groaned, back arching. His orgasm rushing at him rapidly as he moved his other hand down to cup at his tight testicles, it was too much and John knew he wouldn’t be able to hold on, “Oh, Sherlock…Sherlock I’m…I’m coming.”
“Well, tonight will certainly take a bit of acting for your friends not to completely despise me and kick me out of the group within five minutes,” he smiles while grabbing his coat and draping it over his arm, “but I’m quite good at what I do.”
“How does it feel?” Sherlock asked, his eyes wide and flicking across John’s body up and down and over his entire skin.
Holmes knows, with a drop of his stomach, that he’s trying to make his disappearance easier on John. When he fakes his death – as he’s certain Sherlock will do, same as he did – and disappears without a word, he thinks it’ll be easier for John if he believes the lies. He only wants John not to hurt. But Holmes can’t voice this answer, so he doesn’t voice one at all.
John sighs heavily in frustration at not being allowed to return to sleep when this man - this incredibly warm, comforting man still in his arms - denied him rest for so long last night before answering, “It was the only way to shut you up.”
Flash forward to Christmas and a celebration they’re hosting in 221B that Holmes and Watson never did. Sherlock is playing the violin, John is in an ugly jumper, and all around everyone appears to be having a grand old time. Sherlock tries to thank John’s new girlfriend and ends up insulting her by going through the list of all of John’s recent paramours while trying to remember her name.
He stands from the bed and goes over to a box that appears to be chaotically filled with journals. Some he recognizes from next to experiments on the kitchen table, some from the pockets of his Belstaff, but one in particular draws his eye. It’s a small, compact journal made of a scarlet faux-suede. It’s hideous. He picks it up with reverence, his head swimming slightly at the wrongness of invading Sherlock’s privacy.
does – but simply makes little puffing sounds every fifth breath, and he’s bound to drool on his pillow.
Sherlock explains that hound may be an acronym instead of one word before he spots Greg in the pub. Greg pretends to be on holiday, though he’s clearly just come back from one.
The opening scene of the third “episode” starts with something that didn’t transpire in their dimension.
John Watson was maybe the first person to ever think so highly of Sherlock Holmes consistently; who never defaulted to thinking he was an uncaring arse who meant to hurt people. John Watson, in many ways, had saved Sherlock Holmes. Now it was his turn to do the same, and for the first time in his life, he put someone else before himself, without hesitation.
“What, correcting grammar left and right and refusing to assist a murderer to get off of a legitimate charge?”
After another minute of pursuit, the murderer changes tactics. He stops suddenly and doubles over, causing John to fly over him on to the pavement. John groans as he lies on his back, attempting to get his breath back. Before he can, the suspect has him standing in his arms, held steady as a knife is placed against his neck hard enough to draw a bit of blood.
Sherlock, John, Mary, Isaac, and Wiggins make their way to St. Bart’s so that Molly can perform a drug test on Sherlock to see if he really did partake in drug use. She slaps him when it’s proven that he has.
Up in the girls’ dormitory, Sherlock finds an unmarked envelope with a red wax seal – same as the one John found earlier – and withdraws a book of fairy tales from it. They make their way to the boys’ dormitory and discover that he had hidden by his bed to attempt to avoid the intruder, writing “Help us” on the wall in linseed oil, as well as tracking it on his shoes. The boy liked crime stories so knew of the trick with linseed oil and black lights. They follow the footsteps down the hall until the oil ran out and the footsteps no longer show. As Sherlock collects a sample of the oil, John admonishes him for his timing of good cheer.
John and Mycroft sit at a table and the older Holmes explains that Irene is dead. They discuss how to break it to Sherlock – what to tell him – because he appears not to feel things but surely that’s not entirely true.
“They prefer to go by Sherlock and John, apparently,” Holmes replies, though it’s not of much consequence, really.
“Should I take a gift?” Sherlock asked a few days later, obviously clicking around the internet in boredom, “For Professor Ellis?”
“Yes, really; I too was young once,” he belittles, “and as hard as it is to believe, I wasn’t always comfortable being myself around people, so I tried to fit in to the moulds that society has placed on us. They never went anywhere or lasted very long, though.”
“No idea how Moriarty knew what Magnussen saw when he looked at people. As we both are aware, Magnussen simply
Unlike this alternate Anderson, he really had nothing to do with driving Holmes to fake his death so is still working closely with New Scotland Yard.
look. As he opens his mouth to belittle him, John waves his hand dismissively and turns towards his room once more, “No, forget it. I’ll come back.”
The four strangers go slack-jawed while John merely smiles brightly at him, shaking his head in amusement. Sherlock can’t help but smile back at him.
This is not the sequel I ever imagined writing for A Change of Perspective. You do need to have read that first for this story to make sense. Sorry about that!
The piece ends and I give another, impromptu, speech. Whatever compelled me to do it, I’m not certain; maybe I simply wanted to have your eyes on me again. Who knows? But then I experience one more deduction than I had been anticipating.
John gets Sherlock to admit that his parents knew that he had faked his death, thus explaining their absence from the funeral, and Sherlock shouts out an apology. Then he apologizes again, more sincerely this time, before moving on fairly quickly to the now-absent moustache.
Watson doesn’t want to continue the conversation for fear that his own romantic feelings towards Holmes will be revealed somehow. He’s not upset that Sherlock and John appear to be exceedingly comfortable around each other, he’s upset about how easy they make it look.
They continue to search for the discs but are unsuccessful, and they begrudgingly head to their berating half an hour later.
“I'm sorry about the photos,” John said rapidly, closing the door behind him and moving to the edge of Sherlock's bed, “I didn't want to look rude in front of your parents and…I was a bit curious. You always seem like you were born at 30; I couldn't imagine you as a kid.”
Sherlock backs up against the window without realizing. He is now too far from his only true weapon, but there are objects within arms reach that he could throw if necessary. But he finds himself lacking the will to fight her any longer; he’s been doing it for so long and he’s
Sherlock, while pleased beyond words at the outcome, is still a bit shy about all of the attention on them and is instead ignoring all of their stares to simply take in every detail of the side of John’s face.
“He’s not,” Sherlock frowned in return, “he’s obviously bisexual. That is a real thing you know, being attracted to both.”
Watson understands now, of course, has never questioned it since. Whether the talk opened Holmes’ eyes to how he comes across or some other stroke of fate, he tends to hide his compassion less frequently, at least from Watson.
Sherlock hesitates, even with the prompting, “Do you love him?” he asks quietly before clarifying, “Sherlock, I mean.”
And that’s just the distraction needed; in fact, if Sherlock doesn’t act now, he’s liable to be shot for the statement. He lunges for her knees, hoping to tackle her and remove the gun from her hand before she can use it, but it doesn’t quite work out that way.
Watson lifts his left hand to stop him and shakes his head slightly, “No, that’s not the point I’m trying to make,” Holmes gives him a quizzical look, “Doesn’t it seem odd to you that Mary would know it?”
Holmes finds himself once more wishing he could slap his alternate self. Honestly, could the man be any more bloody obvious about his feelings? He’s helping plan the entire wedding, worrying about details that the happy couple aren’t even concerned about, simply so that the day can be perfect for John. Holmes understands his thinking: if John has chosen to be with Mary - and not him - then he will do everything he can to make it a day worthy of the man. He would do anything for John to be happy after all that he’s put him through.
The younger man moves to the couch and sits down, eyeing the case with unease, “That’s preposterous.”
“I hate you,” Sherlock mumbled, although John wasn't sure if Sherlock was aiming that at his father, or John himself.
After one of our last dance lessons, you goaded me in to admitting that I love you as you were stalling to leave. You played it off as a light hearted joke (
“Yes yes, fine,” Holmes concedes, hand waving dismissively as he returns his attention to the telly.
“But this one,” he places the first coin down to lightly trace the case of the other, as though afraid to actually touch it again, “it holds more sentimental value for you. You choose not to carry it where it can get damaged, hence keeping it protected and in your wallet.”
John wakes up in the unlit bonfire - groggy, disoriented, and unable to move - and attempts to call for help but can’t.
John opened his mouth wider and pushed more of his lover inside, controlling his breathing to ensure he didn’t choke or gag
She pauses just inside the doorway and turns to them again, “It’d be nice, you know,” she starts and only gets quizzical looks in return, “celebrating Christmas together, I mean.”
“Drugs, gloryhole, whore house,” Mycroft listed, “any of the numerous things he tried before. I’m following him on CCTV right now and so far he’s just wandering aimlessly around the park, but John…” he trailed off, clear worry evident in his voice.
Sherlock talks her through his deductions about her past; where Mary Morstan came from, realizing all the signs he overlooked as they came up. He asks her how good a shot she is, she threatens to shoot him again, but throws a coin in the air and shoots that instead. Sherlock appears from behind her, the other end of the tiny hallway from the shadowed figure she had been addressing.
“You’re so bloody impatient!” John grumbled in response, but quickly slicked his hands with lube and began to carefully - and softly - press his index finger into Sherlock’s body. The detective’s breathing hitched and he winced, dropping his hands to the bed in order to watch John work.
Sherlock pulled back enough to turn his head to look at John, and the older man was struck with such a strong wave of fondness that it almost ached in his chest. Sherlock looked vulnerable and skeptical, yet a shine of guarded hope was clear there at the same time.
Sherlock comes to the house pretending to be a photographer; they cause a ruckus of confusion before heading swiftly off of the premises. Sherlock gives his findings to Greg. John becomes frustrated with Sherlock, realizing that he knew the answer for much longer than he had let on and just let an innocent woman sit attached to a bomb for no reason.
John huffs disbelievingly as he searches Sherlock’s eyes, but finding only an open, trusting longing in their bright depths, “You’re still dressed,” is all he can think to say.
“Your…right...” John cleared his throat and attempted to focus on speaking, “Take it in your hand and just sort of…stroke it? A bit. Pull your foreskin up and down and…and…do you have a foreskin?”
“I didn’t dare try to shoot her in the heart,” John admits quietly, as though entranced by the sight on the floor, “Not sure she actually has one,” then he shakes his head and amends, “
Holmes looks in to the earnest face of his lover, still amazed that they’ve finally come together. He sees in Watson’s eyes their years of combined longing and pain, and the glimmer of sadness that there is a version of them that has not yet gotten here. He desperately wants to help them, because that’s what his doctor does: helps people.
Sherlock continues by insulting John (his ordinary contrast to Sherlock’s own genius), the bridesmaids (brides choose mediocre looking women), the priest (the job of the family idiot), and then finally he insults himself by admitting that he is an unpleasant, rude, ignorant, and obnoxious asshole. So really, overall, so far so good.
When he rights himself again, he notices that Sherlock hasn't moved. With a heavy sigh, he walks over to the younger man and lifts his computer from his lap unceremoniously.
The wedding party takes pictures and the chief bridesmaid - Janine, whom Holmes and Watson have never met - hits on Sherlock who easily redirects her attention to other men around her with his deductions. Next shows the wedding party welcoming people in to the reception hall. While Mary’s three bridesmaids stand behind her, uninvolved, Sherlock stands directly to John’s left and interacts with guests as they enter.
“Ugh,” he grunts in aggravation, “how many signs that I wasn’t alone did I overlook before I realized? They’re so obvious!” He had, in fact, overlooked all of them and gotten in to an altercation, just as Sherlock did.
Their impromptu staring contest is interrupted by Lestrade entering the flat. With a deep sigh, Holmes reaches for the remote to pause the DVD once more, just as Sherlock is going through his notecards to figure out where to start his speech.
John kisses it, but then moves down - mouth open and breathing hot as his lips drag across the skin - to the spot along the tendon, just above the collar bone, that seems to have a direct connection to Sherlock’s cock when teased.
Sherlock smiled demurely, turning his head away in embarrassment. The uncharacteristic shyness lasted just a brief moment before his confidence returned and he pulled John over him for another deep, passionate kiss.
Watson laughs as it’s his turn to frame the other’s face tenderly in his hands, “You’re lucky I love you.”
These nights, with you in my arms, I can almost remember what I fought to return to; can almost pretend that I don’t feel dead inside, aching with my despair over having lost you anyway, in the end.
John smiled shyly and then closed his eyes as his thumb rubbed against his slit, smearing the precome across his tip. He bucked his hips and moaned, biting down on his lip.
“I know,” Holmes admits with a smile as the battle with the Golem rages on the screen before them. The Golem gets away.
wants them to) before starting in on drinking. Sherlock fights back, of course, claiming he had eaten dinner yesterday and thus is not hungry, but John counters that he needs to lay a good base before drinking so as not to get too outrageously drunk. Sherlock attempts to point out how absurd that idea is, but it has enough points of merit that he ends up talking himself into agreeing in the end.
“Anyway, I was excited at first. I wanted to attend the school so I could have access to the laboratories there. My parents wouldn’t let me have a full-sized one due to an incident with a crab and some solvents…but once I got there I realised my mistake. The children were horrible. Vulgar and crass, they made constant barbs about my sexuality and mannerisms, claiming I was a faggot because of my hair style and how I wore my tie. Ridiculous,” Sherlock gestured angrily, “but…Professor Ellis was there to support me.”
Watson closes his eyes as Sherlock lowers the gun to the vest. He hears the music change from its frantic repetitive rhythm to the end-credit theme song, but still refuses to open his eyes.
Sherlock is now pretending to be John’s waiter - with a fake French accent - and John is too caught up in his own head to notice. Sherlock walks away to get the champagne and Mary walks down the stairs to the table.
They may be more than the marks on their bodies, but John can’t help but love every tiny detail about this crazy man that he is proud to call his.
“Mrs. Hudson normally brings it up,” Sherlock responded, his voice deep from lack of use. Obviously he had spent the entire day sitting around in his mind palace in silence.
Next morning Mycroft comes to visit. Sherlock and John do a spectacular job of going about their business pretending he’s not there except for answering his questions. Mrs. Hudson admonishes Mycroft for putting Sherlock in danger, prompting Mycroft to tell her to shut up. Sherlock and John turn their full attentions on to the other man in distaste, chastising him. Mycroft apologizes and they move on with the conversation. The elder Holmes gets a call and moves to the hallway, allowing John space to ask about the moaning text message which Sherlock is absurdly aloof about. Mycroft reenters and exchanges words with Sherlock before leaving.
Awhile later, Sherlock made a statement, “No, I’ll wear the purple shoes,” to which John agreed, “They look better with the shirt.”
Sherlock and John discuss the case back at 221B, walking through all the details that they already know. John scolds Sherlock for doing the “We both know what’s really going on here” face.
The way he said it left no doubt that Sherlock had played directly into his hand. Sherlock’s brow furrowed as his bravado dropped to mild confusion, “You didn’t have to trick me; I offered,” he reminded him, like this was still some sort of trap.
Lestrade had laughed, taking a step back and holding up his hands before gesturing that it was for John to explain. John knew that he'd owe Greg a slap for this one as he moved closer to Sherlock, speaking low as he cleared his throat, “He's er...well, he's wanking, Sherlock.”
Sherlock can’t think of anything to say as the pints start lining up on the bar. Zach sees John and David leave the loo and takes a calculated risk, stepping yet closer to Sherlock and laying a hand on his arm.
Sherlock thinks he has Moriarty outsmarted, that if he can find that key code and erase Brook that he need not die at all. So Moriarty shoots himself in the head, leaving Sherlock no option but to jump so that the criminal’s remaining allies didn’t shoot John, Greg, or Mrs. Hudson.
“Honestly, just one punch would have sufficed,” Holmes admonishes, remembering the thrill of the tussle even through the pain of his cheek.
Time passes and John falls asleep. He’s awoken by his cell phone, someone calling to tell him that Mrs. Hudson has been shot. Sherlock refuses to come because he knows it’s a lie, a diversion to get him alone.
Sherlock returns with the champagne before John can officially ask her to marry him, and Holmes places his left hand on the side of his face, turning in to it with the shame of second-hand embarrassment.
“Yes. There will be coffee and eggs on the table in ten minutes. Make sure you're ready,” John threatened as he left the room, leaving the bedroom door open spitefully as he clicked on the radio in the kitchen, knowing how much Sherlock hated the music on the station which John preferred whilst he was cleaning or cooking.
Holmes’ face fell in to another blank mask as his mouth formed an unhappy straight line and his eyes narrowed just slightly, “Quite,” he said in a clipped manner before turning to me, “Come on, Watson, I believe we are done here.”
Holmes merely glances over at Watson and can’t help but laugh at his reaction to the scene, feeling a bit smug. Truthfully, he also considers himself married to the work as Sherlock does, but over the years he has found Watson becoming more important than that. If he has to be in love with someone, there’s no one else it could be but him, really, and he’s content in that knowledge.
“Sweet. Baby. Jesus,” Watson intones angrily, second-hand embarrassed once more by his alternate self.
The scene moves swiftly on to the taxi sitting outside the address, and Watson finally uncovers his face.
“What is your name?” Sherlock asks quietly, having tried to match the volume from the video footage from last night.
Sherlock shakes his head and consciously breathes for the first time in a long while, bringing himself out of his John-induced trance. He makes a decision to attempt to sleep, so he closes the laptop and places it on the floor beside the bed before moving to lay on his right side, facing John’s back.
John asks Sherlock who it was that kidnapped him the night before, and Sherlock admits that he doesn’t know. Instead, he explains more about the imminent terrorist attack to John and his map of rats on the wall. Rat number 1 - Lord Moran - is the man who got on to the tube but was never seen getting off. Sherlock realizes that it’s not an underground network, it’s an Underground network, then notices that the security footage shows seven train cars leaving Westminster and only six arriving at St. James.
Also, regarding this happening in June, I went off the assumption that John and Mary's wedding really did happen in May (as referenced at the end of The Empty Hearse), meaning Mary was 7 months at Christmas, meaning Baby Watson was born in February, meaning June makes 4 months since the birth.
Sherlock looks like he doesn’t want to voice it, but he can’t bring himself to look away, either, “Of what I won’t find.”
Sherlock seemed to freeze, eyes staring at a spot above the head of another attendee who turned to look at whatever it was that Sherlock was looking at. It was a little bit spooky, in all honesty, watching Sherlock go completely offline. After a few seconds, Sherlock gave a sharp inhale and cleared his throat, lifting his fork shakily to pick at the chocolate cake in front of him.
John clears his throat before answering, “No, it’s fine. I’ve just so rarely seen you in them, and it’s usually for a case where you go undercover.”
For not imagining this ever really happening, I had a pretty great time writing this and thinking up ideas.
“He managed it by placing what is surely an unhealthy number of nicotine patches on his skin. Would you rather I tried that?”
“That’s too easy!” John grumbles, taking a long drink, “Never have I ever had dinner with a member of the Royal family.”
Henry turns on Dr. Frankland accusing him of killing his father. Then the dog begins to move again, and as John shoots it, the older man runs away, stepping on and activating a land mine as he does so. With a final, resigned sigh, he lifts his foot and is gone.
They stare intently in to each other’s eyes, as if trying to read the other’s very soul, before they’re broken from their trance by the words “You may now kiss the bride” followed by raucous clapping from the crowd. They join the clapping merely on instinct.
“Well, at least we didn’t go through that,” he says lightly, smiling sheepishly at his friend next to him.
“You said there weren’t enough words to describe what I am to you, but do you think ‘boyfriend’ might be one of them?”
Sherlock shudders at the warmth flooding from beneath John’s clothing. Despite the coldness in the room, John is like a furnace and Sherlock lets his thumbs dip under the wool monstrosity which is John’s Marks and Spencer jumper as he strokes along John’s stomach, circling around the navel sensually.
Sherlock’s eyebrows rose in shocked confusion, his stomach fluttering with a strange excitement at listening to something so intimate. Ever since John had returned to Baker Street, his masturbation habits had been quite rare. To be precise, he typically indulged in the act every fourth or fifth day now, as opposed to every second or third before The Mary Incident (Sherlock refused to remember that it was, in fact, a marriage), and John had just had a wank in the shower yesterday.
By the time two days had passed, Sherlock was itching to open the response that John had sent. He noticed that, this time, the envelope was simply addressed to “Dear Friend” at 221B. Odd, indeed.
Sherlock solves the Powers case that has plagued at least a portion of his brain since childhood. They rescue the woman from the car. Four pips and a new picture of a car later, they’re moving in to the second case of the debacle.
As of late, I have frequently found myself looking back on our acquaintance with this new feeling of pain and wrongness in my gut. I cannot help but come to the unfortunate conclusion that I may have not fully understood what I had until I no longer did. Until I lost you to her.
“DI Lestrade sent me over,” he answers distractedly, not looking from the screen, “Neither of you has been answering your phones, so I was sent to check on you.”
The cabbie drives them to the school, but he did have to lead Holmes in by gunpoint. Then the bottles appear.
“Tell me to stop,” John practically begs on a whisper, eyes still locked on his lips. His heart is hammering in his chest and everywhere he touches Sherlock is aflame despite the unbelievable cold.
“Of course not,” Sherlock scoffed bitterly, “you were the popular rugby player whom all the girls wanted to shag and all the boys wanted to emulate.”
It was one of those days. One of those endless, monotonous days in which nothing interesting happened and Sherlock could feel his brain cells slowly turning to dust through lack of use. He had already used a considerable amount of energy to shout at the television - another lie detector show with an annoyingly prickly host - and now he lay on the sofa, his hands resting flatly on his stomach with his eyes closed, going through a cold case murder from 1926 he had filed away and forgotten.
John fumbles with the layers that are still so frustratingly in the way. He moves them just enough for their cocks to connect and grasp them both in his left hand. John thrusts against Sherlock and in to his own hand as Sherlock bows his back, his head tipping back in ecstasy. John leans down and sucks at the freckle to the right of Sherlock’s adam’s apple as he brings them both to mind-shattering, life-altering orgasms.
“Where is John?” He asks as he calculates where his own weapons are. He might be able to reach the knife on the mantle, but he has no gun since John moved out.
“Actually,” John starts on a whisper before placing some distance between them once more. They’re still dancing, but now Sherlock is looking at him quizzically. He screws up every ounce of bravery he has ever possessed, “Would you mind?”
“I’ve never been very big on public speaking if it doesn’t involve deductions, and I bet the same is true for him,” Holmes agrees.
Sherlock looks at him curiously, aware of this exact exchange happening during their very first cab ride together all those years ago, “John, are you aware that you’ve already used those words before?”
“Ah,” his smile only seemed to grow somehow, “he’s a good man you’ve got there. I can’t tell you how happy I am that you’ve found someone to take care of and appreciate you.”
By the time Watson returned to the trail where he left him, all he could find were signs of a struggle leading to a sharp drop over the edge and in to the water below.
John pulls the covers on the right side of the bed up so he can climb beneath them. He lays down on his back and is surprised at how quickly Sherlock curls in to him, resting his head on his left shoulder, his left hand over his heart.
“Inspector Jones,” Holmes greeted coolly in return, a slight nod of his head in acknowledgement, as his eyes never left the bodies on the ground.
Feeling a curl of anguish in his stomach, John leaned over to touch Sherlock’s hand, “What happened?”
“No,” Sherlock whispers, looking bashful, “I’ve never been interested before...well...until recently.”
“I’m trembling with anticipation,” Sherlock groaned sensually, licking at John’s nipple with a devious smirk.
“Good lord, you two are disgustingly domestic,” Mycroft bemoans, making a show of turning his face from the pair in disgust.
“It was Mycroft’s idea to send me here, actually, and my own to portray this act in particular. I figured your disgrace of a wife won’t question what’s taking so long if she thinks it’s a delicate situation,” Anthea answers truthfully, without any remorse regarding her words.
“Oh my God, is he going to frame her? Kill her?” Watson asks, reading the face that makes expressions so very much like his own, his mouth forming words in a cryptic way that he himself employs.
,” he stresses, then opens his mouth to do so, but finds that he actually can’t explain it because everything he thinks to say sounds ridiculous. Holmes smirks triumphantly.
Once his torso is bared, Sherlock runs his hands reverently over the skin before John swoops in for another hungry kiss. It’s a short one, John pulling back quickly to resume his work of undoing Sherlock’s buttons, forcing him to scoot back towards the taller man’s knees slightly to allow room for his hands to work. Once undone, John slowly guides the expensive material towards Sherlock’s shoulders. Sherlock leans forward, kissing John as his own hands move behind his back to yank the material off of his arms, throwing it to the side, uncaring of where it lands.
“It’s only Mycroft. He doesn’t count,” Sherlock waved away, “I think the mortified shame of mummy walking in on him in such an --
Holmes and Watson both feel their stomaches clench at the words. This never happened with their Mary…most none of what she’s done ever did. Theirs was nice and genuine, and the fact that she died and this version has lived? It’s unjust.
Holmes’ stomach drops when he sees her, more confident than ever that Sherlock needs to abandon this idiotic plan.
“‘m fine,” he mutters unclearly, letting his head droop to the right as though he’s going to fall asleep with his shoulder for a pillow.
Nodding in agreement, Sherlock lets his hands fall to John’s hipbones, holding tight over the denim of John’s jeans. This can’t possibly be happening. This is a dream.
Holmes smiles because Watson isn’t judging him for it, “Absolutely no idea,” he admits and they both laugh.
“Because I sort of like the idea of us celebrating it on our own day; to hear it from him before anyone else.”
Sherlock and John go back inside, Sherlock discusses with Irene while John searches the house for further threats. In the bedroom, Irene injects Sherlock with some kind of drug and forcefully takes the phone from him after hitting him a few times with her riding crop. John comes back in, not caring that Irene is getting away, simply worried about making sure that Sherlock is alright.
“There is proof - well guarded, mind you - of multiple dimensions existing at once, having branched off from each other at different points.”
“John isn’t even questioning Sherlock, why is that?” Holmes asks curiously, not looking from the telly.
Holmes nods in an understanding way, his eyes falling to the floor instead of his friend’s nervous ones. They make their way back to the sofa and resume the “show”.
I do not think it is any sort of secret that I am beyond elated by my life here with Holmes and the adventures it grants the both of us. But this particular story is not about that, and it will never be published for our readers to partake in.
Like Sherlock and his dancing, this song has been following me, and I've been living in hope of the right (case) fanfic. It may have taken 11 years, but I finally managed it! But seriously, two roommates where the closeted (yet obviously) gay one is hopelessly in love with his supposedly straight roommate? COME ON!
The fact that he’s standing outside the door of John’s single room at 2:30 in the morning, drawn there by the potion, is undeniable proof.
Not that he hadn't missed this. The quiet and calm of his life back at Baker Street which included the mad dashes around London, solving cases, and helping people again. It had been the perfect balm for the trauma and hurt of his failed marriage and the child that wasn't his, not to mention the "death" of his best friend and subject of John's every waking fantasy. Well – sometimes not even
Sherlock thinks but can’t quite grasp it; he’s stuck on the fact that it sounds like John is offering to help him experiment sexually in whatever way he can, “Example,” he orders.
Sherlock looked away so he could cover his face with his hands in embarrassment. John had no right looking at him in that way, “I’m sorry,” he apologized into his hands.
“I know, it’s just…” John finishes and moves to the sink, staring himself in the eye. The alcohol brings the confession from his mouth to one of his closest friends; going through a war with someone - now
“What is your plan?” Sherlock asks calmly, though inside he is frantic with the need to get John out of harms way.
