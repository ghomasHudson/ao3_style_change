Patting him on the back, Crowley gently told him.
After chucking the machete in the secret compartment, he pulled off his black jacket and his bloodstained jeans and shirt, unconcerned about the cold or prying eyes, and changed his clothes, cussing under his breath when he noticed his last pair of clean jeans had a ripped knee.
It seemed Cas realised it too, because he quickly smiled at Dean and introduced Gabriel. “Guys, this is my first cousin Gabriel. Gabriel, these are my best friend Dean, his little brother Sam, and his parents, Bobby and Jody.” Dean knew that Cas was deliberately not mentioning that Bobby and Jody were their surrogate parents, because a lot of Cas’ family was very much convinced that parentage was golden and adoptive kids were little more than bastards. Especially Cas’ brothers, the twins Michael and Lucien, who had earned himself the nickname Lucifer and wore it like a badge of honour.
Castiel smiled softly. "Nothing wrong with that. There is more than one kind of smart. I couldn't fix a car to save my life."
"Hello, Dean, it's Castiel." He couldn't stop smiling, and was glad no-one else was around.
“Yeah,” was the grumpy reply. “Who’s askin’?”
Bobby had offered the cabin, noting that nobody came there for months or even years, and it was exactly the out Cas had needed.
Smiling at the, for them familiar, reference to Norse mythology, Cas shrugged. “Bobby and I are guessing top level demon,” he said. “But your guess is as good as ours.”
To Cas’ great confusion and anger, Dean burst out laughing. “You… you think
Happy that Sam was feeling better, Cas patted his shoulder. “Anyone special?”
Jody called for silence, but Gabriel smiled and kept his hand cupping Sam’s ass. “Gonna hold you to that, my moose man,” he whispered and squeezed again. Sam blushed and tried to concentrate on the wedding.
Dean passed a hand over his eyes. “Because you’re drunk, Cas. And… and you can’t promise me you’re gonna be fine with it tomorrow. Drunken consent isn’t consent. I want that shit when you’re sober.”
Supremely unperturbed, Castiel started to make his bed. "Well, and what if we did?"
The world shook to a grinding halt. “N...Novak?” Cas stammered, hidden silver test forgotten.
Soit - similar to whatever.
Cas clenched his teeth and felt a muscle jump in his jaw.
“He can stay over later, grumpy. I don’t mind,” she said, squatting down to open a cabinet. Gabriel nudged Cas right back and pointed at the loopy writing on the small of Pamela’s back.
Ellen flicked her finger at a non-existent fleck of dust on her sleeve. “So… We won’t treat you or Castiel any different,” she defensively stated. Dean chuckled and pulled her into a bear hug.
“No. He is the guy I went to the car show with. That’s all.”
Crowley’s face became uncharacteristically sober. “I could have, but then you wouldn’t know the truth behind your mom taking off, now would you? Isn’t it much nicer to know such things before you kick the bucket?”
He had barely rolled over, when his phone dinged again. Cursing under his breath, Castiel  picked the thing up again and turned off the sound.
"I can tell you both love each other a lot."
Cas shrugged, even though Gabriel couldn’t see it. “Soit. I’m ok, Gabriel. I can crash at your motel once I’m there. Which one are you in?”
Chèrie - dear
Chuckling, Cas repositioned his legs. “True, but it is also why I am an exceptional hunter.”
Cas bit his lip. Sam looked actually very angry, and he was afraid his friend would lash out, but Sam took a deep breath, clenched his jaw and twitched his head.
relaxed and they could
Dean’s jaw dropped. “Wh-what? You just… did all of that?” Cas shifted closer to Dean and took his arm in a tight grip, eyes wide and questioning. Dean could see they were of the same mind. He gave the kid that said he was God, a baffled look.  “Why would you do that? I mean…. End hunger, stop fighting, bring world peace… Why mess with the two of us?”
“Why is your car so close?” she wavered, not even reaching out for the doorhandle. “I..if you’re a victim, like us, why is it so close?”
Dean smiled and kissed Annette’s hand courteously. "Enchanté, Madame,” he smoothly said, and Annette blushed even deeper.
Castiel sighed and rolled his eyes. "Yes. And he is a nice guy too." Glancing at his watch, Castiel  winced. "I have got to get going. I still need to run back to school. I have another class!"
Castiel gulped. Oh no.
Castiel raised his eyebrows. "Right. Unless it's a car," he snarked.
“Impossible… it… it can’t be… Cassie… no,” Gabriel babbled. Suddenly he pulled Cas’ shirt up.
“Huh,” Sam’s voice broke through Cas’ musing. “It kinda looks like the shirts are holding hands.” Cas’ eyes flew to the design, specifically the two sleeves that were overlapping. He was right. It looked like they were holding hands. “Almost as if you two are holding hands,” Sam continued. On Cas’ shoulder, Dean’s hand tightened almost painfully.
Dean shrugged. “Nah. We all made bad choices. Gabe’s good people. Plus… they can mellow each other. Sam curbs Gabe’s prankster side and Gabe lightens up Serious Sammy. Win-win.” Then he chuckled. “And I say we all win.” He pointed at the pair. Where they had been talking seriously, Gabriel had suddenly climbed on Sam’s lap and kissed him enthusiastically. Sam, after the initial shock wore off, kissed back just as eagerly.
Not moving from his perch on the hood, Cas shrugged. “Soit,” he offered, causing his cousin to sigh theatrically. “You did not go in there already, did you, Cas?” he demanded to know, crossing his own arms over his chest and shifting his weight onto one leg impatiently.
Cas ruffled his feathers loud enough for even Dean to hear. “He also was the most slippery and skilled in combat. If I had not smote him, he would have escaped. You should be more grateful, Crowley. Dean and I saved you a lot of trouble.” Dean grinned at that and agreed with Cas loudly, before saving his phone and ending the call. When he offered to turn in for the night, Cas tilted his head. “But what about Baby’s cooling fluid?”
A treacherous blush crept up his neck.
Sam scoffed. “It’s better than venting by letting your fists fly. I have seen it up close. It is destructive and hurts people. I’ll get this out of my system later.” He packed his stuff and walked out of the room.
Surreptitiously, Castiel looked around, and indeed, several women were eyeing him interestedly.
way.”
“Cassie, Cassie, please,” Gabriel plead, hanging on for dear life. “Don’t. It’s not worth it.”
The sheer force had knocked all the wind out of Cas, and he barely had time to recover when the first claw tore at him. It it gave a searing, throbbing burn, and the next tearing was worse. Juliet clawed open his arms, his legs and then his chest, making him scream at every drag of her claws.
Over the golden head of his brother, Cas saw Dean cast a questioning look at Sam, who shrugged. “Dude… let the guy breathe. He’s turning purple,” Dean quipped.
“OI! Who the hell are you and how the…”The demon trailed off as he saw Cas. “Angel…” he whispered. His other companions swallowed hard and cowered together. “And you’re a human… Oh crap… ohhhh crap!” The demon turned to the others. “Guys.. That’s Winchester and his pet angel.”
Confused, Castiel turned around. "Like what?"
Cas licked his own lips and was surprised to find he liked how swollen and tingly they felt. “Hmmmh… you too, Dean,” he replied with a blush.
Gabriel smiled warmly. "I wouldn't dream of missing it," he said, and kissed her cheek. Castiel copied him and their parents stepped into the car. They waved goodbye and turned to go inside.
“Merde…”
Castiel bit his lip not to chuckle. It was an accurate description of how this professor taught. He leant towards the tall guy and whispered back.
Castiel smiled and waved at him, then ran to class.
Castiel moaned as the alarm on his phone gave a tinny version of 'Reveille'. He groped around his bedside table for it and winced at the glare of its screen. After he had shut off the alarm, Castiel noticed the messages. There were several. He opened the app and scrolled to the first one.
Pamela was a beautiful lady, an incorrigible flirt, and one heck of a psychic.
As soon as Castiel opened his door, Gabriel scanned the room, taking in the unmade bed, the still closed curtains and the neat rack of clothes, airing out. He inhaled deeply, suspiciously.
It was big, black, hideous, and damned scary. Basic outline: a huge dog, but instead of fur, its hide was covered in thick, black scales, shining with some weird ooze. It’s eyes were fiery red, like Crowley’s demon eyes, only more burning. Its teeth, well, best description Cas could think of was a muzzle full of deboning knives. They even glinted like sharp metal.
Castiel resisted. "Not wise, Bal... you still have to drive home in that cookie-tin car of yours."
Please remember that I am not French and feel free to tell me any mistakes I made.
Gabriel winced. "EW! Gross, baby bro!"
Angry for giving Crowley leverage over him, Cas growled low.
Gabriel opened his mouth a few times, but nothing came out. He closed it again and pouted his lips. Pondering, he tapped them with his index finger. Castiel patiently waited until the genius that was Gabriel had thought it all out. Finally, he slowly nodded.
Cas shrugged. “I thought it prudent to not land on the road, so I landed here, at the bank of Codorus Creek. The alleged gates to Hell are just through this little copse of trees, and across Trout Run Road.” Dean raised his eyebrows at Cas’ use of the word ‘Alleged’. It sounded like he did not believe the lore here. Cas squinted as he looked around, then nodded once. “I have sensed demonic presences. They are about eight to ten miles west of us. I think in a motel.”
oooOooo
“Tsk,” Crowley huffed. “Calls me to give me that smitey look... why Castiel, are you flirting? Gets me all tingly in me nethers, it does.”
Cas watched as Jo easily beat Garth, who chuckled and rubbed his neck. Jo smirked and caught Sam looking. “Sam! Show these wimps how to do this properly!”
He slid the guy on the broad backseat, carefully positioning him, and nodded encouragingly at Sandy. “Get in. You got shotgun,” Cas urged her, but she hesitated.
Maman rolled her eyes and sighed, glaring at Gabriel. “Vraiment! Lucien and you need to understand that Castiel has his own life, Gabriel. He is not a plaything. He has his own mind, and it is a great one. Leave him be. If you two are hovering around him like bees around a hive, he will never be ready for real life.”
Bobby nodded and they flipped through the site again. “Maybe we should ask for a sighting. I know a little something about houses after living all my life in this place, patching it up left and right. Could be we can knock that amount off. And then it is still well within our price range.” He gave Cas one of his rare smiles and nodded. “Thanks, son. We owe you one.”
"I have received calls from both Gabriel and Lucien. They seemed upset... Well, Gabriel more than Lucien, but if even Lucien is pushing to hear if you got home..."
He hot-wired the truck and with a happy sigh, he pulled away.
Bobby sighed and scratched his scruff. “You’re right, as always. So… The reason I called the three of you here, is that I’m gonna retire. For real this time.” Cas blinked. What did that have to do with him? Bobby seemed to have read his face, because he gave Cas a half smile and pulled a file towards him from the side table. “I have three of these folders. One for each of my boys, and one for you, Cas. And before you start objecting that I’m just doing this because you’re dating Dean, look at the date this is notarised.” He shoved the file to Cas, who took it with trembling fingers.
“Down boy,” he snarked. “We need to focus.” He smiled an apology at Pamela, who chuckled.
Dean’s blush was now definitely burning off his freckles, He ducked his head and picked at his cuticles. “Geez… ‘s just a hobby I have…” he objected, but Cas pulled him close and kissed him like it was going out of fashion. Dean dropped the shirt and kissed back. With all the kissing and making out they had already done, this was a totally new one. It felt like Cas poured his very soul into the press of his lips. Dean moaned as he got pushed down on the bed, Cas’ strong hands pinning him down.
Gabriel was clenching his jaw tightly, golden eyes swimming with tears.
Sam widened his eyes. "You're kidding? What did you do?"
Big Dutch hugs. 💚💙💚💙💜💙💚💙💚
He paced harder, his deep blue eyes burning like fire. “I don’t even know where she is now.” He noticed Gabriel opening his mouth and cut him off before he spoke. “And I don’t want to know!” he snapped harshly.
Castiel slapped his butt some more, even though Dean had said it looked fine. "I didn't! It had to be pointed out to me... by Dean!"
“Heya, Cas…” Dean looked very uncomfortable, and Cas was worried. He reached out in solace, but Dean looked away. “Look… there was a slight change in plans.. Would you mind if we went to Bobby’s place? We’ve been invited for dinner there. Just Sammy, you and me. Jo is at her girlfriend Charlie’s home.”
of the Hunter life,” he sibilated. “Until mother left us that is. Then he got drawn in, because he thought she’d been possessed. He never, ever gave up on trying to find her and excorsise the demon.”
Fuck. This was bad! Cas grabbed a container of salt and began laying down the lines, when a high pitched ringing hurt his ears and made his eardrums throb. He pressed one hand to his ear, the other continuing to pour salt.
That made Castiel blush again. "I'm sorry... I guess I should have paid attention to my fellow students too."
Gabe shot Cas a look he understood fully. Fish soup was neither his nor Gabe’s favourite. But this time Cas had an out. “Actually, Maman, Dean bought me dinner. Meat, salad and a bun, and fries to the side.”
Sam threw his head back and laughed. "I've got to remember that one!"
Je m'inquiète pour toi, mon frère, c'est tout.” (I'm worried about you, my brother, that's all.)
The mention of fun triggered Castiel’s memory. "Oh, before I forget... Gabriel will be joining us for breakfast today."
Castiel Novak, 22 and very busy designing a fictional garden for his final Horticultural Design project, rolled his deep blue eyes at his roommate and long time friend. “Dean, I want to put it there, it will attract bees and butterflies to the garden and then they will find their way to the other flowering plants.”
“No! I was perfectly content hating her guts! And now...”
Cas smiled at him and cupped his cheek before kissing him sweetly on the cheek again. “You have a romantic heart, Dean. As a Francaise, Maman will approve. Come, we will have to hurry.” He pushed open the door to the dining room and caught a smiling Annette, setting another place.
Something hot flashed through Castiel. “Here? As in Canton?” he demanded to know. Jimmy nodded. “Yes. In the same apartment she bought eight years ago.” Cas growled deep in his throat. “M’excuser, I have to make a call,” he brusquely said and easily broke Gabriel’s hold on him by pinching the skin on top of his hand. “OW! Cassie!” Gabe protested, but Cas just grabbed his bag and made for the door.
Cas smiled and blew Dean a kiss through the still open door. Dean pretended to catch it and pressed it to his heart. Cas chuckled. They were being sappy, and he loved it. “Okay… I’m going. I will call you, promise.” Dean sighed and waved sadly as Cas shut the door. He kept looking at Cas, until Cas couldn’t see him anymore. But as he pulled away, Baby’s headlights signalled once, twice and her engine roared to life. Elated, Cas watched her taillights dwindle in his rearview mirror. Onced home, he sent Dean a short message, and saved the number in his contacts.
Maman smiled lovingly at her third child. “So, Castiel? A friend? A... special friend?”
“This!” he called out, carefully not looking at Cas, who tensed ever so slightly. “This is why you are a lousy teammate!”
Cas smiled lovingly. “Hello, Dean.” Somewhere in the background, Dean registered the voices of Sam and Gabriel whispering to each other urgently, but he didn’t pay it any mind. For him, only Cas mattered now. How he looked, smelled and felt. Jody was talking, her eyes suspiciously moist, and behind them several noses were being blown or cleared. Cas was staring at Jody as if what she said was of the utmost importance. Dean loved that concentrated look on his angel’s face.
N'est-ce pas, Annette? (Right, Annette?)
Cas dug his heels in and in the corridor to the toilets, he managed to pull free. “What are you doing?” he demanded with a frown. Dean licked his lips and his angry demeanor vanished to be replaced with one that looked like worry.
Gabriel let go, eyes wide and scared. “I-I’m sorry. Are you ok, Cassie?” Cas smiled and told his distraught brother everything was fine. Gabriel stepped back and suddenly put his arms around Sam’s waist. “Okay… Sammich… can we sit down? I think I should sit when my dead little bro explains his non-deadness.”
Rolling his eyes at that, Cas sighed, making Danielle suppress a giggle. “Just get your backside to this house, and help the poor woman out.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Annette, bless her heart, came rushing in and gasped in shock. "Mais monsieur Castiel! Que faites-vous?"
Castiel smirked at them and for their benefit he raised his voice slightly. "I'm afraid I'm the one driving... you can lie back."
Castiel shook his head. "Tu sais que Maman interdit les surnoms. C'est ses prérogatives."
Behind him, Gabriel cursed loudly. “How the fuck did you know?” he demanded to know, while Cas helped Anna to her feet.
“Hold on, Cas. You got a little something...” Dean noted, pointing vaguely at his face.
French to English:
“Assbutt! How can you ask me? I… I think I’m gonna be sick.” The world spun around him and he groaned. Dean grabbed him and guided him to the toilets, holding his shoulders as he hunched over the porcelain. Cas heaved and the toilet got splattered with purple. Dean blew out a harsh breath and coughed.
Cas took a deep breath. “I can see that. And it’s unfair how good you look. Take me along, before I jump you.”
“Hello?” The gruff voice of his surrogate father had Cas nearly tear up. “Bobby?” he punched out.
Using the provided plastic fork, Dean cut off a big bite and shoved it in his mouth. After chewing twice, he moaned, a lustful sound that had Castiel gulp and lick his lips.
Dean raised his brows and turned to Ellen, who held up her hands in surrender. “Oh no, I’m not even going to try and lay into you. You seem happy beyond anything I have seen in years, so I’m going to wisely retreat to the kitchen and get us all some coffee.” Dean smiled at her and offered to help. “If that’s what you want, sugar, feel free,” Ellen shrugged. Dean assured her he was okay with it because he liked helping her out, and she smirked. “Plus it gets you away from your little brother and his wise-ass remarks, right?” she surmised easily. Dean just chuckled and walked past her.
Dean kissed Imp on her nose and rubbed her cheek. “Hi gorgeous. Last of the peaceful days. Tomorrow we’re gonna be swamped with ladies and gents who coo over us. Let’s go out for a long one.” Imp nodded, and Dean got her gear. Maybe a long day out with Imp could clear his mind of blue eyes, pink lips and a sweet five-o’clock shadow that had to scratch just so. Dean shook himself and got ready.
Bobby coughed, looking shifty. “If you boys are willin’ ta try, I know a psychic, not far from here, name of Pamela Barnes. She might be able to shed a light on this.”
That made Castiel laugh. "Want to take a little drive in her?" he asked sincerely.
Thinking about Jimmy, Cas blanched. “What the Hell did you do?”
Cas tucked a blanket around the guy in the back, so he would be more stabilised, and shut the door quietly.
The little tv-set behind the counter suddenly switched on, the hiss of static startling Cas a little.
Since Dean had at least an inch on Castiel, his uncle had to tilt his head to look at him.
Dean stared at her. “So?” he urged, knowing what she had to say would be said anyway, but not by him. He was ready to wait her out.
Sceptical, Cas raised one eyebrow. “Which was?” he asked.
Quel charmeur. (What a charmer)
Castiel winced on his behalf and turned his attention to the priest again. The droning, monotonous voice of the clergyman soon bored him, and he let his eyes wander around the church. It was richly decorated, since they were Catholics. Castiel always admired the craftsmanship of the masonry and sculptures. He wished he could make such fine art.
Castiel leveled a stare at him. "Come to my room, Gabriel , I have to get ready. I have an appointment at ten, and I do not wish to be late." Bemused, Gabriel followed Castiel.
“Dude… Cas has been head over heels with you since day one. I have not lived through over a decade of your UST and eye-sexing for you to suddenly doubt the guy’s devotion to you.” Dean’s green eyes found his. Wide, scared and pleading. “Cas will be here, come hell or high water.”
"Cassie, relax, baby bro. Smile!" The subject of Castiel’s thoughts pushed his way through the throng, some sort of sweet looking drink in his hand.
Crowley studied his cuticles. “Most certainly not, dear Chaton. Our contract specifically states you shall not see you mother until your dying day. So there certainly wasn’t a chance in Hell she’d bump into you. See.” He smugly tilted his head and walked right up to the edge of the Devilstrap. “I got intel that you were close by. So, I sent some of my minions to... distract mommy dearest.”
“Alright ya idjets…” Dean snapped his head up. Bobby?! What the… Bobby surveyed the class, eyes landing on Dean with a frown. “You look awful, boy. Something wrong?” he asked in that same gruff voice that had taught Dean about pistons and the lubrication cycle of an engine.
“Cas, dude, you can’t put that there.”
Castiel smiled back, as he shook out his jeans. "I am. Now, honest question: is it acceptable to wear these jeans, that shirt and this button up to a classic car show?"
Annette chuckled and Jack looked baffled.
Gabriel. Who knew what mischief that old Trickster would cause.
A hand landed on his lower arm. Castiel turned around to see a man smiling at him. He was slightly older, wearing a V-neck that was just a bit too deep to be decent, and tight pants.
Lisa stared at him, earpods still in her ears, the white cords in stark contrast to her dark wavy hair. Dean rubbed his neck. “I- I.. I’ve been thinking… I’d like to date you. I mean… you’re cute and popular and…I like you a lot. So...” His voice petered out. Lisa just stood there, her face blank, one earpod held only an inch from her ear, like she’d just taken it out. She blinked once. “If… if you don’t… I might just jump off the roof here…” He swayed a bit, trying to keep his balance. Lisa blinked a few times more and put her earpod back in. Then she turned around, the grey pleated skirt swinging enticingly around her legs, and walked back to the door. Desperation clawed at Dean. “I-I’ll do it! I mean it!” he called, but the door swung shut, leaving him alone.
Throwing his hands up and rolling his golden eyes, his cousin let out a frustrated moan.
Translation French - English:
His phone buzzed with a message as he drove the silver knife, dipped in lambsblood, home in the djinn’s chest.
“Merde, Honey. I think I’ll find a liquor store, and drink it,” he mused.
(See the end of the chapter for
Naomi entered, smirking, her grey eyes mischievous. “I
I am SO sorry.
In the background he heard a soft ‘Aww’ from Charlie and a grumpy ‘Fucking finally’ from Sam. He paid it no heed, until Sam suddenly high-fived Charlie. “Well played, my Queen.”
Cas sighed. “Can you not?” he asked, exasperated. “Just go. I will not fight you. Once midnight strikes, I will follow meekly.”
Another sigh had Castiel heave his chest in the slightly too-tight shirt Gabriel had forced on him. Gabriel’s smile faltered.
oooOooo
“Cassie! Caaaasss! Wait u-ooooh shit!” Gabriel skidded to a halt right next to the both of them.
It cracked his mask, and he smiled. “Oui. My ancestors were not very imaginative. That’s how it goes, hein?”
Cas scoffed as he rolled onto his side, prying his eyes open, annoyed to find his long, dark lashes wet against his cheeks. “If you really want to know: it was a Rakasha, and because Balthazar was concerned about me and broke cover too soon, he got the full force of it’s rage. He died in my arms. I could barely kill the thing before was going to start its meal.” If he closed his eyes, he could still hear the dull ‘thud’ with which the Hindu war-axe had separated the head from the Rakasha’s body.
“You look more like me, but you have a lot of Dean’s mannerisms,” Cas observed. “And you say you
“Yeah, no. I'm guessing you drove Sweetie here?” When Cas blanched even further and hid his face in his hands, Dean hummed in disapproval. “I thought so. I am
Lucien smirked. “Je m'inquiète pour toi, mon frère, c'est tout.”
Anna sat down on the edge of his mattress, the re-donned ‘Engelsrufer’ necklace chiming softly as she moved. “Castiel, we’re grateful you agreed to come help us, but it was supposed to be as back-up. An extra set of eyes and hands. Not for you to go in on a kamikaze mission.” She grabbed his hand where it lay on the bed. “As hard as you might find it to believe, Castiel Shurley, we, Gabe and I, we care about you. We don’t want to lose you.”
Oh mon Dieu - oh my God
Désolé - I am sorry
Castiel sighed, a bit overdramatic, but hey, it was his car he was talking about. "He called his boss slash uncle and had her towed to his shop. I just got a text that she is fine."
Internally, Castiel screamed at the name. So stereotypical, a bleach-blonde girl, overly perfumed and caked in makeup, called Starla. Gabriel smiled at her, and brought his mouth to her ear to tell her something. Castiel shuddered.
"... and for teasing you about the mechanic."
“Castiel! I hope you do not use that language near your new friends!”
Suddenly, he smashed into someone.
He frowned a bit. "I despise people who think their education gives them the right to treat others like second rate." In a bout of sincerity, Castiel put his hand on Dean’s knee. "Don't let anyone convince you you are 'just' anything. Each person is unique and amazing."
Dean’s whole being lit up and he smiled radiantly. “Cas, if I hadn’t, would I still be here? Hell no,” he answered his own question. “I would have punched you in the nose, grabbed my gear and walked back to the club.”
The blonde had seen him and waved. “Hey Sugar! Want a donut to go with the juice?” she had said in a perky, if loud, voice. Cas had accepted gratefully. He had skipped breakfast after all. “I’m Donna. Jody was just telling me how you got up special for us, to get our buzzy friends out. That’s mighty nice of you.” Cas had liked these sheriffs. They were kind and motherly.
“That’s the weird part,” Cas admitted. “It looks and reacts like a burn, but it doesn’t hurt at all.”
I am so frikken sorry, my sunshines!
He looked pensive. “You know, when you're 15, four years is such a big age difference... at 26, not so much.” Dean sighed. Cas didn't understand the sudden mood change, and he didn't like it, so he tried to get Dean back to the playful mood he had been in.
A cold shiver ran up Cas’ spine. “Ferme ta gueule, Crowley. I could have run into my mother today...”
“Dean?” Cas peeked around the corner of the garage, where his husband was giving his Baby a tune up. “Crowley called.” Dean pushed his creeper out from under Baby and sat up while wiping his hands clean on an old rag.
In the back of his head, a calendar was ticking off, and it was almost nearing it’s end. Well over half of it was crossed off. Only 3 more years, two weeks and a day until it ran out.
“Sssshhhhh,” Cas comforted her. “It’s ok, chèrie. He was... a criminal. He drugged you, and all these others. I am... unsure of what he planned to do, but I had to kill him. To protect you, and myself.”
world, all I wanted to do was undo that. So I put you back on the same spot in time and place. I didn’t count on you remembering those four months, and I forgot to wind back time in Castiel’s dimension. Rookie mistakes, one might say. I only took over from my missing Gramps three years ago, so please forgive me. But I noticed how much you both suffered for my messing up. So… I wanted to make things right. I pulled this Castiel here, stopped the one from this dimension from dying and put him in this Castiel’s place, with the proper memories this time.” He nodded at Cas.  “Your world is none the wiser. And only Sam and Gabriel know you are actually not from this world.” He glanced around with that bright smile again. “Did I think of everything this time?”
, Naomi. You just upped and left us, your husband and your six month old son. And apparently taking your other six month old son with you. Why, Naomi? Why would you do that? Was Jimmy such an easy baby you could just sneak off with him?”
Jimmy blanched. “Over a decade? But... you were just a kid then,” he stammered, appalled.
Looking worried, Sam stopped too and turned around. “Well, yeah? Don’t you?”
Dean chuckled and took Cas’ hands into his own. “Maybe… but you are cute and adorable when you’re all flustered. C’mere… I want to kiss you even more now you spoke French to me.”
The Canton County Courthouse was a repurposed church, and Cas felt oddly at ease. He knew the whole ‘hallowed grounds’ thing was a myth, but he still had trouble envisioning a demon waltzing up the front door. He was looking at some old maps of the area, especially around the old Route 11. It seemed the water-sprite was concentrating her actions around there.
“Look, we can show you, but let us in first. Unwitting passers-by shouldn’t see this.” Cas glanced at Pamela, who nodded her head at the living room.
A stern look shut him up. “And Castiel needs to make his own. You can advise him, but don’t try to lead his life. It is his. Not yours,” Maman said with that understanding yet firm tone of voice moms all over have, that makes you feel like you're five and did something foolish.
Cas nodded and gently kissed Dean’s hand. “Yes. And haven’t we built a very profound bond between us in all our time together?”
That was another thing that had changed in their lives. Both Sam and him had bent their knees and in three months they would be the stars of a double wedding on the ranch. Somehow Dean’s lonely and rather boring life had turned around. He donned his shirt and smirked at the little embroidered cowboy-bee on the chest. “Bee-haw,” he muttered before leaving their bedroom to start his day.
Naomi glanced up. “You call him... Chuck?” she wondered.
"Hello?" He winced at his grumpy tone, and hoped the caller wasn't offended.
I almost forgot to mention. Cas is bi-lingual. He spent his formative years in France. So, his speach is sprinkled with French stuff.
"Yes, Gabriel. You know the rule. You eat here, you come to church."
Castiel bit his lip not to start cursing for real. That dick!
Jimmy sat down, hard, all fight gone. “Good lord... fifteen... I was hunting skirt then, and you were chopping of werewolf heads...”
Until his phone rang again. With a sigh he put it on speaker.
Cas stepped up to Jack and put a hand on his shoulder. “Bonjour, Annette. Meet Jack, our new son. Jack, this is Annette. She helps keep the house clean, the laundry and dishes done and gets food on the table for Charles and Jeanette.” He gave the boy’s shoulder a light squeeze. “She is also my oldest and dearest friend, so be nice.”
Mais monsieur Castiel! Que faites-vous? (But Mr. Castiel! What are you doing?)
Cas smiled and happily obliged.
Dean had finished his, and was licking his fingers clean.
Bobby was outside, doing whatever he did, when a knock came to the door. Dean hobbled along on his clunky cast, eager to open it. Instead of red hair and grey, mischievous eyes, Dean stared at messy, dark locks and scared, wide blue eyes. He wobbled on his good leg. “Cas…” he breathed. Then he pulled the boy in, burying his nose in the tan coat, inhaling that petrichor scent deeply. He barely noticed that he started shaking.
That damned meeting... which had him wondering something, but he’d get the answer later, from someone else.
With a soft shaking of his head and a smile, Castiel stepped behind the room divider and changed. When he stepped out again, Gabriel gasped and widened his golden eyes.
Looking away, Cas whispered under his breath. “Connard! Je te déteste!”
Crowley just chuckled. “Ah. You can truly see me now, can’t you?” he concluded, voice thick with smug satisfaction.
Castiel had a good audience in his brother, because he gasped again and his eyes grew sad. "No... now what?"
"No fair!!!" he whined. "You have the sex-voice, the sex-hair, the sex-eyes, the sexy bod and now a sexy car? Where did I go wrong?"
connards - assholes
Later that evening, Dean was cuddling Cas close, whilst talking to Donna and Jody. Hearing the two ladies of the law were also together, had Dean raise an eyebrow, but it was also awesome! “So, bi or pan, ladies?” he asked with a grin.
Dean snorted derisively. Parlor tricks. Jack smiled as if he could read Dean’s sceptical thoughts and understood them. He waved his hand and the dust dissipated. Another wave, and the very air shimmered, showing Sam and Gabriel, snuggled on the bed in Gabriel’s room.
Gabriel dropped his head. “Guess so. Damnit.”
“I put your names on, just in case people don’t know you’re the plaid guy, and Cas the one with the white shirt and tie,” Charlie said. She opened her mouth to say more, but with a mischievous twinkle shut it again. Sam commented on the lack of obvious flowers and actual pollinators. “Well, since landscaping isn’t all flowers, and just bees or butterflies is also not what pollination is about, I went with the more personal concept of two shirts, one for the office bit of landscaping, one for the outdoors bit. One for Cas, one for Dean. Showcasing that it isn’t just one or the other.” That mischievous twinkle was back and Cas decided there was just no knowing what that girl was thinking, and ignored it.
Castiel inhaled deeply and jerked open his curtains. "Yes, right. He admired Sweetie, and we took her for a spin, as the saying goes. After that, he drove his cookie-tin car home, and I brought Sweetie here, to tuck her in and execute the same actions on my own body."
Cas slapped his arm and stuck out his tongue. “Branleur.”
So, now it was the 17th of March, and Cas theoretically knew what to expect. It was exactly why he was in seclusion, his phone dead, his car at Bobby’s with an envelope in the glove compartment, leaving her to Bobby, his arsenal in the trunk to be divided between Bobby and his cousins, and a stack of pictures of him and Chuck to be sent to Jimmy and Naomi. He didn’t want anyone to know what happened, and if Bobby came looking after two months, his carcass should have been picked clean enough to show no evidence of how he died.
"Tell me I'm a great big brother." Gabriel demanded in a barely audible whisper.
He pulled a dark-grey henley over his head, shucked his jacket back on, closed the trunk and slipped his trusty knife back in its sheath on his leg.
When Dean returned, he sat down on his haunches, right in front of Claire and Cas. “Dean,” Cas started. “Why don’t you explain to me why, when Claire tells you she broke your angel figurine, you will not be very angry.”
. I was afraid you would lash out or upturn a table or something. I applaud you for containing your anger like this, but… It is not healthy.”
He was just done, when his cellphone rang. He took it out and rolled his blue eyes skyward. The screen showed only a grinning devil emoji. “Crowley,” Cas said as he answered. The King Of Hell wasn’t his favourite person in the wide world, far from it, but at least they got to a point where they could communicate without backstabbing and double, triple or even quadruple crossings. Having Gabriel at hand had helped enormously with that development. It had taken a friendly talk from the Archangel to have Crowley see that leaving the HOL and by proxy their affiliates, like Crowley’s own mother Rowena, alone was in his best interest any time. And now Crowley called the HOL, mostly by Cas’ phone, if he had some trouble of the supernatural kind.
Cas knew she was all teared up inside, and saved her from speaking by introducing him. “Jack, this is my mother, Jeanette. Maman, this is Jack… our son.”
Bobby shrugged. “I ain’t going there. I wanted to ask Sam to check on the meadow perimeter, but maybe you could do it today, with Imp.” Dean readily agreed. If this
Cas stepped forward, pushed his brother in the chest and with the same momentum swiped his feet from under him.
“Christo!” he called, but neither man’s eyes changed. Behind him he could hear the curtain to the other room shift.
The ringing rose in both volume and pitch, and Cas ducked to protect himself.
Gabriel bounced off the counter again, trailing flour. "Ohooo!!! Dean, is it?"
The guy chuckled. "Oh, it's not that. I just wondered what the Hell you said."
A rustling sound told Castiel that Dean was trying to put his hand over the phone to cancel out his answer. "You shut up, Bitch! And I didn't lie... I told you I bought it."
Cas fidgeted with the tassel on his cap. “You really think I should?” Dean rolled his eyes and looked at his family, who promptly started telling Cas that he should be free and live as he wanted to. Cas nodded slowly at their arguments, but when Sam said he could even hire Dean, he snapped his head up. “Oh no. I would never hire Dean!” Dean swallowed hard and stepped back, hurt in ways that had nothing to do with his crush. Nothing at all. But Cas held up his hands as Dean’s entire family and even Gabriel geared up to take a piece out of his ass. “I would only want him as an equal partner,” he explained, his blue eyes sincere and honest. That took the wind out of all their sails and Dean had to pretend to have something in his eye.
“Really, Kitten? We’re scheduled to meet in about thirteen hours. What’s the bloody rush?” Crowley demanded, as soon as he poofed in.
Danielle and Gabriel were in deep conversation, hashing out the way for her to finally leave her cheating husband.
“I’m okay. Just a little shook. And kinda scared you won’t like my gift, but…” He shrugged, very much aware that he sounded like an angsty teen. At the mention of the gift, Cas’ blue eyes lit up.
“There he is! See Sammy? Told ya he was hot!”
Gabriel smirked around the lollipop in his mouth.
“Here, see?” He flipped to the pages he had started on that day that him and Cas had been riding on Imp. “ That’s the design. I made it. Counted it out for cross-stitching, and bought a 100% cotton polo to stitch it on. The honey colour for the pollen and the bee’s butt was almost all gone by the time I was done.” He let his fingers dance around the different coloured areas.
(See the end of the chapter for
Naomi shook her head slowly, tears welling up in her eyes. “No. I am not seeking forgiveness, Castiel. I merely want to explain myself.” She looked up, her mouth pulled down bitterly. “You know we come from a Hunter family. For some reason, a demon targeted my parents. A demon with yellow eyes.”
“No... no! I didn’t want to believe Jimmy when he said you were a Hunter, but...”
The wet squelch with which his knife slid through the abdomen of the charging guy, should have made him queasy at the least, but Castiel, (Cas to his, very few, friends and, very distant, family.) didn’t even blink before he spun around and used the machete in his other hand to chop the head off cleanly.
The green eyes twinkled. "Really? Cussing in French? Who are you?"
After a gruelling, exhausting hike, Cas hit a dirt road.
"You're on." he stated, holding the phone flat between him and Maman.
Crowley nodded, then turned to Juliet. “Now you be a good girl,” he told her. “Don’t play with your food. He doesn’t deserve that. He only made the deal to not bother his mother. He said it was so he could live in peace, knowing he’d never see her abandoning face, but I knew his true intentions. He thinks he’s poison, and no-one should care for him, because he’ll ruin them. In doing so, he ruined himself. Go easy on him, girl. Ok?”
"Hell and damnation!"
Castiel sighed. Gabriel wouldn't lie about that. He loved that car nearly as much as Castiel did.
With a huge sigh, Cas suited up again and started unpacking the bees from his van. They were calmly buzzing and showed no signs of stress. And luckily no dead bees on the bottom of his boxes either. He set the swarm up and was just admiring his hives, out of suit because admiring can be done from a ways off, when he heard hooves clopping on the dry dirt. He turned around to warn the rider that he was trespassing, but his mouth stopped working. On top of a magnificent horse, sat the man he had been (day)dreaming about for three weeks.
Uncharacteristically, Balthazar didn't smile. Earnestly, he looked up into Castiel’s blue eyes.
Real Life™️ bugged me big time, and I had 2 challenges I’m writing for, plus a whole new one I’m modding. This fic kinda was the collateral damage. I’ll try and be better in updating!
When Gabriel arrived, at nine sharp, he didn't look too drained.
Papa patted his shoulder. "Thanks, Castiel. I knew you had some of my genes!"
Taken aback by the tone, Dean frowned. “No, of course not.” Cas blinked and stared at the design again, starting a string of ‘but… but.. but’. Dean took the shirt, hurt that Cas would be angry at him. “The design is safe, you fool, because I made it. It is mine. And if you don’t like it, you can just tell me.”
Dinner was a pleasant affair. The Winchesters and Singers joked around, ribbing each-other and generally showing their affection freely. To Cas too, and he loved it. He was involved in the jokes, got explained about anecdotes and just being pulled into the family dynamic. After a dessert of delicious blackberry and pear pie, Bobby sat back and put his hands on his belly. “Right… Boys, I called you over for some serious business.”
"I still don't understand your nickname for him. His favourite animal is the lion, not tiger." Annette passed him a plate and cutlery before getting a cup, saucer and egg cup.
Castiel did a swift recall and smirked at his tendency to revert to French when stressed. "Merde... it's French."
Merde - shit
He grabbed one, chugging half of it down in one go. The cool, soothing feel of it sliding down his throat, perked Cas right up. He breathed out a relieved sigh, then drank the rest of the bottle at a more steady pace.
Cas gasped. “Lucien! Vraiment! Vous dépassez vos limites, mon frère. Et vous êtes grossier. Il ne nous comprend pas. Je ne parlerai pas si ce n'est pas l'anglais.”
Dean stared at him, flicked his eyes to where Cas was holding his hand between his own two hands, and back to Cas’ face. “But… you said years…”
Dean patted his shoulder. "Yeah... Uhuh... that's a plan. See you in ten." He hung up and placed a thumb on Castiel’s chin, pulling down slightly. "Don't. You'll bite through. It'll be fine."
Sam shook his head. “Very pleased to meet you, sir, madam. Let me clarify that I also happen to be Dean’s little brother, before you wonder at the heated glances between him and Gabe that are almost setting the table alight.”
Castiel pulled up his study planner. "No. I can shorten my break between church and pre-lunch study. Nothing bad should come of it."
Dean shook his head. “I love how you want the bees and all their little buzzing buddies to come and play, and I applaud you, but ‘Sensation’ lilacs grow to be ten feet, and you’re planting them in the centre bed. It will dominate the entire garden and throw shade over your lavender and salvia. Here…” He pulled the sheet towards him and erased the species name for the lilac. “Write down: Syringa meyeri ‘Josée’.”
Dean scowled. “Stop calling it that! It’s a Louisiana garden, not a swamp. Why couldn’t they give this assignment to Benny? He grew up there!” Cas smirked and slid over to Dean’s side of the table. “See what I mean? I can see there is a problem here, but I don’t know why.” Dean put his hands in his hair and stared at the pictures with desperation.
Cas shrugged. “Why not? Both my older siblings are in the gay alphabet soup, so I have seen and heard it all.”
Castiel smiled at Dean’s enthusiastic tone. "Sounds like fun. What time do you want me to be ready, and where?"
The woman bit her lip, her eyes swimming with tears. “Castiel... my angel,” she choked out. “Good God, Jimmy didn’t lie. You look just like him!”
Gabriel’s voice quivered a bit. "That was nasty, Cassie, setting Maman on me." he accused.
He grinned full-on. "Go. Primp... but I wanna see before you go. Go. I'll wait here."
Dean chortled and took him by the arm.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas was anxiously awaiting Dean’s arrival. Charlie was holding the folder with the logo, and Sam was waiting to see, but Cas made them wait. He felt Dean should be there. It was fitting. After all, ever since his first year in college, Dean had been a constant in all his doings. They followed the same classes, were roommates, even now, and best friends. And now they were starting a business together. His cousin Gabriel, who was the only one in his family who even talked to him anymore since he had paid off his college to his parents, still teased him on the regular. “Picking out the silverware with Dean-bean yet?” or “Has poor Sammich died from UST overexposure yet?” Problem was that Cas would love to pick out silverware with Dean, but he was sure Dean didn’t see their relationship like that. Cas was certain Dean only saw him as his best buddy, and nothing else.
people.”
“Dude!” Dean gasped.
Cas frowned at that. That was a new one...
I am sorry, my lovelies!
Cas ignored him and made his way outside. He had a lot to think about.
“Fifteen,” Cas stated coldly. “And not so much of a kid. I had three werewolves, a vampire nest and a ghoul under my belt by then.”
Text sent, and reply received, Dean finally started Sweetie. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Cas,” Dean mumbled.
Dean smiled and rubbed his arm before picking up the tray of cups and the coffee pot. “I know… and maybe this time I will.” He usually didn’t take the offer, because he felt too much like he was mooching off the older couple, but tonight he wanted to be with his surrogate parents and feel like a kid. After coffee, they all curled up in their usual spots besides the fireplace and did their own thing. Ellen cleaned her favourite shotgun, Bobby was deep into some obscure Japanese book.
Translation French - English:
“Damnit, Cassie!” he cursed, running a hand through his caramel locks. “You were supposed to wait.”
“What the Hell?” he gasped, scrambling to his feet. He stared, mouth dropped open, eyes wide at the man, who did the exact same thing.
Castiel chuckled and earned another glare from his older brother.
Glaring at the glib guy, Cas shook his head. “Not even as far as I can spit.”
"Gaaaabeee..." he said low, threateningly.
Cas stared at the horn in shock. That was... disturbing. He looked around, thinking, when his eye fell on an old pick-up. It wasn’t Honey, but it would have to do.
Translation French - English
Sam’s crush? He quickly stepped out of sight behind an ad board. Dean smiled warmly and tugged Sam against him. Sam blushed adorably, ducking his head. The duo started walking towards the cinema, close together. Cas gave a shuddering sigh. It seemed Dean was very close with Sam, and for a moment he couldn’t breathe from the hurt that gave. Then he shook himself. He had no monopoly on Dean. The man was free to be friends, or more, with whomever he chose. Cas took out his phone and shot out two texts.
Anyway, I hope you all are staying safe and careful during this stupid pandemic.
supposed to see me. Wasn’t that our deal, you salaud?”
When he was getting ready for bed, Dean had both designs ready and he snuggled down happily, knowing he was going to surprise not just a friend, but his boyfriend with them.
He ignored Gabriel to step even closer to Jimmy, dragging his cousin along.
Connard! Je te déteste! -asshole! I despise you!
Not speaking, Crowley nodded once.
Trembling fingers ghosted over the little freckle next to Cas’ nipple. “It’s you… but…” Teary golden eyes looked into Cas’.
Anna shook her pretty, red head. “Castiel, he only dropped that name because it reminded him of your mother. As my second cousin, Naomi is supposed to be closer to me than you, but...”
Sam shucked his hair behind his ear and blushed. “Jo…”
“You know us, cousin,” Gabriel answered cheerfully. “The family has money. We don’t. Anna and I, we’re true Hunters. We scam and scheme. We have fake everythings, including creditcards.”
Sam rolled his eyes. "Dude, we literally are in the same classes, 90% of the time."
Papa just nodded.
"Nice to meet you too, Mr. Singer," Castiel replied with a smile.
"Charles! Castiel is not like you or our other boys. He has class and a persuasive nature."
"Because, nosy nerdboy, I feel like baking, it's fall so the pumpkins are fresh, and... Annette promised me she'd help. Her crusts are way better than mine."
Cas deadpanned, strangely void of any feelings. “Goodbye, Crowley,” he merely said.
"I don't understand that reference, but it's an astute way to depict his teaching style."
Instantly all heads turned to him and the jokes stopped. Bobby bit his lip and gave Ellen a pleading look. Ellen leveled him a stare, accompanied by some scary arm crossing. “Oh no you don’t. You made your decision, Bobby Singer. I’m your wife, but I ain’t taking the wheel for ya, because you’re scared of the boys’ reactions,” she sternly said. She picked up a plate and started stacking the rest on it. “I’m here, but you’re the one talking.” Cas swallowed on Bobby’s behalf. That woman was a force on her own.
“Ehm... thank you,” Cas mumbled, casting his eyes down.
Taking the bag, Castiel continued. "So he looks under the hood, and says it's bad."
Castiel was very grateful to have Annette. His jeans were freshly laundered by Friday. He put them on with a white T-shirt, a light blue button up, which he left unbuttoned, and his trainers. He drove to the same club as last Saturday, and saw Bal lounging against a non-descript little Suzuki.
The couple clicked, read and viewed the pictures. “Castiel..” Ellen breathed. This is wonderful. Exactly what we were thinking.”
“What is
Shrugging, Sam hoisted his backpack higher on his shoulder. “Not consciously, no. But my friends often end up becoming his, and I would like a friend of my own for once. We have shared so much over the years, I have to concentrate to remember which hairbrush is mine.”
Oui - yes
“Castiel, my Chaton, you’re such a nice toy to play with. I have actually grown quite fond of you. I thought it would be nice to leave this mortal coil behind on good terms with your mother. Goodness knows I never reconciled with mine. The witch.”
"Ah! Merci, mon chaton, merci beaucoup! That will make up for the bad language on Sunday morning," she said happily, before kissing him soundly on each cheek.
"Alright already! Castiel? Is that you?" Gabriel wouldn't dare call him Cassie with their mother fuming like that.
“Don’t you ‘Hello Gabriel’ me, buster! Why the Hell did you go?
*huddles in a corner*
A warm feeling spread through Castiel. "That's sweet of you, Dean. I got it at Basically Baked Goods, a bakery two blocks up from college."
“Naomi Novak is even less to me than Chuck is!” he growled, his already deep and gravelly voice even deeper and more rasping. “She abandoned me. Left Chuck and me alone so suddenly, father thought she’d been possessed. Making him tumble into the Hunter life so fast, even your family was amazed.”
The birds were singing, and the sun was shining, but Cas sat on the bed in a remote Hunting cabin Bobby Singer had given him the keys to, curtains drawn, sigils and protection up.
Dean looked at him with blatant disbelief. “No headache? Not even a heavy feeling?”
The lighter sparked, then caught flame and Cas saw the wooden planks an inch from his nose. Shit. Either a very small packing crate, or.... a coffin.
Rufus nodded once, with determination. “Yup. 1985… Worst year of my life.” That got him a good natured ribbing from Bobby, who declared that Rufus’ mom must’ve had a lot of sourdough bread while she was carrying him. Rufus huffed. “Pchah! Aren’t you done already? Or are you just stalling, knowing those two lovebirds are snuggling on your couch?” Bobby smirked and answered that the snuggling wasn’t why he’d left.
Dean chuckled and pushed the older man. "Don't do that, Bobby. You're scaring him."
This time Cas did lose his temper and he kicked out, denting the leg of the bed and jostling Anna.
“Pet? What pet?” Cas wondered.
Dean was still reeling from the huge announcement Bobby and Ellen had just done, when Cas came up with a house for them. He couldn’t believe how fast things were suddenly going. He sighed. His gift would not be as huge as Bobby and Ellen’s, but he had put in his heart and soul, and a lot of work. He waited until all was settled and the appointment with the realtor made. “Cas, could you come with me for a second?” he asked shyly.
The stranger put his phone to his ear, still chuckling. "Bobby, it's Dean. I got a job. Yeah... I heard her sputter and had the driver pull over. Three blocks from college. Uhuh. Yeah, if you could try sooner. This guy has a test in..." he quirked his eyebrow at Castiel, who did a quick mental calculation.
The guy was heavy as he flopped down on Cas’ shoulders, but he’d carried heavier loads.
They were sitting in their study hall and Sam had made a beeline for Castiel, as soon as he had entered the hall.
Once he got his strength back, he stood.
"Right... if you wanna come... there's a car show two counties over. All classics, it's like a fair, only now it's more fun because: cars!"
He couldn’t handle to see the faces of every civilian he couldn’t save, of Jimmy, of his mother, and even his father, all accusing him of not caring, of being emotionless.
Balthazar’s face lit up like a lightbulb. "Are you kidding? I'd love to take your girl for a spin!!"
boyfriend, Sam. Sammykins… My folks.”
“Calmez-vous, Madamme. I did not say anything of the kind. I am sorry your husband is such an... an assbutt, but we are merely asking questions, not accusing you or him.”
Gabriel winked at him. “No amount of sexy, French flattering will sway me. You’re my cous. Like my baby bro. Not going to fall for your French smooth-talking.”
Cas had swallowed down his eager reply to accept, because his eyes had caught the calendar that was lopsidedly tacked to the wall, and he knew there was no way he’d subject Bobby to this.
An audible gasp. "You go to church?"
Cas sat up, rubbing his cheeks dry on his shirt sleeve. “No. I’m actually demi-sexual. I need to form a deeper bond with people, before I can experience any sexual urges towards them.”
Admiring a well kept Corvette stingray, Cas had to admit that he was having lots of fun. He had started to call himself Cas, after half a day of being addressed so, and he liked it. Dean was chatting with the owner, when, to Cas’ horror, he saw Meg sauntering up to him.
"Hopefully never, Maman. It sounds so boring!" Gabriel exclaimed, before slathering his croissant with strawberry jam. Castiel snorted in his tea. Breakfast with Gabriel was never dull.
Nothing.
Branleur. (Wanker/Jerk)
In a flash, Gabe was on him, a silver knife slicing through the air. The girl gave a shocked squawk as Cas ducked and Bobby grabbed Gabriel around the back, pinning his arms. “Gabe, Gabe, it’s
“Oh.. oooohhh,” the glib demon grinned. “You met
Dean sighed and stretched. His arms were aching, and he wasn’t a bit sorry. They had spent yesterday in the woods, fighting the Shadow Orcs for their Queen. In the past few months Cas and Dean had been drawn into the world of Moondor, and regularly played with the LARP group. But today was another workday and he was for once more eager to stop than to make sure all the plants were put in their rightful spot. He knew he could trust his team to do it, and Cas had texted him that Charlie had decided on their logo.
They were still kissing and making out, when there was a loud bang from the front door and Gabriel’s voice rang out. “Annette… Où êtes-vous? I have an extra guest!”
“Dean?” Cas shrugged off his coat and stepped into their living room. “Dean? Love? Where are you?” There was no sign of Dean in either the living room or the kitchen. Worried, Cas made his way to their bedroom. No Dean there either. This was odd. Cas knew Dean had wanted to take it easy this anniversary. It was only their second, and they both liked to be alone together. He pulled out his phone and called his brother. “Gabey? Is Dean with you? No? He said he wanted to talk to Sam about something, so I thought…” When his twin chattered away, Cas fell silent. It seemed Dean had told Sam he would call tomorrow, so they had this evening alone. After he had finished his call with Gabriel, Cas went in search of Dean.
Castiel squinted. "If I have to guess... '65?"
Castiel smiled at the memory. "No. I didn't need to. A driver in the next lane saw me having trouble and told me to pull over. Turns out he's a mechanic."
Putain - fuck
are the next best thing in Hell. These five are just annoying. Dangerous enough to think about trying to open all Gates to Hell so demons can get to Earth as they please. Well, been there, done that, right Squirrel? While I am one to enjoy Chaos and Anarchy… Best to keep those in close check, and not allow them loose on Earth. By all means… kill the fools. They have it coming. Make them into a nice Demon kebab on an angel blade skewer for me, will you? There’s a doll. Tata!” And with that Dean’s phone turned black.
At the door he got stopped by Gabriel. “Cassie is fine, just needed your brother to get his ass going.” The Archangel waggled his brows. “Wanna be my plus one?”
Dean’s eyes fles to Cas’ face, wide and unbelieving. “You… Really? But… I thought you were too focussed on your career to be bothered by romance… or maybe that you were Ace.”
Dean smiled. Only his angel did that. He sighed and read again.
good. Dean rubbed harder and Cas arched his back up into the touch, unable to hold back the now obviously lustful moan. The rubbing faltered and Dean gulped so hard, Cas heard it. “Cas? Ehm… do… I mean… are you… Ehm… Wow, that sounded… mmhh... yeah…” Cas wanted to reply, but his stomach decided this was the opportune moment to heave again. “Eh… I guess not?” Dean wavered, rubbing again.
Dean chuckled and sat on the edge of his bed. “Like a baby, Cas. How’s the head?”
I hope you liked my silly fancies once more. Feel free to drop kudos and/or comments and reread at your liking.
hate my given name. I guess she felt a need to needle me. Add that to the fact that D told me to butt out when I asked him about his friend, and he hasn’t spoken to me since…”
“Jesus Christ on a motorbike!” Gabriel erupted. “Cas! You don’t
Gabriel sank to the floor, holding his ribs. "Oh god, Cassie!! I'm sorryheeheeheee...!"
French to English:
When he hit the floor, it didn’t hurt as much as he had anticipated, and he opened his eyes. Above him was a ceiling, painted blue with white clouds and a trim of sunflowers. It was like lying in a sunflower field on a summer day. A figure walked past, stopped and turned back. Dark hair, blue eyes and pink, pink lips. A frown appeared on the guy’s face. “What are you doing? Come on!”
The guy widened his steel blue eyes and raised his blond eyebrows. "Oh, does that mean we're friends then?" he quipped and a smile graced his face as he took Castiel’s hand in his. Castiel wasn't a social butterfly, but he knew the basic rules.
"You made sure she..." Gabriel started, but Maman snatched the phone again and ordered Gabriel. "S'excuser! Rapidement! Tu me décevez!" she hissed at him and thrust the phone back at Castiel.
The guy chuckled. A sound not too faked, or grating and Castiel found himself smiling and holding out his hand.
Castiel took him to the garage and stood next to his flaming red car as Gabriel knelt down.
“How... what? I mean...” the guy stammered in a voice much clearer and an octave higher than Cas’. Cas knows how he feels. It’s like he is looking in a mirror, except that his mirror was one of the magic kind, where your clothes are all weird. They are matched in height to the quarter inch, the blue eyes searching his face, are his, the shock of dark hair is shorter, but equally messy. The slant of his mouth, the crows-feet at his eyes, all exactly the same. “Who the Hell are you?” Cas ground out. The mirror image frowned, then scowled, and Cas was gulping at the familiarity. Surreptitiously, he palmed a silver coin from his pants-pocket. You never know if it’s a shifter, or whatever. The mirror Cas tugged at his deep blue tie, dusted off his tan trenchcoat, and huffed. “Well,” he started. “I could ask you the same. How can you look so much like me?” It sounded accusatory, and Cas bristled. “I cannot say,” he snarled. “But I can tell you, this is my own face. Castiel Shurley,” he offered, reaching out his right hand, coin concealed in the palm.
Crowley smirked at him. “Ta, darling! See you in a bit!” he called, and vanished.
Cas rolled away from the windows, just as he thought he could hear,
“Eh, Honey,” he grumbled low. “How about a long drive, far, far away from here?” He keyed the ignition and relished the growl Honey gave. “Aaahhh,” he sighed. “Just you and me, ma Petite. No-one else to worry about.”
That finally prodded Dean into action. He tugged at his bottle green tie and shucked his suit jacket straight. “Ready. Let’s do this.”  Sam smirked and followed him.
Castiel threw his hands up. "Merde!" he called, looking up at the skies.
Cas ducked his head. “Nev’r mind. I’m gonna go home and die inna corner.”
Well, at least he knew some things he hadn’t known before. Like that Naomi occasionally still hunted, if only to keep Jimmy and herself safe.
Gabriel gaped at them, and Cas knew he was expecting to be laughed at and told that he’d been pranked, but in all honesty? This would be a prank only a Master Trickster like Gabe himself would think of.
Dean’s lips clicked as his mouth dropped open and those green eyes darted left to right in a baffled expression. “Movie? What movie? What on earth are you talking about?”
Cas just shrugged. “Je m’en fout. I like you, Gabe, and you, Anna, but my living... it will not make my mother return to me, nor my father. I am just handy until my time is up.”
“Fine. Be that way,” he huffed softly. “Just do me a favour. Stay alive and keep in touch for once. Even if you don’t value yourself, we do. You have our numbers. Coming Anna?”
Only to stop dead in his tracks, surprised someone was standing there, on his doorstep, in this godforsaken stretch of Wisconsin wilderness.
Cas clenched his fists and tilted his head in warning. Lucien should know by now, that he wasn't angered easily. But when he was, Cas would use his anger, and any and all means he had, in a single minded way.
“He is telling the truth, Gabe. And don’t feel bad, Sam. I thought until just this morning that Sam and Sammy, and Dean and D were four different people, not two.”
Gabriel smirked. "You're an oddball, Cassie. If you're sure this won't end in tears..."
"Oh. Well thank you, I guess. Hey, what I called for, that pie..."
"There we go, Bal. This is my Sweetie." Castiel announced, making a grand gesture towards his shiny, red car.
Still not opening his eyes, Castiel groped around until his hand found the paper bag. He held it out with the words: "Here. I don't need you to get on your knees or anything worshipful like that. Just enjoy it and tell me what you think."
Cas closed his eyes and waited.
“Still I would like to meet D one day. He seems like a good guy,” Cas replied.
Zut - darn
"No. Not really. Just being his annoying self."
"Gabriel! Honte! You have really angered poor Castiel. If I had not picked the phone out of his hand, he would have used foul language. I can see it in his whole face! S'excuser... vite!" She held out the phone to Castiel, whose temper had lessened somewhat by his mother's actions. He gently put the phone to his ear again.
Triumphantly, Maman turned to Gabe. “Voilá, Gabriel, it is that easy. See how he can decide for himself? He is not a little bird anymore. Allow him to fly. So... now we can eat? Annette has made bouillabaisse.”
“Dude, I like the guy, but don’t make this totally wrong representation of him kiss me. Ew.” Cas pulled back and stared at the pristine skin, then at his rosary. Nothing. Totally unblemished.
“Oh yeah? Then why hasn’t he been here yet? We’ve lived here for years now, and we still use our own name. A great hunter like our father could have found us easily.” The sarcasm dripped from every word and Cas was straining to free his arms from Gabriel, who had him in a bear hug from behind, just to punch that smug bastard in the face.
Dean blinked, then flashed a crooked smile. "Really? They're just a mechanic's hands. Nothing special."
Honte! (For shame)
“Dude, you are of age, aren’t you?”
"Gabriel..." he intoned flatly.
Beggars can’t be choosers though, so he put a few quarters in the coin-slot, and dialled the number from memory.
Amusement trickled through Castiel’s agitation. "Castiel Delacroix. My mother is French, and she usually reverts to her native tongue when annoyed or emotional. I guess I inherited that trait... How did you know I was cussing?"
Cas blanched. “Maman. M’excuser. I was out of line. But Lucien was too. He insulted my friend by not talking in a language he understands. And he actually insulted me, by implying I was kissing my new friend. I am not that guy!”
"His name is Dean Winchester," he remembered.
Maman whacked him softly with her Bible. "Shush!"
“Nothing, Luce. You're overreacting.”
“I’m so sorry, Castiel,” Crowley said and turned away, poofing off just as Juliet made her first prowling steps towards Cas.
"Hey, is Gabriel coming on too strong, darling?" His voice was rich, with a British accent. Castiel bit his cheek, tearing his eyes from the V-neck.
Gabe got to his feet and Cas could hear him open the door.
do.” He motioned between the trembling form of his sister and himself. “I know I would be very upset if you croaked. On the job or off it.”
Gabriel sighed and muttered quietly: "Oui, Maman."
Dean’s eyes darkened and his mouth was a straight line. “Bal? That guy you were all over? I don’t think he is a reliable source.”
“Go with him, Anna,” he sighed. “I promise to not be stupid and check in every month.”
French to English:
Two noses scrunched up in wonder, making Cas grin wider. “I heard you stop and I heard the door close on Anna,” he explained.
Deciding the best thing was to make himself scarce, before whatever the Hell that was, came swooping back and make Cas into a lunch burrito, Cas darted outside to where an old pay phone stood. In theory he knew how these things worked, but never used one, always having a cellphone on him.
“Reap... me?” Cas had trouble looking away from the beast. “What does that mean?”
Barely out of breath, Castiel pushed open the door to the bakery. A dark haired woman glanced up at him and promptly straightened up, smiling broadly.
Vraiment? - Really?
Gabriel smiled a little lewdly. “I thought I was being clear, Sambrosia. I like you… a lot. Wanna try the whole ‘dating’ thing with you.” He squeezed softly and Sam bit back a yelp.
When Castiel entered the dining room, the table was set for breakfast, but only Annette was there. "Bonjour, Annette." he greeted her, with a smile and a courteous nod of his head.
Cas blinked. That was unexpected to say the least. Their plans had involved an intimate little dinner, then Dean’ s surprise and who knows what else the evening would bring. But Cas knew Bobby, and if they were invited over, there was something bigger going on than just the wish to see his foster kids. “Of course, Dean. Let me just grab my coat and put my shoes on.” Dean took a relieved breath, and Cas smiled at him. “We could just get to the rest of our evening afterwards. We did say we would see where the evening would lead us…” That finally brought a smile to Dean’s cute face and he agreed.
They were on the sofa, entangled in a way that had chased off Sam and Bobby, when the doorbell rang.  Reluctantly, Dean surfaced. “Nuts… I’ll get it.” He cast a last, longing glance at Cas, noting how sexy his boyfriend looked with his hair all mussed and his lips pink and kiss-swollen. “Be right back, cutie. It’s probably someone for Bobby.”
Sam knew he was blushing again, but he finally got his brain online. “Gabriel… what are you doing?” If he was being honest, Sam kinda liked that hand there. He’d had a little crush on Gabriel since they still thought he was the Trickster.
Cas felt the blush burn even harder.
“Kid, if you want to call us something other than our names, we’d be honoured. I think Cas likes Papa, because that is what he and his brothers Gabe and Lucien call their father Charles, and I am more than happy to be your dad.”
Glad his father, rotten bastard that he was, had made him go through ‘being buried alive’ trainings, Cas let himself sink in the known actions, slowly but surely getting himself out.
It wasn’t that Dean hated flying Angel-air, but the sudden translocation always threw him off a bit. When he opened his eyes, they were standing at the bank of a creek. “Where the frak are we, Cas?”
Bobby harrumphed and shrugged. "Ye're bein' too kind, son. He messes up all the time. But the idjet has to learn somehow. Next week, you got the Saturday shift, boy, and you will stand over his shoulder and breathe down his neck as he looks down the hood."
Later, as Cas was getting ready to drive off from Bobby’s garage, Dean was leaning in the open window. “Thank you, Dean, for a great day. I had a wonderful time.””
The sprite gave a delighted squeal and disappeared.
The twelve year old boy bounded up the steps to the Delacroix house and grinned as the door opened. “Hello!” he amicably said to Annette. “I am Jack. Who are you?”
Dean sputtered in the background. “Elf? An
Gabriel simply shrugged. “What can I say? Some parents are really irresponsible namegivers. Can you go talk to the lady, Cassie? I somehow always end up in bed with them, and not knowing what I came for.”
Cas, he could see the man more often and without having to have a bee hive in his home. He finished his coffee and said goodbye, before heading over to the other side of the compound to see Imp.
"I did no such thing, Gabriel. She heard me at my very greeting and intervened."
hein - eh
Another glance, accompanied by a slight intake of breath.
When they halted, the night was clear and above them stars twinkled.
Her eyes slid to the man he was hauling and she blanched even more. “Is.. is he gonna be ok?”
Ok, now Castiel felt like a fool and his cheeks were flaming. "I don't think you're a rodent, Dean. I like your voice. It's warm and makes me think of autumn fires and sunshine." A silence fell and Castiel started wondering if the call had dropped.
Cas smiled and picked up Dean’s hand from his shoulder. “Actually, I am Demisexual. Meaning I need to have a profound bond with someone before wanting any other relationship.”
"Gabe, come on. You know I don't drink."
doing? What are
Thanks so much to the amazing Dean/Cas Pinefest mods, Cass and Mittens... You guys are just wonderful, taking care of us all. Hugs!
Cas swatted in vainly at his brother’s hands. “Hey! Gabey!” Gabriel didn’t pay him any mind and rucked the shirt up over Cas’ left nipple.
Bal moaned.
"Good. Now: pie!"
Chaton - kitten (term of endearment)
“Because I think it might be a spirit, or, or... elemental or something.” She threw her hands up, clearly halfway towards declaring herself nuts and signing up for the nearest nut-bin.
"You like her, huh?" Dean said, a happy little smile hovering around the corners of his full mouth.
Cas smiled broadly. “A burger. A burger is a balanced meal... Good to know. Thank you, Dean.” He beamed and bit into his burger with gusto.
“That doesn’t explain how you knew I was there,” Anna groused, picking dead leaves and dry pine-needles out of her hair and off her jacket.
Dean pursed his lips angrily, then accepted that with a twitch of his head. “Well, that’s crappy. But then again: you never told me which club you wanted to go to, so this is the third one I went to, looking for my… you.”
Cas knelt on the moist, crumbling floor. “Not surprising. Even a building inspector would not allow this.”
Cas smiled. Then it hit him. “I might just know the place for you. It even has an orchard with fruit trees. Apples, pears, cherries, peaches and apricots. The last ones have been planted in plots of three each five years.” The others were gaping at him. “It was my parent’s house. It’s on the outskirts of town, so pretty close to the shops. After my father ran off to who knows where, my mother decided to put it up for sale, and split the money between me, Gabriel and the girls. Gabriel declined, saying he didn’t feel at home there, at all, ever, and the money would carry nasty memories. Hannah and Anna don’t care either way, both being too busy with their careers. I could use it, but I’m with Gabriel in this. The house holds no place in my heart. It was a cold and loveless home.” He glanced around the table and fell silent.
Danielle shrugged. “My father in-law wanted the house here, not twenty yards any where else. Which, I think, was stupid. There have been leakages since the day they moved in. And the house is damp, no matter how hot and dry the weather is.”
“If I like it? Dean… This is amazing and so inventive… Bee-haw Bee wrangling, Eco-friendly bee removal/relocation and apiary,” he read aloud from the larger logo. “Dean… this is perfect… but the design… it’s so detailed and well thought out. Is it safe to use?”
Sam threw him a glare and hissed that Dean sure as hell didn’t know what Bobby had said, to which Dean, just as blankly as Bobby, replied. “It means, very roughly, ‘Since before you were born.’ But sure, don’t take my word for it.” He shrugged and went back to his notebook, where he was almost done with the first design, and ideas of the second were scribbled in the margins. Bobby laughed and gave Dean a compliment on his accurate translation of the sentence. Sam sulked and returned to his file. Ellen chuckled too and reminded Sam gently to never underestimate Dean or Bobby. They had their own intelligence. Sam grumbled an apology to the pair. Bobby hummed and nodded and Dean gracefully didn’t make a fuss, but just accepted. He was too busy with his notebook to pull Sam’s chain on this anyway.
Cas pressed his hands to his ears. “Non! You’ll be better off without me. I swear! I’m poison! I only hurt people.”
Castiel pulled out the piece of paper that Bal had pushed in on Saturday. Staring at the number, Castiel pondered. Gabriel had said Bal was the worst club bunny, meaning probably that he hopped from bed to bed. But Bal had understood Castiel perfectly fine when he said he didn't want that. Reaching a decision, Castiel put the number in his contacts, where it ended up just above Dean. Castiel smiled. Three days, and he had met two new people, whom he both liked and hoped to meet again. He might get friends yet... With a satisfied smile, he pulled on his pyjamas and crawled into his bed. Then he broke one of his own rules by texting in his bed at night.
“Room 105 of The Waterfalls Inn on Main. It has a diner and a bar attatched,” Gabriel cajoled, making Cas chuckle softly. “And not too expensive, I take it?” he assumed with a grin.
Castiel smiled. "I was his designated driver, so I took him home."
“The one and only, little bird! You,” He poked Cas in the side, making him shy away with a grimace. “... are truly my cousin. That was comedy gold! How long did you plan to do this? Weeks? Months? Years? Because even I have not been able to stun so many into shocked silence, and that is saying something!”
Bal’s eyebrows shot up at Castiel’s teasing tone, but he smiled widely and followed him outside.
Jimmy dropped his gaze to his hands, which he held loosely in his lap. “No. I know of them, and I know our legacy, so to speak, but mother... Mother refuses to have anything to do with that.”
Dean shrugged. “Maybe it’s like us? Friend, but changed to more?”
perdant (Loser)
Castiel blinked. "No."
Gabriel smiled at her and kissed her on both cheeks. "Maman! You never age a day, do you?"
And that was it, the idea Dmsilvis and I have hatched for this year’s PPB.
Castiel ducked from under it and growled. "Don't."
Dean took it and studied it. “I know. Bad picture,” Cas said, his cheeks burning yet again.
Translation French - English:
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gabe,” Cas tried, but his cousin wasn’t paying him any attention. With a scoff, Cas paid the bill, whispering to the waitress that Gabe and Danielle would leave later, and grabbed his coat.
Dean smiled easily. “Nah. It was actually quite adorable, and I did kinda admit that I find you attractive, back in the car.”
"Like the gun?" Meg wondered.
Castiel looked around him. Despite the time pressure, he was happy to be sitting in the Chevy. He just loved classic cars.
He grabbed a granola bar, because now that his thirst was quenched a bit, his stomach rebelled, clamouring for sustenance.
“Jimbo! Heeeeeyyyy! Good to see you, cous!” Gabriel called so over-enthousiastically, it was nearly a yodel.
. All of it… for me… Dean… This gift will never be less than Bobby and Ellen’s. It is so, so much more. No-one has ever
Growling deep in his throat, Cas left his bed to pace. “Why not? The name Charles Sully meant nothing to him, nor me. Chuck Shurley is the name my father uses for himself, so I use it too.”
Several men, headed for the club, turned their heads to see.
Ducking his head, Cas took another sip of his beer, trying to hide his flaming cheeks.
"I'm sorry baby brother. I shouldn't have messed with you. Your pants are in the garage, top shelf. You're tall enough to reach them." That sounded slightly bitter.
you not to call me that, Joanna Beth,” the tall boy growled.
Looking at Danielle, Cas grabbed a large mallet. Danielle nodded once, and Cas hefted the big hammer. “That will be remedied, sprite. And please, let Danielle find her own way out. My cousin, Gabriel, has a few years of pre-law under his belt. I shall send him over to see if he can get her out of here.”
Je m’en fout - I don’t give a f*ck
A bit flustered, Sam walked after Dean. In the War-room, Cas was standing at the map table. His hair was still a mess, but he looked dashing in his charcoal suit with the royal blue tie and pocket kerchief. Dean’s eyes widened and the love he felt for his angel was clearly visible in the sparkling green. Sam smiled and guided him to where Jody and Cas stood. Stepping back he had to admit they looked super cute and beautiful. Dean’s white suit fit perfectly as Garth and Bess had sent a werewolf tailor to make it. The bottle green tie and kerchief set off his eyes, like Cas’ set of his.
Rubbing his hand over his mouth, Crowley hummed. “Sorry, Chaton, but I have to let my pet get you. No other way you’re gonna get taken down.” He seemed to be genuinely regretting this.
Castiel sighed in relief. "Thank you so much. I do love her, but I am mechanically totally inept."
and he wouldn’do nothing t’hurt me… Unlike
mon loulou… (my little one)
“Oui, Maman.” Gabe said, drooping his head and shoulders.
“Well, well, well. If it isn’t my favourite future Hell denizen. Hello, Castiel,” a smarmy voice drawled.
Bal looked like he was going to say something, but decided against it. “Let’s,” he said and with a hand in the small of Cas’ back, he guided them inside.
Jack smiled warmly. “I like that story. My Papa and Dad are amazing men, and I am glad we found each other.” Papa’s head had shot to Cas and Dean when Jack said their honorifics, and his eyes were suspiciously moist.
Cas chuckled. “It means ‘jerk’, Gabe. Nothing sexy about that.”
Cas took both his hands in one of his own and placed the right on Dean’s shoulder, where all those years ago his Grace had seared into Dean’s skin. “Dean, When I saw your soul in Hell, I knew you were an amazing person. Despite your flaws, and everything you did, it still shone bright and beautiful. I think I fell in love just then. When you told me you would have me, cursed or not, was when I finally realised you love me too. I was only waiting for you to say it. It took you another eight years, but now we can show the world we love each other. Thank you for being my husband. I love you.”
After that, everything was blessedly quiet.
Maman threw Castiel a look, somehow knowing, with her motherly powers, there was more to apologise for. "And...?" she demanded, still bordering Defcon 1 levels of anger.
be mindlessly driveling about stuff. Now, the class was taken by surprise and it took them half a minute to realise Cas was done. After that the caps flew and they could get to their families. Well… Most of them.
“I- Ehm… Hello, Dean. Hope you slept well…” Oh great mother of mercy... could he be more awkward?
Dean all but ran to their room. It wasn’t an apple pie life, but for him, it was as close as he was willing to get to it. He had his baby brother, his angel, and was still active in getting rid of things that went ‘bump’ in the night. Still saving people and hunting things. And it was still a family business. Only his family was huge now, and it definitely didn’t end with blood.
Gabriel slapped his butt playfully. "Go. And enjoy the pie! In return for it I want..."
“I will need your number,” he realised as he was about to shut the door. Dean winked and waved his phone, then started tapping at it. Cas wasn’t surprised to hear his phone go off within the minute.
His blue eyes widening, Cas stared at his friend. “How? Do you think it might work on Maman?”
"Smart man!" he said and tugged Castiel along, pulling him through the club.
“Bi,” Donna answered, where Jody blushed and mumbled something inaudible. For Dean at least.
Cas’ heart swelled at the moniker and he wiped at his eyes. “Well, Jack, first my parents, Charles and Jeanette. You can decide how you want to address them later. Gabriel and Sam have a little chore of their own to do, so they will join us later, and Lucien and Mikhail will be there for dinner.”
"Ah, Castiel. Mon chaton. I am pleased you are up already. Was the night out with Gabriel fun?" Castiel turned around and smiled at his mother. She just oozed European style: tall, straight backed and soft voiced. Her caramel coloured hair hung in thick curls from her ponytail. Her accent was almost non existent, but the way she formed her sentences was still off at times.
?” Cas managed, revulsion thick in his voice.
"Castiel, Cassie to friends."
“Me?” Cas punched out in surprise. Dean nodded and shook the extended hand lightly, indicating that Cas should grab it. With a nervous twitch in his stomach that was equal parts about being on the back of such a big horse and being this close to Dean with only their regular clothing between them, Cas reached out and took it. Dean hoisted him up easily with a lovely bunching of his muscles under the shirtsleeves and the visible skin of his arms.
Reviewing the usual dinner at the Delacroix residence, Cas had to concede it sounded like one Maman would approve.
Cas licked his lips before biting down on his lower. “I- ehm… I did, but… I didn’t ask you if you were okay with it.
“I know, momma bear,” he mumbled into her shoulder. “Can you keep a secret?” Ellen pushed away with a puzzled expression on her face.
L'avez-vous embrassé? (Did you kiss him?)
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam smiled at him, then opened his mouth to speak to Dean, but shut it again. He pointed between Cas and Dean, questioning all but audible. Dean chuckled and laced his fingers with Cas’. “Yeah. This morning. And you?” Sam ducked his head.
Jimmy looked up at him, his mouth pulling up in the same uneven smile Cas himself had. “I guess I got lucky after all,” he commented wryly. “I can’t imagine going through all that. I’m happy with my life, even if mother can be cold. At least she’s still here.”
The ride home had been silent and Castiel didn't care. He was still pissed at Gabriel. For once he thought he might have fun on one of Gabe’s nights out, but Gabriel himself had effectively put a stop to it.
“Ok. In truth, I came here to get you all out, well, any who were still alive. He cornered me, and I had to fight. It really was him or me.” Not a word of a lie. Cas was proud of himself.
S'excuser... vite! (Apologise to him, quickly)
"UGH. I'm never sending you a picture again!"
As if to prove his point, Gabriel poofed in. “Hey there Handsome! And Dean.” Dean glared at him halfheartedly while Sam blushed and looked at the floor. “Just wanted to ask what the hold up is. That cute sheriff is ready and Cassie is close to self combusting with doubt that hot-shot Dean-bean will show up.”
Merde! (Shit. Or crap, whichever)
Tu es magnifique! (You are wonderful)
Castiel got up and walked down a few steps, when a call from Dean had him stop. "Whoa, whoa, whoa. You are not getting in my car like that, dude!"
“Maman!” Gabe whined. “We just want him to be okay. We made mistakes and...”
The whole speech had been less than two minutes and most of their classmates had not expected that. Dean had heard them grumble about ‘that nerdy Novak’ who ‘would keep them in their seats for twenty minutes with mindless drivel.’ Boy they did not know Cas. Sure, he could babble on, but mostly about things like bees and other pollinating insects. Other stuff, Cas liked to keep short and sweet. And Joshua knew that when he appointed him valedictorian. Ruby had the same GPA, but she
He turned to Dean. “I'm sorry, Dean. Lucien is being very rude. I am ashamed to say he only speaks French to shut you out. Luce...”
"He didn't, Maman. Lucien surmised from Castiel’s answers that the text 'Found a sweet little piece of ass. Don't pester me.' that I sent him last night was not entirely true."
“What?”
Castiel blinked. Right, the test...
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean got up, kissed Cas on the cheek and smiled. “Yes, sir… You are too cute to be allowed, though.”
I have a twin!”
Dean stroked the red hood.
As always: thanks to the mods, who made this wonderful Bang possible. Love you all! 💚💙💜💙💚
"I said, I can help." To top it off, the guy had a warm, gruff voice, which made something vibrate inside Castiel.
“Then hang around until I am sober. You need a bed, our house has a big guestroom, Maman and Papa don’t mind if any friends stay over. And I can drive you back, because you need to get Baby from wherever you parked her.”
Charlie, who had been watching them with twinkling eyes, shoved the folder over to Cas. “It’s just a rough concept, but I hope you like it.” Cas opened the folder, Dean leaning in over his shoulder, ignoring the idea of personal space, as usual. Not that Cas minded. The closer Dean was, the better Cas liked it. The first  thing Cas noticed was the fact that there wasn’t an obvious flower or bee in sight.
Dean chuckled and slapped at the offending print. "Nope, your ass, Cas."
Anna hummed softly. “I know. You were calling out for him.” Quizzically, she tilted her head, making her ‘Engelsrufer’ jingle again. “I never knew what happened. Maybe telling me could help you give it some rest, let it go,” she offered sincerely.
Anna gaped. “What? How? I mean... it’s just one drop!”
The grin Balthazar flashed was near predatory.
A pie, pumpkin no less, and company during breakfast and church... Castiel smiled. That would do nicely.
He righted himself and stretched languidly. “Merde,” he cussed softly. “Those bloodsuckers were more alert than I thought.”
Happy, Maman turned on her heels and left. Castiel took the phone off speaker and whispered to his brother: "I'm sorry, Gabe. I never wanted this for you."
Opening his door, Cas slid in behind the wheel. “Castiel,” he offered, once Sandy had taken her place. “My name is Castiel.”
Dean sighed, tossed him his clothes and rolled onto his belly to watch Cas get dressed. After he’d pulled on his shirt, Cas cocked his head at Dean. “What are you doing?”
Annette, a middle aged, sturdy woman smiled back. "Bonjour, mon loup."
"I am going with Dean today, Mr. Singer, but he was the one inviting me."
"Was he hot?" Gabe asked, eyes twinkling.
Luce tapped his lips with his index finger. “Nope. I don't think I will. You see, Cassie, I see you and Ken doll here, standing way too close, and then he wipes at your mouth... after which you two stare at each other like moonsick idiots. I wanna know what’s going on here.”
She smirked, apparently certain that Gabriel wouldn't tell on her. "Not if you keep vouching for me, golden eyes."
Oh. It seemed he now had a regular seat next to a guy he didn’t know, while Lisa suddenly knew who he was and everyone was wearing whatever they seemed to feel like, and… He took his bag and sauntered to the seat next to Castiel. “My head hurts…” he mumbled. Lisa and Jo suddenly grinned widely. “Meori apeuda!” they chanted in unison, smoothly adding: “Side effects!” and squealing. It only added to Dean’s confusion. Since when did these two share interests?
As he splashed cold water on his face, he called back. "Merci, Annette! That would be marvelous! Tu es magnifique!"
“What the Hell?” he muttered, peering closer at the mirror. A patch of fiery red, raised skin started to appear. Cas swallowed hard, then yanked his shirt up to his neck.
One more swift look and Maman was satisfied that was all.
Instinctively, Cas tightened his grip. Apparently Dean took that as a sign to urge Imp into a faster pace and they were off. “Shall I check the side of the fence?” Cas asked as they neared the gate between the meadows. Dean patted the hand he was still holding to his own stomach and agreed. Imp was reined in a bit as they rounded the fence. Cas knew he had done his best to keep the agreement with Bobby and clear the weed away, but he also knew weeds could pop up a dozen yards across from where they had been cleared.
The older man smirked in his beard. "Damn straight, boy. You know why..." he chuckled. "Nice to meet ya, Castiel," he said with a tuck on his cap.
He packed his stuff swiftly and slung his bag over his shoulders. The bakery where Gabriel worked was just a few blocks from school, if he ran, he would make it in time. He glanced down at his shoes, regretting not putting on his trainers with his jeans. That was a perfectly acceptable combination, but he hadn't wanted to dress down from his usual attire any more. Damn his vain streak. With a sigh, Castiel stood and left the study hall. Walking down the corridors, he felt his phone buzz twice, in rapid succession. He checked it while doing a few quick leg stretches outside the building.
“Oh, rotten candy-apples...” Gabriel muttered while grabbing hold of Castiel. Cas wrenched his arm loose.
“Excuse me, sir. You’re intruding.” Cas swayed a little in place and the world was spinning. Dean glanced at him, rudely shoved Bal to the side and grabbed Cas by the arm, dragging him towards the bathroom.
Feeling he could weep with how much he loved the grumpy old coot, Cas chuckled. “It’s me, Cas!”
Cas gulped, then steeled himself. “Can.. can we do this... outside? Less traumatising for Bobby, once he comes looking for me.”
Cas blinked. “Who else would I be, Gabriel?” Gabriel gave a dry sob and tentatively stepped towards him. He took Cas’ face between his hands, tilted it this way and that, and let his fingers wander to a tiny scar in Cas’ hairline.
Jimmy scoffed as Cas raised his eyebrows.
, something big swoop right over the gas station.
he got out.
Castiel sighed. "Law. And it is boring!"
(See the end of the chapter for
When he opened the door, a young guy about their age gave him a winning smile and raised his hand. “Hello.” Dean gaped. The guy looked disturbingly like Cas, except his eyes were a little less intense, and he was blonder. “I’m Jack. Can I just come in, please, Dean? I have a lot to talk about with you and Castiel.” Dean kept gaping. The young man tilted his head in a way that was way too reminiscent to Cas’, so Dean swallowed hard and called for Cas to come over. His love came jogging into the hallway and stopped dead. The kid smiled wide again and raised his hand a second time. “Hello, Castiel. You look happier than before. So I take it this was a good decision?”
“Castiel, you could have gotten hurt. Badly. And how would we have known? Hunting alone is a recipe for disaster!”
"Don't push her, buddy. She looked like she's had enough."
Tout les dieux! - All the Gods!
Dean sniped back that Sam was
Castiel frowned. "I know. Like I said, I have just gotten up and I haven't found time to open the window yet."
Castiel held his breath for a second. Could it be that he now had three potential friends? He took the hand. It was unexpectedly strong and a bit calloused. "Castiel. I'm sure we are not missing much of the lecture, but..."
“Fine,” he snapped. “But don’t expect me to feel sorry. I have heard my share of sob-stories, as you can imagine.”
“Dean,” Cas said, putting his hand over Dean’s. Dean’s green eyes widened comically and  darted to where their hands were now together lying on Cas’ shoulder. “...are you.. Are you blushing because you don’t want that implied? Or are you blushing because you want the implication to be real?” Cas asked softly. Dean didn’t answer, and averted his eyes. Cas took a deep breath and decided to be brave. “Because I would very much for the implication to be real. I have wanted it for so long.”
Cas giggled at that. “I’m your me? That’s funny…”
“Nothing... nothing, cherie. Come. I will take you home.” He gestured at the only other living victim. “And this gentleman too, once I cut him down.”
“Aw… we couldn’t have that, now could we? I’d rather not explain that we are late to pick up our new son because my husband decided to have his wicked way with me.”
Dean licked his lips and ducked his head shyly. “We… we kissed… and… and now we’re boyfriends.” There. The big thing that was building inside his chest was out and said. He eyed Ellen nervously. Ellen looked absolutely like a proud and nostalgic momma, and Dean was pleased as punch Ellen’s daughter Jo wasn’t there. Jo was as fierce as her momma, but without the restraint that came with age. In short, Jo was a firecracker and their little sis was very protective of them, Dean especially, which had Dean wonder whether she hadn’t harboured a bit of a crush on him once.
To Cas’ surprise, Sam got a hard look on his face and he glared at Jo. “I
Dean licked his lips, drawing Cas’ eyes to those plush, pink bits of flesh. “Yeah…” he nodded. “Yeah. I think that would be an accurate way to say it. Why?” Cas nodded too, and did just that, following his impulse. He surged forward and pressed his mouth to Dean’s delectable lips. Oh sweet mother… they were soft, plush and sweet… so sweet… He moaned softly and licked along the seam of Dean’s lips to taste him better.
“You… you were done? Dean… did you hand stitch this all by yourself?” Cas sounded disbelieving and Dean took the polo. He turned it over so the big design was visible and his fingers easily found their way around the embroidered bee and the lettering.
Cas blanched and stared at him. “Dean… you did not pay a designer to make a new logo for me!”
Cas sighed. How did he get so lucky and unlucky at the same time? Lucky because Dean was a total sweetheart and wouldn’t force him into anything, unlucky because Dean was such a sweetheart and wouldn’t even kiss him now Cas finally had found the courage to act.
He realised that Dean was talking again.
“That would be me, Cas Shurley. Pleased to meet you,” Cas intoned sarcastically.
Maman nodded in approval. “A true, varied meal. I like that. So much better than all the junk food your dates buy you, Gabriel.”
“I don't know. I haven’t seen the two of you together yet. My advice, being the youngest, is to ask him. Be honest and allow for critique.”
Cas all but threw himself at Balthazar, who only just caught him. “Cassie? Sugarbear, what are you doing?”
The sprite lowered her head. “I thought the police would arrest him, and then she would be free of him. I didn’t really mean harm. Being shut off from light and fresh air has made me lose perspective, I think.”
Shaking himself, Cas dropped his shirt again. Those puzzles were for later to be solved.
Annette patted his cheek. "Ah, monsieur Castiel. I know. But, where is ze fun in zat?"
Thank you for reading my Destiel Buzzy Bee Bang fic! I hope you enjoyed the amazing art as well as my writing.
“Now hold hands,” Pamela instructed, grabbing Bobby’s right with her left.
And once again the biggest heap of thanks  and hugs for Solstheim, my perfect artist!!! 💜💙💚🖤💚💙💜
care! Hunter or no, you should have a shred of concern about your own
"What did that poor boy do to deserve that?" his father called out, just entering the room.
"Mes enfants, Papa and I, we are going to a charity auction. Behave yourselves. Oh. Gabriel, you will be joining us for dinner, yes?"
Gabriel held up his hand and wiggled his finger. "Nuh-uh little bro. Luce is gay, I'm pan. Big difference!" Castiel bit his lip, his sapphire eyes with the long, dark lashes staring at his shoes.
Jack smiled even brighter. “Okay! That sounds sweet, just like you feel. I like it.”
oooOooo
Gabriel rolled his golden eyes. “Yeah, yeah… Dean-bean is smooth like butter. Maman, Papa, this is
"Well, well, well... Just got home, Cassie?" he sneered.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Gabey… your father? How?” Oh...wow. Zachariah was Gabriel’s dad? Dean blinked at that. The way Gabriel had just slipped it in, was casual and dry. No emotions there.
, have the decency to speak English.” He turned towards Dean, who gaped at him. “Come on, Dean. This connard impertinent has ruined my fun. Let’s go do something else.”
"As much as it could be, Maman... I have persuaded Gabriel to join us for breakfast today." His mother lit up and her eyes scanned the table. When she saw the extra setting, she smiled at Annette and took Castiel’s face between her hands.
Behind him, he vaguely registered the pounding of running feet nearing, laboured breaths puffing and a voice yelling.
Au contraire! (On the contrary)
had either pushed him, hard, or maybe grabbed him around the chest from behind, leaving that scar in the process.
“Cassie-bear, you slew!” Cas snapped his head around, and his face betrayed pure shock. Dean clenched his fists, ready to punch the annoying little man in the pointy nose, if need be. Sam blinked in surprise, looked down and licked his lips, but also moved to try and shield Cas. Dean was proud of his little brother.
When Dean came home he stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Cas and Claire waiting for him. “Oh, oh. What happened?” Claire ducked her head, but Cas gave him a reassuring smile. “Right. let me just put the perishables away, and I will come talk to you.” Cas loved how his husband always knew what was going on in his mind.
Crowley shrugged. ”Yes. It was why Azazel picked him. That blood, it made those abilities stronger.”
“You’re more than that, sweetheart,” Anna whispered. “Charles would not...”
Cas sighed. It wasn’t like he had plans, and maybe, just maybe, he could let this go after her story, and have some peace of mind. He flopped down on the other chair, his blue eyes hard and shuttered.
"Y'ello!"
to be kidding me!” Sam came sauntering in behind him and chuckled. “Guess we still do things on the same day. We got together the same day, we got engaged the same day, we had a double wedding because… well, we did everything else the same day… And now we introduce our kids to Maman and Papa on the same day,” he stated wryly, guiding a blonde teenage girl forward. “Guys, Maman, Papa, meet Claire. Gabe and I adopted her today.”
mon cher. (My dear)
"Well," that gruff voice said, as he straightened up, wiping his hands. "I'm sorry, pal. She needs serious work. I'll call my uncle to have her towed. If our schedule allows, we might have her up and running by the time your classes are done."
Cas winked at Bal as he got dragged along. “Like your not pompous ass, Dean?” he asked teasingly. Dean coloured even redder, but didn’t answer. He put Cas on the passenger seat  in Sweetie and climbed behind her wheel. “Not that I mind you ogling my ass, buddy, but you’re damned drunk and I bet that tomorrow you wouldn’t like me being next to you.”
For a musty old bar, it tasted better than anything. Munching, Cas grabbed a paper, checking the date.
“Simple,” came the wry answer. “You two keep forgetting I have sharp ears and an equally sharp nose.”
Quickly he clapped a hand over his mouth. Maman was a light sleeper and could hear a foul mouth in the cellar, whilst standing in the attic. He sat up, grabbed his phone and flopped back with a huff. One glance and he was hard pressed to refrain from further cussing.
Looking smug, Crowley smirked. “Nah. The plan was to have some sort of messed up ‘Hunger Games’-like showdown somewhere remote, but a couple of nosy bodies managed to prevent it. They stopped the opening of the Devil’s Gate, and somehow managed to kill Azazel.” He looked pensive all of a sudden. “Still wonder how those dumbasses did it. It’s not easy, taking down one of the Princes.”
Cas did an adorable sniffle and smiled through the tears. “You made this yourself.
Maman giggled and smiled at him. “Ah, mon petit chaton, he is charmant. I like him.”
“Damned demon. Always burns my phone whenever I call him.” Dean sighed and tossed the phone aside. “Gives the term ‘burner phone’ a new meaning, right? But we got what we need.” Dean looked up at Cas. “Shall we, sweeting? It’s been awhile, but I still know how to handle an angel blade.” Cas smiled. Of course Dean would offer to go. They were the best option, really. He nodded and opened his arms. Dean stepped into the hug. “Just.. try to not make me queasy this time,” he said, clenching his eyes shut. Cas chuckled and spread his wings.
Luce chuckled. “Regarde toi... tous agités. Est-ce que je me rapproche de la vérité, mon petit frère?”
Maman saved him by plucking his phone out of his trembling hand.
the Hell did you go? And how could you leave Jimmy dangling like that? Hell, the guy just found out he has a twin, and then said twin just ups and leaves?”
With a desperate cry, Cas pushed himself past the animal, and hurled through the cabin door, where Crowley sat on the cot, patiently waiting.
“You must know, my angel, it was all my fault.”
"If he's as cute as you, Clarence, I'll die a happy girl." she stated when he made clear this was for a friend.
Gabriel smirked at his father and winked at Castiel.
Castiel ended the call, and swiftly placed Dean’s order with Meg, since Gabriel was up to his elbows in dough.
“I don’t see why that should matter,” Cas stonily replied. “I’m 26. Most of our kind don’t make it far past 30.”
Exasperated, Cas threw up his hands. “I can’t with you! Go on, leave! I’m going to take a walk, like I wanted to do before mother showed up!”
Gabriel hopped on the flour covered counter, not minding the white butt his pants were getting. "Really? A text? From the mechanic?"
He sighed. "I know, Gabe. Just..."
Stunned he let his gaze travel a full circle. In a thirty foot radius, every tree, big or small, was flattened to the ground, the grave he’d just emerged from dead centre. He tried to swallow, but his mouth and throat were like sand.
Cas gaped. His
“Well, agent... I have a question for you too.” Cas blinked at her, totally blank on whatever she would want to know, but noting the slight sarcasm at the moniker.
Dean blinked in surprise, then turned to their daughter. “Oh sweetheart… it broke?” Claire gave a wobbly-lipped nod. Dean pulled her close and whispered into the golden hair, until Claire gave a soft chuckle and pushed him away. Straightening, Dean wiped at his own eyes and then sighed. “Claire knew about it being my mom’s. And that was why she was so drawn to it. It also reminded her of her mom, since they were both fond of angels. I understand her need to sometimes take the angel and talk to it. Am I sad that it broke? Yeah. Of course I am, but I’m more sad that Claire has now lost that solace.”
Cas wrinkled his nose in confusement. “He actually does that?”
Mon tigre!!! Que vas-tu faire? Gabriel!!! Dites moi! Gabriel!! Madame, votre fils est là! Et il est furieux!  (My tiger! What are you doing? Gabriel!!! Tell me! Gabriel!! Madam, your son is here! And he is furious!)
Triumphant, Cas smiled. “Then why not?”
Translation French-English:
They spent that time chatting idly, Crowley petting the hellhound absentmindedly.
Castiel frowned a bit at that. "Really? That's pretty sad."
"Really? Huh. Imagine that. You done tinkering in there, boy?" he asked, jabbing a thumb at the shop.
Cas blinked. That seemed almost too codependent, but Sam had explained that his big brother D had basically raised him, since their dad was a deadbeat guy who barely acknowledged that he had kids, let alone cared for them. Cas was grateful for D to have raised Sam so well.
Castiel grinned and pulled out his phone. "He sent me this..." he whispered and opened the picture.
Bal was leaning against a lamppost, wearing a shit eating grin and another deep V-neck shirt. He pulled Cas into a tight hug and took his face between two hands. “Cassie, baby boy… you look…” He faltered, looked closer and blinked in surprise. “Oh crap. Did someone hurt my bestie?”
Cas seemed to think deeply. “I didn’t know Sam was… inclined that way,” he mused. Dean blinked. He knew, of course he knew. How often hadn’t he said he knew just about everything about the kid?  Except his initial religious streak, and how serious he was about Jessica, Dean had always been the Samuel William Winchester Encyclopaedia.
Translation French - English
M’excuser. (Pardon me)
Castiel turned to look at it and gasped. "A black Chevrolet Impala. Is it a sedan?"
Twenty minutes later, Canton NY far in his rearview mirror, Cas finally relaxed fully.
To say it hurt was an understatement. No, it was beyond agony!
Grumbling, Castiel left to go interview the poor wife of the guy with the loose pants.
"Gabriel Delacroix, you are indeed the worst. You are hereby obliged to come over for breakfast for the next four Sundays."
“I’ll be fine in a bit, Castiel. Don’t worry,” Sam replied, his voice only a smidge warmer than when he’d spoken to Jo.
Cas swallowed and wiped some stray sauce or grease from his bottom lip with his thumb. “Mmm that too. But at home, we hardly get burgers. Maman advocates a hearty and healthy meal.”
Dean stiffened, then relaxed and actually opened his mouth on a soft moan. “Mhhnn. fuck… Cas…so good.” Cas had to agree. This was beyond any kiss he had yet had. He hummed and slipped his tongue in Dean’s mouth, moaning as that sweet taste intensified. Dean gave as good as he got and their tongues danced around each-other for a while. Lack of oxygen had Dean pull back, breathing heavily.
They made their way inside and found Maman in the drawing room. “Castiel! Dean! What a pleasant surprise,” she said, only to fall silent at the entrance of Jack.
Dean chuckled. “Sammy is the same way, but I one upped him on that!”
“How did you do that?” he asked, once his staring yielded no result.
"Mr. Singer was my Dad. Call me Bobby," the man called over his shoulder, and made his way to the shop.
A deep chuckle, much too deep to be a kid's, was his reply. "Yeah you did. You said you found a bakery, now it seems your new...."
Cas scratched his neck nervously and bit his lip. “Well… I hoped we were, but…” He didn’t end that sentence.
Gingerly, Cas sat down next to Dean, minding the leg. “Dean… what… I mean… how… where…” All the questions tumbled together and none got asked. Dean studied him hungrily, as if he hadn’t seen Cas in ages.
"Cassie..." Gabriel hissed low. "Cassie!"
Dean smirked, holding up his hand, so the wings around his finger were catching the light just so. “Oh, it’s me alright. And I would appreciate it if you asshats did not refer to my husband as ‘pet’. It’s so degrading.” He slipped out his angel blade, and saw Cas shake his from his sleeve as well. “Who’s up for some mediterranian food?” he asked and raised the blade. “I think I’m in the mood for some kebab.” The fight was short and messy, and after taking pictures as proof for Crowley, Cas vanished all evidence. “Let’s get home, angel. I still need to check Baby’s cooling fluid,” Dean said, wiping his blade clean.
Castiel extended his hand. "Castiel Delacroix."
Dean glanced at the paper. "No problem... Castiel. Now scoot! Make that test, ace it."
“Sooooo, are you, like, an item?” Cas and Gabriel let go swiftly. Gabriel smiled at her. “What? No! I.. he...”  Cas licked his lips. “We’re brothers,” he stated, making both Bobby and Gabriel stare. “Ah,” the girl nodded. “Right. He was missing, and now he’s back, or something?” Gabriel’s eyes on Cas were warm and hinted towards tears. “Or something,” he agreed vaguely. Then he turned around and sighed. The girl took her silent cue, grabbed some clothes and stepped towards the door. “Right. Ok, I’ll just... go, then.” Gabe nodded. “Thanks for understanding, Emmy,” he said as she stepped outside. “It’s Anya...” she replied, a little hurt. Gabriel hummed awkwardly. “Oh.. Yeah, right,” he mumbled and closed the door. Cas shook his head. Gabriel would never change. But the matter at hand wasn’t his cousin’s way with women, it was what Gabriel might or might not have agreed on to get Cas back. As soon as they were all seated, or leaning on the table in Cas’ case, Gabriel gave an uncertain smile. “Heh. So. You’re back... from the dead,” he surmised redundantly. “Wow.” Cas narrowed his eyes. “What did you do, Gabriel?” he demanded to know.
French - English:
He shook his head, smiling. "Dean, you're not making sense."
He turned his head towards the window, and gasped. Those were the most amazingly green eyes he had ever seen! The face they were in wasn't unpleasant to see either and as a whole, it was a stunning thing to see on a dreary Monday morning.
Cas shrugged. “Why not. You didn’t believe me when I said I was an FBI agent, but you still asked me this. Good thing I know those things exist.” He dropped his French accent, and Danielle smirked, then sighed in relief. “Okay then. Good to know I’m not going cuckoo. A sprite you say?”
Gabriel scoffed. "Well, you got it anyway. See you Sunday, Cassie. And you might want to lock your door while I'm there." Without saying goodbye, he hung up.
Gabriel raised one eyebrow and tilted his head. “Seriously? You just barge in, no ‘Hello, nice to see you, after two, no, nearly three years.’ Bit disappointing, cousin.”
Joshua was their professor and one hell of a gardener. Cas and Dean both adored him. He was kind, and smart, and never one to not help you out when you had a problem. Right now though, Dean wasn’t too fond of him. “Dude… look! They put a black walnut in the bed of hydrangeas! How in the hell did they think that would work?” He furiously dug around in his notes and cussed. “I can’t chop down the fucking tree… Ugh… Damnit Joshua!  Right… so… Louisiana… Mmmh…” He flipped through his books and wrote down names.

Dean got his folder, but he didn’t open it. “Bobby, you didn’t do anything stupid, did you?” he demanded to know. Bobby crossed his arms and sat back, giving Dean a meaningful look. Dean lowered his head shyly and opened the folder. “Sorry…” He read, stopped to glance at Sam and Ellen, who both smiled and nodded. He read on, and when he was done, his face was pale and his eyes were wide. “I can’t..” he started, but Bobby interrupted.
"Come on, mes chers. We need to get going." Maman called and her men collectively sighed and followed her outside.
Biting back the angry retort, Castiel grimaced in what he hoped looked like a smile. "Thank you. But I really need to get to class. I don't know how I will, but I have to."
Castiel gaped at him. "Excuse you?!" he gasped.
Smiling brightly, Crowley spread his hands like he’d performed a neat trick. “Well, isn’t that today? So today was literally the only day she could ever show up on your doorstep!”
The only thing his father did was bite down on his lower lip.
Cas scoffed loudly. “Well, that backfired spectacularly then,” he scorned. “Father became convinced you were possessed, because of the sudden disappearance. We lived in France for seven years, with him religiously scouring the church records, the theological books and what not, to find an explanation for your behaviour. He became a Hunter, specialised in demons, and Old World monsters, teaching me right along with himself. When he had read all he could on the subject, he moved us back here, hoping to find you. To excorsise the demon from you.”
“Ok. I’m here,” he stated, slinging his duffle in a corner. “What do we have?”
Cas threw a sock at him, which he caught. “Come on. We have to go.”
Castiel jumped a bit. "I'm sorry, sir. I didn't see you there." he quickly apologised, and clambered out of the car, slightly hindered by Dean, who had to scramble out of the way before the door knocked his teeth out.
Cas shook his head. “No. So, I shall inform Annette of your stay. She can set an extra place for you.” He checked his phone. “It’s 8.23, so there is ample time. I hope she made croissants!” Chipper, he threw off his blanket, only to blush heavily as he noticed he was in just his boxers.
With a happy smile, Cas replied he’d be there and turned to Sam, who was also smiling. “D said he was gonna buy me Japanese, and then give me a ticket to this movie I want to see. It’s totally not his thing, so he is going out with his friend. I can walk home from the theater, or get an Uber, so I won’t bother him. Maybe I can get this guy I know to join me…”
Vraiment - really
Crowley hummed. “You care. You
First things first.
She wiped at her wet cheeks. “But how come Charles never found Jimmy and me? I moved us around a lot during his childhood, but once he turned eighteen, I figured it would be safe to put down roots. We have lived in Canton ever since.”
As he went down backwards, Cas caught a glimpse of tan and deep blue.
Zut alors (damnit)
Castiel smirked. He was fully awake now. Bantering with his brothers, even if only by text, was always a challenge and somehow invigorating.
Dean looked abashed. “I'm sorry, I’ll drink it.”
"Mon Dieu! Cassie! You look amazing! I swear, if you weren't my baby brother..."
Castiel sat on the stairs outside of the college, tapping out his message to Dean, and enjoying the late fall sunshine. He was pretty happy, considering the start of his day. Gabriel was right, even on days that started out like this one, somehow Castiel always came out fine. He leant back on his elbows and turned his face to the warm rays of the sun. He closed his eyes and let go of everything.The rumble of an engine cut through his bliss sooner than he thought it would. Not quite ready to open his eyes, Castiel stubbornly thought it could be any car. A car door slammed and footsteps came up to him.
"Bal, I think your reputation has preceded you again, my dear friend." Castiel leveled a glare at the men and lowered his voice so they couldn't hear. "Too bad we were only talking about driving my car, isn't it?" Balthazar bit his lip and his eyes were sparkling. The men ducked their heads and rushed inside.
He growled low.
Annette clapped her hands. "Ah! Mon petit tigre! I will set anozzur place for 'im."
This lady however, was more shrewd. “Agent Azure... basically agent Blue. Odd name,” she observed, her light brown eyes taking him in head to toe.
French to English
Dean drove home like he was in a dream. Cas liked him back… and they kissed. When he got back to the ranch, Sam and Ellen were smirking, and Bobby shook his wise old head. “Dude,” Sam said, and his tone of voice made Dean steel himself for an old fashioned ribbing. “You are
“Zut alors!” Cas sighed, rolling his deep-blue eyes up. “The honest truth, Sandy?” The girl did a double take at her name. She never gave it to him. “Your sister. She was very worried you had snuck out to have a rendez-vous and did not return. She alerted the police, but they had nothing to go on.” He pursed his lips in thought. How frank would he get? Just enough, he decided. “The unsolved case pinged my radar, so to speak. So I came to investigate. This is not the first of his kind I have dealt with, so when I found out what I was facing, I decided to take action.” He glared at her. “Next time a guy is being cute and just what you wanted, check him out. Dig deeper, and see the glamour. His kind isn’t picky about who they prey on.”
s'il vous plaît! (Please)
Dean did a spit take and coughed. “You... ehm… You’d like that?”
The plan had begun that night at Bobby’s. They had talked and talked until Sam, smart moose that he was, had said: “Why don’t you play to your strengths? Dean is awesome in designing gardens, picking out the problems and knowing what not to put next to each-other, while Cas knows exactly what plants draw which insects and other pollinators. The market is currently shifting towards having an environmentally friendly garden, while still being pretty and nice to sit in.” So now they were setting up a pollinator friendly landscaping business.
Rolling his eyes and his shoulders and neck, Castiel pocketed his phone and started his run.
"My little brother has the same quirk when stressed. Uncle Bobby will be here in ten, probably less. And after he has her hooked up, I will drive you to class in my Baby." He indicated the black car behind Sweetie.
Biting back a laugh, Cas eyed his cousin. “Vraiment? Mike? Mike Pike?” he snorted inelegantly.
"Hey hey hey. Cars are sensitive. I know my Baby can throw a fit if I am too rough with her."
“Gabriel?” Cas gasped and Dean relaxed. Gabriel. One of Cas’ few cousins that wasn’t a stuck-up douchebag. Gabriel smirked and lightly punched Cas in the shoulder.
Anna blanched, her vivid red hair and ice-blue eyes in stark contrast with her now alabaster skin.
Dean smirked and side eyed him. "No touchy feely moments, Cas. I don't do those."
A short shriek and the sound of falling china had Cas abandon his bees and run to the second floor. “Claire? Honey, is everything ok?” He pushed open the door to Claire’s room and found it empty. Dread filling him, he went to the master bedroom. There he found their 16 year old daughter, on her knees, holding what looked like the remnants of an angel statue. Cas stiffened. Angel? Oh no… His eyes darted to Dean’s side of the bed, where an angel figurine, one of the few things Dean still had of his mother, should be. It was gone. Imagining how devastated Dean must be when he found out, he turned towards the teen. “Claire! How often have I not told you that that is Dean’s and he is very fond of it?!”
Dean chuckled. “I wouldn't say that. You look...fine.” He handed the card back. “I'm 26.”
Cautiously, he turned the dial until it clicked off.
"Your uncle is quite the character," Castiel stated.
Dean chuckled and sipped his coffee. “Cas, you're awesome.”
Cas hugged him tight and kissed him deeply. “Me too, Dean. Me too. In the other dimension, only Gabriel made me feel like I belonged. And you, while you were there.” Dean gave a wry chuckle and kissed him back.
“Oh, you. When will you finally get that stick out of your ass?” Gabriel repined. “I’m hungry. There’s a Chinese restaurant on Main street. Can we all meet up there, please?”
Damnit, the demon had him dead bang. But who cared anymore, Cas was doomed anyway.
“So much the same, Cas. I want to meet this older brother, so he can give me the obligatory ‘if you hurt him, I’ll have your guts for a bolo-tie’ talk, and I want to know more about your bees...Castiel Novak, will you be my boyfriend?” Cas chuckled and Dean wiped at the tears that spilled.
“Hello, Gabriel,” Cas answered, glad to not have to look into those golden eyes and see the disappointment.
Weighing his options, Crowley squinted at him. “Princes of Hell. Four of them,” he finally said. “Azazel, Asmodeus, Remiel and Dagon. They’re old, Castiel. Older than most of us. And they’re powerful! Azazel was the most... ambitious. He was loyal to the big Plan. I don’t know what that is, but he once told me it was set in motion and it would happen one way or another. He did seem to like Jimmy best of all the choices.” Crowley shrugged. “I don’t know why. The kid is positively scrawny compared to some of the others, plus his ability is a passive one, where Max can move things telekinetically, and Andy can make people do what he wants, Jimmy just has those premonitions, or visions.” He smirked. “Quite useless, if I say so myself. But Azazel was positive James was going to be the One. The leader of the Demon Army that was supposed to march out of the Devil’s Gate. Never happened, never will happen. The nosy twats took the key with them, after they killed him. Inconsiderate I tell you.”
Cas took it and carefully picked the tape open and unwrapped the thing. “A work polo? That’s sweet, Dean but…” Cas’ voice petered out and Dean glanced up. Cas was staring at the polo, his fingers gingerly tracing the pattern Dean had painstakingly cross-stitched on the chest. Those slender fingers caressed the little bee and it’s cowboy hat, then ghosted over the saloon-style lettering and the minute blue flower on the honeycomb.  “Bee-haw…” Cas whispered, his eyes suspiciously shiny. “Bee-haw bee wrangling… Dean…”
He made his way to the door, where the girl Sandy, if his information was correct, was staring at the dead djinn and his victims, the ones Cas was too late to save.
All the windows in the station blew up, showering Cas with tiny shards of glass.
“No, sweeting, it should be me, saying I am sorry. You probably had a reason to take the angel, didn’t you?” Claire nodded, sniffling as two fat tears slipped from her eyes. Cas sighed. “And I bet Dean knows it… Right?” Another nod. Cas cuddled her close and kissed the golden curls. “Well then… Why don’t you and I go downstairs, have a drink and wait until Dean comes home from his grocery run. Then you both can explain it to me.” Claire gave him a watery smile and nodded one last time.
He wore clothes he’d never seen in his life. Torn jeans, a black T-shirt and a red button up. He must be having a heatstroke or a dream, or something. He patted his own cheek to wake up, while his other self blinked at him owlishly. The world… pulsed. It was like a shockwave hit them. Dean could feel how his feet lost purchase on the ledge and he tumbled over. Ok, so he was going to die. He closed his eyes.
aware of that?”
Grinning, Anna tapped her head. “See? That’s why we need you. You think differently. I’ll inform Gabe, you keep looking at the maps for sprite-territory.” She patted his shoulder and left.
“Well, can’t say you’re going slow, boy,” Ellen smirked, derailing Dean’s train of thought. “But I’m happy you decided to go for it. I think Castiel could be perfect for you.” Dean knew he was blushing, but a peck on the cheek from Ellen had him smile anyway. “Now bring that coffee inside. You can stay after, you know that, right?” Dean confirmed and said he would love an easy evening with Bobby and Ellen, before work the next day. Ellen smiled and bumped her fist to his biceps. “You know you can stay the night. Your rooms are always ready for you.”
“Whoa! That’s... wow,” Gabe marvelled. “But Cassie, bud, you need to relax too. Just stacking hunt on hunt isn’t gonna do you any favours, pal.”
Cas smiled back. “Mhh okay… Gotta say bye to Bal firs’. He’d miss me.”
"But it was just breakfast," he tried.
“Bumped? Dude you full on crashed into it. Solid mahogany and you smashed your leg right against the sharpest corner.” Cas snapped his head around.
That renewed the laughter, and Castiel was pleased to hear it.
Gabriel tilted his head. "Don't button up, and wear either trainers, or cowboy boots."
Gabriel just smiled and winked at Castiel, before hugging their father.
Cas sighed. He had eaten a lot, and his stomach was straining on the egg rolls and chicken kung-pao.
“Well, this is it, Kitten,” Crowley said, once again uncharacteristically sober. “I’d bid you farewell, if I didn’t know where you were headed.”
“Nothing, dear boy,” he drawled unconvincingly. “Even in Hell there is something called integrity. Make a deal, keep it. Like I said, there was a distraction. I had them make noise a county over. Not in town, but just close enough to have her Hunter side flare up. She read the omens and to keep James safe, she went to investigate. She’s a mom. It’s kind of in the job description. Naomi doesn’t hunt, unless it is close enough to be a threat to her or James. Always was this way.”
Which, as of last night, was yet another day nearer.
“He wasn’t forever, Chuckles, if that’s what you’re asking.”
With a smirk, Cas left the restaurant, bowing his head against the autumn chill. It was autumn again, and his birthday was coming up. Six months from that, the calendar in his head would end. Permanently. What would he leave? Not much. Just Honey, his weaponry and his clothes. And Gabe and Anna, but they would learn to live without him.
The dust and heat did nothing to make him more comfortable. He’d tied his green plaid button up around his waist, but still the sun beat down on him mercilessly, the very air oppressive. Cas trudged down the road, his feet scuffing up clouds of dust that tickled his parched throat even more. His mind was swirling. Last thing he remembered was Juliet, sinking her teeth in his esophagus and windpipe, the acid of her saliva searing away his flesh. And now he was up and walking. Whole, as it were.
He bit down on his lower lip at his boldness. Would Dean think him forward? And again, why would he, Castiel, care? Waiting for Dean to answer, he swiftly added the number to his contacts. He barely saved it, when his phone buzzed again. Glancing around, to see if he wasn't bothering his fellow students, he quickly read the text.
Both Gabriel and Dean bowed their heads and muttered softly: “Yes Ma'am.”
Cas merely blinked. “Absurde! The best demon is a dead one.” He stood, clearly ending this conversation. “Well, maman,” he said, sarcasm ladled thick on the moniker. “As you have seen, I am in perfect health, both physical and mental. Do tell Bobby not to worry so much. The old nounours could get a high bloodpressure.” He guided his mother from the cabin, pushing her gently in the back. Naomi was objecting softly, but she went. “Castiel!” she called, just before he wanted to close the door. He stayed his hand, quirking one eyebrow at her. “Quoi?” he wanted to know.
Gabriel shook his head, which was buried in Cas’ coat. “No. Never letting you go again, little brother.” It was muffled but obviously spoken with a tear choked voice.
All Naomi did was shake her head, hands stil covering her eyes.
Castiel awoke from his pleasant daydream about sitting in the garden with a good book.
“Tell me I did not kiss you on the cheek…”
Dean said nothing and Cas looked up at him. They stared at each other, until a bright voice broke the spell. “Cassie! What are you doing here?”
“Well… can always get back at him…” He shrewdly side-eyed Dean. “Could smooch you…”
Castiel smiled at the warm tone and the gruff voice.
Danielle tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Do you believe in... fairies?” She almost whispered it, but Cas heard her.
Gabriel narrowed his eyes. “What’s cooking, Grumpy Smurf? You told me you would take a breather here. And that’s exactly what you’re gonna do. Anna is out, and I am leaving. Feel free to use any of the beds.” And with that, he bounced off the bed and dashed through the door. Hearing the soft click of the lock, Cas slumped. Typical of Gabriel, but Cas had to admit two things to himself. 1. Gabe was right. Cas would’ve followed if he hadn’t locked the door, and 2. He was dead tired. His vision was swimming, now the adrenaline was finally receding.
“Yup!” Gabriel happily interrupted. “And I’m glad of it! Now at least one of you is a great Hunter.”
The guy chuckled low and extended a, surprisingly slender, hand. "Sam."
Sam smiled warmly and shoved him a bit.
Sitting up straight, Cas glared at his cousins. “I have hunted alone for nearly a decade. And I still live. My training at the Milton compound has helped, I agree, but I have hunted alone more than I have hunted with a partner. As you said yourself, Gabriel, I’m just not a teamplayer.”
Maman ruffled his hair. “Then they must be special, non? You are not one to easily open up to strangers.”
He hung up and concentrated on the drive, humming along with the radio.
Cas sighed, but a smile tugged at the lefthand corner of his mouth. “I just wanted you to know I’m on my way. I’ll be there in about an hour.”
A laugh rolled through the air and the door opened. “It’s you alright. Only you can make a cuss sound that sexy.”
Jack smiled back and extended his hand to Papa. “Hello, I am Jack. I am the new son of Castiel and Dean. Can I call you Gramps, or would you prefer the French equivalent?”
hein - eh
That only got emphasised when the door opened and Lisa stepped through. She looked even cuter in her mismatched knee high socks, black and white plaid pleated skirt and denim jacket with patches. Her hair was tied in a high ponytail and adorned with cute clips. What made her shine though, was the radiant smile she wore. “Hi guys!” she called and waved cheerfully at them, winking at Dean. His face heated instantly. “Dean,” Lisa continued, tone curious. “Why are you in my seat? Your regular one next to Castiel is free.”
Luce pouted his lips. “Huh... right... L'avez-vous embrassé?”
He peeled off his jacket and cut it to strips to use as tourniquets for the surviving victims.
“Half. My father is French, so he raised me bi-lingual,” he admitted. “I have been born in the US, but we spent seven years in France. Please, just wait at the door while I cut him loose.”
Dean’s vacation had flown by. With the bees gone, he slept in every day, mainly because he was having such nice dreams about the guy who had taken them. Dean sighed as he stripped the bed. Too nice dreams, maybe. He had changed his linens eight times in these three weeks. He set the timer on his washing machine and put his jeans, t-shirt and plaid flannel on. It was still hot during the days, but with his line of teaching, he needed the layers. Of course he had visited his teaching aide daily. Imp needed her brushing routine done, and of course her food and exercise. Today was the last day Dean could spend a long amount of time with her, without students flocking around them.
Wiping his hand across his brow, he smeared a thick line of blood over it and he winced.
Bobby gave Cas a shrewd look. “You were raised there? So you know all the quirks and spots?” Cas smiled and nodded. “Is the price realistic?” Bobby continued. Cas tilted his head at the screen and sighed. It wasn’t. Of course his money driven mother would want the highest possible price.
Gabriel glanced around, arms spread wide, his cognac eyes sparkling with glee.
Sam actually smiled at him and nodded. They got their phones out and checked. As Cas had suspected, his was from Dean.
“Ah! Mon loup! Mais… ‘oo is zat? You haf anozzur guest?” Annette looked surprised and yet happy.
Dean blinked in confusion, but sat back. “What the hell, Cas? What are you waffing about?”
Cas looked into those wonderful, green eyes and licked his lips.
“Still doesn’t tell me how you found me, mother,” he intoned with a nasty, uncaring emphasis on the moniker. “Did you pester Bobby?” If she had, Castiel would give her a bigger piece of his mind than he’d already planned.
it. Castiel glanced around. With his six feet, he wasn't the tallest in this crowd, but he did rank in the top few. Gabriel was just 5'8", but his flamboyant attitude made up what he was lacking in height.
connard impertinent (impertinent asshole)
Gabriel recoiled slightly, then deadpanned.
Dean nodded. “They do, but sometimes they get bored and try a different thing, or they are hungry or thirsty enough to ignore the bitter taste.” Dean let Imp trot a  bit to the side. “Hey, wanna help me check for the weed in the other meadow?” he asked, holding out a hand. Cas blushed deeply at the thought of being pressed against Dean’s back on the back of Imp.
He patted Cas on the hand, making tingles shoot all the way up Cas’ arm, to the nape of his neck. Cas swallowed and cleared his throat. “Yes. I’d like that. Goodbye Dean.”
Dean actually blushed at the unwittingly dealt praise. “It’s perfectly okay, Cas. The owner of  the design is fine with you using it. In fact… it was designed just for you.”
Castiel nearly uttered a totally undignified squeak when his phone buzzed in his pants pocket during a very boring lecture from professor Dawson. It kept buzzing, so it was a call. He declined it and after a swift glance at the ratty professor, he checked his phone. Dean? Dean had called him? Another glance around, told him several of his fellow students were dozing and several others were listening to music or on their own phone. A blush rising in his cheeks, Castiel tapped out a message to Dean.
Castiel grinned by now. "I'll make sure it's ready for you," he assured.
He had a bone to pick with a certain demon...
His mother came hurrying up to him. "Mais Castiel! What is wrong?" she demanded.
Once his stomach was sufficiently empty, Cas sat back, panting. “Dean?”
Standing in the humid, clammy cellar, Cas wrinkled his nose at the smell of stale water. “Oh mon Dieu,” he groaned. “Didn’t they have the sense to build away from the spring?”
His mouth too full to audibly answer, Dean nodded. A big swallow later, he finally spoke.
oooOooo
Dean ducked his head and smiled. “Nice to meet you, Sir.” Then he gave Maman the same courteous hand kiss he had given Annette. “Madame, enchanté.”
Juliet’s ears pricked up, and she started growling.
Branleur - wanker
Cas smiled and kissed him back. “Of course.” They chatted some more with Donna and Jody, when suddenly Cas nudged him and pointed at their brothers, who were sitting very close. “Are they…” Cas wondered.
Dean blinked. In the background, Lady GaGa was crooning about not picking up her phone. “Who hurt you, Cas?” Dean looked him over and if Cas had been sober, he would have been mollified by the worry. Now it stoked his anger.
Cas shot up. “Merde! We still need to tell Annette you’re here!” He turned to Dean, who looked delectable, and pecked him on the mouth. “Please… we should get that done in time. We only have eight minutes before Maman gets up!”
“Who.. who are you? And... where’s mommy?” the first one one stammered as she recovered. She was at least Cas’ age and he loathed the djinn even more for degrading her like this.
"Really, Papa?" Gabriel whined. Papa demonstrated his stiff upper lip and just raised an eyebrow.
Maman blushed and swatted his arm. "You silver tongued boy! Flirting with your own Maman."
The idea that Cas was going to suddenly be gone again, had Dean in a slump more and more. “Dean, sweetheart, I’m still here,” Cas said one Saturday, when he caught Dean staring at the wall in silence.
Gabriel glared at Castiel, who was all ready to go.
That was a lot in one text, but after a glance in his calendar, Castiel quickly settled the date with Bal. A first evening out that wasn't with Gabe or Luce! He did state that he wanted to drive himself, since the evening might still be a bust and he needed a ride back. He wasn't telling Bal that he wouldn't drink, which meant he could get out any time he wanted.
“July 18th?” he mumbled, quickly doing the mental math. Four months. He somehow lost four whole months!
"Cassie..." Gabriel was pleading.
Dean tilted his head. “But you said you loved me almost immediately.” Something didn’t really add up here. Cas blushed and ducked his head.
Don’t hate me! It’s just a short while, promise!
When Dean stepped out of the kitchen, Cas’ breath stocked. He looked stunning in his suit. “Relax, babe. We’re gonna be fine. See? I’m all ready.” He twirled around his axle.
Cas licked his lips, chasing the taste of Dean on them, and smiled. “I would. Dean, I want to get to know you. Why Sam is a lawyer, what place Bobby and Ellen have in your lives, how you got to have Imp, who I think is the most beautiful and sweet horse, what your hobbies are… All that and more.” Dean was blushing deeply with his head ducked, but his smile was pleased. He cupped Cas’ face in his hands and kissed him in such a tender way, tears sprang to Cas’ eyes.
“Jesse forever,” he read. “Who’s Jesse then?” Pamela closed the doors and with her arms full of paraphernalia walked past the cousins.
Castiel huffed a laugh. "No, Dean. I didn't."
Cas was still biting his lip though. “A- and you’re not mad at me for just doing it? For assuming you are gay?”
French - English:
Mes enfants, (my children)
oooOooo
That got him an impressed nod and pout. “So our little wencher is indeed causing all of this?” Gabe wondered. “That low-down scumbag. I wonder if the Mrs. knows about this. Mike should really watch his back.”
"I wasn't even thinking about that," he admitted. "I'm just impressed with your hands..."
The car was pulled over to the curb and through the window, Castiel could see Gabriel’s apartment building. With his arms folded, Castiel stubbornly stared at the building entrance.
Castiel bit his cheek so as not to laugh and quickly forwarded the file.
Castiel sighed. "It's ok, Maman. I have slept here, and I am still a virgin. Gabriel and Lucien are overreacting. I'm going to get ready for the day. I am going to a car show with a friend."
assume to know his mind.”
A muscle ticked in Cas’ jaw. “Hello, Crowley,” he answered stiffly.
“Luce, he is the ultimate big brother. He wouldn't think Wonder Woman good enough for me, yet he still thinks each and every person that I talk to is a potential partner, or a threat to my virtue.”
His throat clicked when he tried to swallow again. He didn’t get how he got out. He couldn’t fathom
Cas loved the man with all his heart, being the father he’d thought he’d never have. From the day they’d hit US soil, Chuck had dumped Cas on Bobby’s doorstep often enough. It was where he’d met Gabriel, whose parents did the exact same, leaving Anna at their aunt, Hester. Bobby had become their surrogate father, and the cousins close as brothers as it was possible to get, seeing each other every couple of months.
"So, that was the first time I ever saw you do anything but pay attention in class." Sam noted.
The tips of her knife-like teeth punctured little holes, the saliva burning them wider.
Je ne me soucie pas de ce qu'il pense. Il est insignifiant. Je crains qu'il te blesse.” (I don't care what he thinks. It is insignificant. I'm afraid he'll hurt you.)
Cas shook his head at him.
That earned Castiel a raised eyebrow.
Jimmy’s eyes widened even more, and he flat out gaped now.
Castiel followed her into the kitchen.
The stranger threw his head back and laughed out loud, his whole body arching back with mirth.
"I know, Gabe. But how will I learn if you don't allow me to make my own?"
Quickly weighing his options, Cas made a decision. “A sprite, perchance?”
Merde - shit
Cas nervously twirled his gold ring around his finger as he looked for Dean. “Dean! We’re going to be late!”
“Sure looks like it, sweetheart. That would bring a lot of trouble.” Dean was a bit in two minds about it. He would love for Sam to find a partner too, especially one who knew about the Life and was able to handle it, but on the other hand… it
Cas nodded. “And no idea how I got there.” He glanced at Bobby. The older Hunter grimly nodded once. With a sigh, Cas continued. “Only clue I have is this,” he offered, lifting his shirt again.
Castiel felt his heart rise in his chest. "You would?"
Cas shrugged. “I don’t know. I thought I might be ace, but now… I think I am developing feelings for this friend.” He held up his phone.
Zut alors! - Well darn!
“He was so carefully not looking that way. But also blame yourself. Is that...” he sniffed slightly. “...Estée Lauder’s White Linen you’re wearing?”
Papa sat down at his usual spot and smiled at everyone. “Well now. This is a happy sight. Boys, could you introduce us? I would like to know whom I am addressing.”
The hallucinations were the main reason Cas finally turned to go back to the cabin. He figured that when the very trees and rocks start having faces, it is time to face the music.
Naomi sighed deeply and gulped.
Unaware of Cas’ unease, Dean grinned and stood. “Great. See ya, Cas!”
Castiel said nothing, just glared harder.
Basically it was all Cas’ doing. He had asked Sam, as a lawyer, to come along to the viewing with Bobby and Ellen, and he had also texted Gabriel to tell him about the plans. Since it was about his surrogate parents, Dean had wanted to tag along too.
Castiel, Cassie to his big brothers, Lucien and Gabriel, sighed. Lucien had good reason to refuse Gabriel and Gabriel
UGH! It was really way too early on a Sunday for that message. Castiel rubbed the heels of his hands in his eyes to at least get them to stay open. Knowing Luce had to work, and he was eagerly awaiting Castiel’s answer, Castiel started typing.
The next message was a picture of Gabriel. His face filled the screen and Castiel smothered a laugh. Gabriel, long locks messy in an obvious bedhead, had his golden eyes in full puppy mode and his lips were pouting. Overall and from an objective point of view, it was adorable
“Hey, Gabey,” Cas tried, smiling softly. Gabriel sobbed and hugged him tight enough to give Cas difficulty breathing. “Gabriel… need… air,” he gasped.
Cas’ jaw dropped. “Your… Oh. Oh my word… D…” He slapped his hand to his face. “Next time a professor calls me smart, I’m gonna contradict him. Sam calls you D, you call him Sammy. And all the while I thought those were four different people. I am an idiot, and don’t you dare say I am not. Obvious as your green eyes… Merde.. Je suis un fous. Incroyable…”
Castiel jumped a bit when a hand landed on his shoulder. "You made a good impression, Cas. C'mon. We're taking Baby. No need to take two high pollution cars, when we can share, right?"
Ok, not too bad. It seemed his brothers thought him hiding, not going out on his own. A bit more sure of himself, he scrolled on.
Slipping his fingers to the bloody neck, Cas felt for a pulse. It was there, if weak.
Charles chuckled and ruffled the blonde hair of his new grandson. “I would love to be your Gramps, son.” He sat down and gestured for them all to do the same. “You know, Jack, when your.. ehm… when Castiel got married to Dean, I was a little sad they would not give me grandchildren, but then Dean, smart man that he is, told me that I forgot about the most beautiful option for any couple that could not reproduce, straight or gay: adoption. And I am very happy they have found you, dear boy. You look like a good kid.”
He jumped out of bed, in an amazingly good mood, sang during his shower and whistled as he sat down to his breakfast. His parents were of the European persuasion that breakfast, and preferably dinner, were family time, and he agreed. It had a certain peaceful quality. His days started so much better with a little chat with Maman or Papa. Today Maman told Papa about the tricks Gabriel had pulled on Castiel yesterday, and hearing them like that, after all the dust had settled, they were kind of funny. Except the one where he had taunted Castiel about Dean. He wasn't sexually attracted to him. But he did like him as a person, and he didn't like that someone he liked got pulled into Gabriel’s filthy fantasies. Papa had a laughing fit that was contagious so the entire meal ended in good spirits, and Castiel got to college smoothly, since Sweetie was purring like a kitten once more. Life was certainly perking up.
He put his phone on speaker and called Gabriel.
He snapped out of it. "Sorry... zoned out, I'm afraid. You can? How?"
“He doesn’t flaunt it,” Dean merely said. Cas nodded, but Donna and Jody wanted to know if Dean knew how Sam identified. “Mh. Not sure. But if you ask me, the kid doesn’t care what bits you have. He’s about the person.” The ladies nodded.
"You're right, little brother... I think Luce and I might be a bit overbearing at times."
care about a guy you only saw once in your life. Humans. You’ll never cease to amaze me.” He sighed, regret etched on his face. “I am sorry, Castiel. Time is almost up.”
Juliet huffed out another cloud of sulphur and licked Crowley’s hand with a forked tongue.
That made Dean raise his eyebrows. "Then why do you study it?"
Cas followed him a pace behind. “Why were you so upset, Sam? Can I help?” he offered genuinely, once they were out of earshot from the cafeteria.
Crowley looked around and sighed. “A Devilstrap? Really, Kitten? Why? Don’t you trust me?”
A gruff voice interrupted him. "Naah, not me, boy. This car has only been touched by Dean. He wouldn't hear of anybody else even lookin' at her."
“Oh no...” he managed, before the owner of the voice came into view, arms spread widely in a gesture of disbelief.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel rolled his eyes. "Gabe..."
Mon petit tigre! (my little tiger. Term of endearment)
Dean came closer, his hand cupping the back of Cas’ head, his eyes dipping towards Cas’ lips. “Cas…” he whispered. “Shut up and kiss me already.”
The man chuckled. "Well, my uncle has a garage slash scrapyard just outside of town. I'm a mechanic there. I can give her a quick look-see."
The smile widened, turned into a grin. "How rude of me. Balthazar, Balthy to lovers or Bal to friends." Castiel shook his hand and tried to pull his own free, but Balthazar held on. "Do you trust me, Cassie?" he asked softly.
Dean smirked. “It’s like a backwards striptease. I like it. Plus… those clothes? Oof… barely a difference between on or off.”
“Yes,” Jimmy replied snidely. “I bet that’s why she broke up with father. She hated that he was one of you.”
Castiel groaned. "Gabe, I know you and Luce are gay, but..."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Come on, baby bro... I was just watching out for you..." The annoying bit was that Gabriel meant it, and Castiel knew it.
Balthazar chuckled. "Oh, Cassie. You sound like a textbook!" He pondered it for a moment. "Scratch that, darling. You sound like the anthropomorphic personification of Sex, reading a textbook."
“I haven’t seen father in over a decade,” he explained. “He could be dead for all I know. Even within the life, he is considered a recluse. He’ll pop up, dead or alive. But don’t you
His beaten down posture calmed Castiel too. “That would be vampires. Officially, werewolf is silver to the heart, but beheading is often a good idea, regardless of the type of monster.”
do. And Luce categorically refuses me."
French to English:
he thought, biting back an acidic remark. "I can't seem to find any of my good pants. Do you have any idea where they are?"
Juliet huffed, and thick, yellowish vapour rose from her maw and nose. It smelled of sulphur.
Jack swallowed his nougat and nodded. “Okay… Dad. So, Papa… Who are we going to see first?”
“I like ya, Castiel, but you look like Death warmed over. Stay here a while and git yer feet back under ya,” the old man had grumbled.
Annette bent over. "I know you are loath to wear ze jeans to school, monsieur, but..." She held up the tight jeans he had worn to the club. With a muttered thanks, he took them and shot into the bathroom.
Naomi let her eyes wander the sparsely furnished cabin and sat down on the very edge of a chair.
Cas guessed that with a creature built for messy, torturous kills, this was merciful.
When they got downstairs, Cas heard muffled voices from the drawing room and smiled. “I wonder who Gabriel’s guest is. He rarely brings friends over.”
Vaguely, Cas noticed his nails were digging into his palms, and there were arms around him, tugging. He shook his head and his vision cleared a little. He was nose to nose with his twin. Anna was trying to pull Jimmy away from him, while Gabriel was doing his damnedest to pull Cas back. Cas growled. He’d never been this angry in his life.
And with that, my second Destiel Buzzy Bee Bang fic ends.
Castiel nodded, fighting down the blush that crept up his neck. "Sure. I don't mind riding shotgun."
The saliva itself seemed acidic and burned even worse than the claws.
“After raising your soul and rebuilding your body, one might say we bonded pretty profoundly,” his angel sassed. Dean licked his lips. Right. That bit… He always tended to forget how much effort that must have taken from Cas.
Calmez-vous - calm yourself
Sandy narrowed her eyes at him. “But how did you know?”
I’m sorry for not being consistent in updating this fic. My Muse is being fickle and left for a long time, and my tablet died on me, making me fear I'd lost the whole thing. Thank Chuck it wasn’t gone. When hubster saw me frown at this fic on AO3, musing if I should delete it, (3 weeks after the tablet went poof) he told me it probably was saved in the cloud, since he arranged for the docs to be backed up there.
“Those boys have some sad secret, and it’s enough to make me cranky. I just hope they can solve it. Now, got any JW Blue for me left? Or did ya finish it all?” Jack waved his hand again, making the air solidify and the window to the world disappeared. Dean blinked at the spot where it had been.
Cas looked at Dean, and they both started laughing.
A hand on his ass made Sam stiffen and glance to the side. “Looking like a match made in… well no.” Gabriel wrinkled his nose in distaste. “They look like the perfect gay cake topper.” He rubbed Sam’s butt. “And you look like you belong in my arms.”
has a crush on
Leaving kudos isn’t just for me, but also for Dmsilvis and PieDarling, xHarukax and Jaeh, our mods. Thanks for doing this again! -*Snugs all*-
Castiel took the extended hand in his own. Calluses chafed his palm and he was impressed with the hidden muscle power he could feel there.
“Next time,
Dean frowned a bit and tried to get back to the fun part. “What about him? I texted him…Told him I found you and was gonna stay over.”
Cas tilted his head at her. “Jimmy was right? What do you mean?”
“Heya cous! Just the speaker? Not your eardrums? You’re learning fast, buckaroo!”
The men huddled together and started whispering. Castiel caught Balthazar’s name and a few of the men made an 'aaahhh' movement with their heads.
“Oh Cassie!” Gabriel crowed, delighted. “I never thought I would hear you say such a thing! Be still my heart!”
Cas wiped, but found nothing. Chuckling, Dean  came nearer.
He pulled his knife free and dropped it on the corpse for now, to check his message.
Sam was crushing on the man?
Cas pulled Dean in and kissed him deeply. “Thank you, my sweet Dean. It’s the most perfect gift ever. But what about dinner? Isn’t that going to be awfully late?” Dean just smiled enigmatically and pulled him back in to kiss him more. When the doorbell rang, he danced out of Cas’ grip and ran to the door. “That will be our dinner!” Cas hung his head and chuckled.
The art of Dean in this chapter is by the amazing Emblue_sparks. I just love it!
In the end they agreed that Cas would indeed pay off his controlling parents and then they would find jobs, until Dean could buy in on Cas’ business and make it theirs. At that point Joshua walked up to them and told them about job openings he knew in the city planning department. Dean had to sit down and take it all in. Jody hugged him close, invited Gabriel along for dinner and said that tomorrow was a great day to set all these future plans in motion.
“What am
Gabriel pouted. "But your ass looks soooo nice in these jeans!" he called after Castiel’s retreating back.
"That good?" he managed, his voice a bit more hoarse than usual.
Translation translation French - English:
He started giggling, making some things align in Castiel’s brain. "You?! You messed with my pants?!" he burst out.
"Now, Jeanette, the boy is just an astute observer." Papa said, patting Gabriel on the back. "Good morning, son. You look fine today."
Oh my… That’s hilarious! Dude...he’s my baby brother!”
“... don’t know why you keep taking in these strays, Bobby,” Rufus groused, but his eyes had an admiring look.
Dean gave a watery chuckle and took a deep breath. “C’mon in. Don’t mind the mess. Bobby ain’t the best housekeeper, but he’s the best mechanic this side of Kansas.” Mechanic? Cas blinked. Dean sighed again and rubbed his neck. “I’ll try and explain later. Just… just come sit with me.”
The voice was deep and gravelly, and it slipped into Dean’s abdomen. He sat up, disorientated. He… he seemed to be wearing the clothes the other him had on, back on the roof. He stood and took in his surroundings. It looked like his school hallway, but less dank and somber. The dark haired guy came back and took his hand. “Get up, lazy bones. Time for class.” Dean followed the kid, taking in his casual clothing. Dark jeans, ripped even worse than his own, a dark t-shirt with a phoenix on it in loud shades of yellow and orange, emblazoned with the word ‘Rise’, and a button up in purple plaid. What the hell? Why hadn’t principal Adler jumped the guy yet? Especially with him wearing earrings as well, Dean now noticed. The guy’s right ear was adorned by a silver ring with a longish piece of delicate silver chain dangling from it, as well as a simple little silver bar. Then another, smaller silver ring next to that, and two little studs with a black stone even further up the ear.
"Dear Castiel’s car... I am sorry for calling you a bucket of bolts. Please accept my humble apology." He glanced up at his brother, who nodded.
Dean nodded vigorously. "Mmmm. Almost like it's homemade..." He moaned again, and kept on humming and moaning all through the whole slice. Castiel felt his cheeks burn as several fellow students walked by and sniggered.
Big Dutch hugs.
Cas glared at him. “How the Hell did my mother find me? She was
Sweetie rumbled softly, as cas steered her onto the lot at Uncle Bobby’s. Dean came out of the shop, wiping his hands on a rag and smiling broadly. As soon as Castiel parked, Dean was squatting next to his open window.
! To hear how protective Naomi was towards his brother, and yet she’d left him with Chuck, not looking back.
The door opened, and his cousin jumped from the cabin.
Gabriel broke, his face turned red and his eyes were flashing amber.  “No!” he barked. “You don’t understand! I tried. Goddamnit! I fucking
Castiel smiled. "No. Not really. I jogged here."
Before either cousin could answer, he ducked in, slammed the door shut, started the engine and eased his way around the truck in a way that should’ve been impossible with a big car like his.
"Good god, Cassie... I know you're my brother but... damn!!!" He stretched the last word so long that it contained more syllables than usual.
Salaud - bastard
Cas quickly set up his things and blew out a harsh breath. He’d hoped to not have to do this, ever, but he had the means and he needed answers.
Dean chuckled and reached out his right hand. "That's right, we were so busy with your car, that I forgot to give my name... sorry about that. It's Dean. Dean Winchester... Yes, like the gun brand..."
“Mmmm, Cassie, you sound so sexy when you’re snippy in French.”
Cas pulled up one of the motel chairs and sank onto it. “I’m not here for pleasantries, Gabriel. And you know it,” he growled, a tension in his words.
Gabriel’s eyes grew wide in horror. "No! What's wrong with her? Oh, wait, you’re as mechanically apt as a seamonkey... so, what did you do? Call AAA?"
Not looking at her, Cas hummed noncommittally. There was another reason, but that had nothing to do with Balthazar, and he wasn’t about to tell her.
Cas sighed. Dean and him had been dating for almost a month, and tonight Dean said he wanted to surprise Cas with something he had been working on for a while now. To say Cas was nervous, was an understatement. ‘A while’ was an uncertain amount of time, but Cas had the distinct idea Dean had been working on it for weeks at least. That was a lot, and it made Cas feel humbled already. There was a knock to the door, and when he opened it, Dean was standing there, cheeks pinked and biting his lip. “Hello, Dean,” Cas greeted warmly.

Cas hated to admit it, but Dean was right. As the younger sibling, he did tend to try and convince the world of his adulthood by being serious and not joke around. Lighten up and live a little… The phrase made Cas think. “Dean,” he said as Dean pulled his amazing black car up to Cas’ van. Dean hummed and turned off the engine, before turning sideways to face Cas. “... by ‘lighten up and live a little’... Do you mean I should go with my impulses at times?”
When they had exited the cars at the house, the realtor had been accompanied by a mischievous looking, 5’ 8” guy that had shot a quick wink at Cas. “Sirs,” the lady had purred with a British accent. “I’m Bela Talbot. This gentleman here is the eldest son of Mrs. Novak. He insisted on being present.” Dean had caught Cas biting back a smile and quickly feigned interest.
That Dean would be late, was a given, since he was going to see a damned movie first. So waiting like a lovesick puppy outside the club was stupid. He turned away and walked back to Sweetie, determined to have a good time.
Face one big puzzle of confusion, Gabriel spread his arms. “What? What are you saying? That

This time he got an eyebrow-waggle. “It is if you do the jerking. Or you let me jerk you.”
Annette had just served tea, when the door opened again and Gabriel bounced in. “Hellooo! We’re here… You have

idiots to bring us food, and they forget to bring it!”
A soft kind of smile pulled around Crowley’s mouth. “This,” he said, patting the shoulder of that beast lovingly. “Is Juliet. She is my best hellhound. You should be honoured I’m letting her reap you.”
"Why?"
Cas shuddered internally. He wasn’t interested. He never was. Not since Balthazar.
he was there, actually they had all been
"Ah, but Castiel, you must agree, 'e is more of a cunning tiger, zan a brave lion."
Once Dean could travel and they got home, friends and family got notified and despite the simple ceremony, stuff had to be settled. But now the big day had arrived… and Dean was scared. “Dean, calm down,” Sam soothingly said, resulting in his brother snapping his head around and glaring at him. Exasperated, Sam rolled his eyes and glared right back. Minutes passed and neither brother said a word. Eventually, Dean turned on his heel and resumed pacing and biting the cuticle and nail on his thumb.
Maman gave the boy a bright if brittle smile. “Ah… mon loulou… Of course… If you want, you can call me… Mamie. It means Granny.”
Sacre bleu - Holy shit (lit. Holy blue. Idk either)
"Oh, that's precious! I gotta remember that! Uncle Bobby doesn't allow cussing in the shop, but if he doesn't know it's cussing..."
Sam sighed and nodded. “If that ever happens,” he agreed, hitting ‘send’.
“Y’ello! You got the one and only Gabe! What can I do you for?” yodelled his cousin through the speaker. “Tout les dieux! Gabriel, you nearly bust my speaker.” Chuckles sounded and Cas just knew Gabe had done it on purpose.
"Gabriel! You are the worst!!" Castiel sneered into his phone.
Sam patted him on the back and shook his head, so his longish hair swished along his cheeks. “Nah, no problem, dude. That’s what friends do.”
French to English:
Castiel smirked. "Ok. Cars are the exception. I get it."
Naomi’s gaze went blank. “No wonder I never heard from him. I have heard plenty about Chuck Shurley though. He’s supposed to be one badass Hunter, only surpassed by his.... son.” She looked up at Cas, a mixture of regret, pain and pride on her face.
A soft glow in the backyard had him direct his steps that way. All the way at the very end of the garden, Dean was standing, a soft light creating a halo from behind him. He had never looked more beautiful. “Heya Cas,” Dean softly greeted.
Cas soothingly patted Dean on the arm and smiled. “Don’t fret, love. From the middle ages on, elves generally seem to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty. I thought it was a sweet way of Annette to say she thinks you’re beautiful. N'est-ce pas, Annette?”
Gabriel shrugged. “I know, but Nanna always said you were as close as a grandchild to her, and she never changed that. Besides… what better way to have Chuck and Rachel out of your life, than to use my Nanna’s money to start your business? They only paid this study for you, so they could try and blackmail you into coming back into the fold. Pay them off with the trust fund set up for you by the one person they hated most, and be free.”
