<< All this is beautiful, Jawn >> Sherlock whispers in his ear, while John bites his neck.
Cause the shouting of the men outside the locker room, the sauna master enters the retractable door and finds himself pointed at the eyes of those present.
<< Sherlock brought him here to get him used to the people >> says the waitress. << Can I give him a piece of bread? >> whispers to him the girl, as if it were a state secret. John looks at the puppy, that tilts his head to the side curiously.
<< Sure >> Sherlock smiles at him.
John go into the living room while Greg, breathlessly, come in.
<< Not now, Morgan >> John whispers, keeping the leash firm. They have already been lucky to enter in the hospital, saing to the nurses that Morgan is a police dog and, despite this, many people are giving them unkindly looks.
<< Where we going? >> ask William.
"For the people, are 'crazy' those that are capable of doing what they do not have the courage to act", Moriarty points out now, reappearing in his thoughts. "You are capable to observe and for this reason you are 'mad'. You use drugs and that's why you're 'crazy'. You don't eat or sleep to keep up with your cases and that's why you're 'crazy'. You like men and that's why you're 'crazy'. You are denying the voices of your brother and Johnny-boy and for this you are 'mad'. "
<< Angelo, listen ... >> burst out Johnm determined to clarify .
<< A little, but I want to stay awake and watch you sleep >>.
<< Still with this story! >> shouts, raising his hands to heaven.
<< And I am grateful to you! >> retorts in tone, the gaze fixed on her. << Yes, I'm a  consulting detective. My name is Sherlock Holmes and I'm investigating a murder case on behalf of Paddington, the owner of the Ski Club. When I woke up I didn't know where I was. I didn't know who you was or why did you keep me here. I lied to protect myself, Mary. And you? Why did you do lie me? >>.
<< It's time to learn, John >>. The doctor snorts and puts on contact lenses with difficulty.
It is not even ten pm when John arrives at 221B. Bach welcomes him, by announcing that the great  consulting detective is meditating on the case from which he raised him. The curiosity to know what Sherlock deduced that morning in the girl's bedroom grips John. On the return journey he thought of many valid arguments to convince Sherlock to participate in the investigation. From those calmly exposed to those imposed with a big voice and threats. John already knows that he will compose a sort of medley starting from the first and then going to ruin on the last.
<< No. I wanted your opinion >>.
<< Ugh, do you noticed it? >> asks William.
<< He has drink an entire pint of beer just to get the situation down. I can't understand how your ex-comrades did to convince him to join us in the pub >>.
<< The music code? >> curious John asks.
<< What a kind thing from you >>.
"I don't want you to be stuck with the idea that love can only kill, Sherlock," she says, moving closer to him. A gentle warmth spreads from her. Pleasant and inviting.
<< Now, however, you are here with me >> she says and in the way she shakes his hands, in the sweetness of her gaze, in the infinite tenderness that is able to arouse the child version of this woman, Sherlock realizes that she won't let him go. No. Not even when the leg will heals. Not even when the blizzard will ends and the snow melts. Mary will not allow him to leave her alone again.
The door opens and the violent light that enters the darkness in which he is trapped snatches Sherlock from its Mind Place.
<< You know about tricks to drive me crazy >> whispers John in his ear.
<< Jesus, but how dare you make me wait! >> growls, tormenting the hair with both hands. Yet he had been clear with the old-fashioned bearded old man who welcomed him at the entrance. John specified several times that he is there for reasons relating to Mr. Holmes' younger brother. Mycroft repeatedly told him how much he constantly cared about Sherlock, for that reason John thought  would get him received it immediately. Instead, he seems to be busy in a very important meeting.
Sherlock bows and a tuft of platinum blonde hair comes off the perfect hairstyle created with the gel. John can't believe that his flatmate is inside those ripped jeans in several places and that checkered shirt, open on a gray t-shirt. He dyed not only his hair with that unusual shade of blond, but also eyebrows and eyelashes, giving his already pale face an ethereal aura, broken only by the fake beard that covers his cheeks and chin. With green colored contact lenses he even changed the particular color of his eyes.
<< My mind travels fast. My body, on the other hand, is damned slow >> Sherlock explains, whispering in his ear.
<< I wanted to give you time to elaborate >> he says shrugging. John laughs nervously shaking his head.
John feels his viscera squirm and a strong sense of nausea rise up his throat. A part of himself tries to reject the understanding that is reaching him of the words of this woman.
In anger, Sheron destroys the other wall lamp and open with a kicks the door of William's bedroom. Check under the bed and a noise coming from the closet catches her attention. She smiles satisfied and leans the baseball bat on her shoulder.
<< Turn off the sauna! Excessive heat alters body conditions, don't your men know? >> says Sherlock, looking with contempt at Anderson leaning against the jamb of the sauna.
<< Yes >> he replies seriously. << I have always tried to protect you and this time I was so stupid that I didn't immediately see how delicate the situation was. I thought you went away to spite John and instead ... >>.
<< Yes >> Mycroft nods, following the signs on the second flight of stairs.
<< John >> whispers the consultant, looking him in the eyes. << I ... I thought of something >>.
<< In any case, running after Sherlock is good for you. I find you in splendid shape >> she smiles mischievously, but John has no desire to reopen closed chapters.
<< It will pass soon, you will see >> the little Mary said, looking, however, alarmed the liquid more red than straw yellow present in that object. She replaced the antibiotic bag and increased the morphine before leaving him alone in the dark.
<< Give me good news >> he replies, quickly checking the list of seven elements he has compiled.
<< It is not easy to admit one's faults, to recognize that you are the cause of the malaise of loved ones >> whispers Mycroft in a heartfelt way.
<< Definitely >> retorts Sherlock, to whom the cheeks from laughing so much hurt. << Thank you, Mary. I needed it >> he says, turning his eyes in love with the violin.
John place his chin on the puppy's soft head, that dangling from sleep.
The woman freezes again and Sherlock fears the worst this time. She wakes up much quickley than usual and jumps to her feet, making the bed jump. Mary approaches the desk and from a drawer pulls out a round mirror set in a finely worked silver handle. She sit down again over the bed, smiling.
<< The decision to get help, sometimes comes before the worst is accomplished, sometimes after having survived it >> says Mycroft in a heavy tone, appeasing the girl's incessant cry for a moment. Lizzy looks at him, in amazement, and finds no comfort in his expression, nor any emotion. She clasps herself to his father's chest, looking away from the ice man.
They remain silent. A silence full of embarrassing tension. The heart rate monitor reveals how strong Sherlock's heart beats and he would like to tear the electrodes from his chest. He can't stand feeling so naked, not in front of John and even his brother.
John sees her swell more and more with anger, that she hold with increasing strength. Margaret will explode, John is sure of it, and it will be terrible. On Greg's tense face, standing a meter away from her, in the exact same position, John reads his own fear. The doctor looks at them and wonders how two people who have loved eachother and promised eachother 'eternal love' and who have brought two children into the world, now they have come to be unable to stay in the same room without risking sparks.
<< My god, pure delusion >> John whispers.
<< There would be nothing wrong >> John says, trying to minimize the relief he is feeling.
<< Mary! Oh, baby Mary, please help me >> Sherlock sobbing, placing a hand on the door.
<< I don't know. What does he say about me? >>.
"Just do it!"
<< I met Mary >> the doctor tells him regaining his attention. << I thought that there was a logical sense if you woult like to have to help her. I went to her house yesterday and I found many notebooks like this >> he says, handing one of the documents to Sherlock. The latter sits up and leafs through the notebook.
<< Oh, stop it! >> John snorts, tugging at his hands. << Thanks to Mike, thanks to the chanse, who cares, the substance does not change, Sherlock! Allow me to fight alongside you against that madman and to be ... with you, if you want it >>.
<< I can do it like this, maybe you want to teach me a different way? >> says Sherlock tugging the shirt in his trousers. The girls blush.
<< He was here ... he was here until a moment ago >> John exclaims horrified, trying to free himself from the her grasp. The more he tries, the more, however, he falls on her, making her laugh, laugh louder and louder.
Moriarty looks at him curiously.
<< Where are you taking me? >> mumbles, feeling the man's hands squeeze him too hard.
<< Yes. I also had some photos taken at the meetings, but a few days after they threw me out they stole my phone >>.
<< The situation, my dear doctor, seems somewhat obvious to me >> Mycroft replies, rolling his eyes. << My brother has been contacted by this Paddington to handle a case. Sherlock recognized it interesting, decided to leave and during the investigation he found himself stuck up there by the storm. He will be giving a hard time to the patience of those poor people >>.
<< Are you a devotee? >> she asks him from her chair, her favorite point of observation. Sherlock just looks up to evalue the situation before replying.
<< Yes, you're right. Knowing Sherlock, things won't change. You, however, hope so. Sorry if I tell you, but this is also a low blow on your part >> he says standing up. << I saw Sherlock half killed by drugs, John. You have spared this part of him, but I have known him with arms full of holes and pupils like suckers. I wouldn't have bet a penny, yet it was enough for me to throw a proposal, 'if you stop with this stuff I will allow you to collaborate with me' and he did it. Sherlock made a serious effort and did it. Mycroft himself thanked me for saving his brother. I'm convinced that was Sherlock who saved himself, but if a really small part of success depended on me, then I'm proud of it and it pisses me deeply to think that, because of you, he can throw everything away, John! >>.
A large number of rows opened in Sherlock's head, happy at the idea of putting his hands over decaying corpses that many things have to tell those who can observe. Sherlock putted in his trolley some heavy clothing and left without too many words.
<< I will miss him, but I know he will be fine here. And you? >>.
When the song ends and the violin is silent, they both find themselves surprised and inexplicably happy. In the silence that follows, the vibrations of the last note still reverberate against the walls, making that cold and hostile environment almost hospitable. When their eyes meet, a cheerful laugh arises spontaneously from both and wraps them, bringing their tormented souls closer.
Greg visibly shaken runs his hand through the gray hair to then go down to caress his shaggy beard. He intercepts John's gaze, as if asking him for confirmation of what the consultant said, and the doctor nods.
John waits outside the bathroom. A vise holds his stomach tight. He cannot bear the idea of what has happened and continues to blame himself. He is irritated by that woman and her constant chatter and by himself for being with her all day. And for being behind Sherlock's pout, instead of acting as an adult and trying to clear up their argument.
<< Thank goodness, little one, you also have a permissive dad >> says the girl, cuddlessing the puppy, that hopes for an encore.
They leave the building and the consultant stops a cab.
He turns his gaze to the girl's now pale face, to her half-closed and veiled eyes that fix an indistinct point in front of her, without seeing anything. As far as can be seen from a first observation, there are no traces of violence. Hypostatic spots indicate that the body is there for at least ten hours, twisted on the side, the left arm lying on the ground and the right arm bent on the side. She still holds the blade in her hand.
<< I see the snow, Bryan. Keep looking, I don't want to keep them here until spring >> the detective says, pointing to Greg and John. The men cast grim looks at the two Londoners, but continue to dig. Others are added to help them harness the car and a crane is taken to be able to bring it back to the road.
John leans over to take the leaflet left on the table.
<< You too >> says John kissing those always too cold fingers. << See you soon William >> John greets the child by ruffling his hair. John quickly walks away to join Greg, followed by the adoring gaze of his consultant.
<< Apparently not >> Sherlock agrees, putting the folder back in place. << If only Ford had been kidnapped, I wouldn't accept the case. But one of my man's favorite authors was pulled in the middle of this story with her son, so ... >>.
"And I'm at both!" John silences her. The consulting detective, married to his job, has brought home a not bad prey. The idea that they have already given vent to that attraction of which he was an involuntary witness, and that they will continue throughout the night, closes John's stomach.
<< Why in the locker room? >>.
"A bad death," says Moriarty gravely. “Strange expression, don't you think? It assumes that there is a beautiful death. Absurd” he laughs, completely disrespectful of his disturbance. “We should deduce from this that your death is among those that can be said to be beautiful, since you will soon fall asleep. And you'll also feeling a pleasant warmth. The first man buried in his Mind Palace" plays Moriarty theatrically, accompanying these last words with wide gestures of the arms. “I want you to know that I will miss you. Really,” he admits, bringing his hand to his chest. “I would like to had the pleasure of killing you. Apparently, however, a woman crazy psychopath and a little stupid, managed to do it before me. Patience ”Moriarty shrugs.
<< No, It is my fault. What fault can you ever have? >> sighs, placing his hand on John's shoulder. << It's strange, don't you think? >>.
<< In the storage room, downstairs, I found scratches on the inside of the door. There, too, great and meticulous cleaning was done >> John informs him, clenching his fists.
<< Why? >> John asks dressing them. It is not very convinced.
<< I am ... relieved of this case >> he sighs, despising to seem a victim of circumstances. Greg rolls his eyes. He turns his back on the door and plantes his hands on his hips, giving Sherlock a look of reproach very similar to that dedicated to his children to quell their quarrel.
<< Isn't it obvious? >>.
<< Permissive dad? >> John asks her.
<< I want to take care of Mary's funeral. I don't want that they put her in that sort of mass grave which is the asylum cemetery >> he whispers.
<< Are you talking about voices, little brother? >>.
<< Please, stop it! >> exclaims the exhausted consultant. << Don't you realize that this is how it works? >>.
<< You are impetuous, captain >> Sherlock whispers on his lips before kissing them.
<< It's a way of saying, genius! >> growls John. The puppy yelp and runs to hide between Sherlock's legs.
<< Who is really behind the Fenix portal? >> John askd and the journalist smiles satisfied with his intuition.
<< I'm not his father, Greg! >> John reply annoyed. << Sherlock is an adult and quite free to go where he likes best, if you hadn't noticed >>.
Sherlock wipes the silent tears that line his face and places the letter on the table in front of the sofa on which he is sitting. He takes the violin and starts playing a cheerful, Irish ballad. It is the first time that John hears him play something like this and that must certainly be tied to Mary.
<< Shall we go? >> asks him, but the puppy stay still on the consultant's outstretched hand. John scratches his head, wondering how to make himself understood. He try to take the leash and shows it to the puppy. He jumps happy out of bed and trots towards him. << Good boy >> John encourages him. He reply barks cheerfully.
<< You really are not? >> Sherlock hears the question from far away and hurries to answer, fearing yet another violence at what she would perceive as a hesitation.
December 26th
Mary gently takes Sherlock's right hand, tight on the shawl, and holds it between hers, so unexpectedly warm. She nods, inviting him to open up.
He takes the crutches and slowly, putting his foot carefully on the ground, he heads for the bathroom.
<< And you saw well falling into a snowfield >> she says disgusted, shaking his head. << You come from the city, don't you? >>.
<< I would like to say yes, but the investigations are under my responsibility and the chief commissioner would kill me if I did not carry them all the way >> Greg replies. << Just give me time to fix some things >> he asks, turning his gaze to his children and Margaret, standing at a distance from each other much greater than the physical one. Mycroft agrees with a gesture of the head.
On balance, this is the most intimate moment they experienced after that fateful Saturday evening. So far, if they have been close, it has mostly been for medical reasons. John held Sherlock in his arms to help him sit up or get up before and after the leg operation. He even helped him wash when he had plaster and now he supports him and helps him to perform the rehabilitation exercises. John  encouraged Sherlock in moments when the pain in his leg led him to swear, like John never heard him. John tried to alleviate his pains with massages and giving bottom to all the remedies he knows. This hug, however, is different. It stems from the sense of injustice for that decision, for this case that had a bad conclusion.
<< Oh >> she whispers dreamily, returning to put her chin in her cupped hands. << Have you decided when? >>.
<< Do you have brothers, you? >> Mary asks.
<< Do you know this man? >>.
The ice man sighs and shakes his head resignedly.
That tube had disturbed him from the first moment he saw it come out of his penis. It must have been inserted without lubricants and forcefully. Fortunatelly Sherlock was unconscious. Unfortunatelly
John can't believe his ears. Sherlock, the lazy, bored, comfortable Sherlock is giving him lessons about something that doesn't involve investigation and murder.
<< I don't want you to do other scenes in front of my son, he has already seen too many because of you! Say another word and each of these people will be a witness in my favor >>.
<< I don't know, Edward. They were here and then they were gone. I think they went away. They were older and worked. When dad died, nobody came here to be visited. When mum died, me and my brothers were the only ones left and then ... and then I was the only one left >>.
<< Adventure
<< I will have to do it anyway, given the recent developments >> Sherlock sighs, bringing his hand to his eyes. He looks tired and visibly tried. John has never seen him like this and feels the absurd desire to comfort him. John sees Sherlock carry his hand on the wrist, that he mistreated that morning, on which a purple bracelet now stands out.
Sherlock feels himself wrapped up, dishevels his hair, enters it with each breath, pricking his nostrils and throat with those nauseating essences. The head begins to turn and he tries to stop it by bringing a hand to the temple.
<< Because you were making the mysterious adults >> retorts the child and Sherlock laughs heartily at his words.
One button after another.
<< It is not of my interest >> he interrupts him. << It wasn't when I tried to hire you as a spy inside Baker Street and it's not now. The only thing I hope is that you will have the opportunity to clarify yourself and to do it we must first find him, John >>.
<< Of course, even more >>.
Sherlock receives a message and at the same time the bell rings.
<< Why would they do it? >> John asks.
<< How can you think of the samples in such a moment? >>.
December 1th
Sherlock put his hand over his mouth and try to breathe slowly to calm down. John grabs his hand in which he holds the handkerchief and squeezes it tightly.
<< There is so much loneliness here when the snow arrives >> Mary whispers, in fact, with a small little voice. She turns her gaze to him and the cheerful smile drives away any sign of sadness. << Fortunately, you are here. You who are calm and behave so well >> adds joyful.
John's gaze flies to Sherlock, who standing next to Fox, sitting in front of Lizzy's laptop. The tense face, the attentive gaze, the hands folded behind the back in that pose of apparent and peaceful expectation.
<< No, I didn't like McNeel's attentions and it will be a pleasure for me to denounce him publicly so that he suffers an even harsher sentence for what he did to me. As for you, 'master', you don't know who I am >> Sherlock whispers. << I will dig into your past, I will find every skeleton you keeps hidden in your locker and I will destroy you! >>.
<< Shut up! >> the woman yells, taking a snap knife from the inside pocket of the leather jacket. The shiny blade appears emitting a glow. << Change of program >> she says with an hysterical laugh. << I'll take you dead to your parents. I'll open you like a calf and I'll do the same to your dog too >>.
<< If I can have my say, however, you are really cute together >> Greg says, winking. John feels his face light up like a light bulb and can't reply.
<< And if I wanted to evade the camera placed at the entrance? >>.
Sherlock stands up and puts the lens back in the case. He takes off his jacket and throws it to Lestrade who grabs it, caught off guard.
<< Thank you >> John whispers before letting him go.
<< Since the first time I saw you and Sherlock together I was taken by the doubt that you could be for my brother or a blessing or a disgrace. Until a few days ago I thought the first. Now I realize that it has always been the second >>.
<< I knew it! That idiot to calm down Ford's associates has endangered William's life! >> Sherlock snaps, hitting the wall with a punch. << There is a novel on the folder which has the same title as Margaret O’Hara's best seller >>.
Sherlock sighs, shaking his head, the he look at William.
<< Not in the last period >> says the consultant and the two shiver at his words.
<< Do you think that ... he died and that she has hidden the corpse, frightened? >>.
<< Please excuse us >> says the man, placing a hand on his wife's shoulder. The woman shivers at that touch, but lets herself be led elsewhere to avoid witnessing the passage of the coroner's men with the black sack in which their daughter lies.
<< It is too dangerous >>.
"Not even when you have the solution under your nose?" he asks him in a whisper  a palm from his face. Sherlock looks at him, confused, and Moriarty rolls his eyes, annoyed by his slowness. “Do you remember what you said to little Molly Hooper yourself? Come on! She said that these corpses had nothing in common, while you pointed out that their are all ... ".
The consultant raises an eyebrow.
Sherlock's body slowly moving against his.
<< Jesus! >> Sherlock mumbles, struggling to take the long breaths that have help  him to quell panic. Sherlock massage his face hard.
<< Even Mary's father was. And the brothers and the mother. Part of her became infected with it and developed that violent and murderous personality. I wondered if I also have something like this somewhere and I found it, you know? >> he says holding the blanket with his hand. << Moriarty has often appeared in my thoughts. He spoke to me, urged me to kill her to save me. There were moments when I thought of following his advice and if I didn't, it was only because John's voice helped me to give up >>.
<< Well. Be careful >> Sherlock recommends, stroking John's well-shaven cheek.
<< In fact I know, Mycroft. But it is lapidary with those who commit crime and I have betrayed his trust. No. It is something much worse. Or rather, I sold it to him as something worse, fool that I am. I gave him to understand that I had used him >>
<< Oh >> Greg exclaims, confused . << You decided to pretend that nothing happened, therefore >>.
<< We should stick together >>.
<< No? To me it seems to be in the presence of a Sylvan elf >> burst out.
<< Tomorrow I go to town to get everything I need. I had to go there anyway to stock up before the next storm. Do you feel like staying here just for a while? >> she asks him, suddenly becoming worried. In fact Sherlock made a scene just before perceiving himself only in silence.
<< What should I think then, John? That your distinguished colleague is right and that my brother has joined forces with the woman that tortured him? Honestly, I prefer him prey of hallucinations >>.
<< Your hands would never hurt me >> he whispers sleepily and a sweet smile as a child is drawn on his lips.
Lestrade looks at him for a long time. His eyes reduced to two slits, as if he wanted to focus better on the desperate man who took the place of his friend.
<< No, Sherlock, it's not for me >> Greg snorts as always annoyed.
<< Do you think Morgan can help you? >> John asks him.
surrounded by his  black curls. John sighs, lost in contemplation of his beautiful flatmate. The puppy wakes him up from his (not entirely innocent) dreams with his eyes open, nibbling his fingers.
<< Do you still have so much pain there? >> Mary asks him, visibly embarrassed. The mere question makes Sherlock's skin crawl as he risks getting his mouthful sideways.
<< It doesn't matter >> she whispers, shrugging. << The important thing is that Edward is alive. That he can marry Molly and have many beautiful children. It's a happy ending. They move me so much >>.
<< Very gladly, madam >> Sherlock replies satisfied. << I think you are doing the right thing, Ms O'Hara >> adds, tearing from the woman a sob which is not followed, however, other tears.
<< Exactly >> John nods seriously. << Now that we have restored the responsibilities, let's take that asshole >>
<< Not even for me, John. That's all. You are everything to me, John >> Sherlock admits shaking John’s hand.
Someone coughs behind him. John turns and finds Mycroft standing by his side, a cup of tea in his hands.
<< At 10 in the morning! I think I should be satisfied with how my tax money is spent if the government starts its important job so early >> John turns around, ready to walk the room in the opposite direction. The door opens leaving in mid-air.
Sherlock takes note of what John exposed and go into the small dirty, unhealthy and messy room. The pitched roof does not even allow him to stand straight, which must not be a problem for the short woman. The walls are full of books, among which those of Margaret O'Hara stand out. The only orderly and well-kept place is the desk located under the window. Sherlock sits down at the chair and enters the password by guessing it on the first attempt.
<< Do you have nightmares if you sleep? >> he asks and a spasm shakes him from head to toe, now that the tension is leaving him and the body cools down. Mary takes off the shawl she has wrapped around her shoulders and gently lays it around Sherlock's shoulders. Sherlock feels immense well-being in the warmth of that warm hug.
<< Damn bastards! Take advantage of the kids >> growls Greg.
<< Red Beard? Is it the name of a pirate? >>.
<< Ok. OK, stop. It's very much for me! I just want to go to sleep for at least two days! This means that you will have to take care of him alone! >>.
<< Oh my God, what have you done, Eddy? >> exclaims Mary-child, wrinkling her nose in front of the smell that hit her in the face.
<< I have the pleasure to introduce you to Scott Sigerson
<< But ... why? >>.
<< It's ... it's the same for me, Sherlock >> confesses John in one breath. << I realize that it may not be worth anything, not after what I said. Sounds like an attempt to save myself in extremis, but it's not like that. Look at me, Sherlock >> John says, opening his arms before dropping them at his sides. << I am this. Lame, bruised, fat and idiot. You, on the other hand >>, sigh, << you are brilliant, beautiful and athletic. Saturday night it was as if I had taken something that is not for me. Something I don't deserve. I saw you so happy and I was afraid of being able to send everything to hell, because I have never had an important relationship and, wow, you are important. Then I destroyed everything right away. Maybe it is easier for me to make myself despised, as it is for you to accept teasing and criticism rather than compliments >>.
The worst part is that John cannot stop this indecent flow of forbidden thoughts now that he perceives him as available and potentially interested.
<< Er, maybe it's better to continue our conversation in my office >> suggests the manager.
<< Oh >> Sherlock exclaims, blinking several times.
Sherlock's phone rings and interrupts the fight. The annoyed consultant takes it from his pocket and answers acidly.John watches Sherlock speak without listening to what he is saying. He doesn't understand what got into him. He saw that unexpected thalamus and all the months of double meaning, allusions and jokes rained down on his head.
<< So why did you tell me those things? >>.
<< I have already communicated our names to the hotel manager. You will be my agent: Charlie Rogers >>.
<< I help him in the investigation, Annette >> John replies, punctuating her name with a little too much acidity.
<< Can I? Really? >>.
"Sherlock, what's going on with you?" John asks, with more than a note of concern in his voice. The consultant does not answer him. Sherlock's had a lot of dreams these days. The side effects of taking morphine for too long a period have started to make themselves felt with this perennial drowsiness.
In the air, the smell of burnt wood and lavender mixes with that of chicken broth and the bitter one of disinfectant. There is something in this house that makes John shiver. The furniture is old, but well kept and the acid green wallpaper is a very questionable furniture choice. It is not that, however, that worries him. It is far too tidy and clean. Aseptic, one might say. Just like a hospital.
<< Let me say, John, that you are a bad knight >> he says seriously, shaking his head.
<< Okay >> John accepts defeated and the twinge in the stomach becomes even stronger.
<< Thank you, Inspector >> John says, holding out his hand. The man squeezes it in passing and then goes to the car.
<< There's everything in here, John. Pedophiles, exploiters, blackmailers, drug dealers. They lure these kids by promising them a happier life under the sign of the phoenix >>.
he thinks, chatting amiably with Clarissa, that he doesn't like it too much, but right now his company is more than welcome.
<< Is it a phoenix? >> John question, peeking at the drawing.
<< I agree with your choice >>.
<< Gregory Lestrade is in danger, Dr. Watson >> reveals Fox, receiving a glare from the Holmes brothers. << He was in danger and he still is in danger >>. John straightens his back and a shiver of awareness runs through him.
<< Did he manage to speak to her? >>.
<< No. Silver was not old. He was only eight years old and, even if he was a Molossian, he could lived for another 4 years. Someone must given to Silver something that hurt him. Dad didn't listen to me and so I tried to investigate, like you, to bring him the evidence. The night before it rained and I found footprints around the kennel >> William says frowning thin. << I took pictures of those footprints, do you want to see them? >>.
<< Thank you >> the boy says, sketching a smile. << It doesn't concern me directly. It's for my sister >>.
<< No, it is not a bad thing. It has its advantages, otherwise I would not have honed my skills by making it a method of investigation. Seeing everything, especially what people don't want to see, however, can be annoying. People tend to move away from the truth >> admits the consultant.
<< How come you're not there, then? >> asks him and Sherlock looks away.
<< If there is nothing between you and your flatmate, you will not have anything against it if I try to become more 'intimate' with him >> the ex soldier had told John a few minutes after meeting Sherlock. John stomach tightened at the idea that someone, especially someone like Bryan, might have the intention of flirting with his flatmate. Yet he did not object, by citing his interest in the consultant.
<< We can say goodbye to the privacy >> John says and Sherlock nods.
<< Out there is a storm going on. A storm, gentlemen, not a delicate and romantic Christmas snowfall >> he underlines, twisting his nose. << You have already been crazy to get here to ask me what I had already told you by phone ... >>.
<< I want you to do an x-ray as soon as possible. I don't like these wounds at all, we should go to the hospital, Sherlock >>.
<< Why? >> asks Sherlock and John notes that in fact it is the first time they find themselves listening to a minor. He even fears that they are already doing something contrary to the law, since the boy is there without parental consent.
<< It is not nice to hear >> he shakes the head. Sherlock does wont to reliving everything.
The roar of the storm returns to fill the silence. The cries of the wind that emerges from the hinges to crawl the skin.
<< For six months you have been bringing here always different women and I am not doing the scenes you are doing >> Sherlock replies, sternly.
John feels his stomach ache pierced by new stilettos. He know well Greg's disbelief. One cannot but remain incredulous and dismayed at such manifestations of despair.
<< Are you sure you are well? >>.
<< Is that why you and Sherlock discussed after? He was definitely drunk. It must not have been a nice return home >>.
In these five days, however, Sherlock has not contact him and John has hesitated several times on take the initiative and write to him. He also jotted down many texts, which were saved in drafts for a few hours before he decided to delete them entirely.
"If those desperate people can have you ... why can't I have you too?" he thinks, staring too insistently, he realizes it, those beautiful lips that from the first moment hit his attention.
<< Now much better, thanks >> John replies.
<< Why ..? >>.
<< I have to go to the second victim >> cut Sherlock short, by typing yet another message. He puts the cell phone back in his pocket, puts on his jacket and John sees a red and bruised bracelet showing off around his wrist. John shakes his head, passing his hand to wrinkle his face.
<< Mr. Holmes can receive you, Dr. Watson! >> pompously announces the valet and John does not have it repeated twice. With quick and nervous steps, John leaves the room, badly moving the valet away and rushes to attack the knob of the door of Mycroft's office.
<< It is too hot! >> gasps he, by bringing his hand to his mouth..
"You have to react, Sherlock! You have been here for a long time now. Stop the morphine and react! ".
<< So bad? >> she asked him and, relieved, Sherlock realized that the little girl was now in front of him. He had nodded, unable to say anything and had happily accepted the ice and clean towel she had given him. For the first time he had been forced to use the 'parrot' and the burning during urination had been such as to tear cry.
<< Madrilenians have somewhat curious but very effective methods >> Sherlock replies, laughing at his amazement. << That afternoon we probed the girl's social life and drawings. Subsequently, it was enough for me that Fox provided me with little data among those recovered to understand that Rosaline Jackson had had to do with the Fenix. Fox asked me to collaborate, but he asked me also to keep the secret about their involvement in the investigation and I gave him my word. Until the situation has degenerated >>.
<< I can't >> she replies. Mary is crying in silence. Sherlock can imagine her red and swollen eyes. << Why did you lie to me, Edward? >>.
Mycroft calls him from the floor above. John takes a moment to recover from what he has discovered and order his legs to reach Mycroft. He finds him on the threshold of one of the rooms on the floor.
<< What does this third phase consist of >>.
The door slams and heavy steps, fast and that do not promise anything good attack the steps. Sherlock puts the violin in the case, closes it and slides it to the ground.
<< Now you are decent! >> laughs, by placing the mirror one palm from his face. Sherlock sees that man with tired and terrified eyes with the only difference that he is now without a week's beard coat.
<< What can be the measures you will take? >> Sherlock whispers, his gaze fixed on the door.
<< It is what we do, Mr. Holmes >> retorts the quiet man.
Greg and John exchange a glance and, resigned, follow him keeping up.
<< I know. When the line is unreachable the repeater blocks the call to the nearest cell and on the report there is no >>. Mycroft caresses his perfectly shaved chin and seems to evaluate the situation. << What are the weather conditions in the area? >> question to his secretary.
Sherlock's stomach twitches to the point of making him double in pain. He finds himself on the ground, on all fours, near the cocoon in which his body is hidden. He no longer sees him tremble.
<< You are my agent, it is up to me to give an opinion about it >>.
He picks up the phone and just says 'Come here' and has not yet put down the phone that immediately the door opens and Anthea enters, accompanied by her Blackberry. She gives John just a glance, by dedicating his attention to his boss.
<< Other hospital souvenirs >> he mumbles and his stomach starts to twist. He looks around in search of his coat, his clothes, the trolley he had with him in the rental car on which he traveled, but finds nothing. There is not even a closet in which all its stuff may have been putted.
<< It is not obvious to me >>.
<< Do you really think so? >> asks the child.
<< I didn't see him in the face. I could not keep my eyes open, my head was so dizzy. I only remember his hand on my wrist. The left one. He has a stain right here, on the wrist >>.
Sherlock tries to focus on the face of his attacker, but he just can't. His eyes burned from the contact lenses and then he couldn't keep them open from dizziness and nausea. The attacker voice would recognize it among a thousand, as well as his smell, but Sherlock doesn't remember anything about his face. Sherlock could ask to interrogate all the staff members present at the Aufguss just to hear them speak, but he would reveal his identity. In order not to do this, he should put Lestrade in the middle, have them summoned to Scotland Yard, put them behind the one-way glass. But in that way what happened to him would irreparably discover.
Sherlock replies with a snort and has no intention of following his advice.With another key, the manager opens the imposing door of his office and leads them inside. The white walls are laden with bookcases with few books. A large painting (behind which a safe surely hides) towers behind the desk in precious wood. The director sits down in his chair and invites them to do the same.
<< Just the hallucinations of a junkie, John >>.
<< It is the minimum to be capable to eat, isn't it? >> she blurts out, still bending over him. She has bad breath, an indication of bad digestion and poor oral hygiene. The smell hits Sherlock's face and he must make an effort to push back the vomit. The woman places the tray abruptly under Sherlock's nose.
John enters the bathroom and closes the door behind him.Sherlock remains for a moment staring at the opaque glass wondering what the hell a Sylvan elf is. He then shrugs and retrieves one of his suits from his closet. He sits on the bed and, armed with needle and thread, prepares to modify it for John.
<< Congratulations daddy. I would like to offer you a cigarette but you don't smoke and I stopped >>.
Moriarty's voice surprises him.
<< I sneak from the magical moment that we are going to live to go to the locker room >>.
"Just because I have a broken leg, a nice head injury, there is a storm outside and I am naked like a worm" Sherlock thinks as he does his duty. He observes the hemorrhagic color of his urine and for a moment the crazy idea of pouring them on Mary assails him.
"Maybe I still have hope" Sherlock thinks, looking at that statue of flesh. "Maybe child-Mary will take over and take me to Hataway, as I proposed," he hopes with all his might.
<< No! >> Sherlock exclaims, trying to grab the cocoon, but his hands cross him without touching him. << Oh god no, this no! >> shouts, bringing his hands to his head. << I don't want to die >> he shouts getting up. << I don't want to die! >> repeats, looking around the desperate search for someone. In the darkness of this moonless night, however, there are only him and the cocoon.
<< Until you had to talk us about their involment on the investigation and also bring your brother on the case >>.
<< I ... I don't know which rule I may have violated. I do not understand. I was so happy that they had invited me to a private seminar >> whispers, wiping new tears. << Daisy Cooper, however, when she saw me there she didn't take it well. She asked me what I was doing and then I saw that she was talking about me to one of the Masters >>.
<< I do not believe that you never made a shot >> insists. John takes the cigarette with uncertain fingers and takes a long mouthful of it, spitting out the smoke with a cough. It makes him disgusted and annoyed by his smile.
<< I want to beat another track on the web to try to get around the system and enter that damned blog >> he says, rolling his eyes. John chuckles and stands up.
<< Details that your father can handle >> John intrudes, to whom the sudden way in which Greg's face has lost all color has not escaped. John's stomach sends back a strong stab and must suppress a groan. Sherlock gives him a worried look.
"Oh, please, not here in front of everyone!" James exclaims, looking around pretending embarrassment. He pulls him away badly and Sherlock falls down to sit. His leg, which is slowly waking up, sends him a stab of pain so strong that it makes him scream. "Oh come on, how much scene for a little pain."
<< So what can we do? >> Sherlock asks regretfully and a cramp claws his stomach. He vomit in the toilet just in time. He still spit that foamy, smelly substance.
<< Isn't it really possible to get in touch with the Sky Club? >> asks the colleague, who looks up to the sky, exasperated.
<< What's reaction? >> John asks. The two women exchange a glance, making each other courageous and turn to look at the child that eat his breakfast by sharing it with the puppy.
<< Obvious, isn't it? >>.
he thinks, struggling to his feet.
John puts on his man's dressing gown, just to avoid getting Mrs Hudson to take an heart attack, if she decides to swoop into their private space, and reaches his cell phone abandoned on his armchair. He take his sister's number from the diary and call her.
Mary smiles. Despite the brutality of what she just told him, she smiles. As if what her father was doing was stupid and foolish.
"Why not?" Sherlock wonders now. "Why couldn't it be so?" People always said that he is crazy, after all. For his way of seeing the world, for the tones he uses in addressing people and for many other countless things.
<< Precisely >> Mycroft nods seriously, taking another drag on the cigarette.
<< No? And who am I? >> asks him, feeling his erection press against the boxers.
<< It is not my intention, John >>.
<< Too fast >> Mr Holmes repeats seriously. << So is this what I should explain to those who should ask me the reason about my son's behavior? I should tell them he's not a drug addict, but that he only uses cocaine to stop his mind too fast? >> Mr Holmes thunders, clapping his hands on the desk. The impact creates a gloomy sound, which Sherlock still hears now ringing in his chest.
<< Why is it so warm in here? >> growls the consultant, unbuttoning the first three buttons of the purple shirt.
<< You despair as if him were died. I repeat that it wasn't you >>.
“The worms will come for you too. They'll be here soon, ” Sherlock thinks, and another high-pitched scream touches his skin. The child. His steps run to the kitchen. Sherlock hurries to follow them.
<< Oh, Jesus! >> John whispers, becoming pale.
<< I don't have a problem, John. I don't eat during a criminal investigation because digestion slows me down >>.
<< Could you recognize these people? >> Greg asks, lightly caressing her hair
Anthea enters the office, announcing herself with two shots on the door. She hands a packet of papers to his boss. Then remains still half a meter from the desk, her hands folded behind her back, in a resting position.
<< Paddington said Sherlock had a suitcase with him. The trolley that he usually uses when traveling on business. This suitcase is nowhere >>.
<< Me too, and I thank John Watson for giving me proof >> Sherlock replies, resolutely. Cold. Yes, he feels he is freezing. He just feel disgust. Not even anger. No, anger is hot, it ignites, it inflames. Disgust creates frost, like the cold sweats that follow the retching. The same disgust Sherlock had felt for himself in still hearing John's smell on his skin, in knowing he had John's body fluids inside him and that takes days before he leaves.
<< Oh yes! >> Mary replies, as he expected << They are good to me. They could have killed me, they always said it, and instead they never did it >> laughs cheerfully. << You, on the other hand, don't love your dad, do you? >>.
John blinks several times in amazement at Sherlock's incredulous expression. He laughs then, amused, shaking his head.
<< Because I lied to her >> retorts Sherlock. << I was wrong to lie to her. I should have told her immediately who I am >>.
John sighs. He has Sherlock's hand clasped in his again, John hopes again that  Sherlock will wake up early. Yes, because he wants to be able to talk to him, try to contain him, if necessary, and ask him to explain the reason for his words.
<< I'm fine, and you? You took a good hit >> Sherlock replies trying to free him of his weight. However, he loads too much on his leg and with a moan falls over John again.
John takes a deep breath realizing that he has been in apnea for the whole long Mycroft's monologue. He returned to that cold winter evening in which he saved his first life: the life of his sister. John was the same age as George and, like him, he was scared to death. Despite the terror, however, he had used the first aid lessons learned in school and had induced her sister to vomit the countless pills that she had take with an exaggerated amount of alcohol. Harriet, just 18, was exhausted by the accusations of her mother, by the people's gossips, by the bullying she suffered in school. She, so apparently strong, had collapsed revealing the fragile soul that still characterizes her today. That soul that made it difficult for her to separate from the bottle for so long. Maybe only now, finally, the strength of the past has returned to her allowing her to get back on her feet. Now that their parents are no hurt her. Now that there are no more classmates that accuse her of being indecent and monstrous. Now that, perhaps, the world is starting to be more open to all forms of love.
<< Well, tell them not to touch anything. I will get to work just finished this little experiment >>.
<< I am not upset >> the consultant replies acid.
Sherlock and John watch him go and when the door closes behind Mycroft they find themselves in a silence full of tension.
<< Yes, I know him >> confirms Sherlock and the girl seems to reassure herself.
<< I didn't know you were able to think, Anderson? >> Sherlock replies, moving undisturbed towards the study of William's mother, located at the back of the living room. Morgan follows him, trotting with the same carelessness.
<< If it's a problem that people think we're together? No, John, it's not. I don't give a damn what people think. I thought you understood it >>.
<< You saved me, I would say it was the least I could do for you >> Sherlock replies with a smile.
<< Also to mine >> John agrees, glancing at his man. << Do we want to go on? >> he adds, inviting the consultant and the child to carry out the investigations. William nods, intimidated by John's seriousness. He takes Sherlock's hand and drags him into the hall. John and Morgan follow them.
<< Sherlock told me about the Fenix portal and I know you got involved. What's going on, babe >> whispers Greg just moving her hair away from her face. The girl turns her big big eyes on him and bites her dark lips. The brother nods, encouraging her.
<< This ... thing >> Sherlock says, sighing. << It is not feasible, John >>.
<< Did you hear what your colleagues said? >> retorts John, trying to stay calm.
<< No, Mycroft. Mary would have brought him to Hataway as soon as possible >> John intrudes. << Her family killed people who were alone. If Sherlock had told her that he had been sent there for an investigation, she would not even have tried to rob and kill him, as his family used to do. Finding herself teased has infuriated her >>.
<< How long did I sleep? >> he asks him, feeling his mouth kneaded and his voice so different.
<< You smoked >> John notes severe.
<< A further confirmation of my thesis on who is the real target of this kidnapping >> nods Sherlock, satisfied.
<< There is no one here! >> instead shouts one of the rescuers. John quickly pulls away from Greg. He dry his face, by leaning over the edge of the ravine.
<< I'll get you something to eat >>.
<< The sauna master, however, does not convince me >> said Lestrade, who, although he is part of the idiots, must recognize a particular intuition for him.
<< Do you mean that someone was keeping an eye on her from before? >> John asks him and Sherlcok slowly nods.
Sherlock's back arches. His legs tighten around John's hips. His hands clap on John's shoulders. His nails harpoon John's back and his voice begs him to stop. John does only when Sherlock's hands  grab his wrists. They both look panting. Their faces are red with laughter and the fake fight that just happened.
<< Well, Greg. He is right >> says John.
<< Margaret I demand that you ... >>.
<< Why on earth? Do you think it would really make a difference? If she decides to open the door, this is where she will take me. She has already decided it. She is just waiting for the storm to end >>.
Sherlock would like to look away but he can't. He stands there, watching himself inciting John and getting more and more relentlessly close to the moment he has lost all control.
<< What does your mother have to do with it? >>.
<< I just wanted  to stop them >> she whispers, becoming small small. << I took care of those who then let go. Dad didn't want me to get close to the others. He said that I'm so stupid that I could get them into trouble. When dad fell down the stairs and died I thought it would all be over. That we would not have all those people anymore at home and would not even throw the lonely ones away in the pit anymore. Instead, Freddie found another one and mom told him they could do it. He was a very kind old man. I wanted to take him secretly to Mr Inspector, but when Oliver discovered me they hit me a lot, all four, and mom was there to watch. Then they closed me in the storage room and I thought that also I was going to die in  there. I was always afraid that they would lead me to that pit too >>.
<< They found out that she is the daughter of a Scotland Yard's inspector >> Sherlock replies with that irritating tone of obvious.
<< It is morphine. It's starting to open the secret drawers of my Mind Palace >> he whispers, between sobs.
"If they too, like that man, hadn't had a place to stay, wouldn't you have brought them here?"
When it does a profession that empowers to take care and 'fix' these human machines, everything becomes more difficult. This professionist feels compelled to heal them, to save them. The impotence is even stronger because this professionist have a greater knowledge of what is happening to them. This knowledge on the one hand helps to take care, on the other it is a boulder on the chest for the one who cares of the others.
<< John, don't ... >>.
<< Do we want to go? >> Mycroft asks the three men with the same tone of false courtesy. They follow him on the road, where the dark car is waiting for them. Anthea waits for them diligently at the car door and John finds himself, despite himself, sitting between the consultant and the journalist. The short journey proceeds in a silence made of gazes and silent conversations that completely cut off John, who feels uncomfortable and out of place.
Sherlock is struck by this last sentence. A different perspective which he had not yet taken into consideration opens up before him. He now understands what his mother meant by those simple words. "Love saves", she said, and now Sherlock seems to understand that the first thing from that save is by themselves. From the distorted idea that you have of yourself. From the beginning, John has shown enthusiasm in front of Sherlock's deductions, giving him the opportunity to appreciate them himself in a genuine and not ostentatious way in defense of the negative judgment of others. Now the doctor has told him how unattractive and idiotic he think to be, which is light years away from what he really is. Sherlock knows about John self-esteem problems, but that they were so marked he hadn't understood.
<< So, doctor, do you think that we will ever have the pleasure of seeing safely again that fool I have for brother? >>.
A dark mark on the face, near the mouth.
<< Your brother is missing and you are wasting time making me an interrogation? >> John screams, pointing the finger at him. << Why don't you call someone of yours and ask him to check the phone records, so that it can find out if Sherlock has received phone calls or text messages or anything else that can help us understand where he is? Do I have to remind you that a madman who claims to be a consulting criminal has decided to elect himself as Sherlock's huge fan? >>.
He will spend the night monitoring him and at the first doubt he will call an ambulance and do all the stories he wants.
<< What's wrong? >>.
<< It's convenient for you that I have a caregiver>> Sherlock says, moving away from his hand.
>> Sherlock mumbles, rubbing his eyes. The puppy falls silent and sits down. John looks at him in amazement.
<< Do you want to tell me about it? >>
<< In a way too. The third phase is the worst and it comes after a very careful selection. Prepared by the promises filled in the second phase, the young are eager to be invited to private seminars, led by people of dubious professionalism who call themselves Masters. They come to quarrel with each other by committing real acts of cyberbullying. The tutors and the Masters instigate cyber bullying, leading the young to real media fights with devaluation and public humor to the detriment of those who want to leave the group or who have spoken to dangerous people for the safety of the portal or who do not satisfy to Master's requests. It is a sort of natural selection. Those who survive pass to the third phase, those who do not hold commit suicide. Suicide is encouraged not only by peers vying to enter the coveted third phase, but also by those who manage the portal >>.
<< Take him away >> Greg orders two of his men who approach the master. << What happened, Sherlock, what did that bastard do to you? >> Greg asks approaching him.
<< Can I ask you to accompany us home, please >> Margaret asks, serious and courteous. Faced with her wife's constant ignoring, Mr Ford moves towards her. Morgan sprints forward and starts barking against him. John and Sherlock let him do it.
<< We will talk about what happened face to face. It is a delicate situation >> John had said every time he canceled the texts, tormenting himself, at the same time, with Sherlock's stubborn mutism.
<< Yes, he really tried to kill you >> Mary says, with a logic of her own, very child. Sherlock had a violent father and an absent mother, but, although his childhood was not happy, he is light years away from the one made of continuous violence that Mary is telling him. A story that is not the result of her imagination. Sherlock feels it corresponds to the reality that this woman found herself living in the desolation of this place, lost and isolated from the world.
<< Damn asshole! >> exclaims. << And damn storm >> he adds, turned to the window with snow-caked glass.
Strangely, the music stops when John reaches the landing floor. Sherlock is used to guess who is coming to visit from the sound of footsteps and when he plays the violin he continues tirelessly without even saying 'Hello'. Indeed, without even realizing that John has returned, to be honest.
<< They were brought here in different periods >> says Molly, leaning in turn from the edge of the hole. << The stages of decomposition are different >>.
John enters the bathroom and urinates. There is a towels laying on the radiator. Could be used by Sherlock to dry the puppy after washing. An unusual move for the consultant, which leaves everything lying around.
John's stomach closes. For Greg's words. For the accusation that he do to him. For the guilt he further touch with those words. Words that give way to Sherlock's, whispering in John's ear, blow on his skin, scream in the highest moment of pleasure.
<< That's what we're doing, Gawin >> replies Sherlock annoyed by the lightness of the detective.
John looks at the board on which he pinned all the information he managed to obtain in these four days of research.
<< I do not hide you, gentlemen, that the conditions of Mr. Holmes are not the best >> the colleague who has Sherlock under treatment told them. << We found morphine residues in the blood and from the coloration of the sclera of the eye and nails it seems that it has been given too much and for too long. Also for this reason the heart rate has still slowed down, despite the body's homeostasis being brought back to normal. This difficulty in waking up is yet another confirmation and that is what worries me most of all. Then, another element not to be underestimated, is the right leg. A fairly simple fracture, in truth, which, however, has been treated very badly. The bone was welded in the worst way, given the incorrect traction to which it was subjected. There are several broken ligaments and muscle tone has significantly decreased. Mr Holmes should be operated to avoid a permanent limp which would compromise the quality of his life. From what you writes on your blog, Dr. Watson, Mr Holmes is athletic, agile, used to running and fighting if necessary. With a leg reduced in that way, he won't be able to do any of this anymore and, unfortunately, until he wakes up and his heart will beat again properly, I can't do anything for him >>.
"You can stand it, Sherlock," John tells him. "I'm sure you can do it."
Without deigning John a glance Sherlock closes himself in the bathroom, leaving the doctor there with his paranoia and that answer so difficult to find. John cannot live peacefully despite people's judgments. It is a limit for him, perhaps, but it is a situation to which he must find a solution and, as soon as possible, too.Sherlock comes out of the bathroom wearing a bathrobe tied at the waist.
<< Do you mind if I analyze another sample by myself? >> he asks, receiving an even more surprised look.
<< Did you drink? >>.
<< Martin McNeel. One of your assistants who sexually takes abuse of the men who doesn't feel well during your  Aufguss's sessions >>.
<< A very, very dangerous individual that you and Sherlock had the opportunity to meet a short time ago >> replies the man, articulating the words well.
<< Hey, what's going on? >> he asks, moving close to Sherlock. John looks at the heart rate monitor and takes Sherlock's pulse.
<< No, that's not it! I'm not so stupid >>.
<< Exceptional >> Sherlock whispers and his lips curve to draw a smile. John rolls his eyes. Since when does Sherlock Holmes get distracted by a song player on the street when he is engaged in a case?
<< I take a look in the rooms on this floor, Captain >> informs Hataway, tha became more compliant to John's requests, since the coroner told them that among the 40 corpses found in the pit there were also those of the four brothers and the woman's mother. The last corps that Mary threw in the pit was that of her mother just over a year ago. Since then it seems that no others have been brought there.
Amazing Fox, capable of grasping in his voice the melancholy note he tried to disguise.
<< Mater misericordiae >> whispers, by opening the folder. John approaches him and together they start reading the story.
<< Aufguss >> doubtful pronunciation, reading what it is.
<< Quick, get out of there >> Mary intimates him, by tearing him from the warm embrace of the water. She throws a rough towel on him and with that Sherlock dabs the body until it is dry. Mary looks at him in passing, embarrassed. She stay at the door jamb, giving him her back.
<< I wouldn't be the first to go around the hotel naked, John. In fact, since you wanted to be here so much, it will be up to you to ‘show off some meat’ >> teases Sherlock to him, wearing, however, the shirt. << I don't understand why you wanted to accept that suite >>.
The man grabs a large knife. He steps a few steps towards the child's body and raises his arm over the child's head, ready to hit him.
<< How not! >> George blurts, crossing his arms over his chest.
<< Why didn't you tell us before? >> Greg asks impatiently.
<< Good morning to you >> the consultant welcomes him. << How can we help you? >>.
<< Really? >>.
The door of 221 B closes behind them. In the silence, amplified by the absence of Mrs. Hudson, visiting her sister, Sherlock and John go up the 17 steps, next to each other. In those three months, the patter of Morgan's paws had accompanied every ascent and descent. He had jumped on them when they came back home, alone or together. It is strange not to have him among them, ready to crouch at his kennel at the foot of the bed and, then, jump at their feet as soon as they felt asleep.
<< Why? >>.
At their feet, Morgan pawings to be able to run to his new friend sharing his happiness.
The corners of the woman's mouth curving slightly upwards.
<< I can imagine why you worried >> John continue. << Your father has tried a lot in the last period, but he is always Gregory Lestrade, the cornerstone of Scotland Yard. He deserves to know how his children are and you deserve to be able to tell him what is beautiful and also what is less beautiful you find yourself living >>.
“The person falled against it. The person was running, looking over the shoulder, and stumbled against the cushions "
<< This is not the point >> Sherlock answers << In fact, it is quite elementary. Just look around >> he says with a blatant gesture. << Few books, no personal effects on the desk, the considerable amount of time he took to find the key to this room. Everything tells us that he recently became director and that not all members agreed. This unfortunate incident, as he called it, could end his short career. That's why he's in such a hurry >>.
<< Pirate >> points out the proud child. Morgan says his own, barking.
turns his back on the detective.
<< What do you think I did in the last two days? >> Sherlock says, yawning.
<< We end the session, come on, and then I promise that I won't break you anymore >>.
<< Have you been together for a long time? >>.
<< I thought you were my friend >> whispers the little girl, crying.
<< Hey, are you listening to me? >>.
They struggled to make Morgan to understand that he had to stay in his kennel when they were 'particularly busy' in bed. That he should not jump on them or bark happy at the idea of a new game. Morgan had not yet mastered those types of orders well and the calm with which everything is now taking place, creates an atmosphere for a renewed first time, which makes them euphoric and passionate.
<< I was playing with my Lego Pirates and I heard the bell ring many times. I thought it was the cook, she always forgets something and always comes back to get it. I heard talk, but I didn't listen. Then the voices got louder, especially dad's. I think a firecracker went off. It scared me. I ran to the door, but then I heard mum scream the magic word and I hid in the closet. I saw that no one was coming but I was afraid to go out. Then I fell asleep and woke up when Morgan barked >> the puppy, called into question, makes his voice heard.
<< Yes, it's true, I lied and I wish I hadn't. I wish I had never accepted this damned case >>.
<< So is this how it works? If I lie, it is not good and if you do it, is it lawful? >>.
<< Oh, I think knowing that you told someone that you are engaged and about to get married with her would make her really happy, yes >>.
<< I'm here for work >>.
<< I don't like this plan at all! Don't you realize that in this way you put yourself in danger? >>.
<< Not directly >> he replies, leaving Sherlock speechless. << In the sauna there is a service door that leads to the massage room. To get to the changing rooms you should go from there, exit the corridor and then access the changing rooms >>.
<< It's not Greg >> he says and Sherlock nods.
<< I was called to deal with Rosaline Jackson's suicide case and the investigation led me to Felix and I found out what this really is >> Sherlock replies that tells the girl the background mentioned by her brother. Lizzy looks at him with the same astonished expression of her father and at regular intervals she shakes her head in disbelief at the things she is hearing.
<< You're right >> Greg replies, giving him a pat on the shoulder. << See you >> Greg says to John winking, before following the major of the Holmes out of his study.
<< Witness? What do you need witnesses for? >>.
Greg sighs at his side and tries several times to say something, but stopping before pronouncing a verb.
<< I tried, but I can't >> she admits in tears.
<< Sure. Was there another attack? >>.
<< Do I have to expect to see you stay away for another year? >> asks Mycroft.
<< Oh, it saved us the trouble of sending you to call >> Sherlock tells him. The master stiffens, worried. Watch Martin on the floor which, with the help of two agents, is now trying to get back on its feet.
Other footprints, the little ones of the child, start from there heading towards the stairs.
<< The crime investigation? Until recently you said that there wasn't even crime investigation >>.
<< Why? That bastard hits his son too? >> John blurts out angry.
For the umpteenth time in a few moments John turns his gaze to the watch on his wrist. He's been there making a groove on the carpet for a hour now.
The director moistens his lips and, in an unequivocal gesture of anxiety, passes the handkerchief to wipe his broad forehead.
"No! I would not have brought them for the simple fact that I would not have liked to see them running away horrified by the corpses in the fridge, by the experiments he carries out on organs and cells of human or animal origin or in front of his offensive deductions! " John retorts acid.
John is therefore preparing. Because those men could extract from the car a corps that does not resemble Sherlock at all. Only when John would have found the corps in front of him would he have been able to say otherwise. A shiver runs through him and the doctor tucks his scarf and hat in an attempt to overcome the freezing cold of these mountains. Greg, standing behind him, observes the recovery operations. The license plate of the vehicle has blown because of the impact and for the moment the only correspondence is the car's model rented by Sherlock.
<< I was ready to blow up with you in that pool to eliminate it. You should deduce the answer from you, my dear investigative consultant >> John answers, placing another kiss on those beautiful lips, which kidnap Sherlock for another intense moment of dizziness.
<< I wanted to be sure that you are well, it's not a waste of time >> retorts John. He points to the trays with dinner. << Eat >> orders him.
In fact, John has never seen Sherlock go beyond the glass of wine during one of the rare meals he allows himself, without ever finishing it completely. Or the half finger of some alcoholic drink, very rarely. Only on the Saturday night of the previous week did John see him swallowing a whole pint of beer, along with the two grappas he was so invited to try. Yes, Sherlock was definitely drunk, not just as tipsy as he could says. He had drunk considerably more.
<< I think so and I expect you to agree >>.
"The mind has a big power over the body," continues John. “I know they are concepts very far from you, but try to concentrate and imagine that the wound closes. Imagine one platelet at a time coming together and the inflammation will disappear. I know you can do it, Sherlock” John encourages him. Sherlock realizes how valuable John's advice is. Despite the annoyance he feel towards him, Sherlock puts his joined hands under his chin and diligently follows the advice of his doctor.
crying and weeping
<< Why do not I bend to the games of a madman, Sherlock >> John growls, clutching Sherlock's wrists even more. << He wants this, don't you realize it? He wants to divide us >>.
<< No, Sherlock, wait, let's talk >>.
"Yes, I have to admit that in this case you were an innocent victim," says the criminal, patting him on the shoulder. “You have been caught in the middle of a bigger situation than you. What do you say, he was a handsome man? " he asks, touching the lifeless body with the tip of his fine leather shoes.
Sherlock shouts trying to protect himself from the blade that he will soon feel sinking into his flesh.
<< I don't think I could bear it for so long >> Fox laughs heartily.
<< What it played against you >> points out Sherlock. << If you had let Scotland Yard do it, they would have dismissed the case as natural death and you would already have your answer >>.
Greg's observation is correct, but John has this feeling, this very bad feeling that persists.
<< I never asked you if you think like him about it >> he asks him just by glancing at him. Sherlock discovers he can't handle his brother's gaze right now.
<< I ... I do not think that the car ended immediately in the precipice >> says John, his eyes fixed on the trunk of the tree against which the car impacted. << The car remained in the balance, Greg >> he says running to the trunk. << It remained in the balance and must then be collapsed down, driven by the storm >>.
November 25th
"Please give this drama queen an Oscar!" Moriarty exclaims. The fact that his voice insinuates his thoughts even now that he is not in his Mind Palace should worry him, instead he does not give him much weight. Sherlock carries on that shower that barely heats him, aware of the fact that Mary will soon return to bring him back to his cell, whispering the need to hurry. Sherlock wraps himself in the rough bathrobe and crouches on the tub board and that's how Mary finds him.
Mycroft stopped, shook his head and started smoking again without concluding the sentence. For the second time in a few hours.
<< It is unusual for me to leave Morgan with someone else, but...That child ... is so alone >> whispers. << He needs a friend. Nobody should be alone at that age >>
<< Your unbelief offends me, little sister >>.
<< Bad habit, in fact >> Mycroft replies, observing the glowing embers of the cigarette.
Sherlock realizes he is naked. Naked as a worm. Whoever put him on that bed stripped him, washed him, medicated him, and plastered his leg, before tucking him in the felted woolen blankets over raw cotton sheets.
<< We couldn't have been the only ones >> he whispers. << The chief of the hotel would not have asked me to investigate, otherwise >>.
It is destabilizing for anyone to be torn from their safe place, from their habits, from things that can be said to be their own. If someone have ailments like Mary's it is not only destabilizing but destructive. She found herself again in a cold place, surrounded by people ready to treat her badly and she was unable to cope. Even though Sherlock and John had finally managed to find a lawyer who is well disposed towards her. Even if the jury had understood the situation, despite the prejudices and fear before that big woman. The verdict had arrived and had seen her doomed, yes, but for the murder of family members and found her innocent for everyone else. Mary had achieved significant extenuating circumstances and would soon be moved to a better managed shelter than the one in which she was staying. Of the one in which she decided to end her life.
The victim was pulled on the arm.
<< I don't see how my heart could burn with this story >> Sherlock annoys annoyed.
Sherlock backs away frightened. The man's arm rises again and the sharp blade points him, eager to sink into his flesh.
<< I didn't even know we had any at home >> Sherlock replies. << You don't feel well >> he notes and John doesn't like his eyes on him at all.
<< I bet two >>.
<< Oh god, Sherlock. If we had a son what would you do? >> laughs John. The consultant pulls up on his elbow and looks at him in amazement.
Mary had torn the bandage on the forehead with a sharp blow, regardless of the possibility of hurting him. She had sprayed the wound with disinfectant and dabbed it vigorously before covering it again.
<< Hey, Billy. What's happening to you? >> he asks.
The doctor finds himself once again moving from one gaze to another, feeling himself the third of a blind date. The guitarist gives new light to his smile, while he perfectly imitates the scratchy voice of Kurt Cobain, and the consultant puts that charming smile on his lips again.
<< Bravo, Captain Kidd. My compliments >> Sherlock says, smiling at him.
See you soon
Sherlock laughs at his impetuous being and, sighing at his kisses that redden his neck, he ventures under John’s bathrobe. He caresses the bare skin of John's back, on which he draws small circles capable of making his doctor shiver.
<< Let me at least try, please. I'm stuck here and I'm not used to all this stillness. I think it would be good for me to be able to take care of myself at least with a shave >>.
The woman slowly hits John's hand and snatches him from his thoughts. John sketches a smile ready to reply with a laconic 'Yes, of course', but he stops. Her impeccably made-up eyes show a clear nuisance, equal to what John felt for the whole day spent together in front of her continuous talk.
<< Don't miss this spontaneity >> Sherlock says and a tear leaves his eyelashes. John watches the tear go down Sherlock's pale cheek. He puts his hand on Sherlock's knee and squeezes it, giving him a smile when he meets his gaze. << Now I think it's a good thing to showing the doctor this bad bruise, what do you say? >>.
<< Silver considered you his friend and you betrayed him >> whispers the child, crying. Morgan barks at the girl, backing away to William.
There are only three folders on the desktop: the trush, the internet connection and one named 'My books'. Sherlock opens it and finds two subfolders. He opens the first, named 'Concluded', and scrolls through a significant amount of subfolders named with the titles of the Sharon Milton's stories and novels . Sherlock closes it and opens the second one, named the 'Laboratory'.
They laugh like two children now free to start a beautiful new game.
<< Do you realize that the manager gave us this suite, this one and not others? He gave us a double room, Sherlock, do you realize what that means? >>.
"So what did you see at the fountain this morning?"
Sherlock swallows and shakes his hands tightly. Several times he tries to look John in the eye but he can't.
The cell phone rings simultaneously with the scientific monitor. While the one highlights John's video call, the other lets Sherlock know the origin of yet another type of soil found under the sole.
John decides to leave Sherlock's hand and leave that room after days sitting by his side. He caresses Sherlock's face, barely beaded with sweat. John remains hesitant to look at Sherlock's lips, eager to place his own on them and kiss him.
When the concert begins, Sherlock, strategically seated by the front door, silent as a cat leaves the group. With a brisk step and looking around he goes to the staff changing rooms, the ones that the director told him to be connected to the visitors' changing room. Sherlock looks at the many lockers quickly and pauses to break one. He needs to get rid of a doubt that has been running through his head since the beginning of this case. He rummages through the personal belongings of the locker owner and, in the inside pocket of a backpack, finds a letter. He opens it, reads it quickly and a satisfied smile appears on his face. Sherlock puts the letter in his bathrobe pocket and, alarmed by a noise, reaches the visitors' locker room through the retractable door that connects it to it.
"Try to stop with these ideas, if you don't want me to skyrocket you!"
"Look at what we've come to, for trying to protect I don't even know what anymore" John sighs, leaning towards the fireplace. The heat wave burns his skin.
John doesn't know what to argue. It is a delicate situation that should be handled delicately. But just looking around to understand that there is no room for delicacy within those walls. The staff of this medical prison will stuff Mary with drugs and let her die slowly. John realizes that, even by setting in motion all the knowledge that both he and Sherlock can have and by paying the best lawyers, the situation will not be different from that. Even if they'll managed to make Mary accuse of the only murders of family members.
<< You are not really going to do what I think! >>.
<< Of course! What an idiot I am! >> Sherlock exclaims, clapping his hand on his forehead. He runs to John and presses a kiss on his lips. << My surefire light conductor! >> says tapping John's cheeks. << We are dealing with a writer! A writer >> shouts, but neither John nor those present seem to grasp the reason for his enthusiasm. Sherlock passes his hands exasperated on his face and takes a deep breath. << Sharon Milton stalked O’Hara by putting into action what she wrote in her stories. It is there that we will also find the place where O'Hara is held prisoner >> he says, pointing to the pc.
<< A place where you waste time >> he says with disappointment.
<< Edward, what's going on? >> asks the child Mary and, feeling himself the greatest of idiots, Sherlock melts into tears. She approaches and, with this new delicacy that she has shown him since the day of shaving, Mary places her hand in Sherlock's hair in an attempt to cheer him up. Sherlock promptly grabs it and sinks it into his face, feeling the scent of pine, iron and sawdust.
<< Hey, Captain Kidd, can you keep it a secret? >> asks Sherlock with a whisper. The child nods, raising his eyes to meet Sherlock's eyes. << Even my parents were two idiots. My father was just like yours, violent with words and hands and cold as ice. The only thing that mattered to him was his reputation and career. The other things were a frame that had to be perfect and flawless. My mother suffered his outbursts, but, unlike yours, she did not read me  books before going to sleep, nor did she play pirates with me. She too was distant, unreachable. I learned not to cry anymore, to not feel anything and to use only my intelligence, the only thing that seemed to be really important. But family said to me for a long time that I was a fool >> Sherlock says, wiping the tears from his face. << Then I tried to run away from them. From their memory. I hurted myself to drive away their voices. I have lost sight of myself in an attempt to make myself accepted for who I am, to change them. Except that they didn't change, they always remained cold, severe, distant and lost in their priorities. I was changing instead. I became like them, because, unfortunately, I loved them and wanted their love. To the point of forgetting to love myself. In spite of all this, if I am the man that you see now, is also thanks to them. If they had been different I don't know if I would have pursued my goal and created this unique profession in the world. I don't know if I would be happy as I am now. I could not choose my parents, but I was able to choose my friends from whom I obtained the love and recognition that I needed and that I deserve. Also from the four-legged ones >>, Sherlock says, caressing Morgan who opens an eye and then closes it, muttering annoyed, << and from the two-legged ones >> he says, placing his heartfelt gaze on John's moved one. << William, surround yourself with trusted people who can remember how much you are worth and love you for who you are and not for what they want you to be. You have Kelly, who loves you like a mother, and your mom. Well, I think that after what happened, she will be able to fight for you. For yours and her happiness >>.
<< What do you know? You're not a dog >> retorts John, taking closer to him. Sherlock laughs, yawning and approaches in turn.
<< No, Mari. I think she already knew what to do with me from the moment she found me. The same thing your father used to do. You knew it and wanted to take me downstream, but the storm prevented you from saving me >>.
<< A bad situation, yes >> confirms Sherlock. << As I said this morning, the system is made up of three distinct phases. At the beginning they really only give information and answer users' questions. They are assigned a tutor, who begins to become familiar with the young, gathering more and more confidential information, strengthened by the trust of these desperate people. At that point they make a skim and focus on the most fragile, inviting them to attend free public conferences. Conferences conducted by real experts among which, however, there are unrecommendable characters >>.
<< Are you planning to cut it out of your life? >> Mycroft asks him directly. Sherlock sighs. He realizes that the time has come to really face what happened and above all what he feels. He walked around it in the days spent segregated in that house and even while he was there to freeze in that pit. Now he can no longer remain in the safe place which is his Mind Palace.
<< I help him when I can >> he answers, staring at that damned clock's hand that is taking too long to move on the 12.
<< This is only a hypothesis, doctor >> Hataway replies. << It doesn't take away from the fact that, even if it were, your friend wouldn't have survived the storm all this time if he stayed outdoors >>.
"Damn manuals! They weigh a quintal and are worth a lot less” he thinks, turning the door knob, once he reaches the flat. He finds it closed, which is unusual. He has been living here for almost a year and never used the key once to open it. In fact, John looks for the key in the deck and must try a few before finding the right one. He peeks into the living room, looking around circumspectly. No trace of Sherlock.
The moans, previously suffocated to prevent the dog from barking while keeping the whole neighborhood awake, can now find the right outlet, by bringing a greater dose of pleasure and satisfaction.
<< No, I also learned alone >>.
<< Incitement to prostitution, suicide and cyberbullying. And all this for a place on the front line in a place that does not exist in all respects >> John is shocked. << And Lizzy ... in which phase she is? >>.
“I don't want to, John. I don't want any more poison in my body. "
<< Well, you also live here. I take care of him, but you will find him a little between your feet. I thought that calling him with a name that you like could help you bear him >>.
<< I don't feel guilty about anything, Mycroft >> John jumps up, facing him. << The only thing I feel is that something bad has happened to your brother. Despite the discussion we had, Sherlock wouldn't keep me in the dark about how much it's been living for so long >>.
Quote from Carroll's 'Alice in Wonderland'
<< They were also very useful >> adds Sherlock.
Of course it must however be difficult for her to find gloves that are not small, even among men's sizes.
<< Sharon? >> the child whispers in amazement.
<< Sitz und still
<< I knew it was for that! >> George proudly exclaims and Sherlock nods satisfied with him.
John does not look down, intent on making the ice man understand who he is dealing with. Mycroft remove his smile from his lips.
<< I was hoping to save it >>.
<< Yes >> Sherlock admits and only now can he close his eyes. He knows what he's going to say.
<< It is what I fear >>.
<< No, Ms Ford took it from my hands immediately and I couldn't read anything. I never saw her so nervous. Luckily Billy was out with Kelly that afternoon and did not see his father's reaction when Mr Ford came home >>.
<< I had to do it >> she still tries to justify herself while the tears roll on her square face.
<< No, Mary. You executed murderers. I am sorry only you have not been able to eliminate them all >>.
He suddenly stops at the entrance to the tube. A couple of people send him to hang out for that sudden arrest, but he doesn't mind. John sees Sherlock standing in an alley not far away. He is not alone. The person he is talking to, however, is in the shade.
Sherlock performs the last bend and in the way of getting up he loses his balance. John grabs him, but tumbles on one of the wooden sticks they use for some exercises. He falls back on the floor with Sherlock on him.
John observes that beautiful outstretched hand. Here is the demonstration of what he was trying to explain to Sherlock. When they are separated, nobody mistakes him for Sherlock Holmes' 'partner'. When they are far away, this kind of pleasant and unexpected thing happens.
<< I hosted a man for one night. I don't see what's wrong >> Sherlock says, typing a message quickly.
<< Where are you, Sherlock? >> he wonders, feeling a strange concern close his stomach.
<< You says so >> John mutters, that continues to have before his eyes that square face partially covered by the blue scarf and those huge, strong, powerful hands.
<< Not even you >> specifies him, who always wants, damn, the last word.
Sherlock remains motionless, looking at the door. He realizes once again how tense he when that woman corrupts the air with her presence.
<< You didn't answer me, John >>.
They laugh out loud like two little boys who get lost in chatter instead of doing homework. They look at each other for a long time, returning serious.
<< No, thank you, I don't want to go around with a stick like John >>.
<< Stay here >> John orders, by going to the bathroom. Come back with a tube of ointment in his hand. John invites Sherlock to sit at the chair of the kitchen table, always cluttered with  chemist's equipment, and the consultant performs docile. Too docile.
<< You can't understand! You're still too young, Lizzy! >> retorts the mother, her voice broken by tears for the accusations suffered. << Your father was never here. He always investigate with that one >> she says, pointing Sherlock, imperturbable. << I felt abandoned and I could not bear that you grew up without a father >>.
<< He leaves the house through window of my room, the same one from which he entered >> Sherlock replies casually. John looks at him with a big eyes. << It is the only way to evade the surveillance cameras controlled by my brother >> Sherlock says, indicating, with a gesture of the head, the window behind them.
<< A girl committed suicide and her family asked my flatmate to investigate >>.
The information seems to reach him in stages, which makes him seriously worry about the extent of the damage to his brain caused by the blow.
<< Never again, I swear it >> whispers Sherlock, massaging the throat. The woman seems to reflect on what to do, which brings the tension to the stars.
"I tried to change him" he thinks and the confused looks that Sherlock launched him at the pub, the discomfort so well imprinted on his face, come back to him. When John saw him drinking, he realized that he had made a real trouble not to allow Sherlock to stay at home, as he would have liked.
<< He is dead >> the inspectore interrupts him. << It's been five years now. He slipped on the frozen steps of his cellar and broke his neck bone. The eldest son, Jack, came to call me. A tragic misfortune. He was good. Bad character, heavy hand on their children, too, but he knew do  his work. He saved many lives and helped to gave birth to others. His home was transformed into a real hospital in seasons like this. We miss the presence of a doctor here. The closest, when Keswick is unreachable, is in Penrith, not just around the corner >>.
<< She will be angry >> says George still standing in his father's embrace and not intent on leaving.
<< And you a bad comedian >> retorts John, raising an eyebrow.
<< Because I saw you so convinced in your desire to help that woman. I found it strange, but I thought you had to have your good reasons >>.
<< Sharon Milton is a 23 year old young woman. She works as a warehouse worker at Tesco in the night shift and spends the day partly sleeping, I guess, and partly at this pc, writing his delusions. O'Hara is one of her favorite authors and is a well-known mystery writer. Her best-known best seller is 'Mater misericordiae' and there are even three copies in the library: the cheap one, the first one she purchased and the most consumed by countless and repetitive readings; the reprint to celebrate the million copies sold and the gold one, that she will surely have presented to her favorite writer to have it autographed. I would say that it is elementary to deduce that the pc password of this crazy girl of ours can only be the title of her favorite book >>.
A scream comes down and John holds his breath. He knows they are going to say it. They are about to announce that they have found a man's corps, the seat belt still inserted and the face covereb by the exploded airbag .
<< Yes, I'm one of them >> sketches a smile. << Edward Nolton >> introduces himself, holding out his hand.
The woman's mouth draws a funny 'O'. The hand that knots the braid stops completely, prey of amazement. Her face then squeezes like a sponge and explodes into tears.
<< Why didn't you tell me how much you knew during your interrogation? >> Greg asks him.
"What are you doing?".
<< It's a sadomasochistic game >> Sherlock replies, punching Martin's  face.
<< You are smarter than Sherlock, even he admitted it. Don't say, however, that I told you, please >> John adds, biting his tongue in front of what had to remain a confidence. Mycroft laughs amused at a time when laughter is totally out of place. Just like his brother. << Do you see? You are the same! >> John exclaims, rolling his eyes. << I can assist you as I did to him >>.
<< What's going on? >> Greg asks, realizing the conditions of Sherlock.
<< Every day >> nods Mary, amused. << Even if I did not understand what was wrong >> adds seriously, bringing a finger to the chin. She thinks about it for a few moments and then shakes her head, smiling amused. << Did your mom love you? >> asks him, touching another hot topic.
<< Are you sure you want to go there? >> Hataway asked him, twisting his nose. Penitentiary asylums do not have an excellent reputation and certainly John would have spared the trip. However, he had to get rid of a doubt, even if he is now so nervous that it escapes him.
Sherlock nods against John's shoulder. He crouches in John's arms in search of comfort and, although not the best of times, John feels great joy.
<< And we have a pink suitcase somewhere? >>.
<< Do not melt this beautiful head, ok? >> he says, placing a kiss on Sherlock's forehead. John takes the cup with chamomile and leaves the apartment. Only when he closes his bedroom door behind him does realize what he has done.
<< I shouldn't have left you alone >> John whispers.
<< We found your parents. The police men are taking them to the hospital for checks, but they are fine >> says John, kneeling next to them. The child squeezes Sherlock even harder.
<< The chief commissioner too? >> Sherlock presses him. The detective's eyes widen in amazement.
<< I knew it! Dad said I wasted time in a stupid game and that I must accept Silver's death >>.
<< But haven't you understood yet that those people are brainwashing those who sign up? >> George says, incredulous of his sister's naivety. << Mr. Holmes, please, tell her what you found out >>.
Sherlock takes one of Morgan's nibbled balls, abandoned on his armchair. He twirls it in his hands and sits down. John imitates him by taking his place.
<< Sherlock, when will I be able to stay in a super luxury hotel again? >>.
<< He is your flatmate? The  consulting detective you write about on your blog? >> she asks, excited.
"Please, please, please!" Sherlock thinks intensely, his hands clenched into fists. The woman wakes up and throws the razor on Sherlock's lap. Fortunately, the reflexes, although slowed down, still work and allow him to move his left arm away just before the blade hits him. Sherlock dares not imagine what would have happened if the blade had cut him. With a razor in hand, Mary's explosion of anger could only end in a very tragic way for Sherlock.
<< Shit >> whispers rolling his eyes.
<< Yes. And I assure you that it was not easy for me to explain the opposite >>.
he thinks annoyed.
<< Because Mr Ford comes back home very late and vents his anger after dinner, John >> Sherlock says, taking the women by surprise. << The fired maid gave many details in the interview that she released. Mr Ford humiliate his wife and his son
<< Of course I want, Sherlock >> John smiles at him, hesitantly taking his hand. << I want to take care of you. I have been trying to do this since the day I met you. I thank you for this opportunity >>.
<< If it is not a mass grave and the corpses are not dead on the same day it could be the landfill of a serial killer >> Sherlock says even more excited.
"Not only does he smoke during the investigation, always assuming he is investigating, but also ... this too!" he blurts up from his observation post, not at all intending to stay there to watch their effusions. The guitarist was already enough for him.
<< You got it! It's about kidnapping. Albert Ford, his wife Margaret and their eight-year-old son were kidnapped tonight. No ransom has yet been requested. The chief commissioner is nervouse and I haven't useful clues >>.
<< Your mother's novel is so trivial that, while killings, the woman sings a song. Do you want to hear it? >>.
<< Mysterious and idiots >> he points out and Morgan barks, finding himself in agreement with Sherlock. << What did you find out? >>.
<< I saw you today >> John admits, continuing to touch Sherlock's wrist. << It was a coincidence, I didn't do it on purpose. Indeed I would have preferred not to see you >>.
<< You haven't stopped, Greg >>.
Only those who had no one who could report their disappearance were 'liquidated', as Mrs Abbott diligently noted. It upsets to realize how many lonely people there are in the world. Yes, because that macabre activity seemed to have started in the 90s of the last century and since then had caused the death of 35 people. For none of these, the disappearance had been reported.
<< Sharon Milton, I declare you under arrest for the kidnapping of the Ford spouses and for the attempted murder of their son William >> Greg recites approaching Sherlock. << Ok, now leave her to me, Sherlock >> says to the consultant, who does not seem in the least intent to free the woman.
<< Did not find any drugs in the victim's blood? >> asks Molly intent on working on the bathrobe.
<< Of course! >> echoes John. << You found Mr and Ms Ford's footprints but there isn't anything about their son >>.
he says rationally, feeling on the belly skin the now dry presence of what the attacker has left on him. A new hitch goes up to his throat. He represses it.
<< It would be impossible to do otherwise >> he answers, wrinkling his nose.
John is right. Mary gives the idea of being able to stand alive stoically for a long time even unloading an entire loader on her, let alone what can do with a simple razor.
<< Consulting detective >> John corrects her, too acid again.
<< It is a tempting proposal, Mr. Holmes >> to laugh at the woman. << I will use it, however, as a last resort. It will be a real pleasure for me to invite you to dinner as soon as I have settled home >>.
<< Which version do you prefer? >> go back to ask the boy.
<< I won't take advantage of you, don't worry >> Sherlock says, kissing John’s neck slowly. << I don't even know if this suits you >>.
<< Of him as of all the others, otherwise I would not take them into account >>.
Sherlock stand up and runs his finger over his folders to the letter F.
Sherlock chuckles shaking his head. Then he looks at the master with disgust, as if he were annoyed by his smell.
The rest of Sherlock is something too big to be supported in its entirety. The sensuality that shines through every movement when he lets himself be carried away by the music he plays and composes. The rapid movements that make him so similar to a hound when he follows the track during the investigation. The rigidity in moments of embarrassment or uncertainty and the laxity of the endless days of boredom. John would go crazy if he took all these things together. For this reason, his attention always goes to these three elements: eyes, lips and hands.
"Wow, I didn't know you were a contortionist too," he says mischievously, observing with satisfaction what is happening on the sofa. “To see you I wouldn't say it. You give the idea of being rigid, woody. But look at how interesting your flexibility is,” Moriarty  says, turning Sherlock's head forcefully towards the scene.
<< Oh my God, did you hurt yourself? How's the leg going? >> asks John worried.
push yourself to suicide. They do it with all those deemed dangerous for the real purposes of the portal >>.
<< I would say that it is not a good sign! >>.
<< Aren't you going to be a damn pervert? >> the woman thunders furiously, rising in all her greatness.
<< Too long! Mr. Holmes, I must ask you to continue the investigation and give me a certain answer as soon as possible >>.
<< Drink the broth, it will do you good >> the woman invites him, interrupting that silent quarrel. Although he would do without it, Sherlock takes the plate with both hands and brings it to his mouth. He must keep the woman in the 'happy child' mode as much as possible if he wants to get out of here alive.
"Survive, Sherlock."
<< I'm not sure >> Sherlock says, throwing his arms around John’s neck. << I'm afraid you have to try again >> he whispers.
<< What kind of checks? >> Mycroft teases him.
in this valley of tears
<< In front there is the nose and behind the tail, how can you not understand it? It's so obvious >>.
<< The fastest way to track her down and not lose sight of her >> Sherlock says, shrugging. John sighs and decides to let it go.
<< Hey, John, what's wrong with you? >> Greg asks him, who immediately rushes to help him get up back.
<< Good morning, John.  Hi little one >> says the lady, caressing the puppy who seems to know her well.
<< Dad has always been very sweet to you. Of course there was for few time here, but when you married him you knew he was a detective and he wanted to make a career. George and I could not choose. We arrived later and we found the situation as it is. Instead, you could have chosen to not marry him.
He turns and sees himself standing in front of a large mahogany desk. From the fine leather armchair his father watches him sternly. The elbows resting on the armrests, the fingers of the hands joined at the height of the chest. Standing beside him, a younger Mycroft makes his gaze travel from father to brother. Invisible drops of sweat bead on Mycroft's forehead betray his tension.
<< What a kind thought >> Sherlock mumbles, as they leave the hotel on the cold autumn morning.
It is not the first time that a homophobe beats him. He has suffered many beatings as a student and has always faced them with dignity.
“Could be that she will castrate you. In the other way, coul be that she will cut off one of your hands. Or maybe both. For better or for worse, obviously it is at your discretion to choose which option to place them in, little brother! ”.
The first authentic expression of sadness. An anguished child's pout. The lower lip begins to tremble, but Mary squints hard and when she opens them she is happy again.
<< You are not a ski teacher. You are a policeman, one of those who takes people away >> she accuses him angry.
<< Nobody, fortunately, Mr inspector >> she says, smiling with embarrassment. << Mr Inspector, you can also spare the round of patrols up to us >> she adds, tucking her scarf on her cheeks, reddened by the cold.
<< No, John. I can be smarter than Sherlock, it's true, but I have no method. He gives importance to things that elude me because I don't consider them. Most of the time because I find them superfluous >>.
<< It will not be easy to go back to the same rhythms as before. You turned our life upside down, little guy >> John says, scratching Morgan's head. << Here they need him and in any case we can always come to meet him >> he says and Sherlock approves nodding.
<< See? You scare him! >> says the consultant, glancing at the doctor.
<< You really must >> retorts John mercilessly.
<< Guys, come on, get out of here. Go home and do your homework! >> order to them Greg, pointing the door. The two young Lestrade abandon the 221B one still red, the other crawling their feet. When he hears them go down the steps, Greg approaches Fox.
<< You wanted me to touch you, you damned pervert? >> she cried, tearing off of his body the stained sheets. For a moment Sherlock had feared she would hit him in the genitals. Luckily she had only thrown to him at a towel, that Sherlock had used to stop the hemorrhage. She ran out, leaving him in bed, naked as a worm, still partially wet from the wash she was carrying on.
<< In a way I owe it to you too, you know? >>.
"The child. He's the one who wants! " Sherlock thinks to give himself courage and force his body to move. Another cry, certainly launched by the terrified child, helps him to move.
<< You did not give voice to your deductions >> John says to the consultant, who came to his side.
<< Yes, but I would not be okay with my conscience, Mr. Holmes >> replies the director. << I don't want to managing a hotel where rapes and assaults are committed >>.
Apparently, John and Mrs. Hudson worried in vain when they realized that they would both be missing from 221B for part of their respective commitments. Ms Hudson visiting her sister and John engaged in that boring course. Apparently, the consultant must have decided to take the opportunity and fly away in turn to who knows what shores.
<< Are you and him married? >>.
<< Daddy came to pick us up at school yesterday. Always he go get me first and then let's go get Lizzy together. I'd heard about the Pall Mall girl's suicide and asked him if he was working on it. He said yes even though, as always, he didn't go into detail. He's afraid of traumatizing me, as my mother always tells him >> he says, twisting his nose. << While we waited, Lizzy, dad received a phone call and got out of the car, always to avoid traumatizing me >> he rolls his eyes. << And I, as always, peeked through his papers. I was sure to find what I eventually found >>.
<< Daisy Cooper was in the last year in my school. It is from her that I heard about the Fenix portal. She was talking about it to friends in the bathroom at school. I stayed to listen and that same evening I enrolled. At the beginning it was nice, but now ... now it's hell >> tears come down to paint black lines on her cheeks.
"Really?".
Sherlock struggles. He feels that the man's body press on his. One hand locks his head against the wall and the other squeezes his arm. Sherlock can't scream. He tries to hit the man but he feels he is without strength.
