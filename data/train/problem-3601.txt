"Babe, what the hell did you do?  You’re back is nothing but knots.” Dean asked, as he straddled Castiel’s thighs so he could massage his back.
“Yes, father.” the omega answered with a smile.
“Papa said you umm… you hit his car.” six year old Emma pipes up.
“Oh yes, Dean.  I think I could see myself seeing a lot of you.”  Castiel says as he ducks under Dean’s arm.  They ride to a nearby diner in Dean’s Baby.  They hold hands while they eat cheeseburgers and drink milkshakes.
Dean is floored by all the information just dropped on him.  “Well it's sweet that you still brought her flowers even though she was a total bitch.” Dean remarks.
“You’ve never had to face me in court.” Castiel counters smiling at Dean.
Day 23: Back Rubs
“Not at all.  I brought water for you to drink as well.  It’s important to stay hydrated, especially on a day as warm as today.” Castiel said with a smile looking out over the lake.
On the morning of Castiel’s wedding feast, the omega awoke to Charlie standing by his bed smiling at him.  She points to his bedside table where a vase of freshly cut roses sit.  “They’re from Dean.  He rose early to cut them for you. I’ve never seen that fool alpha so excited.  King John sent him off for a ride because he was driving everybody crazy.
"That sounds lovely.  Thank you Charlie."  Sam spoke up for the first time.
Believe me
When Castiel discovered he was pregnant with Ben, their first child, he handed Dean a bouquet of pink roses and baby’s breath.  The alpha had been intently listening to his omega’s ramblings about flowers and knew the meaning.  The alpha was overjoyed and fussed over Castiel even more than before.  A couple of months ago, Castiel handed Dean another bundle of pink roses and baby’s breath.  They are expecting their fourth child in the Spring.
Dean was a mated omega.  It still made his heart race when he thought about it.  Dean and Castiel had mated on the alpha’s birthday a little over a month ago.  Castiel may not have acted like a typical alpha but he knotted like one.  Castiel was an awesome bedmate.  The alpha treated Dean like a treasure and at the same time gave Dean such erotic pleasure that the omega appeared more bow legged the day after.  Sam had laughed at Dean.  The omega flipped off his little brother, called Sam a bitch, then snuggled into his alpha who defended him by lecturing Sam on decorum.
June 6, 1951 - October 31, 2012
Day 29: Secretly Taking Pics of One Another
They had just finished eating and setting up Cas’ camera when the peak of the meteor shower started.
“Dean, we are supposed to be celebrating.  Why are you torturing me instead?” Castiel said, trying to restrain his fiance.
“Is that a problem?” Blue Eyes says sternly.
“Ketch you better put that hand down and back away.  I’m cutting you off and calling you a cab.  You go home and sober up without arguing and I’ll give you 24 hours to confess to Mick about how you’ve behaved tonight.” Dean says sliding Castiel’s drink to him.
Dean fingers the smooth black box in his leather jacket’s pocket.  This is where he met Castiel.  In two years, Castiel has healed all the wounds of Dean’s soul.  He can’t imagine his life without him in it.  He hopes he never has to.
“I know, this part is for me.  Damn, love your ass.” Dean said as he massaged said ass.
“Nonsense Cassie.  You’re going onstage in fifteen minutes.  Live a little.” Balthazar quipped and went back to flirting with Crowley and his girlfriend Hannah.  Balthazar did love a menage trois.
Castiel nods his agreement as he sips his tea.  Charlie takes her leave and Castiel ponders what the day will hold.
“Sam will come home to visit you know? It’s not like he’s going to outer Mongolia.  He won’t be far away, my love.” Castiel said before stealing a kiss from Dean.
Day 23: Back Rubs
Castiel snuggled into Dean’s arm before whispering, “Is it time for bed?”
“Yes.” Deans says letting the exhaustion he feels into his voice.  Becky takes the wet paper from Dean’s hand and rips it up.  Then she stares at where Chuck is standing across the room.  “You are all so damn weird.” Dean huffs as he walks away.
"Enough Samuel!  Let's make ourselves presentable for a new king."  Dean groused.
“I’m in the area doing some explorations and needed somewhere to relax.  Found your bar online and it looked interesting and not a hole in the wall as you say.” Castiel says before taking a drink.
Dean finds himself watching the couple as they go round and round in their car.  With each revolution the girl looks more and more upset.  Mr. Hot Blue Eyes looks totally done by the time Dean is getting ready to stop the ride.  The redhead opens the car before Dean can get there and practically sprints away with rage rolling off her.
For two hours she accesses both of them.  She declares Sam will be able to attend university after a year of tutoring.  She finds out Dean likes to work with his hands and decides to see about finding a craftsman to apprentice him too.  Dean is excited and nervous all at the same time.
“I feel the same.” Castiel says looking at Dean’s lips.  Dean nods to the unasked question.  When their lips meet, Dean's whole body heats up with desire.  He no longer cares about the test he has to take in a few hours.  He has Cas’ warm lips on his.
King John and Queen Mary kissed both of their foreheads.  “Let the feast begin!” John yelled out.
When the music for Sam Smith’s, “Not in That Way”, finished the place was silent for a beat.  Then people clapped and cheered.  Dean however just stared at him.  The look was sad and maybe uncertain.  Castiel felt the endorphin rush he’d been using to keep it together, waning.  He rushed off stage before the tears could be seen.  He went out the backdoor of the club into the ally.  He kicked some boxes sitting next to the dumpster and shouted out his anguish into the night, that didn’t care.
King Castiel walked into the throne room to the sound of trumpets.  He couldn't help rolling his eyes at all the nobles standing around and gawking.  He found them all ignorant and annoying.  None of them cared about him or the kingdom.  The nobles only thought of what they could gain from cozying up to him.
King John smiled, “I am honored to hear you call me that.  I shall leave you now so Charlie can come in and help you with your final preparations.”  John stood and Castiel with him.  The next thing Castiel knew the king swept him into a hug and then released him before rushing out the door.
~Christmas Eve~
Castiel had very little family and those that he did have did not speak to him.  That was the trouble with being a gay man in a very religious familty.  Gabriel, his cousin, was loyal to him.  Gabriel adored him and he Gabriel.  Sadly Gabriel traveled constantly and Castiel only saw him a few times a year.
Gabriel goes straight to the kitchen.  “Stress baking?  Alright out with it.  What has got you so worked up?” Gabriel says picking up a brownie and shoving it in his mouth.
Dean could hardly believe it.  His little brother, Sam was married to the love of his life Eileen.  They were both big shot lawyers.  Sam was a prosecutor and Eileen was an advocate for people with disabilities.  Dean was proud of who they were and that they were starting a life together.  He was also very jealous.
All goes silent as they turn to the king for his reaction.  The alpha is quiet for a moment before he breaks out laughing heartily.  “I was right.  Court is going to be so much more entertaining with you two here.”
“Who are you writing to?” Dean asks as he plops down on the sofa and stares out the window.
“Dean, I think we’ve got this.” Castiel says, dropping the Ancient History text book on the bed.
Dean would find himself stroking his fingers over his mating bite and thanking whatever deity was out there for allowing him to have Castiel.  When the alpha had sunk his teeth into his neck, Dean felt the profound bond they already had light up like lightning running through his body.  When Dean sank his teeth into Castiel’s neck, the alpha had writhed and whined while chanting over and over how he belonged to Dean.  When Castiel’s knot finally went down enough for them to pull apart, Dean had found himself with arms full of a weeping alpha.  Dean was worried at first until the alpha was able to voice that he was just overwhelmed.  The omega had rubbed the alpha’s back until he was calm and fell asleep.
“And how will you treat me?  Will I be your property, your concubine among many?”  Castiel said with anger in his voice, when it was actually fear that was clutching at his heart like a vice.
Becky audibly gasped and started to loudly object to everything she could in a single breath.  Charlie looked done, “Ms. Rosen you need to keep your opinions and beliefs to yourself and be civil or I’ll be forced to report you to your advisor, Mr. Edlund.”
~The Next Halloween~
“Who are you?  How did you gain entry to the grounds?” Castiel interrogated the alpha.
“Tomorrow I am exploring The Turner House.”
“I realize that.” Castiel said stonely, trying not to let Dean see him shiver.
“I beg your forgiveness for my rudeness.  I am Prince Dean of Lawrence.  I have come here to meet my future mate, Prince Castiel of Pontiac.  That is you, am I right?” the alpha spoke softly.
‘I made it.” the alpha humbly replied.
“Damn, it’s so cold Cas!” Dean called from the kitchen of their small one bedroom house that they had been living in for about six months.
After the feast they were brought out to the darkened courtyard and treated to fireworks to further the celebration.  Dean kissed him while the explosions burst over their heads.  The alpha whispered in his ear, “We should go now while we can.” Castiel merely nodded.
“If you keep doing that I am going to leave you here Sammy.  You can walk home and it looks like it is going to rain.” Dean said with a devilish grin.  Sam shut his piehole and left Dean alone after that.
When Castiel enters the great hall that evening for dinner, he finds everyone waiting for him.  He is showered in gifts.  The most amazing thing is Prince Gabriel and Princess Anna are there to celebrate with him.  They plan to stay for quite some time, maybe until Castiel and Dean’s mating ceremony.  The omega has never had such a wonderful day.  That night when Dean sweetly kisses him goodnight, Castiel wonders if he’s living in a dream.
“You are more than I deserve.” Dean says chastly kissing the omega’s lips.
“I like you too Cas.  You have my number and I yours.  Text me and we’ll go out again next weekend.  You pick the place this time and I’ll be there.” Dean says with a smile.
“To drink?” Ellen asks.
“I prefer to keep to myself and the community is lovely.  I’m here to post this flyer and be on my way.  I have a busy day ahead of me.” Castiel lies.
“It is something for you to think about later.  No need to worry yourself about it now.”  KIng John said to calm the omega.
“We should take Claire and Jack with us.  They may be all grown up but they are still a part of this family.” Castiel said, fixing his cuffs.
“What are we going to do now, Babe?  I mean we sort of have an empty nest.” Dean said as he fought with his tie.
“I don’t need it to be legendary.  I just need the safety of your arms, your touch, your lips.  Beloved Alpha, you are all that I need.” Castiel declares as they make another turn around the fountain.
“Well Dean, do you want to go inside and have a dance with me?” Castiel asks hopeful.
“Before I make more of a fool of myself, what can I get you to drink?” Dean says, giving Castiel a genuine smile that reaches his eyes.  Castiel feels a chill go up his spine.  A drink is a good idea.  Maybe it’ll calm him a bit.
“Sammy go get ice for the honored omega.” Bobby speaks from right behind Castiel.  The omega is startled because he was unaware there was anyone there.  Soon Bobby and Dean have most of the mess cleared from his face but he’ll need another bath to get it out of his hair and a clean shirt.  Sammy brings ice and Dean gently holds it to the omega’s nose.
“I am ready, my gorgeous omega.” Castiel said, carrying his camera case.  They were going outside the city limits to view a meteor shower away from light pollution.  Castiel hoped to get some nightscape photos of it.
Dean didn’t pay much attention to the people boarding until a dark haired guy with brilliant blue eyes caught his attention.  The guy looked to be Dean’s age if not a bit older.  Dean admired how he filled out the blue jeans he was wearing and he found the preppy sweater the guy was wearing adorable.  He boarded with a red haired girl that was talking his ear off.  Damn, all the hot ones were either straight, taken or both.  Fuck his life.
“They’re not dating you idiot!  They’re married!” Jo counters back to Kevin.
“Stop being a bitch!” Dean exclaims, giving his brother a murderous look.
Castiel makes his way to the bar when he stops suddenly.  Behind the bar is one of the owners, Dean Winchester.  If Castiel thought he was gorgeous in his pictures, he’s so much more in person.  He has a charisma about him that is downright criminal.  Dean is handing a drink to a redheaded woman that has a pride flag in it.  Dean gives her a warm teasing smile before he goes to get a beer from the tap for a guy with a blond mullet.  Castiel takes a deep breath and walks up to the bar.
The bath turned out to be just what they needed.  They were now relaxed, cuts and scrapes tended to, and drink and food in their bellies.  They hadn't felt this human since before their father was overthrown by Azazel.  King John always felt the slimy nobleman had played a part in their mother, Queen Mary's, death. It was believed, Azazel had hoped Queen Mary's death would weaken King John.  It had but not as much as the slimy bastard had hoped.  It would take almost another twenty years to get enough support to completely overthrow King John in the coup.
Castiel said amused.
“Are you certain you are ready.  Fear is not the reason you should bind yourself to me.” Dean says pulling the omega down to sit on the edge of the fountain.
“When Lamia finishes, Dean puts the bowl in the dishwasher and grabs himself a beer.  He sits on the back porch drinking his beer and absently stroking Lamia’s head with the other.  He hopes Lamia’s owner calls him and that he is not a douchebag.  He’d really hate it if he had to give up his evenings with the yellow cat that has wormed its way into his heart.
“Yes, one of many surprises for your name day.” Dean says helping the omega into the saddle.
He decided since he was already out of his house that he would go grocery shopping in person, instead of calling for delivery.  Fall weather was setting in and the nights had been quite cool of late.  He mentally added hot chocolate to his grocery list as he pulled into the parking lot of the small neighborhood grocery.  He prefered Benny’s store for its smallness.  The larger chain stores wreaked havoc on his social anxiety.
Dean was brought out of his musings by Missouri.  “Alright it’s time for nightly chores.  Castiel and Dean, you have dish duty.  Sam and Ash, you have laundry duty.  Everyone else, go out back and help Frank bring in the plants before it frosts.  Now get to it!” the lady demanded with authority.
“Apparently under a rock.” Kevin responds blushing.
“Just take this over to the green eyed hunk and see what happens.” Gabe says, throwing the sweets into Castiel’s arms.
“Not in your life, bitch!” Dean said harshly.  His eyes flashing gold momentarily.
“Fine!  Suck all the fun out of it.” Dean pouted.
“For me?  I’ve never…” Castiel is overcome.
“Yeah.  Sure you can come with.  Make sure you wear clothes that you won’t mind destroying, good shoes, and water because it’s going to be another hot one tomorrow.” Castiel says smiling his best gummy smile.
“Fine but I’m taking my knife with me.” Dean said crossing his arms, daring Sam to argue.
An Omega’s Destiny- Chapter 2 - Day 5 - Fireman’s Carry
Sadly all things must come to a end.  This story was a surprise to come out of some random prompts.  I  hope you like the ending.  Drop me a line and let me know what you think.
××××××××××××××××
"Dean might end up more than you can handle.  He is unlikely to submit in any way.  What will you do if he challenges you in public?" Gabriel queried.
Dean’s day had started decent enough.  He’d awoken from a very hot dream in which he was having a threesome with Dr. Sexy and that hot british guy that played the Witcher on Netflix.  What’s his name?  Doesn’t matter because the guy is surly and sexy as hell.
Castiel can’t help but blush too.  This night just got even more interesting.
“Yes, I’m fine.  I was just pondering if I had enough colors among my pencils to capture the beauty of my new home.” Castiel answered giving Dean’s hand a reassuring squeeze.
Dean gave Sam a pat on the back before following the blue eyed kid with seriously messy dark brown hair.  They started their chore in silence but Dean couldn’t stand it anymore.  “So what are you in for?”
Dean was snickering as he handed Castiel a folded piece of paper.  Castiel read it and had to bite his fist to keep from laughing audibly.  “Becky would pass a stone if she realized how much this story was about sex, lust and ones sexual identity.  It gives me ideas for when we get home.”  Castiel accidently let out an audible giggle when he read the last part which attracted Ms. Bradbury’s attention.
“Awesome.  I hope there is going to be a season three.” Dean says running his hand up and down Castiel’s thigh.
“Yes.” Castiel smiled as Gabriel took his arm and led him into the great hall.  There at the head of the room stood King John with Mary at his side. Castiel only had eyes for Dean who was dressed in white trimmed in gold.  Castiel felt as though he were floating.  Before his mind caught up, Gabriel had handed him into Dean’s arms.
"Azazel is a vile alpha.  Lawrence shares a border with your kingdom.  It could be detrimental to your own kingdom, if you allow him to continue." Dean smartly added.
When Dean approaches the table he is surprised at what he finds.  The alpha is wearing an ill fitting suit, a trenchcoat and a backwards blue striped tie.  The alpha is running his fingers through his own hair harshly.  It is apparent that the alpha is nervous which Dean immediately realizes is odd for an alpha.  When the omega is finally at the alpha, Castiel jumps up, makes eye contact with the omega and then immediately averts his eyes to the floor.  The alpha also puts his hands behind his back and takes on a submissive pose.  So strange.
You will never see…
There is a fire raging in the large fireplace situated right behind King Castiel’s seat.  The older omega takes a moment to admire the ornate screens that stand in front of the grate to protect from stray embers.  The screens feature angels in flight mid battle with a slew of nasty looking demons.
“My cousin is wise and knows me too well.” Castiel revealed.  “What else did he tell you?”
I'd never ask you
Castiel can’t help but blush harder.  “I brought you some things I’ve baked.”  Castiel says, holding out his offerings.
“One episode and then you can have me anyway you want me.” Castiel proposes.
“Yes and that ass Zachariah has made all ten years hell on you.  Please Cassie.  Think about it.  I’m worried about you.” Gabriel says, putting his hand on his little brother’s shoulder.
“Let me get you another.” Dean says and Castiel nods.  Dean slides him another drink and then takes a deep breath like the extra oxygen will give him courage.  “So what brings you to my hole in the wall bar?”
Ellen picks that moment to come over, “Do you guys know what you want?”
Dean was salting and buttering the popcorn when he heard his children’s giggles and his husband’s deep laugh.  He set the huge bowl of popcorn on the wooden tray with two sodas and two enclosed cups with juice.  Dean tried to school his features into seriousness before entering the living room.
“Just a few more minutes.  I’ve almost captured them.” Castiel says, indicating his drawing.
Dean takes a deep breath and pulls the box out of his pocket.  “Baby, will you…?”  he says choking on his emotions.
“I want to see about fostering a child with the intent of adopting.” Castiel said, finally sitting on the bed in nothing but his underwear.
When they pulled through the massive gate house, the omega was very impressed and curious about the large gold W’s on the guard towers walls.
It was such a nice day.  He’d even remembered to set food and water out for Lamia.  He was a yellow striped cat that had started hanging around his place a couple of months ago.  He wasn’t a stray, Dean didn’t believe, but he hung around so much Dean felt gulited into feeding him.  He’d even bought treats and a couple of cat toys for Lamia.  Dean made sure they were hidden whenever anyone came over to his place.  He didn’t want anyone knowing what a softy he actually was.  He’d even gone to the doctor to get prescription allergy meds so he wouldn’t sneeze his head off when he spent the afternoons drinking a beer and petting Lamia.
“I plan to take more pictures of you tonight.” Castiel said, trying to sound salacious.
Dean's last thought before he allowed himself to sleep was just how handsome King Castiel was.  Also, how pleasing the alpha's scent was to him.  Most alphas' scent made Dean nauseous.  Castiel's was comforting.  Like the warm soothing aroma of home.
“No!  She’ll cut off my balls!” Gabriel yells at Castiel as he heads toward the front door.
Castiel hangs out at the bar for a little longer in order to let his buzz burn off and to soak up a few more of Dean’s smiles.  He decides not to attempt to pick anyone up for the night.  Castiel feels something, a connection maybe with Dean and he doesn’t want to jeopardize that before he can explore it.  So he goes back to his hotel room alone.
Day 19: Watching the Sunset
Day 16: Pillow Fight/ Fort
Things didn’t start going to shit until he got to his shop.  Charlie had called in sick which meant instead of working on cars, Dean was stuck in the office dealing with customers.  Dean liked owning his own shop but he preferred to be on a crawler underneath the vehicles instead of dealing with the people who actually owned them.  He also loathed computers which is why he hired his best friend, Charlie.  She made computers her bitch and people loved her.  She was quirky and original.  Dean was gruff and aggressively sarcastic which didn’t bode well for his customer service skills.
“You’re extremely hot but you don’t look too intimidating.” Dean answers with a chuckle.
“Cool.” Dean says and means it.  Castiel seems like a really good guy.  A guy that Dean would really like to get to know better.  That night Dean lies with Castiel on one side of him and Sammy on the other.  Castiel reaches out and takes Dean’s hand in his.  Dean squeezes it as the heavens hang above them.
Gabriel was up late dispatching orders for troops to double their guard on the border with Lawrence.  He also put orders out to start preparing their forces to invade Lawrence when it was time.  Castiel had been quite clear with him and the nobles at their late night meeting.  The king was smitten with Prince Dean and would stop at nothing to get Lawrence back for his intended mate.
Castiel approaches Benny cautiously.  “Hello there.  How’s it going?” Benny crows out.
Dean decided that he’d stop on the way home and have dinner with Sam at his favorite diner.  When Dean ordered a double bacon cheeseburger, Sam had immediately started in on him.  “Dean if you keep eating like this you’re going to die of a heart attack like dad.”  It was apparent that Sam regretted what he’d said immediately.  John Winchester was a subject Dean never liked being brought up.  Sam started apologizing but Dean was really not in the mood to hear any of it.  He growled and told Sam to just shut up and eat his fucking salad.  Dean spent the rest of the meal resisting the urge to pour his beer in Sam’s lap.
“Husband.  They’ve been together since they were kids.  Ketch has never actually cheated physically I don’t think but as you saw tonight he’s not as loyal as he ought to be.”
“You think I’m adorable?” Castiel whispers with hope in his tone.
Castiel had given up his apartment two months ago when he quit his job as a lawyer in the hopes of pursuing a career that would make him happier.  The alpha and omega had been spending every moment of spare time together so it made sense to move in together.  Dean was head over heels in love with his little alpha.  Castiel was a pro at wooing, in Dean’s opinion.  The alpha would bring the omega lunch to whatever school he was substituting at on a given day.  When he was working with Bobby on cars, Castiel would bring food for both Bobby and the omega.  Bobby, a normally grouchy and suspicious alpha, had already accepted Cas into the family.
“Thank you.  I can’t wait.” Castiel says as Dean climbs in Baby.  Dean nods because yeah he can’t wait as well.
“Sorry Sammy.  I don’t know what came over me.” Dean apologizes.
Dean waddled holding Claire’s hand as she toddled down the sidewalk.  She was dressed in the cutest Princess Leia costume.  Ben was in Castiel’s arms dressed as Luke Skywalker and throwing a fit.  Ben had not slept well the night before and had refused to take a nap that day.  He hadn’t adjusted as well as Claire to their new bigger house.
“It’s a warm day.” the alpha said, leading the omega toward the lake that sat at the center of the park.
“Roadhouse it is.  My baby is right over here” Dean says, leading Castiel to the beautiful black Impala.
“I didn’t.” Dean said coming into the living room holding two mugs of hot chocolate and the whole bag of marshmallows.  Castiel couldn’t help but steal a kiss and nip a little at Dean’s lips before taking his mug from Dean.
“I stand corrected.  Well Dean, who did you come with instead.” Castiel asked
“I’ve waited so long.” Castiel crumbles and Dean pulls the sobbing man into his arms.
Day 15: Didn’t Know They Were Dating
“That’s when you fell in love?” Claire quarries.  She is growing up and Dean can’t bear the idea of either of their girls growing up.
Dean was lost in how hot this guy was for a minute before he could respond, “Yeah that’s me!”
They were soon joined by a short male beta, Charlie introduced as Crowley.  This Crowley was the Royal Dresser.  He was a haughty and sarcastic man whom Dean couldn't decide if he loved or hated.   Soon they were both dressed better than they'd ever been in their entire lives.
“Good morning, Becky.” he returns in the most neutral voice he can.  He tries to keep his face passive but the urge to scowl is strong.
Ben sat down on the blanket and began eating the cheese and crackers Dean handed him.  The alpha sat next to Castiel, after checking on Claire in her bundle of pink blankets.  “How are you feeling, Sweetheart?” Dean asked, rubbing the omega’s back.
When he walked in he noticed Chuck lurking by the community bulletin board.  The short squirrely guy lived just around the corner from Dean.  He wrote a series of Sci-Fi novels that had a small cult following.  Dean also knew the man had a serious crush on Becky.  He had no clue why because he found Becky annoying and shallow.  Dean noticed there were many new things posted on the cork board that served as their communities catch all message board, he’d have to peruse them later.  Right now he was on a mission to confront Becky.
Can't bear
He pulls out of the hotel parking lot and heads to the first club on his list called The Devils Trap.  Castiel had done a little research on the place and learned it was run by a couple of brothers named Sam and Dean Winchester.  Sam was a well known attorney who was an advocate for human rights, especially those of the LBGTQIA community.  Dean owned a successful vintage car restoration business which seemed quite successful if the reviews were to be believed.  The Winchester brothers ran the club, it seemed, mostly for fun and there were many pictures on their website with them partying with the guests as well as bartending.  It looked like a fun and safe place which was important to Castiel.  Many years ago Castiel had had a bad experience at a club that didn’t take the patrons safety into account.  He’d spent a week in the hospital after that costly mistake and a year seeing a therapist.
In tonight’s class, they were  discussing Dracula by Bram Stoker.  Dean and Castiel had read it independently and Castiel had been curious when he heard Dean laughing as he read it.  Castiel hadn’t really found anything comical about it.  At the moment their teacher, Ms. Bradbury, was engaged in a heated argument with one of the other students named Becky.  Becky was a pain to all her fellow classmates.  She likes to argue constantly and claim works were inappropriate. Castiel always wondered what Becky thought the class was when she signed for it.
When King Castiel entered the grand dining hall,  all were already there and seated, waiting. They rose when the trumpets sounded, announcing the king's arrival.  All stood in respect, as the King entered, as was required of them. Prince Dean had been seated to the right of Castiel's place, as the King had requested.  Prince Samuel sat next to his older brother, back straight and proud.  Gabriel, who normally sat at Castiel's right, was moved to the left.
Becky took the flyer from his hand kind of aggressively.  “Oh dear!  I see.” Becky says once she’s looked it over.  She sticks it to the board herself.  “So, Castiel, I know in our last conversation you told me you were gay.  A man has moved in on Gollum Street.  His name is Aaron and he’s gay, single and ready to mingle.” She says bumping shoulders with Castiel.
Castiel walked over until he was nose to nose with Dean.  He stared into green eyes and saw honesty and pain there.  Before he realized what he was doing they were kissing.  It wasn’t gentle and Castiel tasted the metallic taste of blood.  Whose it was, he did not know.  He just knew he felt the pieces mending inside of him as Dean’s bright soul was healing him.  He had his soulmate back.
Dean did not look at Gabriel.  The omega kept his eyes on the alpha king.  The omega chewed his bottom lip as he seemed to be deep in thought.  Castiel thought it a sin for the omega to look so inviting or to injure such luscious kissable lips.  Prince Dean then turned to Prince Samuel who simply nodded at the older omega.
“Oh don’t be that way.  I could give you a good time.” the man says reaching a hand out in an attempt to touch Castiel.
Dean walked to the door and pulled the rope that was attached to a bell in the servants quarters.  In a matter of minutes there was a knock at the door.  "Enter." Dean called out.  In walked a petite red headed female omega servant.
Day 31: Holiday Traditions
Castiel sang his song right to Dean.  He stared him down and he didn’t waver.  He needed the man to know he’d ruined him.  No one wanted a broken man and it was Dean’s fault.  He’d broken him.
After having an excellent cup of coffee and a homemade breakfast sandwich loaded with bacon, he made his way to his baby.  She was parked in the driveway gleaming in the autumn sun.  He had just detailed her yesterday and she was waxed to perfection.  God she was beautiful.
You'd say I'm sorry believe me
“Passing notes are we?” Charlie said walking over grinning.  Ms. Bradbury, or Charlie as they knew her outside of class, knew they were together.  Charlie took the note from Castiel before he knew what was happening.
“He’s not your typical alpha Dean.  He’s shy and polite. Would I set you up with someone dangerous?” Sam said, giving Dean puppy dog eyes.
“No one.  I came stag.  I gave Gilda and Charlie a ride.  I was just about to leave, when I saw you.” Dean confesses.
Another reason he remained lonely was he didn’t make friends easily.  He was awkward and shy.  He was used to people making fun of his mannerisms and how he talked.  He retreated into the shelter of his home.  He escaped into books because they didn’t judge him.  The only friend he’d made since moving here was the man that delivered his groceries, Benny.  Benny would stay and have a drink to chat from time to time but he always had to get home to his wife.  Castiel had been invited to his house for dinner but he always declined.  Social anxiety would always criple him, it seemed.
“Maybe that’s what I want.  Maybe I want to watch you lose control.  Watch as you writh for me.  What do you say Cas?  Do you want that?” Dean asks his voice as sultry low as he can get it.  He’s brought out of his haze when a pillow whacks him in the head again.
“You know why.  Brotha after how you treated Kaia and Claire, you’re lucky Dean didn’t beat the shit out of you himself.” Benny says pushing Gordon further away from the club entrance.  “Now go home.”  Gordon does walk away muttering nasty things Castiel would rather not hear again.
Dean samples the pie. “Damn if all your stuff is this good, you definitely should, but before you do all that.  You should go on a date with me.” Dean says winking at Castiel.
“I think I’ll have the same.” Castiel says with a smile.
It was Halloween and Dean and Castiel were supposed to be attending their friend, Charlie’s Halloween party that night.  Dean was going as Wyatt Earp and Castiel was going as Doc Holiday from Tombstone.  Dean loved to dress up as a cowboy but what he loved more was seeing his hot alpha dressed as a cowboy.  Those plans might be canceled though because the omega woke up that morning throwing up.  The alpha had insisted that his omega go to the doctor immediately.  Dean had only been off his suppressants and birth control for a few months.  He’d hadn’t even had a heat yet.  Castiel was afraid it might be complications from coming off the medication.
Day 30: Fall Asleep on My Shoulder
“Well, I might have an answer to that.  Donna told me about a little girl, Emma.  She is seven years old and was abandoned by her mother.  Donna thinks she was neglected because she won’t talk much about her mother.  I told Donna I would talk to you about it. I was going to wait until tomorrow to bring it up since we had so much going on today.” Castiel confesses.
Dean feels a desire for his husband light up his nerves.  “Enough talking.  We need to watch the movie before your bedtime.” Dean says, stealing a chaste kiss with Castiel.
When the door to their chambers was closed and they were alone, they finally broke their silence. "Do you think we are safe here?"  Sam asked his older brother.
The alpha just smiled and then asked, “Would it be okay if I held your hand?”
“I’ve always wanted a black mare.” Dean replies honestly.
“I know what I said.  It was stupid.  I was listening to my dad and his bullshit.  I tried to find you the next week but you were gone.  Your phone was disconnected and no one would tell me where you’d gone.  I convinced myself that I didn’t deserve you, that you were better off without me but after seeing you tonight.  Fuck Cas, I want you so bad but you’re with someone.” Dean said forlorn.
“I’m sorry.  I love you.” Dean murmurs over and over into Castiel’s ear.
“Now, omega mine, Charlie is a female omega that prefers other female omegas.  She is like a sister to me.  She’ll love you as I already do.” Dean said, smiling at his future mate.
“Damn right we will.” Dean said walking over and pulling Castiel up from the couch.  “Shall we get an early start.”
Dean nervously rubs the back of his neck, “Well ummm….”  Dean doesn’t know how to respond.  They’re standing in the middle of a graveyard and this is starting to feel inappropriate.
They watch Princess and the Frog at Emma’s insistence.  Both girls are fast asleep by the time the credits roll.  Castiel carries Emma while Dean trails behind with Claire.  With the girls both tucked in, Dean and Castiel return to the livingroom to continue movie night.  Dean grabs two beers and makes a fresh bowl of popcorn.  When Dean gets to the living room he finds Castiel has straightened the pillow fort so they can lay together.
It just had to be today of all days that Charlie came down with the stomach flu.  Today Crowley was coming to pick up his Mustang.  The guy was a rich asshole who flirted with Dean constantly even though he had made it quite clear that he had no interest in the prick.  Dean would rather go straight to hell than let that hoity toity bastard touch him.
“Hmm… are you buttering me up?” Dean playfully asks.
“Fine.  Don’t burn down my kitchen while I’m gone and stay off my computer.  If I get another virus because you’re watching porn on it, I’m going to tell Rowena about your habits.” Castiel threatens.
“I’m sorry Dean but I’d really like to leave now.”
Castiel's POV
"King Castiel has been generous." Sam replied.
“That I did.  I ended up fixing it myself.” Dean says, as he hands their daughters their drinks.  “Be careful not to spill.” Dean warns.
“Gabe, he's probably straight.  Why are you torturing me with this now?”
I love you
“Since no one was hurt, it is funny.  What did Gabriel do?” Dean always found the short beta, who taught many of Castiel’s culinary classes,  entertaining.
“I’m so proud of you.” Castiel said with unshed tears in his eyes.  “I love you.”
Castiel finally turned to face his old lover.  “Turn you what?” Castiel asked incredulously.
“Your dad is a dick.” Castiel says giving Dean a small smile.
~Halloween~
The omega chuckled at his alpha.  “You’re home early?”
There is a collective groan of displeasure from all of his students.  Castiel has to suppress his grin, so he doesn’t start a riot among his students.  Castiel hears his bedroom door open and he prepares himself for what is about to happen.
The end of September, Jack came to live with them as a foster child.  It took a year but the following September the adoption of Jack became final.  Two years later, a fourteen year old girl named Claire came to them as a foster child.  Her father had passed away when she was younger and her mother had disappeared after leaving her in the care of a grandmother.  When the grandmother died she was put into the foster care system.  It was Donna that approached Dean and Castiel about her.
“He’s an alpha and you know what they are like.” Dean says to push Sam.  Sam might have been a beta but he’d had quite a few alpha’s screw him over in the past.
When they returned from their trip, Castiel was starting a job waiting tables at the Roadhouse.  Ellen, the owner, was a friend of Bobby’s.  Dean was going to be working there part time on the grill after working at Bobby’s shop.  They hoped to save enough money after a while to afford a place together.  It was going to be hard but they were certain they could do it together.
“I like how you think.  I accept.” Dean says.  They end up dancing together until the reception ends.
“You were the only offspring of the king.  Are you telling me you were forsaken for others who were of lower birth?” Castiel asks, seeming appalled at the idea of it.
“I’m with you forever.” Castiel whispered before they pulled away from each other.
“The hell there isn’t!” Dean yelled slamming his hand with the paper in it down on her desk.  “I’m tired of coming home to find one of these whenever you’re bored or are pining for my brother.  Chuck has a major crush on you, so why don’t you stalk him and leave me and my brother the fuck alone!”  Dean says all of a sudden feeling utterly exhausted.
“Straight.  Fuck Cas.  I never thought I ever see you again.”  Dean said with an emotion Castiel’s brain wouldn’t let him compute.  Was that longing and sorrow.  No couldn’t be.
“My name is Castiel, I’m one of Eileen’s coworkers.” the gorgeous man said as he shook Dean’s hand.
“This is only the beginning, Dean.  One day I want to own a house with you.  A house we’ll grow old together in.  One day I want to adopt a kid or two who are like us, lost and wayward and needing a family.” Castiel confesses.
Dean picks the omega up from the bed in a proper bridal carry.  Bobby made him practice after he carried Castiel into the great hall on his back when they first arrived.  Dean set the omega down next to the already filled tub.  Charlie must have had it ready just before Castiel awoke.  Dean turns his back as his omega disrobes.  Castiel calls to Dean when he is in the suddy perfumed water.  The alpha washes the omegas hair and back with delicate care.  Dean turns his back again, as his omega dresses.
“Are your accommodations to your liking?  Is there anything you need?” Castiel implores.
When Dean awoke the sun was almost at its zenith.  He’d never been this slothful.  He supposed it had a great deal to do with the fact that he felt safe.  He was confident that Castiel would never allow anything to happen to him if it was within his power.  Castiel was everything an alpha ought to be.  Dean didn’t dare voice any of these thoughts out loud.  He was afraid if he did, it would all come crumbling down around him.  Sam was going to be taken care of and allowed to follow his dreams.  Dean was going to have a mate that cherished him.  It was right out of a fairytale.  Dean had to keep reminding himself that fairy tales aren't true. Real life was harsh and cruel with alphas like Azazel in it.
“You need to relax.  Here, breath with me.” Sam insisted as he started demonstrating a breathing technique he had learned in yoga.  Dean had attended one class with Sam.  He’d ended up dating the instructor, Lisa for a while.  She had dumped him for a doctor which Dean was okay with because he wasn’t in love with her.  He did miss hanging out with her son Ben though.
“Nervous, anxious, nauseous.” Castiel answers motioning for the alpha to take a seat.
“She was a judgemental and self-righteous bitch who told me at a tender age that I came off the line with a crack in my chassis.  When I came out as gay at sixteen she tried to send me to one of those camps that claims you can pray the gay away.  My parents were separated and when my father Chuck found out he sued for custody.  He won and after that I avoided her whenever possible.” Castiel says ending with a sigh.
“What was it about?” Dean says as he takes the omega’s hand.  They walk toward the fountain in silence for a moment.
Castiel started his job as a high school history teacher that August.  The kids, parents and faculty immediately embraced him as family.  Jody Mills, the principal, and her wife Donna, the sheriff, became close friends with both Castiel and Dean.  It was awesome to be accepted for who they were.  Dean however didn’t like the vice principal much.  Fergus Crowley had flirted with Castiel and even made blunt suggestions that Cas dump Dean and date him.  It had taken a great deal of effort to keep Dean from hunting Crowley down and beating his ass.
“Dean I… do you…” Castiel says as his confused expression grows.
It is apparent Castiel doesn't catch what Dean says.  He is distracted by Dean hands on his flesh.  When Dean’s hand goes up his shirt,  Castiel grabs a pillow and wacks Dean with it.  “Stop or we will end up not watching anything.” Castiel warns.
“Excuse me.” Castiel responds giving the man his best smitey face.
“No, not about us.  Now me assigning multiple works of Poe, yes.” Castiel says grinning.
Dean decided to wear a pair of his comfortable worn jeans, a grey henley topped with a red flannel shirt.  He left his normal work boots at home and wore a pair of athletic shoes he bought years ago when Sam had talked him into running with him for a while.  That had been the worst two weeks of the omega’s life.  He hated running.
“How did the wedding breakfast go?” Dean asked as he took a pull of his beer.  Castiel works for a fancy restaurant now that he has completed all his culinary classes.
Chapter 4
This was how Castiel would spend everyday, in Dean’s arms making out, if he could.  “Jo has been asking about Sam again. I told her I didn’t know when Sam was coming to visit here again.” Castiel said as he kissed Dean’s fingers and occasionally licked them.
I'm such a fool
“Much better.  I think the fresh air is just what I needed.” Castiel says giving Dean a chaste kiss on the lips.
“Well… well… I think King Castiel is not the only one feeling possessive.” Bobby chuckles as he exits the apartments to stand guard at the door.
“Are you having any second thoughts?” Sam says in a joking manner.
“I feel the same, Cas.  The only thing I like more than a good burger is an excellent piece of pie.”
“I don’t have anywhere else to go.  My mom threw me out when she found out I was gay.  I broke into an empty house for shelter.  Garth picked me up and brought me here.  I’ll be eighteen in nine months.  Missouri is helping me get my GED.  Hopefully I can get a scholarship to a community college.” Castiel says, never looking up from his work.
“Then I’ll pick you up at 9am.” Castiel counters.
“Sam, why do I have to do this again?” Dean whined as he put on his best pair of jeans and a green button up shirt in his bathroom.
The omega chuckles because he can picture his alpha being that way.  He sits up and Charlie puts his breakfast tray on the bed.  “I don’t think I can eat.  My stomach feels like it has an army of butterflies in it.” the omega confesses.
They spend the whole night talking and being honest with each other.  As the sun rises, they graduate to soft kisses and gentle words.  Not all is forgiven but they are on the right road now.
Thankfully the ceremony ended and Dean made his way to Bobby, Sam and Castiel who were waiting in the crowd.  “I’m proud of you boy.” Bobby said, patting Dean’s shoulder.
Dean is speechless but Sam is not.  “Thank you, sire.  I’m excited and thankful to you for this opportunity.”
That June, Bobby announced he was retiring and giving his business to Dean.  Dean was at first overwhelmed with the idea of being a business owner but he became a natural.  Castiel was so proud.  They bought a three bedroom two bathroom house in July and were settled in by the time school started back.
Castiel tries really hard not to broadcast that he’s been a victim of homophobic violence in the past but he loses the battle more often then not.  Benny also strikes Castiel as an intuitive person, so he probably couldn’t hide no matter what.  “Thanks Benny.  I think my first stop will be the bar for something to settle my nerves.”
“I know but the sleeping mind is not as easy to convince.” Castiel confides.
It was his last class of the day and thankfully it was Friday.  They were discussing Edgar Allen Poe’s short story, The Black Cat.  Castiel decided since it was October, a selection of Poe’s creepier works would be appropriate. Some of his students however were finding these assignments difficult.
"How are you supposed to do that?  We only have the clothes on our backs." Sam asked.
“Oh we are celebrating but I want to have a little fun too.”
He has been thinking about mating Dean soon.  He finds it harder and harder to resist intimacies with the alpha.  The people of Lawrence love him and he loves the people.  King John and Mary are just as attentive as his intended alpha is.  He just needs to find a way to bring it up.  He is shy and it is hard to find a way to initiate the conversation.  By courting rules, the omega must be the one to propose it.
Eileen was the beta daughter of one of the country gentry.  She had been deaf since she was an enfant.  Luckily she was low enough that she would go unnoticed by Azazel’s goons.  Sam had been sweet on her for a few years.  “Don’t write our location.  You need to be as general as possible just in case the letter is intercepted.” Dean reminds Sam.
I am extremely exhausted today.  If there are any glaring mistakes in this, I apologize.
“I’m getting my gun to shoot that winged rat.  The little fucker shit all over Baby.  It ain’t right Sammy.  Baby’s a lady.” Dean argued.
“You’ve got this Cas.  I will be lucky to pass.” Dean says, throwing his arm over his eyes to avoid his best friend’s piercing blue gaze.
Castiel placed his hand on Dean’s belly, “Let’s just concentrate on this for now.” the alpha sounded awed.
The stone was plain with no embellishments or epitaphs.  Dean was startled when he looked up and found deep blue eyes staring at him curiously.  “I’m sorry, man.  I didn’t mean to intrude.  My curiosity just got the better of me.”
"I know that Dean but is Castiel just as dangerous?  I mean, you're going to mate him." Sam clarified.
Castiel smiles.  “You are most welcome.” the king says looking at Sam before turning back to Dean.  “Dean, do you ride?”
Castiel remembers his vow of truthfulness to his alpha.  “I had a nightmare and I thought a walk might help me settle.”
Dean answered by taking the cooler from Castiel and then entwining his fingers with the now free hand of the alpha.  “Your hands are warm.” Dean said blushing again.
“Yes you can little alpha.  This is great.” the omega said, before chowing down on the food his alpha had thoughtfully made for him.
Day 26: Blind Date
“She’s not anything to me.  She’s been trying to turn me for a while but I’ve made it clear to Lisa that she’s fooling herself.”  Dean growled from behind him.
“I never want to sub for the gym teacher again.  Thank you for this.” Dean said as he placed his feet in the hot water.
“Don’t be.  I’m going to have Gabriel begin looking for a suitable horse for you.  Is there anything you would prefer?” the king asks.
“So, Dean, I didn’t see you come with anyone?” Castiel asks, also watching the dance floor.
“No but someone might.” Dean says teasingly.
“Dean, my love, I need your help.  I’m having trouble getting the topper level.” Castiel pleads.
Dean and Castiel had just cut the cake and were now covered in it.  Dean had started the cake fight and Castiel had finished it.  When Dean kissed his new husband, he licked the remains of the cake off Castiel’s chin.  Dean now had his forever and he had blue eyes, a beautiful heart, and a badass attitude when necessary.  That night Dean slow danced with his husband for hours.  Sometimes you have to wait and let love find you.
But not in that way”
Day Four - Doodles/Doodling
“Do I not look the part?” Castiel says, taking the chair next Dean.
“I’ll never get enough of you Cas.” Dean says, before pulling his husband into a kiss.
“You’re gorgeous.” Castiel whispers in Dean’s ear.
“We were only omegas and of little importance.  we were forbidden to be educated beyond the minimal.  We were to be seen and not heard.” Dean responds sounding forlorn.  The older omega was always yearning for the attention and acceptance of his alpha father.  He never got it.
“Yes, I agree.  We shouldn’t stay much longer.  It’s growing chilly.” Dean says tucking a soft blanket around Castiel’s shoulders.
“Alright, Little Alpha.” Dean said, placing his hand over the alpha’s.
“Isn’t it a lovely morning.  Haven’t seen you in quite some time.  Are you enjoying our little community?  Have you made any friends?” Becky questions without much pause for breath.
By the time Castiel was sliding into his jeep and heading toward the hotel, the sun was close to setting.  He’d checked into the hotel the night before and he was glad.  He was so hot and tired that dragging his suitcase in did not sound appealing.  As soon as he is behind the closed door of his room, he immediately strips out of his sweaty, dirty clothes that are possibly harboring spiders from the abandoned house he’d been exploring and jumps in the shower.  In a half an hour Castiel is dressed in tight denim jeans, a tight black Zeppelin shirt and headed to his jeep.  His carefully applied black eye liner is making his blue eyes pop as he idly plays with his silver hoop lip ring with his tongue.  He’d left his hair in its naturally ‘just fucked’ state and had changed out his clear ear plugs in favor of his metallic black ones.  He takes one last glance at himself in the rearview mirror of his jeep and declares it good enough.
One more chapter to come.
Castiel steps over a fairly large hole in the floor of the abandoned house, carefully, while trying to hold his camera as steady as possible.  When he returns home to upload his footage to his computer, he will dub his narration of what is being shown on the video.  It has been Castiel’s experience that capturing his voice audibly in the field is beyond tricky.  There is always background noise that will drown him out and make what he’s saying indecipherable.  Also, if Castiel was, say, exploring a building without consent, talking loud enough to be picked up on camera could also get him caught and arrested.  Today though, Castiel has full permission to be here by the owner.
There were gasps and whispers from the assembled nobles. They were probably upset that they would no longer be able to thrust their omegas at him hoping for favors.
The first thing the king noticed was what an excellent job Crowley had done dressing his intended and his brother.  The Royal Dresser had picked clothing for them in the latest and most opulent style.  He'd also chosen colors that brought out their eyes and complemented their skin tone.  Dean was such a beautiful omega that he barely noticed anything else in the room.
“Will you be my boyfriend Cas?  Go to prom with me?  Will you have the whole cliche package with me?” Dean says finding courage he never had before.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s going to be fine Cas.” Dean said, pulling the slightly older boy into his arms.  “We’re going to go on dates.  Get to know each other.  You’re going to go to college and be so smart.  I’m going to learn to work on cars with Bobby.  Who knows, maybe one day we can get a place together.” Dean gave words to his dream.
By the time he arrived home, it looked like a rain storm was brewing.  When he saw his kitchen window open, he sighed.  Bumblebee was off on another adventure.  Castiel just hoped he’d be okay in the coming weather and return home to him.
“What did you wish Cas?” Dean said, so very curious.
An Omega’s Destiny
Can't face the truth
“I think I know just the place.  My brother owns a diner called Loki’s Burgers not too far from her.  Follow me handsome.” Castiel says, indicating an atrocious gold colored pimpmobile.
After a few turns in the garden, Dean leads the omega back to his bed.  When the omega closes his eyes, he dreams of sitting at a table with Dean.  The table is covered in Hyacinths and Ivy.  He feels safe and loved when he wakes in the morning and is ready to approach King John and tell him he’s ready to mate his Beloved Alpha.
Castiel grinned picturing such a scenario.  "At least court will no longer be boring for me."
“Cas, can’t you sit down and just talk to me?” Dean pleads.
“Poor Jo.  I think she has a crush on Sam.” Castiel said, pulling the blanket snugger around them.  The temperature really was dropping.
Ketch bows his head seemingly contrite as Dean calls a ride for the inebriated man.  Once Ketch is gone and Dean has caught up on his drink orders, he comes back to talk to Cas.  “Sorry about Ketch.  He’s a jerk whether he drunk or sober.  I don’t know how Mick puts up with him.”
“Forever isn’t long enough with you Cas.  It’ll never be enough.” Dean said, capturing Castiel’s lips in a kiss.
“My boss is setting me up to get fired.  My brother thinks I should quit and do something I love.  It’s a hard decision.  I’ve worked for the same company for ten years but things have become untenable there.” Castiel confides in Dean.
~ Christmas Eve~
As he approaches Dean’s door, yes he knows his name, he takes a deep breath to settle his nerves.  They met once a few months ago.  Castiel was so flustered he barely managed to properly introduce himself.  Dean probably thinks he is a blubbering idiot.  He knocks and waits.
“It was my birthday.  You always come over, we have pizza and watch movies.  You didn’t even call.  It was three days after that before I heard from you again.  It stung when the first thing you text me after forgetting my birthday is, ‘Can you watch Ben so Lisa and I can go to a concert.’  I should have listened to Anna.  I thought she was being an overprotective sister.  She said you were just using me.  I don’t know why the fuck I’m even here.” Castiel makes an effort to go for the door but Dean jumps in front of him.
“Yes.  She is very nice and she promised me the best burger.  Burgers make me very happy.” the alpha says finally lifting his head slightly to look at the omega.
*** One Year Later ***
“I know.  What little detail I include, will be in code.  No worries Dean.  I’m not a kid anymore.” Sam complained.
Castiel only has to think for a moment.  “Yes, alpha.” Castiel responds.
Stood Up
Finally Dean ignores Mr. and Mrs. Awkward to glance at the board with mild interest.  He’s considering making a speedy exit to Baby, when a flyer catches his interest.  Across the top in bold black letters is “DO YOU FEED THIS CAT?”  Right below are three pictures of Lamia.  It continues below the pictures with, “Could you stop feeding him please?  I thank you for your generosity, but unfortunately he’s getting a bit fat and being sick more often.  He’s very good at acting deprived and malnourished, but I can assure you he’s getting 3 square meals a day at home, more than the recommended daily allowance of treats, and on top of that he keeps the neighborhood rodent population down. He’s got a very sensitive stomach and is being sick a lot.  I would really appreciate it if you would stop feeding him.”  Dean’s  fighting the urge to laugh but there was still more.
“Yes.  Who told you where I was?” Castiel asked with increased suspicion.
Bobby fixed Dean with a stern look.  "Boy are you sure you want to mate this king?  I mean he's lavished you with expensive things but will that make you happy in the long run?"
“Yeah.  That sounds awesome Cas. With Sam going off to college next year, it might be nice to have someone to take care of.” Dean said, sounding sad.
"Yes we are in Lawrence, my omega.  However we are the House of Winchester.  We take great pride in our family name.”  Dean explained as he pulled up his sleeve revealing a tattoo of a crown with a W fashioned into its design on the alpha’s wrist.
“As long as you plan to join me.” Dean said sashaying away.
“I won't, it's just…” Castiel trailed off looking lost.  Castiel’s mom had really done a number on him.  She basically threw him away like trash.  Castiel feared Dean was going to do the same.
“Because you are special and there is someone equally special out there for you.  I know it.” Castiel said, hugging Sam.
“Of course man.  I love a good greasy cheeseburger but I have to have a good piece of pie too.” Dean counters.
You will never know that feeling
Ivy = Fidelity
“I’d love that.” Castiel says helping himself to a chocolate chip cookie.
“That’s normal.  This is one of the biggest days of your life.  Don’t worry.  The family will visit you one by one over the morning.  They are charged with answering your questions and setting you at ease. Let them.”  Charlie encourages.
“Sounds nice.  I would love to.”  Dean says graciously.
Day 14: “I love you.” During an Argument
Castiel returned to his throne and then spoke loud enough for all to hear, "I will grant these princes asylum in my kingdom with one condition.  The oldest, Prince…?"  Castiel looked at Gabriel for the name.
“Yes Cas.  Let’s go out and have some fun and get to know each other.” Dean says more seriously.
A blond female omega speaks then, “Then you carry him in your arms, not across your back.  I am sorry Castiel, my son’s manners are sometimes fleeting.  Are you hurt?”
Day Six: Silly Traditions
(See the end of the chapter for
“Pay no attention to them.  They are just distracted by your beauty and strength.  As am I.  You need not address me so formally either.  I long to hear you say my given name, my Dean.”  King Castiel said smiling warmly at the omega.
“Sam, sometimes I doubt we are actually related.” Dean said, giving up on retrieving his gun.
Day 8: Fireworks
Castiel sat next to his friend and business partner, Balthazar and tried to shake the melancholy that had fallen over him.  He was back in Lawrence, Kansas for the first time in over a decade.  Why was he here? Oh yes, Balthazar had insisted they come to his friend, Crowley’s new club and look at some property in the area.  They were in the business of buying, remodeling and reselling property both commercial and residential.  Balthazar was the designer and Castiel was the numbers guy.  He also had the arduous chore of keeping Balthazar on task.  It was exhausting.
“I suppose I could do that.” Becky responded, narrowing her eyes at Dean.  She kind of looked insane but she always looked like that he guessed.
“I remember when she threatened you when she thought you had forgotten my birthday.  I’ve never seen you so pale.” Castiel giggled at the memory.
When Castiel slides into the car, Dean pulls him over thigh to thigh to him with his arm around him.  That night was just the first date of many for Castiel and Dean.
“What does the moose say about me?” Dean wonders aloud.
"You will be my king consort.  I see that as grounds to raise a force to take the kingdom of Lawrence back in your name.  It is rightfully yours and will be again one day if I have my way." Castiel declared for all to hear.
Dean can tell Castiel wants to say something but the alpha just looks down at the table and blushes.
“Yeah they are a local group of paranormal investigators.  Bunch of punks if you ask me.  The sheriff, Jody’s had to arrest them for trespassing quite a few times.  They’ve been really wanting in that house, among others.  They say the man who last lived there back in the day, committed suicide on his birthday.” Dean says leaning on the bar toward Castiel and whispering like it’s a big secret.
“No.  It’s awesome actually.  Thought you were hot but taken and straight.  Now, I want to ask if you’d be willing to accompany me to dinner.  It’s my break right now.  I’m Dean by the way.” Dean says giving his best flirty smile.
“I got really drunk once after fighting with my alpha mother.  I was so sick afterwards that I’ve never been able to stomach the idea of drinking alcohol again.” Castiel confided.
“They are not actually stars, Dean?” Castiel countered.
“Yes.  We are going to drink and dance to our hearts' content.  Then we are going to walk up to our room, so I can have my way with you.”
“So you don’t mind if I drink?” Dean said, holding up the beer.
“Yes and you must be Castiel.” Dean says observing the alpha’s very unalpha like behavior.
“Hey Cas.” Dean called to him.  Castiel must be getting hypothermia and hallucinating.  “Cas!” well maybe he wasn’t because Dean was making his way over to him. “Cas the dick is not coming.” Dean said when Castiel finally allowed himself to make eye contact with Dean.
When he parked Baby in the parking lot of the park, he found Castiel waiting for him holding a picnic basket, a small cooler and a blanket. “I’m so glad you came.” the alpha said in greeting.
"Unlikely.  I have my nobles on a short leash.  Having a strong mate, I think, can only benefit me.  Let's see how tonight goes and then go from there.  Calm yourself.  If your antics haven't ruined me, nothing will." the king said with a smirk.
“Not one.  I almost lost him and now he’s agreed to be mine forever.  I am going to walk down that aisle and pledge myself to Castiel.  He’s the best person for me.  I’ll spend the rest of my days happy with him.” Dean says straightening his bow tie.
He’d already placed the flowers he’d brought for his mother.  The wind was high and was already blowing them about threatening to pull them up from where they were stuck in the ground.  Dean bent down and shoved them deeper into the moist ground.  Dean stepped over to his father’s grave and stuck the little American flag he had brought a little deeper as well.  He felt bad just bringing something for his mother but his father wasn’t the flowers sort of guy so he settled on a flag.  His father had been a marine so it made sense.
“Yes, I do.” Castiel said, holding back tears of joy and hope.
When it's so hard for me
There was so much food and drink.  Castiel was congratulated by so many he hardly had a moment to speak with Dean.
Dean felt a little mischievous all of a sudden and started tickling Castiel sides. Castiel started giggling and fighting Dean to stop.  “What’s the matter Cas?” Dean said grinning like an idiot.
So this is the final chapter of this story.  I'm trying to tie up as many of the loose ends as possible.  Thanks for following along.
“Language!” Gabriel admonishes which is comical.  Gabriel once went on a five minute tirade in front of a group of visiting dignitaries that had much more colorful and vile language.
“I don’t see why you’d care or notice.” Castiel fires back, staring Dean down harshly.
“What the hell do you think you are doing Dean?”
“Then it is my duty to help you clean up, if you permit it.” Dean says, looking hopeful.
“I know.  We’ve just always been together.  It’s hard to think that soon, I can’t just jump in the car and see him in five minutes.” Dean said in defense.
“Ellen wasn’t having any trouble and I had to hustle just to keep up with her.” Castiel complained.
“I don’t recall inviting you in.” Castiel says with no heat.  Wouldn’t do him any good.  Gabriel will pay no mind and go on annoying Castiel until the end of time.
"No.  I just find it unappetizing when my food can look upon me.  We do not serve meat in my kingdom with the head attached, not even fish.  Sorry my former kingdom." Dean corrected himself.
I love you
“No that is not the problem.  I am openly and completely gay.  Anna wanted me to pretend that I wasn’t so she could further her relationship with her boyfriend.  I told her that what she asked me was horrible and insensitive.  She thinks she should always get her way.  It’s father’s fault that she is spoiled.”
Dean drives his baby to the Roadhouse.  Ellen the owner is a family friend and will be there if Dean needs backup.  When he walks in, Ellen points to a table in the corner with a grin which Dean finds disconcerting.  Ellen isn’t a smiler.
Castiel nodded and smiled at the king, “Thank you, Sire”
Gabriel knew they had the resources to pull it off.  He was just worried that there might be unforeseen circumstances for these actions.  They needed to be prepared for whatever came their way.
I love you but not in that way
“She met someone else and dumped me for him.  His name is Brady and his family is rich.” Sam looked on the verge of tears.  Dean didn’t know what to do.
“Love you too, my angel.”
“It was your Uncle Sam that suggested we go on a date. After that night your daddy had my heart.” Castiel says, making loving eyes at Dean.
They spent that night watching the sunset and then under a blanket of stars holding each other close.  Tomorrow would come but they would find their way back to each other.
“I want to go off my suppressants and birth control.” Dean said quickly before he lost his courage.
“Well next time call me.  I’ll help.” Dean countered as he bent down to kiss Castiel’s shoulder.
But not in that way
“I have news that I hope you’ll like.”  Castiel pauses looking into Dean’s eyes for a moment. “Ellen’s stepson, Ash, managed to get back into MIT after he was expelled.  He’s going to be moving out of the little one bedroom house, behind the roadhouse.  Ellen is offering it to us for free as long as one of us works for her.” Castiel says looking nervous.
Dean led the omega through the door of their new bedchamber.  Candles were lit on every surface.  A fire was roaring in the hearth and the smell of hyacinth was in the air.  The alpha led Castiel over to the bed where they undressed each other slowly.
The garden is beautiful and expansive.  Dean had only seen glimpses but he was overwhelmed by their grandeur and size now.  Castiel is waiting just inside a hedge on a white bench.  When Dean approaches he goes to bow to the king but Castiel jumps up, taking the omega’s hand.  “None of that, my Dean.  You are my equal and you will never bow to me.  Please walk with me and tell me about your day.” Castiel insists with a smile.
“Balthazar is a player.  He’s probably off somewhere having an orgy.  He’s not good enough for you.” Dean preaches.
“You’re right.  We better get going because I promised Missouri we’d pick her up on the way.” Dean said, grabbing his wallet and keys.
Castiel ate on the sofa, using his rickety folding table.  He had a beautiful dining room table but setting at it all alone just made him feel depressed.  Bumblebee finally joined him, sitting in his lap purring.  Castiel soon became so drowsy, the documentary Chasing Coral, could not hold his interest anymore.  He put his dishes in the dishwasher and went through his routine to get ready for bed.
Castiel was now taking culinary classes at the community college with Dean’s encouragement.  When the omega found out how much the alpha enjoyed cooking, he knew it would be a good career choice for the alpha.  The alpha was also looking at getting a starter beehive for Dean’s backyard also with the omega’s encouragement.
Castiel gathered his pencils and paper and tucked them under his arm.  He was slowly making his way down the wall when a large strong hand landed on his back.
When Castiel entered the store, Benny smiled and waved at him. By the end of his visit, he had a full cart of groceries.  He’d added the ingredients to make chilli, apple pie, and homemade bread.  He also added more treats for Bumblebee, even though he had plenty at home.
Castiel stared out the window into his backyard.  The bees were buzzing around his newly planted roses.  He wished he could go outside and enjoy it first hand but his newest novel wasn’t going to write itself.  He loved writing but some days he just wanted to set fire to his laptop and run away.
Castiel simply nodded.  He was about to meet the people that were going to be his new family.  There was definitely plenty else more pressing to worry about.  Castiel could see the servants lined up waiting for them.  The family would be in the great hall waiting for them since the weather had turned damp and chill.
Dean was so worn out he let Castiel handle it.  The alpha was so good with the pups anyway.  Dean was due with their second set of twin pups in early January.  Dean smiled and wondered if they would have New Year’s pups.
Today Dean was graduating from high school.  This was an accomplishment Dean never thought he’d get the chance to have. He wouldn’t have if Castiel hadn’t helped Dean study every weekend and Sam cheered him on during the week and helped with what he could.  Castiel had finished his freshman year at community college and was taking the summer off from school.  The next two weeks Castiel and Dean were going on a road trip together in celebration.
You'd say I'm sorry
“And I hate to say I love you
There is a minute of silence before Kevin yells out, “I didn’t know they were dating!”
Dean sat on their used but decently comfortable couch.  Castiel grabbed his huge fluffy blanket with bees on it.  It had been a birthday gift from Dean.  They cuddled on the couch with Castiel's back to Dean’s chest.  The blanket wrapped snug around them.  Dean pushed play on the movie but they ended up hardly watching it.  They drank their hot chocolate and fed each other marshmallows in between kisses.
"Have I spoken out of turn?" Dean asked with not a bit of guilt.  Castiel found that intriguing and attractive.
“Things change.  Weddings get canceled.” she said smiling again.
"Dean…" Sam said, guilt all over his face.
You don't want me
Castiel feels freedom and love in his grasp.  He embraces the alpha.  He can’t wait to get to Lawrence and start his new life with his mate.
“Well if that was her reason, then she’s not worth it.  You’ll find someone better.” Castiel said in an attempt to sooth Sam.  Dean was grateful that his boyfriend knew the right thing to say.
“Yes I… please… would you like to sit down?” Castiel gestures at the opposite side of the small table.
Castiel took a moment to register what Dean had just admitted.  “Did you want to ask me?  Is that what you’re saying?”
Dean is riding on the ferris wheels with his beloved Cas.  It’s their two year anniversary.  Dean now runs Bobby’s shop.  Uncle Bobby signed the shop over to Dean when he retired six months ago.  Dean makes a good living now.  Castiel is working on his masters.  Sam is a senior in high school and applying to colleges.  Castiel is certain he’ll get a full ride to the college of his choice.
“I can be sneaky.” Castiel said with uncertainty.
An Omega’s Destiny
It wasn’t until Dean’s thirtieth birthday that anyone heard anything about John.  Dean received a letter from a woman named Kate Milligan.  John Winchester had died after a car accident.  Dean learned they had a brother named Adam.  John had apparently abandoned them as well when Adam was four. John was apparently destitute for the last five years of his life.
Castiel glances in the direction Gordon went, just making sure he’s actually gone.  “Okay I think.” Castiel says trying to hide the fear he feels.  He then notices Benny’s t-shirt says ‘The Devils Trap Security.’  It makes him feel a little better.
“Why do you guys have different last names?” Ash asks as he takes a sip of soda.
After helping with the topper, Dean sits down to a cup of coffee while Castiel has his usual tea.  “Are we getting a hotel room at the venue for Charlie’s wedding.”
Dean simply nods.  In walks an older alpha lady with kind and bright eyes.  “Prince Dean…. Prince Sam… King Castiel has sent me to help and advise you on your education.  Sweetie you look a little scared.” Sir Mosely says looking at Dean.
