He tries to calculate how long it’ll take for Mycroft to hunt him down. Will he wait until tonight, or will the ignescent need to explain himself win out sooner? Sherlock’s money is on sooner. Mycroft’s likely to pay him a visit today while John’s at work.
John lets go of his hand. He says, “I’ll make dinner, too. Get up in a bit, if you can?”
Mycroft occasionally thinks back to those first weeks. When everything was a haze of missed sleep, and pain and misery. When he, deep down, was doubting that he could ever be a loving parent. Or a good one.
“You’ve never poked anyone then, Irene?” Jim eyes her. He is smiling, but there is something sharp behind it.
“Yes, yeah, they’re saying so.” John sounds distant. He seems much more affected that Mycroft himself is, nearly unable to speak.
And Sherlock grins.
Sherlock does. He feels nauseous. His entire body is shaking.
Then, a case of a gun stolen in Manchester, which was used in hold-ups in several restaurants in London. Turns out it wasn’t stolen at all, but supplied, and they weren’t hold-ups as much as a way to enforce some drug connections.
It feels right, to come home. Every single time.
John’s not sure he’s the best of volunteers, though.
But it doesn’t work. John looks at him disbelievingly. “Sherlock, you haven’t taken a case without me since Moriarty.”
He returns to his work. He focuses on his client, who tells him about being an art school teacher for most of her life. While Sherlock listens, he works on the colours and making them appear as true to the painting as possible. His work needs to capture the vivid passion of Van Gogh, and Sherlock attempts to portray the deep, almost illusive insanity of emotion his every brushstroke carries.
Sherlock has been around for the NICU stay, and he knows how to feed William, how to hold him, and bathe him. He knows when his temperature feels off, what his breathing is like, how much he sleeps, what each cry sounds like. He doesn’t have to hesitate in taking him, or ask permission from anyone. William is
Mycroft seems a bit surprised by it, but he nods thoughtfully.
Mycroft asks with a small, teasing smile on his lips, “Urgent, is it?”
A week later, a test confirms what Mycroft already suspected. He is not pregnant.
Mycroft limits himself to two hours of work at a time.
“Is there something I can do for you, John?”
He looks so goddamn good. Not hard anymore but that’s probably the nerves, and yeah, John can see it in his face, Sherlock’s
“Why’d you take the girl, then?” John tries to grin. “Besides to talk about men?”
him. Sherlock knows that that not necessarily means the same thing to John as it does to him - why would it? But it means something, and he holds on to that.
John has tattooed on pig skin before, when he just started out. On oranges as well. Melons, once. But really, tattooing on himself was easier, or on anyone else willing. Mike’s got a tattoo of John’s, and Mary has several. Like John, she’s nearly completely covered.
It’s difficult to walk. It’s pulsing, pulling, building between his legs. He can feel his knot swelling, and painfully pushing on the zip of his trousers. He dismisses the feeling, but every step makes it more and more obvious.
still sounds like he dreamed the word in there.
“I did always like that picture myself. It shows him quite well.”
. Mycroft texts from the car, “Said darling children were, through a combination of positive reinforcement and reverse psychology, remarkably well behaved this morning. I am somewhat apprehensive. M”
That Friday, Molly calls him around eight in the morning. “Hi, Sherlock. It’s, well, it’s a bit weird but I thought of you – I just found a note inside a stomach cavity?”
Sherlock wears John’s engagement ring, even though it feels foreign on his finger. It is a simple gold band, exactly the right size. Sherlock develops the habit of curling his hand around it and touching it.
But it is what he always wanted, right? It might not be exactly what he thought it would be, but it’s close enough.
Still no reply.
He had hoped for too much, hadn’t he? With what happened in the hospital and at Christmas, too, he’d thought that they’d unlocked it. That they had finally found the key to making it good for both of them, to have some sort of happy middle.
Because Sherlock still doesn’t get it, the fucking idiot - he doesn’t know how much John loved him even then. How, when Sherlock left, he took John’s whole world with him.
Mycroft helps get his waistcoat off, but then John has to kiss him again, a bright burst of lips and heat. Their hands bump and tangle and Mycroft says, something indulgent and amused in his voice that John hasn’t heard often but he wants to hear a whole lot more of, “This will go faster if I do it, John.”
“Naturally.” Mycroft pretends to be insulted. “Did you ever doubt that?”
Sherlock’s eyes flick away from the laptop screen, a little hesitantly, not quite so cool talking about this as he’s pretending to be, John thinks. “You have tried to...?” Sherlock frowns, the ridges in his forehead suddenly visible. He’s actually at loss for words.
“That’s a great idea, Janine!” Bainbridge seems to be on board.
“I don’t know.” John eyes him. Does he want Sherlock to fight? Why? Is that going to help anything, or just make him feel less guilty for a bit? “I really don’t know, Sherlock.” He sighs.
Sherlock can’t give in to that. He has power in every sense of the word right now. He could do something unimaginable to Mycroft and enjoy it more than he has ever enjoyed anything.
He gets on the floor with her and Sherlock, and they build endless towers together. Sherlock’s are so structurally sound that Violet has trouble pushing them over, especially when John helps with the foundations.
While John pulls his undershirt over his head, Sherlock runs his fingertips over John’s arm, upwards to his shoulder, then over his chest, inspecting the tattooed skin. He sees a Rod of Asclepius on John’s upper arm, and mirrored on the other side an army crest. Sherlock follows a traditional snake, twisted over John’s chest. He discerns realistic guns as well as scalpels.
for it.
John follows him down the stairs, where Sherlock takes the front seat in the car –
Mycroft’s eyes do seem briefly happy. Then he says again, “Please do not expect too much yet.” He looks at Violet. “If you don’t mind, I am really quite tired…”
It is unfair to John as well, who deserves Sherlock’s time and affection much more than Mycroft does.
“I’ll do the five lines,” Janine decides. She smiles, clearly pleased to be allowed to dictate this challenge. “Sherlock can do the tigers, John the peaks, and Molly the eight directions.”
John has to suppress a breath of laughter. Sherlock’s eyes are still glittering.
He has not informed his parents yet that he is expecting, and Mycroft knows by their continued silence that Sherlock hasn’t, either. They do not know, and the thought of telling them now is impossible. The idea that Sherlock bonded to him, Mummy will find it deeply shameful. And he might still miscarry. So no, he will not inform them.
“You did something that’s really concentrated on lines, but you still created a lot of movement through the tattoo with the heavy dark image at the bottom and then some areas of red throughout so it doesn’t just have a straight block feel.” Mike’s getting technical here.
Sherlock seems surprised, mainly.
And then to have John kiss his shoulder and say, “I’m going home, promised we’d go to the morgue early tomorrow. Molly’s back from her honeymoon and there’s a pile of bodies.”
Until - and god help him, John should have known this - Sherlock turns to him and says, “I emailed you a list of sex positions that are considered to be safe during pregnancy. Also, you should use a condom unless you were both tested recently. Mycroft is fine and you were tested before the donation, so that should be sufficient if you prefer to go without.”
When there’s the sound of the door opening downstairs, Sherlock can’t take it anymore. He jumps up, and throws the door open. He can read it on Mycroft’s face immediately - Mycroft is allowing him to see it. “Healthy,” he blurts out.
John’s eyelashes are dark with tears, his cheeks gleam with wetness, and he wipes his nose on his sleeve. He seems embarrassed. “Sorry. About that.”
Sherlock gives him a look. “I chose to exclude Janine because she will find it highly unpleasant not to compete. With Bainbridge and Raz I expect them to be overly confident and to select a project excessively large or intricate. With the other two I am hoping for indecision and an inability to finish in the appointed time.”
Sherlock has always kept his cases and Violet separated, a fact which Mycroft has taken for granted.
John says, some nervous humour in his voice, “Sherlock, you
He could use a distraction.
They should have gone for weird, John thinks. Sherlock’s frustrated sound by his side is probably for similar reasons. They really did go for it on this one.
They sit and wait for a while. John adjusts his sleeves so he doesn’t show any of his own ink on camera. He never liked showing it off.
And he is. Sherlock writes down when she eats, and how much. When he changes her, when she sleeps, when she cries, it all goes into a notebook. It’s both exactly how John thought Sherlock would be - if he ever would have thought Sherlock would go through the effort of learning what a baby needs - and utterly bizarre to see Sherlock care that much.
Sherlock gets her back while Mycroft dresses, and at eight the nanny lets herself in. Sherlock scans her as well as he can - a woman, beta, in her early forties, she has a child of her own, career as a nanny, at least four previous placements - before he says, “Morning.”
Sherlock doesn’t say anything, but there’s something in his body language that seems to allow him here. So John sits on the bed, takes his shoes off, and lies down next to him. Then he says to the ceiling, “I feel like shit.”
I'm back from London! *g*
When the police car finally pulls up, John closes the door behind him and immediately walks outside to intercept Greg.
“You kissed him.”
Mike smiles indulgently at her, then changes towards a sterner expression. “And now for the worst tattoo of the day.” Mike shakes his head. “It’s between two of you: Soo Lin, and John.”
And that’s it. John reaches out, and Sherlock meets him halfway.
Sherlock wants to have John in his bed every night, and not just when Violet sleeps over. He could even deal with some kisses, if John wants them. If it would make him happy.
Mycroft’s lips thin. “No need to worry, I assure you.”
What? John looks up.
Mycroft says delicately, “I believe technically, Sherlock did that first.”
.” John consciously repeats Sherlock’s words just to see Sherlock smile.
Sherlock shrugs. “You might as well.”
Molly immediately gravitates towards the one with the snake. “Can I?” She reaches out her hand. The trainer nods, and Molly touches the snake and pets it like she would a cat. “Oh, he’s so cute!”
He hadn’t meant to sleep here. Sherlock was recounting the Baskerville case, first for Violet because she tends to fall asleep to the sound of his voice, and then John just... stayed. They were waiting for Mycroft to come home. He must have drifted off.
Mycroft says, calmly, “I would never dare to replace you, John.”
“Yes, and as soon as possible, if I were you.”
Sherlock didn’t think it would matter. He’s bonded to Mycroft, so he has the biological connection. There are the genetics, too, it’ll be his nephew. Sherlock thought that was more than enough.
That was
Mycroft doesn’t reply. John glances at him and sees his closed-off expression. “If there is any change, I will inform you both.”
John nods his goodbye.
Except that instead of going home to fuck, Sherlock stays awake and starts some experiment, and John lies alone in his cold bed.
Sherlock closes his eyes and stays there, drifting on the comfort.
Sherlock lowers his hand, just a little. And damn, John shouldn’t think this, but he loosens his grip, and eyes Sherlock’s hand, lying on his ribs now. Imagines it wrapped around his cock. The careful pull of those long, sensual fingers. John hasn’t had that in a year, a whole fucking
Sherlock leaves, and Mycroft sinks back in his chair, feeling eternally guilty.
John grins, steps towards him, and kisses him.
It’s a soft-spoken older man, who says, “On my back.” The next is a young woman who wants a tattoo on her ribs. Then a bloke who wants his upper arm, a middle-aged woman who wants her hip done, and then last a muscled bloke who wants his shoulder.
Is he wearing dog tags? Sherlock reaches out and touches the soldier’s chest to pull them out so he can feel them brush against his back during sex. But no such luck. Still, the man’s chest is warm, the fabric of his shirt is intriguing, and Sherlock traces his hand over the curve of the soldier’s soft stomach. He sucks it in with a self-deprecating look.
Mycroft says with forced calm, “Yes.”
“I really like this tattoo.” Irene seems pleased. “It’s clean, simple, and it tells the whole story.” She meets his eyes. “Technically one of the best tattoos of the day.”
. John would like to be struck by the sheer impossibility of that. He’d like to be the sort of man that’s strong enough to walk right out of the door around now. But he isn’t, is he? This is exactly the sort of man John is.
. Sherlock always was able to enhance his performance with chemicals; this competition would not be any different. If he had cocaine, he would be able to complete this drawing quicker. It would speed up his mind and hands and, more importantly, make him forget the sensation of John sitting next to him, the brush of his side somehow warming his entire body.
Sherlock snorts. “Probably.”
“I think violets are edible, actually. But still, yeah, we will.”
“I would imagine so.” Mycroft does not need to think about it, because it is not an admission of weakness. It is not a secret, it is simply a fact. He went through the terror of wanting a child, and then the pain and difficulty of receiving one. How could it have not?
There is a flash of sympathy in Mycroft’s eyes. “I am aware of that, John.”
“Yes,
He feels outside of reality. But John is here, John is laughing, and it feels right.
Irene smiles. “Arguably. But it’s solid work.”
wanted to prepare, so he indulged her. She’s been knitting booties and tiny jumpers with her knitting group, as well as pushing endless home baked cakes and sweets onto Mycroft.
Sherlock hears John say, “Well done! Now get down and…” The toilet flushes. There is the sound of the tap running, and Violet’s high voice as she says, “But
They all walk over to their clients.
“What on earth made you think that you needed to come over at this hour?” Mycroft needs to raise his voice to be heard over her.
Sherlock dries her off, and then takes her along to his bed to put her to sleep. That still works best.
John doesn’t really know why that matters, but they carry the kid’s picture around Hackney that evening, going from one group of homeless people to the next.
John starts to say, “Well, that’s nothing new....” When Sherlock’s phone buzzes.
over the appendix removal scar. It’s quite predicable. Not the best choice in terms of placement as well.
At least he’s not much for pleasantries.
Sherlock frowns. “I
Mycroft takes if off and puts it on the bed. He holds John and Sherlock’s ring in the palm of his hand. This would not be meaningless at all, he is aware.
Sherlock agrees. He can feel a small, expectant wiggle in his stomach whenever he thinks of it, and he thinks of it often. “Five weeks and four days.”
The shop Mike sent John to turns out to be an ugly and neglected shopfront in Bethnal Green. It has a door that sticks, paint peeling off the walls, and the smell of vintage clothing still heavy in the air even though the stock is long gone.
“Hmm.” Sherlock leaves him. He gets up and quickly walks outside for a cigarette.
When he does go back to therapy, John actually tells her what happened. “I found him shooting up. Heroin.”
Molly laughs.
Sherlock’s still undressing. His chest is an expanse of pale flesh with some dark hairs and small nipples. He has a hollow of a stomach. He steps out of his trousers and chucks away his pants as if they’re useless at this point. John can see long legs, a black shock of pubes, and a completely soft cock between them.
Dr. Mehta looks at him. “We might want to schedule the C-section a week later than planned?”
Sherlock wanders through London, supposedly to go see the double murder crime scene, but not deducing much.
The man – Sherlock Holmes, John assumes – looks up and glances at him for a long moment, and then stubs his cigarette into an ashtray.
John teases him for a while, then presses his fingers between Mycroft’s arse cheeks and slowly fingers him like that. Mycroft wants to put his legs around John and keep him there, but he is not nearly flexible enough to do that. He can feel a knot in his throat as he says, into the half-dark, “John.”
“I’m outside your door, actually?” John feels a bit weird saying it. Maybe he should have called ahead. “I didn’t want to ring the doorbell and wake Violet up, so…”
normal, right?
John makes three cups, one for Sherlock as well, and then brings them to the living room. Mycroft is sitting on the sofa, Violet in his arms. He looks tired.
Hardly surprising, considering she managed a full circle by hand. Molly smiles, “Thank you! It was fun.”
“Not nearly as good as you are, you mean?” It comes out fast.
“No, thank you. I have not seen her in two days, I believe it is time for her to come home.”
It helps, Sherlock laughs, lowly. The sound makes John’s stomach tingle.
Sherlock says, again, as if he is convincing himself, “She did not
John asks, “Really? You want me to?”
Mycroft lets it roll over him, and never replies to her requests. He knows that sooner or later, they will not be able to keep it a secret any longer, and that it is incredible that they have done so for this long. But he is reluctant to press it now, mainly because of the fact that Sherlock has not contacted either of them, either.
They have
“I can inject myself again, we can do it this weekend.”
And then, he posted the ad, and going out for sex wasn’t a necessity anymore. After the train manager, it was a Starbucks employee and his partner the music teacher. They took turns, and Sherlock felt their hands, saw their faces, and could deduce everything about them and their four-month relationship.
So he works.
And so is this entire wedding.
And he fails to feel love for William with the intensity that Sherlock does. The fact that Sherlock cares so much is a great gift, naturally, but Mycroft is uncomfortably aware that his own capacity to love does not measure up. Mycroft answers every cry, he gives every bit of attention required, but his mind often drifts when he takes care of William.
They’re halfway through idly eating some melon and prosciutto – it’s really good, but John’s just not that hungry - when Mycroft comes in with the kids. He lets Violet run to them, and she immediately finds Sherlock and climbs onto his lap. “I had a bath and it had bubbles!”
John sits back.
They are back at the hospital by eight.
And that evening, Mycroft has his chauffeur take him to the hospital so he can see William for himself. He feeds him, and holds him. He tries to adjust to the idea of all the intricacies involved in caring for such a small infant.
By the time they’re finished filming his tattoo and John’s said goodbye to his client, Sherlock is in conversation with Janine. “…could attempt to contact Math, who specialises in ‘Dark Trash’.”
“Yes.” Sherlock smiles back. He can feel the happiness of it, this went well, but it’s drowned by fear, too. He cannot mess this up.
He’s allowed that much.
As if there is no present.
, their scent, that it feels like an intrusion. “It’s…” He pulls his nose. “New.”
Sherlock walks in and starts stripping. Only down to his underwear, but John still glances at him in the mirror. No reason not to appreciate the view, right? But to be honest, even if Sherlock was up for it, John’s not sure he could go for it right now.
His legs tremble when he pushes the dildo back in, slowly, purposefully. He can imagine there being a man attached to it, one that teases him by going slow. One that wishes to draw out his desire.
As soon as they get to Baker Street, John gets out.
Sherlock doesn’t have to push very hard to make her break down in tears and confess. Turns out the victim gave up on his chemotherapy and dreamed up a very specific suicide instead. He set up a carefully calculated machine with a wooden stake, tied an elastic band around his penis, and asked her to cut it off for him afterwards, as well as remove the machine that held the stake.
Their body language is open, still. They’re moving in sync, as if they can’t fully be separated yet. John’s sure it’s entirely unconscious, but he likes seeing it.
Mycroft argues that it’s a developmental step back and that they should discourage it. John says they’ve changed enough nappies and that she’s capable of using the potty. But Sherlock is inclined to give in, for now. She wants to be just like the baby.
William, probably in part because of Sherlock’s endless patience in feeding him, is allowed to be off the feeding tube entirely. But it will be a few more days before he can come home.
John finally says goodbye to his client and joins them, subtly wincing as he leans on his cane. He smiles. “Hiya.”
It’s not just that. It’s so much easier, this, than all the rest. Than all the touching and hesitating and the sheer annoyance of it! Sex.
The clients must think he’s weird, but it’s pretty hilarious, John thinks.
It is out of habit that he takes his phone and checks it. There are no messages from John.
When the dim morning light grows brighter, John drags himself out of bed. He showers, and then makes sure he’s downstairs first for once. Sherlock got him coffee, so this time, it’s John’s turn.
Mrs. Hudson adds some disturbing comments about her Frank. She says, “Oh, yes, he did cheat on me, but he had a big libido, you know, he was an alpha, and a big… well, that too. I was a very
Mycroft is looking at what he is doing. John knows it’s the evening, the booze, the fact that it’s late, and that the candles are sputtering out all around them, but it feels a bit… Mycroft meets his eye, a gentle look, and then says, “There.”
But still, there is something there that he both envies, and is aware that he will never have. Mycroft will never be entirely comfortable with this role, he thinks now. Because he knows what he is capable of out of love. He looks at Violet, and he knows that he would do anything. Not coldly, not calculated, Mycroft would tear himself to pieces for her. He is doing so, daily.
. He stills.
“You need to induce the feeling of tenderness,” Sherlock hears himself say. “Of falling to your knees for a lover in awe.”
this was. The mephedrone and the GHB are fading, and he has a stabbing headache. His mouth is dry. His anus throbs and burns. He is shivering, sweating, and increasingly nauseous.
Mycroft can only breathe against John’s lips. They are going so very fast, but he cannot deny that he wants this. John’s hand travels the base of his penis, feeling his balls, learning the shape of him, and Mycroft is stunned by how intimate it feels to have John’s hand between his legs, and John’s face so close. It has the embarrassing effect of making his erection harden and notably twitch.
It’s everything else that drags, and Sherlock doesn’t know how to fix that. Not really, except that they are always moving towards better things. John wanted kids, and they’ll soon have two. John wanted sex, and he can go out to get it - only that’s somehow flawed?
Sherlock follows him into the deep, cool dark.
In the morning, Sherlock takes the lift down to see John sitting on his usual sofa. He has notable bags under his eyes, which is indicating a lot for someone with a history of both medical school and the army. John looks up, ready to speak, so Sherlock quickly comments, “You look terrible.”
Mycroft says, while rubbing Violet’s back, “I do not take these things lightly, John.”
It’s odd how Sherlock doesn’t notice the way people respond to him. He can pull everyone’s eye in a room without even thinking he’s getting a glance. He can be warm, when he wants to be. Even when he’s not, really. Sherlock’s scathing but real, so real in who he is. Unapologetically.
.” He fixes him with a serious stare.
Sherlock ignores her smile while they walk inside the hangar, to see four entirely white cars parked there. Next to each car, there is a workstation prepared with a large selection of markers.
Mycroft agreed with Sherlock on the principle that Father should be allowed to meet Violet. But now that they are actually here, Mycroft wishes for little more than to turn around again and to put Violet back in the car.
Sherlock, he assumes, did not think it through and advocated for it because John asked, but that does offer another perspective as well. Can he do this for Sherlock? Truly? Would it harm Sherlock, or benefit him?
Plus, it’s not like he’s even getting paid, so they might as well fire him.
somewhat pleasant to relax. Sherlock is fatigued, and he can feel the pleasure in allowing his spent body to lean next to John’s. They are nothing but sated and warm naked skin.
Sherlock smiles. “Mine.”
As the night goes on, the pictures are all less posed, the faces more flushed, and the smiles larger.
Sherlock thought that Mycroft would excuse himself as quickly as possible, but he actually agrees to sit down and stay for a few minutes. The cake has probably something to do with it - Mycroft never could resist a Battenberg. Or maybe he’s feeling like celebrating, because he accepts tea and cake as well as Mrs. Hudson’s happy nattering about babies and how betas are completely different, he’ll see. John meets his eyes over the table, and Sherlock smiles.
Sherlock blinks.
Sherlock half-heartedly tries to deduce what it’ll be this year. Mycroft’s sentimental nature is not too difficult to predict, so an offer of something of their choosing again seems likely. Money, a home - he’s done it so often that Sherlock doesn’t particularly care. But John tends to be impressed by it.
Anthea throws him looks between mild annoyance and astonishment when Mycroft discusses night time rituals with the Duchess, and how attached they become to their toys.
John glances at him. “That’s why you’re here too, then? The challenge?” He seems to want to know the answer.
It’s John reaching out for something they can share. Sherlock has never thought of alcohol as his preferred substance for alteration of the mind, but he can admit that it feels nice enough to sink into drunkenness. To see the room spin mildly and John laugh about something that objectively isn’t all that funny. John’s deep, relaxed giggles are so infectious that Sherlock laughs too, again and again.
John announced their engagement by writing a post on his long-neglected blog titled, ‘The Case of the Engaged Detective.’ It reads,
Sherlock doesn’t shrug the hand away.
, John is sure of it.
, was a type of extortion commonly practised by the Sicilian Mafia in the United States among immigrant families in the early nineteen hundreds.” Sherlock eyes John. “The custom appeared to have died out after the mid nineteen twenties.”
Sherlock sees him and tilts his head in a quiet hello. Mycroft takes a seat next to Sherlock on the sofa, and Sherlock comfortably leans against his back and bites his neck, while holding William. John simply keeps on reading to Violet. Although Mycroft’s arrival did distract her, she continues to listen to John.
“You wouldn’t even try?” Sherlock says it angrily, as if Mycroft has frustrated him simply by making a sane choice.
It takes Sherlock two full days of researching and a break-in into a laboratory before they find a possible lead. The granddaughter is reading chemistry at Cambridge.
The boa constrictor is now lazily curling around Molly’s arm, and she smiles widely. “I have a corn snake at home. Toby, he’s called.”
Violet gives him a big smack of a kiss before they leave, and that makes Sherlock feel somewhat more connected to reality. It will be all right.
Sherlock lies back on the sofa, with the tourniquet on and the needle in his vein, and he can see the walls melt into bright, thrumming outlines. He can hear the city rushing past. His brain evaporates out beyond walls, and the universe shines and flutters while he drifts and spreads like a cloud.
“Why would I be
at himself. Alienated from what he was. Who he was, without a working leg.
Sherlock is sitting on the sofa, appearing relaxed. Mycroft wonders why he greeted him like that. Just general anxiety? Mycroft does find it a comfort himself, bonding. The warmth of it is still running through him.
This is the right thing to do. It has to be.
Eventually Mycroft takes over, his toast half-eaten on his plate. He already seems practiced at it, holding the bottle just right, stopping when she coughs. Sherlock observes him. He has never seen him do this, but at the same time it suits him. As if he was always going to have a child.
“Good technique here.” Jim’s in a flashy plaid suit today. He doesn’t sound overly enthusiastic, but then Jim’s not one to care for the ladies, either, John remembers reading it somewhere. He’s been out for ages.
Mycroft deals with a meeting with several MPs. Then with an agent that was selling state secrets on the black market and now needs a certain amount of persuasion to give up her contacts. He works with intense focus.
He had never truly allowed himself to want this.
But there is something about lying back, and speaking like that, as if there is nothing but the words between them. Sherlock lays his hand on Violet’s small stomach to calm her, and feels her every deep breath in and out while John smiles over a memory from his childhood.
Mycroft smiles back lightly, but he doesn’t say anything.
Mycroft would be bothered by Sherlock letting her that close to the floor, if he did not know that Mrs. Hudson has been cleaning daily, and he himself provided the mat after seeing the frankly repulsive second hand things they had been allowing near Violet in the flat. And she can’t have been on there for more than a couple of minutes, seeing as how she has not started grunting in irritation yet.
Sherlock says, “We can measure it with a heart monitor.”
Then John says, “Oh, god.” At the same time as Sherlock says, “Yes!”
“It is… pleasing to witness.” Sherlock’s voice wavers, and John looks at him. Sherlock’s eyes are trained on him while Sherlock’s hand wraps around his cock, and he gives himself a slow stroke.
John turns around so Sherlock can see his back. There is a knight over John’s spine, wielding a shining sword. It seems small compared to the roaring dragon above him, the red lightly faded over John’s shoulder where the pigment has fallen out over his scarring. Sherlock wants to kiss it. To press his tongue there and taste the scar, the wild flesh, the pain.
Mycroft is aware of John’s clear-cut desire to be honest about their life, and of course John and Sherlock are also allowed to say that they are William’s and Violet’s parents. But Mycroft is not at all comfortable with possibly exposing Violet, and later, William, to ridicule.
uncomfortable, for once.
And then - and he wasn’t even trying, wasn’t even all that enthused to meet someone new - in a string of terrible dates, there’s suddenly a good one.
He sighs.
He’s looked at his suit, hanging ready in Mycroft’s wardrobe, but he didn’t want to wear it yet just in case he’ll somehow mess it up.
John wakes up again when Violet attempts to sneak into his bed, at - he checks the clock and sighs - six twenty AM. “Come on, little monkey.” John holds the covers open for her. Sherlock’s space is empty anyway. John looks at Violet, for as much as he can see her in the dark. “It’s just you and me again, huh?”
Oh yes, John’s sure of it. “He was a menace with mine. Trust me, he was going to go full-on wedding planner if you wanted one.”
Then gets close, and sniffs the air around him while Mycroft gives him an appalled look. “Sherlock,
There’s no use in doing nothing, right?
It wears her out, too. In the cab home, she falls asleep on John’s chest.
Mycroft sighs. “No, I imagine I could be nine months pregnant and he still wouldn’t.”
Good.
It would be a risk to go illustrative, but John can’t see the fault in that. He wants to. He wants to be that artist.
So yes. Good. John can’t look at Sherlock anymore. He feels wrung out. But he does it anyway, asks, “How was the case, then?”
“Is she all right?” Has she gained weight? Is she eating well? Sleeping?
“You really need to punch in that black to make it strong,” Mike says diplomatically. “But the softness was perfect.”
Sherlock looks up sharply.
John tries to get off in about a dozen ways. He always
John sits down next to him, but he still seems restless.
John seems to be in a great mood, his grins linger and shine on in his eyes even as his mouth relaxes. John reaches out his hand over the table, and Sherlock takes it in his.
John closes his fist around Sherlock’s cock and starts pulling him off in earnest, but Sherlock draws him into a kiss that feels so sincere John can feel his toes curl.
“You will need to assign the canvasses together later today, so have a think on that already,” Mike advises.
John doesn’t see Sherlock anywhere, so he walks a slow circle around the studio. He eventually spots him on a low wall, reclined on top of it, with his hands clasped and eyes closed.
John has no idea what Mycroft’s thinking. Probably that he’s daring a lot to even bring it up. “If you would, would you use the same... donor?”
John can feel his face heat up as Sherlock leans over to watch. He can feel him breathing onto his cock, and it’s making him mildly dizzy.
“Well, get on with it.”
It makes something guilty lock in John’s throat.
Sherlock glances at Violet. She’s up past her bedtime, but he doesn’t feel calm enough to put her to bed now. It’s better to let her fall asleep on the sofa. She’s idly moving her legs up and down. She seems near sleep.
Sherlock doesn’t care for Mycroft’s
But it works. Violet sniffs, slowly relaxes, and by ‘ten,’ she is looking at Mycroft. Mycroft gives her a gentle touch, and then says, “Well done. Now you can play again.” And she nods, some tears still streaking her face, and slowly goes back to her building blocks.
“Yeah, of course!” John smiles. “Of course I’m interested.”
They watch the casket being lowered into the ground, and then get back into the car for the short ride to the house.
When Mycroft closes the door behind him - clumsily, as he is carrying a squirming Violet and her changing bag - John looks at Sherlock.
Mycroft thinks of John offering to have a child together, so long ago. And William now, here, in his arms.
John faces Sherlock, takes his hand, and they step in front of the registrar.
, but Sherlock is very cautious. John finds it surprisingly touching, Sherlock, still in his coat, holding this small baby in his arms. It’s his face that does it, though. Sherlock is looking down at her with something between panic and fascination.
Mycroft hesitates. He knew that Sherlock would want to share it with these people, but somehow saying it feels rather intrusive. John sees and says, “Actually, can I tell them?”
John turns his face towards him, searches for his lips then,
John says, not understanding, “Well, yeah, it’s good news, right, something... good?”
Mycroft listens to John’s soft sounds of encouragement. Mycroft closes his eyes and feels John’s care in every touch and every gentle lick over his flesh. Or he
He has one, in fact. Still in the packaging, ready in his bathroom. Part of him knows that it would be better to face the unavoidable disappointment now. But every morning he looks at it and then does not touch it. Some mornings because Violet is awake and demanding his attention. Others simply because he does not wish to.
Sherlock likes the definition of the scar tissue, even through John’s tattoo of a planet. It was a tunnelled venous or ‘Hickman’ catheter that left that scar.
Four clients walk out. As Molly slides off her seat, the plastic wrap on her thigh is briefly visible. All of them are still healing their own tattoos.
Mycroft cannot stop looking at him.
And he does owe Sherlock.
As they walk out the door, John can feel the warmth spreading in his chest. He should have done this years ago. He can see the way Sherlock’s beaming - he seems properly proud to be on his arm. To be out here as
Sherlock, to his credit, doesn’t ask what’s wrong or what happened. He says, hesitantly, “I was telling Violet a story. The Hamlet one but with lions.”
Mycroft imagines the joy, perhaps from all of them.
John goes back to work, and then comes home early to a wild hug from Violet.
“Hey.” John reaches out and touches his cheek.
Sherlock takes Violet to his room to put her to sleep.
, I’ll stop you. I promise.” John seems confident. Like a soldier, and Sherlock wants to bend him over even more at the sight of it.
John leans over and pulls Mycroft close. The feeling of John’s arms pulling him in is enough for Mycroft to feel a throb of pain deep inside of him. He leans his forehead against John’s shoulder.
, right?
Sherlock spends the next day with Violet, and as soon as John comes home in the evening, Sherlock drags him along on a case. He’s brittle with energy, near-manic. Cruel in a way that John hasn’t seen him be in a long time, too. John spends most of the night running after him and apologising for him, so if that is what the bastard thinks counts as foreplay…
“Hm?” Mycroft asks, apparently only barely interested.
He goes by the morgue. Molly isn’t at work yet, but she will be soon, so Sherlock sneaks past the office where the current medical examiner is updating his files, logs on at a terminal using Molly’s password, and starts scanning autopsy reports. There has to be something somewhere. A nice murder to solve.
When Sherlock looks at John, he feels the same as before. But John said it, he can’t give him what he wants, love him in the way that he wants to be loved. So this is enough. It has to be.
“What’s wrong?” Sherlock seems uncharacteristically anxious.
Sherlock walks down the stairs, suddenly very aware of the possibility of dropping her. Mycroft is right, he’s never tried to take care of a child. The movement of him walking wakes her again, and she starts murmuring. He hurries, because he doesn’t need Mycroft to hear, but then he’s downstairs.
Violet shouts, “I don’t
When they break into the house of the gunman, Sherlock goes first. He throws himself at the gun with a rapidly beating heart, shaking so much afterwards that he can barely conceal it, but he has to.
John closes his eyes and breathes out, feeling the last shocks of it.
She seems startled by the question. “Oh… yes? I mean, it’s not perfect, nothing ever is, but it’s…” She smiles softly. “We’re good together, you know? It just works.”
“Spaghetti sauce,” Sherlock says darkly.
“Please do not worry, I simply would like to bring Violet over for the night so I can rest.”
Mycroft feels as if perhaps John should expect something different from this. But then he remembers the hormonal component of it, and he imagines that John is indeed following his instinct. But still, Mycroft has never been held quite this much, or has had comforting hands put on his back and been asked, “You sore?” in that tone.
It does.
John takes a breath. All right.
For a fraction of a moment, Mycroft allows his worst fears to come forward in his mind. The idea that his child is not alive, that something went terribly wrong. But then he hears the familiar thudding of a heartbeat, fast, and he exhales slowly.
The Tesco cashier seems satisfied enough by Sherlock’s actions. John, however -
John says, “No, it’s my flatmate.” And then, realising that this isn’t going to go anywhere anyway, shows her the picture and says, “But yeah, I suppose.”
Mycroft nods. “Yes, I have other pressing issues to deal with as well.”
Quite often, she does it purposefully.
When they sit down, John asks, “Was he angry? Because with me...” He shrugs. “Suppose I got off easy.”
John realises that he’s staring, because he asks, “What?”
John turns back to his own shop and settles in with his client to finish up the detail work. He’s not sure whether he’s doing that well, compared to everyone else. He doesn’t want to go home though.
“Let’s see what you chose to show us today.” Mike smiles.
John looks up, still smiling, “You okay?”
Mycroft discusses it with Sherlock, because he assumes that he might have a different perspective. But at the mention of ‘making friends’, Sherlock holds Violet tighter.
By the time he returns, Mycroft feels as if he can control this again. He meets John’s eyes, and John says, “You know, that makes me feel pretty damn good.”
Sherlock distantly longs for a cigarette to occupy his hands. Or drugs, of course. Always drugs.
God. What the hell did he do?
Sherlock nods.
quiet.
“Yes.” Sherlock seems so solemn John wants to kiss the carefulness off his lips again. He wants to shake him, tell him, let him know that... What? What is he going to say? That it’ll all be okay as long as they’re together?
Mycroft lets him, feeling bewildered. “Yes?”
John looks down, and right, Sherlock’s not hard any more, but that’s not what he meant. Okay. Not going to happen tonight, then. That’s fine. John looks at Sherlock, but he can’t get past the nakedness here because he’s so fucking stunning. “Can you wear some clothes?”
Hm. That actually sounds nice. John pats the space next to him, and Sherlock dutifully sits down onto the sofa. He vaguely smells like plaster dust. “Tell me the story of John and Sherlock.” John’s kidding, mainly.
According to John, Sherlock has told Inspector Lestrade that he can only work cases around William’s schedule.
“I guess so.” John’s never been that much for porn magazines. Or not after the age of fifteen, anyway. “I’d rather imagine, really.”
They are called back inside by an assistant only minutes later. Sherlock feels reluctant to go and sit through the judging. He likely didn’t win. Perhaps John did.
John agrees, and goes on to the next.
Mycroft feels a small tightening of his stomach occasionally, but he is aware of the possibility of Braxton Hicks contractions and is well read up on them, so he pays it little mind. It’s been a while since he has had nausea, but even when he needs to get up at work and empty the contents of his stomach, he is not alarmed - he suffered this dozens of times already. He is not concerned until he uses the toilet later that day, feeling a cramp of some sort, and sees bright red blood.
And yes, there is the ache of uncertainty, the constant reminder that when it comes to interpersonal relationships, Mycroft never quite grasped it all. He was always somehow perceived as being less than spontaneous, less than genuine. But while the low-level worry for the future of all of this seems like a constant cloud surrounding him, it does not entirely weigh up against the pleasure of actually kissing John.
Sherlock purposely gets out of the shower. He’s dripping wet, naked, and yes, John’s gaze brushes over him. Even now, John can’t help it.
It doesn’t lead to sex, as Sherlock had imagined. John just looks at him with a raised eyebrow and smiles.
But underneath….
John smiles briefly, charmed. “Okay. Okay, well, you’re allowed to. For future reference.”
He can’t look at Sherlock, for a moment.
. But Lestrade says, “Go home now, yeah? John will want to see you.”
When John walks into the studio, Sherlock looks up from his work. No matter how focused he was, Sherlock still noticed that he left, John knows. He smiles to show that he’s good – got an idea now.
“It was arousing you?” Sherlock isn’t sure he needs to ask. John’s pupils are enlarged. Sherlock can’t take his pulse, but he would bet that it is elevated.
The answer is too much.
Sherlock grabs his coat and goes alone.
April brings a series of abnormally sunny days.
He feels hung-over, in some distant way.
“No.” Mycroft’s voice halts. He hesitates, then says, clearly, “You are right, John. I am…” he pauses briefly, as if he can’t quite make the word fit, “...expecting.”
Everyone’s gone already. John wouldn’t have minded getting to chat with Sherlock some more, but then he’s probably not in the mood after losing anyway. He probably already disappeared to wherever he goes during break times.
“Yes.” Sherlock has been wondering exactly how Violet resembles him as a child. She has Mycroft’s nose and a softer hue of hair, but she does have enough of Sherlock that people instantly assume that she is his. He wants to compare.
The second time Sherlock comes around, it’s about the gun’s nuzzle.
“...yes.”
“I have no need for your help,” Sherlock repeats. He focuses on his laptop until Molly leaves.
Once outside, there’s people offering their condolences, but Mycroft doesn’t acknowledge a single one of them and moves straight past them. Sherlock lingers a bit and looks at his father, so John leaves them together and hurries to catch up with Mycroft.
Perhaps it has the connection in John’s mind as well, because he asks, “Violet’s asleep?”
So John goes out by himself, instead. Has some sad, greasy chips standing up in a shop. A weak beer in a pub. He doesn’t want to be doing this, actually, but sometimes he just needs to be away for a bit. Or that’s what he tells himself.
He does not have enough to give in return to either of them. But he must try. Sherlock told him that while he might be inadequate, he must give everything he can. Mycroft had thought it sounded overly simplistic at the time, but he thinks now that there was a truth to it.
“As it is a flash challenge, you are allowed to default,” Irene answers. “But we encourage you to take the step.”
One never gets far in life if they live it in a way that requires the approval of others.
And that is how, thirty minutes later, they are all seated on the sofa, eating from a selection of bags on the living room table.
One day, John asks, a strange expression on his face, “You ever wonder who her other dad is? Or mum, I suppose?”
Mycroft nods. “Fine, send it to me.” And to Violet, “Now where did you go today?”
It doesn’t have to be. Sherlock’s whole body wants to get close and lick and suck Mycroft’s neck for hours, until he’s entirely sure that Mycroft only smells of him, that he’s all his. But he suppresses the urge. He can’t find his voice for a moment, and then says, “The books say only a small reconnection is necessary.”
He feels another wave of dizziness and has to spend several minutes practicing very controlled breathing in a meeting in order not to faint. He sips a glass of water, hoping that it is not too obvious that he can hardly see because of the waves of black-and-white spots in front of his eyes. Mycroft still argues his point when called upon. Eloquently, he hopes.
John says, from the sofa, “No, not really. Did you?”
John imagines Mycroft’s hands holding his right there on the mattress, the push of a heavily pregnant belly against his back, Mycroft saying into his ear, “Is this what you want, John? Do you want to feel me inside of you?”
there, Mycroft oftentimes feels contrary. He feels unwilling to ask for more, but also unwilling to remain silent. It is a strange situation, and he finds it difficult to cope at times.
Hah! So he
The waitress brings over a hot cuppa. And then a plate of bangers and mash. John tucks in, he feels like he hasn’t eaten in ages. He hasn’t, really - the last he remembers is eating a hurried handful of Violet’s animal biscuits sometime this morning.
Part of him had always known, after all. That he was not meant to be a parent. It is what everyone had been thinking. Mycroft could see it in John’s expression when he first found out. In Anthea’s. Why would he even want this? He is not suited to it.
Sherlock can only agree.
It’s always Sherlock, the nanny, or Mrs. Hudson running in and out.
“All right.” Mycroft breathes. Then says, too genuinely, “Is there anything I can do for you?”
It’s not at all the same, though.
John tilts his hips again, a slow internal shift, and Mycroft makes another low sound.
The cold fluid on his stomach still carries an unpleasant reminder of nearly losing Violet, and he carefully controls his breathing. Dr. Mehta moves the probe around and does not say a word. She simply checks the screen. Mycroft can see it as well as she does - two round shapes. One much smaller than the other.
So although this is not an essential sonogram, Mycroft insisted. The doctor had not asked him why he would need one at exactly twenty-two weeks and three days, she had simply glanced at his file and agreed.
The woman’s eyebrows rise for a fraction of a moment, and then her professionalism wins out, and she says, “Ah, yes, please follow me.”
Sherlock loves it, and he’s also deeply aware of the danger of this, for both of them.
John wonders about what he’s doing. There’s no reason why Mycroft is going to think that this is particularly funny, or cute. Still, John looks for the digestives. Blue wrapper. And yes, he’s in luck there, too. He buys a packet.
- “I, um, I do, too.” John eyes him, and there is warmth in his eyes. “I... yeah, love you, too.”
John laughs in relief, a low rumble that Sherlock can feel more than hear. “Well, okay then.”
Mycroft joins them at a lull in the conversation and asks, calmly, he believes, “John, would you care to dance?”
Sherlock looks at Violet as she stops, bends her knees in an awkward move, and picks a single blade of grass from the path. She comes back, looks between them, and then chooses Sherlock. She holds her hand out as if she brought him a treasure, and Sherlock accepts it from her gloved hand. “Thank you?”
The tailor comes in and they discuss the lines and fit of the suit. Mycroft is entirely courteous with his opinions, but Sherlock can see his thoughts running underneath.
He feels a slow, spinning dizziness. There is cold sweat prickling on the back of his neck and chilling his back.
“You were the only one to do colour, or a portrait,” Irene notes. “And I think it paid off. The colour choices bring this portrait to life. And the subject…” She shakes her head. “Using Malala’s image was a great idea. We can’t say that you played it safe!”
They stay on the sofa like that, talking, touching, and looking at the pictures, until William wakes and cries for his nightly bottle. They feed him together.
“Hmm.”
And of course, the other things John said about missing him and not wanting to lose him... Mycroft knows that John is hardly as emotional when sober, and it clearly was the alcohol talking. But he does believe some of the sentiment behind it, because in truth, Mycroft himself has missed John, too.
Sherlock is on the sofa. He just finished feeding William, and he expertly puts the bib over his shoulder, holds William upright for a first burp, and then puts him on his shoulder and pats his back for the second burp, bib at the ready for the expected splash of regurgitated milk.
In fact, the next time Mycroft even sees them is three days later, both of them looking rather exhausted, but Sherlock with the manic glow of having just solved a puzzle. John says, “Don’t forget about Christmas Eve, right, tomorrow at seven.”
, when he looks at him.
Mycroft does eat the digestives. They help very little.
“Bond with him often, keep the hormone levels up.” Sherlock was going to do that anyway, John is sure. But at least it’s something he can do.
Sherlock studies his own face when he is walking up to the altar. He seems strong, there. He doesn’t remember feeling it.
Mycroft closes his eyes and thinks of how this is surely a positive. He never could have anticipated how it would affect him to lie in a bed in John’s arms like this. Or to have John feel their child’s kicking.
John tightens his grip, and pulls himself again. “Sherlock.” He doesn’t know what he’s asking for, just - anything will do.
John looks at him, and then at the bath. “You think I’d fit?”
He doesn’t. Instead he says, “That was amazing.” John shakes his head and grins. “Jesus.” John touches the back of his neck and checks for blood. There is none. Sherlock didn’t break the skin, he knows he didn’t, he was careful.
Yeah, John wasn’t talking about
John sends, from his job, “Welcome back to England! It’s been raining all day, can see it on the window. Every patient that complains about it gets a sticker. So far I’ve handed out twenty-three. Most to old people, who are v. confused. JW”
Then John thinks that it was just this case - drugs - that Sherlock’s sensitive about. But that seems a bit far-fetched, since they’ve handled drug cases before.
The last hours of the tattoo, John focuses only on what he needs to do. He has pure tunnel vision. One line after the next, every detail is magnified for him, and he doesn’t think of anything else because there’s no space left for anything else.
Molly looks down with a dull flush to her cheeks. She whispers, “I’m sorry,” while the judges turn away.
John’s not all that sure why no one ever says how happy
me some skulls,” Jim says gleefully.
John thinks about their life. The shop. Rosie, and all they built together. He turns his head to look at Mary, even though he can’t see a thing. He says, “I chose this, Mary. Us - I wanted it,” already knowing it’s in the past.
Sherlock nearly laughs at that. Wishing it didn’t hurt him doesn’t change a thing. John won’t leave because he’s happy now, and Sherlock is selfish enough to want exactly that, even if he has to rely on Mycroft. No matter what it takes to keep John here, he will do it. That is not even a question anymore.
At eight weeks, they will be able to see a lot. A heartbeat, hopefully. One, or two. Whether it appears healthy, or whether his nausea was just residual hormones, whether he already lost the pregnancy. Whether there is nothing to celebrate after all.
Sherlock texts Mycroft.
Mycroft’s eyes run over him, and he wants to say more - oh, Sherlock knows he wants to talk
that he would be here for forever. And Mycroft accepted the ring and wore it. Sherlock can feel a deep sense of fulfilment whenever he thinks of it. Like the old scarred bite mark on Mycroft’s neck from when they first bonded, Sherlock wants that ring to be there. Just like he wants Violet and William close to him. They all belong here.
Forever, probably.
Mycroft can only long for that sort of control.
“Janine, because of your win in the trash polka elimination challenge, you can assign which artist will tattoo which Sak Yant design,” Mike offers.
But now, Sherlock has been reading the baby books, and looking up on YouTube how to change a nappy. He’s preparing in all seriousness, and John has to admit that besides the occasional sting of memory, it’s amusing. Because it’s one thing to see Sherlock use that great brain of his to deduce a crime scene, but it’s quite another to hear him say with the same amount of seriousness, “A newborn has a very fragile skull, John.” As if it’s brand new information.
It doesn’t matter.
So he will be forgiven, Mycroft thinks. He watches Sherlock bathe Violet with obvious care. Then Sherlock lifts a towel-wrapped Violet up out of the water, and hands her to him. Violet puts her thin arms around his neck and holds on tight, happily trusting, while Sherlock finds her a clean outfit.
“We’re not just
He texts Sherlock, “Want me to pick up something for dinner? J”
John stares, transfixed, at the crown of Sherlock’s head between his legs.
John laughs. It’s the last thing he hears.
The next week, Mycroft goes to Baker Street, sits down on the sofa, and Sherlock wordlessly curls up behind him and leans in to bond.
Sherlock tries not to show any outward signs of annoyance. These vapid explanations are par for the course in a television show. Also, John is sitting next to him.
John goes to therapy and doesn’t say anything worth saying. John sits in his bedsit and doesn’t do anything worth doing. His blog remains empty. So does his life.
Mycroft is very much aware that they are not alone. But in the busy swirl of the dance floor, the low lights, and the sheer nature of the moment... Mycroft briefly kisses John. The touch of John’s lips does not feel sinful. Just pleasant, full of kindness and heat.
Jim grins widely. Mike attempts not to smile, but it’s a close call.
Mike takes a breath and says, “My vote is for Soo Lin’s Medusa. It was original and beautiful work. Thereby judges have decided: the best tattoo of the day goes to Soo Lin.”
“You, cheering? All right, deal, I’d love to see that. J”
“No, just drop me off there.” Sherlock dismisses his waiting taxi. He can look through the records again, and Lestrade can locate the brother.
Sherlock sees the gleam in the soldier’s eyes while he’s allowing himself to be observed.
Mycroft reaches out to help, and John turns his hand, a bit surprised that he would. Mycroft clasps it carefully, his long fingers skilful on the leather band. John can feel his slight touch.
John is on his old bed. He hasn’t slept there in months. He’s pretending to be doing something on his laptop, but he immediately looks up, tense. Sherlock says, “You were affected by the hormones.”
They sit close together and eat, but they don’t talk much. Janine’s having lunch with her client; they can hear them talk together, something about stealing van Eyck’s Adoration of the Mystic Lamb. Janine laughs loudly.
Mycroft had assumed that John knew already from their conversation on the phone. But no, John does not, Mycroft can tell looking at him now. Neither does Sherlock, he seems, if possible, even more anxious than John is.
By next year, there could be a little kid in his arms that’s
Sherlock’s smile has a soft side that John feels he could fall into, and never let go.
With Sherlock, all of this. What does he think is going to happen?
Mike counts down, “Three, two, one... Start your tattoos!”
Mycroft can feel Sherlock’s words stab him.
And then there is a sound in the hall. Quick, sure footsteps, with the thud of a cane accompanying them. Sherlock jumps up, marches to the door and throws it open.
Sherlock says, trying to sound like him, “The legwork,
Bainbridge shouts, “Yeah, man!”
But they have to get that back. They have to find a way.
“...Right. Well, this is Violet.”
So it’s not that, either.
John is different. John looks at him, too, and Mycroft hopes that John will not say anything more, there is no reason to do so. He is relieved when John simply holds out his hand. “Mycroft.”
Mary comes over, her voice full of concern, and he claims something – pain, need to go, Rosie needs a nap – John doesn’t even know what he says. He waves at everyone on the way out, feeling like there’s not a breath left inside his chest. Feeling like he might throw up, if he were to think on it.
John’s aware that he’s out of place here, carrying the shopping. Dripping onto the furniture. His wet shoes sink into the deep carpet, and he rustles his bags loud enough that some of the geriatric men look up from their newspapers and brandies, and frown at the intrusion.
“Yeah.” John sighs. “That’s not always…” He looks away. “Easy.” He sounds frustrated.
The wind and exertion are making John’s face seem flushed and young. John is holding onto his arm steadily. And Sherlock, not sure why he’s doing it, steps closer on the uneven tiles, leans in, and kisses him.
Mycroft’s face changes into a tired smile, and he bends over to take her in his arms. “Hello, my Violet.”
At times, he wishes that he had never done so.
John walks closer; aware he’s hooked on this - this feeling, whatever it is. There’s no getting away from it. John looks at Sherlock’s mouth as if his eyes are drawn there. “Morning.”
John smiles.
Mycroft watches William. His small face is slack in sleep. His open mouth makes a soft ‘o’ as he breathes. His eyelashes are visible, as well as the soft rose hue of his cheeks. Sometimes it still hits him that he has a
“You can draw a chart.” John speeds his hand up, he leans forward, and then slows it again. “The case of the horny doctor.” He’s kind of amusing himself, really.
If they have to.
“You designed it like a tattoo artist would. It’s a logo; it could fit in anywhere. Could be on a wall, or a train, or a t-shirt,” Mike notes with a tone of approval.
John remembers doing this on his stomach with James over him. Or on his knees, too. He should turn around, but he can’t, not anymore. Or not without pain, anyway. Yet another thing that doesn’t work the same way without a
Sherlock steps outside, and tries hard not to notice John’s startled gasp when he pushes past him. He walks up the stairs. It must be in John’s room. It has to be.
The first night they have him in Baker Street, Sherlock is more awake than William is. He is practically jumping out of bed as soon as William makes a sound. John barely gets to touch William - and even then it’s under Sherlock’s constant supervision.
Sherlock puts his hand on John’s shoulder, and strokes it lightly. John doesn’t fight the pull of orgasm, he smells alpha, shudders, and comes all over his fingers.
Once there, Mycroft closes the door behind them and John immediately pulls him in and kisses him again. Mycroft replies in kind. He finds himself to be more eager than he has allowed himself to feel.
The rain has stopped, for now. Spring even seems to be in the air, with momentary sunshine brightening the wet pavement and the distant skyscrapers. But there are still heavy rainclouds near the edge of the sky.
Sherlock rewards him with a small, electrifying grin.
And now he has a child. And because of it, he has Sherlock, and John.
, and he can hear himself shout, “Ah!” entirely without meaning to.
He says, “You’ll have a son, John.”
John is pretending to fall asleep on accident, and Sherlock will never, ever let him know that he knows, because it is glorious to lie there, listening to John’s faint snores. To Violet’s fast breaths, her occasional whine. And then fall asleep himself, with both of them there. Sherlock treasures it.
Her name is Emmy. Or that’s what she tells him.
He is right. Sherlock has thought it, too. He has just been postponing it, because he likes sleeping like this. With Violet, the bed feels so warm and full.
Maybe he’ll just go without then, John thinks. Maybe that’s been enough now. He can ignore it.
“Why?”
Lestrade coughs and laughs, seemingly thinking it’s
John had said, “All right, sure,” when Sherlock asked him to come along. But it’s something else to file into Mycroft’s car and to actually do it. Go home.
An obsessive personality isn’t unusual in an addict, Sherlock considers. Did he have help?
Mycroft thinks then that it might be better for Violet, if he fails at this. Only children tend to be more intelligent. And there is a limit on his time, perhaps it will be better spent if all of his energy can go to only one child.
“And you’re bonding again then?”
Sherlock tries to sound put-upon. “Of course.”
He doesn’t try again.
John’s heard clients make a low moaning sound when Sherlock walks up to them. He has seen them whimper, and get goose bumps when Sherlock deduces them. Sherlock pretends not to notice, although John’s sure that he does. He just doesn’t care, that’s it.
That’s the worst thing he could do.
There is a painting on the wall of a dog. Not theirs. Mummy put it there.
John carefully lifts a sleeping Violet off the sofa, wraps her in a blanket, and then carries her down the stairs for Mycroft.
Sherlock goes home, hides the folder on top of Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen cupboards, and walks upstairs to see Violet and John.
A slight hesitation. “No.”
“I would like to monitor you, and then we’ll evaluate in fifteen minutes.”
Sherlock pushes out, “Yes.” John’s weight is making it hard to breathe. His head pounds in time with his blood rushing there.
With one hour to go, Soo Lin has completely finished drawing the body of the dragon on one side and the back of the car, but she has not started on the other side. Sherlock dislikes the simple task of colouring, but he assists her in what he believes is a particularly selfless move. He is not thanked for it by Soo Lin, but they do finish what they set out to do.
And so is the job, now.
“It’s all over you.”
Sherlock glances up. Now Molly mentioned it, he can feel the edge of it again. Suppressing it is a reflex, but one that irritates and distracts him.
John bends his forehead to Sherlock’s shoulder, and breathes into his coat. The ground is hard and wet and it’s dirty. Sherlock’s hand isn’t nearly slow enough and sort of hurts, actually, he’s not
What? “I do not owe you
Sherlock nods. He knew his work was superior. But it is pleasing to hear them say so. Now he simply needs to recreate this success, and he will win the entire competition. He is capable of it. He merely needs to prepare his designs well and execute them impeccably.
John looks Sherlock in the eye, and says, “I do.”
Which is why Mycroft takes his phone, and selects a picture that John has sent him of the birthday party. Violet is on his lap, and both of them are looking somewhere out of the frame with a similar seriousness.
Mycroft replies, “Shall we celebrate properly this Sunday? I can arrange for more appropriate patisserie. MH”
Sherlock steps outside, already feeling in his pocket for cigarettes that aren’t there. He can’t go out to buy some. Not tonight.
John puts his knife down, takes his drink, and admits, “Wish we didn’t have to talk about it.”
But it has always been a mere physical foolishness. A desire, exactly such as many have for someone inappropriate. Something never to be admitted, to be kept in a corner of his mind and never too closely examined. It was always meant to remain there.
“Fine, yeah, your carp.” They both linger in the smile. John’s not sure what he’s doing. It doesn’t matter. It feels good to just be here for a bit. “You were going to tell me about that Italian Mafia case.”
“I do.” John knows he’s right, of course he does. Mycroft seems decided on this. John is too, actually, but he says, knowing he’s pushing it, “I wish, though.”
John goes home feeling like he never dated Sherlock at all.
The registrar smiles and keeps on going, “...the beta
While John is nothing. A bloke who works in his wife’s shop.
It is high summer. Mycroft is well into his third trimester, and it is as incredible to know that he really made it this far, as it is tiring to actually have to live through it.
“Yes.” Very much so. Sherlock greatly prefers working on his own. Today, he will be able to show off his work and his skills in depth.
But now he needs help, to be steered and assisted in this, and the sheer vulnerability of it is despicable.
Sherlock leans over the soldier, and then wraps his hand around the soldier’s cock again. It rises to his touch. The soldier licks his lips. Sherlock moves his hand, fast, and his gaze turns to pure lust. He leans his head against the door, looks up at him, and simply breathes, showing him the arousal in his face so clearly.
Mycroft says, “Perhaps I was overly optimistic in planning this today.”
It has little to do with Mycroft himself.
But now he is planning his own wedding to John.
idea.” Sherlock continues, “Two options: either figuratively stencilling a dragon across the car, or transforming the entirety of the car into a dragon. I believe the second will impact the judges favourably, as they have expressed wanting us to think beyond the expected.”
Mycroft does visit Sherlock on the morning of the fourth implantation.
“Hey you.” John looks up from his work with a smile.
He only wakes up when the nurse to comes to change his bandage in the evening.
“I explained myself, caffeine is a useful tool.” Sherlock feels indignant. “You were lamenting your lack of decent coffee to Molly yesterday so I fixed…”
It’s well into the afternoon before John ignores the lingering headache, grabs a bin bag, and starts cleaning up. Some of the wrapping paper has travelled all the way into the bedroom, and the hall. He tries not to groan every time he bends over and his skull throbs.
So he aims a kiss at John’s cheek while John’s doing the dishes.
The moment seems to stretch, and John moves his thumb just a little lower, to the edge of Mycroft’s trousers. He can feel Mycroft shake under his fingers, barely perceptible. He’s not doing a thing to stop him, though. Not saying a word.
John sits close to him in the cab, which is a bit uncomfortable, but Sherlock doesn’t say anything. His mind is already on the type of killer most likely to leave notes. They haven’t had a proper serial killer in several years.
When he comes down completely after about a week, it is predictably brutal. Sherlock vomits, shivers, sweats, and his heart feels as if it will rip out of his chest. He sits on the windowsill, wrapped in the blanket, feeling too hot one moment and impossibly cold the next.
John thrusts into his hand. “Biting me?”
” and the laughter is obvious in his voice.
“Hm?” Sherlock frowns. “Don’t be stupid.” He looks back at the party. They can both hear the music bouncing through the glass doors.
Mycroft sighs. “I believe he is bored with his work?”
Sherlock looks at Mycroft with some disbelief,
And that is it. Mycroft should have known that it was coming. Perhaps he did know. Perhaps he has felt it in the sheer, quiet thrill of being around John for such a long time now. In the way that he has treasured John’s presence in each and every one of those memories.
The judges come around to each of them with the cameras in tow and have a look at their work. John tries to see what the others did, or at least hear their critiques. Raz did some lettering, and he gets a question from Mike, “You’re a self-taught tattoo artist?”
“Not on every occasion.” Sherlock stands and selects another cigarette out of the pack lying on the windowsill.
When John’s in the bathroom brushing his teeth, Sherlock takes John’s phone, checks, and sees that the last one is from a few days ago. It’s John saying, “Sherlock’s still asleep, I have Violet this afternoon, we’re going out, don’t want to wake him. JW” and Mycroft’s reply, “I imagine I will be there around six. MH”
Eventually, Sherlock sees what he was looking for. The soldier appears on the pavement and looks at Sherlock’s building. He briefly hesitates there, before he moves on while leaning heavily on his cane.
Sherlock can feel the old irritation rise to the surface now. “You were glad to go.” To leave me with
John wants to say ‘thank you’, but then he’s not sure if that’s it, really. Sherlock shouldn’t feel as if he has to watch him. It probably wasn’t too great for him, was it?
John’s eyes flicker over him, but then go back to Violet. She’s banging the bucket on the water now, splashing the other kids. John’s hand lets go.
Sherlock frowns. “They aren’t as effective as a real bond.”
He is reminded starkly why he never enjoyed being an omega - why the rushes of hormones in his youth were so very difficult on him, and why he built his character on control. He did so because it was a necessity to suppress his innate sentimentality and weakness.
Mycroft says, “I believe this child has a rather cruel disposition, as he so seems to like to lean against my bladder.” Violet was exactly the same.
Sherlock opens his eyes, and tries to be
Then John turns to him and asks, in a low voice, “You doing okay there?”
John nods, business-like. “You still using?”
In some way, Mycroft had thought that fact would only truly resound later on. That after the horror of childbirth and the exhaustion of a new baby and going back to work, it would be
But he finds it hard to talk to Violet the way Sherlock does. To connect to her in any meaningful way.
Sherlock can do what he wants. Whatever it is, John’s fine with it.
John scales the staircase. Step, thud. Step, thud. He needs to pull his leg along, but he’s moving as if he’s got something to prove, now. He’s charging in, cane and all.
“Not infatuation.” John stands there, on the threshold, hoping that it’s not too late. “Or not for me it wasn’t.”
“…Or you can keep on going.”
Mycroft is in his library, both considering the latest developments in North Korea as well as reading through some field reports from an agent in the United Arab Emirates, when he hears John enter.
“Yes, Regent’s Park, the circle the way she likes, first the ducks, and then the reeds, she picked one and carried it the whole way. We ran into the woman that feeds the herons, Violet’s a bit scared of them up close, but we sat down and watched for around twenty minutes.” Violet had been utterly fascinated. “I’ll take her to the pelicans in St. James’ Park tomorrow if it doesn’t rain.”
“All of it! The...” John doesn’t even want to say it, it’s obvious, he lowers his voice, “Yelling at you. Violet.”
But now it’s settled. Now, it’s all good again, and still John lies on his bed and touches himself.
“Well then.” John feels radical, sitting here with his cock out and covered in both of their come. As if he could say or do anything. “Better win tomorrow.”
Mycroft parries, “Why don’t you?”
“Lydia can write you a prescription for the injections.”
William yawns, and Mycroft can feel himself smile at his expression.
Mycroft would feel somewhat self-conscious if he did not see the clear amusement in John’s eyes, obviously inviting him to joke along. So he says, “Always a pleasure, John.”
Mycroft blinks at that, then frowns at him as if he is prepared to argue the point.
John texts Mycroft, “Wedding preparations all around up in here. I don’t even know what half this stuff is! Sherlock’s having fun though. J”
Sherlock, playing for them, and looking up occasionally with a soft, private smile. It doesn’t matter that it feels off, still, John wants to sleep with him tonight. To kiss him. And the thought that he might get to... it’s insane. It’s great.
Violet is too young to be bothered by the internet research, but still Sherlock tilts her head away from the screen.
“No, you did not say anything overly personal. It was all quite
And Sherlock wants to keep him like this. Close.
There are two trays with room service balanced on the small table between them, and several cigarette butts in the improvised ashtray by the window.
But the moment passes very quickly. John focuses on Violet, Mycroft talks to Sherlock, and then the guests are there.
John takes a deep breath. “Yeah, let’s go say hi to everyone.”
“You liked it. John kissing you.” Mycroft wasn’t pretending, Sherlock is almost certain of it. He’s never seen Mycroft look like that. Soft, in his pleasure.
Nothing that he cannot handle.
Then John is next to him, on his knees, grabbing the syringe. His presence is enough to make Sherlock shudder with desire, and his grip loosens before John even tries to take it from him.
“Of course.” Sherlock starts unbuttoning his shirt, then shrugs it off and puts it on John’s tattooing bench.
Mycroft is surprised that Sherlock would even think to come over and help him carry Violet, but instead Sherlock comes close, leans over him, and smells his neck. It is an odd greeting, but Mycroft still feels a small rush of warmth at it. He’s wearing his coat, so Sherlock presses his lips by the skin of his neck just where he can reach it, and Mycroft can feel a deep sense of rightness. Yes, this.
Mycroft closes his eyes and doesn’t move away. Sherlock doesn’t either.
John misunderstands, or maybe he does get it, because he puts his plate of food to the side, takes his hand, and steers him out of the room.
Anthea must have seen him looking, because she spares him a single glance that says quite clearly,
It would probably be wiser if he were not.
He doesn’t sound upset about that at all. Actually, he laughs at Violet.
“Heaven forbid.”
They leave their food mostly uneaten, and the drinks still full, but John doesn’t care. He knows Sherlock doesn’t, either. None of that matters, none of the pretence. John just wants to feel Sherlock’s body next to his own. That’s what he wants to do with every single hour of this last night.
