“I need to shave.” he mumbled.
"Hey, Dean relax!" Castiel walked over and shook his shoulders, trying to stay calm.
"Oh god no, my brothers mate calls him that." Dean couldn’t hold back a laugh.
"C-Cas what ‘r ya doin’." His voice was muffled by sleep and the pillow under him. "Are we still tied together." Dean didn't even make an effort at moving. Wiggling his ass a little he could feel the knot still buried into him filling him up and he felt Castiel’s weight move farther up his ass, readjusting himself..” Jesus if our cycles ever match up I'll be pregnant before the night if over." Cas chuckled and ran his hand down the now of Dean's spine.
"Like the big ass alpha Novaks?" Dean asked, yeah he's heard of them all high and mighty managed to have every pup to present as an alpha. It's almost impossible to have those odds. If only his pack had that record.
“Umm, well did you see anyone online who you liked?” Castiel asked twirling his thumbs on his bed. He was slightly hesitant to go to someone. What if Dean hates him after all of this? What if he hurts Dean in the process? No, Castiel just needed a little more time.
"Yes, we've been mated for well, longer than I'd like to admit." Dean blushed slightly.
“Asshole, now who is this mystery man?” She asked as they took their seats.
His nurse called him back quickly and her name tag read Brandi. It started off with a blood draw so the test could be run while the rest of his physical went.
"Oh yes please."
“Alright, I’ll get a few of these but only if I can dress you.” He purred.
He made it so Dean had dripped all over the bed and soaked through all the sheets to fill the room of his scent. Dean didn’t seem to mind, he loved slow sex sometimes and this was amazing for him, just giving over his body to Cas.
"Can you come here, and bring a toy I don't need to be knotted up in the shower." Castiel pulled himself up and huffed out laughter. Walking to Dean's bed he grabbed a green fake knot that was a little smaller than Castiel's. Dean was going to be hard to keep up with during his heat.
"You're brother's an omega? Wait, you're related to Alfie?" It was now just clicking into place what he said.
“Like super alpha pack, Novaks?”
"Fuck, Dean." Castiel bit out between clenched teeth as he pushed in. "So god damn perfect." He hissed once he bottomed out. Dean let out a deep sigh of content once Castiel filled him up.
"I'll get a few of these." He gestured to his outfit. "If you get a few of those." He then pointed at Castiel's. A large smile formed on Castiel's lips.
"Yes, it will at least be a little less appealing to other alphas. Not all, but some." Dean looked at him with confused eyes his mouth hung open.
"It's a hell of a story, much too long and rather boring." Dean just smiled and nodded.
"I’ll see you guys in a few." Gabriel walked back down the hallways and to his bedroom.
"Yeah, they can be intimidating. Anna likes you so that's good and so do Gabriel and Beckett." Dean smiled at Beckett's name. She was a sweet pup, he knew why Castiel loved her so much.
“It’s just-” Dean paused, he couldn’t tell him. “I’m so damn stressed over school and I guess I’ve been having trouble sleeping.” God, Dean hated lying to Cas, he was the one person he shouldn’t lie to. Dean was just so good at it, unless it came to his mother, God, if she was questioning him he wouldn’t have lasted five minutes before she drilled it out of him. She looks like a sweet old apple pie mother but she has a strong head on her shoulders and a stubborn attitude. Something she passed on to all three of her kids.
“Okay, settle down Fido, you have to save you energy for when I kick you ass.” Castiel stepped back and raised an eyebrow shaking his head. He let Dean go from the wall with on last marking. They both walked over to their dressers to change into tighter workout clothes. Under Armour shorts that clung to every powerful muscle on Castiel’s runner’s thighs. Dean glanced up and smiled.
Castiel took a deep breath. Dean was not his mate. Dean was not his mate. Dean was an omega who could make his own choices and if he didn't want to ever see Castiel again he couldn't do a thing about it. Cas knew deep down the mated part of him yearned for Dean and he knew parts of Dean yearned for Cas. It was confusing and messy but it wasn't real. It was a deal, they had a contract and everything. Taking another breath Castiel looked back towards the front and tried to catch back up with the lecture.
Cas smiles “Yeah, now I have you.”
"When can I expect pups? You don't smell bred up yet. I want to know when I’m getting my first grandpups.” That comment made Dean's face turn red with anger. His first? What was Beckett, did they not count her? It took all of Dean’s self control not to lunge across the table and rip out Azazel's throat.
"You said vanilla was lame." Cas said crossing his arms, looking smug.
Castiel dressed at record speed and ran out of the dorm. There was no way Dean was pregnant, by the time he delivered they wouldn't be in college anymore but this was all too much, too soon. Dean was right they needed some time to settle in before starting a family. Maybe not a lot, but some. They needed jobs and a home and a baby would hold them back from that. Castiel stumbled as the thought crossed his mind. Especially since omegas usually carry litters and rarely have one pup. He was queasy as he walked into the store. The air was stale and it was rather empty. Castiel quickly made his way to the right aisle and scanned the shelves. There was an assortment of all different tests in all kinds of colors. With wide eyes, Castiel grabbed six different tests and headed for the register. The orange-haired beta male looked at him with amusement.
“My dad’s got your back, so’s my mom. No need to get your feathers ruffled. Plus since Sam and I already know...and Adam we got you.”
“Well, what about the day before?” Crowley pushed stepping slightly closer to pull Dean in, but he responded by backstepping to give him more space. Red flags went up and Dean was thinking of ways to get out. Years of training and it was as if he was blanking. "Dean, what do you do when you are grabbed?"
“Bring a jacket, it’s cold out.” Dean called over his shoulder as Cas tried to get his hair under control.
1) The sex in the car was completely consensual, just wanted to clear that up. I tried to make that clear in the chapter.
2) Castiel has had many years to work through his past even though it still haunts him with bottoming it doesn't effect his feelings towards topping. He has no painful memories of that and topping with Dean has always been of his own free will.
“Cas?” Dean asked rubbing his eyes and sitting up against the headboard, he still had his nightshirt and boxers on since he was too tired for sex last night. His work was piling up now that he was more reluctant to leave the dorm. Dean wasn’t an easy person to shake, he had faced off alphas in bar brawls but the feeling he got every time he left the dorm alone had him panicking. It had him thinking of the private self-defense lessons his father put him through, Scenarios of being attacked kept flashing in front of his eyes, and the proper reaction he was taught became a mantra that played on repeat. Even when it was daylight out and he was walking to class there was a terrible vibe creeping just out of his view and it chilled him down to his bones.
Dean moved in closer and started scenting Cas's neck. Dropping his book he stuttered. The hot breath on his neck stalled his train of thought, Dean’s hands trailed under his shirt to trace at his stomach. Castiel’s breath caught in his throat. Dean brought his hand up to Castiel’s chest and shoved him down.
"Cas, cool it my family isn't uptight. You have already met Jo." Dean took the two shirts from Castiel's hands that he was choosing between and tossed them back into the closet. "Can't believe I'm saying this babe, we're going shopping." Dean hated shopping, or so he told everyone.
“We need to slow this bleeding or he will be dead before the medics even get here.” Automatically Dean pulled off his shirt and thrust it into the officer’s hands. Nodding he placed firm pressure onto Castiel’s abdomen. He heard his exhale a pained breath.
"Dean!" That same accent startled him into a slight jump. "My God, what are you a squirrel. Mighty skittish there mate." Crowley placed a seriously unwelcome hand on his shoulder but apparently didn't notice the death stare he was receiving from Dean.
"Well I've already stunk up everything." Dean shot.
"Woah, you’re sure happy to see me," Dean said with a chuckle.
"That's good, can't imagine living down here my whole life." Castiel can feel Dean's sudden discomfort. He offered comfort to his mate with a soothing kiss to his temple.
The omega trade was something Dean had known about since he presented and fully became aware of what he was in the rankings but besides his dad and his speeches, he was never really affected by the matter. Judging by Crowley and his set up this was a lucrative business for him. He could only imagine how many other omegas sat in this chair, how many shipped out, some to never see their mates again.
“But doctor!” Castiel took his free hand to shush his ‘patient’
After he washes himself and the shower down he douses the bathroom in air freshener and cracked both windows over his and Castiel's bed.  Hopefully ridding the room of that alpha smell also. It was odd, Dean didn't hate Cas he just didn't care to be around a Novak alpha. That lead to an awkward living situation, like sleeping with a stranger.
"Sorry I've been so, absent lately."
“I was drugged and dragged here, Cas- he came after me and,” Dean stopped he couldn’t be the reason Castiel was dying right now he absolutely refused. He just leaned his forehead into Castiel’s hair and inhaled. Grass, trickling water, fresh linens. He held onto the scent. One he used to hate with every fiber of his being. He would open the windows to rid himself of the smell and now it was the only thing keeping him grounded.
“DEW.” Castiel blurted out.
"We really did."
"Mom!" Anna snapped at her from beside Dean and Castiel was holding back a snarl.
"Thanks for coming!" Castiel almost chuckled at the statement. It wasn't meant that way but god would he love to. Dean would probably want him to leave once he dropped off his stuff. What's he going to do barge into Alfie's place to jack off in his shower?
Dean placed on hand on the shower wall and the other knotted into Castiel’s hair who purred with satisfaction. Dean was already heating up and he knew this was not going to last as long as he had expected it to. And once that thought left his mind he had one hand gripping the tile and the other matted in Castiel’s hair. Castiel slid his fingers behind Dean's balls and lightly pressed at his entrance. "Yes, now!" Castiel gave a satisfied chuckle with Dean's dick still completely shoved into his mouth. In a swift movement, Castiel was knuckle deep in his omega who purred like a cat.
Dean really isn’t always this nasty, his brother Sammy is a great guy and he’s an alpha, he just doesn't like alpha status packs who look down on others. Dean has a feeling anyone from the alpha Novak pack will have just those views.
"You needed me?" Alfie asked wiping a little sweat from his brow "sorry I was in the back before sorting out heavy boxes."
Dean cocooned Castiel and started to kiss his neck.
"Wait, like your dad? He knows you're an omega!" Jo was practically shouting and he knew Bobby and Ellen could hear her.
His favorite ham and cheese with the crust cut off and a large glass of milk. Like every day she was greeted with an over-excited smile and dove into his food.
It seemed that no matter what he did it was never enough. He would still be drugged, raped, and sold. It seemed that no matter what he did that was his future.
"Not like that Dean, I don't treat omegas as second class citizens. I was just saying I don't have any voice in your choices nor do I have the right to present any, protective alpha status." Castiel was looking out the window as he spoke, not wanting to threaten Dean with unneeded eye contact.
"Okay, I'll be there and uh yeah he did he's my um, mate." Castiel was nervous on how Dean would react but he only seemed curious on their conversation.
Dean switched his weight from foot to foot as he watch Castiel change, it was slight, his eye’s were a blackened topaz with patches of swirled blue around the edge and under his eyes darkened slightly, Castiel was fierce. It did something odd to him, he wasn’t totally sure if he liked it.
“And really what could you call me, little alpha? totally unoriginal and that just sounds odd” Castiel chuckled but the second he saw the smile on Dean’s face he regretted opening his mouth.
"You bit me, again!" Dean was startled but not angry like he was before.
“What is your favorite color?” Dean was slowly walking towards Cas.
"N-no, Cas stay!" They both froze. "Because um, maybe your smell will keep the alphas away." Castiel gave Dean an odd look but eventually agreed. He took a seat on his bed and watched Dean look through everything. Dean obviously wasn’t thinking clearly but as long as he was just sitting here it shouldn’t be a problem.
"That's just sick, how do you live here?" Dean asked as he made himself comfortable on the sofa.
"Please don't go." Dean tensed at the door and bit his lip.
“Gotcha.” Cas whispered before he tried to pull himself up. It was a friendly game, no harsh tackling mainly tagging or grabbing them. Grabbing Castiel hand he was hoisted up and handed the alpha the ball.
"Dean are you really that upset? You do know we have a café, right?"
"Yeah?" Cas asked pushing himself up on his elbow to look down at Dean.
"Come one." He said as he tugged at Dean's t-shirt. Dean only lifted him arms slightly and Cas tugged the shirt off of him. Placing the tips of his fingers on Dean's chest he pushed him back into the bed and started working off his pants. Tugging each leg out he motioned for Dean to move farther up in the bed. Dean fumbled as he tried to get himself in the dead center. He was wearing his gray briefs. Castiel climbed over Dean and straddled his hips
“You think I’ll find someone with this mark?”
"I couldn’t tell anyone.”  He said helplessly “I wouldn’t have gotten any sympathy from my parents anyway, they'd have kicked me out for letting her do it.”
"We made such a perfect pup." Mary cooed as she rocked Dean gently.
"Yeah, yeah." Dean dug through his wallet and change pile pulling out the exact change and placing it in the woman's small hand.
"Leavin' already?" Dean groaned and rolled over to the edge of the bed.
"Nah man I just mean he's just a little guy. Smallest alpha I've ever seen."
“I may spoiler her.” Castiel admitted sheepishly.
Alright Chapter 3 updates after Supernatural on March 18th! See you then!
"Jealous?" John repeated.
"That was Rachel, she would have been here for hours and we need to talk." Dean gave him a questioning look and walked over to sit in Castiel's bed.
Cas rested his his hands on Dean’s hips as he took in short gasps, Dean’s walls clenched around his cock. He lowered his hands to trace shapes into Dean’s bare thighs and dip into the crease of his groin. Dean just dipped his head back and moaned as Castiel mapped out every inch of him, the way his muscles twitched under soft fingers. Oh, how goosebumps arose across his arms with every stroke.
"Shoot!" Dean crushed Castiel's scissors. A shit-eating grin spread over his face.
So I hope this chapter was much happier than last weeks painful experience.
"Yes, he's my twin. But Dean if you don't mind, we need to take care of your heat," And before Dean could yell at him he added "not with me! There is an omega mart across campus. I'll get you some things."
“Oh, geez, I’m sorry I just got excited.” Dean curled up in front of Cas, using light touches to sooth Cas’ aching dick. “I’m sorry.” Cas’ face went from pain to pleasure.
Dean’s jaw was extended as far as it could go and his lips hurt from being stretched so far but he waited for Castiel’s first load to finish before he skillfully unknotted his mouth. He looked at Castiel who watched him with half-lidded eyes and a blissed-out smile. Leaning in slowly to palm Dean’s erection but the omega pushed him away.
“Keep your eyes on the road.” Cas scolded, biting his lips to keep from smiling. He could taste Dean’s salty breath on his mouth like it was burned into his skin. They were both quiet as the track changed to “Moby Dick.” Cas reached to change it and Dean swatted his hand. “Oh come on it’s, like, fifteen minutes of instrumental!”
"Uh, yeah I guess I just get so caught up in everything and it just comes naturally." They were laying chest to chest sharing body heat and small laughs. Dean's cum was drying on their stomachs but neither of them minded.
Cas was starving. He rubbed his eyes, which were blurring up over the top of his text book. He’d been at this all morning, getting no where. Accepting defeat he pushed back his chair to see Dean dozing off while reading on his bed. "Hey Dean." He said. Dean didn't stir, just buried his nose deeper into his book. "Dean!" Cas quietly crept over to Dean’s side kneeling next to his head. He carefully slipped the book out from under Dean’s head. Remarkably, Dean stayed asleep. Cas set the book aside looking at Dean’s sleeping form, he looked so… He’s just so… There’s no other word for it Dean was absolutely beautiful. Cas never knew that a man could be beautiful, and none as beautiful as Dean. There was a pang deep in his heart over the thought of the upcoming end of the year. The weight on his chest of their impending separation was practically unbearable. While Dean was sleeping, Cas could pretend they were deeply in love. Cas reached forward and ran his fingers through Dean’s short hair, and to Cas’ pleasant surprise Dean leaned into the touch. After a moment Dean snorted awake jerking away from Cas’ hand.
“Nah, you’re pretty good in bed.” Dean chuckled and looked back down at his shoes. It was quiet for a few seconds as Cas mustered up the courage to speak.
"Son of a bitch nailed me." Dean pointed at the still red bite mark on his neck.
"Well that's good because I like your uncle too." Dean took this chance to lean in and press their noses together. Beckett giggled again and help his face in her small hands.
"You will get at least three STD's by stepping foot in there," Sam said without a joking face. Castiel’s eyes widened and continued on their walk.
Castiel received hugs by people named Ash and Ellen even a semi-reluctant one by a man named Bobby. It was odd how openly affectionate the pack was towards him. Just the simple title as Dean’s mate and he was immediately accepted. The one person he hadn’t seen was Dean’s father.
“Like a band-aid, Cas.” Castiel gave a small smile and took Dean’s hand. How horrible could it really be?
The walk back to the dorm seemed like hours and the second Dean hit the bed he wanted to sleep.
"Yeah, yeah go brush your teeth and then we can leave." Cas pushes Dean towered the bathroom and grabbed his bag and his jacket. Once Dean emerged they headed out towards the parking lot. It was terribly cold outside especially in the early hours of the morning. Winter was just around the corner and so was Christmas and midterms. Thanksgiving was spent with Chinese food and half ass excuses texted towards their family so they would probably have to give in for the nearing holiday.
“Suppressants are great in short doses, usually used six to nine months at a time with three month break periods. Some omegas use them without the break period and say it’s unnecessary to stop. That is false, if you don’t take break periods you body becomes immune to them. They become utterly useless and your body goes back into it normal heat cycle. Then you are left with no way to supress your heat.”  Dean was watching with wide eyes and a gaping mouth. She continued on but it fell on deaf ears, Dean was still trying to process what she had just said.
Shrugging Dean went downstairs to find food. He couldn't hide from Castiel's family forever and if all they could do was shame him for being an omega...well
Dean's ears perked up at the sound of laughter in the hallway.
“Oh well.” Cas winked.
“Yes, about you assbutt.” Cas sighed “Tell me something about you.”
"I know, he has just gotten a lot of shit over it and well it's my instinct to defend him." Cas sighed opening up his notebook.
"Oh thank god! Now get your pee stick out of my face and kiss me!" Dean dropped the test and captured Castiel's lips. "Dean, I feel like I'm going to pass out!" Castiel laughed and dropped to his knees pulling up Dean's shirt and kissing his stomach. "Thank you, just wait a little longer." He mumbled into Dean's stomach as he trailed kisses across his soft skin. Dean let out a sigh and laughed. Castiel moved down to his hips and went to unbutton his jeans.
"I  wanna go home." His voice was so broken. Mary brought him to the car and sat in the back with him. The ride home was silent. He didn't see his father for two days after that. Dean barely left his room. He will never forget how his father looked at him, he failed him. He always failed him.
Both men smiled at their stories and their past, Dean bumped Castiel’s shoulder just before they reached his class.
Dean woke up slowly, not really registering where he was. All he knew was he was totally blissed out and he had a warm body nuzzled on top of him. He tried to move his arms but they felt like jelly, slowly he pushed the mass off of him and gave a small whimper as Cas’ knot that wasn’t fully down slid out of him with only slight resistance. But before Dean could move any further a pair of strong arms wrapped around his stomach and pulled him down with a growl.
"No actually I, um, I have to pick some stuff up first, so yeah see you in class." At that Dean's walked away as fast as possible towards the science building that was directly across from where he needed to go.
Standing back up after he unpacked his bag and claimed the table as his he went in search of his books and a vending machine. The library was fairly busy and the mumbling of conversations could be heard all over the building. It was a very neutral area since it was the only library on campus it had alpha, betas, and omegas in it at all times. There was an omega side of campus but there are mixed dorms across. Dean's is just in one of the few buildings unmated omegas aren't allowed in since there is such a large number of alphas. This wasn't a college that if you were an omega you had to be escorted by your mate. It had a good amount of security and somewhat strict rules. It was a more new-age school and omegas were treated very well here.
"Obviously you don't want to be on the omega side of campus right?" Dean looked at Cas questionably but nodded slowly.
Dean raised an eyebrow and made a 'no shit' face at Cas through the mirror.
"What now we're going into my past?" He paused to question whether or not he should go on. "Yes, I'm from the Novak pack. Yes a majority of them are fucking assholes. No, I am not one of them. My twin Samandriel and I don’t share their views. I know what selfish alphas do to an omega." He added that last part with as much venom and bitterness as he could. Castiel paused again.
"Gabriel, Anna, and I are his siblings and best friends and I have never seen him act like he does with you, ever. He looks at you like you have the most interesting things to say, your banter back and forth, the damn goofy smile he has. It's just a side of my brother I really haven't seen before. Especially in the past six or seven years." Dean raised an eyebrow and cocked his head slightly, placing his cup down from the sip he was about to take.
“Adam knows?”
“Oh shut it.” Castiel closed the curtain and Dean waited for him to emerge again. It took him a little longer but when he came out Dean was nearly drooling. It was an entire outfit a navy blue t-shirt with a blue-white and brown plaid pullover dark ripped jeans and work boots.
"You’re going to die out there with long sleeves. Why not wear one of my shirts today? It’s too hot to wear a button-up. " Castiel eyed Dean at the suggestion and slowly nodded. He accepted the dark brown V-neck. Dean had the honor of unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt and he pulled it over his head. Dean's clothes were always so soft, they were worn and washed and they smelt like him.
Tangling his hands in Castiel’s dark hair he ravished his neck and sucked dark bruises across his shoulder. As Castiel picked up speed he felt pressure build in his stomach, he couldn’t remember the last time they took it this slow.
“Well, when I win,” Dean paused thinking “I want to see you in my panties and i want you to roll over for me. I want you to be the submissive one for a night.” Castiel was surprised, Dean wanted him to act like an omega for him.
"Oh god no, not like that! He just wanted someone to talk to through the door and until he found a mate. So that meant me, Anna or Alfie."
"Bring it, I'll kick your ass. Not a great way to start off your high school career." Sam laughed because they all knew Dean could and would kick their butts. "And guys remember, I'm a beta." Their smiles all dropped and they nodded. It was their family secret, one that Mary hated. But Sam and Adam knew that they never spoke a word of it. Didn't even talk about it with Dean. They respected Dean. Loved him.
“Lillith, that’s the best idea you had had all day.” Dean shot daggers at both the wolves and shoved past the alpha to the stairs that lead into a formal dining area. Dean had walked through here before when Anna was pushing him into the kitchen. The same yellowish paint flowed into here. A massive mahogany table sat in the middle of the room with ten chairs and ten ornate place settings. Each setting had a cup and a wine glass. Four large floor to ceiling windows brought in all the light that was needed to brighten the room. He rejoined Ann and Castiel who were waiting for him. Dean let out a shaken breath as he looked around.
They made their way into the common area of the dorm and Rachel looked around rather impressed.
"Dean!" She chirped and ran full force into Dean's arms. The second he held the pup in his arms all his rage crashed down and his stomach twisted. She wrapped her legs around Dean's waist and gave Dean a toothy smile. He slowly slid down the wall until he was sitting down, keeping his knees up to support Beckett who had her legs in either side of Dean's hips.
“Castiel, who is this stunning man you have?” Anna asked extending her hand offering her scent to Dean. Dean looked between the two for a second before he stepped forward and gave her a hug. She smelt so sweet, fresh rain in spring with honeysuckle and daisies. Nothing like the strong smell of alpha leaking from the doorway, but she was in fact an alpha. She had a soothing smell, like Cas. That made Dean relax a little, and he pressed in a little harder to take in another breath of her scent. Dean relied on scent to tell the personality or the overall emotion of a person, it was much harder to scent out beta’s unless they were part of your pack. It was an extremely important skill, especially when meeting a new pack.
Dean was very quiet this morning but Castiel didn't push it. Dean's mind was elsewhere and Castiel knew it wasn't his place to demand things from the man no matter how badly he would like to fix it. Dean left an hour early for his class, leaving Cas alone in the dorm.
Castiel quickly collected himself and followed Dean down the stairs to find a large portion of Dean’s, or his, pack was missing.
Once they reached Castiel's room Dean tore open the bag and jumped into Castiel's bed.
"Yes, they are in recovery now, the nurse will lead you." The man who approached him gave him a smile and gestured for him to follow.
“Every day. Every fucking day I’d- I’d-” Cas dropped to his knees hugging himself and crying. “I’d wish I was dead, or she was dead, I’d wish it, Dean!”
“No, Cas I was just sleeping because there was nothing good on TV.” Dean grumbled sitting up. Castiel faltered slightly, maybe Dean wasn’t interested.
Hallelujah, there is a God.
Holy shit I'm alive! Yes I sassbuttcasbutt have risen from the dead to give you the gift of a chapter I am not very proud of but a chapter none the less!!! I promise they get better so stay with me! This one isn't edited because Emile is busy with college and I didn't want to make you wonderful people wait any longer!
Dean arrived shortly after Sam left and distributed the drinks, he, of course, had his normal black.
"Yeah like I'm the most eligible bachelor in Kansas. Can’t even have sex without self-lubricating." Dean huffed obviously upset.
They registered as mated at the main campus building and Dean had to come out and complain that he was wrongly put down as a beta and would like to be registered as an omega. Since he had been registered as a beta from the beginning a few strings had to be pulled by Castiel but they managed to come out with no problem. They did had to attend a mandatory Sex ED class. All register mates in college must attend it since normal people start their pack within a few months of mating.  Dean’s odd pull towards Cas went away with his heat and he was finally starting to feel like himself again. He was still somewhat mad over the dilemma but he didn’t blame Castiel much anymore, Dean wasn’t in his right mind that night either. It wasn’t like Castiel cornered him like Alistair tried to do.
"My race track and-and dad said when he comes home he would play," Dean spoke with such excitement it made Mary glow with happiness. Dean was her world. Every smile he gave her made her day, he was always her number one priority and she wondered how he would feel when it wasn't just him. The flutter in her stomach made her think of the future and the two pups that would join them in only a few weeks.
Looking at the toy in his hand he looked back at Dean and smiled. Lowering himself down to his knees he felt the warm water splash at his back as he pulled Dean's cheeks apart and licked from Dean's sack to his tight ass, slick sliding into Castiel's eager tongue.
"Unprepared, little omega?" Castiel asked holding out a piece of paper and a pen.
“I don’t think not wanting to run into a fire is emasculating, I mean who really does that? Crazy people.”
He took the steps two at a time and shoved his key into the lock, thank the absent gods he was alone. Stripping down he turned the shower on and jumped in. Dean gasped at how the ice water bit at his skin and paralyzed his ability to breath. His skin finally cooled off enough for him to jump out after a quick rubdown with soap. He wanted to get out before Cas got back so he threw on a clean pair of pajamas and opened the window over his bed and tried some deep breathing. He decided to spend the rest of the day at home. He only got through about three ACDC songs until Castiel was back. Dean was clenching his fists and praying that the room smelt normal. Of course the look of confusion on his face meant Dean still stunk up the room with his assortment of omega smells.
Castiel was already hard, that was just the effects of rut, breed breed breed.
Castiel couldn't hold back his laughter and fold over on himself. Hands braced on the dashboard.
"There's a hotel not far from here." He said quietly "I don’t want to drive in this weather, and since we're early anyway-" his voice died out. Mentioning their early leave made both of them a little uncomfortable.
"Shush, don’t worry about that Dean. We are in college right now, no rush for pups yet." Leaning down Castiel placed soft kisses along Dean's mating mark. Dean decided not to further the conversation. He should just enjoy the view of the forest and the scent of his mate
Dean wanted a pup like her, he craved one, for he and Cas to raise and love and nurture. Dean knew exactly why Castiel loved this little girl so much and why he was so protective of her. He stood up for her life against his family and if those alpha had won Dean wouldn't have this moment right now. This moment of realization that he wanted a family and soon. He has never wanted to get out of college faster.
“Cas, it’s just my phone.” He pulled it out of his pocket and dangled it in front of Castiel. The caller ID said ‘Mary’ Dean light up at that.
"A little game never hurt anyone," Castiel responded, already feeling too hot and confined by the shower.
"No, you have no use to go there, finish your workbook online and I'll be back before one."
"Balth, you home?" Gabriel emerged from the hallway with only a pair of sweats slung low around his waist. "Oh, hello Dean."  Gabriel had a smile on his face as he walked from the hallway into the main room. Dean sat at the base of them steps that was also dead center to the huge kitchen/living room/dining room. "Where is Cas?" Gabriel looked around the room as if his brother was hiding on him. He chose to ignore Dean’s red eyes and the fact his daughter was playing Dr.Phil.
"Yeah totally I agree completely." It was true, they did have time. Why shouldn’t Dean enjoy his last year of college?
“What is it Castiel?”
"That is either a really good or a totally horrible thing, man." The cashier joked but Castiel was completely not up for it. He gave a small growl and the man quickly rang him up.
“Hey, down boy he was mind first.” Castiel knew she was joking but he felt an alpha flair in him but pushed it away knowing Dean wouldn’t want them fighting.
"I'm not addicted to sex." Castiel said matter-o-fact. "Just your sex." He finished sheepishly. They both fell into laughter and exchanged soft kisses and scented each other without really knowing they were doing it. Like a natural instinct to reinforce their mating bond...even if they didn't really have one.
"Mmmm, baby fuck me so good." Driving faster Castiel frantically pushed himself deeper craving the feeling of Dean's hot body wrapped around him.
Castiel could laugh, or dance, or hell, even sing. He wanted to hurry and finish packing so he could warm up to Dean and get a few more hours of sleep. Sleeping in a bed with Dean was always amazing but there was a new element added to this, he always had a pull towards Dean but since the mating was completed his body was running off a crazy high and all he wanted was Dean.
"He's my twin, he's no pup."
I hope you all like this chapter!
"Dean, where have you been? I've been calling you." The man was obviously distressed and Dean knew this would throw Cas into a frenzy.
Once he was upstairs he followed the sound and the smell of his alpha was at his nose, fresh-cut grass, and copper. Something was wrong, very very wrong. Castiel was here somewhere and that made the sound of the gunshot all the more horrifying. As quickly and quietly as he could he slipped through the empty dining room and found the backdoor open. Crowley’s meager form stood under a dim yellow porch light. He talking out into the darkness and Dean took his chance to attack from behind. Pulling the rope out of his pocket he held it taut as he snuck through the dilapidated kitchen and towards the doorway. His mouth salivated and his heart raced he needed to be silent but his body kept screaming to pounce on him, tear him apart. But if Crowley had a gun he needed to be careful.
And and and??!!!
"Roller skates." Cas replied before Dean could open his mouth.
"Remember, we're out sexing each other. And looks like I'm in the lead." Dean said proudly.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean slowed and made a left to go behind his dorm and towards the parking lot. Slowing down to the designated speed Dean caught a figure out of the corner of his eye. Crowley.
"Oh, okay." Dean was not expecting that...at all.
"Mm?" Dean didn't remove his lips from the straw in front of him.
"I love you too, little alpha. Get some more sleep before class, I'll be back in a few." Dean walked off into the bathroom to take a quick shower before his long day.
"Dude you are so dodging the question." Yep.
Right on cue Dean saw Castiel waiting outside of his class, sitting on the green wooden bench kicking around the rocks at his feet.
Dean had other plans for Cas so he pulled his mouth off and sat back on his knees. His own cock was at full attention again, pressed against his silk panties.
Dean scratched at the tile and bent over further giving every inch of himself to Castiel. He felt a warm hand move around and wrap around his cock that hung heavy between his legs. Castiel started with light strokes and little tugs. He blindly grouped for the toy since his face was still buried in Dean's ass. Once he found it Cas pulled away from Dean's heat and replaced it with the toy. He pushed it in slowly. Loving the way Dean looked when he stretched around the fake knot. Cas let out a deep growl as Dean panted and purred at Castiel's actions. He thought back to earlier and how this was how Dean must have looked taking him, an odd possessive growl rumbled in his chest but went unnoticed by Dean who was babbling to himself, demanding Castiel to give him more.
"Mine." Castiel growled again pushing himself into Dean's neck to place the winning bite on him, his teeth were slowly going back but he was still gentle, still completely Castiel. Cas took it farther by liking up Dean's jaw line and placing a hand on his cheek. It was very intimate for someone in alpha mode, but Castiel was not like any other alpha. He was Dean's alpha...at least until the end of the year.  Dean rolled his hips forward into Castiel's and the alpha froze lifting himself above the omega. Eyes still a dark gold that searched his face frantically. It wasn't until Dean rolled his hip again with a whimper he didn't mean to make that told Castiel to continued. His teeth began to sharpen again and Dean had such an odd pull to bear his neck. Submit, beg for his alpha.
Alistair's grip loosened as he collapsed onto Dean. Gasping, Dean shut his eyes as the blood painfully rushed back into his head. If he wasn't in such a panic Dean would have passed out there.
“So Cassie I have a question for you. Why didn’t you want me to tell everyone you were bringing a plus one?” Gabe ran his hands through Beckett’s hair as she crawled off his lap and ran to her wooden box of toys. Cas and Dean both let out a slight chuckle and looked at one another.
Dean didn't see Gabriel anywhere but his blood was boiling. How could these people be real? Evolution has taken them from slobbering wolves in the woods to functioning people and yet they still have the mindset of a feral beast!
“mi casa es tu casa.”
"Good, I've got someone here who wants to meet you."
"Don't you boys only play touch?" Ellen asked with her strong accent as she followed Mary out of the kitchen.
"He's putting up a fuss on latching but other than that he's an angel."
“Uh, yeah some cute redhead a few hours ago.” Dean stuttered and wouldn't look the alpha in the eyes.
"Stopping." Cas smiled and moved his arms to wrap around Dean's waist and squeeze him to push the omegas back into his chest.
Castiel’s breathing was faint and he was no longer making any groans to indicate he was conscious.
Sorry for the late update I am at the beach and it took us over a day to find the wifi sign in and all that!
“Dean, are you okay?” Castiel shut the door behind him and took two steps forward before stopping.
"Yes, please Dean this is torture." Dean only laughed and grabbed Castiel's cock and placed it against his wet heat.
"It's okay Dean, I'll sit next to you and Cas and I will show you the ropes." Dean liked Anna, he would rather have Castiel's arms around him but at least he had made one friend out of Castiel's family.
I don't have an editor and honestly, it has been about four years since I have done any writing. I tried to stay with the feel of the last chapters. Thank you to everyone who has ever supported this story!
"Yeah, you ever play?"
"Oh, well at least let me take you there." He purred and Dean felt his heart start to race, suddenly the panic that has been plaguing him returned and he started fumbling his words.
“Let’s just lay down, babe.” Dean encouraged as he pushed Cas towards his bed.
Emilie- http://emiliepond.tumblr.com/
“Campus emergency button was pressed and when security arrived they saw it covered in blood. Followed the scent trail here.” Dean let out a huff of air that didn’t quite pass as a laugh and shook his head
"Yeah, that seems reasonable." He said with a small smile. He walked through the threshold and into the rink. It was nearly empty, save a few people. Cas went over to the skate-rental counter. There was a young omega boy, his name tag said Kevin.
Pushing Dean back he launched into the dominant position and started unbuttoning the shirt he gave to Dean. Once he saw his bare chest Castiel dove in. Sucking and nipping at every inch of hot skin he could get his teeth on. Dean panted under him and bucked up desperate for friction. Trailing Castiel’s nails down Dean’s chest he rolled his nipple between his fingers. Sliding his tongue over the other one Castiel sucked the hardening nub until small cries filled the room. His arousal mixed with Dean’s and created a sweet smell of honey and sweets. Castiel’s teeth sharpened slightly and he started placing small bite marks across Dean’s chest, making sure none of them broke skin.
Letting out a huff Dean opened up his notebook and looked over what books he needed. Taking a few extra English classes over the years was for Dean's own pleasure. He didn't pay much attention to his major, it interested him but it wasn't his goal in life. He didn’t want to be some hotshot, he wanted to be a happy mechanic in a jumpsuit covered in oil.
In no way am I trying to portray Dean as a scared little omega. Remember back to the episode when Sam and Dean checked into a mental health hospital in season 5 and Dean was getting really paranoid....yeah he is more like that.
"Little alpha, why are you crying?" Dean asked, cupping Castiel's cheek and running a hand through his dark hair.
"Hey, uh thanks." Dean's voice was much softer now as if the words were hard to say.
"Well, he probably hasn't mentioned this because it really isn't relevant at all to you but Castiel has been in a relationship before. Not like this of course. Her name was Meg Masters and damn, she scared me."
One last time Dean changed his movement, rotating his hips in a circle as Cas dragged him up and down on his shaft. Castiel let his hand leave Dean's thigh to grab his cock and start pumping and thumbing over his leaking head. Dean tipped his head back in pure bliss as they both approached their edge. Dean could feel Cas swelling and he rested himself on Cas' shoulder and bore his neck for the alpha to kiss. They both came in a mix of cries and moans tangled in each others sweaty limbs.
"Fuck," Dean mumbled as they drew three more cards face down.
"You are like two days away from your heat!" Castiel exclaimed. Yes, he was technically true but he would use every second he could before then. Dean was an adult and could sense it coming on now, it would never catch him off guard again.
------------------------
“Alright.” Cas made a movement to turn back, which was halted by Dean's hand on his arm.
“Well I suppose that if you look at it from a providential perspective-” A look of realization, followed by an annoyed tick at the corner of his mouth, dawns on Cas’s face. “You’re messing with me.”
Dean inspects the waters again. Are there any gators on this side of the country? Whatever, it’s this or canned peaches and that’s not a really a choice at all.
After a brief walk, they reached the physician’s office, where they’d been told by the officer was where the bodies were kept. This was when things had begun to get dicey. First, noticing the red “Closed” sign hung by the front door, they realized they would have to break into the office. Once inside, they were faced with another difficulty. Despite a quick but thorough search of the place, there was no sign of any corpses. In any normal scenario, this would be considered a good thing. However, in this case, it was quite counterproductive to the hunters’ nocturnal expedition. Looking back, this was the most vivid red flag they’d gotten so far that this case was probably more than it had first seemed.
Taking a moment to cool down, he breathes in the crisp early morning air and lets his shoulders roll a few times, shaking some of the tension which had built up inside- a result of last night’s events.
That’s
Bobby ignores Sam’s affronted look, choosing to lock eyes with Dean instead. “If you think I’m dragging your sorry ass out of the water if you drown, then you’re a fool, boy.”
“Are you happy, Cas?” he decided to ask.
He heard Dean exhale a small huff of laughter. “You know, you could always turn them down or something. Your kingdom, your rules.”
Dean is silent, trying to size Cas up. What kind of man jumps into troubled waters and walks up to strangers? A reckless one would be his guess.
That brings a grin to Dean’s mouth. Feeling daring, he settles his arm on top of the pew and bends slightly into Cas’s space. “And? What’s the final verdict?”
For a few more minutes, they continued to play around like that, until eventually, they tired out and tread their way through the sandy shore back to Dean. As they passed the little girl crouching over her growing mountain of sand, she stood up and clapped excitedly. They both smiled fondly at her, although Cas added a courteous little bow in recognition.
“I see,” Castiel huffs out in a laugh. Dean feels a warm sensation spread inside of him.
A soft guitar thrum emanates, joining the sound of the crackling fire and the other rustles of the night.
Bracing his hands on top of the wall, and feeling Cas’s eyes on him, he attempts to pull himself up in one go. Halfway up, he lets out a prolonged grunt as he tries to heave his body up the rest of the way. Three seconds later, his arm muscles are about ready to snap in two. Damn it- he should have practiced this before trying to show off.
Two slumber-numbed hands made contact with the warm sand, fingers sinking smoothly into the golden loose surface, as Dean pushed himself up to a half-sitting, half-leaning position. A strong pang of affection hit him when he spotted two figures, unmistakably his brother and his angel, as one had waves lapping at his hips and the other his lower chest, in the middle of what seemed to be an all-out, yet still strategic, splashing war. Cas was prudently backing away from Sam, who stood facing him, arms akimbo.
He was also at the end of his rope, and seriously pissed off at whoever had started cleaning the floor and left before so much as dropping a heedful ‘Wet Floor’ sign. He tugs harshly at the bottom of his t-shirt and forces out an exasperated sigh. His next steps down the aisle are cautious and slow, making sure to test the ground below before firmly putting his foot down and raising the other.  He repeats the same process a few times, until he stops abruptly when he notices a mess of unruly dark hair plop from behind the shelf’s end.
“Must be tough,” he says simply.
Dean’s transported back to Sam’s teenage years, when second-guessing Dad’s orders was his favourite past time. It doesn’t feel great. And for a split-second, Dean experiences a burst of resentment towards Bobby, who’s been conspicuously silent through all this, forcing Dean to take the brunt of Sam’s frustration for acting like the rational one.
When he set himself straight again, he rubbed at the edge of his nose and smoothed a hand over his light stubble.
An easy, lopsided smile forms on Cas’s lips. They let their eyes rest on each other for a beat. This close, Dean can discern every line adorning his face and the fading trace of a shaving scar on his cheek, partly concealed by a healthy tan and a few days old stubble. Dean feels an urge to lay a palm on his cheek and brush his thumb over the spot, but he quashes the urge the instant he becomes conscious of it and breaks off the contact.
He nods his head. “Let’s.”
Dean takes a long breath. “So what does Bobby think?”
From the way her words hang, it’s clear she’s expecting some kind of answer from him, despite her obvious efforts to avoid his gaze and her eyes remaining stubbornly fixed on some distant point to her left.
Sam snaps him right out of it. “All right, time for me to get some shut-eye.” He pushes himself off the bark and stretches his overgrown arms above his head with a yawn. “You good with the first watch, Dean?”
Dean grumbled a quiet “Okay,” as he turned away, leaving Sam with his satisfied smug at getting the last word.
Dean’s fingers land gently on the strings, letting a few stray, airy notes escape.
He looks at Cas, expecting his shoulders to uncoil. But while Cas lifts his head and lets out an amused breath, the wary expression stays. He shakes his head. “Thank you, Dean. For umm... your encouragements about my fishing capabilities. But I, I was referring to something else.” He exhales deeply before continuing, “More specifically, about what I told you about my, ah, my plans."
“You’ll be fine without us, kiddo. I’ve seen you handle that Colt.” When that doesn’t appear to work, he adds, “Plus, anyone who tries to get you will have to go through Kaia’s knife first."
A few seconds later, Sam joined his side. Unlike Dean, he had gone for something a bit more original. His swim shorts showed small printed palm trees, and around them, a clear blue backcloth, echoing the sky above them. It was strange to see him wearing something else than plaid and flannel, but Dean liked it. It was another reminder that they weren't here for a hunt.
If Cas is startled, he doesn’t let it show, and instead regards Dean like he’s waiting for him to get on with it.
“Oh. I thought we were going to shoot the fish,” Cas replies disappointedly.
Cas cocks his head in a familiar tilt before his eyes widen in silent understanding. “Oh. Behind me. There’s some loose stones.”
“I’m glad I could be of help,” Cas says earnestly.
Hearing a familiar trudge come up behind him, Dean’s free hand flies above his head to readjust the rounded brim of his hat before he hoists himself up again.
For a moment, Dean feels at peace. The buzz in him has quieted. The urge to look over his shoulder is more or less gone. He doesn’t truly think that Castiel understands that Dean’s long nights mean carnage, monsters and grave digging.  But it doesn’t matter to him right now.  He feels grounded.
Dean stays quiet, he’s been clear enough.
He came to the distant roar of laughter, the overjoyed kind, where throats swell and bubble up with the feeling, erupting in buoyant echoes. He recognized Sam's raucous laugh. And underneath it, Cas's hearty chuckle.
“As a very dear friend of mine would say,” Cas paused and beamed at Dean, “that was awesome.”
“Who’s Jody?” comes the curious but hesitant question.
Darkness hit them as they emerged outside, the absence of any nearby streetlight blatant. They did a rapid sweep of their shadowy surroundings and of themselves, blindly checking for any further injuries. Although Sam tried control the pained expression on his face, Dean’s eyes were drawn to the sticky substance oozing from a gash below Sam’s knee. Placing an arm around Sam’s waist, they began their journey back to the motel, where the Impala was obediently awaiting their return. What had seemed like a short stroll back when they’d walked around town had now transformed into a grinding trek back to safety. One they eventually completed, but at the expense of Dean’s back and his nerves, having to turn his head around every thirty seconds to assure himself that no murderous vampire was lurking behind them.
“I get it, Dean. Trust me, I do.” His tone hits him with a guilty pang. He sounds as tired as Dean feels. “But we don’t really have any options here. Nick’s men could be on our tail right now.”
“No, you’re not, Dean.”
Cas doesn’t answer immediately. Instead, he comes to Dean’s side and lies his back against the wall.
Everything about Dean’s expression was enthusiastic, from the way his hands danced excitedly on the wheel, to the glow of his sun-kissed skin, only surpassed by the radiance of the deep blue sky above them and the sparkling shimmer of sunlight swaying on the sea’s surface. Although he was behind the wheel, Dean’s body was half-turned in excitement towards Sam, also admiring the view spreading actively before them. A wide grin animated his features, noticed by Sam who smiled in return, and Cas, who watched him fondly through the rear-view mirror.
"Who's that?" Castiel asked out of curiosity and not in an overpowering alpha way.
Okay I think -I'm really hoping- this has been looked over by emilie. If it hasn't feel free to point out errors! I'm sorry about being a poop! I love you all!!!
“Shit, I never thought of it.” Dean scratched the back of his head. “I mean, we aren’t settling down in my old town. Not many teaching jobs available up there.”
“What the hell is going on down here?” Castiel growled silencing his mother before she could snap at Dean.
They took their massive burgers and pile of fries from her and started to devour them. Cas dipped a fry in milkshake and held it out for Dean, which he took, smiling as he did.
“Yeah, I’m sure you could.”Cas conceded, kissing his forehead.
“What?” There was a fifty-fifty chance that either Castiel misheard Dean or just didn’t know what bottom bitch meant.
"Dean, hey wake up. Please Dean open your eyes for me." Cracking his eyes open he looks up at the blue eyed alpha.
They reset and this time it was Castiel who hiked the ball. Tossing it back to Ash he followed the same pattern Dean did and ran past their defense. John was running parallel to Cas but just before Ash could throw him the ball Castiel was tackled to the ground in an alarmingly violent manner. Everything stopped, Dean was sprinting towards Cas who was pinned down under John. His father stood up and brushed off his own shirt giving Cas a nod.
“It’s fine just relax.” Dean turned back to his work but could still feel Castiel’s eyes on him. It wasn’t the possessive stare he had before, out of the corner of his eye Dean saw Castiel’s face fall. His eyes softened and he turned back to his book.
“Just get dressed so we can go.” Cas pleaded, trying not to sound annoyed. He waited as Dean collected himself. Peeling off his sleep shirt and shorts. Revealing a freckle splattered back and the swell of his ass in a pair a light blue lace trimmed panties. "So you wear those all the time?" Castiel asked eyeing Dean's ass.
Just before Dean stood to leave Pamela grabbed his shoulder.
It didn’t escalate to more than long relaxed kisses, the give, and take of mouths and moans. The touch of skin and winding of legs was what filled their mornings. It was amazing to touch Cas like this, to forget about everything that caused him stress over the past few weeks.
"Yes, well you should be good for thirty minutes. But I may take you before that." Castiel purred and leaned in to kiss his mate. He had missed him so much, those days of so little contact had really affected him. It wasn't normal for wolves to do that, mates relied on such a thing.
"I will when you tell me what you're babbling about, jerk!"
Next update is Tuesday April 22nd!
"So where is Alfie?" Dean asked as they wound around the corner and up a large set of stairs.
Bursting through the door with one test in hand he threw himself into Castiel's arms.
"Over here." Dean could smell how worked up Castiel was and didn’t want to know what happened upstairs.
"Maybe, might as well make the best of this situation." And before Castiel could respond Dean slid his lips around Castiel's cock and swallowed...deep.
“You’re saying I deflowered you?” Dean let out a small laugh and slapped Cas on the shoulder, Cas flinched slightly. "Well I’m honored but I need a cold shower because I am getting slick everywhere and I smell like sex."
"I think it's," Castiel looked over to his alarm at the blurred red numbers, "Two-forty" Dean groaned and Cas froze. His knot went down so he lifted off Dean and looked around.
"Congratulations Dean you are an alpha." He smiled wide and looked to his father who looked anything but happy.
“What about my name?” Castiel looked at him with confusion.
“W-What does that mean?”
"Ready?" Dean answered by pushing himself up by his knees and dropping back down. He pulled a surprised gasp from Castiel and smiled. Castiel's hands snaked down one to slide over Dean's thighs and the other to slide up his shirt and pressed his fingers into the soft give of his stomach that was hardening with every constriction of muscle.
It was one swift movement that had Dean on his back and Castiel pushed hard against him. He was slotted so perfectly near Dean’s ass. Sliding two fingers down he started to stretch out his omega. The warm wet slick helped him slide in easily and move around. Pressing the pads of his fingers into Dean’s walls and started to scissor him out.
"About what, baby?"
Dean gave a slight growl as Castiel jumped out of bed wearing only red boxers. Dean sat up and craned his neck to enjoy the view of Castiel walking.
"Um yeah sure little bro. Just don't forget a gift for my little girl. You're her favorite uncle now, would hate to see you loss your spot on top." Castiel laughed and nodded even though he knew his brother couldn't see.
"What do you mean?"
Castiel fumbled trying to press all of him into the omega scratching for purchase. Dean's hands fumbled as he searched for the door handle. Castiel was still relentlessly tangling himself into Dean. He could sense it within Castiel, it was pure fear he couldn't pinpoint if it rooted from his past or the thought of losing Dean but it was very real and it scared Dean.
“Mother fucker!”  He yelled, slightly whimpering, hot tears streaked his face. His mom didn’t have a problem with him being an omega. What was so horrible about Dean? How could he have failed so terribly? So what, he was brought up from a pup to be an alpha and then once he turned seven it’s like he was a black mark on his family. His father was disappointed in him for something he had no control of. For fucks sake John should hate himself he was the one who helped make Dean!
"Fucking hell." Dean shoves the book back, of course, why would the book he need be in this damned library?
"How do you know? You're pack has beaten all the odds. Your father never pumped you full of drugs to change your gender presentation! He was discussed with me! And you know where that landed me? Having some weird ass heat in a dorm full of alphas!" Dean snapped, at least this was helping distract from the demands his body is screaming at him 'let that alpha have you, bend over, take his knot'
"I mated into the Novak pack." Dean fell backward into his bed and braced himself waiting for his brother's reaction. He knew Sam knew the Novak pack, practically everyone did. The one in a billion family, well except for who they seem to call their dirty secret.
“How is he at bearing pups?” He asked and Dean thanked god his back was turned so he didn’t see his eyes widen at his comment and his breath catch in his throat. Dean could puke at the thought of bearing that man’s pups.
“What’s with Mrs. Doubtfire?” Cas shook his head.
“Does it make you feel better?” Dean asked.
“Meaning?” Dean spoke into the darkness. Castiel clicked his free hand and the lights suddenly repaired themselves. Dean squinted at the sudden brightness.
"Yeah" Dean nodded.
“Actually," she replied, "I’m looking for my sister who lives here. Samantha Winchester? Do you know which room she’s in?” She asked, pulling the jacket off from around her, folding and placing it in her arms.
“How’s Sam?” Cas asked, angling his head away from the renewed perseverance of Jack’s grabby hands.
"Jack," he said gruffly. He scratched his freshly shaved face, looked up, and stared off into the distance at the now cracked bowl and empty packaging. There was a fourth option, he realized, for if He didn't show. "I'm not leaving," he declared, eyes darting around at the lack of people. "You hear me? I've got nowhere to be!" He smiled and nodded absentmindedly as his eyes started to burn. "I have nothing left..." he shook his head. He hated so much to admit it, that the tears suddenly broke free of his eyes and ran down his face. He was always so certain of himself and his role in the world and fought like hell for the freedom to choose his own life and now that he had everything he'd ever wished for he found himself feeling worse off than ever. He desperately wanted what Sam had. The certainty he exuded. He could feel his brother leaving him behind again and knew he needed to find something to grab on to. He was desperate for something, anything that felt right in this new world. The closest he'd got was his dog and fixing up cars and while that would be enough to keep him alive he knew it wouldn't ever be enough to make him happy.
“Yeah. Understatement, but yeah.” Dean replied squirting toothpaste onto his brush.
“Look, I’m not saying I don’t have issues... I'm working on it. I guess I had to reach a new level of rock bottom yesterday as far as self-loathing goes so I could figure out that's not who I wanna be anymore… I gotta start living my death... not like I'm going anywhere." A thought occurred to him, "Aren’t you the one who’s a celestial therapist, you telling me you didn’t twig I was projecting?” He flashed the corners of his mouth down and raised his brows, “Maybe I didn’t need to work so hard.” Penny scoffed out something akin to a laugh and shook his head.
“Dean? Talk to me, what’s wrong?” Castiel’s voice was barely audible from behind him.
“Uh, yeah,” Dean muttered as he breathlessly followed Castiel through the grass and into the hallway.
“You know you’re whole speech before you bit the big one-” He began a slow clap, his hands slapping together boomed into the otherwise peaceful sounds of the forest around him. Dean turned around and shouted at the sky, “Wow, man, That was impressive, especially the part where you died before I could even get a word in edgewise.” he chuckled, completely exacerbated.
“Thanks,” she said politely as she ducked into the brightly lit hallway behind him.
“Okay will do.” He pulled his phone from his ear and brought his finger to the “END CALL” button when he heard Charlie speak again from the other end.
“Cas-- I--”. Cas shook his head.
Castiel found himself sitting on the ground, his back against some cool metal, his breathing was shaky, he watched silently as Dean rushed around, moving various torture instruments and devices around the room in a panic.
“Yeah, I heard it’s good.” He chuckled, teasingly. Mary rolled her eyes.
“Can we order another two each while you’re over here?” Sam asked “It’s gonna be a long night.” Ryan raised his brows.
“Peachy”. Dean replied before swallowing down the third pill. Sam sighed and shook his head again.
Lucifer, no longer pinning him down, blurred in movement all around Cas, stabbing the blade in at an angle, and plucking at the chunks formed. Cas attempted to break free again only to be pushed to his knees so Lucifer could now start the yet untouched areas of Castiel’s body.
Dean was filled with a morbid relief that his brother had assumed he was making visits to the basement on behalf of his grief over losing Cas. He felt a guilty comfort knowing that his mourning masked the true reason for his recent stopover at the dank location he had found himself drawn to each night. The basement was the one area of the bunker he refused to allow himself to visit, up until just moments ago. He swallowed hard, trying in vain to bring some relief to the dryness in this throat. Dean shook his head and pushed his chair back, scraping it against the floor.
“I get it”. Cas grunted. “I saw Jack there, in the empty. I need to speak to him. Have you seen him? Did he make it out?” Gabriel and Balthazar looked at each other again.
"He's my father, Dean." for the first time during the conversation he avoided Dean's eyes. "He can't leave the Empty... and besides… he needs purpose." He looked back at Dean imploring him to understand "He created demons... and he
"You and me both, kid" Dean replied, sincerely. "It's just an expression."
Dean decided,
“Oh, I get it. I get it more than you know… I’m sorry, Adam, I am, but honestly, I’d do it again.” Dean grinned, his eyes wide with anger, “It was the whole freakin’ world, versus you and Michael, and I’m sorry for your loss... but it seems to me like you could have been a lot worse off if it weren’t for us! Because of what
“The Woman in White”, Sam confirmed.
"Oh, so, wait, are all of you angels?" Steve asked, a hand over her mouth as she spoke with it, full. Dean raised his hand.
“Sure…
--” and that was it. Dean sat up with a sigh and paused his phone, causing the television to stop. He patted the memory of Castiel on his forearm and then stood up, while Castiel stared at him in confusion.
“Ughhhh,” Dean flung his head back against the seat and ran a hand over his mouth. “I don’t wanna.” He chuckled, closing his eyes tight.
“After I died…” Charlie prompted.
“Yes.” Cas smiled. “For most people, it’s the house they grew up in or the home they started a family in. Sometimes people share their soul’s residences; Families. Ash for example. He brought Harvelle’s Roadhouse here. Ellen's soul didn’t yearn for another location, whereas her husband William, and Jo, both wanted their family’s home. Ellen still lives at the family home but it wasn’t her soul's specific residence.”
“Is it working?” he asked, although he could feel the lack of it doing so, and therefore knew the answer to his own query.
Dean remembered Cas’s lifeless body after Lucifer had run him through with an angel blade. Sam tried to help him lift Cas into the lakehouse but Dean pushed him away, frantically guarding his body. He remembered standing by Cas’s corpse waiting, hoping, believing that he would return before they could burn his body.
“You’ve got a family of werewolves, some hunters from an apocalypse dimension, a reanimated tree girl and her warlock brother,” Each time dean added to the list he raised another finger “an ex angel, the queen of hell, a Nephilim nephew that had a small stint playing god, and freakin’ Death on your side of the church pew…" Dean smiled and licked his lips, "not to mention, a giant fairy as your best man...” Proud of his joke he waited to receive the laughter he deserved “...A
“I need you to tell me that it's okay”, He implored, using what felt like the very last words he would be able to muster.
"I know, Cas" Dean smirked.
“Well thanks! It’s good to be back. I’m glad you remember me, buddy, after all you did, taking on the empty like that? It's good to see you're still kicking.” Jack looked confused again and his whole body became slack as he lifted his arms up, signaling for Dean to place him back down on the ground.
“Yeah, well, I say a lot of things.” Dean shrugged, his eyes wild. Castiel sighed and took a step back. He sniffed and nodded at Dean, seemingly content with his answer or at least content enough to drop the argument for now.
It took less than no time to find the new potential target and scope out their house. Dean hadn’t even noticed that the sun had set. He was deep in conversation with Sam, one eye on the house, as it had crept its way beyond the horizon, for what would be Dean's last sunset. Hours passed. Sam's booming laugh reverberated through the impala at Dean’s lame jokes. Sam rolled his eyes at Dean’s actually funny jokes. Everything was as it had always been.
"Huh." she shrugged. "I feel fabulous" She beamed a fake smile at him. Dean looked everywhere but her face.
Once hearing the click of the door, confirming that her sister had left, Deanna ran toward the sink behind the bar and unloaded the contents of her own stomach. The foamy brown liquid that had once been their separate colored choices of cocktail, now burned the inside of her throat as it exploded from within her. Dianna sniffed and coughed and choked as she tried to settle her stomach. She searched the area behind the bar for a cloth and turned on the tap, letting the water run continuously and washing away any evidence that she was there then trudged back to the puddle of her sister's vomit. She spent the next few minutes mopping up the goo, walking to and from the sink while trying desperately to keep herself from hurling again. Finally, when content with her work, she turned off the tap and found a full bottle of Gin and a bottle of vodka from the shelf behind the bar. Deanna walked back to the area Sam had contaminated and threw the bottles as hard as she could against the ground, smashing them. She sniffed and surveyed the scene, wiping the dollops of spew from her legs with the rag, and turned to look, for a second time, at the gruesome scene behind her. A shiver ran through her, causing her to physically convulse as she read the words that were carved upon the mutilated corpse of Samantha’s now dead boyfriend
The impala is full.
"First, I made a deal with Amara... It was pretty easy to convince the Shadow I was dead." Jack started. "It had wanted my soul ever since I woke it up, so, after stopping my heart with help from some narcotics, I woke up in the Empty." He smiled gently at Dean's worried face, "I had learned The Shadows weakness during my time with God's power so when I finally arrived... I went looking around, until I found, and woke up, Crowley." Dean wasn't expecting that.
"Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be able to solve any of my unresolved issues anytime soon... so that's awesome." Dean sighed. His stomach felt tight suddenly as he worried over the concept of being out of place in heaven forever; Being trapped in an afterlife where everyone was happy and at peace while he walked around, perpetually bitter over dying young. There was something he could do to make heaven feel a little bit more like a home all he had to do was move. Move one arm. Just lift that one left arm and place it upon Cas's torso. He searched Cas' eyes while the angel's azure eyes bore into him in return. He so desperately wanted, at this moment, to ask Cas to go through his dramatic as shit speech with him. He wanted to dissect it together, word by word; ask for clarification of each sentence, to ensure he could comprehend what exactly Cas had meant. Yet, Dean knew he should wait until the morning until he had a clear, sober mind. It seemed possible, it wasn't too far away, after all. Maybe in the morning, when the room stops spinning, Dean will have found the courage. "Night, Cas," Dean said rolling over and turning off the lamp beside him. Castiel sighed and turned off the light on his side.
Castiel found that he began to bleed apart; he had wandered his regrets over and over in the timeless void of the empty and eventually, whilst inside a dream that he could now no longer recall, that squeezing inside of his chest had intensified until it finally became almost unbearable. Then, he felt himself split in two, away from his memory’s body. He turned to look back upon himself, his true form a dazzling light exploding out of what was once merely another vessel. It was strange, seeing his body move and breathe and live without him inside of it, after years of living within it on earth. He looked down at the hands of his true form and turned them over, simply marveling at them without judgment for the first time in over a decade.
"They're still there," Jack explained. "They're just asleep now. They have no power over that realm anymore". Dean shook his head. He'd have to just accept what Jack was saying. It was a lot to take in and he resolved to have to table all of the new information he'd learned, hoping that maybe Jack was right and everything would remain stable...
Two Years Later.
Nobody.
The first few chapters are p bad but I guess I was really just trying to get the set up out of the way?
rebelling heaven.” He teased, “I do wish I could have seen the show. I wonder if my being there would have convinced them of your true identity.”
"It was Beyonce," Dean repeated, theatrically, narrowing his eyes, "and as for Cas and I… Well, I reckon you could take a wild stab at it." He threw the last of the hotdog into his mouth. Adam's mouth twitched down as he glanced between the two before the epiphany hit. He opened his mouth to respond but Dean cut him off before he could speak. "How's, uh, the whole
maybe this place was big enough to house every soul at once. He wasn't sure if the citizens wandering the streets were people he had interacted with in life and simply couldn’t remember, or if they were strangers, souls collected over all of human history. It was something that he had, up until now, not even considered at all. He wondered at the idea. What would he do if he walked in to pay for the gas and had to line up behind Marie Antonette or Jimi Hendrix(?!), for that matter. He was somewhat disappointed when he climbed back into the Impala after paying, having recognized nobody in the store.
“Can I get you anything else before I head back to the danger zone?” He asked, smiling and flipping open his little book.
“Heaven has never actually had any issues with same-sex relationships. Gender and Sex are inconsequential to us. It’s definitely a human thing.” Cas smirked. Dean raised his eyebrows and rubbed at his eyes again.
“This place looks like a set from Star Trek,” she said to her sister, a brow raised. Sam shook her head then grimaced as she led them through the crowd of people in assorted Halloween costumes, and toward a two-person table in the back corner of the neon-lit dance floor. Deanna slid herself gracelessly into one of the two white plastic egg chairs, and picked up a drinks menu, trying to focus on the price of the drinks while loud, chaotic-sounding hyper pop rang out through the room. A man in a white v-neck, black jeans, and red devil horns, sporting a tea towel slung over his shoulder and a notebook in his hands approached them.
“Yeah, uh, have you got anything that comes in some kind of fruit? Like, maybe a coconut or something?” He asked, filling his glass again.
"I… uhh..." Dean jumped. He shut his eyes tight trying not to swear. He gently placed his fist against the table as if he was ready to fight whatever had snuck up on him.
“Oh, is that what this was to you? A
“If I’m going to drink I may as well do it properly” Cas stated and rose slowly, pushing a shot each back toward Dean and Charlie. The pair looked at each other, confused, as Castiel sauntered off toward the bar. Dean broke into a smile as he realized what Cas was doing.
The church they had chosen, he had frequently visited since Jack first took over as The Big Man. The building was large and modern. There were no stained glass windows, no pictures of Jesus, no angel statues, nothing but the cushioned wooden pews, wide open space, and a big wooden cross at the center of the wall behind the glass pulpit. Sam liked going to church, he had found. It was a way to deal with all of the crazy he’d gone through over the years. Hearing the stories of real people going through horrible things all for the entertainment of a sadistic God, he could relate. He’d even spent time outside of the church, hanging out with the pastor. They’d discuss God as a flawed retributionist entity and Sam loved that. He loved that he could still keep his faith but was able to feel validated about his mixed feelings. He recalled the time he’d invited Dean and Cas over for dinner to meet Pastor Finley; young, green-haired, non-binary, Pastor Finley. They discussed at length the trials and tribulations from each passage of the bible over drinks, dissecting the literal and figurative meanings in each story. Cas only slipped up a few times; referring to Adam in the present tense or furiously debunking Matthew 22:30.
me... and now he’s dead because of you!” Dean closed his eyes and smiled in exacerbation. He tried to breathe calmly, nodding to himself before replying.
"I, uhh… I'm weak" he looked back down at Cas before continuing, worried that if he moved his eyes away, by the time he looked back, Castiel's condition would have worsened but also because he was so nervous to see Dean's reaction to the next words he uttered. "I gave Amara God's power".
Castiel's eyes burned at the words. He began to sob, deep ragged breaths rang through his room, as gripped at his chest as if desperately trying to hold his body together. His pure anguish overtook him as he realized,
“The Empty Heist? The big upgrade? None of that was you?” Gabriel questioned. Cas’s stomach flipped as he stared at the blanket on his legs. His brows sinking lower down his face. He faintly recalled a dream in the back of his mind, among the millions of dreams from while in the Empty. He tried to focus on it, as his eyes darted around. His two brothers shot worried looks between them as they watched him.
“Oh, you are? Well, that's fine then”. He spat sarcastically. “Look, I don’t get what Castiel sees in you, but he’s been a dear friend of mine since before your species was even amoebic, so, if
Angsty and short. (Although is it short if all of the chapters are short. maybe I just have high expectations of myself).
"Hey, buddy! How's Quantico?"
Dean opened the door to Jack's bedroom and froze. His mind raced as his eyes scanned the visuals around him. He hesitantly took a step into the room, his boots sinking ever so slightly into the grass where the concrete floor had once been.
“Uhh.” Cas swallowed hard. “No”. He felt frozen... and unusually aware of his arms.
“I uh--” She cleared her throat again “I managed to light the flare dad had in his hand. Scared ‘em off long enough for me to run away.” her voice wavered. “God, I--” she hung her head as her eyes began to leak. “I don’t even know if he was dead when I left, Sam.” she sniffed. “It was horrible,” she sucked in a ragged breath.
“Oh, I’m aces.” he smiled. “I’m gonna need you to rustle up some kind of mojo that’ll take Sammy out of commission for a few days.” Rowena cocked her head to the side.
I’d be doing that?”, Her brows furrowed. She knew something was up, the way she looked at him, she could tell it was something big.
...” Dean turned to look at Castiel for the first time. He saw the hurt that he was trying to avoid feeling himself, plainly etched on Cas’s face. He spun himself around and took a few steps away, intentionally blocking his eyes out with his hand so he couldn’t see Cas’s face. “Don’t, Cas.... Just-- You go. You’ll have fun. Go get your pride on without me, you don’t need me for that”. Castiel puffed out a frustrated laugh.
before you answer, how have you apologized to
"You have no damn idea what the hell you're talking about," Dean said, attempting to push past his brother and reach the door but Sam's been bigger than him for years and simply blocked the door by lazily putting his arm out.
“You?” Dean emphasized, he put his feet back on the floor and leaned forward, toward Castiel.
“Surprise!” The group yelled in an uncoordinated mess of voices, as they rose mistimed from their hiding spots throughout the Roadhouse. Dean laughed, a little hesitant at first, before breaking into an all-encompassing chuckle. He beamed at the faces around him. His Mom and Dad, Ash, Jo, Ellen, and Bill… Dean guessed? He’d only seen pictures. Bobby was there with his wife Karen too, along with Keven and Channing, Charlie, Pamela, Pastor Jim, Rufus and... his Daughter(?), Mick Davies, Ketch, Balthazar, Metatron, Samandriel, Gabriel, and Dean faltered as their eyes connected, Cas. Mary reached him first, ripping him from his gaze, throwing her arms around him.
. His chest squeezed again.
He slowly allowed himself to picture
him. The man was awake all of five min--”
“Dad’s dead, Sam. What’s he gonna do? Ground me?” She laughed. “Besides that thing’s the only lead we have if we wanna figure out how to kill Yellow Eyes.” Sam shook her head again, bewildered.
“Yeah, Son. Mary’s right.” John stood from his seat calmly. “Not all of us are fucking the help.” He shook his head slowly, his eyes closed tight as he breathed deeply. “I can’t do this Mary.” He opened his eyes and looked down at her. His expression was hard. “Dean, I--” He shook his head again. “I’m trying to stay calm here but--” he laughed humorlessly, “You’re acting like everything's fine. Like you didn’t just-- How are you even here, Son? How is
“So, the rest of The Council.” Dean prompted while attempting a serious face.
“Yes… I’m not sure what the thought process was there but it seems I made the cut.”
Mary had the honours of driving a shitfaced Dean back to the bunker. Dean hated leaving his car in some random cherry pie town all alone but worried that maybe the new heaven was so heavily inspired by Earth that he'd find his way into a car accident and become a quadriplegic or wind up with a DUI... and after the way he'd been burning all his bridges since getting to heaven, he figured he was on a fast track to having to disappear on a long drive somewhere, never to be seen again… therefore losing his license seemed like a bad idea.
Dean's alarm rang out from his phone signaling that it was 5:00 am. His room was officially puke free as of 2:00ish last night when Sam and Eileen finally left after a quick, yet, sincere apology for punching Sam in the face, awkward silence, and a full hour of convincing Sam that he could be left alone. Dean rose without a second thought as he marched toward the bathroom and prepared for the day. His stomach was unsettled as he stared at himself in the mirror. He did indeed look like crap. His eyes were bloodshot with purple bags beneath them and his face was sunken and pale. While he gingerly shaved the overgrown beard, a million thoughts ran through his head that he hadn't yet really allowed himself to think about before.
Jack sighed again.
“Was that just four right turns in a row?” Dean asked.
"I think you should try that," Jack said standing in the doorway awkwardly. He looked horrible too, Sam noted. He walked over to the minifridge and crouched all the way down to retrieve a pouch of saline. He kept his eyes on his brother as he hooked the IV up to the broken stand that Dean had once fixed by welding it to a metal coat hanger. Dean still hadn't moved. Sam saw that his brother's face had become more frantic as his eyes roamed over the deep gashes over Cas' body.
“Is this the place?” Sam asked, completely unaware of any of the thoughts that plagued his brother’s mind.
to keep going. So, I figured, one last time. Maybe I could go down swingin’, save Sammy in the process, then I could finally let myself take on the big sleep…” He sighed, “I guess it took it all finally ending for me to realize, I didn’t really
soft, and Cas? Cas is my family, always will be. So if you have a problem with that, you have a problem with me.” he scoffed, “--and come on, dad, let's not act like you actually managed to beat
“Is it really relevant, right now, Cas?” Castiel nodded, his eyes wide. Dean shifted his feet awkwardly staring at his boots, the growing pain deep in his chest was becoming unbearable as he waited for Cas to hurry up and get to the final blow.
“I don’t know. I’ve died since then and managed to get a golden ticket... I guess I was just kind of wondering when the scales wouldn’t balance in my favor anymore. And uhh-- with everything...” Dean trained his eyes at the door in front of them, “I know that Hester chick said I “
“Become Death? Jack, no. You have to leave before the empty finds you and keeps you here for good this time”.
“Of course not! You shouldn’t even fucking ask me that, Cas. You
“It was Dean. He-- Cas it's bad. I--” Jack shook his head trying to clear it, trying to get his emotions under control. “Cas, I have to free you from the empty. It's the only way we can save Sam.” Castiel felt as if his brain was working in slow motion.
“I assume that he wanted to show you that heaven will eventually start to feel more like a home, he can probably sense--”
“Yeah.” Sam pulled her lips thin as she searched Deanna's face. Deanna breathed in deeply.
“I... uhh” Dean began smiling unamused. “I’m sorry I choked in there, man.” He wiped his hands over his brows slowly, rested his fingers on his temples for a moment, took a deep breath, and continued, looking at his brother. “I’m sorry for everything lately.” Sam’s mouth formed a thin line as he handed his brother the bottle again. Dean gently pushed it back this time. “Look, Sam, there’s something I never told you”. He stated, blinking up at his brother. He inhaled. “When Cas summoned the Empty… to do it… the deal was, he had to find true happiness” Dean watched as his brother's brow furrowed in confusion. He nodded, tongue against his teeth, and scanned around, choosing which words to use before continuing. He could feel his heart hammering in his chest as he explained “He, uhh, he said it was something he figured he could never have...” he took the whisky bottle from his brother. “He said that he loves me” He trained his eyes on the bottle, before quickly bringing it to his lips and downing a long drink. Sam studied his brother, understanding the gravity of the words. After not immediately receiving a response, Dean raised his eyes and looked at his brother expectantly. Sam’s face didn’t seem shocked, or confused, or disgusted, or even full of pity, like Dean had feared, instead, he just sat there waiting for his brother to continue. “What?” Dean asked.
“Dean? You okay?” Sam’s voice drowned out the lyrics as Dean settled back down into the seat, closing his eyes and calming his breathing.
-----
Sam loves Joni Mitchell. Dean takes a nap.
"Infinity Gauntlet-ed everything?" He asked with an enthusiasm that reminded Dean of Miracle. He could almost visualize Jack's big golden tail wagging.
At the speed only granted to God’s favorite son, he began to chip pieces of Cas’s torso away.
in here too, by the way, good ol’ Johnny Boy. He’s telling me all sorts of fun little family secrets. Seems that not only did you take up an appetite to the way I taught you to carve up the riff-raff, but you clearly got one hell of a kick outta me popping your rosebud.” He sighed his smile just a touch wider than John's, his eyes disgustingly empty.
“I’m-- I-” He shook his head and sucked his teeth, before chuckling and nodding, then flashed his eyebrows up. Cas stared at him, studying him, with a smirk on his face. “Yeah, okay. Alright!” Dean laughed. “Shut up!” Cas shook his head and took a seat beside him, bending forward, his eyes alight with warm kindness.
“Thanks,” She nodded, still watching the huddled bodies on the dance floor. “So, uh, what about you? Been up to anything new lately?” Deanna brought her eyes to her sister before training her gaze down toward the table between them. She picked absentmindedly at the dirt and blood hidden behind her french manicure as she attempted to come up with a response that her sister would want to hear. Sam’s eyebrows lowered as she turned her attention back toward the woman across from her, waiting for a response to her overwhelmingly simple and casual question.
“Ehhh” Dianna tilted her head diagonally, grinning.
Hatchet Man voice: "It's time to slice and dice".
“But Jack--”
“I don’t want to complain. I mean, I’m wrapped. Heavens great. You guys have done a bang-up job and all… It’s just--” He hesitated a moment. “...I wouldn't mind it... if you pulled some strings and used the ol’ nepotism card to get me access to my old bed.” He stated almost as a question. “I mean, I totally understand it if it's too big an ask, but I did get stabbed in the back and these seats ain't the comfiest night's sleep”. Castiel smiled and Dean relaxed a little. “Is that a maybe?” Castiel looked out the window in front of him for a moment, contemplatively.
one-on-one is what constitutes ‘being asked out on a date’ by you.” Dean bit his lips in an attempt to stop his smile, before hiding his grin behind his cup of coffee, taking a sip while Castiel stared him down. He couldn’t pretend he wasn’t still a bit all over the place when it came to their relationship, but at least he had managed to somehow, maybe miraculously, thanks to heaven, let go of the shame he felt around his feelings. He took a beat and glanced up at Cas, maybe it was less so to do with heaven and more to do with the angel himself, accepting Dean so completely.
Dean’s internal monologue repeated on a loop as he tightly gripped the Impala’s steering wheel and completed his fifth lap of the area, in search of a parking space. The city was huge and the segment that they'd chosen as the location for the festival backed onto a beach. People dressed in all sorts of colorful glittering outfits wandered out onto the main road with very little care, resulting in Baby’s horn getting an extreme workout.
“Of course”, He nodded, narrowing his eyes. “How are you finding it this time; the new and improved Cosmic Siesta Condominium?” He asked, dramatically flicking his hair off his shoulder. Dean smirked.
“Where the hell are we even going?” Deanna asked, taking in the huge crystal chandelier that hung atop a desk at the center of the room. Sam smiled over at her and continued walking toward the woman that sat at the desk engrossed in her phone.
Cas, looked away, his own smile faded. Something pulled at the inside of Dean's stomach. There was a painful quiet for a moment as Dean sat, watching Cas’s composed features.
“Well, I’m gonna head home,” Penemue stated, his eyes flicked from Cas to Dean.
He had frequented truck stops and dive bars mostly. Sometimes, when money was particularly tight, he’d pick up intel from a local; find that area's rest stops, parks, lookouts, alleyways, wherever the town’s lonely closeted gay men visited, that’s where he learned that the money would be. It was fast cash, John would leave for months at a time, sparing a Ben Franklin or two from the home and life insurance payout and expecting it’d last until he returned. Of course, it barely covered the price of a motel for two weeks. John didn’t take too kindly to being asked for more money, It seemed he'd assumed that seeing as Dean was old enough, he should be applying for after school jobs. Obviously, John didn't know that Dean had dropped out by then, and it's not like anyone would take a highschool dropout who was never in one place long enough to even add any job to his resume anyway. He’d tried taking what he needed with a five-finger discount, and that sure as hell didn’t pan out. So, say John was out on a hunt, Sammy fast asleep, Dean did what he could to afford a bottle of Jack (to numb his self-loathing), a meal each for him and Sam, and keep a roof over their heads, all the while terrified that his dad would find out. Dean remembered the way he'd spoken too much to his dad about his time at Sonny's, about some of the friends he'd made while there, the way John made all sorts of implied cracks about what boys do at boy’s homes... until Dean reminded him that the night his dad finally came to collect Dean, he had been about to take a girl to the school dance.
“See,” John began sitting back up straight in his chair. “I told you he’s not a fairy. No son of mine, well, maybe he used to be a bit soft as a kid,” John amended, “but he grew out of that like all children do, right boy?” John gave Dean a curt nod and Dean stared at the white wooden table. He didn’t reply. “The angel, maybe.
The sound of thrashing wings rang out through the room and all eyes turned toward the young angel Azrael, their hair still in two meticulously neat matching braids by their shoulders.
"Great". Deanna responded to herself as she watched her sister's retreating form. Shaking her head, she broke into a light jog to catch up.
"No, D. Anything you want to say to me you can say in front of him." Deanna swallowed hard before nodding slowly to herself and walking over to the seat at the desk. She lifted the wooden chair and waddled it over to sit in front of her younger sister.
“Auto brightness my ass”, he mumbled croakily to himself as he typed the name of their hotel into his maps app. After dragging his heavy feet three blocks he found the location he had visited the day before, fumbled with the lock for a moment, and gently opened the door, placing his keys on the table by the door slowly and silently as he possibly could and making a b-line toward the bathroom.
“I’m sure he’ll forgive you if you want me to go wake him up now?” Dean's eyes bulged.
“I know.” Castiel sighed. “I also know, that you know, that you’re being stupid”. Dean looked up at him with fear in his eyes and swallowed audibly.
“You’re allowed to be upset about dying. You barely even made it past half of a human life expectancy.” He placed his lips to Dean's cheek again. “You don’t need to keep these feelings to yourself, you know that right? You’re not some
"Call Sam and get him to meet us at the bunker" Dean fidgeted in his seat propping himself up on one leg trying to gain enough height to see into the back seat through the mirror.
“Gabe”. Balthazar nodded at him.
"I guess it was always gonna start back up at some point" Dean began, shaking his head. "Some leftover vamp or werewolf from the uhhh... " he narrowed his eyes in thought "Thanos... Snap... falls off the ledge and turns someone… who kills someone else…" The car fell silent for a moment. The air was suddenly morose.
“He kept calling it a welcome home present.” Penny shook his head, “He was a little confused.” Cas smiled and turned to Dean, holding the picture out to him.
“Wow, Crowley. You’re actually kind'a nice as Death. How does that work?”. Dean asked, squinting at the man beside him. Crowley grinned as if thinking of an inside joke.
He walked a few meters into the treeline.
“You tried to help protect Sam and Dean from me, you must not resent them as much as you like to pretend”. He noted. Balthazar sat on the edge of Cas’s bed slowly, trying not to move him.
“I see you still haven't started your painting, Dean''. The angel remarked shaking his head, his long curly grey locks swishing around his shoulders.
"You just make it so unfairly easy," He remarked, placing a hand over Dean's cheek and leaning in to kiss him.
"And it was a long day," Sam added.
"What are you doing?" Castiel's voice spoke from where he was seated, watching, from the map table. Dean straightened up in a jolt and exhaled sharply.
Her mind raced ahead, showing to her all sorts of self-indulgent scenarios in which all sorts of horrible, yet seemingly possible things occurred; Her younger sister screaming at her, throwing all sorts of objects, calling her a coward, a fake, a weak and despicable waste of human resources.
“I’m something…” He shrugged, “I love Cas. Does the rest really matter?” Penny still seemed confused.
“Kidding. Jeeze.” Dean chuckled, rifling through the tapes again before fishing out the yellow cassette case with a picture of a Chevy Bel Air on the cover, pushing it into the tape slot and pressing play. The title track played throughout the car.
tonight.” Cas laughed.
“Aren’t we a little old to be doing shots?” Sam laughed, “I don't know about you but I’m definitely finding it harder to bounce back”. Dean put down his shot in annoyance. He knew it was his last night on earth so he’d be damned if he didn't get to spend it getting absolutely shitfaced with his baby brother.
“Wait, Sam!” Deanna called out as Sam stepped forward, onto the rooftop bar. Samantha froze in the doorway, her mouth parted. Deanna rushed forward and pushed her sister aside. Bile rose in her throat. She held her hand to cover her mouth, trying to keep her drinks inside her as her eyes roamed around and she took in the scene.
"I can't do this anymore, Cas". He laughed softly and swallowed hard as he brought his eyes to the man beside him. Castiel placed the beer on the table, his eyes wild with worry as they scanned over Dean's face, waiting for him to continue. Dean swallowed again, attempting to clear up the tightness that had appeared in his throat.
Dean was able to sneak off to his room rather easily, he discovered. He gently closed the door behind him, trying not to make any sound. Dean reached into his pocket and retrieved a ziplock bag that Bobby had subtly placed into it when they embraced. The bag was full of blood-soaked dirt from the ground where a murder had taken place. The biggest affront to God; man killing one another. He examined the dirt closely for blood and didn't hear the door open behind him.
“What? Oh... No, Dean, let me finish.” Cas demanded. Dean sighed impatiently and Cas’s eyes flitted around as he tried to remember where he was up to. “Long story short, the Emperor held what I assume would equate to a modern-day fashion show. By this time the townspeople had heard much about this supposedly incredible fabric that was only visible to the superior amongst them. So when the Emperor strutted around naked, his people pretended to love his clothing in fear of looking foolish. In the end, one small child very loudly, with innocent abandon, spoke up and pointed out the Emperor's nudity. After that one child pointed out the truth, everyone in the town square began to jeer at the emperor for his lack of clothing and complete gullibility. The moral of the story being that the Emperor isn't the only true fool, but to remain silent is also a form of foolishness.” Cas clasped his hands together in his lap and smiled up at Dean.
“Oh, uh, yes-- Jack has seen that show and in all honesty... that was the basis for his design… So, technically it wasn’t actually an accurate depiction until recently”. Dean searched Cas’s face. He couldn’t ever remember a time when Jack had mentioned watching that damn show. In fact, he was pretty sure that Castiel had mentioned it to all of them an annoying number of times. Dean knew the whole freakin’ plot of the show because Cas had told him about it one time on a long drive, trying to keep him awake. Dean figured Cas must have convinced Jack to watch it after all. Cas avoided looking at Dean. Charlie glanced between the two.
"Oh yeah, you're the poster boy for mental health" Sam shook his head. The anger started to rise inside Dean again. He knew that Sam was only trying to help but it did nothing to help quiet the pit of his stomach screaming for attention. He knew he had left it too long to reply with a clever comeback so the silence grew between them. He pushed himself up from the bonnet.
Some rose petals get squished.
Dean fumbled for his phone on the coffee table in front of him and looked at the time. It was 4:30 am. He cleared a space on the floor and placed the expensive-looking black and white striped cushion that he had used as a pillow, under his knees. "Alright," he whispered, his throat itchy from roaring with laughter and yelling excitedly only hours earlier. He put his elbows against the coffee table and cleared his throat as he placed his hands together. It felt strange, it would always feel strange. He closed his eyes and began his nightly ritual "Jack, uhh... God." he croaked. "Dean here. Again." He noted that with his eyes closed the room felt as if it were spinning. He hadn't had so much to drink in a long time. "I don't know if you're waiting for a specific number of prayers from me, buddy, but honestly, it's getting old". He sighed deeply. "Any day you wanna make an appearance works for me." Dean shifted his weight from his knees to his feet as the former started to burn. "Anyway… I'm at Sam's new shack... just in case you choose tonight to roll in. I'll be back home tomorrow, though." He peaked his eyes open and gave the room a once over before correcting himself. "I'll be back home in a few hours. Just…" that damned feeling in his stomach was back. "Just… really... kid, any sign that you're even getting this would be a win for me at this point" he sighed and rubbed his hands on his temples "I miss you… Amen." and with that he gathered up the cushion on the floor and returned back to the couch where he lay, trying to get comfortable, continuously checking his pocket to ensure it still contained a small folded piece of paper each time he rolled over. He ended up spending the next few hours trying not to think and desperately hoping sleep would come.
"You've been avoiding Jody" Dean had to give it to her, she was damned determined. "I know that you know that Sam offered her the bunker." Dean stared at the wall in front of him, completely frozen. He swallowed down the guilt before responding.
“Are you sure? We could always just pause it, or, if your knees are sore, I could try--”
“Do you? I mean I’m sure the Elvis impersonator that officiated for you and Cas was great company and all but---”
Jack and Dean sort some stuff out.
“You got any salt?” she asked, decidedly ignoring her sister’s question until she was satisfied with their current level of safety. Samantha rolled her eyes and sniffed as she bent down to flip the fuzzy rectangular rug that she had by her front door, revealing a devil's trap drawn on the underside of it with what looked like a Sharpie. Deanna nodded at the rug and raised her chin toward the window as if to ask about how they would be protected if a demon decided to scale the outside wall. Samantha shook her head and retrieved a large bag of salt from under the bed, the corner of which was already torn open. She poured a line across the windowsill before dropping the bag of salt, the contents spilling all over the floor, as she slumped down onto her bed, her head buried in her hands. She gasped for breath. “Hey,” Deanna raced to crouch in front of her and began rubbing her sister's arm as she sobbed.
"So, let me see if I got this right." Dean began. "Crowley is now Death... and Lucifer is who's taking care of all angels and demons when they get ganked? Lucifer as in
"Dean, are you okay?" Dean looked up at Jack but felt like there was an invisible barrier between them. He opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again as he looked around searching for the words. None came and yet he found himself sitting there repeating the process, opening his mouth, looking around, and closing it again. "Cas will be okay," Jack said, reassuringly. "Sam's stitching him up now". Dean's stomach flipped. He stared down at his legs, seeing the deep wounds oozing black muck and blood. He swallowed and slowly looked back up at the boy standing over him, the barrier between them, now gone. Jack had always been a pale kid but covered in Cas' blood and the black gunk from the Empty highlighted the current contrasting greyness of his skin. For once, Dean surmised, he truly looked his age. Not physically, exactly, but deep within his eyes he no longer looked like a perplexing, enigmatic being and was merely a three-year-old boy way, way out of his depth. Dean slowly stood back up, the fog had lifted from his brain as if a switch had been flicked. He traipsed over to the child and enveloped him in his arms, resting his chin on the top of his head. He sighed and closed his eyes, taking in the reality of the moment. He tried desperately to grasp at one of the many questions that he wanted to ask, to choose which one to ask him first.
“Not telling you, that you were the most,” Cas sighed, “exceptional man I had ever met, and that I never went on to meet anybody who could possibly hold a candle to you, that was one of my most common dreams in the empty; one of my biggest regrets”. Dean pulled his mouth into a sad smile.
“No. I know. It’s just…” he sighed. “I don’t know. Nevermind.” Dean put his hand on where Cas’s sat on his scar and pressed his forehead against the angel’s.
thing… not to mention the ominous as fuck message carved in--” she lowered her head and spluttered as she burst into tears again. Deanna was immediately at her side holding her in her arms.
“I don’t think that would have been wise... had I been "wasted", I doubt I would have been able to remain as polite as I was to your father.” Dean rolled his eyes as Cas swung his feet down to the floor and pulled open the door beside him. The creaking sound filled the still night air around them. The muffled sounds of music pulsed from inside the Roadhouse. Dean flung open the driver's door as Cas slammed his own door shut, then the blonde picked up his last beer and scooted over into the passenger seat, watching as Cas groaned and clutched his torso as he slid into the driver's seat and closed the door.
"Dean-" Sam began. Dean shook his head. He focused on the anger boiling up inside of him.
Dean pulled back, his eyes wide, his smile wider. He stood and surveyed the area in the pitch blackness before chucking at Castiel, in the darkness that now enveloped them. He swallowed hard before he spoke, and when he did his voice shook, exposing the feigned swagger he attempted to muster.
Dean looked out the car window as the guitar solo started. He choked down the lump in his throat as he watched the fields fly past. He realized he’d never really paid attention to the words of the song which was a wild concept considering it had sat in the glovebox of the impala his whole life. He’d been forced to listen to the tape too many times to count, and yet this time, for the first time, he couldn’t stop the tears from streaming down his cheeks.
“You’re next.” Cas joked then laughed at the excitement upon Jack’s face.
“I’m sorry! It’s just that I’m so damn
"Masquerading as a man with a reason, My charade is the event of the season, And if I claim to be a wise man, Well, it surely means that I don't know-" Dean switched off the horrible cover song and sped off down the road that led through the woods.
cool with it” he clarified in a rushed voice, “I just mean--”
“Yeah, I don’t know, man. I don’t really think that’s my scene.” He pulled his hand out from under Cas’s and grabbed the bottle again taking multiple deep pulls of whiskey.
like a father to you in a way, wasn't I? Taught you the in’s and out’s of the world, of our world…” Dean swallowed, unable to do much more than stand there, frozen, listening in pure dread and utter confusion. “And he
“I don't know, man.” Dean sighed, he turned his eyes to the ceiling and pushed his head to the cold tiled wall, “Only if you actually want to”.
Saving lives was what Dean was good at. Isn’t that along the lines of what Cas had tried to tell Dean before the angel had died? That it was in the saving of the lives not the killing of the monsters that had set Dean apart? That he wasn't the hate-filled, revenge-driven man that his father was; that Dean too, believed he had inherited? That he, in fact, was so full of love, that he fought purely because wouldn't ever be able to rest, simply knowing that there were people out there who needed his help?
“I have learned a lot over the years but I’d like to think that my inclination toward swindling games of chance came
He had told Charlie about Cas before the two of them had met and she seemed to immediately start, not so subtly, dropping hints about how “dreamy” or “handsome” he seemed based on Dean’s descriptions alone, which would have been totally fine... if she wasn't a raging lesbian. She clearly saw
“Yo, I feel like we should catch up properly when you get a minute. Hit me back.” Dean frowned reading the next text. He felt Cas’s eyes on him. “You and Cas seemed super weird last night. Is everything ok? I’m obvi here if you wanna chat.” The last two texts were just a gif of one of the Kardashians, the short one, a phone to their ear with a subtitle that read, “This conversation is already too long. Bye.” and afterward Charlie simply wrote “You”. Dean chuckled and replied.
Castiel awoke in his bed. The same brick walls on one side, as there had always been, the same cement wall on the other. His body ached badly as he tried to sit up, bringing a sudden rush of memory back to him. Castiel looked down at his hands, at Jimmy Novak's hands, and tried to concentrate on inspecting his true visage beneath them. His head exploded with pain at the strain it took to focus his grace. His hands, the glimpse of his celestial form, caused his stomach to roll. His fingers leaked grace, flesh dangled from various bones, and was ripped and torn clean off others. He whimpered at the sight, immediately reducing back into his vessel's form, silently praying to himself to forget the image.
"I imagine that they had a lot to drink last night," Cas stated, switching on the radio. An advertisement for a local storage facility exploded through the speakers.
, but you also told him that you
“Hey, Jack! I’m, uh, Kelly?” Dean replied looking between Castiel and the angel in the corner for confirmation. Castiel grunted as he clutched his ribs and took a seat in the grass between Dean and Jack.
Dean sighed as he returned from the bar, placing a black plastic drinks tray down on the small wooden table and sliding onto the stool beside his brother. Sam, deeply interested in his phone, acknowledged a quick “Thanks” to his brother without looking up.
“I’m okay. I’ve been cooped up for days, subjected to bed rest. It's nice to be able to converse, be around people, again.” Dean nodded, as he tried not to take Cas’s comment to heart, hiding his smile behind the bottle and taking another drink.
he'd start by saying.
With Jack and Cas now both gone, the drive back to the bunker was silent as Sam stared out the window at all the bustling and renewed life exploding all around them. He had received a call from Eileen pretty much as soon as Jack left, her eyes filled with tears threatening to fall as Sam filled her in on the events that had just taken place. Sam sighed audibly. He was feeling impatient as if the Impala crawled in slow motion in comparison to the vibrant, energetic life restored to the planet just moments before. He couldn't wait to see Eileen in person. He imagined her smile slowly spreading into a beam, catching the corner of her eyes where they crinkle. The idea of everything finally being put right with Chuck; the concept that finally he was able to rest, was something he had only ever dreamed of, and now that his dream was a reality, he didn't quite know where to begin.
anything about how to make more bullets for this thing.” She said holding up the colt. Sam sniffed.
“What is--” Cas began then looking at Dean, the shock Cas wore seemed to fade into one of tenderness. Dean chuckled breathlessly and whispered hoarsely.
“It’s an escape room scenario” Sam informed her. Dianna ripped the hood from her head.
“Come play,” Jack said, curling his hand around two of Dean’s fingers and pulling him over to a pile of toys by a box at the end of his bed. Jack released Dean, who placed his hands upon his knees as he groaned, and bent down to sit in the grass at the end of the bed. Castiel smiled down at them as Jack started rummaging through the toys, handing Dean a Transformer and a Barbie. The Barbie looked like it had seen better days, its clothes had been removed and its hair stood up straight. Dean thought she looked like she’d had a particularly fun night.
“I’ll get one of the Monster burgers, and the Roosevelt with a side of fries rather than a salad.” Mary grinned up at the waitress as she wrote it down.
“Uh, thanks.” He nodded, flicking the paper. “I’ve always known what my room was missing was some of God’s crayon art”. Dean grinned as he pressed the paper to his chest and nodded to himself. He placed the drawing into his back pocket.
“I was worried you'd decided that, now that you finally had me, you didn’t need to make an effort anymore”. Dean scoffed as he opened a can of tomatoes.
Lots of Freaking out.
there a way he could bring me back?" He questioned. Cas sighed.
"No, really, Cas. You'd have loved her. Blonde, legs for days, ass you could bounce a whole wallet off." Dean lied, animatedly. He licked his lips and smiled to himself proudly.
Dean tried desperately to tell him.
he’d roared. Sam recollected how the Pastor calmly, yet awkwardly tried to explain that Cas had confused his verses, Matthew 22:30 wasn't about homosexuality, and that they were all for marriage equality and
“You-- You're gay?” Penny’s brain seemed to be working in slow motion. Dean turned back toward the angel.
, he considered. He had been conned before.
“Uhh, so, after you died--” Dean stopped, closing his eyes at the image of her in the bathtub. His heart sank.
“Oh, I assumed you’d get to the point eventually. Our mutual friend, Jack. Apparently, it's easier to create a bunch of new angels rather than resurrect the old ones... It turns out us angels are an endangered species, now'days''. Dean hesitated, the fog of his dream still swirling somewhere just beyond the surface.
To Penemue, however, Dean simply looked as if he were being impatient again. Penny looked Dean up and down, his upper lip twitching with rage. “Castiel is
“Was it now?” A sickening jolt ran through Dean’s spine, exploding like lightning in his stomach. He blinked rapidly in the direction of the voice, trying desperately to clear his vision. He found himself standing alone in a treeless empty field that seemed to stretch on as far as he could see; he was completely and utterly alone, barring the single person standing in front of him. A smirk on his face, arms crossed against his chest, looking the same as ever, with the exception of the addition of horrific milky white irises, stood John Winchester.
He sat back up straight as his chest grew warm. Dean avoided looking at the man in the bed. He sniffed and scratched his nose. He trained his eyes to Cas' chest again and bounced his leg while he licked his lips absentmindedly.
“He’s not Hell level bad though...” Dean stated in a strained voice, his eyes searching Castiel. Cas shook his head and huffed quietly. He squinted back up at the stars for a moment before a smile began to grow on his lips.
“How are you here?” Castiel asked. Jack threw his arms around the angel, muffling the end of his question in his shoulder.
“Right. So, uh--” Dean began.
“Dad-- Er, Sir, I-- What have you done?”
“How’d you get out?” Sam asked after a long stretch of quiet. Deanna shook her head, a tear rolled to the top of her cheek before she swatted it away and sniffed.
“Yeah…” He sighed and turned to look at Cas again. He approached the next topic carefully. “Cas, say I do find a way out of here... you’re not gonna come with me, are you." He rushed his words as his eyes darted all over the room, "What with Jack being here, and the council probably needs you--” Castiel's eyes lit up as if everything had finally fallen into place; as if finally understood why Dean had been so hesitant to talk about his discomfort. Dean continued to avoid looking at the angel and instead busied himself. He pulled a wooden spoon out of the drawer and stared nervously at the pot as he waited for the vegetables to soften, and Cas to respond.
are. Dean Winchester, the one exception to the rule as per usual.” Dean did smile at this. “Want to talk about it?” Cas asked hesitantly. “You don’t have to of course it’s just--”
“What the hell kind of closure could you possibly need? And as for mourning, you practically hated the guy!” Sam’s mouth fell open.
“Castiel.” He looked up to find Dagon standing over him. Their form flashing between that of the Asain woman they had possessed and their yellow-toned true form of a man with long hair, a beard, and the tail of a fish. Dagon pulled Castiel up one-handed, by his neck. “I’m going to enjoy getting back at you for my death”, They smiled, as their other hand dragged, backhanded, gently down the side of his face. Quite suddenly, however, fear and confusion flitted across their face as a blade appeared through their chest, burning the essence of their spiritual form in a flash of electricity.
“Are you ready to order?” she asked, flipping open a little book and retrieving a pen from her apron. Mary looked up at the boys expectantly. Dean nodded in reply and John shrugged.
"What are you doing, Dean?" Sam asked gently, his face full of pity as he looked over his older brother's shoulder at the bag he was clasping. Dean's mouth formed a thin line and he let out a single sad laugh, realizing he'd been caught out. He shook his head and put the bag down on his bed. He inhaled a long deep breath through his mouth trying desperately to subside the familiar rage that grew inside him before nodding, composing himself, and turning to look at his brother.
Dean slowly sat up and pulled the thin blanket, kindly left for him, over his shoulders and stretched his legs out, kicking a beer bottle over in the process.
“Son.” John, in his familiar brown leather jacket, stood beside Mary now, giving her a nod as she stepped aside. Dean noticed that the rest of the guests mingled over by the bar, taking seats, and began drinking, allowing their family room to catch up.
“I promise you if anything happens. If any of them come back we--
“Dean...” Dean shook his head slowly.
“I’ll register your complaint with Jack.” Dean folded his arms around himself and nodded.
“Anyway,” John cleared his throat again. “You should really be getting out of the house, Dean. The kid I remember would always be getting into trouble, bringing this girl and that back to the hotel. It’s a shame that you’re here so soon, and I’d hate to think that you’re not even enjoying yourself.” Mary shook her head ever so slightly and eyed the menu in front of her.
“It’s more believable this way,” Cas replied, his voice barely a whisper. Dean nodded, he scanned the impala without seeing as he took in the words then placed his beer down and clapped his hands, rubbing them together.
“I’ll drink... If you talk”. Dean took a beer off of the tray and began drinking it.
“We’re looking after it”. Balthazar chimed in. Gabriel nodded and presented his arm toward Balthazar.
"Michael," Castiel interrupted as the archangel approached the group.
“Great actually. We all love what you’ve done with the place,” she said mirroring Dean's exact remark from earlier, as she pulled away from the hug, and placed a hand gently on his shoulder. “This is the boy's dad, John. John, this is Castiel.” She said, seemingly excited, gesturing between the two. John extended his hand.
“What the hell did you just say?”
He stared down into the sink only now truly seeing how desperately he held on to the edges, his knuckles white. He released his hands and watched the color return to them.
“Coming for who?” Sam muttered, her eyes continued to look through Deanna as if she weren’t there. D scrubbed her hand across her brow.
“Okay”, she said, curling her hand into a fist, “You gotta get out of here, ask the chick at the desk if you can borrow her phone, call 911” she pushed herself in between her sister and the wall and tried to maneuver her head in line with where her sister was staring blankly, eyes impossibly wide, at the rendered surface in front of her. “Tell them you’re Christine McVie, the usual,” Deanna raised her voice, “Sam! You hear me?!” she grabbed her sister's shoulder, hard.
“Are we in Heaven?” He asked, searching his brother's face. Balthazar cocked his head to the side.
and leave it at that.
“I’m-- I’m not, man. Just drop it.” He chuckled in frustration, lifting his coffee and taking another try at sipping down the boiling hot liquid.
“Trouble in paradise?” Dean spun around quickly, his hand flew to his chest in shock.
“Alistair.” Dean barely managed. “You fuckin’ bastard! Let him go.” Alistair laughed gleefully.
Cas is a Transformer. Dean is a Duck. They both sit in grass taller than them and avoid talking about their feelings.
“The armchairs are great but I gotta stretch out the ol’ knees, I’m falling asleep”. Dean grinned and turned back toward the TV. Cas’s heart was beating hard and fast and he, much to his chagrin, also felt it beating in his crotch.
“Oh, Nah. I’m a teetotaler; totally straight edge these days.” she snickered, biting at her lips and attempting a serious face.
“Good”.
“What about you and Eileen”, Dean’s stomach twisted as he realized he had brought up Eileen as if she was Sam’s equivalent to Cas. The implications of which, Sam didn’t comment on, he just sighed and smiled at his brother though his smile didn't reach his eyes. Dean relaxed a little at this. He knew that over the years, his brother, among others, had made comments and offhand remarks about his relationship with Cas. Each time these comments were made, Dean had found himself becoming less and less angry and irritated at the connotations. However, this was before Cas had thrown a spanner in the works and highlighted the reality of the situation. Cas had finally uttered a simple four-letter word that explained the mutual appreciation, respect, loyalty, devotion, tender fondness, and sometimes passionate rage that they had, up until that point, left unspoken between them. Not that it mattered, Dean noted, Cas was dead and in the empty, the two could only meet again in heaven where, even then, it would be nothing but memories. Dean still couldn’t help but regress to the familiar irritation that spread through him at every mention of the two of them together. The pure rage and frustration rivaled how he used to feel during the first arrivals of these kinds of comments. The feeling that used to make him want to gank everyone else in the room, so the two of them could just go about their time together in peace, without anyone judging them or making it weird. This time though, he could only blame himself for that feeling; the anger could only be turned inward toward himself. Sam shifted under the silence. Dean could tell that Sam had felt the air change as he ran through his inner monologue. Sam just wasn't aware that the anger plainly written on his older brother's face wasn't directed at his silence.
