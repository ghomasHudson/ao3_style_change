Steve bit his lip and guided himself toward Tony's hole. For a moment he wondered how his cock was going to fit, but Tony had seemed so sure this would work that Steve wasn't going to question him.
. He thought he would never have the chance to do this to him again. To kiss him, to hold him, to have him fall apart in his arms like this.
The door opened a minute later and Tony was standing there looking like he was just on the other side of being trashed. He blinked, but then gave him a wide haphazard grin. “Well, I certainly wasn’t expecting to see you here tonight, darling.”
Steve smiled at him, and even though he knew Steve wouldn't be able to see it behind the face plate, Tony smiled back.
“Oh.” Tony's smiled dimmed a little bit. “At least one of us is lucky in love. My attempt at marriage didn't go so well."
Tony gave Steve's face a lingering look before nodding and positioning himself in the middle of the bed on his hands and knees. “Ready when you are.”
Tony looked up at him suddenly. “And weapons, Steve. And I can't. I can't have more blood on my hands.”
“I'm fine.” Steve assured, sitting up and giving Natasha a quick once over, checking for injuries. “But who fired those blasts.”
The two of them worked effortlessly together. They always did. Tony and him were always so in sync during battle, that they didn't even need to share words to understand each other.
With the new information they had stolen from the Beyonder, they had the advantage now and had the final piece they needed to complete the Bifrost and get back home.
Steve grabbed his hand and kissed it lightly. “It's a long story. I promise, I'll tell it to you later.”
Before he could take another step toward him, the mummies were back and they fell back into battle. Steve felt his heart grow warmer with each repulsor blast he heard and each snarky quip Tony said. The three of them worked together to dispatch the remaining mummies and soon the last of them were destroyed and it was just them standing in the empty tomb.
Steve didn't have anything to say to that, but Tony offered no resistance when Steve pulled the bottle from his hands. “C'mon, Tony.” Steve murmured, helping the drunk man to his feet.
Tony woke up with a pounding headache. God, it had been a long while since he'd woken up with a hangover.
Bucky glanced at Steve who seemed completely enthralled by Tony's story, his attention solely focused on Tony.
Tony seemed to see the indecisiveness on Steve's face. “Hands and knees, then. You can watch as I open myself up.”
“The problem,” Tony hissed, “Is that I swore I'd never lay hands on another weapon as long as I live. I can't help you Steve, I'm sorry.”
Tony didn't say anything in response to that, instead soaking in Steve's warmth. God, if he closed his eyes, he could almost imagine it was his Steve's arms around him holding him close.
"I got engaged to a woman, also named Natasha, actually. She ended up being a Russian spy who was just interested in stealing my money. She killed my butler, Clint's entire family and tried to tear the Ultimates apart. Clint ended up killing her."
Tony shook his head and buried his face in Steve's chest, desperately clinging to Steve's apparition before he disappeared and left him for good.
Steve clutched him back, knowing they only had a few precious moments before the others came looking for them and they had to implement the next part of their plan. He didn't want to let Tony go, but if this all worked out, he would be able to hold him close back on Earth.
When Natasha had answered all of Tony's questions and all that was left to do was to let the machine charge up, Tony and Natasha took a seat on the couch in the corner of the lab to learn about each other's respective worlds.
Tony's mouth opened and closed a few times before he surged forward, lips meeting Steve's in a passionate kiss.
Steve sat there for a moment, stunned. After he shook himself from his stupor, he went to stand up and follow Tony but a small hand on his wrist stopped him.
Tony twirled his glass in his hand and opened the door wider. “Do you want to come in? We could watch some of those soap operas you like so much?”
Tony looked at the two of them. “The both of you have been lovely, but I should get back before my world falls apart. My stocks have been in free fall after-” Tony shook his head before settling on, “I have to get back.”
Tony seemed a little disbelieving at his response but nodded. “Right, well, I guess I need to go and reacquaint myself with a blacksmith's shop.”
Steve briefed them on what happened in the tomb while Tony told them about what had happened to him after communication was lost. After a surprise appearance from Loki had been dealt with, things began winding down.
“It really wasn't.” Natasha admitted. “My parents died when I was nineteen and the board and shareholders were... reluctant to give me the reigns, to say the least. I've been proving their crusty asses wrong ever since.”
Natasha had gotten up to get them both a can of coke when Tony called out. “Do you have any rum to go with it?”
Tony must have lost some time because suddenly the room was quiet and his eyes were jolting open as he felt the cushions shift. Tony instinctively shot out a hand and grabbed Steve's wrist to prevent him from leaving.
Tony’s beard tickled against his neck, but Steve felt something in his chest break at Tony’s pleading tone. He wrapped his arm around Tony and felt as the man sighed into his skin.
Tony rubbed the back of his hand across his mouth as he remembered Steve coming over to his house after Jarvis' funeral. This visit had been completely unprompted and Tony didn't fully remember that entire evening due to the shocking number of martinis he'd imbibed, but he did recall Steve sitting next to him on the couch as he rambled on about nothing and everything. He knew he hadn't been terribly good company and had told Steve so but he had stayed with him anyway. When Tony had woke up the next morning with cottonmouth and a throbbing headache, there had been a blanket over his body and a glass of water on the coffee table.
“So, you're the female CEO of a Forbes 500 company? Nice work. That couldn't have been easy.” Tony praised, giving her a salute with his drink.
Tony opened his mouth seeming momentarily speechless before shaking himself. “Are you sure you don't want something? What’s your poison, Cap?”
Steve shushed him soothingly and pressed a kiss against his temple. Tony felt as his limbs were rearranged and he was lifted off the cold ground. “I've got you now.” Tony's hallucination promised.
Tony shuddered and shook around him and Steve petted a reaffirming hand down his back, his fingers tangling in the bunches of fabric of Tony's smooth robe. Tony took a deep breath and relaxed his body and seemed to stop quivering around him. “Okay, Steve. Fuck me hard.”
He eased the tip in, having to push a bit hard to get through the tight ring of muscles. Tony tensed when Steve was in halfway and Steve stopped, not wanting to hurt him. Tony waved an impatient hand at him, gesturing for him to keep going and then Steve was poised flush to Tony's glutes.
"So, realistically, what are my chances of having a threesome with you two then? Sleeping with myself and Steve are both on my fucket list."
Jan felt her mouth drop open but then Thor was walking in and Steve was straightening up at his arrival and stepping back into the role of impassive leader as he started the meeting.
Steve adjusted his grip on Tony's hips and did just that and God, Steve wished Tony was the other way around so he could kiss the heady noises coming out of his mouth and then Steve was coming and coming-
Steve froze. He'd never been with a man like this. He'd done a few things during his stint in the army, a few stolen hand jobs in the dead of night and, one memorable time, he had been blown in a deserted alley by some guy, but that was different. This
Tony gave her a self-deprecating smile. “I'm supposed to be a genius, I should've noticed the signs about her sooner. Love makes you blind I suppose.” He said, taking another sip of coke, wishing it was something a bit stronger.
Steve let out a tense breath. “Look, I know you've had a rough time of it lately but we need you on the Ultimates.”
“I'm not asking you to make guns.” Steve promised. “There are plenty of other things this town needs. Horseshoes and nails and-”
Tony broke the kiss and started mouthing his way up Steve's neck and to his ear. Steve could feel the tickle of Tony's breath as Tony put his lips to Steve’s earlobe. “So, tell me, how would you feel about fucking me into the mattress tonight?”
Either way sounded fine to him. Marrying Tony was the goal, he didn't really much care for how it happened.
“If this isn't something you want," Tony said. "Now’s the time to say so. Consent is very important to me.”
Tony jumped so bad, he nearly spilled his drink, half of it sloshing over the rim and coating his hand in alcohol.
Tony gave him a bitter smile. “The cancer’s probably going to get me before that happens.” Steve just gave him an unamused glare, a muscle twitching in his jaw and Tony sighed. “Seriously, Steve, you don’t need to worry about me. I'll be fine.”
Steve nodded. “I just wanted to warn you that despite my best intentions, they hold a lot of the power here in Timely.”
Steve felt his cheeks heat at the image of doing that to Tony, but pushed down those feelings. “Can I come in?”
Steve seemed to know and gave Tony a friendly pat on his arm before stepping down on the street. Tony followed, ready to protect Steve should the need arise.
Tony gave him a wan smile and put a finger to his lips. “Yes, you did.” Tony huffed a self-deprecating laugh. “You know what the worst part of all this shitshow is? That even after all she did, I still love her just a little bit.” Tony snorted and drained what was left in his martini glass. “Though, I guess you of all people know a bit about loving someone you shouldn’t.”
When Steve had asked if it was okay if Tony join them for their weekly dinner, Bucky had thought he was joking, but here Tony was, dressed to the nines with a charming smile on his face.
“We get along fine, but Steve is... Steve. He's an all American manly man and is as heterosexual as they come."
He had thought he was hallucinating in grief last night, but now in the cold light of morning he knew this was real. Steve was alive.
Tony just shrugged and promptly buried his face in Steve’s neck, arm draping across his chest. “You can have your existential crisis later, just… hold me.”
“I'm actually a little offended you stole my tech but have no idea who I am.” Tony said with a shrug. “The name's Tony Stark and you're currently using my repulsor tech.”
Tony unlocked and opened the door to greet Steve with a carefree smile. “Hi, Steve. What brings you here today?”
He ran towards Tony and pulled him into a hug, the strength of it pulling Tony off his feet. He heard Tony's little surprised gasp as Steve spun him around. Steve set down Tony and pulled back. Tony was grinning at him.
Eventually Tony's breathing evened out and Steve went back to his desk to keep vigil over him. He had some work to get done anyway.
After that, Steve and Tony's relationship became the town's worst kept secret. Partly because Steve always made sure to see Tony during his rounds and partly because Tony kept serenading Steve outside his window.
Tony's mouth fell open and he pressed a long kiss to Steve's lips. “Bedroom. Now.” Tony commanded, scrambling off of Steve's lap.
There was a beep overhead and a soft female voice rang out. "Scan complete. Radiation frequencies are consistent with Earth 1610."
Before Steve could think about what he was doing, he had his lips firmly planted on Tony’s. He tasted like an overwhelming combination of vodka and olives but Tony was twining his arms around Steve's shoulders and god, did that feel amazing.
As the opening credits played, Tony glanced over at Steve. He noticed Tony looking at him and turned his head.
Fury pinched the bridge of his nose and resisted the urge to walk in there and just butt their heads together.
Steve stripped down to his boxers and laid down next to Tony, brushing a strand of his too long hair off his brow.
Clint narrowed his eyes, looking around but it seemed as if only he had seen Cap and Stark's positive interaction. Nevertheless, Clint had other things to worry about himself, strumming the string on his bow in nervous habit as he tried to calm himself before their current mission.
Tony abandoned his drink on the first flat surface he could find and slid into Steve's lap with a pleased smile. “Oh, darling. I've been quite smitten with you for a while.”
Steve raised an eyebrow and Tony gave a put upon sigh and set the glass down and dramatically pushed it away from himself.
He gave Bucky a firm hand shake and gave Gail a friendly kiss on the cheek, offering to help her finish up the rest of dinner.
Natasha lips twitched up and she leaned back. “Yeah, I did. A part of me will always love Ru, but I love Steve too. He's my anchor and he really helped me after what happened. I can't imagine my life without him.
Tony felt something warm blossom in his chest at the thought. Steve had stayed with him after Jarvis' funeral. Steve was here again now because he hadn't been answering his phone.
“Yeah, we do. And you married the guy?” Tony asked, still reeling over his counterpart being married to Steve fucking Rogers.
Tony let out a breath, nodding. “Well, seems like this is goodbye. It was wonderful to meet you both.”
Steve had been grabbed from behind. He was able to throw the mummy off before another converged on him and dragged him down. His head hit the floor and his vision whited out for a moment. He heard Natasha's shout but couldn't do anything about it as more and more mummies started to attack him. He felt as Natasha was slammed to the floor next him and just as soon as that happened, he heard the sounds of electronic blasts ring through the air and the weight of the mummies disappeared.
Tony looked at him with such fondness, placing a hand to Steve's face and brushing his fingers across his cheekbone, before saying, “I love you, too.”
Natasha cleared her throat and Steve started, half forgetting she was there. He put some space between him and Tony and looked at her sheepishly.
The Ultimates had been together a few weeks and things had been going fairly well. The team was new and they were still working through the kinks but overall Fury was pleased with their success.
Steve, very happily, obliged as Tony dragged him off the couch, the ring on Tony's hand a warm weight between their intertwined fingers.
Tony eased off Steve's lap and led the way into his bedroom. Tony flopped onto the bed luxuriously and reached for the bedside table that no doubt held the things they’d need tonight. Sure enough, Tony was throwing a packet at him, lube in hand.
“You're taking this remarkably well.” Natasha observed, gesturing for him to pull up a chair next to her.
Tony shook his head and gave Steve a half smile. “I appreciate you stopping by, Cap, but as you can see I'm fine.”
Tony took the proffered hand and gave her a once over nearly kicking himself for not noticing their eerie resemblance sooner, the jawline alone really should have tipped him off. "Stark, huh? Well, I always knew I would've made a fine looking woman."
“I'm serious.” Steve scowled, crossing his arms in front of himself. “You've been holed up in here going on a week now.”
Steve finally got up into the bed. It was a bit awkward with his pants and underwear around his thighs but Steve made it work.
As the Ultimates PR rep, it was Betty's business to know everything about everyone and she prided herself on that fact.
“Okay.” Tony said with a nod, walking over to Natasha's work desk. “So, how does this multiverse machine work? Actually, can we back up to the multiverse in general and what you know about it?”
Tony was up surprisingly early for just how much he'd drunk last night but Steve covered his surprise with a grin. “Thank you, Tony.”
"Woman me is hot. You're hot.” Tony explained. “And unlike my Steve, you haven't punched me in the face for suggesting it yet, so I'm already ahead in that regard.”
“You have perfectly good food on your own plate.” Steve complained but there was a lack of heat to his tone.
Tony smiled back at her before turning back to Steve. "Now that we're all acquainted, just what do I have to do to get you to agree to threesome, Steve?"
“Ideally? Some hot blond who can fuck me into next week. Unless that's why you're here and well, in that case....” Tony trailed off with a lopsided leer.
Steve lifted Tony up and he felt as the man in his arms jerked and made a small sound of protest. Steve shushed him.
Jan found herself happy for him. Steve was a good guy and while she and him hadn't been a match, it was nice to see he wasn't haplessly pining over her.
Tony shrugged. “All's been quiet in the land of supervillainy for once. Why shouldn't I throw myself a little party once in a while?”
Natasha smiled proudly. “Yes, Iron Woman. I had some heart problems a while back and invented the armor as a type of life support to keep my heart going. Been kicking ass ever since.”
There was still a lot they had to deal with. Battleworld, the Beyonder and now Loki, but Steve couldn't bring himself to give a damn about any of it in this moment because Tony was back in his arms.
Steve frowned, shaking his head a bit like he was angry at himself. “No. I meant, I know I'm in love with you.”
Then Tony Stark was stepping from the shadows and into the dim flickering light of the torches. He looked tired and was in desperate need of a shave but he greeted them both with a beaming smile.
Tony looked pained for a moment and Steve felt a surge of guilt rush through him for putting that expression on Tony’s face. He’d meant what he'd said, but he hadn't meant to hurt Tony so callously.
He buried himself deep in Tony and pulsed his hips slow, milking his orgasm. Steve was still inside Tony as he watched him snake his own hand around to his cock. Tony pressed back onto Steve's softening cock and jerked his hand a few times before moaning into the pillows as he came. Steve felt as Tony's body clenched around his cock, causing it to try and perk back up to attention at the stimulation.
Clint watched as Stark raised his eyebrows at Cap and gave him a good-natured pat on the shoulder before he went to the locker room to finish suiting up.
She hadn't thought Steve liked guys in that way, but Steve had definitely looked at Tony's lips and then shown amusement at his sexual innuendo.
Steve settled his hands on Tony's hips and led the kiss, plunging his tongue into Tony's mouth. Tony shifted closer in his lap and Steve could feel his cock begin to take an interest.
Him and Tony were supposed to be partners. To hear Tony accuse him of seeing him as only a subordinate to order around had cut him deep.
Natasha, Steve and Tony had gotten back to the tower. Tony had grumbled his way through many hugs as the rest of the team saw him.
She smirked. "Maybe just a little. You might have poisoned them or something. I'm training with Clint later today and I need to stock up on some protein."
to think. He could see the benefits in both, but he seemed uncomfortable that the decision came down to him. What if he said yes and Thanos got all the stones and the multiverse was defeated? Or the power
“Because she’s finally had enough of your bullshit, Thanos,” Gamora said. “And this time you’ve gone too far. I was young when you stole me from my home. I was young and naïve and just lost my entire planet, and found myself in your care, and I was desperate to be loved, to matter, to be safe, even if it meant the person who murdered my planet became my father. You stole my childhood and you’ve ruined so many lives, and you’ve finally gone too far. No one wants you to be the ruler of their universe, Thanos. You’ll never be a god.”
"Yeah. But do you all really want to know about his other world? Once you know, you can't go back. Trust me, I wish I could and not know about this world, but we don't always get what we want."
Natasha’s phone buzzed on the bedside table. She rushed to check it, hoping it was Matt. It was just Foggy, giving her the time and location for the charity function tonight.
“Steve…well, Steve from my world, was born back in the 1920s, tried to get into the army during World War II. They did some experimenting on him, made him into a super soldier. He went from skinny, asthmatic kid to like…holy muscles. Got super strength and hearing and all that good stuff. Fought in World War II, crashed a plane into the Atlantic, got frozen in ice for like 70 years, and then came back to us.”
.” The vitriol was back in Loki’s tone. Thor had to resist the urge to roll his eyes at his ill-tempered younger brother.
“You still have the other stone from your universe in your pocket, yeah? Maybe if you just…think about going back to your world, you’ll go back, no questions asked?” Tony chimed in.
“….pitting us against each other, years of us fighting for your affection and attention. You wanted us to hate each other.” Clint realised he was back at the scene of Gamora verbally attacking Thanos. Just like that, Steve turned back time, Clint was back in his perch, watching everything go down.
“We need rings.” Tony gasped when Steve pulled back for breath. “How do you feel about rose gold? Or maybe silver is more your style?”
Steve half carried, half dragged Tony to his cot in the back room, setting him down on it. Tony closed his eyes immediately, too drained to protest.
Tony let out more noises as he vigorously fucked into him, letting out a stuttered moan every time Steve slid home. Steve felt a thrill run through him, especially seeing at how quiet Tony was as he prepped himself earlier.
Steve nodded his agreement. “That he was. He was our town blacksmith, which means we're in need of a new one. I was thinking maybe you would be up for the task.”
Bucky watched as Tony moved to steal a meatball off of Steve's plate with a cheeky grin, but instead of Steve batting Tony's hand away like he had every time Bucky had tried to do the same thing, Steve just let him off with an eye roll.
Natasha turned back to the computer screen, explaining to Tony what she knew of the multiverse and how to the machine worked. It was easy to see how intelligent of a woman she was. She held herself so confidently and looked so sure of herself, even in this situation and Tony couldn't help but admire his counterpart.
"Ask me what?" A voice said and then Steve Rogers was entering the room, wearing jeans and a form fitting blue t-shirt.
Tony did end up sticking around. It was actually through town gossip that he discovered that Tony Stark was actually
Tony turned his head to stare at Steve. Steve who was laying next to him. Tony could clearly see the rise of fall of his chest and feel the heat coming off his body. Tony inhaled sharply and scrambled at Steve's shirt, pulling it down to see his chest. Tony put a tentative hand on Steve's skin, tracing the ridged keloid scars over his heart.
While Steve and Tony were currently dating other people, it was Betty's job to plan for all possible outcomes because if the media got wind of... whatever was happening here, it had the potential to be a PR nightmare. Betty made a detour to the coffee maker because she knew she would be working long into the night for how to spin this should their relationship become something more.
Steve watched as Tony shucked off his tiny underwear that really didn't seem like it was all that comfortable to wear. Tony kept his silk purple robe on as he reached behind himself with slick fingers.
Tony shook his head quickly. “No, Steve never hit me, though I doubt he would take too kindly to me hitting on him.”
Tony gave her an incredulous look. “Me? Ask out Steve?” Tony tsked. “I'd get decked in the face before I finished the sentence.”
Steve knew he should stop. He knew both him and Tony were using each other as a means to an end but he couldn't bring himself to pull away.
With everything that had happened he just want to check on him. Make sure he hadn’t done something stupid like drunk himself to death over Natasha or something.
The ball was in Steve's court. His hands itched to put his hands on Tony's hips, in his hair, on his-
Bullseye narrowed his eyes and clenched his fists, looking ready to argue with Steve. After a tense moment, Bullseye sneered at Steve before turning on his heel and storming out.
Things had been a little tense since her and Steve had broken up. It had been amicable sure, but he still wasn't crazy about her talking with Hank and it showed.
“You're not from around here, but if you value your life you shouldn't be starting fights with Fisk's men.” Steve warned, leading him out of the saloon doors and down the street.
Steve swallowed, knowing Tony meant Jan but felt himself shift under Tony’s scrutiny thinking he’d seen what was underneath the surface.
Steve sat back down and Tony took a chance by resting his head on Steve's shoulder. Steve tensed briefly but didn't push him off. Steve relaxed after a moment and wrapped an arm around Tony's back. Tony shut his eyes and let out a contented sigh.
Tony pulled back first, breath coming in heavy pants. “So, I take it you missed me?” Tony asked lightly.
Tony frowned. “I'm sorry to hear that.” He said, taking another sip of his drink. “He was a good man.”
Bucky huffed a laugh as Tony theatrically told them a story that, had it been anyone else, would have probably been made up.
He heard the tv click on again, but it all was just background noise over the warm presence of Steve.
Natasha let out a snort. “I did and I honestly can't tell if you're more shocked or jealous about it."
Steve spent an hour in the gym beating one of the punching bags to a pulp and felt most of his initial anger deflate. Tony was under a lot of stress in their current situation, not the mention the fact he'd been trapped in another dimension, alone, for months. Even without all that, Steve knew Tony has always been insecure about not doing enough, of not being enough. Steve sighed and went to go back up to go talk to Tony and found him cornered and being attacked by MODOK and company.
It had been a long mission and Stark had pulled a stunt that had saved their asses and neutralized the threat but had went against Roger's orders to do so and he was none too happy about it.
Steve felt his cheeks redden at the brazen words and was grateful the man wasn't facing him as he marched him out.
She just gave him an amused look. “Not that I want to interrupt your reunion but we are kind of in the middle of an enchanted tomb.”
Tony looked at him over his glass, eyebrow slightly furled. “Again, you got what you came for. No need to stick around.”
Tony closed his eyes and took in the silence of the penthouse. He hadn't gotten around to hiring new help yet and everything looked exactly as he left it. He walked over to the bar and mixed himself a vodka tonic, savoring the bitter flavor on his tongue as he took a long swig.
Tony collapsed down even further into the sheets, panting heavily. Steve eased himself out, slightly mourning the loss of Tony’s tightness and heat before he flopped down beside him.
Steve could tell there was something Tony was sore about but decided to not press the issue, instead taking Tony's hand and shaking it. “Well, Tony, are you planning on sticking around?”
Tony came to feeling warm and safe. He opened his eyes and stared at the familiar ceiling and jolted violently when he realized where he was. Steve's place. He had vowed never to set foot in this building again. Tony tried to get out of bed but a firm arm tightened his grip on him.
There was the brief hiccup of Loki betraying them and trying to take over the world but they had defeated him and Steve now had Tony back in his arms.
“The Avengers, huh?” Tony said. “So, I take it you're Iron Man, or rather Iron Woman in that group?”
Tony could guess well enough from his own experiences what had provoked that response and moved to change the subject before he put his foot in his mouth and upset her further.
Steve wasn't sure how long he and Tony stayed sitting like that, but soon he heard the deep and even breaths that told him Tony was asleep.
Steve gave him a smile, trying not to think too hard on how awful these past few months must have been for Tony between being trapped in an alternate dimension without a body and then on Battleworld with next to nothing. “Well, knock yourself out. I'm gonna go brief the rest of the team on what happened.”
Natasha shook her head. “No, though I do have a cousin who loves to give me hell every now and then. You?”
Even so, Steve always worried for Tony, especially so when they let the Beyonder captured them, but he trusted Tony to do what he needed to do.
Tony gave her a wide grin as he sat down in the rolling chair and wheeled it over. “This is hardly the weirdest thing that's happened to me. Besides, it's not all bad news with such pleasant company as your own.”
Steve reached into his pocket and pulled out a ring box, opening it up. Tony looked stunned, letting Steve slide the simple gold ring onto his finger, giving it a soft kiss before he let Tony's hand drop.
The two of them turned back to the tv to watch as Danielle discovered her supposed baby daddy was back from the dead.
He left the saloon an hour later and found Tony sitting on the back steps of his office. Tony was still holding the whiskey bottle but a third of it was gone now.
Natasha stepped forward and pulled him into a hug. “It was nice to meet you, Tony. Please take care of yourself.”
Steve shook his head, knowing he had a dopey smile on his face and followed Natasha and Tony as they exited the room.
Tony shrugged. "No idea. I woke up to your lovely wife holding a gauntlet to my head and asking me a similar question."
Steve watched as Tony's fingers disappeared into his hole. He fucked himself on them, thrusting them deep inside. Tony was pretty quiet during all of it, only letting out a few hitched breaths and one tiny moan at a particularly well angled thrust. Eventually Tony added a third finger and Steve unzipped his pants and took himself in hand. He could've come just like that, watching as Tony stretched himself open, but he held off.
Tony looked around in confusion and, yeah this lab wasn't one of his. It was sort of familiar in an odd way but he'd definitely never been here before.
Clint hadn't expected to see Stark and frowned when he did. While the billionaire was financing the Ultimates now, Stark himself had been taking a break from the team, which was code for 'drinking himself into an early grave'. After the mess that was Natasha, Clint wholly understood the sentiment. Clint pushed down the mess of emotions he felt about Natasha's betrayal and his family's senseless murder, closing his eyes and taking a few deep breaths.
“So…” Tony said when he finally caught his breath, shifting his body toward Steve’s. “That happened.”
Steve fumbled for the condom packet as Tony finally looked back at him. “Oh boy, I'm in for one hell of a ride.” Tony said as he regarded Steve's length. Tony sat back on his heels and lube in hand. “Can I do the honors?”
Tony hummed and Steve wondered what that would have felt like if his lips had been on Tony's neck when he did that. “Not that drunk.” Tony countered.
Natasha gave him an amused look, pulling him to his feet with surprising strength. “You aren't so bad yourself.” She smirked at him briefly before she turned back to her computer. “So, the good news is since I have your radiation signature I know where to send you back home. The bad news is it'll take a few hours to calibrate the machine to do so.”
Jan rolled her shoulders and settled back in her chair feeling a heaviness lift off her chest as she listened to the rest of the meeting.
Tony knew there was no atoning for his sins and they had come back to bite him in the worst way possible, to ruin the only good thing in this life.
True to his word, Tony was there with not a minute to spare. His hair was slightly damp but he was clean and looked more like his old self.
Bucky felt a bit flummoxed at this revelation and turned to Gail to see what she had thought about that exchange. Her were lips were turned up and she gave Bucky a knowing nod. She grabbed his hand under the table and gave it a gentle squeeze.
Tony hurriedly snatched the bottle of whiskey off the counter and walked out before Steve could respond.
Steve pulled out to the tip and pressed back in slow, relishing in the sound of Tony groaning at the fluid motion. Steve took that as encouragement and did the same thing again but a touch faster.
Tony stepped through the portal and walked right into his sitting room. He turned around to see Natasha and Steve waving at him. He watched as they faded and the portal glimmered out of existence.
Steve shared a long look with Natasha before turning back to him. “Well, you know him best I suppose.” Steve said with a shrug.
“I thought he was a security contractor?” Toni hums noncommittally. “Does everyone work for the government now?”
“No.” Pepper grabs my face and stares at me fiercely. “No, it’s not stupid. You are a generous, kind, and impossibly endearing woman that deserves happiness. Maybe it’ll be with Steve, maybe it won’t, but trust me, it is not stupid.”
Pepper immediately shakes her head. “No Toni, I don’t think that it would be something I’m comfortable with.”
When she’s gone, Steve feels like all the air has left the room and his energy dims. Steve doesn’t exchange words with Toni at all that night. But for some reason Peggy is uncommonly cold to him after they leave.
Peggy moved out the following day, while Steve was out interviewing a girl who had won a full ride scholarship for a local college. Before leaving that morning, he’d called her to let her know that he wouldn’t be working from home that day, left her a voicemail when she didn’t pick up. But she didn’t call back, instead she took this information and used it to her advantage in order to avoid him as she went for her things.
Grunting in response, I start my shower back up. Quickly I lather myself up and rinse, not stopping to dwell on my negative thoughts from earlier.
When they arrive at Sam’s home, Clint is outside decked in his gear. Steve is suddenly very aware that Nat is still in her Black Widow tact suit and he is wearing sweatpants and a faded Dodgers t-shirt. Figures that the moment shit hits the fan, he’s the one not in his suit.
Bucky chuckles. “Yeah, I can see that.” He ponders his decision for a single moment. “Let’s talk about the foundation first, if you don’t mind.”
“Steve, Toni needs to know so that James’s position can be covered.” Nat says in a soft voice. It is her ‘cooperate or else’ voice but Steve is too overwhelmed with what they’re saying. “At least give her a call, you don’t have to go in and talk to her in person.”
“Jarvis,” I say gleefully after finally completing my tests successfully. “Jot this down. Maneuverability And Reconnaissance Kit, aka MARK I is a success.”
Pepper had finally agreed to be CEO—last week’s toxicity reading provoking me to pressure her until I received a response—but I know that she would hate for me to wander around without any form of communication so I put on my newest pair of shades and earbud connected to Jarvis. And just in case I had to fight back, I slipped on my bracers that could turn into gauntlets in less than five seconds.
I beat Pepper to the conference room where we would have our impromptu meeting for the Barnes Foundation by at least a half minute. I barely have time to sit down when the door bursts open and she stalks inside. She’d changed, now wearing a peach colored pencil skirt and blazer that somehow manages to accentuate her red hair instead of clashing. Her heels are perilously high as always.
“Right, right.” I shrug, leaving my hair be. In any case, I’d just gotten back from a kidnapping, both can go fuck right off if they have any issues with how I look. “I’m getting in the elevator as I speak.”
“I didn’t know that Hill was still in contact with you?” He frowns at me. Maybe I shouldn’t mention that it was Jarvis. Then his expression clears, and he backtracks immediately. Ah, there’s the Steve I know and love. “I mean, not that I’m trying to imply anything—”
Rhodey’s posture snaps military straight before giving me a quick nod. “We should get going though. We have a flight to catch.” He shivers suddenly. “And Pepper is going to fucking kill me if we don’t make it back as quick as possible. I’m going to go see if the transport is ready.”
“I remember that, I was the one who posted bail for the dude.” Against my better judgement, my lips curl into a smile. After my own dealings with Stern, I had J scan all news for anything to do with the guy. As soon as I knew that the guy who managed to punch Stern had a million-dollar bail, I ordered my lawyers to get to work. “Your friend is my hero.”
Well, this is it guys. As i said in the last chapter, this is mostly an epilogue of sorts. The main story (if you can even call it that *sobs*) ended in the previous chapter and this is the last thing i wrote for this AU. I had a general idea of how the Avengers would get together, considering that Steve was unfrozen earlier and Bucky was still in the picture, but I couldn't get past the initial gobsmacked Steve finding out that Iron Man = Toni.
“I will pass the message to Fury.” Coulson’s expression still hasn’t changed from his unperturbed indifference but there’s something brewing in his normally brown eyes that make me feel like I’ve managed to accomplish something with this talk.
.” I look out the window. “I have less than a month left, and you want me to commit to some team that probably will implode in less than ten seconds? I have better things to do with my life than to get caught up in Shield’s web of deception.”
He walks over to a pair of legs still connected to the main torso of a body, removing the Glocks from the holsters and tucking them into his waistband. A faint whir behind him makes him turn around abruptly.
She tells him with blunt honesty how she was shattered when she found out that her godfather Obadiah had used her company to sell weapons to terrorists. And how that spurred her on to cancel the weapons division and focus on healing the world instead.
What worries me is the immense pressure on my chest that prevents me from breathing deeply. I open my eyes and see darkness. Oh god, I’m blind. Fuck! Fuckfuckfuckfuck…
Things went on in this manner for a long time. Steve hated Bucky every second that he looked like the poster child for a healthy thriving kid. And Bucky hated Steve every second that he had to spend in the Rogers home with his Ma, reminded of just how shitty his life was. And nothing changed until they were ten.
He hangs up even though his heart clenches at the thought of her crying alone. But Toni’s precious AI is as efficient as always, sending him a message before he hangs up.
Steve clears his throat, tamps down his wayward thoughts, and continues, “Why do you think so many news outlets focus on your gender instead of your many philanthropic achievements?”
“I didn’t mean—” His tone is gentle, his expression so fucking familiar to me that I cut him off before I throw myself at him.
Suddenly, someone bumps into me and I spill my deliciously healthy juice all over my hoodie, “Fuck!” I start to pat at myself furiously with napkins. This is my favorite—
The goon, whom Yinsen says is named Khalil, looks at me angrily before shouting out commands to his lackeys. Two of them march into the room, one grabbing Nadira by the hair and drags her before Khalil while the other points their weapon at me. She screams, tears running down her face, but she quiets immediately when he places his weapon against her forehead.
“Bucky’s gone.” He winces at the way that sounds. Now she probably thinks that he’s dead. “Not dead! Just… missing. He worked for Shield and never made it back from a mission.”
“Steve my parents…my parents are—my parents are dead!” She screams before dissolving into tears again.
and now after I finally escape, I find out that I’m dying of palladium poison. So I don’t know Rhodey. I don’t fucking know what the hell I did so bad to deserve this!”
I scowl. “No, the Iron Man suit is a part of me.” But it’s not exclusive. “I can build another one so that you can take it back to your superiors. It won’t respond to anyone that isn’t you, but it will at least stop their salivating for Iron Man.”
I snort, yeah let’s have this groundbreaking conversation where I confess to my gold titanium alloy shenanigans in my bathroom.
“Listen Steve, if you don’t want to tell me the truth, that’s fine.” I look at him in the eye. “Just don’t try to lie to my face.”
This is starting to sound like a buddy club. Which, despite my near adoration for Steve’s ass, is not my cup of tea.
The man starts to laugh even as I start to dismantle his suit to get him handcuffed. “I have made the god bleed. That is enough for me.”
And wow, that guy is really attractive. He isn’t as tall as Steve, but his lean frame more than makes up for it. He wears his chestnut hair in a messy bun, with a couple of wisps framing his face and gorgeous chocolate brown eyes. And, judging by the empty sleeve dangling next to his body, Mr. Handsome is also Bucky Barnes.
Steve answers her truth with his own. He grew up sickly, much smaller than the others in his grade and plagued with asthma. Combined with his disregard for bullies and photographic memory, he was the main target for harassment. He’d never gotten a second look from any of the girls at his school, much less any of the guys.
“What?” Steve had been expecting several things, but this had not been one of them. “Shield is not Hydra!”
The email had been short and to the point: his work on everything pertaining to Stark Industries had been great for their image and they wanted to make sure that he was rewarded handsomely for any future pieces on them. If he were so inclined to receive further information, they required he get in contact with them via email so that an in-person meeting with their department head can be set up for him.
Natasha looks at both men with a telling glance. Apparently, she’s the one in charge of this business. Steve glances at Clint again, but the other man merely shrugs and continues fiddling with his bow.
He wishes that he could do something, anything to make her feel better. But he’s also conscious that only time will soothe this wound.
I sit up slowly, wincing as I feel bruised on every part of my body. My tongue feels dry and I look around for water but see nothing. I don’t think I can manage walking just yet. I feel my limbs shaking even when I’m sitting.
He obligingly goes in that direction without pausing to look at the opulence of Toni’s world. When he arrives to her apparent room, he opens the door and sees her crumpled on the floor against her bed.
They give me the materials quickly, a mere two days after I make the request. When they deliver the materials, Nadira and Yinsen are held at gunpoint, to ensure my compliance.
I crash. Hard. For several seconds after the impact, I lay still, unable to fully process that I survived my escape attempt. Then I get up, aware that I have to leave behind my armor, the weapon that Yinsen had helped me build. I start my trek, grief still battering my heart. Fortunately, I’d escaped with my clothing: a long-sleeved shirt, white top and pants with boots. At least the surprisingly chill night won’t feel so bad. I walk for miles, letting stars guide my way until my aching legs buckle under me.
This new development makes him worry about her. Something must have happened in Afghanistan to trigger such a complete roundabout in character. He’d hoped that he had found her in time to avoid suffering so much but it seems that he had been too late anyway. Of course, this just shows that she no longer trusts him. They’d spoken on the phone a week earlier and she hadn’t told him any of that. Before Afghanistan, she’d have told him in a heartbeat.
HI! so i'm sorry for such a short update and for such crap content but honestly this chapter got rewritten like five times before i just gave up. :( i really wanted Steve and Toni to spend more time together, but it just wouldn't come together like i wanted.
When I’m finally at the mouth of the cave, I start to load my launchers but notice that the lag is greater than I’d calculated.
Stealthily, they climb the rickety stairs of Bucky’s apartment complex. They reach the apartment and after a single shared glance, they decide to knock.
I envy him. He looks completely sure that he’ll return to his girls. I wish I could be half as optimistic as he. But I will at the very least ensure that he gets back. It’s too late for Nadira but I will give everything for him to be able to make it back.
“I just wanted to say thank you.” Steve shuffles his feet, obviously insecure. “It means a lot to Bucky that you chose to help him and others like him out.”
isn’t completely fascinating, but we have to get a move on. I have to take Barnes’ measurements and start making prototypes.”
, he reads off his phone. Dropping with a clatter his cleaning utensils, he hurries to his quarters for his suit.
“um, I think since always?” Pepper shrugs before standing up. “Rhodey knows more than I do. Do you want me to get in contact with him for you?” I shake my head, still in shock. “I have to go Toni. I’m leaving for Malaysia today for a meeting with the plant directors over there.”
She trails after him as they make their way out towards the elevator, chattering about her inventions. Most of it sails way over Steve’s head but she always seems content to use him as a sounding board, even if he doesn’t always understand everything.
A couple of months after Steve accepts the offer from SI’s PR team, he bumps into Toni for the first time. Not that it’s a surprise that it took so long. He’d been told since the beginning that aside from the moments when he got a scheduled interview, Toni would rarely make an appearance near their floor in the tower. Despite living in the tower, her quarters are so closely guarded by her tech that they might as well be in another planet.
“J, send eighty percent of energy to the boots.” I straighten out and feel the push of my repulsors as I get closer and closer to the moon.
I stay there by the door until the elevator doors close and she’s gone. Loving Pepper has always been an easy thing. She’d wormed herself into my heart from the moment she’d stood her ground against me. I’d always been difficult to manage, and frankly, she had been a godsend from the moment she was hired. Before her, my office and work life had been pure chaos.
He’d canceled all of his appointments and interviews he had on his agenda, opting instead to stay home and stare at the papers until the words became nothing but a blur. He’d ignored Nat and Bucky’s calls, even shutting the door on Sam’s face when he’d showed up unannounced at his apartment. It wasn’t until, ironically enough, he’d received an email from Toni’s PR team that he finally felt something other than the huge weight of apathy.
Thanks to the time they spend together, their relationship slowly morphs from exclusively work related to something resembling a friendship. On their flights back to the US, they always had the opportunity to talk. At first, these had been stilted, much like their first encounter in Stark Tower. But as time goes on, Toni slowly opens up to Steve.
When I’m finally breathing normally, she pulls away and looks at me solemnly. “Toni, you haven’t had a panic attack in months.”
Although, nothing is ever just anything when it comes to her. Despite only managing to make a hairline fracture to her aloof persona, that defense for those who generally can’t fight back made her much more human. Women identify with the misogynistic world she painted with an almost hurtful certainty. After all, who better to speak about the troubles of women than a woman.
He stands, walking over to her chair. Toni stretches her hand and he takes it, pulling her out of the chair while ignoring the sudden racing of his pulse. Despite being her friend for now well over a year, he still feels that gut wrenching desire around her; it’s just become easier to disguise.
“Nah, I’ve got it.” Bucky sits up in his chair, spine military straight. “This charity has my name on it, and I don’t shirk my duties.”
But the email had served a purpose: he’d surfaced from that deep cesspool of misery enough to interact with the world again.
Something big, powered by the reactor. Of course, that’s supposing the reactor can be miniaturized and remain stable enough without blowing me up when I build it.
“He got his arm blasted off by a Stark Jericho missile and yet he has zero benefits as a result of that stupid punch he set off on Stern.” All my amusement dies off and I feel a sickening lurch in my midsection. Here it is. “Today my best friend calls me to let me know that he finally fucking proposed to his guy because of the confidence boost the possible prosthetic will give him. And now that son of a bitch cancelled the whole program because of his ego.”
Shield agents didn’t necessarily love Steve Rogers on sight just because he served the country occasionally with a red, white and blue suit—and seriously, was it really necessary to make it that tight? This far from loving sentiment duplicated ten-fold when everyone found out Fury died.
But my tears keep falling and despite Steve’s soft voice in my ear, I can’t—won’t deny myself this moment of weakness. I can be strong later, right now I just need someone to hold me while this pain runs its course.
Her stupid date has no idea how lucky he is that she chose him. And make no mistake, she chose him. Her eyes might be flinty pieces of amber when she turns to look at the man, but appreciation is clear on her face whenever she sweeps her gaze over her arm candy.
I let go of the whip, choosing to blast my repulsors at his face. In his surprise, he lets go of me, and I take advantage to grab hold of the whips.
When he got back, the sudden absence of Peggy’s effects made everything scarily final. Steve had tried calling her as soon as he realized what she did, but the call went straight to voicemail. It wasn’t until that evening that she called him back to tell him that she wanted to take some time away from him to think things through.
“What? You’re just gonna accept it like that?” I raise an eyebrow at him. “No twenty questions, evidence?”
He gives me a soft hug, like he was afraid I would break, before pulling back to sit next to me. “Next time, you should listen to advice. If I say going to Afghanistan is a bad idea,
An uncharacteristic blush spreads over my cheeks and I give her a wide smile before kissing her softly. “You play a mean bargain Ms. Potts but never let it be said that a Stark quits so early in the game.” She laughs before waving at Coulson, and then she’s gone.
“No, it’s great!” I jerk out of the chair and head out to the elevator. “I just need to make some tweaks between that suit and mine and it’ll be fine.”
She flattens the lapels of her blazer in one quick movement before standing straight. “Uh-huh.” Then without another look at Steve, she saunters off.
“Right.” Bucky had looked at Steve doubtfully. Steve’s clothes were covered in dirt, his shirt was speckled with his own blood, and his arms were covered in scratches. “I can see that.
.” Bucky’s cackle reverberated through the tiny speakers. “I told Sam that there was something definitely going on!”
She grimaces and starts to argue with Happy, while tugging me towards the car. I let myself be led, enjoying fondly the snark between my friends. Eventually even Rhodey joins in, and I allow myself to relax.
Steve raises his gaze to the man shouting at him. Stocky build, average height with dirty blonde hair. Favors his left leg and holds his rifle in his right. Easy pickings.
Steve pauses the video and sighs. So it’s true. Toni really did build the Iron Man suit. It doesn’t surprise him in regards of her capability. He’d known that she’s a brilliant engineer, but it does shock him that she’d build another weapon again. She’d seemed so certain of her refusal to continue building weapons. Of course, not that Steve had a leg to stand on given that he killed on government’s orders. But still, Toni had wanted to heal the world, not set it on fire.
When I finally regain awareness of my surroundings, I’m on a cot inside a dusty tent. The heat feels oppressive, but it reassures me that I’ve left the cold of that cave.
“I thought I didn’t qualify for the super-secret boy band?” I say with no trace of bitterness. Nope, none at all. “What happened to reckless and not a team player?”
“Barnes, listen, that’s nice of you to say but the media can be downright nasty.” I warn. “If you have any sort of secrets in your past, they will dig it up and prance it around for their five seconds of glory. Your life will be under constant review. Maybe you won’t reach the same level of celebrity status as I have but trust me, paparazzi will be after you like a thorn in your side.”
Suddenly, the bathroom door slams open and I hear the click of heels on marble. The glass door of my shower slides back and suddenly Pepper is there.
“Aren’t you worried that they might use your charity as a front for other activities?” Steve is acutely aware that she could pull away at any moment and wants to hit as many topics as he can before she shuts down. “According to a couple newspapers, your director for the Señora Guadalupe Foundation has been embezzling you for years.”
Not that he has any hopes of this staying that way. Steve is nowhere near as good a spy as Nat, but his enhanced hearing has helped him overhear whispers that are making him very nervous.
Toni looks at Steve exasperated. “Come on Rogers, we can’t get awkward with each other. You’re my best man on the PR front.”
I ignore the look on her face and nod. “I’m Iron Man.” Rhodey doesn’t say anything, his face a careful clean slate. “Say something Rhodey bear.”
But her efficiency isn’t the only thing that made me love her. She was the first one to notice that I tended to spiral into manic engineering binges and horrible depressive slumps and pushed me to go to therapy. She became the first girl who also became my friend, never becoming judgmental over my choice of partners.
“Over the years, it seems that people forget that I gave all the information I was going to give during one stupid interview when I was still a minor. Nothing has changed.” She downs the rest of her whiskey in one gulp. “I hire people who are efficient and qualified to do their job. The gender they identify with or have sex with, as well as the color of their skin have nothing to do with our hiring process. Now are we done with the interview? Because I’d like to finish this off in bed, naked and sweaty.”
But I will regroup. I will survive. And I will come back and eliminate every single one of these worms until Ten Rings is nothing, but bones turned to dust.
“Yeah.” He feels like he has so much to say. “I’m sorry.” The calls disconnects just as he apologizes.
“Are you aware that by hiring LGBTQ+ and PoC you endorse their movement despite never giving any information about your sexual and gender orientation?”
She repeats the words calmly, patting my hands and back every so often. Slowly, so agonizingly slow, my breaths come easier. Feeling begins to return to my fingers and toes, then slowly to the rest of me.
The first thing I notice when I wake up is the low murmur of a man’s voice. I don’t recognize the language, but considering I failed French in high school, that’s not much.
I stand up abruptly. That reminds me, I have to start the drawings for the new arm I’m going to make for Steve’s bestie.
“I know. And I know about Fury because I made it a priority. I kept tabs through Jarvis, he gave me the news.”
“I owe them so much more than my stupid money can pay.” I say seriously. “I’m responsible for every single person who suffered from Stark weapons. I made the weapons that hurt them; I have to help the survivors. Unfortunately, that isn’t limited to just the civilians.”
They couldn’t understand that after fifteen years as Captain America in this modern future that might as well be a different planet, he was done with fighting. He’d thought Bucky would understand that he wanted nothing to do with violence after he’d almost died by American weapons. Instead, his best friend ran back to the same lifestyle as soon as he got the arm. Steve can’t say he agrees the reasoning behind Bucky’s decision, but he understands that after doing so much shit on Hydra’s orders, any sort of amends would feel like balm on his soul.
“Toni honey, I can’t understand you. Can you order Jarvis to send me the directions to my phone?” A muffled affirmative hum answers his question. “I’ll be there as quick as I can.”
“It’s just, I’m about to make a huge ass decision that will probably make all of them explode and it will be much, much easier if they’re distracted by my ass or thighs to put up a fight.” She picks at her fitted black skirt dejectedly. “I hate using my body like this but it’s for the greater good.”
“No but it is.” His baby blue eyes look at me earnestly and he moves closer. “I think you’re great for doing this. I know that most billionaires are the least inclined to help others but for some reason you’re different.”
“Good, I would hate to sue you if you ever open your mouth about what goes on in my company.” I smile at him. “But I’m sure that will never happen.”
Her gaze turns sharp before she gives him another half-grin. “All right, we’re starting off with the heavy stuff.” She looks towards the bartender that had been discreetly hovering in case she needed anything. “Get me a whisky on the rocks.”
HI ! I'm uploading two chapters today since I took so long to complete these. Honestly I just separated them since they were in different POVs but I wrote them continuously. This chapter marks the end of this work but i think we can all see where this is going. Dun dun dun.
“Steve, he said yes!” Steve rolls his eyes before yawning, half-heartedly tuning out Bucky’s happy babbles. He’d told Bucky that he had nothing to worry about, Sam adored his stupid ass. “—and then I finally grew a pair and he said yes!”
It’s there, standing under the spray of hot water, that I realize my mistake. I’m in too deep with Steve. I care about him.
The armor Toni made in the cave had been clunky, no finesse at all. But it’s understandable considering the circumstances while she created it. For the flaming pieces of shit that she'd produced thus far, there were no excuses.
“What is this? Are you trying to reverse psychology me?” I let out a short bark of laughter. “Please Coulson, save your games for someone who cares.” My eyes narrow behind my shades and I give him my best bitch face. “I told Fury that I would help him with the Bucky issue because he is the public image of my foundation, not because I want to be part of your super-secret band.”
Not that Jarvis was convinced that he was dead. Just thinking about that clusterfuck makes me sigh. Normally, I’d worry about it but damn it, I’m fucking dying slowly, and I have to at least apologize correctly. “Look Steve, I wish that I hadn’t been such an ass. Had I been less bitter about you turning military on me,” and basically ghosting me after the fact, “I wouldn’t have been such a pain. For what it’s worth, I’m glad that we could be friends.”
I suddenly feel heated, like my perfectly calibrated lab is hot and stuffy. “Uh, no it’s not a big deal. I have so much money it’s insane. I should be drafting better tax policies to send to the Senate instead.”
AYEEE I'm on a roll. I finally hit a breakthrough and I have several chapters ready. I might just post several chapters today and tomorrow so heads up!
. She always left work early and they found something new to try. They’d gone rock climbing, indoor skydiving, bungee jumping... The most memorable had been a cooking class, although not one of their best ideas. They’d gotten kicked out after almost setting the building on fire. Instead of getting angry, Peggy had laughed and said that that story was the one she was going to tell their kids.
I flail in the air, screaming for Jarvis, seeing the ocean below me hurtling towards me so impossibly fast. My suit comes alive at the very last moment, the tips of my hands skimming the water before I jet up into the sky again.
Her face is pale and drawn, blood speckling her left temple. Her hair is falling out of the tight braid she usually wears and it’s this last fact alone that clues him in to the seriousness of her news. Black Widow only begins to crumble when shit hits the fan big time.
Steve still wasn’t convinced, but even he knew that his reasons were flimsy. After he returned to active duty, it had been up to Bucky and Sam to help with the foundation. With both out of the picture, he can imagine Pepper’s stress levels. Toni had always been the main sponsor, her role mostly financial. But Bucky’s role had to be replaced as well as Sam’s advisory position to the committee that chose vets for the benefits.
As I pull out my phone from my pocket, Pepper and Rhodey are already looking concerned. Boy, and that’s before they get the news. I walk out of my bathroom and head out to my room, choosing to sit in a chair by the window before I speak.
“Let’s go.” I grit my teeth. Let’s see about righting some wrongs. It seems that I’m just in time because the moment I arrive in the village, there are several men with rifles shouting while pointing their weapons at women and children on the ground. I smile humorlessly. “J, put the translator on.”
The gloom starts to clear a bit, the silhouette of a person lit by the glowing brightness of fire. The person has their back to me, so I take the moment to look around me. The darkness makes it difficult to see, but I make out the unmistakable shapes of machine guns.
Steve is saying something but I’m sending off messages to my Finance department and my R&D team so they can whip up something by the end of the day. Pepper will definitely be much more organized about this and will know who else I need to get in touch with so the Barnes Foundation can be christened ASAP. And of course, I have to make Bucky’s arm myself. I pull up my favorite modeling program and start to draw the schematics for the arm when suddenly Steve’s arm punches straight through my hologram and he grabs my hand midair.
the life he had. “He might have been retired, but he still chose to return to active duty. That was his choice, and mine is to live the rest of my days without having to remember him.”
The first time Steve ever saw the elusive Stark heiress was during their annual expo. It had been one of the largest expos in…
“I don’t know Toni,” His features twist. “What if it backfires and instead leaves a volatile weapon in the hands of the Air Force?”
. Of course, much of it had to do with the CEO’s announcement to step down and allow his only daughter to become the new helm. Despite the huge strides for feminine empowerment and gender equality, none of this mattered when the news broke. Steve himself had been sent to the expo with strict instructions to find something vulnerable about this new CEO.
“We have a recall by the FDA due to one of the medical products malfunctioning in clinics and it hit our stocks pretty badly.” Pepper sounds genuinely stressed, which considering she’s kept her cool under other pretty shitty situations makes me worry as well. “Your CFO and Director of Finance of your South Asian plant are ready to talk numbers to avoid laying off employees.”
Bucky demonstrated a huge amount of restraint for a ten-year-old and didn’t argue. “Actually, I was curious. Why do you stand up to those kids if you know that they’re going to punch the snot out of you?”
“Pepper,” I whine. “After months of physical and psychological torture, all a woman wants is a cheeseburger and some peace.”
“Okay, so first we need to have establish a clear objective and that will serve as our mission…” As Pepper launches into a long explanation about the administrative aspects of our fledgling charity, I take the moment to zone out. I trust Pepper implicitly. She always knows how to manage my money and company better than I do.
her. He loved waking up next to her. Feeling so damned blessed to hear her soft snores and see her wispy red curls fanning over their pillows. Just the fact that he was the lucky bastard that got to see her wake up each morning used to make him feel so happy.
“Pick on someone your own size.” He’d been ready to throw hands, but the other boy had simply looked at him and laughed.
His heart sinks as he runs behind him. He can’t see any trace of his target, the people milling around packed too heavily to distinguish the civilian dressed assassin.
“What the—” Rhodey trails off when he sees that it’s Steve. Something looking scarily like awe flashing on his face before he looks at me. “Tones! You’re awake!”
“I want to.” I get out of my seat and take the hem of my sweatshirt in my hands. “My chest was shredded by burrowing shrapnel, one of the beautiful weapons I crafted years ago. The shrapnel is impossible to take out of my chest without going into cardiac arrest.” I take my sweatshirt off, leaving me only in my black tank top. My arc reactor glows a healthy blue, no sign of the poison running through my veins. “This thing,” I tap the metal of the reactor. “is keeping me alive. It’s a magnet, of sorts. The core is made of palladium and its slowly poisoning me.”
“Sir, if I may, that is not the healthiest way to navigate life.” Jarvis’ disapproval is clear. “I believe Captain Rogers is a good man. One that is trustworthy.”
“Joseph?” Steve’s mom had gotten up with a frown on her face, but without a sign of fear as she approached her husband. “Look at the state you’re in! Go on up and take a shower, I’ll put a pot on coffee on for you.”
They scream at me to get down on the floor before I can speak to them. Since I don’t reply they open fire. I aim my repulsors at the men, ignoring the pings of the bullets against my armor. “Hey assholes, I just want to talk.” They ignore me, so I fire. The screams they make as the heat of my repulsors burn their skin makes me grin.
But by that time, it’s too late. He takes the rifle from the dead soldier next to him and slips back into that mentality that saved him years ago when he led men to die and kill for their country. The weapon is a familiar heavy weight in his hands and it’s enough to make everything around him a blur until it clicks empty.
But Steve doesn’t know Bucky lives in constant fear, hiding from the shadows of his own father, and so he’s completely surprised when the other boy instead gives him a half-hearted smile. And the rest, as they say, was history.
As Steve picks his way past the now quiet snowscape, he fumes. Mostly because of his failure to find Bucky. But also because of his reluctant reliance on Iron Man. While Steve can understand hiding his identity from the world, there’s no reason why he should keep his identity from his teammates. Plus, the man is cocky and arrogant, always so quick to pick apart his orders and offer suggestions of what they could do better.
Whatever Jarvis mutters is lost on me as I bound out of my lab and head straight to my elevator. It opens as soon as I arrive and closes just as quickly behind me. In seconds I arrive at the employee’s cafeteria floor.
Rhodey must have seen something in my expression because he just sighs and scrubs a hand over his face. “Ok, fine. I’ll be in New York by the end of this week.”
“Always Sir.” Jarvis’s voice suddenly crackles through Steve’s computer speakers, startling him. “How may I be of assistance.”
I’d gotten the call from Jarvis nearly half an hour ago, but I’d assumed that Fury wanted to give me something helpful for my arc reactor problem.
So... it's short and it's shit. But hey, if you've read this far, you've probably noticed that's my MO.
I look at the tester in my hand and swear. Point one percent higher than two days ago. Time is ticking.
“Toni!” Pepper cuts me off. I pout but she steamrolls over my protests. “Now, I think the best course of action is to get together as soon as possible to get an idea about what we could do with the foundation and of course the foundation’s namesake needs to get involved too. The sooner we do all of this the better.”
“Toni, I have a passport.” Steve says giving her a look. “I’ve left the country with you before, remember?”
Yeah, nice try Rogers, I still find you much more attractive than tall, dark, and handsome over there.
Her lips twitch but she gives me a stern glare. “Please nothing outlandish. Your accountants are still in a mutinous state after your sudden decision to start 10 charities a week.” She makes her way out the stall, pausing only to say, “By the way, the meeting won’t start for at least another hour. I have to get changed too.”
He wears dark blue on black tactical gear with a white star emblazoned on his chest with twin red stripes on each side. “Since when do you dress like a soldier?” I say frowning. Beyond the outfit change, he holds himself different. Dangerously lethal. Combined with the thick beard and slightly unkempt longer hair he sports now, the soft, approachable Steve from PR might as well be someone else.
A sheepish smile crossed the older man’s face and he ducked his head as Sara continued to berate him before finally shooing him up the stairs.
Pepper gives a small wet chuckle, wiping away her tears with the backs of her hands. “I never thought that you would keep something like this from us either.”
“In the meanwhile, don’t come near me unless it’s with a cure or I will activate my gauntlets and to hell with it.” I tap one of my bracers and my gauntlet comes to life with a whine. I stare into Coulson’s eyes until he looks away and only then do I tap it back off. “Nice chat Coulson.”
“He’s been suffering a lot since Barnes’s disappearance.” She taps the tip of her fingernails on the rim of the porcelain cup. “I just hoped that you wouldn’t make him snap.”
“Think for a moment Cap, how else would Hydra know that Bucky was going to be in that specific mission?” Clint says.
Quickly I turn off my iron and run around looking for a moderately reflective surface to see if I don’t look like I’ve spent the past 24 hours in my lab. Which to my surprise (not really though), despite everything being stainless steel I only found a fucking spoon to look at myself in.
I blink at him and he nods his head before turning to leave. After he’s gone, I sit on my stool, still processing what just happened. “J, was I dreaming?”
Nat flicks her red curls expertly, a bored expression on her face. Nothing of what Steve is saying is news to her. “I know Steve, you’ve told me this multiple times. But as I keep telling you, she’s probably more hurt that you’ve ghosted her than the Captain thing.”
I pass out mid-flight, waking up as the jet starts to land. This time I feel much steadier and I only lean on Rhodey just a bit as I make my way off. Of course, my precious Pepper is at the tarmac and as soon as I clear the stairs, she launches herself at me.
“J put together a file on him. I want to know everything.” Then I remember his words about palladium poisoning. “And scan me for palladium poisoning.”
The reporters explode in a frenzy of shouted questions and she raises her hands in a call for silence. “I created the armor during a moment of extreme duress. As many of you know, I was kidnapped last year during the winter. My captors did not require a ransom from my corporation and instead requested me to build them a certain type of missile that had been very popular before I shut down the weapons division of SI. With the supplies they gave me, I built a crude version of the armor here before you and managed to escape. As a measure of security, and to avoid having the same situation happen, I have hired a person of highest confidence, whose identity shall be kept secret for their own safety, to use the MARK armor as my personal bodyguard. I know several will be requesting the military to take ownership of the armor, but the truth is, it belongs to me and nobody other than the person whom I have approved can ever use the armor.”
“As you wish Sir.” The image of a small village flashes on the HUD. “Last confirmed sighting is 10 hours ago.”
Steve raises his weapon, mindful that he is extremely outmatched compared to the walking WMD. “Hill sent me on this mission.” For all her faults, Hill doesn’t interrupt undercover missions. Not when that could mean the death of an agent.
He points a finger at me. “Iron Man’s armor is distinctive. I think nobody would see the glowing circle in your chest and doubt that you are Iron Man. Now get to the point Stark, I have an international incident on my hands that I have to resolve.”
“I’m flattered though.” He says sincerely. And the worst of it is that he is. He loves Peggy with everything he has but Toni is an extremely attractive woman. He’d have to be dead not to appreciate her.
I wave at him energetically anyway. Maybe if I pretend that everything is hunky dory he’ll calm down and tell me what got him all red and splotchy so early (anything before 2 pm is early ok?). When he sees me, all the red leaves his face and instead he turns paper white.
I look at my hands. “I like him. I-I care about him. A lot. That’s why I want to start the charity.”
The car slows to a stop and I look at our destination. My tower gleams next to the curb where the car sits idling.
“You have to be ready and in the conference room in less than five minutes Toni, I’m not kidding.” I grunt in affirmation. Five minutes? Psh, I can be there in three. “Toni, I swear if you’re not in there when I get there, so help me I will put in my two weeks’ notice.”
THank you to those who decided to give this fic a chance. Honestly, you guys are worth your weight in gold. Love ya'll.
With a grunt he angrily punches the bag and in the split second before it burst, he remembers that he should have held back.
Steve goes all concerned, apparently still able to see straight through my bullshit. “Are you okay?”
I ponder over this realization for several minutes before coming to the conclusion that even if I made her CEO, my dad would use the force of his majority to oust her before she could do anything meaningful. Hmmm, but maybe if I made her CFO…
Steve had always been a sucker for brown eyes. Peggy Carter had the most gorgeous chocolate brown eyes filled with a sharp intelligence that he’d barely been able to keep up with her even on the best of his days. And the Peggy that had been his wife, well she’d been gorgeous beyond words, her own eyes a rich mahogany.
He remembers that conversation vividly. He’d been ecstatic at her reaching out to him, rushing over his words as he greeted her before she cut him off brusquely.
Unexpectedly, that’s when an out of breath young woman clatters out from the elevator, immediately making a beeline for Toni.
Luckily for him, Toni merely blinks at him owlishly before slowly curving her red lips into a smirk. “Well, hello Steve. You don’t look half-bad yourself.” He stammers out a half-assed apology before she laughs. “Don’t worry so much Rogers, I’m dressed to kill because I have a meeting with the idiots of the board.”
Steve swears, hearing an echo of a strangled curse from Sam’s com, and pushes on. They run over several rooftops before Barnes chooses to jump from a six-story building onto the ground. Steve grunts out a curse before jumping behind him. He barely gets a glimpse of Barnes’ dark hair flying as the amnesiac runs full tilt into the open market next to the building.
She barrels past him, then inside she gives him a slap. “Get yourself together. James isn’t dead. He’s just not …. right.”
“I hit him with a dart filled with horse relaxant.” The unrepentant edge in Iron Man’s voice gets Steve’s blood pumping again, but again it’s only Sam’s expression as he cradles Bucky’s head that makes him hold back.
Steve had worked hard on his schoolwork in the hopes that his frequent absences wouldn’t hurt his grades, so he and Bucky were still in the same grade. Of course, their resentment to each other prevented them from spending time outside of the hours that their mothers forced them to. But on the day Steve stood up to his bully, Bucky found that he couldn’t let the punk get the snot punched out him.
After her parents’ funerals, they’d started a weekly ritual of meeting up on Fridays. Normally he would be the one to go downstairs into her lab to drag her out of her experiments and work. If left to her own devices, she’d definitely go without sleep for at least 24 hours.
“Come on Iron Man, I do not have all day.” A heavy accented male voice booms out from the suit. “I heard you have been looking for me.”
“According to my figures, this version will sustain significant damage but can overpower the other suit.”
She talks about growing up with the pressure of not being the boy her father always dreamed of. Of not being the girl that her mother expected her to be, and the expectations placed on her by society ever since it got out that she was a prodigy.
So i'm going to change the rating to mature just in case things get steamier later on and i accidentally publish smut while it's still in Teen and up.
Steve had stumbled to the ground, blood flowing out of nose, but he got back up again. He launched himself at the other boy and they rolled around on the ground exchanging punches. Of course, they attracted the attention of the others and they soon had a ring of kids around them egging them on.
Steve gapes at her, half-heartedly remembering that he had prepared notecards just in case this happened. Although, that had been more ambition than any actual planning on his part. Exclusive interviews with reserved heiresses don’t just fall into wishful reporters’ laps.
Despite not having a big role in the department, on most days Steve’s job makes him feel like he is accomplishing something. As the sole member of the PR team allotted to Toni’s and SI’s philanthropic actions, he has the liberty to visit the different charities and events whenever Toni or Pepper go. He spends more time at the work sites: shadowing someone at a charity fundraiser is not really his cup of tea even if he makes his obligatory visit. It’s there that he notices that Toni prefers to work on things as well. At the beginning, he merely shadows her but after only a couple minutes watching her work and interact with others with a genuine desire to be there, he threw himself into the fray as well. And so it begins.
He barked out a couple of sentences to Yinsen, the only words I can recognize are my name, before gesturing to me.
“Pepper I’m dying.” The confession takes us both by surprise. I blink at her several times before I can regroup. “I’ve never told you how I survived Afghanistan.”
“The only reason we found you is because Steve talked to someone and went out looking for you.” Okay, we’re going to have this conversation. I set down the pliers and wire, then plunk myself down on my chair. “Toni, he was retired. He had dedicated himself to journalism and then somewhere down the line, he started to care about you—”
“Good to know. Then there’s my boyfriend Matt and his best friend Foggy, and our other friend Karen.”
“Damn it,” Matt cursed. Clint raised his eyebrows. It was probably the first time he’d heard the other man curse. “Fisk? Are you kidding me, Tasha? He’ll kill you!”
"No, I know. I'm married to Pepper here. But in the other world we're together and we're married and we're happy, and I really want to go back there."
"You didn't answer my calls last night. I called Foggy, but he said he hadn't heard from you either."
Five minutes later Karen was at the door and they both grabbed pizza before heading back up into their room to talk about whatever they had been talking about on the phone. Tony couldn't keep up anymore. His teenager was confusing.
No, Natasha stayed until everyone was alive, well, and recovered from the fight with Thanos. Only then did she feel she could safely leave this strange world behind and go back to her own home.
"Steve, I wouldn't have fallen in love with you just because you have muscles. I met you at an art gallery opening, you were funny and kind and passionate about art, and I fell in love with that. I do care more about what people look like, you know.
“I was adopted after my parents were murdered in Russia. I was kind of a problem child for a while, but you and Daddy changed that. I mean, Bucky and I both came from shitty backgrounds, and you helped us.”
I keep forgetting to post this. I committed to posting Sunday nights and then I just like...never actually post it when I tell myself I am. This is why I never post long fics, lol. Sorry for anyone (if anyone actually cares) who cares about this.
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
“Father always said you were treated fairly,” Thor argued, though he swallowed at the genuine pain in Loki’s voice.
Natasha stepped in again to diffuse the situation. “Okay, okay. Both of you, stop. Before we start doing anything, we need to figure out how to destroy these stones, which means research. Can we do that first?”
He was back in the real world, on the cold ground, holding Natasha’s broken body in his, the rest of the Avengers staring at him.
Once Natasha's bedroom door was shut and locked, she turned to her best friend. They sat their plates of pizza on her bedside dresser.
The Incident: When Trickshot used him to steal, Clint ran away from the circus and lived on the streets, pick pocketing to survive. He tried to steal from Agent Phil Coulson, who turned him into S.H.I.E.L.D., and thus began his training.
Clint held up his quiver. “Yes, ma’am. I’ll have eyes on you all night. If anything goes wrong, I’ll step in.”
“Pepper? Really? Well, I guess if I were straight, Pep would be the one I would want to be with. Makes sense.”
“Pepper texted to say he hasn’t woken up yet. Natasha finally fell asleep. She said to take your time.”
He heard someone choke trying not to laugh, a thud, and then a pained groan, and Tony really needed to know what was going on. "Why am I drunk?" he asked, finally opening his eyes to see a blurry haze of people staring at him.
He tried desperately to cling to his existence, the one he was terrified would melt away, the one where he got his happy ending with Steve.
They headed out of the hospital room to the activity room designed for the longterm patients. Bucky’s eyes lit up when he saw his big sister.
"Oh. You mean Edwin Jarvis. No, unfortunately he passed away many years ago here on this world. What I meant was the artificial intelligence you created. You named him after your butler."
