Weekends had never been his thing at Hogwarts, they allowed more time for boredom, and supplied Seb and the others more time to torment him… still, John had asked him to breakfast,
“Obviously, John.”
“A few of us gave them some butterbeer and sweets and sent them off to bed,” Steven said, nonchalantly, “We’ve got this.”
"Greg my friend. Molly. She have a good summer?"
“He told you?”
He was still in his uniform.
And she and Greg started to walk towards the Quidditch pitch, seemingly in pursuit of the Ravenclaw team.
“Sherlock-”
“Like what?”
“I-I’ll put the kettle on,” John squeaked.
“Yes, I suppose I am.” Mrs Holmes said, smiling, “Problem?”
John paused for a moment, “That’s comforting.”
“Anyway, let’s welcome him to Seventh Year potions. I doubt he’ll keep up. Sit!” Magnussen shouted the last word, and Sherlock lowered himself slowly to his desk. “Now, Potions!”
“Come on. Flourish and Blotts. Now.”
pasty into his mouth. This didn’t give his lady friend an overly attractive sight to look upon… but thankfully she laughed all the same. “Yeah, yeah it was okay. What you get up to?” He said finally, after insuring all of the food was well out of his mouth.
“Popped off to the pitiful remains of last night’s bonfire- obviously Hagrid wouldn’t have cleared it yet,” Sherlock said, nonchalantly.
“What was that?” John said, giggling, wiping foam from his lips.
“Since
John had heard Sherlock’s bedroom door slam from upstairs, which according to Mrs Holmes was his
“Don’t worry- We’ve got this, guys you just need to trust yourselves now-” John said, rather more rehearsed than he hoped they realised, in response to
Once on the train, procedure was a lot more to his liking. Sherlock merely had to occupy himself, and himself alone, for 8 hours and 12 minutes. He was good at this. Being shut in a compartment for an extensive length of time with a trunk full of books he hadn't read yet and spells he hadn’t studied... utter bliss. By the time 11 o'clock struck, and the train began gently chugging away from King's Cross, he'd already finished 13 chapters of "Flesh-Eating Trees of the World" and was finding it surprisingly okay.
“Oh,” Greg pondered this for a moment, “Who you kissing at midnight then John, go on?”
The following fortnight slugged along as the opening weeks of term often did, and subtle clues began emerging, signalling autumn was just around the corner. On the most recent mornings, earlier rising students were met with a chilling mist that settled throughout the grounds, causing many to begin bundling up on their way to breakfast. Alas, the milder weather had been returning by lunchtime, so many students were confused as what to wear, making frequent stops back at dormitories throughout the course of the day to dump their cloaks and jumpers.
Sherlock swallowed, “People don’t often like it. You might not’ve.” he trailed off, shyly.
“It’s one forty-five… better start making your- Oh bollocks.”
“Exactly,” he mumbled, “G’night…”
“Of course,” Mycroft smiled, not lifting his gaze from John, “Isn’t he lovely.”
John’s mouth went rather dry. He felt Sherlock’s eyes fall heavy upon him.
This bold endeavour to concentrate at two o’clock on their first day back, whilst well aware his best friend was most likely asleep somewhere, the late summer sun blazing through the window for the first time that day, was obstructed by the curly-haired sixth year to his left. Sherlock was drumming slowly upon his weighty stack of parchment, his slender fingers tapping and tapping rhythmically to a tune unknown to John. It wasn’t overly noisy, creating only a dull thud every sixth beat or so, but each tap of his fingertips nagged at him. He could see it in the corner of his vision, see the lack of notes being made and the fact his quill was not even in the ink pot. It was with a specific pound of his thumb that John turned to him,
“Nope,” Sherlock replied in earnest, smiling at her.
“So-” John started, adjusting the grip on his cup, “Sherlock says you work at the ministry?”
“I have yet to see it, I grant you.”
answers back to), some letters from his brother that he immediately ignored, a few from Mummy, to which Sherlock replied out of habit, but nothing of real importance.
The ceiling of the Great Hall was not everyone’s favourite element of being back at Hogwarts the next morning, when the breakfast was bathed in a greyish tinge and droplets of drizzle would appear on the tables at random intervals. It definitely didn’t improve Greg’s mood either, at the new found news that his and John’s first lesson of the term was double potions with the Slytherins.
His friend looked far too small to be about to start his seventh year. There was a running joke, which John was very much bored of, in which John was half Goblin. It wasn’t a great help to John that when the three went to Gringotts together before the start of their second year, the Goblin who took them to their vaults wasn’t a great deal smaller than little Watson, and John found it very difficult taking out his money when all he could hear was two giggling idiots behind him muttering “Gobbbliiin” at random intervals.
And with exchanges of goodbyes, John and Sherlock started briskly back up to the castle, their feet crunching amongst the vast expanse of fallen leaves as they went.
“Finish the tea,” he called behind him, “Don’t stand there idly, John. We have a case,” he snapped.
“Oh!” she said, turning suddenly, “Enjoy your early morning classes tomorrow too” she said, beaming wickedly, before pulling the portrait-hole shut.
“You worry about him, don’t you,” the boy persisted.
John smirked at him.
. My friend Greg.
“It’s a really nice pipe!” louder than imagined.
“Fine,” and with that, Sherlock flicked his wand, knocking over the bag of flour onto the work top, erupting a large cloud into the air, “Let’s go then.”
“You’ll be cheering us on, right?” John said, looking up to Sherlock.
“Yeah, looks fun!”
"In. His. Fat. Face" John couldn't tell if Greg was doing this on purpose, but his sheer stupidity cheered him slightly.
The Professor released the boys dismissively, and left without another word. Sherlock couldn’t believe it, turning back to face the desk.
He continued to breathe into his hands.
“Oh you- you absolute, I knew it! I knew- You cock!” John yelled, pushing him off him “I knew it-”
“Does she?” Sherlock sipped his tea. “What are your plans for the day, then? Dancing with the ghosts? Summoning a demon? Running head-on into the dark forest until the darkness takes control of you? That’s what people do on Halloween, isn't it?”
When really he wished to point out he was solving an actual murder,
Mike punched him in the arm jokily. John’s face broke into what looked like a forced smile and he began clenching his left fist repeatedly on his thigh. Sherlock noted this -
John was breathing heavily.
Sherlock didn’t really know what to do with himself, he’d now bought his books from “Flourish and Blotts”, he’d topped up his potions supplies in “Slug & Jiggers Apothecary”, he’d even popped into “Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes” and rolled his eyes at a group of third years pining over the love potions, and Mycroft still hadn’t bought his ruddy umbrella. He did consider just going home via the floo network… but he knew Mrs Holmes would be less than impressed by this… So what to do?
“See you later, Sherlock,” was all she said, and she left, running to sit by Sebastian and Janine at the Slytherin table. Sherlock glared at her.
“Thank you. Thank you ever so much. I now, may, now I may, I may excuse myself…” Sherlock said, too confidently, really, and stood up with a wobble, “Enjoy.”
And he moved over, taking the boy’s very heavy case in one hand, and his set of Slytherin robes in the other.
“Er- This was your activity, I just came to lend a hand,” John protested.
Molly and Mike stared at him. Greg was too busy staring at the mess unfolding, mouth agape.
“I don’t doubt it,” Greg said, winking.
“How sweet.”
“Eh, we’ll see,” Sherlock teased, turning and heading towards the dungeons sleepily.
As the hour drew to a close, John started to get very hungry. It was nearing half past one and the memory of his sad, stolen piece of toast was waning fast, and still no reply arrived…
Sherlock breathed in relief, and Graham grabbed him by the shoulder,
– and slipped on his freshly polished shoes, which looked to anyone else identical to his uniform pair. Of course to Sherlock they were barely comparable. Pulling a small hand mirror from his drawer he looked into it, ruffled his curls three times, gave a gentle sigh at his beautifully bruised eye socket, and slid it into his back pocket. He then grabbed his wand from the nightstand, also sliding it into his back-pocket, before hopping from the bed and heading off to breakfast.
Sherlock yawned largely, starting to rise.
Sherlock stared at him. “Of course, John.”
“Say when he’d be done?”
“Right?” Greg pressed his palms into his eyes, groaning. “Goodnight, mate.”
Playing into John’s hand, the three of them turned at once, only to be met with a stunning-charm to the face: they stared at him blankly for a second, then slouched to the grass gormlessly, revealing the poor victim they’d been plaguing for who knows how long.
“How are you not in trouble?”
“A bloody lot. McGonagall's gonna go mental,” John replied, laughing.
Sherlock saw John’s face light up instantly,
“You don’t- you don’t mind do you?”
John stared at him, lifting his gaze from his own parcel of Butterbeers and a chocolate frog, “You’re joking?”
John felt Sherlock’s eyes fall heavily upon him. He felt his gaze tracing over the lines under John’s eyes, felt him clock John’s fussing with the loose threads on his jumper cuffs, saw the untouched tea in front of him, forming a slight skin.
Sherlock sighed, nodding, and stuffed his letters into his satchel.
and pocketed some.
“Just- open it.”
“Where are you going?”
October passed rather pleasantly, although Sherlock still found himself obsessing over those photographs in the back of his mind, and evidently John was still bothered by it too.
John shook off Greg’s arm.
“Good luck?”
“We know, we gave it you!”
He started pouring Sherlock some more firewhisky.
The feast was magnificent. Steaming cauldrons of pumpkin soup stood tall across the four tables, baskets of every sweet and treat you could imagine littered the tables. Halloween themed crackers were scattered here and there, offering either a trick or a treat once pulled- to John's amusement, when he pulled one with Greg he won a glistening toffee apple, but Greg in turn got a dung bomb to the face
“Potion exploded. Erupted gloriously out of my cauldron. Blew me right off the bed. You should see the state of the dormitory…”
“You can still drink it,” John said, laughing.
Sherlock beamed at him.
“How many Filibuster fireworks will be let off, do you think?”
“You going to tell me what that was?”
“We should get you to the hospital wing” John said after a bit, standing slowly with a small grunt.
"And 107 days, however, if you mean the start of the Christmas break".
“See you later?” John called from behind.
“And that’s useful how?”
John, after some difficulty pushing the snoozing Greg off of his lap, which wasn’t helped by the two people suddenly coming down the stairs on top of them, followed him.
And that was that as she sauntered away.
“What did I mean when?”
“Dinner! You need food, come on let-” John piped suddenly, starting to skip down the staircase
“Well” he started “Well it looks… You look… Erm… Well it’s a bit… Er…” John paused “It looks like it hurts”
“You sure you’re alright?”
They met 7 years ago today, on January 29th 2010! I'm not crying - you are!
The word wouldn’t leave him alone as he soaked in the water. The lavender scented water that Sherlock had run for him. It was only then that he noticed the mug on the bath’s rim, the white china with the leaves on, made to his liking. It was all very calming.
"I tell them, "no loud games after 8 o'clock" do they listen? No. No they don't." John gave her a weak smile, but as she passed him, she gave his arm a forceful, yet comforting squeeze "that sister of yours... you give her some sleeping draught, and I won't bat an eyelid. It's in the fourth cupboard on the right in the kitchen - I just don't want her making a noise of the place, d'you hear? Not when most o'you lot are off to Hogwarts tomorrow!" then she stomped off up the stairs shouting "the next person who sets off a filibuster's or throws a fanged frisbee, I'll turn ‘em into a blast-ended skrewt! D'you hear?!" John did like Mrs Turner... she'd always given the Watsons some leeway (being the oldest there) and anyway, she was tough as dragon-hyde boots.
“Where are we going?”
The Gryffindor crowd erupted, screaming at the top of their lungs and waving their flags above their heads. In all the commotion, however, John looked away for a mere moment, and Sebastian saw his opportunity. Seb flew at him and, quaffle in hand, threw it hard at John’s chest and knocked him into the metal goal post, scoring a goal in the process. John, disoriented, started to slip from his broom, and Sherlock’s heart leapt into his throat.
“Shut up Mycroft,” Mrs Holmes snapped, “John you can open that later, if you like. But he’s got to open something Sherlock! He’ll have to start mine and your father’s round.”
“'Friend'?”
Letter after letter Sherlock read through, some cases (only missing objects, which Sherlock scrawled bitter,
Sherlock sighed, wheeling back round, “Of course, yes…”
It was only early afternoon, but a bluey grey darkness had already begun to descend over Sherlock’s little village, which only made the warm welcoming light of his kitchen even more inviting. Sherlock, rather disinterestedly, perched himself upon one of the kitchen stools and dictated to John where the necessary ingredients were. However, he was forced to join in with an extravagant sigh when John couldn’t reach the Holmes’ mammoth jar of pre-made mince meat that perched itself on the top shelf of the cabinet.
“Don’t give me that, I know that smile.”
“That’s… That’s very kind of you Sher-“
John’s cheeks began to turn an astonishing shade of pink, “Oh erm, oh no we’re not erm-”
“And-And John’s here!” She continued, “There’s only so many occassions when your parents are away, Sherlock.”
“Hate to be a spoil sport, but maybe take it easy? You had a broken nose and wrist about an hour ago?” John said in between wheezes.
“Mr Watson if you could be so kind and look at me, not Mr Holmes while I am punishing you!”
Mrs Holmes gave him a gentle smile, clasping his arm “You’re the only person he’s really mentioned as of yet, love.”
Greg made some agreeable sounds into his own knees.
“Yes but, how do you do it? How do you… notice those things?” John interrupted,.
“The man was home alone according to his wife-”
“He didn’t need to.”
“Bloody hell,” John barked, “Genuine murders took place there Sherlock, of course you made me-” but John was laughing to now, “Right. Come on. You're  buying me a butterbeer for that.”
“Why?” he added after short composure, quill still quivering in his hand ready for use.
“But that’s all I have, John. A letter. And a few pesky photographs that I spent the all last night studying over, and now can’t do anymore with,” he barked, spitting the words, “not while I’m cooped up in this place.” He then went very quiet. John noticed his hands were shaking slightly, and his breaths quickening, “I know nothing about the murderer apart from the fact they seem to be able to walk through walls, and can conjure up a good Incarcerous charm. What else?”
“I just assumed you wouldn’t be at breakfast, so-” John continued, seeing the slight panic in Sherlock’s eyes.
Sherlock exhaled heavily, rubbing the back of his head, hand trembling slightly.
“Glad tidings…” came a long, questioning drawl into kitchen.
Sherlock froze. “Look, it’s fine, he just grabbed the back of it- I’m faster than him-”
Awkwardly, the two of them slipped out of the classroom, trying to ignore the sneers of some of their fellow students, and were met with a stony faced headmistress.
“Where are you off to?”
“He’s helping you, is he?”
“Hello,” Sherlock said huffily, dropping down beside Greg.
The three of them sat there a moment more, revelling in the autumnal haven that was Hogsmeade village, watching as people apple-bobbed outside of shops, performed music about phantoms and witches of old, and entertainers who produced flourishes of bats out of the ends of their wands, until it was interrupted by Steven Bainbridge running over to join them.
“Thanks Carl,” Sherlock droned.
John shifted, the object behind his back rustling. “So, I’m just going to-”
After a brief, heavy silence between the three of them, in which Greg looked a bizarre mixture of guilty and intrigued, John forced a chuckle;
Although not in the most comfortable of positions, at least Sherlock could see the subtle elegance that was the September sunset… upside down… whilst fighting desperately not to inhale blood too often.
“Mr Holmes-”
“Don’t want him what? Sorry?” John interrupted sternly, raising his eyebrows.
After a few moments pause, Sherlock continued,
“Look, sit on my table, the Gryffindor table. There isn’t an actual rule as to who can sit where you know…”
John was amused by this, however Sherlock wasn’t really joking. He had failed to mention John to Mycroft since they’d started associating with one another, however this did not mean he was a stranger to him, frankly the opposite was a lot more likely.
“I think your other bags are there,” John said, pointing to a scattered pile of bags behind Sherlock, “Do I… I think I recognise you, are- are you at-”
Switching POV
“My biscuit,” Greg said, brandishing his mug at John, “Where’s the spell to undo that then, eh?”
John stood up as if he’d been asleep for days, slinging his bag on with as much muster as a mountain troll taking a leisurely stroll. “I’ll see you back in the common room,” he yawned “Save me an armchair.”
“Exactly. So what’s the issue?”
John burst into laughter, until his moustache fell off completely, “Yep. Yep, Sherlock. Gary.”
“Sherlock-”
“We’ve got forty minutes! Then a new year for us!”
John coughed, before shooting Mr and Mrs Holmes a worried glance, who were incidentally having another crack at making mince pies only a few metres away.
The two brothers stared at one another.
John crept over; he’d never had an owl of his own, although both he and Harry had always wanted one. Obviously they’d become second nature to him living at Hogwarts for years, but it did mean he saw them more as a practicality than a pet, thus treaded with caution.
“Is there a problem, Mr Watson?” Borage said, voice brittle, giving him the aura of someone about to crumble to dust before their very eyes, “There’s a seat beside Mr Holmes I believe!”
Sherlock frowned, “He- well- I do it better,” he said rather sulkily.
John was quiet for the rest of their journey, and quieter still when he and the sea of cloaked students made their way to the thestrals and their carriages. Most people in John's year couldn’t see them, or were good at pretending they couldn't, but John could. It was a reminder he could do without when he arrived on the school premises on the evening of September the first. But, it was healed by the fact thestrals were unconventionally adorable (well, John thought so anyway). However, he hardly noticed them this year, his mind still buzzing from the incident on the train.
“No, I do.”
“Alright,” although John wasn’t so sure, “go send that letter!”
If it didn’t harm him, John knew he had no real reason to object, as much as he’d like to.
“Right,” he stuffed his wand deep into his coat, “Thanks!”
“Okay…”
“I’m going to get into my robes.” He said through clenched teeth, breathing heavier than usual, picking up his satchel and then pushing past them out to get to the corridor.
“Actually, Mr Watson- may I have a word?”
Nothing.
’ experiment, John.”
“Burnt Umber.”
Sherlock, grabbing a quill, re-wrote his reply to his mother:
“You have one hour to concoct this potion. Go.” Conversation erupted about the students, and I’m sorry to say a lot was poking fun at the curly haired boy at the front of the class. However, comforting to John and Greg at least, was that a lot of it was also “How the hell do we brew this?”
“Would have made the papers-”
The rest of the afternoon was spent doing blissfully mundane things, lots of eating of sandwiches, lots of cups of tea, and lots of lying about on the grass, soaking up the few summer-like days they had before October came.
There was a moment’s silence, but Sherlock began trotting down the staircase briskly ahead.
McGonagall looked at them and, shooting Sherlock a dark look, she dismissed them.
“Erm, he’s-” Sherlock flicked his eyes around the room of bodies. He spotted John, who was standing beside the Christmas tree, laughing.
“Oh, nothing”
. His mother simply cupped his handsome face in her hands, kissed his forehead maternally and that was that. Even that took effort, Sherlock fidgeting irritably to get away even though the moment lasted but a few seconds. His father just waved from afar. Sherlock had no reason to bother with two goodbyes.
The Slytherin team followed suit, and Sherlock felt a burning hatred for Sebastian as he stepped out onto the field.
“Well…” He scowled at them, “Maybe leave solving murders to us next time.”
Steven nodded, patting Sherlock on the back hard, and went over to a bedraggled record player that sat precariously on one of the tables, “Make yourself at home! You like
Just as the two of them began to sink their spoons into the layers of whipped cream, custard and fruit, a breathlessly excited voice piped up behind John, who was startled so violently he received a generous coating of cream upon his nose.
John stared at him.
And there he left his best friend half asleep in the quietest part of the library.
Sherlock was staring at him, his eyes searching, as if trying to work out whether John was still interested. John, thankfully, answered for him.
“But, what about the Department of Law Enforcement? Why hasn’t the wife gone to them? Why you?”
“I don’t, but he's... here, and it’s Christmas” Sherlock stammered, “He’s spending Christmas with us- with me- I can’t just-”
He left.
“You’ve gotta stop that, mate. I only write to Molly, so she doesn’t feel second best!”
Sherlock merely nodded and, after pulling his torn jumper off over his head, followed John down the many stairs, and out into the grounds.
To everyone’s surprise, a short, slim girl with fiery ginger hair, who Sherlock vaguely recognised as John’s sister, popped up behind him, grabbing his sad, untouched piece of toast.
John scoffed, “Erm, when?”
“Maybe this is the time for my first Halloween prank-”
“And just piss off alright! Bloody ridiculous!”
There was a long silence, filled only by the muffled sound of the music downstairs.
When John’s eyes fell upon the boy in the chair, his already majorly pissed demeanour began to boil.
“Thought you were caught up in the case?” John teased.
Sherlock swallowed, his arm tightening around John, “I… There are somethings I can… gather.”
Sherlock sat in the back compartment on the right hand side every time he rode the train, and had sat alone ever since Mycroft finished his seventh year. He preferred this (Mycroft was unfathomably irritating). It rarely bothered him that other students would come to the back in search of a seat, spot him, and scuttle away again. He was so used to it now, it had become almost tradition, a lovely way to be reminded of his lack of companionship at the start of a new term. Though of course, he really didn't mind. Honest.
John shook his head, grinning,
“I won’t tell, Mr Holmes,” she said, winking.
Sherlock smiled, “You go to dinner.”
“She talked to me, properly! I can’t belie- John? You alright?”
Wary to not push his search any further whilst staying so close to the castle after hours, Sherlock whispered “Nox” before pocketing his wand and all three pouches. Fighting to remain light on his feet in his excitement, slunk back into the entrance hall, praying the large oak doors wouldn’t creak under his movement, and rushed back to his common room.
Sherlock said nothing.
“Wh- Why? Dinner?!” The Hogwarts dinners were never something to miss after all!
“Oh really, John - that really is intellectually informed”
John did indeed look. He looked at the marbled bruising around his nostrils, the many grazes and cuts on his nose’s bridge, the slight swelling across… well the whole of it… not to mention the blackening of his left eye…
“You alright?”
“No sorry, I don’t.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right,” he said, jumping up suddenly, wiping his nose on his sleeve, “I’m off!” and starting heading onward to the castle once again.
“Apparently not. He grows them by magic though. That’s why they’re so-” Sherlock gestured to the pumpkin in front of him which was easily the size of a year or two old dragon “but apparently when carving they need ‘
John huffed, dropping down next to him.
“Yeah…” John took a deep breath in preparation, “Ready?”
Sherlock froze, “So do I…”
Sherlock had been practically living in the library since the bonfire incident, which John thought would be a perfect setting in which he could revise, if Sherlock wasn’t going to. He was wrong.
“Because…you, it’s just… amazing. Bizarre. But- a real murder? Really?”
. John’s went blue. Greg’s went Lilac. John nervously skimmed over the remaining method;
“Who’s us, though?” John asked finally. Sherlock frowned, “No I mean- you’re the only person to notice this, Sherlock, to know how the flames moved, to have found these things… So if they want attention it seems that they want it from-”
“Okay,” John beamed.
“Nice” John nodded.
Sherlock scowled at him.
It was Seb and Anderson, and before Sherlock could apologise again for flattening this stranger, he grabbed his shopping and legged it once again in the direction of the Leaky Cauldron, leaving John and Greg laughing, confused in the street.
“Molly, what’re your plans for the rest of the day?” Greg said, overly loud.
“Shh, John,” He whispered.
“Are you-”
After another few minutes dull conversation, in which Sherlock gave up on his book and started gazing numbly out of the window, Mike and John exchanged mischievous looks. John gave Mike the nod, and up he jumped!
“How lovely. Well, Merry Christmas!” she said brightly, handing him his bag.
“Since when did you start caring about Christmas?”
“So, how much has he had?” John asked, slurring only slightly, nodding to a student ahead of them.
John finished the last of his tea in reply, before slamming the mug onto the table,
"Cheers" John said, carefully folding the tie and putting it in his coat pocket. "I'm John by the way, John Watson."
“How can you tell?” John asked, laughing.
John couldn’t shake Mycroft’s smugness from his brain as he waited in Sherlock’s bedroom for him to finish freshening up, nor could he when he padded across the landing to the bathroom, to find the bath re-filled with a lovely purple steam rising from it that Sherlock had left for him, before evidently heading straight downstairs judging by the damp footprints that littered the carpet and the top few steps.
“Or is it more than that?” he slid of the banister to approach him.
Sherlock took hold of John’s carving hand, without really noticing, and began steering it across the pumpkin’s surface.
“Yep.”
She beamed at him, “Very much so.”
“Really, John,” Was all he replied, sitting beside him and taking the mug between his fingers.
John paused before pulling out the envelope that had been in his pocket since he’d gotten dressed.
“You want one?”
As he wound his way around the corridors, smiling politely to the ghost of Sir Nicholas as they passed on the stairs, he allowed his mind to wander back to the holidays. They’d gone so fast, and of course everyone thought that, but it was normally the opposite. They went too slowly for him, he hated it at Madame Turner’s, so usually it was such a drag, but not this year, and he didn’t know if that was worse. It was as if there’d been no break, no rest in the workload, it was constant steam of homework from all his lessons more or less. He was normally full of excitement the first day back, but now he was just so sick of-
but yet he remained. Sherlock, reluctantly, entered the corridor. Probably wants to know what he missed so far this term. Not much. He then headed off to the great hall, to wait for John, putting the boy out of his mind.
Mike and Greg hummed in response.
“Was it that bloody Sebastian again? I swear one day I will hit him-”
“You carve it.”
“Yeah… yeah it does, yeah… Sorry-”
Sherlock looked up to the mantle. It was in fact twenty-six-past-one in the morning.
But surely John could find one that wasn’t garish or itchy, something that would simply keep him warm without him wanting to burn it or cover it in flesh-eating-slug repellent.
“I may go and make us a coffee instead.”
John even acted as a buffer between himself and his family; when Sherlock was cursing at his petri-dish as if it had personally insulted him and all held dear, and his mother chose that moment to bring up two large plates of bubble and squeak, John ensured that she left without quill or pillow or shoe being flung at her head.
“Madame Turner,” John said idly, looking at a letter that fell only centimeters from his bowl.
“I dunno, I’ll finish this one? Then maybe do that one together?” John happily finished off his loaf, dusting the crumbs from his hands “then go get warm?”
Sherlock pulled a face.
“Guys!” he barked excitedly to John and Greg “some people have arranged a Halloween party in our common room tomorrow night. People are off buying supplies right now, come help?”
“Right-”
John beamed, “Great, well, thanks for a more eventful evening than I expected.”
Then they pulled their crackers, Sherlock won against his mother, his mother against Mycroft, Mycroft against his father, Sherlock and Mycroft weren’t allowed to pull one due to their rivalry,  which John could quite understand… and John won against Mycroft, giving him a very petty but very real sense of satisfaction. This eventually resulted in Sherlock wearing an elaborate pirates hat and John a very suave bowler hat, and a few festive mice to scurry across the table.
John poured himself a cup, and instinctively found himself pouring Sherlock one too, who luckily was just coming into the hall. John beamed.
“They’re… they’re cases, John” Sherlock sighed, gathering the letters together into some form of order.
“I think the professor gave up, removed the seat altogether,” John smirked.
“So rain saved us?”
“Billie you’ve brought me a good one here – I could tell by the intensely scrawled handwriting and messy ink blots that this was a-”
Greg, after a few moment of thought, nodded. “Thanks, Sherlock!” he slapped him on the back, “Maybe it’s time we had a beer!”  and as Greg started rummaging through his bag to reveal a hefty amount of butterbeers, Sherlock mouthed John a thousand thank yous.
Sherlock clambered out of the kitchen and pushed passed a few bodies on the bottom of the stairs, and scaled his staircase.
“You’re the guest…” Sherlock murmured, sulkily, picking his wand up and twiddling it between his fingers.
“You go, we’ll meet you in The Three Broomsticks in an hour, yeah?” John said brightly.
“Is it? If you’re going to lie, you’ve got to commit, surely. Slytherin did it last year, carried their brooms around in protective cases, remember? Yeah they were just their normal brooms, but a bit polished up. And they won, so,” He retorted, before taking a large sip of coffee,
Sherlock looked at him. John could tell his eyes were now watery.
“What?” John said, selecting a slightly oval spoon with ridged edges.
“I-I- must… Erm… I am so sorry I, erm...”
“No, I suppose I didn’t.”
Sherlock smiled, “Right, I’ll keep that in mind”
John hummed in agreement.
“Good morning,” Sherlock whispered, smirking.
“You know, if you don’t want to sit at the Slytherin table with Seb and things… you’re welcome to sit with me, and Greg, for breakfast?”
He eventually heard the grunts and yawns of the others, the pulling on of jeans and jumpers, the benign morning chatter that merely consisted of complaints of how tired they were, and soon-enough the sound of multiple people trudging down the stone staircase. This was his cue to put on his socks, yellow today -
It was when he reached the top of the second staircase of the fourth floor that he was interrupted. A boy of with dark brown hair slicked cleanly across his head, whom John did not particularly recognise, was balanced on the banister, twiddling his wand between his fingers, remarkably similar to how Sherlock did sometimes.
“What did you say?”
“… Waited there as it killed him.” John said quietly.
“I know but-” John nodded in the direction of the two sopping Slytherins.
“Is it?” Sherlock scoffed.
“No, no that’s fine. Good,” Sherlock was blinking furiously “Yes.”
“Experiment.” He said shortly
He sighed, allowing his hands to cover his face wearily.
John sighed, hurling his bags onto his shoulders, “Well we’ll just have to look for them then” he replied matter-of-factly, with a slight smile. “Can’t have gone far”
Very uncoordinatedly, Sherlock fell into the dormitory, dropping Jim’s case at least twice, before lying it upon the freshly made up bed three away from his. Thankfully, Anderson only seemed to stir slightly, and everyone else continued snoring away.
Sherlock did try and circulate, though; that is what a good host does. However, John had told him in private to be on his best behaviour, so Sherlock tried to keep the deducing of guests to a minimum. Although he did find it rather difficult to not tell a friend of Bainbridge that the new jumper he was wearing, evidently knitted by his grandmother, had in fact initially had gone to, and even been worn by, said Grandmother’s lover, and had been re-gifted at the last minute.
“You still owe me five Galleons though,” Sherlock said, quietly smirking at him.
John snorted. “Shut up- Sh- Carl’s coming-”
John and Sherlock were left giggling, both slightly awe struck by that whole endeavour, half way down the hill.
“False alarm. It’s Mycroft’s.”
“We have a very difficult relationship,” Sherlock said flatly.
He was staring at Anderson, chatting away to a boy John didn’t recognise.
“I’m glad.”
Sherlock scowled. “Not after an hour and a half of it it’s not.”
“Oi, if you’re not gonna help then bugger off.” John said, watching the pot come to boil.
Sherlock just made the ground-breaking decision to go back to the robe shop and punch Mycroft right in his hoity face when a cold, pompous voice came from behind him. Sherlock’s throat went dry.
“You’re great,” John beamed
“Yeah…” Sherlock nodded awkwardly.
“Hi, Sherlock!” it was Carl, hair damp from a swim, “Happy Halloween!”
“But I haven’t-”
John leapt up, leapt about three feet away. His face went scarlet.
John pulled back, awkwardly, smiling to himself.
Eventually, at 21:45, he saw a skinny, stumbling figure of a girl tiptoeing up the path. John rubbed his eyes tiredly, unbelievably relieved to see her, but exceedingly fuming. He opened the door of their bedroom, and crept carefully passed the half dozen closed doors filled with wizarding children tucked up in bed. However, he heard a loud bang from within one of them, followed by a great deal of shushing and giggling.
Carl nodded, a bit glumly, “Okay.”
“Right…” was all he could fathom to say.
“Oh just passing the time – we’re a tad early yet.”
He held them up to his own hands.
“Right.”
Carl smiled at him thankfully, before scooping up his belongings and heading in the direction of the much warmer castle.
, he sprinted off to the dungeons before most of the other students had even finished their second piece of toast.
John walked him to the portrait hole, which Sherlock assumed was half due to politeness, half due to ensuring he didn’t hurt himself.
“No.”
John was sat opposite him, sipping happily on the butterbeer Sherlock had provided, which had given him a creamy foam moustache he hadn’t seemed to notice. Sherlock started to giggle at him, and John’s cheeks reddened.
“Yes.”
And they were festive festivities. After barely an hour, people filled the downstairs of Sherlock’s house completely, music was loud, and songs were being changed every few minutes, people finding old records Sherlock didn’t even know his house had hold of. Trays of giggle-water were being passed around left, right and centre, and there was a small stack of empty bottles building by the back-door of the kitchen. Sherlock had an inkling the night was going to get rather messy...
As they all sat there playfully, and Mike popped over to talk, as well as Molly, and even Harry- who gave a cheery wave across the pub to Sherlock- the mood was light-hearted and easy and relaxed, lit pumpkins floating above their heads and the fire crackling soothingly. It all caused Sherlock to think.
Sherlock smiled to himself.
“Can’t,” Sherlock said flatly, staring down at the spoon stirring freely in his teacup, “Busy.”
Sherlock looked at John. John didn’t look back.
“Yep,” Sherlock said, unimpressed, “He does love to show off. Probably stole it from someone else’s desk.”
Sebastian was almost sobbing with amusement, falling over his desk in attempt to stifle it. John felt a wave of fury wash over him, and he didn’t know why?
“Well, if you see him-”
“Sit down,” Mycroft said, gesturing to the armchair next to him.
“How is she?” John blurted, the memory of her hiccup the night before coming into view.
As John went off to carve, Sherlock made his way to the Owlery to pick up his post, having missed it at breakfast, and then to the library to file through it all, and hopefully find anything of moderate interest.
A large amount of cursing followed, through gritted teeth and clenched jaw, as Greg reeled of an unsurprisingly extensive list of all the things Sebastian had done to deserve being transfigured into a Blast-Ended Skrewt for all eternity, which was quite alarming at first, but overall a very popular topic of conversation for all three of them.
The two of them hid in Sherlock’s bedroom until dinner,
I don’t think John had ever leapt on a mountain of mashed potato faster in all his days. He shovelled it ruthlessly onto his gleaming gold plate until it was no longer visible. Greg on the other hand lunged for the chicken legs, simply pulling the large platter towards him and eating each in three bites or less. The more food was consumed, the easier the conversation began to flow, and John’s upset from the train was pushed far into the back of his mind and buried under a hefty pile of pumpkin pasties and thoughts of trifle.
They sat there for a few moments while Sherlock tried to catch his breath, on John’s orders, and failed repeatedly due to muttering “this is ridiculous” everytime he exhaled.
“He’ll probably say yes,” she said warmly.
“Hm, suit yourself,” John said, tapping his wand on the stove to ignite it, “It’s basically potion making… you’re an expert at that.”
“I wouldn’t mind at all,” she said after a moment, beaming, “I was hoping he’d go somewhere, bless him, I’m off to Clara’s…” she bit her tongue eagerly, “Him going to yours is perfect.”
Having been at Hogwarts almost seven years now, he knew that it would be merely some troublesome third years or something, or first years in a muddle. He’d have thought this then too, if it wasn’t for a sudden wail, echoing across the near-empty grounds.
Sherlock gave a little nod, and stammered a barely audible “Thank you” before continuing to sort out Billie for the week. John perched himself on one of the lesser dropping-stained arches, where he began to think…
John appreciated it.
The boy who wasn’t Gus’ giggle was particularly astounding, and the response of Mike, John, and the others surrounding them lead him to changing to beer again. However, Molly Hooper, had seemed to find the giggling rather endearing, as she’d been blushing each time the boy who wasn’t Gus had done so. Sherlock was pretty sure if the boy,
“Er, sure!” Molly said, “But… how?”
“She’ll reply John.”
“Wait, Sherlock-”
The rest of the lesson continued in silence, only the sweet tinkling of quill tips in ink pots, and the monotonous etching of the nib on the parchment, and of course the rasping croak that slipped from Borage’s lips. Sherlock didn’t tap again, but he of course didn’t write anything either.
“I’ll wait outside then, shall I?” Sherlock left, bitterly.
“What’ve you two been doing then?” Greg said, kindly.
“Madam Pomfrey notified me about them- potions accident I here?” She replied earnestly, peering over her spectacles.
. He slid open his curtains and felt around under his bed for his trunk. His heart was pounding… He wasn’t afraid of the boys, he really wasn’t… but he just didn’t want them to catch him up in the middle of the night…
John merely nodded. He felt very exposed again.
But as he was about to climb the stairs up to the sixth year dormitory, someone spoke to him.
And she didn’t, but continued reeling of dates and, judging by Sherlock’s groans, mispronouncing alchemist’s names.
“What” Sherlock sighed, now flustered, lowering his spoon again, and thus sloshing another large dribble of broth onto the surface and, to add insult to injury, pristine white shirt from Madam Pomfrey. This obviously amused John further, as he gave such a loud squeak this time even he seemed to be alarmed by it.
Before long, Geoff cracked out the Bertie Bott’s every flavour beans, and the four of them sat taking it in turns, however Sherlock completely abstained.
Sherlock was always one of the first to hop on board the Hogwarts Express. Well, to say hop is a bit ambitious, his bags weren't the lightest, nor he the strongest... but the boarding was done quickly nonetheless. It didn't take a genius to deduce why: Sherlock didn't waste time blubbering or giving heartfelt goodbyes to his parents like all the other sickening people on the platform, who made it impossible to move an inch without colliding with an owl, a trunk or a sobbing child...
“Sherlock’s brother. He’s a wanker,” John said frankly.
John smiled back, “You bet.”
“Are you any good?” John teased.
“Lestrade. Move”
John fort very hard not to laugh.
John was now buried into the sofa cushions.
“Shut up!” John chuckled, elbowing him.
John merely stared at him.
“So it was planned?”
But where, John never found out, as her eyes seemed to fall on Sherlock beside him,
The professor, who had never been one for confrontation even when a group of students put a curse on her chair to see what would happen, (crying was the answer), didn’t quite know how to respond to this.
“Tutor me,” Mike burst out suddenly, grabbing Sherlock’s arm, “In my class none of us know anything. At all. Magnussen just sits at the front and laughs – he kept me behind three hours the other day because my potion solidified and crawled off – I swear I was following the recipe –”
“Definitely not.”
“She’s not your girlfriend is she?”
“When’s your next lesson?” John asked, trying to keep the conversation on anything but Sebastian-bollocking-Wilkes and his smarmy sidekick.
He heard Sherlock huff sulkily behind him, however this was quickly undermined by Sherlock’s sudden call of “Could you bring me up a cup of tea?”
“Well, not really… but-” Hagrid popped back into the hut, returning moments later with a large tray of very misshapen, but utterly delicious looking buns.
They then did the “boring” things like buying writing equipment, which Sherlock didn’t understand why John wasn’t more excited about. Then, as promised, Sherlock was able to buy a new navy silk scarf from Galdrag’s, this time Graham getting completely bored and whining in the doorway of the shop, then finally, once phials and all other essentials were bought, it was to Honeydukes.
“You won’t. I’ll be bored into an early death.”
Sherlock stopped dead, “Not Zonko’s.”
Greg sniggered smugly, “And I’m quite interested in your train of thought there.”
“You’re a bit drunk, Sherlock, I think?” John teased, “Are you going to be able to get back? Without being spotted? In the dark? Like this?” he said, nudging him.
“No I’m not,” John replied in a hurry. Sherlock raised his eyebrows “I wasn’t.”
“No,” John said flatly, rising to go.
“Ah” Sherlock muttered, but made no effort whatsoever to make note of this.
“It doesn’t suit you…” Sherlock said, taking the cup, “The moustache.”
Sherlock’s expression dropped immediately, dropping his hand from John’s face, and stepping ever so unsubtly about a metre away from him.
Twenty minutes of their hour had passed, and John was trying his best to follow the instructions. The future, however, looked dim from the start -
“That’s really cool, Sherlock” John said after a moment, kindly, softly.
“Come on, no one’s looking!”
“You’re going to the dungeons” John said flatly, leaning slightly defeated upon the banister.
Sherlock even seemed to be enjoying himself, John thought. He’d not eaten anything at lunch, but he’d drank a lot of tea, and chimed into the conversation when necessary, which was nice.
and it was all too near for John to ignore. Allowing his bag to slide from his shoulder to the earth, John started back down the hill, but not by the path, to where the yells originated, hand clasped around his wand so tight it's pattern left traces on his palm.
“Yep. Been talking about you all night. I left her, in the end. She’s probs looking for you.” Mike said, rather glumly, “Ooh, only forty minutes to go!” he nodded to the small ornate clock hanging above the Holmes’ door to the kitchen.
Sherlock scoffed, attention turning back to the violin resting in his lap.
“I have, they aren’t there.”
“Your friend,” He raised his eyebrows at him, “You were his healer, weren’t you?”
Sherlock went scarlet.
“Did he interrogate you?” Sherlock smirked,
“What?” Greg coughed, straightening his face quickly as best he could, John burying himself in his cauldron as Magnussen leered in at them.
“Where did I go?” Sherlock continued. Greg stared at his near-empty plate of food.
He stared at John.
"115 days" Sherlock slipped in.
Sherlock was sat on the damp steps of the Owlery: the rain had ceased now, yet mud and puddles were scattered everywhere.
John snorted, “So what’s this case that’s got you threading ribbons through it?”
“But he did, mummy,” Sherlock butted in, “Haven’t you heard? Mycroft’s the muggle Father Christmas.”
Sherlock nodded proudly, “Yep.”
“I would like you to write to me.”
And John felt the smallest feeling of warmth wash over him.
They couldn’t stay like this.
“We made a guest list.”
John walked, well... stumbled… up the winding staircase, eventually finding his way to Sherlock’s room. After a few attempts at turning the handle, he found Sherlock sat cross-legged on his carpet, staring into the bottom drawer of his chest of drawers.
He finally gave in, and climbed in between his sheets about half past two. Greg stirred and said a gruff,
The crowds fell silent, waiting, and Sherlock found himself holding his breath.
After a few troublesome moments, in which John was clung to the goal post for dear life and, annoyingly, Slytherin scored four more times, John was back up.
“You thought his name was George?” John scoffed, which Sherlock merely ignored, and barely reacted to,
“You won’t bake.”
Professor Sholto was standing before her holding four dripping wet boys by the collar, a Mr Lestrade and a Mr Watson in one hand, and a Mr Hope and a Mr Wilkes in the other, all with pure fury plastered across their faces, along with a hefty smearing of mud.
“Come on John, you’re the bloody one who wanted to get fresh air, or whatever?” Gareth called from the hall’s entrance.
“Carl’s gloves.”
“Yep.”
John looked up in confusion. Sherlock shrugged at him. Sherlock was always being pulled
“You know me, mate,” He yawned, stretching, “I’ll be friends with anyone.”
“By ‘we’ you mean me.”
“Meaning it was never intended to be used-”
“Oi-Ah-Sorry! I was asleep, I'll have you know.”
It was John, a bit sweaty, his nose pink from the cold, hair slightly dishevelled from the wind. Sherlock, bizarrely, felt suddenly very exposed.
“Seriously Sherlock, if you ever need a hand-” Carl said, cheerily, as Sherlock rose to go.
, “Seriously-”
Greg lunged at him with his sundae spoon.
“You excited?” John said excitedly, through dithering slightly at the morning cold.
“Right! Everyone!” Steven yelled, opening a large chest that sat behind one of the squashy red sofas, “Costume lucky dip! Come on!”
He watched as Janine’s bouncing brown curls bobbed out of the Hall and towards the staircase where Sebastian, the
“Nothing, just – he’s a big fan of you.”
“Once,”
“My family, hm. They’re always desperate for visitors. Want a house full of people-”
“The left one is thunder grey and the right one is slighter lighter - drizzle,” Sherlock added quickly, in attempt to diffuse the tension between Mycroft and his mother. “The trouble is that Mycroft has both a thunder and drizzle coloured set of robes, and he is trying to envision himself prancing into the Ministry, and is unsure what shade will impress them. Brother mine, we have been here for 17 minutes – If you work for the Ministry, they will not care what robes you’re wearing…”
“Where’d you want to go in Hogsmeade, then?” John asked excitedly, walking briskly a few steps behind Sherlock as the two of them left Alchemy.
“How was your lesson?”
“Look at them – letting them drag along the floor behind them like that, no way they’re new. It’s to intimidate you.”
“I’ve got nothing better to do” John said slowly, stepping down to meet him.
“So,” John said, rubbing his eyes lazily and swivelling his still pyjama-clad legs out from under the duvet, “The person who stole Carl’s gloves was... behind the bonfire?”
“I- I…” he cleared his throat, “I like him? He’s nice, he’s-”
A cloak-less, dishevelled figure lifted himself slowly, his curls of dark hair askew, and looked at John for a few seconds. For a moment, John didn’t recognise him due to the concoction of blood, bruising and mud on his face…
“Yeah, didn’t think you’d be up for that again,” John laughed, “It’s for the common room, for later.”
“Don’t mind him,” She said, taking one for herself and passing one to Sherlock’s father who came and sat beside her, “He does like to be a grump.”
“Yep. Very busy and important,” he said cooly, not turning to look at them, “Goodbye.”
Not only was it the boy who wasn’t Gus, but it was the boy who wasn’t Gus with a lampshade on his head. Sherlock’s Mother’s lampshade.
at this point, lead Sherlock to give in quite quickly,
“Sherlock!” he called, heading to the corridor quickly, pushing past Mike and the pretty blonde he’d been sitting by, “Sher-”
“Yes. Sadly my brother sees it more befitting to carry around a tobacco case in his pocket.”
"Who?”
“Erm… do I… I mean it’s great but-”
“Do make sure he eats something, I know he’ll try not to.” John nodded, turning to go “Anyway, well done for bringing him here, I didn’t know you two were together? I bet you’ll calm him down a bit, the dear.”
Sherlock looked up at him, his curls flopping forward into his face.
“Oh nothing, just-” but Greg never learned what
“Sherlock, love, don’t lean on the wall - the threads will begin to pull! Why are you wearing it anyway?” She pecked, pulling him forward and beginning to busily brush him down with a large peacock quill she’d produced from her jade cloak, slung over her arm. “I took mine off long ago, like every other sensible person...”
“Do you know any Christmas carols?”
“Thanks! The first match this year is against Slytherin I think, so I guess you won’t be cheering me on there,” John said with a smile, turning slightly pink.
“So,” John said, shoving his hands into his cloak for warmth, yet instead finding two soggy pouches of rainwater, “I’ll, er. See you in the morning?”
They were sat by the lake, somewhere which had become a regular spot for them to go together, both wrapped in thick scarves and pretending they weren’t dithering quietly in the cold. They were completely alone apart from Carl, as usual, who was swimming out in the centre of the water.
“Don’t mention it. Anytime.” John said softly.
John slid in beside him, mouthing apologies at the Professor before rummaging about for scraps of parchment and a quill.
so might as well make the most of the Saturday.
“This is Sherlock, Harry,” John said with a long sigh.
“Why haven’t you been playing it? I’ve never seen you with it,” John frowned, “ and 'her'... ?”
“You know it?”
“Not gonna ask about the bruises on his face?” John said, bitterly.
“It was a nasty nose bleed,” the boy said after him.
“How can I help you arrange these socks then?” John murmerd, trying not to focus on the fact that he wasn’t even pretending to look at the socks at all.
"Evening."
Sherlock quickly began to think of something, anything to say to fix this, just as the compartment door slid back open.
In keeping with the festivities of the evening, all the food of the feast seemed to have been smoked, in one way or another. All of it. This was fine for Greg with his bacon and Sherlock, who was picking at a corner of his salmon, but John wasn’t completely sold on his smoked mushrooms and veg. Alas, the dessert made all the difference, thankfully not smoked, or not to the point where John could taste it; a spiced ginger cake with custard, which John saw Sherlock even take a slither of.
“Yes hello you – you lunatic… Let go will you?”
Sherlock awoke bright and early the following morning, a few streams of light leaking in from the thin gaps in his curtains, and the distinct snores of each of his dorm-mates could still be heard. His left eye felt very numb, and slightly puffy, yet surprisingly the rest of him felt fine… well, fine or thereabouts. He yawned, then poked his feet tentatively out of the curtains of his four-poster so as to ensure not to place them in dragon dung- a prank Anderson had been prone to do ever so kindly on weekend mornings. Finding the floor clear, he quickly crept to his chest of drawers, which were perfectly stocked and organised with precision. Pulling a pair of black jeans, a white shirt, and an ash coloured jumper delicately from them, he snuck off to the bathrooms to change. To the untrained eye, it often appeared that Sherlock was in his uniform anyway when he wore his own clothes, but he knew he wasn’t, so that’s all that mattered.
“I wouldn't bother, John,” Mycroft said irritably.
Sherlock glanced up in surprise, shaking his curls from his eyes. He beamed warmly, a
“Will…” John began, nervously, “Will we get detention for this…”
“Ten” he replied coolly, but with obvious surprise the other was talking to him.
John couldn’t stop himself from chuckling once again, “Amazing.”
Locating them quickly, he clambered carefully back behind his curtains, undressed awkwardly as to not fall off the bunk, and folded his uniform as best he could in the silvery gloom. Sighing quietly, running his hand threw his dishevelled curls, he sat crossed legged on his bed. When he put his hand down on the duvet, he felt something.
“Er- no, no I don’t eat on cases, remember?” he adjusted the lens, “Slows me down.”
“Well. Don’t be so sure. The majority of our team are idiots.”
“Hmm, well done Sherl. So this means you get to study with the hunky older ones then…” Sherlock shot her a piercing look.
John made an agreeable sort of sound.
“You’ll send us into the dark forest for an hour, leave us wander about a bit, deduct a few house points, and not question the fact we managed to obtain pictures of a corpse?”
However, all this sudden burst of light and wonderment that bled through the castle so hatefully, Sherlock had to admit he wasn’t entirely glad that John seemed to be absent of such silliness. John had come down to breakfast on the first few December mornings with that increasingly familiar, worrying look upon his face Sherlock had noticed that day on the train months before. Eyes sunken, frown fixed, gaze distant… Sherlock had an inkling why. Harry had the same demeanour.
It was the 31st of August and the sun was only just visible over the houses and shops John could see from his window. He waited, watching the street closely, his heart in his throat.
“Be quiet Sherlock!” Mycroft spat, “What a genius joke.”
“Yeah?”
“Sherlock!”
Thankfully his mother got the hint and, through John’s gentle pandering, ensured that their dinner was soup, and eaten in their room.
“What on earth is that supposed to mean?” Sherlock spat.
“Kitchen. Blonde lady, Mike’s blonde lady, she wanted a drink. I got her one, and then suddenly I was sitting at the table, cards everywhere. Game,” He smiled, “I drank her drink.”
“Well,” Sherlock mumbled, “No. Of course not…” he shot John a worried luck.
In his enthusiasm and swiftness to settle into his mind palace to think over his findings, he failed to notice that there was one less person snoring in his dormitory when he returned.
He lay there for a good five minutes or so, just listening to the muffled babble of the common room below, and the subtle patter of rain on the nearby window. Suddenly, he heard a jumble of footsteps come bounding up the solid stairway.
“Yes. Father wins.”
“Are you able to stand without me?”
John didn’t see Sherlock for the entirety of the following week. He wasn’t in lessons, wasn’t at breakfast, or dinner, he didn’t even see him across the corridor or about the grounds… He’d be worried, if he wasn’t being such a dick. It wasn’t John’s fault they case had been fake, but there was a slight twinge of sadness in him, he’d enjoyed their few days case solving, after all.
“Exactly, the castle to myself.”
“They’ll be too busy looking at that nose instead” and with that, he smiled his sweetest smile and bolted for the street leaving Mycroft with a face like a cats bottom, and his parents trying their very best to conceal their amusement.
With November came drizzle, and a minor but very persistent headache in John’s case- neither of which were well received as he trudged through a significantly colder castle at ten minutes to nine in the morning. Breakfast, naturally, had been skipped due to John and Greg’s not-so-surprising lie in, and that by no means improved John’s mood.
“And- hey!- And, I’m currently in the process of examining the gloves themselves more closely-”
“Hello,” Sherlock said coolly, as John sat down beside Greg.
(See the end of the chapter for
The phrase cut through Sherlock like a spell backfiring.
“How’d that happen?” John laughed.
And soon, the turkey was being carved. Mrs Holmes did a cracking job at it, while Mr Holmes dished out wine amongst them all. It all looked and smelt delicious, perfectly roasted potatoes, thick hearty gravy, and John was touched as Mrs Holmes brought out his own individual nut roast which she’d prepared for him, stating how she’d “searched through copy after copy of Witch’s Weekly to find the recipe!”.
“Ah what a subtle way to get rid of me,” Harry said teasingly “She does actually! Isn’t it brilliant when you can get a girlfriend and your brother can’t?” She planted a forceful kiss onto his cheek, before jumping up “See ya guys- see ya Sherlock!”
Sherlock paused, a slight frown quivering upon his lips,
“I just needed time to… to process, okay?” his voice was very quiet, “The case, John…”
“And was in Belgium, not France.”
Sherlock smiled.
“Good day, boys,” He nodded to McGonagall and headed for the door, “And leave the bloody DLE to do its job.”
John swallowed, rather embarrassed.
Harry raised her eyebrows, mouth growing into a smile.
“You okay?”
The decline in morning temperature made the hellish experience that was indeed potions even more uncomfortable. Yet, of course, not as uncomfortable as the lesson’s seating arrangements after the ‘discussion’ John had had with his sixth year classmate only on the first day of lessons. Sherlock stuck to his word, he didn’t comment on anything John did, said or breathed since their talk outside Borage’s classroom. This did mean John didn’t have to worry about having his private matters spewed from a stranger’s mouth, but it also meant in some lessons he spoke to no one at all… but it was better this way. The ‘staying out of each other’s private matters’ arrangement was a mild success, and that was the truth, until September 17
As soon as the words left his mouth, he regretted them - his mother pounced on him, worriedly checking his face and hands for cuts or scrapes. While doing this she spotted something.
He brushed his fingers about the bushes.
“Shut up.”
Sherlock looked up, “John. If you prompt any of them into singing I will have to remove you.”
“Didn’t know you could cook, is all.”
When the lesson came to a close, which felt approximately a lifetime after it began, Sherlock noticed that this boy remained sitting, staring at the blackboard, before approaching the professor’s desk.
They reached the portrait hole, and the turbulent sounds of festivities could be heard from within. The fat lady stared at them, suspiciously.
friend Greg.”
Greg bid him a grumpy farewell as he grumbled his way down the corridor to Charms, and John picked up the pace so as not to be late to Alchemy.
She jumped, but thankfully, seeing who it was, her face softened.
He idly went back to his letters, though felt an uneasiness settle about him.
“You- you wouldn’t- you really wouldn’t try here would you? Metres away from the headmistress’ office?” he gabbled, trying to control the definite tremble in his voice “Or is- is going into the Forbidden Forest at midnight how you too get your kicks?”
“C-come on then, love.” She said finally, picking up Sherlock’s shopping “Show me this hat, then!”
“You could sit with Greg?”
“Do you know each other?” Sherlock said, rather levelly.
“Yeah, Sherlock seems to like all of them,” John murmured, staring at the quill quivering eagerly on the notepad between them, “I suppose we should add Clara, she’s my sister’s-” he paused, before clearing his throat, “her erm, her- her girl...friend.”
“See you tomorrow…?” Sherlock said, slowly,
“Help me up,” Sherlock murmured from his position on the floor.
Sherlock shook his head.
“Busy?” he asked bitterly, “You’ve not been in any lessons, how have you been busy?”
Yet the classes were small, meaning the lessons were quite relaxed and full of discussion, so John wasn’t letting himself get too nervous about it. Besides, he’d enjoyed it last year, and Mike was there too.
“Well, can I help?”
Sherlock ran, stumbling clumsily over his robes in terror. They’d found him, he’d lost their sickening version of hide and seek, and here was his prize. Philip, Andrew and Sebastian’s cruel laughter resonated in the silence, nagging at him like the brisk evening breeze, as his legs slipped and stammered up the grassy bank, the glowing lights of the castle too far away to be any comfort to him now. His heart was pounding harshly in his throat, his energy waning.
“A lot?”
“Well. Well of course bu-”
“What do we do if McGonagall arrives?” John whispered excitingly.
“It’s Britain. And for the record, it’s Mycroft.”
“Mate!” Graham enveloped John in a huge squeeze, and then Stephen.
“Erm. How was your…”
“J-J-ha! John y’alright mate?”
Sherlock sidled away between two evidently inebriated dancing people, “Yes.”
“Really, John?” Sherlock barked, not looking at him, "Fine. Go enjoy your lesson.”
It seemed Sherlock pouring him a glass of water was his way of apologising for ignoring him over the past week.
“Positive! I was being so careful-”
“Give me the letter, Mr Holmes.”
“No no, wouldn’t want to distract you” Sherlock interjected, coolly, pulling a glass phial from his robes and filling it with the glistening honey coloured liquid “I’ll just hand this in, shall I?” and with that, Sherlock swept off to the front of the dungeon, smiled sweetly at Magnussen, who looked fit to burst that no other student had finished before the “know-it-all”. John gaped at him as he strode back up the dungeon towards him, stuffed his textbook and various other bits and bobs into his bag and without another word banged through the dungeon door, his cloak flowing behind him as he went.
“Had some fun?”
“Yes, John.”
John nodded to the stone seat beside him, and Sherlock obliged. Sherlock smelled very heavily of tobacco.
Sherlock shut the door gently behind him, leaving he and John alone by the front door, the glowing baubles that covered the picture-rails and banisters the only source of light for them.
“Yeah.”
“Had enough yet?” John asked teasingly as Sherlock shovelled a third heaped scoop of fizzing whizzbees into a paper bag, already holding three pumpkin lollipops and a liquorice wand between his teeth.
“You okay?”
Evidently John fired a hard kick to Greg’s shin at this point. Greg contemplated this information for a second or two, when finally adding “But I thought you two didn’t get on?” This resulted in what was such an enormous kick from John, that the weary chatter hovering through the hall ceased a little, before rising up again, at Greg’s yelp.
“Brother.”
John slipped around the door awkwardly; he was a tad late and he spotted Mike sat at the front, Sarah beside him, and a blonde haired Slytherin girl he’d only ever properly seen on the Quidditch pitch, but no room for him.
“Good luck!” John called pleasantly, a bit dazed, “You going to try-outs as well, Mike?” he asked astounded, as Mike started to follow them,
And it started. The flashing of white and green lights, distorted through glass. The echoing sound of feet running up the wooden stairs. Harry’s hand clasped tightly in his, the feel of his wand clasped tight in his free hand… The screams from downstairs, the smashing of glass, and then the thick, cold, cruel laughter that rang throughout his head, ricocheted around his brain, making its home somewhere deep in his chest… and the pain, the sharp burning vice-like pain lancing its way across his shoulder… and then he was yelling, and yelling, and-
“Umbugular” He snapped impatiently, bouncing on the balls of his feet irritably by the damp stone walls of the common room. Every year Sherlock was always in a hurry to get back to his common room after the opening feast, sprinting to get to bed so Sebastian had no chance to heckle him before they went to their separate dormitories. Sherlock was thankful every day that Seb slept in the 7
He felt John’s gaze upon him soften, “Night, Sherlock.”
And the two parted for the day.
“We knew magic. They didn’t. We should’ve-”
“You’re an idiot,” John said, rolling his eyes,
Sherlock looked up with a start
Halloween (part 2)
“I know…” John said, understandingly.
“Right,” John swallowed, “Right yeah- I’ll just finish this, then go tell your mum, shall I?”
It was an invitation, but clearly for some sort of peace offering more than anything else. Mycroft refused it, bidding his mother goodnight and skulking out the room and up the stairs.
There was the setting down of something on the coffee table. The compression of the sofa cushion next to him.
“That’s alright, we’re away,” she said dismissively, smiling at him.
“John!” Sherlock snapped back, but looked apologetic immediately. “I-I’m thinking – you said you were interested?”
“A hungover zombie!”
“A lot can happen in a minute John. Hey- who’s this handsome thing?” Harry said, dropping onto the bench next to him. John, who’d just happened to have taken a large swig of tea, choked.
“Oh then she must come!”
“Oh you might’ve missed it, but you didn’t. It isn’t in there,” he said, faster paced, growing in enthusiasm, “look!”
“Apparently they’ve got new brooms this term,” he murmured, squinting at the set of blue-robed figures in the distance
The impending fear of progress tests and revising poorly written alchemy notes in the gloomy candlelight of the library was not improved by the fact that Sherlock did not care in anyway whatsoever.
year one, a whole floor to distance them.
“Haven’t the foggiest,” Sherlock shrugged, still smiling widely.
“I need to identify the specific particles in that water- what vegetation its been near, or run through. Obviously by the looks of it it's just old rain water, but looks can be deceiving and as we know this has been planted here- There’s also something- something flaring up in the solution, something irregular- something- that needs investigation. And
Greg's mouth fell open slightly, giving him a remarkable likeness to a goldfish.
When he opened the door of her office, he was surprised to find Sherlock literally right outside the door. He was beaming.
“Here,” John took it off for him. “Sorted.”
“What time is it?” John grunted lazily, having not lifted his head off his books for a good hour or more “Please don’t tell me time for alchemy…”
“So, that would be?”
“Don’t look so worried. I won’t tell,” he said softly, “I’m Jim.”
“Fine- It’s purple. It’s finished colour is purple- almost lilac in colour, actually.”
“Merry Christmas you early risers!”
They scrambled to leave, before-
“Only doing the smaller ones,” John mumbled with his mouth full, “hey, pass us the towel please?”
Sherlock shook his head in dismay, which added to the comic effect as the bells chimed excitedly.
“Sherlock…”
John turned, and started to hide the firewhisky and other drink bottles so when McGonagall arrived they wouldn’t all be expelled on the spot.
John had found in a very short amount of time that Sherlock was chippier when he was stuck on something -
John chuckled, “You’ve mentioned.”
“Jesus…” John breathed, lowering his head onto his Alchemy book.
Over the next few days, neither spoke of the incident, nor did Sherlock’s parents to John’s severe relief, as he was pretty certain they’d have heard… but John could see Sherlock acting rather tentatively around him, especially in the mornings, or if John even so much as stirred in the night. Sherlock would respond almost instantly, and it made a pang of guilt run through John’s chest, when John would rise routinely to get a glass of water, or pop to loo, Sherlock would wake too. John couldn’t pretend, however, that the steady whisper of breath that clipped through the murky darkness from Sherlock’s lips didn’t act as a comfort, whether John required it or not. It was a funny feeling, a closeness John would never have expected… but there it was.
They all stood there contentedly, basking in the warmth of the fire, for a good ten minutes or so, until Sherlock noticed something.
“No problem, no.”
Mrs Holmes had said, which surprised John as the man barely cracked even the slightest indication of merriment the entire meal… but John certainly enjoyed it.
“Pfft. How appropriate, in Hogwarts history…” Sherlock murmured
“So, how was…Herbology? Right?” John asked, kindly, while selecting which giant brass spoon he was going to use.
“Ah, bet that’s hectic,” John said, casually, raising his eyebrows.
“No, you-” John laughed “this case. You said Carl helps with littler ones - you don’t tell him about actual, big things,” He swallowed, “Why’ve you told me?”
“Oh, Gary?”
“I can honestly say you were definitely not” Sherlock said coolly, and the three of them laughed. Sherlock tried to conceal how good that felt, “At this rate it sounds like I’ll be tutoring all of you?”
“What?” John asked, bemused.
“Dull,” Sherlock mumbled, “Guess- what it was- about?” he grunted in between scrapes
“You don’t chat.”
“You’re an idiot,” John smiled, shaking his head.
John went back, reluctantly, to staring at the blackboard. Sherlock went back to staring at the ceiling, leaning deeply back into his chair.
Once through the towering doors, Sherlock didn’t really know what to do with himself; his eyes fell on the four long tables stretched out in front of him, all about-full with cheery looking friendship groups, composed of varying house and age, amongst near empty plates and platters. They all looked rather contented, he thought, and it was distracting.
Mrs Holmes entered, holding an annoyingly perfect few dozen mince pies knocked up in less than five minutes.
Sherlock obliged and found that, once on his head, the different points of his hat began to move independently with the sound of the music, the bells harmonizing with the sound.
“I’m not putting my force up to work on some elaborate prank Mr Holmes.”
“Why are you- what are we doing, here?”
To his surprise, when he entered through the back door, John had evidently just entered through the front, snow clinging to the bottoms of his jeans and…
Sherlock nodded.
“Come on,” John said, voice muffled through his new addition, “Put it on!”
“I saw you earlier,” he said, brightly, “In the library.”
John inspected them; a parcel from Greg, Mike, and his sister, and most likely a Christmas card from Molly, and potentially some people from the quidditch team? Or Madame Turner? He set them down under the Christmas tree at Mrs Holmes’ prompt. It all felt very homely, causing a wave of guilt swirl in his stomach.
“Mince pie?” She asked.
“Oh, that can wait-”
“So you go back home for Granny’s owl, but not back for me… trying to tell me something?” Mycroft moaned.
John beamed at him, “Looks good.”
Sherlock sighed, “It gets very boring in the country. Don’t touch anything until the turkey is carved.”
“I know,” He smirked, “Be sure that the bunting looks symmetrical, or some other comment that suggests I really care about this party.”
He lit his pipe and smoked it.
John nodded, and asked no more.
John, having changed back into his jeans and after a hearty sing-along of the school song in the  changing rooms, left them positively floating. Greg had met Mike and was now waiting outside for him, still chanting “roar-roar-Gryffindor” with a voice now nearly gone.
“You’re worse than my mothe-”
“Not really, Carl,” he said flatly.
John nodded at him, “See you in the morning?”
Harry had been all for it of course, she obviously had more faith in him as an alchemist than he had. She was very generous, Sherlock thought.
“What?” he was aware his voice was small, almost vulnerable.
“What?” He snapped. John raised his eyebrows, “Sorry.”
“Shut up,” Was Sherlock’s reply.
It was more awkward then he’d hoped, having rarely spoken to her before, but there he was.
“Come on everyone!” Greg yelled, looking to John, “Apple bobbing?”
“You and some first years?”
“Oh, I’m not going.” Sherlock replied coolly.
Sherlock frowned, "What makes you so sure?"
“Blue,” John said, warily.
"Mike! Can I sit by you at the feast?" It was Molly Hooper, the Hufflepuff 6th year who Greg was utterly obsessed with. Mike watched as Greg's face fell, and a new found hatred for his best friend began to burn behind his drowsy eyes.
Sherlock obviously noticed this.
“Don’t you dare Sherlock,” John laughed, pulling him back by his arm.
“They’re clean, don’t worry” He added, before instructing Sherlock to pinch his nose, and hold the sock to catch the great deal of blood that was oozing from it, “Good.”
“No-” John practically jumped in protest.
“Smashed files?” His mother said sharply.
Hi! I'm so sorry it's been 84years since my last update... But hope you enjoyed this chapter! Hope you're all well! xo
John hummed agreeably, dunking a shortbread into his own and turned a page with his crumby fingers.
“BASTARD.”
carved into it. John watched as Sherlock began daintily filling its bowl with tobacco, which he stored in a little brass tin, before holding the pipe in his mouth, and giving the end a gentle tap with his wand. This produced a small flame, which vanished after a few seconds, sending up a slight burst of blue smoke into the air, all before carefully pushing the now scorched tobacco down with a small matching brass stamper.
John stared after him.
Happy Halloween everybody!!!
"Let's go and ask then! Yeah, passes the time... Come on! She'd love to see you - John grab an arm!"
Sherlock, looking over the top of his book, felt the corners of his lips twitch into a subtle smirk. Without warning, the roundest of the three, who'd been hiding behind his two friends, was thrown into the compartment. Sherlock recoiled slightly, pushing his back hard against the damp window. The boy smiled awkwardly, and down he sat, and the other two followed suit. Sherlock's eyes flicked across each of them one by one...
“Right.”
Once this was done, he rummaged once again through his bag, one hand on Sherlock who was swaying gently, and brought out a ball of grey socks.
“You nearly got it?” John croaked, in a higher pitch than was expected.
"I'm sorry... J-J-John..." Harry said, drowsily, the potion quickly beginning to take effect, as she lowered herself shakily onto her bed. "I... I-I reeeaally... am... John..." and with that her eyelids closed slowly, and she was out. Her brother gazed at her sadly, her t-shirt stained, her hair a mess, her makeup smudged around her eyes... After a few minutes, he pulled his and Harry's packed trunks out of the wardrobe ready for the morning, made sure he'd got all his uniform in his backpack, blew out the candles, and clambered up onto his top bunk. He lay there, staring at the ceiling, listening to the muffled angry shrieks from Mrs Turner next door. And as they grew silent, and the minutes passing became hours, and the room grew so much darker, he began to wish he'd taken some of the sleeping draught too.
“So why didn’t they explode?” John asked, peering at them worryingly, as if they were about to explode any moment, “You said the fire got close to them, shouldn't we all be horribly burned by now?”
“Not how you imagined Christmas Eve,” John murmured sadly, taking it with a trembling hand. He looked at the floor, sniffling, “I’m so sorry.”
“Sarah! Hi!” John blurted even though he’d only seconds earlier stuffed his 5
But John dropped it.
“Erm. Well, off you go then Billie. Right, what’re we dealing with?”
“But it’s a free-”
“Yes, he’s giving his input he’s-”
John loosened his grip, and began to lead Sherlock down the steep, slippery steps of the Owlery. John went down first, Sherlock gripping John’s shoulder from behind so as to not tumble; the evening’s matters had finally caught up with him it seemed. He thought, no, was certain he felt John flinch at his touch, but before Sherlock could retract John insisted “No. Do, its fine!”
“How can I help…?” John said, mouth falling open.
“Better go,” John said, giving him a gentle shove into the sea of students all heading away from them in a fast flowing current.
"He's saving us a compartment, come on," said John, grabbing hold of Mikes shoulders kindly, steering him down the carriage, still laughing.
“My last match against Sebastian.”
“You won,” He said quietly.
When everyone grumbled Sherlock felt it best to nominate John to play the next round, and quickly realised charades is actually quite fun when John is the one acting it out. For all his trying John was unable to get any answer out of them that wasn’t along the lines of “upset chicken” or “dragon with toothache” or Mycroft’s contribution of “How i feel right now'. Sherlock didn’t think he’d ever laughed so much in all his life.
“What did?”
Sherlock tossed the hat to the end of his four poster carelessly and tucked himself into the crisp, clean linen. He shut his eyes, forcing sleep to take him.
“Mikey, you won’t be needing an umbrella for another few weeks at least! It’s summer-”
“I went for the drizzle, thanks for asking” said Mycroft, lowering himself reluctantly into the chair besides Sherlock. “Looks like you’ve been buying too”
Greg slouched down onto the floor, yawning, “Good.”
“Like, now, Sherlock? There’s a murderer relatively close by here and at this point, we’re the only two who know about it.”
(part 2 coming later this week)
Sherlock stood up, with a slight wobble, rather stroppily, before setting about the task of feeding Billie, sprinkling pellets into a dish with an unnecessary amount of aggression.
“Well I shan’t keep you, goodnight Mr Watson!”
“How’s it look?” He asked anxiously, sticking his head out into John’s line of vision.
“All that just to prove that the person reporting the murder wasn’t the murderer?”
“You said, yes.”
“Are,” Sherlock said, “You copied them down wrong. Forgot to say.”
“They’re damp, John,” Sherlock gave the pouch a little squeeze, causing a few muddy drops of water to fall between them, “Severely - couldn’t ignite. Look-” Sherlock unfastened the cotton carefully, revealing a small mound of damp greyish/green powder.
Sherlock’s eyes widened, hands reaching behind him to check, “Ah, must have snagged it on a door hinge… or a coat hook, let’s get this over with-” he snapped, approaching McGonagall’s door.
"Is if fair to say I'm already sick of this school year. I already feel homesick. Well, bedsick...” the dark haired boy said matter-of-factly, who Sherlock had learned was named Gavin...
“Language Sherlock” His father piped up.
“Still- still made you jump, though,” Sherlock was wiping tears from his eyes, “Oh your face!"
Then they all started counting, all of them bouncing up and down excitedly. Drinks were being spilled, but no one cared. There was a minute to go. Fifty seconds. Forty. Thirty. Twenty.
“How…” he cleared his throat, blinking frequently. “What- what the fuck is your problem?”
The boy smirked slightly, as his eyes fixed on a wizard seven years older than himself, having a tantrum as he left 'Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions'.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, turning to face him.
“Don’t be absurd,” He said smugly, taking another drag on the end of his pipe “Anyway the letter itself is straight to the point, no mentions of “I’m devastated” or “I can’t go on” – shows a level of assertiveness. Guilty people often tend to overcompensate the pain it’s causing them, this lady simply wants the case to be solved.”
“Guess not… okay,” John smirked, “Come on then.”
“Well not ruining- you know what I mean, Watson.”
“18th” John answered.
“Pft, no,” He said, a look of disgust upon his face “But I can’t miss out on Greg… ‘Throwing stuff’ now can I!”
Switching POV
“Anywhere?” he said cheekily.
“Not going to write anything today Mr Holmes?” the Professor said accusingly.
Right.
Sherlock took a swig of his tea, “Can you tell?”
“Yes, Professor,” Sherlock said dismissively.
"Neither do I?" John retorted, smiling.
He snuck inside, and was relieved to see it was empty, apart from a few students who weren’t particularly nice to Sherlock, but didn’t outwardly want to destroy him, sitting on the sofa lazily, giggling hysterically and hiccupping every four seconds.
“I don’t understand…”
Sherlock sniggered, “Probably did. Glad to see the back of me for a bit.”
John grimaced.
“What about Alchemy?”
“Hang on, what? Sherlock, this is an actual murder?”
“But I’d finished the work.”
Sherlock nodded, smiling.
But before John good find out if Sherlock was at wherever he was about to say, an angry yell from two boys behind cut him off –
He had changed his jeans twice, the black pair, the dark grey pair, then had changed to a pair of slim dress trousers, but then returned to the first pair of jeans as to not appear too formal. He’d decided on a plum-coloured shirt tucked into said jeans with a belt, the top button open, but was panicking on the debacle of whether to wear socks or shoes.
She was always like this, always. John knew he shouldn't be surprised... but
Sherlock wheeled round.
“Morning, mate!”
“It’s not broken this time, at least,” John said, looking at him worriedly, “He didn’t hit you anywhere else?”
John nodded, gleefully.
“Sherlock?” John persisted, waving a hand in front of his face when he got no response.
As the crowd broke into applause at the teacher's efforts, Sherlock’s eyes pierced through every student he could see, and that’s when he saw it; at the back of all the laughing and cheering, the back of hooded figure, was skulking away into the smoky evening.
A friend of John’s and a stranger they’d brought with them were sat on his bed, very close together.
“I’m sorry?” Seb laughed, grabbing his shoulders painfully “You want us to stop?”
John shut his eyes tight, lips pursing. Sherlock held him tighter still.
“Yes, well… I better be off to bed…” and Sherlock began to turn away.
After slipping and sliding for a bit longer down the paths-
“I’m so sorry-” John wheezed, “Ah… it’s really not your night, is it?” He began to dab his eyes gently with a nearby napkin, still bobbing up and down somewhat as his laughter petered away.
Sherlock could feel his brothers intruding gaze searching the two of them, could feel the judgement and opinions he was forming within the first thirty seconds of seeing him. He hated it. All he wanted to do was to disappear before he could stick his overly large nose into something… but of course that was made impossible by the excited footsteps of his mother running down the stairs.
Sherlock, still giggling, found his gaze falling on the far end of the hall, where Clara and Harry were sat very close, hands linked tightly, and beaming at each other. Sherlock couldn’t help but beam too.
“What do you mean we’ve got a case?”
And before John could intervene, Sherlock was rapping the doorknocker of the office.
After dressing, he snuck back into the dormitory and onto his bed, redrawing the curtains around him, and waited.
Sherlock lay there a good while, the hurt expression that swept across John’s face flickering behind his closed eyelids over and over again, with the sudden pain that appeared in his eyes...
Sherlock stared at the floor, clearly thinking.
Also, I am very aware I haven't posted in ages, school's been very demanding but I will try to post chapter 8 and possibly 9 over the next week or so. Again, I am so sorry :') I know I'm not very good at this...
“He found out I had a double-free this afternoon. So of course told Hagrid I’d love to help him,” Sherlock frowned slightly, “he collared me earlier… he was so thankful… couldn’t say no really.”
“What? I thought you’d want to-”
“So you started… this… over the summer then?” he asked, trying and probably failing to sound aloof.
That Sunday morning, Sherlock awoke from a relatively boring sleep to find the bruises on his face had lessened slightly, which was a pleasant surprise. Sliding from his bed- thankfully  his dorm-mates had already risen- Sherlock opened his window, half expecting Billie to have left the client’s reply there in the night. Alas, there was nothing, apart from a dewy cobwebs swaying in the morning breeze.
A look of shame crossed McGonagall’s face.
“You are truly an idiot, do you know that?” John breathed, still laughing.
“No, no it’s fine… it’s just the last drop of dignity I have pouring away!” Sherlock whined, dropping his spoon down into the bowl.
CHRISTMAS... in July... FINALLY (this chapter is very long so enjoy)
“Sherlock.”
The area surrounding them was empty now, even Mike had left without waiting for him.
“Don’t be so miserable, that handsome John Watson asked you, didn’t he?” she raised her eyebrows, smirking.
“Oh er- I was actually er,” she murmured, drawing her eyes away from the bruises on Sherlock’s nose “I was going to go to the Hufflepuff Quidditch trials…” she said, suddenly shy, “I just missed the cut for chaser last year, but-”
“Ah right” John tried his best not to sound the least bit worried “ever been caught?”
But before John could question ‘right about what teapot?’ Sherlock was on to the next letter. This one was lengthy, with four or five photographs pinned to the bottom. Sherlock’s eyes widened, a grin stretching up one side of his face. Intently, John surveyed as Sherlock pulled a delicate piece of black ribbon from yet another pocket of his robes and, using his letter opener, pierced it through the top of what was now his fourth letter.
John was dismayed at how gullible they all were, but knew not to mention what Sherlock clearly wanted to hide.
Sherlock hummed.
“Pfft, John… I know many a secret passage in this place that even the teachers don’t know exist…” he said proudly.
Eventually, with some help from the very nice, very normal, lady, John came across the perfect one. Well, he thought so anyway. It was a dark green cable knit one, thick enough, but very very soft. Sherlock was a lot slighter than John, but John got him quite a baggy one anyway.
Sherlock shot him a dark look.
Sherlock sighed irritably, “Of course- want it sweetened with the blood of your enemies, or?”
John thought this a bit rude at first, however as soon as Carl’s friends had walked ahead of him, he erupted such a spew of questions onto Sherlock that John very much understood.
(See the end of the chapter for
Once back, and once they’d nursed Granny’s very disgruntled screech owl who'd been sat on their doorstep back to health, Sherlock and John opened their presents from their school fellows, and Sherlock  was surprised at the fact he… had any?
McGonagall looked up at him, and Sherlock quickly wiped his smile away.
“They took my cloak.” He said hoarsely, muffled through his hand. “And my wand…” he felt himself flush, ears growing hot.
the four of them settled down on a set of stones protruding from the grassy slope, which had just about dried thanks to the morning sunshine. John was pleased Sherlock was joining them; it surprised even him how quickly the events of the previous evening had warmed him to him. He felt a sudden eagerness to learn more about this detective lark, however something told him to perhaps leave it until only the two of them were present.
John took in a sharp breath, and he held it. It was surprisingly useful when trying not to yell in a practically silent classroom.
“I think I’ll manage without it,” he said, smiling.
“Come on, it’s cold over here-” Graham said, backing towards the courtyard again.
“I’m fine,” he snapped.
“Excuse me, erm, do you have any Gryffindor ties please?” John said politely in between breaths: He and Greg had to fight their way through the commotion outside the shop: twin girls who were obviously first-years-to-be, with confused muggle parents.
“What?”
He stared blankly ahead of him, eyes red-rimmed and weary, but Sherlock could feel his breathing evening out.
“Hopefully you’ve given us an actual chance this year!” Mike chimed up.
“Go. Now.”
“Thanks, Sherlock,” she blushed even deeper.
“I should, you know, hit the hay. It is Christmas Eve tomorrow, and who sleeps properly on Christmas eve?” John said tiredly, fists clenched at his sides.
Sherlock merely shook his head and moved his hand from John’s shoulder, instead wrapping his arm around his friend's back.
“Aren’t you?” Sherlock spat coolly, putting on his scarf, barely glancing at him, “Can Sebastian Wilkes really be classed as company?”
“Sat by the lake,” Sherlock said, truthfully “Nice day for it.”
A few titters erupted from a nearby cluster of students as the four of them were seated, however before Sherlock could express his new found desire to run off and become a dragon tamer, or to bury himself in the darkest depths of the forbidden forest, Gareth began flipping them off profusely. John then fixed them with such a cold stare that Sherlock decided perhaps he could wait until at least his second morning coffee before finding a way to disappear. Before long, Gareth had piled four pieces of buttered toast, each lathered in a different variety of jam, onto his plate and began shovelling them into his face. Mike had grabbed himself a croissant and a large bowl of ‘Pixie Puffs’, and John had decided on the smallest piece of toast in the stack, which he tore at the crusts of for a good few minutes before taking even the tiniest morsel.
As Sherlock and Mycroft hurried back up the lane bickering, John hung back slightly.
He shook himself.
“I’m fine,” John said quickly, trying to bury a laugh as he gently let the pumpkin seeds fall from his hand.
Sherlock was sure he’d heard that wrong.
The room was a mess. Poorly carved pumpkins lay haphazardly about the carpeted floor, bowls of sweets were overflowing onto their surfaces, and there were about four bottles of firwehisky sat open and at different degrees of emptiness already.
John looked at Sherlock.
After more of a struggle than he’d expected, having to outrun Filch down by the entrance hall, and nearly knocking over a suit of armour by the entrance to the dungeons, Sherlock was back at his common room. Thankfully, regardless of all the commotion, he remembered the password, and which wall to whisper it too.
“Like a detective?”
His face was creased with tired, but beaming, “You joining us for breakfast, then?” Sherlock peered behind him, and there were Mike and John, both yawning and somewhat dishevelled, “Come on then- look at your bloody eye, eh? I’ll kill Sebastian.”
John joined in, “Wow I’m sorry…”
“Nothing, we just had to run from Filch.”
“Looks like I better be, hadn’t I?”
Sherlock rose to go, and John said, more brightly “see you in Alchemy first thing?”
John extended a hand, and Sherlock took it, very very slowly.  John attempted to pull him back to a sitting position, succeeding eventually, but it took a few attempts. Once he was up, well… their hands remained interlocked for at least a minute after, but neither of them really seemed to mind.
“I can’t do Magnussen first lesson. I can’t cope…” mumbled Greg, flicking out a lazy arm and pulling the mug towards him. “I’ll nut him if he even comes near my cauldron… with them drippy hands of his…”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and huffily slumped back against the wall, yet sprang straight back up again seeing his mother sharply draw in breath.
“Said you were a good flyer.”
They watched as Hagrid, giving the bonfire one last triumphant smile, headed into the castle in seek of warm. The clock tower wasn’t exactly warm either.
As John threw his parchment idly into the pits of his bag, he saw Sherlock’s cloak flick around the door, just as it had done in potions that morning, and he paused.
“What? How can he when he seems completely unalarmed that I have been sent two photographs of a corpse in the post?” Sherlock spat, standing, “Fine. I’ve been pranked. It’s not the first time, but you cannot tell me those photos are not a feature of interest.”
“So what… you think Hagrid accidentally pulled up a deadly poisonous purple flowered shrub and added it to the bonfire for good measure?”
“They’re not the same colour” Mycroft and his brother snapped in unison, to which their father reacted by flopping into the nearest purple, sorry lilac, squashy arm chair.
“Mhm,” John replied, smiling, “It was nice.”
“What?”
“Oh darling we -” Mrs Holmes said excitedly, gesturing him closer,
John hummed in response, and before long Greg was back to snoring again. John stared at the ceiling of his four-poster, listening to the snores, terrified to fall asleep.
“She’s got it!” Yelled the commentator over the tannoy, and the Gryffindor seeker pulled up into the air, holding the snitch high above her head.
Somehow over an hour had past, and there they were still scrunched uncomfortably in a filthy corner of the Owlery as Sherlock reeled off letter, after letter, after letter to John, who seemed, at least, to be clinging to every word. To be quite honest, Sherlock daren’t question why he was listening so intently, why he was interjecting at the correct, informed, appropriate points, or why he was exclaiming “fantastic!” and “brilliant!” at random intervals. So, to combat those worries… Sherlock just kind of… kept going? It wasn’t until the clock tower rang out 9 o’clock across the cool night air that Sherlock finally stopped talking, much to both his and John’s disappointment.
“No,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “just giving it a tune.- She’s horribly out of service…”
His mind suddenly darted to the letter he’d received the night before, and how furiously impatient he was to solve it.
“Twice”
“Don’t you shake hands, Sherlock?” the boy said quietly.
“Homework, recap the works of Nicholas Flammel via a timeline; one sheet of parchment should suffice! In for next week!” Borage called, clearing his throat.
“You really want him to have this party, don’t you?” John smirked.
However, as the clock tower rang out for twelve-o’clock, Sherlock said simply, “I don’t know what I’m going to do really – about the case, I mean.”
“Sherlock, is that your owl?” John said, trying not to shiver, gesturing to the small black dot whch was hovering against the white sky.
John paused for a moment.
Sherlock stopped, then suddenly jumped to his feet.
“Yeah, guess he is,” John said, quietly.
“But I want to,” He said urgently, “I picked up a few things today while I was out, so you don’t need to worry about ingredients- it has to be vegetarian, though, but…”
His fingers ran over the detailed crest on its rim - It was the Slytherin hat that older boy,
“No, I think not, no,” He then looked at him worriedly, “You alright?”
Mrs Holmes plonked herself down in Sherlock’s vacant spot. She didn’t mention the throw that still covered John’s legs, or the deep grooves that remained in the sofa back, which did not require the mind of any of the Holmes’ to deduce that they had slept there.
Sherlock huffed, and it seemed to move his whole body, “My socks aren’t organised, John,” he whined, like an overtired toddler, “I keep trying, but they. Won’t. Organise.” `
“Bumping into Seb again?” Sherlock remarked coolly
He spat the last few words, but paused to compose himself before continuing.
“People are going to be drinking.”
“Oh just had a lazy morning in the-”
"Jesus mate, could you cut it any finer?!"
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in response.
“I don’t know, I notice” and after a few seconds, frowning slightly “You want to know how I did the… train… thing?” Sherlock said hesitantly, peering nervously at John, as if he was something delicate that could be broken easily, “Well I told you, I thought? Your clothes - ironed and mended yourself, the bags under your eyes, the obvious fact you hadn’t eaten that day, the repetitive closing of your left hand the moment anyone mentioned anything to do with being at home-”
Carl smiled.
“Cheers,” John said in response, lifting his cup to Sherlock’s.
“So so far we have Mike Stamford, Molly Hooper, Greg Lestrade, your sister Harry, and Stephen Bainbridge?”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows as John suddenly looked up at him in panic.
As he was paying, which took longer than it should have as John was quite out of practice with muggle banknotes, the lady complimented him upon his scarf.
Sherlock gave John a half encouraging sort of nod, and before John could say anything or even finish his fifth cuppa, he was being dragged out of the hall by the very excitable Gryffindor team.
The Ravenclaw Quidditch team were also out and about, heading in high spirits in the direction of the pitch, broomsticks in hand, and chattering brightly to one another. John eyed them closely.
“I’m off,” he said, with a stretch, nodding to them.
“Still,” Sherlock murmured.
Sherlock, quietly, tried to add that
“Greg. Finishing off breakfast I think. You sure you don’t need anything?”
They exchanged glances and Sherlock swallowed slowly.
“You sure-”
Carl suddenly flushed slightly, “Well, you know- nothing big, just- I can’t find-”
“Sherlock?”
“Right, everyone open their books to page 48, Spagyric, and I’ll explain our key outcomes for this autumn term. We’ll be starting with-”
A sudden thump of pain swelled in the narrow bridge of Sherlock’s nose as he took his first step forward, acting as a helpful but uncomfortable reminder of what was to be now prominent bruising across most of his face…
If he could just get to the feast, he’d be safe. Feet slamming harder and harder upon the freshly-cut lawn, he made a break for the stone path snaking its way up to safety.
“So you’ll come?” John asked again. Sherlock nodded, reluctantly, “Cool!”
John shook himself.
“Sorry what?”
John looked at him, puzzling, “O...kay” he said, with an intrigued smile.
John elbowed Sherlock in the ribs.
“I know,” Sherlock gently rocked him back and forth.
“Tomorrow’s going to be amazing, we’ve got so much stuff!”
"You're the captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team" Sherlock replied.
Greg paused, “We hide?”
With a sigh of relief, he pulled at a slightly crumpled parchment bag and thrust it in Sherlock's direction. Sherlock opened it and pulled out the Slytherin hat he'd bought two weeks ago that day, still in its wrappings. He tried, he really did, to say thank you, but for some reason he couldn't explain, his voice didn't want to work. Instead, he nodded in the direction of his own trunk below John's feet. John understood and slid it out towards him. Sherlock opened it, and there on the very top was John's tie. John snatched it, beaming, and began examining it carefully.
“Sherlock,” John tilted Sherlock’s chin upwards.
“What?” John asked.
“When the DLE are out of their depth, which is always, people come to me instead. I’m better.”
John burst out laughing, “I am not overly keen on your train of thought there, Greg… don’t tell me you’ve been so unlucky with Molly that you’re going to chase Mycroft!”
After a few minutes, a long clear call from an owl seemed to bring Sherlock back to the real world; He leapt up, yet regretted it immediately, cradling his ribs and wincing a little. Alas, he seemed bursting with enthusiasm all the same. A smile spread across his face “That’ll be Billie, come on.” And he was off again, this time in the direction of the Owlery and, as before, John followed without a moment’s doubt.
John, rather awkwardly, released his hips.
“Anywhere specific?”
“Finally into the Halloween spirit then?” She said, leaning closely to Sherlock’s shoulder, “Oh, hi John, Greg,” She continued offhandedly.
“I’m- I’m Sherlock,” Sherlock managed.
“Sure. Why not?” he offered, smiling, which neither Mycroft or Sherlock returned.
“Yeah,” John said, staring at him as a nipping wind whipped round, causing his curls to quiver and Sherlock to shiver, pulling the cuffs of his jumper tight into his palms, “Yeah I bet it is.”
John immediately raised his eyebrows at Sherlock, starting to chuckle.
As the sun began to sink lazily, casting thick shadows of the tall hoops and seats across the lawn, and the bell tower echoed along the early-evening breeze, the Gryffindor team, now sweaty but contented, trudged back up to the castle in time for a well-deserved meal. Being captain, it was John’s job to return the rather hefty case of Quidditch gear after changing roughly back into his robes. This meant, although John rarely minded, that he was always slightly later to the feast after training than the others. He needn’t worry, however, Greg never went near John’s “rabbit food” as he so called it, also known as his meatless meal.
“Nope. Leave it, I’m fine.”
Sherlock hesitated.
“We were home for Christmas,” he exhaled, “A nice, normal Christmas. You remember what it was like- How bad it was with… with you-know-who-”
, instead of obsessing over how some old lady lost all of her cats
“I like dangerous.”
. He gave himself a little shake and leant back against the cool stone idly.
“-but she’s Sebastian’s girlfriend.”
John felt his face turning scarlet. Greg began to snigger. John kicked him. He stopped. Seb and Andrew exchanged malevolent looks at the mention of ‘Mr Holmes’, and John felt an extra surge of hatred rush through him.
“Your brother,” he said rather stiltedly, “I was wondering if- would he perhaps want to-”
“Pass me that phial.”
“What?”
“-It was all kept so quiet,” John continued, “how were we to-” but he trailed off.
“You okay?” John said, smirking slightly at the small rising flour that emanated from his jumper when Sherlock released it.
“Well, just… perhaps-”
Janine clocked this “Oh no don’t panic, he’s lovely honestly! Anyway,” She blushed slightly and a smile split across her face round face “I’ve said I’d meet him by the main stairs before lesson starts so… I’ll see you later Sherlock.”
Harry blinked at him. But it wasn’t a worried or shocked blink, but a smug one, an almost knowing one.
John huffed, but obliged, gently slipping the phial into Sherlock's hand.
“Give him one for me, Seb!”
“Right, is it only your nose?” John said breathily, crouching beside him whilst fumbling through his rucksack.
“He’s twenty-four, has a nose three times too large for his face, thinks he’s going to be Minister of Magic one day, has far too much interest in my life, and probably knows exactly who you are already…” Sherlock spat bitterly, “Oh and he’s a rubbish big brother.”
“Good,” John said flatly, pulling on his pyjamas, “Now shut up, I’m shattered.”
“You may go now, John.”
When they got downstairs, Sherlock with his violin in hand, Mrs Holmes practically wept, and poured everyone a glass of mulled wine as Sherlock positioned himself in front of the fire. He stood with great precision, back impeccably straight and eyes focused, which was a funny sight considering he was wearing baggy flannel pyjamas and Christmas socks. He cleared his throat, and everyone, even Mycroft, quietened.
“Sherlock! Owl!”
However the silence that followed was more comforting than John thought silence could be. Sherlock stared ahead of them, and John was suddenly struck with the thought, that after barely three days... Sherlock understood. Well, just enough.
About twenty minutes in, Slytherin started to get nasty; one of the their beaters angled a bludger right at Stephen’s head, which he thankfully ducked out of the way of at the last minute, and Sebastian had started ramming into the Gryffindor chasers, presumably to knock them off their brooms. It was at this moment that the Gryffindor seeker, a fourth year girl who’d been hovering above the rest of the action for the rest of the match, suddenly soared higher into the air.
“Okay. Then just try to look like you’re paying attention.” His voice grated.
Sherlock grinned.
Sherlock beamed, a slight flush growing on his face.
He unfastened the parcel, lifted Billie onto his perch, checked to see if there was food (there was) and was about to throw the parcel carelessly onto his desk when intrigue got the better of him. Sitting down on his windowsill, in the moonlight he swore the string binding the parcel looked familiar?
After a few minutes harmless chatter, however, John noticed Sherlock’s focus shifted to the Slytherin table.
“Nowhere whatsoever,” He leapt up onto the windowsill, drawing his knees up under his chin, “Write to Carl. Ask him whether he himself has any ideas on who would steal from him- All we can do until we’re back at that hateful school.”
“We watched him build it, remember? When he left there was nothing but wood and some shoddy old sofa cushions on there.”
And Sherlock, only slightly stumblingly, made his way out into the corridor, and after giving John a gentle wave, crept off into the darkness.
“Fuck you, goblin.”
“Ah, Mr Watson, Mr Lestrade… Fighting already? Only, few, five minutes into the first lesson of term? Twenty points from Gryffin- Gregory put Mr Hope down!” Greg reluctantly let go of Andrew’s collar, and lowered himself back into his seat, fuming. John began drumming his fingers on the table heavily. Harry looked over at him nervously, but John didn’t meet her gaze.
John was dreading alchemy; it was one of the most difficult subjects the school offered, and he required it for his future.
John shrugged, “Sure, yeah.”
“Have you been sulking?” John smirked, “About the case?”
“And defence against the dark- seriously?”
“No- Here now-” Sherlock reached up his second arm, lacing his fingers around the jar, causing John to grab hold of his waist for support. John swallowed.
“Oh as always.”
And with a grin, Mike turned and began trudging off as well.
“Watching you.”
“Don’t worry,” Sherlock said gently to her.
Sherlock barely said a word, and ate even less than he did normally, which was quite impressive, pushing food around with his fork seemingly for the joy of doing it, barely two forkfuls making it up to his mouth.
“Come on, I fancy some fresh air, wanna go for a wander?”
“You were listening?”
“No really, John!” he barked, still staring.
John was certain she glared directly at Greg as she spoke. They giggled. And with that, John grabbed the arms of Greg and, to his surprise, Sherlock, and the three of them rushed from the hall, eagerly awaiting what was to come.
John smiled warmly, but Sherlock couldn’t help but notice John’s avoidance in meeting his eye.
John practically collapsed onto the sofa.
“There” John said happily, sliding the bowl over towards the boy opposite. He looked positively giddy at the idea of tucking in. When Sherlock didn’t immediately scoop some into his mouth, like John would’ve done, Sherlock noticed a gentle seriousness sweep across his face, “You need. To eat.”
“Let’s just… be potions partners if we have to, see each other in alchemy and-"
But as he turned to go, he said “Oh actually, Sherlock- I have a case for you-”
The day before school starts again... Johns POV
Sherlock thought a moment.
“It would be obvious… and helpful… if they put that in the method” John said irritably.
"Sure yeah, let's get a seat away from the front so we don't get stuck with the bloody first years... See you later.... Greg." Mike answered, a sly smirk seeping up his pink face, as Molly and he rushed off to the Hufflepuff table.
“Definitely not then,” She snapped, “Scratch that last.”
Even with two of them the task was impossible, wherever John would place a pair of socks, Sherlock would move it, or one of them would find the pattern on the sock funny, or say it looked like Mycroft, or something else unbelievably unhelpful, until they were both giggling into the sock drawer.
So sorry this is SOOOO late... by that I mean six months late... I'm finally free from college and exams and revision and all that gross stuff and on holiday now until September! So I promise updates will get actually more frequent, and I'm not just saying that this time... Thanks for still reading after such a long break!
but thankfully he was given little time.
It warmed him to see how pleased Sherlock looked at this.
Sherlock nodded, and just as he was beginning a lengthy plot in how to remove Magnussen from the castle without trace, a smirk split across his face. He’d found his hiding place.
and after grabbing his slippers headed back the way he went downstairs, careful not to slip on the little droplets Sherlock had left behind him.
“Just- put it down!” John laughed, swatting at Sherlock’s hand, elegantly swishing his wand from side to side. This sent yet another cloud of flour into the air from his sleeve.
A wide grin was desperate to spread across John’s face, which he fought to retain control of. He pulled his parchment towards him.
“Hm, someone wants to be wired,” Gareth chuckled “What you got planned for your Saturday?”
“Why are you giggling then?” Sherlock said, starting to smile himself.
“Anything interesting happening?”
“I can imagine” John added, kindly.
Sherlock didn’t know where to go after leaving the dungeons. But it’d felt so good; shoving his perfectly completed potion into Magz’ cold face and storming out of the classroom... but where now? It was nearing break time, which meant the remainder of his potions class would be leaving soon... meaning Sebastian Wilkes would be leaving soon... so Sherlock’s first logical move was to transport himself as far away from the dungeons as possible within the next ten minutes. After gliding through the empty corridors, having to slow to a walk every time he passed an open classroom door, he arrived in the entrance hall. He was met with Filch, the caretaker, mopping the floors, whimpering with each muddy footprint he lay his eyes upon. This meant one thing to Sherlock. Rain. Sherlock’s glance darted to the window and yes, it was indeed pouring it down. Rain meant there were less places for Sherlock to hide himself, only having within the castle walls as his sanctuary. (It was out of the question to risk getting his freshly ironed robes, his new shoes and his freshly-washed curls soaked) So where? His original plan was to linger around the womping willow until the end of break, then he was scot free; Anderson, Seb and Andrew all had Herbology for lessons three and four. With that, the bell tower rang out for 11 o’clock, end of the lesson, so once again, Sherlock bolted up the marble staircase, skipping the third step from the top (as it was Thursday) and continuing down the long corridor leading to the library. Once it was in sight, he slowed his pace, and the doors around him opened. Students spilled across the floors stalling him to a stop.
John and Greg sat at the back of the potions class, their cauldrons were set up, John’s book open (Greg had forgotten his) and there they were, waiting for Professor Magnussen to arrive. In front of them was Sebastian Wilkes and his friend Andrew Hope. John was less than impressed…
Sherlock’s mouth went rather dry.
“Not that you’d solve it,” Sherlock said coolly.
“Run!” and Sherlock turned on his heal, pumpkin chunks still attached to his shoes, grabbed John’s arm and pulled him, them both running down the path, dodging the many shoppers and students as they went.
It's been ages since the last update, I found this chapter hard to get right :') HOPE YOU ENJOY!!!
Sherlock was taken aback.
John was taken a back. He did mind, really. He wanted to grab it and throw it into the lake, with the little tin and all, but how could he? He barely knew Sherlock, after all, a fact that all too quickly he’d forgotten. And anyway, the smoke seemed to be funnelled by an invisible barrier, so it only rose around Sherlock himself…
Ooof. He clattered to the pavement with a painful thump. However, the fall wasn’t as… hard? as he’d expected? He opened his eyes slowly, the sound of laughter from an individual close by, and saw he was lying on top of a relatively short individual, with that sandy coloured hair that gets mistaken for both blonde and brown, who’s head was lying on the cool stone cobbles outside Fortescue’s.
“Who’s that then?” Greg asked, staring after him.
However he could hear a group of students seemingly conducting a séance somewhere, giggling and stifling screams as they spoke aloud what seemed to Sherlock a very boring read.
“Okay?” John asked, following his gaze.
Sherlock beamed back.
"Did you- did you wash it?" He said with a laugh, looking utterly chuffed with it.
“Same as you,” The boy said, smiling widely.
“Fine.” And then, rather grudgingly added “Thank you.” He ate the broth without any fuss from then on, although primarily as he felt John’s eyes boring into him every time he put down his spoon.
Soon enough, the time for chanting, counting and holding champagne readily had arrived. Mike, Molly and Mary stood excitedly, arms linked together. The room full of guests were united, the music had been paused, someone had written a timer in the air in sparks with their wand, which was now fizzing at the edges readily as it ticked down to only two minutes remaining. The back door to Sherlock’s garden was open, and a handful of guests were ready to release their filibuster fireworks, and Mycroft was not-so-sound asleep in bed.
Sherlock proceeded to carefully peel the near translucent mixture from John’s face.
“Joooohn!”
John paused, starring at him intently, trying to not react.
“Alright.” Seb said quietly, eyes flicking back and forth in the direction of McGonagall’s room. “Another time then. Freak”
“… Sherlock, you know Greg.”
“Happy Halloween, Sherlock,” The boy sang after him, “Do sleep well.”
There was something off-putting about his enthusiasm.
“What riveting conversation. I’m so glad John’s staying with us,” Mycroft droned, waltzing into the kitchen. Judging by the yelp that followed either their mother or father had hit him with a newspaper.
John, too, bought a pumpkin lollipop, and Greg bought a chocolate frog, and the three of them then found a seat on the low wall outside, covered in decorative cobwebs,
“Right.”
John watched, menacingly, as his neighbour’s potion turned the correct shade of yellow… “How the hell-”
“Morning!” Greg said, louder than everyone else, of course.
Completely understand if you've lost interest after such a long wait... Sorrysorrysorry! xo
“Your mother… your mother… Oh yes! Isnt she that ex-Slytherin philosopher who restarted the fight for Muggle-protection after Voldemort’s downfall, then went and married a mud-blood Hufflepuff?” Seb taunted “proud of her are you, Sherlock? Giving you a filthy blooded father and fucking your genes up so badly you’re now a hairy-hearted, unfeeling perv-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Then, with his free arm, Sherlock carefully took John’s glass from him, before reaching for the throw on the back of the sofa and draping it over the both of them. And there they stayed, until Mrs Holmes came down hours later to light the Christmas tree.
“That’s all I’ve got” he grumbled quietly, lifting his pipe to his mouth again.
Sherlock smiled at him, gently.
“Right. Okay” John was smiling really oddly at him, and even he didn’t know why, he felt like he'd lost control of his face… “So you’re unattached, like me. That’s good.”
“Where are the younger ones?” John asked nervously,
“What?”
The three turned in surprise, he'd been so still and silent they'd completely ignored his presence. Again, to Sherlock this was normal. How he liked to see people panic whenever he decided to join in.
John chuckled, “That can often get out of hand, Mrs Holmes-”
“I worry about him. Constantly.”
“You want to go first?” John said, stretching, as Mrs Holmes fired two towels at them with a swish of her wand.
And John did.
“Shut up- help me would you?” came John’s muffled plea from behind his doughy veil.
“I believe so,” He replied, returning his gaze to the front.
“You’ve got soot on your nose,” John murmured, dipping the nib of his quill in the ink.
Sherlock nodded, and they returned to the armchair, but John’s playful smile had been wiped from his face.
“The Owlery!” Sherlock wheeled round “I need to ask them why on earth they wouldn’t report this!”
Sherlock enjoyed being out in the grounds out at night - it often meant slipping out of his four poster under fear of death and having to find the correlation between certain snores of his roommates and how deep their sleep was, but once he was out of the dungeons and, more importantly, out of the castle, he felt more at ease than any other time at Hogwarts. That evening, having nursed his sore nose in some dark corner of the library before heading off to bed, he felt the need to investigate the courtyard.
“John- who’s... Greg?
Anderson spluttered. Sherlock threw him a little wave, before exiting the common room.
“John.”
“But Sherlock I just hope you’re okay, it looks so painful!” she continued, reaching her hand to his face.
“Hello brother mine,” the man said flatly, not venturing into the kitchen any further than the archway, his eyes fell disapprovingly upon John, “This must be your little friend.”
The wall had opened but only a few inches when Sherlock slid through it. He bolted passed the coolly lit fire and jade green armchairs of Slytherin Tower, and up the spiral staircases, not even pausing to survey the new first years whispering excitedly on the snakeskin rug.
“B-Bloody Sebastian!” He burst out, slamming his fist, and his coat, down on the table loudly.
“Oh. Oh right.” John paused a moment, looking at him hesitantly, “So you’ve got a boyfriend? Which is fine by the way!”
Harry rose to meet him, before pulling him off to one side away from the table.
"I’m fine Greg. Okay? I'm... I'm great." and that was that, the three sat in silence listening only to the clickity clack of the carriage on the path, and the chatter from carriages behind and in front.
