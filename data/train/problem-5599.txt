To distract himself from the pain and humiliation Tony looked towards the still locked door and imagined Steve kicking it down with the rest of the Avengers in tow and putting bullet holes between Brock's and Tiberius eyes.
“Steve, we’ll be alright, all we need is eachother, our friends… And a shit lot of therapy.”
Steve chuckled at that.
Clint came with the car just as he felt Bucky put his hand on his shoulder.
“Yeah, that's just what we need.”
“The basement” Ana breathed out “It's no wonder that mister Stark didn't want us anywhere near it.”
“Oh, you know, fine. I mean why wouldn't I be? After my dad abused me, my mother neglected me and you abandoning me I should be nothing but happy, right?”
Steve gave a grim nod and started to retell what Tony had told him. He explained everything from when they took him, to Rumlow's torture, to Schmidt’s talks. When he told them about the rape he could see everyone tense up and anger spread across their faces and was forced to stop so that they could calm down before continuing.
“Ow! What was that for!?”
“S-Steve?”
Tony laughed at that and cuddled closer to Steve who hugged him tighter. That fell asleep like that, cuddled close and feeling like in that moment, nothing could go wrong.
“Hey” Pepper started “we still have today and half of tomorrow. How about we go out and grab a cup of coffee and some doughnuts?”
, her
*throws this out*
The team took the sight in of the burning building and the destroyed vehicles surrounding it. Body parts were littered around them and the Avengers felt their stomachs turn at the thought of Tony being one of them.
“What did you do to my chest? Why am I here?”
Came Tony's panicked voice. He knew what damage Bruce could do, he had seen it when a guy had tried to mug him and bruce had sent the guy to a hospital.
It was red and puffy with a mix of come and blood dripping out and onto the mattress.
He quickly closed the door and dropped the body before he went over to the sea of weapons. He very carefully made his way through it all until he found what he was looking for. A control station was set up by wall on the other side of the room. He turned it on and quickly hacked through the system. He found out that this panel was connected to several of the explosives in the room.
Tony tried to cover his laugh with a cough and if anyone could see his cheeks getting redder, no one mentioned it.
“For being an idiot.”
“Yeah, sure.” He answered shyly.
Steve matches the pace with his thrust and rubbed his thumb across the slit and soon enough Tony was spurting come all over his hands and the sheets and he was clenching down on Steve's member. Steve groaned loudly and it took him three more thrusts to reach his orgasm.
Before they knew it the clock inte wall showed that it was 12.30 already and that they should probably head back before Bruce had a heart attack. They walked out hand in hand Steve couldn't help but to glance around, looking for threats. Tony didn't notice and got into the car.
After a few deep breaths Tony motioned for Steve to continuing. Steve took his time preparing Tony, making sure that he was alright at all times. After fifteen minutes he had four fingers pumping in and out of Tony and Tony was a shaking, babbling mess beneath him.
Ty just smiled sympathetically and pushed forward the coffee cup closer to Tony who just rolled his eyes and took two big gulps. He sighed in content at the taste and then motioned for Ty to start talking.
They split up in cars and Tony went with Bruce, feeling like it had been a little too long since they'd had some time alone.
Tony looked back up at the two and felt tears well up in his own eyes. His lips wobbled and he hugged them both as tight as he could. The guilt was overwhelming and he was starting to shake.
Steve just sighed and rubbed his temple.
"It started a couple of years ago. I had just gotten fired after I lost my temper" right, Bruce's anger issues were nothing to joke about "and after that nobody really wanted to hire a doctor that could lose control like that. That's when a guy from the clinic suggested that I look Steve up, that he could get me a job. I did as I was told and went to him, after some time he offered me a job with them and even if I knew what I was getting myself into I accepted, I was desperate for a job. After a while I got to know them and realized that it wasn't so bad. They became like a family to me." Bruce finished with a soft smile.
“Jesus Christ, I knew he was young, but I didn't think he was that young, Nat! I'm seven years older than him!”
You gotta love badass Anna! And I couldn't help myself from putting in some Peggysous in there
His thoughts, however, were cut short when the little window on the door is pried open and familiar blue eyes were peeking in.
They moved on to remove Steve's shirt who then moved his lips down to suck marks on Tony's neck.
‘Oh Tony’ he thought with a cruel smile stretching across his face ‘you'll regret ever leaving me’.
“I can probably send you blueprints of the building in a minute, I just need to hack the other computer, I'll send it to Bruce's laptop.”
Bruce was, in fact, not ok. Not even close. He had never wanted this to happen to Tony. He had just wanted to keep the young genius safe away from his abusive household but had instead put him in even greater danger than an alcoholic father and a drug addicted mother. Now HYDRA, their rivals, knew about Tony and his involvement with the and it was only a matter of time before they attempted anything else.
He brought up the hand he was holding and pressed a gentle kiss to whatever visible skin he could reach without worrying about hurting his sweetheart any further.
Tony's hand shot up to his neck and remembered the amount love bites on it. He blushed furiously and looked up at Steve who wore an identical expression.
“Captain Rogers” came Jarvis's voice from beside her. “Where is Anthony?”
“Possessive bastard.”
Tony fell to the ground with a groan and and pain exploded through his entire body when the man started to kick him wherever he could reach. Tony was on the verge of a panic attack. The smell of liquor, the screaming of insults, the beating. It all reminded him too much of Howard's abuse but he forced himself to concentrate on something else, like how the hell to get out of this situation.
Steve only clutched him closer to his body, that was all he could do so that he wouldn't get into his car and drive over to Coulson's place where they held Rumlow. They had kept him there for interrogations (among other things, they weren't called the Avengers for nothing) for the sake of Tony's sanity.
“How did he- you know what! I don't even wanna know.”
“I'm sorry” he said.
“Shut it Buck, I wasn't doing anything.”
Was the words he yelled between punches.
The team settled down by the kitchen island while Steve and Tony put the ingredients on the table and started.
When Tony had reached the mansion he was greeted with a kiss on the lips from Steve who grabbed the milk from his hand and put it in the fridge. While putting the milk away he spoke up from where he was crunched down and looked up at Tony.
“What about soy milk?”
.” Sneered Howard while Tiberius and Rumlow were grinning like sharks on either side of him. “This is going to be so much fun.”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated! <3
When he opened the door he was met with the mouthwatering smell of coffee and headed towards the small kitchen he and Bruce shared.
With a calm and icy voice Natasha gestured for him to walk towards her.
Tony had stopped sobbing by the time Brock had finished but silent tears were still making their way down his cheeks. He looked towards the now locked door as if they would return any second. He tried to sit up but the movement made his stomach turn and he turned his head and threw up everything he had in his stomach onto the floor.
“Are you okay Doll? Does anything hurt?”
Tony jerked awake when a loud bang followed by screaming was heard from outside the basement that he had been held in for what felt like an eternity but was actually only about a week. He scrambled up as quickly as his weak body allowed him to when he heard the urgent voices get closer to the door. He wrapped the smelling blanket tighter around his aching frame and prayed that it was Steve outside the door and not his father. His prayers however turned out to be for nothing as the door slammed open and revealed his father accompanied by Brock and Tiberius on the other side. Before he could say anything Howard threw one of his old baggy shirts and boxers at him.
He started to push in one finger but stopping when he felt Tony freeze up.
“Ok guys, let's get this done with.” Announced their leader.
When they finished everyone went up together to get cleaned up themselves. Tony went into his and Steve's room (they had decided to share room since they both slept better with the other one there with them, and besides, they always slept in each other's room anyway). He turned around to face the blonde before giving a slight smirk.
On his way there he passed the place that Rumlow had blow up and kidnapped him. He stopped briefly and rubbed at his chest where the shrapnel had entered and tried to get rid of the phantom pains that blossomed at the memory.
“I said. Let. Him. Go.” Steve was borderline growling and he was standing with Bucky and Bruce on either side of him, all three with their guns up. Suddenly, a satisfied smile spread out on his face.
“I'm terribly sorry Rose. I hope you won't be having any problems because of this.”
“Are you alright my friend? You look distressed.”
“This feels like a Dejavu.”
Tony woke up to the feeling that his chest was on fire. He shot up but groaned in pain and looked down. His chest was covered in bandages with a little dried blood that had seeped through on it.
“Yeah, just give me a moment.”
“I love you.”
He shuddered and kept walking while trying to suppress the memories of his time with HYDRA.
Tony burrowed his face in her neck and inhaled her calming scent. Her arms were back around her and he let himself be held. Rhodey joined the hug and had an arm wrapped around his waist which he used to pull them both into his chest.
Tony just rolled his eyes and grabbed Bruce's hand.
Jarvis just let out a little laugh and laid down while also putting his arms around his wife.
WARNING!!!!!!!
“Anthony Edward Stark, don't you ever say those things about yourself again. You are the best friend a guy could ever ask for and you deserve everything good in this world, especially after all the shit you have gone through. You are the smartest, nicest, most generous person I have ever had the pleasure of befriending. I knew it from the moment I first saw you on campus, fifteen years old, looking lost and with a black eye that this guy was gonna be my responsibility and that I was gonna enjoy every single second of it.”
Everyone groaned in agreement and made their ways to their rooms, hope returning to them.
While Tony changed back to his original clothes Natasha took the opportunity to talk to the leader.
Cline and Bruce turned their heads so fast to Tony's direction that he was surprised that they hadn't broken their necks. Their eyes were wide and mouths agape and Tony was pretty sure that Clint almost dropped his bow. If it had been under other circumstances he would have laughed at them but now this time.
He grabbed his gun and made his way out of the room, looking for threats and doing the navigation in his head.
“I don't know if that's such a good idea, you really hurt me Ty. And besides, I have a boyfriend now, so even if I forgive you, we can't go back to what we were.”
Anyone else would have thought that they were dating but they couldn't be more wrong. Sure, they loved each other, but in a strictly platonic was. Pepper viewed Tony as a little brother and to Tony she and Rhodey were the siblings he always wanted but never got. They were always there for each other, no matter what, and were fiercely protective of each other.
What made him smile though was the state of the boy's asshole.
“Good morning you little shit. Slept well? You gonna talk yet?”
“Sleep darling, I'll be here when you wake up.”
“I'm right here big guy, no need to shout. And thanks, but I'm fine, I've had worse.” That caused Steve to tense up and wrap a protective arm around the smaller man, a faint blush visible on his pale cheeks.
When she reached the unconscious boy she wasted no time to turn him around and get a good look at him. He was breathing and she found a weakening pulse.
Bruce just sighed and gave him a small sad smile.
“It wasn't a dream buddy.”
When he opened it he was greeted by two pairs of arms being wrapped around him. The people who were holding him were yelling at him over eachother and he couldn't help but to grin and hug them back.
Tony just muttered something under his breath and grabbed his hand and dragged him out of there.
“Captain Rogers” he started with a British accent and reached his hand out which Steve shook “I never got the opportunity to thank you and your team for saving me. You have no idea how grateful I am and I am so terribly sorry that you have found yourself in the same position that Erik was. I cannot begin to imagine how you must be feeling.” They let go of each other's hands and Steve and his team sat back down again when Charles settled on Erik’s lap which, judging by the lack of reaction on the Brotherhood’s side, was completely normal.
“How did you know?”
Tony on the other hand tried to not let his discomfort show on his face.
Pepper and Rhodey, who had gotten up from the floor and settled at the foot of the bed, were staring at him with wide eyes and open mouths. Rhodey’s expression then turned into one of anger and he put his hand on Tony's ankle.
“Bruce, listen to me. I know that you just want to protect me and keep my heart from getting broken but I know what I'm doing. I really like Steve and for some strange reason, he likes me to. So please, let me do this. You are the one who always told me that you just wanted me to be happy, and this is making me happy.” To add to the effect Tony put on his best puppy face, the one he knew Bruce couldn't resist. Bruce looked at Tony and then towards Steve who was getting pulled up by Bucky.
Steve sat up straight and for a second Tony could feel his heart drop at the thought of Steve realising that he was right and leaving. But Steve only pulled him up so that they were face to face and stared deeply into his eyes.
Ah, you just gotta love Thor.
After a moment of silence Bruce sighed and told them to take Steve to the infirmary. Bucky was supporting Steve from one side while Tony was holding his hand on the other. They made it to the infirmary where Tony had woken up the first day and put him on the same bed. Everyone left the room but Tony, Steve and Bruce. The doctor took his medical supplies and started to clean his friend up.
“Tony…”
“So” she started with a smirk “you and Tony huh?”
Steve nodded his head with a brave face on but the fear was clear in his eyes. They didn't call Bruce “The Hulk” for nothing.
“Is anybody home?” He did, however, not receive a reply and sent Ana a strange look.
He had to stop for a second if he didn't want it to be over to soon. He knew that none of them would last long but he wanted to drag it out as long as possible.
“It was all a distraction! Phil never sent us the email, it was a trap to get us away from Tony!”
Tiberius just chuckled while basically carrying the struggling and drugged genius out of the cafe before anyone could spot them.
“Why have you been avoiding me?”
He glanced at the clock and saw that it was only 6.50 a.m.
Tony shuddered and felt his knees go weak. He gulped and looked up at the taller man. Both men inches forward and just as their lips were about to meet, Tony spoke up.
When Tony gave him the “go” sign he gently grabbed his hips and started to pull out an inch before pressing back in. He repeated the motion before going out further and pressing in, all while picking up the speed. Soon he was almost all the way out, only the tip still in before he slammed back in hard. Tony threw his head back in pleasure and moaned loudly.
All he got in reply was the bedroom door slamming shut.
They fell asleep like that once more and didn't wake up again until Jarvis came in with a tray of food
Steve let his eyes trail from the visible collarbones, up the naturally tanned skin of his neck and then across his face. His eyes swept across the sleeping figures face, across the eyes he knew were brown with a beautiful whisky shade, long lashes were resting on his cheeks, cute little nose, thick black curls on the top of his head. But the most capturing feature of all was the boy's lips, they were beautiful and soft looking and Steve wondered how they would feel against his own.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bruce snapped his head up and noticed that every eye was on him. He squirmed underneath the gazes and answered.
Some fluff and a bit of protective Bruce!
“Oh Tony” he laughed “did you really think that I'd just let you go like that? I knew that you would resist but it's okay. You will be mine again whether you like it or not And who knows? Maybe someday you'll learn to love it?.”
Steve just chuckled and kissed the top of the geniuses head while said genius frowned up on him. Steve took a second to admire his lover's face with a grin stretching across his face. Tony's hair was all tousled and his plump lips were a lovely shade of red that made Steve want to kiss them all day. His brown doe eyes were wide and looking right into his own blue ones.
Howard just scoffed and straightened his tie.
“Hail HYDRA…”
The team quickly stood up and went to follow the doctor. On their way Steve fell into step with Bucky.
“Hello? Is anyone there? Steve? It's Tony! Please answer me!”
“Steve.” the brunette whimpered out.
Steve's face was starting to burn with embarrassment and tried to remind himself that he was a mob boss, he wasn't supposed to blush like a teenage girl with a crush. He looked down at the brunette and saw that he wasn't faring any better. The team looked at the two with amusement but changed the subject to spare the couple. They had talked for about an hour, catching Tony up on what he had missed since he got kidnapped, when they saw the discomfort spreading on Tony's face.
Tony checked his watch and saw that he had around an hour before he was supposed to meet Ty. Deciding that he didn't need to stress he went to his closet to find an outfit for the evening. He pondered on it for a moment before pulling out a pair of black, skinny jeans and a red V-neck T-shirt along with a pair of briefs. He got dressed and checked himself in the mirror and decided that it was acceptable enough, he grabbed his phone and wallet and made his way back downstairs.
“Oh Edwin!” she exclaimed “That would be wonderful! I haven't seen or heard from the boy in weeks and frankly I have been a tad bit worried. I can make some of my goulash that he loves so much, poor thing have probably not been eating enough, busy with his projects and robots he forgets to take care of himself. I'll make a pie to for the rest of the group as a little thank you for not letting him rot away behind his screens.”
Graphic description of violence!
“Oh thank God! Nat, I don't know where I am, those guys you talked about, HYDRA has me in some kind of facility.”
Five…
RAPE AND VIOLENCE IN THIS CHAPTER!
Steve looked down at the sleeping teen in his arms and felt affection and protectiveness swell in his chest at the sight. Tony just looked so small and vulnerable laying on Steve's massive chest.
Tony patted the robot one last time and made his way to the kitchen where the beautiful smell of coffee was coming from.
The room was so silent that you could hear a pin drop but Natasha was still glaring at the silent Captain. Clint would have laughed at the sight of his big, strong, fearless leader looking like a scolded puppy in front of a woman almost half his size if he didn't know that Natasha would surely kill him for that.
Tesoro- treasure
Tony trailed kisses from the base to the head of Steve's cock before sucking the tip into his mouth. Steve groaned and dragged a hand through Tony's thick hair while trying not to thrust up into Tony's mouth.
“I don't know what to say Tony, I'm sorry and I miss you, I miss us, what we had. I'm wondering if there is a chance that we might be able to get that back?”
Steve stood at the entrance at the room where Tony was staying and couldn't help but let his eyes wander on the smaller boy. He was beautiful, despite the large bruise on his face. He was also quite short, only around 5”8 compared to Stevens own 6"4. Though based on what he had seen back at the apartment the boy had some muscles, must be from working with heavy machines all day.
Bruce gave him a confused look but did as he was told. He pulled over and looked at Tony, waiting for an explanation.
“Oh darling” she said “I am a lady, I never stink.” That brought out a new wave of laughter from the both of them but Tony had to stop soon as the pain in his ribs grew worse. They sat for a while in comfortable silence, just enjoying the presence of each other after so many years apart before Tony asked the question that had bothered him since he was a child.
“Well” he started “how about you and I go and visit Anthony tomorrow to get your mind of off this? I can tell mr Stark that we are visiting your sister to avoid suspicion?” He could help but smile at the joy that broke out on her face.
Clint looked up with satisfaction in his eyes and a grin stretched across his face.
Tony froze and felt fear spread through his entire body. He blinked hard up at the scowling face, hoping that what he was seeing wasn't real. He opened his mouth and cursed himself when he heard his voice break.
Relief flooded through Tony at Maria's words, though all worry would not be gone until he saw them all with his own eyes. He did however feel relieved enough to let out a small giggle of his own and tried not to think about how this was the first time he had truly smiled since he was taken.
Clint leaned over to Tony and whispered in his ear.
“Steve, please!”
“What do you mean?”
“Who are you?”
“I can promise you, mr Rhodes. I will never do anything to hurt Tony and I swear that I will protect and love him with every fiber in my body. And if I ever do anything to hurt him, I give you my full permission to kick my ass to the moon and back.”
Tony woke up to his head pounding and his body aching. He tried to open his eyes to little avail. After a few minutes he managed to pry them open and was met by a blinding light and he blinked while letting out a painful groan. He tried to sit up but fell back after the pain in his ribs became too much.
"I honestly don't know, Tones"
“Ok, Bucky, you help me carry the bags to the car and Steve, you try and get DUM-E. Come on DUM-E, let's go see Tony.”
He turned around to see the team try to stifle laughs and failing miserably. His eyes landed on Clint who avoided his eyes and tried to look innocent. Tony scowled playfully and grabbed some of the flour next to him and threw it on Clint’s face. The sniper blinked and tried to cough out the flour that had ended up in his mouth while using his hands to wipe his face.
Tony had also taken classes online while being on the run and had graduated at the age of seventeen with flying colors.
“Don't tell me you forgot about little old me, now? Come on Tony, for old times sake? You used to be so good at this! Let's see if your time as the captains whore has made you any better.” Tiberius gave a cruel smile before roughly shoving into the younger one's mouth and proceeded to fuck his throat mercilessly.
Steve sighed in relief before sending Tony a message.
Natasha just smirked and went back to her own research.
He turned to the front door where Steve was leaning against the wall with his arms crossed across his chest. When the blonde saw the tears in the younger ones eyes he opened his arms. Tony sped up to and wrapped his arms around Steve's middle while the older one of the two wrapped his arms around Tony.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the bed laid Tony. What was visible of him that wasn't covered by a blanket was instead covered in cuts, bruises and bandages.
When he had finished he looked around at his teammates and saw that they wore a variety of expressions. Some were furious, some heartbroken, some didn't really show much, letting their tense body language speak for them. One thing they all had in common was that they were all out for the blood of those who had hurt their Tony.
“Oh, that nice man Phil came over earlier today while all of you were out. He was looking for Mr Rogers but since he wasn't here we invited him in for a cup of tea. He told us where you had been and about how you had escaped and that they had found a survivor from the explosion. He said that they had him captured and also promised me and Edwin that we could have a go at him if we'd like to. Oh, how is the food everyone? Edwin and I spent the whole day cooking for Anthony's homecoming.”
His self hating thoughts stopped when Steve put his arm on his shoulder and Bruce went to explain.
-------------------------------------------------------------
That earned him a tiny glare from his best friend and he just closed his eyes and rubbed his temple. Clint, who had been quiet for a while spoke up.
“Bruce?”
“What do you mean? You wanted me to stay, remember?”
“Of course Doll.”
“Yes?”
“Steve, I'm sure, I know what I'm doing and I trust you completely. And besides, the doc said that most of my wounds had healed completely except for a few burns and some broken bones, she just said to be careful. Please, let me have this?”
“Y-yeah, great. How about you? It's quite early isn't it?” He replied and mentally smacked himself. Smooth, Tony smooth he thought. The Captain just gave a small smirk and held out a cup of coffee in his direction.
“Yeah shrimp!” Exclaimed Clint from the other couch where he was cleaning his bow “Where are you going? You and Cap gonna go on a date or something?”
“Ty, uh, wh- what are y-you doing h-here?” Tony cursed himself for stuttering and tried to play it off by keeping his head high and not to break eye contact. He looked the larger man over and couldn't help but notice how much he resembled Steve, blue eyes, blonde hair, the way their bodies were built. Tony shook those thoughts out of his head and instead focused on Tiberius who was still staring at him.
Tony let go of Steve and ignored the empty feeling in his hand and instead used both of his arms to push the doctor away slightly.
“Sleep is for the weak!” Was Tony's response but couldn't hold back another yawn.
Tony looked at the clock hanging on the wall and saw that it was only one in the afternoon, the shop usually closes at three. But when Tony asked he only received a glare in response and let it go. He knew better than to get on Nicks bad side.
The team and Pepper and Rhodey were all staring at eachother until Natasha spoke up.
"Thanks Bruce, it means a lot, but you didn't have to, it's really not a big deal." He replied but accepted the small cake anyway.
“Mama?” he asked.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve smiled back and shook his hand before wrapping it around Tony's shoulders.
Steve fell asleep with Tony safely tucked in his arms and DUM-E beeping quietly by their bedside.
Comments and kudos are always appreciated! <3
“Don't worry Bruce, we will be quick and the rest of the team will be here and watch over him. Believe it or not, they are not completely incapable of taking care of injuries.” Assured Bucky.
Everyone froze at that and Bucky managed to let out a little broken “what?”.
“You have no idea watch at you do to me, Tony.”
Short filler chapter! Next one will be better I promise!!
Brock just kept punching and kicking him wherever he could reach before suddenly stopping. Tony spit out the blood in his mouth and looked up at the other man. Brock had an evil grin across his face and the words that came out of his mouth sent dread spreading through Tony's body.
All the comments and kudos made me so happy that I just had to write another chapter <3
“Here they are, I have also managed to track the signal down. I know where he is! It's barely twenty minutes away!”
Distracted by his own thoughts he didn't notice a strange man walking up behind him until the man pushed him against the wall and had a gun pressed against his forehead.
He had adapted rather quickly to the small living place he had now lived in for almost a year after leaving the mansion he grew up in. Tony may have lost his fortune but it was worth it if it meant getting away from his fathers abuse and his mothers neglect. The only thing he did truly miss was the old family butler, Jarvis and his wife Ana that had basically raised him. He made sure to see the two as often as he could without alerting Howard that he was still around so that he would be forced back to that hell hole.
This cannot be possible!” Ana exclaimed as she shot up from the couch she had been sitting on with Edwin beside her. Her husband was now staring at nothing, his face pale and hands shaking at what he had been told. At what had happened and possibly still happening to his precious boy. And especially by whom he had been taken by. He had been working for the Stark’s even before Tony had been born and it was only because of the love he had for the boy that he stayed. He knew exactly how cruel the older Stark could be to his only son and Jarvis had done everything in his power to protect the boy throughout the years. And the fact that it wasn't only Howard who had taken him but Tony's rapist and former partner set fear unlike any other in the old butlers heart. He had comforted Tony many times when he had weeped about Tiberius abandoning him like he was nothing and until this moment he didn't think he could dislike the man any more. And Brock Rumlow… well there isn't really an explanation needed now is there.
“Honestly,” Tony says, “I’m not gonna be able to sleep for a while yet.”
“Get in get in get in get
“Hi, Jarvis,” he says when he notices the driver.
Tony cocks his head. “General G-rated couple stuff? Holding hands. Whispering sweet nothings. Whatever makes it look convincing, but nothing that’ll invade your personal bubble too much.”
Cap nods. “How’re you finding it?”
The rest of the night is pretty uneventful. Steve doesn’t run into Ty again, no one pukes on him, they find a bandage (which is, admittedly, better than band aids would’ve been) in a bathroom and then they call Jarvis to come pick them up.
-ing Rhodey awake, who would moan about it and then resigning himself to getting sucked in after maybe a minute of Tony talking about whatever he’d come up with. Knowing their relationship, Steve suspected that Rhodey would’ve ended up just as excited and awake as Tony was.
“He likes you,” Pepper continues, still stroking Ferdinand, who is now dozing in Pepper’s hand. Tony wants to take a picture. He also wants to avoid this conversation, which feels like stepping on hot Emotion coals, so he goes with misdirection: “Ferdinand?”
Steve puts down his fork. On it is a piece of tomato, a chunky bit that Tony had sliced, and not very consistent with the other tomato chunks, which are all considerably smaller.
“Yeah?”
“What else am I going to do,” he says, “except make sure my friend doesn’t give himself blood poisoning or overwork himself into a coma?”
He heaps them into Steve’s arms - they’re
He tries to say
Tony gives him another unreadable look, which then unfurls into something that Steve thinks looks a little disbelieving, as they come to a stop in front of the gym.
Tony doesn’t say any of this. Instead he rolls his eyes and says, “Hypocrite.”
“Oh, he turned it into an insult.”
“Good,” Tony says. “Actually, I named my chickens-”
“So a smiley face
Steve throws a fork at him. Bucky dodges it and laughs, still with his mouthful of sandwich.
mixed up in it that Tony has to look away.
Steve shakes his head. Ty is walking away anyway.
“Everything,” Steve says. “I see you in class, you don’t do anything, but you always score high on tests. And you correct the teachers sometimes. Everyone says you could be in college already if you wanted, but you’re keeping yourself back. There’s a bunch of rumours about why.”
“I did have to get my English qualifications somewhere along the line,” Tony says dryly. “I do read, I just don’t have much time anymore. If I want to read I have to really carve out a time to do it.”
“Good,” Tony says. “Better than I thought I would, anyway.”
Steve is suddenly very glad he’s not drunker than this. A few more beers and that would’ve definitely earned Ty a punch. As it is, Steve swallows the surge of anger that had risen in his stomach and says, “Wow, Ty. That’s more explicit than you ever get. Unless you get people alone a lot and then intimidate them the way you really want to, which wouldn’t surprise me. You seem like that kind of coward.”
“Have a good time,” Jarvis says to them, but more to Tony. “But not
“Seven,” Tony says.
“That kid’s not going anywhere good,” Fury tells them. “Or, he almost definitely is, but you don’t want to be around him when he gets there. And if I can’t stop him, I want to get him away from my students.”
Steve and Tony trade a look.
Steve puts his face in his hands. “You have a
Steve nods. He pulls the plug from the sink. “I thought so.”
The chick chirps and bobs closer. It darts forwards, grabs the shoot and runs off back to its siblings.
When Tony arrives to Stardew Valley, he spends the first five minutes staring.
He still leaves it until the last minute, waiting until the celebration is over and Tony is in his workshop doing some last-minute things that “no, can’t be delayed even because of a birthday, stop giving me the pinata stick, Clint.”
Tony googles a picture and shows him.
Sarah hums.
Steve figures he wouldn’t tell himself if he was in this position, either.
“I swung by after the press conference,” Tony says. “Just to say hi. Check what SI brought back.”
“Yeah?”
“Thanks,” Steve says as he comes in, after he’s also shaken snow off his jacket. “God, it’s freezing out there. How are you holding up?”
we go. I was waiting for it.”
“News to me. Anyway, she kicked its ass. I’m very proud.”
“In between, though. She lives a whole life after Himmel Street. And Max - he comes back, but we don’t get to see what happens to him at all, other than he comes back. What does he do after that? Do they stay friends?”
Sarah smiles and it cracks into a yawn. “It’ll be fine, alright,” she says on the tail end of it. “Go to school. Maybe tell Tony how you feel, legitimize this whole dating thing.”
“Wow, thanks.”
“Oh, fuck, 1954. Shit.” He looks up at Steve, an incredulous smile tugging on his mouth. It keeps threatening to turn into something else. “Steve.”
“I feel like that’s my line,” he says.
Steve eyes him. “You done anything worth fighting over?”
“So,” he says.
She kisses Steve on the head as she leaves, then she circles back around and kisses Tony on the head like an afterthought.
“Hardheaded,” Tony says. “Yeah. Look, I’m just checking you know what you’re getting into.”
“It wasn’t any trouble,” Tony says, and then when Steve makes a noise, he says, very quietly: “You’re welcome.”
“That’s not - you don’t have anything to make up for.”
“What’re what? Oh, those are just-” Tony waves a hand. “Stuff.”
Steve stares determinedly at his plate, picks up one pea at a time and eats them so he doesn’t have to look up. Ma’s eyeing him. He can tell.
Then the experiment starts, and everything that isn’t pain is shunted from his head.
Tony looks out over the river. The lack of city noises has been a lot to get used to, but he thinks he might be getting the hang of it.
Steve gives him another look. It starts off exasperated, but quickly turns heavier and sadder in a way that Tony has to look away from, because it’s not just about Obie, it’s about everything Tony isn’t Fine over. There’s an understanding there, a deep kind that says
Steve swallows. Did he-? No. Surely not.
Steve thinks about it. Then he thinks about that thing his therapist had said about self-isolating. Damn her for making so many good points.
“It got made into this awful movie with Will Smith,” Tony says. “I’ve never forgiven him for it. Oh, right, about
Steve moves before Tony can tell him to.
“It’s beautiful,” Tony says. He touches the edge of the roof. “It’s - god. Thank you, Steve.”
The rest of the walk around the art gallery, Steve feels like every look he gives Tony is a furtive one, a look that’s maybe not allowed, and whenever Tony catches him looking, a thrill zips up his spine.
which he blazes through and then picks up the biggest collection of James Baldwin essays that he can find.
Oh thank god. “Yeah. He’s coping as well as anyone can, I think.”
“What you’re saying makes no sense.”
“You’ve gotta stop punching people.”
Tony lowers his glass. What contacts does Steve have with SHIELD, and how fucking tuned in were they?
“Something like that,” Steve says.
“Thanks,” he says to the driver, who gives him a prim smile with more warmth in it than Steve expects.
“With you, I wouldn’t be surprised if it did.”
,” Ty says, “I’m so sorry, I didn’t see you!”
“This seems like the kind of thing that can wait,” Pepper says.
Steve is at the bottom of the steps leading down to the workshop. Tony can see him through the glass - he’s not at the door but he’s looking like he had been heading towards it not long ago. He’s wavering, looking at Tony like he wants to make sure he’s okay to leave.
Tony grins. He hides it, like he’d tried to cover the laugh, but he can’t twist his lips into anything other than a smile. It’s strangely gratifying, but Steve doesn’t let that go to his head. So he can make Tony Stark grin - so what?
There’s silence for a while, apart from the soft clucking of chickens that Tony is way too endeared by.
Steve tapped at the book. “Elvish. And other languages. He designed an alphabet, dialects-”
Pepper doesn’t look worried, but she does send a look up at JARVIS like she usually does when she talks with him, like she’s suddenly relieved the house has an AI surveilling the place.
Tony snaps back from where he’s been staring into the distance. “What?”
“I know what silkies are, Pepper, I’m friends with Thor. He has a lot of Opinions on chicken breeds. I’m thinking about it.”
Steve frowns. “You sure? I thought you were going to compliment my dick again.”
Yeah, Tony’s definitely being flirted with. He doesn’t try the ‘arm over the shoulder yawning trick’, but it’s a close call.
“Yeah, yeah.” Bucky pats her knee. “You’re a secretly trained government agent. Or a. I don’t know, who else gets training into reading people?”
Tony doesn’t seem convinced, but he lets Steve give him a blanket and thanks him for the glass of water (and mixing bowl, for puking) Steve places next to the couch.
“That’s great,” Steve says. “We’re glad to have you in Stardew.”
Tony ducks his head. “Sounds nice.”
Tony turns, opening his mouth to say something probably more snappy than deserved, but then gets distracted. If Tony put ‘hot farmer guy’ into a porn search engine, this man’s picture would show up. He’s big and muscled, but not in a bulky, intimidating way. Actually, not much about the guy is intimidating. He’s got a kind face and is standing like he knows exactly how big he is and doesn’t want to scare anyone off with his largeness. He’s carrying a blank canvas under one arm, along with a tin container of what Tony assumes are paints.
“It’s fine,” Steve says.
“I know he doesn’t like that!”
They step back to admire their work.
Tony can relate.
“Well, cut it out. Get to class.”
“Shit,” Tony says, quiet enough that no one without superhearing could hear it. He thinks about shoving Steve into the nearest room and acting casual. He has a bizarre moment where he seriously considers shoving Steve against the wall and making out with him as a distraction that Obie will walk away from, but he disregards that just as Obie turns down the hall.
“Steve,” Obie says. “How’re you?”
, he says, because it’s easier than saying
Tony’s face goes soft and then straightens out again.
“Give me a yell if you need anything,” Steve says.
Tony’s giggles peter off. He looks into his juice some more.
He reads some new poetry by Auden, which he finds copies of in a bombed-out house one day, miraculously in English. Another soldier must’ve left it there, Steve reasons. He reads the poems when he’s alone and tries determinedly not to think of Peggy when he gets to the love poems, but sometimes he gives in.
“As always,” Obie says. He laughs. Keeps his hand on Tony’s shoulder. “So how did you two meet? Steve, when I got to meet you at SHIELD, you mentioned that you hadn’t gotten the chance to meet Tony yet.”
“Thanks,” Steve says. His knife scrapes gently against his plate and Tony winces.
They’re talking about Picasso and something about realism when Obie comes in.
Tony either doesn’t notice the staring or he doesn’t care. Steve figures he’s probably used to it by now, being
The work is slow, but Tony throws himself into it, which means it gets done. Doesn’t matter what the work is - as long as Tony dedicates himself to it, it always gets done. Even if the work is hauling fertilizer (which he gets from a shop in town, as well as an explanation of what the fertilizer is good for and exactly how to use it) to his new crops, which is an adventure in itself. Tony can’t help but be excited when he finishes planting, even if all that’s in front of him is a large patch of freshly patted-down dirt.
“Well,” Steve says. “We’ll be glad to have you there.”
Tony bobs his head. “Fine. That’s fine.”
likes poetry,” Steve says, lowering his voice for it.
“Hi,” Tony says.
“Shit,” he says. “So he’s - is he still the same
Steve can’t think of a way to communicate
Tony twisted to glare at Rhodey. “You
“How many times have you flown this thing, anyway?”
“Might want to stand back,” he says. “JARVIS, commence operation Badass.”
Tony doesn’t answer, and then he opens his mouth.
“What’s to think about?”
Tony asks if there’s anything he missed while he was away -
Oh god, Cap has
,” Tony asks.
“Let me know if I can help,” Steve says.
“Just this kind of stuff,” Bucky says. He runs a finger down the pages. “Frodo seems cool.”
She takes a look at them and her face brightens cautiously. “You two look cozy.”
“Uh. Now, I guess. That’s how it’s worked before.”
“City food?”
“Yeah, you-” Steve swallows. “You too. Are allowed.”
He knocked on Steve’s front door and fought the urge to juggle the dish from hand to hand. Even through the dishtowel it was still hot enough to be uncomfortable.
Steve stews in guilt for the rest of the day.
“Get him out of here,” Mr. Stark says, and Tony nods jerkily.
“Sorry,” Tony mumbles as he walks Steve to the door. “I’ll get Jarvis to drive you home-”
“I don’t know.” Steve thinks about telling her about last night; Tony coming to him drunk, Tony kissing him, Tony’s hands on his waist -
“Sure,” Steve says. He takes off his jacket and puts it over a nearby chair, then sits down near the fire.
“Uh. I don’t know, it might’ve been - he changed it because of the war - uh, ‘45?”
“‘Course.” Steve is glad he’s already been sweating. It’d be embarrassing if sweat started showing up out of the blue. “It’s a bit of a step up from
“Only a little,” Tony says. “I’m a little worried that I’ll name them and he’ll resent me for naming them wrong.”
Fury waves his free hand. “I get you. He tried to pull the victim card, shockingly, but I’ve heard enough about Ty’s antics to know that he absolutely deserved it.”
Steve gives him a look.
“Well,” Steve says. “I, for one, am glad you did that first.”
“This is very unlike you,” he tells her.
Tony tries not to think about it. But if Obie got him kidnapped, if he’s trying to wrench the company out from under him - that means Rhodey could do something like that, too. It’s crazy, but Tony used to think that Obie would never hurt him, either.
Steve leans back a little. “
“Yeah?”
“They do,” Natasha says. “But this sounds like a different issue.”
“Watch your step,” Steve tells Tony as they start on the rickety stairs of the building. “Lotta people fall down these.”
“Pablo Neruda was an asshole,” Tony says.
It was an inside joke.”
“Come with me,” Tony says.
“Look at my lunch, Rhodey! Look at it. What is this meat? Lamb? Pork? Mankind doesn’t
Tony pauses, then he gives Steve a look that he doesn’t quite know what to do with.
“Your secret is safe with me,” Steve assures him.
okay,” Tony says, and waits for Steve to laugh and nod before scrawling a smiley face onto the stuffed pillowcase. He adds some angry eyebrows for good measure.
“Right,” Steve says. “Okay. So, here’s the thing.”
“You deserve better,” Steve says.
“You’re obviously going through a lot.”
the nerd,” Tony says under his breath.
“He saw me peeing.”
Tony waves. “Hey. So, you’re Cap.”
“But it means a lot. I can’t-” Steve wavers over the book, pressing down on the cover. “
Steve gets the feeling this is a run-of-the-mill thing in his job.
she tells him, and tweaks his hair.
“Happy birthday, Steve,” he says instead.
“When’d he do that?”
Steve tears through the book in two days. It’s partly because he doesn’t have much to do, and partly because - well, he wants to talk to Tony about it. Sometimes when they get the time they’ll talk about
“This was my plan all along, by the way,” Tony says when they pull apart. “Lure you in with your progeny. Had this all lined up when I named him. You should hear the rest of my cunning plan.”
“I can be convincing.”
Tony stares. That’s shocking enough, and it would be enough to rock him without Rhodey continuing with, “He’s alive.”
Steve frowns. “Not at a Pablo level.”
Clint says something else, but it’s illegible through the waffle and Steve doesn’t put much effort into figuring it out.
“So you named the chickens,” Bucky asks from across the table.
Tony wonders what the guy’s been doing with his time, other than beating gym bags to pulps. Does he read? Watch sitcoms? Do crossword puzzles and lament his tragic lot in life?
Tony nods, slides into the seat next to him. “You know Ty?”
“No problem,” Steve says. Bastard has barely broken a sweat.
“Whaaat’s going on,” Sam says. “Something’s happening.”
Sarah hums, eyeing the bowl, but she doesn’t bring it up. “So, you’ll never guess what I heard at work last night.”
Steve waits.
“Don’t worry about it!” Tony rocks back and forth on his feet. “This really - it wasn’t
All of that is so easy it’s worrying. And because it’s worrying, Steve does his absolute damndest not to think about it.
He pictures the apartment they’re heading towards, the small rooms and the thin walls and the shabby furniture. None of their dishes match. None of their
Tony does jazz hands. It’s not his proudest moment. “And I’m fine now! Look at me! Hap, I’m just - I’m going to go talk to someone. It’ll take five minutes.”
,” Steve says, “but it won’t be a sweet nothing.”
“Chickens don’t understand gender roles, Rhodey. Get with the times.”
His foot throbs and Steve winces. First thing’s first. He can stress out over kissing later.
AF guy shakes his head. “Nope. These are safe. There’s a lot of stuff around here if you know where to look.”
talk to me like that,” Mr. Stark barks back, and Steve’s fists curl reflexively.
“Yeah?”
“Thanks,” he says, and shakes Happy’s hand. “Good to meet you.”
“It’s his
“I did say I’d get better at it,” he says. “And you’re not so bad yourself. Earlier, when you were zoning out because you were staring at me? That looked really real.”
Clint emerges from his hoodie. “We should do a movie night,” he says, his voice rough even as it tries to be light.
Tony sends Pepper and Rhodey frequent updates and is relieved to hear their twin confusion at the town’s generosity. At least it’s not just him who’s confused.
- and is in the middle of a sigh when someone says, “New here, huh?”
Tony orders a reinforced punching bag to be sent to Steve’s apartment. He doesn’t think much of it, and then gets back to the repulsors.
“Decided to start filling up my shelves properly,” he continues.
“Brunch has different foods.”
Steve and Tony both stare at him, then at each other.
“Hi,” Steve says when Tony opens the door. “I hoped we could talk. If you’re not up to it right now, that’s fine.”
“Steve’s in a scheme,” Natasha says quietly.
“Well,” she says. She spears a piece of chicken. “That’s a shame. You two were good together, even if it was fake.”
“Sure,” Steve says, in a tone that implies it really isn’t. “Well, if you have any trouble, everyone here is happy to help. I’m just another ten minutes down the road in the house by the impossibly big oak tree, if you have any questions. I haven’t run a farm in a while, but I still know my way around. What are you need done?”
“I’m positive.”
He shifts the canvas under his arm, almost self-consciously.
Their lips touch, first gently, and at first it’s not much of anything. It’s a mouth against Steve’s mouth, like a hand against his hand, and Tony tastes like vodka, and there are no fireworks at all. Steve is vaguely disappointed, and a little panicked because
He chins himself on the edge of his glass, which he’s propping up in his hand. He looks at Steve. Steve looks right back at him.
“Let me know where I should go,” is all Jarvis says.
“You want me to fake date you,” Steve says.
“Great.” Tony beams, then leans down and kisses Steve on the cheek. “Bye, honeybunch.”
They don’t have much money to spend on luxuries like books, so Steve ends up reading the same ones over and over until he has a birthday, then he reads the new book - or books, if he’s lucky - until he can recite them by heart. He keeps them in the best condition he can, he falls asleep reading them to the point that his Ma teases him about it:
“I think your understanding of groping is misguided.”
“Gotta ease you into it,” Steve says. “If you’ve only ever rinsed things before.”
Steve considers. Again, there’s a
Steve brings him out a glass of lemonade and Tony takes it, drinking deeply. The weather is cooler now, no more July scorchers, but it’s still hot.
“I shouldn’t have brought it up,” Steve says after a few seconds of silence. “I know you don’t like talking about-”
“You read them a lot?”
Obie says that Cap might be an asset.
“Might happen.”
Tony hesitates. Even bringing Steve down here feels like a massive risk, he doesn’t want to break down the suit’s secrets.
Sam cracks his eyes open long enough to give Steve a look that clearly says
“Alright,” Sarah says. “Let me know if that changes.”
Sam makes a warning noise just as Ty knocks hard enough into Steve to send him sprawling onto the floor.
“How were things when you got back home,” Steve asks. “After you stayed here, I mean.”
Tony gets that bouncy, no-I’m-not-bouncing-what-are-you-talking-about stance again. He folds his arms like that’ll keep it in. “You’re reading it?”
He works on the suit. This doesn’t take up most of his time, but it’s at the back of his head the rest of the time - when he’s drawing up other plans, he’ll be distantly thinking of the left gauntlet, the fine-tuning of the torso plates, how it’ll all fit together. It feels purer than anything else, pure in a way that burns through him, incinerating anything that isn’t his
Tony pauses. “Do I what?”
. She’s my
“We can both be a little… hardheaded.”
Tony’s eyes widen. “You - huh. Okay, do you-”
It’s weird. Tony is more polite to Sarah than he’s seen Tony be to anyone, even when he stops being all stiff about it. Steve watches, mistified, as Tony gets flustered from Sarah telling him he seems like a very smart young man. Who is this guy?
“Well,” he says. “Good to have you back with us, C - Steve.”
When Steve goes into the lounge the next morning, Tony is gone. The blanket is folded on the couch and the mixing bowl is on top of it. It’s clean, thank god.
Tony asks, “All your speeches, were they from the heart?”
It comes like a flood: the soldiers in the convoy with him, the kid holding up a peace sign before the world blows to pieces. Pinpricks of painful light. The deafening stutter of gunshots as men and women in uniforms grab guns, as Tony tries to grab a gun but it’s jammed and everything is happening too fast. Yinsen bleeding out with multiple gunshots in his chest -
“Arthurian legends, huh,” Steve asks.
“I don’t think I will,” Ty says, all moderated calm. Steve wants to shake it out of him.
, for god’s sake.
“You’re right here,” Tony continues, and Steve has to look away, close his eyes for a moment. The
“So Tony might be coming to sit with us,” Steve announces as he sits down at his usual lunch table. “Or something. Details were unclear.”
“They were still looking?”
Bruce nods. He rubs his thumbs against his empty cup. “He was awful.”
It’s not something he wants to do. He tries everything to subdue rather than kill, but in the end Obie is weak and finished and reaching out a hand and saying
Sam makes a face which quickly smooths out. “Shit, you haven’t - not even the movies?”
“Not right now,” Steve says. Then, “Actually.”
Ty laughs, louder this time. Steve watches the crowd, which is patchy as people slow and then just stand there, waiting. Ty has never gotten into a fistfight, but Steve used to be notorious for them, and there’s not a student here that doesn’t want to see Ty get punched.
“And?”
“No. Why?”
Steve gets in the backseat next to Tony.
“That’s ridiculous,” Steve says weakly. He drops his hands. “Tony, what even-”
, but stops. He pulls out his phone and looks over the co-ordinates he’d found as he was hacking into some databases that shouldn’t have been so hard to get into.
“That’s me,” Tony says. “Nice guy.”
This birthday is more than he ever would’ve hoped for as a kid - he gets a cake, for one. With real butter and milk and the icing all fancy, which he knows isn’t that rare nowadays, but still. It lights up a small part inside him that still expects small gifts wrapped in newspaper.
“What?”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. He still doesn’t open his eyes.
Cap puts down his coffee, and for the first time Tony realizes how fucking
“Not out of the woods yet,” Ma says, after a long, arduous swallow.
Steve stares at him, but only for a second.
From the other couch, where he has disappeared into his hoodie, Clint says, muffled: “Are you two nerds quoting
Sarah hands him a capsicum and an onion, then gives Tony a knife, and when Steve finishes cracking eggs he watches Tony chop vegetables next to his Ma, who is chopping mushrooms, and realizes that Tony probably hasn’t had to cook anything in his life. He holds a knife like it might leap up and bite him. When he dumps his veggies into the eggs mixture, Tony’s vegetables are wildly uneven next to Sarah’s mushrooms.
, there’s this other really cool personification of Death in Terry Prachett books that you might like-”
He takes a gulp of scotch and tilts the glass towards Steve. “Want some? Got a really good vintage somewhere around here-”
to do this.”
“So he’s really been bothering you,” he says instead.
Silence falls over the table.
Sarah acts normally when Tony comes over, but Steve can tell she has Opinions. He’d been able to tell this earlier, when she’d come home and he’d told her that 1) he’d been suspended, 2) Tony and he ended their fake relationship and 3) Tony was coming over for dinner.
“Anything happen with Obie,” Rhodey asks.
“How do you think Lisel’s life ended up,” Tony asks.
“J, we’re dropping these guys home,” Tony tells Jarvis as he slides into the backseat.
“You okay,” Steve asks.
Sarah rubs Tony’s shoulder. “Oh, that’s so nice of you.”
,” Steve says. “We figured that you’d tell us when you were ready - but I assumed that down the line someone must’ve mentioned that we knew. We didn’t exactly try to hide it.”
“There you are! I-”
“Yeah,” Steve says. “That ticket the bus driver gave you, you can use that as a transfer.”
“Fine by me,” Sarah says. “I’m making enough for leftovers, though, so let me know if anyone’s plans change.”
After dinner, Sarah gets up and announces she’s going for a walk. She says this like it’s a normal thing for her to do, instead of something Steve’s never seen her do before, and she ignores every questioning look he shoots her as she pulls her jacket on and says she expects the dishes to be done by the time she gets back.
“You don’t have to.”
“I actually have a debate club meeting to get to,” Sam says after twenty seconds of this. “So if you wanna-”
Rhodey starts, “Steve’s fine, Pepper’s with five agents that are about to arrest Obadiah-”
“Schemes,” Natasha says.
It’s a pretty silent twenty minutes to their next stop, and then Steve nudges for Tony to get up.
fine, but he’s his brand new version of fine that might involve more sharp edges than his old version, so there’s no reason for Rhodey to coddle him like this.
Steve nods. Tony nods back, fast and jerky, and then his gaze drops to the page.
was dumb. I just - he made me feel like I was. Uh.”
Tony leans sideways, bumps their arms together. “I don’t know,” he says. “Actually, I was hoping you’d help me figure that out. Also, unrelated note: you know that homosexuality is legal now, right? You’ve run across it on your Googling, I know you Google, JARVIS told me-”
“Five.”
“Yeah!” Steve’s shaking with it, the laughter and probably the cold and the same nerves that Tony is shaking with inside the suit.
Tony kneels down next to it with his tools.
Steve visits once a day and sits around as he and Tony talk about James Baldwin or a scifi novel one or both of them read as a kid, and sometimes poetry, during which Steve determinedly doesn’t bring up Pablo Neruda.
“Come on! You have
“Good to hear,” he says eventually. “He went through a lot. Re-acclimating to society's gonna be hard.”
“You know he has superhearing, right,” Tony says.
Tony winces as Steve touches it. “Come on, let’s get you a bandage.”
“Okay,” is all Bruce ends up saying. “Good luck with that.”
“Actually,” Tony says. “I made time.”
“No thanks,” he says, and looks back down at his algebra worksheet. He’s supposed to have answered ten questions, he has five completed and the class starts in two minutes. He doesn’t have time for whatever shenanigans Tony is involved in this week.
weird,” Steve says. “Also, the most depressing compliment I’ve ever gotten. The first time someone sees my dick, says it’s nice, and it’s
“I’m glad you like it,” Steve says. His shoulders are hunched, but his smile is genuine.
Steve considers. He usually doesn’t go to Hammer parties either, content to hear about them on Natasha’s snapchat story, but -
“All longing,” Natasha says, dropping her head onto Bucky’s shoulder.
Tony keeps quiet.
His face changes. Tony’s been recognized before, more times than he can remember, but this is the first time it makes Tony’s throat go tight.
That doesn’t stop the others from bringing it up, though.
He doesn’t expect a reply, and it doesn’t come for a while. Tony is finally heading up to bed 12 hours later, stumbling with weariness, when the text comes in.
“Sounds good to me,” he says. “Want to sleep in?”
“Well,
Steve nods. In the background, the jug is almost finished boiling.
In the moment, though, it was - it just felt
Tony nods. Squeezes Steve’s shoulder again, then drops his hand. After a few seconds, he says, “I’ve been thinking about doing another re-read. I always think about books differently if I re-read them every eight years or whatever. All this new context-”
Tony nods. “Where’s the-”
“You brought me
“Dishes,” Steve says to the closed door. He turns to Tony, who is staring at the door in confusion, his hand on his hair at the spot where Sarah kissed.
His graze tracks over Steve’s face, eyebrows furrowed. He breathes in like he’s about to say something, then stops. Then he leans in and kisses Steve, soft enough that Steve thinks faintly of blessings; and then firmer, opening his mouth, at which point Steve doesn’t think of much at all.
Tony was panicking. His ass felt like it was being torn apart but more so. He couldn't breath. His heart was pounding in his chest and black spots were filling his vision from the lack of oxygen.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steve was licking, sucking and scraping his teeth gently on Tony's hole, trying to drag out as many of those beautiful moans as possible from the younger man. He smiled when a particularly loud one emerged from his lover when he dipped his tongue in the hole. He kept twirling it around until Tony was shaking with pleasure under him and he reluctantly removed himself.
“DAMN IT! DAMN IT ALL TO HELL!!”
It was what she saw made her heart twist in her chest.
“Dude, stop staring, you look like you are about to devour him and you know Bruce will kill you if you try anything.”
“Greetings my friends!!” Came Thor’s booming voice as he marched into the room with Natasha walking calmly behind the gentle giant. Both men jumped apart and started to blush madly.
“When did you stop loving Howard?”
“Anthony, oh bambino I'm so sorry! What have they done to you my poor baby boy!?” she cried out while her hands cupped Tony's cheeks and looked over his face.
Merry (late) Christmas (and happy Hanukkah to you who celebrate it! :) ) and a Happy (late) New Year!
They made their way past the living room where the rest of the team were chilling and made their way upstairs. Steve went into his room and motioned for Tony to follow him and flopped down on the bed. The younger of the two walked slowly into the room and looked around. It looked a lot like his own with nice beige walls, a large closet next to a window. A fairly large desk in front of a queen sized bed and next to it was a door that lead to a bathroom.
Came Steve's angry voice.
After catching his breath he slowly pulled out which earned him a wince from the genius and took a few seconds to admire the state of his victim.
Everyone had stopped what they were doing and looked at her. She in return looked at each one of them.
“Hey, Bruce, I can take Tony to his room, you told me that you needed to finish up your project right?”
Tony's choice was made for him when three knocks were heard from the door.
“Call me Rhodey.”
Tony learned that Steve had been in the army with Bucky for a few years until there had been an explosion which had cost Bucky his arm and they both were honorably discharged.
“Everyone here thinks it's their fault for what happened to Tony. You probably think that you should have protected him better, Bruce thinks it's his fault for dragging Tony into this whole mess, Clint thinks that he should have kept a closer eye on the kid. And everyone else is blaming themselves for not staying behind and watching over him. Tony is probably also gonna blame himself when he wakes up for have gone out when we weren't with him.”
After a while he was fully seated and they were both breathing heavily.
“I must say Anthony, I'm impressed. You managed to take both Rumlow and several of my agents down without a scratch and in your, well, state besides. Though I am wondering, what are you planning on doing now?”
“I love you too, Doll. So very much.”
“Clint. Who is the survivor?”
Steve thanked her with a smile and told her to give them to Bucky before he lead Tony out of the cafe and into the car. They drove home in silence with the team in the cars behind them. Tony kept looking out the window like he expected Howard to be there. Steve took his trembling hand and held it tightly and Tony gave him a grateful smile.
“I said, stop the car.”
Worst of all was the water boarding. The feeling of ice cold water hitting him in the face, feeling like his lungs were on fire because of the lack of oxygen while he was pressed down in the water only to be pulled up just when he was about to pass out and to repeat the process, over and over and over again.

“Tomorrow morning, dear. I'm sorry, but I must go now as I was just supposed to retrieve your father's notes and I have been gone for too long, but I just had to see you for myself. Just to make sure that you were truly here. But don't worry, soon you will be free and I promise you, you will never have to see that awful man ever again, mark my words.” she hurried.
“What?” Came a small whisper from the bedroom.
“He was asking you about me. He went after you because of your relation to us.”
“Yeah, I've  just missed them so much and now they have to leave. I know I'm being dramatic, but, I just want them here with me.”
“I had some time off.”
“Alright Liebling, get back to work, I don't pay you to flirt with my clients.” Erik said teasingly while still holding Charles close to him by his arm around the brunettes hip.
Tony stood frozen, his eyes staring straight at the barrel of a gun three inches from his face. When he looked up at the person holding the gun he saw a beautiful redheaded woman with a stony expression on her face. It felt like her sharp green eyes were looking right into his soul and after what felt like an hour but was actually a few mere seconds a voice spoke up.
“Never, sweetheart, never.”
Tony caught himself staring and turned his head back to Bruce with a faint blush creeping up his tan neck. He cleared his throat and spoke.
“Tony, listen to me. I promise that I wouldn't do this if I had any other choice, but I promised to protect you and that's what I'm doing. You are not safe there anymore! And you don't have to worry about your job, we spoke to Fury. And we brought everything you needed here. Your tools, your laptop, your inventions and even DUM-E. Everything is in your room I swear.”
“Why don't we do something about that then?” Came Tony's panting response. The panting was soon turned into a shriek as Steve lifted him up by his ass. Steve chuckled in his ear and started to carry him up the stairs and to their room. It took a while for them to reach the room since Steve stopped once in awhile to push Tony against a wall and kiss him senseless and rub their hard on’s against each other.
With that he nodded at the two men who were still standing by the door and walked out of the room, door locking behind him.
“It wasn't your fault, Cap. It was nobody's fault but HYDRA’s. Rumlow did this to me, not you. Okay? I love you, I love you…”
“So!?” Bucky exclaimed causing Steve's hands to leave his face, showing deep bags under his eyes and he noticed that the rest of the the people in the room were in a similar state, even Natasha who always managed to look to close to perfection to be human, showed signs of exhaustion. “Who were you talking to? Never mind, I don't care, did they have any useful information? Anything remotely helpful?” Steve smiled for the first time since his fight with Tony at his best friends words.
“Can you track his signal?”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Well, it's kind of a long story. I met him over a year ago at a silence convention where he was presenting his robot-” “A robot?!” “Shut up Clint.”
“Goodnight Edwin.”
“Tony, you know that you don't have to force yourself into anything because you think it'll please me, right?”
“Ah! Mister Stark! I'm very glad to see you awake, you have been out for quite some time and we were getting worried.”
“I think they should know but I don't think I can tell that story again.”
Steve looked up startled at the other man.
“Thanks Cap.”
Natasha gave a small smile while she petted her boyfriend's hair.
Steve looked towards Bruce who stood awkwardly by the car and the scientist sent him a small wave.
Just before he was about to pass out Tiberius pulled out and jerked himself off until he was coming all over Tony's face and chest.
We can't always protect him, no matter how much we try, but that doesn't mean we won't try our best.
When Tony reached out to grab a shirt from his drawer his face was suddenly covered in fabric. The removed it from his face and saw that Steve had tossed him one of his own navy blue V neck T-Shirt. The blonde wore a little smirk and raised an eyebrow at Tony's direction.
"I'm gonna have to close up early today so you can head home now"
Bruce just smiled. "Anyway, I'm gonna go off to bed, I'll see you tomorrow?"
Oh, how that was about to change.
He cut himself off for a second and took a deep breath before continuing.
Steve still kept his hold on Tony while he settled down on the bed and pulled his darling close to him while whispering reassuringly. After a few minutes Tony had calmed down and Steve loosened his grip a little bit so that he could meet Tony's eyes. Steve's heart broke at the sight of Tony's bruised face now covered in tears and his eyes bloodshot. He cupped the brunette’s face with both hands and wipes away his tears and then pressing a kiss to his forehead before re wrapping his arms around Tony, cautious of his injuries.
Tony looked around the room and saw that everyone was giving him small, encouraging smiles and felt Steve slightly squeezing his shoulder and he couldn't help but to smile back before yawned.
“Yes?”
Tony beamed and put the drawing down before joining Steve on the bed and cuddling closer to him. Steve in return wrapped his own arms protectively around the teen. They spent the whole afternoon like that, just talking, getting to know each other, exchanging small kisses and just enjoying each others company until Thor came knocking, letting them know that dinner was ready.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Meanwhile, Tony was lying on his side, body curled up in a ball, and sobbing after the days agony. He wasn't sure how long time had passed since he was taken, he had nothing to help him tell the time, but he was sure that it had at least been a few days.
Tony just glared at him and turned around and headed towards their bedroom.
“I swear I'll never let you out of my sight again.” Tony just chuckled at that but buried his head further into Steve's neck.
Steve was running through the maze that was the Stark mansion with Bucky and Bruce on either side of him, shooting down enemies left and right, leaving a trail of bloody corpses after them them.
“Hey, take it easy, you are pretty banged up, you gotta be careful for awhile.” Came a deep voice from his right.
“You want me to tell them?”
Was his response before going out the door and shouting that his “mighty friend is in distress and requires assistance!”
Tony's smirk widened and he circled his hips down harder on the other man.
WARNING! SLIGHT REFERENCE TO VIOLENCE AND RAPE, NOT GRAPHIC THOUGH!
“What? Why not?”
Mr and Mrs. Jarvis just chuckled and lead them to the dining room where that had prepared enough food to feed an army. Everyone sat down and Steve lifted Tony out of his wheelchair and settled him on a normal one in between himself and Jarvis. He took Tony's plate and started to put food on it before filling his own when they had gotten the clear sign from Ana that they could start.
“I think so? It should probably be no problem.”
Of course, Tony thought, why would anyone wanna hire him just for him? He is worthless and stupid, just like Howard always told him.
Well, here is some fluff and angst. Kind of all I have to say about this chapter XD
“And left their home unsupervised?” Ana replied skeptically.
When he was about halfway there he got an uneasy feeling in his stomach but figured that he was just probably being paranoid. When he was about a block away from the small grocery shop an object was thrown a couple of feet in front of him. He immediately recognized it as a grenade and quickly backed away and was just about to turn around, the weapon blowed up sending him flying back.
‘One minute and two seconds left…’
Steve smiled down at the sleepy genius and picked up the shirt he had been wearing and used it to clean the drying cum of the both of them, careful with Tony's hole since he had been quite rough which showed when Tony winced a bit at the contact. When he finished, Steve tossed the shirt on the floor. He then settled behind Tony and spooned them while kissing the back of his neck. They soon fell asleep and only woke up when Clint stepped into their room unannounced and proceeded to scream like a twelve year old at the sight of the two of them naked. Needless to say, he cried in Natasha's arms for the rest of the night. Natasha was not amused.
“Well that can't be it, one of his spies must have seen you with him before, us coming over must have confirmed that he has some kind of relation to us.” Suggested Steve with a frown.
He started of by fixing the engine for a beautiful black 1967 Chevy Impala, he was so concentrated on his tasks that he didn't notice the hours flying by and suddenly Fury was shaking his shoulder.
“It's just a little bit pain buddy. The painkillers are starting to wear off.”
“Don't! Ever! Touch! Him! Again!”
Just as they drove away a man stepped out of the shadows.
He got to know that Natasha had been born and raised in Russia, despite her flawless English. She had also taught him some basic self defense moves, the woman was scarily good with hand to hand combat.
“It's not your fault, Cap. I swear, I don't blame you. I blame that asshole that attacked me.”
He ran as fast as he could, the adrenaline kept him going.
“The prisoner has escaped, Rumlow is down! I repeat the prisoner has escaped and Rumlow is down!”
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Tony felt hot stripes of come coating his insides and he gave another little moan at the feeling.
“Just. Fucking. Sit. Still!!!”
“Thank God you're okay baby, thank God.” He mumbled into Tony's skin. He reluctantly removed his face to look into the brunettes eyes before pressing their lips together, sighing at the familiar taste of Tony's lips mixed with a bit of blood.
“I don't know, he just said that he wanted to apologize over a coffee and I agreed to meet him.” Steve's eyes hardened when he answered.
After taking some deep breaths like Steve said and trying up failing to fight the blush that spread across his cheeks at the nickname, Tony calmed down again.
After about an hour and three cups of coffee later Tony felt like his bladder was about to explode so he excused himself and headed to the toilets.
Tony was panting by the time they had reached the garage but kept going, knowing that Steve was in the building looking for him. He looked up at Howard who was sweating, panic in his eyes and looking for the keys in his pockets. Knowing he was distracted Tony seized the moment and kneed his father in the crotch and bolting through the door they came from and ran to the main hall. Before he could get any further his father grabbed the back of his shirt and threw him to the floor. In Tony's weakened state he hadn't managed to run as fast as he had hoped which had given Howard the time he needed to recover and chase after the boy. The older Stark pulled his gun out and aimed it at Tony while dragging the boy up by his hair.
Then he stepped out of his boyfriends embrace and headed back over to Pepper and Rhodey's sides. He threw his right arm over Peppers shoulders and his left was wrapped around Rhodey’s waist since he couldn't reach the other man's shoulders. Tony smiled at his confused team and started to explain.
“Hey, hey, calm down, calm down. It's just me, you're safe now Tony, I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you, I promise.” Came Steve’s gentle but firm voice. Tony's eyes found his and he started to calm down. Large arms wrapped themselves around him protectively and he was pulled into a strong chest. They sat like that for a few minutes before Tony's breathing had gone back to normal. Tony cleared his throat and and opened his mouth.
(I know next to nothing about medical things so a lot of things in this chapter might be inaccurate, just FYI)
Ana just cupped his face and looked into his eyes.
“It's good to have you back Tones.” The doctor mumbled into his friends ear.
Doctor Cho led them to a room down some hallways away and opened the door. There was a bed in the middle of the white room against one of the walls.
“Why? Are you jealous? I'm still going Steve whether you like it or not.”
Steve just rolled his eyes and stood up. He went and made himself and Tony a couple of sandwiches and coffee and put them in front of the genius. Everyone ate and small talked for about an hour until Steve spoke up.
“What? I like it when you wear my clothes.”
Bucky looked down guiltily and didn't say anything more.
“You must be Tiberius.” Steve deadpanned with a frighteningly calm voice and an unimpressed expression on his face, though his eyes could not hide the fury inside him “I thought you would be, well, more?”
After another couple of minutes Brock moaned loudly while pushing himself as hard as he could into the teen while emptying himself inside of Tony.
“Naw, Honeybear!” Tony said while leaning into his friend’s side.
When Steve felt his orgasm build up he grabbed Tony's erection and started to pump in the rhythm of the thrusts. Soon Tony was cumming on both their chests and stomachs and Steve was shooting his load into Tony's ass. When their heartbeats had slowed down and they were breathing normally again they looked at each other and smiled warmly. They shared a sweet kiss before Tony pulled off with a wince and settled on the bed.
Sam throws a pillow at him. Bucky catches it in mid-air and lobs it back onto the couch. Steve notes that he somehow finds the maturity not to throw it back in Sam’s face.
“I’m Happy Hogan,” Happy says, holding out a hand. “It’s an honour to meet you, Sir.”
“Read it? No.”
He holds out a hand and she pours a small mountain of M&Ms into it.
“What?” Steve gestures at the screen. “We’re not getting enough of her now!”
“We’ll head off soon,” Rhodey says. “I know you’re eager to get back.”
“Hey,” Bucky says. “Relax. I’m sorry I threatened to spoil your elfy books.”
“From a distance.”
They both look back at the door when there’s a noise that sounds a lot like the front door opening. Before it can close, there are sounds of an argument: a man and a woman, both trying to keep quiet, but even with the quiet, Steve can pick up that it’s a heated argument.
Jesus. This fucking guy.
“You already have one, some of us haven’t gotten our first.”
“Yes!”
“It is.”
“That’s the one.” Tony glances back at his phone. “So. Captain America likes poetry.”
Steve is never sure how much attention she was paying - if she liked the book, or just his voice.
“That he likes you, or....”
Steve doesn’t say anything. He pushes off the wall and comes closer until he’s standing in front of Tony. He looks him over and Tony feels his gaze like a weight, but not an unwelcome one - more of a comforting pressure than something dragging him down.
“Because you’re stubborn,” Steve says.
“Just wanted to confirm that we’re still on,” Tony says. “And get your number so we can talk details.”
“Don’t joke,” Rhodey says. “I know you’re gonna - I know you will later, but right now? We just -
Tony has had too many near-death experiences for one night. He disengages the gauntlet Obie’s holding, wrenches his hand out of it just in time for Obie to fall into the reactor, screaming all the way down.
“He just approached me one day and said he’d give me ten thousand bucks to pretend to date him. I turned it down,” he says when Sarah’s eyebrows hit her hairline. “And it just kinda - kept going.”
“You can’t take the
Tony gets injured on a routine mission, which isn’t unusual. What is unusual is that he requires hospitalization for it, and that he doesn’t put up a fight about this. The reason he doesn’t put up a fight is because he’s unconscious, but still.
“Yep, that’s exactly what happened,” Tony says, and then sends a pointed look at everyone else until they echo the same. Then Tony says, “And Ty really,
“Right,” Tony says. “Right.”
“Yes, Dad,” he says, in a tone that Steve hasn’t heard before and doesn’t care to hear again.
“Quit looking sad,” Bucky says, slinging an arm over Steve’s shoulder when Steve squishes into the small space left behind on the couch. “Your boyfriend’s gonna notice and ask why you’re all frowny-face.”
“Of course they stay friends.”
“Want to find out,” he asks, coming to a stop in front of Steve, hovering.
It doesn’t work.
s a girl?”
she hisses at Tony, and then, with a hastily pulled-together smile at Steve “Hi! I’m Miss Potts. You must be Steve.”
Tony texts back
. We never thought he’d be
. I broke up with him, it’s been two months and he won’t leave me alone. I figured if I found someone new, he’d get the hint that I’m really,
She swallows. “Are you okay?”
Tony stares at it. Looks up at Steve uncertainty, but also with brimming panic, which - isn’t great. Panic wasn’t an emotion that Steve wanted to be present with this.
Tony pulls and Steve is all too happy to follow. They all but speedwalk around the corner, at which point Steve says, “Huh. What a jackass.”
The caution leaves her face, lapsing into pure brightness. “I can’t believe going for a walk worked! I thought you two were going to keep being dense until college. I’m a genius!”
Tony shrugs. “He loves telling that story where you tried to punch that bully in the face but overswung and fell down three flights of stairs.”
“Nothing,” Ty says.
“Good,” Tony replies. He hands Steve the book. “Don’t drop it in the bath.”
Steve nods and digs into his cake. It’s lemon flavoured, which is nice. He’d mentioned that he’d like to try it a few months ago, so someone must’ve remembered. He doesn’t remember who he told it to, though, so he doesn’t know who to thank. He’ll have to come up with something later.
it is, so he rocks back and forth a few times. It squeaks. He should fix that later. He could do that before he leaves.
Tony stares some more. His chest throbs. He ignores it.
Steve’s mouth tug sideways, not entirely bitter but not
Tony hesitates.
It doesn’t get old. Tony flies them around until JARVIS mentions that someone’s posted a grainy photo of it online and Tony lands them on top of a building. It’s a skyscraper, and from here they can see most of the city.
“Yeah. Rhodey made them.” Tony smiles against his will, the most genuine smile since he’s got here, which is a problem. He generally tries not to do genuine smiles if he knows he’ll be faking it around someone, and this seems like the kind of situation where he’ll be all fake, all the time. Or at least - strained. Hidden. When he notices he’s smiling into his coffee at the thought of Rhodey, he pulls it together into something more casual.
“So,” Tony says. “Um. See you.”
“Thanks,” Tony says dryly, and then, after checking over his shoulder: “
“Good,” Steve says.
“Thanks, Ms. Rogers,” Tony says, and when she gives him a look: “Sarah! I meant Sarah. Sorry.”
,” Steve says, “Tell me what happens to Frodo.”
“Gotta do it for Steve Jr.,” Tony says. “Anything for that little guy.”
Tony squeezes back. “I don’t know. Apparently I’m hard to get over.”
“Ran into Ty just now,” Steve says.
“Bright,” he says.
be pretty bad, even if this is just to piss off their friends.
“I promise not to work myself into a coma,” Tony says.
Tony swallows. He keeps drying the fork.
Maybe Steve doesn’t want
think about it, it’s very Steve.
“I heard about-” Cap pauses. “I’m - glad you got out of there, soldier.”
For one, Steve’s never gotten this many looks before. Whenever he’s with Tony it seems like there’s at least one person watching him, their faces twisted in morbid curiosity or vague disbelief. It’s not very flattering, but Steve is holding out for the free tutoring.
Less than a day later, Tony is in a car with Pepper, who keeps glancing at him like she’s waiting for him to disappear, on the way back from a press conference.
. Steady is a good word to use when Steve’s involved.
“Thanks,” Steve tells him, and is about to break into it when a nurse comes out and tells them they can see Tony now.
“Hi,” Cap says.
“No, but - well, we all thought you didn’t like talking about your old life, so we didn’t bring it up much. And it seemed rude to probe into - why you left it behind, so we didn’t ask about it. Sorry, we should’ve told you we knew. I really did think you did.”
“It’s not-” Rhodey sighs. “It’s not… bad. It’s, uh. It’s surreal.”
“Tell him I’ll meet him in the gym,” Tony says.
“I know, Obie,” Tony says. He pulls himself away, but gently. “I’m - I know. I get it. I was… upset, before. But I’m over it now. I know you were just trying to help.”
. Right in the same way the suit felt right. Right like - like some other new things that are fitting into place with surprising ease.
“Thank you, Tony,” Sarah says, cutting into her toast.
It’s long since gotten dark out, but the Hammer house has so many lights up the driveway and around the house that it barely matters. One time, Steve has heard, they got a floodlight, but there are mercifully no floodlights tonight. Just the usual array of lights that were probably put up by workers, because Hammer is the kind of guy who doesn’t like to do his own work. He pays someone to do his homework for him.
“Yep,” Steve says.
“No,” Steve says.
has a nice ring to it. Tony listens to Rhodey talk on the TV as Pepper puts the finishing touches on his face, and as Coulson comes over and hands him his alibi.
Tony wonders briefly if anyone’s called the guy Steve since he woke up.
Tony looks up. He’d drifted for a second.
Tony pauses. His knife scrapes loudly on his next cut, and he winces. “Um. He didn’t do - I mean. He’s my friend, I wanted to help him out.”
“Okay,” Tony says. “Okay, cool.”
Tony crosses his arms tighter. “Sarah. Hi.”
“Well,” Tony says. “We’ll keep an eye out.”
“Huh,” Sarah says. She wiggles her fingers that are still poking through the hole in the shoe. “Guess you have a new pair of shoes, Stevie.”
Natasha purses her lips in a smile. “Mm-hm,” she says, and then turns back to watch Thor take the next pair of waffles out.
“Alright,” Clint says. “You’re awake! Great. I’m gonna go get some sleep somewhere that isn’t a hospital chair before my back is permanently deformed. Steve, Bruce, we’re tapping out. Thor, Nat, you’re barely tired, you can stick around.”
There’s his firewood shed, with all the firewood stacked, and beside it is the chicken coop. Chickens are free-range: Ferdinand (Tony can tell thanks to the splotch on her left wing) scouring the dirt for interesting bugs, Kit (thanks to her distinctive and deformed claw) in mid-step on the porch.
Tony grins and dips into a loop. They spiral downwards, then even out, and all the while, Steve laughs like a maniac. It’s enough to drag Tony along with him, both of them laughing like idiots as they fly through the night sky.
Rhodey is silent for a while. He keeps taking a breath like he’s going to say something, then letting it out.
“She knows,” Steve says. “I told her.”
Tony twists away from the blast that follows, and the heat hasn’t gone away when consciousness starts to slip away from him. There’s air on his hands - both bare now - and his heart is thudding, but weakly. He thinks Pepper might be calling his name, which is nice. Also means she’s alive, which is what matters.
At 1 on the dot, Steve shows up. Tony is already on his porch, with some planks of wood, nails, an old shirt and jeans, some hay, a hammer, a pillowcase and some twine.
“It’s no problem,” Tony says. “My day was looking pretty quiet anyway. Is it in the garage?”
As if he was waiting for it, Tony appears at the table next to Steve.
They like the farm, which is - gratifying. Tony tries not to feel too proud of himself as they compliment the new additions - silo, greenhouse, half-constructed second greenhouse, the fixed-up chicken pen and the crops that are flourishing for real now - and then fawn over the chickens.
“Huh,” Steve says, as Tony stands near the door and tries not to watch Steve too closely.
“Least you can do,” Sarah repeats. “Why, what did Steve do for you?”
Obie has, thank god, given up on trying to talk Tony back into weapons manufacturing. He still obviously wants him to get back into it, but after a week he stops mentioning it. Tony assumes he’s biding his time, but he’s not worried. He’s not going to go back for anything.
Tony has sent him about eight, all saying that he’s at the door.
Steve turns to him fast enough that he seems embarrassed by it.
at each other?”
“You’ll do a good job, Tony. Look at what you’ve done with this place - it’s only been a few months.”
Uncertainty flickers over Tony’s face.
Sarah’s smile falters. “Oh. Huh. Well, that’s not… how I expected that to go.”
“Familiar,” he says instead.
Steve blows out a breath and leans back in his chair. He can turn the homework assignment in half-done, or finish it during class.
“Real life helps,” Tony says. “Yeah, I get it. Okay, this should be even quicker than I thought-”
“You tore your old ones.”
Steve hands it to him and Tony pockets it with a short, “I’ll cherish it always.”
“Sure, you can sit in my room, Buck, thanks for asking,” Steve says as he comes to stand next to him.
“I know,” Steve says, and then, when Tony’s look of panic doesn’t fade: “Hey. I know.”
“In a few days, he healed quite a bit while unconscious and since they haven't detected any permanent damages he can come home if he just takes it easy and takes his medicines.”
“This is DUM-E, he is Tony's robot I told you about back at the mansion.”
“We’ll leave tomorrow afternoon. We have exams and Rhodey is having a meeting with some people about the air force.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------
He looked at them for a second and rolled his eyes before going over to the door.
“Don't worry about Bruce, nothing's gonna happen to anyone, I swear.”
“Ah fuck!” Steve exclaimed and threw his head back when Tony sucked at a very sensitive spot.
After around twenty minutes he stepped out of the shower and brushed his teeth and swallowed his medicine. He went back out to his room and dug out a pair of black sweat pants that were a little too big on him and his favorite Black Sabbath T-Shirt.
“Maybe? I don't know, they are all downstairs. And even if they did hear us Natasha probably won't let them make fun of you.”
“I would be happy, but I have to come back to this hell hole again tomorrow anyway for physical therapy.”
“Oh” the butler let out but before he could collapse back on the bed his wife wrapped an arm around his back and helped him stabilize.
“Fuck I love you!”
He followed his mental map and turned left where he was met two armed guards heading towards him. Before even thinking he brought his gun up and shot them straight between the eyes. He kept running, trying not to think about the wounds on his body that felt like they were on fire.
‘All good things have to come to an end though’ Tony thought as he walked his friends to their car with a heavy heart. Pepper walked up to him and cupped his cheeks before pressing a light kiss to his forehead.
Tony just curled up on himself and debated whether it was worth going to work today or not. After laying there and argumenting with himself for a couple of minutes he figured that it wasn't worth the death stare he would receive from Fury. So got up and put on the same pair of jeans but a black T-Shirt this time. When he finished getting dressed and brushing his teeth he headed towards the kitchen. Bruce was nowhere to be found so he must have left for work, with a mob. Man, that was gonna take some time for Tony to get used to.
He hugged her tight and they didn't let go of each other until Rhodey cleared his throat. They looked at him and he just raised an eyebrow.
Everyone jumped back to their research in a second, afraid of what the woman would do to them.
“I swear Tony, if I ever find him. I'll kill him slowly and painfully for what he did to you.”
“Come on sweetheart, come for me. I want to see you.”
“No problem.”
“Should we wake them up?”
“Jesus Christ Ty! What the hell?!” Tony exclaimed while shooting out of his seat while ignoring the curious stares they were receiving. He swayed a little bit and felt his eyes getting heavier but ignored it in favor of continuing. “I've already told you, I'm in a relationship, a very happy one in fact. And even if I weren't I'd never get back together with you! I can't trust you anymore! Goodbye Tiberius, Steve was right, it was a mistake coming here.”
“Somebody you know?” He asked.
We are unfortunately starting to reach the end of this story. I am thinking four or five more chapters to this and honestly I don't want it to end, but oh well, all good things must come to an end.
The sound of a slap echoed in the room and all the Avengers stared in shock as Natasha stood in front of Steve who was holding his reddening cheek and watching her in disbelief. She was wearing a serious expression.
He didn't know how much longer he could take this torture before he broke permanently.
"Bruce, what the hell!?" Tony exclaimed with wide eyes, looking around the room and swing more unknown people in the small room.
“So how long will you be here?”
Bruce took a deep breath and started talking.
“You know, this should be considered abuse.” He said and sent a heatless glare at her.
“We should probably get cleaned up.” He suggested. Steve gave a little laugh before agreeing, shifting Tony so that he was holding him bridal style and headed towards their rooms. Tony protested for a short while, insisting that he could walk on his own but Steve shut him up with a soft kiss to the lips and Tony snuggled closer.
That's when Clint’s phone started to ring. Tony stirred a little bit so the sniper stepped out of the room to take the call. Steve kept stroking his hair and he kept sleeping.
Just as he was about to fall asleep again the door to the cellar opened and in stepped the man he hated most of them all.
Steve sat up and removed the rest of his clothes, gasping as his hard on was met by the cool air.
He tried to give her a small smile but it came out as more of a grimace.
“The one that raped and tortured me?” Tony felt Pepper tense up at that and she pulled him at bit closer to her.
WARNINGS!!!!! VIOLENCE, DEATH AND MENTIONS OF RAPE/NON-CON IN THIS CHAPTER!!!!
WARNING! MENTIONS OF RAPE AND TORTURE
Sooooooo... I'm back I guess?
Now Tony attempted ho heave himself up on the dirty mattress but was unable to do so when his vision whitened from the pain. Instead he settled with pulling the thin blanket down and tried to cover himself as much as possible to keep the cold out, or as much as he could with a most likely broken arm. He knew it was in vain when he hoped that they would spare him or at least go easy on him for a couple of days just so that he would have time to heal.
He spent the next six hours like that, sitting in that uncomfortable chair with his team surrounding him and talking in hushed voices with each other.
Tony just sighed tiredly and crossed his arms over his chest before speaking up in a tired voice.
Thor seemed completely oblivious to what had happened while Natasha just smirked knowingly.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Oh my God, Anthony! What have they done to you? Oh, my poor sweet boy, it's going to be alright now, I promise. Captain Rogers and the rest of his team are planning a rescue mission for you, darling.” she hurried to comfort him.
Steve smirked and let go of Tony which earned him a whine and reached out to the drawer by his bed and pulled out a bottle of lube,
There were computers everywhere!
Anyway! This chapter is basically just a bunch of angst and fluff and I hope you'll like it!
"I guess I owe you an explanation then, huh? Sit down and I'll tell you everything"
“When are you gonna stop smacking me?” He asked while rubbing his head.
Natasha, Clint and Bucky were smirking at him when they saw him in only his pants and hickeys covering his neck and parts of his chest.
"Yeah, pretty much." admitted Bruce. "I should probably introduce everyone. For starters, when I'm on the field I am mostly known as the Hulk." That earned a snort from Tony "The woman who tried to shoot you is Natasha, also known as the Black Widow, next to her is Clint, also known as Hawkeye" he said, gesturing to the blond he had been patching up who gave Tony a little wave.
Alright guys! Here is a quick note about the sequel. Since I have a break this upcoming week I was planning on starting the sequel. Unfortunately you may have heard of the terror attack and shootings in Stockholm, Sweden that occurred today. I live very close to where the attack occurred, just twenty minutes away and some of my friends and family witnessed the whole thing. Fortunately nobody I knew was harmed physically, but I'm worried about their mental state. I am pretty shaken up but hopefully will be able to start writing, just maybe not as soon as I had hoped. #PrayForStockholm
None of us knew that Coulson's message was fake, we thought that our friend needed is and we went to help him.
Steve startled awake and his hands automatically went around Tony to keep him from falling off the bed. Still bleary eyed he looked down at the grinning face that belonged to his sweetheart and he let out a groan and settled back on the pillows while tightening his arms around the body on top of him.
“I just want to keep you out of it as much as possible and the safest place for you is here at the mansion. HYDRA is probably still looking for you.”
I really hope that you like this chapter and stay tuned for more!
“You can't beat me Anthony, I am the Red Skull, I always win.”
“Of course, take all the time you need.”
“I'm sorry, you shouldn't be forced to look after me, you probably have better things to do than comforting me.”
Ty took a deep breath and grabbed Tony's hand before starting.
As soon as he made eye contact he saw tears welling up in her usually joyful eyes. They seemed to widen even moore when she saw the state he was in.
Tony was cut off by Rhodey lifting his chin up and looking right into his eyes.
Reacting without thinking he smashed his own forehead against the man’s and while the goon was unbalanced he grabbed him and used one of the moves Natasha had taught him so that Tony was being shielded against the rest of HYDRAs agents that had started firing on him.
“What do you mean you didn't need us!?”
“Eggs.” Which earned a confused look from Steve.
Steve tossed the rag on the floor before crawling under the sheets and pulling Tony closer to his body so that he was spooning him from behind.
With a mischievous glint in his eyes and a smile on his lips he ran forward and jumped on Steve.
The smile Bruce attempted to do turned out more as a grimace.
He thought about how this was all his fault. If he had been more careful then none of this would have happened. When he went out with Tony he should have made sure that there were none following them. He should have taken Tony with him when they went to Coulson’s, then he wouldn't have gone to get groceries and gotten taken by HYDRA. He should have been there for him. He should have protected him better.
“Why did he do that to me?” He felt the hand on his head stop, there was no need to clarify who he was talking about. Maria sighed sadly before resuming her (failed) attempt at taming her sons curls, something she had struggled with since he was a boy.
When he finally reached the supermarket he had almost managed to calm down completely and he grabbed a shopping basket and made his way towards the milk section. He grabbed a gallon of regular milk and a gallon of lactose free milk for Clint since the man's stomach really couldn't handle regular and that would be a punishment for Clint and anyone within five miles of him.
They didn't say anything for a while, just stared into eachothers eyes until Steve broke the silence.
Most days it was Rumlow though.
Tony slowly came to consciousness to an annoying beeping sound and feeling like he had the mother of all hangovers. He tried to open his eyes but it was like they were glued together. After a few minutes he managed to pry them open but immediately regretted himself when he was met by a blinding white light. He groaned and closed them again before reopening them and adjusting to the light. He looked around himself and saw that he was in a hospital room which was filled with the Avengers, all asleep.
Tony barely contained a laugh at the sight of one of New York's biggest mob bosses looking like a little kid.
DUN DUN DUN!!!! Cliffhanger!!!! But the good news are that Brock and Tiberius are finally dead and it was painful XD
“But what if they are naked?”
“I love you too, Sweetheart. And you're welcome.”
Tony whined as Steve and Bruce helped him into the wheelchair, insisting that he could walk by himself.
In the middle of it all stood a distressed Clint and no sign of Tony. He had told them that it looked like this when he arrived and that Tony was nowhere to be found. But he had overheard a witness to the whole thing tell the police that it had been a man dressed in black with a red octopus with a skull as a head had thrown the grenade but that was all that he remembered before the explosion went off.
“Ok, ok fine mom. I'll go. But only because DUM-E needs me!”
“Mr and Mrs Jarvis, what are you doing here?” He asked while motioning for his team to put away their weapons as well.
Before he could do anything the older Stark spoke up.
“Why can't I come with you?”
Tony tried to keep a straight face and succeeded. For about two seconds. Then he burst out laughing, the team not far behind.
“Listen Bruce and listen carefully. I am tired of people apologizing to me for something that happened and that was not their fault. Like last week, Clint was basically bawling his eyes out because he thought it was his fault and Steve blamed himself just yesterday and I can see all the guilt in all of your eyes whenever I flinch from a bit of pain or anything. But it's not your fault, okay? Not yours, not mine, not the teams. It was HYDRA’s fault and especially Rumlow and according to what Bucky told me, he is really paying for it. So stop blaming yourself, alright?”
He learned that Clint had grown up in a circus and that he was a pro with the bow and arrow. Tony had also gotten to work with Bucky's arm. The other brunette had been ecstatic over the new upgrades and the two of them had bonded a lot. Tony and Bruce were still very close to each other and Bruce had only grown more protective over his friend.
When he looked up he felt his own cock twitch at the sight. Steve was looking down on him, a layer of sweat covering his skin, hair disheveled and his eyes dark with arousal. He was breathing heavily while loosing the grip he had on the brunettes hair.
Once again, as you can see, I absolutely love kudos and especially comments, your opinions mean the world to me! I love you all!!!!!!!
Her head snapped up when he closed the door behind himself and a lovely smile spread across her lips. She slipped over to her side of the bed and patted the spot next to her, indicating for him to sit down next to her.
“Woah boy, calm down. I wasn't gone that long, right?.”
Maria Stark trembled where she stood, hands shaking as she held a smoking gun up. She was only dressed in a nightgown along with the first silk robe she had gotten her hands on as she hurried out of her room after hearing screams and gunshots in her home. Her usually elegantly styled hair was a mess and her beautiful face was sweaty and pale as snow, the result of a mixture of the horror within her and the lack of sun she had received during her years spent in a drug induced high. But her eyes showed nothing but fire and the kind of determination to protect her child that only a mother could have. When she saw that her husband was no longer moving and that her son was unharmed she immediately dropped the gun that she had picked off of one of the many bodies that littered around her house. She ran on unsteady legs straight at her son and wrapped him in her arms while looking him over for injuries while ignoring the tears that were streaming down her face.
“I know that I don't have to and I won't. I promise you I won't do anything that I'm not ready for, not like you'd let me even if I wanted to.”
“Language Cap!”
“C’mon, c’mon, c’mon.”
He asked without tearing his eyes from the sleeping figure.
Tony turned around to see the whole team standing by the entrance to the kitchen looking at him with curious expressions.
“Clint! Go get the car! Now! Bruce and Thor, you gotta come and help me, we gotta be able to lift him when the car gets here without harming him further.”
“Nick?”
The team kept assuring Bruce that everything would be okay and after a while he let it go, though the worried expression didn't leave his face.
“Calm down, we won't let anything happen to him. But now I'm wondering, how did you even end up with the kid, you haven't talked about him that much before?”
That night it took hours for Tony to finally fall asleep, his thoughts of what had happened that day kept him up. Some birthday huh? Finding out that his friend and roommate was part of a crime fighting mob, meeting said mob and couldn't help but think about the mobs gorgeous leader.
Tony huffed and wrapped his own arms around Steve's midsection.
“Probably in a couple of days, he is very strong, he's gonna be fine.”
Comments and kudos are always appreciated! <3
The three of them walked side by side to the common room, Thor had left a few minutes before to gather the others.
Now they knew.
“Alright, but promise me that you will call the second anything happens!”
“You know, for such a tiny woman, she sure does know how to make us shit ourselves with just one look.”
Ring. Ring. Ring
The rest of the team were already gathered around the table, eating breakfast and talking to each other. They greeted the couple and when Tony sat down in one of the chairs and gave a slight wince most of them let out some catcalls.
“I don't think that you should go.”
It was finally over.
“Of course, I hoped that we would never have to meet during such circumstances, I am truly sorry. But know that I will do anything in my power to help you, especially since you helped me when I was in your position.” While he spoke in the end his gaze drifted towards a young brunette with amazingly blue eyes and sinfully red lips who was wiping the counter of the bar with a towel. The brunette looked up when he felt eyes on him and smiled at Erik while putting the towel away and making his way towards them. The boy was a couple of inches shorter than Erik, probably around Tony's height and he was slender built. He had a large smile on his face when he approached them and bent down to press a sweet kiss on Erik’s lips. He then turned to face the team opposite and his smile turned into one of kindness and gratefulness which caused the team to stand up in respect.
Even though Steve would deny it to his dying day, he whined when Tony got off his lap to stand up so that he could remove his pants and underwear. Steve copied the action and soon their lips were on each other again and Tony pushed Steve down on the bed so that he was sprawled out on the mattress. Steve sat up so that his back was resting against the headboard and he had a full view of Tony's naked form.
“Love you too baby, so damn much!”
Clint suggested that they play some video games to pass time and they settled down on the couch with a beer each.
Just as Steve was about to reply, Bruce came and told them to get moving. Steve sent one last glance to Tony's direction before following his friends.
