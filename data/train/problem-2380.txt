Jack offered a quiet little close-mouthed smile that reminded Dean so much of Cas that he found himself a little breathless.
They could work on mastering the art of the cuddle another time, he reminded himself, looking back toward the fire. Hell, they had eternity to get better at this whole thing, to get it right.
“It’s built into a bit of a hill, so you have a raised deck in the back with a view out over the path that leads down to the lake,” Jack said, surveying the cozy building with a pleased expression. “I put in a dock so you can fish, too. You can change whatever you want, obviously, but I thought this would be a good start for you.”
Cas had lobbed at him in the dungeon with absolutely no friggin’ time to react before it was too late.
“Alright, knock it off you two,” John called to them finally, watching from the safety of the front porch. Sam had managed to yank one of Dean’s legs up, and Dean was hanging off of Sam’s back to keep his balance while he hopped around cursing little brothers. “Lunch should be ready any minute.”
Thankfully, Dean paid close attention when Sam had explained everything they’d need to do in order to open a rift into the Empty, and with the most critical ingredient—the vial of Jack’s blood—he had the final missing piece.
, Cassie” or a suggestive eyebrow wiggle, but when his brother just tilted his head encouragingly he went on. “And the doorbell rang. I thought it was maybe a delivery or something, but it was Sam.”
It took him a while, but he finally managed to figure out what silo Sam had been talking about, about ten miles outside of town past the local football field. But then halfway down the main drag he spotted Sam’s lanky frame, Jack’s close behind, wandering through an intersection.
It sounded like such a simple concept, Dean thought, nodding along to Sam’s words and letting him ramble on about his other plans. It was good to see him excited about something. It also gave him a bit of prod to start thinking about that, too.
“Why yes, yes, I am,” Dean affirmed shamelessly. “Thanks for noticing.” He just grinned wider when Cas grumbled and gave in, stretching out comfortably along Dean’s body, knees settling to either side of his hips. It felt good to have him there, as natural as breathing, like Dean’s body had been custom built for that exact purpose.
Sure, in the past he may have taken time to wallow a bit and have his little pity party, but eventually he’d find his spark, the drive to keep going, to keep fighting to live life—all of their lives—on their own damn terms, Chuck be damned.
In the timelessness of heaven, Dean couldn’t ever quite keep track of what year it was on earth, but Jack’s regular updates on Sam and Eileen and their family had helped mark the passage of time, and with a little figuring, Dean realized that Sam was probably over ninety by now.
“Yeah, well, you made me pie.” He winked, letting his hands settle on Cas’ hips like he’d done it a hundred times before. “I’m kind of a slut for homemade pie.”
When he opened the door to the one on the left, he found it full of his favourite clothes from various stages of his life. He pawed through them all, reminiscing as he came across band t-shirts that had long ago disintegrated in laundromat washing machines and a particularly comfortable pair of perfectly broken-in jeans that he remembered having to toss after tearing a run-in with a werewolf. There was even his robe and slippers from the bunker, along with Sammy’s ratty old Stanford sweater.
“We can’t do anything here,” Sam argued tiredly. “For all we know he already went home and just forgot to keep his phone on him or something. We have to start somewhere.”
It was furnished with much more care than Dean’s bachelor-casual space with its walls covered in movie and classic car posters. Cas liked colour and despite the neutral soft grey walls throughout, the apartment was filled with retro furniture and vibrant artwork and textiles. Most of the pieces were thrifted, Cas had explained to him, since he tended to prefer the better quality and durability of mid-century décor. Some random sleekly modern pieces were scattered in, too, though, like the giant television that dominated the back wall of the living room, but somehow it all worked, and left the apartment feeling warm and inviting.
“But I never see you, you know, coming or going with anyone. You’re home right after work during the week, and we’ve been doing movie nights most Fridays and Saturdays. And then on Sundays, I don’t know, you’re usually doing groceries or cooking or something, so I realized that you’re probably not dating and I guess I was…well, wondering why.”
Outright grinning now, not an ounce of contrition in sight, Sam stuck a spoon in the stew and held it out. “Ok, ok! Come on, just try a bite. Unless you’re, you know, too chicken…?”
Deciding to let Cas be cagey for now, Dean let him off with a doubtful arch of his eyebrow. He got his beer and followed Cas towards the front of the apartment.
He remembered the anguished look on Sam’s face outside Eileen’s place, the way he had shaken his head, fighting off the devastation (
Saying that it had been a bit of a rough decade was a massive understatement; they were both more than entitled to a few tears by his reckoning. And maybe, just maybe, they were also entitled to…this, whatever it could be.
But he came around the counter and took the spoon because Sam had been trying hard to improve his cooking, and all brotherly teasing aside, he was actually getting pretty good at it. Well, if you ignored all the spinach and cauliflower he kept trying to sneak into already-perfect things like lasagna and mashed potatoes. Plus, if Dean could run his mouth a little and keep the misery off Sam’s face for even just a few minutes, it was well worth whatever healthy crap he was about to ingest.
“Whatever, jerk. You like it and you’re going to eat it, and I won’t even complain when you sneak out the other half of that pie you think I don’t know about for dessert later.”
“You should go,” he said abruptly, suddenly desperate to be alone. “Sam will be wondering what’s taking you so long.”
“Ok,” Sam said, holding up a finger. “So, one, that makes a whole lot more sense now than your landlord just randomly chilling in your apartment reading his book while you take a shower,” he said with a little smile, then raised a second finger, turning serious again. “Two, what the actual fuck, Dean? Why didn’t you ever say anything?”
“The sirens, you sweet summer child. We’re a couple of blocks away from a hospital. Cassie works there as an occupational therapist, so the location’s convenient for him, plus the guy could sleep through a nuclear attack so the sirens have never been an issue for him.”
between them for far too long; he was determined to make it up to Cas—to both of them, really—no matter how long it took.
“There’s something I need to tell you,” he started. “I don’t know how you’ll feel about me once you know, but you will always be my baby brother and I will always love you and want you in my life. Got that?”
Settling into Cas’ chair, Jack spent a moment scratching Sadie as she spun around in delighted circles, barking up a storm. “Nice to see you, too,” he said to her, and she barked a final time in response before trotting back to her usual spot by Dean and settling down with a bone.
And yet here they were…Even with all of those punishments for caring, even though they still felt every single loss like it was the first one all over again, they just kept getting attached.
While he worked his way through the bowl, he tried and failed to keep from worrying about his brother, who still hadn’t called. He wanted to hate Dean, but he knew firsthand that everyone had their own battles to fight. It didn’t hurt that he also liked Dean, liked how happy he’d made Cas, liked having a front row seat to see their little love story play out. Or at least he had, right up until things had gone horribly wrong and his little brother’s heart had been collateral damage.
? You think…No,” he waved his open palms towards Sam in a negatory motion, heedless of the cup still looped around a finger by its handle. “No, that’s…that’s
He’d wasted so much time. Time that the Empty had apparently been…what? Torturing Cas? Jesus, he was going to be sick.
“You know, I was surprised how big this room is, considering how small rooms tend to be in these older places,” he said as he settled onto the sofa next to Cas.
Dean could feel Cas’ gaze on him, boring into the side of his head. “I know, and I still think that, but it’s
In the void, something…shifted. It wasn’t the weight of a physical body moving, but rather his consciousness recognizing another; a feeling of something, an awareness, a being there that hadn’t been a moment before. It was massive and all encompassing, something that made him remember that the Empty had existed before the creation of angels, and even before God.
The surge of heat and pressure in the back of his throat, stinging in his nose and behind his eyes said
They stayed like that for a long time. When he finally felt like he could breathe again, Dean looked up slowly from the warm, damp fabric of Cas’ shirt and caught a glimpse of him looking just as wrecked as Dean felt.
Gabriel didn’t budge until Cas nodded, whereupon he hopped up with impressive speed to shove an accusatory finger in Dean’s face. Lips pulled tight, Gabe didn’t even say a word, just shook his head in disappointment as he prodded Dean hard in the chest, huffing as he turned away. His footsteps thudded off down the hall, punctuated with his door closing loudly enough to make Dean wince.
He went to pull back the covers and realized too late that at some point Dean had worked his index and middle fingers into the cuff of Cas’ sleeve and curled them up tight. He had been holding on for dear life, like he had been worried Cas might up and disappear on him while he slept. The motion was enough to wake him.
“An apple pie.” Cas’ hands twisted anxiously in front of him. “I have no idea if I succeeded or if it’ll be a complete disaster, but I followed the recipe and—”
Because summer sunsets were his favourite, he stared out the window, focusing on what he wanted. The light began to change into a liquid gold that heralded the long slow roll into evening.
There was no obvious solution, but he was getting desperate. Anything was better than self-inflicting the kind of wound that preemptively ending things with Cas would leave. He couldn’t willingly give Cas up.
Sam making breakfast in and of itself was not that unusual anymore but, for once, he didn’t try to pass off turkey “bacon” as an acceptable substitute. No, this time he handed Dean a plate with six (six!) pieces of honest-to-god real full sodium bacon. There was even buttered toast and actual scrambled eggs instead of the egg-white-only kind he’d taken to making lately that just tasted like fluffy Styrofoam and disappointment.
The shower didn’t stop, nor did Dean acknowledge having heard it, so Cas pushed himself up with a sigh. It was a good neighbourhood, but there was no sense in leaving a package on the front porch if they didn’t have to. He pressed the button next to the intercom that unlocked the downstairs door and poked his head out.
He had cleaned between his laptop keys and his shirts had been organized by purpose, with a separate section for plaid, divided by primary background colour. He could have bounced a quarter off the blanket drawn tight as a drum skin up under the pillows, especially since it had barely been disturbed during the night by anything so mundane as sleeping.
“Oh, you want to do this now?” he barked, getting into Dean’s face. “Yeah, ok, Dean, we can do this now.”
“I don’t get it, though,” Dean mused, tracing his gaze along the ducting on the ceiling while tapping a nail thoughtfully on the rim of the mug. “I know we’re not big on telling people that we love them every other second, but I knew that he loved us, loved me. And before that…all that other stuff he said. Why would that have made him so happy?”
Dean’s nose stung and he pressed his lips together tightly as he closed his eyes. He nodded, overwhelmed with gratitude. He had never loved his little brother more.
“It was a calculated risk,” Cas explained, “but two bedrooms is enough for a lot of people and having that extra window in the living room makes a huge difference.”
Dean was in the middle of a pearl-clutching faux-outraged reply when the bunker shook with a deep, sonic boom.
Luckily for him, the Caps scored and the cacophony of shouting by the commentators broke the moment and drew their attention towards the TV. Even though it was a goal for the other team, Dean was still grateful; Gabriel had been getting more direct with his looks and comments every week and Dean was starting to worry about what he might say next.
His bag was starting to slip. He hitched it higher, the vicious ache in his chest clenching anew at his brother’s concern. “I know.” Before he realized it, he added a rare and deeply grateful “Love you”.
Which was why he did the dumbest thing he’d probably ever done, which was saying something because there’d been a
Cas was quiet for a bit, but he didn’t pull his hand away. Instead, he turned to look out over the deck towards the trees with Dean.
What the hell, he reasoned. He had just cried all over the guy, had probably even got some snot on his suit jacket or something. So he swallowed the instinctive hesitation, the embarrassment at being such a girl, and nudged at a glistening tear lingering low on Cas’ cheek with a knuckle.
Sam was riding shotgun with Gabriel sprawled out in the back, apparently having decided that Dean was no longer on his hit list, though Dean had no idea why. He was grateful for their easy banter, though, since it left him space to wallow in his own bleak mood. He still hadn’t heard a peep out of Cas and was starting to question if he was going to come back. He let the dark thoughts gather, spiral, until his jaw ached from how tight he had it clenched. He didn't want to disrespect Cas' need for space, but the silence was becoming unbearable.
“Mmm,” Cas murmured, pressing forward so Dean’s kisses started landing closer and closer to that spot on his neck that got him to make noises that Dean was pretty sure should be illegal.
“I owe you an explanation, but before I tell you what happened, I need you to know that absolutely none of this is your fault.”
“Thanks, Bobby,” he said, clapping the older man on the shoulder, nerves starting to jangle as he cleaned up and headed for his car. By the time he parked and got himself up the stairs to his apartment, he was about two seconds away from a nervous breakdown.
Dean forced a cup of scalding coffee down his throat with a few bites of jerky, tossing handfuls of drinks and snacks into the passenger seat for later. He popped back in one last time to snag another coffee for the road, keeping a wary eye on the spot where the missing employee had probably been standing, like they might poof back into existence if he wasn’t watching carefully. He shoved a few bills under the edge of the cash register; no sense accumulating any more bad karma than he already had.
“Yeah, but see, Cas isn’t just any angel; he’s family. And grace or no grace, he isn’t one of those dicks with wings anymore; hasn’t been in a long time, actually. So if he’s not really an angel anymore, then this isn’t the right place for him. I’ve come to take him home.”
But by then the damage had been done and Dean’s brain was buzzing like a shaken beehive. Something incredibly dangerous had started shifting in him again. It felt a lot like hope.
“I was scared, Cas.” Dean looked up at him, his wide eyes and freckles standing out clearly from that close up, no idea about how painfully young he looked in that instant. “So scared…But I couldn’t let Sammy see—I didn’t want that to be his last memory of me, panicking because I didn’t know if I was taking the escalator upstairs or back down, y’know?”
Staring down at the comfortably faded rug under his feet, Dean shook his head, feeling a frown tightening his forehead.
Dean soon learned that Cas could almost always be found with a book in one hand, and that he could have several on the go at any given time. There were breakfast books, bathroom books, bedtime books, and books for every other conceivable time and place. And because he never had a proper bookmark handy when he needed one, the first reasonably suitable random thing would be used to mark his spot; an old Polaroid of him and Gabe at Disneyworld as kids (borrowed from its usual spot on the kitchen corkboard), the restaurant receipt from his and Dean’s first date (pilfered from Dean’s losing battle with the ever-present detritus on his dresser), or a crumpled ticket from when they had gone to see Thor: Ragnarok with Gabriel (presumably retrieved from his own jeans before they went into the wash).
“What the fuck just happened?” Dean asked after a minute. Sam’s mouth moved as he frowned his way through a reply, but all Dean could hear over the sound of his blood rushing in his ears was Jack’s final word on endless repeat.
“Clean yourself up,” Sam ordered him, starting to pack supplies back into the first aid kit, dug out for the first time in weeks; a new record for them.
Dean grabbed at him again, yanked him over onto his back and stuck his face in Cas’ line of vision, worry warring with the relief he felt at the sight of that old stoic expression. “What the hell are you— Hey! Look at me!”
Emotionally drained from two days of carefully reviewing everything he said before saying it and trying to answer Sam’s relentlessly enthusiastic questions without slipping up, he could have cried when he saw Sam’s message. And so what if he did for a minute, forehead pressed to his knuckles on the steering wheel?
“Fuck,” he muttered. Then before he could put his foot any further into his mouth (or overthink things), he reached out and covered Cas’ hand with his.
“So Dean was in the shower—” he paused out of habit for where Gabriel would normally throw in a token “
“Cas…” Dean chewed slowly, swallowed, sighed. “That’s amazing, man. Not sure I believe that ‘not so good in the kitchen’ spiel you gave me now, though.”
“He’s not meant to be here,” Jack said quietly, assessing Cas’ heaving breaths and how Dean had to hike Cas up against his side to keep him on his feet.
It didn’t help, and when Sam knocked on the door with an unusually concerned “Dean?” he knew he needed to pull himself together.
together from their first date on, and it was just so damn simple, unlike anything else Dean had ever experienced. It was so seamless that he felt guilty sometimes, when he remembered to, about how much he was getting to enjoy his life while Sammy was still stuck in Podunkville.
Before he had even stepped from the concrete walkway onto the bottom step, shaded from the sun by the full spread of the branches of a solid old tree, the front door of what Dean presumed was the main unit opened and a guy bounced out with a cheerful “Howdy!”
Stubbornly looping all of the bags over his shoulders and arms, he was determined to make only one trip from the Impala up to his door. He was only puffing a bit—ok,
It was a thought made even more terrifying by the endlessness of his options, and after a couple of minutes nodding along to Sam’s enthusiastic diatribe, his head was starting to spin.
Cas closed his eyes, shaking his head. “It doesn’t get old, reminding me of what I’ll never have? I made my deal with you and I honoured the terms. I came without a fight, prepared for eternal stasis, but you just won’t let it go, will you?”
He looked up at Cas’ sorrowful expression; saw evidence that he had cried more than a few tears of his own, and desperately wanted to do something to help. Could he touch? Was that something they could do now?
The laugh bubbled up unexpectedly from the warm and oh-so-soft spot Dean had grown in his chest for Cas and the panic started to subside.
They arrived with plenty of time to spare, working their way along the row of cars already lining the shoreline near the bridge. People were casually tailgating, or clustered around their cars in camp chairs, their beers tucked into paper bags for plausible deniability if the cops came by. The sweet funk of weed and the occasional tang of cigarette smoke swirled by in the breeze off the water.
“What I’m trying to say here is that he’s the most important person in my life, and until he met your brother, I know that I was his.” His gaze was pleading. “I need Cas to understand that Dean truly thought I’d reject him if I knew he was dating a guy. Up until a few months ago I was pretty much all he had, and he thought he’d lose me if he told me the truth. I’m not saying what he did was ok, but I don’t know if I would have handled it any better if our positions had been reversed.”
“If things were the other way around you know Cas would be dismantling the universe one atom at a time if he thought there was a chance to get you out.”
Running his hands through his hair, which left it even messier than usual, Cas blew out a slow breath and chuckled.
Taking a slow, deep breath of his own, Cas finally melted into the embrace on the exhale, turning his face into Dean’s neck. The tip of his nose was cold.
Likely catching Dean’s glance at the floors, Gabe waved his hand around at the slightly dingy dinged up walls as he started up the stairs. “Don’t let this turn you off, there’s no sense in fixing up the entrance since it gets banged up every time someone moves in or out, but we repaint the apartment after each tenant.”
by now, the steady inoculation of grief enough to discourage them from the foolishness of making any other significant emotional attachments.
He didn’t so much lie down as let himself collapse in slow motion to one side, but once he was horizontal he curled up with his pillow again, dragging a corner of the blanket over his legs.
On their walk home, Dean wanted to reach for Cas’ hand but settled for tentatively brushing the back of his knuckles against Cas’ between them. He ducked his head, knowing he was probably as red as beet, when Cas turned his wrist a little to link their fingers together. How ridiculous, he thought. He was a grown man who couldn’t even begin to guess the number of people he’d shared orgasms with, yet here he was blushing like a gawky teenager because he got to hold hands out in public with the guy he liked, on their way home after a successful first date.
They settled in at the table, Cas making appreciative noises as he immediately grabbed a piece of bacon off of his plate and crunched into it. “Perfect,” he said, once he’d chewed and swallowed.
The sonic boom that had shaken the bunker (and broken more than a few windows around town) was the herald of Jack’s victory; the restoration of the humans ripped from the timeline his first act.
Cas’ eyes snapped open and met his gaze fiercely in the mirror. “This was what we were going to talk about after your shower.” It wasn’t really a question, just a confirmation, but Dean nodded anyway.
The whole point of stifling summer weather was the contrast between your hot, sweat-damp skin and the first perfect pull off an ice-cold beer. It was the gradual shift from that steamy weather into dewy mornings with the crisp earthy smell of fall in the air, followed later by the tang of distant smoking chimneys when stepping out into the glittering hush of an icy winter night that marked time passing. It made you appreciate each season as it came.
“Jack, I’m sorry.” He meant to say more, to tell Jack how brave Cas had been, that he seemed to have been at peace with his decision; that he was a hero, that he hadn’t suffered.
He saw the determined way Cas was watching him over the last few bites of what had been Dean’s sandwich, and started to panic.
Dean drifted along behind him, quietly impressed. The floors looked like they might be the original hardwood, probably preserved under hideous carpets for decades, now sanded and gleaming under a coat of varnish. The walls were all a light grey that made the most of the buttery sunlight, and the kitchen was bright, another wooden door at the far end propped open to let some air in through the light screen door that he just knew would make the same springy
Practically shaking in his boots, he decisively told his lifelong, soul-deep horror of rejection to fuck off, and brought his hands up to Cas’ face. Cas didn’t move, didn’t breathe, and looked as terrified as Dean felt.
“Nothing. It’s nothing.” He looked over at Dean with a completely unconvincing close-lipped smile and snagged his own beer from the gleaming stovetop. “Game’s starting, come on.”
“Stay safe,” Dean muttered in his ear. “I’d better not be seeing you anymore soon, or I’m gonna be so pissed…”
Jack’s footsteps echoed behind them as he entered the library. A couple of thuds, likely books being set down, followed by a soft scrape as he pulled a chair out. He heaved a sigh, one that sounded about as worn out as Dean felt. Poor kid. Dean stared into the dark ripple of coffee in his cup, guilt bubbling to the top of the toxic stew of emotions that was on a constant low simmer inside him—hello there, old friend.
The book ultimately ended up on the floor along with half of the pillows and a mostly-empty glass of water as Dean desperately and breathlessly begged for “—more. Harder, please Cas,
He had broken the news that he’d switched shifts with a coworker who was in a jam. She was a single mother with three kids, and because of the custody arrangement with her ex she would have had to miss Christmas with her kids that year if she hadn’t been able to find a replacement. Because of chronic short-staffing issues, Cas was the only person left who could help; he would be stuck working both Christmas Eve
Sitting vigil by Cas’ bedside, Dean leaned his elbows hard into his thighs, fingers laced together as his right thumb rubbed restlessly into the opposite palm. Cas’ face was so still, only the subtle movement of his chest lifting and falling under the blanket giving any sign of life.
It didn’t take Dean long to figure out what he had to do. He’d realized somewhere around the 1am mark that he’d made a giant mistake in letting Cas out of his sight. With the realization came a sense of peace so sudden and so profound that it shook everything into place, all of his puzzle pieces finally landing in the right spots.
The words came out a little stilted, shaky from how hard his heart was suddenly beating in his throat at reliving the memory. “Before he, uh, got taken, Cas said some…stuff.”
Dean was still taking it all in, admiring the deep-set veranda with its peeled-log railing that was practically begging him to kick his heels up onto it. A familiar green cooler was set between a pair of rocking chairs in the shade by the door.
Waving him away, Sam shook his head as he hopped off the bed. “Yeah yeah, book, landlord, got it.” But just as Dean started back down the hall, Sam called out, “Oh, and Dean? Men who wear Scooby Doo boxer-briefs shouldn’t be making cracks about other men’s superior cartoon underwear choices.”
He waved Sam over to the couch and grumbled his way back to the kitchen to fish a couple of beers out of the fridge. He handed one to Sam and flopped onto the other end of the couch, making a ‘go on’ motion with his hand.
Dean bolted upright like Cas had just a few minutes before. In the span of a few seconds his eyes were already shifting from sleepy to relieved, a grin stretching his sleep-flushed cheeks.
Dean grinned. “Yep, turns out she was more than willing to see if Sam missed her as much as I missed you.”
He stared at the door for a few seconds disbelievingly. What the fuck had just happened? Deeply unsettled, he wanted to pound on the door, demand answers from his boyfriend who had never ever acted as oddly or as hurtfully as he just had. But Cas knew himself; he was way more of a lover than a fighter. Dean had said he’d explain later and Cas trusted him enough to wait.
“I…don’t know?” was the best answer Cas could muster, and he flung the stubborn shirt and hanger aside with a muttered curse.
He recounted all of this in the middle of the kitchen where he had poofed in just as Dean was on his third cup of coffee. The spoon that he had poised to shovel in another mouthful of cereal landed back into the bowl with a milky splash. Sam, sweaty and startled, froze in the middle of throwing a handful of spinach into his smoothie blender for his post-run breakfast.
couldn’t help himself with the sass, could he? “You made a deal with an angel and then took him in his happiest moment.”
Quick reminder for any non-Canadian readers: Canadian Thanksgiving is the second Monday in October, so this is a long weekend for the guys with the Monday off of work. Québéc tends to celebrate pretty typically (turkey, stuffing, gravy and such), but culturally it's nowhere near as big of a deal as it is in the States.
Except that the words stuck in his throat, heavy and sharp-edged with doubt. Dean’s face certainly didn’t help; he couldn’t have looked any guiltier if he tried.
he was, Dean knew that. But Sam had decided to embrace the process and was meditating, doing something called a Whole30 that apparently involved avoiding any kind of half-decent food for thirty days (thankfully Dean knew how to cook or else he would have been stuck eating rabbit food with Sam for an entire month), and reading books with such horrifying titles as
“I mean, I don’t think I’ll give it up completely or anything, but…yeah, I think it’s time to take a step back, start figuring out if this is something that makes me happy.”
With the door shut behind him, he all but fell onto his bed, his whole body heaving with what it perceived as a life-or-death struggle for air. He hadn’t had such a strong anxiety attack in a while, he thought, focusing on his breathing: inhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds, exhale for four seconds, hold for four seconds. Rinse and repeat.
Dean opened the door and slid out, seeming to shed a decade in that moment alone. His face when he popped it back down to peer in through the window looked happy, young and boyishly excited in a way Sam couldn’t ever remember seeing before.
She brushed an eyelash off her cheek and threw him a little grin in the reflection. “I’m just gonna powder my nose...”
If it took twenty-six days (a “month” if you were Doctor Samuel Know-it-all Winchester) for Dean to hit bottom, it took nearly ten times that—the better part of a year in fact—of baby steps to start getting his head sorted.
, Cas opened his eyes, a very familiar squint appearing as lines formed across his forehead. “Dean?”
“First hockey game of the season is tomorrow,” Dean mentioned when the conversation started to wind down. “You a fan?”
Ah, shit. Swallowing the ache in the back of his throat, Dean blinked hard at the bright screen. He wasn’t an idiot; he knew Sammy was probably lonely as hell, too smart and too woke for that backwards little town in the middle of buttfuck nowhere.
Whether it was the nearly twenty-four hours without sleep, the coziness of his familiar bed, the booze, or even the weak comfort of roughly yanking a pillow to his chest and hanging on like his very life depended on it, he managed to fade into sleep faster and easier than he had dared to hope for.
Padding into the kitchen, he rummaged in the back of the pantry for the bottle of twelve-year old Macallan that he’d bought in a fit of melancholy. He’d had a very dramatic plan to drink himself into a very expensive self-pitying stupor when the day came where he’d eventually have to face seeing Cas involved with someone else.
“Of course, but he’s had three renters in the last three years bail after their lease was up because they still found it too disruptive during the weekends or some shit.” Gabe shrugged, dismissive. “So that’s it, but if you don’t want the place, no harm no f—”
To show how done he was with that stunted attempt at conversation he turned away to finish closing up the car, meticulously checking that all of the windows were up and the locks punched down even though his baby was about as safe and secure as she could ever be.
Heart still drumming in his throat, adrenaline making his fingers tremble, Dean sought refuge in banal small talk. “Bed’s not too small?”
It seemed like he’d guessed right, that it was the master bedroom, a private bathroom visible through a door on Cas’ far side. Instead of closets, on the wall to either side of the big fireplace across from the bed, there was a cheerfully mismatched pair of tall wardrobes that looked like they had come straight out of the nineteenth century.
Pulling back into the little driveway at his new place, Dean hit the remote and waited as the retrofitted garage door opener jerkily lifted the ancient door up enough for him to swoop down the steep slope and into the garage on a oner.
With a snort, Dean yanked open the fridge and buried his head inside. The cool air felt incredible against the heat of his face. “Dude. Of course, he didn’t just let himself in.” Spotting a container of leftover pasta sauce and some hamburger buns, he tucked them into the crook of one arm while he dug out cheese and his ever-present container of homemade garlic spread.
The sound of the bathroom door hitting the wall startled them both. Dean, a towel clutched around his waist, came rushing out, pale as death and dripping water all over the floor.
Gabriel was busy texting someone, the glow from his screen lighting up the smug little grin on his face.
“Seriously, you and Cas have missed how many chances, lost each other how many times now? You have a shot at something incredible, and if you coming back to earth just so I’m not alone means you guys have to spend the next forty plus years or apart, then I’m not interested.”
“Cas?” He pitched his voice low, edging into the hall. He didn’t want to just barge on in if Cas didn’t want to see him.
Sam pursued him doggedly, his oversized feet thumping down the hall after him. “Dean, come on, the guy was hanging out in your apartment while you were in the
“If you tell me,” he said authoritatively before Dean could argue with him, “that you want to be here on earth more than anything else, then I’ll accept that, but I think we both know that’s not really true anymore.”
Standing in the yard out in front of the most perfect home he could have imagined, he took a deep breath to settle himself, sending out one final prayer.
But Cas never pressed him, and Dean clutched desperately at that excuse to put it off for another day, always just one more day, until he found himself facing down the start of the third week of June. Sam was supposed to be arriving that Saturday after his last exam to spend the long weekend with him. It was a perfect time to be celebrating a graduation in Montreal, since it always marked the end of the regular school year and the official start of the summer festival season.
“Please,” he whispered. “I don’t know what I’m doing here. It’s not like you helped a whole lot back when my mom was dying, but I don’t know, maybe at some point you’ll be tired of seeing how much I can handle before I break.” His grip tightened, palms squeaking against the smooth curves. “It’s way too late for Mom, but there’s still a chance for me and Cas, you know? Just…help me figure out what to do. Please. I can’t lose him.”
“What the fuck is ‘galangal’?” Dean groused, tilting his phone screen so Cas could see the word. He was sprawled out on Cas’ sofa with his head in Cas’ lap, being petted into a lazy Sunday afternoon nap.
His brain thought that it was probably a good thing that Cas was the first to step back and put some space between them. But his hands, lifting to try and catch at Cas before he forced them down to grip the edge of the counter instead, seemed in agreement with his dick that any distance between their bodies was most assuredly
Dean closed his eyes briefly against the ache. Sam wasn’t wrong; he’d been pretty much permanently a grinning heart-eyes emoji since meeting Cas. The only thing that would have made it better, would have been if he could have been open about it with his brother. The worst part was that Cas and Sam were two peas in a pod in so many ways; smart as hell, curious, generous, empathetic, and total book nerds to boot. Cas knew so much already about Sam, knew how important he was to Dean; Cas deserved the same, for Sam to know how incredible he was, how good he was to Dean, how hard Dean was falling for him.
He got a full grin for his comment. The sheer wattage of it, coupled with the royal blue button-down—top two buttons left open to show some skin and sleeves folded stylishly back—and
Dean watched the interaction taking place, his brief surge of elation plummeting down rollercoaster-fast to despondency. Jack…wasn’t staying. Jack was leaving
“I know everyone usually does the chicken soup thing when they’re sick, but honestly, I’ve always found something with a little kick to be much more enticing since you can barely taste anything, you know?”
Sam kept going after that, alternating between looking distressed and insulted, hands waving around, but there was a ringing starting up in Dean’s ears.
He still vividly remembered the night just before his birthday, when the dam of denial he’d built couldn’t hold back the truth anymore. He had knelt doubled over on his bed, face buried in his pillow as he begged a God he didn’t even believe in to explain to him why he was like this. Why, after everything he had already been through, did he now have to figure this out on his own, too?
Dean mentally crossed Christmas and New Years off his list. He was free and clear until mid-March when he’d promised to spend a week with Sam for spring break, feeling guilty for always finding reasons not to go visit for a weekend.
Cas didn’t move, didn’t even blink, his eyes fixed on his reflection in the mirrored closet doors across from his side of the bed.
Tears started welling up as his voice went rough and deep with emotion. “I thought I’d have to come clean when Christmas started getting closer, but then you had to work and, like an idiot, I thought, ‘Oh thank god, I don’t have to do this yet’. Which was ridiculous, because things between us were just getting better and better, and I was starting to think we really had something here, so I knew I was going to have to face the music eventually.
The doorknob felt so wrong under his hand, knowing that Cas was downstairs, hurt and angry, and that only a puzzled Sam waited for him on the other side of the door.
he started gently saying things to Dean like “It’s ok that you’re not ok”, and bringing Cas and Jack’s names up in casual conversation at least once a day. The worst was when he left a blank notebook on Dean’s pillow with a printed out article on how to start journaling for “emotional healing”.
Cas was grasping at straws and he knew it. Was it possible that there was another explanation? Yes, of course it was possible. But was it probable? There were just too many individual moments that collectively added up to a whole lot of circumstantial evidence. How Dean had always managed to FaceTime Sam when Cas wasn’t around, Dean’s evasiveness about Christmas and spring break back with his family, how squirrely Dean would get whenever Cas had brought up things they could do with Sam once he’d arrived.
Call him crazy, but Sam took that as a good sign that he was definitely barking up the right tree and steadfastly ignored everything his brother said, reminding himself in between barbs that someone had to be the adult in that moment and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be Dean.
“You know, I wouldn’t have cared if you didn’t want to come out. If you didn’t want to tell your family about us, that would have been more difficult, but I think I would have understood,” Cas paused to take a deep shuddering breath, “I could have even lived with some subterfuge about us if that’s what you needed, but you actually made up a girlfriend to
He had no idea who he was even talking to, but hell, he’d pray to friggin’ Chuck at this point if it would bring Eileen back, if it would keep Sam from having to live through losing yet another love. Because that’s what had been blooming there between those two in recent months, and Dean’s heart twisted in despair when he saw Sam reappear.
Sam seemed resigned but hopeful; the news didn’t seem as much of a surprise to him as it did to Dean. “What if we want to see you?” he asked.
To Dean’s surprise, Cas was right; the scotch paired beautifully with the pie. And when Cas tugged him in for another kiss, it turned out that it all tasted even better on his lips. But Cas didn’t let him chase that flavour too deeply, pulling away after a few heart stopping seconds.
Once the leftovers were stashed in the fridge and the kitchen tidied up, Dean was pulling the plug on a sink full of dirty dishwater. Cas set another beer down next to him already opened.
Jesus, Dean needed to get it together, but it wasn’t easy when his new landlord had a voice that would fit right in on a pay-per-minute phone line.
“Dean only runs if something’s chasing him,” he offered as an explanation, and her little frown cleared with amused understanding.
designed for cargo), Dean hovered his hand over his car keys, looking over at Cas curiously. “Am I driving?”
He had been on the road for a couple of hours in utter silence before he actually processed that it was the middle of the night, but the minor inconveniences of his body—fatigue, hunger, a straining bladder—were barely even blips on his radar.
an angel, it was his job to love us and, like, humanity. All creatures great and small and stuff.” The explanation sounded lame, even to him.
Dean, who had come to get him out of the Empty and said that Cas’ assumptions were wrong. Dean, who looked a bit flustered but was smiling like it was his birthday and Christmas all at once, and who still hadn’t let go of his sleeve.
Pulling out of the drive with a honk and a wave, he lowered the windows and cranked the music, smiling as he accelerated along the country road in the sunshine.
He looked into his mug, jostling it a little just to see the ripples chase across the surface of the rapidly cooling coffee. Black, no sugar, just like he’d always taken it. Not because he had ever truly
Gabriel barrelled on like he knew Cas was about to interrupt him, “He was wrong, but if you don’t come back here and at least give him a chance to explain everything, then I think you’ll regret it for the rest of your life.” His tone gentled. “He’s head over heels in love with you, you know. People do some crazy shit sometimes when they have something they’re so afraid of losing.”
Cas and Gabe’s front door was locked. Dean hesitated for a moment over whether it would be alright for him to use his key, but since the alternative was ringing the doorbell at a truly unholy hour, he unlocked the door but knocked lightly as he stepped through into the foyer.
He looked like hell and he knew it. He didn’t even care. He’d been clinging to Cas for the last couple of weeks, desperate for the feel of him, nuzzling into him at every opportunity to chase even a hint of his scent, his warmth.
Even though his smile didn’t reach his eyes, Dean appreciated that John at least made the effort. “Must be all that tofu the grocery store carries special just for him.”
Cicadas were still a buzzing chorus outside the window, the temperature warm enough to feel like any lazy deep summer Saturday while the room stayed fresh and comfortable despite the windows being open. It was perfect.
Not to say that it wouldn’t hurt; it would hurt like hell, would probably never really stop hurting, but the payoff was his freedom to be himself, to be with whoever made him happiest, to build himself a family where he’d never have to hide the person who was everything to him.
Thanks for reading and one final thank you to the Pinefest mods for their hard work and to thevioletcaptain for artwork that made my heart sing. This was such a great experience <3
By then, his room had been completely upended and reorganized to within an inch of its life. Twice. There wasn’t anything less than perfect forty-five- or ninety-degree angles to be found.
plan for when this all inevitably blew up in his face and he had to explain himself to Cas. Sam had made assumptions, and Dean just hadn’t clarified things. It wasn’t like he had outright lied to Sam...or to Cas. That’s what he told himself when he couldn’t sleep, staring at the ceiling over his too-small single bed and desperately wishing he was home with Cas instead.
honest with himself, the doublewide lounger conveniently positioned near it was pretty damn appealing, too.
Cas shifted in the changing light, brows drawing together briefly before they relaxed on a murmur, returning his expression to neutral. Disappointed, Dean released his grip on the edge of the bed, forced himself back into watchful stillness.
When Sam missed a shot so badly it could only have been deliberate, Dean half expected him to come storming over and demand they leave. But while Sam did come over, he didn’t comment (unless a disappointed sigh counted) when Dean excused himself a minute after Alice had headed to the bathrooms with a flirty little grin thrown back over her shoulder.
He ended the call halfway through a worried question, tossing the phone aside with a flick of his wrist. The screen could crack for all he cared. He rubbed his hands roughly over his face.
“I wanted to tell you that I loved you in Purgatory that last time,” Dean said after a while. He ignored Cas’ startled inhale and plowed on. “I was so close to saying it when I saw you back at the portal, but you kind of seemed like you maybe knew already, so I just…didn’t.”
Dean waved a hand between them. “After what you did, the whole ‘sacrifice yourself so I could live’ thing, and I couldn’t even keep myself alive for a year.”
“Cas…” he said. Cas instantly went rigid next to him, and when Dean chanced a quick look at him, Cas had closed his eyes again like he’d seen a truck crossing the median into his lane and knew that a head-on collision was imminent.
The closed lid of a toilet seat wasn’t the most comfortable place to have a meltdown, but it was that or the chilly tile floor next to the tub and he was already shaking enough as it was.
But Sam didn’t take the bait, eyes on the Ikea bookcases that Dean had set up side-by-side along the wall opposite the bed.
“He’s top dog now!” he told Sam. “He can do whatever he wants.” He switched his focus from the odd expression on Sam’s face to Jack’s, cuffing him jovially on the shoulder. Relief had him chuckling.
The first swig had burned like fire, but by the third it was going down smooth, warming the icy pit in his stomach. The hot water was helping too. As steam started to billow in the tiled confines of the shower room, he leaned out from under the spray to snag the bottle he had set down just outside the stall, grabbing a quick sip to keep the buzz rolling.
“Is this ok?” he asked, just to be sure, even though the whole love confession thing sure had made it seem like it would be.
Sam could sense that Dean was preparing to brush him off, so he cut himself short and leaned further into Dean’s space, ducking his head to catch his brother’s glassy gaze.
It took a few days to finally make sense of things, but unleashing utter chaos and then restoring some kind of order was the Winchester way, wasn’t it?
“I guess that’s all there is to it then,” Cas said. He didn’t recognize his own voice, as flat and stiff as a sheet of plywood. When he finally forced his eyes open, he very carefully didn’t look at Dean, keeping his eyes on his own reflection.
The long field-lined road dragged on and on under the Accord’s wheels, Dean’s stomach twisting and tugging with every farm he passed. The drive would have been miserable either way, but having to do it on a relatively warm—for Canada—spring(ish) kind of day without the luxury of his Baby just made it worse, but there was still a couple of weeks to get through before he could make the switch.
Dean always did everything he could to suppress his memories of Hell, of the things he had done to the souls on his rack. But as the pressure of a unique kind of fury started to build inside him, he wished for that rack with all of his being. He wanted the Empty in some kind of physical form on it, longed for every tool he had ever used under Alistair’s tutelage. He wanted to dig and flay and wrench and burn until it understood the mistake it had made in thinking it could punish Cas. Cas, the warrior who had only ever wanted peace, who loved honeybees and cheeseburgers and who had died a little every time he had been forced to kill another angel. Cas, who loved Dean.
,” he all but spat the word “that rolled off a production line. He’s himself, and I don’t think there’s a damn thing wrong with him, so if he’s such a hassle to y’all, how about I take him off your hands for good?”
Sam lingered for a minute, shuffling his big feet around awkwardly, probably trying to figure out another opening line that wouldn’t immediately get him a fist to the face, but with a discouraged sigh, he eventually left, closing the inner door softly behind him, which was worse than if he’d huffed his way through and slammed it with a bang.
“Sonovabitch,” he spat. His tennis shoes thumped softly as he leapt to his feet and started pacing agitatedly between the foot of the bed and the wall. His hands stretched open and clenched shut at his sides in agitation. “He seemed like such a nice guy and he’s been so good for you…I
Folded nearly in half and grunting under his brother’s superior weight, Sam still wouldn’t quit. “Try it and I’ll shave your eyebrows off again. See if Cassie’ll still think you’re so pretty then!”
It felt exactly like what you’d expect a place/person/thing called the Empty to feel like. He shuddered instinctively, all of his hackles rising. No one who enjoyed earth and all of its inhabitants as much as Cas had would ever want to be here.
Everything he needed was in the bag, minus his toiletries. Nodding to himself, Castiel zipped it shut and turned to face Gabriel.
Heart pressing up into his throat, Dean wanted to argue, but Sam was right. He settled on a tight nod, waving off Sam’s offer to take the first leg of the drive, and after ducking into the nearest service station for a quick refuel and to let Sam and Jack grab some food, they were back on the road.
“Come on, Cassie, you know I’m always on your side even when you’re wrong. But as your big brother it’s also my job to tell you when I think you’re making a mistake.”
“Not the first time I’ve heard that,” Dean scoffed, “and probably not the last. Now, where’s the angel?”
Dean couldn’t argue that it seemed to be working well enough for him, though. Courtesy of no sugar or processed carbs for a month, Sam was leaner than he’d been since his last growth spurt at seventeen, but his face seemed softer, less pained than it had been in the early days. He even smiled at Dean’s jokes most of the time, but it was still a challenge to coax a laugh out of him.
“You, too,” Dean replied roughly. He hadn’t been quite sure what to expect, but Bobby looked the same as he ever had, minus some of the deeper grooves that grief and age had carved into his face. He even smelled the same; old books, motor oil and gunpowder, and despite his still-simmering fury, Dean couldn’t help but pull him into a hug.
By the time Cas emerged from the bathroom with his damp hair sticking up everywhere, Dean had managed to get his boxers back on and reduce the biohazard level to something verging on acceptable. Bacon was sizzling on a tray in the oven and sliced tomatoes, crispy lettuce leaves, and squares of Cas’ favourite Jarlsberg cheese were neatly laid out on a cutting board.
Dean studied it for a moment before raising his brows at Sam. “Yeaaah, gonna need a little more than this.”
It was exhausting, all of the mental gymnastics, trying to keep track of what he’d said, trying to keep from outright lying, always a filter running in the back of his mind to be careful of what he said and how he said it. He wasn’t proud of it, but he had nearly cried with relief when Cas had come back from work in a resigned mood.
“Sometimes things bloom because they have been subjected to harsher conditions, deprived of things that they should have had to make them grow and they bloom as their last attempt to draw attention, to put themselves out into the world before they’re gone.”
He had gone the whole visit so far without once slipping up, playing coy anytime John or Sam mentioned Cassie, deflecting questions like pucks bouncing off of a goalie’s pads.
He didn’t bother with his slippers since he had socks on, but yanked his robe on over top of everything, shivering. Now that the warmth from the booze was leaving his system, the cold was back. It sloshed around slick and oily in his stomach, chilling the back of his neck, the insides of his elbows, behind his knees.
? Sam, I—” If he had been thinking straight, Dean might have been more embarrassed by how plaintive his tone had turned, but he was too preoccupied to care.
He had to just focus completely on whatever he was doing in that instant, stay grounded in the present. Showering? Focus on hitting every nook and cranny with the soap. Shampoo twice and skip the conditioner this time. Give his face a quick rub with a handful of suds; dry off with the curtain still drawn so the shock of the cooler air in the rest of the room wouldn’t suck so hard.
“I know you’ve got questions, but I just—I can’t right now.” He chanced a quick glance up to make sure Sam had heard him, rubbed at his forehead tiredly. God, even his
“What’s on your mind?” he grumbled, though not unkindly. It was far gentler than he felt like being when he could barely hear over the pounding drum solo that was currently playing on loop in his head.
Sam’s expression was all kinds of aching sympathy. “Wow…I never thought he’d—well, I’m glad that he at least got a chance to tell you.”
“Mm,” Sam said, wobbling his head side-to-side indecisively as he drew his legs up to sit cross-legged on the rumpled duvet cover. “Ish. He’s got to be lonely with me gone, too.”
The bag rustled as Cas very carefully set it on the counter. He held onto the handles, took a deep breath, and looked up at Dean.
Cas’ appreciative laugh behind him made Dean smile at the inside joke, but then the worry that was never far from his mind pulled the corners of his mouth back down. Nausea surged up, turning the inviting smell of bacon cooking into a cloying haze.
His phone sat innocuously on the vanity next to him, still showing the evidence of his cowardice, the colours muting as the power saving option came on, but the screen not yet locked.
“For what? For telling me you love me? Or for planning on never telling me if you hadn’t had to?” Dean’s voice was getting strident, and he wanted to smack himself.
A beat. A breath. That nowhere and everywhere light reflected in Cas’ wide eyes. Dean could see every shade of blue in them, an eternal sky meeting an endless ocean. He smiled into them, even though he could feel the spell starting to fade. It was now or never.
Pouring a couple of fingers into a pair of fancy glasses that he had allegedly also bought for that grim milestone, he smiled down into the amber liquid. He much,
“I wanted to talk to your brother,” he said finally, looking back up. “But I know he’s not here so, if it’s ok, I’d like to talk to you.”
He nodded, swallowing his mouthful of beer with a little cough before replying, “The whole sordid tale.”
He sure hoped his little brother had one hell of a clear vision of where to go from here despite losing Eileen, because he was so lost in the dark he wasn’t sure he’d find his way out again.
“I know, Dean.” Jack’s sudden smile was like opening a door to be bathed in the pure white stillness of morning light after a fresh snowfall; radiant. “Take care of him.”
“You can’t hide in the shower forever, Dean.” Cas’ voice was frustrated but calm. “I know something’s been bothering you for a while now. I’d really like for you to tell me what’s going on.”
“Can you think of anywhere else you’d like me to do that?” she teased, tilting her head back to look at him with bright eyes as she started to lower herself to her knees.
“Yeah, Cas, I’m sure.” He tilted his head to the side and opened his eyes. “Sam’s got his own life to go live now.” He lifted their joined hands and watched Cas’ eyes widen as he pressed a kiss to the back of his. “And so do I.”
“There’s hookups for a stacked washer-dryer in the linen closet, but Cassie barely uses the basement so if you don’t want to invest I’m sure you could work something out with him to use the ones he’s got down there.”
Dean held open the other half of a fleece throw that had conveniently appeared when he sat down by the fire he hadn’t had to build. There were times for the satisfaction of building your own fire, and then there were times when you just needed one
He hadn’t considered that said angel loved Dean as anything other than one of his Father’s endlessly fascinating creations, as a member of their weird little family they had somehow built up over the last few years. Loved Dean so much that just the declaration was enough to make Cas the happiest he had ever been.
Dean would have given anything to take it back. He’d have traded his soul in that moment if it would undo the whole goddamn afternoon and leave him lying peacefully on his sofa like he should have been, his feet resting in Cas’ lap while they talked about what to make for dinner.
The sound of a tentative knock at the front door and the rattle and thump of its opening and closing brought Cas’ head up like he’d been hit with a cattle prod. They both stared at the bedroom doorway as quiet footsteps brought Dean into view.
He had still had deniability; other than using the name Cassie in that one text to Sam, he had never explicitly confirmed that Cassie was a woman. It had taken lots of quick thinking to dodge pronouns in his replies, but he’d been doing it for so long that it wasn’t as hard as it had been in the beginning.
But once he got the door open, his prepared greeting came out as a gut-punched, breathy “Oh” instead, because holy shit those were some seriously blue eyes…
Donna’s voice crackled out over the rushing sound of tires on pavement. She had blinked back into stunned existence in the silo, along with a few others, but Charlie and Bobby were still MIA.
“Stop worrying, I’m not going to get drunk. Let’s just go have some fun, you and me, just like the old days, ok?”
Sam had held off on telling him about the spells because he’d already been careening himself towards a cliff’s edge of self-destruction at a hundred miles an hour. If he’d made more of an effort to move forward, shown that he wasn’t going to be a danger to himself, literally done
Throwing up his hands, Sam sprawled back in the opposite seat. “Of course I am, I gave you enough bacon in a single serving to finish clogging whatever space you might have left in your arteries.”
“Don’t.” Sam’s tone was curt, but Dean understood better than he wanted to, so he nodded, let it go.
“Ok, ok!” Cas’ shoulder was shaking with laughter under Dean’s cheek. “Let me rephrase: We both want each other around all the time so we can have our way with the other whenever we want. Better?”
“Pretty sure you never told him you loved him either…doesn’t make it any less true just because you hadn't told him yet, does it?”
“Oh my god, this is great, he’s going to be so happy to see you!” Taking one of the heavy bags from Sam, Cas gestured him back up the stairs, his heart racing with excitement for Dean.
The sun crested the horizon at the eye-watering time of 5:07am. Dean knew that for certain because he hadn’t slept at all. The lack of Cas’ warm heft on the other side of the bed, knowing that he was lying in his own bed directly beneath Dean’s, probably just as miserable and twice as angry, made for what had felt like an endless night.
“Sometimes things bloom because they have been well cared for. Fertilized, watered, planted in the right soil and treated to all the ideal conditions.”
Frozen, ears ringing, his brain sensed a major threat and ordered his adrenal glands into overdrive. Dean stared in utter shock at Sam, numb lips working to shape words.
“Mm, smells good.” Dean ignored the mild panic jittering its way into his knees and hands as he passed the top step, empty coffee mug still set to one side. Jack must have forgotten to pick it up.
He brushed ineffectually at some of the flour dusting his old Zeppelin t-shirt as he wrestled briefly with the tricky deadbolt. "Just a sec!"
“Jerk!” Sam replied, but the reflexive smile the old name-calling brought to his face faded in seconds.
And in the middle of all of that immense space was a dimly lit sprawl of limbs and trench coat that had Dean bolting across with his heart in his throat.
Dean poked at the saltshaker between them, inadvertently pushing too hard and knocking it over into the pepper grinder. He righted it with a muttered curse, splaying his anxious hands over his thighs instead, digging his fingers in to help him focus.
“Why just us?” she asked, sounding dazed and more than a bit ‘discombobulated’, as she put it. “How long have we been gone?”
And for a little while, at least, the awful, dense guilt was replaced by the blinding pleasure of the truly spectacular orgasm that Cas wrung out of him.
But musing about the satisfaction of a cold beer had apparently been enough to materialize one on the nightstand, drops of condensation conveniently evaporating just before staining the wood. With a jolt, Dean realized his musings had been enough for the temperature in the room to change to match the weather outside.
The dawning realization he was experiencing was mirroring the disappointed grimace forming on Gabriel’s face.
Turning to shake out her hair and check her makeup in the water-spotted mirror, she shrugged easily. “‘Course. If you’re not ready, you’re not ready, you know?”
Dean tried to guide Cas’ terrifyingly limp body toward the ground as carefully as he could, but damn, he had forgotten just how
Jack dropped something that made enough noise to draw Sam’s gaze away long enough for Dean to knock back the rest of the coffee and start rolling the empty mug between his palms as he propped his elbows on his knees.
He set the book down next to him, drawing up his knees as he let the ugly chenille squashiness of Dean’s couch engulf him. He had no idea what was going to come out of the conversation he was about to have with his boyfriend, but he reminded himself for the umpteenth time that whatever stress had been riding Dean so hard lately didn’t seem to have anything to do with their relationship.
There was no other home set up for Cas, no second bedroom. As it turned out, the house hadn’t actually been Dean’s; it had been for both of them all along. Apparently it was news to Jack that they hadn’t actually been
He put that distasteful thought out of his head as best he could, replacing it with thoughts of Cas instead. The distraction worked like a charm.
Even the muted roar of Baby’s engine in the little garage did nothing to lift his spirits. Running on autopilot, he hit the garage door opener, backed Baby expertly up the steep driveway in reverse, punched the button to close the garage after him, and pulled out onto the street, neatly dodging a handful of cyclists and moms with strollers already on their way to the park.
you, he told you so himself, and even though you might never admit it to yourself, you loved him like that, too. Is this how you’re going to honour what he did?
Dean had been the one to find the fire pit and decided that while muggy summer nights were great and all, what he really wanted right now was the sharp chill air of a late fall evening complete with a roaring fire. And, like a teenager giddy with his first crush, he wanted any excuse to see if Cas would let him get close again.
Dean gestured in a give-it-here motion, and then snagged a piece of his own bacon to crunch on, his appetite making a reappearance alongside his courage. Just acknowledging his worry, giving it voice, seemed to have diminished its power. Maybe there was something to the whole 'talk about your feelings' thing after all...
“Nooo,” Dean whined playfully, hooking his fingers into the vee of Cas’ vest, entranced by the promise of firm warmth under his hands. “Where are you going?”
“What the heck are you feeding him?” he asked his father incredulously, Sam grinning proudly, nearly bouncing on the balls of his feet.
It was savoury and flavourful on his tongue, a pleasant heat chasing it down his throat as he chewed and swallowed. The beans didn’t taste too overtly healthy, and the potato was starchy and a little sweet, and the bite was annoyingly well received by his howling stomach.
There didn’t really seem to be anything else to say. The moment drew out, and Dean felt when it turned from thoughtful to stifling. It was time.
Jack took his sweet time thinking that over, head still cocked, bird-like, to one side, eyes going a bit unfocused. Dean barely resisted the impulse to wave his hand in front of his face. Now that he had Jack here, and he hadn’t refused out of hand…he was so close he could practically taste it.
Sitting down next to him, Dean wanted so badly to lean into him, his warmth, his quiet strength, to hear Cas tell him that it was going to be ok, that they’d figure this out together and that everything was going to be alright.
part of Cas’ question went unspoken, but Dean took a deep cleansing breath and exhaled out every bit of doubt and lingering tension in his body as he just hugged Cas tighter.
Cas felt his heart rate pick up as he thought it through. Dread started edging out the relief at seeing Dean still there. “Then how are you still here?” Silence. “Dean? How are you here?”
“Sam’s on his way,” he said by way of explanation, tipping his face up to look at Cas. “Jack offered me to go and meet him. Up for a drive?”
“I told him,” Dean answered, rubbing his hands over his face, turning his eyes up to the ceiling. “He, uh, didn’t take it too well.”
, Sammy. Or do I need to remind you which one of us ended up with his hand superglued to the remote?”
Cas soon learned that, no matter how much a mechanic washes and scrubs, grease has a way of lingering in the smallest nooks and crannies of skin and that light-coloured bedding was just not a good idea. He gamely replaced it with a charcoal set instead, coaxing Dean into bed early one night to “try out the new duvet and let me know what you think ”. As it turned out, Dean quite liked the feel of it under him as he writhed, choking off moans into its warm softness, trying to keep it down lest Gabriel start banging at Cas’ door to complain about their “ungodly sex noises” again.
After doing the moving thing more than a few times, Dean considered himself a bit of a pro and by the time the overcast sky was fading into a murky sunset he had his furniture set up and all of his boxes unpacked.
“Here,” Jack offered, extending a hand but not coming any closer, like he sensed how close Dean was to grabbing Cas and hauling ass. “Let me take you both inside. We’ll get him settled, and I’ll explain.”
Sam leveled a long look at him, his lips tight against a well-deserved rebuke. Dean tilted his head a little, imploring him to let it go. They didn’t talk about feelings any more than necessary at the best of times, and Dean saw no reason to change that. Especially now, with Sam’s bombshell about Cas still ricocheting around in his brain like a damn bludger.
As far as he could tell, he was still in heaven. But if he was in heaven and Dean was still here with him…
Even still, running under it all was the faintest whiff of relief. Like eerie gunmetal grey clouds that threatened a thunderstorm, he had been watching for and dreading this moment for months, and now it was finally happening. Maybe, once the thundering devastation of the storm was over, just maybe there would be something good left in its wake.
A copy of his countersigned lease had been in the mailbox when he had arrived earlier along with a phone number and a message signed simply ‘C’ to call if he needed anything. A couple of takeout menus for what Dean assumed were decent local restaurants were tucked in between.
Dean had no idea that his new landlord would end up being his better-to-have-loved-and-lost when he first moved into 5406 Rue Saint-Zotique Est.
Gabe tacked on an exaggerated wink and a not-so-subtle head-to-toe glance that had Dean blushing as he withdrew his hand and gestured to the door set at a right angle to the one Gabe had popped out of.
“I don’t want Sam to be alone, but I can’t interfere too much.” He sighed. “One person isn’t a terrible amount of interference, I suppose. Do you want it to be you?”
The bed was empty, neatly made except for a rumpled stretch of duvet near the foot. It looked like it always did, but it felt soulless without Cas’ vibrant presence to bring it to life.
“Ok,” he said finally, and closed himself into the bathroom to wash off Cas’ scent for what he realized too late might be the last time. It was almost enough to make him walk right back out there and bite the damn bullet with their mingled scents still on his skin, but if Cas was going to end things he probably wouldn’t be feeling up to things like basic hygiene for a while, so probably best to get a shower in while he could.
He took one last step, bringing him face to face with Cas. “Well, for starters, I can promise you that I’ll talk to you when something’s wrong. I won’t lie or hide things from you. I won’t be good at it right away, and I’ll probably still mess up a few times, but I won’t stop trying.”
Cas wanted to tell his brother to dial it back, that they didn’t know for sure what was going on, that Dean loved him and wouldn’t have betrayed his trust like that.
“Love you, too, Cassie.” The response came easily, like they were words Gabriel always carried at the ready. “Drive safe.”
They grinned at each, oblivious to Gabe’s coughing and spluttering. He finally managed to gulp a couple of mouthfuls of beer, glaring daggers at Dean.
They stared at each other for a moment, just taking things in until Sam finally broke the silence with another question.
Back in his room he exchanged his robe for pajama bottoms that passed the sniff test and a ratty old Stanford sweatshirt he’d stolen from Sam years ago, added his warmest socks. Setting up his laptop with booze-clumsy fingers took a hot minute, but then: playlist set, headphones on, and with another couple of swigs out of the bottle (how had it ended up nearly half empty already?), he eased onto his bed and let his memory foam remember him.
When he got to work, he asked Bobby for the most routine stuff possible, stuff he could practically do with his eyes closed. He figured he could use the to figure out how he wanted to approach things with Sam. Bobby was more than happy to hand off the grunt work, and by the time Dean had worked his way through a couple of brake jobs and a handful of oil changes, he knew what he wanted to say.
There was a sizzling sound behind them, then the pop and boom of the first firework. The colours lit up Cas’ face and glittered in his eyes as he smiled. It was small, still a bit fragile, but genuine.
A derisive snort was not the response he had been expecting from Castiel, and he cracked up, wiping his hands on the kitchen towel he’d slung over one shoulder. When he looked over at Castiel, he was grinning, and
When the latch caught, it was swiftly followed by the clunk of the lock engaging and the clatter of the chain deadbolt being thrown.
Choking on his own emotions, Sam nodded jerkily. “I know. Me too. You’ve been the best brother anyone could have ever asked for. You deserve some happiness of your own now, though, ok?”
“Shut up, you said it smelled good.” Giving it a stir, Sam cranked up the heat under the pot of rice next to it. “Give it a try, at least—oh, don’t make that face. God, you’re such a child!”
Sammy, who complained in his daily texts and weekly calls about not even placing in the local science fair with his presentation about renewable energy options in rural communities (“It was rigged, Dean, I’m telling you!”), or bemoaning the dearth of anything fun to do (“All they do is go party in cornfields!”), while Dean was savouring the rush of finding out that Cas’ skin was golden all over and that he sometimes talked in his sleep.
Dean felt like his brain was trying to swim against a sluggish current of quicksand. He stared helplessly at his brother’s face like the answer to all of the questions he had ever refused to ask himself regarding the exact nature of his relationship with Cas was going to appear across Sam’s slightly shiny forehead.
Donna had popped in for a couple of days. She was ostensibly on her way to some vaguely described event, but Dean was pretty sure she was just checking up on them, probably at Jody’s request. She had parked herself at a library table with her laptop after breakfast, so she had a front row seat to Sam’s antics as he clutched at his chest, staggering over to a chair before throwing himself into it with the back of his hand to his forehead.
“Do you remember when you told me that story about your mom and how she would make you the most amazing apple pies whenever you had a special occasion?”
“All of it,” his brother said reluctantly, bracing a hand on either side of the doorjamb. “I’m sorry, Cassie. He’s an idiot.”
Sighing, Dean pinched at the bridge of his nose against the dull headache that was forming, before remembering he could just…not have one. The pounding in his temples ceased.
“Sorry, sorry.” He cleared his throat, forcing himself to look up at Cas. He was trying mightily to seem impassive, but the anxious flick of his eyes over Dean’s face gave him away.
“Well, I mean, that would have depended entirely on the kind of pie. I don’t put out for just anything, you know.”
This time, though, he had tried to be smart about it. Instead of taking a regular apartment with units to either side, across the hall, above and below, he had bugged Bobby for a long overdue pay raise and was hoping to splurge on the upper floor of a tidy little duplex not too far from Montreal’s Rosemont/La Petite-Patrie neighbourhood. It was an area in transition between its aging mostly Italian-immigrant population and young couples and families wanting to be near the city and trying to find a compromise between Montreal’s pervasive condos and unaffordable single family homes.
Gabriel looked at Sam’s big sad eyes and the earnest expression on his youthful face and sighed. “Goddammit, I’m going to have to try and convince my brother to give him another chance, aren’t I?”
He saw Jack’s face crumple, his head shaking a little with instinctive denial. Dean let the silence draw out while he took a couple of slow breaths through his mouth, trying to steady himself.
“Good run?” Donna called, poking her head into the control room to look up at them, struggling to bite back her grin when she caught sight of Dean two-handing his grip on the bannister as he navigated the stairs on shaking legs.
“Somehow I don’t doubt that,” he said finally, realizing he had been busy looking at Castiel’s shirt and grinning to himself like an idiot. “So, uh, listen, I'm making pizza for dinner. I’ve never allowed pineapple on it before, but if you want to stay for a slice and make your case, I’ll at least hear you out.”
I miss you, but knowing that you’re ok, that you’re with Cas, and Jack, and everyone, and that you’ll all be there when it’s my time, then I’m ok with being here on my own.
“So I’ve been told,” he said cheekily, turning to the freezer to dig out the vanilla ice cream, grinning at Cas’ little huff of amusement behind him.
For the first time since moving in, Dean wasn’t happy to be climbing those stairs. Each step was taking him further from what he wanted, which was to run right back down to Cas’ apartment and beg him for forgiveness, to be patient, to not give up on his disaster of a boyfriend while said boyfriend tried to figure out how to extract himself from the endlessly tangled web he’d woven.
Figuring a good way to get a reaction out of something that enjoyed utter silence, he smirked a little to himself and yelled, “
But even he heard the uncertainty in his voice. From everything Dean had told them about Sam, it seemed pretty unlikely that he’d forgotten to mention something as important as his brother being a raging homophobe.
Instead, they went through the list of films Dean deemed necessary to have seen for a well-rounded cultural experience, Dean shaking his head in despair as he added movie after movie to their to-watch list. Cas took it with good humour, retaliating with his own must-read list, Dean reluctantly conceding that he had about as much reading to do as Cas did movie watching. That circled them into a books versus movies debate that took them through the rest of their meal, both of them demurring when Angelo offered dessert and coffee.
Dean was abruptly reminded that, even though he was wise beyond his years sometimes, Sam was still only eighteen, but it drew a genuine smile out of him nonetheless. “Yeah. He took off to a friend’s place for a bit, didn’t take his phone.” He exhaled roughly. “His brother said he’ll let me know if he hears from him in the meantime.”
“I know,” Jack replied, shaking his head at Dean’s wordless offer for a beer of his own. “I actually came out to tell you that Sam will be arriving shortly.”
“Remember how it used to be with Bobby holding things down, acting as a—a kind of…hunter hub, I guess you could call it?”
his damn charger cable? He closed his eyes briefly and sighed; it was upstairs at Dean’s place, dangling from the plug on his side of the bed. Fuck.
It felt like hours before Jack sighed. “I suppose an exception could be made. I don’t like the idea of Sam being alone either.”
He’d been toying with the idea that he might not be as straight as he’d always assumed he was for a while, and the anonymity of a club in a city well away from where he lived seemed like a good place to confirm that hypothesis. The Village in Montreal was full of hotspots, so after wandering up and down the strip a few times, he made a choice and walked up to the entry of one of the clubs.
He had been keeping their Christmas plans deliberately vague, fully intending to tell his family he was down with the flu and cancel his visit at the last minute even though it meant he’d miss seeing Sam for the first time since the previous summer. He had also planned to tell Cas that Sam was the sick one to explain why they wouldn’t be going to see his family after all, and then schedule a quick visit to his dad and Sam on a weekend when he could confirm that Cas had some other plans.
The wail of an ambulance siren drew closer. Distractedly, Dean realized that it had been months since he’d noticed one. He focused on the up and down sounds until they crested and faded off as it passed.
His own grin had flagged but with that little nod, Dean felt it come back in full force. He decided that if Cas was brave enough to risk this, he could repay it by nutting up himself.
Forking up a bite of eggs, Sam shook his head. “No, of course not. But I’ll keep looking until I find something with better odds of success.” He chewed his mouthful, swallowed, did the same with a bite of toast, added in a sip of coffee.
Cas flung up a hand in a stay-back motion as he edged around his brother towards the door. “No...no, no hugging. If you hug me right now I’ll—I need to stay focused for the drive.”
“I caught Dean in a chatty mood one time,” Gabe replied. “He said that your dad was pretty checked out after your mom died. Sorry about that, by the way.”
Except that when he got back to the living room he realized that Cas was sitting there alone on the couch, Gabe nowhere to be seen.
“I’m not leaving here without you. I know it’s your grace, but Cas…in the bunker, when you summoned the Empty, you said that the thing that you wanted was something you thought you couldn’t have.”
He could tell Cas now, just ‘fess up and tell him what he’d done, explain why he’d done it, and then beg him for forgiveness. Cas loved him, Dean was sure of it, and if he loved Dean as much as Dean loved him, then there just
were pulsing hard and hot in the back of his throat and stinging the backs of his eyes, but Dean choked them back and aimed a cocky grin at Cas’ earnest face. He blindly shoved the tablet aside onto the coffee table in favour of pulling Cas on top of him.
Sounding incredulous, the Empty pressed its presence harder against Dean as if proximity might help it understand. “You’re insane.”
It took perhaps a dozen more rounds of breathing while tapping out the steady four beat rhythm against his knee before he didn’t feel like he was smothering in his own body anymore. The shaking took longer to subside. But it did, like it always did, and he roughly scrubbed at his damp face. Sweat: most definitely; tears:
Oh come on, that was the most romantic thing I’ve ever tried to say to another person and you call it—”
They didn’t talk much as they ate, but when the pizza had been mostly demolished, they relaxed back in their chairs, working through their second beers.
The strain of Dean’s secrets had started manifesting in nightly nightmares and a constant bubbling burn in his chest. He’d given up on thumbing individual Rolaids out of the little foil rolls a while back, and had committed to a Costco-sized container that he was practically popping by the handful, much to Cas’ concern.
I heard this song and immediately pictured it playing during Dean's awful, agonizingly slow death scene. Because my brain hates me apparently, I also ended up with the idea of Dean picturing Cas standing off behind Sam as a way to comfort himself in his final minutes. The guy had to be scared, right? Anyways, that set off the waterworks and I just BAWLED while I wrote out that part of Dean and Cas' talk in this chapter. There was originally more, but it was starting to drag so I reluctantly trimmed it back to try and improve the flow. But yeah...good luck listening to that song during the scene and if you manage to finish it without crying then I'd really like to know your secret!
Spotting that both their plates were empty, Dean seized a brief lull as Sam drained his water glass to dig around in his pocket. He dangled the Impala’s keys in front of his brother’s face with a hopeful “Shoot some pool in town?”
The worst part was that Dean had tried more than once to just tell him, to confess everything, desperate for relief from the grinding guilt. But every time he mustered his courage, managed to croak out a “Hey, Cas?”, and Cas looked at him with those incredible eyes, so open and trusting and warm, the stark terror of losing the privilege of being on the receiving end of that gaze paralyzed him. He’d usually end up making some offhand comment instead, steadfastly ignoring the disappointed little wrinkle Cas would get between his brows.
“Jack?” Dean asked, and Sam nodded. “Well, if you can find those ingredients I’ll see about getting in touch with our wayward kid.”
Cas just sighed. “I know I disturbed your “eternal rest”,” his fingers even came up to do the air quotes, “but this is particularly cruel, even for you.”
Thoughtfully, Jack looked off towards the Impala in the driveway and the road beyond it. “So you want to go back?” He looked back at Cas, then at Dean. “I swore I wouldn’t interfere like Chuck did. You told me how important that was, to let humanity be free.”
That actually got a half-smile out of the health nut. “Keep it up, and I’ll switch out the meat for that vege-beef again next time I make chili.”
Sam’s head was cocked to one side and he had an odd expression on his face that Cas couldn’t quite place. “Is Dean…here?”
“Right, sorry. I don’t know how much Dean’s told you guys about our family, but he spent a lot of time taking care of me after our mom died. She was sick for a long time, and then once she died our dad never really got over it, you know?”
Switching over to speaker mode, Cas put Anna’s phone down next to him so he could drop his head into his hands. It was easier to think with his eyes shut.
Pulling off at the nearest gas station, he found it deserted, a box of chocolate bars spilled onto the floor by the display; it looked like someone had disappeared in the middle of restocking.
Dean wanted to prod at him a little, maybe try to rouse him, but Jack had said he’d wake up when he was ready. There was the rest of the house to explore, but Dean found himself reluctant to risk having Cas wake up alone and disoriented, so he settled for getting up and poking around the bedroom.
goddamn tears; there would be time for that later. Sam and Jack’s combined gazes were weighty; they had probably already guessed, but needed to hear it from him.
“I’m just messing with you,” he said gently. It wasn’t what he’d planned to say. He’d opened his mouth to offer some smooth line or flippant remark, but this was Cas and he deserved an honest answer to his adorably flustered line of questioning even if it made Dean’s stomach seize and his palms sweat.
With a gesture towards the hallway just beyond his room, Cas tried to order his thoughts, hoping that explaining what had happened to a third party might help him make some sense out of it.
Blissed out on post-orgasmic hormones, Dean chuckled tiredly, rubbing his sweaty cheek against Cas’ equally sweaty shoulder. “I guess I’ll just have to quit my job to carry you around all the time then.”
“Jesus, save it for St-Catherine’s Street,” Dean commented finally, bouncing his balled up napkin off Gabriel’s forehead.
The silence was broken by a shuddering gasp as Cas inhaled, his eyes finally closing as he absorbed the blow.
amenable, so amenable in fact, that he completely forgot to ask Cas what he’d thought of the movie until they were in the middle of peeling potatoes together the next day under Gabriel’s knowing gaze.
She was an attractive woman and—anyone-but-Chuck help him—he loved the sloping curves of waists and hips, and the incomparable pleasure of sliding into slick, welcoming heat, watching breasts of all shapes and sizes jiggle, getting his hands deep into silky long hair as soft lips worked him…
“Maybe he’ll finally consider moving closer,” Dean said, crossing his arms and leaning into the doorframe. He could practically feel a timer running in his head, urging him to hurry, to get downstairs to Cas as quickly as possible, but he held himself back with a firm hand. He
A siren wailed by, the sound cresting and falling increasingly loudly until it passed. Gabe pursed his lips and gave him a
Sam actually looked remorseful. “I’m sorry…I wasn’t trying to imply that you don’t want to help him, but Dean, if there’s a chance—”
Gabe grinned cheekily back at him periodically as he pointed out the main bedroom to one side of the hallway with its window looking out over the front balcony, and the enormous coat closet between it and the good sized eat-in kitchen, which looked out over the back balcony and the backyard.
Time to double down. Sam spared a second for a quick prayer to anyone still listening that he and his brother would still be on speaking terms after what he was about to say.
“Hmm.” Unimpressed, Dean turned his fork to his food. No sense in facing whatever idea Sam had cooked up on an empty stomach. And his arteries were perfectly fine, dammit.
It hadn’t been a particularly warm month, so they hadn’t yet turned on the AC. Even with the windows open it was quiet, kids still in school until the end of the week. There was nothing to break up the weighty silence as condensation slowly started to form on the bottles.
“Patience, Dean. I never put out on the first date, but we can neck like horny teenagers later if you can keep your hands to yourself for the duration of the movie.”
“I guess we’ll see,” Dean said vaguely, then clapped his hands together, feigning enthusiasm. “So, listen, I’m just gonna run down to bring Cas his book that he left up here, and then we’ll figure something out for dinner, maybe see if there are any fireworks happening tonight?”
“It’s kind of like that. Everyone who didn’t come back was someone who had died, or originated from another universe, someone who didn’t really belong here by normal standards.”
“I was trying to show him some photos of Bruce, but he kept swiping and he saw a picture from your Christmas party of me and Anna, and he just assumed that was my girlfriend and…I didn’t correct him. So when he showed up here today, he had no idea why my landlord was hanging out in my living room, because to him that’s what you are. He doesn’t know about you…he doesn’t know we’re together.”
Dean looked surprised by the pained gasp that escaped Cas at the escalator comment. How could Dean have thought he’d be sent to Hell? “I’m…so sorry I wasn’t there for you.”
Dean held out his hand for him, and Cas crossed to him with familiar ease, letting Dean tug him in to perch on the armrest of the rocking chair.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Oh, come on, like I’d be unrolling a pride flag in front of you knowing how you feel about it?”
Sam had been casting him increasingly weighty looks and had even gone so far as to open his mouth a couple of times, only to stop himself like he had thought better of it, and look out the window instead.
Aside from slinking out of his room in the wee hours to scavenge a peanut butter sandwich that he ate standing over the sink, and to gulp a few mouthfuls of icy water straight from the tap, Dean didn’t show his face until well into the next day.
Dean trimmed his scruff but didn’t go full cleanly shaven because he knew that he looked best that way, and not at all because Cas had made a comment once about liking a bit of stubble on a guy. He neatened his hair but didn’t go too heavy on the product, thinking with a nearly painful jab of nerves that if Cas got his fingers into it, he didn’t want the guy getting his hands all mucked up with styling paste.
“I’ll bear that in mind,” Cas forced out a little breathlessly. Dean knew how he felt; he was helplessly turned on and fuck, it’d been so long since he’d—
There was a pause. Cas picked at the edge of his beer’s label, cheeks gone a bit rosy. Taking a guess about the possible origin of Cas’ discomfort, Dean felt like a dick.
Shooting him a Look, Cas turned back to the window and his contemplation of the occasional flash of grey fur from the squirrel nest in the branches of the tree out front.
Who the hell was this guy’s brother, Dean wondered, and it occurred to him that maybe he needed to consider if this was all too good to be true.
I also try not to bounce around POVs too much when I'm writing, but in this chapter we get a brief switch to Sam's POV in the section that starts with "Dean was still chuckling" and carries through to the end of this chapter (in case it wasn't clear!)
“Oh,” he breathed, stepping forward toward the rough-hewn plank and stone cabin set back into the trees. Chimneys ran up either side, promising future picture-postcard moments of smoke curling up against a fall background of vividly coloured leaves, or maybe even some snow-covered evergreens.
It was silent for a long moment as Dean absorbed everything. Sam let it play out, figuring Dean had some serious recalibrating to do, but sooner than he expected, his brother shook his head with a little laugh.
“Cas is gone,” he said bluntly, staring right into Dean’s wide eyes, ignoring the shocked suck of air around the hand he still had over his mouth. “It’s awful and you must be in a lot of pain, but you are
