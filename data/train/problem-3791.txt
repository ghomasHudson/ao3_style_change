“And leave my baby all alone? Sorry Cas, I can’t do that to her,” said Dean as they made their way into the car. “You’re going to learn to love her just like everybody else. Just wait and see.”
"Not when you drizzle it with rum
“Castiel,” the man corrected softly before adding, “or Cas, as you seem to enjoy calling me. I insist.” The last part left no room for negotiation, and then he turned around without another word, leaving the door open.
“In the woods? What-- how?”
“No,” Dean shook his head quickly, “I do want. I just… what if they hate me?”
“I don’t think there anything we can do,” interrupted Dean. “I mean, you have met principal Crowley, you can’t reason with him. You’d most likely end up making some kind of deal with Crowley that we couldn’t get out of. Besides, John has been trying to get that job for years. He’s not going to give it up without a fight.” Dean shrugged, looking down at his hands folded in his lap. “It could be worse. I’m only stuck with him for two months, not forever.”
“Just eat it,” Dean quipped back, taking a huge bite of his.
Dean gulped. “Well then, what are we waiting for? Let’s get this show on the road.” Internally smirking, Dean lowered his voice on purpose and leaned forward to whisper in Cas’ ear, “Fuck me, Cas. Fuck me so hard that I feel it for the rest of the week.”
‘Payback is a bitch, Charlie’ thought Dean as he picked in his reply.
“Ohh, what? You’re gonna out me, too? Just like you did to Dean? News flash, asshole, everyone knows I’m gay.”
“Yeah, Coach Turner needed some time off, so the school decided to ask ‘dear old, Dad’ to teach all of Coach’s classes,” replied Dean, his voice so low that Mary almost missed it.
“No, I wouldn’t,” he answered honestly, reaching for Dean. He didn’t need to be told twice. Dean scrambled up to his knees; he would’ve been embarrassed with how desperate he seemed, but Cas knew, he knew exactly what he did to him. He blanketed himself over Cas’ body, knees on either side of Cas’ hips, and claimed Cas’ mouth with his own, taking back control.
Showing up ten minutes late for class earned him a lecture about punctuality, but thankfully no extra detention. After listening to Mr. Ketch go on and on about the importance of being on time, Dean finally got to go sit down next to Charlie in the back.
When Castiel brought he and Sam a gift, signed from Fergus and Anna, Dean immediately felt panic rise. "I didn't get them anything," he hissed to Castiel, trying to smile in case they were looking at him.
“What? No!” he said, as he took his eyes off the road to look at her. “The photo, look at the photo.”
Cas nodded as they switched places and reached in to grab the large blue beach blanket. “We’re going on a picnic?” he asked as Dean bumped the door shut with his hip and reached out for Cas’ hand.
“You’re a good man, Dean Winchester.”
The doorbell rang, causing Castiel to shut the fridge before reaching over to squeeze Dean’s shoulder. Dean blew out a breath and trailed after him through the hall to the front door.
Dean smiled, snuggling back as Cas settled beside him, Dean pressed back against his chest. Cas sighed happily and Dean was suddenly struck with how he’d originally thought Sam was rushing things between him and Luc. But, lying next to Cas, listening to his breathing even out and settle, feeling warm and safe…  he kind of understood the appeal.
“Well, he said he was going to leave you alone if I helped him. So, I did. I didn’t plan on starting to like him,” answered Charlie.
“Right?” Dean agreed, stabbing a large bite with his fork and scraping the bite through the chocolate drizzle on the plate. “I’m not usually big on the cream pies, but this?” Dean raised his fork and took he bite, nodding his head as he chewed. “It’s one of the best.”
After couple of minutes and a lot of banging around, which made Dean wonder what the hell they were doing in there, the two of them finally joined them back at the dining table. Luc was carrying what Dean was fairly certain had once been his perfectly,
“Yes,” Castiel answered, looking back at the tree in front of them. “I have never had a tree before, actually. Not since I was a child, and my father always bundled all of us up and took us into the forest at the edge of the property.” He looked around the area slowly and gave Dean a small smile as he met his eyes. “The idea of a tree lot with hot drinks is much more appealing, now that I’m thirty.”
fault.
better without eyebrows. Though but I swear, he slept with his bedroom door locked until he was in his twenties. Whenever he stays at my place, I’m sure he locks the door and brings his own shampoo.”
“Help!”
“What?” and “He tried to do what?” sounded all over the room at the same time Benny said, “Shut up, Jo!”
“-- fantasize and -- wait.” Dean paused, eyebrow raised as he studied his little brother’s face. Sam looked anxious, scared even, and was desperately seeking approval. “I know we haven’t been together all that long but, Dean, it feels
Being hit on by Sam Winchester was just wrong in so many ways.
“Of course it isn’t!” Amelia said softly, dropping down and sitting close to Castiel’s side.
Pulling up to his house, Dean turned off the car and turned his full attention towards Clarie. “I can ask Cas about it, if you want.” All he got back was a small nod before, Clarie got out of the car.
Dean huffed frustratedly. “Is that your professional advice, to be cold-hearted?”
“Hmmm, I guess you haven't been good,” he said, hanging his stethoscope back around his neck, then picking up Castiel’s notes and reading them.
"Grab the bacon?" Cas replied, picking up a large, towering platter of French toast. Gabriel breezed by them and grabbed maple syrup, butter, a shaker of powdered sugar, and a can of Christmas tree sprinkles. Dean shouldn't have been shocked - he'd seen the way the man decorated his cocoa the night before, and yet he raised a brow as he watched the man place the sprinkles and sugar in front of his own plate first.
about how awesome Castiel had been to get Dean the Impala for the night. The only thing Dean left out was how hard it was to return it to Bobby’s the day after.
With a “You were gonna be gay for me?!” Dean jumped on top of Benny and whispered in his ear, “Do you still have it?”
“Can’t argue with that,” Dean smirked as he laid down on the bed.
Castiel was visibly relieved to hear that, and the smile that had disappeared for the short period of time was back. Dean had to admit that he was curious about whether there was something more to Cas’s coming out story or not. “So… would you like to go out with me sometime? On a real date?” asked Castiel, and even though he had been nothing but confidence earlier that day at school when he talked about taking Dean on a date, he sounded nervous now. Like Dean could ever be stupid enough to turn him down.
Cas’ lips were hot against Dean’s and he couldn’t catch his breath.
“You look happy.”
Dean collapsed against Cas’ chest, breathing hard. Cas’ hands moved up, smoothing over Dean’s back as his legs slipped out and laid flat against the blanket. Dean’s chest was rising and falling in time with Cas’ his head felt light and fuzzy, but he felt so damn loved. He wanted this, for the rest of his life.
So they cleaned up, whisking away all trace of the upacking spree, and Castiel put the pictures back into the box without lingering over it. When they were done, it was the very picture of a home.
“You want to know what happened between us?”
They heard an out of breath Dean said, “Ohh, god Castiel, this is so good!” through the door. “More! I need more.”
The walk to the car was pure agony. The other boys supported most of his weight, carrying him the entire way to the car, and helping him into the backseat. Castiel slid in beside him, helping Dean get comfortable leaning against him.
It took everything in his power to bite his tongue and nod without glaring. Of course, Jo had to open her mouth. Dean loved her like a sister, but there were times he wished she would just let things go and not make a big deal out of them, especially when Dean suffered for it.
Winchesters had something to do with the article not getting published, but it didn’t take a genius to put two and two together. They had taken away an amazing opportunity for his mom to get ahead, build them a better life, instead leaving Mary nearly drowning in debt. So, yeah, Dean considered changing his name if only to escape the shame of being associated with that family. He’d gone back and forth for weeks but finally was set in his resolve. Why should he have to change any part of who he was? It was what the Winchesters really wanted, after all. But it was
Sorry for the delay! The original assigned author backed out on the day of posting, so it was a quick scramble to get this chapter done! This chapter was cowritten by Dani & Cas (lotrspnfangirl & CassondraWinchester). We hope you enjoy this chapter!!
“Charlie, I’m not really feeling a drink right now. I’d rather just go home and crawl into bed,” Dean argued, allowing her to lead him through the hallway to the elevator. They were thankfully the only ones on it because she crowded him against the back wall, wrapping her arms around his waist and plastering her to his chest.
Dean Winchester was a normal 16-year-old boy. He lived in a small town with his mom, Mary, in a small apartment over her cafe shop. Well, cafe slash bookstore, if he were to be specific. There were books everywhere in the shop, so many that Dean was sure his mom owned more than the school's library. Not that Dean had ever
Would Lucifer be the same?
“Tonight.”
“He also dies! Without getting his happily ever after.”
“Likewise,” Dean replied, giving her a smile before nodding at Claire. Claire was now standing on the ground, but had her arm linked through her uncle’s, tugging him forward.
It’s finally here! Sorry for the wait, I want to say it won’t happen again, but I would probably be lying.
Sam is the only person down here, looking nervous and hopeful, sitting at the only table without chairs stacked on it. When he sees Dean, he breaks out into a huge smile, and Dean’s heart aches. He flicks his eyes back at the stairway. He could still make a break for it.
“Yeah, you’re right. It will take me about an hour…” she trailed off and Castiel could hear the revving of her engine. “No, make that half an hour, before I get back to town. Can you stay with him until then? I will be there as soon as I can.”
Dean blinks, aware that he’s smiling like a moron, but unable to really stop it. Sam punches him in the arm. “Well, now that I know you’re interested in him, you should probably ask Cas out. I think he has an enormous crush.”
Dean really didn’t know how to answer that, and a part of him didn’t even want to answer. What Castiel had said last night had hurt, even though Castiel had never meant to hurt his feelings. Like hearing how he meant absolutely nothing to the Winchester, that not even Sam's best friend knew he existed. Being friends with someone who was Sam’s friend was never going to work. He really should just cut all ties now, before it would get any harder.
"Quit overthinkin' it!" The old man scowls.
“Why? What happened now? Do we need to go kick some ass for you?” asked Jo as she played with a plastic knife from the cafeteria.
“I hope I’m not overstepping…” Castiel started, but Sam finished for him.
“Hi babe. Missed me already?” asked Cas when he picked up and Dean could hear someone make kissing noises behind him before Castiel excused himself. “Sorry about that. My brother is an idiot.”
“Sorry,” said Dean sheepishly, “I know that, I just--”
“Yeah, and we did
up a little." Bobby joins him, reaching up with his cane to poke at the tree. "Bring it up to here."
“Oh,” said Claire quietly. After looking at the photo a little longer, she closed the wallet and handed it back. Dean noticed she handled it a lot more gently now than she did when he first handed it over. “I’m sorry.”
He looked so lost and small that Dean couldn’t stand it any more. He knelt in front of Cas’ chair, enveloping him in a warm, sweet hug. Cupping Castiel’s cheek in one hand, Dean kissed him gently.
together, and the history of your friends, you should understand why you’re here.”
“No,” Claire answered with a sigh, “he would’ve sent me to my room and made me, like, write lines or something.”
“Of course it is.” Balthazar soothes. “But here’s the thing. Castiel left this here,” Seemingly out of nowhere, he produces a brown leather satchel that Dean intany recognises. It was sitting on the chair in Castiel’s room, just out of reach, every time he’d visited. “And he’ll be frightfully annoyed if he doesn’t have his notes with him at home. I told him he should be recuperating and not overworking himself but…” Balthazar shrugs and holds the satchel out to Dean. “You wouldn’t mind dropping this off for him on your way home, would you?”
to me. Maybe
Sadly the computer was off, otherwise she would have risked it and looked at what John Winchester had hiding in there. It wouldn’t have taken her long, but she couldn’t turn it on and risk being caught in there. As she turned to leave, she noticed an old leather jacket had been flung over a chair shoved into the corner. Just barely noticeable was a book sticking out of the inside pocket.
“Sam, it’s okay,” Castiel whispered, squeezing Sam’s hand tightly. Sam nodded, grateful, and released Cas’ hand to reach for the pink plastic water pitcher. Castiel nodded and Sam picked up an empty styrofoam cup, pouring himself half a glass to sip on.
"Here's to family," Castiel said back, clinking their mugs together.
Cas blinked in slight confusion, seeing Balthazar leaning against the doorway of the office. “Um… nothing,” Cas answered quickly.
Somehow, in the short time he had known Sam, Luc had managed to bring back that spark Sam lost after Eileen died.
“Me casa, su casa,” Dean said with a smile.
The heat from the sun was the first thing he was aware of, a fine sheen of sweat decorating his skin. He almost resisted the urge to throw the blanket off; he was still comfortable enough that sleep was still possible… Then, he heard the sound that woke him to begin with.
“It’s homemade and it looks delicious. You’re your own worst critic.” Castiel pushed him back gently and shooed him out of the kitchen. “Alright, we only have about an hour until we have to leave. You need to shower and get out of your scrubs.”
Before Dean drove home, he opened the glove compartment to check what Bobby had left him. He wasn’t remotely surprised to find a pack of condoms.
“You know can’t take your medicine on an empty stomach, Cas.” Dean scolded. “Do you have any soup?”
been thinking. Not really. He shouldn’t be allowed to make plans right after having mind blowing sex. Or before sex, to be perfectly honest. Which kind of put a damper on the whole sex at work thing.
"We needed more space, you know, so
“I couldn’t help but notice your young doctor arriving the same time as you.” Balthazar smirked.
“So close, Cas!” Dean gasped, slurring with the arousal pumping inside of him. “G’nna c’m on just your cock baby, sfat n hard, it’s fillin me up com’letely!”
“Yeah, lets go,” he said with a smile that hopefully didn’t give away how nervous he was. Apparently it didn’t work.
Castiel gave a small laugh, cupping Dean’s cheek and lifting his head to kiss him softly before placing a hand against his chest.  “Lay back and enjoy,” Castiel cooed as he playfully pushed Dean back.
“Okay, spill, now!” said Charlie, who had totally forgotten the game she had been playing against Benny and her half of the screen now had a big Game Over across it.
“You’re not on the clock, Dean.”
Apparently, Sam and Cas had worked out whatever it was that had been going on between them and were now spending every waking hour together. And Sam was not taking the fact that he had to share Castiel well.
“Yeah, I understand. He’s your friend and we are just…” What exactly were they? They hardly knew each other so they couldn't be friends. Classmates, maybe?
“Yeah, I know. I have just been really busy.” Dean gave him a small smile and then cleared his throat. “In fact I need to go,” he said as he started gathering his stuff before standing up. “See you later!”
“Ohh, I’ll help with the research. It’s not that I don’t trust you, but I don’t trust you, Sam!” said Charlie as she closed Sam’s folder and passed it back to him.
“She seems to like the idea,” said Castiel with a little frown on his face, “But don’t worry, I will only use positive reinforcement in the future.”
- Supernatural -
“I would like to be your friend, but I don’t see how that’s going to work out. Sam and I really won’t get along and I can't see Sam being willing to share you with me.”
“I just hope you like one of them,” Dean answered back, pulling out of the parking lot and onto the road back towards the garage. The conversation on the ride was pleasant and comfortable, much like their first ride and through dinner. By the time they arrived back, Dean had Castiel laughing so hard he had tears in his eyes.
“She was smart and witty and beautiful,” Sam explained, a soft smile on his face. “She had so much life and positivity, it drove both me and my brother mad. That’s how I got into interpreting services, too. Eileen was deaf, and meeting her sparked something new in me.”
Dean looked over to the passenger seat, the glow of the driveway lights illuminating the front seat of the car. Cas’ brow was furrowed, and it took a moment for Dean to realize his fingers were gone from his leg, and Dean wasn’t even hard anymore. How on earth did they even make it back to Cas’ place? Dean couldn’t even remember.
"Was he at least wearing pants?" Castiel asked as he pulled the blankets back and sat up, slipping his feet into his slippers. He glanced up to see Sam slowly shaking his head and started laughing again. "Well, that was Gabriel's Christmas wake up call, of course. If it helps any, it means breakfast and coffee is ready. He woke us all up once before the coffee was done and I was
.” He emphasises the final word partly out of spite to remind Balthazar that he isn’t the only qualified physician in this conversation but also to remind himself. And convince himself that he wasn’t only checking in on Castiel to see how cute he is, that his visit had an actual
Since Missouri kept an eye on both Charlie and Jo for the rest of the class, they didn't have a chance to ask Castiel if he would come to movie night. Their decision to wait until class was over did not work out like they hoped. When the bell finally rang, Castiel was obviously in a hurry since he had already packed his stuff and was out of his chair.
After Sam agreed to meet her the next day she ran out of the library. Sam waited at the table for a few more minutes, slowly zipping up his backpack before standing up and walking out the back entrance of the school. Lucifer and Alistair were both there waiting for him.
They all hold out their tulips. Ellen sniffles. "Go on, boy," she tells him.
Instead of pulling out, Cas pushed deeper into Dean's mouth, and
“What makes you say that?”
Cas snorted. “Balthazar, please. I refuse to dignify that with an answer.”
I just want to say "Huge thanks to lotrspnfangirl for helping me and making my stories great!" and all leftover mistakes are mine.
Dean and Sam had come over to Cas' place to spend Christmas with his family, and somehow, none of the guests left afterwards; so Dean was surprised to see that out of so many people, he was the first one to be awake. Smiling to himself, Dean started the coffee machine, letting the pot fill up, as he took out the ingredients to make everyone eggs and hash browns for breakfast.
The doorbell rang at exactly seven, and if Dean almost fell over his own two feet to get to the door, then there was nobody around to prove that. Except for his mom, but she didn’t count. Trying to not look too excited, Dean stopped and took a deep breath before opening the door.
Castiel sat up, cackling, hands raised in victory, “Hahaha! Take that! I win!”
“That’s because it is a coffee shop. The books are just
“Thanks, man!” said Dean as he handed over the keys to Cas’s car. “Everything should be alright now, but if you notice anything wrong just let me know and I will take another look.”
Dean cupped his hand against Cas’ cheek, caressing the scruff with his thumb. Cas’ pink tongue darts out to taste. Pulling the tip into his mouth and sucking, Dean can’t help the groan that escapes his lips.
"I'll get it!" Charlie jumped up from where she had been laying on the couch, scaring the crap out of Dean in the process (not that he would ever admit that).
“And would you have answered?” She pins him with a penetrative stare. “I doubt it. You’ve got better things to do these days. Oh,
with the most bizarre looking D. Dean saw the recognition come over the side of Sam’s face. He knew the other Winchester realized that underneath the new name had been a Sam. Sam turned and came face to face with his 'brother'.
While both an exaggeration and Doctor Novak being a beautiful man, there was no reason why Dean shouldn’t have been able to control his libido around him. For fucks sake, he has to work with the man. Granted, it wouldn’t be everyday they saw each other once Castiel was well...
Dean led them over to a bench along the far wall and gestured for Cas to sit. He knelt down and gently laid his hands on Cas' thighs. "I know we haven't known each other all that long. But from what I've seen and what Sam's said, this isn't you. So talk to me. What's up?"
“There’s no need for knives,” Castiel said with a sigh, looking up and adding, “Charlie, sit back down. That’s just going to make everything worse.” He gripped her hand in order to stop her, then turned his head to look back at Jo. “Just let the police handle this. We don’t even know if Sam had anything--”
Dean reached across the table to put a hand on top on Cas’s to try to stop him. “Dude, don’t worry about it. It’s fine, really. The gang and I have done this a million times.” Okay, that wasn’t exactly true, but what’s one little lie gonna do?
"Five minutes, man. Just five minutes. I'm at the corner of Elm. There's an accident in front of me, but it's almost completely cleared up."
“Isn’t it better to sit in the front?” asked Castiel, glancing to the high top tables but following after Dean, “That way we won’t miss anything?”
“Fuck, Cas,” Dean whispered against his lips, chasing another kiss as Cas pulled back to hover over Dean’s body. Cas smirked at him, kissing his way down Dean’s neck as his fingers twisted in the hem of Dean’s shirt. He gripped the ends, pulling it away from Dean’s body so he could feel skin, and yanked Dean up to pull it from his head.
Dean wasn’t really paying any attention to what the Coach was saying at this point since he knew he that his name would be last. Having a last name that starts with ‘W’ had its advantages and disadvantages. Instead, he found himself busy watching John who was standing slightly behind the Coach with a smug smile plastered on his face.
“You were the only one that hadn’t figured it out. I’d always figured Ash would be the last one,” said Charlie with her tongue sticking out in concentration. “It was kind of funny, when you think about it.”
“Like a date?” asked Charlie, with the biggest grin on her face, and if Dean didn’t know any better he would say she was more excited about it than he was.
“Look at your shirt, dumbass.”
"Great! Thanks, mom!" Jo called out over her shoulder as she dragged Dean in the direction of the back room. The back room of The Roadhouse was often used for private parties or small gatherings. It had a private entrance, a small kitchen area (staff only, but that had never stopped them from using it), and two bathrooms. Because the room was usually used for dance parties, the floor was kept clear of all furniture-- which wasn’t the greatest set up for TV watching.
“Yes!” Castiel cried out as Dean added a third finger and grazed his prostate. He claimed Dean’s lips, panting against them as he started to grind down on Dean’s fingers. “So good,” he groaned as Dean struck that special spot over and over. “Fuck me, I’m ready.” Castiel clutched Dean’s shoulders as his dick twitched between them. “Get your boxers off now, I wanna ride your cock, Dean.”
Dean almost melted when he tasted the pie. It was by far the best pie he had ever tasted! If the sounds he was making were the same as the sound from his favorite porn film, then he didn’t give a flying fuck. His bad mood was gone and as far as Dean was concerned, the only thing that mattered right now was finishing his slice, then finding Gabriel and marrying him. It took Dean a little time to realize that everybody at the table had stopped what they had been doing and were now laughing at him.
He drove them in circles for a good two hours, picking random exits and back roads, never going too far from home, just far enough to make Cas forget his day. The longer they drove and the more they sang, the more Cas relaxed. Instead of the ridged posture he'd had when he got in the car, he now sat half-turned toward Dean, left leg tucked under him, sprawled back against the door, head tipped back and eyes closed, fingers tapping out a rhythm on his thighs as he sang to
Dean was so shocked that he actually stopped on the spot and the person behind him walked right into him. Dean didn’t even notice who it was when he apologized.
From the shocked look that came across Sam’s face, it was quite clear that Sam did not expect her to know that. The look was only there for a moment before Sam managed to mask it, but it was too late, Charlie had already seen it.
“...good jobs with your teams today Mr. Novak and Mr. Heyerdahl,” came John’s voice as everyone made their way towards the doors to the changing rooms, Dean and his friends trailing behind. “Miss Harvelle and Mr. Lafitte you need to practice teamwork better, you let both of your teams down.”
Cas stomps the snow and mud from his boots on the welcome mat as he enters Winchester Auto. He pulls his hat off and nods to Ash behind the counter.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you,” apologized Castiel before looking down on Dean’s drawing again. “Why… why are you drawing a devil’s trap?”
Clarie had almost gone through everything in the cabinet and the pile next to her was reaching her height. Something told Dean that that wasn’t the leave behind pile. “I think your nieces is looking for a way into Narnia. So fifteen minutes? Twenty tops.”
“Me? Never!” said Charlie with mock offense. “You’re welcome for the pie, by the way!”
Castiel smiled and leaned over, kissing Dean's cheek before grabbing a bathrobe from the bathroom door. "Take your time," he said to them both, Sam shifting to the side to let him pass, "I'll meet you both in the kitchen."
Dean’s hips thrust upward meeting him, driving his cock deeper and Castiel moaned when the head of Dean’s cock hit his prostate once again. Castiel squeezed his eyes shut as his head tilted back and he cried out in sheer unadulterated pleasure.
over att Tumblr) was awesome enough to offered to help, so it’s all thanks to her that you are getting this now, please go thank her for me. She’s has been super helpful and made this much better.
and the second
“Not by blood, no. My father married Naomi when I was around three years old and he adopted her two sons. They took up our name right away.” From the look on his face, Castiel didn’t seem to like that little fact very much.
Dean couldn’t read the expression Cas was giving him, but he was sure that his silent freak had just been the biggest cock block in the universe, and he was going to be fired even without fucking his boss.
It was almost like he was back at work, except without all the grease and the dust. And, of course, the fantastic company.
Before Dean could tell them to shut the hell up, “Castiel!” was heard called out over the room. Dean, Castiel, and Benny all had to turn around to see Sam standing on the other side of the room and he did not look happy.
Castiel kissed the top of Dean's head and curled back around him, snuggling into the warmth his boyfriend's body had to offer. As he started to drift off, he thought of Jimmy and how Jimmy definitely would've approved of Dean, and he sent up a silent prayer that next Christmas would be just like this.
“Oh, thank god, yes!” moaned Dean as he took the first sip of the black elixir of life, everything else just faded into the background. “Wait, what did you just say?” he tried to ask but Claire was already gone.
hated it there, Mom,” Dean argued, placing his fork down on the side of his plate. This wasn’t the first time this had come up and Dean was sure it wouldn’t be the last. “Plus, your shop and all our friends are here. We can’t just leave.”
“Yeah,” Dean whispered back, afraid to break the quiet spell between them. He lifted his head enough to find Cas’ lips, aiming for a gentle kiss. But Cas felt good; he was warm, his body heavy where it pressed against Dean in all the right places. His five o’clock shadow scratched against Dean’s chin as Cas kiss him breathless, their mouths and tongues moving together. Then, Cas scraped his teeth against Dean’s bottom lip, biting the flesh softly before slipping his tongue back into Dean’s mouth. Dean heard himself moan, the sound swallowed in Cas’ mouth.
he thought to himself. When Dean noticed there was no pie left and all of his other friends were too busy stuffing their faces, he said, “That was the last piece! Aren't you going to have any?”
The knot in Dean’s stomach loosened, but he didn’t say anything, just waiting. Watching Castiel as he played with the mug of cocoa.
*throws in Christmas fluff*
Dean could hear Cas as he cleared his throat before asking, “How long till you get back?”
You take that back right now Dean Winchester or I swear I will kill you and I won’t use tomato sauce to do it this time!.
“Merry Christmas,” Dean echoed, waving at the kids in the backseat before clapping Sam on the shoulder. “Get back to work, bitch.”
“Yeah, absolutely!” said Sam as he reached for his bag and got his folder. He quickly flipped through it and when he found what he was looking for, he turned the folder over and passed it over to Charlie. “Here is everything I have gotten from her in the past.”
a bitch.
doing here?"
Bobby's expression softens and he lays his hand on Dean's arm. "You really think everybody woulda went along with it if we thought he'd hate it?"
To be honest, Dean didn’t really pay any attention to the movie. He was way too busy watching Cas. In his defense, Castiel kept looking at him when Sam wasn’t talking in his ear. Which wasn’t that often anymore since Charlie kept telling Sam to be quiet and watch the movie. If there had been any doubt about Castiel fitting in, it was gone. He was just as much a geek as the rest of them, even more so than Benny and Jo.
They were all love sick puppy dogs, but who could blame them? Apparently, the Novaks and the Winchesters just clicked.
Before she knew it, she had asked Sam, “Are you reading the ‘A Song of Ice and Fire’ series?”
Dean could see right away that it was a part of the Supernatural series. Dean had
Cas shook his head. "I'm not a very good singer."
Cas cocked his head to the side and reached out. He ran his hand up the inside of Dean's thigh. "How about we head back to your place and fuck like bunnies until we can't stand?"
Since Dean still hadn’t told his friends about his date with Castiel, he said, “Yeah, and he didn’t even freak when he found out. Unlike some people.” He finished his thought by looking at Benny.
AN: Update-ed chapter! Huge thanks to lotrspnfangirl for looking this over and making this better. All mistakes are still mine.
Dean tried his best not to laugh. He really did! His best effort just wasn’t enough.
“Yes.” Dean replied with a cheeky grin, not bothering to be ashamed of his cuddly romantic side in front of his little brother.
Dean laughed and nodded his head. “Yeah, plus, you can have me and Sammy lug whatever sucker you pick over to your car, and just to sweeten the deal, we’ll even tie it all down for you. No mishaps on the highway and you only have to do half of the heavy lifting.”
When he got there he tried to find something to bring back with him so it wouldn’t be as obvious that he was hiding out in here.
“No, not embarrassed.
Whatever he’d been expecting, the words coming out of Officer Konto’s mouth had not been it. Something twisted in his stomach and he thought of the anger on Charlie and Castiel’s faces.
Bobby and Ellen had been dancing around each other for years and it was obvious to everyone around them that they liked one another. Bobby had even become labeled "the town drunk" because the spent so much time in the bar at The Roadhouse. Of course, everyone who knew them well enough, knew that he was just there for the company and that Ellen wouldn't serve him enough to get him drunk.
But, Castiel made Dean’s life better, made
movies!" answered Dean.
As soon as Cas was done coming, he fell forward against Dean, uncaring of the mess between them. He nuzzled into Dean’s neck and started leaving soft, open-mouthed kisses wherever he could reach. Dean sighed softly, reveling in the attention until he elbows and shoulders began to ache. Dean pushed Castiel off and got down from the counter.
It was the time between Christmas and New Years, when everything seemed to be standing still in anticipation of a new beginning; and while Dean could count on his fingers how long he and Cas had been together, he was sure he could get used to the feeling that being with Cas gave him.
“You’re impossible.”
“Look, maybe we shouldn’t be talking about this, according to everyone else I’m not the best at knowing what I should say and what I shouldn’t sometimes. I’m sure Sam doesn’t want me to tell you everything I know about him.”
“It’s snowing,” Dean said, looking back down to see Castiel with his head tipped back, looking up at the night sky.
The only thing that made the detention durable was that Dean had been determined to not have John ruin his good mood before his non-date with Castiel. Dean hoped he hadn’t given up on waiting for him... Straight after his detention, Dean considered calling Castiel to let him know that he would be a little bit late, but as he took his phone up from his pocket he had realized that they had never exchanged phone numbers. He, of course, checked what number the SMS was from, but it had come from a blocked number so no luck there.
” She’s tried to sit up straighter to give Dean a proper telling off and the movement jars her ankle. Her face twists in pain and Dean is at her side in a heartbeat. Behind him, Sam lingers at the curtain, looking pale-faced and stricken. Ellen’s face softens as she sees him.
Cas snorted and crossed the kitchen, backing Dean up against the counter and kissing him quiet. “It’s just Amelia and Claire, Dean. This isn’t some formal to do, it’s going to be fun! If you don’t want-”

He noticed that Doctor Winchester was close to his nurse, Jo; they laughed with each other and shared looks that only two people who knew each other could decipher. Castiel was nothing if not observant, and it looked like the two were dating. That was disappointing. But, he could have sworn that Dr. Winchester - Dean - had just tried to flirt with him.
Castiel turned it on and found a flat spot of the grass nearby to set it up on while Dean cleaned up their dinner and pulled out the pie.
power over Dean’s detentions, John decided to make them as hard as he possibly could.
“My dad was at home, but I don’t think he noticed I was there. He left in a hurry later that night.” Sam couldn’t read what Officer Kontos was thinking as he scribbled something down in his note pad.
“Really? Great! What are we watching?” Cas asked as he walked over to Dean.
. He wasn’t about to give that up just because some guys at school were mean to him.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean was there when Castiel was sick, when he felt frustrated at work or unworthy of his position. There had been a huge turn around in staff a few months back, making Castiel believe it was his fault and failings that were causing staff turmoil. Every single thing that happened, Dean was there to pick up the pieces or to cheer him on.
“I wish I had had the chance to meet him,” Dean said. “Sounds like he was a really good guy. Especially if he raised such an awesome kid.”
“Oh. They must have taken it.” When all Dean did was lift an eyebrow, Charlie explained, “Benny thought the other boys might try something from the way they were whispering and looking at your stuff, so he took it for you instead and left a note saying that he would leave it with me. Of course, he asked me to already be here when you were supposed to be done, but, uh, something came up.”
"Are we expecting someone?" asked Dean and when all of his friends looked away, he added, "What did you guys do now?"
“Dude, you shouldn't have done that,” whispered Dean while shaking his head.
“Tell that to my ex girlfriend…” Dean muttered back and found himself smiling at Cas’ eye roll.
how displeased he was with the interruption.
“Uh, yeah. Thanks, Mom, I just wasn’t that hungry, I guess.”
“Just have fun and be careful. Oh, I left you a little something in the glove compartment!” Dean heard Bobby call after him.
“Don’t worry, you’ll get a chance later. Just go to sleep, Dean.”
They bundled up, and trudged out into the snow. The sky was bright and blue with a few wintery, wispy clouds, and the snow sparkled. Their breath came out in white wisps, the air cold and crisp. Dean took a deep cleansing breath, grabbed Castiel’s hand, and pulled him out of his yard, into the neighborhood.
Sam ignored and picked out another movie to watch while he tried to ignore Dean and Cas, and Dean carded his fingers through Cas’ hair. Sitting there with his brother and boyfriend, Dean realized that this is what he had been waiting for his entire adult life, and he would fight to keep this until his last breath.
The only thing that went through Dean's mind was,
Since Dean still wasn’t feeling 100% after the beating he got the day before, he didn’t run as fast as he could. Normally, Dean was a pretty fast runner and had the stamina to run for a long time if he felt like it or needed to. Dean knew for a fact that he could outrun everyone in this class on a good day, most of them even on a bad day. But today, he mostly just stayed with Benny and Jo. Both of them were pretty good runners, especially Jo, so he knew she was slowing down a little bit for him and Benny to keep up.
For the next few hours as they continued to get everything ready, they ended up in one of their usual discussions: When are Ellen and Bobby going to get their heads out off their asses and get together?
“Come on, I learned my lesson,” Dean replied, his fingers tracing circles absentmindedly over the comforter on Castiel’s stomach. “I gave him a small slice with his scrambled eggs. It’s basically like toast and fruit, anyways.”
“The kid looks just like you,” asked Claire as she looked at a photo of a blonde women, sitting on top of the Impala, hugging a goofy little kid. “You’re not married are you?” she added with a glare at Dean.
With all signs of nervousness gone, Dean said, “Hell, yes!” a little too loudly apparently, since now everyone else in the shop was staring at him. Including his mom, who was giving him the stink eye for disturbing the quiet in the shop, even though Dean could tell she was trying to keep the smile off her face at the same time. A little quieter he said, “Yes, I would love to go out with you.”
Thank you for LOTRSPNGIRL for her amazing beta skills.
Taking a bite of his eggs, Cas smiled happily and looked towards Dean. "What did I do to deserve this wake up call?" He wondered.
Unfortunately for Charlie, the conversation was very one sided. Sam didn’t say much, he just sat there and listened to whatever it was that his mother was saying. Her mind began to wander to the differences between her and Sam. Who would’ve thought they would be sitting here having a civil conversation?
*********
He rubbed his hand across the back of his neck, a sheepish grin overcoming his face. “Sorry, I uh... shoe was untied.” Never mind the fact that his shoes didn't have laces. Dean cleared his throat twice, gesturing at the confetti of paper on the floor. “Sorry, I'll grab them, you can't get up.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That didn’t look like nothing. Wouldn’t be thinking of a particularly young, hot doctor would we, Cassie?” Balthazar asked, stepping further inside the office, sitting down in an empty chair next to Cas’ desk.
“Hello, Cas.” He said, extending his hand to Cas for a handshake.
“Why would you want my help? No, why would you
“At the risk of sounding like my niece on every single car ride we’ve been on together, I have to ask…” he side-eyed Dean with a sheepish grin, “are we there yet?”
Dean’s eyes automatically found the message that had to be from Castiel, “I’m sorry!”. What did that mean? Was Cas sorry that he showed up last night? Was Cas sorry because he brought Sam with him? Or was he sorry for what he said?
“Oh, I didn’t even consider that,” Castiel said softly, his brows furrowing for a moment. “I’m going to need to get some decorations…”
"Late? You're the
Castiel smiled back and nodded at Sam. “Take your time.”
For instance, right now he was sitting under a tree in the school ground with Benny, Charlie, Jo and Ash. The girls were gossiping about the new kids that were supposedly starting the school later this day. Apparently they were related to some popular kids in the school. Dean wasn't really paying attention.
“Cas, I.. I want you so bad, I have since I saw you in that hospital bed, grouchy and stubborn. But, but, you are off limits -”
. Dean’s brain came to a screeching halt. Sam had a new boyfriend, didn’t he? Castiel was dating Sam?
“The Impala? What do you want with baby?” asked Dean, completely lost over the strange request. Had he missed something when he was having one of his daydreams about Castiel?
Everyone is gathered around, eagerly waiting. They all have their phones out, and Cas can see various faces peering back at them via Facetime—Kali and Leigha, Michael and Lilly, Anna and Fergus with Gavin and Sasha, Lucas and Meg and Ronald, and even Ellen's daughter Jo.
Ever since their confrontation in the cafeteria earlier that day she’d been wondering what to do. She
“A big deal, when have I ever made a big deal out of anything?” asked Charlie shocked.
“What?” Dean blinks at him, stepping back again. “I don’t have a clue what you’re talking about. Castiel is my patient and I wanted to check on him. It’s my
Castiel’s mouth fell open, his eyes shining as he looked down at the white gold ring nestled in the center of the box. Dean smiled, knowing that Cas’ lack of response was the best answer he could’ve hoped for. It was rare his boyfriend was ever speechless.
Dean nodded and stepped away from the tree, giving it a once over himself. “Perfect,” he agreed, hiding a yawn with his elbow and looking sheepishly over at Cas. “Sorry,” he said quickly, “Sam has me up at the ass crack of dawn lately.”
“The fuck is that noise?”
Dean looked up at the nameless nurse, hoping she had information about Chuck’s wife. Unfortunately, the nurse grimaced at him, shaking her head. Dean knew that meant she was one of those who didn’t make it. “I’ll find out what I can,” Dean said, hoping his tone didn’t give him away. Chuck needed to be more stable before receiving the news that his wife didn’t survive the accident.
thought Dean and a smile broke out on his face.
Castiel snorted and took a deep sip of his drink, exaggerating a satisfied sigh. “I beg to differ. But who am I to judge if you like the taste of ass in a cup.”
Yay, an update!
. We spend most nights here as it is, and the nights he’s got to be home, I end up as his apartment. It seems so stupid for him to be paying for rent when I have this big house to myself…”
Honestly, who ever said Charlie wasn't scary had obviously never met her when she had her mind set on something.
“I kind of… I kind of have a date after work. But can you keep that to yourself for now? I don’t want everyone to know about it in case it doesn’t work out. Oh, and I won’t be home until late tonight.”
Dean remembered laughing so hard that tears streamed down his cheeks, as his mom called Bobby a ‘sport crazy idiot’ with a laugh.
“I think you mean the two underwear models,” said Benny joining in, since they all knew from experience that it would get a rise out of Charlie. Charlie could get quite protective over things she cared about - real or fictional.
While Dean came from under the car Bobby managed in between laughing to answer that even though Dean didn’t own it
Before Dean could answer, “Dad, the lost puppy is back!” was heard from the other side of the room. Dean couldn’t help but laugh at the nickname Castiel had earned. When he looked over, he saw a young girl standing behind a counter. “Just sit down, I will be right with you!”
What happens next? Stay tuned for tfw_cas' chapter on November 23rd!! (Eat pie and read good fiction, Dean Winchester approves).
Castiel huffed what sounded like a small laugh and Dean felt himself blush again. “I wasn’t resting to begin with, Dean.”
As it turned out, lunch was easier said than done. No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't work out their schedules—meetings and emergencies kept cropping up out of nowhere. After four days of trying, Cas accosted him in the cafeteria, weekly planner in hand, and they settled on dinner.
As he looked under the bed for one of his socks, Castiel walked into the room. “Don’t get up on my account.” Turning around, Dean raised one eyebrow at Cas as he put his socks on. “Claire was wondering if you needed any help and if she could go with you to pick which ones to bring over. I’ve already promised Amelia I would help her in the kitchen but I can-- ”
Castiel took his eyes off the road as he looked over to Dean. “Yes, Dean, it’s just a little bit further.”
Hey Benny! I know you’re dead and all that but lets say I wanted to revenge your tragic death, do you know any good ways to kill someone?
Castiel looked dubious. Dean nodded firmly. “Yep. Get your shovel. I’ll be right back.”
“He’s going to have no teeth by the time he’s four,” Castiel grumbled in agreement, smiling as he felt Dean laughing against him. “Speaking of, please tell me you didn’t feed him leftover pie for breakfast.”
“A date? Where? And please tell me it’s with Castiel.”
over at Tumblr) it would never by as good without them. I’m pretty sure I’m going to end up naming all my future babies after them, at this point.
Dean tried to remember if he had promised Bobby to work longer that day. He was fairly certain that he had not and if he had, Bobby was sure to understand and let Dean off the hook this once. “Yeah, that works for me, I have work until six so that gives me time to get home and change.”
Charlie laughed. “Oh, he’s not. But I have eyes, and I know attractive when I see it.”
The worst thing John did was come back. Dean would’ve been perfectly happy growing up and resenting an absent father, angry at a stranger for leaving his mom and him. But, instead of resenting him, Dean hated him with every fiber of his body. In returning, Dean was forced to watch him and Sam live the perfect life right in front of him while he and his mom were struggling.
- Supernatural -
Jo nodded again and disappeared to make the call.
At the same time Dean’s detention had started, Charlie was sitting by herself in her favorite place in the school's library reading ‘The Hobbit’ for the thousandth time. She was just getting started on chapter two when Benny walked in with an armful of stuff Charlie was pretty sure all belonged to Dean.
“Right, so I suppose it was just my bad eyesight that saw… what was his name? Castiel? Leaning towards you every time you stopped moving, watching you as you spoke, looking extremely interested…”
“Hey, I said I was sorry! You just ‘came out’ out of the blue! How was I supposed to react?” asked Benny turning around to look at Dean before quickly turning his attention back to the game when he realized Charlie had pulled ahead.
better. He pushed Dean in ways that he never would’ve done on his own, and Dean found every aspect of his life was better because of it. He’d never been happier.
Once Balthazar actually left, Cas once again tried straightening out his desk but was unable to concentrate for very long before he began thinking about Dean again. After his fourth failed attempt, he simply gave up straightening the desk, deciding to go looking for man in question. He felt almost self-conscious riding the elevator back down to the first floor, despite being known to splitting his time between his office and the Emergency Department. Barely anyone paid him much mind as he slowly wandered through the maze of the hallways. For a moment, he believed Dean might have already left. His heart leapt into his throat when he saw him talking to several nurses, obviously giving them direction about their patients.
“Dean…” started Castiel who had been right behind him out of the kitchen.
“You’re impossible,” Sam quipped back, smiling. “I don’t think Luc has anything going on this week in the evenings, so why don’t you two get back to us on what day works best for you? I don’t have any cases this week, so I’ll be home at a reasonable hour.”
With a quick look at his mom, Dean saw how she went from being confused to compassionate. As he looked back down, his mom reached under his cheek and lifted his head so he would look at her. “Dean, I’m sure if he gets to know you, he’ll like you back. And if he’s not gay, you can still be friends. I mean you still talk to Benny even though you had a crush on him when you first met him.”
Either way, Castiel tried  to get to know the new staff at least a little bit. He was usually a good judge of character, but he was also a damn good doctor and he should at least try to make sure that Dr. Winchester was up to snuff, right? He reached for his bag, pulling out a second red pen since the first was lost, and clicked it open.
things and could see right through him, every damn time. So he did what any sane man would do and turned right around, walking back the way he came.
Charlie got so carried away in their conversation that she completely forgot that she was supposed to met Dean in the locker room.
stalling. Finally, having procrastinated long enough, he entered room two-oh-five, his eyes burning holes in the chart he’s carrying. He realized four steps away from the room that as a medical director, his current patient probably knew he didn’t need to carry the paper chart since the hospital did everything digitally, but it was a habit he picked up on while still in med school. God damn it, he was going to take the security blanket while he could.
"You know you can't avoid her forever right?" Jo sighed but Dean never got the time to answer because Ellen walked in from the back. Ellen Harvelle was Jo's mom and the owner of Harvelle's Roadhouse. She was also a good friend of Dean's mom. Best friend, even.  "Hey, mom is it alright if we move movie night into the back room tonight? That way there's enough room for everyone."
Dean pressed up against his back, looking over his shoulder at the pie. He shrugged, cocking his head to the side. “It’s a little darker than I wanted it to be… and see here, the crust is kind of crumbling a bit…”
bad that we have to leave the country. They mean well, at least.”
“I don’t know what happened, I’m sorry,” Castiel cut her off quickly, hating that he didn’t have anything to say that could make her feel better. “We just found him in the woods outside of town.” And thank God that they did. Castiel would never refuse his brother anything ever again.
They were three songs in when Castiel reached forward to turn the sound down a few clicks, shifting his weight in the seat to angle his body towards Dean.
?” he added, looking Castiel right in the eyes.
For the next half an hour, Dean could feel Sam staring at him every time Castiel wasn’t looking.
“I feel as if I should apologize,” Cas told him.
The rest of the night went by in a comfortable blur, over the remaining crumbs of pie and coffee until all four of them decided it was best to turn in for the night. Castiel and Dean bid their goodbyes, and the last thing they heard as they left Sam and Luc’s house was Lucifer’s reassuring, “I told you you were worrying over nothing.”
“I was, then I changed my mind,” the happier voice quipped back -- Mr. Happy.
I'm just here to check up on you, so as long as you're feeling okay now, we'll wait for another dose of codeine and give it to you with your antibiotic later this evening.”
Dean looked up from his phone when he could feel Charlie staring at him. If looks could kill, then Dean was sure he would be on his way to the great beyond right about now.
Dean let his head back to let it hang in mid-air. Cas took the opportunity to be what it was and leaned ahead, which unfortunately slowed down his pace, to suck a bruise onto Dean’s neck. He bit and nibbled at the skin before licking the abused spot and dropping a soft kiss there. The action was so tender, it made Dean’s heart ache for a relationship with this sex god of a man. Dean didn’t have any more time to think about that because Cas immediately leaned back and resumed his earlier speed, fucking Dean hard and fast.
“Sammy, I swear to God, when I end up with a massive bonfire from all of these trees? I’m putting you in the center of it.”
“Why are you still standing there? This bed is big enough for two and it’s cold without you,” said Dean, closing his eyes again and pressing himself deeper into the comforter.
Sam’s mind continued to go at warp speed. There was no doubt in his mind that his 'friends’ were behind this. What the fuck had those assholes been thinking? Sure, he and Dean had pushed each other around a few times, but never so bad that they had to go to the hospital because of it.
Dean was just rounding the last corner on his way home later that day, when he felt hands grab his arms and pull him back. Before he could turn his head to see who it was, something was put over his head and everything went dark. Ignoring the spike of nerves, he gave a small chuckle and was just about to ask his friends what they thought they were trying to do, when he got punched in the stomach.
Reluctantly, Castiel reached for his phone on the nightstand and pushed the button, the LED screen lighting up and showing it was only a little after 11 am. So, almost three hours of sleep, then.
“With you? I think that can be arranged. I just have to buy her first. So, where to Cas?”
tell me you have at least seen Star Wars, Harry Potter, and Indiana Jones!” Charlie burst out, like it would actually hurt her if Castiel hadn’t seen them, too.
"But what about your dinner?"
They seemed to be coming closer to where Dean was propped against the tree. If Dean wanted any chance of getting help, he needed them to find him. Soon, before he passed out again.
“Bring it over here and I’ll put it together while you help us pick a board game,” said Lucas. As Ronald gathered everything to bring to his dad, Clarie excused herself to the bathroom. Lucas, with Michael’s help, ended up having to take the whole set apart to reassemble it correctly. It took a few tries, mostly because Gabriel had stolen the instructions and refused to give them back, but he managed to do it before a decision was made about what to play. Mostly because people kept suggesting games Castiel had gotten rid of when he moved.
Of course, there was also the part where he didn’t want Sam to find out about it. Not that his friends would ever tell! Things like this just tended to leak out when too many knew about it. And since Sam hadn’t punched him yet for even
Huffing, Charlie turned back towards her book. “I thought you didn’t want anything to do with me.”
“No, I don’t like pie!” The silence that followed was deafening as everybody at the table looked at Castiel, some with forks mid-way to their mouths, like he was from another planet.
“No... he locked himself in his office when he got home, so I didn’t exactly get a chance to ask,” said Sam. He wasn’t about to tell them his dad had been in a terrible, terrible mood when he got home so he stuck to his room the rest of the evening. Or about the fight that had woken him up this morning and had still been going on when he snuck out right before lunch.
Before anyone could say anything, Dean snapped “Don’t!” Feeling Castiel squeeze his hand under the table, Dean sent him a small smile and squeezed back before standing up. “See you guys later.”
“Was. She was discharged earlier on.”
“Yeah, Dad. I will. Bye."
He laid his hands flat on the top of the blanket, thinking back to the kind, attractive man he had gotten to see over the last two days. Holding a grudge didn’t seem like something he would do…
Cas nods and takes the tulips. He clutches them tight as he rounds the corner of tree stands. Bright white lights adorn a row of trees, spelling out the word
“Why don’t I make us a cup of coffee, okay?”
messing up my school's reputation and that needs to stop right now.”
“Look Cas, I know it might be difficult for you to understand... Sam is your best friend, but we’ve hated each other for years. He and his friends used to torment me growing up and because the gang were my friends, Sam would pick on them too. The fact that Charlie seems to have forgiven him for all of that is just…” Dean really didn’t know how to finish that sentence, all he knew was that he felt betrayed by Charlie right now. “She’s one of my best friends and he is like my arch enemy. He’s like Magneto to my Professor X.” Noticing the confused look on Castiel face, Dean decided to find another comparison that his boyfriend might recognize. “He is the Lex Luthor to my Clark?” If anything, Castiel just looked more confused. “The Joker to my Batman?”
Not that he couldn’t use the extra hour, but he still felt bad about breaking his promise about working over time. Bobby had always been good to him the last thing he wanted was to let him down. Somehow, Dean got the feeling Bobby knew something that he didn’t. It only added to his suspicions when Bobby said, “That’s okay, you can go early. Just make sure t’ grab the keys to the Impala before you go.”
“If we get murdered, I’m never talking to you again!” hissed Mr. Grumpy.
Snagging the satchel from the passenger seat and shutting off the engine, he steels his nerves and walks up the steps to the front door, trying desperately hard not to do anything rude like peek in the windows just in case Cas is in there lounging about. Half naked. Oh God. He draws in a deep breath until his lungs burn, lets it out - then knocks.
“I beg your pardon?” Castiel really hoped he didn't look as flustered as he felt from Dean’s words.
And yet, Dean couldn’t help but notice that there was nothing that showed there was a sixteen year old boy living there. There were certifications on the walls with ‘John Winchester’ or ‘Katie Winchester’ on them, along with magazine covers featuring them separately and even together, but there wasn’t a single photo of or drawing done by Sam.
As Dean crossed over the room towards Benny, Castiel must have realized Dean wasn’t going to sit beside him because a sad look, one that Dean hoped to never see again, came over his face. Before Dean could change his mind, Charlie plopped down in the seat beside Cas and Jo plopped down in the seat on the free couch. Dean sighed and sat next to her.
Eyes never leaving Cas’, Dean reached above them to where the picnic basket lay on its side and fumbled around inside through the empty dishes and Tupperware. When he pulled his arm back, he had a dark black box in his hand.
His mom was quiet for a while, looking at the cast on his arm. “Want to talk about what happened?” she asked eventually.
“Nothing. Just let it go,” said Dean in a singsong voice with a small smile on his face before picking up the speed so he was in front of them for the first time.
"Keep walking, Uncle Cassie!" Claire giggles and hides her face in her hands. Gabe and Amelia are both pink-cheeked and grinning like idiots. They both nod toward the rest of the line.
“You haven’t seen Lord of the Rings? That’s just wrong!
“It’s alright, I like it!” When Cas had pulled to a stop in front of the house, Dean got his stuff and got out, but before he closed the door, he turned back to Castiel. “Thanks for the ride and for trying to show interested.”
Sam interrupts him with a hiss, “But I am! You being around, that’s what I need. Do it for me, Dean, so I can move on.”
“Can you take this to the booth all the way in the back for me? I need to go check on the oven. Thanks, sweety!” And with that, she was gone.
“Oh fuck,” Dean groaned as Castiel ground down. He thrust up a few more times, hips stuttering and cock throbbing as he spilled his hot load inside of Castiel.
“What? Dean, are you feeling alright? Because I don’t think I have ever seen you turn down my food other than the time I found you passed out with a fever of 102!” said Mary as she put the book she had been reading down and came over to check his forehead.
"No! It's rude to invite someone and then not let them in. Especially when we have already cancelled our plan to be here," Sam said before pushing Castiel ahead of him inside.
“Yeah, that.” That didn’t really answer Castiel’s question, but Dean figured they were kind of the same thing, so it didn’t really matter.
“And you,” replied Castiel before Mary made her way back to the kitchen. Castiel reached for the door before turning back to Dean. “I must get going. Thank you, Dean, I had fun tonight and I’m really looking forward to Saturday.”
Dean made his way back into the kitchen, quickly cleaning up the spilled coffee and dropping the soaked hand towel into the sink. It took a bit to find what he needed, opening up more wrong cabinets than right ones, but he managed without having to ask Castiel were things were. As he was heating the soup up on the stove he hummed to himself. It had been a long time since he took care of someone outside of work and he found himself wandering back to the earlier day dream. Dean actually missed having the opportunity to do it, the ‘domestic crap’ he always used to give Sam shit for.
“Hey Winchester, it looks like your girlfriend got her painties in a twist! Maybe you should go help her unwind,” one of the jocks at the table called, much to the amusement of the rest of the table.
over him. Even though Castiel had a slightly annoyed look pointed at the camera, you could see he was having fun and did not mind having the girl so close. Dean couldn’t help but get insanely jealous of that girl, even if Castiel was dressed in the most dorkiest clothes ever.
But… why was that photo in some guy's journal? To say that Dean was curious would be an understatement.
“Not that you’re not welcome here, but is there a reason why you didn’t go home first like you usually do?” Jo asked Dean as they walked into the Roadhouse.
Dean saw Castiel smile at that and he found himself smiling back. He watched as Cas quickly moved around the room, gathering up some clothes and nodding at Dean as he slipped back out of the room to give him privacy.
And just like that, everything was back to normal.
“I’m glad he did, so don’t be too mad at them, they were only trying to be friendly,” said Castiel as he looked at his watch before slowly starting to walk backwards towards the door. “I’m sorry, I really need to go if I want to catch the bus.”
“Jesus, Bradbury,” Dean rolled his eyes, trying to shove her off, “you sound like freaking Gollum right now.”
“What? Why not?” asked Sam as he looked up from his phone so he could look Charlie in the face. He knew why and both of them knew it. He’d been blowing up her phone ever since he got out of the principal’s office, trying to convince her that he had nothing to do with what happened to Dean. He all but begged her to still come over like they’d planned, letting him explain to her in person. She hadn’t answered any of his messages, leaving him on read.
“I slept fine. Thanks, mom.” said Dean as he sat down and began eating his breakfast.
Sam chuckled, exchanging a look that Dean did
“--Jo Harvelle--” The name broke through Dean’s subconscious and he looked over, sharing a smile with Benny. They both knew Jo was better than most of the boys in their class and were looking forward to playing with her in the extra class since she was in a different gym class than they were. Dean, unfortunately caught the next name, too. Alastair Heyerdahl. Jo was going to
Cas smiles and nods, unable to keep his own tears from slipping. This time last year, obligation to Jimmy's memory and his niece pushed him to come here, to do something he'd never have done on his own, and he ended up with more than he ever could’ve imagined. He's not a religious man, but he likes to think his twin had a hand in this, wherever he is. He tips his head back, licks his lips as the first few flakes shimmer in the air. "Thank you, Jimmy," he whispers.
Dean glared at Sam for a moment, then shook his head. “You need your eyes checked.”
Dean responded by hooking his fingers through the belt loops on Cas’ pants and pulling him closer. He leaned in and pressed a small, tentative kiss on Cas’ lips. He pulled back and looked at Cas, who nodded, so Dean surged forward and kissed him again, his tongue darting out to taste.
Looking him once while the two brothers exchanges pleasantries, Dean couldn’t help but think he snagged the hotter Novak. Not that Lucifer wasn’t attractive, but Castiel with his big muscly arms, his bluer than blue eyes, and the things he could do with his...
It was quickly established that the brothers didn't get along. Sam seemed to hate that he wasn't John’s only son. Therefore, he hated Dean, and he did everything in his power to make Dean’s life difficult. Since Sam was one of the popular kids, it wasn't all that hard.
“You know, its very sexy when you blush.” Castiel hummed as his hand slid to Dean’s inner thigh. “Makes your freckles stand out.”
Throwing the covers away to get up, stopping long enough to pull Cas in for a kiss, Dean made his way to the bathroom. “Just make sure there’s coffee,” he answered. As he crossed the threshold he added, “A lot of it.”
After sending Benny a ‘I told you so’ look, Jo and Dean made their way over to their team and Benny did the same. Jo and Dean were in no hurry when they made their way over. Dean’s other teammates were all huddled together and when Dean came closer he heard Lucifer say “...just follow the plan and do as Sam said,” before the group broke up. All Lucifer said to Dean and Jo before the game started was to ‘stay out of their way’ and ‘don’t fuck up’.
“Panicked and started imagining the worst, no matter how crazy it was?” asked Charlie, with a knowing look on her face. “Relax, I
Dean smiled wide, taking a large forkful from the very center.
“I know you just wanted to help, but Dean, you don’t owe those people anything. It should have been Sam’s decision if he wanted to stand up to John or not, not yours,” Mary chided.
"Dean!"
"You okay?" Dean nudges him.
“No, I mean it. It’s not even seven and you’re up. I don’t think that’s ever happened. Is the world ending or something that I don’t know about?” Mary asked seconds before she noticed the state of his room. “What the heck happened in here? Do we have a poltergeist in the house?”
As Dean walked up to the door to their apartment he couldn’t help wondering what was waiting for him behind it. If he was lucky, he would find a note on the table next to the door that would say, “Left a plate for you in the fridge. Good night, honey!” It would mean that his mom would already be in bed and he could put off talking to her for few more hours. But, as Dean’s luck would have it, he had just opened the door when he heard his mom’s cheerful voice, “Hey, honey! I left some lasagna in the fridge for you!”
“Yes, I would guess so too,” Dean responded, before clueing in to what his patient had just said. “Ohhhh, you mean… you thought…” he laughed heartily, “Ewww, no. Jo is not my wife or girlfriend, she’s my always annoying, pain in the ass, little sister. Or, to be exact, step-sister.”
“If he wants to,” Dean mumbled and he could feel his face get redder and redder. What was even worse, he saw the moment Sam noticed it too.
“I got lost on my way to town.”
“Bye Dean,” and with that Castiel was gone. Since Dean was now all alone and he knew Bobby would keep an eye on the reception, he put an AC/DC cassette on in the Impala, cracked up the volume and went to work on Cas’s car.
Dean shrugged, but found himself hard pressed to argue. He only really remembered half of the adults names, and the only child he could remember, other than Claire, was Anna's daughter Sasha, simply because the infant had refused to be put down after she was put in Dean's arms.
"Should I be worried that this is exactly the sound you make with your cock in my mouth?" Dean asked.
Sam took the same seat he'd sat in the night before while Dean carried the dishes over to the sink. "Need me to do anything?' he asked as Castiel came up behind him.
The fight ranged all over his front yard, the two of them surging through the deep snow, laughing and shouting. Dean was pleasantly surprised as Castiel made him work for it, putting up a good defense, finally resorting to tackling Dean into the snow.
Hope you enjoy!
“Go ‘way, S’mmy.” He slurred.
“Is it bad that I want to take that title away from you?” asked Castiel with a sad smile.
Cas sighed, squatting down beside Dean. “Of course not. Compassion and empathy are two traits that are honorable. But I’ve seen too many good doctors burn themselves out from getting attached.”
he thought to himself,
Standing in front of his locker, Dean was busy emptying his bag from the books he was done with, and replacing the new ones he’d need for the next few classes. His school bag was really a mess right now and Dean wondered what he would have to do to get Charlie to organize it for him again. The last time she did it for him, Dean had fucked it up again in record time, and needless to say, Charlie had not been happy. In fact, she said she would

The nurse with him let out a loud huff before saying, “Yes, he’s gonna make a full recovery from his injuries.”
