“Sister,” he replied, smiling fondly. “She’s Ellen’s daughter, a few months younger than me, but the smartest out of all of us.”
I hoped that the smile I gave him wasn’t creepy. I was never quite sure what the line was, but he smiled back and raised the phone back to his ear.
I nodded.
Sam didn’t look anything like a “Sammy” to me, but I did think it was sweet, if uncharacteristically sentimental, of Dean to call him that.
Maybe I did see what Sam was saying about me getting used to him. He grinned at my response and I noticed his dimples and rethought that as my nerves jumped back into my stomach. What was it about this guy that was so anxiety-inducing, I wondered.
“Uh, yes? Or, I mean, no, I haven’t seen it.”
“Um, truthfully,” I replied, dead serious. “Probably not.”
Dean, mercifully, let his hand slide from my shoulder, and half-jogged to catch up with Sam. I followed suit, careful not to shift the pizzas too much, no doubt looking much more awkward than he had. We took the elevator up to our floor and soon we were all piling into our dorm room, which was feeling much smaller than it had earlier, with three boys and one television set.
He headed into the room and I, stiffly, followed him. It looked exactly like it had on the website: two beds with about three feet of space between them, two desks, two dressers, and two closets. It looked like you’d taken one side and photocopied it to make the other, simply reversing the image. Sam had already started to unpack some of his belongings, but there were still a couple small boxes stacked by the foot of the bed.
making him laugh. It made him seem like a little kid somehow.
I pulled the crumpled campus map out of the pocket of my coat and looked for my dorm again, as if I hadn’t already memorized its exact location, as well as the location of all of my classrooms. As I set off across campus I tried, and failed, to not wish too hard that Anna was here. She’d always been, well, nicer to me than Gabe and all this summer, as I thought about what it was going to be like to move away from the ranch and live on my own, knowing that she would be on campus, too, just a couple buildings over, had been incredibly reassuring. She’d planned this whole welcome week schedule for us where she’d show me all the cool, secret things around campus and introduce me to her friends and I had, of course, acted like that was so embarrassing. Then her acceptance letter had come, from the journalism program in Ohio, and there had never been any question about whether or not she was going to go.
to a party in the first place.
I nodded at Sam, feeling a small smile on my face at how quickly I had been renamed.
Sam nodded, giving me a smile as I ducked out of the room. I said a silent prayer of thanks for bathrooms being universally available for hiding out in. Not that I needed to hide, but I did need a moment to breathe. I was having to experience too many new things at once and I could tell that my “normal person” facade was starting to slip.
“Don’t be,” he responded. “Dean and I are better off without him.”
“It’s the most important one,” Dean replied, smiling at me. “The other rule is that if anybody falls asleep, we get to draw whatever we want on their face with sharpies.”
Somehow, I found myself looking down at Sam. We smiled at each other, his eyes clearing saying “can you believe this dork?” I shook my head at him, then looked back over at Dean, still narrating.
I gave him a small smile at that.
Unless, I thought, I reached a point where I wasn’t pretending. College is all about reinvention, I reminded myself, hearing Gabe’s voice in my head. Even Anna had said it, in her own way, that college was going to “bring me out of my shell.” What if I liked it in my shell? What if I liked being wrapped up in my own world, away from other people’s opinions and judgements? What if I liked being weird? What then?
“Yeah, I’m the one with the car. Keep talking dirty to me and we’ll be friends, for sure.”
“Yes,” I replied, as I finished arranging the last of my clothes in my dresser. “I was mainly in charge of our garden. It was very large, as we grew, well, still grow, as much of our food as the climate here allows. We have a couple fields for large crops, typically corn or wheat. We also keep chickens and some livestock, but my younger siblings looked after them.”
“I’m so glad you asked, Cas. Baby is a 1967 Chevy Impala, the best year of the best car. She was our dad’s first, but he left her sitting out back in a field for a few years. I had to track down a bunch of parts that aren’t in production anymore to rebuild her, which is why it took me so long. Good thing, I work at a mechanic, so I had access to all the tools and ordering systems.”
going to have to hold that “shit” in.
that one time. I liked
“Yeah, uh, I think it was some sort of math? Dean could never be bothered to pay attention to that in school. Honestly, I think that class was what drove him to finally drop out. He never really wanted to be here anyway.”
“I’m sorry for your loss, Sam.”
“Well, to each their own, I guess.” Dean said, looking at me appraisingly. “You’re in charge of carrying the pizza, Cas. Sammy and I will get the TV stuff.”
Sam smiled at that.
That perked him up.
“Cas, this is Baby,” he said, nudging me closer to the car. “Baby, this is Cas.”
“Oh, I’ll be okay,” I said, looking at my singular backpack and duffel bag. “I didn’t bring very much.”
“She, uh,” I started, trying to fill the silence. “She sounds like a good parent.”
He chuckled.
“Hi!” he said, smiling and with none of the closed off demeanor of the other one. “I’m Sam.”
I looked at him, head tilted, obviously a little confused by the end of their conversation.
I smiled. How Sam talked about Dean reminded me of how I talked about Gabe.
“That’s what I thought,” he grinned. “I’m hoping to take classes in all of them this year, so I can decide. I’m taking an Anthropology course focusing on the cave dwellers of early Europe this semester and an Intro to Christian Theology, so I just need to find a History course for next semester.”
“It has a bunch of toppings, peppers and mushrooms and olives.”
“So, Anna met your brother in a ‘remedial’ class?” I asked, clarifying.
The brother’s eyebrows shot up.
“Ellen runs Harvelle’s, it’s the roadhouse on the outskirts of town, and Dean has always loved that place.”
“How do you feel about sausage?”
“It sounds like he would get along with my brother,” I said.
I tried not to indulge my overdramatic tendencies, reminding myself to not get too into my head; there was a person here and we were in the middle of a conversation, but it felt like my perception of the world had been tilted on its axis. Why didn’t Anna tell me about that? When I thought back to her first semester, I do remember her always seeming stressed and rushed, like she was constantly on her way to somewhere else. I remembered the bags under her eyes when she’d come home for Christmas, then left the morning after. Honestly, I’d just thought that was what college was like. Sure, Gabe and Michael hadn’t been like that, but, well, they were Gabe and Michael.
“It’s nice to meet you, Sam. I’m Castiel.”
I let the silence hang for just a moment, before going back to the list that I’d made earlier.
I heard some shuffling in the room before the door was yanked open and I was standing face to face with a stranger. He’d stepped into the doorway as he pulled the door open, which meant he was invading my personal space. It also meant that I could see every one of the freckles across his cheeks and nose and the places around the collar of his army jacket that had gone threadbare from age and use. I shifted back on my heels, feeling my ears get a little red.
“Oh, cool,” I replied, because that’s what you say when someone is excited about something that you know nothing at all about.
I guess I must have been staring at Dean as I thought about all of this, because he nudged me with his knee.
“How long have she and your father been married?” I asked, immediately unsure if this was an appropriate question as soon as it had left my mouth.
“Don’t get him started on his car,” Sam said as he came back out of the closet where he’d disappeared to. He slapped his brother’s feet off the end of the bed, then sat down.
Dean flipped him off, causing Sam to smile again as he lay my bag down on top of my bed. I followed suit, putting my duffel on top of the empty mattress and sitting down, a bit unsure of what to do now. I looked across at Dean.
I know my ears must have turned bright red and I probably looked like a deer in the headlights. Sam cleared his throat at us.
a dive on the outskirts of town.”
Sam surprised me by snorting at that, his half-laugh I was realizing.
end up having lots of questions. The brothers had an answer for all of them.
We caught eyes for just a second after he closed the Impala’s door, VCR tapes in his hands. I quickly broke the eye contact and looked down at the ground.
I liked how easy they were with each other. It made me feel slightly more at ease with myself. Dean assembled a small pile of pieces on his plate before clambering onto my bed. He made himself comfortable in one of the corners. I grabbed two slices, then looked around, unsure of what the seating protocol was in this situation. It seemed like one of those things that they obviously already knew. Dean saw the hesitation on my face and patted the mattress beside him.
I tried not to let the irritation from that thought process linger. I washed my hands and splashed a little water on my face for good measure. I grabbed a paper towel meant for my hands and rubbed it all over my face to dry it, leaving my glasses resting precariously on top of the sink. It’s not even been a full day yet, I reminded myself. You don’t need to figure all of this out yet. Tonight, you can be “Cas” and watch some sci-fi with your new roommate who you think might turn into a friend and his brother who, well, intimidates you quite a bit.
“Okay, okay,” Dean said, smiling and mock-defeated. “There’s only one rule, Cas. Also Luke Skywalker is the main character, you’ll see.”
Sam got a text from Dean about twenty minutes later saying to come downstairs to help him carry things. Sam practically took the stairs three at a time on the way down and I was, once again, astounded by his height. I certainly wasn’t short, but he was something else. He held the door open for me with a flourish once we reached the bottom floor and I found myself laughing and relaxing a little bit more.
“Wait, real rule number two,” Dean said. “Somebody
“That must be nice for him, to have a legacy,” I continued, trying hard not to think of mine, about how my father honestly didn’t care if I did get a degree in something “impractical” like European Literature, because the plan was always for me to go to seminary after this anyway.
My thoughts were mercifully occupied by the difficulty of hauling a duffel bag with a nearly broken strap full of all your worldly possessions up five flights of stairs for the rest of my walk. It was already late afternoon once I reached my hall and I knew that my new roommate, Sam, who I had never met before and would be sharing a 500 square foot space with for the next four months, would definitely already be there.
He caught my eyes and rolled his eyes. It caught me off guard and made me laugh, just a small laugh, but it was the first time I’d laughed all day. I felt just a bit of the tension leave my shoulders.
I smiled at the way it sounded in his low voice.
I almost chuckled at that; that did sound like Anna. She never directly lied, but she was a big fan of omission and an expert at steering conversations when she wanted to be. I didn’t say any of that, though. It felt too revealing of her.
Sam hesitated, just enough that I knew he was deciding what to tell me.
“Cool. Usually when we order pizza, Dean gets a meat lovers and I order a supreme.”
Sam merely looked on, half fond-half exasperated.
He looked a little bashful about the last one and, at first, it made me think he’d heard of my father’s reputation, but, no, he’d said that Anna never talked about our family and, really, no one heard about Chuck Shurley outside of, well, rather small, rather fringe, Christian circles.
grew up on a farm?”
I let myself feel the warmth of that thought for a second more, then sighed, and forced myself to look at the buildings passing by outside the large windows as we got closer and closer to campus. It isn’t polite to stare, I reminded myself, and I know that thinking about the bus as a community has to be exactly what Gabe was referring to when he told me to “lay off that overly earnest shit.” I didn’t approve of Gabe’s word choice (to be fair, none of Gabe’s choices since moving out made any sense to me), but I knew that he was right. If I didn’t want to be labelled the weird kid immediately, I
“I can major in anything for that, so I haven’t decided either. I’m thinking History, maybe Anthropology, or even, uh, Religious Studies.”
Sam snorted.
“Dean,” Sam replied, sternly. “We are not doing that.”
“Good question, Cas,” Dean replied, in a voice that I can only imagine is what a kindergarten teacher sounds like. “And an excellent example of our first rule: no talking, unless Cas has a question. If he does, I will be the one to answer it, not Sam.”
“Okay-” Sam said, then, “Ha. Ha. Yes, we reached a decision. Just the usual two. No, I did not pressure him, Dean. Normal people like vegetables.”
I didn’t know what to make of that.
“I don’t make the rules,” Dean replied, holding his hands up in fake surrender.
“Kind of a weird name, kid,” Dean said. Sam glared at him.
I tilted my head at him, confused, but he waved me off.
My face flushed and I immediately found the wall quite interesting to look at.
a child, not anymore. One of her friends, some guy named Dean that she refused to say where she met, had a younger brother who was my age who was living in the freshman dorms, too. His name was Sam and they had both decided that we should be roommates. It was better than rooming with a complete stranger, but, well, I’ve been told my “people skills” are rusty at best and I know that this was also Anna’s way of ensuring that I make at least one friend while I’m here. I only hoped that she turned out to be a good judge of character. I was fully prepared to be the one to fill the role of “the weird roommate.”
“Supreme?”
I was surprised to see that Sam was on the phone when I entered the room.
Sam turned and smacked Dean’s leg, but I knew there was no real anger in him. I may not know much about people, but I know more than my fairshare about siblings. I did grow up the middle child of seven.
“Oh, no, I would never presume-” I stammered, before finishing awkwardly: “I’ve never had alcohol.”
“This TV isn’t the lightest thing in the world, guys.”
I didn’t need to see Sam’s face to know that he had rolled his eyes at him, but he grabbed the remote and the TV screen lit up. It was all black, but soon yellow letters started to scroll up from the bottom of the scene.
“So, Cas-” I heard Sam’s voice from behind the closet door, mercifully breaking the silence. “Do you know what you plan on majoring in?”
“Carrie Fisher has talked about the working conditions on set and-”
“Is Joe your brother?” I asked, instead of what I wanted to.
“Is that the only rule?” I asked, probably too earnestly. Part of my brain recognized that Dean was joking, but there was another part that was saying that maybe he wasn’t and maybe this was just another thing that I had never learned.
“Oh? Mad because somebody fell asleep the last time we were having a western marathon.”
these people. Why hadn’t she told me that?
“Those all sound like interesting choices,” I replied, instead of poking further.
He made a big show of clearing his throat, before continuing in a deeper, dramatic voice: “A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away-”
“If you want to do that, of course. No pressure, if you already have plans or anything.”
“What’s a Skywalker?” I asked, not noticing until after that I’d tilted my head. Anna and Gabe always teased me about that.
“Uh, yeah.” Dean said it like it was obvious. “It’s because I built her from the ground up. She’s basically my Baby.”
“Just don’t get too gay with out me, okay?”
It crossed my mind that maybe Anna and Dean had dated. Maybe that’s why she didn’t want to tell me about how they met. I was surprised to find I hoped that wasn’t true.
We all knew that Gabe was going to rebel when he moved out, except maybe Michael based on his explosive reaction, but Anna had been a surprise. I didn’t even know she was wanted to; I’m not sure she did either. It’s not like there’s a lot of opportunity to do anything drastic when you’re only ever at home, an hour away from other people, or at church with your cousins.
“Oh, I’m sorry I presumed-”
I nodded solemnly, because I didn’t know what else to do. I thought about my tomato plants that I’d nursed from seedlings, through aphid attacks and the hot, dry summers; It wasn’t a perfect analogy, but I guess I could understand.
“My father said it was a distraction that affected the developing brain’s mental capability,” I said, feeling myself start to ramble.
“Hey!” Dean exclaimed, trying to keep it away from his much taller brother, with no success.
“Okay, Cas,” he said. “We’re going to set up some ground rules here, so that you can have an optimum Skywalker experience.”
I was rewarded with a laugh.
“So, you’re the one with the car?” Anna had mentioned this to me, saying that if I ever had an emergency, to ask Dean for a ride. Looking across at him now, I couldn’t picture him being someone I’d want to go to for help or someone my sister would be friends with for that matter. He looked, well, he looked like a delinquent, the poster version of one with his big boots, popped collar, and permanent smirk.
“Oh? And why not?”
Dean rolled his eyes, finally breaking.
I took a deep breath, then some more, trying not to get into my head too much as I searched the doors for my number. This was impossible, of course, because I was always in my head too much. I proved this by standing in front of room 401 for a few minutes trying to figure out whether it was weirder to knock on the door of my own room or to walk in unannounced. I opted for knocking, Michael had always told us to air on the side of politeness.
“I’m not sure that counts.”
“Fuck, Cas, you’re so fucking hot,” Dean said as he was gently dropped onto the king-sized bed.
"Cas-" Dean gasped, panting. "Come--come with me, angel." Just seconds after he finished speaking, his orgasm tore through him, definitely one of the most intense ones he'd had, white covering his stomach in long streaks. He could feel his hole clenching and pulsing rhythmically around Cas, as the angel filled him up with hot cum, writhing and arching his back beneath Dean. The feeling wasn't as weird as Dean had anticipated, instead it was kinda satisfying to be marked by his angel like this.
"So, now what is that important that it couldn't wait until you joined us up here for good, Dean?" Bobby asked sarcastically. The others stopped talking and turned to Dean, staring at him expectantly.
"I have a husband", was what he settled to answer with.
"I would appreciate it if you'd let me finish before you jump to conclusions, Mrs Harvelle", Dr. Novak chastised softly. "What I was going to say is that I've been feeling a little off because of the morning sickness. I'm pregnant."
Dean placed his hands onto his lover’s hips and slowly licked a stripe up the underside of his leaking member. Cas back arched off the mattress at the unfamiliar, but immensely pleasurable sensation. Dean then took the head of his cock between his lips carefully and suckled lightly. He hadn’t done this before, of course, but he tried to do what he himself enjoyed most. Cas seemed to like it very much, given the breathy gasps and moans coming from him. Dean managed to lube up three fingers of his right hand without taking Cas out of his mouth. He sank further down on his cock while gingerly pushing one finger inside Cas’ hole. The angel moaned and his knuckles turned white from gripping the sheets too tight.
Also, yes, I know that John Winchester doesn't exactly deserve to be in heaven, but it just fit better with the story, so...
"Sorry, Babe. Hope this will make it up for ya", he said as he straddled Cas' hips and stroked him a few times with his lubed up hand. Cas moaned loudly, and then whimpered  when Dean stopped his movements and just held his cock at the base. The hunter shuffled forwards a little on his knees, then he raised his hips, lined Cas' cock up with his hole and braced himself for what's to come. He closed his eyes and lowered his hips again, sinking down onto Cas in one slow move while exhaling deeply, trying to stay relaxed in order to minimize the pain.
Dean grabbed his beer and took the last chug from the bottle.
“I wanted to ask you something about…your wings”, Dean said, cautiously. He wasn’t really sure if wings were a sensitive subject for angels or something. Cas placed his lecture beside him on the bed and looked at Dean with his head tilted adorably.
"Um- yes? I guess I don't really get why you're so surprised? I mean, we've been dating pretty much since the moment I started here" Dean says, still frowning at her, because
Dean pulls the car over to the side of the road. His hands aching from how hard he was holding the steering wheel. He puts the car in park, ripping himself out of the driver's seat and over into the brush of the side of the road; the stereo still playing. Dean hears the passenger side door click open and slam close. Dean turns to face him. He's aware of how wild he must look to Cas. But what does it matter? There isn't a thing in existence that can take them away from each other. From their profound bond. Except maybe words left unspoken.
"Hello Dean"
They'd known what they were walking into. A nest of vampires was old news. He thought he could do it in his sleep. He had seen the nail when they entered the barn but his adrenaline had spiked so high that he'd forgotten to take note of it.
"Why has he not bled out?"
It happened fast, Dean felt the nail slide in between his vertebrae. He knew he was done. He
Sammy.
- The garrison consists of two very rich, very old, very pious families. Well one very pious family, the other has strayed away from religion, nevertheless both remain very rich and very esteemed. They occupy estates so large a queen would have been jealous.
"What sort of operation are we talking here?" He asked.
Castiel decided right there and then he would have Dean Winchester no matter what it took. Even if he had to stay unsexually active for a year. Anyways it might be fun. He'd never been in a relationship before.
Dean grinned.
He slept in on his birthday. It must have been noon by the time Miracle gave him a single deep "woof". Her way of telling him, "You have four minutes to take me outside or I will pee right here on your bed and feel absolutely no guilt about it".
Dean reached down and lined himself up and Cas immediately began to lower himself onto his thick cock, both of them moaning at the sensation. Within a minute, Dean was buried to the hilt inside his angel and the blue eyed man used his angelic strength to move himself up and down onto Dean’s length. The hunter wrapped his arms tightly around the other’s slim waist and bucked his hips to meet Cas’ every downwards thrust. He angled himself slightly different until Cas cried out in pleasure, rocking his hips more erratically, and Dean knew he’d found his prostate. He made sure to hit that same spot on every thrust and soon the angel wasn’t able to do much more than holding on and moaning Dean’s name over and over.
(Is it possible to gift only one chapter of a multichapter fic to someone? Am I just too blind to find that option??)
"For example?" Dean questions. Cas sighs. Studying would have to wait for now.
Ash, who'd just silently listened to everything Dean and Cas told him, nodded and downed the rest of the beer he'd gotten for them before Dean started explaining.
Dean reached into the bedside drawer and pulled something out. He examined it closely, deep in thought. It was a ring. An engagement ring, to be exact. It was a plain silver band with a small blue stone inside, matching the color of Cas’ eyes. He had brought it a few weeks ago – he’d seen it while searching for hints on a hunt and immediately thought how perfect it would be for Cas – and he’d been thinking about when, where and how to ask his boyfriend to marry him since that day. But he didn’t want to do something too fancy like flowers and candlelight dinner and shit, he just wasn’t that type of guy. He didn’t think that this fancy, girly stuff would be important to Cas either. After all, he was a badass Angel of the Lord and not some chick who’d want a romantic setting and all.
"Yes, only him. I may be an idiot, but I'm not
"I'm sorry, mom. I just can't believe this is actually happing. It's just - it's just too good to be true", Dean said honestly.
Cas blushed a little and looked at the floor, ashamed, which Dean found somehow adorable.
"Are you sure, Dean? You said that your father would most likely flip out", Cas answers, and Dean can clearly hear the concern in his voice.
He'd promised Cas, who stayed at the bunker with Kevin, that they'd be back in three days.
Cas let himself relax entirely. The treatment brought great relief from the hot weather and he was on the verge of falling asleep, despite his cock that was half-hard and trapped between his stomach and the blankets.
“Yes, Sammy, we are going to get married, if it’s that what you wanted to say.”
“I-I love you, Cas”, Dean said, never breaking his gaze from his angel’s. Cas’ eyes watered immediately as he saw nothing but pure love and honesty in his lover’s eyes.
"Of course he is! Do you think I would cheat on him?" he asked, slightly pissy.
) and only visit heaven for a few hours once in a while to see whether he could help, had lived at the bunker and only hunted occasionally when there was something nearby for the last six months. Luckily, there hadn’t been anything
"Sam, please. Let me at least tell you what he said, okay?" He waited for Sam's confirmation before continuing. "He uh- he told me he was in rehab the last two years and that he checked himself in after a near death experience and the realization that he was lonely as fuck and wanted us back in his life. I mean, apparently he realized that he'd have to seriously get his shit together for that to happen. He sounded like a completely different man, Sammy. He apologized like, a thousand times and
"I love you, too, Dean", the angel answered and pressed another kiss to his soft lips, before he started to move again; slow, lazy circles of his hips against Dean's. He writhed on Dean's cock in ecstasy, breath hitching every time the head hit his prostate just right.
"Do you trust me, Babe?"
"Shit Dean, what the hell did you do this time?!" Sam asks, immediately assuming that he'd done something again.
“Hmm?” Cas murmured, already half asleep, as he lifted his head slightly to look at Dean.
As the two parted, Dean realised that most of the other guests had already settled down in their respective chairs, and Sam - who was Dean's best man, of course - as well as an angel Dean had never seen before but who was apparently a good friend of Cas' (obviously, or he wouldn't have chosen him as his best man) were already standing beside the altar. The angel who would wed them - Joshua, if Dean recalled the name correctly - was there, too.
“Seriously? After all those stares and stuff? I kinda figured it out some time ago.”
“Yes Dean?” Cas answered absentmindedly, not looking up from his book.
"This is- a lot to take in, sorry I...I don't really know what to think. On one side I'm- thrilled that he's alive and making an effort, apparently. And my heart tells me to give him a chance, too. But what if we end up getting hurt again? I'm not sure how we'd cope with all of that again, especially you."
“You’re right, dad. There’s actually one special thing because of which I wanted to visit you. And, well, I would really appreciate it if you could try and stay calm when I tell you, do you think you’ll manage that, dad?”
"That's quite alright, Sam, this won't be a problem at all", Cas said, sitting down in one of the uncomfortable motel chairs and proceeding with opening a book and starting to read, completely ignoring the other man while he waited for the bathroom to be free.
As Dean and Sam tried to find a good day for dinner and wrapped up the call, Cas got up from the couch and walked into the kitchen, pressing a kiss into Dean's hair as he passed him. He grabbed the cardboard box he'd set down on the island earlier and got two plates out of the cupboard. The box contained an apple pie from Dean's favorite bakery. He cut a large piece for Dean and a smaller one for himself and put them on the plates before heating them up in the microwave. He got the vanilla ice cream and put a big scoop on each plate, grabbed two forks and walked back into the living room, where Dean was just ending the call.
“Are we…Can we be considered ‘boyfriends’ now? I mean, if you aren’t comfortable with the term we don’t have to use it, I just thought it would be nice to have a term for this…You know I’m not good with human customs, but isn’t that what something like this would be called by – “, Cas babbled, a blush spreading across his face, but Dean cut him off with a quick kiss.
“What?” she asked confused. “Why is this so funny?”
"Cas!" Dean hissed, glancing between the two other men nervously. John put up both hands placatingly.
Fifteen minutes later, Dean, Cas, Sam and the others were standing on a beautiful clearing, a perfect circle surrounded by tall trees. There was an altar at the far end of the area and a handful of chairs placed in several neat rows on either side of the aisle.
all that. Oh god, he was fucked. Dean hastily decided to just end the call.
Dean drove the whole way without stopping for more than five minutes, wanting to be at his parent's house as soon as possible. Sam would be there, too, he'd called Dean earlier to say that he was coming from Stanford to visit their parents and ask if Dean would come, too. Dean had told him that he was busy and couldn't make it, wanting to surprise his family with their visit.
“You like them?” Dean asked, unnecessarily as the evidence was more than obvious through the fabric of Cas’ pants. “They came just this morning. I just had to put them on for tonight. For you.”
“Oh Dean,
, Dean thought to himself. He reached into the bedside drawer and pulled out the bottle of lube they kept there. Cas immediately spread his legs wider and bent his knees to grant Dean better access to his hole.
"That...sounds fair Dean. I- I am very grateful for this second chance, son. Thank you." And wait, was his dad, John fucking Winchester, really crying right now? Well, that was certainly new, too.
Dean quickly decided he wanted to take that one. "Cas represented me in a case. Did I mention he's a lawyer? He just made partner at his firm, actually," Dean started, pride obvious in his voice as he talked about his husband. "Anyway, some guy cut me off and it caused a minor traffic accident. It wouldn't even have been a big deal, insurance would've taken care of it, but the guy didn't want to admit that it was his fault and he made this huge thing out of it so it ended up in court. So I had to get a lawyer and Sam recommended Cas because he worked a summer job at his firm before and really looked up to him. After the case was closed I asked him out and..." Dean fiddled with his white gold wedding ring as he spoke, still unable to look his father in the eyes for more than a second at a time as he was still scared to see any sort of negative thoughts reflected in them.
Cas rocked his hips, changing the angle slightly so that Dean's dick brushed his prostate lightly with every movement, drawing breathy gasps from the blue eyed man. Dean braced his feet on the mattress and began to meet his thrusts, matching his lazy pace perfectly. Cas' hands rested on Dean's chest and he idly started to play with his husband's nipples, knowing how sensitive they were. Dean's hands found their way to Cas' hips, just holding on as the other man rode him into oblivion.
"Wow, um- Congratulations, then. I didn't even know you were in a relationship." Her tone indicates that it's meant as a question, even though it wasn't worded as one. Now it's Dean's turn to be confused because- what? Lisa turns to pour herself a cup of coffee and adds some sugar and milk. She's obviously trying to seem nonchalant but he can see the tension in her shoulders.
So, I hope you liked it, it was my first time writing bottom!Dean and I'd love to know what you thought. Also, I'm open for suggestions for that epilogue, if you even want one. Please let me know about that!
Dean thought he saw a flicker of uncertainty on John's features before he schooled his expression into something more neutral. Cas was already busy getting the pizza out of the oven, so Dean made his way to the front door once again. He paused for a second with a hand on the doorknob, taking a deep breath before opening the door to let his brother and sister-in-law in.
Cas let his legs fall back onto the mattress, Dean still seated between them. He watched as a thin dribble of his come leaking out of Cas stretched hole and he licked his lips before leaning down and lapping it up with his tongue. His boyfriend mewled softly and shuddered with overstimulation. Dean continued to lick into his entrance, then placed his lips around the opening and started to suck his own come out of him.
Just in that moment, the doorbell rang again. Mary got up and opened the door for Sam and his girlfriend Jessica.
“I just – I wanted to say sorry. I mean, I should have just left you alone when you told me you’re taken. I apologize for any trouble I caused between the two of you, it really hadn’t been my intention to hurt someone and...” she babbled, her face getting redder by the second.
"Sorry Babe", he said, and if he'd looked back at him, Cas would've seen the evil grin on the man's face right before he pressed down on his prostate with his fingers and started to rub
They watched a few movies, then Kevin went to bed and Dean and Cas were already dozing on the couch, so Sam decided to go to sleep, too. He could, however, not resist taking a photo of the cute couple on the couch with his phone before heading to his own room. Dean would probably kill him for that but he didn’t care.
He picked his phone up and searched for Charlie in his phone list. He pressed the green button and waited impatiently for her to pick up, falling back onto his bed as he did so. On the third ring, the call finally got accepted.
“You’re mine-- mine, Dean, no one else’s,” he gasped out in between thrusts, his hand gripping Dean’s waist hard enough to leave bruises. Good. “No one else can – oh. Can see you like this, Dean. Dean, ah, you feel so good, so perfect for me. I love you. I love you, oh,” Cas babbled, always a sure sign that he was nearing the edge of his orgasm.
Dean groaned deeply as the warm, wet heat surrounded him. Obviously, Cas had worked his mojo on himself again to ready his entrance for Dean’s dick. He was fully sheathed inside his angel in no time and Cas immediately began to rock his hips back and forth lazily, moaning softly. Dean thought that they weren’t close enough for his liking and tried to change their position, but he soon realized that the couch was far to narrow for that. He growled in frustration and Cas chuckled lightly, stilling his movements.
“I just asked myself why…I mean, I can see your wings, but it only started about three years ago and I can’t see the wings of all the angels at school, just a part of them, and I was wondering when humans can see them and why I wasn’t always able to see yours and why the others can’t see them at all and…” Dean rushed out quickly, but he stopped when he noticed the major blush spreading across Cas’ face. Dean waited for him to answer, but Cas just stared at his hands in his lap, clearly embarrassed about something.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'll go for afterwards, so I won't be worrying about Sam anymore and can fully appreciate my
Finally, he deemed Cas ready and removed his fingers gently, causing the other man to whine at the loss. Dean leaned down for a kiss, nipping playfully at Cas' bottom lip and sucking at his tongue until he groaned into Dean's mouth.
Bobby Singer lost his wife soon after they were married, he later remarried to a woman named Ellen Harvelle and adopted her daughter Jo. Bobby and Ellen are surrgate uncle and aunt to the Winchester boys.
"Look Private Winchester, I need to ask you if you can recall the name of the boy you saved from the Axis Troops."
Lights flashed around the the house and music blared. Drunk teenagers grinded and snogged and groped eachother to the beat. Castiel pulled Balthazar on to the dance floor and their hips fell in beat with the music. Balth leaned down slightly and stared sucked on Castiel's neck. Cas moaned and threw his head back. Sweat had quickly covered them in the hot room.
"Well I'll be damned." the man spoke with a ruff voice, it was a low tone. People from everywhere in the dank dim room watched Dean, mouths agape. Doctors and patients alike started clapping for a moment before remembering they were surrounded by injured men with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and the room fell silent again.
"Not quite. Your brother will live, and may even make a full physical recovery. The expression I wear upon my face is only darkend because soon after I finished your brother's operation I recieved news that while the battle at Stalingrad has ended, my older brothers both didn't make it, Lucifer and Michael. Fitting they might die together." He mumbled.
"What the fuck just happened?"
"Not even in your dreams Milton"
"I thought you would like not having to listen to ads anymore," Cas said, "I hope I got a good one, the girl at the store-" And there it was. Cas had gone to a music store on his own, a fallen angel in a forty-year-old vessel, walked up to some teenager and asked for her favorite Taylor Swift
"Dean!" Sam appeared in the doorway, tears in his eyes. There would be time to say the things he needed to. Cas would always come back to him. He knew it this time. Maybe he always did.
They didn't usually celebrate, but Donna and Jody had insisted. It had been the worst year the Winchesters had yet to have, and anyone knowing the Winchesters knew what that meant. Anyways, Dean wasn't even sure when the last time they had celebrated any holiday was and he missed his family.
The lyrics of the song brought a movie into his head, he remembered the first time he saw Cas. How lightbulbs shattered and thunder cracked. The shadow of his wings spread out on the walls. In one moment Dean was convinced he had met a man powerful enough to bring the earth to its knees. By the end of that year, Dean noticed the change.
"Gabriel, he was dead, not breathing, no heart beat, hell his chest was so ripped up I thought the only person I was helping by stitching him back up was whomever would come identify him. I never thought..." The man-Doctor Novak as his name tag read- looked to Dean's arm. "Hey i uh- don't know if you can hear me alright? But uh, on your arm well uh, see I'm the one who- for lack of better words-"
So there they were, Eileen and Sam getting married in a few months, baby Jack toddling around stealing electricity from power outlets, and Cas and Dean being essentially joined at the hip. Dean was happy. He was letting himself be happy. There was no impending doom. He got his best friend back. He was essentially a father now... with said best friend. But that was complicated. And the rest of his family was coming to see him because he did it, he survived the year. And fuck, that was an accomplishment to end all accomplishments.
"Jeez Cas, I almost died-"
And so it started as a joke, Dean would learn the words to the most annoyingly upbeat pop song he could and blast it on the way to wherever their next hunt took them. Sure, Sam bitched and moaned but he knew better than to touch Dean's stereo. Especially after the iPod incident of '09. Taylor Swift, it was, even if that meant driving from Lebanon to Wichita with only 'Shake It Off' playing in the background. This continued long after Dean had fixed his tape player, but Sam didn't need to know that. And even if he found out, Jack seemed happier listening to Miss Swift than Dean's usual classic rock selection. Two against one.
"What's up with you? I haven't even started driving yet". Cas looked down at his hands.
Dean shuffled after Eileen passed the laundry room towards the kitchen. But there he saw it. Right where he had left it what, three months ago? His jacket with the bloody fucking handprint on the left sleeve. Sam and Eileen hadn't dared to touch it and Dean had yet to bring himself to. If Eileen saw him stopping she didn't say anything. And then he was back in the barn, bleeding out in a broken body.
"Let's pop this baby in and see what she's got", Dean said. They listened to the first few songs in silence. Dean recognized a few of the songs from the radio like 'Out of the Woods' and 'Shake it Off' and found himself deep in thought at 'All You Had To Do Was Stay'. He was sure those words had been traded between him and Cas silently for years.
Dean was shaken out of his memory by Eileen's hand on his shoulder. She raised her eyebrows.
Sam shrugged and kept walking. He fucked around with a boy going into sophmore year. Embarrassing enough as Sam should be also going into his sophmore year, but with his grades it wasn't a suprise to anyone  when he was bumped up a grade, now going into is junior year, just a year behind Dean.
Not that Dean would admit it, but he liked a bit of fuss around his birthday. He never thought he'd make it past forty, Hell, he was only ten or so years away from outliving his old man. And dammit he wanted to. Not because it was a competition but because he had something to prove. He wanted a life beyond hunting. He wanted to hang up his fucking demon-killing knife one day and never touch it again. He wanted- well somethings he wanted Dean knew he just couldn't have. But in his head there was a plan for life that Dean wanted and dammit he wasn't ready to give up just yet.
He slept with a guy. He fucked a guy. He made love to a guy. He had sex, with a guy. Sam looked at the boy's features, they were familiar. Who did he know with black hair, pale skin, a killer jawline, fucking seven studs in one year-
Jesus fucking christ. Sam slept with the Garrison slut. Okay, that was rude. But rumor has it Castiel Milton fucked the entire cheerleading squad- in three days. Dean was gonna kill him... if he found out. Sam looked over at the boy again, he was fast asleep. Sam slipped on his underwear, pants, and shirt, gathering up his shoes and socks and running home.
Dean knew something was off the moment they got into the Impala. Cas was fidgeting, tapping his fingers on the dash and spacing out so far that Dean wasn't sure if he could pull him back in. He tried to ignore it. He ignored it all the way to the gas station. They picked out armfuls of snacks in complete silence. But nothing had changed by the time that they had gotten back into the car and Dean was sick of it.
"I love you, Cas. Have for a long time. I'm sorry I waited to say it until now.", Dean takes a stifled, shaky breath. "And I would really like to kiss you now".
be enough for him? Why? Dean can't just-
"Screw you Winchester!"
Sam walked through the hallways careful to avoid eye contact with any of the Garrison. He could just hope that Castiel would keep it a secret, Suddenly Sam was pulled into a dark room by a pair of smallish pale hands. The lights flickered on and he realized he was in a janitor's closet with Castiel Milton. He groaned and looked at the so-white-he's-almost-translucent boy. If neccesary Sam could easily get by Castiel, as the boy was a about a head and a half smaller than him, just under average height. The Garrison boy was smirking.
"Hey, uh- where's Cas?" Sam stared at him like it was odd he'd have to ask then answered.
"I wished for you, Cas. That night at the barn. When I blew out my forty-two candles. Every time I hear a Taylor Swift song. When I see bumblebees and watch old movies. I wish for you every day. I want you, now and forever. Until I'm old and wrinkly. And after too, after I die. I want to marry you, Cas."
As much as Dean loved seeing Jody and Donna and Claire and the other girls, he did not miss the jibes from Claire. Or the overwhelming mothering that came from Donna and Jody. And he especially did not miss the whispers between Alex, Patience, and Kaia everything he and Cas made any sort of physical contact, which yes, was frequent. Garth was just as bad when he showed up, his children off to play with little Jack. He knew if he and Cas got too close to Garth he would say something that would put their carefully constructed ease around each other at risk.
Castiel was expecting a confrontation from the older Winchester, he just hadn't expected it to happen so soon. It had been gym class and they were to be running laps. As always Castiel was the last to leave the locker room because he needed to remove all his piercings. Including nine ear piercings and a small silver rod in his cartitilage on his right ear. The coach just liked to give him hell because he knew about Cas' 'after school activities' and didn't quite approve. Castiel had always thought it was just because the man was a thirty two year old who had only ever been with one woman until he found out she was a lesbian and had been with her lover for several years before he found out, while Cas had already been with over twenty people including his niece April (She was on the cheerleading squad).
"Go get the first aid kit, Sammy", he said, his voice was quiet but commanding. Sam didn't argue, how could he? Dean didn't want to die.
He gentley took Cas' arms away from around his neck before walking backwards a few steps than turning around and heading for the door.Castiel had never felt like such trash in his life. With nothing but self pity in his chest he let out a big
lovingly, admiring every little detail of his handsome face while he waited for him to wake up too. When Cas blinked his eyes open slowly, Dean leaned forward and pressed a brief kiss to his soft lips.
"So, do you feel ready to take another trip to heaven right now?" Cas nodded slowly.
when I said I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.
“No, not them. Just dad. He’s never really been fond of this kind of thing…” Dean answered.
"I'm sure that won't happen, sweetheart. Sam is a very understanding man and he would never judge you for giving your father another chance, even if he himself won't do so. You should just talk to him, explain everything that John said and your feelings on the matter as well as the fact that you made your stance very clear to your father and you aren't making it easy for him. Sam has a big heart, he always sees the good in everyone and even though he and John never really got along, I think he secretly wishes for a good relationship between all of you, too, and will therefore also give him another chance to prove himself to you both. He may be even more critical than you and it may take quite a while to work through everything that happened in the past and establish a relatively normal family relationship, but I strongly believe that it can work as long as all three of you put in an effort and are willing to eventually forgive certain things that happened in the past. I will support you no matter what, you know that," Cas said, hoping that he was able to encourage his husband with his words. He knew that Dean still struggled with the events from his childhood at times and that his father's estrangement still hurt him deeply.
Cas crossed the room and straddled Dean’s legs on the bed. He leaned down and kissed him softly, then he pulled back and looked into those green eyes that he loved so much.
After breakfast, they took a shower together and then Dean remembered that he had an appointment with his therapist later that day. He was doing a lot better than just after Cas' left, but she still insisted on checking in with him every once in a while.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I will give you a chance. You can come over to our house and we'll have dinner and if I hear one, just one, word from you that is just in the slightest spiteful of the life I have buildt me here,
At this point, Cas was moaning and whimpering unashamedly, pushing back onto Dean's tongue in hopes to get it deeper inside of him. Soon, a finger joined the tongue, sliding easily into him. The ice cubes were nearly completely molten by now, unable to withstand the combined heat of his channel and Dean's tongue for long.
“I love you, too, Angel” he said, grinning, and then his lips were on Cas’ again, his tongue making his way into his mouth, exploring gently, while his hands wandered to Cas’ hair, messing it up even more. But suddenly, something Cas had said earlier came to his mind and he backed away again. Cas looked at him questioningly.
“If you’re here this means – this means you’re dead, right?” she murmured, shocked, tears starting to spill over. “Oh my god, you’re dead! No, no, no, you can’t-“ Mary was cut off when Dean wrapped his arms around her again and hushed her gently.
“Well, I think you should just shut your mouth, asshole” Dean retorted and resumed kissing Cas, effectively preventing him from either smiting the guy or saying something along the lines of
Sam went into the motel to rent them a room while Dean and Cas got their bags out of the trunk. At the front desk sat a bored-looking, half-asleep guy in his twenties, who didn't even muster up the effort to greet his costumer.
“I’m not sure I can ever forgive you”, she said, then paused, considering briefly. “Okay, I totally love you, so I probably will forgive you pretty quick, actually”, she grinned.
“Porn? Masturbating? What the hell are you even talking about?” he asked, confused. Sam gave him a bitch face.
Dean clenched around him on purpose, eyes fluttering shut at another perfect drag of Cas’ head against that special spot. “Yeah, baby, I’m yours, fuck, only yours,” he promised breathlessly, thrilling at Cas’ answering, broken groan.
a couple until today, but yeah, I'm sure they're great together", Charlie agreed. "Whelp, I really gotta go now, I'm supposed to be looking in on a surgery in...twenty minutes", she said, checking her watch. "See ya around, Kev!" she threw over her shoulder as she began hurrying down the hall.
The hunter sat up with on last peck to Cas’ hipbone and admired his lover’s body.
"Hey, Kevin", Charlie said casually as she met the other intern in the hallway about half an hour after her and Jo's talk with Dr. Novak.
"God, you're giving me a headache. That's so unnecessary!" Dean whines. Cas just grins at him devilishly. "Cas, why the hell do you torture yourself with this crap?!"
“Cas…they – they are beautiful.
“Well, that was probably because you immediately ran off to your room, don’t you think?” Sam said with a raised eyebrow. Dean grinned.
Dean knew Cas practically since he was born, just three months after Dean himself and they have been inseparable for the whole seventeen years they’ve already spent in this world. Nevertheless, Dean had only started to see Cas’ wings when they were fourteen. At first, he could barely make out their outlines, but as time went on, he became able to see them better gradually.
Still, the fingers pulled out a few seconds later, making Dean whimper at the sudden emptiness. He raised his head to watch Cas slick his impressive erection with lube. He let his legs fall open even wider, as wide as they would go, in anticipation of getting that thick cock inside him at last.
"Yes. Thank you again, Dean", John said, and Dean ended the call. He stood in the hallway for a good five minutes afterwards, mind still reeling from everything that's just happened. Eventually, he managed to regain enough control over his body to put the phone back and walk into the kitchen. Cas stood in front of the stove and was cooking something that smelled downright amazing. He walked up to his husband and wrapped his arms around him from behind, nuzzling his neck affectionately.
“Good morning, Dean”, Cas answered and rested his head against Dean’s chest. They stood like that for a few minutes, until Dean had to take the bacon out of the pan. He made toast and Cas set the table. Then they waited for Sam to join them so they could have breakfast. Dean grabbed his boyfriend around the waist again and lifted him onto the kitchen counter. He stood between his legs and leaned up for another kiss. Dean slid his tongue between the angel’s lips and they kissed slow and gentle and passionate, their hands tangled in each other’s hair.
“Mom. Mom, stop crying, please. I’m not dead. I’m fine, really. Please don’t cry.” His mother looked up at him, confused again.
Dean instantly felt as if a weight had been lifted off his shoulders as he heard the angel’s words. A wave of relief washed over him, and before he even knew what he was doing, he leaned down and kissed Cas tentatively.
Cas closed his eyes again, telling himself that he'd only be five more minutes before he'd actually get up and shower.
going to leave your husband alone on your wedding night. Not happening." She crossed her arms in front of her chest defiantly; she was clearly not going to let anyone change her mind on this. "I'm perfectly capable of staying in a room by myself, thanks. I'll take a room next to yours, if that helps, but only as long as you can promise me that I'm not going to have to listen to anything no mother ever wants to hear, capiche?" Mary said pointedly, with a raised eyebrow and a small smirk, and Dean blushed bright red at the implication.
“You ready?” he asked caringly, and eased himself inside his lover gently when he nodded and moaned.
Back at the bunker, they realized that Kevin was already asleep. They headed to their room and into the adjoining bathroom to take a shower together. Under the hot water, Dean quickly washed himself and then took his time with Cas, kissing and stroking and massaging every inch of his body with aching tenderness. He avoided his cock though, which was rock hard after half an hour of Dean’s loving ministrations and Cas accepted it, knowing his lover would take care of him soon. He let himself be dried off and led to the bedroom, where he was laid down onto their bed gently.
“Did you really expect them to hate you for loving me?”
“Am I hurting you, angel?” Dean asked caringly. Cas shook his head and he moaned at the feeling of Dean’s thick cock entering him. His eyes rolled back in his head and he grasped Dean’s hands tightly as the hunter bottomed out inside of him.
"Hey Jo, have you noticed anything strange about Dr. Novak lately?" Nurse Charlie asks her blonde coworker, trying to sound casual. They were both on break from their shift in the cardiology wing of the hospital. Charlie was one of Dr. Novak's interns and she was convinced that something was wrong with the blue eyed man, she just had absolutely no clue what it could be. She was sure that if he were actually sick he would never be performing surgeries, the risk of infection was way too high and he wouldn't dream of putting a patient in danger.
“I wasn’t aware you reciprocated my feelings towards you. I really hoped you would.”
So, here's the promised chapter with Charlie. I really hope I've written her alright. It' a little short, but I wanted to post it, so here you go.
"That's great guys, really," Sam said happily. "You were gonna say, Dean?"
He couldn't tell Cas about this. He would just lose his best friend then, and he surely wouldn't be able to bear that. But he also knew that it was going to be damn painful to push his feelings aside and continue on as if everything was still the same.
And then his mouth is on Cas', kissing him passionately and for the first few seconds Cas is too stunned to reciprocate but then his brain catches up with everything and his arms wrap around Dean's shoulders as he kisses him back enthusiastically.
” at Dean and Cas, while Dean was bitching about the fact that they were making bets on their relationship.
"You're engaged to
"Good morning, Lisa!" Dean greets her enthusiastically. She looks up at him, obviously surprised by his good mood. He can't blame her, it's not exactly a secret that he'd rather work anywhere else. In fact, she's one of the few people at work who know that he's currently looking for another job. So yeah, her being surprised is kinda a given. Though she recovers quickly.
“I drained my ‘mojo’, as you’d call it. I just needed to rest and recharge”, Cas answered matter-of-factly. Sam nodded in understanding.
"Dad," he finally managed to choke out. John's smile grew a bit wider.
I'm not sure what's better: short chapters with less time in-between or long chapters with more waiting for you? Opinions?
"Yeah, I agree. Well, I mean, I didn't even know that they
“Okay, so, I actually came here to invite you to…to my wedding. With Cas”, Dean rushed, lacing his fingers together with Cas’ while he talked. Both his parents stared at him for several moments, dumbfounded. Then, Mary squealed in delight and threw herself first at Dean and then at Cas, congratulating them enthusiastically.
"Nothin'", Dean replies gruffly, not being in the mood to deal with his annoying little brother. But of course it wouldn't be that easy to get rid of him.
The hunt had been really easy, compared to all the shit they'd faced over the last couple of years. Dean was especially glad that they finished earlier, because Sam had been teasing him non-stop since he found out that Dean set the photo he'd taken of them a few days ago as his background picture on his own phone.
"No Dean, it will be okay, I'm sure", the angel assured him.
“Well, that actually went better than I imagined”, Dean said as he let himself flop backwards onto the bed. Cas tilted his head questioningly.
(PS: This hasn't been proof read yet but it's two am and I wanted to post before going to bed so please feel free to point out any mistakes)
Dean sighed. It was finally Friday and he had a long, exhausting week behind him. He just ended his shift at his 'uncle' Bobby's garage and went to the nearby coffee shop directly after. He was in drastic need of some caffeine.
Being out of his clothes brought little relief, as did the ventilator they'd set up in their room a few days prior. Honestly, all he wanted was a cold shower and maybe he'd move into the fridge afterwards. Yes, that was a good idea, he thought. The only problem was that Cas was way too tired and exhausted to even lift a single finger, let alone get up off this amazingly comfortable mattress - memory foam, of course - and go into the bathroom. Instead, he fell asleep right where he was lying, his last thought being that this probably wasn't the most comfortable sleeping position and he'd probably have a crick in his neck by the time he woke up.
Thanks for reading, it'd make my day if you could take a minute and tell me what you thought!
“Good. Can we get going soon?”
When Sam came back into the main room of the motel approximately fifteen minutes later, his eyes very nearly popped out of his head as he took in the sight that greeted him. His brother was lying on his side on one of the two beds, which of course wasn't the reason for his surprise.
"Dean, um, about the sleeping arragements tonight, I--" he started, but Dean cut him off in the middle of the sentence.
The next week, Cas started his work as a teacher at the local high school and visited Dean at his workplace after he finished.
Cas felt amazing, his tight heat wrapped around Dean so perfectly. He didn’t move for a moment, letting them both adjust to the sensations, before he pulled out slowly and pushed right back in just as slow. He eventually built a lazy love-making rhythm, his thrusts slow and deep and long. Cas whispered his name constantly, interspersed with small moans.
"Hey, hey I just said I'm not going to /shower/ with you", he said soothingly and pressed a kiss to Cas' temple. "Let's have a bath instead", he whispered as seductively as he could manage, half asleep as he was.
"Do you need to clear your head a bit more," he asked, voice laden with suggestion as he trailed a hand down his husband's firm chest, "or would you rather have your reward after your talk with Sam?" He watched as Dean's eyes darkened with arousal at the implication and he seemed to consider the offer carefully.
Charlie cleared her throat hesitantly, catching the doctor's attention. He looked up at her and she decided to take the plunge and just ask him if he was okay.
"You have?! Oh my God, Dean, I'm so happy for you! You two will be great as parents!"
When they entered the kitchen, Sam, who sat at the table, cocked an eyebrow at them.
"You wanna catch some flies, Sammy?" Dean asked with a smirk. Sam snapped his mouth shut and gave him a bitchface.
bad yet.
He got dressed, and by the time he was ready, Cas had already mojo’d himself dry and dressed. Dean stepped close for another kiss, running his fingers through those soft, dark strands of sex hair while kissing him deep and passionately. They broke apart eventually and the hunter huffed out a laugh. Cas’ hair was totally messed up, even more than usually. The angel did his adorable head-tilt and Dean just wanted to kiss him and never ever stop. Unfortunately, he was pretty sure Sam wouldn’t be too pleased about that.
“Geez, Sam, let a guy have his good-morning shower sex, will ya?” he called over his shoulder with a smirk. Sam just rolled his eyes, clearly thinking his brother was joking. Cas had to hold back the grin that threatened to creep onto his face and followed his boyfriend towards the parking lot, Sam not far behind.
even, for something, anything? Yeah, totally unexpected. Dean could feel his resolve crumbling, even though he'd always told himself that he didn't need his dad and that he could go to hell these past ten years. Hell, longer, even. He'd tried to convince himself of that whenever he missed his family, how it was before his mother died. But he couldn't help the little blossom of hope growing in his chest. Hope that his dad actually had changed and they could try and mend the cleft the past years had opened up between them. Because even after everything, John was still his dad and was it even possible for someone to hate their own blood enough to never give them a chance ever again?
He dragged Cas down into a messy kiss as he began thrusting, slow and steady and careful at first. “C’mon, sweetheart, show me who I belong to,” Dean egged him on, letting their lips brush as he spoke. “I know you want to –
Hund', '
“So eager, aren’t we?” he said teasingly and leaned in to kiss his angel briefly before turning the water on and adjusting its temperature. He got under the spray and motioned for Cas to join him, then he squeezed some shampoo into his hands and started working it into the angel’s dark hair. At first, Cas looked at him as if he wanted to say something like
"He told the truth, beloved. She is real", the angel said softly, his gaze on Mary. She too looked as if she wasn't sure this was really happening. She did, however, come over to the two of them as she noticed the tears that were sliding down her son's cheeks and dripping from his chin silently.
"Yeah, of course, and I don't even know how to thank you for this. But what I meant is; won't he be lonely, now that she is not there anymore?"
This, Dean really couldn’t argue and he kissed back with just as much eagerness. His hands found their way to Cas’ back, stroking up and down while they continued their kiss. Cas’ hands roamed over his chest and the angel brushed his nipples a few times, making Dean groan. They were both fully hard after only a few minutes of their heavy make-out session. Dean had just realized that they didn’t have any lube in here, when Cas rose up a little, gripped the hunter’s precome-dripping cock and began to sink down onto him.
“I’m gonna take a shower, then we’ll come to your room.”
“Well, now you know”, Dean answered with a smirk.
"So 'dog' is male, 'cat' is female and 'horse' is neither? What the actual fuck? That doesn't make any sense to me!"
Dean's hands moved towards the row of buttons on Cas' shirt and he started to undo them one by one, kissing the newly revealed skin almost reverently. Once all the buttons were undone, Cas sat up a little so that he could slip the shirt off and throw it onto the floor.
. Sam just sat there, frozen, trying to contain his fury. His brother had finally found someone who loved him just as much as Dean loved them and douche bags like this guy just destroyed this.
Cas sighed as Dean lessened the onslaught on his sweet spot in favor of adding a third finger, spreading them wide to prepare him for his bigger-than-average cock.
“Sorry for waking you, Babe,” he said and pressed a kiss into Cas’ hair, before settling back down to continue to sleep. But his boyfriend had other ideas and he sat up to straddle Dean. With a mischievous grin, all their clothes vanished and Dean gasped in shock as the cool bunker air hit his exposed skin. He raised an eyebrow at Cas and had just opened his mouth to say something like
