“Yeah, yeah, other things on your mind,” Dean says. “It’s really not complicated bud.”
“You are like a lightning bug,” Cas says, testing out the name Dean prefers. “Small and unassuming. But against the dark, you glow brighter than all other creatures on God’s earth.” Cas catches himself, sitting up on his knees. He looks at Dean, aware that being this low in the grass is causing his knees to ache. What Cas doesn’t know is how his grace (that Dean now wears around his neck) warms against Dean’s skin.
Dean exhales, distracting himself with his own juice box. “Not if you don’t want to,” he says, fiddling with the plastic around the straw. “I know someone needs to stay with Jack, but I was thinking if we went early, before Bobby drops him off.”
? “We’ll get you a shower back home. And chuck those in the laundry. Do you know if detergent takes this stuff out?”
Dean leans his head away, briefly. “Hey,” he says, feigning insult. He leans back in; his breath is warm against Cas’ chest. “Didn’t mean to take so long.”
He’s lost – not that he started with much to go off of. He doesn’t know where he’s going or how to get there. All he knows is that he needs to find Cas. He needs to say it.
Dean slams the breaks, sending Cas forward into the dash. He puts his hands up just in time to catch himself. Dean steers Baby off to the side of the road. They both bounce in their seats, jostling left and right. Dean stops Baby in the grass, shifting into park. He unclips his seatbelt and slides over to meet Cas. Dean grabs Cas by the lapels, pulling him in by fistfuls of his trench coat, and crushes his lips into Cas’.
Cas’ hand rests on the post of the stair railings. He looks back up at Dean, expectantly. He knows what he’s waiting for.
Dean watches, swallowing roughly. Saliva and mucus and blood scrape against the raw lining of his throat.
His hands clenched into tight fists. He doesn’t
They keep from the glow of the fire, preferring the illumination of the fireflies. Dean’s grip never falters, stepping back and forth in the grass, letting the cool of the night settle around them. The crickets begin chirping and trilling away, a back-up chorus to the strum of guitar. They don’t fall back in time with the music, not that Cas minds. They’ve always danced to the beat of their own drum anyways.
“What’s the magic word?” Dean asks.
Little does Sam know, the wait will merely be another thirty seconds or so.
Dean walks back out of his room, ignoring the plants and the keys and the books that linger and taunt him around the bunker. He goes to the Dean Cave, where Sam set up the rocking chair.
“I’m not done my orange juice,” Cas says, only handing Dean is half-eaten sandwich.
Dean stops breathing.
Cas frowns. He traces the grime staining his one hand. His skin is sawdust, it’s like gunpowder. “It’s still on me,” he says, digging the pads of his fingers into his skin. He can't scrub it off, he wants to claw out of his skin.
Dean sucks a breath in through his teeth, nearly strangling himself from the pain. He’s gasping for breath, but he has to remain diligent. It’s the only thing he can think of to get Castiel to look at him, to get Cas back. “Cas, it’s me. I know you’re in there. I know you are.”
Cas frowns. “We’re dancing?” he asks, feeling himself sway gently with Dean.
“I forgive you, Cas,” he says, every syllable muffled and malformed, “We’re family. We need you.”
Cas tilts his head in challenge and says in an equal tone, “Nice catch.” He shuffles back to Dean, reclining back against the back of the box. He rests his head against Dean, who remains sitting up. Half his sandwich is already gone.
She directs her attention to Dean, giving him a smile he can't quite place. “Are you happy, here?” Charlie asks, stepping back.
Dean has offered many expressions to Cas over their time together, from the basic expressions of joy or anger or fear, or the indescribable ways Dean would twist his face when everything was on his mind and he had no words to explain his feelings. How many stares had they shared, just the two of them, how many gazes had they saved just for each other? How many looks were reserved just for the two of them, expressions that only they could decipher?
It blankets him, it smothers him, it suffocates him.
Dean enters the library in a rush, a gust of air rustling some loose papers on the table. There is a gleam in his eyes that Sam hasn’t seen in a long time. It makes Sam pause.
They’d been distant for so long, dancing around each other to avoid saying how they really felt. Maybe that’s why they got into so much trouble over the years. They could never be hand in hand, dancing to the same beat. But after twelve years, you’re bound to learn a thing or two. Cas certainly has. He doesn’t know what sort of life he would have if he’d never met Dean. He wonders if he’d even have a life to begin with. The opportunity to dance to the same tune as Dean Winchester, that’s more than enough to remind Castiel of everything he has to live for.
“Happy five months,” Dean grins up at him, pressing his face into the space of Cas’ neck. “What sort of snacks did you pack?”
It’s how he used to feel about Cas, before they had gotten to know each other. Before Cas defied Heaven’s plans.
Cas doesn’t need to look to know that Dean is grinning in his arms. He tightens his grip on Dean, swaying back and forth in the grass. Dean chuckles at that, and begins humming something in tune with the distant music. It’s intimate, something Cas never realized he craved so much. It’s also something he could get used to.
“Yes please,” Cas says, already one foot out the door.
“Maybe. Are you?”
“That works too.”
“Alright, Jack, here you go,” Dean says, bringing the bottle up to Jack’s mouth. Jack latches on instantly, his cries replaced by soft suckling. Dean lets the bottle rest against his hand as Jack feeds. Jack’s face finally relaxes as he swallows the formula. Dean can finally sigh in relief. He watches the amount of formula in the bottle, and estimates when Jack has had half the bottle’s contents.
"You're something else with those bees," Dean says as he brushes the crumbs off his hands. He rests his hands on his thighs, pressing down against his muscle. He asks, “Are you coming grocery shopping tomorrow?”
“Of course,” Cas says, not bothering to hide his exasperation. “Juice box?”
Cas can hear his footsteps through the grass. He’s back from inside the house, from putting Jack down for the night.
Cas shakes his head. “I find the voices grating.”
It was supposed to get easier. Dean could at least time the bottle right.
“That’s okay. We can nap here together. How does that sound?”
The rain hits the top of his head, and he squints as it rolls down his forehead. Dean is already halfway to the other side, saying, “I can’t believe you’re making me get out of this truck back in the rain just to switch seats because you can’t drive out of a goddamned ditch!”
Dean stands at the furthest edge of the circle, not wanting to get too close to the flames. He’s been close enough to fires for his lifetime. In an unusual twist of roles, he observes his family around the fire.
“Yeah,” Dean relaxes in his seat, one arm extended to steer. “I liked it. The stargazing. And I like you, so.” He goes quiet, biting at his lip.
The corners of Dean’s mouth turn down as he watches Jack.
It’s all-consuming, it’s his every day, these feelings, the pain that somehow hurts like hell. Dean doesn’t know what to do with it. He doesn’t know where he’s supposed to put it, where he can lock it away, because Cas is intertwined with his soul, the faded handprint on his shoulder. He doesn’t know what to do without him, and Dean needs him.
Black spots dance across Dean’s vision, and he almost thinks the look in Castiel’s eyes change, that the tension in the shoulder with the angel blade loses tension. But Dean can barely tell what’s up and what’s down.
“I thought you didn’t like kid cooties?” Cas asks, taking the first bite of his sandwich.
Jody and Bobby talk across from them, one of Jody’s hands gripped tightly in Donna’s. Donna’s got her chin propped up in the palm of her other hand, listening intently to whatever story Bobby’s chosen for the particular moment. Rufus is to the other side of Bobby, taking a sip of beer. Mary's stepped out of her chair to add a log to the fire.
And he doesn’t know how to do it. Right now, Dean is anything but the person that Cas calls his best friend.
“Cas, this isn’t you,” Dean says through gritted teeth, blood trailing out of his mouth. “This isn’t you!”
This time, it makes Dean laugh, too. They’re giddy on life, they’ve got love pumping through their veins. Who would have thought this is what it felt like to receive what you deserve?
And worst of all: he won’t stop talking.
Cas raises his brow at Dean. “Like a date? At eight in the morning?”
They deserve their happy ending. They all do.
“Whatever you say, dear,” Cas says before shuffling down the bed to drag the cooler closer.
It used to startle him, the raised red handprint so fittingly placed on his arm. Such a stark contrast, Dean could never place why the mark Castiel had branded him with had bothered him more than any other scar he’d received, from hunting or otherwise. He rolls the offending shoulder just at the thought.
The wind picks up, cool against Dean’s cheeks as he breathes in sharply. Despite the three months that had passed since The Empty had claimed Cas again, he finds himself caught off guard by the simplest of things. The coffee mug he used to share with Cas. A small, wilting plant for sale at the hardware store. The colour of orioles.
So much of his time taking care of Sam was filled with anger and vitriol – all meant for his father, some even at his mother. He was just a kid – he wasn’t meant to be a parent. Sammy was supposed to be his annoying little brother, not his child who depended on Dean to survive.
Sam shakes his head slightly, trying to understand where his brother is coming from with all of this. “Yeah, but just because we’re free of God’s control doesn’t change the facts of life and death.”
Cas licks his lips, hands flexing against the steering wheel. His mouth opens, closes. Then he says, “I don’t know how to drive out of the field.”
Dean wraps himself around Cas, hunching over to protect him from the wind. He presses his warm cheek to Cas’ cold one. He squeezes his eyes shut. In Cas’ ear, Dean whispers, “We’re going home.”
With everything that happened during their first ‘round trip to purgatory, after losing Cas’ grip and returning without him, Dean swore he would never come back. And yet here he is, lost amongst the forest, desperately avoiding the Leviathans.
The firefly on Cas’ finger spreads its wings tentatively. It half-closes its wings before spreading them again, this time fully, and taking off. It flies up into the air to join the other small beads of light around them.
His boots squelch against the goo on the ground of The Empty. It’s dark, it’s damp, it’s desolate.
Dean looks at Cas and he sees everything he never knew he wanted from this life, he sees things he never dreamed were possible for him. He sees himself with a life, and its waiting for him with open arms.
“When you married me?” Cas suggests, raising his left hand up, wiggling his fingers back and forth. His ring gleams in what little moonlight remains. He opens the cooler and starts digging around. He tosses a bag to Dean.
He wonders if Cas has ever felt the same. Sure, Cas had said the combination of
Dean walks over to the fridge, and bends down to look for the bottles at the back of the fridge. He has to stop swaying to stick his hand far enough back. Jack wails, his pitch making Dean’s ears ring. Dean walks back to the sink, and sets the bottle in the container. He hits his fist against the counter, closing his eyes. He doesn’t mean for it to be as loud as it is. Thankfully, Jack is screaming loud enough that the added noise doesn’t add to the baby’s distress. But it certainly doesn’t help.
“The whole world!” Jack says, his hands resting on Dean’s head. It’s only then that Dean remembers there’s still marshmallow goo on Jack’s hands.
He saved the world so they could all go home at the end of the day and live comfortably and happy for the rest of their lives. He did not save the world to be left alone with his best friend dead and the words hanging from the tip of his tongue. Cas deserved to hear them. He deserved to know that he was just as loved, every bit as much as he loved Dean in return.
It makes everyone double over laughing, and Jack laughs right along with them. Dean stands next to Sam and Eileen’s chair, watching the fire.
Dean throws a diaper cloth over his shoulder and reaches into the bassinet and lifts Jack out. “Hey, buddy,” he says, getting his arms properly under Jack. “That’s a big fuss for one little man.”
“I love you,” Dean says.
say it, because Cas knows. He knows Cas knows, so what reason is there to waste time for a few measly words. He knows.
Dean's eyes flick back to Cas, and he can see it written all over Cas' face. "Okay," he says, his tone metaphorically changing gears. "Talk to me."
“Well if I’m your dear,” Dean says, catching the sandwich, “then you are washing marshmallow goo out of my hair the next time I find it.”
. And now he’s going to lose him. He and Cas are going to die in purgatory and he hasn’t said it.
. Dean didn’t realize he’d stopped humming.
He takes the bottle away, and brings Jack up to his chest to burp him. Dean pats his back, and hums as he paces back and forth in the kitchen. He rubs circles on Jack’s back, listening closely for a burp.
Dean checks the LED light of his alarm clock – Jack had nearly made it two hours.
Did Cas know what he was doing when he said goodbye? Did he realize how terribly broken it had left Dean here, on his own? Did Cas know that he meant to say it, that he
The oriole chirps once more before flying away. As the oriole flies off, Dean notices the black feathers that envelope the rest of its small body. It reminds him of the black ooze that swallowed Cas, stole him for good.
“I promise," Dean says, his voice hoarse from disuse, "I’m not coming back without him." The softness of his words blow with the breeze, and the oriole continues singing. The meadow had always been Cas’, anyways.
“Yeah, I want you back, and I got you back.” Dean says, his voice rising again.
The clouds begin to part, and the muted sunlight of purgatory seeps through the branches. Dean takes a deep breath in.
“Yes.” Cas says. He doesn’t quite understand what Dean is missing. “Is that okay?”
The Empty is up to his knees now, soaking into his clothes, bleeding into his skin. Each step forward is an effort, and he isn’t making any ground.
“Ah, shit,” Dean says, grabbing his garbage and juice box. He moves up to the cooler and throws his garbage in. He holds out a hand to Cas and says, “Here, hand me your stuff.”
Sweetness belonged to food, consumables containing copious amounts of sugar. Sometimes, it belonged to something cute, like wide-eyed puppies or curious kittens. It was the celebratory exclamation at the end of a Candy Crush game indicating success.
He hears the rustle of wind between the leaves. He hears the orioles sing.
What he wouldn’t give to bring Cas back and tell him. To apologize for the anger and explain the strange swirl of emotions he’s felt over the past months, the past years. If only he knew the words. He hardly feels an “I’m sorry” would be enough in this instance.
Dean is wrong a lot in his life, he’s always making mistakes, blind to the obvious. But this is the first time he doesn’t mind being proved wrong. For the first time in a very long time, being wrong can be something good. He doesn’t have a lot of love to give, he thinks, and he doesn’t quite know how to deliver what love there is, but he’s trying. He’ll make it work. He’ll figure it out.
Dean hasn’t said it,
“Jesus!” Dean exclaimed.
. The bunker isn’t Castiel’s home, not really. It is a place to stay, very graciously offered by the Winchesters. He doesn't have a home. Once, long ago he considered Heaven a place to belong. He'd strove for acceptance amongst his peers, his brothers and sisters. He never managed to accomplish it. Heaven would never be home.
“Cas.”
Castiel removes a hand from the angel tablet, and tentatively reaches towards Dean.
If they’re going to get stuck here again, if they’re going to die, then maybe Dean has one last chance to make it right. He has a lot to be guilty about, but he can’t,
Charlie is in the lawn chair next to them, albeit further back. She’s got a very squirmy three-year old in her lap. Jack is wiggling around, reaching towards the fire, and Charlie keeps him firmly in her grasp.
Dean lets his eyes shut, his brow furrowing. He tries to picture Cas happy, not the look on his face as he was enveloped in The Empty. All he can see is the dying smile on his face, tears streaming down his cheeks.
Dean groans at the lack of warmth. “Since when am I your ‘dear’?”
Cas tosses the box to Dean, which he fails to catch. It bounces against the mattress. “Nice throw,” Dean says, sarcastic.
The words were on the tip of his tongue. He never got to say them. He has to get it right. Because a life without Cas isn’t the life for him.
meant to say it? The thoughts replay in his mind over and over:
A door on the truck unlocks as Cas reaches into the back for a large duffel bag. He opens the closure on the top and pulls out the old comforter. He tucks the now empty bag under the mattress in the truck bed, and shakes the blanket out. Another slam of the truck door rings out across the wide expanse of field. Cas spreads the comforter out against the mattress.
The meadow is a vibrant rainbow; the colours burn at Dean’s eyes. The pinks of the primrose and violets of the larkspur. The greens of the clover and the yellows of the goldenrod. The oranges of the daylily and the reds of the begonia.
The moonlight slices through the clouds, illuminating a sliver of Dean’s face. Dean’s eyes are searching Cas’. His lips are pressed tight together. “And now? You know now that –”
How could a lie possibly sound so sweet?
The screech of a far-off Leviathan pulls Dean from his thoughts. He checks the timer on his phone. Less than three minutes left.
He’s trusting his gut; he’s trusting his heart.
“Dean,” Cas says, squinting at the bang of a rock against Baby’s exterior.
Dean steps towards Cas, offering Cas his hand. Cas takes Dean’s hand, stepping up to meet him. Before Cas can step away and give Dean the space he so often desires (yet rarely abides by these days), Dean steps further into Cas’ space, still holding his hand, and rests his other hand on Cas’ back. He starts swaying as in time as he can get to the distant music.
Dean sets Jack on the changing table, and changes the kid’s diaper. All throughout, Jack’s eyes are trained on Dean.
“It was good,” Dean says once he’s happy with his speed. He turns the speed of the windshield wipers up. “I had a good time, while it lasted.”
But when Dean was touching him, holding him up against the meadow grass – that was real, that was right. Cas could feel that. It was Dean.
Jack finishes the bottle, and Dean sets it back down on the counter. He brings Jack up to his shoulder again, and starts patting his back. This time it’s a bit of a wet sound.
When Cas returned from his first time confined to The Empty, he and Dean had come back out to the meadow. It was then that Cas had identified the various flora and fauna that inhabited the environment. Dean couldn’t keep up with all the scientific names Cas was listing off; he was too busy staring at Cas with a wide grin spreading across his own face. But the birds with the orange bellies stood out to Dean. The colour of the oriole bellies reminded Dean of the warmth Cas brought to his life. Like the rind of a nearly-ripe orange, or the sweetness of honey. Cas was always fascinated by the bees.
Cas shuts his eyes. It’s rough and it’s rushed and he’s never felt so grounded. He isn’t in The Empty, he isn’t in the impala. He’s in Dean’s arms, he’s in the meadow. They’re warm under the sun, the heavy weight of clouds passing overhead. He can feel the petals of the wildflowers, the sharp point of thorns on the stems.
“I’ve also heard them referred to as fireflies.”
He keeps walking. He keeps praying.
Dean can’t hold back his smile.
If only he could make himself say it. But he knows.
“Well like with any vehicle, you’re going to put it in drive, and then you’re going to steer towards the road and you’re going to drive up the ditch.”
The Empty let them go. It regurgitated them into the tall grasses of the meadow.
“Dean,” Sam starts, “they’re dead. You know that, right? They’re dead and gone and we need to move on.”
All the way back to the bunker,
“Yeah, fair enough bud,” Dean says. His eyes cloud over as he focuses on the different stations. He eventually settles on some old country station. He keeps the volume low; Cas can’t make out which artist is playing.
Dean leans back in the chair, and starts rocking back and forth. Jack makes a small sound, and Dean gives him a small pat. “I know. Imagine how I feel?” Dean rocks back and forth, watching Jack. He starts humming, one of the songs from Cas’ mixtape. He can’t bring himself to look at it, still sitting on Cas’ bedside table, but he can hum some of the tunes. He can’t bring himself to whisper the lyrics; they are no match to the ones Cas dreams up. Cas isn’t here for Jack, but Dean can do his best to lend pieces of him out to their baby.
They’re in South Dakota, spending the weekend with Jody and the girls. They’re having a fire, to remember all those they lost along the way, and celebrate the return of family (which are two groups with quite a bit of overlap – not that anyone is complaining).
“I can bring you something warm, too? Hot chocolate?”
“Yeah,” Dean says. Cas can see him fighting against his emotions. “He seems really happy with it. With Eileen. Sammy’s got the life he deserves. Can you believe it?” Dean tries to hide the thickness of his voice behind surprise. It doesn’t fool Cas.
The ooze continues circling up Dean’s legs, encasing his calves. It’s holding him back, dragging him down.
Dean nods, the corners of his mouth turning up, the lines in his face deepening. “Okay,” he says, slapping Cas on the shoulder. His voice is even, steady. “Then we’re going home.”
Dean wipes the wetness from his cheeks with the backs of his hands. He gives one last silent goodbye to the meadow before retreating back to the impala. He plays with the keys in his pocket, the distinct jingle of metal removing him from the dream-like serenity of the meadow and back to reality. He turns back to the meadow, staring at the sky as blue as Cas’ eyes. He lets the warm spring air fill his lungs. He sees the oriole return to its previously abandoned branch. The oriole whistles two notes at him. He smiles.
Cas leans down to kiss Dean again, remaining chaste. Dean’s eyelashes flutter, tickling Cas’ cheeks. “Happy five months.”
The distinction between human skin and angel claim has faded over the many years since his return from hell. Much like how Cas has made a life for himself amongst humanity – adopting the intricacies that come with a life on earth. Sure, he’s still got some catching up to do here and there, but it’s those unpredictable missing pieces that makes Castiel
Dean brings Jack back into his arms, and reaches back for the rest of the bottle. “See?” Dean asks, watching Jack suckle on the bottle. “You’re okay. We’re okay” Jack coos, his eyes open now. He looks straight at Dean, and Dean tries to ignore the way his chest constricts.
“It’s a good sandwich!” Dean says, his mouth half full.
Cas never realizes its the rhythm of his own heartbeat that Dean chooses to follow.
“It was one time –”
“Take my chair,” Charlie calls out. “I’m ready to stretch my legs out.” She reaches a hand up to tickle Jack. He giggles, setting one of his sticky hands on hers. She retracts her hand just as quickly.
Dean lets his eyes slip shut as Castiel brings the hand to cup his face. He claws at Castiel’s wrist, digging his nails into the fabric of the trench coat. One small reassurance before he goes. He inhales sharply.
The blue of Cas’ eyes.
“Do I know the guy?”
“Apple?”
Dean hands the entire container of wet wipes to Cas, who takes them without question, setting them down in the grass next to his chair.
“Just leave it in the back,” Cas says, going up to the driver’s door. He opens the door and settles back into his seat. He turns the ignition, and lets the engine run. The rain, steadily falling now, plinks and plops against the windshield. Cas turns the wipers on as Dean steps into the passenger side.
It's not Cas' fault.
Cas raises his eyebrows.
“That’s not what I said.”
Jack squirms, still wailing.
Cas settles back into Dean’s space, hesitating only for a moment. His other hand rests on Dean’s shoulder, perfectly matching the handprint under the flannel. He likes how his hand fits there, he likes how it feels. He looks up at Dean’s face, and is still surprised by how beautiful he looks when he is content. Dean is always beautiful, but Cas can’t deny that Dean smiles more nowadays, he laughs and jokes with ease, he loves more openly than Cas has ever known him to. It’s this ease they live their everyday lives with is something he would like more of.
He’s looking into Cas’ eyes.
Cas feels a cold drop on his hand. He inspects it, thinking it’s from the straw of his juice box. But the juice box is in his other hand. Another drop lands, this time on his cheek, then another on his head. He looks up, and smiles.
“That’s much better,” Dean says as he lifts Jack up to his shoulders, exaggerating the effort required. Jack giggles as he’s swung up to Dean’s shoulders, his legs dangling down against Dean’s chest.
“Yeah, they’re pretty cute,” Dean says, “but you can just call them lightning bugs, bud.”
“Cas, that kid is permanently sticky. I’m still washing marshmallow goo out of my hair.”
He lied to Cas, to himself. They weren’t just friends, and they weren’t just best friends. Dean’s heart belonged to him, it has for years now. He was too scared to say it, but he should have. He failed him, for not letting him know sooner. He should have fought for it, fought against the fear sooner. Cas died for him, and he should have known that he was loved back.
“All of them,” Dean starts gesturing wildly, “Cas, Eileen, Bobby, Mom, Charlie, all of them! We’re bringing them back.”
He doesn’t know how he ended up here.
“You didn’t have to say it. It’s okay," he says, "You didn’t have to lie for me.”
Dean slowly opens one eye, squinting at the bright sunlight around them. Warmth begins to spread along his spine. He inhales and smells wildflowers.
It’s what landed him in the kitchen in the first place. He and Cas. . .
At first Castiel didn’t mind the texture of Dean’s voice in his ears; it was a nice distraction from the rubber tires pressing and crunching against the gravel of the road, and the static of Dean’s music. Cas couldn’t keep his eyes off his hands, convinced it was his nails breaking.
The words echo in Dean’s head, and he opens his eyes. He could hardly believe it when Cas told him, and even now he still struggles to get his mind wrapped around the idea. But he thinks back to their final confrontation with Chuck, how even as Chuck taunted him with titles of violence and hatred, all Dean could think was,
Cas gives his head one shake to the left before saying, “I’m so sorry, Dean.”
Dean settles into Charlie’s chair, which she kindly set back further from the fire. Dean brings Jack down from off his shoulders, and Jack settles into his lap, snuggling against his chest.
Dean knows Cas loved the meadow, and he loves it nearly as much. It’s peaceful, not silent – he likes that. He also likes that everywhere he looks, he can see evidence of life. The colourful petals of meadow flowers, the whistling of the birds above. An oriole lands on a branch to his right. The oriole sings its delicate, sweet song. He feels the corners of his mouth twitch. He’s sure the orioles have a nest hidden somewhere in the trees surrounding the meadow. Their bright orange bellies a stark contrast against the greens and browns of the brush around them.
Dean’s head was rattling with insults, there was a territorial need to protect what was his, to chase away the threat of another Alpha imprinting their scent onto his belongings. Trying hard not to lash out, the Alpha took a deep breath, turning to face Castiel and eyeing the revolting collar wrapped around his neck, always reminding Dean that the Omega was taken.
And the Alpha’s pectorals were powerfully curved, plump, and proud. A quality trait that Alphas killed to have because such potency was highly desired amongst Omegas. Clearly, the Alpha was god’s only exception at being considered
“The name’s Lucifer. And you must be Castiel.”
The Alpha was basically a man child, walking around with his hot dog pajama bottoms and contrary to his childlike choices in sleepwear, Dean was a complete womanizer with his fucking tits hanging out. The Alpha nonchalantly tied the sash around his waist, covering his muscled pecs and thanking his past self for buying a robe that was long enough to cover the majority of his pajama bottoms.
“Kid, if you know what’s good for you, leave right now.”
Fuck it.
Yeah, that’d be hella awkward.
There was only five more minutes left of walking before reaching Castiel’s home and Jack was beaming the whole way there, listing off every shop they were going to visit tomorrow. Jack was even nice enough to walk the Omega to his front door and help Castiel take every bag inside the house.
hurts
, these tables were everywhere.
The scent was becoming deliciously claustrophobic, the bare layers of nature was surrounding Castiel like a warm blanket and
Castiel looked into the Alpha’s eyes, tilting his head in confusion. “There are many Omegas that are worth scenting, unclaimed even. Wouldn’t the scent of an unclaimed Omega be more of your taste?”
Castiel shivered in his seat, drops of slick moistening his briefs. “Why are you interested in me?”
“Clearly, you were born for this.”
Jack squealed happily, already closing the register and heading towards the back to clock out. “
he couldn’t actually comprehend why the Alpha — who was a total ass wipe by the way — treated the Omega so poorly and derogatory. To have the power and juice to bestow such cruelty onto the shining starlight that was the Omega, was considered a war crime in the Alpha’s book.
This took a while to do, the Alpha — without really intending to fall into a trance — began to let his thoughts wander off to the Omega next door again. Like a traumatized soldier suffering at the hands of PTSD; Dean began to remember the images of the Omega being savagely beaten, the way the Omega bled with every punch, the way he was explicitly raped, and how the Omega was purposely tied down to never have a fighting chance against Lucifer.
, the asshole had to wake up early, only suckers got up at the ass crack of dawn.
Castiel wanted to say.
The Alpha next door could accuse Dean of trying to hurt the Omega and all his bloody handiwork would become Dean’s exile. The Alpha would win and instead of helping the Omega, Dean would be condemning the Omega to an everlasting life of violent beatings with zero chances of escape. Dean could also be charged with taking the Omega by force, already bestowing him with a nice front row seat in a filthy prison.
Sam put himself before Dean, holding out his hands to show the Alpha that he wasn’t going to hurt him but skillfully blocking the path to the house next door. “Dean. Stop. This isn’t our problem.”
Dean entered the main part of the shop where cars were everywhere, the Alpha was scenting the air, trying to locate Bobby and Rufus when Bobby appeared.
One hand was massaging the Alpha’s pec while the other hand was slowly traveling down Dean’s abdomens, the ripple of a six pack was pressing against the palm of Castiel’s hand. Stuttering breaths were escaping the Alpha’s mouth and with a wicked smile, the Omega continued his exploration. The Omega’s fingers fluttered over the waistband of Dean’s jeans, teasingly pulling the Alpha closer when Castiel cupped the Alpha’s erect cock.
, Castiel had a damn cute nose. Their lips were dangerously hovering over one another, a sliver of space between them. Audible breaths were coming out hot and fervent, melting into their pores. Dean helplessly stared at Castiel’s beauty, admiring him as if the Omega were a sacred relic worth protecting.
Dean mustered the happiest smile he could deliver before offering Castiel a fork. “Wanna eat some pie with me?”
A darkness ghosted over Castiel’s eyes, adrenaline filled with terror spread across Dean’s body, making him shiver.
John presented a folder, opening it and rustling through the papers. “I’ve talked with Mr Novak and we both agreed that incorporating a new job position in this company is more than welcome. If we need elevator workers to maintain the reputation of this company, then we will be more than welcome to increase the addition of new jobs.”
“Who?”
The Alpha rung the doorbell first, he was the Alpha here, the conversation will definitely be started by him.
Gabriel instantly became protective, eyeing his little brother’s bruising cheek and baring his teeth like an animal waiting to pounce on his enemy. “Are you okay?”
Gabriel looked back at his father, wiggling his eyebrows and bouncing around like a fool. “You. Upstairs. Now. And Dean, man, you’re gorgeous and I’d love for you to pound the shit out of me, but you’re not really my type.”
Dean learned to hide the self hatred that poisoned him every morning when he came face to face with himself in the mirror by sleeping with countless Omegas who were willing to let themselves go, and let the Alpha use them for his own pleasure. And Dean certainly buried behind the ruthless nature of wanting to break everything with his hands by working at a repair shop, putting the use of his hands that were definitely capable of destruction and using them to restore important pieces that were easily replaceable.
The house was easily considered a three-part mansion, three different wings filled with multiple rooms decorated in nothing but the finest treasures that money can buy. The house was shimmering in its snowy white glory with a nicely shingled roof colored in dark blue, and two grand staircases leading up to the main entrance.
It was barely 6 am. Time really was sucking ass.
The word alone made Castiel tremble with unadulterated hunger; his body was pulsing with a need to be
Little Sammy shrugged adorably, looking up at his older brother. “I mean, our mom is hot. We can’t ignore that.”
milk. Can I have a taste?”
The Omega’s breaths were coming in quick pants, Dean growled uncontrollably as he cupped Castiel’s cheek. The Alpha nearly lost his head when the Omega guided his other hand underneath his sweater, Dean immediately fastened his fingers onto Castiel’s fleshy hip. The Omega mewled, the sound was virginal and shy, but Castiel bared his neck to the Alpha and oh boy.
Everything seemed perfect, except Castiel would never know that just outside the hospital, John was exiting the Impala and crossing the street. The failure of checking both ways where cars were zooming by, resulted in John getting run over by a cargo truck, killing him instantly and leaving Castiel as a widow and his two boys, fatherless.
The Omega squeaked loudly, gripping onto the bedsheets as Dean swiftly penetrated him, stretching Castiel’s rim to the point where it hurt and ripping through the Omega’s tight walls. Castiel writhed against him, biting through his lower lip and feeling the Alpha’s cock pushing further into him. Dean was monstrously huge; it was a miracle that he fit into the Omega.
Jack playfully leaned against Castiel, their arms brushing against one another. “
good time.”
With a frightened look, Castiel faced his father. “Rent boy?”
The Alpha picked himself up from the floor, faltering in his steps as he approached the bedroom door. Dean, already feeling his vision going blurry, reached for the doorknob and slammed it shut, fingers shaking as he turned the lock. Dean rested his forehead against the cool door, sighing in relief, for his body kept getting hotter and hotter.
Instead of a quick fuck, Dean wanted to make love, he wanted to feel every part of the Omega moving against him. The sweet sounds escaping the Omega’s lips, Dean wanted to hear that against his mouth. The Alpha wanted to consume the Omega’s screams, Dean wanted to taste the Omega’s pain while he fucked into the Omega with no mercy, deflowering the Omega and watching with obscene pride as the Alpha’s cock shimmered with virgin blood.
Yeah, the whole ‘
Lucifer nodded. “Got it.”
To control his predatory impulse of going over to the Omega’s house and claiming him, Dean clawed at his window, baring his teeth while a deadly snarl escaped his lips. And
Dean rested his forehead against the back of Castiel’s neck, taking deep breaths and feeling the Omega shutter beneath him. Slowly, very slowly, the Alpha resumed to his thrusts. Castiel let out a broken cry, feeling the fat head of Dean’s cock grinding painfully against his prostate.
The Omega continued to cry, like a child cleaning away their youthful tears, Castiel shyly rubbed at his sad blue eyes. What made the Omega even more sad was the fact that he couldn’t stop hiccuping. Ever since Castiel entered the supermarket, he’s been hiccuping nonstop and drawing unnecessary attention to himself, which is why he went to the vegetable section, seeking solidarity.
Dean’s breath was hot against Castiel’s skin, forcing the Omega’s cheeks to blossom in a bright red color, making Castiel shiver with every burning puff of air melting into his pores. The Alpha could easily count the vibrations pulsing beneath the Omega’s scent gland, it was an invitation, a tempting invitation. Dean felt the mere instant when his gums began to seethe in scorching flames, his canines were working on their own accord, and pushing past the raw flesh of tender meat.
Dean tightly screwed his eyes shut, faintly aware that the euphoric high of his orgasm was fading away. Usually during ruts, there were short periods of time where an Alpha’s clarity lingered for a bit, allowing the absence of being fully inebriated with the need to
The Omega smirked, a mischievous gleam flitting past his sapphire eyes. “I think I have an answer to your question, Mr Dean Winchester. I think I’ll make you boys work for it. Enjoy the rest of your day.”
Castiel was breathing out choppy breaths, the Omega was silently thanking Sam for the opportunity to breathe without the Winchesters enclosing themselves around him and letting the Omega suffocate to death.
Dean continued to search the bar, ignoring Bobby’s words of concern. There was something about this scent that was causing the head of Dean’s cock to fatten. Never like
But after seeing the blue-eyed Omega for the very first time, Dean didn’t want to be looped back into the same routine that made up his life. The Alpha wanted to become someone better, he didn’t want the Omega next door to see him as a potential fuck for the night and then bid him farewell in the morning.
The Alpha felt another twinge of pain, howling at the top of his lungs as he fell forward, resting his elbows on the floor and fighting against the hellfire that was burning him to a crisp.
Castiel wanted
“So long how the marines give you before ya gotta go back?” Rufus asked.
Daughters baring the Winchester name were pressured to become downy housewives with their virginity in tact until they were mated off to a filthy rich Alpha. Although female Omegas have earned the option of going to school, earning a degree, and getting a job. The chances of becoming someone important and being seen as a role model for other Omegas who wanted more in life, always ended up in an unfair deal.
Dean was clenching his jaw, the Alpha knew that Castiel would lie about what happened to him but a small part of him wished that the Omega came clean but then again, they hardly knew each other. “Is that what really happened?”
It was making it impossible for Dean to track down the Omega that was responsible for that scent.
Gabriel smiled cockily, taking the compliment and walking away with the grace of a king. “That’s because uncle Gabriel is the baddest baddie to exist. Now, I’m going to work in my office and you boys better fucking take care of your mom or I swear to God I’m beating both of your asses! And I swear to fucking God Cassie bear, if you don’t speak up the next time this happens, I will slap the hell outta you.”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “There won’t be a next time.”
’ shape while Dean took the opportunity to consume the Omega’s wet mouth. With trembling lips, Castiel kissed the Alpha in return when Dean thrusted his hips in a certain way and made the Omega scream.
hot, it was like the Alpha’s room was blasting the heater nonstop, warming every inch of his bedroom and Dean
Sam turned to face Castiel, his look was soft and heartwarming. “Mr Novak, please forgive us. This was uncalled for and I assure you this won’t happen again, at least, not without your consent.”
The Omega gave an apologetic smile. “Sorry hun but I’m not on the market.”
Sam and Dean growled ravenously when Castiel’s mouth watering scent crawled past their nostrils.
Castiel was emitting pheromones of anger and distress, the Omega’s scent was powerful enough to erase Lucifer’s harsh aroma, for the moment, anyway. “Cas, I’m so —“
Dean smiled excitedly as he went around Lucifer, keeping Castiel close to him when he came face to face with his younger brother. “Don’t wait up for me, Sammy.”
, if he had the chance, he’d leave various hickeys, love bites, and gorgeous bruises all over the Omega’s collarbones. The amount of ashen skin that was lacking in Dean’s love bites were making the Alpha very angry, he wanted to be the only one who had the right to claim the Omega properly.
And then the Alpha’s hair,
Dean was ignoring Charlie’s concerned questions when Dean felt his younger brother grabbing his ankles.
Sam came closer to Dean, the little Alpha checking his surroundings before murmuring in a low voice. “Have you noticed how
Castiel remained silent, terrified of facing the Alpha, trying and failing horribly to meet those tempting green eyes.
Burnt wood, black musk, and the grounding pungency of burning incense.
Dean didn’t even get to take a step forward when Sam was pulling him back, wrapping his arms around Dean’s chest and holding him still. “I already told you, Dean. I’m not letting you go down there and start a fight with someone who might be important to Cas.”
The Omega was too good for him, too perfect for humanity and Dean was a 100% sure that he didn’t deserve Castiel.
Where the hell was his shitty dead father when Dean needed someone to beat the shit out of him?
“Sam, son. You must understand that Alphas cannot do this job. We are more important than Omegas and we will not lose our honor to be seen as an elevator boy. Which is why, Mr Novak and I agreed that we must have a trial run, to see if having elevator workers are our style. If it suits us, we’ll begin the process of hiring Omegas within the following week.”
The primal image of the Winchester brothers claiming Castiel’s body with primitive yet unrestrained devotions of eagerness could be manifested into a scattering array of passionate bruises that glimmered of a purple hue, the uncontrolled instinct of baring Alpha canines and sinking such a deadly weapon into the Omega’s neck, would leave behind unhealed love bites that would be susceptible to the Winchesters’ egotistical need to bite through Castiel’s skin every day, and of course, the evidence purposely left behind on the Omega’s skin would bleed into the branding scars of a rough yet tender handprint that would shine in dark shades of red along Castiel’s rounded hips.
Thankfully, Lucifer was still inside but Castiel was pulling at his collar, wishing nothing more than to take off the collar that was grossly sticking to his skin like glue. To distract himself from the feeling of the collar sticking to his skin due to the sun hitting him, the Omega went back to looking at the families resting on their lawns while their pups ran a muck.
That’s how this felt like, all the hype inside him would just drop to a level of disappointment.
Castiel felt his pupils dilating at the sight of Dean’s black eyes swallowing his green iris’, fear was rolling off the Omega in heavy waves. Castiel wanted the Alpha to ruin him completely. The Omega timidly reached forward, placing both hands against the Alpha’s broad chest. Castiel seductively palmed at Dean’s pecs, loving the hardness of chiseled muscles underneath his touch.
“Okay, Cas. Let me tend to your wounds.
The Omega didn’t respond, Castiel simply eyed him for a while, trying to look for the spark of malice that might be behind Dean’s reasoning, but the Omega sighed tiredly, looking down at his flowers and convincing himself that there was nothing off about the Alpha’s request. “Its odd, no one really asks me if I’m okay.”
Gabriel gave a high-pitched squeal. “Holy shit! That’s so true. Dad, Dean is so Castiel’s type.”
The Alpha’s mouth dropped open,
The kiss was sloppy and perfect, the Alpha smirked against their kiss as he felt the Omega trying to keep up with his pace. Dean was tasting every corner of Castiel’s mouth, licking his way inside and easily stating his dominance over the Omega’s mouth. The Alpha rumbled in pleasure as Castiel remained compliant and submissive, taking every kiss with a muffled whimper.
Sam snarled violently, pulling Dean back by the shoulder and making his Alpha brother stumble. “
Castiel decided to leave the car door open, doing the car a favor in letting in fresh waves of wind to clean away the stinking pheromones belonging to Lucifer. The Omega leaned against the car, resting his forearms on top of the vehicle and dreamily looking up into the sun. The warmth from the bright star enchantingly glazed over Castiel’s snow colored skin.
Old people were so cute.
A curious question was burning through Dean’s tongue. “Hey pops, has Cas ever…”
That alone, made them even closer throughout the years. Sam smiled brightly at his friend, the Omega demon stood on his feet and gave the taller Alpha a major bear hug. Garth and Sam ordered a couple of drinks and began to chat about their lives, what’s been happening with them lately, and if any new gossip was worth the spill.
Dean should have worn his dark blue jeans that accentuated his sweet ass and thick thighs along with a long-sleeved black shirt that hugged his shoulders and biceps quite nicely, the fabric molding over his muscles and making the blue-eyed Omega blush like the gorgeous rose he was at the attractive qualities that a true potent Alpha like himself possessed.
It was raw, toxic, and perfect.
, his lips. So plump, tender, full, and colored in a pale pink that caused Dean’s cock to become erect, his girth was thickening at the idea of biting through those lips, gnawing them, tasting them and watching the way those pink lips would become red and rosy.
Dean couldn’t resist himself anymore, the voice was becoming louder,
Mated Omegas, on the other hand, were a different story. Mated Omegas did not possess the ability to manifest their scent at a global scale mostly because once an Omega was fully claimed, their scent was reduced to a lesser frequency. Meaning, claimed Alphas were in full control of conserving their mate’s scent to a solitary and private audience.
“And single!” Bobby said with a wink.
Being on the road was tiring, changing locations every two months involved the same process; meeting new people but not establishing permanent friendships, becoming familiar with the new location, and presenting oneself as a ‘normal’ person without any links to justifying that being stuck in an abusive relationship was equivalent to never escaping the grips of hell.
Lucifer seemed surprised before a mischievous wave of hunger clouded his eyes. “
The Omega chuckled sweetly and got off the bed, the Alpha took one step back while Castiel took a step forward. Dean remained in place, allowing the Omega to get as close and possible. Castiel looked up at the Alpha, giving a coy smile before reaching forward and taking Dean’s hands into his.
Castiel’s chapped and full lips were forming an angelic smile,
Sam and Dean were staring at her, confusion lacing into their voices as they both asked. “
The Alpha was caught off guard. “What?”
Where to begin, there was a fluffy sensation tickling Dean’s fingertips. The silky aroma of vanilla bath bubbles made Dean feel like the atmosphere around him was wooly and ethereal. The softness of such a fragrance made the Alpha’s chest tighten with protective instincts, the need to protect the Omega from any potential threat was becoming more of a mandatory responsibility.
There was an awkward tension in the air, a silence that became uncomfortable but Sam’s bitch face directed to Dean was difficult to ignore, so Sam took the liberty of responding to Chuck’s answer. “We’re sorry for your loss.”
What the fuck?
liked Dean Winchester, he
Well shit.
, the Omega was pulling down the zipper to his jeans and slipping off his pants. Black briefs were hugging the Omega’s plush hips and wasn’t that was hottest sight the Alpha has ever seen.
, the Omega wanted to taste the Alpha’s mouth. Castiel could imagine how feral the Alpha would become, hungrily chasing after his kisses and making the Omega whimper with primitive need. Their kisses would become heated with passion, the Alpha would state his dominance over Castiel’s mouth, and the Alpha would claim his lips in feverish bites.
Dean got up from the bed, heading towards the fridge and popping open a beer. “That’s nice, Rowena but we’ve been working our asses off this entire month. We just want to relax, maybe take the week off.”
Castiel was in the hospital, screaming and crying as he was giving birth to his second child. After that night in the Impala with John Winchester, it was evident that the Alpha wanted to be with the Omega for all eternity. So, as a result, John and Castiel got married early in the morning before the Alpha had to leave.
What’s my birthday present?! Am I finally getting
and it was slightly making Castiel scared of the Alpha. “I’ll take the job.”
But how can you become friends with someone like Dean, a horrible person who was bold enough to insult the Omega for his own pleasure. It became clear to Castiel that Dean saw him like any other Omega who has been stereotyped by society, a filthy race that consisted of cock hungry sluts who were only good enough to be bred and fucked by Alphas who loved playing with Omegas.
“How about we stay here?”
Sam gave Dean another epic bitch face while walking back to Dean’s side, “Mr Novak —“
Rufus couldn’t help the wide grin spreading across his face. “The beautiful angel of Thursday is asking for your name.”
With a soft gasp escaping Dean’s lips, Castiel came even closer, tracing his thumb over Dean’s voluptuous lips, gripping Dean’s chin with a deadly force and growling out. “What else don’t you mind begging for?”
Castiel leaned against the marble counter, resting his elbows on the smooth surface while cutting a piece of pie with his fork. The Omega bashfully ate a piece of banana cream pie, aware that the Alpha was staring at him like he was the pie himself.
Are you playing private detective? Is this some sort of intervention where I tell you my life story? What is this?”
Dean went towards the window by the kitchen sink, breathing in the fresh air from outside and counting to five, then pulling open a drawer and grabbing two forks. “Thank, Cas. Everything here was built by me, can’t say I’m not proud of my own work.”
“As opposed to what?”
. Just by looking into them, Castiel could feel himself being sucked into an oblivion that left him breathless and scared, in an excited way. Dean’s eyes were addictive, the spherical emeralds that were the Alpha’s irises were making the Omega believe that his existence meant nothing if Dean didn’t look into his eyes everyday.
Dean couldn’t stand himself anymore, it was making him sick. The Alpha couldn’t hold back much longer, Dean needed to let out his anger one more time and so, the Alpha shouted again. This time, the sound was sad, tormented, and brokenly injured. But yelling wasn’t enough, not nearly enough, so Dean began to punch the wooden fence surrounding his home.
The Omega tilted his head to the side, softly smiling at Sam and it was probably the cutest thing the Winchester brothers have ever seen. Aside from the fact that Castiel was currently looking like a sexy disaster; his shirt was wrinkled to no end, untucked in many places that made the Omega look like he’d just been fucked nastily, a rosy red color taking over Castiel’s cheeks and the Omega’s intensely dark hair was ruffled and sticking up in different directions.
Dean wanted a taste.
The Alpha died, like actually died when Castiel responded to his arousal, feeling his eyes rolling into the back of his head. “Don’t stop, Cas.
But like a raging storm brewing over the ocean, the Alpha’s eyes became darker, a bone chilling shiver ran down the Omega’s spine as he admired the ashen grey color taking over Sam’s eyes, there were silver specks twinkling at the corner of his eyes, strongly pulsing as the light illuminated them. Instead of green grass and shiny droplets of transparent dew, Castiel felt himself standing in the middle of a grey storm, water hitting his skin, the momentary fear of succumbing to the storm’s provocative pull, and to make things even easier, the Omega let himself be pulled into darkness.
Of course, it was the owner’s idea to have Castiel wear this apron for the Alpha boss wasn’t stupid, he knew that the younger Omega was basically eye candy for any Alpha who was brave enough to step into the diner and not act like a complete dumbass in front of Castiel or simply drop dead at the Omega’s feet.
“It was nice meeting you as well, Jack. Thank you for helping me home.”
Sam broke the symphony of predatory snarls with a bitter question. “Who do you think he is?”
, the Alpha was acting like a teenage boy who just got kissed for the very first time.
Things were going so well when the Alpha’s instincts decided to come out of hiding, as the Omega slipped past Dean, there was a light brush against their arms when the Alpha detected the vile scent belonging to Lucifer. Instantly, Dean tightened his grip on the doorknob, if he added another amount of pressure against the handle, the Alpha would have easily broken off the doorknob.
“Dude, we need to stop this.”
Already, the Omega’s scent was decorated with unclaimed virtue, a sight so beautiful that both Alphas
Dean hated himself.
The Alpha recklessly searched everywhere; running down the entire block, turning every corner and failing to see Castiel anywhere. Dean’s heart was pounding against his chest, the Alpha was having trouble breathing, suddenly everything became too much and because there was no other way to express how he felt, Dean yelled at the top of his lungs.
Castiel felt the hot suction of the Alpha’s mouth against his scent gland, practically melting against Dean’s body when the Alpha began to lave at his skin like it was thawing ice cream. Castiel was quivering shamelessly, feeling an immense bulge growing against his stomach. The Omega nervously began to rub his body against Dean’s erection, it was soft and inexperienced.
Castiel looked back at Dean. “And who were you meant to belong too?”
. God, you whine like a bitch.”
Dean desperately hoped that the Omega was a
The Omega smiled softly at Sam and the rogue demon could help but be enraptured by Castiel’s ethereal beauty. The Omega was gorgeous and so
“Cas, please we can —“
The curves morphing through the Alpha’s beefy shoulders produced profound dips of burly muscles that Castiel was dying to feel, his small hands wouldn’t compare to the ripples of muscular strength embedded through the Alpha’s lower back. The slope leading down the Alpha’s back was leaving the Omega’s throat dry.
It was settled then, Castiel grabbed a cart and began to fill it with an excessive amount of food, after all, Lucifer did have a big appetite. After grabbing everything that he needed, the Omega began to make his way to the register. From what Castiel could see, there were three registers open and the first two were packed with large families who were taking more food than the Omega could barely fit in his cart.
And for an unknown reason, the Alpha knew that the rejection would hurt him
After waiting for twenty minutes, with a dorky smile on his face, Castiel gave everyone their food. “Enjoy your food, boys.”
Castiel rolled his eyes, leaving Gabriel’s office and definitely not hearing the raw words of lust and hunger directed towards the pastry left in the Alpha’s care. The diner wasn’t even open for five minutes when the Omega spotted nine tables in use. Of course, all the people inhabiting the diner were regular customers.
Pride was rolling off of Castiel’s shoulders, he always did like it when Dean praised him. The nurses who were still in their room, gave Castiel disturbed looks before excusing themselves. The Omega didn’t care. Dean released his mother’s nipple with a wet
it still hurt to think about what Dean said to him, that Castiel should let Lucifer rape him because according to Dean, the Omega
At the moment, the Omega’s back was towards the Alpha; god, Dean would give anything to press his large chest against the Omega’s lithe back, feeling the way the Omega would melt against his hot skin. The soft sounds the Omega would make for Dean, sounds that only belonged to the Alpha’s ears would cause Dean’s breath to hitch.
Yeah, not creepy or psychopathic at all.
John nodded. “That’s fair enough.”
Omega to represent her loveliness. Even then, Greek goddesses couldn’t compare to this Omega. Sorry Busty Asian Beauties, but even their full and round breasts — along with their cute pussies — couldn’t beat the Omega’s pure and saint-like beauty.
Dean slammed the palm of his hand against the counter, the fork clanking its way towards the ground. “You wanna know what my problem is, Cas? My problem is that I can’t stand you, first you come into my house gifting me sweets and now you’re lecturing me about what love is. Are you that desperate for my cock?”
but to be even bolder, the Alpha’s vigor could only be created by the devil himself.
Castiel nodded, satisfying Lucifer when the Alpha purposely shoved the Omega back, knocking the side of Castiel’s head against the glass window again. That was truly inevitable. Lucifer started the car again, driving at least half a mile before they reached Lawrence, Kansas, their new home.
Rufus threw the dirty rag towards Dean’s face, pushing past Dean and going for the Omega’s hand to plant a sweet kiss against Castiel’s knuckles. “Is it just me or am I in the presence of a goddess?”
The Alpha’s bedroom was completely dark except for the stream of light coming from his window. Dean sighed and went towards the window, closing the curtains when he caught a glimpse of the Omega next door.
, he would ruin everything, as he always did. “Your mate. I drove around town this morning to see if he was anywhere near and I didn’t see him. I’m guessing he works in the city, so if you were worried about him seeing us together, there’s no need to worry.”
Those who were subdued to the changes made by rogue demons had two choices: either they accept rogue demons for who they were and peacefully coexist with them or go against them and find themselves being murdered in their homes. The choice was obvious, as a result, death rates spiked in a month and the disappearances of large families kept increasing by the day.
Dean was blissed out. Ever so carefully, the Alpha slowly unclenched his canines from the Omega’s scent gland, feeling the
The Alpha smirked momentarily,
ended with Dean rolling his eyes and kicking the Omega out of his room.
It was evident now that after a full minute, no one was going to answer the door and Dean just won the award of being the biggest shithead on the block.
It was easy to speculate which brother was favored among rogue demons. Dean was the most favored. Sam, on the other hand, was respected by everyone due to the Winchester name. Sam’s progressive state of mind along with his opinions concerning Omega rights and free will, wasn’t by far, a popular factor of his.
Sam snorted, pushing Dean and laughing when the Alpha was easily knocked to the side. “Stop drooling man. I said, that Omega is
Castiel has never felt himself being out of control like this, especially with another person that he desperately wanted to take upstairs and fuck their brains out.
Jack was about to turn the corner when Dean called out to him, “Hey kid!”
Dean was huge, thick, large, and heavy.
to be raped. That Castiel should take every beating without complaints because that’s what Omegas were built for. Those hurtful words made the Omega cry even more, Castiel never asked to be with Lucifer and he certainly didn’t
and it was driving Dean absolutely mad. The Alpha continued gnawing at Castiel’s scent gland, watching in fascination as streams of blood glided over Castiel’s rosy red nipples, instantly making them fat and hard.
assume the worst of me. You’re gonna lecture me about my life, that’s pretty funny. From where I’m standing, you don’t know jack shit about my life.”
It was awesome.
“You heard me, Cas. Don’t play the innocent little cunt with me, it doesn’t work. Sure, you’re pretty; you have the whole big blue eyes and pale complexion that makes you mysterious and exciting but really Cas, you’re nothing more than a toy waiting to be played with. Look at you, a piss poor excuse of an Omega telling me, what love is about, the hell do you know about love, Cas?”
. Dean simply answered
In a matter of seconds, the Alpha kissed his way across the Omega’s chest to give the same treatment to the other pink nub. Castiel moaned loudly, biting his lower lip and sinfully grinding himself harder against John’s monstrous cock thickening beneath him. The Omega benevolently pulled the Alpha away from sucking on his nipple, caressing John’s face and shamefully swiping his tongue over the Alpha’s mouth.
The humming of furry bees landing on purple lilacs was the sweetest sound vibrating through Dean’s chest; the dense velvety petals that encompassed a raging red rose was soft against the Alpha’s mouth, Dean could almost taste the fragrance of recently bloomed roses that were desperately searching the touch of their true mate.
Garth sat up straight, his eyes wide open as he grabbed the phone and put Gabriel on speaker phone. “You have a job for Cas?! Are you serous?!”
Dean didn’t understand what was happening to him, the Alpha was never one to
Castiel was smiling brightly, the sound of his own laughter was foreign to him because it has been years since he’s genuinely laughed for anything. The Omega shook his head at the children who seemed to be on the brink of hitting puberty soon, foolishly adjusting his beige trench coat as a poor excuse to cool down his red-hot cheeks.
Dean snorted, ready to respond with a dirty comment when Gabriel began to scream at the top of his lungs. “Thank you, dad, for my gift!
Chuck mumbled underneath his breath. “Here we go again. I’m sorry, Dean.”
Dean’s teeth were digging into the meat of his cheeks, his hands were balling into fists. “A very good question indeed.”
Dean cleared his throat, standing next to Sam. “Where does that leave me, handsome?”
Chuck studied Dean and Sam for another minute before speaking. “Okay boys, I understand if our request was lacking in instructions so, let me break it down for you before my son appears. Today is my son’s birthday, his name is Gabriel and he’s the most playful one in our family and he’s been begging me to find someone who can… please him.”
Dean inhaled deeply and
Without even expecting it, they both growled out at the same time. “
Castiel felt as if he were in locked room set on fire, the Omega could already feel the black smoke filtering itself into his lungs and making it impossible to breathe without coughing. The aroma was intense, deadly, yet Castiel craved more of it. When another scent hit his nose, this time, the Omega was breathing in the pure grains of gunpowder.
Springtime, flowers, bees fluttering about, and honeycombs.
Yet every rent boy in Lawrence, Kansas knew of the Novak family; all these slutty boys wanted a taste of luxurious paradise along with a fat paycheck for their offered services.
Bobby appeared next to Dean, tapping the Alpha on the shoulder and skeptically eyeing Dean up and down. “Why the hell are you so happy?”
There was no movement.
Castiel was well out of sight by the time the Alpha reached the end of the sidewalk, chaotically shouting the Omega’s name until his voice became hoarse and scratchy. “
Castiel sleepily looked up at the Alpha, craning his neck to see Dean’s face. “
The house had character. The Omega smiled at the well-kept house and turned his vision away from it, looking at nothing really except falling into the rabbit hole that greedily summoned him to become lost in the abyss. A place where Lucifer’s judgements, insults, cruelty, and manipulation haunted Castiel’s being.
Dean smirked. “You’re a sheep amongst wolves. But don’t worry, gorgeous. I don’t bite. Unless you want me too.”
Failing to sedate an Alpha’s sexual urge had consequences, Dean was barely keeping himself together before the temptation of fucking someone became feral. Tonight, the Alpha wanted raw sex, and because Dean was the perfect definition of a potent Alpha, Dean would choose an Omega to his liking and take them back to his home with or without their consent.
Dean turned to face Castiel’s home, the Alpha was readying himself to go and knock on the door. Was this a wise choice? Probably not. Dean wouldn’t be surprised if the Omega told him to go fuck himself while slamming the door in his face. But the pain weighing on his chest was too much to bear, the Alpha just needed one chance, one opportunity to show that he wasn’t a total douchebag.
The Omega forced himself to not cry, not now. Castiel looked up at the house next door when the most gorgeous and handsomest Alpha stepped across the threshold. Time froze, the orbital spin of the earth came to a halt, every knowledge inside the Omega’s head was erased, and the unfamiliar feeling of
Garth, an Omega cook, hastily answered. “Not yet, sugar!”
Even his Alpha side was protesting against the consequences of his own actions, will and power were embedded into the genes that made him an Alpha. It was known that Alphas had the power to choose any Omega they desired, even without the Omega’s consent.
“I am aware that your boss, Crowley, has been interested in getting our family’s attention but as a man of business, I am not interested in sleeping with prostitutes, no offense, but apparently my son favors it. For that reason, I requested both of you and just by looking at you boys, I know Gabriel will favor you Sam.”
What the hell was he supposed to do now? It was still so early and the Alpha could already predict that this night was going to be pure hell. The sound of the clock ticking away was driving Dean to insanity.
“I can’t. I can’t do it.”
The Alpha was cold and malicious, a glint of repulsion burned through his green eyes. “As if a broken Omega like yourself could ever comprehend what love is.”
, it’s what the Alpha deserved for letting the Omega next door suffer so horribly at the hands of a rapist. An abusing Alpha that enjoyed beating and using Omegas as if they were lifeless dolls. Dean could still feel the Omega’s pain building at the base of his stomach, the Alpha could
As usual, the diner started to become busy; orders were being taken down while plates of food were being placed in front of hungry customers. After serving eight tables, the Omega reached the last booth and smiled giddily when he recognized the three dapper men — Alphas — sitting together and working on their crossword puzzles.
the Alpha couldn’t stand how sexy and intimate this was, the display of affection coming from Castiel was making Dean territorial, protective, possessive, and uncontrollably aroused.
Castiel threw his head back against the wall, the grip on his face failing to loosen while the scent of his slick moistened through his briefs, traveling up to Sam’s nose. Sam leaned in closer, inhaling Castiel’s virginal slick and growling against the Omega’s cheek. The Alpha loosened his grip on Castiel’s face, just a bit, and dragged his tongue across the Omega’s cheek, purposely licking the corner of Castiel’s mouth.
Already, it’s been two times that Dean has failed to dress attractively to catch Castiel’s eye, not that he was dressing up badly on purpose, but mostly because he never knew what to wear since the Omega unexpectedly showed up as his next-door neighbor. The Alpha was heavily considering an apology, begging Castiel to forgive him for being a dumbass who never figured out the perfect outfit that could sweep the Omega off his feet.
Dean didn’t do anything. And the Alpha’s faulty trait of building the endless fury pumping through his veins was becoming more difficult to ignore. And Dean hated himself more than anything because it was such a natural sensation that kicked into his body, he couldn’t control it, the only method he knew of taking out his anger was hurting others or himself.
After two strokes, the Omega came with a shattering scream on his lips. Castiel tightened his grip on Dean, digging his nails into the Alpha’s skin and trembling uncontrollably when spurts of cum landed against his chest and on the bedsheets.
Lucifer observed Castiel, taking in the Omega’s curvy hips and long lean legs. “Say sweetheart, are you married or in a relationship with someone?”
Only one way to find out.
Dean snarled, pushing past Bobby and heading towards the back when another familiar voice appeared.
worried for the Omega next door. The Omega has been in his thoughts for more than five hours; some thoughts were dark, others were sweet. Flashes of the Alpha hurting the Omega was causing Dean to lose his temper, pushing Dean to punch through the walls of his home and creating various holes with a trail of powdered dust.
Castiel looked down at the little bundle of joy who still hadn’t opened his eyes and sweetly whispered, “Hello sweetheart.”
Sam looked into his father’s eyes, deep breaths were making the Alpha’s chest rise up and down, Sam wanted to fight his father on this topic but as usual, the Alpha resigned his position and took a seat in his chair.
But before Dean could even step off the sidewalk, a car was entering the driveway.
Mr Winchesters.”
Castiel bit his lower lip, slithering closer to Dean as if he were snake ready to hypnotize his victim. “Are you proposing something to me, Dean?”
The Omega gave a sad smile, turning to leave when Castiel stopped at the doorway, not moving an inch. The Alpha was about to ask if the Omega was okay, when Castiel turned to face Dean again. With determination in the Omega’s eyes, Castiel walked towards the Alpha with a solemn purpose.
loudly who was calling him. “Hello?”
The Omega closed his eyes, the Alpha’s tongue was burning through his skin and
Chuck’s eyes seemed to go dark, a curious expression on his face. “Please don’t apologize, I like men who are straightforward but my forte lies in men who are well mannered, like you Sam. If I were a younger man, I would have kept you to myself but that’s not the case.”
slipping past Castiel’s lips made the Alpha feel bitter and hostile.
Sam arrived next to Castiel, placing himself before the Omega and protecting his beloved mother.
Sam, although young in age but more mature than Dean, blushed at the idea of fucking their mother. “Definitely.”
That dark, cold, and asphyxiating place was the constant reminder of how much the Omega would give anything to leave the Alpha. The way Lucifer treated him was horrible but as pathetic as this may sound, even to Castiel’s ears, he couldn’t leave the Alpha. Since the age of 13, the Omega has known nothing of the world except Lucifer.
The Alpha pulled his hands away from his face, leaning back and feeling the tension in his body fading away, for now, as he fell onto the mattress. The shadowy ceiling above him was simply staring down at him, the resolution of knowing that he wanted the Omega so badly made Dean smile, but the ecstasy of accepting the challenge of making the beautiful Omega falling in love with him, came crumbling down like the structure of an ancient temple, falling into destruction.
Garth faced Castiel, jumping out of his seat and hugging his fellow Omega. “See ya soon, angel.”
for him. He had to be; he will be. The Alpha just knew it. Castiel’s willowy hands slowly traveled upwards, his fingertips ghosting over Dean’s neck. The Alpha growled softly when the Omega rested the palm of his hand against Dean’s cheek, caressing it with a tenderness that the Alpha never knew existed.
The Alpha couldn’t stand it anymore, the scent coming from Castiel’s collar was being amplified to a higher degree that Dean felt himself becoming nauseous with an unfiltered rage. The Alpha could feel his stomach clenching uncomfortably, and to make things even worse, the idea of letting the Omega press his body against Dean’s was sure enough to make the Alpha vomit.
, the little Alpha loved his mommy so freaking much. “Mom?”
“Why don’t you name him?”
The Omega immediately went pale, he couldn’t breathe. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Where on earth do you get these ideas? I don’t know, but you’re wrong. Lucifer loves me and I love him back, we’re a happy couple.”
The Alpha could feel a headache starting to form,
The houses that came into view were small, the neighborhood seemed mediocre and the townspeople seemed friendly enough. Castiel was bubbling with curiosity, never had he seen a town where its population mostly consisted of enormous families with happy smiles on their faces. The children running freely through the nicely trimmed yards were the closest thing to freedom that the Omega has ever seen since he was a child.
Wood, polished and smooth. Carpeted floors, soft with a comfortable layer of being scratchy. Odd knick knacks, encased pistols with silver bullets. Home, secure and inviting. It was all so
Gabriel smiled widely, pleased with himself at already securing this position for his little brother. “I’m on it, boss.”
And it would’ve been perfect, the sight of the Omega’s pupils being dilated along with the red flush making Castiel’s skin glow brighter with every passing second. The Alpha, aroused with carnal urges, his features becoming darker by the ever-pulling sensuality that made Dean want to take the Omega as his rightful mate.
Piece by piece, the Alpha dismantled the wooden fence, breaking boards of wood until there was nothing left but splinters. After what seemed like hours, Dean’s anger began to falter and once again, the Alpha was faced with the consequences of his own anger. Dean looked down at his hands and with an unbelievable hatred bubbling at the surface of his mind, the Alpha kicked aside the broken pieces of wood and entered his house, slamming the door right behind him.
Dean felt like complete shit. “Cas, I didn’t mean —“
the Alpha would rather starve himself to death than defile the Omega’s integrity.
Dean was barely finishing the last rounds of his rut; cotton sheets were soiled in copious amounts of cum, pillowcases were stained in sweat and torn to pieces, and the Alpha’s large cock was sore beyond belief, swollen every time it became erect and pumping with blood. The intense wave of hunger, lust, and the carnal ache for
Dean entered the kitchen, the air filling up with pheromones blossoming from the grumpiness that radiated from the Alpha. Dean turned on the coffee machine, waiting patiently until the coffee pot was filled with coffee. The Alpha filled up a large amount of caffeine into his mug and leaned against the kitchen island, mindlessly staring at the house next door and sipping at his coffee.
Without meaning too, the Alpha snarled hatefully and that’s when Dean realized that there was something wrong with this picture. After every rut, whether spontaneous or not, Alpha senses were usually hypersensitive. Sight, sound, taste, touch, and especially, smell was even more delicate per say. And anything threatening those five senses were an invitation to aggressive behavior.
Which is why the Alpha never stayed with anyone for more than 24 hours, quickly bouncing back onto his feet and fucking someone different for the night. And it is also why Dean never exposed himself to anyone before, he just wanted everyone to see him as the hot Alpha who was a good fuck, which up to this point, he didn’t mind gaining a reputation of being a goddamn sex symbol.
But now, it was time for Sam to go, the two Alphas were walking out of Dean’s house, the older Alpha wrapping his arm around Sam’s broad shoulders. “Oh Sammy,
And to make things even cuter, Castiel’s name was embroidered onto his romper, located at the left side of the Omega’s chest was the finely woven string of glittering baby pink thread. And not to say that his outfit was an overload of cuteness but along with a pair of pearly white Keds, it was safe to say that complimenting Castiel with the words,
At first, the Winchesters worked for themselves; responding to no one and choosing their clients of their own accordance. Of course, their lifestyle was far from perfect; with the amounts of money saved up, they managed to get by with cheap motel rooms and somewhat passable food that kept their bellies full.
The Alpha instinctively reached forward, ready to embrace the Omega, pushing out calming pheromones to relieve Castiel’s stress, making him feel loved and protected when the Omega stumbled backwards, knocking over the stool behind him.
There was a sinful smile across the Omega’s lips along with the hottest lip bite Dean has ever seen,
The Omega nodded, forcing a smile. “I fell down the stairs. Happens all the time. I’m very clumsy with my feet and well, a simple trip and down I went.”
, Castiel needed to move on from this.
interview. I’ll see you both tomorrow.”
Castiel was the ocean and Sam would give anything to drown himself in between the Omega’s legs, lapping away at the source of the scent which only became stronger with Castiel’s arousal.
And his family, how could they…
Castiel smelled black pepper being simmered lightly. The gushing aroma of spices scenting the air was impeding his ability to breathe properly, it scared the Omega and he wanted more.
Without knowing it, everything was about to fall apart, like twigs snapping into pieces, the Alpha’s patience had finally come to an end. It was something that Dean couldn’t control, yet it was the perfect invitation of letting his Alpha instincts change him into something he never wanted to be. The word
mate. The scent alone was enough proof for the Alpha to know that the person he’d fuck everyday and treasure for the rest of his life… was
Bobby snorted. “Are you kidding me? That Omega would have married me and
Dean snorted, rubbing the palm of his hands against the side of his thighs. “Right. Castiel, that’s a very… uniquely beautiful name.”
has Dean ever been this much of a blushing mess in front of a guy before, sure half of the men who fucked him were nice looking but none of them had the full capacity of eliciting his girly reaction happening at this very second.
this felt like a scene from a really nasty porn video. The hot and strong Alpha who was a mechanic — covered in sweat but still the sexiest thing on the block, thank you very much — was knocking on the door, waiting and not expecting the Omega living inside the house to be a twinky, shy, and
Unlike Dean, Sam Winchester grew up with an open mind and a more positive attitude towards Omegas, especially human Omegas. Ever since Sam was a little boy, he believed that everyone deserved the same level of respect, Omegas included. In fact, during his time in school, Sam’s best friends were actually human Omegas.
liking to Rufus. Dean formed a thin line with his lips, balling his hands into fists and telling himself that he wasn’t being challenged by Bobby or Rufus. But hell, Dean couldn’t deny that the sight of two Alphas flirting with the Omega was making him incredibly jealous, to the point where he wanted to lay his hands on Castiel’s hips, staking his claim over the Omega and snarling at Bobby and Rufus to
The Omega didn’t understand how he was able to stand on his own accord, the contrasting smells of both Alphas were clouding his mind and fogging his vision. Castiel initially forgot the main reason as to why he was here, but his body was telling him to present to Sam and Dean Winchester, to strip himself bare and stand on all fours, presenting his leaking hole as an invitation to the Winchesters’ enormous cocks, stuffing him full and fucking the living shit out of him.
The Alpha cut off the Omega immediately, knowing how that sentence would end and Dean
” or “
Castiel was whining beautifully, pushing his ass against the Alpha’s cock, becoming needy and desperate. “
Gabriel gave a tight smile. “Nah, kid. I’m okay. Boys, be with your mom right now.”
Dean was running towards his mother.
The Omega continued with the kisses of his touch against Dean’s skin, making the Alpha purr loudly when Castiel understood the horrid realization of what he was doing.
Sam looked back at uncle Gabriel. “Are you sure you don’t need our help?”
Dean couldn’t handle the idea of the Alpha hurting the Omega, ridiculing him before the eyes of others and taking sick pleasure in embarrassing the Omega. Dean was already climbing the fence when Sam appeared behind the Alpha, grabbing the hem of Dean’s jacket and pulling him back down.
, the Omega’s eyes were enticingly hypnotic. They were the exact representation of opal-colored gemstones that sparkled with every shade of blue that ever existed in this universe. With every flick of the Omega’s eyes, Dean felt himself becoming lost in the abyss of the calm and brewing ocean.
Is it possible for the Omega to be even cuter than what he was already? Probably. Then, like a sharp slap to the face, the Alpha was brought back to his senses and
Rufus smacked Bobby across the head, “Ya old fart, move aside! This precious creature is mine. Come here, Castiel. Give me some sugar.”
Then the Alpha’s eyes,
Dean looked back at his younger brother. “I’m sorry for losing it. Though to be honest, I was close to beating the hell out of you for stopping me.”
Was Castiel going to kiss him?
Dean looked down at his bleeding knuckles, the stinging pain of torn skin didn’t bother him, the Alpha didn’t even flinch.
Lust, hunger, sex, submission: deadly sins, indeed.
, the Omega slipped his delicate fingers underneath the waistband of his briefs and began to push the fabric down when the Omega suddenly turned around.
Too much for Sam and Dean’s liking. Benny entered the diner and immediately, the Alpha approached Castiel from behind. The two Alpha boys watched with bleeding hatred as Benny wrapped his arms around the Omega’s waist, greeting Castiel. Sam and Dean couldn’t hear their conversation but the Omega smiled at Benny and kissed him on the cheek, probably reciprocating their afternoon greeting.
Well, that seemed like a story that Dean needed to earn in order to hear. Then the Alpha’s mind began to wander. There was a surplus of questions pouring through his mind, was
don’t stop.”
Both Omegas shook hands, Garth being the first to announce, “I think you’re probably going to be my best friend.”
every inch of the Omega’s gorgeous body.
Castiel jumped off the bed, rummaging through his closet. “Okay Gabriel! I’ll be there. And thank you! Thank you so much! I owe you one.”
Already, Dean knew that the stranger was an Omega due to the man’s smaller body and
the nickname slipped past the Alpha’s lips, he was already getting
The Omega could feel the heat of Dean’s breath against his mouth, minty and irresistible. “Even so, it’ll be a waste of your time.”
Castiel — nervous being an understatement — gently lifted his hand and reached forward, fingers trembling as the Omega tenderly ghosted his fingertips over Dean’s freckles. The Alpha froze, not really understanding what Castiel was doing until the lighthearted touch against his cheekbones made Dean’s stomach flutter with dozens of butterflies.
How could he? How was he capable of treating the Omega that way? It was no different than how Lucifer treated Castiel.
With a single greeting, both Alphas said, “Benny.”
The Omega blushed underneath John’s gaze, slipping his hand into the Alpha’s larger one. “Castiel, Castiel Novak.”
The Alpha grounded himself, focusing on the Omega’s presence and letting his eyes rake over the endless bruises blossoming across the Omega’s face. There were yellow bruises all over the Omega’s cheeks, green veins popping against his skin. And if that wasn’t enough, there were angry black and blue bruises across the Omega’s cheekbones, staining his beautifully pallid skin.
Dean felt his breath stuttering, his voice taking a darker tone, strong but unsure. “
Chuck rolled his eyes, embarrassment staining his face. “That’s Gabriel, for you.”
The Alpha really didn’t know what to say to that, so Dean shrugged nonchalantly, nervously rubbing the palm of his hands against the side of his thighs. “It was nothing, Cas. I… I’m just glad you’re okay. And if you ever need anything, I’m just a door away.”
Lucifer passed Castiel and blew him a disgusting kiss. “I’ll be seeing you again, whore.”
Dean wished that the Omega knew that the pain he was going through, wasn’t only his pain, it was Dean’s pain as well. If he could, he’d take every ounce of that pain and bury it deep inside his heart, Dean was willing to take every beating and abuse given to the Omega. Dean was happy to bear scars, anything but to have the Omega go through this alone.
, screw his stupid protective instincts of
the Omega could tell that Jack was an energetic boy. “Great! Maybe we can go shopping together. I know a great mall that’s not too far. We can buy clothes and go wild! Is that okay with you?”
Lucifer smiled darkly. “Haven’t you heard, the king gets bored and he needs new toys. So, I was going to trick Castiel into selling his soul and making him Crowley’s whore.”
The Alpha tiredly sighed while slipping into his pajama bottoms — which were awesomely super soft — and dragging his feet towards the bathroom door. Dean pulled off a gray robe resting on the hook. The Alpha sleepily put on his robe, not even bothering to tie the sash around his waist and deciding to stay home.
For three days,
Gabriel cleared his throat, lazily lifting his hand and capturing John’s attention. “Mr. Winchester, I think I have the perfect candidate.”
Just admitting this to himself, Castiel knew that he was in deep trouble.
Dean pushed himself to his feet, heading towards the house next door when he was stopped by Sam again.
Sam was epically
The Alpha yelled angrily, he hated himself. He was a monster like Lucifer and that didn’t sit too well with him. Dean wanted to break something, he wanted to feel pain, he wanted to lash out and destroy everything. The Alpha was about to get up when
Out of everything, scaring Castiel was the last thing he wanted to do and the Alpha certainly didn’t want the Omega to think that he was just like Lucifer. “Cas, I’m not gonna hurt you. It’s okay, no biggie. You can touch my face all you want, I don’t mind.”
The beatings weren’t so bad until Castiel’s scent became ripened by the new age of teenage hood, making the Omega more desirable and giving Castiel his first heat. At the time, Alphas took advantage of Omegas during their heat, breeding them with or without their Omega’s consent. In short, Lucifer took advantage of Castiel during his state of hunger, arousal, and the compelling need to have a knot inside him.
“See ya, kid.”
the Omega’s girth was too cute for words; it was smaller than the Alpha’s and Dean was certain that he could devour the entire length in one gulp.
Literally.
“Oh my god, they fucked you, didn’t they?!”
Castiel believed that the Alpha was a prodigy, it seemed ridiculous but the Omega was positive that Dean’s cock was so huge that it probably made its way past his stomach and before Castiel could reach the headboard before him, keen on finding something to hold onto before the Alpha left his ass battered and completely fucked out.
This was by the far, the prettiest Omega the Alpha has ever seen and like all the Alphas waiting in line to date Castiel, the younger Alpha was smitten.
“And every bone in your body until your stupid ass can’t even get up to take a piss.” Bobby said through gritted teeth.
Castiel blushed at the compliment. “Thank you and yes. I just moved in a couple of days ago.”
Dean could feel it, the boiling pools of steaming water simmering at the base of his temper; it was evident that the Alpha just wanted to soak his hands into the warm blood belonging to Lucifer, Dean wanted to feel the rush of power flowing through his veins as he’d slowly tear Lucifer apart, until there was nothing left but the confirmation of knowing that the piece of shit Alpha would never
“She’s an Alpha magnet, Sammy. Her ass, that thing bounces with every step she takes and her tits. Let’s just say I’m willing to go into town with them. Just
Dean’s scent was vigorously potent; the Omega was surrounded by heavy masses of dark grey clouds, the smell of firewood burning through the cracks of strong trees and their indestructible bark, the freshly exploding sounds of pine cones being cooked by the sea of flames caused by forest fires, and the smoky fragrance of whiskey rolling around Castiel’s mouth, burning as it went down his throat.
“How much you wanna bet on that?”
The Omega looked up, eyeing the Alpha suspiciously. “Why?”
A loud voice was ringing through the Alpha’s skull, it was instinctive and predatory. That only pushed Dean to bear the horrible pain in his mouth, his canines sharpening as they made their appearance. The Alpha’s mouth was bleeding, the tang of copper along with copious amounts of saliva were making Dean even more thirsty to rip into Castiel’s scent gland, marring the skin into an engraved claiming mark.
This was a cruel punishment. Castiel knew this, the Omega was amongst those who reached the simple goal of being happy. Something he could never have, something he didn’t know how to covet, and certainly something that wasn’t meant for him. Basic living necessities were at the tip of his fingers, the closest thing to heaven he’ll ever know.
My god, how was this even possible, staring into the man’s eyes was a gateway to the ocean, watching as the waves lapped against the rocks and hearing the gentle melody of the water kissing the sand.
The Alpha felt his heart aching; if Castiel stood a bit more closer to him, he’d be able to hear the steady and melancholy beats of Dean’s broken heart. It physically hurt the Alpha to hear the Omega talk this way, to deem himself unworthy and unimportant. It was almost as if Castiel had made peace with dying at the hands of Lucifer, knowing damn well that even if he died, nobody would care.
Garth threw the phone at Castiel’s face. “Rise and shine buttercup! It’s your
Dean’s girth was hotly kissing his abdomens, pre-cum was messily smeared against his stomach. The Alpha’s shaft — gigantic by all means — was protruding outwards, seeking the tight embrace of a
Dean is taken aback. “Me? Not patient?” he asks. Then he laughs, “You’re full of shit.”
Then he exhales.
Dean looks up at Cas from his knitting. He won’t tell Cas what the end product is meant to be, but the lavender yarn is one of Cas’ favourites “A road trip?” He looks out the window; the sun is nearly set. Deep indigos bleed across the sky. “Like now?”
Dean bites back a smile. He races up the stairs, pointing at Cas, “I’ll prove you wrong, just you wait!”
The Empty scrambled his senses, disoriented him. Ever since his first disconnect from Heaven, it had taken Cas a long time to acclimatize to the large amounts of sensory input humans face every day. The buzz and chirp of electricity, the way velvet sticks to the grooves at the tip of one’s finger, the smell of the earth following a thundershower, or the chill of exposed skin. Castiel finds goosebumps are such a strange phenomenon to experience. Now the oriole’s birdsong is like biting a carrot, the sun a never-ending whistle, and the leather of the car seat reminds him of a cat’s tongue brushing across his skin. None of it feels right.
Claire and Kaia sit with their legs outstretched on the grass. Claire has her arm around Kaia, and Kaia rests her head against Claire’s shoulder.
Cas fights a growing smile; it’s a losing battle. “You’re welcome. I know how much you like them.”
Dean hits the top step, and Cas is about to turn away to the kitchen when Dean calls up at him from the upstairs landing, “Hey, Angel!”
“What do you see up there?” Dean asks.
Dean prays.
It doesn’t help that Dean has reverted back to silence. He hasn’t been able to speak since Cas’ goodbye. How could he? What is there to say? They saved the world and now they are alone. These are simply the facts of their story. And now the rest of their lives await. But what use is a chance at life if they have to face it alone?
There’s still so much Dean doesn’t know. Does Cas even want to come back? Dean didn’t even say it back; would Cas still want to come home to him? What will the words sound like out of Dean’s mouth?
A lie wasn't meant to sound sweet. His lies never did. His lies were rough and lacked all melody. They were sour and left a rock sinking in the bottom of his stomach. Castiel couldn’t understand how this lie specifically stuck to him, the grains of sugar digging at his core.
Dean is back at Cas’ meadow, desperate to escape the suffocating silence of the bunker. The sun is shining brightly on him; he squints as he scans the abundance of wildflowers blooming between the grasses. The weathered windmill stands tall, if not a little decrepit far off to the side. The sunbeams are warm, and, if Dean focuses long enough, he can almost imagine the warmth of Cas’ grace.
Jack holds out his other hand, and opens his fist. Squished into his hand is a white glob that was once a marshmallow. “For you!”
As Dean secures the tape to the front of the diaper, Jack stretches his arms and yawns.
“We should have more days like this,” Cas says, leaning his head against Dean’s shoulder.
Jack is up at irregular intervals, the 5 S method only works a quarter of the time, and Dean doesn’t know what kind of sleep he’s supposed to get when the baby is sleeping, because all that he sees in his dreams is the blood spreading through the white of the dress shirt, quickly followed by the flood of iridescent light expelling itself from the stab wound.
Cas stares out at the road. "I don't need it," he says. "It's yours now."
before, but that was directed at everyone, not just Dean. Cas was dying, briefly, and he was preparing his final goodbye. It would be ludicrous to even consider those words were meant for him.
Dean raises an eyebrow in question.
“And thank you,” Cas says to Dean.
He doesn’t know why his chest is heavy with a never-ending emptiness. It doesn’t make sense, the way he feels incomplete without him. Dean can’t comprehend how Sam doesn’t feel the same way; how Sam has seemingly moved on after only a week. Seven days for someone so integral to their lives for the past eight years? They couldn’t just let go of Cas . . . not with such ease.
As Dean drives away he feels a small spark of hope light in his chest. It’s a fire that doesn’t burn his heart, the way anger so often does, but rather it’s a gradual warmth that melts the poisonous lead that weighs him down. Dean doesn’t feel he deserves a lot from this life, but if he deserves anything, he deserves this. For once in his miserable life, he deserves to be selfish for the sake of his happiness. His life does not need to be one of misery and anger. Not anymore.
And most of all, he doesn’t understand why his heart flutters and fights against the weight of grief when he thinks about Cas holding Jack in his arms, at Cas singing Jack to sleep with all the wrong lyrics. He was part of the family. Cas was so inherently a part of him that Dean, Dean didn’t know what to do without him.
Dean stops, giving Cas a once over. “Okay. As long as you know where you’re taking us.”
Cas shakes his head, “Your hair is short –”
. “I want you to stay,” Dean says, his voice never wavering. It does crack, though, ever so slightly.
If only he could put his mouth to good use and say things that weren’t accusing or defensive. Much like everything else in his life, everything he touches is turned into a weapon. Words are by no means an exception to this. If he’s honest, he should keep his mouth clear of them.
Dean pulls away, catching his breath. He doesn’t dare loosen his grip on Cas’ coat. “Is that enough?” he breathes, “’cuz you said it, bud, way back when I asked you what about this was real.”
“Every day, with everything I am,” Cas says, brushing his thumb against the apple of Dean’s cheek, “Because I’m nothing without you.” He leans down to kiss Dean. Dean’s nose is cold against Cas’ skin. Dean sits up more, and grabs a fistful of Cas’ sweater, pulling him down. Cas’ hand moves to trace the hair around Dean’s ear before breaking away. “I love you,” Cas says. “I’m sorry for making you wait.”
“You should not have risked yourself for me like that. You are meant to have a life, you are meant to be happy. That’s not a life with me.”
Dean’s worked so hard the past week seeing everything that wasn’t Cas, pretending he could move on. He had his time with him. He gave his last, final pray in desperation, he wrapped Cas for the pyre. He struck the match. Cas was gone. He had to accept that. And yet, Dean can’t seem to escape him. He’s everywhere, except in the flesh.
“I thought –” Dean pauses, his throat works, “You had to know?”
Dean never could have pictured himself here, rocking in the rocking chair, humming to the little bundle in his arms. It’s the semblance of a normal life, of something he could have had, once long ago. He thought he lost it, all those years ago with the hunting and the monsters and whatever he’s let himself turn into. But if he had a chance to turn it all back, give it another go, live another life, Dean couldn’t imagine being anywhere else but here.
He can see it in Sam’s face as well, his searching look around every corner, hoping for Eileen to appear and run into his arms. The way Sam has no one to spend his day with. Dean feels similarly. What he wouldn’t give to have his family back. Sure he has Sammy and Sam has him, but they’ve relied on each other solely for too long. They need other people to share their lives with. But there’s no one left – everyone’s dead, lost, or otherwise. They were family, too, and they didn’t need Winchester blood to feel welcome around the bunker. Now the bunker is unsettlingly quiet. There’s no activity, no life to be had within its walls. The bunker is as dead as everyone they’ve lost.
Then why is he still making the same mistakes?
Dean’s eyes widen. He turns in his seat to face Cas. “You drove into this field without knowing how to drive out?”
A tremor runs down his hand. He’s letting down the world, he’s letting down Sam and Eileen and Jack, and he’s letting God win. And he’s about to lose his best friend.
He needs him. He’s needed him for a long time. And now’s his last chance to get him back. He deserves it, even if Cas doesn’t want to come back to him. But if that’s the case, Dean will let him go. He can do that, for Cas. He just wants him back.
“Oh good,” Dean says, reaching for Cas’ hand beneath his sweater sleeves. “Wouldn’t want to starve out in who-knows-where.”
The guilt that twists in his gut and hammers against his heart, that’s as much a part of him as his left arm, or the bend of his legs, or the handprint that was once so distinct against the skin.
Cas isn’t used to the way human lungs stall in a crisis. He can’t say he likes it. “How do I know this is real?” he asks.
He’s not even sure he heard properly. He’s not even sure it’s real.
He kept the words out of his mouth, and now they poison his every fiber. It’s no longer a cold ache in his heart; it is a grotesque tumor that curdled within him, eating him away from the inside out. It leaves him feeling sickly, pale, and heavy with grief.
Cas laughs now. “Whatever you want,” he says, and his next choice of words just makes him laugh more, “dear.”
If only he could bring himself to say it now.
He doesn’t just have everything he needs; Dean Winchester finally has everything he wants. For once in their long lives, they have what they deserve.
They both slam their respective doors, and settle into their new seats.
Jack nods, rubbing his eyes.
Castiel’s eyes are lifeless. He isn’t seeing Dean, he’s seeing the man getting in the way of the angel tablet. It isn’t right. It isn’t Cas.
The slam of their truck doors rang through the night. Moths and mosquitos swarm around the headlights before they shut off. Dean swats at some of them. The dew is heavy in the air.
He keeps saying that.
Dean sits slowly into the rocking chair, watching Jack. He doesn’t move an inch in Dean’s arms, content in the blanket.
“You believe your emotions make you weak. You believe strength can never be found in vulnerability, but /look at you/,” Cas murmurs hotly, voice pitched lower than usual with lust and raspier from having Dean’s cock down his throat. It’s the sexiest damn thing Dean’s ever heard, even as it breaks him apart. A dry sob bubbles from his chest as Cas pushes a third finger into him, curling against his prostate with the other two with effortless precision. Dean’s mind reminds him of the word /torture/.
He can feel Dean frown against his skin. “So you’re telling me our sandwiches are covered in our kid’s cooties?”
But Cas didn’t.
Dean thinks it’s a load of bullshit.
Evidently not. They rushed into things, they didn’t think, and look where it’s got them. Twelve years of fighting continuous apocalypses – honestly, more like one long, way too drawn-out apocalypse.
“Dean.”
The expression Dean wears is one of that kind, one that would seem a mystery to anyone else, intent locked behind infinitesimal barriers. But Cas is the key to Dean’s heart, and he knows with every line, every muscle in Dean’s face what he’s saying. It is a look that Cas will never forget.
“Yeah,” Dean says, his voice pitching up.
Jack was screaming. He was up again.
“I made him wash his hands!”
With the small creature sitting still in the grass, its wings brought back against its body, Cas can see it is a bug, an insect to be more specific. A
Dean looks up at Cas, resting back on his knees. All this time with him, all these feelings he’d had hidden away for being silly, for being
Cas only chuckles, reverberating pleasantly against Dean’s neck, and he pulls out of him only so he can snuggle up properly. His angel likes to cuddle after sex. Dean is okay with that, as it turns out. He’s okay with every single damn bit of it. “Yes, well — I did what must be done.”
“Hush. I’m /explaining/.” Grace suddenly forces Dean’s arms above his head against the mattress which is, uh, /way/ hotter than Dean expected it to be. He will spend the rest of his life denying the sound he makes. Trying to move is futile. It should bring back memories of all the unpleasant times he’s been bound and trapped but he’s neither of those things, not with Cas.
In his haste to kiss him, Cas knocked Dean’s beer onto the floor as he climbed across the table, hands fisted in his flannel, and Dean found he didn’t much mind that at all. The passion of angels is truly something to behold.
This one is biting and needy and /desperate/ because Dean’s so keyed up, emotionally and sexually, he actually thinks he might explode soon — and not in the good way. But Cas gives back as good as he’s getting, sucking Dean’s lips swollen and licking his tongue up against the roof of his own mouth, dirty and fucking /perfect/. Those large hands grip Dean’s hips and yank them down and up, sliding to the backs of his knees to make him spread nice and wide for him.
“I lo—I love you, Cas, baby, I /love/—,”
“Yeah, ah — fuck, baby, /yeah/, fuck in me like that,” Dean babbles, arching and scratching at him like a man possessed. He does get his legs free and they instantly take their place around Cas’ waist, holding on /tight/ as he lifts his hips as much as he’s able. Cas grunts out his name, grips his hips tight enough to bruise — fuck, Dean /hopes/ — as he moves in him. A shift of his angle and he’s suddenly right /there/, cock pounding against his prostate and sending sparks flashing behind Dean’s closed eyelids. He cries out until he’s hoarse with it and then cries out some more, nails digging grooves down Cas’ back.
Their clothes vanish in record-speed without needing a lick of grace at all. Speaking of lick, Cas is currently taking it upon himself to taste every inch of Dean’s mouth, hungry and deep and /hot/. He’s pressing Dean into his mattress, kicking apart his thighs with a well-placed knee and grinding their hardening cocks together as Dean grunts and groans into the kiss. And Dean’s not exactly idle — no lover of his on the planet can call Dean Winchester a pillow princess. His hands rove down Cas’ back and grab two handfuls of angel ass, using the leverage to rub them harder against each other. He combs his fingers through the messy, slightly-greasy hair he can’t get enough of, scratching uneven nails against his scalp as Cas shudders and gasps. He’s not exactly sure what Cas has planned but if it involves more of /this/, he’s definitely game.
And then Cas pulls back. Dean chases his mouth and growls when he misses, craning up from the bed as much as he can with Cas’ weight bearing down on him. Even his hips have stopped moving. “Cas, angel, baby, come /on/,” Dean groans, heels hooking around Cas’ calves as he runs his hands down that toned, smooth chest. He’s so hard it hurts and he can see Cas isn’t doing much better.
And Dean, well. Dean thinks he might just be willing to learn.
Their foreheads press together; his fingers inside Dean still where they are. “I am helpless to do anything /but/ love you,” Cas murmurs into the hot space between their lips, “because you are /everything/ to me.”
“Yes. And so why would I bother to lie to you?”
“I love you for all you are, Dean. Every inch of it. All that you hate, I hold so precious and dear.” As Cas speaks, he kisses his way back up Dean’s body, slow and sensual even as his fingers start to piston relentlessly inside of him. Needy, higher-than-they-should-be “ah’s” escape Dean’s lips with each one. He couldn’t stop if he tried at this point, his hands fisted on either side of his head. “You have given me so much. A family, a son. Hope. Redemption.” Cas punctuates each word with another kiss, lingering over his heart and trailing back up his neck. Dean forces his eyes open to see that face come back into view. “Dean, I have been many things over the eons, but it is only with you that I have become /human/.”
Cas kisses his thigh as acknowledgment without a hint of apology. Again, /asshole/. “I love you for every flaw you believe sullies who you are.” Shit, are they /still/ doing this? Dean groans with more frustration than lust (in theory) as he fucks himself on Cas’ thick fingers, still thrusting and scissoring inside of him. They curl suddenly, brushing his prostate, and he cries out and thrashes with it. He can feel precum bead at the head of his cock and slip slowly down it, and he sure as fuck feels that ironically-sinful tongue lapping it up. “They make you human, Dean. They are a testament to the lessons you’ve learned, the man you’ve grown to be. They are your battle scars. They are /beautiful/, and they could never change the way I see you for the worse.”
“Let me show you, Dean,” Cas says, so very sure of himself. His other hand lands on Dean’s thigh, scorching even through the denim as he slides it up, slow and purposeful. “Let me explain.”
“Are you close?” Cas pants, hot breath against his ear making him shudder. “Are you close for me, Dean?” They’ve only had sex a handful of times so far but Cas is already an expert at saying exactly the right thing, pushing every single button he has. And clearly, he’s showing that off tonight, pulling all the stops. His hips do a swivel that’s downright fucking /filthy/, grinding against his prostate and forcing another sob of sound from him. “You want to come on my cock like this?”
When the hot, blunt head of Cas’ cock presses against his hole, Dean actually /mewls/, legs fighting in his grip with the urge to lock around his waist. “You want me to fuck you, Dean?” Cas grunts, losing some of that angelic composure as he starts the slow press /in/. It’ll never stop being endlessly hot to hear him curse, especially like this. Dean nods frantically, one hand scratching down Cas’ back as the other stays locked in his hair. “Say it. /Say it/.”
The finger in him starts a slow rhythm he sorely hopes doesn’t last. It isn’t enough, even paired with the hot suction around his cock, but it’s so damn /good/ all the same. Cas thrusts it deeper with every push in, twisting and curling before he finally adds that second finger to the party. It’s a burning stretch Dean instantly wants more of but then the delicious heat around his cock lifts off. “/Dammit/, Cas,” he rasps, hips lifting of their own accord before pressing back down against those fingers.
Dean has no answer for that. He wishes he had a beer to excuse his silence. Maybe one day even more shit will get easy, the type of shit one has to talk about in relationships. Maybe one day Dean will be able to express how downright unlikeable he sees himself, how his self-loathing runs so deep that believing Cas loves him feels beyond impossible, feels like a joke. Cas seems to understand it all anyways. His thumb rubs a slow circle on his back and he leans in, ghosting his lips along the hard line of Dean’s jaw. Intimate and reverent. It’s so unexpectedly seductive Dean tenses up and has to swallow hard, mouth suddenly dry.
Garth gave a forceful slap to the Alpha’s shoulder, snorting at Dean’s reaction. “Sayonara, bitch.”
Sam gave a final glance towards his brother, rolling his eyes at the sight of Dean hugging every Alpha — mind you, all douchebags — and clearly hearing all the cheesy remarks Dean was making whenever an Omega came up to him. Sam snorted, turning away from the sight of his horny brother and enjoying the rest of his night with Garth.
hooked.
The Alpha — guilty as charged — was the doing the exact same thing whenever he thought the Omega wasn’t looking at him. How could Dean resist? Castiel’s beauty was illuminating, like the way you look up at the night sky and all you see is an ocean of twinkling stars, burning brightly and getting more beautiful with each passing night.
Inside a small apartment, two Omegas occupied a bed together. The sheets were tangled beneath them while they slept soundly together. Mind you, not in the sexual way. Castiel and Garth have been renting an apartment for almost four years together. Castiel and Garth were best of friends, meeting each other during college and surviving the era of misogyny against Omegas ever since.
to the world of business, they were gaining high praise from companies with bigger egos and richer pockets. Such a huge success was not to be halted, at the moment, the president of The Winchester Company was John Winchester; an old-fashioned misogynistic Alpha with a taste for harnessing Omegas in their place whenever he had the chance.
Castiel was breathless as he scented the crinkle of written paper speaking the words of passion and desire, the Omega could smell a wooden desk waiting to be covered in books that provided different gateways to various worlds, the aroma of black ink waiting to be touched by the tip of a beautifully carved quill, and the mouth-watering fragrance of rolled up maps being stored away in a corner where the fine line of past realities coincide with present existences.
Sam grinned like a child waking up on Christmas morning, it was the first positive step to winning over Castiel by earning the privilege of calling the Omega by his first name. “Castiel, you were — uh, interested in the job position being offered here?”
The pain shooting through the Omega’s neck was painful beyond belief, Castiel buried his face against the sheets, his screams muffled. Dean began to gnaw at the Omega’s scent gland when his knot had inflated to its full capacity, and then the Alpha was coming. Castiel squealed, feeling the hot cascades of semen landing inside him, filling him up to a brim.
“Maybe its an Omega friend.”
Sam didn’t give a fuck about everyone’s opinions, just his own.
Sam stood up with a clouded rage, his blood was boiling at the ignorance of every Alpha in this company, heady pheromones were intoxicating John’s office and the Alpha was about to argue with his older brother when John’s receptionist, Charlie Bradbury, knocked on the door.
Dean immediately made his apologies to Bobby, mindlessly paying for the older Alpha’s drink and charging towards the gorgeous creature waiting for him. This was him, the
Sam, for a second, felt as if he were trespassing Dean’s territory. The older Alpha was baring his teeth, like a wolf challenging other pack mates to participate in a bloody fight for the prize of winning the perfect bond mate. There was a scent engulfing Sam, pheromones that were reeking of primal defensive needs, a poisoned aroma interlaced with a heady musk that was making Sam cough.
The Alpha couldn’t stand the sight of the Omega rejecting his gaze, so Dean gently whispered, “Cas, look at me.
until he was practically drooling over Castiel’s hand. The Alpha was seriously touch starved, the only caresses he’s ever been a victim to, was his mother’s touch, but he was merely a child when his mother died, the only exposure to love Dean ever knew.
Dean recognized that look, it was scolding and intimidating, well, time to prepare for battle.
silly stupid me. You’re no different than the rest of them. Was it fun playing with me? Did you enjoy seeing me cry and laughing at how pathetic I am? Is that what got you off?”
, it was Lucifer coming back home. Dean growled dangerously, today was the day. The Alpha was going to kill Lucifer and no one was going to stop him. Dean was starting to make his way towards Lucifer; his hands were curled into deadly fists, canines were sharp and lethal, and the taste of murder was making Dean’s mouth water.
Sam gave a chuckle of victory, fixing his suit and standing up to his full height, making Dean roll his eyes. “Why thank you, Chuck. If your son does choose me, I promise to meet all his expectations.”
The Omega squeaked as John took in a rosy pink nub into his mouth, suckling on the thick nipple. The taste of Castiel was driving the Alpha insane, John was rolling the rosebud over his tongue and taking the nipple in between his teeth, nipping the insanely sensitive nub and pulling at the gorgeous nipple that kept fattening against his tongue.
to understand the darkly recesses of his tainted past, the troubled reasons as to his present, and how unclear his future may seem beside an Alpha like Lucifer. The Alpha knew he was demanding too much, at a far distance he could ask the Omega anything but if it came down to it, to physically asking the Omega to reveal intimate and sensitive details as to the accumulation of his abused life.
Castiel looked at the clock, the Omega knew that The Winchester Company was about thirty minutes away from their apartment.
— going by the name tag clipped against his uniform — gave a gentle smile to the Omega. “Here ya go, sugar. Wipe away those tears and drink some water.”
And to be honest, the Alpha knew it was his fault, he didn’t save the Omega from Lucifer.
The Alpha traced the tip of his nose across Castiel’s cheekbones until his nose met the Omega’s,
Sam pulled away, eyeing the Omega’s flustered expression and somehow, the lightbulb inside Sam’s head was switched on and the overwhelming feeling of guilt settled into his stomach, making the Alpha sick of himself. This was wrong. It took Sam a hot second but the Alpha could feel his eyes being overtaken by fully blown pupils obscuring his iris’ and to Sam’s horror, he understood that he was taking advantage of poor Castiel.
