Dean was driving them to school like every other day. There had been nothing special or different about that morning, nothing that could have foretold the tragedy that was about to occur. Sam was simply staring out of the window while Dean was humming along with the music.
Dean swallowed back the lump in his throat. Was that true? How could he have possibly missed that? "Fine. Let's say you're right. Then what? I can't just tell my brother who he can or can't be with. I'm not Michael and I don't wanna be either. Not gonna boycott Lucifer like he's been doing with me."
He had planned to ask his dad if they could go to Balthazar's party, but now decided against it. He had a feeling his dad wouldn't approve of them going to the Shurleys' house if he distrusted them so much.
Sam gave him a half smile and wondered sadly when along all of this, Dean had started losing that arrogant confidence of his. "For what it's worth," he said, "he's lucky to have you."
With that he dragged Sam towards the dance floor and started moving to the beat. Sam was a bit reluctant at first but he had to admit Lucifer's enthusiasm was contagious and soon enough he was dancing as fiercely as the Shurley boy. The music switched from classic rock to old pop songs and more contemporary rock and back. Sam only knew about half the songs but he didn't care. They sang along as well as they could and improvised otherwise. When "The Black Parade" came on they shouted the lyrics at the top of their lungs. They laughed and swung around until they were dizzy and he couldn't remember the last time he'd been this happy. Sure, he thought about Jessica too and her memory was like a needle carving in his flesh. But he also knew she was gone, there was nothing he could change about that, and she would have wanted him to be happy. For the first time since the fire thinking about her actually made him smile. The thought of her dancing with him, laughing, holding his hand. How she would have liked this place, would have teased him about skipping school and being such a dork. Yes, she was gone. But she would always be with him.
Sam was still pissed at the end of the week. It was Thursday and he was back at his corner. No matter how hard he tried he couldn't forget about the Trickster deliberately bringing someone in so much danger, even if that person was Azazel. The fact that he'd done it as a reaction on Azazel's snarling at Sam only made it worse somehow, like he was responsible in a way.
They stared at each other for a moment and Dean couldn't help but pray Michael would change his mind. He had always really appreciated their friendship and he'd been so happy Michael had been willing to keep things that way, but now he felt like whatever they had was crumbling right in front of him, beyond repair.
"We got bacon, eggs, toast..." Dean said when they walked into the kitchen, and he got out a frying pan.
"More importantly, what are you doing here?" Michael repeated. "I told you all I'd be back soon enough and I left Raphael in charge."
Ignoring a fangirling Charlie next to him, Dean shrugged. "I don't know," he mocked. "Maybe you could... well, let's see... jeez, actually
"Pretty sure that's his decision, isn't it?" Dean told her before turning his gaze to Cas, silently praying that he hadn't been wrong about his friend. If Cas was gonna betray him too...
He took another drink from his beer and went for his phone, glad Sam was still at Kevin's so he had the place for himself. He'd earned it. Bringing the bottle to his lips another time, he held the calling phone to his ear and waited for it to be answered. He didn't have to wait very long.
The next day, Dean was nervous. He hadn't talked to Cas anymore. Not because he didn't want to per se, but more because every time he picked up his phone to text him, he didn't know what to say. What could he say?
"Jesus," Dean mumbled. After a few seconds of silence he added, "In what House you think Dad would be in?"
Sam stared at the screen. He didn't have the heart to tell Kevin the truth, even if his fingers wouldn't have started trembling so much that it was almost impossible to hit the right keys. He knew he'd need to explain everything tomorrow but right now all he wanted to do was sleep and not wake up.
Dean just shook his head. "Seriously though, why would anyone wanna watch a show about two miserable brothers?"
"Now, it won't be easy of course, since they're probably madly in love blah-blah-blah, but I'd like to think I've got a pretty decent plan," Gabriel continued, confusing Dean even more. "We can't wait too long either, you know, before poor Sam really starts thinking this is serious and they get all down and dirty-"
"Fine," he grumbled and without another word he turned and walked away. If their friendship really meant nothing to Cas, that was fine by Dean. So what if Cas had been his only support through the whole rediscovery of his sexuality? The only one he'd trusted with his secret? The person who'd given him advice and helped him when Dean had been too anxious to turn to his own friends and family? He didn't need the guy. He'd managed his life just as well before the Shurleys even set foot in Lawrence.
They got home, Dean got him to their room and into his bed, going down afterwards to talk to their dad. Sam just lay down in his bed. Waiting. Waiting for this nightmare to be over.
Sam's face flushed red so quickly Dean actually got worried about what he'd just said. "What?" he instantly asked.
"Because you're attractive," Castiel replied without hesitation, making Dean flushing red and even more uncomfortable.
He couldn't remember the last time him and Sam had had such a good conversation. Was he really willing to go behind his brother's back and betray that trust just because everyone kept saying Lucifer would break Sammy's heart? Okay yeah, if you put it like that... Technically it wasn't even him who was gonna do something about it. All he'd had to do was not go against Gabriel, whatever it was the guy had planned.
Samandriel blushed slightly at the undivided attention suddenly pointed towards him. "Uhm... Well, what Castiel said basically. I don't think there's anything else interesting to mention..."
"We're gonna get some drinks, you guys want something?!" Dean yelled, trying to surpass the loud music.
"I'm not telling you not to, just saying asking's never hurt anyone. He won't lie to you about it if that's what you're afraid of. My brother is many things but not a liar. Especially not to you." The corner of the boy's mouth turned up into a slight smile. "He does really seem to like you, which is rare enough at is. But love?" And then he looked at Sam expectantly, who swallowed back the lump in his throat before answering.
"He wasn't always like this," Michael explained. "Back then his name wasn't even Lucifer. Dad wanted to give us a fresh start, he renamed us all."
"Is that a rhetorical question?" Castiel asked and Dean was fairly sure that if he hadn't been such a wreck at the moment, he would have punched the guy.
And Dean honestly felt kinda sorry for him. "Michael," he started. "You're not gonna like to hear this but..."
He smiled at that and was just about to reply when he stopped, his fingers hovering above the keys. He always got this kind of insecurity when it came down to the sensitive stuff. If he told the truth and put his heart out there, Lucifer could think it was cute. Or he could laugh at him for how cheesy he was being.
Without further ado the teachers turned around and the doors opened. Some children gasped for air as soon as the Great Hall came into view. Most of them at the sight of the enormous room that looked so much older than the one in Ilvermorny, others, like Dean Winchester, at the food that was already waiting for them on the tables.
Lucifer laughed. "Already turning tables on me, huh? Okay, first of all I'm probably not gonna go to college, because studying. I don't know what kind of job I want yet. I mean, I'd like to be a CEO of something, I don't even care what, not because I want a big company, but mainly because I like telling people what to do."
When he'd gotten all of his stuff, he grabbed a piece of paper and scrambled down her name and address, which was also his current location. He always kept some information on the ones he really liked. You never knew if they would still be single in ten, twenty years or something. If he was ready to settle then, he could at least trace the few women he considered spending the rest of his life with. Even if they weren't his soulmates.
Cas and Dean sat in silence for a while longer, enjoying the view, listening to the flowing of the river. They finished their beers, Dean with his left hand because his right was still being held hostage by Cas. Not that he really minded.
If Michael hadn't been standing so close to him, Gabriel would definitely have groaned in despair. He walked up to the stool and sat down. The hat almost fell over his eyes.
Next to him, Samandriel had noticed the boy sitting next to Molly who seemed to be following their conversation. "Hi, Adam."
They arrived at the shining black vehicle and Castiel pulled up his eyebrows in surprise. It was quite a fancy car for two guys their age and he couldn't help but think about his own small apartment. Then he remembered what Dean had told him about their parents and he felt a pinch of guilt. He could understand why the other man had said about his family what he had, but Dean didn't know his family. Castiel wished he had a family that was worth returning too. It wasn't like he hated them or wished them harm, they weren't even all that bad. Truth is they just had been poison to each other.
He was interrupted by the sound of the front door opening. Dean assumed it was Sam so, eager to know what exactly had happened last night, he got up from his chair and walked into hallway. The expression on his little brother's face made at the same time him forget what he'd wanted to say and his protective side rise to the surface though.
After a couple of seconds of silence he got out, "Somebody please tell me I didn't just imagine that."
"Oh," Sam said, surprise clear in his voice. "Yeah well... We just thought we'd wait a little longer you know, see how things work out before we get serious."
Eventually they bought a couple of different kinds of honey and had to leave because Anthony should be closing up. The next stop on Dean's tour was the Roadhouse for dinner. He happened to know that Jo would be out but her mom wasn't.
"Nope, no 'but's. You wanna know if something strange is going on with this Richard guy? Fine, let's ask." And without further ado he took out his phone and started scrolling through Jensen's contacts.
Eventually, they agreed to go home. Part of Dean didn't want Cas to leave but he also knew they both needed some time to think things over. Which was exactly what he didn't want to do. His brain was starting to feel panicky already.
"Don't," he told him. "Don't give me that 'it doesn't matter' crap because it does matter, alright? It matters the world, dammit!"
"Well, I was just wondering..." his brother continued, poking in his salad. "Some friends of mine were planning on hanging out after school a little and they asked me to join them..."
At last he'd managed to make the other boy smile again. Dean smiled to  himself too, leaning against the wall while waiting for the reply  that would come in any second now.
"I'm going to Lucifer's tonight, okay?" Sam asked as he pulled into the parking lot. Bobby had dropped off one of the poor excuses of a car he still had lying around at his place last night.
Then he got up and walked back to the kitchen, and Dean felt like an ass. He really didn't have the time for a fake marriage right now and he knew it was the only way to get Misha to back off of him but that didn't make him feel better about it. He couldn't even imagine what this whole situation must be like for Misha. But hey, if everything went well, the guy would get the real Jensen back soon enough. At least that's what Dean thought would happen when he and Sam finally left.
Charlie, who was standing rather at the back with her friends, let out a soft whistle. "And I thought Shurley One was bad."
And suddenly it hit him. The pranks had stopped. The entire day had gone by without as much as one suspicious incident.
By the time Sam reached the street, his tears were flowing freely and he couldn't be bothered to wipe them away. It was late and dark outside. He didn't know where to go, he didn't want to go home and face Dean, he didn't want to face anyone, but he refused to stop walking all the same. If he did, he never would be able to get going again. His feet led him through Lawrence while his head seemed to be throbbing with thoughts and memories.
A lot of hours later, Sam fell back onto Lucifer's couch, the other boy right on top of him. His boyfriend really was in the mood for a celebration and it looked like that would be all they were gonna do for the rest of the evening.
He thought about it. Michael seemed to have already forgotten about what happened at school. Or maybe it was all just in Dean's mind in the first place. Anyway, he now realized Michael was right. And if Dean would have had the nerve to call him earlier today maybe he would have already found Sam. He gave his friend a grateful smile. "That would be awesome, thanks."
There were moments when he actually considered subscribing to a website like this but he knew it was all just loads of bullshit. What were the chances that his soulmate had decided to use the exact same site in their search for love?
Their uncle Bobby was already sitting at their kitchen table with a beer in his hand. When their dad was on a business trip, Bobby took care of the boys. They weren't really related, but since Bobby and John had been best friends for years, Sam and Dean considered him to be like a second father to them.
"I do," Castiel answered protectively. "The ones of my age. The others maybe a bit less, but I do. It's just that Michael, Lucifer, Raphael, even Gabriel, they were always kind of..." Dean could see him choose his words carefully. "the aristocracy of the family, you could say."
Crowley smiled and got a look in his eyes Dean was not happy to see. "Well, if you want to find your little brother so desperately, there might be something I can do..."
Sam didn't think he'd ever get tired of kissing Lucifer. The guy was all passion and hunger and caused a fire to erupt in Sam's stomach every time they touched. He could've stayed in that moment forever, with his tongue exploring Lucifer's mouth, one hand against his chest and the other around his neck. So when Lucifer pulled away, Sam automatically let out an annoyed whimper.
The other boy shrugged and Sam laughed. He didn't know why but it seemed to be the only thing he could do. "They were right," he said, his voice breaking on the last word. "They were all right from the start. Dad, Bobby, Dean, Mich-"
It was so right and all wrong at the same time. Even though they were completely different, the guy in front of him reminded him too much of his best friend. His best friend that was still in his own universe.
Immediately everybody started grabbing food and shouting claims. It was pure chaos, but it was the happiest, most joyful chaos Dean had experienced in a while. Until this moment he hadn't realized how much he'd need this and he was incredibly grateful Michael had suggested it.
Sam's jaw dropped. "Your name's not Lucifer?" He had trouble picturing Lucifer not being called Lucifer.
Sam smiled a last time before following him. "Dean. Dean!" he uttered, while catching up with his brother, who was fervently walking up to the porch. "What the hell are you doing?"
Castiel just stood in the middle of the kitchen, as if he didn't know what to do with himself. "I don't really have a preference."
Sam and Lucifer were sitting on a brick wall behind The Cage. It was almost 6pm so Lucifer had ordered a pizza and this was the ideal place to eat it.
The older boy ended up going into an empty classroom and Sam seized his opportunity. He ran for the door, afraid the Trickster might make some mysterious disappearance if he didn't catch him in time. He entered the classroom, frantically looking around before the door slammed shut behind him. Jumping at the loud blow, he turned around and there he was.
"Maybe," she said before adding, "Hey, what I wanted to ask you, do you know what's up with him lately? I mean, I know you two have your issues but I think there's something else as well."
"Hey, it's fine," Dean said through a mouthful of fries. The food at this school sucked but the fries were amazing. "We all have our family drama, right?"
Sam, Kevin and Charlie were sitting at the end of the Ravenclaw table together, talking among themselves eagerly. And maybe Sam and Kevin were still discussing Charlie's placement too.
He practically ran into the school building, eager to find the one person he knew would light up his mood immediately. He found Lucifer at his locker, already patiently waiting for him. The sight of the older boy alone was enough to make him smile.
Dean let out a sigh. The thought of his brother alone was enough to worry him. "Not much's changed. I'm trying... hell, everyone is trying, but honestly I'm not sure he even wants help anymore."
The other boy's eyes grew wide. "Winchester? As in Dean Winchester's brother? My brother has quite the thing for him."
He tried to shake off the idea. There was no point thinking like that, Lucifer had made it very clear that he never really cared about Sam in the first place.
The boy put the lollypop in his mouth and ran a hand through his dark golden hair before taking off. Of course Sam followed him.
That's right, Charles "Chuck" Shurley, one of the most powerful wizards of the United States, maybe even in the world, was his father. Okay, adoptive father. But that didn't change the expectations basically everyone had of them. It also didn't help Gabriel was the second oldest and therefore was compared to Michael all the time, something that usually wasn't exactly in his favor.
Dean frowned. "Wait, you mean the one send away by their father? What does he have to do with your business?"
"So that's what it was," he concluded as a new set of tears rolled down his cheeks. "You just had to show Michael that you could get a Winchester of your own."
To his surprise, he didn't even have to push the other boy into answering, even though texting in class was "bad" or whatever.
"Dean!" Castiel shouted as they finally pushed through the doors and he jerked away the arm Dean had held in a tight grip the entire time.
"So, what?" Dean commented, keeping up the act out of curiosity of what would come next. "Hate to break it to you but no one in your family is exactly all rainbows and sunshine."
"Nothing, alright?" he snapped at Misha and then immediately regretted it. He sighed and started, "Look, I'm sorry, I-"
There was still a little angry shushing but most people had given up by now and already accepted their fate.
Sam wished he could agree with him but he knew the truth. "No, he isn't. But Dean looks a remarkably lot like my dad."
"Not Gryffindor, huh?" the Hat said. "That's too bad, you'd make a fine Gryffindor underneath all of that deceiving people. Very well, in that case... SLYTHERIN!"
When the bus arrived, he grabbed onto Castiel's arm for guidance. His little brother didn't care. He couldn't feel it anyway.
Michael let out a sarcastic laugh. "Are you seriously suggesting I let Lucifer back into my family? After everything he did?"
He had been thinking about the 'but' from the moment Lucifer dropped him off yesterday until the middle of the night, when he'd finally fallen asleep. He'd thought about Lucifer, about those daring blue eyes and the mocking grin. The day they'd met, their visits to the Cage, the time they'd spend in the Corvette, he played it all back in his head. He remembered how Lucifer made him feel, the courage he gave him and the adrenaline that rushed through his body because every second with Lucifer was like an adventure, but also how easily the other boy's flirtations made him feel uncomfortable or blush or the butterflies in his stomach spring to life. Sam had realized all of that. And although he had never actually been in a relationship with another guy, he'd always been open to it. Never told a living soul but still. And he certainly would've never ever even dared to approach someone that way, but
Sam's head shot up, his eyes big with surprise. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again and frowned. "Dean, I don't know what Michael's told you but..."
"Nah, he's fine," Sam shrugged and actually felt a small smile tug at the corner of his mouth. He'd been wondering when his brother would get his anger out. "He's just being Dean."
"I'm calling Crowley, that's what I'm doing!" Dean yelled in annoyance. "Now give me back my phone!"
He could've sworn his heart would crumple right there and then. "Just a break," he smiled. "Promised." Although he wasn't sure if he'd be able to keep it.
He looked up again, back to feeling very, very uncomfortable. Jesus, he had been so preoccupied imagining them together, he hadn't even noticed Michael had started talking again. Well, at least he had been a couple of seconds ago. Now he just looked at Dean worriedly.
Molly had already opened her mouth to encourage him a bit more, but to her surprise Adam beat her to it.
experienced something like... whatever that had been. This unknown kid had basically just described Charlie's life, simply based off of... what? Her notebook?
Immediately multiple pairs of eyes turned to look at him in annoyance. Except Cas's. No, Cas was just staring down at his own feet and completely ignoring his presence. Which was actually worse.
"Yeah, I guess that's fair," Sam laughed. "Do the others know? Charlie, Jo, Benny? Did you tell Lisa?"
"What?" Dean said in a shocked voice. "I didn't... Nothing happened!" He angrily put some spaghetti on his plate.
Michael grabbed him by the shoulders and turned him around to face him, just like Dean had done last week. "You're a great brother, Dean. I'm sure that whatever it is, you two will work it out." And then he pulled him in for a hug.
The most important thing was the way they talked. It wasn't just their voice either, but also how they'd use it. Husky? Alright. Loud? Meh. Shy? Sure thing. Seductive? Hells yeah. Foreign accent? Come to daddy! It also had to do with their personality of course. Confidence always made things more exciting, although Gabriel was also the first one to try and lure out the more quiet types. Often loads of suppressed energy with those. And the physical aspects weren't completely irrelevant either. He liked his bed partners best with longer hair and long legs... and flexible, but that was usually something you only found out when it was already too late anyway. Apart from that, sure, a smooth skin and soft hair was always nice but overall he really wasn't that picky. Well, in the end they also would have to be more on the submissive side but Gabriel usually managed to awaken that in them anyway, and he didn't mind if they put up a little bit of a fight before they got there. In fact, that made it all the more fun.
Poor Samandriel looked terrified as he went to sit on the stool, but that immediately changed when the Hat called, "HUFFLEPUFF!", and he basically ran towards his youngest brother with a happy smile on his face.
His older brother had closed his eyes in satisfaction. "Tall, muscular and long hair, huh? Talking about hot."
For a moment, Sam didn't know what to say to that. If he told the truth, Dean would probably say that he was crazy again, but he
His brother gave the most innocent look in the world. "Why would you think I'm trying to say anything?"
Richard turned around at once. "Oh. Right, did I forget to tell you? I met up with Bob-o. I mean the guy had to host all of today by himself, so I just thought I'd go over to prep for the rest of the con a bit, you know, maybe jam a little too."
Sam just nodded in agreement. If they just could keep on giving these vague answers, maybe this could actually work.
As he spoke, he saw something change in Lucifer's eyes. A softness appeared in them, a vulnerability Sam had only seen once before, when they had been talking about Lucifer's family. It lasted for only a fraction of a second, disappearing as quickly as it had come up, but Sam had definitely seen it.
"My point is," Gabriel pressed, "you and Sam, you never deserved to get caught up in it. So, I wanna help you get back out before everything really goes to hell."
It was quiet for a moment. Then the Hat whispered, "I think you're underestimating your family, Sam Winchester."
Cas lent forward and rested his arms on his knees. "I was six years old when my parents died. There was an accident, that's about all I know of it. I barely remember them. There are some flashes of what they looked like but sometimes I'm not even sure if those are real. What came after were so many drastic events of change that it basically wiped out the rest. I didn't have any other relatives but I can vaguely recall a lot of moving around so I'm guessing there were some foster homes. I don't even remember the first time I saw Chuck. He must have come over in advance but the only clear recollection I have is of the first time I entered his house." He smiled and there was a spark in his eye that Dean rarely saw. "It was so... full of life. I can't claim we functioned like a normal family but I think we were happy, in our own way."
Castiel bit back a sarcastic remark. Instead he got out of the elevator and started his walk to the bus station. His brother followed closely behind.
"Dean, I'm..." Castiel started but Dean interrupted him and pointed an accusing finger in his direction.
"Hey." Sam placed a hand on his arm and gave it a little squeeze. "Don't worry about him, okay? He's just being an ass, if we ignore him, he'll stop it eventually." Not that he'd left Sam alone, not until Jess had died. He swallowed away the lump in his throat.
"Sammy," Lucifer greeted him with a wide grin when Sam walked up to his boyfriend's locker that morning. "Oh how I've missed you."
First it was his thesis that made him want to pull out his hair, then the hot guy at KU, his brother taking life way too seriously, and to top it all off, some news report about two complete strangers who just happened to run into each other and
Just as he turned his head to the left, none other than the Trickster rounded the corner. And he was not alone. Sam's jaw basically hit the ground when he noticed the amount of girls clinging to the confident Shurley. It was hard not to, since they were all over him. The Trickster had his arms wrapped around two of them, a satisfied smirk on his face, while the others just trailed behind him like a group of lost puppies. He told them something and they actually started giggling as if he was the funniest person in the whole damn world.
"Yes," the boy said and turned towards them. "It's abundantly clear why your friend is a Ravenclaw. She is smart, all be it not in a classic, scholarly way. She wasn't interested in your intellectual debate on whether or not she was fit for this House, for instance, but she does value useful knowledge. You can tell by her notebook. The corners have been crumpled so she clearly keeps it on her by all times, or at least almost, and by the little smudges of ink on her fingers you can tell she writes in quite often too, instead of just going over what's in it. Now, the question of course is what she's writing. Could be things she needs to remember, practicalities that could turn out to be useful, lists, memories, it could even be fiction, which would add to her creativity, a lesser known aspect of Ravenclaw. Speaking of, the cover and margins are decorated with drawings and stickers, including one from her American House, the Thunderbird. So she likes to explore, discover new things, she is curious and open-minded, yet
And Cas... Cas never should have gotten involved. Dean hadn't failed to notice the way the other Shurleys were watching him. Cas was going to get in a shit ton of trouble and it was all Dean's fault. He almost wished his friend had let him get his ass kicked by Lucifer. Yes, it would have been incredibly stupid but at least Dean would have gotten his point across and Michael wouldn't have been onto Cas.
Sam jumped at the voice so close to him. Still in shock he looked up, only to see a guy he had never seen before. Or did he? Then it hit him: this was the school's newest student, the one everybody had been whispering about.
Sam remained silent for a moment while he processed the words. "I should've seen through it though," he eventually said.
Sam looked up at his boyfriend, who was casually leaning back on the couch and watching him with an amused look in his eyes. Sam only glared at him, annoyed at the sudden loss of Lucifer's body against his own.
"I'm coming!" Gabriel yelled while heading down the stairs again. He was wearing jeans and green socks now but Castiel decided not to mention it.
PS, I only came up with the idea for the title afterwards but it seemed fitting and then I listened to the Linkin Park song that inspired it and now it just fits so goddamn perfectly I had to mention it.
He dropped down in his usual seat, ignoring a dirty look from Zachariah to his left. So what if Michael had turned almost his entire family against him? Like Dean cared about those stuck-up asshats. Except for Cas maybe.
"You enjoying yourself, Sammy?" Lucifer whispered against his lips and all he could do was nod. Of course that only made Lucifer's smile grow. "Good."
The next day Dean was storming through the school's hallways in an attempt to find the Trickster - or Gabriel, whatever - for the second time this week. And, as he probably should've seen coming, once again he came up empty. That guy really was annoying. Dean sighed and promised himself that one day he'd get him.
Cas laughed as they entered the shop. Dean didn't know how much time they ended up spending there but Cas was extremely interested in the different types of honey and all of their other products. Apparently the owner, a guy named Anthony, could tell how passionate he was because he soon started explaining how he arranged his beehives. It didn't take long before Cas and him were engaged in a deep conversation about bees. Dean gave up trying to understand what they were talking about very soon but he didn't mind. He was happy to just watch.
Dean just snorted. "Well yeah, but still..." He opened the Wikipedia page and started reading it out. "'Richard Speight Jr., born September 4, 1970, is an American actor, director, screenwriter and producer' - wow, this guy's been busy - 'who is known for a variety of roles including CBS TV series
"I'm sorry, Dean," he tried but his brother had already shut the door behind him, leaving Sam alone again.
"Jackpot," he mumbled to himself as he opened the page. A pensive frown on his face, he started reading through it. It was hella creepy, seeing his own words on screen and realizing that it was all in fact exactly how it had happened. Dean made a face. The thought that millions of people knew all about his life made him feel icky.
Both him and Gabriel turned sideways at once. Michael was standing next to them, arms crossed and a disapproving look on his face.
"Glad you like it." He opened the door and got out of the car, and he heard Cas do the same. When Dean went to sit on the hood, he had to motion for the other guy to join him though, and the care with which Cas sat down made him smile involuntarily.
"You're welcome," Lucifer smirked, letting go of him and getting up. "You need some distraction. What do you say you and I get out of this shithole?"
His little brother entered the living room and raised his eyebrows, clearly not impressed with Dean's current state. He ignored it though.
Lucifer tilted his head a bit and pulled up his nose. "Yeah, I don't like her any more than I do you."
The answer took a bit longer this time and he took advantage of the moment to unwrap the lollipop and put it into his mouth.
His younger brother shrugged. "I figured out who he was when he was pranking me, so I went to talk to him this morning. He actually had some very interesting stuff to say."
Kevin asked. Sam could make out some noise in the background and even thought he recognized Mrs. Tran's voice.
Dean opened his mouth, to just close it again when he didn't know what to say. "No," he eventually said. "Just... you know... didn't sleep that much I guess." He even forced a smile to go with it.
Sam felt the same way but he knew better than that and pulled back. "I can't," he breathed out. "Might be Dean."
Sam burst out in laughter at that and it didn't take Lucifer long to join him. He walked over to the younger boy and wrapped his arms around him.
"Because Lucifer, that son of a bitch, took Sam there and I don't like it," he said, becoming impatient.
Before he could even start trying though, Cas suddenly took his beer from him. Dean just stared as he put the bottle on the hood in between them, and then took Dean's hand in his and looked back at the water.
It was like the kid could read his mind. "Oh, you remember me! I'm touched," he commented while making his way to Dean.
Adam opened his mouth to protest before he realized he'd probably only make it worse anyway. So instead he decided to play safe. "Maybe."
"No," Lucifer said, only raising his voice a little bit. "Maybe it was what made me curious but I really enjoyed spending time with you, Sam, I wouldn't-"
"Okay, listen," he decided. "I don't know why your brothers are talking about me and I don't care. At least not now. I need to find my brother, have you seen him?"
Just when he thought he'd be done for, Lucifer let go of him and took him by the hand. With a satisfied look, he just said, "Let's go."
"Alright," Charlie declared just before lunch. "What is it with you? Are they giving away free food at the end of the day or something?"
His class/House mate for the fourth year now was sitting a couple of seats to his left on the other side of the table, next to his older brother. Adam only knew the boy was called Castiel because... well, he basically remembered everything about Samandriel.
If he didn't put a step back, he would never be able to get the words out, Sam realized. Or even properly breathe for that matter. So, he shifted a little, only just enough to regain his personal space, and then reached out for Lucifer's hand before he started talking.
He gave her a thankful smile. Meanwhile Jess had sat down next to Sam, talking to him worriedly. It took Sam about three minutes to fall asleep in her lap.
"I'm his husband," Sam interrupted him. "Don't worry about it, he isn't trying anything Misha hasn't done to you."
"So how's the family?" Dean asked. Not that he was so eager to have another conversation about those bastards but he wanted to make sure Cas wasn't in any trouble.
"What, you can't sit with other people?" Dean asked in disbelief. "'Cause I'm pretty sure I saw your brother and the entire cheerleader squad occupying a table of their own the other day."
Dean waited until there was a good chance Sam would already be asleep before going upstairs himself. When he entered their room quietly, he saw his brother was curled up under the sheets but he couldn't say if he was sleeping or not. He quickly changed and got into bed.
"Okay." Castiel went to sit on the stairs and Dean followed his lead. The boy gave him an expectant look.
He made his way over to his usual spot at one end of the bar. After taking a seat, he raised a finger in the general direction of the bartender - they knew his drink at this place - and listened. There was a loud group of guys in one of the booths behind him. A lonely drinker two seats to his right who was in a bad mood if the way they put down their glass was any indication. Two giggling, probably drunk girls a little further. Two men in another booth, more to the right. A couple at a table to his left. Three women at the other side of the bar who seemed to be complaining about the men in their lives.
"I'm sorry," Gabriel said, looking at him almost sympathetically, "but it is. Why else do you think they've been secretly holding hands, sneaking into empty classrooms, spending literally every free moment together? Come on, Dean-o, even you are not that stupid."
He shook his head, not just Cas but also Balthazar and Gabriel coming to mind. They too had gone directly against Michael's wishes to help Dean out, even if he still didn't understand why. "Turns out he can't control his family as well as he likes to think. Gotta say he's pretty damn good at it though. He'd already gotten to Cas before I talked to him and he changed his mind for me."
"Because," he said while taking back his phone, "if there's anyone who knows about an underground club it's him. Trust me."
Dean realized with a shock that he knew the guy. Well, at least he knew who he was, it was the same boy he had approached at Balthazar's party when he had been looking for Sam, the one in the trenchcoat.
It was a soft and short kiss, hardly more than a touch, but when Dean pulled away, his heart was hammering in his chest. His eyes shot back to Cas's, not really knowing what to expect. To his surprise though, Cas was still looking at him, except that now there was that spark in his eyes that Dean had only seen a couple of times before. The way the light reflected in them lid them up like the summer sky. It was only after a couple of seconds that Dean realized there was also a hint of smile playing around his lips.
The Trickster stood up and passed him by. "I hope you'll be happy, Sam," he said as he walked out the door.
"I mean," Sam said, dropping his voice since there were still crew members around, "there is no way an actor and his character are so much like each other. He is witty and sarcastic and outgoing and... way too sexualized."
"Oh," Samandriel stuttered again. Castiel was watching the scene before him unfold in utter confusion.
Dean was pacing up and down the kitchen with his phone in his hand. Where the hell was his brother? Sam had told him he'd got a ride, not that he was going to spend the entire evening god knows where.
"Guess your brother has a different opinion on that," Kevin commented, staring at something behind him.
Michael smiled. "Right. Hey, do you guys wanna hang around a bit after school?" he asked, looking to and fro between Dean and Lisa, who was sat beside her boyfriend.
So no, becoming friends with the locals wouldn't be easy. Gabriel really hoped British kids weren't as stuck-up as they were told to be. He groaned in annoyance at the thought alone. Next to him, Castiel frowned like this was the most challenging assignment he'd ever been given and Samandriel's eyes were big with terror. Yeah, their family was anything but normal.
Luckily for him, someone approaching them instead of the other way around was exactly what the Shurleys had hoped for.
They stared at each other angrily for a couple of seconds. Dean heard a car pull up behind them but he didn't pay any attention to it. Eventually Crowley let out a sigh and put his hands up in surrender.
Misha was already diving into the fridge, gathering all kinds of ingredients. "So, you never answered," he said, closing the fridge and getting out a frying pan from one of the cupboards. "How did it go on set?"
Dean drove them down to the city center and he parked the car in far the corner of a mall parking lot. He saw Cas looking out of the window, trying to figure out why they were here, and then the frown disappeared and his blue eyes lit up as he spotted the sign across the street. Dean grinned like a complete idiot as he noticed the surprise turn into amazement, and when Cas turned back to him, he was the happiest Dean had ever seen him. The boy looking at him now seemed to be a complete different person compared to the Cas he was used to, and the thought made his heart clench together.
"So let's just say, hypothetically, if I was attracted to dudes as well," he pulled a face while saying it, "then what? Would he have tried to break up me and Lisa?"
The broad guy looked at him in the rearview mirror and something about him was... also a little familiar? "Just need to cross the bridge. You know it's not far from here, Jensen."
He was about to call out Dean's name in surprise, but held back when he noticed Dean was ignoring him completely. He rushed through the classroom, zigzagging between the tables and past Sam's. He only stopped next to the table of one of his classmates, one of the Shurleys, a boy with dark hair who always seemed to be wearing the same trenchcoat. As Sam got more confused with every second, Dean grabbed the guy by the arm and nearly dragged him out of the classroom without further notice.
Gabriel pulled up an eyebrow. "Oh, please... Like you don't know that Lucifer is the most rotten apple in the Shurley family basket."
He couldn't wait to get out of their sight though. That wouldn't probably be the case until Dean was sound asleep, but Sam could be patient. Eventually they all went to bed, despite Dean's complaints it wasn't that late yet. Sam barely payed attention to it. He just made sure his phone was on his nightstand before going into the bathroom to change. After both brothers had gotten ready, Dean turned off the lights.
Okay, so maybe Gabriel was a little bit proud of that. "Yeah, and Lucifer here and my older brother Michael are classmates," he explained.
Kevin looked from one Winchester to another, like he wondered if he was missing something. "Uhm... Yeah no, I don't think so. You know she loves having you over."
Sam texted his brother after last period. He didn't get a reply so he assumed Dean was okay with it.
By now Sam finally seemed to have found his common sense again. If it had all been true, if this kid really was able to tell so much about a person after what couldn't be more than fifteen minutes, Sam was pretty sure he'd just met the most brilliant mind the world had ever seen. "Who the hell are you?"
The Winchesters were incredibly relieved when they finally arrived on set. Even though that probably wouldn't be any better. They said goodbye to Clif and walked towards the big building that they actually recognized from last time.
Through the school's main entrance walked a guy Sam had never seen before. Yet everyone seemed to know who he was, because they were all glancing at him not that subtly. The guy however ignored them all. He just carried on his way, looking quite bored, and casually ran his fingers through his spiky blonde hair.
John let out a sigh of annoyance at the name alone. "Arthur Ketch is Mick's boyfriend and one of those people who confirm the prejudices of Slytherins. Time after time, he's proven himself to be selfish, cold-blooded and everything but trustworthy."
Lucifer took it, turned it back and forth and handed it back to Sam. "Kansas? Sure. Not really my thing but they're alright. It's a compilation, so it should be fine."
Even if Cas hadn't been there to help him in the toilet stall, basically the entire school knew what'd happened to him on Tuesday by now.
Now Bobby's eyes moved to Dean and Sam could hardly suppress a satisfied smile. He knew this wouldn't be the end of it, but if he was going down, he would take his brother right with him.
"I promise it won't kill you," Dean laughed, and Cas hesitantly accepted the drink. As he took a first careful sip, Dean opened his own bottle, trying not to watch Cas's reaction too obviously. Not that he managed to read the expression on his face anyway.
"So, guess what I found in my locker today?" Dean said with a grin while opening up his bag. If Sam hadn't been so upset with the whole Gabriel situation, he would've probably been happy to see his brother smile again.
"Dammit, Dean... Dean, hold on! Dean! DEAN!" Michael was calling behind him, while Dean practically sprinted back to his car. Apparently his friend had trouble keeping up with him.
"Hey, Misha?" he called out. He was going to have to go out on a limb here but it was the only idea he had left.
The problem was that he had let people in, and none of it had worked out... Jess had been amazing. She was deaf too and they really hit it off from the start. For a long time Sam had actually thought she'd be the one. They had dated for months and were happy together and yet it apparently wasn't meant to be. They were so in love but also very young. It just hadn't been enough to make it work and eventually they went their separate ways, hoping that someone would come into their lives who they did have that magical connection with. Sam had to admit them splitting up seemed silly now. He still missed her sometimes.
It was only when one of the stalls opened that they broke apart, being it reluctantly. The kid was staring at them in surprise, frozen in place.
"Jesus, Crowley," Dean turned around, immediately recognizing the accent. "Could you not jump up behind people like that?"
"Okay, you are reading way too much into this," Dean stopped him. "Obviously I wasn't married to Cas last time either! This place is just different from last time, alright? Which means that instead of focusing on dead archangels, we should be trying to find a way out of here as fast as we can."
He got a little happier Molly had started talking to him every minute. "Yeah, of course! That'd be awesome, thanks."
The broad smile that Dean returned to him made... a very strange sensation happen in his stomach. "You too. And hey, if you ever need a ride again or we can help you guys out with something..." He shrugged. "Don't be a stranger."
happen to me?! I have been paint-bombed, my jacket is stolen, the realm has taken every possible shot at hurting me, I'm pretty sure I almost died,
He turned just in time to see a small blush cross Cas's cheeks. The guy got over it just as fast though. "Do you need any help?"
Dean really didn't know what to say. Yes, he'd wanted to meet Castiel and talk about this but what was he supposed to say?
"Yeah, he was the one who told me Michael liked me in the first place, so he already knew. We kinda rolled with it from there, talked about it a lot," Dean explained.
"Yeah, he's around here somewhere," Dean said, deciding not to mention Sam was eavesdropping. Misha was his husband, maybe he'd tell Dean something he wouldn't be comfortable saying otherwise. "Everything's alright, don't worry. I was just thinking... Have you ever, I don't know, noticed that Rich can actually be a lot like... Gabriel?"
Cas hadn't even averted his eyes from him and Dean was having trouble coming up with words when the guy looked at him like that.
Meanwhile Molly was looking between the two fourth-years in satisfaction, convinced that she could make this work out pretty well. "Adam here was just asking me if I could maybe show him around sometime and I was wondering if you two would like to join us?"
Sam kept waiting for who knows how long, until he finally heard Dean's satisfying soft snoring. As soon as he did, he grabbed his phone and held it under the blankets to dim the light.
Misha made his way towards them without as much as a clue of what was going on. "Hey, Jared," he greeted Sam before pecking Dean on the lips, which caused the older Winchester to turn a shade of red that tomatoes would have been jealous of. Sam was trying his very best not to laugh too obviously.
When he got to the park, he recognized two of the cars and concluded Lisa and Michael must have already arrived. He quickly parked his own and walked in, glancing around to find his friends. After a couple of seconds he noticed them sitting on a blanker together under a tree, next to a basket and two guys behind them Dean identified as Michael's brothers.
This was a complete disaster. If Dean didn't know any better, he'd say all of the world's bad luck had decided to pick on him today, and he didn't have a single clue how to get out of it.
"No," Dean repeated. "For God's sake, Cas, don't you see how stupid this is? Michael deciding who your family can or cannot hang out with? All because we had a little fight?"
When he finally found Dean at the make-up department, his brother wasn't looking happy. As soon as he noticed the shock on Sam's face though, his eyes turned worried and started towards him.
Dean gave him that dry dude-are-you-serious-right-now look but placed his foot on the container anyway.
"Yeah, my brother is into this kinda stuff," he said, still wondering how the guy had possibly gotten his hands on a car like this. "He'd love this."
"He completely spoiled them!" Lucifer exclaimed. "He was all over them twenty-four seven, took the day off after one look from them, something he never did for us!"
"Dean, my family..." Cas continued, shaking his head. "I have seen how you and Sam treat each other, how good your relationship is. You're there for each other, no matter what. I love my family but we have never been like that. And you..." He smiled. "You say I should drink alcohol and go to parties to have fun but I have been to several parties and now I have tasted alcohol too, and I think spending time with you is much more fun than either of those things."
He drove home and started calling his friends, asking if they'd ever heard of The Cage. None of them recognized the name but they all offered to keep an eye out for Sam and Charlie promised to put her hacking skills to use.
Just as Dean went, "What? No, I'll drive you, just give us a sec," Sam said, "That's fine, you can stay." He didn't really care. It left Castiel looking even more confused but he stayed put.
"Oh come on, Sam, live a little. You're what? Sixteen? The world is lying at your feet, so enjoy it while you can. Take what you want, you can apologize later. The clocks are turning, Sam. It's now or never."
His friend looked away with a little smile of his own and what Dean could've sworn was a slight blush. "Does that mean," he said, playing with one of the buttons on his trench coat, "that it's okay we just text and talk outside of school?"
Sam just watched him leave in surprise. Then closed his book and got up. "Guess that means I'm cooking then," he mumbled while walking into the kitchen.
His friend came from the other side of the park, so Dean guessed he'd taken a detour. He huffed to himself. The stuff they had to go through for their friendship...
Balthazar let out a little laugh. "No, don't worry about it. Michael definitely isn't and when it comes to the others..." He leaned forward conspiratorially and pretended to whisper, although Dean was pretty sure Zachariah would still be able to hear them. "Most of my brothers aren't exactly the partying type."
Michael nodded understandingly. "Of course, you're absolutely right. But hey, if you ever want to talk about it..."
"You're lying," he managed to get out through clenched teeth. "You're just like Michael. You and your family just can't stand it that he's happy, that he doesn't need you."
"Hello?" he yelled again. "Anybody out there? I need help! I'm stuck!" He started knocking on the door violently, hoping literally anyone would hear him. "I need some help in here! Help! Somebody help me! Sam! SAM!"
It was a common word of course but still it reminded him of... something. Something linked to Lucifer.
"Gryffindor," Sam replied without as much as a second of hesitation. "Dad'd definitely be a Gryffindor."
On both sides there were two long tables full of students who were staring at them and at the end was the table for the teachers. Right in the middle of it, in front of a large, golden chair, stood a stern-looking man in a suit. He wasn't even that tall and yet all of the American children at once decided they shouldn't mess with this man. Okay, maybe almost all of the children. His dark hair was thinning out and combed back neatly and his piercing eyes scanned through the group like those of a hawk.
But what he'd said was true. He was so happy Sam finally seemed able to smile again. Since his girlfriend's death his brother had been awfully quiet, even more than usual. He hardly talked or smiled and when he did, it felt forced. He lay on his bed and did his homework. He even read less and Dean had caught him staring aimlessly more than a couple of times. He had feared Sam might never truly recover from it and he hated that feeling. He had missed his younger brother, the smart, shy kid with the ambition to save the world.
Castiel looked at him like he was getting really sick of this conversation. "You want my advice, Dean? It's very simple. If you like Michael, dump your girlfriend and tell him. If not, there shouldn't be a problem in the first place."
Lunch at the Roadhouse was amazing. Jess and Lisa really liked their dad and the feeling was mutual. John almost considered the girls his own daughters. Of course the three of them in particular liked to mock the two brothers but Sam didn't care. He'd got all the people he loved at one table, so he couldn't be happier.
A third time he attempted to wring the lock open but it was stuck as could be. It was impossible. Only a couple of minutes ago it had closed without any struggle.
They all exchanged small greetings and now that Sam had come home, Bobby felt comfortable enough to leave the boys on their own for the night. He needed to get back to his own place, but he'd step by again the next day.
"Yeah, I've had plenty too," Dean added. He really wasn't a wine type of person. Apparently Jensen was, or at least didn't mind the drink. But it contained alcohol and Dean had needed his alcohol.
"You know what," he said, looking at Kevin. "Actually, I was thinking it would be nice if we had another game night, you think your mom would mind if I came along with you?"
"Forget about classes," Lucifer interrupted him before grabbing his hand and pulling him up. "You've been sitting in this corner for days. You need to let go a little more, Sam. You know, having fun? Remember what that means?"
Misha laughed as if he'd thought the same thing before smiling at Dean in a way that made Sam feel like he was third-wheeling the entire kitchen. "You know I love you," Misha said, his fingers gently caressing Dean's shoulder and trailing down his arm. "But let's face it, you have been acting crazy this entire evening." And then he did
"Jess," Sam whispered and then one of the tears escaped after all. He was scared to death to ask but he had to know. "Did you..."
That was when his brother burst out in laughter. And kept on laughing for what felt like an eternity. Or at least it did to Sam, who still had trouble dealing with the picture on the screen, the picture of the guy he'd talked to only minutes ago.
"No kidding," Dean commented sarcastically. Not only were they all way too different, there was also no way one person had so many biological children. That just... wasn't possible.
Dean immediately started blushing like a teenage girl, looking at the flowers with big eyes, and Sam was doing his very best to hide a big grin behind his hand.
The older Winchester grumbled a bit more before Misha walked back in and joined them at the sink. "Jared, you really don't have to help, you know."
"During these moments I would sometimes think... things," he admitted for the first time aloud. "Things I would have never thought I'd think. About a guy. I shook them off as curiosities but..." He shook his head and fell quiet. He felt so incredibly lost.
Uriel looked down - only the smallest bit but it was enough - at him and said, "Is this mud monkey bothering you?"
Sam rolled his eyes, opened the door and grabbed it. He followed Lucifer towards the door. There was a guy standing beside it but he simply nodded at Lucifer before letting them pass. They got in and Sam was overwhelmed by the sound of electric guitars and drums. He thought about how his brother might actually like a place like this. Dean loved classic rock.
After Dean had brought Cas back home, he sat Sam down at the kitchen table with more coffee and took the seat opposite him. Sam knew that his brother was waiting, giving him the chance to talk about his feelings while Dean sipped from his coffee. They both knew it would be a freaking miracle if Dean decided to start a conversation like that himself but Sam felt comforted by being given an opportunity to have one anyway.
"Thank you, Mister President. Then I suggest we now continue with the Sorting Ceremony," he said before sitting down in his seat.
Dean gave him a thumbs up before they went their separate ways. As soon as he entered the hallways, he made a quick scan for Gabriel but of course the coward was nowhere to be seen. That was alright, Dean would get to him later. The guy couldn't keep on hiding.
He could see Cas look at him curiously from the corner of his eye. "Why would I want to do any of those things?"
"No," Cas repeated, shaking his head with a pensive look in his eyes as if he were trying to solve the puzzle of the century. "There has to be more than that. Gabriel doesn't have any reason to do this. He never hated Lucifer, not like Michael and some others."
"Hey, baby!" Misha's voice suddenly put their banter to a stop. The brothers exchanged a final challenging look before silently agreeing they'd finish this later.
"Scottish," Crowley sneered back at him. "If you're gonna mock me, the least you can do is know what you're talking about."
"Sure thing, honey," she smiled and led them to a table. "You boys want to order now or should I come back later?"
"Son of a bitch!" Dean called out, bringing his hand up to his now very painful nose. Luckily it wasn't bleeding.
"I disagree," Castiel answered to his surprise. "You were willing to see the best side of my brother. Not many people do. You were just being a good person, Sam. If anything, I'd say he was stupid to deceive you."
"Hey," he breathed out as he closed his locker. He hadn't had a change (or just got too distracted) to ask to his morning, so he continued, "So how would you feel if we had lunch at my old table today?"
He walked up to the school's front door and was just about to open it when apparently someone beat him to it and slammed the door right into his face.
He felt like hitting himself in the face. The last thing he wanted was for Sam to worry about him. "It's nothing, Sammy."
Maybe it was none of his business. He was responsible for Sammy though. He would never forgive himself if he'd allowed his brother to get hurt.
"Well," Dean said, while starting to walk back to the Impala, "according to Kevin they planned on going to a club called The Cage. That ring a bell to you?"
Well, he was definitely thinking something. He wasn't sure if he should share that with Gabriel though. It wasn't like they were friends or anything. But it wouldn't hurt either, right?
Not that it mattered since Misha ignored him anyway. "Jared, you know where the guest room is!" was the only thing he said before the two of them left the kitchen.
"What?" Michael followed his gaze to the bag. "Oh no, this is for breakfast. You'd be surprised how few of us actually have a healthy one. But what are you doing here?"
Dean shrugged and lent back casually. He was quite enjoying playing with his brother like this. "Enough."
So that's why, when school ended and Dean got home, he texted Cas he would be busy for the rest of the day. He felt a bit guilty about it but technically it wasn't even a lie and he was pretty sure he'd tell Cas what had happened afterwards anyway. If Balthazar didn't swear him to secrecy, that is.
Dean nodded. "Sounds like a plan. I'll look for more in the trailer. Come find me when you're done."
Most of them slightly nodded and stopped asking questions, but when Dean looked up, his eyes met Charlie's and he could tell by the look on her face she knew something was off. She didn't mention it though, but he was pretty sure she would later on.
smart. Like I said, practical knowledge. The fact that she still uses Muggle stuff means that not only she values her family but also isn't afraid to show it. If she minded standing out, she wouldn't be walking around with it after what I guess would be about five years of living in the wizarding world. So she is happy to be authentic and hold on to her individuality. Again, Ravenclaw."
He quickly looked around the hallway  and he thought his heart stopped when he saw Dean passing them, heading down to the corner that Lucifer had just rounded. Sam knew his brother well enough to realize this meant war.
Dean guessed that was what had made him kiss him; he trusted Cas enough to know that, even if he didn't feel the same way, he wouldn't judge. He wouldn't expect anything. He would just find a way to calm Dean down, like he always did. Like he had.
Cas looked at him with a frown and he quickly added, "Don't get me wrong, probably good that you did. Things could've gotten out of hand real fast if you hadn't. But you shouldn't have risked Michael getting angry with you just to help me out."
To get in they had to push through groups of people dancing and talking everywhere and Sam wondered if Balthazar had invited the entire school.
When he left for his algebra class and sat down, one of the legs of his chair broke, making him fall to the ground again. When he went to the bathroom during the break, he noticed he didn't have toilet paper too late. When he wanted to wash his hands afterwards, the tap was broken and the water spouted right into his face and, of course, on his crotch. When he headed for the door to leave the bathroom, somebody just opened it, smashing it in his face.
He didn't really have a preference but smiled nonetheless and then joined the table with his new House mates.
"Everything," he simply answered. If he wanted Lucifer, really wanted him, he knew he would need the truth to convince Dean and his dad.
Cas got up from his hiding place and walked around to the passenger seat while Dean unlocked the door. As they drove out of the parking lot, he decided that he was just going to ignore all the family drama. He'd had plenty of that for one day. First Lucifer, now Michael and his bitches, why couldn't they just leave him alone?
Dean followed right behind and so did Michael, even though he still seemed a little dumbfounded at the fact that the brother he hated so much had built a club in the street he lived in just because of the irony it would lead to. Dean felt sorry for him and quickly patted him on the shoulder.
Suddenly Dean wondered how much food Chuck Shurley would need to feed all his children. He guessed it took more than just this bag. "Is that even enough?" he laughed.
"That sucks, man," Dean commented and Charlie petted him on the shoulder sympathetically. "So then what third-years are coming?"
"You never would've made that mistake," Sam said, shaking his head. "The moment Michael showed a red flag, you backed out."
"Are you alright?" the girl next to him snapped him out of his pondering. She was one of the Hogwarts students, seemed about his age and her long, brown hair was tied back in a ponytail.
Just when he thought he wouldn't be able to contain himself any longer, the bell rang and broke the tension between them. Sam reluctantly put a step back and Lucifer quickly looked away.
He caught a glimpse of the gentle side Lucifer only showed every so often, before it disappeared again. "Then take me."
She laughed and shook her head. And then she got an idea. She pressed her napkin into a ball and before there was anything Adam could do about it, she'd thrown it at the Shurley kids.
Sam laughed at that. "True." He sighed and felt a pinch of sadness. "I don't know though. It's different this time."
"You don't know what you're talking about," Michael snarled. "I would do everything for my family, anything to protect them and Lucifer endangered that!"
"You don't remember from last time that we're literally the worst actors to have ever been on TV? Plus, this isn't just something we can talk ourselves out of, these are fans that have been following Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki for years. They'll be asking questions we don't know the answers to and expecting things we know nothing about."
"Dean, what are you talking about?" Castiel asked and stopped him by putting a comforting hand on his shoulder. His blue eyes looked worried and his head was slightly tilted to the right.
Then something dawned on him and he quickly looked around, searching for the Trickster. It had to be him, there was no other way. He couldn't find the golden-haired boy though. Instead of wasting another second on him, he rushed over to Lucifer, carefully avoiding the marbles, to help him back up.
"Oh no, it's okay," Dean was quick to say, realizing how he'd probably just come across. "It's fine, really. I just get a little cranky when I'm hungry," he grinned.
They found out GISH was some international contest/scavenger hunt that Misha had invented. Even after scrolling through the website and reading articles about it, Sam and Dean still couldn't say what exactly it was about though. Seriously, there had been a campaign to save unicorns?
"Oh please, don't act like you wouldn't have done the exact same thing. I know you, Dean. You told me yourself you'd do anything for your father."
Not trusting his voice, Sam just looked at him apologetically. He could immediately see the disappointment in his brother's eyes, quickly followed by a look of pain and worry. For a moment Sam thought he was going to try to convince him anyways, but Dean just remained silent, gave him a slow nod and grasped the handle.
His friend let out a little laugh. "Dean, I know you mean well. I like that about you. But you don't know what you're talking about."
Sam shook his head furiously. All he wanted was for Gabriel to just shut up. "Why are you doing this?" he questioned. "Why do you care? This has got nothing to do with you, what does it matter?"
This time it took a bit longer for Cas to get back at him but Dean hadn't expected much else. He could basically hear the wheels in his friend's head turning from across the building, and rightly so. Dean had gotten him in enough trouble as it was, he would be hesitant too if he were Cas.
"It was fine," Sam answered and she couldn't help but laugh. They both knew he wasn't that into languages but it was Sam. There wasn't a thing in the world he didn't like to learn.
"Shut your cakehole. You don't know anything about my family," Gabriel snapped back at him. "This isn't about them. This is about Sam and Lucifer and how we're gonna stop it."
"Well, nothing I can do about it," Molly shrugged. "But back to you, do you two know each other well?"
"You pissed off the Shurleys, right? Maybe Michael or one of the others sent him after you? Or he decided to take revenge for Michael himself?"
They were quiet again, Dean not knowing what to say and Sam not in the mood to say anything at all. Dean could tell that much and he was willing to give Sammy all the space he needed but he was also a big brother. And his duty as a big brother was to make his little brother happy again.
"Oh, I think I've given Arthur Ketch plenty of chances if you ask me," John scoffed. They'd had this conversation a bazillion times before and yet... "Hold on a second, are you implying that the two of you are back together?"
Dean remained quiet for a couple of seconds, letting the words sink in. When he finally answered, he knew it was the truth. "No. I probably wouldn't. If he wanted to leave, I'd let him. Maybe even blame him for it. But Sammy is my little brother and I could never bare to shut him out. Let alone kick him out myself. No matter what Dad would've said, Sam would always be welcome to me. Always. 'Cause that's what you do for family." He took a deep breath. "But hey, it's not too late to make things right, is it?"
