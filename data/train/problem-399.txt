“Mind palace,” Sherlock says vaguely.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “Your payment.” Sherlock looks at him for just a moment before turning towards the door. He takes a deep breath and squares his shoulders, then raises his hand to knock on the door, only to have it pulled open before his hand can settle on the wood; instead it hovers for a moment before falling to rest at his side.
“Are you?” John asks, raising his eyebrows. His eyes darken and his tongue darts out to lick his lips, his eyes flickering down to Sherlock’s mouth.
, we’re here, aren’t we? Because you're brave, because you
John shrugs, chewing his food. “Not really,” he says once he’s swallowed. “I mean, they’re attracted to me, right?”
John frowns, eyes flickering between the two of them in suspicion. “Are you sure you don’t want me to come along?”
“That’s too tight!” Sherlock protests, ignoring Mycroft’s words and shoving at his hands; he’s eager to go steal a snack.
Greg laughs. “Thank me when you know why you’re thanking me,” he advises. “Oh, and before I forget, take this,” he adds. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small piece of folded black cloth. John takes it and unfolds it, and sees that it’s a bandana, all black with a white skull on it. He looks at it with a confused frown for a moment, and then looks up at Greg.
, but then the moment passes and the warmth of John’s body is gone and Sherlock is left alone, a curled up pile of skin and bones beneath the warmth and familiar smell of John’s blanket.
John remembers last time they met suddenly, and he manages a wet laugh. “I’m not,” he insists. “You don’t need to be upset.”
They’re quiet for a moment, and John feels a strange connection with the man after the serious topics they’ve strayed to. He hesitates, but slowly starts talking. “I know what it’s like to be lonely,” he says. “We all do, don’t we? Coming back to...to this.”
Sherlock holds tight to Dad’s hand when they step out of the Floo and Dad sets him down to walk on his own. He’s frozen in place, eyes wide, and Dad tugs on him and forces him forward, lest someone else come through and bump into him.
. Sherlock stands up like a shot, abandoning his pipe on the table and going to John’s side.
“Are you making
“We have no agreement,” Sherlock says sulkily.  The tone makes John smile, just a little.
“You should move in,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock swallows, and then clears his throat. He opens his mouth to speak, but finds that yet again he doesn’t know what to say, so he closes it again.
“Things like that,” Sherlock says, a bit awkwardly, letting the butterfly dissolve.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice soft. “I’m so, so sorry.”
“Thank you!” Billy says, and he sounds proud.
“Explain later,” Sherlock says. “You’re close. Have you told her I’m with Moriarty?”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “You know that my magic is restricted to granting wishes, for the most part, but I also have the rather unique ability to move through dimensions and help other people do so as well. Moriarty forced me to take us there and wait for you.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicker over John’s face, but he doesn’t look convinced. When he speaks, his voice is a calm murmur, but the urgency in his eyes betrays his tone. “Isn’t it a bit much to suddenly learn that your life expectancy has increased exponentially? And that you’re tied to me for the duration of it?”
“I’m fine,” she says without turning to look at him, and she leaves, closing the door fast behind her. He can hear the muffled sounds of crying through the door.
“What the fuck, Sherlock?” John asks, his mood abruptly darkening. He’s seen spirits like these before; some are large masses of smoke with one eye and no mouth, some are colorful blob-like creatures with no eyes and a large mouth, some are flying, some are walking. He feels his heart start to beat faster and his palms begin to sweat. He’s never seen so many spirits in one place, and while they are walking away from them and up the hill rather than running towards John as they’re usually wont to do, it’s not exactly comforting.
But John isn’t there. He blinks, staring at the space where John had been, and then he swivels, turning towards the door. There’s still a puddle where John’s umbrella had dripped, but the umbrella is gone, and so is John.
Sherlock shrugs, and chances a glance at John, a half-smile quirked on his lips. “Is it?”
“I’ll be here,” Arthur says. “But if you don’t feel well, don’t come. I won’t be offended. You should rest.”
“Fuck!” John says, his heart beating fast. He’s panicking in his haste to get to Sherlock, but he can’t help it. Redbeard breathes in and then John watches in horror as a wall of fire washes over his arm. He’s sure he’s about to die or at the very least lose a limb to severe burns, but the web disintegrates, falling away from his arm, and his skin remains cool and untouched. He stares for a moment, and then turns to Redbeard.
“Obviously,” Sherlock says. “What would be my purpose in lying?”
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Yes, well, there are times that call for owl post.”
“Is that water?” John asks curiously.
“It is?” John asks, brow furrowed.
He feels connected to his violin in a way he never has, and he’s so connected to the music that he doesn’t even realize a whole day has passed, doesn’t realize where he is or what he’s doing, only feels an energy he didn’t remember he could have buzzing through his veins, singing inside of him. He plays with everything inside of him, with his whole body, with his whole
He needs to talk to Sherlock about this, he realizes, adrenaline washing over him. He swings his legs over the side of his bed, still holding the bag in his hand, and he takes a moment, despite his need for answers, to rub his thumb over the very tangible, very real bag. He tries to make sense of his night as Redbeard comes awake, making a soft squeak of contentment. Redbeard stretches his little body out, pulling himself taut before relaxing and coiling back around John’s neck. He kisses John’s neck, as usual, and then settles down to stay curled up next to his pulse; he’s been extra vigilant since John met Arthur. John makes his way down the stairs and absently reaches up to stroke Redbeard’s head with his free hand, still holding the cigarettes in the other and frowning in thought.
John groans. This is terrible.
“To what?” John asks defiantly. He’s trying to ignore the way the air seems to shift around them as Sherlock’s finger rests against his jaw, but he finds it difficult.
And then, the absurdity of it all catches up to him and helpless giggles bubble up his throat. After a moment, Sherlock giggles with him, and John remembers precisely why he fought so hard to keep Sherlock alive in the first place. They’re side by side laughing, and then they sneak a glance at each other and only laugh harder. John shifts on the couch, moving until he’s close to Sherlock, and after a moment, when their laughter has settled, he reaches up and carefully cups Sherlock’s face with his hand, his eyes still sparkling with laughter, the ghost of his smile still lingering on his face. Sherlock leans into the touch, his eyes drifting half-closed as he stares at John.
Suddenly, he stops, though, because his anger is quickly overrun by awe. They have reached the top of the hill, and when John looks down, he can barely process what he sees. His breath leaves him in a surprised whoosh. Ahead of them, for as far as his eye can see, are hundreds, if not
“Something wrong?” John asks.
John knows there’s nothing he can do without her, and so he nods, watching her through guarded eyes as she steps forward.  His eyes shift to her hand, which she’s threaded through the crook of his elbow, and then back up to her face.  She smiles at him, a tremulous smile, as the wind suddenly picks up.  She steps forward and John can do nothing but follow, but when his foot lands, it’s on pavement, and he’s alone.
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. “Yeah, but it’s a big black stain on your magic, don’t you want it gone? You don’t need that, your magic is nice, John.”
“Cold,” Sherlock says.
John blinks, unsure of Sherlock’s tone, unsure of the small smile on his face. “I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or an insult,” he admits, his own voice softer, his eyes locked on Sherlock’s. Something seems to be threading between them, some kind of intimacy that settles over John’s skin like the warmth of the sunlight above them.
,” Sherlock gushes. “Do you have your own room, too?”
“Don’t take it off!” he yells, but his voice is lost to the sounds of traffic and the man twists at the ring for a moment before yanking it off his finger. The smoke curls out faster than ever, uncontained by the strange ring Sherlock had given him, and John watches as the man’s eyes widen in fear. He seems unable to move his body. He’s jerking a little bit in his attempts to move, but he remains rooted to the spot in the middle of the crosswalk as traffic begins again in the other direction.
Sherlock turns to him and arches a brow. “What is it?” he asks.
“I have a few regularly scheduled potions deliveries, and they always owl ahead to confirm,” Sherlock tells him, going back to his chair. “Is that so shocking?”
John smiles at him. “Tomorrow,” he says. “I could… believe it or not, I’d like a moment to take it in that you’re going to fix it, anyway,” he admits. “Is that… alright?”
“Why is it ever daytime?” Sherlock asks, grinning at John.
“John,” he says, looking up, offering a smile. “Shouldn’t you be at home with Mary?”
Sherlock can feel his eyes on him, so he looks up from his notes. “What?” he says. “Why are you staring at me?”
John comes home from work early. His last few patients have canceled, and he can’t stand the way everyone there
“John,” Sherlock says, pulling away. He tugs on John’s shirt and John lets him, helps him get it over his head, and then they’re kissing again, the bare skin of their chests finally pressing together. It’s exhilarating and John finds himself kissing harder, pressing his tongue, warm and slick, against Sherlock’s. The feeling is exquisite; he feels it down to his bones and he’s eager for more. Breathy noises come from his throat he’s not even conscious of making.
crowding his mind, thoughts he doesn't like to examine, and he’d only meant to lie down for a moment, to rest, to try to turn off the world for a while, but now he is suddenly aware of the sounds of John in the apartment. He feels a strange sense of shame wash over him because he hadn’t even heard him come up the stairs, and he hadn’t meant for John to find him like this; he’d only meant to rest, but he’d gotten stuck inside his own head and he’d lost track of time and suddenly he’s aware of John’s footsteps in the flat, of John hanging up his coat, of John stepping into the sitting room and stopping awkwardly, and he feels exposed in a strange way he doesn’t understand. He never used to feel this way if John found him like this, but everything is different now, in ways he can’t fathom.
To his surprise, though, John closes his eyes and laughs, shaking his head, swiping at his eyes. Sherlock is left standing in the middle of the sitting room, wringing his hands, staring at John. John smiles at him, and his eyes are suspiciously shiny.
John looks at him in disbelief.  “Aren’t you his archenemy?  Why is he sending his archenemy to meet me?”
Sherlock pulls away after a moment, but he doesn’t go far; he keeps their faces close together, so close John can feel his breath, warm against his own lips.
John’s jaw drops a bit, and he just stares at Sherlock for a moment. “You’re a bloody-”
“It’s really a brilliant bit of magic,” John says.
“I was going to make some, anyway,” John says, but he’s still looking at Sherlock in a way that makes him unsure and uncomfortable.
?” John asks.
Carefully, he reaches out and holds the glowing thing that was once a cupcake over Sherlock’s chest.  He doesn’t want to let go; it seems far too precious for that, but he takes a deep breath, holds it in for a moment, and lets go.  The cupcake drops into Sherlock’s chest, and much like the woman’s hand had done before, it vanishes into his skin.  It’s anticlimactic in how easy it is, but John’s heat is pounding nonetheless.
John wants to ask, but he knows that he is on edge and frazzled, out of his element and worried. “But he could be anywhere,” John protests. “I have to find him. I don’t have time to waste; he could be hurt –”
“That was a mountain?” John asks in surprise.
On Saturday morning, Sherlock emerges from his room with a yawn, scratching his stomach through his thin t-shirt and shuffling into the kitchen. He freezes when he sees John sitting at the table with the paper; somehow, he’d forgotten John would be there, and he feels exposed in his t-shirt and thin pyjama bottoms.
friends,” Sherlock corrects. “She has a problem
. He’s tried
Sherlock’s overly aware of the sound of his footsteps as he walks towards the hallway, of the sound of John behind him, of John’s breath, of what’s about to happen, but he pushes the anxiety that is trying to rise inside of him down and stops in front of a familiar, blank stretch of wall in the hallway. He closes his eyes and takes a deep, shaky, determined breath before moving his hand in a complicated pattern, visualizing the magic in his mind and manipulating it with his hand. The door appears, which he carefully reaches out and opens, only hesitating for a moment. He takes another deep breath and steps inside, gesturing for John to enter.
But John’s face is open, his eyes warm. “Do you think
“A bit, yeah.”
“Yeah?” John asks. He seems amused.
“He says you don’t know his first name,” John says, the memory coming to him unbidden.
Almost of its own volition, his hand creeps up to touch her little fingers. They’re impossibly small, like scale models of a human’s. He finds it absurd that there are so many things he wants to know about her and yet he can’t stop staring at her hands, smoothing his finger over the little wrinkles and miniscule nails.
He’s breaking, he’s sure of it, and he’s asking for things he knows he’s not capable of receiving, but he feels selfish, and when John’s lips touch his again, and John is there, there in ways Sherlock has never thought possible, present in heart and body and mind, his lips part against Sherlock’s and Sherlock clutches John’s jumper, pulling him closer.
“Tell me everything,” Sherlock says. He puts his hands on John’s shoulders, the little bag pressed between John’s shoulder and Sherlock’s palm, and stares at him intently. “Start from the beginning and don’t leave a single thing out.”
not,” he says. “Don’t be an idiot.”
Mrs. Hudson comes back down the hall, smiling warmly. “A wish-granting shop,” she repeats, taking one cup of tea off the tray and handing it to Sherlock.   “As long as it’s something Sherlock can do, he’ll grant the wish. Do sit down, dear, your tea will get cold,” she says to John, gesturing towards the chair he’d sat in a few moments before. Even though he’s not sure he wants to stay, John sits again, inexplicably drawn to this strange situation, and he takes the tea she hands him. She smiles and pats his shoulder, but it doesn’t do anything to make him feel more comfortable.
“I told you you let him play too much,” Mycroft says, and Sherlock swivels his head to glare at him; he hadn’t even noticed his presence in his distress. “He could be smart, but you let him run wild. Just look at him; he really believes this happened.”
, he tells himself. He takes a step forward, and then another, moving cautiously. His steps are loud, dry branches crackling under his feet, and he can hear his heartbeat thumping in his hears.
Sherlock’s looking at the hydrangea rather than John.  “You’re marginally clever, John; think.”
“It takes a lot of energy for him to transform like that, so he doesn’t do it often,” Sherlock says. He gestures to the pillow on John’s chair, where Redbeard is curled up and sleeping. “He’ll rest for a while to recover. I told you he’s very special. Mycroft used to tell me I let him transform too much when I was little. It’s why he took him away.”
“You’ve noticed,” Sherlock says, looking at her more attentively than before. He leans back and takes a sip of his coffee, then sets the cup down. “My flat is a shop for granting wishes. The shop is neither here nor there; it exists, and yet it doesn’t. To put it plainly, only those that have a need for it can enter.”
Grateful for her assistance, John follows her to the door, and together, they leave her cabin. The sounds of the door snicking closed and their footsteps on the stone path seem louder than usual; John’s adrenaline is already heightened. They follow the path back to where the lake lies, calm and placid in the afternoon sun. John relishes the sharp sounds of insects buzzing through the air, focuses on the sensation of a warm breeze ruffling his hair. Across the clearing, he sees the spot where he’d gone with Sherlock to arrive at Mycroft’s house, but they don’t go that way. Instead, they head past the lake and walk through the soft grass without talking, following the edge of the forest.
John feels a sob rise in his chest, and he watches as Sherlock pulls his arm back, taking deadly aim, before releasing it, a shower of golden sparks flying out from where the arrow would normally lie. John closes his eyes, braces himself, but before he can register what happens, Arthur steps in front of him, taking the arrow in the chest.
When they get back to Baker Street, Sherlock suggests another drink. He takes another bottle of wine from the fridge, grabs his long pipe, and tells John to bring the glasses and follow him. John is surprised when Sherlock heads towards John’s bedroom, and once inside, he throws the window open and climbs out onto the fire escape. He heads up the stairs and gestures for John to follow.
can’t disappear; it’s physically impossible for Sherlock to kill you,” Mycroft says.
John frowns.  “Are you lost?” he asks.  “Do you know where your house is?”  It occurs to him that her house can’t be here, but that doesn’t seem important now.  He pushes the thought aside, focusing on the distress of the little girl in front of him.
Sherlock nods. “Only because you can’t reach,” he says.
Sherlock smiles and holds his hand out towards John, Redbeard draped over his fingers. John automatically reaches out for him, and Redbeard bridges the distance between their hands.
“I’d think you’d be pleased,” Sherlock says. He still doesn’t turn around, and his voice is polite and controlled.
Sherlock reaches for him and pulls his head down for a kiss, startling John at first, but John melts into it easily, opening his mouth, their tongues sloppily pressing together, and then John shifts his hips, settling deeper into Sherlock.
“I think I’ll manage,” John says, and he must be imagining the way the skull somehow looks disappointed.
and so I can’t help but love her.” He clears his throat, wills himself to keep going. “I always thought I ruined everything we had, but she’s just a blank slate and when I see her, she makes me think maybe there’s a chance and I want to-“
He holds his breath and listens, his heart beating so loud in his ears he can barely make out the sounds he hears, but when he concentrates, he realizes that he hears very familiar voices. Before he even decides to do it, he’s throwing the duvet off of himself and standing on shaky legs clad in his own familiar, worn pajamas, adrenaline making up for his exhaustion and lack of strength.
“Of course, dear, I was just going downstairs, anyway,” she says. John can’t help but think she’s rather agreeable. But then, isn’t he, as well?
Sherlock shakes his head. “You’ve done so much more than that,” he says.
Sherlock breaks the kiss, though, and groans, his head tilting back, his chest heaving, pushing John up for a moment.  “Wait, wait – “
Sherlock ignores him, idly pulling on the lever and making his nutcracker’s mouth open and close. “Do we have any nuts? I could open one,” he says.
can’t kill you,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock leans forward, buries his face into John’s neck, wraps his arms around John’s back and pulls him close in a hug, feels John’s hands tightening on him. “Happy Christmas,” he says, warm and surrounded by John and, for the first time since he’s been nine years old, incandescently happy.
He wonders if Sherlock can really help him, if there can really be an end to this, when he hears a conversation nearby. It’s a girl, university age, talking to her friends.
It’s Mycroft, and John is flooded with relief that someone besides him is here and whole, but at the same time, his desperation is peaking and he finds that his confusing emotions are coalescing into a physical, visceral urge to punch him, though he knows it’s irrational. “Where is he?” John demands, his hands clenched at his sides, his voice strangled, his eyes intent. “Dammit, Mycroft, do you know where he is?”
“Wait, Lestrade’s dead?” John asks, brow furrowed.
John hears fragments of the spirits’ voices like he’s in a nightmare.
Warmth spreads from Sherlock’s stomach to his fingertips. He shifts closer to John and lowers his head, lets his lips part, and closes his eyes in lieu of answering, and then John’s lips are there, pressing against his, open and warm and inviting. It starts soft and gentle, short tender kisses, but Sherlock feels a longing unfurl deep in his stomach that he can’t control and his hands pull John tighter and then the kisses are growing longer and more desperate.
It’s so clear to him now, and it leaves his heart pounding because it
“I don’t need you here,” Sherlock mumbles into his pillow. He feels a tear rolling over his nose, dripping down to pool on his pillow. “Why don’t you go back to school now?”
Compared to the surge of spirits and ghosts he knows he’ll face if he leaves, he thinks indulging in this strange man’s conversation seems favorable, and so he takes a step forward as he puts his hand in his pocket, fingers curling around the cold metal of the dog tags that lie inside.
Sherlock glances towards the familiar paper and nods, his expression hard to read.
John’s still stroking his face, and for some inexplicable reason, it makes Sherlock’s emotions rise to the surface, and he closes his eyes, his breath leaving him in a shaky exhale. John shifts again and kisses him, soft and gentle. Their chests brush and Sherlock’s mouth opens into the kiss, John’s breath warm and humid against his lips.
Then Sherlock is back, and Mrs. Hudson withdraws her hand. John opens his watery eyes and looks at Sherlock. Sherlock is blurry, but he is magnificent. He’s standing tall, and something in his eyes seems to have shifted. His dressing gown is tied tight, somehow appearing to be a powerful and imposing robe rather than the lazy attire it really is. He’s holding a small piece of paper in his hands with writing on it that John can’t make out.
Again he stops, frustrated, and looks away from John, closing his eyes in annoyance. How do people
“Starving,” John says.
. He watches as her chest rises and falls with each breath. Her little John-shaped nose resting atop her shiny, parted lips takes the forefront of Sherlock’s mind, and the familiar sounds of John moving around upstairs fall away for a moment as he takes in everything about her that he can. His mind spins fast, imagining what she’ll be like when she’s older, how tall she’ll be, the shape of her face – of course he can’t
“It’s not much,” Sherlock says, gesturing towards his messy sitting room.
me anything–”
John pulls away after a moment, and he holds Sherlock’s face in his hands, resting his forehead against Sherlock’s.
“Why do you need a job?” Sherlock asks. Judging by the furrow of his brow and the small frown on his face, he is genuinely confused. “You have one.”
, and it isn’t right. He waves his hand and sends a book thumping into the wall, but it doesn’t satisfy him. He’s so caught up in his own whirlwind of frustration that he doesn't notice John come inside until the stench of stale St. Mungo’s magic hits him, and he turns towards John, hands on his hips, angry, nostrils flared.
Sherlock smiles at him. It’s a small, soft smile, and John’s heart skips a beat. “The cost of my wish was my life, but more specifically, it was my presence in your world. Moriarty took it; he removed me from your world. That doesn’t mean I can’t be brought back.
The fox-boy nods eagerly, his tail twitching, and John nods at Sherlock. Together, they turn and walk towards the tree. The monsters are watching them go, but they fade out of John’s focus, turning into a background blur of colors and shapes. The only thing he can focus on is the tree ahead of them, Sherlock’s fingers woven into his, the rough feel of the handle beneath their hands.
he can’t, even as they take a step back from the tree and turn around to face the spirits again.
He’d meant to pick her up and analyze her, memorize her, and yet he thinks he has drastically misjudged what a factor sentiment would play in this moment, and he thinks that’s always the problem with anything to do with John. Instead, he finds himself staring at her, smiling a small smile when her tiny fingers curl around one of his. He knows it’s just a meaningless action, something all babies do, but it feels special somehow, and his heart flutters in his chest.
John lets out an involuntary groan, a breathy helpless sort of sound, worn with sleep but heartfelt just the same, and he tightens his fingers in Sherlock’s hair.
Suddenly, though, a loud whistling fills the kitchen and they break apart, hearts beating fast, breath coming in shaky gasps. They share a moment of charged, shocked eye contact before John blinks, then remembers the tea, and steps away for a moment to turn the heat off and stop the whistling. His body feels shaky and cold in Sherlock’s absence, and the world feels like it’s shifting around him. The kitchen feels foreign with this newly awakened
,” Uncle Augustus says, and Sherlock nods eagerly, looking up at Daddy with imploring eyes. Mycroft and Mummy gather behind them, and so do many other relatives, and so Daddy relents, though the smile he gives Sherlock is the one that means Sherlock would have gotten his way anyway, and Sherlock smiles, excitement rushing through him.
Sherlock smiles.  “As usual, John, you show that you are not a complete idiot.”
“Yes, it has,” she says, then turns toward John. She frowns for a moment and takes a step towards him. “Oh, you’ve certainly got a lot to worry about, don't you? With so many…
“I do,” Sherlock says immediately.   “I do, I do, it’s – it’s – please, John - ”
A sharp, loud cry interrupts them a few moments later, and Sherlock is startled into a laugh against John’s neck. If it’s a slightly wet laugh, neither of them acknowledges it, and when he brings his head up to look at John, neither of them acknowledges the redness of John’s eyes, either. Instead, they kiss once more, soft and gentle, and John cups his face and sweeps his thumbs along Sherlock’s cheekbones, presses a kiss against the corner of his mouth, one more soft and lingering on his cheek, one more just below his ear, one more on his temple, until Iris’ cries really can’t be ignored.
“Oh,” John says, wondering if perhaps there was something more to their relationship than he suspected. He frowns, wondering why that thought seems to bother him.
“Alright?” John asks again, still looking up at Sherlock with a warm smile.
John is quiet. He looks away, fiddles with his wine glass for a moment, and then looks back up.
“Same,” John says, leading them through the crowd until they finally manage to reach the door of the athletic center and make their way to the southeast corner.  “Of course, it’s not a surprise that Sherlock’s bloody brilliant at it,” he adds.
“Anytime, mate! I may miss drinking, but I certainly don’t miss the hangovers,” he continues. “You two look right miserable.”
“Moriarty – he’s really gone?” he asks after a moment.
Sherlock swallows. “I – I can’t,” he says. His voice is softer than he’d expected, and there’s a tremor to it he’s unaccustomed to hearing.
“Right, of course, no one can ever just bloody
Tenderly, he picks up his nutcracker, making sure the handkerchief is still fastened tight around his arm. He admires the nutcracker once more, running his fingers over his proud red coat, over his glimmering gold buttons and handsome black boots.
he would ever make in his life but he can’t stop them, can’t stop this, can’t stop the spiral of pleasure starting at the base of his spine and spreading over his body and then his hips are jerking even though John’s trying to hold them down and his legs tremble and spasm and he’s coming, hard, into the wet heat of John’s mouth and John isn’t picking his head up, he’s not pulling away, and it makes Sherlock moan helplessly and thrust up into John’s mouth and come harder, his legs jerking out, his head thrown back, until finally,
“Alright?” John asks, straightening and turning to face him.
Sherlock blinks again, taken aback. He doesn't know why everything John says and does manages to surprise him, but it does.
may have met someone.”
“Sherlock, Christ, mmm,” John says.  He’s never good with words in the morning, and Sherlock feels a smile curl at his lips around John’s nipple.  John’s fingers work their way into his curls again, and Sherlock can’t help but let out a pleased exhale, and John shivers.  Sherlock kisses his chest again, then lets his teeth tease against John’s nipple.  He knows John loves this, and he does, too; he loves anything that allows him to taste John, to know the feel of him on his tongue, to feel his cock harden, to hear his breaths quicken and feel his pulse elevate.
“It’s just a curse,” Sherlock says. “It’s like a knot.”
hear this, but somehow, he’s replying, his words a broken whisper in the living room. “You weren’t there,” he manages, the choked words thick in the air between them. “I – every day I wanted to see you, I talked to you, I imagined you, but you weren’t
“’Course not,” John says. “But, you know, it’s been this way a long time,” he adds. “It’s a bit – I’ve grown used to it. It’s a bit strange to think of being without it.”
They’re silent for a moment, and John lets his eyes fall closed, lets his head fall back against the couch.
John’s hands are trembling, but he manages to shake her shoulder nonetheless, her bones frail under his hands. She doesn’t respond, and he shakes harder. “Mrs. Hudson, please,
“Not good,” John supplies for him, a bite in his words.
, and Sherlock needs to end this right now. He’s already lost John once, and he doesn’t think he can bear to lose him again, but in the current state of things, he knows he can’t keep him – not when he’s
“Wishes?” the man asks, his brow furrowed. “Are you some kind of freak?”
Sherlock nods, eyes still trained on his new nutcracker. He doesn’t know why, but it
Sherlock blinks, remembering what he’d said in the beginning of the conversation, and distractedly rattles off his deductions, eager to get back to John’s story, but John looks at him with wide eyes, his lips parted. “
Sherlock gives a pitiful groan. “Where?”
“I’d like to think I wasn’t incompetent.”
John gives a weary half-smile before he turns back to awkwardly pull out a diaper bag with one arm, and then the cabbie comes around, popping open the boot of the taxi. Sherlock goes to the boot and slings John’s bag over his shoulder and takes hold of the suitcase, the cabbie slams the boot, and then it’s just John and Sherlock standing on the pavement outside 221B, staring at each other with words overflowing their brains but none on their tongues.
“John,” Sherlock interrupts. “Do you feel cold?”
“Er, thanks,” John says. “You’re not – “
“You just woke up, Sherlock; it was a dream.”
“That’s… well…”   He pauses and clears his throat. “Nevertheless, Mummy called in Healers at least once a week, sometimes more. One of them said that I have a rare disorder that sometimes shows up in pureblood families that no one ever talks about because purebloods generally like to pretend they’re
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “You used cleaning charms on your room, but you put your clothes away without any magic, and you’re sick of wizarding society. Very few wizards from magic families would act that way,” he says without thinking.
Sherlock smiles and takes a step forward, taking her by the shoulders and kissing her cheek. She blushes, her fair skin turning pink as soon as he’s close to her. “Of course, Molly,” he says. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?”
“Brilliant,” John murmurs, low and tender. “You’re always so brilliant, love, that’s it, you’re alright, now.” The words are nonsense, but they curl into Sherlock’s ear like bliss and he unwraps one arm from around his leg, curls it around John’s and presses closer, turns his head just a little bit, nuzzles the length of his nose against John’s trousers. He doesn’t feel like he has control over his actions; he feels as if he is floating on a cloud, as if the only thing that’s real is John’s voice and John’s fingers and John’s leg.
“Hi!” John says cheerfully. “This is Sherlock!”
Sherlock sets Billy down on the kitchen table and then takes a cigarette out of the little bag as John turns to watch, waiting for his coffee to brew. Sherlock holds it up towards the kitchen light and examines it in the light, then hums in curiosity. He turns it over and inspects it from all angles before bringing it up to his nose and sniffing, closing his eyes as he takes in the smell. John watches in confusion until Sherlock looks up at him, pointing at him with the cigarette.
it’s alright, it’s perfect,” John says. “Where did you even-”
Mrs. Hudson holds the door open for John, watching him with trepidation.  John sighs and looks around the closet, rubbing his forehead.  He sees a tote bag nearby, hanging amongst some of Sherlock’s clothes, and he takes it, shoving Billy inside with a look of apology; he may need his hands.  Mrs. Hudson reaches out and pats his arm as he crosses the threshold, and he nods at her, his jaw set and his shoulders square.
There’s no answer, though, so he frowns and rings the bell again.  There aren’t any lights on inside, which isn’t encouraging.  Nevertheless, he stands still for a moment and waits, hoping she’ll come to the door, but there’s no movement.  His shoulders fall a bit and he feels disappointed and unaccountably embarrassed.  Discouraged, he turns around, but gasps and startles backward when there’s a familiar tall man standing directly behind him.
“I understand perfectly well,” Sherlock says, and John looks up again to see Sherlock holding his bow, poised to shoot at the man. There’s no arrow in it, but for some reason, that doesn’t seem to matter.
“Job?” Sherlock asks.
John frowns, taken aback by Sherlock’s sudden intensity. “Why would I do something stupid?”
John and Sherlock meet an unusual woman in the park who puts Sherlock's life in danger.  John has to find a way to save him.
“Thank you!” the boy says in an ecstatic rush, reaching out and taking it from John.  He just looks at it for a moment, his eyes bright, and then runs off to a small chest of drawers in the back of the cart.
John nods, wondering why Sherlock is talking about this
Baker Street up ahead. He longs to go inside the flat, to reach the door and send this spirit away. He breaks into a run, but the spirit on his back doesn’t like it. It tugs at him and tries to pull him back, but John fights. Suddenly, though, he feels a stabbing pain close to his neck where the tip of one of the spirit’s fangs has punctured his skin.
He’s aware of too many things; the subtle heaviness of impending rain that hangs in the air around him, the sounds of the light mid-morning traffic, the footfalls of the heavyset security guard walking out of Speedy’s and the scent of fried food that wafts out the door as he leaves – but then John steps out of the taxi and Sherlock’s focus sharpens. John leans down to pull out the car seat, exposing the wrinkles on the back of his coat and his rumpled collar and the slight protrusion of his pocket and Sherlock’s mind is overflowing with deductions.
“She doesn’t have a problem
“Daddy must have come back in to get him,” she says.
Sherlock opens his eyes and looks at John. From this close, John can count Sherlock’s eyelashes, can see every speck of color in his eyes, every pore in his skin. It’s mesmerizing, it really is.
It’s pouring outside, and John holds his umbrella as close to his head as possible, hunching his shoulders to become as small as possible underneath it, his sodden grocery bag dripping onto his already wet feet. He’s on his way home from work – he still hasn’t mustered up the energy to quit his job – and he has stopped at the grocery store, knowing they have very little to eat in the flat.
Sherlock sighs. “Honestly, John, I don’t sulk, and I don’t sit here waiting for you to come home. I am quite busy. It’s obvious Mary went to Brighton alone because she’s estranged from her family and she has difficulty keeping friends. It’s not a hard leap to make.”
Just like the last time, though, Mrs. Hudson opens the door before he has the chance, smiling at him. “Oh, hello dear. It’s lovely to see you again! Go on up, then, I’ll bring some tea. Sherlock’s in a bit of a strop, though, I should warn you,” she says, patting John’s shoulder and then bustling off to 221A.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have been since the moment I met you,” Sherlock says. “Only I didn’t realize it until it was too late. I’m not…” He pauses, clears his throat, leans into John’s touch when John lets his thumbs mirror the motions of Sherlock’s on his cheekbones. “I’m not good at this sort of thing.” He feels undone and vulnerable, held up only by the feeling of John’s fingers on his head, even though he knows that’s physically impossible. He feels jittery and calm all at once, and he swallows nervously, taking in the way the bedside lamp casts small shadows over the expressive planes of John’s face.
“Oh, you’re so
John feels fear churning in his stomach, fear he can’t welcome. Terror wells inside of him and he realizes that Moriarty may be telling the truth. There had been no door, had there? He’d come through the lake. Does that count as a connection to Sherlock’s closet?
“No,” Mycroft says. “No, he’s not.”
Sherlock sluggishly blinks his eyes when he hears the old grandfather clock in the ballroom striking loudly. He sits up, rubbing his eyes, and sees that it’s midnight, but just as he looks away from the clock, he notices that the Christmas tree is getting very big – or maybe he is getting very small?
“His soul?” John asks.  “It was just the cupcake I made.”
John’s lips settle into a firm line, and he crosses his arms over his chest. “You - you’re the one who told me how important it is to live,” he says. “And now you do this? How
“But I –”
Sherlock steps back and his hands fall to his side again, but then, after just a moment of hesitation, he takes John’s hand and pulls him over to the little ledge where John always sat with Greg. He sits, and John sits beside him.
“It’s
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. “Only you.”
“Of course I would have done,” John says immediately, his voice raw, stunned by how sure he is of his answer as the possibilities of a life without Sherlock bloom in his mind, possibilities that have recently seemed all too real.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Sherlock says sharply. He slings his bow over his shoulder and approaches John, helps him sit on the bench for a moment. “It was my decision to make, and I made it.”
as of late?” Sherlock questions.
Sherlock nods and John looks between them helplessly.  “Sorry,” he says again.  “I don’t-”
“Because it’s true.
“How will thinking help me?” he asks desperately. “He’s not – he could be
“Yeah, I’m not an idiot, you know,” John says.
, what you’ve done -” John says, but he stops, and Sherlock opens his eyes. John’s eyes are right there, blurry as they are through the tears that won’t seem to stop, and they’re staring into his own. “Thank you,” John murmurs. “Thank you so much. You’ve saved me so many times.”
“Sherlock, what-”
“Nowhere fun,” Billy chimes in.
“Lestrade gave you this?” Sherlock asks, looking up at John with an unreadable expression.
“Yes, but I’ve met a lot of incompetent Aurors,” Sherlock says.
“We just talked a bit, really,” John continues. “He told me you used to chase Mycroft around when you were little and Mycroft made it rain on you.” He grins a little, wishing he could see a picture of Sherlock at that age.
to, really, it was weird…” He trails off, unsure, and Sherlock smiles, leading him into the living room.
“When I met you-“ John starts speaking, but he pauses and breathes loudly through his nose again, looking away from Sherlock and clenching his left fist. “When I met you, you gave me a new life. And when you – when you
“Ah,” John repeats. “What do you mean, ‘
It’s the first time John’s been in Sherlock’s room, and he’s not surprised that the man’s bed is luxurious, large and inviting with sheets that look more expensive than John’s entire wardrobe, but Sherlock goes straight to his closet and opens the door.
“Mm, okay,” John says, and lets her.
“I’m finished,” Sherlock says, being sure to soften his tone so he doesn’t sound angry. He’s not, anyway. He feels a weight in his chest that he doesn’t understand, a sadness pulling at him that he can’t shake.
“What about her?” John asks, annoyed.
“One hundred and ten,” Sherlock says. “I was born in the other world, the world where Mycroft lives. When I was young, I lived there, but we had a house here, too. Our parents – they wanted us to experience both worlds; the spirit world, and the mortal one.”
But when John speaks, it’s warm, understanding. “Sherlock,” he murmurs, his hand still secure over Sherlock’s.
“Now’s a bit different, isn’t it?” John says, a small smile on his face and his pulse inexplicably quickening.
His heart is beating fast and he holds Iris close, setting the phone on the table. He thinks suddenly of Mycroft, warning him of the dangers of sentiment. He rubs a thoughtful hand over the back of Iris’ head and wonders what exactly he thinks he’s doing, playing house like this.
John smiles at him tiredly. “I couldn’t help it,” he says. “I’m lonely, too. I like seeing you. I feel better when I see you. It’s like having a family, isn’t it?”
, though, unsure about Sherlock’s reaction at the crime scene.
Sherlock smiles at him. It’s gentle, so gentle, and John feels his heart speed up. “John,” he says. “When I wished for you to live, I was thirty-two years old, and I’ve stayed thirty-two in every way that matters since then.”
John swallows. This is a dangerous Sherlock.
, and John frowns.
it is because there’s no way he could have ever imagined the tantalizingly sharp pleasure of John’s bare chest sliding against his, of John’s mouth trailing down his throat, of lying down on his bed while John crawls up his body with a look in his eyes that makes Sherlock’s heart beat high and fast in his chest. There’s no way he could have imagined the way his hands grip John’s back with desperation, or the
“Make it quick,” Sherlock says, still avoiding eye contact.  “I’m hungry.  I want Angelo’s.”
“Er, you… you weren’t at Hogwarts, were you?” John asks, pulling him out of his analysis. “Only, we seem to be about the same age, and I’m sure I would have remembered you.”
about how you’re not the only wish granter.”
“What were you expecting?” Sherlock asks, dropping inelegantly onto Mycroft’s overstuffed floral print couch, a bored expression on his face.
John shrugs and finds himself laughing. “To be honest, I'm pretty sure at least 90% of today was a dream,” he says. “None of this makes any sense.”
“And then I just lived my life,” John continues.   “And I – wait, hang on, how’d you know about Afghanistan?” John says.
Sherlock feels a flush of something uncomfortable, but ignores it, awkwardly eyeing the mess his sitting room has become. He’ll have to tidy, he thinks.
“That doesn’t
“Of course she is,” Sherlock says. “We all are. You killed Moriarty.”
“Nice that somebody here thinks about what I want once in a while,” Billy says pointedly.
“He’s
“Yeah, don’t throw Billy,” John says, taking a sip of tea. “It’s not on.”
“I’d love some,” Mary says. Sherlock merely inclines his head in agreement, and John sighs, pouring out three glasses of wine.
inadvisable, especially to enemies. Your name is the path to your soul. Your birthday is the path to your past and future.”
“You liked the case,” Sherlock says, his words just a little bit slurred. He doesn’t usually drink a lot, and he’s feeling quite warm and pleasant.
“I can hear you,” he calls back to them.  He shakes his head.  The payment for this job better be good.
.” Moriarty pauses, drumming his fingers along the arm of his chair as he stares at John with a small, smug smile. “Have you liked this little game so far? I can’t imagine why Sherlock has been so obsessed with you for so long, but it
, you’re the one who told me how important my choices are – I choose
John doesn’t really understand, but he nods weakly, trusting that Mycroft knows what’s best.
let alone
“I don’t care,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock turns over drowsily, letting his arm stretch out over the warm spot where John had just been as John tugs on a dressing gown and ties it round his waist. Sherlock watches with half-closed eyes and smiles when he notices it’s his own, the sleeves dragging past John’s wrists. John bustles out of the room and Sherlock listens to the sounds of Iris’ crying, squinting blearily at the monitor on the nightstand and watching as John goes in and pulls her up out of the crib, cuddling her close and kissing her, then changing her diaper and talking nonsense to her as she continues to scream. Sherlock lets his eyes close and he listens to the sounds of John descending the stairs and then rummaging in the kitchen, Iris still crying, and he is surprised when after a few moments, John’s footsteps come back to the bedroom.
John frowns. “Where will you go? I’ll miss you, you know.”
John’s never imagined Sherlock as a child before; he’s never imagined him as anything other than what he is now. The idea of a mini Sherlock running and playing has honestly never occurred to him. He looks down for a moment, a small smile playing on his lips. He’s intrigued by this small glimpse into Sherlock’s world, this small facet of information that somehow makes him more human even in its absurdity. He files it away for later, and focuses back on Greg.
Sherlock smiles again, and it’s tinged with a sort of melancholy John doesn’t understand. “You’ll see,” he says.
to be exceptionally strong, don’t you see? It’s fate.”
I hope you enjoyed this part!  I'm sorry about the delay for this chapter; it's quite unusual for me and won't happen again, but I had some difficult RL circumstances last week.  But things should be back to normal now!  Also, the past few chapters have been a lot of world-building, but a lot of the bigger plot points will start kicking in soon, so get ready. :)  Thanks for reading!  As usual, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the story!
The sound is scratchy and unfamiliar, a mere shadow of the pure, expressive, effortless sound he used to produce. He sighs and tries again, trying to be patient. His nose wrinkles in distaste as he plays a few notes in first position, the sound unfamiliar and strange, his fingers no longer accustomed to the bite of the strings beneath them.
“I think I can guess, yeah,” she says. She smiles, warm and inviting, and Sherlock kisses her again, soft, warm, sweet, but this time with an undercurrent of desire, and then John’s fingers are woven into her hair and she gently pulls Sherlock’s head lower, deepening the kiss, and just as Sherlock settles into the way desire is pooling, molten, in the pit of her stomach, John pulls away, keeps their lips close enough that she can feel the warmth of her breath, and says, “Am I on the right track?”
Sherlock smiles, heading up the small pathway to the door. “Things aren’t always as they seem,” he says.
Arthur is quiet for a moment, and the sounds of the park seem distant to John, far from the little bubble he’s in with Arthur where his words echo over and over in his ears. Arthur pats his arm and leaves his hand there. “And now?” he asks.
Sherlock clears his throat. “Yes,” he says, and finally takes his menu. His eyes scan the items, but he’s not paying attention; he’s only thinking of John’s words.
Sherlock watches as John spreads the lube over his cock, his own cock hard and leaking against his stomach.  He groans in anticipation, his stomach fluttering.  He lets his legs relax so John can move and he wraps them high around John’s waist as soon as he can, and John leans down to kiss him, slowly, and Sherlock reaches for him desperately, eager to touch him, to feel him.
“Um,” John says ineloquently. “Okay. And how old - ”
“That’s me,” Sherlock says. He can’t help it; a giggle escapes his mouth.
“I want to stay longer,” Sherlock says.
, I’ve been searching and I don’t even know how to find you – please, Sherlock, you have to explain this to me.”
He squeezes his eyes shut and ignores the way his hands shake, ignores the fear clawing at him, and stands. He makes his way to the bathroom on shaky legs and washes his hands thoroughly, then changes into jeans and a jumper. Redbeard is making frantic sounds, and he’s slithered along the floor to wind up the leg of John’s trousers. He’s made it all the way to his belt before John takes hold of him with a shaky hand. He holds him carefully and ignores his squirming, and takes him downstairs and deposits him on the mantle.
“I do,” she says. “I thought I might as well invite you and save you the trouble of planning subterfuge.”
He turns to leave, and this time, like a flood of sensation, his body feels like his own again, and he’s in complete control. He’s taken one step towards the doorway when the man’s deep voice interrupts him.
“Can I come, Mummy?” Sherlock asks.
“Does that feel good, love? I want you to feel good,” John says. His voice is gentle, warm, familiar, and Sherlock curls closer, nuzzles John’s knee, doesn’t think he can speak. John’s fingers smooth up and down the back of his head again, and Sherlock thinks he would do anything for John in this moment,
“You – you’re alive?” Sherlock manages, sure he’s dreaming.
“Smart. He’s rubbing off on you,” Greg comments, nodding. “I’ve known him since he was a wee thing running after Mycroft and yelling at him for everything under the sun. Have you met Mycroft?” Greg asks, looking at him curiously.
observe, not in this state of heightened emotional awareness. He swallows.
“You consult a fortuneteller?”
John gives a huff of frustration. “Would you bloody leave off her a bit? How do you even know I had lunch with her?”
Sherlock’s eyes widen, his jaw freezes mid-chew, and he swivels around slowly, realizing he’s failed to account for one major factor. “Yes, Mummy?” he says around a mouthful of meringue.
“Shut up,” John says. “Don’t talk.”
“John, it’s – what you said–” He takes a deep breath, looks away for a moment, and makes himself start again. “I’m not very good at this, either. Talking. I’m sorry. You’re – I didn't think anyone would ever… I’m not used to having even a friend, let alone… let alone
, John realizes, relief flooding him. He looks at the mantle where Billy sits and he swallows shakily, his legs threatening to give out. He doesn’t
His phone buzzes with a text a moment later, and he smiles, knowing it will be from John.
“Care to elaborate?” John asks, annoyed, going to lean against the doorway to the living room so he can see Sherlock.
Redbeard, though, doesn’t want to leave John’s hand. He squeaks and burrows into John’s sleeve, causing John to wrinkle his nose in discomfort and holds stock still as the little pipefox crawls up his bare arm; it’s a strange sensation, knowing the creature is inside his clothes, and the hair on the back of his neck stands up as Redbeard slithers along his bare skin, pressed close because of the constriction of his sleeve.
Sherlock shakes his head gently. “Can’t you see? You’ve made the present world truth, John Hamish Watson.”
“I do,” John says. He brushes his thumb against Sherlock’s cheekbone this time, and Sherlock doesn't mean to, but he leans into the touch, feels his eyes drift closed for just a moment.
John’s throat tightens and he holds out a shaking hand. Redbeard immediately curls around it, and the moment John feels the little furry body against his skin, he curls his fingers around Redbeard’s body in return, careful that they’re not too tight, and holds him against his cheek as he feels his lips twist of their own volition. A muffled sob he can’t contain rises in his throat and he closes his eyes and covers his face with his free hand. He hears Mycroft walking away, and he holds Redbeard close to him for a moment and does his best to breathe deeply. Redbeard’s head is soothing against his cheek, reassuring in its familiarity.
Sherlock shifts so that John can pull her out of her shirt, and then John settles against her. Sherlock moans at the way John’s breasts settle against hers and can’t help but shift her hips up towards John’s eagerly, and John goes back to kissing her neck, running a hand up and down Sherlock’s side, stroking her thumb over Sherlock’s nipple once more. Sherlock arches into the touch, and her heart beats faster when John starts to trail kisses down her neck, then gently takes her other nipple into her mouth, swirling her tongue over it. Sherlock’s breath hitches and then John gently takes it between her teeth and Sherlock groans, the sound spilling out of her lips before she can stop it. John flicks her tongue against Sherlock’s nipple, pressing it up against her teeth, massaging it with her tongue, and the sensation travels straight to Sherlock’s cunt, warmth pooling there, and Sherlock moans when John’s hand gently twists Sherlock’s other nipple, her tongue and teeth still massaging all the while, and it’s setting Sherlock on
“He was a ghost,” Sherlock murmurs.
He turns his head to the side, and looks down at his hand.  He’s clutching the hand of a young girl’s skeleton.
is for John and John alone, and he finally understands that John’s is also for him. He smiles, his breath ghosting over the shell of John’s ear as he whispers, “Yes.”
After a while of splashing and wrestling in the water, they finally stop to rest, treading water in the deep center of the pond again, facing each other as the last of their laughter leaves their bodies.
at each other, and they smile. Sherlock thinks the way John’s short hair musses up against the pillow is breathtaking, thinks the way John’s eyes are half-lidded in the morning is remarkable. He hums in pleasure, lets his fingers drift up and down John’s spine, shifts his calf up and down alongside John’s.
“John,” Sherlock says, sounding desperate. “Cook.”
Sherlock flushes and lights the fire, ignores the way it blazes up a little too far for a moment before it settles. He pretends the warmth on his cheeks is from his beer.
John stares at the little creature. He remembers how strange it had been at first to have him wrapped around his wrist or his neck, how he sometimes felt annoyed by his presence, and how much he now comes to rely on him. His heart aches at the thought of Sherlock losing him as a child. “I don’t blame you for keeping him big sometimes. He’s quite something, isn’t he?”
It takes Sherlock a moment to catch up to what John’s talking about, but he realizes John means the window. “Of course,” Sherlock says.
“I’m fine,” John says. “Are you?”
“Yes,” she says as Sherlock watches, legs crossed and eyes now trained on John. Outside, rain begins to fall, the sound blending with the gentle scratching of the pendulum’s tip in the sand. “But you’re very worried, John, aren’t you? About the ghosts and spirits that follow you.”
“Mm,” Sherlock says.
She stands up in one smooth, grateful movement, her long lilac-colored dress flowing with her body.  She hesitates for a moment, and John is moments away from reaching out and just stealing it, but finally, finally, she holds her hands out.  John reaches out with trembling hands to take the cupcake from her.  It’s surprisingly light in his hands, and he swallows at the warmth it spreads over his skin.  He feels safe and calm, and he finds himself unable to speak for a moment, overwhelmed by the sensation of it.  He closes his eyes, his hands trembling.  His heartbeat feels loud in his ears, but it’s not panic making it thrum so strongly.
“My pocket?” John says with a frown, not sure what it could be.  He stands up and rifles through for a moment – keys, loose change – and then he pulls out the end of the arrow Sherlock had put in there.  “This?” John asks, holding out the arrow to the little fox boy.
“Sherlock,” John says, his voice croaky from disuse. He clears his throat. “What time’s it?”
The music is sweet in the quiet of the flat, mingling with the sound of the soft rain falling outside, and it allows his mind to wander, to think, to obsess, just as it always does. He’s allowed himself to indulge in the rarity of maudlin, the mood having struck him quite unprepared, but he finds that embracing the sweet melancholy once in a while is quite pleasing, especially when his mind won’t stop turning and turning and
“Oh,” Sherlock says again, his mind racing. “Of course I care about Iris. She’s endlessly fascinating, John.”
John comes in, a bottle of wine and their two glasses floating ahead of him. Sherlock swallows, the warmth of John’s magic heavy and lush in his garden. He plucks a glass from the air, not really caring if it’s his or John’s and eagerly takes a sip.
“You broke the spell the next day. You must have, anyway, because I changed back into a boy, and you were the only one who could have done it. You must have loved me, even though I was a nutcracker. When you freed me, I woke up, but I was in someone’s bedroom and there was no sign of you.”
He keeps walking, a sense of urgency falling over him as he follows the sound. The voice is familiar, but he can’t place it, and he feels like he has to get to its source as soon as possible. He walks fast, so fast he’s just considering all out running instead, when finally, he sees a woman standing in the distance. His eyes widen at her familiar form and he stops in surprise when he’s a few steps away.
“I can do that,” Sherlock says. His voice is soft but confident, and John swallows, suddenly overwhelmed and not sure how to handle the situation.
John’s annoyed and he stares at Sherlock for a moment, retorts popping to the forefront of his mind, but he knows a lost battle when he sees one, and so he swallows them down. Instead, he turns to check his collar in the mirror above the fireplace, and sure enough, he can see Redbeard’s soft head peeking out over the checked fabric of his shirt. He puts his hand up and wiggles his fingers towards the little pipefox, who obediently leaves his neck to curl around them, and John fixes his collar properly with one hand.
“John!” he calls without thinking, but then stops running suddenly when a horn blares in front of him. He steps back – the light has changed, he can’t cross, but John has heard him.
“If she seems
“Call Molly,” Billy suggests, and John is grateful for Billy’s presence, which has slowly become comforting to him.
Mycroft smiles, but it seems a bit more genuine this time.  “You’d be willing to forfeit your payment for him?”
“Now, about our agreement,” the man says to Sherlock.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock breathes. “Don’t – I’m sorry.”
“Don’t worry,” John says. “I can come visit anytime!”
Then he’s squeezed into a vice and the magic around him is so tight he thinks he’s going to explode and then they’re at home and then he vomits.
When he opens the door, though, smiling widely, Sherlock stares at him from the couch with a dark expression.
“Hogwarts would have been hard for you, then,” John says, understanding in his voice. “All the magic everywhere.”
“I couldn’t tell you in the beginning,” Sherlock says a moment later. His voice is hushed. “I wanted to, so many times, but it would have been dangerous if you knew.”
Sherlock turns, but doesn’t lower his violin, continuing to play Debussy as his eyes confirm what he’d already imagined in his mind. “John,” he says, and even though he’d expected to see John looking like this, one of his least favorite versions of John, he can’t help but let his eyes flicker over him, cataloging everything he sees for later perusal. “Did something…happen?”
John remembers the sweet but complex taste of the wine very well, just as he remembers sitting on the roof while Sherlock smoked his ridiculous pipe and John was only just beginning to get to know him. It seems like lifetimes ago now, and John smiles, a bit lost in the memory.
Redbeard sniffs the bandana once, then twice, and then starts sniffing it madly, squeaking and burrowing into the fabric, leaving John’s fingers to curl around the hand holding the bandana. John smiles and brings both the bandana and Redbeard closer to himself, watching as Redbeard delights in his memory, his little body twitching as it traverses the familiar black cloth. John feels something clench in his stomach and he feels absurdly lucky for this little view into Sherlock’s world, this little secret glimpse.
“I’m sorry Mycroft is a git,” he whispers to him, holding him tight against his chest. He lays down beside the tree, holding his nutcracker close and admiring the way the fairy lights reflect on the shiny ornaments, and before he knows it, his eyes grow heavy and he falls asleep thinking about all the adventures he can have with his new friend.
To his surprise, the flowers at the bottom are red.  “I’ve never seen a red hydrangea,” he muses, glancing up at Sherlock.
John laughs, shaking his head, wondering not for the first time how someone such as Sherlock even exists. “I was hoping you would finish it for me.”
– he thinks he’ll miss if he goes to her. He can’t remember who (yes, who, definitely who), but he can remember vague impressions – the warm scent of smoke, the sound of a deep, velvety laugh, a flash of blue silk fabric – and he urgently wants to see him. He frowns and steps back again.
To his delight, John smiles back. Sherlock has known what it’s like to fall for a long time, he thinks, but now he knows what it’s like to grow wings.
Sherlock’s eyes widen. “You –
He stands outside the door for a moment, gathering his resolve, and then reaches out with a steady hand. Before he can turn the knob, though, the door swings open, making the same ominous creaking sound John had heard in the tunnels.
He picks it up and lays it on the table once more, letting his hands smooth over the texture of the case, before reverently opening it. He picks up the violin and plucks it, then grimaces, his spine involuntarily twisting in a need to physically compensate for how out of tune the strings are. He plucks the A string and wrinkles his nose, then carefully tries to turn the tuning peg. He braces himself when it doesn’t turn as easily as he’d like, and carefully applies just enough force to get it going before he brings it up to where it should be and then carefully adjusts the fine tuner. He tunes the D and G strings next, but when he gets to the E string, the most out of tune, it snaps as he tightens it.
“It’s not philosophy, it’s fact,” Sherlock replies.
“Stonehenge,” John clarifies. “Don’t tell me you deleted it. I’d think it’d be interesting to you, centuries old mystery and all that.”
John’s stunned for a moment, all of Sherlock’s actions of the day catching up to him, and he can’t wrap his mind around how much of this Sherlock knew would happen, and whether or not this is really Sherlock’s intention for the arrow – but then, Sherlock’s voice is in his mind, saying, “It’s inevitable, John,” and he stops worrying.
“But you have your brother,” John says.
John blinks at him, his heart pounding, and feels desperation wash over him. He needs to find Sherlock, he remembers, and there’s blood dripping into his collar and cold panic gripping him. His head is pounding and he feels nauseous, sure he will throw up at any moment. Terror is clawing at his insides, and the fear of losing Sherlock is real and tangible when suddenly, almost hysterically, he realizes that he’s going about this all wrong.
“I didn’t ask for toast,” Sherlock mumbles into the table.
He’s close, though, closer than he’s been yet. It feels good to be so close, exhilarating, even, but he knows that if he plays more today, he’ll only try to play more advanced music than he should, that he’ll play fast music without proper technique and set himself back, so he sets his violin down, lets his fingers linger on the beautiful arch of the scroll and caress the soft curve of the waist, lets a soft smile play on his lips, and relishes the way his heart seems to expand in his chest.
Finally, after a long and fruitless day, one of Mycroft’s cars brings him home. In the sleek and impersonal car, wrapped in the armor of his tailored suit, it’s easy to fall into the logical sociopath persona he’s so carefully crafted. But when the car pulls up to 221B, he’s shocked by the sudden wall of emotion, mostly relief, which hits him.
“I’m sorry,” John says a while later, glad he’s finished his tea because he’s quite sure he would’ve spit it out had he still been drinking it.  “Did you just say we need to go to Mary’s first?”
Sherlock blinks and feels surprisingly wrong-footed. “I don’t –”
“John,” Sherlock says, unsure what else to say, unsure how to proceed.
This isn’t his first time coming back to the violin after a long time away, but the other times have been different. When he came back after being dead, there was a reason he couldn’t have played – he’d been dead, after all, and so he’d been patient with himself as he got used to playing again. It had been really difficult for a few weeks, but he’d found his way back, and somehow, he’d found that his playing became even better than it had been before.
. John feels something for him.   His heart lodges somewhere in his throat. “John,” he says. Desire is pooling in his stomach, and his heart is beating faster. He’s grateful when John tugs him down for a kiss, parting his lips, pressing their tongues together.
John is so close now that there is barely a hand’s width between them. Sherlock is sure that their chests are close enough that John can feel the desperate pounding of his heart, but John makes no reaction if he does. Instead, he squeezes Sherlock’s left hand once, then drops it, and Sherlock swallows loudly when John brings his hand up instead, lets it cup the side of Sherlock’s face. Sherlock feels a shiver run down his spine, feels his breath hitch, feels like he can’t breathe because
But none of those things can help him, and he’s left standing alone, his hands balled into tight fists, his eyes closed, his heart in his throat, bereft. Redbeard nudges him with his long snout, and John buries his hand in his ruff for a moment and leans his head on top of Redbeard’s, keeping his eyes closed. His heart is still pounding, but Redbeard’s presence helps, somehow, and he focuses on the feeling of his fur around him. He’s not sure what to do next, how to find Sherlock again, but Redbeard makes a whining sound and cranes his head towards the way they came, so John follows him.
Daddy calls them over and Sherlock goes eagerly, especially when he notices that he’s moved on from Great Uncle Alfred to talk to Gran. Sherlock rushes forward ahead of Mycroft, and lets Gran kiss his cheeks, giving Mycroft a triumphant look when she does so because she takes the sweets out of her pocket and lets him choose first.
“John,” Sherlock says when John is almost at the bottom. He’s sitting on the arm of the couch, his feet on the cushion. “Billy and I were just - ”
“And Billy and Mrs. Hudson,” John points out.
Sherlock has never slept with his head on someone’s chest before, has never slept with his arm around someone’s waist or someone’s arms around him or his legs tangled together with someone else’s, and his heart is still beating fast as he tries to take it all in.
“Er, sorry,” John says again.  He wonders if he will ever stop apologizing.
“The beginning of
, he thinks.
“Did she now?” Sherlock asks. He raises one eyebrow, and John can’t read the expression on his face. “That sounds…
John nods and carefully picks up the urn. It’s surprisingly heavy, and he passes it gently to Sherlock, then does the same with the water, which is lighter than it looks. Sherlock sets them both down behind him on the fire escape, and then steps to the side.
Sherlock raises an eyebrow in surprise, and John shrugs.
but it’s really much more complicated.
Sherlock rolls his eyes. “Honestly, John, I don’t know why you’d even ask me that. I respect her talents as a fortuneteller. That’s all.”
. Don’t you think you should have told me that?”
“They live in the spirit world, too,” Sherlock says. “They’re still alive, but they’re dreadfully boring; I don’t like to visit them. They don’t approve of me living down here all the time, anyway.”
“Redbeard, please, help him,” he begs, realizing that Redbeard could be the key to saving Sherlock.
John sets his paper aside and puts his hands on the arms of his chair for a moment, and lets out a loud breath, then nods his head once and stands up, his shoulders stiff. He hobbles over to the sofa with his cane and sits down, then lifts his bad leg up with his hands and follows through with his other leg easily.
“You’re perfect,” he murmurs to John, overcome with emotion and gratitude.
Sherlock blinks, taken aback. “I didn’t mean it that way,” he says. “I wasn’t – of course there’s nothing wrong with Squibs. Most wizards aren’t of that opinion, though.”
Sherlock shrugs and inhales his long pipe again. He holds the smoke in his mouth a moment, then tilts his head back to blow it slowly into the darkness. “Making lots of good friends, like Angelo’s son,” he says, though it doesn’t completely explain his comment.
John nods, though he knows Billy can’t see it.  His skin feels prickly, and every time he tries to focus on the woman from the park, he’s overwhelmed by the dark energy surrounding him.  He swallows, his throat constricting.  Goose pimples are breaking out over his skin, and terrible memories are coming at him unbidden.  He sees guns, hears bombs, feels a bullet tearing through his shoulder –
,” Sherlock finally says. “John, you – do you realize –”
John snorts. “Right, okay,” he says, unfazed by Sherlock’s dismissal of the topic. He turns towards Sherlock, thinking back to the tunnels. “When Moriarty took you away from me there, in the tunnels –” He pauses, the panic that had overtaken him in the tunnels flashing back to him as he thinks about it. He clears his throat, his hand clenching around his fork. “He took you back to his house?”
Also, for those of you who are familiar with the xxxHOLiC series, my story progresses quite differently from xxxHOLiC canon from this point onward.  The ending of xxxHOLiC left me unsatisfied to say the least, so this story is my way to fix that.  I think you'll be surprised (and hopefully pleased) by my version of the ending! :)
“Sherlock, did you go to the grocery store?” John asks.
John laughs, scrubbing a hand over his eyes, then looks up at Sherlock. His mouth is open like he’s going to say something and his eyes are shining and amused, but he hesitates, and then says, voice softer than Sherlock expected, “No. No, of course not. It’s perfect; better than anything I would’ve gotten her,” he assures, and something inside Sherlock settles, and he feels tension he didn’t know he’d been carrying leave his shoulders. He nods, eyes Iris for a moment, eyes John, and then nods again. “Tea?” he asks. He goes to the kitchen before John can answer.
“I have something very special for you this year,” Uncle Augustus tells Sherlock, crouching down again so they’re on eye level, and Sherlock listens intently, leaning forward so he can focus. “I confess, though, I didn’t make it from scratch. I found it, and I fixed it up for you, but I really think you’ll like it.”
quite eager to understand the situation. The urgency has passed now that he knows that Sherlock seems pleased that he’s met Greg, though, so he takes his steaming mug and leisurely sits at the kitchen table. Sherlock abruptly stops pacing and sits across from him. He immediately leans forward in his seat and stares at John intently, holding his hands together almost as if he’s praying and resting his chin atop his fingertips.
John’s heart speeds up. “Good,” he says. “What’s the cost?”
“Good,” Sherlock says. “You’re not supposed to sleep with a concussion. Or Apparate.”
“So says the man who sees ghosts and spirits,” Sherlock says.
“You – you’re the nutcracker?” Sherlock asks, his eyes wide. “
“Come on, John,” she says.
. “It’s not – really, it’s not like that. Not at
Soon enough, the unsteady sound of John’s footsteps, which Sherlock is already growing accustomed to, descends down the stairs, and Sherlock makes sure to look busy.
“Yes, he’s in the bag. John, why don’t you get Billy out of there? He’s bound to be feeling a big claustrophobic by now,” Sherlock says.
“John,” she repeats. She sounds desperate and takes a step towards him. “John, you have to come with me,
“Don’t touch him.”
He leaves 221B Baker Street and vows never to return.
“But you gave this one the most attention,” Sherlock points out.  “So it’s the best one.”
The cold of the spirit is seeping into him, turning his stomach into a tight knot. He feels like he has the flu. His entire body aches, he’s sweating, and his head is pounding in dizziness. Then he feels it: the spirit is clinging to his back, pressed against him like a block of ice against his body. It’s making his stomach turn. He wants to throw up.
John sits beside him and looks up at the elaborate chandelier for a moment, then turns to Sherlock with a crooked smile. “I don’t know,” he admits. “Something a bit more…moldy?”
, he thinks.
She pauses, and John’s watching her with a pounding heart, his hand trembling on the handle where it rests. Her words are unexpected, and he doesn’t doubt their integrity for even a second. Vaguely formed memories of parents he didn’t really know flash through his mind, his heart twisting in his chest.
John snorts as he rotates his bad shoulder a bit; it has been stiff all day. “I don’t think so, but it might do, knowing Sherlock.”
John looks down with a chuckle. “Oh, right,” he says, a bit sheepishly. Sherlock neglected to mention that he can still sense the magical residue of St. Mungo’s all over John, a particularly strong and harsh magic that makes him want to wrinkle his nose and request John take a shower.
“Of course it is,” John says. “God, Sherlock, of
John just stares at her and his mouth drops open. He clenches and unclenches his hand at his side, his heart beating fast in his chest. “Mum?” he asks, confused. Why is he confused? He’s not sure, but his head is swimming. There’s something wrong with this, he thinks. He’s not supposed to see her.
“It’s alright,” John says. He tilts his head just enough to press a kiss against the corner of Sherlock’s mouth again. Their noses bump along the way, and he smiles, making them bump once more. Sherlock wrinkles his nose in annoyance, and John laughs.
Sherlock smiles. “Sure.”
“I suppose you’re right,” Mummy says, and Sherlock twists in her arms, finally breaking free of them, and he lunges for Daddy, but Mummy grabs him back just in time, as Daddy heads to their room, where Sherlock knows he will lock away the nutcracker.
“’Course I did,” John mutters, and Greg laughs. “I did yell at him a lot, though,” he adds.
,” John repeats, and the taxi driver shuts up.
John and Sherlock both send a glare in her direction, but it only makes her smile more, and Billy chuckles.
“Mycroft,” John says, equal parts relieved and distrustful, ignoring his questions of how the fuck Mycroft knew Sherlock was in danger.  “What do I do?”
Sherlock wants to protest, doesn’t want him to go, but he nods, and John climbs over him. He comes back quickly with a warm, wet flannel, and he prods Sherlock until he’s lying flat on his back, and Sherlock melts into the mattress, feeling boneless and pleased. He knows he’s looking up at John with a smile he’d normally want to hide, but he can’t bring himself to care.
“Alright?” John asks.
“People can wish for anything, John,” Sherlock says. “Happiness, unhappiness. There’s nothing we can do to stop someone from wishing for something unpleasant. It’s their choice.”
John laughs. “I’m not sure it works like that,” he says and then coughs, turning away from Arthur.
“Going home?” Sherlock asks, his voice a low murmur.
Sherlock sighs. “Uneventful,” he says. “I had to negotiate the terms of an old wish with a rather unsavory character. It took a long time to track him down, but we found him eventually and did what we had to do.”
“Oh, look at me, forgetting my manners,” he says. He giggles and steps closer to John. “I’m Jim. Jim Moriarty.”
“I have,” John says, though there’s no edge to his words. “I don’t tend to listen to rumors, particularly rubbish ones. Did you go to Beauxbatons? Durmstrang? I mean, you’re clearly not a Squib if you’ve been ordering potions ingredients…”
John comes back a moment later, menu in hand, and sits in the little space between the edge of the sofa and Sherlock’s back. He peers over and sees the lights, and smiles. “That’s lovely,” he tells him.
“Well, you learned something, didn’t you?  You figured out how to find me.  That’s quite important.”
“So did I,” John murmurs. “Even if I never knew what I was waiting for.”
“It’s not in my possession,” Sherlock says. “It’s in John’s.”
“Isn’t that touching,” Sherlock remarks, and John turns to glare at him.
When the man disappears through the door, John emerges from the kitchen. “That stuff coming out of his finger…was that smoke?” he asks.
“I wished for you to realize your importance, and because my wish was granted, you created a world in which you had the power to defeat Moriarty because
“Mm,” Sherlock says. He smiles, closes his eyes. “I can feel it in the wards now, it’s warm.”
“Just answer the question,” John says through clenched teeth.
“You could never,” Sherlock murmurs, setting his phone aside. He cradles Iris’ head again, presses a kiss into the exact spot John had kissed earlier. He inhales her warm, clean scent and kisses her again, just because he can.
“Oh,” Sherlock says again. He keeps his eyes trained ahead of him, and when John brushes their elbows together, Sherlock looks up at him questioningly.
“You don’t have to do that!” Mary says. Her tone is just on the edge of frantic and John laughs.
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “I was in the tunnels first, of course. The tunnels exist in the astral plane, John. No one could have gone there besides you or I.”
“Sherlock didn’t tell me anything,” John says, his voice thin and weak.
, unbearably so.
the importance you needed. And that is the same importance ordinary mortals shouldn’t be born with, the same importance that ensured my wish was granted, the same importance that made you capable of negating Moriarty’s claim on my life. It’s a cycle, John, and your perfectly clever wish sealed it all,” Sherlock says, staring at John with excitement and passion that John can’t latch onto just yet.
It’s odd to see Sherlock somewhere other than Baker Street, especially here, sitting stiffly atop a picnic blanket in the park. He stifles the urge to laugh and instead takes a bottle of wine out of the bag, and three glasses. He ignores the thought that it should only be two.
“Don’t be dull,” Sherlock says. “Of course I’m not; you know I don’t have time for things like that.”
John shakes his head, horror flooding him as thick, dark smoke spreads over Sherlock’s arms, obscuring them from view. “Sherlock,
“This appears to be in order, thank you,” Sherlock says dismissively. He takes the money he’d prepared in advance out of his pocket and passes it over to Mike, then turns back to his ingredients, waving a dismissive hand in his guests’ direction. “I’m sure you can see yourself out,” he adds when Mike doesn’t move.
They’re both in the sitting room one morning, John reading the newspaper and Sherlock sorting through some scrolls, when there’s a tapping on the front window. Sherlock recognizes the owl immediately, of course, and goes to let him in.
“Actually, it’s gotten worse,” the man says. “Even my arm is hard to move now.”
“Of course you don’t,” John says. “I just thought –”
John’s jaw clenches as he watches him go, his irritation building and mixing with the pain in his shoulder. “Why, because I’m so thick I can’t bloody understand it? Is that it?” he calls into the kitchen.
John swallows hard. “Coming to get you, you git,” he says, trying for a sense of normalcy. He wants to run to him, wants to take care of him, and wants to take him home. It’s all wrong; Sherlock’s not supposed to ask him any questions. Sherlock’s supposed to
“You don’t have to tell me about your magic,” John says. “I know you don’t… for whatever reason, you don’t like to talk about it, but it’s brilliant.” He pauses, hesitates, and Sherlock isn’t looking at him, but he’s listening intently to every word, his every cell on alert. No one has talked to him like this before. No one has called him brilliant; they’ve just thought him incompetent.
She looks like she’s been crying, and she’s walking stiffly, as if she’s in pain. She sits on the edge of the bed, as far from John as possible.
“You’re not gross,” he murmurs to it, feeling a few tears leak from the corner of his eye.  “It must’ve been awful being alone for so long.”
John shifts his hand a bit on the handle, their pinkies brushing once more, and Sherlock presses his closer to John’s. John smiles as he looks ahead, feeling his cheeks flush, his nervous system come alive. He has no idea where they are or how they got here, no idea what these creatures are that he’s following, no idea what lies ahead of them, but somehow, walking beside Sherlock with the lantern in their grasp, it seems
this, and so when John comes back and sits beside Sherlock on the couch, Sherlock’s not looking at him.
“We’re here,” Sherlock says, gesturing towards the house. It’s very small, nothing special; it’s only one story, and seems to only have a few rooms inside. There’s no sign, or anything to distinguish it from any other house.
, but he’s not ready, not yet,
Sherlock beams, and John gets the feeling he’s fallen into a trap as Sherlock puts the skull in the tote bag John’s put the picnic supplies in.
“No,” she says, and John is looking back and forth between them, quite sure he might be missing a level of this conversation.
John startles when Mrs. Hudson comes closer to him and holds out her hand, giving him a stern look. He frowns in confusion, but sees that she’s holding Redbeard. He sighs and holds up his hand, and Redbeard scurries over his fingers. He feels warm, and John is pleased to feel his familiar weight.
a choice. And he’s making this choice right now to open this door and find Sherlock because it’s
“Go ahead,” John says with a shrug. “Your lungs, mate.”
John blinks, but he doesn’t look away as his eyes grow shiny. Sherlock smiles tenderly, feels a prickle behind his own eyes.
“Yes, you can. Come sit,” John says again, gesturing towards the chair. Sherlock gives him a dirty look, and John sighs. “A patient had exploding snaps that malfunctioned and exploded in her face, quite horribly, and she brought them with her, and they exploded in
“You should be careful, John,” she says.
Sherlock smiles, but it doesn’t quite reach his eyes. “Yes,” he says.
Sherlock blinks, realizing that this is no time to sit around and be useless. This is an
She shrugs him off, still sobbing, and sits up.  She’s hiccupping for breath now, and John feels something break in his heart.  It’s all so clear now, and he knows what to do.  His panic begins to recede.
Sherlock moans helplessly and his hips jerk upward when a second finger joins the first and they unerringly find his prostate.  Sparks shoot up his spine and he bites his lip helplessly.  “John, I can’t – you need to –”  His voice is rough and he’s desperate for friction, desperate for John to be inside him, desperate for release.  His entire body is wound tight and he’s trembling, shaking with need.
Sherlock’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline and his mouth falls slightly open. His brain is hung up on that one, because he hadn’t factored that into his possibilities. He didn’t want to, because it made him feel an uncomfortable mix of compassion and sadness for John, the unexpected sense of empathy making him reel a bit, but also
Sherlock rolls his eyes and stands up. He’s wearing a dark blue dressing gown, the voluminous sleeves of which nearly cover his hands. It trails on the floor behind him as he approaches John.
John wakes slowly and groans. He’s lying in bed, but it’s not his own – Sherlock’s, he realizes. It’s soft and comforting, but he’s exhausted and his throat is dry. He turns his head and cracks his eyes open, squinting against the light, which does nothing to help the way his head pounds. He sees Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed, his body held taut, staring at John.
. He opens his eyes a moment later, and nods. “Continue,” he says desperately, voice ragged. “Please.”
“I know,” Sherlock says. “I’ll explain when you’ve woken up a bit more.”
Mary twists her hands into the fabric of her trousers and takes a deep, shuddering breath. “You really are an idiot, John. Have a little self preservation,” she tells him. She stands and turns to leave, and when she turns her back to him, John notices bandages peeking out the top of her shirt.
John laughs and rubs a hand over his face, the absurdity of both what happened the night before and Sherlock’s personality washing over him in waves. “Can you – I have no idea what just happened to me,” he says, letting his hands fall by his side again.
“I’m not jealous,” he says.  “But it bloody figures that I don’t get to see Mary, Sherlock eats her birthday present, and then this beautiful woman comes out of nowhere and Sherlock gets her, too.”
Sherlock turns and walks away from Mycroft’s door, back towards the forest, and John looks back and forth between them for a moment, taking in Sherlock’s increasingly distant back and Mycroft’s obnoxiously amused countenance, then nods in Mycroft’s general direction and jogs to catch up with Sherlock, leaving Mycroft’s house without a second glance in his direction.
John shakes his head as he pulls a mug down from the cabinet, but flushes when he thinks that Sherlock knows not just John’s own last name, but also his first and middle. He smiles as he sets the mug down on the counter. “It’s Greg,” he tells Sherlock, glancing over his shoulder. “Greg Lestrade.”
John stares for a moment, then turns to Sherlock. “Have you told her about me?” he asks.
“John, don’t touch it,” Sherlock says, but John touches it anyway, eager to make his way to Sherlock. The web sticks to him, though, and the more he fights it, the more entangled he gets.
“It’s quite inconvenient, isn’t it? Seeing them,” Sherlock says in lieu of an answer.
It’s almost enough to make him give up on it entirely for the day, but the familiar sounds of tuning, the familiar feel of the strings beneath his fingers, the smell of rosin and the texture of the velvet lining of his case, make him reach into the small pocket inside the case for a spare string. He sits down and carefully, tenderly, replaces his E string, then gently brings it up to pitch. When all the strings are as they should be, he affectionately plucks his thumb across them, and the sound of all four strings in tune is so soothing and overwhelming that he closes his eyes and savors it, savors the way it settles in his ears, savors the way it feels as if it’s coming directly from his heart. Making this sound again, so simple and taken for granted at one point in his life, makes him feel surprisingly vulnerable, and he plucks across the strings once more, letting the sound reverberate, treasuring it and honoring it, realizing as he hears it once more how very much he’s missed it.
, that they’re the key he needs to save Sherlock.
John just stares at him, mouth slightly agape.  “You don’t-”
Sherlock shoves his hands in his pockets and turns to leave, clearly in some kind of snit, and John sighs and musters up the energy to follow along as usual.
“What the bloody fuck!” he says. Yet again, his heart is pounding as he stares, wide-eyed, at the skull in his hands.
John laughs. “You
Sherlock doesn’t know how John can be thinking of wine right now. He waves a hand in the air distractedly. “Yes. Fine. Sure.”
“I don’t,” John insists.
“Let’s go show it to Himself, then, hmm?” John says to Redbeard, who is still making delighted squeaks. John stifles a yawn and then gets out of bed, pulling Redbeard out of the fabric and holding him in his other hand. Redbeard slithers up his arm and curls around his neck, pleased if the amount of squeaking and kissing he’s doing as John heads downstairs counts for anything. As John gets to the bottom of the stairs, he’s shocked by the pleasant smell that greets him.
His hands are shaking and he stands rooted to the spot, wondering if this is finally his psychotic break.
He tilts his jaw a bit and runs his free hand along Sherlock’s back, pulling Sherlock closer, enjoying the feel of sinewy muscle under his hands. Sherlock moans helplessly into the kiss, and John pulls him closer still. They can’t get any closer; it’s not possible.
, and John doesn’t know what it is. It’s as if there’s a side of Sherlock he keeps locked away from John, and John doesn’t understand.
John shakes his head and stares at the teakettle, too tired to do much else.
“It’s down here,” she says. She doesn’t leave the building, but instead, goes down a hallway. She gestures towards a door that says “221A.” “That’s my apartment,” she explains, “And 221C is the basement apartment. Sherlock uses it as his warehouse.”
He looks up and feels color rise on his cheeks when he sees that John is watching him. John hastily takes a bite of his dinner, and Sherlock takes another sip of wine. He doesn't know why his heart is beating so fast, doesn’t understand the way John was just looking at him.
? But you – am I – it really happened, right? Your house? The Land of Sweets? Am I crazy? How –”
“That’s not the point,” Mary says, her expression unwavering.
; he groans, loud enough that John kisses him and murmurs
John huffs out a laugh. “No, idiot,” he says, and Sherlock feels a little pool of warmth in his chest. “At taking care of Iris.”
“Yes,” Sherlock says. “Please.” His voice is low and soft, and John stares at him, breathless.
“I’ll order,” Sherlock says. “Why don’t you have a shower?”
John frowns. “I
“No interruptions, Billy,” he says. “Go on, John.”
They pull apart and just stare at each other, and suddenly Sherlock is struck by the absurdity of the fact that he is standing next to such a huge tree with
“Take the water, John, and pour it in here,” Sherlock says as he sets the urn down. He crouches down next to it, positioning it carefully, and he doesn’t look up as he speaks.
John opens the door to 221B after a long day at work and, instead of shouting or giving in to his urge to just turn around and go back outside when he sees what Sherlock’s doing, he sighs, scrubbing a hand over his face and just stares at Sherlock, who is firing arrows into a very large pillow that’s now stuck to their wall, held in place by previously fired arrows.
“No,” Sherlock says. John’s hands shift around to the front of Sherlock’s trousers and settle over his belt buckle. He looks up at Sherlock, and he smiles.
John groans. “We’re really not,” he protests, as Sherlock smiles widely next to him.  “Anyway, what do I want this broken arrow for?”
“I love you,” John says again. It seems so obvious to him now that they would end up like this, that they would be tangled together in Sherlock’s bed, naked and sated and scared and elated.
“Shall we get a curry?” John asks a moment later, smiling.
“John, Moriarty can’t kill you, for the same reason
He goes up to the door and opens it fearlessly, entering with a straight back as if he owns the building. John shakes his head and follows.
“Is there anything you
“That’s all that matters, isn’t it?” John asks. His voice is soft. “I love you,” he repeats, and though he’s said it already, it makes Sherlock’s heart jolt. “And you love me. And we’ve wasted so much time –”
John cards his fingers through Sherlock’s hair and presses a kiss to the top of his head.  “It’s alright,” John says.  “You’re alright.”
Sherlock is lying in bed, long since having said goodnight to everyone, but he can’t sleep. He keeps thinking about his nutcracker, lying alone under the tree. He feels wracked with guilt that he’s already broken its arm, even if it
When they get to Regent's Park, Arthur knowledgeably steers John to a secluded corner, and finds an empty bench all by itself beneath a tree that provides ample shade. They sit together, and the conversation flows easily. John doesn’t always like talking to people; sometimes, he just doesn’t have the patience, but it’s nice, talking to Arthur.
John picks his head up and smiles at him, soft and open and – “John,” Sherlock says.  “Please – I, please – “
“Do you?”
“Of course not,” Sherlock says. “Cooking is dull. I ordered it.”
“Sherlock,” he repeats, voice firm, squeezing Sherlock’s forearms. The sirens are getting closer. “I told you, I’m
Just like Appledore, he’s acutely aware of every moment. It’s another experience in which all of his senses seem heightened. Time seems to stretch as he boards the plane, seconds turning to minutes turning to hours turning to years. Every step is carefully hidden agony. As the distance grows between he and John, so grow the cracks around the bundle of emotion he tries so hard to hide. He feels so close to losing control that it’s
They press their hips together again, the barrier of clothing removed from between them, and John moans into the kiss, eager for more, his nerve endings on fire at the touch of Sherlock’s cock to his own. He urges Sherlock down on the bed, and Sherlock sits on the edge, then shuffles back until he’s lying down, propped up on his elbows near the pillows so he can look at John.
Sherlock feels his cheeks heat, feels an incandescent smile bloom on his face. “Are you hungry? I know a good Chinese place that’s sure to be open.”
He lets his fingers card through John’s hair this time, the short strands silkier than he’d imagined, and then lets them drift over John’s back, exploring, feeling the warmth of John’s body underneath them. In all the times he’s imagined John like this, he’s never realized how warm he’d be, how pliant and solid and
Sherlock glances at the TV again, where a melodramatic voiceover talks about possible alien involvement while they show a slow motion, black and white pan of the landmark. “I went there when I was young,” he says.
“Quite,” Sherlock agrees.  “But it’s only a cupcake and Mary’s not even home.”
he wants more than anything to see Sherlock come undone, to take him apart, to know every part of him, to celebrate him, to worship him, to taste him, to have him, to be with him. “Let’s go to bed. Please,” he manages, desperation swirling inside of him.
and his new friend is in trouble. He looks around for a weapon, but sees nothing of use. Desperately, he stands, pulling his slipper off, and even though his heart is pounding in fear, he runs as fast as he can into the chaotic fight and throws it with all his might. It strikes the mouse king right in the chest and he falls over, then the nutcracker triumphantly finishes him off with his sword while the mutant mouse lets out an almighty screech and Sherlock can only stand beside the nutcracker and stare, his heart pounding.
It’s just a chaste brush of dry lips, quiet and soft but warm and perfect. It’s gentle, but Sherlock feels it down to his bones. He remains still, processing, and John pulls away and watches while Sherlock sits frozen with closed eyes. After a moment, Sherlock’s eyes fly open and he stares at John, searching, something wild in his expression, and John smiles. “Alright?” he asks, his voice a bit rougher than usual, anxiety in his expression he’s trying hard to mask.
Sherlock smiles a crooked smile, his eyes giving away none of his inner thoughts. “There are no coincidences in this world, Mary, only the inevitable. John must prepare for that.”
“Sherlock?” John asks. His heart is pounding and fear is clawing at him, making him break out in a cold sweat. “Sherlock, what – is this a dream?”
Sherlock thinks of how desperately he didn’t want John to see him holding Iris. He thinks of how desperately he doesn’t want to let her go, John’s presence or not. He thinks of the fact that he’s been the one to make the tea every single time since John’s come back home.
to know that I would have, in a heartbeat, if I ever thought – Do you know that? You – god, Sherlock, you
“I wonder what today’s weather will be like,” Sherlock suddenly interrupts, narrowing his eyes at the fortuneteller.
“They are,” John says. His voice is warm. “Come on, let’s get you to bed.”
“Didn’t realize it’d affect you like that,” John says, still stroking his fingers through Sherlock’s hair. “Should have.”
“You couldn't get a wand?” John asks.
“Be careful,” Sherlock says. “Don’t take anything from the top shelf.” He looks up just in time to see that his warning was too late, and John is dropping the container in his hands in alarm, and without thinking, Sherlock waves a hand and the container of pig intestine is back in the fridge where it belongs, not a drop spilled on the floor.
,” she says.
– is this – is this a dream?”
– says.
“No,” Mycroft answers. Sherlock glares at him.
“How’d you figure that?” John asks. “And you could shake my hand before it gets tired, you know.”
“So, are you some kind of mob boss?” Mary asks with narrowed eyes.
John kisses him softly, soothingly. His lips are warm and he presses them against Sherlock’s and Sherlock feels as though he’s melting, as if he could cry. His entire body feels as if it’s on fire and nothing he’d ever dared imagine this would be like compares to the reality of this feeling. John holds his lips still for a moment, just keeps a gentle, reassuring pressure against Sherlock’s, and then he shifts his head a bit.   Their noses bump, just a little, and it makes Sherlock’s heart skip a beat. John kisses him again, and this time, he lets his lips part. Sherlock feels the warmth of John’s breath against his lips and his own lips part easily, and then John kisses him again, and it’s smooth and sweet and it’s
As he watches, Molly closes her eyes. “It’s a nice name, though, John Watson. Your father’s.”
After a moment, John pulls away, wiping his eyes on the back of his hand. “Sherlock,” he says. “How are we – is this really you?”
It’s only Sherlock, though, and John stops and gapes in the doorway when he sees that Sherlock is in the kitchen putting groceries away. He’s just reaching up to put a tin of beans in the cabinet when he turns, looking over his shoulder at John. “Hello, John,” he says, as if everything he’s doing is perfectly normal.
As far as John can tell, it’s a regular hydrangea; light blue in color, big and bushy and thriving in the rain, which is still coming down heavily.
“Typical,” Sherlock says, rolling his eyes.
John jerks away, shocked by the sudden movement, his heart beating quickly in his chest.
And yet here he is, opening the door and going inside. He doesn’t know why this keeps happening to him, but his senses are on high alert again, trying to take in everything, and yet he can’t understand what’s happening.
“It is and it isn’t,” Sherlock says. He doesn’t let go of John.
“Mummy got you such a nice tie this year,” Mycroft says as he tightens the knot of the bright crimson tie embroidered with snowflakes.
He leaves the apartment and hurries down the stairs, opening the door to the street without being interrupted by Mrs. Hudson. Once outside, he looks back at 221B and wonders if he’s made all of this up; if he’s finally gone crazy.
Arthur shakes his head and turns to John with a fond smile. He pats John’s arm. “It’s all in the past,” he says. “Don’t worry about it. If he were still alive, though, I’d like to imagine he’d be something like you. You’re a good man, John, I can tell.”
“Enough!” Moriarty roars, his face twisted in anger and his voice suddenly harsh and demanding, the singsong lilt from earlier gone. He makes a jerking motion with his hand, and the entire web twists, pulling Sherlock’s arms and legs out. He grunts, and John’s hands twitch at his sides. He wants so badly to help, but he hasn't yet figured out how he can.
“Oh,” John says, thoughtful. “Boyfriend, then?”
“I’m a bit different from Sherlock and Mycroft,” Greg says. “I don’t do flashy things like they do. I can do the occasional bit of small telekinesis or things like that, nothing fancy.” He shrugs and takes a drag of his cigarette, which smells of regular tobacco, not like Sherlock’s special blend.
“That was amazing,” John says, in spite of how strange the whole situation is, and then he realizes he’s meant to answer a question. “Er, my birthday is the thirty-first of March,” he adds. “Why?”
“I don’t have time for tea,” John says. Despite the comfort of the couch, he starts to stand again, but Redbeard growls, pressing his pointy snout into John’s thigh and forcing him back down. “I have to find Sherlock!” John says, looking at Redbeard in something like betrayal.
Sherlock hums his agreement, then pauses for a moment before looking at John sharply. “So, what’s an ex-Auror doing working as a general Healer in St. Mungo’s? Isn’t that a bit boring for you?”
The man is sprawled out on the couch, wearing nothing but some loose satin trousers and a dressing gown of the same material. He’s smoking a long, elegant pipe, the likes of which John has never seen; it’s at least 20 centimeters long, with engravings along its narrow shaft and a small opening at the end. The man’s gown, tied haphazardly at his waist, is open to reveal most of his chest, the collar so loose that it’s settled just below his shoulders rather than his neck, revealing smooth, milky white skin. His legs extend from the confines of the gown to rest on the armrest, while the sharp angles of his peculiar face rest against an elaborate, tasseled pillow at the other end of the couch. His head is turned towards the door, though his body faces the ceiling, and he draws his pipe away from his mouth and slowly blows out a thin stream of smoke as he lazily regards John from beneath half-closed, hooded eyes.
John sighs. “Honestly, you’re bloody mad,” he says, but he has to admit Sherlock looks good. Possibly better than he does himself, which is really not on.
“Don’t be a git,” John murmurs, and his tone is so intimate that some of Sherlock’s anxiety melts away, and just like that, they’re kissing again, the atmosphere of the room changing abruptly. Sherlock has been craving this feeling since he felt it only hours ago, and it’s no less transcendent the second time around.
Sherlock shakes his head, stepping into the sitting room. “It’s fine,” he says. He thinks of watching John and Mary dance while he played his violin, of shooting Magnussen in the head, of seeing John’s face afterward, of leaving for a suicide mission. “You’d be surprised to know that I do, in fact, have some compassion,” he says. He tries to keep his voice light, but it doesn’t work.
“People are idiots,” John says. There’s an aggression in his voice that makes that familiar warmth in Sherlock’s stomach surge, and he doesn’t know what to say, warmed as he is.
It doesn’t reply, and John’s honestly not quite sure whether he’d been expecting it to or not, but it surges forward and presses what feels like a small kiss onto John’s cheek.
“It’s alright, dear, he’s just up here,” the woman says, gesturing towards a closed door at the top of a set of stairs. She smells of tea and scones, and she hasn’t stopped smiling since she opened the door. She seems kind, but John feels distinctly unsettled.
he feels in this strange flat with this strange old woman and even stranger man, he finds himself nodding, even though it seems like a bad idea to make a deal with Sherlock. “Yes.”
John shifts up to his toes again and kisses Sherlock once more. Sherlock closes his eyes, feels the sweet, chaste press of John’s lips against his, feels something in his heart melt and shift and rearrange, feels goosebumps wash over his skin, feels his hands smooth out over John’s back and pull him close, feels John shift back down to his feet as he breaks the kiss. Sherlock curls his arms around John’s back and holds him close, craning his neck down to bury his head beside John’s in favor of kissing him. He’s not sure he’s allowed to do this, but he can’t
Sherlock neglects mentioning that she was clearly planning to drop out because John will take that as him not caring when it’s simply a matter of the case. Instead, he says, voice sharper than he’d intended, “I meant that it’s typical for the news to talk about a rich, privileged girl in SoHo being killed rather than the hundreds of similar crimes that happen in neighborhoods no one wants to talk about.”
“A bit, yeah,” John says, self-deprecation coloring his tone.
, and Sherlock can only stare back at him, entranced. His fingers itch to coax more melodies out of his violin, to translate what he feels into sound because suddenly that language is a part of him again, singing inside of him, and he doesn’t know if he has words for this. Instead, he forces himself to turn away from John, from the facial expression he can’t parse right now, and he puts his violin in the case, cleaning it carefully, loosening his bow, putting it inside, his hands shaking as he goes through the familiar ritual, his mind buzzing.
Sherlock nods. “Who should –”
As soon as he’s outside, John flags down a taxi; he’s much too tired to walk. He sinks into the seat eagerly. He’s glad to be off his feet and able to relax for a moment.
Sherlock glances at him and tilts his head, blinking a bit. “You didn’t have a lot of friends growing up,” he says.
John laughs, but it’s not warm. He takes a long gulp of his beer, and then shakes his head. “A
“Really?” John asks, looking down at the tube. “Why does Mycroft have it?”
“Sherlock, are you-”
“Obviously,” Sherlock says, water dripping down his face, and John can’t help but grin.
“Would you stop playing for a minute and listen?” Mycroft asks, annoyed.
“Oh,” the old man says and laughs. His voice is thin but jovial. “I didn’t realize you were talking to me. Everybody ignores old people these days; maybe they’re afraid we’ll need help or something,” he says, chuckling to himself a bit. “You live here? Sorry I’m just standing outside your doorstep. I used to live on this street and I never noticed this building before,” he says. “I was just taking a look, trying to jog my memory.”
pajamas–”
His body jolts with the shock of it, and he blinks a few times to orient himself before he realizes that he’s standing in the park.  Mycroft is standing nearby, watching him with one eyebrow raised.  Mycroft has moved Sherlock to lie across a bench, and John hurries over and kneels beside Sherlock, his hands still wrapped around the warm, faintly glowing cupcake.
“Make some dinner while you’re at it!”
Mrs. Hudson frowns and reaches out, holding her frail hand against his arm. He feels doubt creeping in on him, but he shakes his head, thinking of Arthur alone on the bench, alone for so many years, alone like him.
“I want to sleep down here,” Sherlock says. “Will you stay until I sleep?”
Mary frowns and sits across from him in the furthest possible seat away.
“You did such a good job,” John tells him, voice soft and warm. “Christ, you’re brilliant. You’re so brilliant, Sherlock. Thank you.”
Before he knows it, he’s pressed into the lift, his eyes closed tightly against the prickly magic that surrounds him. The heavy pressure of hastily cast
“That’s a bit rude, mate,” Billy says from the table. If skulls could frown, John is quite sure Billy would be frowning.
John quirks a small smile and takes some plates and utensils out, carrying them into the living room with the bag of Chinese.
He makes jokes and he smiles. John doesn’t like emotional scenes, he knows that, so he keeps it light. He’ll do anything for John, after all. When he shakes John’s hand for the last time, though, their hands are clasped in a way that is so far from everything he wants that it’s painful despite his attempts to detach from the moment. The activity in his traitorous mind palace stills as the foundation holds and strengthens with this new memory: touch. He feels John’s skin against his, John’s hand warm and solid under his, John’s eyes boring into his, and everything around them disappears for a moment and it’s only
His skin is immediately crawling with all the magic once he’s arrived at St. Mungo’s. The
“We’ve still got more to do, we really shouldn’t linger,” Sherlock says with a tight smile, turning away from John to swim towards the shore. “Shall we go?”
Greg huffs a laugh. “Sounds like Sherlock,” he says with a grin. “Did you get the skull for him?”
John stares for a moment and pauses just inside the doorway, his brow furrowing in confusion, before shaking his head and going straight to his chair, sinking into it gratefully. “Have you just been sitting there waiting for me to come home?” he asks, his hand immediately finding his shoulder again and massaging it. He can’t help the twinge of pain that clouds his expression, but if Sherlock sees it, he doesn’t comment.
“Yours isn’t much better,” Sherlock says, grinning.
“I hardly ever get out of here,” Billy says. “I’ve spent the last three years locked away in a basement. The only people I ever see are you three. Don’t you think I get a little lonely sometimes?”
“I don’t want you to go,” Sherlock says.
For one moment, one terrifying, horrible moment, Sherlock is sure that the vice grip he keeps on the knot of emotions about John is going to slip. He’s terrified that things he cannot say will spill forth from his lips.
Mary smiles, but it doesn’t reach her eyes. “When you put it that way…” she says. She’s quiet for a moment and she hesitates, still standing in his doorway, but then she turns and follows him as he heads down the hall. “You’re in a good mood,” she says as she catches up with him.
Sherlock is trembling and he needs John, needs to be near him. He lets go of John’s hands and he pushes against the arm rests of the chair and moves forward until he’s sliding off the chair entirely, sliding down to the floor, reaching for John, burying his face in John’s neck, clinging to him, still trembling, still breathing hard.
“I mean what I said, and I don’t care to repeat myself,” Sherlock says.
Sherlock blinks, looking anywhere but John. He feels uncomfortably self conscious and over-aware of every part of his body. John’s grip on his arm softens, and Sherlock’s heart is pounding.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, finally looking away from Redbeard to look at John. “I was never a ‘little bugger,’” he says scornfully, and John snorts a laugh. “Also, I wasn’t the way I am now five minutes ago, was I? And you knew me then.”
“Touché,” John says, but he seems amused rather than offended, and a relieved smile stretches across Sherlock’s face, something settling in his chest that he didn’t know was unsettled.
He closes his eyes and remembers the feeling of John’s thumb soothing against the vulnerable skin of the underside of his wrist for the very first time, remembers the fear he felt when they stood together in the living room, remembers the first touch of John’s lips against his. Lost in the sensory memory, he thinks of nothing but John as he begins to play the second movement.
“I missed out on so much of your life,” she says. “But I’m here now, aren’t I? Come on, John, come with me. Everything will be fine.”
Sherlock takes Redbeard in his hand and holds him out to John. “Here,” he says.
“Anyway,” John says after a moment, grinning in amused disbelief while Sherlock continues to look at him askance. “
“Hello,” the man says. His voice is deep and silky, and the word is stretched, drifting into the atmosphere between them like the sweet smoke coming from his pipe.
He leans up, going onto his toes, tilting his head upwards. Their eyes meet for just a second, and Sherlock’s widen when he realizes what’s going to happen. John smiles the tiniest bit, feels Sherlock’s breath against his lips, and presses their lips together. It’s light at first; chaste. Sherlock’s lips are soft and supple against his own. He holds their mouths together for a moment then pulls away, just a little. He presses a small kiss to the corner of Sherlock’s mouth and looks up at him. Sherlock’s breath is coming faster and his hands settle against John’s waist, pulling him closer despite the fear in his eyes. John can feel how fast Sherlock’s heart is beating, and he pulls his head down again.
“I’m not happy he got hit by a bloody truck!” John says.
“It’s…a lot of the time, when I see them, I think how nice it would be if they would just leave me alone,” John admits.
“Hmm,” John says.
Mrs. Hudson is still silent, holding her tea tray as she watches, and John feels trapped under Sherlock’s gaze. “Why?” he asks.
, and John’s never seen them this way.
“Alright?” John asks.
“Many things,” Sherlock replies. “In this case, exactly how strong is your gateway to the spirits? Exactly how hard will you work?”
“I brought Chinese,” John calls. “You’re eating it.” He peeks into the living room and sees Sherlock wave a lazy hand through the air in what John assumes is acquiescence, not moving from the couch.
She looks up at him, and her eyes are big and blue and full of tears.  She sniffles, but doesn’t take her eyes away from him.  He kneels down next to her, using his gentlest doctor face.  “What’s wrong?  Are you hurt?” he asks, trying to project warmth and sympathy.
Sherlock blinks and looks away. He thinks of playing his violin for John and Mary, of realizing that life moved on without him, of realizing the true depths of his mistakes. He thinks of a thin, dingy mattress, of needles and release. “There was little point,” he murmurs.
He’s never begged for something like this, he’s never
“It was really amazing,” Mary says.  She steps away from John, pulling her arm away from his, and shakes Sherlock’s hand.  “Congratulations, Sherlock,” she says.
,” Sherlock says, agitated. “He never texts. He said there was an accident, and you were in hospital.” Magic is crawling over his skin, and his head feels as if it’s going to crack open.
