“They did all the market research, all the correct due diligence so that it won't look suspicious if people poke about. The film sounds crazy, but then Hannah said they signed up you and Anna, and who was going to question it then? Two legitimate stars brought together for the first time.”
“How is it, no matter what happens, you can always count on angels to be dicks?” Dean chipped in.
“Is this not tipping into
Dean’s bottom jaw dropped a little. “I… would you be okay with that?”
“Basically, yeah,” Castiel agreed. “It was one of my dumber plans, and in fact, one of my least useful skills. Turns out, most places? You can't just rock up and start fishing.”
“With your clumsy ass? I’ve got it covered. Plus I need to leave something for Claire to do when she gets back past curfew again.”
“Um, try not to eat it all at once, okay, kid? My brother Sam did that once and um, it did not end well.”
Castiel kissed him on the nose and smoothed down his hair. “That’s one way of putting it.”
It was a wink Dean was starting to grow irritated with as it usually meant Gabriel was lying about something, such as “We just need
“Yeah?”
“The home, the family, the...”
agent had been smart enough to know that clauses for events such as this were required. Dean's agent and lawyer, meanwhile, had only ever had to deal with his movie franchise contracts in the past, and they'd all been mostly standard after the first film.
“How about ice cream and pie?”
“Well, if you insist.”
“There was just something about you,” Dean clarified. “I just felt so connected to you.”
“Grrrummpphh,” Dean agreed. His eyes were shut so he could fully enjoy the sensations. He'd always enjoyed having his hole played with. He was slowly rocking himself backwards and forwards in tiny increments so that he could fuck himself on Castiel's fingers.
“This car is a classic!” Dean shot Sam a hurt look.
“I… we… can’t keep expecting this of him,” Castiel’s voice cracked slightly. “We’re all he has, and we’re too busy to see him.”
“Maybe I should start doing appraisals,” Castiel pondered. “It’d be a good way to tell them all how they need improving and get their feedback on how things are going.”
“And I love you enough to time travel ten times over, apparently.”
Donna grabbed her phone. “Fine, I'll order, but if anyone asks, I'm blaming you two.”
“I just find it hilarious!” Dean snickered. “The film was nonsense yet the critics and bloggers seemed to love it. Like they've never heard of
Castiel knew a place nearby they walked over to. Sam wondered if it counted as a walk of shame when he didn’t, in fact, feel any shame.
“I'm a
Maybe that was the problem. He'd been doing films with his brother and a cast and crew who had become his second family.
“We’ve lost sight of what we were trying to achieve, Sam.”
Preview ticket sales for the film have jumped through the roof since news of Dean Winchester's off-screen relationship to Castiel (no last name, how
“Goodnight,” Sam rushed to say, relieved Castiel would finally be leaving.
At least the press they'd done already, no one had seen a full version of the film. But after this, there would be reviews.
“Dean. I couldn’t ask that of you.”
Sam smiled and huffed air out his nose. That was the Dean he knew. “Is Cas talking to you?”
Dean nodded and finished the last bite of his cereal. “You sure?”
“No. Well, it would be helpful since you’re already here.” Sam looked up at Dean hopefully but shook his head when he saw the look on Dean’s face. “But no. Definitely not.”
in the morning silence. The door was slightly ajar, so he pushed through to see the TV on and Dean sitting on the couch. Sam could have sworn that he recognized the show, from some article or meme that he saw online. Finally it clicked.
“Dean, something else’s keeping it here!”
Dean took a deep breath. “Cas, you’re my only happy ending. It’s you.” It was a revelation. “And I want a happy ending. I want a happy ending so bad it hurts.” Dean moved his hands to grip his trench coat by the lapels. “I’ve fought for it. I’ve died for it. I need the sun to set, Cas. I need you to be by my side when it does.”
“I’ve already said yes, no need to keep selling,” Dean said, then hesitated. “So long as I get to stay behind the wheel.”
“That would be smart.”
Dean only had to turn his head slightly to see them.
He sang
“My phone stopped working a while ago.” Castiel pulled it out of his pocket. “It no longer turns on.”
“No.” Sam laughed. “No, before that. Were you… saying grace?”
Castiel gave an angel’s impression of an eye roll. “Dean Winchester, are you willing to give your body and mind over to my cause?”
In the blink of an eye, Castiel appeared. This time, he was lying in the bed next to Dean, under the covers in three layers of clothing. Dean felt underdressed in his pajama pants and old band shirt. The two men were lying on their sides and looking right at each other. Dean thought about telling him to give him some space, but it didn’t matter. He wasn’t physically there.
Sam looked confused for a second before realization dawned on him. “Cas took over for a few minutes. He told me that everything is going according to plan. It will take a few hours for you to get ‘attuned’ enough to communicate. Whatever that means.”
The group eventually made their way through saying farewells and Rowena left, leaving Dean and Castiel alone. Dean was tense. It was hard for him to think of Castiel’s body as just an empty husk to be filled.
Dean tensed in his seat and checked his surroundings a few times to comfort himself. He was in the Impala with Sam.
Without thinking, Dean wove his fingers together on his lap and lowered his head. He sat in relative silence, mouthing something inaudible under his breath.
“Here, put these over your ears.” Dean grabbed the headphones on instinct. They felt solid in his hands. The feeling stopped him in his tracks. “I can touch this?”
Castiel seemed to realize where he was for the first time. “Are you about to take a shower?”
“Lovely,” she said, making it clear that she thought that it was anything but. “She must have been a powerful one then, if the spell is surviving past her.”
“It’s all in your brain, Dean.” Castiel set the walkman body on the bathroom counter and took the headphones from Dean. Dean felt the soft brush of his fingers as he did. “The same brain that is letting you see and hear illusions can let you feel them too.”
“What’s the verdict, Doc?”
He heard a muffled, “Let me know how it goes!” from through the door and continued down the hall. Dean was vaguely grateful that Sam didn’t want to be in the room for it, but he didn’t care to examine why.
Dean laughed dryly and shook his head, looking away again. “This is weird, man. I feel like Jamie Lee Curtis.”
Dean felt the tips of his ears begin to burn as he remembered what he had just been doing. He cleared his throat and changed the subject. “So what, you’ve been busy reading my thoughts?”
Castiel finally met his gaze again. “I can remain unobstructive while we share a vessel.”
Castiel still didn’t look convinced. Dean sighed.
The drug reference gave Castiel pause. “The process shouldn’t be painful. It may feel uncomfortable at times as your body attunes to housing a celestial being. You may experience sensations that the human body is not equipped to feel.”
“Of course, Dean.” Castiel leaned imperceptibly closer to him. “I would never strip you of your autonomy.”
It was as if he had a whole new sense awakened in him. How could you explain sight to someone who was born blind? He felt his thoughts being pushed to the side to make space in his head for another entity. His body went blank for a moment before he scrambled to gain control. The feeling, which had to be Castiel, let him gather it up from the corners of his awareness. His limbs were left feeling like they fell asleep. He compressed Castiel to right at the base of his neck, behind his collarbones. He felt raw energy thrumming in the back of his mind.
“Dude, come on. You stink so bad,” Sam said.
There were sigils and graffiti painted all over the walls. He knew those sigils. He painted them with Bobby.
Castiel began to rise into a sitting position as he returned to Jimmy Novak’s body. Dean subconsciously trailed after the white smoke as it left his mouth, closing the distance between him and Castiel’s true vessel. They both inched closer to contact as the cloud that was Castiel transferred between them.
“Well,” Rowena paused as she thought. She pursed her lips, choosing her words carefully. “It was a homemade spell designed to erase an angel’s grace. It starts slow, which must be why you can’t feel it yet. It will continue to get faster and faster as time goes on.”
It had been a few days.
Sam quickly glanced at him, keeping his attention on the road. “I don’t really know. Cas took over to kill the ghost and clean up, but then he just sat silently in the car. It was creepy.” Sam shrugged. “I just said something when you started to snore.”
Dean barked out a short laugh to distract from thinking about it too much. “Thanks for the fine print. Anything I should be on the lookout for?”
“I’m going to grab a beer, want one?” Dean called over his shoulder as he headed towards the kitchen.
Dean gave him an awkward thumbs up. “Just close your eyes and listen for a few minutes.”
Castiel nodded and put the hex bag in the inside pocket of his trench coat.
Castiel looked at it fondly. “How do I use it?”
“No, I—”
Sam’s eyebrows shot up. “And you’re gonna do that? Leave your vessel, I mean.”
He could make out someone walking over to him from the shadows.
Castiel flipped through the pages. He smiled. “Have you ever read the Bible, Dean?”
Dean suddenly remembered what situation he had just escaped from. “Wait a minute, if you’re here, who’s handling my body?”
“So what, right before he starts to rot away?”
“Plugged it into what?”
“I’m not, physically speaking.” Castiel lifted his arms to show off his form. “I’m a visual representation constructed by your mind.” He looked down at himself. “I’m surprised. It normally takes months for seraphim to harmonize with their vessel’s brainwaves enough to present themselves without the aid of a reflection like this.”
Dean felt his cheeks heat up. “Please.”
“You’ve got nothing to worry about, man.” Dean tried to backtrack. “Chicks dig the whole dorky, just rolled out of bed look.”
He stood in front of the mirror awkwardly for a moment, unsure how to broach the subject.
Dean hopped in the shower. He gave a sigh of relief when he finally pulled the curtain back, blocking Castiel from his line of sight. He could pretend like it was any other day. The water hit him like rain.
Movement came from the couch. “Don’t be too loud, you’ll wake up Dean.”
A breath escaped Dean’s lungs. Castiel had to know what he was doing when he said things like that.
“It should be all rewinded and everything. Just press the play button.” After a moment, Dean added, “It’s the triangle.”
Dean carried the chair to the side of the bed and sat in it. It was strange to see Castiel laying down. The only other times that Dean had seen him in this position, he was bloodied from a fight. Castiel moved his arms to lie down completely, turning his head on the pillow to look at Dean.
Castiel blinked into existence again when he opened the door to his room. Dean turned on the light (thanking Sam for replacing the lightbulbs) to see him staring at his prone body from where he was standing at the foot of the bed.
“Um…” Sam floundered for words for a moment, suddenly struck by the strangeness of the situation. “Do you want any coffee? I’m starting a pot.”
Dean scoffed. “What, me worry?” He sighed and grabbed his keys from where they were sitting on the nightstand. “Let’s get back to the bunker before you do anything crazy.”
“You can’t mean that.” Castiel didn’t seem to be impressed.
“I see.” Castiel relaxed his arms and allowed his gaze to trail up to the ceiling. “I never understood human beauty standards. I have a hard time evaluating my vessel.”
Rowena sighed. “Aye, the spell’s not built for fixing.”
Sam was walking to the kitchen in the early hours of the morning when he heard sound coming from Dean’s lounge (which Sam refused to call
“I’m serious.” Castiel’s voice compelled Dean to look him in the eyes. “I would not think any less of you for changing your mind in the eleventh hour.”
Castiel gave him a thumbs up back. “I’ll just… um…” He looked around for a place to be while Dean undressed. He pulled the headphones off for a second. “Where should I go?”
Dean held his breath. He was transfixed, completely and utterly.
Castiel’s eyes tracked Dean’s movements. “What do you mean?”
no matter how many times Dean threatened to cut his hair off). He changed course to investigate, his socked feet making soft
Castiel nodded.
The nighttime was when it felt truly bizarre. Dean had to lay in bed and try to fall asleep, knowing that Castiel was just a sharp inhale away. He had been tossing and turning for almost an hour. Angels didn’t sleep, so Castiel must have been just watching this all happen. He couldn’t fall asleep if he thought about it.
Dean nodded while spreading peanut butter on a piece of bread. “I feel like I ran a freakin’ marathon.” He ran his thumb on the side of the knife to gather the remaining peanut butter and stuck it in his mouth. “I’m gonna eat a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, eat another, down a beer, and then crash for the night.”
“Sure, maybe one that a dog just peed in.” Sam chuckled under his breath. “Maybe you can ask Cas to zap you clean.”
“The mission I used her for ended and I returned to the celestial plane.” Castiel continued to avoid Dean’s eyes. “Her heaven is beautiful. She spends her time in an eternal Saturday sunset on a picnic with her soulmate.” Castiel finally looked at him. “Dorothy.”
“You’re my friend, Cas.” Dean’s hand reached out to pat him on the shoulder before he realized that it was too far away to reach. For lack of a better location, he patted Castiel’s thigh where it was resting on the bed. “Friends help each other out.”
“Pretend I’m here physically,” Castiel said, not mentioning the jedi mind tricks he was no-doubt pulling. “Show me how to use the walkman.”
Dean chuckled at his own humor as he walked to his bedroom to grab a fresh set of clothes. Once he realized that he needed a shower, everything felt uncomfortable. It would be nice to get under the bunker’s perfect water pressure again.
Sam looked different. It looked like someone had taken a long exposure photograph of him while he was moving. There was a glow to his body that made it look like he was radioactive. It made Dean feel like he was burning. He screwed his eyes shut.
The case was supposed to be a simple salt-and-burn for a ghost that had been spotted a few times in a Topeka graveyard. Just a quick day trip. Everything was going according to plan until… Well, Dean’s neck hurt. Thankfully, they had dug up the grave before the ghost showed up. Double thankfully, the ghost’s attention was entirely on Dean.
Castiel’s eyebrows drew together even more. “You think I’m ugly?”
Castiel tilted his chin up and inhaled as he thought. “You have a higher white blood cell count than Jimmy. Your cholesterol is higher than his as well.” He paused. “You also have more” —he squinted his eyes slightly as he decided on a word to use— “brightness to your vessel.”
Castiel smiled at him before dissolving into Dean’s reflection. Dean lifted his hand and rubbed his face, watching his reflection follow his movements exactly. Everything was back to normal. He nodded at the empty mirror and turned on his heel to start his day.
“And how long’s that gonna take?” Dean asked.
Instead of the half-made peanut butter and jelly sandwich that Dean was making, there was now a plate of two completed sandwiches (cut into triangles) and an opened bottle of one of Dean’s favorite beers, fresh from the fridge. Dean’s stomach growled.
Sam changed the subject. “Good job on dinner, by the way. Thanks for making it.”
“Woah, I—” Dean fought out a breath.
Dean was sufficiently cowed. “What, too soon?”
Sam walked into the room from the direction of his bedroom. “What the hell, Dean?” he said. “You can’t just text me, ‘Cas got witched. Be back before midnight.’ and then not respond.”
Castiel closed his eyes for a moment, opening them to meet Sam’s gaze. “He is currently dreaming about being in a high school musical theatre program. I assume that on some level, he is processing the show alongside me.”
Castiel replied casually, “Ask you what?”
“I’ll do an examination of the vessel before I return.” Castiel watched Dean wipe the milk off his lip. “But I believe so.”
Dean stepped aside so that Sam could enter the room. Sam flicked the lightswitch a few times but the room stayed dark. He looked at Dean accusingly.
“What can I say? I got my go-go juice.”
“Is that…
Sam rolled his eyes and shifted his focus to Castiel. “I tried calling Cas, but it went straight to voicemail.”
“You’re going to need to leave your vessel,” she finally said.
Rowena sighed. “You’re not going to like it.”
He didn’t sleep a wink.
“Me? Peachy.” Dean pushed himself up into a sitting position. “How’s Hotel Dean? Do I need to call housekeeping?”
Sam frowned. “Are you okay?”
“Dean?”
Dean hummed an affirmation. He tried to think of something that Castiel would like. He closed his eyes shut and imagined Castiel holding it.
Dean and Castiel both leveled Rowena with steady stares. She closed her eyes to center herself before speaking again, opening them to look at Castiel.
Rowena laughed drily. “Have you got a better idea, then?”
Castiel didn’t say anything, choosing instead to close the distance between Dean and him. For a second, Dean thought—
He heard cracks of lightning. Castiel was no longer looking at him, deciding to move his gaze to something behind him.
“Dude, you need to get a sleep apnea machine.” Sam laughed from where he was sitting behind the steering wheel. “You sound like an airplane.”
Castiel was a deer caught in headlights. He scrambled off the bed and started moving away.
He pointed at the now-covered toilet. “Sit here. Turn the volume up.”
Dean raised his eyebrows at Sam. “Weren’t you the one who just talked to him?”
“Huh.” Sam leaned back in his chair for a moment. “So will you just” —he waved his hand through the air nervously— “float around all day?”
Thank God that Dean’s tastebuds were still working. If he started tasting molecules instead of flavors, he would have to kick Castiel out. He piled his plate up high with the chicken alfredo that he spent the past few hours cooking. Sam had already served himself a plate of the pasta before Dean added the chicken and was sitting at the kitchen table, reading something on his laptop with one hand while he ate with the other. Dean grabbed some silverware and sat down across from him.
The tendril of Castiel finally reached Dean’s lips. For a moment, it felt like he had used TV static as chapstick. The static feeling filled Dean’s throat. It spread over his head and spilled down his chest as more of Castiel flowed through him. It felt like the borders of his body were being erased, like he was expanding to fill the bedroom. His head was floaty and blurry, as if he was back to being seventeen and smoking Js with other nomads outside of run-down hotels.
“You’re an angel,” Dean said, flexing his fingers. “I’m sure you can dumb it down for me.”
Dean was lying awake in his bed sometime between day two and day three when he finally asked it.
Dean thought as he put a few feet of distance between him and the bed.
Castiel was cut off by Dean re-entering the room, holding three beers. “Brewski time!” he called, waggling the beers with one hand. He put a beer in front of Sam and Castiel, then took one of the open seats at the table and took a swig from his own bottle.
“Yeah, you love it when I tell you what to do.” Sam checked the mirrors dutifully. “How’s Cas?”
Dean’s reflection avoided eye contact. “I understand that humans are very protective of their genitalia. I apologize. I did not intend to—”
As if reading his thoughts, Dean’s reflection changed to Jimmy Novak, trenchcoat and all.
“Of course not,” Dean backtracked immediately. “I’m sure you’re, y’know, good looking. For a guy.” Dean would have to change the subject if he didn’t want Castiel to notice his blushing cheeks. “It’s just something people say.”
The words rang in the silence of the night. “What’s it like needing a vessel?”
“My vessel,” Castiel clarified. “How would you like it to be positioned while I’m away?”
“I assume you wish to have privacy,” Castiel said.
“Cas.” A growl came out of Dean’s throat and he rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands. “Whatever it is you’re doing, man, you need to pull up. This is too much.”
Dean forgot what he was going to say. His mouth was suddenly dry. He licked his lips and broke eye contact. He could still feel the weight of Castiel’s gaze.
Castiel had planned on whipping up a pot of spaghetti with pesto for dinner, he’d been on an Italian food kick the last few days.  And he would’ve had it done just in time for Dean to get home had he not gotten distracted.  Looked like grilled cheese and leftover manicotti would make up their bounty tonight.
“Fuck,
Castiel’s eyes rolled back into his head as a full-body shudder wracked through him, “S-Sweetheart—Daddy’s not gonna last much longer,” he groaned.
at myself.  I wanted to help you and--fuck, I’m sorry I didn’t.”
Dean’s head tips in a gentle laugh, white teeth flashing in the light, “Cuddle, huh?  I don’t know, Cas, it’s already--” His eyes glance over to the nightstand, “seven o’clock.  Jack’s gonna be up in a half an hour and I wanted to get the spare part in Baby before it gets too hot out.  Plus, now that I’m awake...I can hear the coffee pot callin’ my name.”
“‘Yes’ indeed,” the bites start to drag lower, finally abandoning Dean’s raw nipples to make criss crosslines down his exposed belly.  It’s humid breath and the electric zap at each new sensation.
too invested in this thing.  It’s a million-year-old story, for crying out loud.  It’s not even about him, anyway.
“‘Buddy’.  You call me that a lot, too,” this time Cas’s small smile spreads across his face like butter on golden toast.
“At least buy me a drink first.”
His eyes double-take.
With each stroke, Castiel’s palms spreads more and more pre-come over the throbbing flesh.  Each pass becomes slicker, Dean’s hips and Castiel’s fist working in tandem to set a pace.  A solid hand skims Castiel's arm, tracing lines on its way down.  Tingles are left in its wake and he feels bubbly in his stomach--he already knows where his husband is headed.  Sure enough, Dean’s warm grasp settles on the hand that’s pumping him.  He shudders and holds Castiel’s fingers tightly under his own.
But there’s something missing.  Dean closes his eyes, trying to picture it, all of it.  Recliner, flannel, beer cans.  His dad, John Winchester, had a shock of dark hair almost the same color as Cas’s.  Recliner, flannel, beer cans, black hair…
His friend’s red-rimmed gaze meets his. Cas nods, his fingers trembling as they continue to card through Jack’s hair.
,” Sammy’s grip tightens minutely, and his Adam’s apple bobs once, twice, before he takes in a slow breath.  Dean can’t see much while not looking at their faces, but he’d bet a million dollars the puppy eyes are set to stun, “Please.  J-Just...let me talk to him.”
“Y-Yeah, sure.  Worth a shot, right?”
princess, Daddy,” She adds, nuzzling against the crook of his neck, “Only Daddy’s princess.”
Cas presses in even closer as their lips meet, sliding together with warm breath dusting their cheeks. It’s a long moment that Dean gets lost in, any of the day’s tension releasing from his muscles.
Dean’s eyes sting and he squeezes them to try and ward off the swelling in his throat.  This is ridiculous, it isn’t like any of this was new information. But...well, Dean just never realized how badly he actually needs to hear the words.
“Second finger,” Cas says—lower than Dean can ever remember the other’s voice being.
“I think you’re going to be happy with your decision, love,” Cas says, dotting a gentle line of kisses from his shoulder blade to his waist and rubbing a soothing hand over his hairy thigh, “Now, can you spread your legs a little wider for me?  Good boy.”
“What’s this, sweetheart?” Castiel’s feet carried him closer and closer of their own volition, like a cartoon rascal floating toward the scent of a pie cooling on the windowsill.  Both a sticky sweet treat waiting to be devoured.
Dean’s nose scrunches a little at the smell.
He’s not sure--he never can be--but he’s pretty certain it’s only been a handful of days since the police were here.  Two weeks at most since, if he wasn’t too busy focusing on not shitting his pants, Dean could probably count out on exactly how many nights it’s been.  But that look on Luc’s broad face--whatever’s happening, it’s happening
“Is that where you go?”
“N-N-No, I didn’t--” Tremors are visible as they shake down the kid’s small frame, his head bowed and his fists balled in the hem of his own t-shirt now, “I-I-I-I--”
Cas kneaded Dean’s scalp with their fingertips with one hand, causing Dean’s eyes to roll back into his skull, while the other released Dean’s wrist and tugged down the front of their boxers.  The rush of cool air over Cas’s pulsing flesh made their skin sing, “Alright, love.  You may.”
This morning, Dean squints through his first few blinks.  His sleep was deep and dreamless and leaves him perfectly stone-like under the thick comforter.  Shifting from side to side, it only takes a second for the off-ness to push into his mushy brain.
Cas hardly gets to the part where Castiel storms the gates of Hell before the kid’s eyes finally flutter shut, and all his muscles seem to go slack at the same time.
He’s gotta know.
“Do you need more lube?”
“Oh, fuck--
In the blink of an eye Dean’s arms had snaked out to wrap around Castiel’s shoulders.  His low groan vibrated against Castiel’s chest, the grip of shaking fingers tightening in his dress shirt.
turn me on.  Especially not because your body is going through some normal, healthy changes.  I love you so much and the only time I refuse to have sex with you is after you eat those disgusting garlic and onion fries from Biggerson’s, okay?”
It wasn’t unusual for Dean to get a little emotional during or after a scene.  It had taken a while--and a few conversations with his husband--for Castiel to realize that Dean could get overwhelmed by the ‘warm and fuzzies’ (as he called them) pretty easily when they were scening.  The smoothest way forward was
Cas snakes a hand into Dean’s as soon as they’d left the bar, and Dean had stuffed their joined hands in his jacket pocket as soon as the breeze had picked up.  Okay, so maybe it’s a little too sappy for a mysterious-werewolf-lover scene, but the soft look Cas gets in their eyes at the gesture is it’s own reward.
Sheriff Mills pokes her soft eyes and smile in, “Just checking to make sure you boys are alright.”
” Cas nips and kisses at his jaw, working their way to tongue at the shell of his ear.
“I’ve been calling you the wrong name for
Dean barely has a chance for his internal sirens to start up again before his other five senses decide to chime in.  He can smell something floating up the stairs.  Something cinnamon-y.
“Cas!” Jack squeals, grabbing the cordless and squeezing it like it’s Cas’s hand, “I miss you so much, Cas!  We went to the beach and Dean took a lot of pictures to show you—you’d love the beach, Cas, it’s so pretty!  The water was really cold but Dean held my hand so that was okay and then we started listening to Pink Boys in the car and I also got a piece of a shell at the beach—it was all tangled up in seaweed, so Sam washed it off for me and—Oh =!  Sam and I watched a movie called
, baby boy…”
He only gets out half of a relieved sigh when one
Cas administers another light smack to the meat of Dean’s ass, his hole clenching around their tongue, a bone-deep shiver wracking through his body.  Cas kneads at his rosy cheek and draws back.
“We can certainly do that if you’d like,” his friend hums him.  His lips move an inch lower, just to the underside of Dean’s jaw, making him shiver, “But...Jack is asleep with headphones on right now, and if we’re quiet…”
“Does that feel good, sweetheart?” His fist wraps around her, moving in quick, slippery strokes.  Deanna trembles, hips stuttering between pushing back onto his cock and moving into his hand.  A choked moan vibrates through her back and against his chest.
“Yeah!” Deanna exclaims, green pools glancing shyly down, “And--And I really like the crown.  It’s sparkly and has a heart!”
Dean can almost hear a crack like thunder when Sam’s head snaps up to beam laser eyes into his skull.  Dean still doesn’t look up.
Cas nods.

If this is something seriously triggering to you, you can skip the section between [Luc] "Holding his arms wide open, he smirks." to "'I think--' Cas says."

“No, no,
That’s the first thing Dean’s
Pain from all the leftover bruises that are hidden under his t-shirt has dull throbs radiating across his body, but Dean can’t find two shits to give.  He’ll take any pain that comes with this because his
Dean wants to scrub off the flush that’s creeping up his neck but...he also kinda likes the way it feels.
“Mhmm?” Dean hums.  Have his muscles ever felt this relaxed?
“I mean just think about it, you’re opening someone up and stuffing another body part inside them--why would anyone even want to try that?  How can that feel good to anybody?”
“Sweetheart?” Castiel carefully held anything even remotely commanding out of his tone, “What’s your color?”
Jack’s hands skim the bed next, feeling the fabric of the sheets and the heavy blanket over top of everything.  His eyes flash back up and he makes his way over to Dean, side-eyeing Mary before tugging at the hem of Dean’s t-shirt.
A resounding smack rings in the air as Luc's first blow lands across Cas’s bony ass.  Cas goes stiff as a sharp inhale and yelp are cut short.
Even if Luc just wants to beat him, he’ll kill him.  Just accidentally, he’ll do it.  If all those cuts open again...and Cas loses too much blood…Dean will have to watch Luc carry his corpse back out of the basement the way it entered: wrapped in that stupid fucking blanket and slung over Luc’s shoulder.
Dean slides one of the remaining tapes in and turns the volume almost off--just enough to clear his head.  He stands up from the bed and nearly topples over again when his legs don’t want to work right away and black dots burst at the edge of his vision.  He hisses through his teeth at the sharp fuzziness in his knees, propping himself at the edge of the mattress.  Dean waits until his eyes clear and he can wiggle his toes again.  He tentatively steps onto his feet and, when his legs are only a little wobbly, he goes to the sheet and rubs its corners between his fingers.  It’s fully dry.
Dean snorts, blinking his eyes open though he’s not sure when he closed them.
“On it,” like a switch flicking in his brain, Dean goes into damage control mode.  Taking care of injuries, protecting someone who Luc has also hurt--this he can do.  He can be useful this way.
“No, no, I swear--
Dean isn’t even aware he’d napped until his eyes slide open and his stomach gives a hungry garble.  He combs through the dark bedhead that his fingers had tangled in at some point.  Light little breaths make his skin tingle at the warmth where his friend’s soft lips softly snore against him.  He might not have been able to save Cas last night, but he can’t help but wondering if maybe he saved Cas a little bit this morning.
).  That too was set on the recliner.
“How long have you been wanting to say that?” It’s easier to examine his friend’s shirt, so that’s what Dean does as he shrugs.  He curses the way his lower lip quivers as Cas’s thumb traces over it.  The other boy’s voice is as light as his touch as he says, “Please tell me it hasn’t been since Jack first arrived,” Dean shrugs again, if he says a word he just knows that the lump in his throat will choke him out and it will all spill over his cheeks, “Dean?”
He looks at the cheap-ass cover of the notebook again with its generic picture of a frog.  He doesn’t remember writing in this one at all.  The beginning pages are a smattering of dice game scores and halves of grocery lists, things Luc must’ve written in it before he forgot about it in the basement.  Before he’d ever bulldozed into Dean’s life.
Dean buries his smile in his friend’s shoulder, an honest-to-God giggle passing his lips as he says, “Well, then I ain’t gonna stop you.”
, yes, Daddy,” Dean whined, loosely closed eyes fluttering open.  A coy grin spread like honey butter over his baby boy’s features.  Castiel arched a brow in the way that Dean had admitted made his knees weak and was rewarded with a fine shiver under his hands, “I have another surprise for you…”
Green eyes turned glassy and Dean buried his face into Castiel’s t-shirt.  He let out small breathy sounds like he was trying to hold back, “
“Yes, Daddy.”
“Well,” Cas begins, glancing at Dean, “Are you hungry, Jack?  Would you like some water maybe?”
, actually.”
“I know what you mean, I--well, let’s just say that just about every goddamn little noise you make is music to my ears.”
Dean’s eyes go wide, sparking in the low light.  His tongue slides over his bottom lip and Cas’s thumb traces in its slick wake, “Options?”
“I said
Dean doesn’t dare write what him and Cas talk about doing if the police ever do come back.  Let alone all the half-cocked ideas of escape that they throw around in the pitch black with Jack snuggling in his sleep beside them.  If Luc ever got it in his head to read this thing…
“C’mere,” Cas murmurs, starting to pull Dean toward their bed.  Panic starts to bubble up Dean’s stomach.  Cas can’t want...
That’s the last thing Dean wants, and the sick fuck knows it.  He squeezes harder.
She holds her head up but tangles her arms around the arm of his offered hand instead.  Dean’s certainly not gonna complain.
Dean buries his head in Cas’s neck when he feels tears burning his eyes.  They rut together,  all of the adrenaline-laced energy thrumming through Dean’s body finally having a direction to go.  Castiel is murmuring little assurances but mostly just kissing the side of Dean’s head, matching Dean’s motions, and holding the hunter tightly.
Drawing his fingers back out, he slathers on another generous coat of lube.  Pushing the extra lube in, Castiel give her two more teasing slides to be sure that every inch of her is completely slick.  Castiel shoves down his zipper, tugging his jeans and boxers just past his sensitive areas.  The last squirt of lube goes into his hand this time, and Castiel doesn't waste much time coating himself up.  The cool slip-slide of his fist feels like drinking water in a desert.  A groan from deep in his chest bubbles out and Castiel squeezes the plump flesh of Deanna’s thigh.
His chest is still stretched so tight, his limbs still a shaky heap when Cas draws back slightly to kiss each of his cheeks.
Cas is moving into Dean’s space in an instant, wrapping his arms around the older boy and drawing him into Cas’s warm body.  Placing a small kiss just behind his ear, Cas murmurs and hushes Dean who knows he’s squeezing way too hard but physically can’t let go.
Dean balances the player on Cas’s hip and fumbles to figure out where to slide on the headphones over Cas’s wild hair.  He counts the nub of each button until he feels the bottom one--the ‘play’ button.  As the familiar chords break the quiet, Dean hums.  Nothing like his Robert to bring some sunshine to his soul.
Blood is rushing in Dean’s ears and he does
Cas hums and Dean was drawn into those ocean blue eyes like a tractor beam.
Minutes blend together like hot fudge swirling onto melting ice cream until Dean’s internal clock gives up trying.  His thigh has hooked entirely around Cas now, the tips of his toes poking at his friend’s calves.  The shock or fear of having Cas’s hands down there is nearly nonexistent the longer they go, slowly being washed away by the warm, tingling waves radiating out from the touch.  Cas seems to breathe in his moans, inching in infinitely closer until their flushed lengths line up entirely.
The crack of the first door has Dean springing from the bed and scrambling to tuck Cas back up in the blankets.  Cas squirms, “Dean?”
For now, though, he lets it go and moves back to trail kisses from Cas’s shoulder up to his neck.  Cas gives a happy little grunt, stretching out for more and lazily winding his fingers in Dean’s hair.  His lips press kisses up to the bolt of Cas’s jaw.  His tongue darts out every once in a while to soothe at a bruise.  He doesn’t leave any marks.
“Yeah, I mean.  Wouldn’t it be cool to know that there was someone out there who was perfect for you?  Someone who likes the things you like, hates the foods you hate--stuff like that.  You’d be like puzzle pieces together.  Like…soul-friends or something.”
“Don’t be such a freeze-baby, Cas,” he teases, poking at her crossed arms, “The water is real warm once you get in.”
in anticipation.
“Alright, big guy,” Deanna glances over her shoulder once more before seeming to unfold whatever the item is, “Don’t laugh.”
“I-I don’t know, Daddy,” Deanna says.  Castiel pushes a little further and she shivers, eyes half-lidded, “T-Too big for my special p-princess place…”
,” if she’s trying to go for genuine she’s missing the mark by a mile, “
“Come on--harder, Boy,” Cas commands, hands clamping down on the pumping muscles of Dean’s ass cheeks.  His thrusts grow frantic and Cas’s eyes roll back into their skull as he pummels
“Pleasepleaseplease,” the litany tumbles from Dean’s lips.  Cas straps into the harness one-handed for as long as possible until they have to withdraw their fingers from his hole to fasten the last adjuster, leaving it fluttering and gaping.  Dean’s fists clutches at the corners of the towel, canting back on air.  A throb lights in Cas’s core and they moan at the salacious sight.
Castiel playfully rolls his eyes though he’s aware she can’t see it.  Little sparks of arousal light up in his stomach when the crinkle of--what he assumes is--plastic packaging gives way to the soft, staticky sound of Deanna’s hands brushing over fabric. There’s a few more seconds of rustling and Castiel feels his cock twitch solely from the anticipation of it all.  Deanna hasn’t had a bad scene idea yet in the few years since they started playing with dom/sub dynamics, so the odds are in Castiel’s favor for whatever she has in mind.
Dean’s tongue is thick and lazy like a slug in his mouth, refusing to form the letters he needs it to.  He tries to twist again and, this time, he realizes it’s Jack’s slender hands that are holding where the duct tape is still pinning his arms to his back.  Frustration roils in his stomach and Dean keeps pulling, and struggling, and pulling.  The smell of smoke and burnt rubber is pushing through his cloudy senses, bringing the world and his thoughts into focus.
Cas’s lower lip wobbles, “De-I...Dean, please…”
“Ba--” Dean stutters.  Luc’s paw slams down on Cas’s ankle, starting to drag the boy’s lithe body toward him and what will no doubt be a beating to open all those wounds back up.
It’s never happened before, that’s true.  But there isn’t anything Dean would put past Luc at this point.  Dean’s eyes glare back up at the ceiling, praying for any tiny sign of what is going on up there.
Dean clears his throat, clocking off his friend’s phone and sliding it back across the table.  As Charlie starts in on some angel character from that
Dean kind of loses track of his thought because, staring at his brother’s hand, the rise and fall starts to even out.  Sammy’s hand follows each inhale and an exhale in a smooth wave and, hey, that raw feeling in Dean’s throat is gone.
Thank you so much for reading <3
One hand sneaks down along the unseen ‘V’ of her hips until it caresses the heated line resting just below her belly button.  Deanna moans a surprised hum, her head falling back to Castiel’s shoulder.
Cas huffs “Oh, yes.  Much older than me.  Gabe and Hannah are grown-ups, but Michael and Anna go to college still.  Gabe calls me the baby of the family and I guess he’s right.”
Maybe he’d go slowly and let Dean kiss him back sometimes.  Dean’s hand drags lower and touches over the waistband of his boxers, slipping one finger...two fingers against the smooth plain there.  Would he touch Dean just like this?  With warm, smooth hands--not calloused ones like Luc’s.  Maybe Robert would kiss his cheeks while he gently rubs him over his boxers.  Dean’s mouth falls open on a sigh as his hand slips even further down and touches his hot, tingly coc--hardness.  A sweet, happy feeling runs up to his stomach when his fingertips stroke over himself and he feels himself twitch.  Robert could touch him just like this, kiss him, tell him he loves him.
Now the heat has crawled all the way down Dean’s cheeks and tingles in his neck.  Dr. Piccolo did look like she’d fucking transcended on that thing.
.  Alright.  You win, big guy.  You win.”
“Who?”
Cas won’t say it, but he’s absolutely right.
Dean’s chin drops, eyes examining the chilly concrete beneath his feet.
Is this his shot?
“The Rolling Stones?”
Cas is slightly more gentle than they had been with their fingers, easing in with all the care they usually show Dean—scene or not.
Teasing is all well and good in theory, but there’s a torrent of crisscrossed messages firing in his brain telling him to be a good boy and let Cas set the pace—but also to do anything and
,” Cas beams and Dean snorts.  His mumble of “
Jack’s head and veiny eyes pop up in surprise, his arms draw Dean in even closer until his cheek squishes against Dean’s neck, “Dean will come with me, right?”
“It’s a sin to do so.”
Castiel slowly sat up and was sure to keep his hand on Dean as silent reassurance that he wasn’t going anywhere, merely changing position.  As soon as Castiel was upright with his back to the couch, he spread his knees a little and motioned his boy into the V of his legs.
Whoa.
Dean’s not sure what he was expecting, but Cas’s widening smile is not it.
They—they can’t.  They can’t escape!  Luc will catch them, and he’ll kill Dean’s parents like he killed Sammy. O-Or he’ll kill all of them in his rage.
“So, you and Cas liked to talk about bees,” her lips draw up playfully, “What did you and Dean like to do?”
so.  But sometimes he’ll t-touch me...between my legs and it--Dean, it feels really good for a second and--does
The night sky is dark and starless but still seems to shine through the house’s windows like the backlighting on a movie set.  Dean’s eyes are hazy and he does his best to rub the sleep out of them.  His mouth smacks around a yawn and the mundane sounds of the silent house fill his ears.
“Then, one day, Castiel was called by the other angels to court--apparently, a ‘court’ used to be just a special meeting place, and not where judges and lawyers go.  So, Castiel went to court before his brother and sister angels and, as a reward for being so obedient, he was given a special mission: save the righteous man.”
It’s fewer rings this time, though it still feels like a century before a much clearer voice comes through, “
The kid doesn’t tear his eyes off the two mystery guests but leans in to whisper to Dean.
Sammy doesn’t add anything more so Dean clears his throat, forcing a chuckle, “Oh and, heh, the little dude’s a fucking space heater.  Swear to god, I probably would’ve frozen my toes off eventually if Cas didn’t octopus all over me at night.  He also sleeps like the dead...y’know, if he doesn’t have any nightmares.”
Dean has a couple dozen questions rolling around in his mind like scattered marbles.
Then he sees the second thing that steals the breath right of his lungs that day.  This time, it’s not so great.
Only a string of noises is all the warning Dean can give before raw sunshine surges through his body and everything under his skin pulses to the beat of his heart.  Eyes squeezed shut, and muscles clenched tight, Dean falls from the razor’s edge as the waves course through him until he’s left a boneless puddle and so,
“Of course.”
Castiel hadn’t expected any less but a sharp twinge of guilt hit him in the ribs nonetheless.
“Yes, Daddy--
Cas’s little smirk widens even further as they angle themself towards Dean, “And that’s assuming I’d accept the offer.”
,” Dean murmured, turning pleading, fiery greens upward and Castiel couldn’t help but plant a chaste kiss on slightly parted lips, smiling.
” Dean whimpered, hands scrambling between Cas’s shoulders and their hair.
Oh my word, guys.  This is the week.  Supernatural is starting again!
“...Green,” Dean huffed, “But…”
“We need you to step back, this boy needs immediate medical attention.”
When the third door opens Dean doesn’t even get a chance to savor the flash of fresh air that follows Luc before the man is slamming the door shut behind him again.
“He’s fine.  Fan-fucking-tastic.  Can’t you tell?”  His voice is rising a little more than he should let it with the kid sleeping upstairs, but low, hot shame apparently doesn’t take the night off.  He hops back down to his feet and eyes the exit, “We’re both doing great.  And, no, I’m still not some kid-touching creep so you can tell mom to shove it up her ass—”
“Heh, it’s good, right?” Dean takes the twisty tie back off the bread bag, “Another slice?”
“It’s alright, Jack,” His friend’s voice has changed on a dime.  Dean feels cold all over the second Cas’s body rolls away from his, “It’s just us.”
They’d talked about it, sure.  But it hadn’t really seemed real ‘til this second.
A beautiful, full-belly rumble bubbles from Cas’s lips, and Dean’s pretty sure it’s been months since he was graced with that sound.
“Jury’s still out, sunshine,” he teases, but his coy expression quickly turns slack when Castiel takes the opportunity to squeeze at Dean’s dribbling tip.  Luckily, Dean’s groan is soft enough that Castiel isn’t too worried that it reached their son’s room.
Dean realizes that he needs to get a grip on himself--and soon--when he feels that familiar coiling deep in his lower belly.
“You’re doing so good for me, Dean,” Castiel said, “You’re being such a good boy, Daddy’s so proud of you for how patient you’ve already been.  Don’t you remember how good it feels, after Daddy’s gotten you so close to coming but makes you stop—how good it feels when I finally give you permission and your little cock just explodes with all that pressure building up inside you?  Don’t you want to feel that good again?”
Cas’s motions pause, turning the full power of his quiet smile and fluffy hair onto Dean, “Hello, Dean.”
“Ca—” his words break off with a wet click around the lump in Dean’s throat.
Her lip quirks up as Castielle rolls her eyes, sliding in by his side she takes one of the plastic handles out of his grip.  He gives a rumble of protest but at least he isn’t breathing like he ran a marathon anymore, “it’s your fault for parking two lots away...”
A deep, somewhat shaky breath leaves Cas’s perfect lips, eyes never leaving his.
Cas.  His Cas…
A cool splat hit Dean’s cheek.  He brushes at the wet spot on his cheek and his blood sloshes in his veins like ice.  Every muscle in his body goes taut.  He rolls back to look up at the ceiling where the drop had come from.
, he really does.  The hunter begins a slow slide out...then a slow slide back in.  Small, easy thrusts into Cas’s tender hole have the ex-angel moaning around shaky breaths.  “God, Cas.  Perfect...
His arms flex next, tightening then loosening around Jack’s little body and the sleep warm sweatshirt he’s still wearing that’s one size too big.  Scooching back as smoothly as possible, Dean untangles himself from the kid’s octopus limbs.  A pleasant chill climbs up the backs of his legs once his feet hit the cool floor, and it barely takes a second of dizziness before he’s right as rain again.
Suddenly, the roof collapsed in one section of the house. The noise startled the group for none of the group had seen it start to crumple. After seeing that everyone in front of him was okay, Dean’s mind went straight to Cas. His friend was still not in the house yet; it was never good when a fireman doesn't come out of a flaming building. Shakely, he phoned Cas through the walkie-talkie and prayed the other man would pick up or come outside before he radioed.
“Yes.”
“Bitch.”
“Huh?”
“There we go, get some of that nice fresh air in those beautiful lungs of yours.” After finishing coughing and being able to catch his breath, Cas looked up at Dean. Neither said anything for a moment as they knew that other team members were coming soon. However, both knew that several things had changed in that moment. They both knew that they would have to talk about this but couldn’t right now with other ears around. Now, all they could do is look at each other. Less than a minute later, Jo came running around the corner with the paramedics and other firefighters. The pair were separated while the paramedics did their health checks.
Dean faced the door and took a breath before opening up the door. When entered the room, he saw that Cas was sleeping peacefully in a blue hospital gown. He had a couple of soot marks around his face along with two band aids but, otherwise he looked beautiful. Still beautiful Cas. He moved further into the room and took a seat to Cas’s left. He poked Cas in his side. When he got no reaction, he did again.
When they arrived at the sight, the house was already blazing; everyone dove into their usual positions. Dean lost sight of Cas when the men went their separate ways. Cas with Jo and Jack to start rescue efforts while Dean helped the rest of the crew setting up the hoses and making sure that it was only the house that was on fire. Everything was going well, in fact too well Dean thought. The paramedics got there in record time, and set up was done in record time as well. The flames were nearly under control, except for one part of the house. The roof was what worried Dean the most; since the house was slightly older, it looked like at a distance to be made of really flammable material. What also made him nervous was the fact that Cas and J2 weren’t back yet. He quickly made a head-count of everyone still outside while starting to get the extra gear needed for the house on. Once he had his gear on, he made his way over to Donna and Jody.
“You sure that-”
Silence.
“Well, the way you two have been looking at each other tells me differently. I would bet all the money in the world that you are going to walk out the door and Cas is going to be the first person you are going to tell.”
“Cas.” Dean nearly pleaded and placed a hand on his shoulder while Jo started to clear off the roof of him.
Old loves knock your mind until it falls. But, you can’t help but wish for them back.
“You never told me why you became a firefighter.” he asked, not knowing the conquests of the question. Dean sighed; this was going to be a really fun day wasn’t. Nevertheless, he had to tell Cas. He took a breath and said:
“Your welcome, son. Now, how are things with Cas going?”
“Is the family all okay?” he asked about getting right into the business.
Sam smirked before sitting down next to him. He then handed Dean a coffee from the local café, which Dean greatly appreciated and needed. “
“You got dish duty next week.” Dean gave him a joking shove while smiling. Though he would never admit out loud, he was glad that Sam was here. He was the only one besides Bobby who could understand the worry associated with fires and the cause.
“No promises, but I’ll try.” Cas said.
I won't tell you that you will get better over night.
“Huh, sorry Bobby. Zoned out for a second.”
“See yeah, Bobby.” Dean exited the room and began to make his way to the kitchen. A small grin crept onto his face. He was going to continue to do the work he loved to do; saving people, putting out fires, family business. In addition to that, he was going to be with the people that he loved. He couldn’t believe how good life was right now. Almost too good. Doubt began to creep into his mind, with negative thoughts drowning out the realistic ones. What if he was a terrible firehouse chief? What if he messed up? What if he got someone killed? What if-
“ What’s the bad?”
“Yes, they are going to stay with a family down the road.” she said.
The man, who had transferred to Dean’s unit five years ago, was the personification of sunshine. The man who brought Dean’s favorite pie on his first day of work, and every Thursday afterwards. The man who volunteered at the local homeless shelter, and kept bees at his home. The man who helped Dean pick out Miracle. The man who he may have had a little crush on. Okay, full on loved. There was just one problem though: Dean was a chicken when it came to feelings. These fears he thought were reasonable though. He felt unworthy of Cas’s love and time. He thought Cas was straight due to his ex-girlfriend coming to the station once. However, the biggest reason was that there was no way that Cas could love a man like him. Little did he know how wrong he was.
When Dean was cleared, he quickly made his way over to Jody who was the second in command after him. She looked relieved to see him walking around.
“Cas, I-” A loud alarm sounded off and cut him off. Both men internally groaned as they separated to get ready for the call. Dean got ready in record time, got into the truck and moved to the front to drive; Cas moved into the shotgun. The rest of the crew was right behind him. They took off, unaware of how the call was going to go. While this was normal, it still didn’t make it any less nerve racking. House fires were the calls that Dean hated the most due to all the variables that had to be accounted for. Warmth reached his shoulder; looking down, he saw it was once again Cas giving him the strength he needed. Neither saw the knowing looks from the crew in the back of the truck.
“That’s good.”
“The roadhouse or Garth’s?” Cas asked
“Alright, hit with the good first.”
Soon the sandman arrives taking you to the land of nightmares, with no rescue it sight.
“Cas?”
“Wait, I didn’t know that -”
“The crew decided that I should be here with you since the rest of them have to stay on call. They also wanted me to update you on some things that were discovered after you left.”
They left you because you have no worth to them.
No you want to scream but your thoughts have taken control.
“Jerk.”
The trio slowly made their way inside. They kept silent incase Cas yelled for help. Coming to the staircase, Dean motioned for them to start for them to make their way up. Both nodded their heads in agreement. Each step was hotter than the previous do to the flames growing closer, though water soon hit those flames. They had reached the top of the stairs when they heard a quiet meow. Looking at his feet, Dean found a soot covered orange cat. The cat was wheezing in on ground; he quickly scoped the thing up. Grateful for his fire suit, otherwise allergy city, he passed the animal to Jack since Jo was also allergic to cats. Jack slowly made his way back outside, cat in tow and leaving Dean with only one partner.
“Boy!”
Their happy without you-
“Listen Jody, I shouldn't-”
The last line caused Dean to laugh; he couldn’t imagine hum hurting a fly. They held that position for a couple of seconds. Cas’s phone went off before either could say anything. Looking at his phone he rolled his eyes before saying: “Dude can’t take a hint.”
“For our first date.”
“You got him?”
So, please keep fighting.
“Yes, he might be asleep. I can take you to him.” she said with a knowing smirk, to which he shot her a shy smile back.
“What I’d miss?” Sam asked, sliding his phone back in his pocket.
“Can I see him?”
“Yes, you got the front?”
“Cas, do you copy?”
“No problem, now go get him tiger.” Meg said before heading down the hallway.
“So, when is your guy's first date?” he asked with a knowing smirk.
I have have good news though;
It was a normal day for the fire department; no calls had come in, so most of the department was cleaning the department or taking care of the truck. Dean and Bobby were going over some paperwork. Since John went on a beer run when Dean was 13 and never looked back, Bobby became Dean and his brother Sam's adoptive dad. He was a part of the reason that Dean became a firefighter when he was twenty-one; the other reason Dean never told anyone for personal reasons. This other reason, however, led to him being over protective of Sam. He was glad that Sam didn’t follow in his or Bobby’s footsteps and became a lawyer. He actually met his now wife Eileen because of a case. Sam would often stop by the firehouse to hang out on his lunch with the gang. This often led to teasing between the two and strengthening their relationship. It was Sam who was the first to try and push Dean to ask Cas out. If only Cas-
“ If you are about to say what I think you are about to say, I will smack you right up the side of your head. Dean, you went to save one of your own while also bringing help and not going rouge cowboy. You did it safely and got everyone out alive. It shows how much you have grown and what type of leader you will be.” she said, shooting him a knowing look. It took Dean a minute to realize where she got the info from. Bobby and Jody had been dancing around each other for years, heck since Dean was a kid. They didn’t act on it because of the pain of their first partner's deaths. He was elated for them; they deserved it. Plus, it was like mom and dad finally getting together.
“Go, we got this.” Jody said.
Chuckling, Cas said “No, just a blind date that went terribly wrong. My brother has got to stop setting me up with every guy at his work.”
Cas shook his head no.
“Pff-, usually you are right on that. Today, however, it is a mix of good, bad, and mix.”
After waiting a few seconds, Cas motion for him to give him more details. Dean couldn’t speak; he too didn’t want to say anything in case other ears were listening, and had Bobby be accused of favoritism. Sensing his nervousness, Cas gave a quick look around the room before grabbing Dean and pulling him into a side room. Once the door closed and he checked the room for anyone, Cas turned back to Dean and waited for him to tell him the whole story. Realizing that it was okay, he took a breath and began to recount the meeting to Cas.
I won't tell you thoughts will disappear completely, or the ache and static.
But, you can’t because they're gone.
“Well, she was an amazing woman. She made my bio-dad a better man; she got him to stop drinking. When I was four and Sammy was six months old, a fire broke out in the house. Dad placed Sammy in my arms and told me to get outside. He tried to find her but couldn’t and himself was pulled out by firemen. They found her trapped in the basement. Unfortunately, she didn’t make it. I vowed when I was younger that I would do my best to make sure that no family would go through what our family went through.” Dean said tears lightly going down his face.
“Dean what,-” Cas said as he slowly opened his eyes. He started to try and get up but couldn’t because of the pieces of the roof. His eyes looked scared as if he was afraid he was going to die. Dean wasn’t going to let him die, not on his watch. Hearing a pained hiss, he snapped back to the task at hand of providing comfort to his friend.
“Go, go. I’ll be okay. Keep saving the world and thank you.” The brothers quickly hugged before Sam took off.
“Well, the family all made it out with just scraps and bruises. They went to the hospital to double check everything. They also have family to stay with while they sort everything else out.”
“We are okay, going to try the back door.” Dean said. Jo gave him a quick thumbs up before dashing out front to get more help. Dean turned them both around and headed toward the back door he had seen earlier. Cas was leaning more on him with each step, which encouraged Dean to run faster. Thankfully, the door was insight. Practically sprinting the last bit, Dean ran into the door causing it to fall to the ground. Once they were outside, both fell into the grass.
“We aren’t dating, Bobby. You know that.”
“Thank you Meg.”
Tears would shed with lives lost with you gone.
It's never go to listen to sad songs at 130 in the morning.
“Man that was a close one, right Cas?”
Those attacks and illness will appear again.
“Alright, Jody and Donna, take the kids. Jo and Jack, follow me. Stay close, don’t want to lose anybody today.”
“Thanks doc.” he said as Sam came back over.
Dean said “thank you” before running over to the ambulance and jumping into it. Once in the ambulance, he quickly moved out the paramedics way and towards the front, sitting to the right of Cas. Wanting to ask about his condition but not wanting to distract the paramedics, he turned his attention to Cas. The man was quietly crying so Dean took his hand and started to stroke his hair. Cas looked at him and tried to give a simile, but it appeared to be painful to do so. The next fifteen were spent with Dean trying to comfort Cas the best he could.
Silence
The words pound into your head, With the music crashing with memories.
“Okay, Bobby. You keep telling yourself that. I’ve got to go and check on the crew. Make sure they haven’t destroyed my kitchen.” Dean said getting up from his chair and heading for the door.
“Hey, hey. It's okay we are here” he said trying to cup his face but couldn’t because of the face and mask. He decided that he would do his best to comfort his friend and would be keeping him focused on him. Quickly, Dean and Jo both helped Cas to his feet. Once he was on his feet, it was clear that Cas was going to need help walking. Dean was just about to ask Jo to shift her section of Cas to him when she seamlessly did that. Weight felt next to nothing since he was still standing and able to walk with his arm around Dean’s shoulder.
“Alright, I need their names right now. Sam, I, Bobby, and Garth are going to visit these people and teach them a lesson.” he said in a completely serious tone.
You can’t sleep though as the insomnia has visited like a old enemy.
“Yeah, the old man deserves it. The news that he just dropped on me was the fact he wants me to be his replacement. He even gave me the paperwork to start the transfer.” Cas’s eyes grew happier and bright as he jumped for joy due to the news. He even let out a woop, which caused him to cover his mouth. This action caused Dean to snort; however, he wasn’t laughing when he was pulled into a hug. The hug lasted about thirty seconds before Cas pulled away, though he placed both his hands on Dean’s shoulders.
“How’s you angel? Good, all things considered. I’m keeping him here just to make sure that there are no surprises.”
“That’s good.”
“Yes, lets go.” The trio slowly made their way back through the hallway. The fire was near gone but the smoke leftover was making the journey back more dangerous than before. The creeks in the staircase were also sending off warning bells. Once they reached the bottom of the stairs, Dean and Jo breathed a sigh of relief. They started to make their way toward the front when suddenly they all heard more cracking. Dean looked up and saw various parts of the roof starting to cave in. Thinking quickly, he pushed Jo forward toward the door and took multiple steps with Cas.
“Right. Sorry.” Dean said with a grimace before heading in her direction. Together the pair made their way past the doors. The hallways were quiet for an afternoon but Dean was paying no mind. It only focused on one thing: Cas. Even though Meg said that he was okay, a lot can change within a few minutes, seconds even. Before he could vocalize those fears, they were outside Cas’s room.
“Thank you Bobby, I can have the paperwork to you at the end of the week.”
“Sorry. Couldn’t help it. You are just so poke able.” Dean said, flashing him his Flynn Rider grin. Cas shot him a grin back before trying to sit up; he grimaced in pain so Dean quickly got up from his chair, and helped him sit up. “
“Wonderful, I’ll update the team for you and let them know the great news. I unfortunately can’t stay; Rowena needs help with a case.” he said.
“Thank you, there is just one problem.”
“You have been here the longest next to me. The team trusts you. You’re a great leader. Your a good man. There is no one I’d rather take my place.” The words stuck a cord with Dean.
“ I don’t feel as if I will be a good fire chief.” he mumbled, keeping his head down and not meeting Cas’s eyes. The admission was met with silence. After a few seconds, he felt Cas’s hands leave his shoulders and missed the warmth. The surprise came when that warmth transferred to his face; those hands transferred to his face, and pulled his head upward to meet his eyes. Cas looked at him with pity.
However, this was okay because this decreased the chance of someone getting hurt. Anyway, the duo started to make their way down the hallway. There was five doors with two spilt on both sides and one at the end of the hallway. Each opened a door on their sides; once seeing Cas wasn’t there, they moved to next. When they got to the final door, Dean went in first. What he saw was going to give him nightmares for the rest of his days. Cas was in the fetal position with various pieces of roof on him and was unconscious. The pair raced over to him, hoping that he wasn’t dead. When they got closer, his eyes were closed.
Getting better takes time; sometimes it will take years just to even smile again.
Neither are good with the black thoughts circling And creeping closer and closer until you can’t feel a thing
“Meg, how-”
“Do I need to go beat someone up for you?”
“Yeah, I doubt Cas let them. See you later.”
“It was because of my mom. I haven’t told you about her before have I ?”
Crushed by enemies that hold, past mistakes laugh and color your cheeks red.
“Dean, that is amazing. I am so proud of you.”
“That’s never good.”
The good days will out-way the bad day.
“Cas is going to be okay. Just going to stay here for the night.” Dean said.
“Yes, definitely. The mix is regards to Cas. Cas’s air tank was damaged by some of the roofing causing his air tank to become empty. If you guys had gotten to him even a few minutes, he wouldn’t have made it. The team thinks that the manufacturer messed up, and Bobby is currently on the phone otherwise he would be here too” Sam said.
Dean gave him a small small that quickly disappeared. Seeing the change in the man, Cas decided to try and change the subject.
“The family today they- crud. Dean, I'm so sorry.” Cas said a few tears cascading down his face as well.
You have done so much good in the world, and living will be the best thing.
“Good for him.” Cas said.
Even for a second to get rid of that itch, You want them.
“What?” Dean began to look everywhere except for Cas’s eyes. He really didn’t want to admit his worries but he trusted Cas.
Thanks.” Cas mumbled not looking Dean in his eyes.
“Cas, do you copy?”
“ Hey, hey. It's okay; you had no idea. Heck, you are the only one except for Bobby and Sam who know the truth.” Dean said sitting up. He quickly took Cas’s face in his hands and wiped away the few tears left. Once completed, Dean looked into Cas’s eyes. It was this moment that time stopped for them. Both looked at each other's lips. They moved in slowly as if fearful the other would pull away; neither did. The kiss was soft and salty. It was perfect for them. The only reason they stopped was the need for air. They placed each other's foreheads against each other, just taking in the moment.
And your eyes are strained.
Memories will happen if you stay, Lives created.
“Hey, guys. I’m going to go in and see if the crew needs any help. Use radio if you see them before I do.”
“It's next Thursday, and you will breathe to know one. Yet anyway.” she said not meeting his eyes.
Love will flourish with your laugh.
All I can say Is this keep fighting, and try.
“Yes. I don’t talk about it much because I’ve had previous bad experiences in terms of being open with people.” Cas said, now not meeting Dean’s eyes. This broke Dean’s heart; who hurt this angel?
“Seriously, I wouldn’t be laughing. You know how many dishes they make in a night.
“Oh Dean, I am sorry that you feel that way. However, I feel, and others have/will back me up, that you are the best person who could fill Bobby’s shoes and still be your own person. You know this firehouse like the back of your hand. You also are the first to make any of the newbies feel welcomed. Everyone looks to you already when Bobby isn’t on call. So, why not make it official? If anyone gives you any crap for this promotion, you got a whole team behind you ready to kick their asses for you.”
Dean was about to ask her more questions when he saw movement in the corner of his eyes. The paramedics were wheeling Cas quickly into the ambulance. He had an oxygen mask on; his eyes were looking around and not focused on anything. Panic coursed through Dean. Had Cas gotten worse since Dean left him? Was he dying? Dean shot a quick look to Jody.
Lightly pushing the other man but laughing, Cas gave Dean his brightest grin and mumbled a small thank you. Dean flashed him one back, and opened his arms incase ( hoped) wanted a hug. He all but fell into Dean’s arms, pulling him close. Both held onto each other as if they were each other's life preserves. A thought popped into Dean’s head; he had a chance. Bobby maybe right, huh. Deciding to take a chance, Dean leaped.
At that moment, Sam’s phone went off. He rolled his eyes before stepping away to answer the call. It was also in this moment that Dean knew why the team sent Sam in their place. And he couldn’t be more grateful. To his right, he heard the doors open. He looked and saw one of the doctors, Meg, step out. Meg was one of the doctors who had a great bedside manner but wasn’t afraid to lay into people who crossed a line, mainly if they even considered hurting any of her patients. She also was one to cut right to the chase, which helped Dean’s anxiety. He got up and made his way towards her.
