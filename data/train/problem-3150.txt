Vanessa sighs trying to sit up as much as she can, and squeezes the water out of her hair. When Castiel comes back with towels the wind blows a heavenly scent towards her.
Dean thought, he looks at the bottom of the door and notices that it's glowing a blueish purple.
"Really?" Dean says as he puts his little wheelbarrow on go.
"And that right there is the wrong thing to say, don't go around telling that to everyone," Dean lets go of Tim's shoulder and reaches for the handle. "It might be better if you just don't talk," Dean says as he opens the front door and lets Tim walk in first.
Enjoy!
Castiel rubs his face with his palms and looks at her, his pupils are a lot larger than they are supposed to be, and Vanessa notices that he buttoned his entire trench coat.
"No, shirts go on like this," Dean demonstrates with an extra shirt he has.
"Smooth," Dean bites a strip of bacon, justly earning the venomous look his brother shoots him. "And we can deal with that later, we should relax today."
Their lips slot together almost perfectly, Castiel wraps an arm around her back and rubs small circles into her. Vanessa sighs as Castiel nibbles on her bottom lip, hoping to gain entrance.
"Oh wait, you might not like this" Sam mutters as he reaches to change it.
Dean shoots her a confused look until the sound of someone opening and closing a door echoes through the house. He turns his focus onto the song, he has heard it before but he just can't remember. "Is this by Journey?" He guesses.
"Calm down, we will find her," Castiel gravelly voice soothes her, he pulls her into a hug and wraps his wings around her.
"Cas if you can hear this, I'm sorry man, if you can fly over here we could talk it out, or you could ignore me, either-or," Dean continues. He has moved the food and the bag from the zoo to the back in case the angel decides to fly over here.
With her vision blurred, she notices that she is in fact in her room, but she recalls falling asleep on the floor with Dean.
"Cas?" Vanessa says, his gaze doesn't break from the TV but he hums in response. "I think I pulled, wait, I
"Wake him up," Vanessa tells Cas. Cas puts two fingers on his sweaty forehead and as fast as a bullet, Dean springs up and pushes himself into the headboard.
"A date! Vanessa here has to put her egg in a, what was it?" Dean places a hand on her shoulder.
"Dean wanted to know my favorite movies and stuff," Vanessa yawns. "They are hunting the thing as we speak."
"Thank you, this is our first date," Castiel beams. Dean freezes and turns to look at Castiel in horror. Embarrassment turns to anger as Dean stands there trying to come up with something to say.
"Dean, you can't just ask to touch them, " Sam says.
"Wow," both men say, astonished by what they're seeing. Vanessa quickly changes her eyes back to brown and her fangs, gills, scales, and fins disappear as well.
"So, I have to ask, how long have two been dating?" Daniel asks, his brown eyes glued on Dean's face.
"I can take that up to him, " she inches her hand to the handle if the mug, waiting for approval. Sam nods and rubs his eyes and yawns.
"Do you remember anything about the wings? Or the crash?" Sam asks as he grabs his can of beans, thank god Dean decided to bring extra.
"The spell will work better if you stay still, on the couch," she says. He rolls his eyes and keeps eating his apple. "No matter, I was going to make French toast, did you want some?"
"Why don't you ask me tomorrow, when I'm sober?" Vanessa says as she snuggles closer to his chest. She may not be hammered as she was an hour ago, but it'll be nice to give him a clear and precise answer, even if it'll be a yes no matter what.
Dean turns to face Sam, he licks his dry lips and shrugs. "I have no idea, but someone is down there, we need to get them out."
"Shift? Like, grow your tail?" Sam asks with his mouth full.
"I vas reeding a buk Cas brought," Vanessa starts to explain. When Castiel was mentioned Dean's brows furrows, he knows what happened was just a stupid dream and no way does Vanessa like Castiel more than him, but what happened in the kitchen can't help but plant a little seed of doubt in his head. "And it's in German zo I jus have an accent. My nazural accent can change almosz immediazely and it happens a lot and it's annoying."
"I knew I wouldn't be able to keep that a secret for long," Dean mutters. Vanessa is practically dancing in her seat as she watches Dean takes the large slabs of salmon out of the skillet and onto a few plates.
"They're big, umm, soft-looking, and black or blue" Dean quickly says. All three of them look to Cas for answers, who instead pulls in his large wings and freezes in place.
Dean frowns, it has been at least ten minutes and no damn lightning! Plenty of thunder for some strange reason, but no lightning! Dean wasn't very good at science in school, but he was pretty sure that you can't have thunder without lightning. Maybe he's still asleep and this is a dream...he chuckles at that thought.
Vanessa stuffs her phone in her pajama pants pocket and walks out of the room, wanting to check on Sam and look over Cas, then she'll make breakfast. She walks out into the sunlit hallway and glances over at the door she sent Cas through. Thankfully he accepted her apology, she didn't want to make him mad like all the other angel she's met. She runs down the stairs and turns to walk into the living room. She pauses when she doesn't see Sam on the couch.
"Hey take Tim with you, I'm sure he'll need to go," Dean pushes Tim to Sam, who stumbles before following him. Dean lingers to watch them walk to the back, Tim adjusts the sweat pants Sam threw at him as he enters the restroom.
Dean and Vanessa sing loudly. Vanessa air guitars the amazing rift as Dean taps the drums on the steering wheel.
"What the hell was that?" Sam demands.
"One last thing" she mumbles as she quickly licks her lips, she pushes her self onto her tiptoes and crushes her mouth on his. Surprised, Dean freezes then leans into the kiss, running his hand through the back of her hair, ruining the braid. Vanessa wraps her arms around his waist and sighs.
"Yeah, I'll explain it when we get home. For now, relax and enjoy the music," Dean says as he grabs the box of cassette tapes, he decides to start him off with Led Zeppelin then moves on to ACDC.
"Do you want to go and do that?" Cas asks and Vanessa blinks, forgetting that the pretty angel was even there.
"Is that...is that crab seasoning?" Dean asks with a large smile, trying not to laugh.
"I thought I put up good enough spells, guess I have gotta ward them against angels too," Vanessa mutters. She decides to set up the incubator as she waits for Dean, her garage turned office is where she keeps it.
"Ket-chup?" Tim asks with a head tilt, making Dean look away and gesture at the red untouched bottle pressed up against the wall. "Yeah, ketchup, you pour it on your burger and it makes it taste better or you can also dip your fries in it."
"You can fly us to–" Dean pulls out the map from his jean pocket. "Here." He points to where the gift shop is, "if you–" Dean is suddenly blinded by the sun as he feels Castiel strongly grip his shoulder. "Can," he finishes.
When Dean's finally done, he stuffs a ball of his clothing into Vanessa's neatly packed bag and she scowls, but Dean ignores it and heads to the impala. Vanessa follows and slides into the passenger seat as Dean puts the bag in the trunk.
This is what he was doing this morning, he had gone for a quick run and shower before booting up his laptop and sitting at the kitchen's island and not noticing his brother in the doorway.
"Who are you?" The man asks as he stands to his feet. Dean notices that he is not much taller than he is.
After a few more sips, Dean feels his stomach growl. He quickly finishes up his coffee and sets the cup in the sink, rubbing his hands together, he turns to the stovetop. "Whaddya think about pancakes for breakfast?"
"That bitch, I thought I locked that stuff up pretty good," Vanessa's gaze immediately goes to the pantry by the stairs, knowing she has a secret compartment in there that holds the vast collection of her favorite alcohol.
"You can take Cas, I'm sure he'll enjoy it," Sam grumbles and motions to the angel that has been silently reading this whole time.
"I knew he made wasps, those things are assholes like their creator," Dean mutters angrily. He doesn't mind bees, all they want is to protect their hive while wasps are just plain assholes. "What do wasps eat? I've seen 'em eat wood and shit but I've always wondered what they actually eat."
"I'm sure if you talk about it to her-"
"Can I kiss you right now?" Vanessa asks, taking one of his warm hands.
Dean shrugs and says "I try. I'll probably do it tonight or something, oh I forgot to ask Vanessa something...I'll be right back."
"Well Sam's not here now is he?"
When they had finished their lunch, which was mainly steamed crab, Castiel had finally come and joined them with a birthday card that has a cute llama on it. Dean had half of a pie while the others split the other half, they moved to the living room to open the gifts that Dean had gotten Vanessa.
The pressure inside Dean starts picking up pace as Vanessa does the same, this time sucking a lot harder. "Shit Vanessa, " Dean groans "you're gonna m-make me cum so soon. "
"They're awesome" Dean's voice cracks. Vanessa's face quickly heats up, "they're, umm, not as impressive as yours Dean."
"No Dean, I wasn't laughing at you, I was laughing that this is a proposal, not for marriage, but just for my love for you," Vanessa smiles softly, she takes Dean's hand and intertwines their fingers.
"I found a few easy cases in Arizona and one in Texas," Sam replies, closing his laptop to eat his breakfast.
"I'll take that," Vanessa snatches it from his hands and spins it in hers, and with a poof, it's gone. "So when are you gonna start on the pie?"
"Vanessa," Castiel says again, appearing in front of her.
Lir says. Vanessa rubs her eyes sleepily and groans.
"Sam, wake up," Dean pulls the keys out of the ignition and shakes Sam awake.
When she does, the smell of dust makes her wrinkle her nose. It's a basic layout, the door is in the living room like her one house, a blue couch faces a large stone fireplace and a little beyond that is a counter with stools.
"I dunno, middle of nowhere Kansas, I saw a sign not too long ago about a little town," Dean pops his neck hoping that will help. "We'll stop there and eat if they have a diner."
Their conversation quickly went from what was the worst place you've eaten at to what was the weirdest thing you've eaten.
he thinks as he props his feet on the coffee table. As soon as Sam comes back with the clothes, Dean decides that he isn't as bloody as Sam is and he'll take a shower when they get back in the hotel; but he'll definitely change.
"Hey, umm, I was wondering if I–we could come to visit you for your birthday," Dean mumbles. "Cause, I don't know how long it'll take you to do this hunt and we might pick up another one and–"
"I've lived Blue Planet, I've swum with whales and sharks, I've been to depths no human has ever seen, I wish I could take you down there but the pressure would crush you in an instance," Vanessa hums, memories of spending some quantity of time with her mom so deep below the ocean that the only light came from their bioluminescent scales.
"Take one, we'll be fine if you pass out on the couch," Vanessa says as she grabs the mug and turns to exit the kitchen, "although, I would prefer it if you take a shower, I don't want my couches to smell like hot garbage."
"What kind?"
"Woah!" Dean exclaims as he dashes to her side, he pulls the chair towards him and pulls her onto her feet and into a tight hug. Vanessa presses her face herself into his warm chest and starts crying. Deans pets her unbrushed hair and she continues to cry, he slowly moves to sit on the chair with her on his lap and her legs hanging off the chair.
"You wanna go to a zoo with me? It'll be fun," Dean asks, wiggling his eyebrows when he says fun.
"Fine, I'll have a pie, I don't like pumpkin pie and I am allergic to cherries," Vanessa scrunches her nose as she says cherries.
Dean props her up against the wall to open the door, the crisp cold air hits him and even under the light coat, he still shivers. The light of the fire that Sam built glows across the patio, both Sam and Castiel are currently relaxing around the fire.
"So, I figured that you could help me with this bounty, we just have to
"Thanks." He grumbles. Vanessa herds them inside and into her air-conditioned house. Dean wipes his sweaty forehead and looks around. The walls are painted a calming shade of light blue, and the flooring was a nice tan carpet. Two long brown couches face each other with a dark wood coffee table in the middle, Dean raises an eyebrow as he notices that one of the legs is missing and is replaced with a large stack of books. Deep scratches cover the entire table and couches. Past the couches, the room continues to where the dining room begins and an archway leads to where Dean assumes is a kitchen.
They carefully walk up the small old steps to the front door, Dean and Vanessa wait patiently for Sam to unlock the door. When he does, they quietly infiltrate the house. The front door leads into a small room with one couch and a small table facing a window with stairs facing the door.
"The good thing about a dream is they're
Vanessa snorts, trying not to fully laugh. "You know, angels smell weeeird, "
"Alright, let's finish our drinks then head out," Bobby says. As soon as he said that, something large and heavy throws its self at a door.
Tim pulls out a small container of cereal. "Already have!" He grins, putting the container into Dean's free hand. Examining it closely, Dean finds that it has even sugar to probably keep a small child up for days, shrugging that fact off, Dean steers Tim up to the front and pays for their snacks.
Dean snaps back to attention and rubs his tired face, he looks back at the book he was reading, it was something about sirens and the way they shift into their fishy form. Dean decided that it was important to read, but halfway through he lost interest, which is also why he leaves most of the research to Sam.
"Siblings? Uh, two, my twin Hadiya and my little brother Lir, who is an annoying little shit," Vanessa grumbles. "When it was time to officially meet our dad, I and my sister went up to shore and we just haaaad to bring Lir."
Vanessa pulls up her notifications to find that Dean has texted her.
She stays like that until Vanessa feels the bed shift behind her. She quickly looks over her shoulder to see Dean slowly waking up.
"You ready?" He grins. His forest green eyes sparkle with excitement.
"No, y-you can continue if you want," Castiel mumbles, Vanessa continues to slowly unbutton them until Castiel gets inpatient and uses his grace to do it.
"I don't know Dean, I thought it would be this then we would meet up with Sam," Castiel smirks. Dean rolls his eyes, taking Castiel's hand in confidence, and pulling him to a secluded area of the building.
"Sam's in the car" Dean mumbles as he follows her outside. The heat already makes him feel like he's melting and he can already tell that he's starting to sweat. They run down Vanessa's front yard and climb into the impala.
They pause their interesting discussion as the sound of growling grows loud. "Sounds like Sam's back," Vanessa runs out of the kitchen to greet him.
"Yes please."
Dean pulls into the parking lot of Maria's bar. The parking lot is nearly filled to the brim with trucks, cars, and motorcycles. Dean pulls into an open space next to a large blue jeep and pulls out the keys from the ignition. They all exit the car and walk inside, and a jukebox is blasting some country song about rain and someone crying, a bar is way in the back with tables in front of it. They settle down in a square table for four next to many other filled tables. Many people are dancing, getting drinks from or at the bar, and eating delicious smelling burgers.
"If you say so," Dean starts up episode one and smiles when Vanessa quotes in the character's voices. They get through the first couple of episodes before Vanessa snuggles into him and sighs. He does the same and hits the next episode.
"You can call Bobby, I need to get them out of there," Dean says before thrusting his flashlight into Sam's hands. He starts to carefully walk down the side of the crater, making sure to take the right steps.
"I bet they are."
They continue through the little building, giving each exhibit a little bit of their time. Turns out Castiel made little snakes, like the adorable hognose that Castiel absolutely loved how it turned out, and he also made the king of snakes. The king cobra.
"You smell good" she murders sleepily and starts to drift back.
"Oh boy," Vanessa rolls her eyes. "Considering it's been the same gift every year, but I am always thankful."
"Really?" Vanessa's face starts heating up. Oh shit, Dean doesn't understand what that means to her, if a siren provides for someone and that they're attracted it counts as courting, while she did it yesterday she didn't tell him and pushed down any feeling that came up. While yes, Vanessa did blow him the other day, she has done that too a few people before Dean, but he's one of the few that are very special to her.
"Hmm, Red vs Blue is very high up on the list, but I watch a lot of documentaries," Vanessa rubs her chin.
"Understood."
"What!" Vanessa asks angrily, surprised that Castiel didn't flinch at that.
"Thanks, I guess, " Vanessa looks at the splotches of dark scales on her arms.
The shirt was the Starry Night painting with a stormtrooper. "This looks awesome!" Vanessa exclaims and lays on the growing pile of shirts.
She pauses right in front of the kitchen. Sam has already woken up and is currently looking at things on his laptop, while Dean is cooking delicious smelling food while singing a little off-key.
"We found wings at our crash site," Dean sighs. "They're burned into the ground. Maybe it's a clue?"
" Vanessa points at Dean as she sings.
The early summer sun bakes them as Dean continues to ask Vanessa questions about herself and they manage to catch the amount of fish they want, with Dean catching the biggest fish, and decide to stuff it in the fridge and deal with it at dinner.
"I have heard of it and collected the ingredients for it just in case, but we'll need the vamp who turned him's blood," Vanessa says as she runs a hand through her tangled hair. "Do you know how many are there?"
Dean moves from on top of her and lays back in the bed. "It's okay to say no," Dean watches her brown eyes slide over to him. "Do you want some delicious birthday breakfast instead?"
"What was that all about?" Dean asks curiously, not knowing if he should comfort her.
"Vanessa apparently."
She pushes the door open quietly, the room is quite bare, with a queen bed facing the door, a large dresser against one wall, and a small bookshelf against the other. Cas is currently sitting on the bed, his large black wings protectively wrapped around Dean. Vanessa motions that she has the potion and closes the door behind her, using her magic to lock it.
"Sam are you-" Vanessa gets cut off by Sam being thrown and landing right beside her, "done..."
Vanessa smirks when she feels Dean's hardening member press against her. She leaves little kisses and pushes him upwards until she reaches the hem of his shorts.
She rubs grr thumb up and down the slit as pre-cum leaks from it. Vanessa continues to slowly go up and then back down, taking a few seconds to rub the tip.
Vanessa dashes through the living room and up the stairs, she almost hit Castiel but his wings stop her. His long inky black primary feathers tickle her arms, in his arms are neatly folded clothes.
"Vanessa? Baby, can I ask what you're doing?" After a minute or two Dean asks softly making Vanessa stop in her tracks.
"Who won?" Vanessa blurts out, her eyes shifting from the egg in front of her.
"Did you know that they can sleep upwards of twenty hours?" Castiel smiles as he watches them. "They hunt mostly at night and the females do all the work even though the male eats first."
"Me? No."
"Got it," Vanessa mutters.
"Do you not like coffee?" Dean asks as he places his empty mug on the coffee table.
"I'm sure we'll see them soon enough, it'll be nice to see how they act after billions of years," Castiel says, pushing off of the railing. "Let's continue."
"Nice car," Vanessa says as she takes her seat in the back and buckles her seat belt.
Dean now watches in horror as the person breaks apart into pieces. The biggest piece looks just like a normal human being, Dean watches it comes closer to the earth and he feels the ground beneath him quake as it makes contact. Thankfully it didn't land at the campsite, just nearby.
"Hello," the man says. "Who are you?"
Vanessa can't help but laugh. "What? It's not that dumb of a question okay?" Dean frowns and rubs the rock.
"Fine. I'll help, as long as we can celebrate afterward." She announces, she winks at Dean who lightly blushes at the gesture.
"You did what?" Sam laughs, then groans loudly from laughing.
"Don't know much about you angels but I've met a few, to the point where I melted down a couple of let over angel blades to make my two-handed sword," Vanessa says very proudly as she brushes a strand of her pink hair behind her ear.
But I hope y'all enjoy and leave a comment/kudos and please don't stay up longer reading this...unless you're in a different time zone than me and it's daytime for you...Anyways enjoy!
"Hi, bubby," Vanessa coos as she takes her attention off of the egg and to Pluto. His icy blue eyes painfully remind her of Hadiya's, who has always found that dragon eyes remind her of humans. Too bad, she was never around to see them.
"I am starting to become concerned about him. If those hunters come back and he's not turned it might be more trouble than it's worth" Dave/Vanessa gulps as the blonde starts tracing her fake purple nails over her muscular arms.
"A spoon? We have plenty of those, but would you like a straw?" The waiter asks as he pulls out a straw and places it in front of Tim, who stares at it confused. "If you boys need anything else, I'll be at the counter," The waiter smiles at them and his eyes linger on Sam before he leaves.
"I don't like regular bacon as much as turkey bacon."
"What exit?"
Well, that was the longest chapter I've written so far, it's a little over nine thousand words. But as always I hope y'all enjoyed it, and feel free to leave a kudos and comment if you want, I'll try to reply!
"I hate healthier food," Dean shoves the last of his bacon into his mouth.
Vanessa sighs, knowing that if she brings up what happened earlier, she'll just get the same stupid answer. Her fingers find their way into the soft inky black feathers, this time she combs through them instead of just fiddling with, each stroke seems to calm her down and Castiel too.
"I don't think it's weird, I think it's completely natural," Daniel confesses, making Vanessa sit straight up.
"Noted," Dean grumbles, he decides that fish wouldn't be the worst thing for breakfast, but to make sure it's fresh and done before Vanessa wakes up he'll have to wake up somewhat early...or he could not go to bed. But Dean knows that if Castiel catches him, he'll put him to sleep.
Vanessa shrugs and then turns to Castiel, "and what I just did is a little skill of mine, I can perfectly mimic
Sam has agreed that the best course of action would be to take Tim to their bunker and make sure he isn't internally hurt, which Tim would have brought up at breakfast, and make sure he's safe.
Dean scrolls through local news on his phone as he waits for the boys to get back, when they do, Dean raises an eyebrow when his gaze lands on Sam.
"Umm, nineteen eighty-three?"
"H-hi" Dean says nervously, not wanting to make a fool of himself. Dean takes his time to look at her. Her round nose seems to be twitching in annoyance, and her gorgeous plump lips are pulled into a hard line. Dean looks past her face, which clearly reads "fuck off, I might be busy, it is Saturday", and at her clothes. Her shirt says something about saving rhinos and her pajama pants seems to be glowing purple.
"I suck ass at that game," Dean huffs, rest his head on his hand.
"Sam, don't eat with your mouth full, you could choke, " Vanessa says, not bothering to turn around to look at Castiel.
"If I ever settle down, I'm getting one of these" Dean tells Bobby as Pluto starts licking his fingers with his black forked tongue.
"You two are so cute," he says as he quickly scans everything.
Dean abruptly stops in front of Vanessa's door. Knocking on it softly, he opens the door when she says he can come in.
"Really?" Dean looks up at Bobby, stunned at what he just learned.
Dean thinks, his lips pull into a smile as Vanessa's entire face lights up when she sees him.
Dean watches her slowly bend down and pick up her bra, she slowly sways her hips as she walks to her discarded shirt. She slowly puts it and opens and looks back at Dean. "Did you want something to eat too? Like a sandwich or something?" Vanessa asks with a smile.
"Makin' breakfast," Dean shoots him a grin. Tim squints at the food cooking behind him before his eyes lock onto a plate of stacked pancakes on the island. "You want some?"
"If angels and demons require vessels, and if dinosaurs came before humans, did you guys have to possess a dinosaur, say, a T.rex?"
"Thanks, " she grins, Vanessa pulls his attention away from her amazing chest to her face, she pushes up to kiss him again. Her hands run from Dean's side down to his borrowed pajama pants.
Dean stops abruptly and he brushes off the dirt on his sweat pants. He approaches the person on the ground. It's unmistakable that it's a guy, his jawline looks like it could cut butter.
"I'm glad you enjoyed that," Vanessa untangles her hand from Castiel's silky feathers. "But can you remove your feathers from my pants?"
"Somewhat" she mutters as they exit the house. They walk towards the impala, still buzzing from the hunt, and deciding on what to do to celebrate.
"Alright then, offense it is" Vanessa mutters. She stands up, popping her back.
"What painting?" Sam asks, confused.
Vanessa walks up the last step and straight into the bathroom, she turns on the light, quickly brushes her teeth and her needle-like fangs and her regular teeth, and turns off the light, and heads down the hallway to the master bedroom. Without turning on the bedroom light, she changes into an old but limited edition AC/DC shirt that her dad got her and a pair of men's pajama pants that have deep pockets. She plugs her phone in, and lays down in her soft bed, passing out almost immediately.
Dean looks back down at the book. The minute tick by slowly this time, after every paragraph Dean finishes, he quickly glances up to finds Tim's electric blue eyes still on him.
"Oh really?" Vanessa smirks.
Dean closes the box and puts it back, he quickly changes out of the pajama pants and into a new clean pair. He walks away from the dresser and out the door. He lets out a happy sigh as the sunlight from the windows aren't causing him any problems, he pauses at the top of the stairs to make sure he isn't hard at all before going down the stairs.
Dean starts a small swing as they walk, humming a song as they go, Dean grabs the handle of the gift shop and swings it open, and gets blasted with cold air. It's not particularly hot outside, it's just that the building is cold and makes Dean shiver.
"You just ruined my next question," Dean scoffs. "How much can you bench press," he asks sarcastically before asking. "But no, uh what's your favorite movie?"
Dean scrubs his face with his hands and sighs, he swings his legs off the bed and stands. He tiredly walks to the door and out of the bedroom, thank god Vanessa has closed the curtains otherwise he'd be blind.
"But it's only eight."
"Yes, Sam it's their thing."
"You're so good at this, " Dean moans, he throws his head back into the excessive amount of pillows as Vanessa swipes her tongue over the tip. She gently takes his balls in her mouth, sucking and massaging them with her warm tongue.
"This might be a deal-breaker, Vanessa," Dean swallows a forkful of eggs.
Finding the war room suspiciously empty, Dean shrugs it off and heads for the kitchen. When he reaches the entrance, he finds Sam blocking it. "Excuse me," he grunts, trying to force his way in.
"Okay, Dean, now I need to get on the road, I'll call y'all when I reach the hotel or something," Vanessa says, slamming the trunk door closed.
"How very Dean Winchester of you," Castiel smirks.
"Does it look like it?" Sam sneers.
She hums the song and dives into the pool, Dean sighs and walks over to the firepit, taking a seat next to his smiling brother. "That was fun to watch."
"Happy Birthday Dean," Castiel rests his forehead against Dean's.
"I wasn't going to say that...interesting is what first came to mind," Dean says, giving Vanessa a small smile.
She lets out a low whistle as her eyes run down his muscular arms. "Well if I did, it wouldn't be a race now would it?" She smirks. Vanessa gets in position and quickly says, "beat you to the water," before they both take off.
"Breakfast?"
See y'all next time! <3
Vanessa's boss's boss wanted her to be the one sending people bounties or running the people who do that, but that means extra work and she doesn't get to do any fieldwork, which is the fun part.
"Butterflies? Really?"
Vanessa does the same thing with Cas except quicker, so much so that her hand starts glowing brightly and the tips of her messy pink hair start floating in the air. "Done" she exclaims as she quickly stands up, her hand slightly burning from how fast she went.
"You can land on 'free parking' and get a couple of hundreds," Vanessa says calmly, using a slight hint of her siren powers to calm him.
The front door creaks open, an old woman a few inches shorter than Vanessa eyes them down. Her black hair has a few silver streaks and is pulled onto a tight bun.
This one he bundled up to because he isn't consistent. She rips into this one faster than the other two. Vanessa pulls out the first shirt. "This is badass," Vanessa says as she holds it up to show the other. "Oh sorry," she immediately mutters as she notices the look her dad gave her.
"No need to apologize," Sam says before taking a huge bite if his burger.
"We're here," Dean says, trying to mask his excitement by getting out. He stretches out his back and groans as it pops a few times. He closes the door and stuffs his keys in his back pocket. Before he heads for the door, Dean opens the back door and pulls out a bag.
Dean lightly hums a song that is stuck in his head, he would find the tape it's on, but Sammy is asleep in the passenger seat. They definitely didn't need to leave this early.
"We left least seven, " Cas grumbles as he puts his bloody trench coat back on. Vanessa notices the blood and snaps her fingers, both Sam and Cas look down to find the bloodstains gone.
Vanessa sighs, deciding to take the bag in with Dean, she skips up to the cabin. It's a small one-story house with a stone bottom and dark wood outside. A couple of windows dot the walls and a large dark door beckons for her to enter.
"It must be very young if it's grey, do they shed the grey feathers as they grow?" Castiel points to one of the adults standing in the water.
"She didn't take it very well? She said that she would love to but she can't drop her weird job and her two fucking dragons." Dean sighs. "Plus, I didn't really present the question very well."
And Dean knew it was his fault, if he didn't send Sam to deal with the monsters and gotten captured, everyone would have been alive. But no, Sam got hurt real bad and Dean had to pay for it, those girls had to pay for it.
"Okay calm down, we could stay here until the full moon is over, then we can start looking for jobs, or I could start tomorrow and we could talk about it tomorrow."
"Why not? It's not like I use much of the money anyway, just enough to have a couple of houses and apartments in major cities," Vanessa shrugs.
Dean subconsciously lifts his arm and smells himself, he shrugs when he doesn't smell anything. "You reek of dead fish that's been left in the sun of a week, "
"Did you unpack your bag Dean?" Castiel asks, his electric blue eyes lock with his.
"I do need someone to guard him, especially after what happened to...uhh.."
"I'm sure it'll be delicious, I'm more of a pieman myself, but I'd love to try it!" Dean says.
"They are like bees–" Dean cuts Castiel off by saying. "But worse?"
"We have to go through the library Dean," Sam sighs, finally looking away from his laptop to wearily glance and Tim beside him. "We have to figure out what you are," he says to Tim. "And-err-and deal with you...umm.. appropriately."
Dean stares at the bright magazine cover, he has a few of these at the bunker where no one (Sam) will
"Nevermind, but thanks I guess. Wasn't too bad of a dream, I've had worse."
Dean quickly shakes that thought out of his head and continues his search. He passes a little stand of black magnetic rocks, picking up a small chain of them with a smile. He hasn't seen these in a while. Dean quickly sets them down when he spots the angel.
"You're lucky Bobby already left, he definitely didn't need to see that" Sam laughs.
Half hard he gets up and groans, Dean shuffles over to her dresser and rummage's through the bottom two drawers. The second to last bottom drawer had what he needed, but he looked through the last drawer anyway. A small shoebox next to two extremely old dolls is all that's in there, Dean knows that he shouldn't be looking, but, he isn't awake enough to care.
"Where do you think daddy is?" Vanessa asks as she brushes her doll's hair out of their face.
Dean stands up and stretches, groaning after his back pops, and heads for the kitchen, leaving Sam behind.
Vanessa and Castiel walk up to the house, Vanessa knocks on the door as Castiel rings the doorbell. Vanessa tucks a strand of her now dark brown hair behind her ear.
"That was unbelievable, I've never seen anyone eat that fast, and I live with Dean!" Sam says with a smile.
"Fine." She says quickly, a little too quickly for Dean's liking, her hands quickly go to her neck and she starts fiddling with something around her neck. "I didn't wake up at all," she whispers, looking away from Castiel's gaze.
One of the Achievement Hunters was asked what kind of plant does a Panda eat and he chooses Eucalyptus! Then gets laughed at.
Dean grabs her hand before she can fully stand up. "A kiss first?" He says as he stands up letting her do so too.
Now, the memories of their first kiss and their first hunt haunt her, all Vanessa wants to do is reach out to him and talk to him again. She doesn't know why, but she feels like she has to, when they met she was drawn to him, like a moth to the moon. Her hand hovers over the keyboard, wanting to type something, but like every other night, she just turns off her phone.
"Yeah," Dean chuckles as he rubs the back of his neck. "I love you, Cas, I've been in love with you almost ever since we met."
"You need to stretch your legs bud?"
"Cas, do you think you could gently put this egg on my bed?" Vanessa stands and cradles the egg in her arms.
After twenty minutes and multiple good songs later, Dean pulls into a large suburb and every house has white picket fences and tire swings in each tree. Dean sighs as he turns left to another long road. "Okay, it's house 507, there 500, 501..." Dean mutters as he slowly drives down the road, he finally spots house 507 and notices that's it the only house that doesn't have a minivan or a tire swing in the front yard; in fact, it's the only house with a birch tree by the road, mostly dead grass, and no car in the driveway.
"I don't know, Sam ran out for cake stuff when we gave up on the pie," Castiel scrapes some of the frosting off of the cake and sucks it off his finger. Dean's eyes linger on it, his eyes quickly snap away when Sam comes around and tosses a wrapped present in blue wrapping paper.
Dean nods and looks around for the remote. He grabs it and hits the bed red power button and selects Netflix. He knows that this will not turn into a Netflix and chill kind of thing but rather Netflix and actually relaxing. "You know what's on here," Vanessa hums. "Red vs Blue! Oh wait I think they took it off, but it's on Youtube which I also have up here."
"You didn't snore last night, but you were mumbling in your sleep, mainly about earrings and Cas, so I've deduced that you don't like the earrings he gave me," Vanessa smirks.
A loud constant ringing noise disrupts Vanessa and Dean, making her ears turn into her fin-like ears.
"Here we are." Dean closes his door. The bright early sun warms him as he and Castiel start heading for the entrance.
"Are you making food?" Vanessa asks as she grabs a towel to dry her chest scales.
"When I do what? Tug on it?" Vanessa asks confused.
She quickly walks back, her feet smacking on the hardwood as she jogs towards the living room. "So where's Dean?" Vanessa asks as she places everything on the coffee table.
"Wait, when did this song come out?" Dean asks.
"You did not go?" Maggie looks at Sarah in horror.
"So my next gift?" Dean watches curiously as Castiel saunters over to him.
After who knows how long, Vanessa gets gently shaken awake by a very warm figure. She wraps her arms around their arm and sighs, breathing in their honey-sweet scent. "Vanessa, no, you need to wake up and eat" their gravelly voice wakes her up more.
"Make sure to go with the grain not against it," Vanessa tells Dean as she works on her chest area.
"Wow, nice one, I feel so hurt by that" Vanessa taunts as they slowly circle each other.
"I know," she shifts to face him, his blue eyes are no longer glowing, and his dark hair seems to always be a cute mess. "H-how much did you see? And do you always watch my dreams or..."
"Sit, anyone want a beer?" Vanessa asks as she moves past the dining table.
"Sam said to come and wake you up, we have a surprise for you," Castiel grins. Dean quickly scans the angel in front of him, well, he should say the half-angel in front of him.
"Huh–what?" Sam sits up straight and yawns.
"Didn't even take off his damn shoes"
"Speaking of, why the hell do you live somewhere so hot and humid?" Bobby asks.
"Mm," Castiel replies.
She dreams that she and her late twin sister are princesses, in an actual castle playing with dolls on the cold stone floor. Vanessa's very long dark brown hair is up in a long braid with dark purple ribbons and gold strands. "Hadiya," Vanessa says, her twin sister looks up, her blue eyes meet Vanessa's brown eyes.
"Th-hey kil-led the-em" he cries and tries to fight Vanessa's hold on him.
"Jesus Tim," Dean mutters. "Couldn't have even announced yourself could you?"
"You should do it, but there are some things you should know about courting a siren," Daniel
"That doesn't count as bad manners, the only reason you're upset about it was that she ate a pizza with her hands instead of with a fork like a weirdo! John was nice, I liked his hair and his butt, he did not have any manners at all and ran off with a girl named Marcy."
"Got it," Sam says before focusing on his breakfast. Vanessa watches the slop go into his mouth, she's never been a fan of oatmeal, the texture has made her spit it out no matter the taste.
All witches are on a 10/10 power system, or power levels, every witch has to go to the reevaluation ceremony every year to make sure nothing changed. A 6/10 and above are monitored regularly, anything below isn't considered much of a threat. Vanessa is a warlock that has much more magic than most warlocks, so she is a proud 14/10 (most warlocks are an 11 or 12 and at most a 13.)
"Now you handsome," Vanessa says, pushing the bottle towards Sam as she pulls the herbs and bandages towards Castiel. "Is it okay if I call you Cas too?" She asks.
"Kind of. "
"No, I want to do this, and I don't mind waiting," Dean leans into Vanessa's neck, kissing everywhere but her gills, making her slap the end of her tail in frustration before he meets her lips.
They finish up their round in the reptile building and Castiel is spitting out facts about the animals he created as they leave the building. Dean squints at the bright light, wishing for sunglasses, his eyes slowly adjust as they make their way to the building across from them.
"He was probably just too tired to kill us. But he could tonight."
"Hold on, she can't do that with her clothes on!" Dean says, turning her back around.
"Sounds good, " Vanessa mutters as she turns around and walks towards her kitchen. Cupboards being open and closed echoes through the quiet house as well as the sound of mugs hitting each other. Vanessa walks back with a yellow with black stripes mug. "I love tea in the morning," Vanessa sighs as she sits down in the living room chair a takes a sip of her tea.
Dean decides that the last outcome is plausible and stares at the angel's hand. Just fucking grab it you wimp, he yells at himself. Dean sighs, rolling his shoulders to get himself pumped up, he softly slides his hand into Castiel's, holding his breath the entire time.
She angrily wipes her eyes, which draws even more tears, before reading out loud. "A witch in A-Alabama refused to go to her re-eevaluation and is now on the run, blah blah blah, oh great...a level six," Vanessa grumbles the email out loud, a level six and above are usually the fun ones and make Vanessa excited to fight, but right now, she's to upset to be happy about that.
"Mmm no thank you," Vanessa replies. "Did you put tea on?"
Vanessa sings while using the spatula as a microphone.
"Oh," she says as she quickly unlocks the door "let me give you my number, I forgot to earlier" she quickly runs in and runs back out, jotting down her number and stuffing it in his pants pocket.
Vanessa turns into the suburbs, looking for the house. Each house has the same brickwork but they're all different colors, but each house has the same bushes and no little gardens in front except for one.
"How do you do that?" Sam asks as he grabs the bottle and dumps a lot of syrup of the toast.
"I'll take a cup of coffee," Dean replies, yawning as Vanessa lets the cupboard slam close as she grabs the coffee pot.
You can find me on Tumblr at blueberryrock (which is my main) and rando-fandom-drabbles (which is where imma put my fics and whatnot) so go follow me over there and drop in to say hi!
"Saaam," someone calls from inside the kitchen, their gravelly voice is a dead give away but Dean doesn't care. "I think it's about to explode," Sam sighs and rips the bags from Dean's arms and tells him to "go away."
"I thought people were trying to steal from me, so I made a ball of energy and shot him down the hall and through the door," Vanessa explains and sends an apologetic look at Cas.
Vanessa looks at the second gift, which is a hoodie, while Malachite slowly crawls closer to the coffee table. Both Dean and Castiel don't say a word as they watch her sneakily try to take one of the shirts.
"Where are you two headed?" Sam asks from the dining table. A bowl of what appears to be oatmeal sits in front of him, but Vanessa doesn't remember buying anyway, perhaps he ran out and got it.
"To be honest I'll probably sleep through it, " Sam says, taking another big bite.
"Is that all they have?"
He decided to wrap the clothes separately instead of all together. But all three of them are wrapped in the same Christmas wrapping paper that has little dogs in red boxes.
Vanessa finds multiple vacant shells that she tries to crush to make sure they're what she is looking for and something embedded into a rock, deciding that she has the perfect, Vanessa arcs her torso up to the surface, and with a powerful beat of her tail she breaches it in no time.
Dean walks in the kitchen, the walls are painted a beautiful sunset orange and the tiles are a cream-off white color. There is a small table right by the archway, but it mainly has plants on it, next to the table is a door, hopefully to a bathroom. Next to the door is the large bookshelf that Vanessa was talking about, it's filled to the brim with books. Some with leather cover and others with regular covers, on some of the shelves, are more plants and beautiful large crystals.
"Should be the next one coming up."
Vanessa watches Dean stomp off and sighs, she downs the rest of her drink and calmly slides all of her stuff to Sam. "Tell me who wins in ze mornin'," Vanessa stands, the room feels like it's tilting as she slowly stumbles away. "Imma go an' check on him."
Dean can feel his face get even hotter, and he knows it's not from the heat of the fire. "Well, how am I supposed to know? And wait, were you eavesdropping on us?"
Vanessa cuts him off. "I-I said no. Now I-I just want to finish br-reakfast, then I have some work to do," Vanessa grits teeth before quickly swallowing the rest of her breakfast, resisting the urge to purge it back up, in complete silence. She feels both Sam and Dean's worried gaze on her, but she ignores it.
"Oh right, I forgot about that, well did you sleep at all last night," Sam asks as he runs his hand through his tangled hair.
Dean quickly walks out of the kitchen to calm down and finds Bobby petting Malachite. And as soon as he sits on the couch across from him, Pluto comes trotting up to Dean as fast as his wing-legs can go. "Hey buddy," he says as he cups Pluto's jaw and starts lightly scratching.
"C'mon Dean, " Sam calls again from the car.
Castiel shifts in his seat. "I'll take your word for it," he says before he stares out the window.
"Ready for what?" Sam and Dean ask in unison.
"A-abuela, please help me," Sarah looks at her grandmother for help, but Maggie turns away. "Fine then," Sarah throws her arms out, slamming Castiel and Vanessa back into their seats so hard that the chairs almost tip over, Vanessa tries to fight Sarah's magic with her own as Sarah runs out the front door.
All three of them watch in awe as she dives deeper, they move from the fire towards the pool. Dean can't make out Vanessa's whole body in the dark until she breaches the surface. "Coldwater is so relaxing sometimes" Vanessa sighs as she moves to float on her back.
"No going upstairs, only at night," she bends down and scratches underneath Pluto's chin.
Dean closes the door behind him as Castiel rushes to help keep Vanessa stable. "How much did you allow her to drink?"
"Yeah, they're awesome!" Dean says softly. Vanessa snorts, clearly showing that she doesn't believe him. "They are, Cas help me out on this."
And at that Dean chuckles as he reaches the car, opening the door, and sitting down next to his smiling brother. "I knew it," he says.
Dean shrugs, remembering their brief conversation about it. "I mentioned it."
"Want anything?" Dean turns to Sam as he steps out seeing Sam shake his head no, Dean steers Tim into the building.
"Got it," the waiter jots down Dean's order on his little notepad and looks to Sam. "And for you hot stuff?"
"Cas?" Dean says, he has decided to finally call Castiel back after ten minutes of driving. He found a good burger place and picked up lunch,  and is sitting in his car praying that Castiel can hear him.
They decide to turn around to see the other animals that are on the left before going to the next big area. They stay to look at the bison peacefully grazing until the bison move back inside so they move on to the bald eagle exhibit.
Well, I hope that was nice and fluffy as can be, I have a Tumblr if y'all wanna hit me up and chat! I post art sometimes (ran out of ideas) and i've been meaning to put the fic up there but I'll do it eventually.
Vanessa snaps her fingers and from what Dean can tell, the shirt becomes instantly dried. "So–" Vanessa rubs her hands together, "–where were we?"
On the wall with the door is the incubator. It's large enough to fit three eggs, it's a boxy shape with a sliding glass door. Vanessa opens it and sets the egg down on the clean bedding. She fiddles with the buttons above the door to set it to her preferred setting.
"Well the first one I made didn't turn out as well as I wanted, but they found a place for it."
"We may not need this one specifically, " Cas says, taking the old book out of Dean's hands, "but I'm sure we might need the others. I may be an angel, but I don't know everything about us."
"Alas, no," Castiel shakes his head. "I have made a python, I mainly stuck to little snakes but I had two exceptions before I was assigned to making galaxies and other planets."
"Sounds great, when would we go?" Vanessa asks excitedly. The mention of fish gives her stomach something to growl over.
Vanessa starts laughing, so much so she almost loses her grip on the tile. "No, what do you think we eat in the ocean? Seaweed?" She answers in between laughs.
The next habitat they see is for wolves. There are five lying in the sun, three-light gray ones, one with red coloring, and one brown one.
"I may not be your brother," Dean starts and pulls Vanessa into his chest, filling her nose with his woodsy scent. "But I'll never forget it."
"Oh, okay, hopefully, he's back soon, " Vanessa says. She drinks her steaming tea in a comfortable silence until she goes to put the empty mug on the coffee table and notices all the books.
"Yeah. Me, Dean, and–" Sam gets interrupted again, but this time by an unfamiliar, gravely voice.
"That's what we should do, sign you up for that, and me and Sam wouldn't have to stay in motels!" Dean grins to himself.
When Dean reaches the bottom he staggers towards the voice's origin to find Sam sitting on the couch in the living room. "Yeah, " he groans rubbing his eyes. He quickly shuffles towards the opened windows and closes them all, his eyes adjust to the wonderful darkness, his small headache is quickly gone.
After ten minutes, the sound of the shower turning off tells everyone to start heading out. Dean and Bobby head to the impala as Vanessa stays behind to put her dragons away. Dean turns the keys and the impala roars to life as Bobby gets in the back, they wait not even a full minute for everyone to get into the car. Vanessa happily sits in the front to silently flirt with Dean and to help with directions as he starts blasting the radio.
"I remember the feeling of falling, but the only clearest thing I remember is Dean touching my neck," Tim explains as he starts to wolf down the beans. "This is delicious, you did a great job, Sam."
The hour passes by quickly as Dean reads in silence, only the sound of pages turning and the soft sound of his breath fills the library. That is until he hears fabric rub together, like when someone shifts in their seat.
Dean sighs, he knows he should listen to his brother about being careful, he's gotten into a lot of trouble for not listening, but the person down there could be dying! Plus, it's not that steep it's just deep.
Vanessa songs softly, her german accent disappearing with each word.
"Wow Sam," Vanessa examins whatever was in the bag, Dean and Castiel missed her reaction as she pulled it out and Sam never told him what he got her. "It's amazing."
"We're here," Vanessa sings, parking a few houses down from the witch's house.
"Oh, whatever. But how's my breakfast coming along?" Dean asks hungrily.
So if you wanna click the lil link and send me a message or follow me, you can now do it with ease!
"Uh, sure, " Dean says smoothly but he can tell that he's probably blushing. Tension builds in him as he watches Vanessa licks her lips and slowly fill up each glass bottle until the remains in the pot are all gone.
"I doubt that, but sure."
"As soon as your ready" Bobby answers.
Castiel sits Dean in a chair around the war room table, telling him firmly not to move. Dean sighs and crosses his arms across his chest, watching the angel bound towards the kitchen, Dean repress the urge to smile at the fact that Castiel took one of his band tees.
"When you groom them like you just were."
He turns around and heads for the door, as soon as he walks through Sam grabs him from behind, covers his mouth, and leads him away from the others. Once they're far enough, Vanessa cleanly cuts his head off and gags. "Man they stink" she murmurs.
"I-I'm not really in the mood to have birthday sex, I'm sorry, I just wanted a kiss," she mumbles and looks away.
The first exhibit they see is the lions. One male with a large brown mane is lazily sleeping under the shade with three other lions, clearly female.
Castiel and Vanessa take the living room seats as the old woman steps out of the room. "Sarah," she yells "we have guests and they are here for you."
"There, all done" she wipes her hands on her shirt, quickly looking away from Cas, who thankfully hasn't noticed her blush. She sits on the floor next to Sam's legs.
"Garlic's important?"
"Okay, but if I hear one comment about it, you're going in the lake," Dean grumbles.
"Your welcome? It's just breakfast Nessa," Dean says before eating his breakfast.
"So what we're you guys talkin' about? And can I have that?" Dean asks and points at her untouched drink. Vanessa nods and hands it to them, he takes a big sit of it and coughs. "Doesn't taste the same" he grumbles.
His brother's cries are faint now as a strange humming sound buzzes in his ears, making his hair on the back of his neck stand up, the smell of ozone and something that Dean can't pinpoint fills his lungs.
"This one's from me" Sam pulls it towards Vanessa. "Oh thank you. You boys didn't have to get my anything, I would've been happy just watchin' a movie," Vanessa says appreciatively. She slowly pulls out the tissue paper.
Bobby says.
"How'd you know?" Dean chuckles, his laugh carries over the quiet lake. "How many siblings do you have?"
Dean moves closer to the duo as Vanessa holds Malachite steady, Dean wraps his arms around Malachite's wings and pins her to the floor, allowing Vanessa to let go of her tail and move to her head.
"Cas this is Vanessa, Vanessa this is Castiel" Sam hisses as he props himself on his elbows.
See y'all next time, byeeeeeee (don't forget to leave a kudos or a comment, I'll appreciate it!)
"Moring," Sam says, not looking up from his laptop.
"You just rescued someone that fell out of the sky!"
"Would you be willing to do that again later?" Dean turns his head to look at her. Her chocolate brown eyes that Dean loves are back again meaning her gills are gone, but her long nails and the webbing between her fingers remain.
Some of the notes talked about how the wings are sensitive to touch, which Vanessa figured out a while ago. Other notes talked about how during the whole experiment, only one person who could see the angel's wings was the author.
"Thank you," Vanessa whispers, she snuggles her face into the crook of his neck, breathing in his woodsy scent. Vanessa starts rubbing her damp cheek on his neck.
Once Vanessa steeps inside, all the spells come crashing down on her, she tries to show it's not bothering her but it is giving her a major migraine.
"Really? Wow, that's awesome!" Dean exclaims. Vanessa looks at Dean and rolls her eyes. "It really is, Sam and I have seen a lot of things, and I bet you'll be the prettiest."
Hot off the press at...11:52 at night! Wow so close to midnight.
"I know what you're talking about, the name doesn't translate to English or any other language really, so people mainly call it the Atlantic war, " Vanessa explains as she picks up one of the books. She coos as she lightly runs a large nail over the cover of it. "Many sirens died in that war, it was horrific, my family lost my great-great-a-lot-of-greats-grandpa, he fought heroically, " Vanessa says, quickly blinking as if she was trying not to cry.
The next couple of chapters are just lore and backstories on a few of the angels, but Vanessa takes the time to read each word carefully. The rest of the chapters are just notes from a group of men called the letters? They have captured an angel and studied them.
"Thank you for all the help," Tim grumbles as he adjusts the seatbelt to his liking. "I am very grateful."
"I know, it doesn't smell very good, it probably tastes just as bad. But Cas and Sam said you've done it before, so I believe you can do it again" Vanessa says reassuringly.
"Do you have wrapping paper? Cause I didn't have any nor a chance to buy some and wrap her presents," Dean says, standing up and grabbing the bag.
Dean can't help but beam as he watches the manatee slowly float by them. "Hey, Dean," Castiel turns his head to Dean, his gorgeous ocean blue eyes meet his. "I'm ready to go when you are, I've had a wonderful time, I'm glad that you asked me out."
"Deean," she moans, she snakes her hands into his hair and gently tugs. "Deaan, c-can you please stop?"
Vanessa opens her mouth to object but Dean cuts her off. "And I don't know what I did or said to upset you, but I'm sorry." Dean visibly swallows."And I know you probably don't wanna talk about why it upset and I don't want to upset you even more by pushing you about it, but just know I am truly sorry."
"That's what you said yesterday Dean," Sam chides. "We can't just put this off, he-" Sam points to Tim," -could be a ticking time bomb for all we know."
Deciding to give the angel a piece of his mind out of the park, Dean furiously pulls out his wallet and throws out the money in cash, and mutters "Keep the change."
So cute!
Sam nods and heads outside to grab clean clothes for him and Dean. Dean walks to the couch and sits down with a sigh. "
Vanessa smiles, "you see something you like?" Vanessa swims towards them, her large tail propelling her effortlessly through the water. Her once pink hair has turned the same shade of brown as her eyes.
"It's fine, I'm fine with a blowjob, anything from you will be just fine, " he purrs, he kisses her again and leaves a trail from her lips to her jaw, to her neck, he sucks on it planning on leaving a nice big mark.
"Yeah, I getcha" Dean replies. The sound of shoes hitting the tile in the kitchen nearly makes Dean jump.
"Ha, no, you didn't. After you sang to me, that was probably one of the best nights' sleep I've ever gotten," Dean says, standing straight up and stretching again. This time no magic stops him from heading the door.
"You can read all about my kind, how there are five main tribes, named after the oceans, and the seven lesser tribes, named after seas" Vanessa explains.
Vanessa picks up their long tail and sits next to Bobby. "This one's a girl and her name is Malachite" she pats her green with the blue-ish black striped scaly thigh "and that one is a male, his name is Pluto" at the sound of his name, his light with small dark blue spots fan things that are probably his ears, perk up but he doesn't turn away from Sam. He, in fact, puts his front legs which double as his wings onto Sam's lap, and Sam lets out a pitiful squeak. Pluto lifts himself with his strong back legs to lick the side of Sam's face when he does that Dean starts laughing like a maniac.
Tim grabs the straw between his fingers and twirls it. "Tear the top off," Sam says before he tears into his salad. Tim does as Sam says and turns it upside down, letting the straw slide out. Dean swallows down a bite of fries and plops the straw in the chocolate milk and takes a sip.
"My family are one of the oldest out there, we moved inland way before America was 'discovered'" Vanessa explains "but we are originally from the Atlantic tribe, well it's technically called something else but its true name is in mermadick."
"Morning Sam, want some eggs?" Vanessa asks before adding "I'll be making crumb cake too." With a snap of her fingers, the bottle of rat poison disappears before Sam can notice.
"Oh but you will, " Vanessa turns to glare at him before moving the bacon around, "if I don't hand this over, I can get fired. My boss wants this lady dead, so I'll make her as dead as a doornail in the most delicious way possible! With my grandma's recipe!"
"It's okay," Dean pats the embarrassed angel on the shoulder. "How 'bout we see the next animals? I think we're coming up on the Africa area."
Castiel nods and rolls his shoulders again.
"But I like it the way they are," Tim gazes at Dean, his blue eyes boring into Dean's.
"Hey Vanessa, have I ever told you how these boys saved the world?" Bobby asks with a grin.
"It's only four gifts, Sam," Dean retorts after his brother claims that he went overboard. He adjusts in his spot across from the other couch that the others are sitting on, Daniel on the left and Sam on the right,  while Vanessa is right in the middle, and Castiel is awkwardly standing off to the side.
"Exactly," Dean says before pulling the angel into another kiss, this one more passionate than their first, leaving them both breathless before they break apart. "Now let's go before the food gets too cold."
Dean opens his mouth to answer when a loud crack comes from Vanessa. Dean can't help but shudder at the sound. "No thank you," he swallows his bite, hoping he doesn't get sick from the noise of Vanessa chewing.
The sound of the elevator opening brings Vanessa back to reality, she turns off her phone and steps out of the elevator, past a small family of three. She jogs down the hall towards the main room, she turns left to the dining room.
Vanessa sucks in a breath and some of her tea. A ghost? No...no...no...Vanessa promised herself no ghosts, no looking at them, no being near them, and certainly no talking about them. "No," Vanessa says through coughs.
"Oh trust me I do, but isn't my turn to return the favor?" Dean grins, his nose nearly bumping into Vanessa's.
"That can be arranged, " Dean purrs, grinning from ear to ear.
"We're almost halfway there, I say we hit up a gas station then head straight home," Dean turns to face Sam and Tim. "Sounds good or no?"
Vanessa nods, "yes, my family have been around for a very long time and we get paid very well for our job" she explains.
"You should probably wake up" Hadiya grabs Vanessa's doll and starts playing with it.
Cas quickly looks away, "yes, I'm fine, it's just cars are exceedingly slow" Cas grits through his teeth.
"What? What's the best part?"
"I don't understand how you could drive in silence" Vanessa mutters as she fiddles with the volume. She smiles as a Led Zeppelin song comes on.
"Fine." She snaps coldly.
"They're gentle giants, like blue whales, but what's your favorite TV show Dean?" Vanessa nudges him as he thinks.
"Which aunt?" Vanessa asks before taking a sip of her tea.
"It's important okay? I know it's a little gross but it's what makes the potion work!" Vanessa hisses.
"None besides a demon," Sam shrugs, glancing down at his phone.
"But we haven't deci-"
"Yeah, so I wanna ask you if you'd wanna go out sometime?" Dean's gaze breaks from Vanessa, sliding to something in the darkness.
"Where are we?" Tim asks, his gaze immediately shifts to the window.
"There," she says, she clears her throat, trying to remember how he spoke. How deep his voice was, how loud he was, and how he pronounces each letter. "Alright, I'll go in there, boss someone around and lead them out here, where you'll jump out and kill them," she says in the vamp's gruff voice.
"No, it's fine, I love this band," Vanessa says quickly and shoos his hand away from the radio.
"Only one," she wags her finger in the air. Dean grabs her hips and crushes his lips onto hers. Vanessa sighs and wraps her arms around his neck, their lips fitting perfectly together. Dean digs his fingers into her hips, pulling her impossibly closer to his warm body.
"Angels can't get sick Vanessa," he smiles and shoos her hand away.
They fall into a comfortable silence, not counting them blurting out the answers, which surprisingly to Dean Tim nails each one. Dean can't help but glance over at the man, his wild hair doesn't seem to be singed anymore and his eyes appear to be glowing from the faint TV light.
"You should make it a boy," Sam says as he scoops up oatmeal.
Curiosity bubbles inside him as he realizes that he is only a few feet away, he could just slowly peel back the blankets to see what she grabbed or he could just leave and complete his goal of wrapping her presents.
"I'm just glad you decided to go along with my lame date idea," Dean mutters and floats towards her, Dean drapes his arms around her belly as they drift closer to the middle of the lake.
"Just worms, for now, shall do," Dean says, watching in awe as Vanessa snaps her fingers and a plastic box with a cartoonish worm appears in front of them. "Sweet, alright, you know how to do this right?"
They watch as Vanessa takes off from where they left and pulls a black hoodie that has the Miles Morales symbol on it. "This looks awesome Dean! Thank you so much!" Vanessa exclaims gleefully. "I'm going to have to wash these immediately, especially this one." Vanessa picks up the shirt that was in Malachite's mouth.
"No," Sam shakes his head, grabbing one of the books from Dean's small pile. "And Bobby still hasn-" Dean's phone buzzes in his pocket, making him jump in his chair. "Speak of the devil," Sam grumbles as Dean fishes the buzzing phone out of his pocket.
"Be on your best behavior," Dean whispers to Tim, placing his hand on his very warm shoulder, Dean leads him up to the front door.
"Dibs on being the money bag," Dean snatches the little money bag and immediately gets zapped. "Ouch," he rubs his palm.
"No problem, " Cas replies with a small smile, his beautiful wings proudly twitching behind him "you ready?"
"What would that be?" Dean asks though he has a feeling he knows what it is.
"I wish, but no I only have the dragons," Vanessa says. "When are we going to take down this small coven?"
In the middle of the room is a large oak desk with the newest computer on it and a large black office chair like the ones in the movies, directly behind the desk is a large window with blackout blinds, next to the window are two large bookshelves that touch the ceiling and are filled to the brim with old dusty books. It's been...a while since Vanessa has been in this house since it's so far north, but it has been in her family for a long time.
"I swear to the seas if you manage to rip my brand new shirt, I am going to be livid," Vanessa growls, she grabs the shirt with one hand as blue smoke flows out of her other hand and pries Malachite's mouth open letting the shirt sleeve slip from her teeth.
"Thanks for all the help," Dean says, putting his hands in his jeans pockets.
"Not from what I remember. I bet I could find five right now," Vanessa eyes the lake, but she can barely see past her hips from the murky water. Her blueish-brown tail blending in seamlessly.
I do have a Tumblr (don't know how to link it) just search blueberryrock and I'll come up, I post some art and I try to post my writing stuff there, so feel free to drop in and say hi!
The front half of his shirt is soaking wet, Dean hopes it's water from a faulty sink and doesn't want to imagine what else it could be.
"How convenient," Dean smirks as he changes it to youtube.
"Now don't judge me when I tell you this."
The other end goes quiet for a minute.
"It's adorable Dean," Vanessa coos as she flips it around. It's the mother of dragons shirt that he found, he knew she would like it but he had doubts.
Vanessa wonders,
"You don't?" Vanessa smiles, helping her dad pick up the wrapping paper.
Vanessa scratches right around where Pluto's horns begin, knowing that it's the best place to scratch. Pluto lets out a pleasured filled purr as Vanessa digs her nails into his scaley skin.
"Well, then, I was going to ask now but I'm not sure if it's appropriate anymore," Dean rubs the back of his neck, a small blush creeps onto the cheeks.
"You're on," Dean says with a smirk.
"Take him back to camp, and get him some pants," Dean says grabbing the stranger's arm, not flinching from how hot his skin is, and leading him into the forest.
"There is something I do have to tell you, " she says, pulling away from the kiss.
"Nice, mint chocolate ice cream is delicious, but aren't you gonna ask me?" Dean shoots an exaggerated frown at Vanessa.
"Whatever, I'll give you one before you boys leave I'll slip it to Sam."
Vanessa is comfortably curled up on her bed with a large leather book in her lap. "Did you need something Dean?" She asks softly.
"I...um.." Dean quickly looks at her microwave that says its currently 6:35. "Yes, I'm fine. Uhh, Sam is in your shower, and you look nice too" he nervously says.
"Damn it's hot, why does it have to be Texas" Dean complains, as he shields his eyes he gets a good look at her house. The house is at least two stories with a light coming from one of the bottom windows, the front of the house is made up of red brick while the sides are white paneling. Sam and Dean walk up the slight hill towards the front door, Dean knocks on the door as Sam rings the doorbell. A curse from inside makes Dean knock on the door again.
"I think someone is trying to break into your house," Hadiya says calmly.
"Sam?" Vanessa yells from the kitchen.
Dean scrubs his face with his hands. "Was there wings?" Tim asks seriously, his eyes watching Dean's phone sternly.
"My, uh, siren form. I think right now is the perfect time to do it, although you guys might wanna put on a jacket or something, " Vanessa explains excitedly.
Feel free to leave kudos and comments of course, adios!
"Fish!" Vanessa exclaims, sitting up immediately.
"I don't think I have been in any motel this nice," Castiel mutters, his eyes glued onto one of the TVs above the bar.
The oldest witch raises her hand and all three of them start floating in the air, by at least a few inches, and slam into the wall. "I'm going to make it up to them, and all of the witches you've killed, Vanessa Goodwin" she grits between her teeth. She slowly walks up to Vanessa and holds the knife up to her heart. "Maybe I'll carve out your heart and soul and resurrect one of them, or use your blood for something useful" she growls.
These chapters will probably be as long as this one, I hope y'all don't mind but I find writing them really fun.
They have a cool wall with a bunch of t-shirts, some with zebras that they saw earlier, others with a cool design of a snake. There is also a rack of stuffed animals ranging from wolves to hummingbirds and butterflies.
"That's fine, " Vanessa says smoothly. She looks up at Cas, his stunning wings nearly taking up the long room. "But you'll stay out there with me, right?" Vanessa says, almost using her puppy eyes on him.
"Thank you? Did you spend this time exploring my house?" Vanessa asks with a small smile as she takes another bite.
"I'd be surprised if they weren't! Dean, we need to think this through," Sam sighs. "Let's start by calling Bobby, maybe he can help?"
"I accept your apology, and I'm sorry too, I thought that it was a date and it clearly wasn't. I guess I got my signs confused again." Castiel looks sadly away from Dean.
"Okay move, I need to walk inside" she smiles as the dragons start intensely sniffing where she wiped the blood off. "It went fine, I made the classic offer of dragon hearts and whoever I'm with's soul. Which thankfully you boys have" she says as she collapses on the empty couch.
Vanessa turns away from Castiel and to the bedside table. Glass from the lamp's bulb is everywhere, including her phone.
"I fucking hate my boss, so while I was helping Sam and Cas rescue you, I was supposed to kill a very bad witch that hasn't done her revaluation, which it's just a way to keep track of how strong everyone is," Vanessa explains as she walks over to the fridge and pulls out a couple of eggs, " she also kidnapped people to use in spells" she quickly adds.
"It's been soo long, c-can I sceent you again?" Vanessa asks, pushing away to look into his eyes. Dean could stare for hours into them, they are so brown that it makes him crave chocolate, and god he loves them. But today they seem...paler...and the bags under them aren't doing them justice.
"Come in Dean," she sighs, her heart starts pounding as Dean opens the door and Vanessa takes a shaky breath in.
"Voila!" She says as she puts it in front of Sam, with another snap of her fingers, her male syrup bottle appears between them.
"Really?" Vanessa looks at Castiel, his face is somehow even redder. "I would think that in your billions of years you would have someone touching these."
"Vanessa, I won't allow you to hand that over to someone."
"Which would be what? If I cheat on her she turns me into a fish?" Dean jokes.
"Has Bobby called yet?"
"Sounds about right, well let's go and get el jefe's blood then go," Vanessa says as she cheerfully walks out the room, creating a small glass vile out of thin air. She sniffs out where Sam hid Dave's body and gathering as much blood that's needed.
Dean immediately freezes and looks at her. "Is something wrong?" Dean asks worriedly.
Vanessa walks down the hallway calmly, summoning her phone for her room, she reads through the local news for any signs of a runaway witch, but nothing has come up. Distracted, she almost runs into the elevator, she presses the button, and the doors open.
"I-I don't know about that Dean, " she says and brushes a strand of her messy pink hair out of her face, "don't get me wrong, I'd love to travel the country with you three and hunt shit, but I have responsibilities like a job, a very flexible job yes, but a job none the less, and two full-grown dragons! Not to mention I have the full fucking moon to deal with."
Turns out Vanessa has had lots of weird food, she has gotten her hands on a lionfish and a peacock before, which she claims that they still aren't the weirdest thing she has eaten. While the weirdest thing Dean has eaten was a camel.
"Man, I'm surprised that Vanessa has a coffee maker but no coffee," Dean says as he takes the last sip of his hot chai tea.
Dean glares, crossing his arms trying to hide the building feeling deep in his chest. He knows he shouldn't feel this way, the worst part is he can't tell if he is mad that Vanessa is hugging Castiel or the fact that Castiel is hugging Vanessa, but he buries that thought.
"Alright, hand me a towel," Vanessa watches Dean bound off to the cabin, she looks down at her lower half, now she regrets going swimming.
"I heard that you are supposed to buy gifts for someone's birthday, so I did just that," he lifts the bag. "You can open it early if you'd like."
(See the end of the chapter for
"The three of you?"
"W-wow Cas, way to make a man feel special," Dean says, a light blush creeps onto his face.
"Whatever," Vanessa mutters as all of her fight leaves her, tired of arguing she crosses her arms and looks down at the ground.
Vanessa sings the first part beautifully as she grabs the spatula and serves Sam his breakfast, she eagerly turns up the radio and turns the song up, she clears her throat (and to Dean's amazement) and mimics the lead singer, Steve Perry's, voice.
"Good f-fuking going me," Vanessa growls as a tear breaks free and runs down her face, she turns on the dusty computer with shaky hands and tries to type in the password. After a few tries, she finally cracks the code and opens her email to find a billion spam emails and one email from her boss. She deletes all the spam and opens the email from her boss.
"Dammit Lir," Vanessa curses at her brother as she grabs her ringing phone, swipes, and places it to her ear. "What do you want?"
Dean glances back at the stove to make sure nothing will catch on fire for the minute he's gone then goes over to help Tim. "It's easy," Dean says hovering over the plate and picking up the bottle of syrup. "You wanna pour this stuff over the pancakes, like so," he says as he drowns the pancake with the sweet syrup. "Then you cut up the pancakes with the fork then stuff it in your mouth. Voila!"
"Is this the equivalent of you proposing to me?" Dean looks up at Vanessa, with a serious look on his face.
Until next time <3
"That's a very simple plan," Cas says, "and Dean might attack you two, so I should be the one to rescue him."
And yes I use shouldn't've almost every day! It's a real word!
"I'm umm, yeah," Dean mumbles as he feels blush creep up from his neck. "Me too."
"Speaking of presents," Daniel snaps his fingers. "Your aunt's gift came today, I gave Sam the key when he left."
"Well surprise, surprise, I'm not a normal witch. I'm what they'd call a warlock" Vanessa explains "we're rare, it happens when one twin steals almost all of the magic from the other, making them nearly human."
"Iz zeemet like you veren't having a very pleasant dream, zo I pulled you out of itz," she announces. "Do you vanna zalk about itz?" She looks away.
"I have that one too," Vanessa says before snapping her fingers and the shirts and hoodie gets replaced with a fully ser up game of monopoly. "But we're playing this, with beer." She snaps her fingers again and a cold beer appears in front of everyone.
Castiel looks at her, his electric blue eyes bore into hers. "It's not, I know for a fact that you like Dean, and I am messing with that."
Enjoy <3
"Werewolf witches?" Dean mutters "were-witches," he says making Vanessa and himself smile.
"I'll meet you, Sam, and Vanessa, there," Bobby tells Dean as he scratches both purring dragons, "and Dean."
They hop in Vanessa's car, with no need to pack any extra weapons, they leave as quickly as possible. Vanessa turns on the radio, humming, and kind of dancing to whatever energetic song came on, while Castiel watches her lovingly from the back seat where his wings won't get in the way.
"I'm fine," she says as he releases her hand.
"When is it?"
"Well, that is because someone forgot to mention that we were out of coffee beans," Dean says, sending a glare to Sam's way, who just lets out a huff and ignores Dean. "And we were lucky our milk didn't go bad."
"Sounds good to me," Castiel tears his gaze from the tv to Vanessa, his blue eyes seem to glow in the morning light.
"Yeah I can hear the engine," Vanessa sighs as she moves her hand away from her necklace.
"Morning sunshine" Dean replies with and smile, she combs through her frizzy pink hair.
Thank the seas that the boys don't know much about her past, but Vanessa knows she'll have to open up someday, and maybe that date can help.
"What's your favorite color?" Dean glances over at Vanessa after casting his line out into the lake.
"I...uh..." Casa fiddles with buttons on his trench coat.
"Yes tomorrow is technically my hatchday as my mom didn't give birth to me, my sister, or my brother," Vanessa says nonchalantly.
"Magnets," he corrects. "And yes, I found two, couldn't decide on which to buy, so I said fuck it and grabbed both."
"C'mon Dean, you can go naked for all I care," Vanessa calls through the cabin's front door. Vanessa is currently wrapped in a towel that she brought with nothing underneath except for the necklace around her neck, she ignores the slight burning sensation from the silver charms and the increasing bug bites on her bare legs as she waits for Dean to change.
"Whatever, but if he kills us in our sleep, I will murder you," Sam follows.
It takes me some time to write these because I've always liked reading books and fics with longer chapters so I try to write longer chapters, which takes me time to write than go back to edit on my own.
I mainly post Lord of the Rings stuff now, but I'm sure if you ask or say hello, I can and probably will talk about spn lol.
"Thanks," Vanessa says before she uses her magic like before to get rid of the husk.
Vanessa picks up her fork then hungrily looks over her plate. In the middle of the big chunk of salmon, next to it is eggs and a few slices of bacon, as well as some toast. "Thank you, Dean, you don't understand how much this means to me," Vanessa says before stuffing the eggs and bacon into her mouth, wanting to save the fish for last.
Vanessa snuggles up to Dean and sighs, taking in his scent that's mixed with hers. Her mind starts to shift to the question she knows Dean is going to ask. Will you go on a date with me?
"When I went to grab Dean he, umm, said he didn't want to hurt me, but he was scared and he lashed out. " Cas explains, "he's in the car now, peacefully asleep"
They both nod eagerly. "You boys are lucky I'm doing this, I don't like people seeing them," Vanessa sighs and closes her eyes, she runs her tongue over her gums, making her sharp needle-like fangs appear. When she opens her eyes, Cas and Dean can't help but flinch when they notice that they're neon yellow. Vanessa gives them a toothy grin, showing off her fangs. She can feel her gills that are on her neck start to materialize, along with some scales on her shoulders, arms, and a few on her face, and she can feel her fingers becoming webbed. Her ears that are hidden by her hair also become fin-like.
"As soon as Sam's done, we'll go," She says as she magically pulls out her phone from thin air, "warning though, it's kind of a bar for supernatural folk, and I don't wanna get kicked out again by hunters, so all I ask is for you guys to behave".
"I think I could do it if it's less than a week," Vanessa says, grabbing her mug of untouched tea.
"It'll be done soon, I'm surprised you didn't pack up today and drive us to a diner," Sam says as he stirs Dean's can of beans.
"Look, " she says after clearing her throat, Dean's eyes snap right back to hers, "I try not to help hunters, and I am not going to help any Winchester, which is a shame," she says with a slight smile as her brown eyes slide over to the flustered Dean "considering how cute you are, but I promised myself that I wasn't going to help any hunters; now if you excuse me I have things I need to–" she starts closing the door but hesitates as the sound of Bobby's car comes around the corner and parks in her empty driveway.
"Hey, Dean, it's me, remember? Vanessa...uhh Vanessa Goodwin?" Vanessa says in the most soothing voice she can muster. His chest quickly heaves up and down in a steady flow.
"I'm thinking that after this we could get some lunch," Dean tells Castiel as he grabs his cards and tickets.
"Here you go, " Dean picks up a tall glass vile of iridescent gray scales and places it next to the stove.
"Why not? As I said, no plans," Vanessa says, trying to scratch her back.
"It works just the same," Vanessa moans. "And who needs legs for an awesome blow job?" Vanessa turns easily in Dean's arms, pushing him lightly into the sand, she runs one of her long talons gently over his bare chest.
"You're so strong, and handsome, can't forget that," Vanessa giggles and brushes her hand against his. He sighs and turns her away from the kitchen table, he directs her to the living room, making sure she doesn't trip and fall over anything.
"Yes, there is an old family remedy that works, but I usually just sleep in the pool until the full moon" Vanessa sighs, fiddling with her hair instead of scratching her legs.
"See you later, alligator" she yells as she opens her door.
"Sure I'll take a few slices" Sam replies as he eats the rest of his apple and tosses it in the trash can, next to the island. Vanessa walks past the table, walks around the island, and towards her fridge. She grabs an egg and heads to her stove, with a snap of her fingers the stove turns on and a pan appears. She quickly grabs a bowl from her cupboard and gets to work. After making at least half a loaf of bread, she splits it between her and Sam and brings it to the table.
"Guess I'll start on the pies, should have run in to grab apples," Dean sits up and stretches, his back popping as he does.
Mid chew, Dean turns his head to look at the angel. His dark hair a mess from the flight, his gorgeous blue eyes lock with Dean's green ones. His large beautiful black wings are tucked neatly behind him, his long primary feathers nearly touching the floor. In his hands is a large stack of books, all of which have a leather cover.
Vanessa's brother, Lir, sings.
"Lame," Dean takes his fork and digs into the actual cake. "This cake is awesome, where'd you find the candles?" Dean asks with a full mouth, twirling a candle between his fingers.
Vanessa throws her arms around her father. "I'm glad you could make it dad, hopefully, mother can make it next year."
"But what are you doing down here, go back upstairs" Vanessa stands up to tell Dean.
He rubs his tired face, heading back to grab his pillow and blanket from the tent, he unzips the zipper halfway before he hears a strange noise.
Quickly, Dean blinks his thoughts away and turns back to the TV with a sigh. He sips more of his beer rapidly until he realizes he's all out, standing from his recliner, Dean pats Tim on the shoulder and tells him he'll be right back.
She wiggles up towards him, his chest still heaving up and down. She snuggles right on his shoulder and into the crook of his neck. "That. Was. Amazing, " Dean says between breaths.
"Who did Bobby say we're supposed to meet?" Sam asks as Dean turns down the radio.
"Crumb cake?"
the money bag," Vanessa says, placing her token on go. "And the banker, so strap in, we'll be here for a few hours."
"Got it," Dean nods. "If I need anything I'll call you."
She sighs and makes the mirror disappear, she puts the soft t-shirt on and walks over to her dresser to find pants. Once she finds a good fuzzy black pair she quickly exits her room and runs down the stairs, eager to confront Dean and have his breakfast.
"This isn't lame! Did you not just hear me saying how wonderful this is?" Vanessa glances at Dean with a bewildered smile on her face. "You brought me to catch fish! And to hang out, of course, but this is the best date I've been on so far. Even better than the rock show, I went to a couple of years back."
"Thanks," he says before he starts digging in. He pauses to watch his brother sleepily walk into the kitchen, his hair a mess, and his eyes still closed.
"Have fun on your little date," Sam quickly calls out before Dean can realize. He shuts the door and plays back what Sam said, turning a light shade of red.
Vanessa sticks her tongue out at him as she opens her container and hums, Dean glances over at it to find it's full of shells. "Are those snails?" He asks before taking a bite of his delicious burger.
"I'm not sure how long these fishing poles have been here," Dean mumbles as he heads towards the front door. "If they break, I can just repair them," Vanessa gleefully follows behind him.
Once she's done she walks over to the door, putting on her tennis shoes, and opens the door. The hallway is not busy at all, the walls are painted a light tan while the carpet is black.
pm. Vanessa sighs again and pushes herself off her couch and walks past the coffee table, past the front door, and turns to go upstairs to bed. Unfortunately, her dragons aren't here to keep her warm and protected, not that she needs it, they're staying with a friend that takes care of dragons, they took them in to help socialize them more.
Vanessa watches as Cas climbs into the back, carefully making sure his wings fit and he doesn't accidentally sit on his feathers. Sam impatiently drums his fingers on the steering wheel and decides to back out of the driveway as Cas closes the door. They drive in almost complete silence, except for the slight hum of the engine. Vanessa glances from Sam to the radio, hoping he'd notice and turn it on. When he doesn't she slowly moves her hand towards it and pauses, she looks for a button that would be the on button but Sam pushes it before she could even find it.
Dean stays in bed, hoping to have more wonderful dreams until the smell of breakfast makes him get up. He pulls off the thick blankets to find that he completely ruined Vanessa's pants.
They slowly pull apart, blush on both of their faces. "That was lovely," Vanessa says slowly moving her arms from his neck.
And apparently it's also Cas' birthday today lol, so enjoy this chapter and I'll see y'all soon!
"Yes, well, there was no use of going down there then, so no one used a dinosaur as a vessel, but if we had to, yes," Castiel grumbles as Vanessa snaps her fingers and more drinks appear. "Okay, no more question please."
"Calm down, she's not a demon" Bobby sighs. Vanessa lightly touches under her eye then mouths 'oh yeah'.
Dean lets her sing the next part by herself.
So yeah, leave a kudos or whatever and I'll see y'all next time
To which Dean just replies with a curt "shut up." Tim slides into the recliner next to him, pulling the lever to make the footrest go up like Dean had shown him the day before. "So what is this?" Tim turns his head to look at Dean.
"That is a hard place you've put me in Winchester," Vanessa grins, she closes the gap between them and wraps her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. "How about I give you a quickie and you make me dinner and call it even."
"Cas," she groans, her throat still sore, "I need to get up."
"Nah I'm good, plus I wanna see more animals, so more walking less talking."
"I did Abuela, she is lying!" Sarah says, glaring at Vanessa.
"Really?" Dean asks surprised.
Unfortunately, they're interrupted by Sam honking the horn and yelling "I don't wanna watch this, either stay here or get your ass in the car", making them pull away from each other.
"It's a good surprise," Castiel says excitedly. "Sam and I have been working on it all day."
"Alright, put your shoes on now," Dean mutters as he watches the road for the exit. The narrow exit road takes them to a small gas station next to a tractor supply store. Letting Baby come to a rolling stop beside the pump, Dean takes the keys out of the ignition and steps out, groaning as he stretches out his back.
"Ha! I win" Dean says as he finishes swallowing the last bite of his burger "what's my prize?"
"Hey, I just wanted to check on you and apologize for making you upset at breakfast," Dean says, closing the door behind him, he stands awkwardly in front of the desk.
Vanessa sighs, she's still extremely upset that Sarah got away and even more upset that Castiel wouldn't let her fully chase after her. Vanessa grabs one of the pillows and wraps it around her stomach, her mother would always do this for her when she got anxious, Vanessa never understood why it works well but it does for her.
Till next, bye!
Dean sighs and turns to look at Vanessa. "But it wasn't all bad, I got to spend time with you three."
blueberryrock.tumblr.com there is the link!

"Alrighty then," Dean says, but no one moves, Vanessa gives him a quick peck on the cheek before turning around and heading for the door.
"That's cool," Dean says as he watches the sleepy lions. They move on to the cheetahs, which are pressed against the fence.
As always, if y'all wanna find me and talk to me, I'm on Tumblr at blueberryrock! I don't actually ever use the side blog I made to put up my fics, but I haven't deleted it yet, but go follow me over there and say hi!
The diner is small, just like any others, with dark blue walls and sandy-colored floors. Booths line the walls as tables are scattered across the floor.
"He's talking about my little party trick," Vanessa says. "Here, I'll show you but I need a better song to sing to," Vanessa mutters the last part as she scrolls through her phone that's connected to the radio. With a grin, Vanessa starts up another song by Journey.
Dean rolls his eyes and crosses his arms. "Well when you're done freaking out, chew the beans then swallow them. And before you put your next scoop in your mouth gently blow on them."
The egg is a bit bigger than an ostrich's and a lot scalier. It has a pale pink coloring with a blue stripe going around the middle with deep red specks all over it. "You were talking to your brother 'bout getting another one so I found a good breeder, and I know you had everything set up so I bought it instead."
Dean looks at her eyes again and notices that she as slits for pupils. "If you're not a demon, then what the hell are you," Dean asks as he scoots his chair closer.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright, I'll be back with your drinks," the waiter quickly finishes writing down their orders as he walks away.
Ooooh, the story is getting spicy! Technically in the show, Anna's parents get killed and she gets attacked, but I decided to change that of course, I hope y'all don't mind.
"A million is a lot, Dean."
"One of my dates did that," Vanessa mumbles as she plops herself next to Dean. "Pushed me into a pond and the water made me shift automatically."
"The comet person seemed to land over that way," Dean points past the tent into the dark forest. "Be on high alert, I don't know what it could be."
Vanessa nods. "Would you two like to see?"
"Maaybe, " Vanessa says as she sprinkles in a little bit of the seasoning. "It has important ingredients in it and I find it amusing, "
"Your new friend, I would never carve out anyone heart or soul, nor would I do that to an innocent dragon. They are endangered after all" Vanessa says as she wipes the blood off of her knife on her leggings.
"We were hunting down a vamp nest outside this city, there were too many for the three of us to handle so–" Sam gets interrupted by Vanessa.
"Mmm," Dean watches in amusement as Sam immediately freezes. "I'll have a salad with a coffee," Sam says quickly. "Ranch will be fine."
They work for several minutes in silence, Vanessa knows that this has killed the mood, she sighs, feeling returns to her legs as Vanessa starts wriggling violently.
Dean chews on his lip and glances in the rearview mirror for what seems to be the hundredth time. Tim sleeping with his head on the glass, his soft lips slightly parted, and his messy hair is just too distracting for Dean.
Dean pulls out the map at Castiel's request, he quickly finds where they are and then finds where the reptiles are. "It's on the other side of the zoo, we can circle around to see the animals over here then walk over there."
"Okay, my favorite TV show...of all time...is probably..." Dean sighs before saying. "Doctor Sexy MD."
"How? It's a yellow animal with black spots."
Vanessa sings.
After hours on the road, nearly hitting a duck and a rabbit and getting honked at by an asshole driver that didn't use their damn turn signal, Vanessa finally pulls into the hotel parking lot.
"Seven-thirtyish," Castiel replies, he watches in awe as Vanessa's tail starts crumbling around her legs. "I'll, umm, get you some fresh clothes," Castiel says, his face turning redder by the second, this time he doesn't bother going in the house, he stands up and spreads his wings and flies off.
"You'll see!" Vanessa says happily, "we'll have to go outside, it's kinda cold out there, so y'all might want blankets or something or I can make a fire."
"You okay?" Sam smirks at him.
"Okay, I guess, I-uh had a dream."
"That's quite a haul, " Sam says with a full mouth.
"Goodnight asshole."
pull out one of your feathers."
Once she gets her gills out, Vanessa lets out a louder wail which just sends air bubbles up to the surface. She makes sure to grow scales on her chest, but not as much as last time, just enough to keep everything covered and in place, not that she needs them covered around Dean. Vanessa lets out a final small whimper when she feels the fins along the side of her tail reak out of her skin, the thin membrane between her fingers grow quickly along with her nails.
Dean makes a quiet groan and turns the music up a hair and hums the melody to take his mind off of the backseat.
"Are those mine?" Vanessa asks with a smirk.
Dean pulls out their map to find that they missed the moose exhibit, maybe they can make a full circle and get a good picture of one for Sam.
Vanessa has always imagined angels as huge cosmic beings, which this book proves that she was right. This book says as tall as a skyscraper, but this was made a long time ago so it's not as accurate.
They make their way to the table and take their seats, Vanessa and Dean sit next to each other, Sam and Daniel take the ends, while Castiel takes the other side and spreads his wings.
Hello guys and gals! The next chapter is here as promised! And I still don't have a clear posting schedule but it will probably be every other Thursday, but just in case if you want any updates go follow my writing account on Tumblr rando-fandom-drabbles.tumblr.com I'll be posting the chapters up there as well!
"I've gotta ask," Dean says as they walk to a tank filled with turtles in it. "How many snakes did Lucifer make?" He made sure to whisper the last part to him.
"Sure" Dean calls after him, doubting that coffee will taste the same as before.
He runs back into the first room to have Vanessa thrown at him. He and Vanessa land on the floor as Sam runs into the room. "I told them to lay low" the last witch screeches. Dean notices that she is older than all the witches by at least a decade. "But no, they had to get of hunters and her," she says angrily as she points the knife at Vanessa.
The fins on her tail flare when she feels something brush against it, but Vanessa ignores it and scans the silty bottom. Hovering only a few inches from the lake floor, trying not to uproot any plants, Vanessa makes quick work to scan every inch, digging in some points to find the shells.
"Lemme guess, pie?"
The office door is behind on the far left wall if you face the kitchen. The garage could fir a car, but since it acts as an office, a large oak desk is facing the main wall with a tall bookshelf next to it. On the other side is some gym equipment that she sometimes uses.
"Yes, this is agent Flores and Hopson, they are here to see you," Maggie says, patting the couch for her granddaughter to sit.
"Okay then, I'll heal the both of you." Vanessa says as she pushed off her knees and stands up, "I'll grab some bandages, some of my healing herbs, and some whiskey, "
"Right. Well, we'll be there soon" Sam says as he starts spending down the empty road. After thirtyish minutes, they turn left and silently drive down a dirt road, leading to a large plantation house. Two cars are parked outside and Sam parks right behind one of them.
"Yup," Vanessa says, popping the 'P'. Vanessa grabs the end of the fishing rod to inspect her hook. It's rusty with dried guts all over it, Vanessa rolls it in her fingers and uses her magic to clean it; then sticks a fresh worm on the end and throwing it out to the lake.
"It's par-" Dean interrupts Castiel. "Don't you tell me it's part of the damn game! I don't understand how you of all people are beating the shit out of us!"
Vanessa shrugs, "they're friends" she licks her lips, and all three of the witches lunge at them.
"Not just my tail, my fins, and gills too." Vanessa explains, "and I assume you guys will be here for as long as Dean needs, and that might be through the full moon."
Dean glances at the families around them, admiring the big cat in front of them. "I wouldn't do it here, plus a bit of walk never hurt anyone."
Now onto the chapter!
"You look like a mess," Sam says. She looks up at him, her browns eyes seem to be eerily glowing yellow in the dark.
"Really? I thought God made all the creatures," Dean retorts, his eyes glued on the wolves and not on the angel that is practically touching him.
"I'm fine, that reminds me, us three need to have a little talk. I assume Dean is currently sleeping so I'll tell him later" Vanessa says, she pulls her pajama pants legs up and reveals her scarlet legs. "A full moon is coming,  which means, like a werewolf, I will shift."
Dean groans as his hardening member presses against Vanessa's hips. They finally pull away to catch their breaths and for Vanessa to pull off her shirt and Dean leads her to the bed. Dean easily pushes Vanessa onto her back, admiring her gorgeous body. A black lacy bra is currently stopping Dean from a full view, he climbs on top of her to take her bra off.
"A spoon? No." Tim studies the spoon and holds it in a fist.
"Sorry, they don't take the bacon off," Vanessa says as she puts the burger in front of Dean and puts down her food. She starts passing everyone their beers before she sits down but someone rudely bumps into her making her spill hers and Dean's beer all over her dress, but it bounces off and splatters all over the floor. She closes her eyes in anger and turns around to confront the person.
"Where would we get fishing poles?" Vanessa asks as Dean slides into the driver's seat.
"How did you sleep?" Dean asks as Vanessa slowly opens her eyes and looks up at him.
"Yes, Dean?" Vanessa controls her voice to make it sound calm and relaxed.
"I've never seen you concerned about any of us, the newbie must be someone very special" she giggles.
"At least you like bacon! I once dated a vegan girl, well we didn't really date, only went out twice, but she was one of the vegans who made their cat vegan too," Dean says before adding. "I hate those kinds of people."
Dean glances over at him and bites his lip. "Uh, this zoo has tigers, polar bears, elephants, and stuff like that."
"How much longer until we reach 'the bunker' Dean?" Tim tilts his head and meets Dean's eyes in the rearview mirror.
"Look, we'll make this as quick as we can, I promise," Vanessa says as she helps Sam to his feet.
"Wow, that's pretty interesting, " Sam says, the look on his face told Dean that Sam will read every book Vanessa owns.
Dean sighs, settling down in his recliner, he fiddles with the TV remote to set up reruns of Jeopardy. With an open beer in one hand, he takes a sip before placing it in the cupholder.
The front desk area is huge, next to the door is the desk and behind it is a large fake waterfall. Vanessa walks up to the desk, anxious to get checked in, and then to the lake. It's not late enough to actually be heading there, but Vanessa is too anxious not to. This is gonna be a long hunt.
"Sounds good," Castiel nods, not tearing his gaze away from his creation. Dean turns to the angel, he's never seen such pure bliss on his face before, and if they were on a date (which they are totally not) Dean would shower him with compliments on his smile and the way his eyes seem to crinkle when he does smile...
Dean slowly blinks and stifles a small yawn, last night was exciting, so exciting that no one but Tim could sleep. Part of it was Dean didn't want to die in his sleep, which he didn't, and he got maybe two hours, three at most. But as much as Sammy offered to drive, Dean refused and said he's fine. Which he is.
Vanessa hums, watching the sunset in her new courter's arms as waves wash over her tail is probably her new heaven. If she could freeze time, this might be one moment she'd want to stay in.
"We have guests?" An unfamiliar voice says, Vanessa looks at the girl. Her honey-colored hair is pulled into a high ponytail, her hazel eyes scan Castiel and Vanessa, Sarah has a small smile and paint all over her face ranging in different vibrant colors.
Vanessa skips towards her kitchen where Sam is currently getting everything set up. "I have everything ready, I just grabbed some random bowl" Sam states as he starts putting the ingredients in the bowl, then he dumps all the blood that's in the vial into the bowl and stirs it all together.
"Alright, first the rules," Vanessa grabs the rule book. "We have house rules that say that if you pass go you get two hundred and if you land on it you get double."
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. Vanessa told me a little bit about that, guess she was too shaken up about that, but she tells me great things about you two," he points to Sam and Dean.
"Thanks because my boss wants me to take on another job soon and my last hunt didn't go all too well," Vanessa sighs as she starts up the stairs.
"I don't know why you're so excited for a couple of reptiles," Dean chuckles as he slowly pulls the door open.
"Once again, your welcome," Dean says before taking another bite, this time digging into the salmon instead of saving it for last. "So, found anything yet?" Dean's gaze turns to Sam.
Once everything is done, Dean divides the food between three plates and pours everyone a steaming cup of tea. "Thanks, Dean," Vanessa says, she feels her face heating up as he sets it down in front of her.
Dean slowly pulls up to the cabin, parking 'Baby' next to the stone path that connects the cabin to a dock on the lake. Vanessa steps out and takes a deep breath in. The smell of trees that surrounds the lake, creatures in those woods, and water fill her nose.
Vanessa shrugs, "I don't know, maybe it was because I wanted to hear the disappointment in your voice, "
"I'm not sure that's a good idea, and how would we even get down there?" Sam asks, he runs his hand through his long hair.
"I wouldn't call that dumb, I'd call it heroic," Dean crosses his arms.
"I was going to make you try one way or another," Vanessa says with a smile before turning the music back up.
"Dating? Oh we're not, we have only been kissing, except for that one time," Dean smiles as he completely skips over the last time they were together and remembers kissing her on her doorstep before leaving.
Lir says happily.
"Yes. It's a fruit and a romantic outing," Castiel says with a smile. "Sam explained what it is to me when you had to use the restroom, he asked how our date was going and I had asked what that was."
"Okay, I have an idea, I'll admit it's kinda weird, but I need you to trust me," she tells Sam as she scans the dead vamp's body.
"So I've got another little wittle question," Vanessa slurs as Sam rolls the dice and lands on a tax space, he throws the amount of money he owes into free parking.
"I can zing you zo zleep," she whispers in his ear, her heavy German accent makes him shiver.
Vanessa quickly strides to her messed up coffee table, remembering that she'll probably want a set of clean clothes and towels if they're going to be fishing and swimming there. Once she magics up a bag for herself, Vanessa goes through it to make sure it has everything she needs.
"Shush it," Vanessa hisses at him.
"God fucking dammit," Dean growls, watching Castiel happily go straight to jail past all of his property. "Now he can't pay me shit." His angry green eyes glaring at the angel's piece in jail.
When they had reached the bunker, they were all tired. Sam had gotten Tim settled down in one of the many spare rooms available as Dean scrounge up the energy to go and quickly grab a pizza.
"It's at the cabin," Dean replies and puts the keys into the ignition and smiles when he hears the low rumble of the engine.
She smiles even wider as she keeps a fast but sloppy pace, drool slipping out of her mouth and down her chin. Vanessa looks up at Dean, her face is completely red with blush from what they're doing and concentration. Her gorgeous brown eyes are replaced with her neon yellow eyes that seem to be glowing, he swallows as they lock eyes with each other.
"Ugh, " Dean groans, he forgot how much he dislikes flying. It feels like he's been on a roller coaster. He shakes it off and grabs Castiel's hand, pausing for a moment to see if Castiel will let go (which he doesn't) before they start to head for the gift shop.
"And you must be Vanessa's father," Dean says politely.
"Well, I don't think I should be the one to talk about that, but I came here when you opened that door and scream," Castiel hums, "it was horrific to see what happened and that dream didn't seem much like one, it felt like it was a memory."
like Led Zeppelin? It's a good fucking band!" She turns back to what's she's doing, she pulls out a wooden spoon from a drawer and grabs a huge bottle of something from underneath the sink.
"Yup, we tracked them down to this house, we just needed the extra back up," Sam explains as they get out of the car.
"No, we're at a diner," Dean says as he pulls into a parking spot. Dean pulls the keys out of the ignition and steps out of the car. A late spring breeze blows as Dean closes the car door and walks over to help Tim.
The large man grunts and touches his now bleeding lip and walks away muttering. The three of then slide into their seats as Sam lets out a low whistle as Vanessa looks down at her still warm food. "Thanks, Dean" she looks up at him and smiles. Dean would've smiled right back at her and would've slightly blushed, but both Dean and Sam flinch back as they stare into her now yellow eyes.
"W-what? We aren't," Dean's face turns beet red as Castiel places his hand on Dean's shoulder.
After ten minutes Dean flips over onto his back and looks up at the ceiling, he knew he should've taken Castiel's offer of forcing him to sleep. At least then he could be awake with everyone else instead of being alone and waiting. Dean closes his eyes again, this time he pretends he's sleeping and waits for someone to wake up.
"Sam I suggest you just sleep on the couch, no way any of us can carry you up the stairs, but Cas you could go sleep in one of the guest bed..." Vanessa trails off as she remembers that she blasted him through the door. "I'm so sorry for shooting you through the door"
"I-it was–is a memory," Vanessa whispers, the stinging sensation tells her that she is going to start to cry if she talks about it any longer. "I don't, umm, really want to talk about, but what, uh, time is it?"
Dean's eyes snap open, he looks at his surroundings to find pitch-black everything. He shuffles onto his left side to find a pair of uncanny yellow gleaming eyes staring at him. His first reaction is to jump back and his next is to swing his tired arm at the glowing eyes.
"Just trust me," Dean shoots Tim a smile and pours a dollop of the ketchup on his plate, Tim stares at it with suspicion. Tim reluctantly dips a french fry into the ketchup and pops it in his mouth, he closes his eyes and hums. "That does taste better," Tim says excitedly.
"As a siren, I can mimic anyone's voice. And as a witch with waaay too much magic, I can make myself look like anyone" Vanessa explains with a grin.
On the coffee table is a bag that smells like heaven, she grabs it and pulls out its contents. A large foiled wrapped sandwich and a medium container of fries. "Thanks, Sam," Vanessa says, wasting no time tearing off the wrapper. Both Sam and Cas watch in awe as Vanessa devours her sandwich and fries.
They exit the car and Sam hands Vanessa, a large machete, they creep up towards the front door, and silently walk into the house. Yelling echoes the house as they wander towards the noise. "I told you to lock him up and feed him! Now Sally's dead and he's starving himself in the basement" an unfamiliar male voice bellows. Cas walks off in a different direction to find the basement where they're supposedly keeping Dean. Sam and Vanessa turn the corner to find a door where all the yelling is coming from.
"No need," Vanessa snaps her fingers and two grocery bags full of apples appear on the island.
She gasps and starts squirming underneath him. Dean smiles and continues, only to find that her neck somehow opens? He pauses to look at her neck to find that three long and narrow slits have opened, and Vanessa notices his pause. "They're my gills, " she whispers, "they're sensitive, but you already-" she cuts herself off with a moan when Dean traces one of them with his tongue.
"What are you making? Besides breakfast?"
"Really? That's lame."
Vanessa sighs and looks back at the book in her lap, she probably should read this but she is not a very good or fast reader, but she'll try tonight.
He watches the monsters walk Sam into the room, they kick his knee at a painful angle and leave him on the ground, and Dean watches them tear into the girls, their screams bouncing off the walls.
"We have weapons in the car," Sam says, not wanting to move in case he angers the still purring Pluto.
See y'all next time <3
Vanessa sighs, "they are my two dragons," she says proudly.
Maybe he should grab Castiel's hand and give the people around them something to stare at. It's just there, so close to Dean's hand already, practically touching, if he grabs it what would be the worst outcome? Castiel immediately tells him to let go and asks what he's doing and why he tried to hold hands? He could be oblivious and just not notice? Or Castiel could love holding hands and say that he is having a wonderful time and loves him?
Just as soon as Dean opens his mouth to ask another question, Vanessa feels a sudden tug on her line. "Oh shit!" she exclaims as she grips her rod tightly and starts reeling it in. Vanessa finds a pattern that seems to be working,
As soon as he says that, the sound of large wings flapping and a gust of wind makes Dean mutter "about damn time."
Sorry, this took me soooo long to write and then edit, but with everything that has happened between now and the last chapter in the US...I hope y'all understand.
"Whoopsie daisy," he mutters and rubs the back of his neck. "Could you conjure up some for us?"
Dean sings Paradise City by Guns 'n Roses as he speeds down an almost empty highway. Sam, his brother, smiles at him and taps his foot to the song.
"Well, I think you did a great job, Cas," Dean pats the beaming angel on the shoulder again.
"Good morning!" Vanessa says from the stove, her now pink hair is up in a tight bun, and she's wearing new pajamas, a plain white shirt, and soft looking pants that have pineapples on them.
Sam...that son of a bitch. It's his fault, if he hadn't told Castiel what a fucking date is and who knows what else, Castiel claiming that they are on a date never could have happened!
"I have one, it's in the room Sam will be staying in" Vanessa replies, scratching her burning legs, "I mostly read, I have a lot of books, most of them are lore."
"Really?"
"How does he look?" Vanessa asks worriedly.
"See something you like?" Dean slides up behind Castiel, making him jump.
Unfortunately for him, his fist doesn't connect with anything but air, but the next swing comes to an abrupt stop before he can even fully stretch out his arm.
"It's the 'protect me cone' shirt from Red vs Blue, it looks awesome!" Vanessa flips it around to get another look at it. Vanessa looks at Malachite, who has been waiting at the end of the couch for any food that may have appeared and carefully places it on the coffee table.
"Sounds good to me," Dean mutters as he looks through his options of token to play as.
"Whoa, Cas, was there a guard down there?" Vanessa walks over to him and brushes her fingers over the bruise. He grabs her hands and lightly rubs it.
"You can't?" Both Vanessa and Dean say in shock.
"Good, I don't have any, I don't like that shit, " Vanessa says.
Dean dodges a punch to the head and lands a nice blow straight in the gut. The witch lets out a whimper and continues to try and punch Dean, but he keeps dodging and landing better hits. He kicks her knees and shoots her point-blank in the head, blood splattering all over his jeans.
Dean leads Tim to a booth right by the entrance with Sam right behind them. Dean slips in the side of the booth that faces the door as Sam sits next to him and Tim across.
The first exhibit they see are the noisy flamingos.
Sam sighs and they head into the forest, Dean makes a mental note of where the camp is so they don't forget.
"I like you both Cas, so who said I have to choose," Vanessa grins. "So if you'd like, I will start showing my love for you."
"Vanessa, don't you dare touch that bag until I say so." He says, closing the fridge door.
"Not yet."
"Indeed," Castiel says as they watch the not moving snake.
"Please don't choke," Sam says as he takes a sip of his untouched beer.
Sam smirks at him. "You wouldn't, you'd have to be sober almost 24/7 and you can't swear in front of five-year-olds."
Dean slips on his shoes (not before checking for any critters) and heads for his car, his baby to be exact. Maybe if he can't sleep in the tent with his loud brother, perhaps he can just sleep in his car and try to ignore the thunder.
Dean doesn't move cause he knows they'll come over here eventually. Sam's heavy breathing gets louder and louder as they get closer.
"No, you are. If you did anything different she still would have bolted, it is not your fault."
"Sally?"
Dean's green eyes bore into her own, knowing she's trying to change the subject he just goes along with it. "Yes, Daniel was nice," Dean sighs, he wiggles her arm under Vanessa and pulls her close to him. "When I was making your birthday pie, he told me about siren courting things."
"I-it was" the other vampire that has short curly blond hair and bitter brown eyes, hiccups, "Dav-vid, he tur-rned us all" he chokes as tears roll down his cheeks.
"My family hunt very, very, very bad witches that cause my boss and others a lot of trouble. I get the occasional call from my boss, he tells me the information that I need, and I go and bring them back, dead or alive." Vanessa shrugs, "that's why the witch back there was so afraid of me" she sits down next to Bobby and leans on the armrest.
The house is only one story, making it look pretty small, but Vanessa can feel every spell put into it, and they all taste like rosemary.
"I was until you got up," Vanessa mutters, pulling herself up to face Dean. Her lips inches away from his.
Bobby replies, making Tim let out a little huff.
cake!" Vanessa explains easily as she attends to the neglected cake. "It's my family's recipe."
"Same," Dean replies. He takes the first swig of his drink and sighs, feeling the cold liquid go down his throat. This will either be a good night or a bad night depending on this game, and Dean loves it.
Dean groans, wiping his sweaty face, he throws the blankets off of him, feeling like he's been on a roller coaster, he crawls to his feet, letting a quiet groan slip out. "I'm fine Cas, you just scared me."
"Cheeseburgers?" Tim tilts his head. Dean looks in the rearview mirror and meets Tim's eyes.
After a few long minutes of Castiel chanting sweet nothings into her ear, she slowly falls back asleep in Castiel's strong arms. She dreams of nothing as she hears him hum some song.
She looks around the room, it's a four-star hotel so it's nice and pretty. The walls are painted a nice sunset orange and the sheets are an elegant light blue, there is a large tv in front of the bed and a large black couch in between. Next to the bed is a large window that overlooks the lake
"Why are you telling me this?" Dean asks, crossing his arms over his chest, knowing what he's about to say.
"Yeah, you wanna try one?" She asks before popping one into her mouth, shell and all.
Vanessa rolls her gorgeous brown eyes and heads for her kitchen. "Y'all are going to be fine, they are pygmy dragons and they don't bite and I had their fire makers removed so you guys will be just fine," she yells from her kitchen. The sound of a door unlocking makes Dean's heart rate go up. Both boys look at Bobby for some kind of reassurance but he just smiles back at them.
"I'm not sure how long we'll be staying Nessa, " Dean says, trying out a new nickname, he wraps his arm under hers and on her warm side, "you should come with us on our next hunt."
After a few seconds, Dean can hear the rumble of Vanessa's car, and when he hears the car door close his stomach grumbles. He forgot how hungry he is.
"Alright then, " Vanessa says, grabbing two more slices of bread. Dean lovingly watches her as she makes three large sandwiches in silence.
"Dean didn't have any backup clothes, so he is borrowing them, I knew I should've asked," Cas says.
Vanessa shifts in her seat and gets comfortable, ready for the long ride ahead of them.
A small smile spreads across his face as the sound of footsteps comes from the stairs. "Good morning" Vanessa groggily calls from the stairs, she shuffles towards the living room yawning and scratching her arms.
"Pie or not, thank you, Cas," Dean shoots Castiel a grin, making him blush.  They eat their cake while Castiel tells Dean about him practicing making pies all week and where all the "store-bought" pies came from.
Vanessa freezes for half a second then smoothly says, "oh...um, me? I don't know a few years younger than you? I lost track after some time, sirens don't really celebrate birthdays but my dad does, I normally just buy myself a cupcake and call it a day,"
"This bacon tastes weird," he says as he shoves more in.
"I told you something fell," Dean takes off in a sprint.
"I'm going to go back inside, " Sam pats Dean's shoulder, he walks past the firepit and inside.
Vanessa's eyes snap open, she brings her shaky hands to rub her eyes, to find that they are wet. She rubs her wet cheek and looks around in the darkness. Her chest is heaving up and down and her throat feels sore.
"It's not just some zoo, it's the Columbus zoo! Come on, don't make me go by myself," Dean begs. He tries to give him his best puppy eyes but it doesn't work, instead, Sam just looks back at his laptop.
"Ugh," Dean tries to sit up, but he manages to prop himself onto his elbows. He rubs his tired face with one hand, fragments of his dream come back to him as well as the now very low humming in his head. "Vanessa?" He croaks.
Dean makes sure they didn't leave anything behind before heading outside, a mid-spring breeze blows past Dean as he walks through the front door. He makes sure to stretch out his back and legs, they still have quite a ways to go before they make it to the bunker, maybe Dean can take a nap before they look into Tim's case.
the witch, no need for blood," Vanessa says, taking a bite out of her sausage link. "Then, I don't know, we could have some fun, celebrate, and whatnot."
"It was bubbling over cause you turned the heat way too up," Sam snorts.
Dean tilts his head and stays quiet for a moment. "I dunno, blue?" He shrugs, they stay quiet for a moment, enjoy the sounds of small waves crashing onto the lake's beach until Dean comes up with another question.
A waiter quickly comes to them ready to take their orders. Dean didn't even realize that they're the only ones here except for a couple at one of the booths near the back. "What can I get for you boys?" He asks, brushing his curly sandy hair out of his face and hands them all a menu.
"Cas, if you try to rush me, I'll only go even slower," Vanessa smirks when she sees the outline of Castiel's erection. She leans over his legs and slowly undoes his belt, throwing it off the side of the bed, she unzips his fly and pulls off his pants.
I do have a Tumblr, just go to blueberryrock and send me a message or something, i try to post art and stuff.
"But, w-what are you doing?" Castiel flusteredly asks moving back into the pillows.
"Can we do this later," Vanessa sighs, rubbing her face Vanessa shifts onto her back. "Like in the morning?"
Dean freezes as he realizes that she the most beautiful woman he has ever laid eyes on. "I-umm" is all he can muster.
"I was telling them about the full moon and my plans for it. Just like a werewolf, every full moon I change into my siren form, you know a tail, fins, gills, etc..." Vanessa explains again.
He grabs one of the magnets, a manatee with the name of the zoo carved into it, which looks nice but there are so many more. Dean grabs another magnet that is in the shape of a jellyfish in a purple ombre that turns into a light blue at the tentacles, with fake gems at the top.
The smell of nature, water, and animals fills Dean's nose as they reach the ticket booth. "Two adult tickets, please," Dean says as he starts to pull out his wallet.
Dean continues to rub her down as she finally wiggles free. "See, wasn't so bad," Dean sighs and helps Vanessa to her feet.
Vanessa quickly gets the stench and blood of vampires off of her and quickly rinses off the soap. She doesn't even bother washing her hair and turns off the shower. She squeezes out all of the water in her hair and grabs her towel. She wraps it around herself and sits on the toilet next to the bathtub/shower.
"What do you do for dessert?" Sam asks.
"How did you do that?" Sam asks with a lopsided smile.
"Scenting me? What the hell does that mean?" Dean asks curiously.
As they drive to the bar, Vaness tells them the basics about herself, like how her favorite color is the same color of Dean's eyes, she has many houses that work as safe houses for hunters and that they can use them as they please, she is half-witch and half..." where here!"
"Well, umm, let's get you out of here," Dean motions to where Sam is standing, all the way at the top. The man follows his gaze and nods.
"G-got it."
"So what is a zoo?" Castiel asks, his gaze falling out onto the road.
"Sure can do. What kind?"
"Or I could fly us," Castiel offers.
"Not really, don't know why," Sam grumbles. Vanessa grabs another mug and fills it up with tea, she moves around the scrambled eggs before handing it to Sam.
"Only about a thousand, but I'll hear it again, I'll even tell y'all about how I took down a pack of werewolf witches" Vanessa replies sweetly.
"Thanks, but you sure, you're really, red.." She says, grinning mischievously as he blushes even harder. She turns back around and put her hairbrush on her brown and white island that's in front of her oven. She picks up a hair tie and starts braiding her hair.
"What should we have for breakfast tomorrow?" Dean asks, his gaze still on Vanessa and Castiel.
"What was it?" Dean whispers as some kid runs past them, nearly bumping into them before they move on.
"Dean, " she moans, "I thought this was suuppooosed to be fo-or you."
"Planning time," she says, rubbing her simmering hands together. "Since Dean is captured by vampires they probably turned him or they're using him as leverage, or both," Vanessa says as she sits down on the coffee table, crossing her legs so one leg is under the other.
He looks at the bed, Vanessa has covered her entire body except for her face, her whole body tenses up and she squeezes her eyes close and lets out a small whimper. Dean watches her snake her arm out of the blanket cocoon and feels around the nightstand, once she finds what she is looking for Vanessa quickly reels in her arm and sighs, her whole body relaxes.
"But thanks Cas," Vanessa walks around the island to hug him. He freezes just for a second before melting into the hug and wrapping his wings around her.
"Yeah, you don't have to actually help us with killing anyone, but you could accompany us, " Dean explains poorly.
"Alright then, let's go kick some witch ass!" Vanessa exclaims quietly. She waits on the hood of the impala as the brothers head to the trunk for weapons. Dean hands Vanessa a small pistol full of witch killing bullets, but she declines. As they creep toward the house, Vanessa jerks her arms up and down, probably getting ready.
"Considering I had to drink two more bottles of wine, it's a damn good painting. Now, let me check your wounds and we'll plan a rescue mission for Dean," Vanessa says as she cracks her knuckles. Sam stands up and they all walk to the living room, Cas and Sam sit on the couch and start unbuttoning their shirts.
"Me?" Sarah says, brushing some of the paint off with her hands.
"I don't mind helping," Dean falls to his knees and starts rubbing a towel on her tail.
Once her tail is done, Vanessa pushes off the bottom in one fluid motion to meet Dean at the surface. "Does that hurt?" Dean glances at Vanessa.
Settling down at one of the tables, Dean cracks open the first book. It was something about greater demons and the ways they can appear.
"Cas, " Vanessa bellows, "I have something to show you."
"There we are, house four o' six in this cute little suburb," Vanessa says picking up the small smoking piece of the map. Vanessa looks up and the angel and says "Let's do this!"
"Oh yeah, Vanessa says that when she ever has children they'll get past down to them" Bobby replies.
She has always hated the confrontation part of the job, sometimes her targets recognized her even with the different colored hair and eyes, which makes things more difficult.
"Okay," Vanessa replies, as she stands back up and turns to leave, but Sam grabs her hand and asks "are you okay?"
"It really isn't that bad, but it's hard to learn and understand it, it's basically just a bunch of screeching, wailing, clicks, and for some words it whale calls, " Vanessa explains as she continues to scratch her legs.
As Vanessa slowly reads on, her eyelids become heavier and heavier until she nearly falls asleep. She sighs and closes the book, making a mental note of where she left off and places it back on her nightstand.
She had to change her appearance so she would not be recognized, Castiel thought that she should have dark hair and blue eyes and she agreed.
"Alrighty then"
"I want to do something," Castiel says, he leans in close to Dean's face.
The gift is wrapped in gold wrapping paper with a neat purple bow on it, and it's the size and shape of a pineapple with no leaves. "Can I shake it?" She looks at her dad.
"Really? I could never do that, what I did for you I only do that for people I like."
Dean quickly looks away and starts backing up to drive on the bumpy forest road.
"I knew you need a new blue flannel after that werewolf tore through it," Sam shrugs. "And I saw that AC/DC shirt and it's so soft, I knew you'd love it."
"You didn't? Not even what happened the other day?" Vanessa pushes away from him.
Deans adds as much bacon as he can to the pan before turning his attention to the pancakes. Soon the kitchen is filled with the scent of bacon and the sound of it sizzling.
Dean tilts his head as the scent becomes stronger and heat dances across his face. "Happy Birthday Dean!" Sam and Castiel cheer.
"Correct, there is no need for bloodshed, only if Sarah is not compliant will you put her to sleep," Vanessa explains, putting the bowl away. She straightens the map out on the hotel coffee table then, with a snap of her fingers, the map catches on fire, eating away at the map until it hits the witch's location.
"Hey! Dean has manners and so did Jane! Not table manners...but it counts," Vanessa retorts.
"Cause I didn't wanna assume so I just threw my bag in a room and if you don't want to share your room-er-bed together that's fine." Dean slowly starts to turn to the door to leave.
I had fun writing this one, next one will probably be up in two weeks like last time, but uh yeah, I hope y'all enjoyed it, and feel free to leave any comments and kudos! I will try to reply as quickly as I can!
"I-I have to a-avenge th-hem, all of th-hem" she wails, she runs at them with a lamp in her hand, but before she could do anything to them Cas appears in front of her. She yelps and tries to hit him with the lamp but he grabs her hand, and with one clean slice of Cas' angel blade, her head falls clean off and onto the ground.
"No, well, yes. With a sink," Sam sighs. "That guy is stronger than he looks, or their sinks are pretty shitty, the uhh, handle popped right off and it started spaying us with water."
"An angel I know made these," Castiel mumbles as he slides next to him.
Dean's jaw drops when he sees her tail. In the moonlight, her scales are a gorgeous shade of extremely dark blue, almost black, it sparkles purple and brown. On her arms are small fins that are the same color, her eyes are eerily glowing yellow in the moonlight, and her chest is covered in scales.
"Neat, what other snakes did you make?" Dean asks as he pulls the angel along to a tank with an alligator snapping turtle.
Dean's eyes snap open at the sound of someone's door opening and then quietly closing. Dean quickly gets off the bed and stretches before exiting the room as quietly as they were. The bright morning light from the window above the stairs floods the hallway. Blinded from the bright sunlight Dean staggers down the stairs, only taking a few steps per minute, he rubs his temple, feeling a headache coming in.
"Me too, like, cats are carnivores, but some people are just dumb," Vanessa growls as her toast pops up.
"I think five altogether. Pass me that beer," Vanessa motions to the beer next to Dean, he grabs the bottle and opens it for her before handing it over.
"Your job?"
"Don't apologize, I wanted it to be a date too, but I was too much of a chicken to actually call it one and properly ask you out."
Vanessa throws the ripped wrapping paper from the first gift onto the coffee table before tearing into the second present. She once again holds it up to her chest to look at it.
"Wait. Did you make these?" Dean points to the lounging cheetah in front of them.
"You can see his wings?" Sam adds.
"God fucking dammit, hold on," she turns the radio down and picks up the phone to look at who's calling, she sighs and answers it, "Hello, Vanessa speaking, how can I be of service Mr. Tervino?"
"I would never ignore you," Castiel says after loud wing beats. He doesn't even make Dean jump in surprise.
"Do what?" Vanessa asks, grabbing the bottle and dumping about the same amount that Sam has.
"No, " Cas says, rolling his shoulders. Vanessa glares at him with skepticism.
"I'll go and grab a towel," he says before turning towards the door. Vanessa sighs and flips herself onto her back, the worst part of being a siren is drying off. Normally Vanessa sleeps in so the sun is all nice and high in the sky, but she has guests this time so she tries to wake up as early as she can to make them breakfast.
"Well, that's the power of magic" Vanessa smiles as she takes the old bandage off "it's healed to the point where you don't need a new bandage or more of the herbs which is good cause I need to grow more" Vanessa states as she shuffles on her knees to Cas. She swallows thickly as she tries to ignore the position she's in.
"If that is a Giant Panda, they would eat bamboo," Tim says after laughing, making Dean nearly spill his beer down his shirt as he tries to take a sip.
