Late in the afternoon of the twenty-fourth of December, I struggled up the stairs to our sitting room, weighted down with brown-paper parcels and nearly strangled by a garland of greenery that I had rather impulsively purchased without thinking about how I would carry it home. I knocked the snow and slush from my boots, staggered into the sitting room, and dropped the parcels anyhow onto the settee. I next set about freeing myself from the twelve feet of pine needles that were coiled uncomfortably about my neck and shoulders. Having disentangled myself, I took up the slippery, whispering thing in both hands, intending to arrange it over the mantel. My eye caught the china tray onto which Holmes has the bad habit of carelessly piling our incoming correspondence. Peeping from amongst the half-penny holiday cards was a sealed, oblong envelope. I could not see the address, but the paper was the shade of pressed lilac.
The most freighted moment in that conversation comes when Holmes tells Watson that the bed in Julia’s room was bolted to the floor. Because it’s at that moment that the subtextual aspect of Roylott’s M. O. becomes clearest. Literally, this is about giving the snake a direct path to the victim. But that particular clue reveals how Roylott’s murder plot is a metaphor for sexual abuse. The snake comes with built-in phallic connotations anyway; and here’s Roylott deliberately setting up Julia’s room–right next to his own–in such a way that his ‘snake’ can get into bed with her in the middle of the night without anyone else knowing. Clamping the bed to the floor wouldn’t really be that important literally–the whole plan depends on Julia not noticing the snake until she’s been actually bitten, so why should she want to move her bed in the first place?–but it’s very important as a symbol of how Roylott is deliberately and cold-bloodedly destroying Julia’s ability to defend herself against him. All of this is of a piece with the rest of Roylott’s observable behavior. He isolates his daughters from their friends and family; he alienates the servants so there will be no witnesses to what goes on in that house; he surrounds the house itself with sentries (human and animal) that are loyal to him; he actively seeks to prevent them from marrying; he stalks and spies on them; and he has left visible bruises on Helen’s wrist. He could not be any more clearly marked as an abuser. When you throw in the fact that Helen and Julia routinely lock themselves in when they go to bed at night–supposedly because of the wild animals on the loose–I think we are safe in reading Julia’s murder as an allegory for sexual abuse.
Why is it that this children’s party of the damned seems to me like it could also be Halloween night at the Holmes children’s house? Eurus in the middle, Sherlock next to her, Mycroft in the foreground giving us that “how long must I endure this hilarity” glare, and poor old Victor Trevor in the background checking out his pirate sword.
as much independence or agency as Doyle gave Violet Hunter. “The Copper Beeches” is really Violet’s story. Violet isn’t just the client; she’s the detective. She’s really using Holmes the way Sherlock uses Lestrade: as back-up in case things go sideways. And as much as Holmes bitches about this case at the beginning of the episode, by the end of it, he’s pretty much embraced that role and is all right with it.
, IMDB informs me.) It is not helped at all by the guy playing Abe Slaney, who’s just terrible. But he’s only in one scene.
And then, after he says “Come back to this lady in one year’s time,” something very interesting happens. Mary rushes up to Holmes and gives him a hug…and he could NOT be more physically uncomfortable with that. I mean I found a gif of it:
At any rate, when you stop to think about it, conversing in this way with material objects is about 80% of what Sherlock Holmes does for a living; and Brett really
work on a British jury. Watson’s change of heart is what gives Holmes enough confidence to hold the confession back until after the outcome of the trial. And Watson probably doesn’t realize any of this. Even after all this time, there are still some surprises left for Watson to discover.
So, in the end, this was less distressing than “Eligible Bachelor” and “Last Vampyre,” if only because there is so much less of it. It’s a real relief to return to the one-hour format with the familiar opening credits. They do a good job of staging the lifestyles of the rich and famous–the fancy dress party works much better than some of the other period set pieces they’ve done–and there are some quite endearing moments, such as when Holmes throws a piece of fruit out of the broken 221b window, and the little gem of a mini-scene where Mrs. Hudson gives Holmes the bad news about Watson:
Even more troublingly, Holmes knows he’s dragging Watson into this ethical morass well, which is part of what’s implied by the “us.” Ever since Holmes let Ryder go in “Blue Carbuncle,” Watson has been bothered by Holmes’s apparent belief that he’s above the law. He can always sympathize with Holmes’s motives; but there’s always resistance. But over the course of the series, we find that resistance weakening until it becomes pretty much pro forma. And in this one, Watson puts up no resistance when asked to transcribe the confession. But right to the end of the episode, he’s pushing for Holmes to use it, and Holmes knows he has no intention of doing so. The “God help us” is partly Holmes’s realization of how much he’s influenced Watson’s own ethics and his own moral choices, and what a responsibility
While all this is going on, there are these scenes in which Mrs. Whitney and Mrs. St. Clair venture into the Bad Parts of Town and are menaced by poor people. There’s a lot of subjective camera, especially in the scene where Mrs. St. Clair wanders into Swandam Lane, where these poor people are shot from the bourgeois-eye-view:
The Granada episode does some wonderful things with this domestic opening scene. For one thing, it begins with Holmes singing in Latin. This was inspired by Watson’s observation, in the canon story, that Holmes has been entertaining himself during their seclusion by studying medieval music. Brett’s voice is not technically perfect at this point in his life, but I found it very moving to hear him sing. (I’ve seen
But that was 30 years ago, and although the name “Natasha Richardson” has been rattling around in my brain all this time, never until this exact second did I come to realize that the Natasha Richardson who played Violet Hunter in “The Copper Beeches” grew up to become the Natasha Richardson who would tragically die in 2009 after sustaining a head injury while skiing, leaving Liam Neeson and their children suddenly bereft.
It’s amazing, when you think about it, what has happened to the concept of the “London fog.” Since they are a thing of the past (for now), and thanks to film, TV, and songs like “A Foggy Day in London Town,” people now associate the phrase “London fog” with romance, nostalgia, beauty, and sophistication. London Fog is the name of a clothing company. You can get a London Fog Latte at Starbuck’s. (It has Earl Grey in it.) Someone write a fic where Holmes and Watson are suddenly catapulted to modern times and Watson is horrified to discover that people are DRINKING this stuff. ON PURPOSE. And PAYING for it. I mean, to him, it would be like ordering a Nuclear Waste Slurry. Extra points if it’s a coffeeshop AU.
Anyway, Cranky Old Plaidder is capable of critical distance at this point, and so in re-watching “The Final Problem” I had a weird kind of double consciousness about it. Young Plaidder is still in there somewhere, basically just crying. Cranky Old Plaidder can’t help thinking about “The Final Problem” as a perennial problem for adapters. There are so many problems with the original story to start with; and then when you bring it to screen, you have to deal with the problem of outsize emotions felt by two characters who are, despite their obviously strong feelings for each other, still bound in their interactions by a strange formality. Right to the bitter end of the saga, for instance, neither ever uses the other’s first name in front of the reader. This gave rise, back in the day, to a hotly contested debate about whether, in H/W slash, they should address each other by first names or stick to Holmes and Watson. I don’t know whether people are still fighting this battle now. But I digress. My point is: with something like
performance. Hawkesworth did the screenplay for this one, and he stayed, as far as Holmes’s dialogue goes, very close to canon–which means that Brett is often faced, in this one, with paragraph-sized monologues. Not to worry; Brett has been dealing with giant chunks of dialogue since
The dematerialization of the text in the digital age is something we will all eventually take for granted; but it is a big deal, and I believe that some part of us mourns the loss of the tactile. To think, as late as the early 1990s, I was regularly writing letters, of some length, to friends in faraway places. Somewhere under my bed right now are boxes of letters written to me by my family, by my friends, and by Mrs. Plaidder, during times when we were physically separated. A handwritten letter conveys the writer to you in ways that electronic communication does not. So when I see some fool having a roll in the hay with a letter,
So are Holmes’s frequent and increasingly bitter denunciations of Sophia’s own complicity in the murder of her brother. And this, let me just say, is ENTIRELY coming from Marlowe. In the story as written, everyone escapes; but a year or so later, they discover that Latimer and Kemp were found dead in Hungary, and Watson and Holmes assume that Sophia must have stabbed them. So in the story, Sophia may be in love with Latimer, but she DEFINITELY cares that Latimer and Kemp killed her brother, and she bides her time before exacting revenge.
…and the way he drops a ‘hint’ to Watson from across the table by baaaaaaing. (Watson gives him this look for a minute like, “Dude, I thought you were OFF the drugs,” before he gets it. We also learn that Holmes was tasting the evidence before Mulder made it cool:
Jeremy Paul’s adaptation of “Naval Treaty” doesn’t do a great job of making sense of Holmes’s behavior; if anything, it gets weirder. After the first trip to Woking, as he’s headed off to bed, Watson says, “Are you all right?” A lot of things about Holmes seem to be off in this one, and it’s hard to know whether that was the result of intention or of the lack of it. But the theory does occur to me–and it’s probably occurred to others before me–that maybe, in fact, the point here is that Holmes is not, in fact, all right. And that this may have to do with the fact that this is, AFAIK, the only case in the canon that involves someone from Watson’s past.
belief in Holmes’s impending, and then apparently actual, death. This approach certainly plays to Brett’s strengths; that scene in 221B after he climbs in through the window just breaks your heart for both him and Watson. His confrontation with Moriarty also showcases Brett’s signature blend of sensitivity and steel; Holmes can get through his performance of stoicism as long as he’s facing his adversary, but when Moriarty turns to go, we see him falter just for a minute, wrapping his gown around him nervously before delivering his parting shot. The production augments this by tingeing everything in the London phase of the episode with gloom, from the dirge-like arrangement of the opening theme to the visiting-card opening credits to the dim light and mist through which Holmes navigates as he dodges Moriarty’s hit men.
That gun totally does not hit the parapet in such a way as to make the mark that they then pretend to discover in the next shot. But don’t blame the props department; it couldn’t. Physics just doesn’t work that way. Plus, since in the adaptation they have Watson actually
Bad news first: as far as the women go, there’s nothing of interest here. From that point of view, this story is just a collection of well-worn tropes, including the “it’s OK that women don’t have political power of their own because they can shape the world by influencing powerful men” trope. You watch Grace Dunbar pleading with Gibson to use his wealth and power for good, and all you can think is, “Sweetheart, that doesn’t work for Ivanka and it ain’t gonna work for you.”
Just as Spock is only ever put in charge of the Enterprise when it’s about to explode, it is only at this advanced stage of crisis that Granada hired a woman to direct. Sarah Hellings, who directed this episode, is probably best known to readers of this blog as the woman who directed the classic Doctor Who two-parter “The Mark of the Rani.” She does a good job; I am particularly appreciative of the way she shoots the opera house environment. But as with all the earlier “Memoirs” episodes, she is fighting an increasingly uphill battle, which in this case is not made any easier by Jeremy Paul’s unnecessarily complicated and heavy-handed script. “The law is what we live with,” Holmes sighs, in the penultimate scene, hoping that one day it will be replaced with justice. Paul gives Holmes and the Lucases their happy ending. We the viewers will not get ours.
Beyond the cut tag I will take up this question, and also address the episode as a whole. The short story is: I miss ‘my’ Watson. Almost as much as this poor bastard in the above photo does at this moment. But I’m willing to give the new guy a chance.
in which Leporello whips out his black book and goes through his list of all the different women his boss has raped, seduced, and otherwise consumed in his lifetime. Significantly, in that song, Leporello talks about the fact that some of these conquests are about pleasure, but some of them are
I’m not going to linger over these last ones. But behind the cut tag, a couple things about Brett’s performance in this one that kind of break your heart.
One is forced to console oneself by reflecting that absence is the highest form of presence. There’s a nice moment when the Professor is ranting about the stupidity of country girls and you see Holmes giving him the “all right, fuck THIS guy” look with which he has favored so many in the past (Carruthers and Roylott being two of the most memorable). All the way back in “Dancing Men,” we see Watson coaching Holmes about consideration for the servants, as he leans over to whisper into his ear that Mrs. King might want to sit down for her interview–knowing that she won’t think she’s allowed unless Holmes gives her permission. In this episode, as in many of the others since “Dancing Men,” Holmes starts his interviews with the servants by asking if they want to sit down. When Susan Tarlton does, and he notices that she’s staring at the bloodstain on the carpet, he covers it with his scarf before continuing the interview. Mycroft doesn’t think of these things; that’s Watson’s influence. Watson’s influence also explains the fact that Anna’s suicide is a mystery to Mycroft but transparent to Holmes. Hope, despair, and the death of love–all things he’s contemplating as he sits alone in 221b, talking to himself, while Watson’s out working at his surgery…still.
The stories make a big deal about Holmes’s sensitive hands, and Brett obviously took that as a character note. He really had the gift of bringing the props alive, and watching this now, I felt a kind of painful nostalgia for the tactile world that the information revolution swept aside–the notes, the envelopes, the scraps of paper, the blackboards and the chalks, the pins, the leatherbound books with their dog-eared pages. Maybe I miss it more because of all the time I’ve spent in the nearly-paperless
As the text dematerializes, it becomes less redolent of the person who created it. Now, having been an early adopter of email I can tell you that long before the Emoji Movie, people were doing their best to encode some of those clues into the new technology. (In MY DAY, we had to TYPE our emojis using ORDINARY KEYBOARD CHARACTERS!) And I’m not saying electronic communication can’t be intense. I know people who fell in love via email, sight unseen, for real. I’m just saying that it’s not as tactile–or olfactory, or, for a guy who likes to taste his evidence, culinary.
One thing I have noticed, in my various rewatch projects, is that when a TV series is in decline, the episodes seem to start commenting on the show’s predicament. The clearest example I can think of at the moment is series 8 of
This of course is exactly the attitude we’re all fighting as we try to interest the next generation in a TV show filmed in the mid-1980s. I remember, back when cable was new and MTV became a thing, people talking about how music videos were accelerating the pacing of other kinds of visual entertainment. Twenty-first century viewers are used to a lot more visual stimulation–which basically means a lot more editing–per minute than we made do with back in the dark ages. The Granada episodes will naturally feel slow to children of the millennium, especially those accustomed to
. It will cure whatever ails you. And then, come back here and let me regale you with the story of how “The Second Stain” gives an older, smarter, less pretty yet more vigorous Jeremy Brett the chance to KILL IT in an episode whose resolution can be read, if you want to (spoiler alert: I want to) as a homage to
At the same time, the screenplay makes this “chaotic case” somewhat more chaotic. I can’t understand, for instance, why Paul didn’t make it clearer that the whole point of Scott Eccles was to provide Garcia with an alibi. It can be inferred, but I think it’d have been easier on the viewer if someone had discussed that explicitly, as Holmes does in the story. The final shootout on the train is also so artistically done that it took me two viewing to figure out what the hell was going on. Nevertheless, I have to applaud Paul for that divergence from the original story; it’s more satisfying, and it also humanizes the cook by providing him with a rational motivation for his return trip to the house–to get the other pistol and complete the mission.
Hawkesworth, I figure, was smart enough to know there was no way to actually show us any of that; to dramatize the story of how Holmes took down Moriarty’s gang you’d basically have to write your own feature-length film. What he does instead is give us a kind of micro-version of that story by creating the plot about the theft of the Mona Lisa. I have to say I’m not thrilled by this part of the episode. First of all, although stealing the Mona Lisa is certainly audacious, it suggests to me a certain lack of imagination–not so much on Moriarty’s part as on Hawkesworth’s. It was suggested, I suppose, by Holmes’s commentary on Moriarty’s suspiciously pricey private art collection in
What this adaptation gets, and what most others don’t, is that although Irene Adler is Holmes’s adversary in this story, she is not the criminal or the villain. That role is owned by Holmes’s client. The King of Bohemia had an affair with an unattached and unprotected American woman, dumped her, and is now so terrified of having to suffer the consequences of his own behavior that he is willing to do just about anything to get the incriminating photograph off Irene Adler. The Granada episode begins with two of the King’s hired goons ransacking Irene Adler’s house in the dead of night, ripping open her furniture and paintings with knives as they search for the photograph. This is only one of the many completely illegal things the King admits to doing to Irene Adler during his interview with Holmes (in ACD canon and in this adaptation). She eventually appears to chase the burglars off with a pistol. After they’ve fled, she looks up at the large oil painting of herself (it’s a terrible painting; I don’t know why the producers of period drama can’t bring themselves to pay for decent fake oil portraits, but they’re universally disappointing) and you can see how hurt and shocked she is by the symbolic violence. And that’s the canon Irene Adler: a strong woman in an extremely vulnerable position. She’s cunning, bold, clever, pistol-packing, trouser-wearing etc.,
I am aware, sadly, that later series of this show are going to force me to watch Brett in his tragic decline, and I’m honestly not looking forward to that. Fortunately, however, in 1986 he was at the height of his powers, and he turns in a
What I mainly remember from reading “Illustrious Client” for the first time, in my vanished youth, was an anxious concern over the state of Holmes and Watson’s relationship. “Illustrious Client” was published in 1924, and belongs to the period where, as Watson says, their “relations” had become “peculiar.” In ACD canon, once you get past
One of the reasons I don’t reread stories like “The Red Circle” is that in general, I really dislike Doyle’s Secret Society stories. They tend to be less about Holmes and Watson than they are about the secret society and its fearsomeness; they tend to be more about terror than they are about the science of deduction; and usually, Holmes is more or less helpless before the onslaught of the Secret Cabal. They are also often quite paranoid, especially about immigrants, and definitely anti-revolution. You see this even in the canon “Golden Pince-Nez,” where much of the interest of the original set-up seems to be the eruption of political violence within an English country house supposedly “cut off from outside influences.” The Scrowers, Italian anarchists, Russian nihilists, the KKK–no matter who they’re made up of or what their goals or methods are, they all get lumped in together as shadowy international conspiracies reaching their deadly tentacles out to ensnare helpless victims who have fled to England to escape them.
Well, in fact, nobody chose this. Everyone involved does their best. I particularly appreciate the Misses Garrideb, who are the best thing about this episode. Hopkins has taken a passing reference to the fact that Nathan Garrideb does have some female relatives and out of it created this delightful maiden-lady sister act. Detective stories have always had a special place in their hearts for old maiden ladies; they’re the original surveillance team. Hardwicke plays well against them, and overall his part of the mystery is quite charming. But nothing can compensate for the loss of Brett and Holmes, especially once Watson gets hurt. They do stage the Big Scene, and Hardwicke gives it his best, but…it’s sad. It’s just very sad, and there’s nothing there, and it makes you want to bite the universe for screwing everyone out of what could have been a dynamite show finale.
“The law is what we live with,” Holmes sighs, in the penultimate scene, hoping that one day it will be replaced with justice. Paul gives Holmes and the Lucases their happy ending. We the viewers will not get ours.
I’m going to talk about what this adaptation does with Kitty Winter, pictured above on the cab ride home from their dramatic visit to Violet de Merville’s house. But I will be talking about all that in the context of what really makes this episode stand out, which is what this adaptation does with the Great Partnership. This is a great episode for the Brett and Hardwicke team–even though, curse my besotted teenage heart of yore, I still can’t help wishing sometimes that I was watching Brett and Burke do this instead.
Instead, we have to content ourselves with the final conversation, after Watson has once again objected to Holmes’s decision to let a murderer go because he killed in revenge for the woman he loved. Well, that’s all traceable to Doyle’s biography and there’s nothing anyone can do about it. But they do something very interesting with this little snippet from the canon story:
2) When someone dies after a long illness, one of the strangest things is not having to worry about them any more. For weeks or months your entire life has been full of anxiety about how best to care for them; now, that anxiety is over. There is nothing more to do. That in itself is its own loss. Watson has been trying to get Holmes to stop it with the cocaine since “Scandal in Bohemia.” One imagines there were many conflicts about that behind the scenes. And here it is, the syringe that caused them so much trouble, and an empty cocaine bottle. Watson’s been battling it all these years, and it’s over. It can’t do Holmes any more harm. And in a way, that’s a more convincing proof of his death than Watson’s imagined scene of the two of them taking that long last fall down into the whirlpool.
You know, I was looking at this going, that’s a very pretty actor they found for this very small part. He kind of reminds me of a young Jude Law…and then I get to the closing credits:
. In the canon story, all of Professor Presbury’s symptoms have been documented by Bennett before he consults Holmes. Everyone can agree on what’s happening; they just don’t know why. Chapman works hard to make the mystery more mysterious, and therefore more Ominous. First, there’s debate about whether anything is happening at all, with Bennett apparently willing to dismiss Edith’s account of the face at her window if it will help him avoid pissing off his boss. Bennett rubbed me the wrong way immediately, partly because of his very lukewarm defense of Edith, and partly because of some indefinable…
Every serious Holmes fan, whatever their take on the Great Partnership, has a special place in their heart for “The Three Garridebs.” As a story, it has its drawbacks. The plot is recycled and the detective work elementary. But who cares about any of that? Because at the denouement, “Killer” Evans puts a bullet into Watson, and then this happens:
So what up to that point was an interestingly tense man-to-man confrontation–how can you not love Holmes promising to “crush” the hot sailor he’s nose to nose with–becomes the happy ending of a heterosexual romance, in which Holmes plays matchmaker. Possibly my favorite moment comes after Crocker refuses the gift of freedom for the second time, on the grounds that someone else might swing for the crime. Holmes turns around, and what he says is perfectly measured and reasonable, and yet his whole body is shouting “YOU IDIOT, will you stop being noble and let me HELP YOU!!”
Holmes's brow furrowed slightly. Literary questions, unlike most others, still had the capacity to puzzle him.
Once Holmes has a puzzle to solve, though, downtime is over; and we share Watson’s joy and relief as Holmes’s engines start revving. Paul also makes the solution slightly more complicated by adding the oak tree weathervane, which helps explain how so many previous generations could have failed to solve this puzzle. (Why everyone assumes that the trees named in the ritual won’t have grown at all since 1649, I don’t know; but then I’m not a botanist, maybe it’s not bullshit.) But what I like about this one, and about “Dancing Men,” is that they manage to actually dramatize the finding of the solution, instead of just glossing over it. Brett’s good enough at drawing your interest that you can watch him messing around with fishing rods and twine and whittling pegs and whatnot and still be entertained. And watching them row him across the little moat thingy, standing erect in the prow of that tiny dinghy for all the world as if he were George Washington crossing the Delaware, is priceless:
Here, however, I have to stop and say: regardless of all of this, the entire reunion scene is a treasure, and that is largely down to Brett, who turns in a solid gold performance. That sort of anxious yet cocky look on his face as he turns around to do that line about smoking in Watson’s consulting room…and then that smile as he stretches his arms out for Watson is every goddamn thing you ever wanted from the reunion and never bloody got from “The Empty Hearse.” He’s just so happy about finally having Watson back…and that makes that sad little scene with Holmes watching Watson ‘investigate’ at Reichenbach all the more heart-twisting. Let me just say, as a veteran of series 3 and 4 of
Anyway, what “Silver Blaze” does instead is give us a chance to luxuriate in all the little things we already know and love. Holmes’s confrontation with Silas Bourne is delicious, especially the way they both handle Silas’s stick. I could watch Sherlock Holmes bending loudmouthed assholes to his will and forcing them to do his bidding ALL DAY. You also have to love Holmes directing Watson to “linger”:
What Chapman does is turn this passive-aggressive lament into a lovers’ tiff which is actually kind of fun to watch and must have been fun for them to play. Watson, as in the canon story, is irritated by being dragged away from his surgery to hear about this nonsense; but instead of this oh poor me I know I’m mostly useless but I still have some humble role to play BS, Watson Goes Off:
, though Doyle has considerably sanitized the process. Serge Voronoff, who pioneered this ‘treatment,’ used to graft animal testicles onto the testicles of his patients, on the theory that this would increase their sexual potency. So Dr. Presbury, who’s so keen to marry a woman his daughter’s age, would actually have been a prime candidate for Voronoff’s operation.
And then the universe said, “Nice adaptation of ‘Three Garridebs’ you have there. Be a shame if something were to HAPPEN TO IT.”
Going into this, Brett has to have known that the “what a lovely thing a rose is” speech was going to be hard to motivate. In the story, it really comes out of nowhere, and goes nowhere. Now I can tell you exactly what happened: Doyle temporarily hijacked Holmes’s voice–the voice of authority, and the only one of Doyle’s voices that people really listened to–to defend something he himself really cared about, viz., the existence of God. (In another obvious soapbox moment, on their way back to London, Holmes gratuitously points out some industrial schools being built as “lighthouses” of the future.) Here’s what Doyle wrote:
, of course, but Brett doesn’t do his own singing in that.) Watson low-key snarking at Holmes about how the paper contains all kinds of international news about war and revolution but “nothing you’d be interested in” is also a lovely moment. All the 221B stuff in this episode is top-drawer, including Mrs. Hudson. My only regret is that instead of Lestrade, who’s Mycroft’s sidekick in the canon story, they’ve substituted Inspector Bradstreet. I assume this was because Colin Jeavons was for some reason unavailable; but it’s too bad. He would have made it all even better. Charles Gray is all business in this one; but you can still see the Holmes spirit in him, especially at the moment when he’s promising his little brother to send him a list of all the known spies in the greater London area. A nice little touch added for the adaptation is the deciphering of this list when it finally arrives: “He writes like a drunken crab,” Holmes comments, tossing the note to Watson in hopes that as a doctor, he can make some sense of it.
When Watson comes back in, laden with presents and holly and full of the details on the Hotel Cosmopolitan robbery, Holmes is just sitting there in his deshabille, gazing at the hat. Watson is a little piqued to find out he’s being ignored; but again, the beauty of Granada Holmes is how comfortable they are with each other. Watson’s not going to lose his temper over it; after his bit of snark, he happily heads over to his desk to start going through the Christmas cards and teasing Holmes about what a sinister and terrible criminal history must be attached to that hat. The Reading of the Hat has to be one of the best deduction bits Doyle wrote for Holmes, and Brett and Burke actually make it better. They’re both playing with each other, Holmes adopting a condescending pity in his explanation and Watson pretending to be annoyed by it, and it builds to a nice climax right at the moment that Peterson busts in with the carbuncle.
to produce it, as he says he intends to do, there seems to me no guarantee that the judge would even take it into consideration–especially since, unlike in the canon story, Turner does in fact die before the trial is over.
This story was adapted by Derek Marlowe, who appears to have been under the impression that his name should have been Philip Marlowe. The first half is quite entertaining, even endearing, in classic Granada Holmes style. Then, Marlowe runs out of story, and fills out the rest of the hour with a hardboiled detective AU involving a chase on a train, guns, extrajudicial murder, and a femme fatale. “You still retain your low opinion of women,” says Mycroft to Sherlock, after the case wraps up. No, Mycroft; no, he doesn’t. I hate to be the one to break it to you…but that man you’re talking to isn’t really your brother.
,” back in the 1990s. To see them on screen again makes me feel genuinely happy, regardless of all the crap going on right now.
Granted, Doyle seems to have progressively forgotten this history as the saga moves forward; we all know the wound eventually migrates to the leg; Watson’s memories of his service and his feelings about the Army migrate along with it. But as long as we’re in adaptation land anyway, we’re free to take Holmes’s interactions with Major Murphy as a deliberate disruption of Watson’s performance of respect and loyalty to an institution that doesn’t really deserve it. After first snapping at him over his hamhanded treatment of the media and his withholding of the facts, Holmes then maneuvers himself into this beautifully insinuating moment captured in the image above, where–as Murphy insists that Mrs. Barclay would be incapable of murder–Holmes rests his elbow on Murphy’s shoulder, looks at him, and without actually saying words basically tells Murphy, "So you’re in love with her then. Well, isn’t that delicious.” From the image out of context, of course, it looks like Holmes just loves himself a military man, especially one with a luxurious mustache and a full head of hair.
I should also talk about how much I love the way they handle Holmes’s opening conversation with Watson about his brother. In the story as written, Mycroft comes up as part of a discussion about heredity. Doyle obviously believes in nature over nurture; many of the saga’s biggest and baddest villains (Moriarty, Magnussen, Roylott, Kemp) are described as products of bad breeding–or, as Doyle puts it in Kemp’s case, “the foulest antecedents.” One of Mycroft’s purposes is to confirm that intelligence is hereditary; only DNA could account for the birth of two such prodigies to the same parents. Now that Charles Murray is back in circulation on American college campuses, Doyle’s determinism seems even creepier to me than usual, so it’s a relief that in the adaptation, the focus is on Holmes’s finessing of the delicate business of revealing to Watson that in fact he’s not entirely alone in the world. He’s obviously nervous about it because he’s laid out a very careful plan of attack: bring Mycroft up in casual conversation, then see if Watson’s interested, and if he bites, then let him know Mycroft has a case for him and see if he wants to go. Holmes is obviously watching Watson for his reactions, and although he acts annoyed by Watson’s enthusiasm, he must secretly be thrilled by it. It’s a big deal, bringing the “intimate friend” to meet the family.
But, again, balanced with this we get the story of Holmes’s developing friendship with Lestrade; and that turns out to be a (to me) unexpectedly compelling story. The three men involved in this investigation all have their own perspectives and their own theories, and it’s tremendous fun to see them playing off each other. Watson’s attachment to his own theory about this being a monomaniac with an “idee fixe” gives him more energy than we’ve seen form Hardwicke in the past couple of episodes. I particularly like the scene where he marches into the sitting room to tell Holmes the game is on, so he should finish up his tea and get dressed because they’re leaving in two minutes. That is one thing I do appreciate about what Hardwicke brings to the table: his Watson loves turning the tables on Holmes and taking charge, and Brett lets us know that Holmes low-key loves it. Take that however you will. Also delicious is Holmes trying to give Watson a hint about the streetlamp without Lestrade noticing, so Watson can score a point over Lestrade and temporarily get to the head of the class.
of detection. His whole gig is resolving apparently supernatural or mysterious occurrences into rationally explicable phenomena. And no matter how you slice it, that is just not what happens in “The Creeping Man.” The solution is impossible for a twenty-first century person (at least one with a basic grasp of human biology and modern science) to believe. And unlike with other problematic solutions, such as in “Speckled Band” or “Norwood Builder,” it’s not wrong in some partial and fixable way. It is wrong completely and totally, from one end to the other.
, which dates from 1895, also involves a husband and wife team–Sir Robert and Lady Gertrude Chiltern–where the husband is a big deal in politics. It also involves a dual sensitive-letter plot (each person in this marriage has a sensitive letter that they are afraid will ruin them if the wrong people find out about it). And for each of them, Sir Robert’s best bachelor friend Lord Goring is instrumental in solving the problem. And I guess I just can’t help getting a kick out of the fact that Jeremy Brett, in a way, got to play this role twice.
Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte…just relax…soon it will all be ov- WILL YOU SHUT THOSE BLOODY MEDITATION BOWLS UP!
“Indeed, this metafictional conceit has already grown so unstable I fear it must collapse within seconds. Why not relinquish it, prior to the cut tag, and repair together to the Turkish bath. I feel a STRONG need to cleanse my pores of this particular escapade.”
Most of these episodes have a cold open showing how the client got into his or her mess, followed by the credits. The beginning of “The Blue Carbuncle’s” cold open is straight-up ridiculous. It’s an attempt to dramatize, in the cheesiest possible fashion, Holmes’s speech about precious stones as “the devil’s pet baits.” It’s the only real misfire—indeed, once we get to the Hotel Cosmopolitan, the rest of the cold open is a cut above–and I wouldn’t be so churlish as to bring it up if it didn’t give me an excuse to talk about possibly my favorite Victorian novel ever, Wilkie Collins’s
Honestly, I can’t tell whether this is supposed to be a fic prompt, or…well, no, I know that it’s supposed to symbolize Holmes’s love for disguise, which is certainly indulged in this episode. There are several scenes of Holmes taking off his diguises and washing his face and hands in a basin while talking to Watson. The production team obviously loved the “master of disguise” thing and Brett really threw himself into it. His Holmes really is an actor, and a rare one. And if you want to imagine what he did with that mask after the King went home, don’t let me stop you.
And what is one more lie, amongst all the others I have put in print, so many of them so much less beautiful?
So, one of the things that I like about “Boscombe Valley” is that, now that all this is out in the open, Holmes and Watson do get a weekend getaway that they both actually enjoy. Fresh air notwithstanding, for once the hotel isn’t a run-down hole-in-the-wall that serves nasty food. It’s a nice place, they’re being treated very well, and you can see them both sort of relaxing and enjoying all the comforts. Watson even breaks out what must be his most flamboyant dinner jacket:
episode which starts with Watson on holiday by himself. One imagines–I imagine, anyway–that Holmes finally just said look, these ‘holidays’ make me miserable, but you obviously need them; so go out there and get as much fresh air as you want, just leave me to poison myself in London. And yet, Holmes can apparently only stand so much tobacco-enshrouded solitude before he goes galloping down to wherever Watson is holidaying to drag him off on a case.
about him. Holmes and Pike are of an age and knew each other at school. One has the sense that in Langdale Pike Holmes sees the end of a road that he himself might have taken: a life dedicated to the pleasures of the senses rather than the intellect, to the pursuit of beauty rather than to the pursuit of truth. He has a monocle instead of a magnifying glass; his knowledge is as encyclopedic but attained via different methods. (This impression is no doubt enhanced by the fact that Langdale actually reminds me a lot of Robert Downey Jr.’s Holmes.) He also sees the deterioration of what we can assume was Langdale’s former beauty.
I wanted to be mad at Bowen about this, so I looked back at the original story to see whether Lady Frances actually makes a full recovery. I discovered that there is actually no information about that. Watson pulls her back from the brink of death, but we don’t know anything about what happens to her afterward. So in the end, I don’t think I can be mad at him, much as I hate this ending. It’s tragic, and it makes me angry. But in a way, it’s a commentary on Doyle’s own treatment of Lady Frances, who disappears from the narrative as soon as Holmes and Watson are done saving her. Bowen at least continues the story and gives Holmes an opportunity to take a good hard look at his own role in this debacle, and a hard stare into the future at his consequences.
I love their last little interaction at the dinner table for so many reasons. One, it flips the tables on the running gag about food; Holmes is about to just tuck in when Watson brings up Horner, and he’s the one left looking longingly at the untasted supper as they get up and head out to the police station. Two, it shows Watson getting what he *really* wants—justice for the innocent and suffering Horner—without having to stop Holmes from being Holmes. And three, I will admit, the Dickensian manipulation got to me even though I know better and I do sort of cry a little bit every time I see Horner coming out of the jail to embrace his two kids while his tearful wife looks on.
All the reviews in this series were written during a rewatch I did in the months after my wife was diagnosed with breast cancer. Going back to this show, which I first encountered on PBS in the mid-1980s as a misfit teenager who didn't yet know she was a lesbian, was one of the things that helped me keep it together while she was going through chemotherapy and radiation. (She's fine now.)  At the time I was watching the Adventures and Memoirs in the basement with my little sister, I couldn't imagine I would ever find love. And now here I was, watching it again in my late 40s, faced with the possibility of losing my wife of 28 years to the same disease that carried off Brett's wife Joan Sullivan in 1985. This song is me trying to understand what it means that Brett was there for me during both of these difficult times. I don't sing, so I can't perform it; but here are the words.
That mullioned window behind Holmes includes a pane which is a mirror instead of glass, in which you can see Baynes reflected. There’s another window just like it on the other side, in which we can see Holmes reflected while the camera focuses on Baynes:
Young Plaidder was very confused about the London fogs. By the time I was out of college I had been to London many times and never seen anything like the kind of fog Doyle describes at the beginning of this story. I had no idea that this was because of environmental regulations passed after the deadly London fog of 1952 killed thousands of people.
On the page, Holmes is immortal. He rises from the dead, and is allowed to drift off into various afterlives: keeping bees on the South Downs, international espionage, the Valhalla of the mind where it is always 1895. That’s part of what fascinates us about him: he never has to get old, he never has to die. Over time, film and TV adaptation preserves the myth of Holmes’s immortality by continually renewing the character and the stories so that a rejuvenated Holmes reappears, bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and modern, with each iteration. But this adaptation, because of the rapid deterioration of Brett’s health during the last few years of filming, unavoidably dramatizes human frailty, vulnerability, and mortality in ways that are often difficult to watch.
and since Holmes doesn’t actually fire the pistol before releasing, they’re not really replicating the conditions under which the original shot took place anyway. But the solution of “Speckled Band” is cheez whiz too, and “Speckled Band” is still a better story. Why? Well, “Speckled Band” is (for Doyle) a fairly original story with well-individualized characters, whereas “Thor Bridge” could also have been titled “Jane Eyre With Guns
Ooooh, distortion. Could it be that this Don Murillo has a soul as distorted and warped as this reflection? Stay tuned to find out!
to the Granada series. Not having ever made it to the Hardwicke era, however, I could not at that point appreciate how deeply “The Musgrave Ritual”–the episode, more than the ACD canon story–must have incised itself into Mark Gatiss’s brain. Understanding this doesn’t make “The Final Problem” any less insane; but it does answer a question I’ve long had about this episode, which is, “Where the hell did any of this come from?”
Now. What happens next is, from an artistic point of view, terrible. And yet, I’m going to argue, it is also extremely meaningful, and makes this episode so much more important than it would otherwise be.
Holmes stood to replace his pipe upon the mantel. He did not enter into the lively disputation I had expected. He simply bent his head and stared into the fire, one elbow leaning on the corner of the mantel. The flames crackling in the grate illuminated his features with sinuous, rippling strokes that no painter's hand could equal.
That is one thing you can say for this episode; Chapman steers clear of that racist history I was talking about earlier by suggesting that the Great Sherlock Holmes himself is as close to the lower primates as any other human would be–closer, perhaps, given that Holmes too is not always perceived by his peers as being fully human. So that’s a relief, because…wait a minute…
While searching in vain for a photograph showing both of them in Hamlet, I came across one of the publicity images for that production:
Peter Hammond, the director, had his own ideas about how to sustain that grotesque note; and that’s mostly what I’m going to talk about below. In particular, I’m going to talk about Hammond’s thing with mirrors. And though I don’t plan to talk about
What’s the point of this? OK, Holmes and his nemesis are sharing a shot; but there are other ways to do that. Or this:
I will say, though, I do kind of love the Lunch Episode. It’s all so awkward and weird and sinister and there’s Watson, who can certainly tell something’s going on, and is very curious about the parallel scratches on Hayes’s neck, but is still trying to act like a customer anyway. And then he gets his black pudding and sad accompaniments. “How is it, Watson?” “It is disgusting, Holmes.”
To be honest, it would be hard to develop Maria Gibson, because if she were actually a coherent three-dimensional character we would reject her behavior as completely implausible. In “Norwood Builder” Jonas Oldacre doesn’t actually
argument is bullshit, for many reasons. One: it assumes that beauty is an absolute given that all humans instinctively recognize. Two: it ignores the fact that flowers are in fact necessary for our existence, because without them we wouldn’t have pollination and therefore most of our food. Three: it’d be harder to find a flower whose scent and appearance owed more to human engineering than the rose. Doyle specifies a
This episode hammers some nails in the coffins of the two biggest adaptation cliches that the Granada people were trying to kill: Unemotional Holmes and Stupid Watson.
Unfortunately, Hawkesworth decides to be a stickler for canon when it comes to Watson, which undoes some of the good work done in the earlier episodes. Watson, in “The Final Problem,” is more than usually obtuse. You can’t really do anything about the fact that he falls for the note from the hotel; that’s integral to the plot. But you don’t have to include the moment when Watson sees a lone figure dressed in black climbing the mountain toward where he left Holmes, but thinks nothing of it. Hawkesworth does; and he shouldn’t have. Granada Watson is really not that stupid.
–would blow up moments like this into melodrama by exaggerating Holmes’s addictions and turning his housekeeping quirks into epic dysfunctions. With a Holmes who’s that self-destructive, Watson’s nurturing becomes self-denial, and the relationship becomes an opera of codependency. But this scene is presented as just one among many moments in a relationship long and deep enough to encompass much more than what we can see from our voyeuristic position. And so I appreciate the way Watson just sits down, pours Holmes some tea, gently pushes it at him, and says, let’s go down to Norwood and see what we can do. And it’s such a poignant and heartstrings-playing moment when Holmes looks back at him and says, “I feel I shall need your company, and your moral support, today.”
Holmes fandom had not grown very old before people started pointing out that if Holmes really wanted to hide from Moriarty till it was all over, going on a jaunt with Watson was probably the dumbest way he could have done it. First of all, Watson is not as good at hiding as Holmes is. Second, what idiot does not know at this point that to find Holmes all you have to do is find Watson and wait?
Behind the cut tag, I will of course be talking about our two favorite people; but I am also going to spend some time on Natasha Richardson and Violet Hunter, one of the Remarkable Women of ACD Canon. Because Violet and I go way back; and because “The Copper Beeches” is yet another ACD story where the actual mystery is just the tip of the creepiness iceberg.
. Obviously there are narrative reasons for this quirk of his; but I think it’s worth pointing out that from the beginning, the mystery matters more than the crime and the truth matters more than punishment. Over and above that, though, Holmes always insists on people being honest
The episode ends with Lady Frances sitting in her invalid chair, with Green sitting behind her, looking over her shoulder. It’s a bright and sunny scene, but it’s also ominous. She doesn’t look very aware of her surroundings; he doesn’t seem to have any way of interacting with her except silently waiting in the shadows as he did before.
beggar could do this; it worked for St. Clair only because he’s really middle-class and therefore better at everything, including begging, than the ‘real’ poor. And yet, if Neville St. Clair can buy a house in the suburbs and support a wife and kids just on half-crowns he begs from people on the street, what excuse do all of these
And then, along with this nuanced verbal performance of Holmes’s uncertainty and doubt, you get the genius of Brett’s physical performance every time Holmes catches a break. In the best scene Brett and Hardwicke have together in this episode, Holmes is about to head out the front door for his initial investigations when Watson calls him back by telling him that the guy he was planning to visit has been murdered. This is in canon, but in canon the whole thing happens in the sitting room at 221B. Hawkesworth by now knows exactly how to milk this, and it’s glorious. Holmes comes running upstairs, and he and Watson are both so excited that they wind up standing in the hallway while Watson reads the story out of the paper as Holmes listens and interjects. Then Holmes grabs the paper and runs in, with Watson behind him, and finishes reading it out loud himself; and when Watson suggests that maybe the murder is a coincidence, he just tosses the thing in the air. As I observed re “Dancing Men,” I honestly think I would watch an hour of just Jeremy Brett interacting with paper. I don’t know why; maybe it’s nostalgia for the pre-digital world, which I actually remember. But I just love all the paper.
The episode ends with McFarlane and his mother at home, playing a version of the Granada theme on the piano. The loving teamwork of these two men has saved this poor child from Oldacre’s possessive, vindictive, malicious and destructive abuse of heterosexuality. Harris brings Watson in on the interview with McFarlane’s mother, which means that we get Watson’s reaction when she shows him the defaced photograph, and it is gratifyingly intense. After “Solitary Cyclist,” after “Speckled Band,” and after “Copper Beeches,” Watson has developed an instinctive recognition of toxic masculinity and a healthy revulsion and loathing of it. He’s learning; Holmes is learning. And I was learning, too: that two people of the same gender could make a good team, could become each other’s mainstay and support, could entwine their lives without losing their identities, and could use the camaraderie and the happiness that their love enabled to help other people. So this was an important episode, for me; and it was great to get to revisit it.
Well, Jeremy Paul’s adaptation of “Naval Treaty” doesn’t do a great job of making sense of Holmes’s behavior; if anything, it gets weirder. After the first trip to Woking, as he’s headed off to bed, Watson says, “Are you all right?” A lot of things about Holmes seem to be off in this one, and it’s hard to know whether that was the result of intention or of the lack of it. But the theory does occur to me–and it’s probably occurred to others before me–that maybe, in fact, the point here is that Holmes is not, in fact, all right. And that this may have to do with the fact that this is, AFAIK, the only case in the canon that involves someone from
and I love the “write me down an ass” line. But I do have to ask: what “bird” was Holmes expecting? Clearly Colonel Valentine is the only suspect left by the time they set this trap. And what a self-absorbed sorry little sonofabitch he is, too. Holmes, after he finds out that Sir James is dead, wonders whether it was illness or suicide. I personally wonder why Holmes doesn’t consider the possibility that Valentine killed him. It would have made the story too long, I suppose. At any rate, again, Holmes’s contempt for aristocrats is precious to me. If they could bottle that and turn it into a fragrance I would wear it. I particularly love Holmes’s reaction when he asks Valentine, to make the letter more realistic, what his “terms” would be if he were holding out for more money, and Valentine answers right away.
“My dear Watson, you entirely misunderstand the problem. In both of those cases, the animal in question was merely a tool in the hands of a human villain employing it for nefarious yet coherent purposes. But when the animal in fact
And yet, I never finished the series. The change in Watsons was too much for me; I stopped following it after “The Final Problem.” This time, I mean to see the thing through. So some of these episodes are old friends, and some will be, to me, brand new.
Hawkesworth and the production team find ways of compensating for all this, some of them surprisingly effective even after all this time   Having Watson shout “HOLMES!” into the cataract a few times is a little cheesy, but since I am an old X-Files fan and accustomed to the “SCULLAAAAAAY!!!”, it sort of got me anyway. But the real killer is the final scene in which Watson, back at 221B and surrounded by Holmes’s stuff, turns to the camera for the first time in the series and just tells us, directly, about the heavy heart with which he takes up his pen to record for the final time the singular gifts of Sherlock Holmes. I don’t know why that gets to me, but I’m sort of choking up even as I type this. We all identify with Watson, in our own love and loyalty for an impossible being who seems so real and yet never existed. Watson’s loss is a mirror for the loss we feel every time we’re reminded that Holmes isn’t real, that he never has been real. It’s unexpected, and yet strangely moving, for us to have that one moment of direct connection–as if Watson is reaching out to us for support. You knew him, he seems to be saying. You loved him too. You know what I’m going through.
Marina Sirtis, everyone. Counselor Deanna Troi. That’s her. She does a great murder stare but does not have much dialogue in this episode. Made me kind of wish they had cast her as Sophia Kratides in “Greek Interpreter” and done the whole double-murder thing. But I digress.
And he does. The way he forces the Duke, who is desperately trying to keep the lid on a family scandal, to welcome him into the investigation is a thing of beauty. Unlike in canon, Holmes casually-not-casually drops a reference to Heidegger’s bicycle (Heidegger’s Bicycle…sounds like an indie band) just to let him know: I already know too much about this investigation for you to cut me out of it. He wins; he knows it; the Duke knows it; it’s awesome. I think if I were Watson, watching Holmes lay the smackdown on an aristocrat who thinks he’s All That would be all the foreplay I needed.
So let me first say that the real mystery of “Priory School” is: what in the world is going on at 221b *before* Dr. Huxtable shows up? The lights are down, the candles are lit, Watson is whispering, and Holmes is lying flat on the couch, apparently but evidently not really asleep. Watson seems not to want him disturbed. Holmes doesn’t show any signs of consciousness until Huxtable collapses on the floor, at which point he springs bolt upright. Is this some more of that “lethargy” he was talking about at the beginning of “The Musgrave Ritual?” Has Watson taken to supervising him during his drug trips now? Or have they just had a romantic candlelight dinner and were hoping, after a digestive nap, for a little postprandial private entertainment? Or what? When Huxtable asks Holmes to come back to the Priory School with him, Holmes starts talking about how busy they both are, while Watson looks at him with evident surprise. So what’s going on? Why’s he pretending he’s busy when he isn’t?
"Whereas, to me..." He took up the hand I had just rested on my knee, interlacing his fingers with mine. "Three gems or thirty-six or thirty-nine, what does it signify? The beauty, the history, the romance of each jewel is unique. It cannot simply be...multiplied."
All right, well, at least they started strong, let’s hope things pick up in…let’s see what’s next…ah, “The Priory School.” That should be interesting.
. Granada’s “Empty House” establishes that during the Hiatus, Lestrade and Watson developed their own working relationship, and in this episode they both follow Holmes around like residents following the attending. Holmes obviously really enjoys the extra attention, and it spurs him to new heights of histrionics that are quite entertaining and by this time quite familiar. But it’s the final conversation between Holmes and Lestrade at the end of this episode that makes it worth sitting through all the BS about Italians. At that point, this episode becomes truly extraordinary. You would think that by this point in the series you’d have pretty much seen everything Brett could do with this character. But you would be wrong.
TOS, pretty much most of the time) you run into an episode that just feels unloved. It’s hard to say exactly what gives it away. A certain lack of investment on the part of the actors, perhaps; little lags and pauses dragging down the pacing; clumsily inserted reactions; or just shots like this one, which plunks Holmes into the middle of a tonally muddled, uncomposed mess of bedsheets and antique furniture with nary a thought spared for visual impact. But somehow, you just get the feeling that nobody really took this episode to heart and pledged to do their best for it. They got through it, put it in the can, and moved on.
of Watson’s hallucinations, and instead just tells us what Watson’s sensations are. But on film, the only way to get into Holmes’s head is to show us what’s in there. And there is definitely nothing you can represent–certainly nothing you can represent on network television in 1988–that wouldn’t be vastly disappointing to the viewers after all this buildup.
So one can’t say they pulled punches when it came to depicting the poverty; indeed, they seem to have scoured the country for dissolute-looking extras to dress up in rags and lie around in the street. But all of this is shot in such an alienating way that the overall impression is not, this poverty is an injustice, but rather, poor people are scary. The same scariness is baked into the scene in the opium den, which takes forever, and which is shot like a scene in an 80s horror film.
We will never know. Huxtable’s famous faint on the hearthrug is one of those little directorial touches I was talking about. While Huxtable’s out, we get a little montage of his perceptions of the past few days, as the boys’ choir sings “Libera me” while we see poor little Arthur’s empty room, empty desk and chair, dangling and neglected cleats, and so on. It conveys something we’re not going to get from Huxtable’s dialogue or his interactions with Holmes and Watson, which is that he is genuinely sad about what’s happened and concerned about the boy; in the canon story, he seems mainly concerned for the reputation of the school. It’s a creative way of getting in a little exposition along with some atmosphere, and two thumbs up for that.
Gary Hopkins wrote “Devil’s Foot,” which I loved, so I’m just going to assume that most of the WTF? decisions made during the process of adapting this story were dictated by external circumstances. Obviously the biggest was to replace Watson with Mycroft, who has nothing to do with the canon story. I don’t, as usual, know anything about the production process; but although Brett seems to be doing better in this episode than he was in “Dying Detective,” I assume that either Hardwicke had another project to do at filming time, or this change was another attempt to protect an ailing Brett by reducing his workload. This story is very heavy on the deduction–it really makes you wish they’d done it earlier; it would have been a great “Adventures” or “Return” episode and it’s set in 1894–and substituting Mycroft allows him to handle his share of the deducing, which leaves Brett less to memorize and fewer takes to do. It also introduces some novelty value; and I’m not against that. Trying something new insulates the episode slightly from invidious comparisons; since they’ve never done an episode with just Sherlock and Mycroft, people can’t watch it and wish they were watching some earlier episode with just Sherlock and Mycroft. And I’m sure there were Mycroft fans back in the 1990s, as there are today, who were glad to see him get some screen time. Hopkins works in a couple of tantalizing little references to the Holmes brothers’ home life–Sherlock seems particularly pained to discover (improbably, for the first time) that Mycroft has their father’s magnifying glass, and I was somewhat pained to discover that the “whatever is left, however improbable” line originally belonged to their father.
Holmes occasionally has these philosophical digressions; but I have a special fondness for this one, because it shows him honestly bewildered–in a way that I frequently find myself bewildered–by the stupid persistence of “misery and violence and fear.” I watch the torrent of filth spewing out of the current president’s administration, and on one level I get it–playing to the base, etc.–and I can tell you all about the historical and economic and cultural factors that created that ‘base’, but on the most basic level, I just keep asking myself WHY. WHY do people want a world like this? I’m sure you are all answering that question in your heads right now, each according to your personal ideological matrix–but I’m not talking about politics, I’m talking about what Holmes calls the “standing perennial problem” of constant and apparently meaningless human suffering. “What object is served?” There are material objects you can name, of course; but the question cuts deeper than that. Roylott, for instance, in “Speckled Band” has a concrete object: he wants to hang onto his stepdaughters’ income. All right. What makes their income worth more to him than their lives? I DON’T KNOW.
Physically and personality-wise, the contrasts are obvious; but their methods are very similar (one suspects Baynes of being a closet Sherlock Holmes fan). So, all right, the mirrors emphasize that for the viewer.
I really tried very hard to go into this episode with an open mind, even though I knew it was written by Derek Marlowe, the man who thought it was a good idea to end “The Greek Interpreter” with a 20-minute chase scene on a train. I was excited for it, even, because I had never actually seen it before–which surprised me, because I really thought I’d seen all of the Brett and Burke episodes. Imagine my joy when I discovered there was a whole new one that was as yet unknown to me! Even if it was written by Derek Marlowe!
makes them freakier). It’s surprising to see such a self-conscious parallel created between Moriarty and Watson. Holmes, of course, is right behind him; and Watson is very clearly using methods he’s seen Holmes use. But, following the “everything’s better with more Watson” rule I spoke of re “Norwood Builder,” this episode interpolates Watson into the Holmes/Moriarty dynamic from the beginning. For instance, when Holmes starts talking about Moriarty down in the bank vault, Watson says, “Moriarty,” in a tone which leaves no doubt that he understands exactly who Moriarty is and what kind of threat he poses to Holmes. By contrast, when Holmes mentions Moriarty in the ACD canon “Final Problem,” Watson says he’s never heard of him. This episode seems to want us to see
when Brett was actually sick. I really wonder what it was like for Brett and Hardwicke filming these scenes. By all accounts, Hardwicke was very supportive of Brett through his illnesses and they became pretty close. At any rate, I really appreciate the fact that Chapman banished the specialist and let Watson do the doctoring. Also, I like it that Watson gets to actually use his knowledge during his scene with Gruner. The man is a doctor, after all, presumably he knows how to memorize shit.
I assume this is all so that we can start feeling Unnerved and Unsettled by the ominous approach of the Ape Within. Chapman does try to bring out the horror aspects of the story, emphasizing the incest overtones (Presbury’s face at Edith’s window, the fact that he’s violently in love with a girl Edith’s age) and making explicit the threat of sexual violence represented by Presbury’s ‘rejuvenation’ (Alice breaks off the engagement; that night, Presbury invades her bedroom and is obviously planning to rape her). And I guess that’s not a stupid idea; but honestly, no matter how you dress it up on the way there, the moment will eventually come when you are asked to be shocked and horrified…
But that’s not really the most intimate thing that happens in this episode. A more important decision is to make Watson the only doctor attending Holmes after his beating. Here, I have to say, I do miss Burke just a little bit, because his Watson’s bedside manner was more handsy (I talk about this in my writeup of “Naval Treaty”). But Watson sitting in that darkened room with a really pretty severely damaged Holmes is still pretty intense, and I love the little eye-roll Holmes gives him as he accepts Watson’s authority ( “Yes…DOCTOR”). There’s a moment later on when Watson’s sitting next to Holmes, blasting through a book on ancient Chinese pottery while also taking Holmes’s temperature. Watson reaches over, grabs the thermometer without even looking at it, glances at it to make sure the temperature’s normal, and then starts shaking it down with one hand as he returns to the book. Holmes’s eyes follow him, and it’s just a kind of heart-wringing little moment. Watson’s completely absorbed in his task, and so he appears to be indifferent to Holmes’s gaze. But what Watson’s absorbed in, of course, is his devotion to Holmes–that’s why he’s cramming on ancient Chinese pottery as if his medical license depends on it, that’s why taking Holmes’s temperature has become so routine he can do it automatically. I think you can see Holmes realizing that, and just lingering on this view of Watson, completely absorbed in his task, helping and healing him just by being there with him. It’s a more poignant version of the “moral support” moment from “Norwood Builder,” years later, both of them older and more fragile.
I heaved a sigh. Holmes drifted toward me. One of his hands came to rest, gently, tentatively, upon the top of my head. I was vexed to feel my throat constricting.
So, below the cut tag I’m going to talk about, along with how the adaptation deals with the latent sexism of the original story, some of the people Doyle is stealing from here besides himself (the case of “Second Stain” is ominously similar to that of “The Naval Treaty”). These are: 1) Edgar Allan Poe’s 1844 story “The Purloined Letter” 2) once again, Wilkie Collins’s
This episode, by the way, is helped enormously by the actors playing Hilton and Elsie, who are able to raise the stakes by making you believe in their love and their tragedy. (Betsy Brantley, who plays Elsie, later played the kid’s mother in

, Goring tries to swipe Gertrude’s sensitive letter before Robert can get to it; but he can’t get there in time, and instead Robert and Gertrude wind up working it out on their own. In this version of “Second Stain,” Holmes gets to pull off the sleight of hand that Goring never got to do. Hawkesworth has been concerned all the way through to keep the energy up and to increase the sense of urgency whenever possible. In the canon story, once Hilda caves and confesses, they find Trelawney’s dispatch box, put the letter into it, and then go back to waiting for him like nothing’s happened. In the adaptation, Trelawney’s now keeping the dispatch-box with him, so Holmes has to pull the switch right in front of him. They fudge how he actually does it; but somehow, Holmes introduces the letter into the pile of secret papers
As I said at some point somewhere, I think Kitty and Porky need their own spinoff. The fight in the sewer is one of the most successful fight scenes they’ve staged for this series, and Porky’s personality really shines through. The attack on Holmes is shot so that we don’t have to see too much of Brett fighting; but it’s done effectively enough. (The bastards went for the head. Gruner promises to shoot for the head too. What an evil-minded little psychopath he is.) They should team up and fight crime. The revelation of Kitty’s scars at Violet de Merville’s house is a shock to the viewers, of course, because this is not in canon at all. But it’s also a shock to Holmes; and that’s another thing I appreciate about this adaptation. When he’s telling the story to Watson later, he starts reproaching himself for not having deduced the scars earlier. He’s realizing that for all his science of deduction there are certain blindnesses he still can’t truly compensate for. Holmes has been to Hell, London–but only as a visitor. He doesn’t really know what it’s like to
Marlowe pads the thing out with some Holmes & Watson stuff which is cute enough, but which failed to reach me for reasons I couldn’t at first understand. The scene where Holmes is looking frantically for the clipping on the Worthington bank robbery is pretty good. The opening conversation in the barbershop has its moments. You’d think I’d have grooved more on the closing back-and-forth over Holmes’s violin practicing and the title for the story. And yet I found myself not grooving on it.
Speaking of which: though Holmes and Watson are secondary in this story, every scene they have together is a precious gem. Their opening banter in 221B about Watson’s literary efforts, which has been massaged a bit to be more dynamic and dramatic than in the story, is a thing of beauty, as is Brett’s performance of Holmes’s surprising yet not out of character when you think about it insecurity about his talent and his profession. Brett plays Holmes’s bitterness about becoming an agency for the recovery of lost lead-pencils as genuine: whether he’s going through an actual slump or whether he’s just in a funk, he’s starting to crave a kind of validation that Watson’s stories, admiring though they are, don’t provide. Maybe at this moment he wishes he had taken the credit for some of those cases where he let the police have it. The train conversation about evil in the countryside is also a masterpiece; and even in the action sequences it really does your heart good to see them both flinging off their coats and hats as they run up the central staircase.
Could we maybe be looking at Holmes instead of at Holmes’s reflection in a spotty mirror? I mean, all right, this sets up a nice dissolve where Holmes’s cigarette smoke sort of becomes the smoke on the train where the Tiger of San Pedro will meet his end; but again, why the mirror?
So this is big, for him: trying to let go of self-neglect and find a more sustainable way of being in the world. But as with any major life change, the decision may be sudden but the implementation is gradual, often partial, and always comes with stall-outs and relapses. Watson’s furious when the case turns up–another first, because in the past he’s always welcomed a case as something that will keep Holmes away from the syringe for a few more days. We don’t know if Holmes ever tells Watson that he’s buried the syringe; but Watson’s a doctor, he must figure it out. He’s angry because he’s afraid the case is going to trigger a relapse–not into the drug habit, but into the habits of self-destruction that have become part of his investigative method. And, in fact, he’s right; as soon as Holmes has a case, he snaps right back into his usual mode.
While I’m at it, I’m just going to come out and say this: although it does make sense to do the switch during the hiatus, in other ways, introducing a new Watson is a much
I discovered through it that previous generations of Holmes fandom–the guys who invented the Great Game, and used to write articles about Holmes for the
was Rupert Graves’s Lestrade. It was never easy for me to imagine a similar characterization or relationship in Granada Holmes; but now I can. And that’s worth the crap you put up with on the way to the revelation.
It’s not just a throwaway line, either. The fact that Watson’s no longer living with Holmes is very important to the plot. It’s the reason that 1) Holmes is alone when Gruner’s gang of thugs jump him 2) Watson finds out about this assault from the goddamn
reasons that women like Violet Hunter were dependent on the protection of male figures. The reconstruction of Violet’s first meeting with Rucastle at Westaway’s does a fantastic job with this. Violet is one of a million single women of genteel background in London who are looking for a situation. Her profession requires her to go, alone, into the house of a bunch of complete strangers and live there, cut off from outside help, often without getting any actual cash payment until the end of the quarter. It’s a situation ripe with the potential for abuse, and this scene really brings that home. It’s clear from Richardson’s reactions in this scene that she is picking up creeper vibes from Rucastle immediately; and indeed, they are powerful enough to be registering in telegraph wires 10 miles away. She’s well aware that all of the weird questions Rucastle is asking her–would you mind wearing what we tell you to wear, and moving the way we tell you to move–and Rucastle’s obvious fascination with her physical appearance would all admit of one fairly simple explanation: he’s not looking for a governess, he’s looking for a sex toy, and he’s already got some fairly kinky scenarios he plans to enact as soon as she shows up, possibly with his wife. So she and Rucastle are having this very sexually charged conversation, as Violet tries to defend herself without outright angering Miss Stoper’s new favorite client, while Miss Stoper sits there behind the desk pretending this is a normal interview–because she wants the commission. Violet is being put at risk here not just by the Big Bad but by Stoper’s clearly marked decision to overlook the obvious sketchiness of this situation in order to make a buck for her agency. That she’s essentially pimping Violet out to a client planning to abuse her doesn’t bother Miss Stoper at all. Probably she’s done it before.
This, by the way, is a feature of Holmes as detective that will become very important for the genre. As we already know from “Blue Carbuncle,” Holmes’s #1 goal is not necessarily to punish the wrongdoer. Holmes is willing to, as he says later on in the story, “play tricks with the law of England” in order to get the result he thinks is best. The one constant is that he needs to know the truth–and that in order to secure Holmes’s sympathy or assistance, the suspect
I don’t care whether you think Holmes and Watson are platonic besties or ace soulmates or are doing it on the regular on the hearthrug in the 221b sitting room: whatever you think the true nature of the Great Partnership is, the first time you read these three paragraphs, you realize you have been waiting for them all your life. Finally, the grand emotions of the Great Partnership attain full expression. This moment is as full of vindication, validation, astonishment, and love for the reader as it is for Watson. And for Holmes–that initial moment of panic and denial says so much both about what Watson means to him and how ill-equipped he is to cope with his own feelings. I generally don’t endorse extrajudicial murder; but we have to imagine Holmes is making that threat mainly for Watson (and for the reader): oh by the way, Watson, in case you were wondering, I can now confirm beyond a shadow of suspicion that if in fact anyone ever seriously harms you, I will FUCK HIS SHIT UP.
He was teasing; but I knew, also, that he was asking a serious question. As he was, for once, chasing entirely the wrong scent, he deserved a serious answer.
Miss Sutherland adopted a disguise and insinuated herself into the madam's den. There she found a young woman answering Mary Holder's description--lying in a nightdress in a filthy back room, dehydrated from vomiting and delirious with fever. Through the intercession of the Society, Miss Holder was removed to the Chelsea Women's Hospital. Her consumption, and other diseases, were far advanced. The nurses kept her clean and comfortable; but she sank, and five days later her sufferings were at an end. As our unfortunate client had succumbed to his grief the previous summer, it was his son and heir Mr. Arthur Holder who made the funerary arrangements, and was Miss Holder's chief and inconsolable mourner. The sole note of comfort in Sutherland's report was that, though Miss Holder was very far gone when Mr. Holder arrived, she did know him, and they reconciled. She died in his arms.
Holmes asks the King for money up front, something he hardly ever does–partly to get the money, of course, but also to send the King a message: please do not allow yourself to believe even for a moment that I’m taking this case for any other reason. Certainly not because I’m honored to be consulted by a guy with a title; and definitely not because I give a damn about
is quite engaging as Mycroft; if anything, he’s a little too avuncular and affable for someone whose supposed “shyness and misanthropy” qualifies him for the Diogenes Club. But it’s all kinds of fun watching Holmes and Watson interact with him and react to him. Brett convinces us of the long-standing relationship instantly and effortlessly,  and Burke…well, much about Watson’s love admiration for Holmes is conveyed by the look of pure wonder and joy on his face as he discovers that in fact the universe is marvelous enough to contain TWO human beings like Sherlock Holmes.
This episode, for me, is about more than the case. Everyone’s all “Three Garridebs” this and “Three Garridebs” that; but in canon, IMHO, “Devil’s Foot” is just as big a milestone in Holmes and Watson’s relationship. The adaptation emphasizes and expands that into something which–for me, anyway–becomes profound and moving. In the context of the Granada series, “Devil’s Foot” is a kind of emotional sequel to “Empty House,” in which the Reichenbach trauma is–surreptitiously and subterraneously–reopened, worked through, and healed. Mercifully, this episode is largely unconcerned with
. Holmes believes all of it, is extremely impressed by her bravery and candor, and only starts to question her account once he examines the crime scene afterward.
"You desire me to steal myself," he said, sitting back on his heels and fixing me with a quizzical look.
But the whole thing just goes off the rails as soon as Latimer tries to make a break for it. First of all, Holmes basically kills Latimer. Latimer is the idiot who tries to escape from a moving train; but he’s hanging from the door, shouting for Sophia to help him, and Holmes deliberately physically prevents both Sophia and Watson from doing it. After Latimer falls to his death, Watson is, quite properly, horrified by Sherlock’s complicity. This isn’t just the collateral damage we saw in “Speckled Band” and “Copper Beeches;” this is vintage Dirty Harry-style vigilantism. And quite frankly, I hate that shit; but even people who don’t hate it like I do know enough to know that this is out of character.
There are a lot of surprises in “Shoscombe Old Place,” because about 75% of this episode is extrapolation. In most ways, the extrapolations improve the story, which I evidently found one of the least memorable.
So what would have been the right decision in “Solitary Cyclist”–to go after the guy who’s obviously stalking her–is the wrong decision in “Frances Carfax,” because unlike Violet Smith, Lady Frances Carfax can’t be trusted to know what’s good for her. Holmes paints a picture of a world in which women alone are constantly besieged by opportunistic criminals against whose wiles they prove defenseless. Watson goes on stubbornly attributing independence and agency to her; but in this universe, he’s wrong. Noting that she was alone and apparently not under anyone’s power when she appeared at the bank, Watson says, “She was free.” Holmes knows better: “A person may walk off the edge of a cliff because she has been invited to look at the moon.”
Moments later, as we were kissing on the hearth-rug, the answer came to me all at once, the way the solution to a riddle does.
Now it’s entirely possible that one of the reasons I didn’t like this episode better is that I have no fond memories of it to give it the kind of nostalgic glow that suffuses the other episodes, and which helps you overlook some of the production problems. But leaving that aside for a moment…
Richardson brought to the role just the right combination of strength and vulnerability; she’s believable both as the intrepid investigator and as the endangered victim. It’s largely thanks to her and Ackland that the large chunks of this episode that don’t feature Holmes and Watson are gripping instead of boring (as in, say, “The Crooked Man”). The screenplay, meanwhile, seems to have attempted to mitigate *against* the Violet the Hunter reading. Some of the dialogue used to support that theory is reassigned (often to Watson), and when Watson is reading his conclusion out loud to Holmes at the end of the episode, he omits the line about being disappointed that Holmes no longer took an interest in her after the case was over. It’s probably Richardson’s performance that accounts for my love for an episode where Holmes and Watson do comparatively little, and it is proof that you CAN write an episode around a female character and still have it be a perfectly viable Sherlock Holmes story.
From Bowen’s point of view, at least going by the adaptation, Wilder is the real criminal. Whereas Holmes seems primarily concerned with making sure that Heidegger’s murderer swings for it, Bowen is much less interested in the murder of the adult than in the abduction of the child. Wilder is shown manhandling and terrorizing Arthur as he drags him out of the inn; Watson gives chase, but can’t find him; and this leads to an actual search mob armed
…by the utterly ridiculous sight of a grown man swinging through the tree branches and howling like a gibbon.
As written, this is a young, healthy, man in the prime of life and at the beginning of his career making an imaginative effort to empathize with a “poor, helpless worm” whose condition he sees as very different from his own. He sees himself as taking pity on a weaker, more vulnerable creature; and though he acknowledges that he
Back in Baker Street at the conclusion of their investigation, Holmes subtly warns Watson that he might want to leave this one out of the chronicles. “A chaotic case, my dear Watson,“ he says. "It will not be possible for you to present in that compact form which is dear to your heart.” “Wisteria Lodge” is
So this is now our third dramatization of a story revolving around a woman who’s left some money that a man is trying to pry out of her. (“Solitary Cyclist” and “Speckled Band” are the others). And, as with the other two, this is really a story about how vulnerable Victorian women still are to male predation. And yet in each case, the client is valued and trusted by Holmes for her courage and her independent spirit. This is why I have always had so very little patience for Moffat’s bullshit about how
romance is very important to that novel; and when you take it out, a lot of what’s left behind is unappetizing. If you’re going to gut the romance, then you better come up with something to add that’s better. And unfortunately, Hawkesworth really doesn’t–although he does do something
"No, no," he said, embarrassed. "But there is something rather terrifyingly intimate, is there not, about confessing to another man that his words have touched you?"
And in how many fanfics…but no. No, in canon,Holmes calls on the Duke, manipulates him into writing out a check for the 6,000 pounds’ reward, and then tells the Duke the jig is up:
Now, comparing Gibson to the Buttercup In Chief is slightly unfair to Gibson in that Gibson can use the English language competently and has actually been successful in business. But Gibson is the same kind of rich asshole who thinks rules are for the little people, and who bullies even the people who are trying to help him. Also, he’s a sexual predator. The canon story includes a conversation about this which is, compared to the way these issues are handled in the earlier stories, pretty explicit. Holmes tells Gibson straight up that whatever he felt for Dunbar, he shouldn’t have told her about it, since she was “under his protection.” And here’s Gibson’s response:
Well, I would not say they made it better. They just made it weirder. This has to be one of the trippiest episodes ever.
And this takes me back to my original point. Holmes asks if Watson disapproves of the “happiness we have created” for Mary and Jack. “No, not in the least,” he says, earnestly. He’s happy enough to have helped Mary and Jack–because he and Holmes have their own happiness. He and Holmes haven’t been required by all this to give anything up; and the show treats their ‘happiness’–Holmes and Watson in 221b, relaxing by the fire as they discuss ethics and legal philosophy–as the keynote for the episode. Which, again, is a refreshing contrast to what happens in the second half of
Of course, this effect must be partly, and may be wholly, in the eye of the rewatcher, and is always more intense in hindsight. Certainly that goes double for me at this moment. I started this rewatch as a way of escaping from the real-world anxieties of the summer of 2017: the continued degradation of my country under a criminal and corrupt regime; the worsening climate crisis; my own chronic health issues; my wife’s cancer treatment. As I work through the series, though, I find that increasingly, instead of offering escape, what it really seems to be offering me is a way of confronting some of these same anxieties–including my fears about disease, decline, and death.
The adaptation brings her back; and this brings is to the Captain Crocker part of the episode. Naturally, Bowen decides to stage some of their romance, in order to give us a proper appreciation of his excellent qualities. Naturally, also, they stage his battle with Sir Eustace, which…I mean did I not BEG you, Granada, to keep the fight scenes to a minimum? Was all that jumping up on the dining room table NECESSARY? I’m not as easily moved by heterosexual romance as I once was, but they do a fine job with that part of it. I was more taken by their dramatization of Holmes’s visit to the shipping company’s office, where what could have been some more boring-ass exposition is turned into kind of a charming little vignette in which Holmes copes with the useful but rather annoying fact that the shipping clerk guy is a huge Sherlock Holmes fanboy. Holmes is already worrying about what he’s going to do with the information he’s about to get (this is rather crudely telegraphed by Holmes toying with a chess set sitting out in the shipping office) and has no time for the clerk’s fanning or Watson’s appreciation of it. These little touches make a lot of difference to the feel of the final product.
This conversation felt so natural to me that I went back to look at the Doyle story because I suspected it was a modern invention. In fact, everything in this scene comes out of the canon story in one way or another–either from Watson’s narration (in which he notes that Holmes routinely went without food when hot on a case) or the dialogue, which has been slightly massaged in order to give Watson a slightly more active role. The “let’s go see what we can do” line, for instance, was taken out of one of Holmes’s speeches and given to Watson. And just by making those small changes, Harris turns this scene into one of the best glimpses we get of the heart of this relationship.
I’m not trying to get Zen about this; but the long solitary walks, the “meditations,” the hours spent communing with the weird death-laden landscape they’re in–all of this is new. Up to this point, he’s only ever sat still while either listening to music or smoking his way to the solution to a tricky case. This is him learning to treat himself as just as important and interesting as other people’s problems. Pouring out the vial and burying the syringe stands in for the renunciation of a way of being that he now understands is destructive both to himself
’s “The Final Problem” drags “The Musgrave Ritual” into the whole Eurus mess. Every adapter has to read “The Musgrave Ritual,” because the opening paragraph establishes many of what have become canon details about the 221b sitting room (the Persian slipper, the V.R. in bullet holes, the jackknife on the mantelpiece). But it seems obvious to me now that the Granada adaptation of “Musgrave,” and especially those final moments, must have made a much deeper impression on Gatiss than the actual story. Water plays a much more important role in the adaptation, not only because of the staging of Rachel’s death but because in the adaptation, one of the locations has to be reached by boat. Now, unfortunately I don’t know how to make GIFs, but let me tell you about the way they transition into the Great Dinghy Journey, because this is the
That’s how I felt about “The Resident Patient.” Marlowe restricts himself to canon in this one–at least more so than in “Greek Interpreter”–but it feels like this was not so much out of respect as just that he couldn’t be bothered. Trevelyan’s voiceover is used to convey things that direct action could have made more interesting. There’s absolutely no attempt to individuate the members of the Worthington bank gang; instead of writing some dialogue for the ‘trial’ of Blessington/Sutton, which might have given us more of an interest in the outcome, Marlowe focuses on the horror of the actual killing. The flashback to the bank robbery honestly looks as if they did the first take without rehearsal, then said fuck it, let’s keep it. The extra playing the bank guy who gets shot isn’t even really trying.
From that moment on, both of our boys have the scent in their nostrils and are on the trail, and it’s beautiful to watch. The way they both sit there greedily staring at Mr. Henry Baker, hoping he’ll turn out to be the most dangerous jewel thief in London, is a master class in reactions all by itself:
’s central African origins; we do hear the occasional bit of drumming in the soundtrack, but we don’t have to submit to anything like the festival of stereotypes that opens “Six Napoleons.” The lethal horror induced by the drug is instead referred back to the one fear that drives all others–death–and its close companion, loss.
And then of course, paper so often serves as an intermediary between Holmes and Watson–as a kind of indirect caress. You could base an entire drinking game around the number of times that one of them will pick up a document, read it, and then hand it to the other one to get his opinion. At times this move becomes, IMHO, unambiguously flirtatious:
The most interesting relationship in this episode, instead, is Holmes and Langdale Pike. It’s with Pike that Holmes plays his deduction game (it’s nice to see some deduction actually happening, even though it doesn’t affect the plot; it’s been a long time). Pike looks and acts like Sir Harry Wotton from
…is try to throw it over the standing mirror that has sprouted over there by the doorway. He misses, and the thing drops to the floor. He then gets an armful of scarves and starts draping them over the mirror, almost completely covering it up, and finally picks up the gown from the floor and drapes it over the scarves, completely obscuring the mirror from view. TRY SHOOTING MY REFLECTION NOW, HAMMOND!
I may as well observe in passing that it really seems to me as if Hawkesworth is really pushing the envelope when it comes to coding this relationship. Hardwicke’s most animated moment comes after Holmes asks if he can crash on Watson’s examination table for a few hours, and Watson cries, “My BEDROOM is at your disposal!” This is not ACD canon. Neither is Holmes’s line about how he was so excited about the prospect of seeing Watson again that he couldn’t sleep. In canon, they just have dinner and spend the next three hours catching up. In this episode, Holmes falls asleep in Watson’s consulting room and Watson tenderly tucks a blanket around him. There’s also this weird little moment at the empty house when Holmes gets overexcited and yells “YOU’RE MY TIGER!” at Moran. Watson puts a hand on his shoulder, like, easy there tiger, and Holmes smacks it away in a state of high excitement. Makes you wonder what games they’re going to be playing back at 221b after the champagne is gone and Mrs. Hudson has retired.
, but even without that, it would be a pretty simple deduction. Holmes appears in this episode for maybe three minutes, including voiceovers. At the beginning of the episode, he invents a mysterious case that requires him to disappear to the Scottish highlands. He tells Watson not to worry, he’ll be watching him “with my third eye.” Holmes doesn’t appear at all until the very end of the episode, and even then he’s a ghost in Mycroft’s mind. It is as if Holmes has died and is watching over the efforts of his proteges like the ghost of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Mycroft and Watson do all the detecting–each is working on his own case, until they discover that they’re actually two parts of the same case–and I have to say, it wouldn’t necessarily have to have been a terrible idea to have one episode where Sidekicks Are Doing It For Themselves and the lead gets the week off.
show us a Holmes/Watson relationship which is much more intimate, and much more central to both of their lives, than in earlier volumes. Hawkesworth seems to have wanted the whole first series to have that
Violet and I go back, in fact, about 35 years, to when I was 12 or 13 and my father brought home a giant two-volume copy of William S. Baring-Gould’s
poor people have for remaining poor? Why don’t they all brush up their act, engage in witty repartee, entertain the gentry, and get rich like him? And then there’s the fact that “Hugh Boone” gives himself fake disabilities in order to pry more pity and therefore more money out of passersby, which provides support for the claims made then (and still made now) that the poor either counterfeited or intentionally courted disabilities in order to prey on the sensibilities of the middle class. Through Neville St. Clair, the act of asking people richer than you to spare some of their cash is presented as fraud. And this is before we get to what’s going on with the opium den.
go back to its legal owner. The novel believes in the curse enough to want the thing far away from all the people who get a happy ending. By locking it up in his drawer, Holmes is doing what Collins gets the plot to do at the end of
And then, his image starts drifting forward, obviously separating from the background. This is very confusing, because Holmes himself doesn’t appear to be moving; it’s as if he’s become detached from his environment and is just floating toward you. At the same time, he’s descending through the bottom of the frame:
I stuffed the letter and the report into a pigeon-hole in my writing desk, and went to work on tidying and decorating the sitting room. I had, I fear, entirely lost my Christmas spirit. It did not return, even when I had succeeded in snaking that extravagant garland over, amongst, and around everything in the sitting room that abutted its walls--from the sideboard to the mantel to the tantalus and the gasogene. My time in the Army had given me a distaste for physical violence. I would have preferred it, for instance, if Holmes could have resolved Miss Sutherland's case without actually horsewhipping her stepfather--and not only because we then had the trouble of blackmailing him into dropping the charges. I cannot truthfully say that I have never resorted to fisticuffs at a moment of crisis. I can say, however, that until I met Sir George Burnville, I had never left the print of my knuckles on the face of a peer of the realm.
All that Christmas day--all through the visits and the carols and the dinner--I wore that crown. He wore it too. I saw it shining about his brow whenever I glanced at him, through our little throng of visitors. I saw it when Lestrade and Mycroft between them finally tore open the most recalcitrant of the Christmas crackers. I saw, in the tissue-paper coronet that Mrs. Hudson teased him into wearing, the phantom brilliance of all the gems he had never stolen. I saw it as we finally waved them all out the door, as the cabs rattled off down the street--the Phelpses, Miss Smith, the Lady Frances Carfax--even poor humble Sutherland, her face shining with pride in a job well done, basking in the praise she had not expected me to bestow upon her. I saw them all down the street and as I turned back to him I saw the crown, still gleaming about his temples. I look at him sleeping--my husband--and I see it still.
Holmes was already at my writing desk. "May I?" he said, gesturing toward the pigeonhole into which I had crammed the offending documents.
I guess I could just say: I know this feeling. I recognized it IMMEDIATELY. It is the feeling of someone who, say, has been in a relationship for 20 years and is suddenly offered the opportunity to make it legal. It’s the feeling of discovering, suddenly, that things
But Green isn’t the only man in this story who rides roughshod over Lady Frances’s autonomy. After all, in the canon story, at least someone connected with Lady Frances has asked Holmes to take the case. In Bowen’s script, nobody asks Holmes to intervene–not even Watson. Watson, who I will point out seems to be the only man Lady Frances knows who has ever respected her autonomy, has simply befriended her while on holiday and written to Holmes about her. It’s Holmes who decides, based on his silent games with his little figures and his perusal of the daily papers, that Lady Frances needs their help. Indeed, from an objective point of view, in the adaptation Lady Frances doesn’t “disappear;” she just leaves the hotel without telling anyone where she’s going. One imagines that if she had stuck around to see Holmes and Watson burst in on her and tell her she’s in mortal danger, she would have yelled at both of them to get out of her life too.
Mark Gatiss, Wikipedia tells me, was born in 1966, which makes him 3 years older than I am. He’d have been 18 in 1984 when the Granada series first aired, and 20 when this episode ran. He is obviously a diehard lifelong Holmes fan, and so obviously he watched this series.
This is a higher-stakes version of the crisis that the official French detective, G., comes to consult C. Auguste Dupin about in Poe’s “The Purloined Letter.” From
seems to have made. Watson’s misinterpretation of Holmes tapping out the rhythm of the violin piece they just heard shows up in “The Reichenbach Fall,” when Sherlock mistakenly thinks that Moriarty is tapping out the key code when it’s really Bach partita #1. The shlocky yet surreal opening segment kind of reminded a bit of the opening of “The Final Problem.” The byplay about Watson’s titles shows up again in John and Sherlock’s banter about John’s blog and why a story needs a title. There is also a mannequin dangling from the ceiling for one of the consultations in…is it “Hounds of Baskerville?“ I forget. I knew Moffat and Gatiss had to be Granada aficionados because there was so much aggressive Granada homaging in “The Abominable Bride.” Not really sure what to make of their evident special fondness for this particular episode, though.
In the course of this rewatch, I have found myself reaching for the phrase “this episode is uneven” pretty often. With Granada Holmes, there are a few episodes where it’s all good– “Blue Carbuncle,” “Speckled Band,” “Second Stain”–but there are a lot more episodes where you have to take the good with a certain amount of bad. So far, though, I can’t recall another episode that gives you the best and the worst that Granada Holmes had to offer in such close proximity. In the course of dramatizing Beppo’s backstory, there were so many, many terrible choices made. The first five minutes of this episode are so squirm-inducing you could well pull a muscle watching them. The squirming commences anew any time any of the Italian-speaking characters reappear for any reason whatsoever.
Moffat and Gatiss never did an episode based on this one, though they did incorporate Henry Baker’s hat into “The Empty Hearse.” There’s so much more they could have done with it, and which
movies. And I will admit that the opening tracking shot is actually, from a purely cinematic point of view, a lot more interesting than the camera work normally is on this show. But that really only makes the content more insulting. I cannot think of a single Italian stereotype this episode doesn’t hit on their way to 221B. We open with this completely gratuitous image of a sultry Italian woman passionately…washing herself:
’s incorporation of “Priory School” into “The Reichenbach Fall” as a later example of that same shift in focus from the adults to the children; and it becomes a major problem for Sherlock that he doesn’t perform the appropriate amount of concern for the kidnapped siblings when they find the abandoned chocolate factory. In their version, the murder and the kidnapping have been combined, and the adult victim has disappeared completely.
, though it was obviously written after “A Case of Identity”–and moving it to this point in the arc creates some weirdness. As written, “Red Headed League” is basically a comic story with some action thrown in at the end. The Granada episode, by introducing Moriarty, adds a kind of gravity to this story that it was never designed to bear.
Of course, Holmes isn’t talking about a case where the murderer had what is considered a material motive. Perhaps the reason this case unsettles him so much is that the motive seems nonsensical to him. Holmes, a connoisseur of the weird and the outre, stands baffled before one of the most common kinds of murder there is: a man killing a woman because she refuses to belong to him. It seems to Holmes, perhaps, as a crime which is peculiarly without an “object.” Jim Browder, miserable enough before the murders, is now suicidal and eager to end a nightmarish existence. His wife is no more within his grasp now than she was before. The one thing Browder *has* ‘accomplished’ by killing Mary (and, incidentally, her lover) is hurting Sarah Cushing–and he even fucked up that part by sending the package to the wrong sister. Does having stuck it to Sarah Cushing really compensate Browder for what his murders destroyed? It appears not. So no human object was served. As for the divine or providential object for which Holmes is searching…it’s bad enough if the world is “ruled by chance,” but WTF is ruling the world if whatever it is WANTS THIS?
but stealing world-famous public monuments is also a cliche supervillain thing to do. Moriarty stealing the Mona Lisa is basically the art theft equivalent of Gru stealing the moon.
: can I handle the casting change? Will I be able to embrace Edward Hardwicke after decades in which–in my head–Burke was the only Watson on this show?
So all the way through, this is a great episode in terms of performances. From Brett and Burke first and foremost; but also from the Horners, from the Countess of Morcar, from Mr. Henry Baker, from Peterson, from the landlord at the Alpha, from Breckenridge, even from Ryder’s sister the urban goose-farmer. There’s only one bone I have to pick with it really: what is up with Holmes and that blue carbuncle?
Anyway, the real tragedy of “Thor Bridge,” alas, is that Gibson doesn’t learn that lesson, at least not permanently. Holmes’s sparring, delicious as it is, is basically just a temporary inconvenience. Gibson ends the story with everything he wants: his wife is dead, Grace Dunbar is cleared, and the final shot of them driving back over Thor Bridge together certainly suggests they will “join forces. Alas. But at least we’ve got Holmes and Watson back, along with the only other romance that matters on this show: Jeremy Brett and paper.
In the canon story, Watson’s narration hints that Holmes’s vices may have had something to do with the health crisis that sends them out to the back end of Cornwall. Holmes has ground himself down with “constant hard work of a most exacting kind, aggravated, perhaps, by occasional indiscretions of his own.” Gary Hopkins, the screenwriter, takes this hint and runs with it, using this episode to resolve Holmes’s addiction storyline. But, as I’m going to argue, Holmes’s addiction is revealed, in this episode, to be a symptom of, or a metaphor for, something much deeper.
All right. So, in the ACD canon story, once Lady Hilda comes into the picture, there is a lot of byplay about Women. This is the story in which Holmes utters the fateful words, “The fair sex is your department, Watson.” Watson describes Hilda as possibly the most beautiful woman in London, and then Holmes goes off on how hard women are to read, because they’re so concerned about their appearance that they will skulk in the shadows and act guilty when in fact it may just be that they’re having a bad hair day. The adaptation keeps some of this; but it’s counteracted by the actress playing Lady Hilda, who either hadn’t read the canon story or had read it but decided she didn’t give a fuck. In the canon story, Lady Hilda is basically a hot mess; she’s always terrified, always on the verge of tears, always pale, and always doing a lot of Bad Acting to telegraph her guilt. Well, Patricia Hodge is having none of that. Her Lady Hilda has nerves of…well, maybe not steel exactly. Whalebone, maybe. At any rate, she comes into 221B swinging her class privilege left and right. She fences with Holmes instead of pleading with him. In her dealings with Eduardo Lucas, which are staged in the adaptation, she comes across as vulnerable but also intelligent, sophisticated, and willing to do some dirt if she decides it’s necessary. In other words, she’s a lot more like her husband the diplomat than he thinks she is. In her first interview with Holmes, she mentions that her husband won’t discuss politics with her, ever; in her last interview with him, right before Hope arrives, she tells him that she agreed to steal the Potentate’s Letter because she had no idea what it would mean–and she couldn’t have, because nobody’s ever wanted her to understand what her husband does or indeed politics in general. All that’s in canon. What’s not in canon is the speech Trelawney gives while embracing Hilda after he discovers (as he thinks) that the letter was in the box all along–in which he talks to her patronizingly about how of course she can’t possibly understand this because it’s politics, but she should just know that things have suddenly turned out really well. It makes the point that he, and all the men around him, have been underestimating her (and all the women like her) all their lives. Trelawney has no idea that his wife has not only stolen his precious document out of his box but witnessed a murder, done an unauthorized search of a crime scene, and bearded Holmes Himself in his den–or indeed that she has a) ever lied to him b) is lying to him now and c) plans to lie to him for the forseeable future. Hilda and Trelawney go back into their happy marriage which is now full of forbidden secrets–all of which Hilda knows, and none of which Trelawney knows.
This episode also had a good director, and it really shows. Madden went on to make feature films, and you can see a lot of care and attention and creativity that went into shooting this which was just completely absent in HOB. I particularly love what he did with the fight in the bank–and I love the cut from Holmes turning around with a stricken look on his face as Lady Frances Carfax disappears AGAIN to this shot right here of these two lunkheads sitting silent and ashamed in 221B while Holmes tries–to borrow a phrase made immortal by @lyndsayfaye–to ‘murder them with his eyeballs.’
), which makes sense. So that’s a nice little bonus. In this case, it’s Jane, the maid who has witnessed Barclay’s abusive behavior toward his wife without being able to do anything about it, and who (in the opening scene) is obviously afraid that Barclay is hitting her behind that locked door. This is another addition–the story implies that Barclay had moods and was occasionally troubled by remorse, but it doesn’t suggest that this affected their marriage–and it generates interest and sympathy for the non-recurring characters more effectively than Doyle’s mutiny romance does.
I say this partly because, while delivering the line “Gentleman of the jury,” Brett separates the first word quite deliberately into “gentle man.” We find out later that Watson actually has some serious reservations about what Holmes is asking him to do here (among other things, he’s now an accessory to whatever felonies Holmes is committing tonight). But he can’t resist Holmes’s appeal here to the Watson only he knows–the “gentle man” who’s been with him all these years, who’s taken him back after the Fall, and who can’t help responding to his touch. I mean after all, this is how poor Watson’s day began:
All right, let’s get the bad out of the way first: whoever devised the opening sequence of this episode should have been sacked immediately. I know it was the 1980s and everyone was really excited about the
episode, in which Mulder and Scully undertake an investigation which requires them to navigate a close-knit immigrant community with a Strange And Alien Culture, often with the help of a lower-ranking FBI agent or cop who’s from that culture and serves as their informant ( “Shapes,” “Hell Money,” “El Mondo Gira,” etc.). That’s basically the approach that Lestrade takes, both here and in the canon story: there’s an Inspector Hill who apparently specializes in policing London’s Italian quarter, and he’s responsible for identifying Pietro’s body and providing Lestrade with most of his wins. Holmes, who doesn’t have access to all this information, decides instead to follow the busts, and this turns out to do a better job of predicting Beppo’s next move. My point is, the adaptation elaborates on the Italian characters but it never really escapes the Doyle story’s assumption that Italian immigrants in London are both uncontrollably violent, possibly mad, and neck-deep in crime. It is almost as if Doyle were listening to Trump’s speeches when he came up with this plot.
It all adds up to a pretty entertaining experience, though you wouldn’t put it on par with, say, “Blue Carbuncle” or “Second Stain” or even “Speckled Band.” “Thor Bridge” is just not a great story, and the solution has a number of problems, all of which are unfortunately visible in Holmes’s reconstruction at the end:
So this means the following: 1) Holmes now recognizes the experience of watching your partner die as lethally terrifying. 2) This tells you something about how terrifying the prospect of Watson’s death is to him. 3) It also tells you something about how terrified he is of his own feelings about the fact that he inflicted this unspeakable horror on the person he loves most.
Behind the cut tag, I will of course be talking about our two favorite people; but I am also going to spend some time on Natasha Richardson and Violet Hunter, one of the Remarkable Women of ACD Canon. Because Violet and I go way back; and because “The Copper Beeches” is yet another ACD story where the actual mystery is just the tip of the creepiness iceberg.
So, this is all very dramatic (though the fall to the death is not well staged). And I sympathize with Bowen’s feeling that none of the adults in this story are thinking enough about Arthur. What I object to is that in order to avoid having Holmes let the Duke off the hook, Bowen lets the Duke off the hook himself. In Bowen’s adaptation, the Duke is never in on it; he doesn’t go to the inn, nor allow Wilder to let Ruben Hayes escape, nor promise to leave Arthur at the inn for three days so the police don’t find out where Arthur’s been and go after Hayes. These are all things that Holmes quite rightly roasts the Duke for during their final confrontation in Doyle’s story; and I’m sorry to lose that. Instead, Holmes winds up befriending the Duke, listening sympathetically when he opens up about his first love, and giving the Duke the chance to make it right by ordering the search party. So the Duke still gets off; we just don’t have to blame Holmes for it any more. The Duke also STILL writes Holmes a huge check; but now it’s out of gratitude for Holmes helping him See The Light, rather than as a bribe.
"About your story," Holmes said, at last, as we lay together by the fire. "I have only one complaint to make."
However. Regardless, the plot of Doyle’s “Creeping Man” is, God forgive me for what I am about do here, bananas. Well, perhaps I should say that it’s bananas for the mystery genre. In the world of comic superheroes, sure, the idea that being injected with serum from an animal will make you act like that animal would totally fly. In fantasy and horror, also. But Holmes practices the
But the most interesting thing to me about this is the change made to the impersonation plot. In order to prepare us for what is potentially a highly irregular/corrupt ending–we don’t find out for sure what Holmes does about going to the police, but we do find out that both Watson and Mrs. Hudson profited from the fact that Shoscombe Prince was able to run in the race after all–Paul takes the time to establish that Sir Robert does actually really love his sister and feels real grief over her death. We also know he’s carrying on with his sister’s maid Carrie. In the canon story, Lady Beatrice is impersonated by an older man, an actor who’s married, if memory serves, to Carrie. In the adaptation, they handle this very differently. Early in the episode, a young lad comes by to ask Sir Robert for work in the stables:
And straight up, I will say that at this point Brett’s performance is deteriorating, and that’s tragic. It isn’t just that both the ethereal beauty that belonged to him in his youth and the chiseled features of his early middle age have deserted him. The things that are going wrong–the exaggerations, the oversold high points, the jerkiness of the physical movements–are not volitional, and I guess this is something I want people to understand. An actor’s instrument is his body, and you can’t get a good performance out of a broken instrument. It isn’t just age. Brett doesn’t have the control he used to have over his voice because his breathing is now unreliable. His face has lost some expressivity because of the bloating and because they are now making him up more heavily in an apparent effort to camouflage his illness. (In several scenes his lipliner is visible, even in the low-res version of this that I’m watching.) What’s hard about watching him in this episode (and, I imagine, in the rest of the “Memoirs” episodes) is that you can still see the outlines of all the gestures, tones of voice, etc. that made his Holmes so indelible. Brett’s intentions are the same, but he can no longer control the execution, and nuance is more and more out of reach.
So…all in all, you know, there’s some cute Holmes/Watson stuff in this one and a decent heroine and some work for Rosalie Williams and it’s not all bad…but Neville St. Clair’s “people don’t expect beggars to quote Shakespeare” shtick REALLY annoys me, the gratuitous Orientalism annoys me even more and…I mean that’s a SPONGE, man, am I seriously supposed to be scared of that?
The garland slithered from my hands onto the hearth-rug. I stood quite still for several moments. Finally, since Holmes was out, it was I who had to tell myself that I was making an error of logic. Because Mary had been in the habit of writing her love letters to me on lilac note-paper, it did not follow therefrom that anything written on lilac note-paper was a love letter from Mary.
The GIF slows that down; at normal speed it’s less seductive and more comic (I love the way he leaves, then pops back in to nag him some more: “Get your clothes and come!”). But anyway…here, I guess, is my point. Sure, Granada always shows them in separate beds, and in other ways refuses to Make It Canon. But Granada never pretends, even for a moment, that Holmes is heterosexual. Everything he does for Mary Fraser and John Crocker in this episode is done
* Once at the Copper Beeches, Violet searches the place (discovering Alice’s coil of hair and the inhabitant of the locked-up wing of the house), uses the mirror trick to figure out what’s behind her when she’s sitting in front of the window, and in general gets so close to uncovering the secret that Rucastle threatens to feed her to the mastiff if she doesn’t STOP investigating.
At the end of the day, well, this episode doesn’t make spring bloom again for me; but it’s entertaining, and certainly it’s a big improvement on the canon story. I love the final scene in 221B, with Holmes getting in his digs about Watson’s gambling and then finding out that Mrs. Hudson plays the ponies too. Basically, after
I’m going to talk about Hammond’s thing with mirrors. And though I don’t plan to talk about Sherlock much in this one, my exposure to Sherlock does make me more interested in the question Hammond and his mirrors raise in “Wisteria Lodge”: When is a motif a symbol, and when is it just a trick? In other words, as the viewer, can we really tell the difference between something intended to create meaning, and something the director just happens to think is a cool effect? And does it really matter?
have been, on some probably unconscious level, about the production team processing their feelings about Brett’s own mental illness. What’s frustrating is that this could have been quite a compelling story; and every once in a while, as I said, some of its potential will be realized for a few fleeting moments. But it seems to me as if everyone behind the scenes who was involved in
we know both that Doyle read Poe’s detective stories and that he was very concerned to differentiate Sherlock Holmes from Dupin. The influence is undeniable, however. You know how Holmes is always complaining to Watson that he’s turning their cases into sensational tales instead of mini-monographs on the science of deduction? Well, if Watson ever listened to Holmes’s writing advice, all of Watson’s stories would come out like “The Purloined Letter.” There is a juicy story in there–a nefarious minister steals a sensitive letter from a royal personage via a brilliant but simple and daring stratagem, then immediately begins blackmailing her with it–but Poe is more concerned with letting Dupin discuss philosophy, mathematics, and the art of reasoning with his unnamed narrator friend. The Big Idea in “The Purloined Letter” is that in order to outwit a criminal, you have to adjust your own intellect to the level of said criminal. If you can’t make yourself either smart enough or stupid enough to think the way he does, you don’t win the game. Dupin gets the letter because he realizes that the nefarious Minister has had the simple, bold, brilliant idea of hiding the letter in plain sight. G. the official detective laughs his ass off at first when Dupin suggests that he might be failing because the case is too simple; but he’s pretty stoked when Dupin trades him the letter for a cheque for 50,000 francs.
iest bit of cinematography that I have yet seen on this show. We start with Holmes standing, apparently, on the grounds:
All of this is set up in the opening scene, which contains the famous “you do not propose to invest in South African securities” deductive riff. What I love about this is how playful they both are. Holmes is showing off a bit, but he’s not trying to score off Watson; he’s just enjoying his little demonstration, and perhaps enjoying even more the fact that Watson reacts exactly as he initially predicted. But Watson’s got game of his own:
’s Marian Halcombe, one of the best female characters to come out of sensation fiction and a fearless unofficial detective even in the face of the machinations of the evil Count Fosco.
So I can sort of get down with the anachronisms and the tonal contrasts created by crossing “Red Headed League” with “Final Problem.” In some ways, the forced union of these two plots works less well. Athelney Jones’s role in all this, for instance, is pretty incoherent. Holmes refers to him as “an absolute imbecile in his profession,” which based on Jones’s role in
"--just as they already believe that the black pearl of the Borgias is rolling about somewhere amongst my beakers and pipettes and that the King of Bohemia is sending me an emerald a day. Why do you do it, Watson?" he said, sitting up in order to better provoke me. "Is it the clue to some deep-laid mystery? Is it a code? Do you secretly desire to be stolen? Shall I come upon you unawares some dark and stormy night, and slip you into my pocket, and spirit you away, and lock you up in my museum?"
But then, I thought, I never liked “Musgrave Ritual” either; let’s see if they can make something of this one.
The camerawork is enhanced by the music, which is a retro version of the show theme in which the violin struggles to ascend against a descending and dirge-like bass line that contributes to the sinking effect. So someone
This story was adapted by Derek Marlowe, who appears to have been under the impression that his name should have been Philip Marlowe. The first half is quite entertaining, even endearing, in classic Granada Holmes style. Then, Marlowe runs out of story, and fills out the rest of the hour with a hardboiled detective AU involving a chase on a train, guns, extrajudicial murder, and a femme fatale. “You still retain your low opinion of women,” says Mycroft to Sherlock, after the case wraps up. No, Mycroft; no, he doesn’t. I hate to be the one to break it to you…but that man you’re talking to isn’t really your brother.
So this sends, I would say, a pretty clear message. Holmes is sympathetic to Mary despite her lying, as he was to Helen Stoner and the two Violets. The fact that he invites her to the resolution shows he has a higher opinion of her in the adaptation than he does in canon. But he most definitely DOES NOT WANT her to touch him. By contrast, Holmes not only touches Watson during this scene, but seems to be using touch to persuade Watson to go along with him during the ‘trial’:
In the canon story, of course, everything is from Watson’s point of view. So during the experiment, we get Watson’s interiority, but not Holmes’s. In an adaptation, you want to be able to deliver *more* than the original text does; and this episode attempts that by going into Holmes’s head and giving us
And the bottom line here is, I suppose, that the 1857 mutiny in and of itself is just not as interesting to me as it was to Doyle’s contemporaries. It was certainly a huge deal for Doyle and his audiences, who even a generation later were still worrying about how long they’d be able to hold their imperial possessions. Doyle seems to have been especially anxious about this. Watson’s military history in
"They are like you," I repeated. "You have a...an affinity. And once you and a jewel have found each other...I hate to part you."
Most interesting to me, however, is how this episode handles the confrontation with Crocker. It plays out according to canon (with some emendations to some of the now-embarrassing dialogue) for a while…and then Mary shows up.
The good old canon can still surprise you. The absolute best thing about either the canon or the Granada “Red Circle” is the landlady bonding between Mrs. Hudson and Mrs. Warren, Holmes’s initial client. Mrs. Warren has a tenant whose conduct she finds so grievous that she needs to call in a detective to help her deal with it; every time she mentions one of her tenant’s crimes, Holmes basically says, listen, I do the same thing only worse, why don’t you go home and be glad you’re not MY landlady. But Mrs. Hudson’s solidarity is not to be shaken, and Mrs. Warren eventually gets Holmes’s attention. Then, when Mrs. Warren gets overexcited and is in danger of hysterics, Holmes comes around behind her and puts his hands on her shoulders and gives them a little squeeze…and she calms down. I saw that and thought, “What, is that a yoga move?” But I turned to the canon story, and lo:
I was seated in my old armchair by a crackling fire, reading an evening paper and smoking myself into a better state of mind, when I heard Holmes's footstep on the stair. I heard him come in, but did not look up from the sensational item I was reading. It is a little luxury that I sometimes allow myself to savor: taking him for granted. He took just as little notice of me; it was the twelve feet of evergreen that commanded his attention. I heard him lift his pipe from its rest upon the mantel, and shake a handful of tobacco out of the Persian slipper. He tamped the tobacco down and searched for matches in the litter on the mantel. Not finding any, he took up a loose sheet of writing paper and began rolling it into a spill.
…but as I said, there isn’t a ton beneath the surface here. I was interested to see what I think is only our second shot of Holmes’s bedroom, which seems like a very cramped, lonely, and probably usually totally smoke-filled space; no wonder they spend most of their time in the common room. Speaking of which, this show always gives me serious breakfast envy. Watson evidently eats enough breakfast for about six people. Holmes, on the other hand, has basically never been shown eating on camera, and he refuses food at Colonel Ross’s too. I don’t know whether this is an adaptation thing or an acting choices thing or what. Does it say somewhere in the show bible that Holmes must never be shown ingesting food? Is that because he’s the Queen?
In other words: Holmes finally gets it. He’s experiencing what it was like to be Watson during those three years, and he’s fucking terrified by it. And that’s going to change everything.
, the phrase “the stained dress” is repeated almost as often as it is in the Starr Report, and it points out all the ways in which the theft of the Moonstone from Rachel’s bedroom in the dead of night becomes a threat to Rachel’s reputation and ‘purity.’ Rachel is, for a while, the chief suspect in the theft of her own diamond, and…OK, I’ll stop there. My point is, the word “stain” has Connotations, especially in the context of a woman’s ‘honor’ or ‘virtue,’ which in this era were synonymous–for women–with sexual fidelity and chastity. Lady Hilda, in order to defend herself against the stain that her own letter would leave on her ‘honor,’ gets herself involved in a bloody business that threatens to leave an even
of who he is and what he does. Nor did he ever expect that Lestrade would invite him to go down to Scotland Yard and have Lestrade’s brethren “shake him by the hand,” thus
Below the cut tag I’m going to talk mainly about the consequences of using “The Red Headed League” as a vehicle for introducing Moriarty. And also, of course, the many delightful moments it provides for our next-to-last look at the Brett and Burke team.
Of course it really starts long before that. But Watson, as we know, has never been able to get Holmes to do anything he REALLY doesn’t want to do. The cocaine use is the prime example of that. So as much as he bitches about it, the fact that Holmes agreed to go on this holiday indicates that he really does take the doctor’s advice seriously, and that he really is starting to worry about his own health. Almost as soon as they get out to their remote cottage, of course, Holmes breaks out the seven percent solution. But although we’ve seen plenty of other scenes where Watson catches Holmes using, this one is really different. First, we’ve never actually seen Holmes in the act of shooting up before. He’s always either looking at the syringe and thinking about it, or just rolling down his sleeve and putting the paraphernalia away as Watson walks in. This time, we watch him tying off and trying to raise the vein, and we can see how agitated and desperate he is. We also see him rather pathetically trying to conceal all of this from Watson–and that’s also new. In the earlier episodes, when Watson walks in on him after he’s done the deed, Holmes’s typical response to Watson’s silent reproach is a brazen stare with which Holmes basically dares Watson to comment on it. This is the first time Holmes has betrayed any shame or guilt over using cocaine. And again, that’s got to be because he’s starting to think about the possible consequences.
