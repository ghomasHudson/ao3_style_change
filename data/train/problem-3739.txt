“Ten points to Gryffindor.” Dean’s voice is diminished, chopped up at the roots. “Don’t let Sammy know I said that.”
Tracy graduated – she invited Dean and Cas to her graduation, which still felt majorly weird, but they clapped loud and hard for her anyway – and she’s working there now, too. Claire volunteers so many hours that Jody kept trying to tell her to get some damn sleep and
“You can join me here,” Cas repeats. “Or you can wander on ahead and I will find you later.” Sure, Cas is giving him the choice, but Dean looks down at the guy and his face is set in obvious disapproval of the latter option.
The night’s quiet. Dean only has so long. He told Sam he was going out to buy a six-pack, but they’re in the middle of nowhere, Kentucky. Sam’s not stupid, he must have known it was bullshit.
Gabriel and Kali’s reception is in one huge tent, tall enough that it towers over Rufus’ Avalugg by what has to be three times its height. Any possible awkwardness that could have come out of the guest list dissipates, turning into the biggest, loudest party Dean’s ever been to. He’s getting too old for this shit, but Gabe keeps running around screaming at people that they’re not having a sufficient amount of fun, so fuck it. Dean’s gonna have fun.
by the guy. He’s got a good voice, bumpy and soothing at the same time, but it’s not grabbing as much of Dean’s attention as it normally would if it was something whispered in his ear at a bar, because of the guy’s gaze. Even in the dark, it’s obvious. There’s something in the way he looks at him that Dean finds himself getting dizzy on, and he’s pretty sure it’s not just leftover adrenaline and terror from the fight. That gaze runs warm and
Later, Dean’s in one of the Cubone enclosures, trying to scoop up one of the most particularly squirmy Cubone in the entire nursery. “Let me help,” Cas says, appearing out of goddamn nowhere. “I know this one can be difficult.” Dean wants to brush him off, but then he’s got Cas’ wide, lovely hands supporting his arms, and he can’t shoo the guy away.
For a while, Dean’s gigantic bitch of a brother practically locks them in the cabin while he runs off on missions. “
Wordlessly, they follow Naomi into the large, cozy-looking farmhouse near the entrance to the reserve. Inside, the place is decorated with gorgeous mahogany and ornately carved chairs. Fancy as it is, Dean can see the nicks on the wood here and there. Everything in this case was carved by hand, and he can respect that.
Dean doesn’t know what spurs him to push on. But he does anyway, because if he’s ever been good at one fucking thing, it’s obstinance. “Look, uh, Castiel. This ain’t fair. At all. To either one of us.”
Dean doesn’t like colleges. They remind him of everything his life doesn’t have. Never had, in some cases. He hustles past the campus when he walks by.
at the loss of it, but then Cas more or less flops against his side, boneless and relaxed. Dean feels stupidly awed when he loops a hand around his shoulder and moves them together.
being the normal one by sitting all stock-still in the creepy dirt, and Dean is just an overly picky weirdo. “If you’d like to, you can join me.”
Cas stays quiet. But he smiles at Dean, and that’s enough to answer the question. “We should check on the Wynaut.”
It’s just fucking bizarre. Brave new world, indeed, being BFF with things he’d rather be spraying in the face with a salt gun. Saving people, hunting things, teaming up with other things to stop the worse things. Weird shit happens when you gotta save the world.
Even now that he can’t get any closer, Dean thinks about running away. Throwing the key into the harbor the next time he goes out there and forgetting about the entire goddamn thing. But – that would be stupid. More than that, it would be cowardly.
“It’s nothing like that. This one isn’t about Castiel,” she says, at last. Her tone is measured, and clearly thought-out. “It’s about you. And your family.”
“Thanks for joining the party,” Cas bites back, smiling. When Dean’s hands find his chest and grab onto his hips, they’re so damn hot Dean’s surprised his fingers don’t come away branded
against Hydreigon’s stomach, and that’s it. Hydreigon lets out a pathetic wheeze, a noise something as majestic and powerful as a Hydreigon should never make.
horrifyingly enough, or he’s bald. He’s heavier, enough to have a double or triple chin, or he’s so gaunt his eyes practically sink into his skull. He’s very old, or a young child. In a few of them, he’s a chick. But it’s always him.
He’s taken to picking up rocks and turning them over and over in his palm, like flipping it exactly thirteen times is a very important part of the formula that’ll open some portal to get them back to Earth and Sam. Some giant creature lopes by every now and then, and it actually breaks up the boredom. (Dean’s beyond glad Cas is with him, of course, but at this point, Dean knows more than he thought was possible about bees, cats, fish, tadpoles, and flamingos.)
“I’m glad you’re here,” Dean admits. Sam’s face brightens quickly as someone snapping their fingers, and Dean can’t help but roll his eyes at it. “Alright, alright. Don’t get sappy on me.”
about you,” he says in this horribly cloying voice, Combee honey sticky but just all wrong. It takes every damn ounce of Dean’s courage to keep staring this asshole in the eye.
Espeon’s more than holding her own against the horde of crazy strong Dragon-types hounding her. Dean’s damn proud. As he watches, she sends a Salamence sprawling with a Psybeam, rainbow-colored and swirling within the cylindrical shape of the beam like an oil slick.
“Too risky, yeah.” Dean lets out a tremendous yawn, and slowly works his way out of bed. He brushes his teeth, because he’s meticulous about that anyway and Cas doesn’t deserve his awful morning breath, pulls a pair of jeans on, and heads out with Cas, Vaporeon, and Staraptor.
, which for Charlie probably involves eating Cheetos and alternatively tinkering with code and making out with Gilda for a couple of hours before she falls asleep with her phone practically glued to her cheek. So Dean’s the one who has to catch Cas up when they’ve both got some spare time, after Charlie’s left.
have. She swishes her tail in approval. He carefully moves aside the Zygarde statue – fucker’s heavy, definitely made of metal – and opens the book.
Staraptor swoops in, forehead crest bobbing up and down ferociously. Her claws outstretched, she latches on to Hydreigon’s vulnerable blue belly scales, and pummels her with her wings. Some of the feathers from Staraptor’s wings drift to the ground with the utter force of her movement.
Dean knows nothing about the man who saved him other than that he’s set these stupid, giddy sparks through him. Part of being John Winchester’s son is staying razor-edge sharp on the hunt, but Dean got too damn used to that life, until tonight.
“Don’t wanna imagine.” Victor leans over, briefly, to pat Mienshao on the calf. Whoever’s driving one of the vans ahead of them waves out the window, and the van starts moving toward the gray, buzzing city.
Dean lets himself stare at Cas for a very long time. Cas and him, they never stopped breaking the rules. They threw fate the middle finger time after time after time; the two of them are a lot of things, but destiny was never one of them. And yet there was always something drawing him to Cas, something that brought them back to each other over and over.
Dean thought maybe nostalgia and his weird sense of pride would lead him to conclude that Gordon’s training center was better than Naomi’s. Truth is, Gordon’s place was a damn mess. There were scorch marks all over the walls and floor and water-warped wood that no one had bothered to fix over the years. It’s a miracle it hadn’t been torn apart entirely by years of Pokemon fighting. Mats were strewn haphazardly; one time, Dean tried to lift one up only to get a blast of Stun Spore to the face.
Dean offers him his biggest smile, the one he knows is way too much, with all his teeth. “Nah, you don’t,” he says. The smile drops. “Look, I – I’m bringin’ you along because Flagstaff told me that she knows the basic details. And it’s gotta do with us.”
The wedding itself is stunning. Dean’s only seen these beaches in photographs before, but he’s been all the way across the Unova continent and he can’t remember seeing anywhere so gorgeous, so pristine. The water looks pretty from anywhere in Village Bridge, but here it’s a shade of azure that might as well have been plucked from the sky on a cloudless day. Lumineon and Horsea visibly flit about beneath its surface. The sand is bleached pale, and gleams in the sunlight. The path to the ceremony is lined with bushes bearing blonde and crimson blossoms.
“I didn’t like you at first,” Uriel says. Well, this family always was blunt. “But somehow I came – to trust you.”
“Dean is excellent company,” Cas responds, sounding bewildered, and if Dean has to smother a smile with the back of his hand he hopes no one notices.
“The one and only.” Maybe this conversation’s getting more interesting. Just that thought sends a stupid thrill alight through his body. Stupid traitor mind,
He’s right, because no Pokemon are actually in this particular store. There sure are some really horrifying displays involving them that he never wanted to think about existing, though; it’s gonna take him a while before he can look at an actual Machamp or Lopunny again, and there’s a booth in the back with a curtain drawn over it promoting simulations of Magnemite jolts and Ivysaur Vine Whips, though Dean’s not going anywhere near there.
“I knew it,” Dean says. His voice is halfway between a laugh dripping battery acid and a sigh. He can’t even be angry; he knows what isolation like this is like. Worst thing about the Mark was how it boxed him up inside his own mind. He was willing to get tossed into the Empty just to get out of solitary. After all that, he still put Castiel in a cell, chained him up and closed the door behind him. “I get it, man. Of everyone out there, I do. But you can’t do this. You just can’t.”
“I’m new to you,” Cas says, the amusement dropped. His hands skim up Dean’s sides, fingers catching lightly at the skin over his ribs, until he clutches both hands to his shoulders. “And that’s important.”
The clouds aren’t always there, and when they are Dean isn’t sure whether it’s a welcome distraction or just one more thing to worry about. Sometimes even there’s this roar from the sky, shaking the clouds until they vibrate, but Cas stands stock-still and
Cas shoots him a furrowed-brow glare in return as he hoists up four huge bags at once. Show-off. Well, at least Dean gets to see if Cas is interested in using that effortless strength later on, wherever they end up sleeping tonight. The thought of it makes him grin, and Cas’ glare softens into a questioning glance.
The rain’s drumming so loudly outside Dean can hear it from his room, which feels like it’s been stuffed inside a tin can. Thunder growls hard enough to shake the floor. When he casts a look at the clock, it reads
All of a sudden, he realizes that the rain isn’t falling on him. He’s been out here what’s gotta be fifteen minutes now, his jacket’s practically leaden with the weight of the water, and there’s paths of rainwater snaking their way around his boots – but none of it touches his skin.
“Well, from what we understand he’s at school in Johto right now, and he’d be under Johto’s police jurisdiction –” Dean doesn’t know which is worse, if Victor’s lying and can’t get in touch with him either, or if he’s telling the truth and it’s that easy for a stranger to get on the phone to Sam when Dean hasn’t talked to his own brother in a year – “So we can give this to you.”
“He doesn’t notice, Sam,” Cas intones, going to the fridge, opening it up, and starting to dump whatever he finds inside into his bag. Once, Cas used to use his grim determinism to tell Sam and Dean they had to get out of a town before they destroyed the whole damn thing, and everyone in it; now, he’s glowering at jars of pickles and old deli meat as he crams it into a backpack that he can’t carry like a normal person. “Let’s go?”
The next morning isn’t awkward. Dean wakes up first. Years ago, he remembers making a big deal about Cas watching over him in his sleep. Now, he keeps his eyes on Cas; all the lines on his face have been smoothed out while he snoozes. He wants to run a hand through Cas’ hair, bring him even closer to Dean, but he holds himself back for that one moment.
“Hey,” Kevin butts in, and it’s as much grumbling as Dean’s ever heard from the kid. “I said I wanted to come back.”
“A visit.” There’s a beat, and then Cas is close, so close that Dean wouldn’t be surprised if he tapped into his freaky Latios powers to move that fast. He slides one hand into Dean’s hair – and
. Of course he does. It never left his mind, curled in tightly among the other memories that mean the most to him.
Dean thought maybe these quiet moments would be different now, with the knowledge that Cas is something strange, something other. But they remain the same. Cas still smells like his weird woodsy soap, and he’s still got that little whorl of hair growing in by his ears. Dean could never touch him again, and it’d be a screaming hurt, but if they got to lie close to each other and Dean could see his face with the lights playing against it and they could talk just like this, it’d be alright.
He knows exactly what he expected, but he forces the thought out of his mind every time it pops up, unbidden.
“Bunch of protesters,” Dean grumbles. The group of students is starting to stream down past the cars and bus. The administrative buildings of Edlund are just past them; they’re probably headed that way. Out the window, Dean spies a Grovyle struggling to hold up a protest sign next to its own, and Dean’s not sure if that’s brilliant or just outright cruel. But he’ll guess this isn’t a protest over Pokemon labor.
His balls are tight against his body now, after only a few firm strokes. Proximity to Dean is very, very arousing. Dean stretches his arms, still sleeping, and Cas picks up his pace, panting hard –
Just the idea of it makes Dean’s head swim, and his mind fizzle. Comprehension’s beyond him at that moment. Cas’ Grace and his soul, sewn together, knotted up. Probably all tangled and fraying in pieces, but there. Might as well be steel in the threads keeping them all together.
, it’s not a place anyone would go to on vacation. It’s a freaking desert with a constant sandstorm. Most Pokemon can’t handle it for very long, either, save the Rock, Ground, and Steel-types with built-in resistances. Dean hasn’t even seen many pictures, because the sand wreaks absolute havoc on any and all photography equipment. What he has seen is gorgeous, sure, but it’s nothing but billowing sand and a sky right outta Cas’ baby blues. “The sand – well, it sucked, frankly.”
“Mom’s word is law,” Jo adds with a smile. “And if any of you are interested in working here like us stiffs…”
in their new place in Village Bridge. It’s not a tiny apartment like Dean is used to, and it’s not Cas’ bigger, fancier apartment either. Dean wants to laugh at himself for picking this place – Sam sure laughed his ass off when he saw it, Amy barely stifling her own laughter behind her hand – but it’s more or less a damn farmhouse.
Sam’s protests fall silent after that. He hazards another look at Castiel and gives him a cautious nod; Castiel doesn’t return it, of course. Their strange crew, Mary and Sam and their captive from another universe, they start walking to the house together.
Most of the angels were not as disdainful of humans as Uriel or Zachariah. They were jealous of humans, certainly, but they loved humanity blindly, for being their Father’s favorite. Castiel is growing dangerously close to Pride as he thinks this, but he realizes now that they had no idea. They loved humanity, but they wouldn’t dare let themselves stretch out under it on a ratty sofa, still smelling like permanent marker; they would scoff at the
And there were – yeah, Dean can admit there have been men throughout the years. Lots of them. At first, he used the excuse that he might as well make the best of hunting on his own; he wouldn’t have gotten the opportunity while hunting with Sam and certainly not with John. Then, he needed to make a couple of bucks. But ultimately, it was all about chasing his loneliness, and the warm strong bodies. Just the fantasy that for a night, he could – be himself, all of himself.
She offers her Pokemon a wobbly smile. Vulpix moves in to bump his head against both Charlie and Dean’s ankles, until Dean starts to feel accepted again. Vaporeon crawls closer too, keeping a careful distance until Vulpix thwacks her with a couple of his own tails, allowing her to lean against him. Vaporeon’s skin is undoubtedly wet and slippery, but Vulpix doesn’t seem to mind a bit.
“It is, mostly,” Ennis told him with a shrug, “but I lived in Unova ‘til I was twelve, and I always liked the idea. Pokemon that saw the absolute worst in people, but defended them anyway.”
, but it’s not like I can think about being with anyone else — like, Risa! I’d be all over that in any other situation, you know that,” and he winces because he remembers he
It wasn’t that. It was the closest Dean’ll ever come to saying to anyone not related to him that, at the end of the world, he needs Cas there too. That he wants Cas there, even. Cas knew he meant that, too, and didn’t try to draw it out of him, just smiled back softly. Dean saw Cas snap the arm of one of his brother’s vessels before absolutely ramming the guy with an angel blade, and he saw his lips tilt up and eyes look down in outright shy gratitude.
Then, he puts his hand on the shining yellow tear. Light, blinding like grace, swallows up his entire body until it turns into a beacon, bright enough to see from the road. Dean has to shield his eyes, but the light screams loud enough he sees it behind his eyelids. There’s a flash, and it’s enough to make him stagger backwards.
“I wanna go flying,” Dean whispers right into his ear. He feels the shiver in Cas’ body, and truth be told he’s already got a stir in his groin thanks to Cas’ stupid soap, but they’ll get to that when they get to it. “With you.”
“I really like you,” Dean says. His voice drags with sleep, but it’s still genuine. He can’t even keep his eyes all the way open, but at least he’s squinting, because seeing the mess of Cas’ hair and his sleepy eyes seems of paramount importance. “’First, I worried it was some hero-worship thing. What happened outside Shopping Mall Nine, even if you don’t – point is, that’s not why I like you. It’s just you. You’re stubborn and I love it. Sense of humor could kill someone, man. And you care, so damn much.”
Before it does, there’s a nudge at his elbow, and Cas is sitting next to him. He’s shed the coat for now, wearing his still-pristine scrubs under the olive overshirt Dean had pulled off and balled into a corner of Sam’s cabin. Dean is pretty sure he’s gonna burn all the shit he had with him in Purgatory, minus the fancy-ass knife, and the leather jacket that Cas hands over to him wordlessly.
His entire body’s a mess. He’s quivering, his hands can’t get a good grip on the sheets, Cas’ release is seeping down his leg, and he doesn’t care. He manages to claw his fingers into Cas’ hair, his head – his lips – going lower and lower –
“You’re intoxicated,” Castiel says. The feathers on his wings flick out. Dean stares at them openly. The wide black reach welcomes him; it mocks him.
. And it’s got a big yard, with big tall trees that cast cool shade over the entire reach of it and a pool for Staraptor and Vaporeon.
Sam turns back toward Mary. There’s a weight to his brows and stress lines etched deeply on the sides of his mouth. “How has he –”
“Yeah, you fucking like that.” Dean loves dirty talk, he does, but he’s never been too good at it. Make it so he can feel angel dick rutting up against his own, and it’s even worse. The dirty talk serves as nothing more than confirmation, anyway – like, huh, the angel of the Lord who blew up dinosaurs millions of years ago
“You killed Lucifer.” For the first time, Castiel stares at her, really stares. Mary tries not to cower from the fierce blue of his eyes, the firm set of his mouth. “A human killed Lucifer while an angel could not?”
Mostly, though, it’s an absolute swell of LARPers. Some of them are dressed like their Pokemon, others in a matching type, others as a totally unrelated Pokemon. Hundreds of Pokemon are represented, from Rayquaza – a woman dressed in a tiny emerald crop top and billowy pants, but most impressively sporting an enormous headpiece with ferocious-looking jaws even in cardboard, strips of long gold tissue paper streaming off it – to Patrat, where a group of teenagers put on glasses with red and yellow bug-eyed lenses and affixed round black noses and called it a day.
“Yes. Because I didn’t know what to do with my whole life out there in front of me, either. I knew I didn’t want to spend it without you.”
, messy dark hair and blue eyes so intense they made Dean take a stagger-step back when he first truly saw them, but it’s way more than his looks. It’s a
siblings like Cas and Hannah and Uriel, and no one else. And now you’re telling me my whole damn life was a lie? That it was only for
. He’s not some soulless warrior who’d leave him to neck with a vampire, or a version of his brother with ugly, bloody palms because he has to keep opening up that awful cut.
Dean picks up the conversation before the silence can settle too heavily again. “When Mom got back, we, uh. Kept the other Castiel in the dungeon. Didn’t know what else to do. We’ve been… talking to him, trying to get him to tell us anything.” Dean can sense Mary and Sam’s glances at him at the words
staring at each other. Honestly, Dean wants to applaud, because the guy’s not human but he’s getting a whole lot better with this humanity thing. Before Purgatory, Cas would’ve never left, not if they’d stood there for three hours. “I’ll be seeing you later, Sam, Dean.”
Other people passing by wasn’t that common, though, so it was mostly just the two of them stuck together. Even if he knew those stories were bullshit, Dean kept expecting the worst Drifloon or Haunter myths to come true, and him and Sam would vanish.
“Not gonna admit that was a good point.” Dean swings the car door open, grabs the weaponry he’s stored in the trunk, and tromps into the house. He opens the door and it swings off the top hinge.
“I told Sam it was worse than Hell. I – for me, it was true. Hell was Hell. I don’t like to talk about it. But what I remember was the pain. The fear. So much of it, until – until it was the only thing left. It was so easy to forget yourself. Solitary, though… I was alone. Only me in there. Nobody else. Just me and my thoughts and – so, every shitty memory of Hell,
“Dean.” Cas still has his hand on Dean’s arm. Dean’s terrified, but he can’t imagine moving away. “I know there were things you would have never said to me. I’m sorry I heard them without your consent.”
wasn’t popular at all in the regions with Pokemon, because magic doesn’t sell too well when people can take a stroll down the street and run into twenty creatures with unbelievable powers.
“Might as well get a bunch of stuff for camp,” Dean agrees, pulling some of the stuff off the pile to carry just so Cas doesn’t look so completely ridiculous. “And some new clothes for you,” he adds as they head off together. “Can’t wear… that… forever, you know?”
When Dean closes the gap between them again, it isn’t for the sake of getting any more old memories out of Cas. It’s because the two of them, together, are going to make some new ones.
,” Dean insists. Cas messed up, sure. Dean didn’t try and contact him for weeks, and when his brother dropped out of his life he didn’t try to get in touch with him for too long, either. They’ve all got shit to apologize for. Naomi’s got a mountain of it.
Right now, though, it’s just Dean and some of the people and Pokemon that he loves. They’re rewriting the book. It’s not perfect, because Dean physically feels the hollow where other people he loves are missing from his life, and the ones who are here can’t possibly write over what Dean’s already gone through. But when Dean looks out at the view, the lights of Opelucid and the smaller towns clustered around it beacons in the night, here is a good place to be.
At last, they finagle their way into a cop car. Dean blinks in surprise when the policeman driving the car turns out to be Victor, but Victor just smiles. “Thought I saw that redhead friend of yours at the station,” he says. “Figured you’d get into this kind of trouble, Winchester.” Mienshao’s sitting upright in the passenger seat, her head whipping back and forth whenever anyone talks in some attempt to follow the conversation.
He always had to be strong for Sammy, had it drilled into his mind since he was four years old. Letting someone else be strong for him is just — it’s a new thing that has to settle in, calm the constant churning thing inside him. He’s faced down the Devil; he’s just gotta let time take its toll here.
It ain’t the healthiest way in the world of coping, but Dean lets a big, relieved grin crack his face. “Absolutely.”
Her smile’s not as toothy this time, more serious, but it’s still there. Her expression’s almost impressed, something like pleasant surprise. “Me too.”
Then they’re kissing. They take in each other, desperate, and don’t stop. Until black rot pours into Dean’s mouth. He pulls back in horror, but it’s too late. Cas is falling to the ground like he’s in slow motion, the sweet heat, the
, Cas.” The sheepishness is gone now, replaced by flint in her words. “I told all of you I’m here for the future. I meant it.”
It was only Claire’s Noibat, little as he was, who flew to the skies with Staraptor. After only a few minutes, he couldn’t really keep up, so Staraptor swooped in and scooped him up on her back. Dean saw Cas and Claire leaning in toward each other and laughing at the sight together. For a minute, the swooping in his stomach became sheer fondness, as opposed to his breakfast threatning to vacate itself.
His feelings for people like Cassie and Lisa and Aaron are gone now, other than tiny flares of regret if he thinks about it for too long. But the feelings are gone because they never had time to take root.
Dean’s never gonna be friendly with Gordon. He thinks that other than Erika and Kubrick, Gordon doesn’t really do
, but he can’t, not when the look on Sam’s face is sympathy and not the terror of knowing the world in front of him could shatter into the cage like it has been for the past couple of months. Instead, Dean preoccupies himself by making a mess of his mouth by slobbering all over a burrito – what, it’s 10:30, that’s totally lunch time, and this is greasy and
“Hey, Cas. Uh, if you’re out there. I don’t know – don’t know if you are. But I’m not saying goodbye yet. I said you sucked at them but man, I’m worse. You can’t even imagine,” Dean says. “Look, I can barely keep track of what month it is. But I saw the date today. September 18. Four months since – since everything.
He’s getting used to the feeling of Cas’ hips pressed against his own, even through the thick fabric of Dean’s jeans and Cas’ coat. Dude’s got no sense of personal space, and the little nudges remind him that hey, yeah, there
Cas keeps his palms over Dean’s forearms. Even through Dean’s flannel, he’s so warm. “I’m not you, Dean. I never – I didn’t have the courage to choose freedom. When Jack showed me the perfect future, it was you, happy with your family. And I was –”
“Sam,” he greets, as he claps him on the back. Max is trying for steady, Sam can tell, but he hesitates just a bit before every movement. There’s a manic glint behind his eyes. “We all good?”
When they wake up, some time around one in the afternoon, they head over to Cas’ place. Cas makes Dean sandwiches, which Dean finds incredibly endearing considering Cas’ complete lack of skills involving anything kitchen-related.
She slips out of his grip and stands right in the way of the wave of poison. And then that purple poison gulps down Vaporeon.
Dean’s touched his bare skin before. His eyes were wide the whole time he carved the sigil into Castiel, but he did it. But it’s not the same, not when there’s so much humanity Castiel still struggles to process. There is sour beer on Dean’s breath and this time, the hand on his shoulder is something pulling him down. Castiel could tumble backwards onto this sofa if he wanted, easily.
It snows a few days later, heavy. Dean tried to stick around the hotter states during the wintertime when it was just him and Sammy out on the road — last thing he needed was the weather or the ice or salt tossed on the roads fucking with the Impala — so he hasn’t seen anything like this in a while. Everything’s white and still and creepy as hell.
Dean starts laughing, from his throat and gut. He laughs right against Cas’ lips, letting him swallow them right up. Cas gives him one of his questioning looks when they break apart; it’s kinda sexy, now that he’s naked. “No, it’s great, it’s just – I wanna do this every way.”
Dean gets it; he definitely relates. He thinks of the way he lived for months after Dad died and it looked like Sam was out of his life for good, and how he poured himself into designing with Bobby while hardly saying a word to him. How many blueprints were perfectly fine, only for Dean to tear them to shreds and leave them all across his apartment floor, because something was wrong, so fucking wrong.
Only since he was ten years old. At first it was fun, him and Sam and their Eevees and that moment of triumph whenever Dean’s Eevee got in a good hit against Sam’s. But then John started telling their Pokemon what to do, and there was scratching and biting involved, and rushing the Eevees to the Pokemon Center afterward. He remembers lots of sharp glances in those Pokemon Centers, confusion mixed with pity, and fuck that because he never needed either of those directed at him.
a pie if you put it in front of him, but the craving doesn’t stick in the back of his throat all hot and sweet.
“Truth be told, I don’t need her any more.” Lucas pulls out a knife from his belt. From this distance, Dean can’t make out the details other than that it’s silver and ornately carved, but the beauty of it doesn’t matter when he holds it right up to Hydreigon’s ribs, poking at them with it.
She considers not answering, but decides maybe she should try honesty from now on. Her façade got her what she was looking for, after all. “Can you tell I’m not – from here?”
And Abigail herself is – great. Amazing, really. Claire hates getting sappy, but she can’t really help it when she thinks of the way Abigail always goes by
“You can scare ‘em away,” Dean jokes, and when he looks over to Cas, the guy is grinning. He’s never seen a smile that wide on Cas’ face, and the thought of that sends a fierce fissure through Dean. Cas’ smile, his real smile, is wide and gummy and, Dean thinks, goddamn beautiful.
Dean slips the first part into Cas. His hole’s so puffy and pink as his kiss-swollen lips, but the first bead slides in easy, then the second. Carefully, he just rocks the toy, back and forth, not letting it slip out all the way but not going any deeper either.
“I need someone else to stay overnight with Cas,” Jody tells him, and even in her matter-of-fact voice, the words
Dean resolves, then and there, that he’s gonna get the hell over the stupid fear of flying he has. Those rattling jet engines on Mistralton planes are decades old and hundreds of miles away. He’s gonna go flying with Cas. And it’s going to be great.
The storage locker, with its now-busted door, lies at the edges of the city. Naomi’s training gym is a chrome gleam flanked by spotlights carving out its figure in the darkness. The brilliant white rectangle in the distance, off to the side of a long stretch of highway, must be Shopping Mall Nine.
Dean rolls onto his side to push their lips together again. It’s whisper-soft and short. “You have some damn good ideas. That – whatever you did to me back there. That was awesome. So I’m down for whatever you wanna do. Just –” He pointedly fights off a giant yawn – “maybe next time.”
He doesn’t get to sleep that night until the sun’s washing the sky pink. In his fitful dreams, he chases stars that wink blue and red and stay frustratingly out of reach. “Bein’ too literal,” Dean grumbles when he wakes up, tapping a finger to his temple. Poor Vaporeon’s been reduced to little more than incredibly concerned looks and cuddles up against his side. She’s doing a damn good job, the best she can.
Dean’s not sure what that’s implying. But he knows he doesn’t like it, doesn’t like what the words or Castiel’s tone do to his emotions. The tornado’s coming for him now, with no regard for what it’s leaving in its wake.
Tessa’s locked the door more than a couple of times when she’s been at work. When Dean asked her why, she answered, rather cheerfully, that calling the donors to the nursery all day would make anyone homicidal. Still, she’s clearly not in her office; the telltale signs of Absol scratching at the door, even nudging at it with his side-horn, are absent. It’s silent. Jody’s not here, either.
Castiel probably knows he’s coming, but Dean flicks on the light anyway. Sure enough, Dean gets blasted with a glare of blue fire and fury the second the lights click on. Most of the chains are off Castiel, though a couple of them still cross over his body. One handcuff is tight around his wrist. Good. Makes it a fair fight. Maybe.
, but it melts right into the sweetest noise Dean’s ever heard because a second later, a huge bird of prey comes soaring down. Even in the darkness, the Staraptor’s all crest and big puffy feathers in front, and as goddamn beautiful as she sounds.
For a while, he just kisses and kisses, stroking one hand down Cas’ thigh, keeping the other in his thick hair. They’ve been doing this for a year-plus, now, and Dean still loves the rubbery feel of Cas moaning against his neck, how it shoots everywhere on his own body.
“That’s me, as it turns out,” Chuck practically trills, even if his voice is much calmer than it had been before. “I Fell a long time ago. Guess I didn’t want to deal with Heaven’s crap any more. As the Apocalypse drew closer, I regained my memories and used them to cloak myself from anything angel-related; I was done with Heaven. They haven’t bothered me in…” He whistles. “Years. Still get visions, though.”
Sometimes Dean looks backwards and for just a second, it’s like the tree branches are fingers attached to greedy hands, coming out to get him and pull him into Purgatory, tear him apart until the human bits are just a lost shell and he’s all demon, or vampire, or the other dark shit he’s had inside him and got too close to becoming, some time or another —
Castiel is tempted to move his head in a gesture that would indicate confusion. But that gesture would likely move himself away from Dean, so he restrains. “I don’t know what you mean.” He certainly has an idea, but he’s misinterpreted humans before.
Sam — oh, God, it’s really Sam, no matter how much time has passed he’s alive and he’s maybe a little older and thank God the dork got a haircut, but it’s
It’s so much better, if that’s even possible, with his palm slick like this, and he has to clutch the door handle. He’s in a car, thinking about a man he barely knows, and it’s too good. His whole body races toward sweet orgasm, toes curling, neck and shoulders tight, throbbing everywhere.
“Now you have.” Ennis smiled. Turns out he was a part-time student, devoting the rest of his time to training at the police academy in Goldenrod. He was one of their top recruits, and the sketchy higher-ups at Carver took a
He slams his hand on the wall, activating the angel depowering symbol. Another little trick they picked up from the British Men of Letters. What those guys could have done to Cas sometimes rattles Dean to the bone, but of course, in the end, it didn’t fucking matter.
“I assume you’re not looking to infringe on Victor.” Cas brings him out of his trance. Thankfully, there’s some levity in his voice, though it’s an exhausted sort; it’s been a long few weeks. At this point, Dean’s been staring so long at the spot where she was that he’s left staring at a door, not Bela.
“He’s like a damn Magnemite,” Dean hisses to him, staunchly ignoring the fact that he keeps flicking his own eyes up to watch Cas. He doesn’t catch Cas looking back at him, but he’s always got this annoying feeling, like a wiggly tooth, that he just missed it. Staraptor doesn’t hide her constant and utterly withering glares toward Dean, but that’s how she looks at everyone.
He pauses, and the mention of Naomi’s name making Cas pause even in this form breaks Dean’s damn heart.
Cas actually just nods and moves off easily. Dean stands awkwardly for a couple of minutes in the middle of the coat section, looming above the drab colors, before he decides it’s probably a bad idea to just leave Castiel in the changing area with no one around.
One by one, the Swords of Justice head off into the woods not long after that. It’s where Mewtwo disappeared to; it’s where Drifblim went. The forest is only a few miles outside Opelucid, and the battlers and Giratina fell hundreds of trees. It still stretches, placid and dark, further than the eye can see.
Again, Dean is totally not grateful for Cas stepping in front of him, standing in between him and the evil little shit. Seeing Cas’ head-tilt from behind is kind of amusing. “He means well,” Cas tells him, twisting his neck to look at Dean. He’s closer than Dean thought, but maybe he should’ve figured that out by the way he feels Cas’ coat brush against his legs. It’s girly as shit, and the last thing he should be thinking of, but Dean hasn’t seen a sky as blue as Cas’ eyes in — time isn’t even a concept to him any more. The sky here is either light or dark, not blue.
Dean takes a couple of beats to swallow down his nervousness. “So, you think you’re gonna go with Anna?” He doesn’t know if he should be afraid of the answer. Dean’s stupidly tangled up in him, but in the end, Cas is his own damn person.
Marin’s still got her holster strapped to her thigh, but Dean honestly isn’t even mad when he sees it. He’s just happy enough that everyone made it out, and they even kicked some Leviathan ass along the way. They’re gonna find a way to help everyone stuck in this awful world, ‘cuz that’s what they do.
“Whoah, Cas, you can’t just strip in the kitchen –” Dean starts, choked off by half a laugh, but his voice fades as Castiel tugs the shirt out of his pants and opens it up. Castiel has seen so many flowers unfurl and bloom, then shrivel and fall off their stems, and it reminds him of this.
“You took on what could’ve been eternal torture for Sam to fix it, okay? He forgave you too. It’s —” He sputters over what to say. It’s not
(Cas had just stood and stared at them in the shop, and even though he’d made himself and Dean invisible, Dean was still stupidly embarrassed. “Hey, birdbrain,” he’d said, not unkindly, as Cas’ eyes traced the shot-through colored lines through the glass dildo. “Like a magpie with the shiny stuff, huh?”
“Always got your priorities right,” Dean returns cheerily. Now that he’s fully dressed, he turns to Cas. Even in beat-up old jeans and a t-shirt that Dean’s quite sure is one of his own, the neckline swooping down on him, he’s as damn gorgeous to Dean as he is lost in an orgasm. “Let’s get going.”
Dangerous thinking, the kind that never pays off. But Dean’s already starting to plump up against the front of his boxers and the zipper of his jeans, so for once, he’s gonna give himself a goddamn break.
Ellen sighs, and walks out from behind the desk. The Tauros follows her rather lethargically. “Pull out the stools, ladies and gents. It’s story time.” They don’t know Ellen at all, but there’s a bit of a dash to grab the homemade stools and find their way up on them. Ellen doesn’t seem like the kind of woman you disobey, ever.
He’s a blandly good-looking man, though Dean wouldn’t remember his face if he hadn’t seen it before. The guy’s not particularly tall or short and his hair is stuck somewhere between brown and blond. “Hello, all,” he greets. His voice has musical lilt to it.
“It’s good to be here again,” Cas tells him, and ever since Lucifer crawled into his brain and got expelled through the power of too many questions about obnoxious pop music, at least he’s gotten better at smiling like a normal person. Not that Cas is in any way normal, or a person.
Dean freezes, then flicks his eyes toward Cas. He’s munching away at his burger; there’s no jolt of recognition there. “I’ve never been,” he says, and Dean’s glad he’s not eating anything at the moment because he would have fucking choked on it.
He blinks out of sleep earlier than Dean does, due to lack of necessity, but he doesn’t mind since it allows him to prop himself up on one elbow and study Dean’s face. Of course, he’s memorized all his features the way only an angel can, to the point where Cas can tell if Dean’s lost one stray golden eyelash. Cas knows the month of the year based on the shade of Dean’s freckles.
When Alex turns toward her, she has a smile on her face. It’s a small and wary one, but it’s there nevertheless. “
Castiel just pulls Dean down on top of him, again, loving the thud of denim against bare hips. He grinds up – instinct again – and has to bite back a hiss, because he wasn’t expecting it to
Castiel is cold to the touch. Dean clenches his jaw. His teeth hurt, they’re ground together so tight.
enough. They are not only amazing betas but also some of my favorite people in the entire world, and are responsible for whipping this fic into shape. Without them, this fic would not exist. I know I sound very calm and composed here but TRUST ME I LOVE THEM SO MUCH.
“Yeah, because I wanted answers.” Sam crosses his arms, and fuck, Dean isn’t joking his way out of this one. Or not-joking, or — whatever.
He rushes back to the window, hoping to hear more of the conversation, but there’s only a deep swoosh. It’s a bit like a Flying-type Pokemon taking to the air and flapping away, but much more sudden than that, with none of nature’s messy irregularity. And then, it’s just quiet, with maybe a lone Kricketune crying out, or the trill of a Hoothoot.
Mary goes through a mental checklist. The guns. The angel blades. And her bag and its contents, maybe the most important thing of all. “I do. I’ll head out soon.”
That’s what Azazel’s Hypno reminds Dean of, just an empty doll. A husk. It’s cute when it’s a child’s toy. It’s creepy as hell when it’s a supposedly living, breathing Pokemon.
Fuck it, he’s going for it. He takes as much of Cas down as he can in one long twist, and he’s grateful for the angelic restraint because Dean can feel the deep urge to thrust up send a shake through Cas’ hips, but there’s no accompanying lift. Choking all over the guy’s dick might not be the best way to set the mood, he’s pretty sure.
“Not a problem,” Cas responds, standing up as well. There isn’t even any dirt they need to brush off their legs. “Your head fell over in sleep, and I thought it wasn’t wise to move you.”
He doesn’t know what to expect. He doesn’t even know why he goes, really. He just knows that his apartment is too fucking small right now, like the whole thing could get folded too neatly into the envelope if he stays sitting there with Vaporeon too long. That’s how he finds himself wandering through the streets, going not to the pier but the edge of town, with the address in the letter.
“Girlfriend,” Cas suggests, back now to Dean while he rummages around the kitchen, probably for coffee. He has boxers on now, but his big thighs are right in Dean’s line of sight. His ass. Dean has to take a second before he responds.
“Cas,” is all Dean can say. One word and the whole world before him. His voice breaks halfway through the single syllable.
Dean knows the water is pretty cold, another reason Opelucid Beach isn’t exactly a tourist destination, but when Vaporeon dissolves into the water and leaps out of it fully formed a few seconds later, it seems like the warmest and most welcoming place on the planet.
“Tell ‘em I said thanks,” Dean whispers, and they’re so close, pressed against each other, that he feels rather than sees Cas’ smile in return.
Dean tunes him out. It’s not because what he’s saying is wrong, he just – he can’t handle this, not now. Sammy always had that stupidly earnest face, and he doesn’t deserve that comfort or sympathy, not after what he let happen.
“She was a real piece of work, let me tell you, but you know what I keep thinking? She wasn’t wrong. Cas, I think sometimes he was happy here. He loved burgers and the, uh, you know, the company. But in Heaven, yeah, the other angels
conversations with anyone. Most people sat around on porches and talked about, he doesn’t even know, the Cardinals’ pitching or something, and drank a beer. He sat around on a porch and talked about the best way to hunt a shrtiga, and drank probably too much beer.
. Dean knows that’s not a luxury, not even close, but after the life he’s had, he’s amazed he knows people now like Cas and Charlie and Benny, who seem to think the shit he says has value. Cas, though, he’s the one who’s there to hold Dean at night, who will take his hand when Dean can’t go on any more.
Castiel glares at him in return. He doesn’t even get that little furrow between his eyes, the one that popped up on Cas’ face when he didn’t understand one of Dean’s references. Dean’ll deny it ‘til he’s gone, but sometimes he did it on purpose just to see that face. He thought a lot about smoothing out the lines on Cas’ face with his own hands, and seeing Cas’ rare gummy smile.
Dean finds himself looking back at four sets of eyes, the expressions in them ranging from pity (Cas) to confusion (Hannah) to flat-out
Dean almost never got to have these kinds of conversations with Sam when they were growing up. Danger was always lurking somewhere, their dad told them in both word and deed, so everything was always so exigent. Fun didn’t really exist.
(Gabby’s in a corner of the room, tapping away practically gleefully at a laptop and humming while she does it. “To cloak all of you guys? Needs some serious power. I’m talking like, Avada Kedavra power. Without, you know, the whole killing people thing,” she’d explained, and Dean had just let his eyebrow go up
That stops Dean up short. He should stop talking, because Castiel had no right, no goddamn right, to hear those prayers. But Dean’s options are draining away by the day. “Kept me sane in Purgatory. I gotta try everything, right? Talkin’ to you ain’t doing much so far.” He tries to keep it light. Play it off like it’s no big deal. His voice only wobbles a fraction.
An enormous gush of water rushes over Durant. It takes a few seconds, but she staggers to her feet and keeps going after Magmortar. The big red Pokemon staggers back a bit. There’s clear surprise in his eyes, shakiness in his steps, that a
“They hate emotions. Stay away from ‘em and torture any other angel who feels them. But Cas, he – he wasn’t like that. Yeah, there was a
The bus all but erupts in jeers after that. Dean’s pretty certain the girl knew she’d get this exact reaction, but she hardly reacts beyond tossing her braid over her shoulder. Her Noibat flaps on.
Dean’s pretty used to Cas saying his name, even if he’s never gonna get used to the way he’ll appear out of nowhere. Dude needs a bell, or something. But Dean’s never heard Cas gasp his name in that tone before, like he’s getting tugged underwater and totally fucking thrilled with it.
“I know that,” Dean says, and as he bites back a sigh it’s like they never grew up after all. “It’s, uh, a literal thing. I don’t know much either. No one does. We could get back to Opelucid to find it gone, or even all of Unova. The reason we could talk to Cas’ sister Anna is because she’s Latias to his Latios, and he told me she sounded real worried. I can’t ask you to get tangled up in all this crazy shit, Sam.”
After a few beats, Dean crawls back up and flops right next to Cas. It’s not exactly graceful, but whatever, he already had sex with the guy, and it was awesome.
There’d been a wide funnel, where you could toss coins down and watch them zip around in circles over and over again, before they vanished into the bottom forever. Dean tossed a couple of coins in there, not all of them because otherwise Dad would yell, and followed the path of them with his head and neck. Heck, Sammy got into it too, the long and inevitable swirl of the coin into God only knows where.
When he opens the door, he has to blink against the darkness. Everything inside is dimly lit. And there sure is a lot of
“You don’t mess around,” Dean murmurs to Staraptor. He allows himself a moment of stroking her long, sleek feathers. She nudges into his hand, and it’s something like a comfort.
Charlie sets Vulpix down after a few moments, and he gallops off to butt heads butting heads with Vaporeon. She’s cautious not to spray any water on Vulpix, and it makes Dean grin to see it. “Why don’t you show me the ropes?” he asks. Jody and Tessa have already wandered off to other duties.
He’s trying to figure out what the fuck he’s going to do next, when the door to the room itself opens. Dean can’t quite see who comes in from his point of view, but the person leaves the door open. A Steelix sticks his enormous head through the doorway and snorts, an eruption of sound in the tiny room.
So Dean doesn’t think of John. He picks up a Virizion figurine, the colors on it still bright green and pink and pure cream despite the considerable layer of dust, and thinks about Mary. She was always fond of Virizion; there was a little figurine of it on their lawn growing up, cheap plastic and rickety enough to tip over in anything stronger than a light breeze.
But there are just too many people advancing on Naomi, Uriel, and the rest of Dean’s allies. Wave after wave head after them. Giratina’s dark shadow coils and uncoils in the distance, his troops reaching up to pat his underbelly scales as they pass. Some Pokemon attempt to reach him, but he stares them down with disdain in his eyes. With a flick of his tail, they fall to the ground and lie still.
True to Krissy’s word about the free drinks, Sam and Dean both order a goddamn Cosmopolitan. Eileen, of course, gets to slam down a Guinness, which neither of them grumble over too much. Krissy goes for some froo-froo thing called a frosé. “Hey –” Dean protests, once she’s ordered.
“I’ve talked a lot of crap about angels, and that couldn’t have helped.” Dean ain’t gonna say he’s sorry for it, because he’s not, but it didn’t make things any easier.
He made the tape for a lot of reasons. Mostly, though, he kept picturing Cas listening to it. Driving his stupid car, wind in his hair, squinting against the sun, finally hearing some music that kicked serious ass. Thinking of Dean while the song wrapped around Cas’ whole body and Robert Plant made ‘im sing.
. There are many versions of the story Sam could’ve told. “I mean, you met me while you two were checking out haunted paintings and now…”
Outside, the night is perfect, a multitude of stars visible now that he’s far away from a city. The ocean laps at the shore, gentle and beautiful. Dean kind of hates it at the moment.
. You can claim you don’t care about power all you want, but I know that’s a vicious lie from anyone, sweetheart. You’re just afraid of it.”
Except not quite. “Your Vaporeon is very beautiful,” Cas says, a day or two later like they never dropped this line of discussion. Somehow, Dean’s not surprised this is how Cas handles talking to people, and he curses the stupid giddy kick in his gut. “Where did you catch her? You must be extremely skilled as a trainer to have one.”
Cobalion stares down Lilith. The Pokemon doesn’t look angry, only surprised. Azazel’s rushed to her side, but his Hypno’s gone too. Dean hopes she headed off in the same way Drifblim did.
It’s that same voice. He shouldn’t trust anything, but he rolls the blanket down from over his face and can only goggle at the tall, willowy redhead in front of him, in a tank top and black cargo pants that are loose on her skinny hips. Not Gabby. Not Marin, either. Not anyone from camp, but not a stranger either.
“Vaporeon!” he heaves out, and she leaps in front of him, a stream of water already pouring out her mouth. The mist goes solid, falls to the ground with a chunk, and shatters everywhere. Once Vaporeon has an opening, she uses her tail to propel herself through the air and land on top of Glalie. Their combined weight sinks the ice ball Pokemon to the ground, where Vaporeon jumps on top of it once, twice, three times. Glalie’s left half-subsumed by the dirt.
When he sits up – one fluid motion, thank you very much, he’s actually impressed with his own smoothness – and kisses Cas, it should feel weird, after everything. There’s
She’s got nothing on Vaporeon, though, who spurts through the water and causes small geysers to spray up in her wake. They make a neat, pretty arc; the last of the sunlight catches on them and makes the water glitter.
Cas offers up another sigh. This one isn’t so much irritated as it is bone-deep weary. “Something like that. It was either become a
After a moment, Alastair staggers to his feet. Blood’s dripping down his face, and a bruise is already starting to curdle under his thin skin. “Such a fighter, Dean,” he says, a mocking sort of awe in his voice. “So violent. Without a home, they say, and trying so hard to make your own family because yours got torn apart. You would have been perfect for the Hellscape.”
But none of this feels bad, or frightening. It just feels like potential, offered from friendly faces. From two people who understand. He’ll think about it, but he’s pretty sure he already knows the answer.
Dean gets back to his feet. He’s wobbly, and Vaporeon keeps looking at him in a way that’s so unbearably
The Impala’s A/C rattles, halfway to a death wheeze. For his part, Sam just tries to stick his face as close to the nearest vent as he can.
Something else does, though. “I said something similar, once. And you said you’d rather have me with you than not.”
“Oh. I was wrong. I do understand,” Castiel says, at last. His voice has a hazy quality that Dean has never heard from him before.
“I know,” Cas sighs. “It didn’t feel right, anyway. It’s the wrong energy for Latios.” His breath puffs out into the air, white like Reshiram itself. “Are you thinking what I’m thinking?”
She types something into the computer, then sits back and waits. Her Aurorus stares right at them. Dean’s never seen an Aurorus in person before. It’s a gorgeous Pokemon with shiny gem skin glittering in the shitty overhead fluorescents, but something is
“Let me guess, the total evil who wants to completely destroy society as we know it?” Cas sounds odd imitating Charlie’s cadence.
He doesn’t like to think about that, so – “Mix tape helping you remember anything?” Dean starts. There are a couple of empty chairs in the room. He sits in one and spends a lot of time examining the floor. He doesn’t look at the familiar messy hair, the all-wrong ice-blue eyes.
“This is okay, right?” Dean pulls away from Castiel. It’s not very far, but he’s already full of the disgusting desire to
If the situation was more normal, Dean might’ve asked Cas out. Not even necessarily on a date, because honestly, he needs
, thank you – that he should’ve brought a real jacket along. That’s when the woods thin out abruptly, stopping the words in his throat.
“I needed you then. I’ve needed you all along, I still need you. Just… if you’re out there. Come home, buddy.”
. “Just… take Cas out to get a new coat and then go shoot something. I’ll only tell people about the second part.”
in his ear, but it’s just palm to palm and fingers interlaced – he considers that honestly, he’s felt way shittier about the odds in the past.
Dean’s own memories lift out of him and join the swirl between the two of them. A few months ago, he might have said that was one of his worst nightmares But now, it’s just a relief. He’ll work on the words, he will. But at the best of times for him and Cas, they never needed words.
Anna’s already a mess. Dean’s not surprised she threw herself into a fight; her hair’s tied back, and there’s a nasty claw slash across the front of her shirt. “What the hell do you want,” she spits.
“My dad was – he was no prize, that’s for sure,” Dean explains, later, when he’s combing Zebstrika’s fur out. Cas is at his side, and Zebstrika is placid, eyes fluttering shut in sheer pleasure, and it’s all so – relaxing. Dean hasn’t had a lot of that.
“For what?” Dean laughs basically into Sam’s hair. Eileen kicks so much ass, but she must have truly tragic taste if this is what she’s into.
Sam presses his lips together; he looks thoughtful. After a moment, he says, “I’d go through all of it again for Amy. Dad freaking out – twice. Moving to a new region on my own. All the
look on his face. He’s got no idea how she’s aware of what’s going on, but really, there are some things a Pokemon just shouldn’t know.
Dean totally doesn’t cough right into his hand. It’s surprising, is all. In its way, this is even stranger than the time Cas perched on his car with bees all over him. This is so
Not that she could really forget, but the mention of Dean makes Mary remember what she’s brought back with her. She tugs her captive forward. “Not my best idea, I know, but I have –”
“I can’t guarantee what will happen, but Goldenrod is still there. I know that for a fact. I’ll be there with you. I can guard against danger, if nothing else.”
Cas has a good heart. He’s just got his eyes on the big picture and an awfully scattered brain a lot of the time. “The receptionist. The one with the Aurorus.”
. Dean bucks and whines and rolls, one long sinuous motion he wouldn’t have even thought he was capable of.
Cas scissoring himself open. He’s gonna be getting himself off to Cas’ sharp spasms around his tongue for months.
Cas lets him. His gasp seems like a thunderclap in the Impala, rattling all the way through Dean. He was just going to push a finger or two inside to open him up, watch in fascination at the clench around the digit, but the inside of Cas’ thighs are all shiny and they shake in need.
and huffy. Soap operas, seriously. “I sent Liwet and Micah to guard the prophet, but when I checked on them they were… gone. I was the only member of the garrison left, and I knew I wouldn’t be welcomed back in Heaven after we had all failed terribly.”
Dean didn’t really miss angel airlines, but he doesn’t mind how it cuts down on travel time. And yeah, he really doesn’t mind Anna’s ability to distract every one of the nurses so they can sneak Cas out. Then again, they were able to get Sam out before, and
The sky is starting to shift from blue to yellow-tangerine. Night’s falling. Twenty-four hours ago, he wouldn’t have thought he’d wake up in a bed with Cas, wake up in Cas’ bed.
So yeah, those words are now Sam’s motto. A good hunter’s motto, he thinks at the grimmest times. He mutters it to himself every time he goes into Castiel’s basement room, to ask him questions to which he’ll get no answer.
, shifting restlessly in his chair. It’s reminding him too much of them playing Sorry!, just them and the walls of the cabin with the world outside breathing down and how the fuck can Cas stay so calm? Goddamn angels. (Dean really needs to think of a better word for that.)
is how people normally greet old friends. I’ll give you a free pass because it’s been a while. But while you and Clarence over there were busy playing hero and off whacking Dick, I got caught by Crowley’s men. Smoking out was the only way I escaped. Don’t worry, Allie over here was pretty much entirely doped up on corn syrup by the time I found her. Ask your brother if you doubt me.”
“Aw, don’t sell yourself short.” Dean likes spearing his fingers through Cas’ hair way too much, though he keeps it quick here.
Dean finds himself observing a group of ten kids or so. They’ve all got big white helmets and are carrying bone-shaped clubs, too. The parents are there, watching them, but Dean’s not sure what kind of parents dress their children up as a Pokemon known for
Dean sees why Cas is closest to Anna, biological relation aside. Cas shows up in his beaten-down sandals and cargo pants-style jeans, with dorky pockets on the sides, and Anna’s wearing a white t-shirt with black scribbled across it and an olive-colored vest that hangs limply over it. The t-shirt’s big enough that she keeps tucking it over her knees when she’s sitting down.
here, with John Winchester. Chipped and ruined figurines of a Pokemon hardly anyone believes in on their continent, all in some misguided attempt to do something that Dean doesn’t know. Get Mom back, maybe. Thing is, if that’s what Dad was trying to do, well, that’s one thing Dean can’t blame him for.
A bunch of Dean’s allies are sending their Pokemon after her; he spots Jake, Ennis, and Amy. Kubrick’s Lanturn launches Hydro Pump after Hydro Pump right into her gut, like she’s transformed into a waterfall. Hydreigon tries to fight back, corrosive gray mist rising from her body and dusting over any Pokemon that’s not smart enough to get out of the way, but in the beats between attacks her head wags back and forth, back and forth. She’s lost without her trainer.
, he’s in public and not fifteen years old and he can control himself, thank you very much — when he sees it. “Was that not okay?” He sounds irritated, like he wants to get right back to it. Dean’s internally fist-pumping so fucking hard, even with all the eyes on him.
Eileen also looks around the bar. It’s pretty crowded in here by now. She starts signing, going slow, because Sam’s learning. Because he likes signing and it’s useful, he’s told himself a couple of dozen times.
brother and John Winchester’s son and a gigantor man to boot. A six-pack shouldn’t half-flatten the guy.
Whatever he felt, it had rattled his very brain inside his skull, seared his shoulder bright pink-red, filled him with terror and wonder alike. Within a year, that force would be his best friend. After a little more than a year, it’d be – well. Dean doesn’t think about it too much, except for how he can never
, dude, that’s morbid.” Dean’s fucking thrilled for the opportunity to make a joke. Castiel has surprised him a lot, but he’s never thrown him completely off like that.
He will ask Dean about somnophilia later. He needs his consent, but them joined together, while Dean’s as particularly beautiful as he is while dozing –
They’re clutching to each other in the middle of a costume warehouse. Charlie’s eyes are so red they’re only a couple of shades off from her hair, and Dean has matching tear blotches on his costume, which is so bright it’s practically a scream. Charlie herself is wearing only one shoe, and that shoe is a slipper made out to look like an oversized Charizard foot. As for Dean, he spilled his guts, for the first time in a goddamn long time. Maybe the first time ever sober. Certainly the first time to someone whose face he’d have to see another day.
As for John, the roof of Celestial Tower had no more answers than anywhere else did, and he dragged them off to another too-long flight from Mistralton not long after that. But Dean still remembers those few hours he spent in the dark, one arm around Vaporeon and the other around Sammy, staring stock forward on guard. That’s how alert he is now, still staring at the damn letter.
“Cubone? Morbid,” Cas says from next to him, which makes Dean jolt in surprise but is also exactly what he was thinking.
Dean takes off from the kitchen soon after. Makes him itchy if he’s in there alone for too long. Of course, he walks smack dab into Sam right as he exits the kitchen for the hallway.
“Always wanted to adopt an Oddish or Bellsprout or two,” he says, as he notices Dean eyeing the terrarium and watering can. “Likely wouldn’t get along with Staraptor, though.”
Dean’s lips and eyelids twitch minutely in sleep, but other than that he’s more still than he ever is. His slack face is beautiful, so beautiful, in its relaxation. Dean’s dreams can be upsetting, so Cas is glad he’s here, to skim fingers over Dean’s forehead and chase away the nightmares to bring him restful sleep. He’s extremely happy they finally made their way back to Dean’s bed, for the sake of Dean’s comfort.
Dean moves in, which makes Castiel’s eyes open up again. He’s greeted with the sight of Dean’s bowed head and his lips, easily rounded, as he blows out over the new tattoo to dry it off. The shininess of the black disappears in patches, until it’s matte. So many sensations overwhelm his newly human body, and Castiel isn’t sure which one he likes the best.
“Let’s get the fuck out of here,” Mary says, at last. Sam ducks his head, probably flustered at his mom cursing. Castiel doesn’t respond at all, but goes with her when she pulls him, a little too hard, out of the room.
Nightmares, they suck, but he can deal with them. It’s his memories that are the worst dreams of all.
Slowly, they all trickle out of the enclosure. There’s still a lot of land to see, and they’ve got free rein of it until they have to pack back into the van. Dean wants to leave, sure, there are whole swathes of this place he hasn’t seen and Staraptor’s starting to get visibly bored circling around the perimeter of the farm area over and over again. But he finds himself cradling Leafeon until he good-naturedly starts squirming in his arms – Leafeon doesn’t like to sit still for long, Dean’s noticed that, someone needs to teach this guy how to be
“Okay.” Cas’ fingers whisper across the back of his neck. Dean’s been too tired to have any more than half a stiffy, even with Cas’ hands all over him, but that touch might as well be a kiss. It makes Dean hard as a fuckin’ diamond, instantly like he’s twenty again, and he might be moaning already. “Whenever you’re ready. Even if it’s never.”
At the front of the room, tiny in the distance, there’s a huge desk. Gordon just had a tiny back room that Kubrick was always squeezing into, too. Here, the desk takes up almost the entire length of the room.
Dean barely had any time with Vaporeon as an Eevee. He saved up and scrounged and – okay, even at twelve, he
Dean’s been distracted for a bit, but now that he returns his full attention to the table, Cas and his siblings are clearly in the middle of some good-natured argument. Gabriel’s charging her way through this debate, unsurprisingly.
Hand still on Dean’s forearm, lying warm in the crook of Dean’s elbow, Cas speaks. “He wanted to understand your soul, I think.”
“I think I see a solution that could work.” Cas’ hands are clasped in front of him. He’s smiling, soft. This is a crazy dream, some dumbass romantic fantasy, made real. That’s the only possible explanation.
It’s terrifying to admit to someone else besides himself, this thing that he’s been carrying as close to him as the amulet used to be, a soft bump against his chest with every step. He can’t remember a time when he
Dean reads those words and wants to vomit. He wants to take the note, crumple it up, throw it and whatever else is in this envelope in the garbage and forget it forever. He’ll toss the key into the dumpster and forget about it. He’s got no goddamn
“This is good,” Cas says, and Dean realizes they’re on one hell of a plateau overlooking the city of Opelucid.
Cas stays stationary for a few beats. When he starts moving again, he might as well be giving Dean a massage. His fingers dig in deep enough that Dean’s breath sputters with every pass of his hands. Dean lets out a curse, something low and warm, and then moves his own hands to slide his fingers down Cas’ spine, learn the dips and grooves in his ribcage. Cas has all his clothes on, but his skin under Dean’s even through the layers is so warm. Dean can picture the flush tinting him under those damn clothes, the ruddiness swooping everywhere.
They stop back at Carver, of course, to take Nancy back with them. Most of Sam’s friends stay behind at the apartments – they’re not daring to set foot on campus – though Amy goes to help them find their way. “I grew my hair out since I went on leave,” she says, a little too cheery. She sounds like she’s trying to convince herself. “They won’t recognize me. I’ll help you find your way around campus.”
Most marriages weren’t like theirs, Daphne told him later, her eyes wide. Usually, people who were married could take care of situations like this for each other. There was a great deal of affection and caring in their marriage, even love, but she knew he didn’t want her like that – and Emmanuel had wondered what she meant in those two words, until he met Dean – and she couldn’t take advantage of him.
Instantly, Cas’ eyes flick over to Dean. Always so damn concerned. Dean offers up the biggest smile he can, and it’s even mostly genuine. “Not gonna be a problem at all,” he says.
At least her face is already wet from the tears when Sam splashes her across it with holy water. “Would expect nothing less,” she gasps. She can’t even bring herself to wipe the water off, instead letting it drip onto the ground. “How long has it –”
This is a man without strength of any kind. At the Hellscape, he made everyone else do his filthy work for him. Then, he got Mewtwo to do it. He’s just pathetic.
Dean stands at the crest of the hill. He feels awful, stalling up here while all the action’s going on below. At least he can catch the flash of Staraptor’s white feathers and red crest barrel into a Shiftry. The thing stands no chance and falls to the ground in a heap of leaves.
Tonight, though, Cas is taking Dean to dinner with Anna, Hannah, and Uriel. He says the four of them grew up together, and try to have dinner every couple of months. Dean realizes it’s already been
They figured out what to do with Castiel early on. In one of her bags, Mary had some chains that could hold down an angel, even at full power. “I stole them,” she told Sam and Dean, grimacing even as she did. Neither of them bothered to ask where she stole them from, because they knew.
Cas seems to consider this for a moment. “I suppose I could use rest as well.” He actually sits down on the ground, spreading his trenchcoat out neatly under him so the dirt doesn’t get on his scrubs, but still. Dude’s sitting right on the forest floor. His legs stick out in front, and Dean realizes he doesn’t see Cas sit a whole lot.
“Don’t have to tell me twice. Love you.” He kisses the corner of Cas’ mouth – even brief and off-center, it makes a thrill reverberate through Cas’ grace – and then he’s off to sleep again.
– and some other things I could throw together, and bam. A natural aggressor. I overrode millennia of breeding not to seriously harm humans, or other Pokemon either, with a little cocktail I mixed up one afternoon.”
“Now.” Dean grips Cas, palms on his biceps. The contact feels heady, even through their clothes, even completely platonic. “God, I just – we’re gonna have to – we gotta talk. A lot. I missed you, man. I missed you so much. But you’re here now, and I – I can’t tell you how happy I am for that.”
Only Castiel could make a world with no monsters sound like Mos Eisley Spaceport. “I was in Purgatory with Cas. For a year.” Dean would mention Benny, but he’s pretty sure Castiel would scorn the hell out of him for having a vampire friend. “It was violent, it was bloody. Made me think things about myself I never wanted to.”
Hannah was a good warrior, but her years on the throne changed her. She’d kissed his forehead before sending him off with a human like Mary; it was a strange enough gesture to unsettle Castiel more than leaving with Mary did, and he’d thought he was headed to a certain death at the time.
, but I think he’s figured it out by now. Just needs a little alone time. Our coping mechanisms suck.”
Dean, very suddenly, finds himself looking right into the eyes of an Alakazam. He jolts back a bit, he admits. He
Dean’s palms move over his thighs, and it distracts Castiel from his thoughts. They’re so warm, and he’s gone
He licks at him, over and over, using the wide flat part of his tongue and then narrowing right down to the flexible tip. It’s only when Cas is practically yowling for it that he realizes he’s been fucking right into his ass with his tongue.
“We have to follow them.” It’s Anna, back as herself. She’s a fucking mess, her hair sprung from her ponytail and wild like it served as Pidgeot’s nest. Long dirty streaks arrow down her face. “I – I don’t know what to say, Dean.”
doesn’t spill over to Opelucid itself. Lotta skinny dipping incidents by the shore, usually. You can imagine how it’s been since we got the call that most of the Pokemon world’s most wanted were right here in Unova.”
“Let’s make this easier,” Dean breathes, his voice already gone raspier than normal. He’s moving, then, all but dumping the shirt off. Castiel stares, unabashed, at the flex of muscles and the subtle shift of Dean’s skin, the pretty curve of his biceps and the easy bend of his fingers.
They emerge into a new area after God knows how long walking. It’s merely an open space around a pool. Stalagmites sprout out of the ground in the corners, and a couple of shy Sableyes dart behind them as more people and Pokemon fill the area. It’d probably be pretty if Dean could see for shit right now.
The swords of justice: Virizion, Cobalion, Terrakion, and the tiny Keldeo. Long ago, so the legends say, humans all but destroyed Unova in a bloody war. Keldeo was one of the casualties. Virizion, Cobalion, and Terrakion all saved Keldeo and wiped out the violent humans, leaving way for them to serve as guardians for the peaceful survivors. As the story says at the end, now they lie waiting to quell the next great war.
His chest is flat – Jimmy was a jogger – and neither particularly pale nor dark. Now, though, there is a pattern of heavy scar tissue drawn across there. The circle is the largest there, but it encases Enochian wards, and a pattern of flared triangles surround it. Castiel is lucky enough that he woke up with it healed to this point; it’s too much to ask this symbol of his betrayal of his brothers to vanish.
They fire. The enormous blaze launches toward Dean. He needs to get his ass in gear, but he’s not fucking moving.
cliché. And hell, this isn’t even meeting the parents; it’s meeting the siblings. Some of the siblings, because Zachariah adopted a ton of kids, and even though they could probably all band together to sue his ass off over negligent child-rearing, they’re all so spread out in age that Cas has admitted he’s not even sure how many siblings he actually
Dean grumbles, to cover the fact that his stomach cramps and his thoughts are still scattered everywhere. If he tried to stand up right now, his legs would probably just give out. “What’s with all the Harry Potter nerds around camp?”
floor – and in return, all he gets are glowers strong enough to make Dean forget all about ever smiling. The guy’s Skarmory gave Vaporeon something like a sympathetic look, or as sympathetic as a Skarmory could look with a chrome metal face, as she glided out of the elevator, but it was too late by then. Friends beyond Vaporeon were just for other people, Dean supposed.
That one word encompasses everything about it, and yet could never sufficiently describe the glory Castiel experiences. There is damage in this soul; whole chunks have been ripped from it, and many of the colors are set over with a dark tone. But none of that damage can mar its beauty; if anything, it just makes it more miraculous.
It’s way too early in the morning — even if it’s like one PM by now — and he was having way too much fun teaching Cas how to drive like just twenty minutes ago to be having a conversation like this, corkscrewing right into his guts and brain and heart at once. “So the guy cares, we’ve been through a lot of shit, of course he does. He cares about you too, you know —”
Charlie grips Cas, because of course she’s talking about Cas, by the shoulders and whirls him around so he’s facing Dean. He’s wearing his constant worn trenchcoat, only he’s stuck a bunch of big red feathers to – well, to his ass, not that Dean can really see the shape of it under the trenchcoat and
The nursery’s mostly comprised of a big floor – the place was probably some kind of barn for Tauros or Rapidash, the unusually large subspecies bred for domestic work, before they converted it to a nursery – divided into neat rows and columns by wooden fences. The fences are pretty tall, too, because some of the Pokemon get huge before they’re sent off to adoption or preserves. Dean tops six feet, but he can’t see over them.
Dean gets in the Impala — seriously, he has to fight the urge to drop to his knees and kiss her everywhere or something, it’s just been way too long — and drives, Sam giving him directions, Cas in the backseat.
But he can’t stop his feelings, stupid as they might be. He’s here with Cas, his bed warm with their body heat. Vaporeon and Staraptor are outside their door, probably sleeping collapsed on top of each other.
Dean knows he’s looking at the piles of food with outright lust. “Can I at least tell you the deets over a decent meal?”
Mary was a jarring exclamation point on the landscape. There was darkness in her soul, and a haze that had nothing to do with the soot in the sky blotted parts out. But red and gold and bronze still wrestled proudly within her. Yellow shot across her features. She carried the sweet green of plants Castiel had an intrinsic knowledge of, but had never seen. Before she arrived in Heaven, there were whispers among the other angels of a killer who struck angels down while they were still in awe of her soul.
He doesn’t know what kind of response he’s expecting. Maybe a sucked-in, offended breath that Cas doesn’t need to breathe, or worse, the angel vanishing in a poof of feathers, leaving nothing behind but his weird half-ash, half-honey scent. Instead, all he gets is Cas’ eyes going wider than normal, and admitting, “I don’t want to fight. It only… ruins things. But I wouldn’t lie about this, Dean. I’d fight to keep you safe.”
She’s halfway out the door when she turns back and points at him. She’s gotta be close to a foot shorter than he is, but he still feels nothing but sheer terror at her brandished finger. “If you wanna talk to my brother,” Gabriel tells him, “just
He’s expecting judgement. Harshness. Condescension. But the only thing Cas has for him are soft eyes and a deliciously swollen mouth.
Cas is actually cringing as he settles into one of Dean’s chairs. Great. “I really am sorry about –”
She can’t take any time to gloat, not that it’s her style, because he’s back on his feet a few seconds after that and slicing through the air. His blade does make contact with her arm, but it only tears the sleeve of her jacket, and she needs to burn the damn thing anyway.
Part of it is the bullshit bravado he’ll always throw out there, the kind that let him face apocalypse after apocalypse and make it through ‘em all. But part of it is real, and it’s not like something he decided to do. It just happened, and it’s pretty goddamn funny that it took Purgatory and the end of the world.
, and he’d still need someone to convince him he’d done enough to deserve Cas’ devotion. Cas would still be the most stubborn son of a bitch Dean ever met, and wouldn’t leave no matter what ugly-ass thing Dean did or however much he thought his ideas were clearly moronic. They’d still fight, but keep circling around each other. It’s destiny by two people who’ve flipped it off, over and over. It’s an impossibility that keeps finding a way to exist; fuck, they’re
“I know they didn’t want me here,” Tessa says, as her Pokemon, an Absol, crawls his way out from under the desk. There’s a challenge in her eyes while she says it; Dean’s pretty sure she’s daring him to mention Absol as the reason she isn’t wanted.
Dean thinks about all the afternoons when he should have been in school but was facing another seemingly endless drive to another town that he knew would have no answers to a pointless question. He thinks about all the times he watched Vaporeon get pummeled by Pokemon that had been training since before Dean was even born, just so Dad could
“Thought you were a virgin,” Dean pants, letting his thumbs stroke over the spurs of Castiel’s hipbones. They’d be so fuckin’ easy to trace his tongue over, too, or rub up against, even if he apparently already has, does it even
Dragonite stays in the air for a few seconds after that, careening back and forth. Dean could tell she’s an impeccably well-trained Pokemon, after all, and he doubted Whimsicott was as strong as she was. But Whimsicott had the major type advantage, and Dragonite had already took damage in the battle. She thuds to the ground right in front of Michael, eyes falling shut as she faints.
Cas reaches over and trails his fingers over the beaded black plastic, the nub at the end. He’s – fuck – he’s guiding Dean’s hand right back between his thighs, legs spread wide, ready for it.
There’s a long moment where Dean, Vaporeon trotting alongside him, crosses the length of the apartment one, two, three times. He’s thinking about forgetting the envelope, at least for the day, and getting blotto drunk.
“It’s me.” She shrugs, small and almost apologetic. “Here —” and she pulls out a knife from her backpack to cut into her own skin. A long red rivulet drips down her pale inner arm before the wound closes itself up again. “Can’t be too careful, I know.”
“Naomi always said you had quite the knack for storytelling.” The hesitation etched across Anna’s brow is starting to loosen.
Later. Later, because now, he has Cas spread out, naked, in full. Dean touches him, and if Cas notices that his hands are trembling he thankfully says nothing. His fingers find Cas’ shoulders, his nipples, the spurs of his hipbones. One hand finds Cas’ and holds on tight, fingers braided together as their palms kiss.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you this until now, Cas. Anna, too. I’m sorry for… everything. I’m just sorry. There’s so much I wish I could change.”
That was a couple of months ago now. What was supposed to be a one-night stand turned into, so far, a seventy-four-night stand. Claire can’t say she really minds it. Her heart stopped earlier this year; if she can find happiness, well, she’s going to take it while she’s still here.
Emmanuel cries out as he comes. Orgasm has never been like this before, the hot risky thrill of it all. He falls a bit in love with the hard crest of it, how the feeling arches up and up through his body from his cock and then crashes down, leaving him pleasantly worn out. For a few sweet seconds,
It’s kinda girly, but Cas liked it, so whatever. He traces a finger over the raised patterns, funny little bumps in the shapes of hearts because the universe has a fucked up sense of humor. Carefully, he drags the tip across Cas’ stomach, watches them both quiver.
“Because she was trying to help you!” Dean didn’t realize he was practically shouting until Cas’ brows furrow. “Alright, so she had crappy methods. I’m not arguing that. But you gotta see how fucked this whole thing is.”
The sea is still swooping up to meet the shore, rising and falling like breath itself. The sky is glitter spackled on a black canvas. In the background, Dean can hear the music, something with an upbeat rhythm, playing from the tent.
“I love you too, then.” Cas kisses him, then, brief but enough to thrill. The air smells acrid, and the dust clouds are so thick here it’s hard to see anything on the field, so for the moment, Cas seems like the whole world.
“Jody and Alex and Claire said he was badass. I’m sorry I never got to meet him. A real angel, wow.”
“It’s him,” Dean says. He hates to separate from Cas’ side. But pushing him toward his mom, keeping a hand right at the small of his back – that’s gotta be the least bad way to say goodbye.
“She said Charlie kept looking at that disk Gabriel gave her, the one from Marv’s headquarters, and that she found actual pertinent information on it.”
“If I could,” he says, at last, “I’d help you get him back. I’d help you find him. I would, Dean.” There’s a pause. The air crackles. “You make me want –”
“Yep.” Jody had taken Cas off for his grand tour. “Not like he really needs it.” Guy’s an angel; he doesn’t sleep, or have any use for anything in the bathroom. He doesn’t even own any clothes other than his trenchcoat and the hospital scrubs. Dean hopes Sam’s told the other people around camp all about Cas, because it takes a little while to get used to him.
“She’s really good at what she does,” Jody had promised, pressing the card into Mary’s hand. “Was only in the life for a couple of years, but she got out to, well, do this.”
Sam runs a hand through his truly ridiculous shaggy hair. “Shit.” The color’s waning from his face awfully fast. “Let me – let me go with you. I wanna help. Let us all go with you. I’ll ask around. How’d you manage to talk to his sister, anyway? Communication lines are all shot.”
“Why are you like this?” Dean asks, watching her flounder in an attempt to drag over the other chair with her foot. Whimiscott jumps onto her lap, not making it any easier.
As Dean feels the sleepiness seep away from him, he realizes Cas’ arm is lying across his leg, and he’s fallen back into the guy’s lap. He would be embarrassed, if he wasn’t so blissed out from sleep. Maybe he really did need a nap.
Still, he pauses, if only to think. They’re two dudes in the backseat of a car (best car in the whole freakin’ universe, but still a car) and they need room.
It’s been a while since Dean had any fingers inside himself that weren’t his own, and it’s hard for him to get the angle right. Cas doesn’t get it perfectly either, but truth be told Dean doesn’t care. He’s swept away by the cresting wave of sensation anyway. Cas’ hands are broad and Dean’s thought about them for so long now.
“I’m sure you can.” Cas has that tone to his voice, the one where Dean can’t tell if he’s trying to be deliberately seductive or messing around with Dean – or, honestly the most likely, completely unaware of what he’s saying and how he’s saying it. After all, they’re talking about goddamn eggs.
here at Edlund. Barnes is cool, she’s the blind lady with a seeing-eye Octillery. Leave Cain alone, though. He just wants to practice fighting with his Doublade. Pretty awesome to see,
talk, the greed in his eyes and his words, like that’s what matters. He launches himself toward Roman, until he’s got that rich jackass pinned on the ground. Dean’s hands are scrambling right for that Poke Ball, that fucking Poke Ball, his
Dean’s trying to stop himself from smiling stupidly at the hunched ball of trenchcoat and messy hair, when it turns back to him. “His name is Huexkull,” Cas informs. “He knows where there’s clean water, he tells me.” He stands up again, and turns to Dean, almost conspiratorially. “Leviathan are tuned to find water, of course.”
“Can’t win ‘em all,” Dean speaks up at last. Cas raises his head and stares at Dean, long and curiously, as if he’s noticing him for the first time. “Barboach ain’t so bad. C’mere, you can pet Vaporeon.”
“You need…” Dean reaches a hand up and pats over the expanse of his pectoral muscle. “Close enough to human now that we don’t need stunt demon number eleven occupying you at the last minute. Don’t exactly have a tattoo gun, but I’ll find something.” He stands up and leaves the kitchen. Castiel hears rummaging, and passes the time watching the glint of light off the beer bottles. Night is such a strange thing, how so many things are visible despite the darkness bearing down.
There’s another knock on the door a few days later. Dean doesn’t even want to answer it, unless it’s Cas there with an explanation and apology. It’s probably Uriel again, there to give Dean a piece of his mind. He wouldn’t even be wrong.
“You’re very important, Dean.” Cas is definitely humoring him, but there’s also just enough of that damn earnestness in his words.
Dean hadn’t said anything. He just picked her up and held her far away from him. She curled around his neck and chest anyway, and he’d been surprised at how warm she was. Even when he evolved her, and she was all scales and slick skin, she still had that warmth. Dean suspects she could’ve ended up a Glaceon, and it would’ve been the same.
It’s all so fascinating, because he’s seen millennia, and he’s had universes live inside him. He’s seen humans undress each other, too, seen Dean Winchester crowd girls into the backseat of the Impala and peel their clothing away.
Dean has nothing to defend himself with. He’s lying prone on his back in this freaky rain, half-blinded by the lightning, hands scrabbling in the gravel to try and get a grip. The hot stink of the bolt’s impact clogs his nose. It sweeps away suddenly, with an icy gust, and then there’s nothing but petrichor rising all around him, cradling him.
Dean clicks the vibration on, and he has two seconds before Cas screams, arching up into a hard line of need and want and heat and love and fucking everything, emptying himself out onto his skin again. He’s lucky Cas learned to hold himself back when they first started doing this, so he doesn’t blow out Dean’s eardrums and the windows alike, but it still rips a hard throb through his own body. The raw hot
Cas looks down at the table, folding his hands in front of him. Dean’s not sure where to look, at the length of his fingers or the sweep of his eyelashes. It’s all appealing. “I’m
“Funny you should say that,” Alastair says. “Others have been so generous. I’ve managed to obtain a Pokemon through these long years. You know, they say Pokemon can be so
There’s not too many people he’d talk to about missing Mary; it’s too personal, those feelings too hard to dredge up for fear of everything spilling out. But he talks about it with Missouri, who’s stupidly supportive about it. More than Dean deserves.
Dean doesn’t stay in the hospital long after that; it’s four days before he’s outta there. Had to go through too many tests before that, but it’s over with. Everything checked out fine. He doesn’t think the Joys in the place appreciated someone that cursed that much and was that damn cranky, anyway.
“Look, I wasn’t exactly jumping for joy when I found out what Meg was, either.” No-nonsense. Dean likes that. “She hasn’t led me wrong yet, though.”
Dean opens his mouth to sputter a complaint, when Sam interrupts him. “Dean, I… this is about the baby steps, okay.”
She’ll only end up telling people about how she was right, Dean thinks, though without bitterness. It makes him smile, in fact.
Most of the noise turned into John coming home drunk or another yelling match between him and Sam. Or the house was empty, because John had shoved Dean and Sam off one of the sketchier Pokemon training facilities, one that wouldn’t look twice at them being way under the legal age to own Pokemon and certainly to battle them.
Marowak approaches him. Tension locks up his thighs. When it comes to fight or flight, he’s gonna pick the latter, but in this situation he’d feel like a real dick. He feels Vaporeon ready behind him, too, and she’s a well-trained Pokemon with the type advantage. It’s going to be okay, he keeps telling himself. It’s going to be okay.
They’re barely back inside, hands brushing together with every step, when Dean hears a scream that slices through the sound of the rain. It’s gotta be his mom, and she
“I’m not him,” Castiel says, face looming far above Dean’s. And then, quietly, “I can’t be him. I don’t know how. From what you tell me, he was extraordinary. I can’t be that. I’m sorry.”
Gabriel pauses in her rummaging to look up at him. “Been what? Two weeks? I figured you could use some companionship. Who’s better company than me?”
that. “And made out,” he adds, kinda feebly. Well, at least it’s part lie now. “Angel tongue tastes like apple pie.”
“This, right? We’re crazy people.” Gabby breezes past them pretty cheerily, climbing into her own van and dumping her backpack, striped pink and powder blue, into the backseat. Tamara looks kinda ticked off about having to sit shotgun, but she’s holding the GPS like a weapon at least.
So he’s still happy with his little ragtag makeshift family and all their weirdo tales, and that’s all he really needs these days. He’s got that, and the world’s not oblivion or eternal hellfire. He’s more than okay with all of that.
, not just Opelucid’s ever-present Dragon-types but Persians and Furfrous too, and plenty of revived fossil Pokemon. Dean tries not to gawk when a couple of Aerodactyls meet in mid-air not far in the distance from him, then swoop back to their owners.
word for them – from Alastair’s company got locked away in the highest-security prisons there were, guarded until the end of their lives, kept far far away from Pokemon. The people Azazel and Lilith kidnapped got sent to all kinds of therapy. Pokemon usually got sent along with them to meetings, too, the easygoing and gentle ones like Audino or Happiny. Still, most of the time, those people found themselves flinching away from even the most docile Pokemon. Recovery was rare, and slow.
“She died in an accident,” Sam had said once. The furious, almost manic glare John had shot him in return had made certain neither Sam nor Dean ever brought that fact up again.
There’s nothing wrong with Nacrene. In fact, Dean’s been there enough times to say it’s a perfectly nice city, with its solid granite buildings. That’s just the thing; he’s
“This place doesn’t only feel like it’s for lost Pokemon,” Tamara explains. “The job here saved me. I’m from Opelucid, and I never knew my mom, or my dad. I was married, but my husband… well, I hear you’re from Opelucid too, you know what happens there. The crazy hunts for Dragon-type Pokemon… after I lost him, I lost myself. I was so angry for so long, so damn long.”
She slams the door shut loudly enough that the supposedly soothing but mostly just infantile pastel-colored painting of a lake hung up in the room rattles on its frame. The rattling stops after a couple of seconds; the frame steadies itself. Dean wishes he could do the same.
Dean finally moves his lips together, and nods. He starts on his second beer. “I’m sorry,” he offers. Castiel never could read minds, exactly, but the louder thoughts of humans were simply there for him to absorb. Some vestige of that makes him recognize Dean isn’t only apologizing for the banishing sigil. Or maybe it’s merely human instinct, which is a frightening prospect to contemplate.
Whimsicott, though, is just a beat too slow. Most of it lands on Altaria’s fluffy cloud, where it’s harmlessly absorbed. Altaria raises her wings up high, cloudy and puffy like the rest of her body, and zooms right up to Whimsicott. She pauses for a moment, like she’s recognized Whimsicott, but then she’s barreling into him. Whimsicott collapses.
“What’s up,” Dean asks. He’s not really thinking about Cas’ answer, though; he’s thinking about getting his mouth on the small of Cas’ back. Maybe lower, even. It’s a fuckin’ great idea –
He decides to start easy, just to take the edge off. Carefully, he slides the oval-shaped silver egg into his palm and slides it up Cas’ belly, at the same time Dean’s mouth moves right between his legs.
Dean grunts, and moves out from under the sheets. “Thanks,” he murmurs. The place is downright swanky for him. He shuffles over to check out the mini-bar.
They haven’t been here for more than a couple of hours, but it’s already clearly wearing on all of them. Their footsteps have slowed to a shuffle. There’s almost no natural light in this place, and only some of the Pokemon are proving useful; Benny’s Herdier in particular keeps grumbling because her herding abilities aren’t very helpful here.
brother?” he blurts out. Smooth. “And he’s hilarious?” There’s no excuse for that one; he had time to think about what he was saying.
He belches. That is less pleasant. “Don’t be disgusting,” Castiel mutters, but there’s no edge behind it and Dean just grins wider. It doesn’t quite show in his eyes, and Castiel would not expect it to.
“Uh, guys –” he starts to say, but he falls silent when the two of them turn their eyes to him. It’s – intimidating. And kind of uncomfortably hot, which he really does not want to think about at this particularly inopportune moment.
Lucas rears up, exposing his full length. He’s shockingly huge. All of his body is coils, unfurling over and over again. There’s an end to him, there must be an end to him, but the ribbon of his form keeps unspooling.
In the car, it’s too early for Espeon and Vaporeon to even squabble, so they go right to sleep. Sam, on the other hand, has decided to go into full-on whine mode. “Vaporeon fell asleep too close to me,” he gripes. “Gonna get everything all damp.”
“The world was so small,” Cas says to him, as they rock each other back and forth. Vaporeon and Staraptor are already batting the other with wing and paw, ignoring their completely ridiculous trainers. They always were the brains of this operation.
And Cas. Cas, there wasn’t even words for it. He’d known Vaporeon for decades, and he’d known Cas for less than a year, but Dean had come to have twin places in his heart for the two of them. John told him never to fall too fast, but with Cas it wasn’t even falling.
The screaming pink light grows and grows, until Whimsicott is swallowed by it, his tiny round shape gone and replaced with nothing but a large orb. Dean has to avert his eyes from it, but before he does, he sees even Dragonite staring emptily at the light.
“Doesn’t matter now,” Cas says, quietly. Dean tugs him close at that. He sure as hell knows what it’s like to dredge up the courage to say any goddamn thing against your family, even the parts of it you can’t stand.
Cas nods, but he doesn’t look too happy about it. Then, because the guy’s apparently fucking evil, he swiftly unbuttons his pants and tugs them down, leaving him in just – well, Dean knows he wears boxer briefs now. They’re gray and cling to his thighs, which are thicker than Dean was expecting, the lines of muscle in them clear.
Dean’s eyes instinctively flick over to Cas, as much as he hates it. Cas is busying himself getting water and plant food into a couple of the verdant grassy alcoves where the multitude of Budew and a handful of Roselia in the shelter live, but he keeps glancing toward Charlie and smiling.
At that, Dean can feel himself heating up again. He might just be angry at himself, but he’s not going to admit that to anyone.
. The tape starts rolling, and the first thing Dean sees is Claire bolting away, her braids bouncing with her wide strides. Her Noibat desperately flutters after her, until she snatches him out of the air to cradle him against her chest as she runs. The cops run after her, too, but she’s faster and so she gets away.
when his brother pressed two fingers to his forehead and whined that Lucifer wouldn’t stop singing “Stairway to Heaven.”
He checks his phone nearly every minute after that, until Charlie’s giving him weird looks, but there’s no response from Sam. That one hurts even more than the rest. When he was acting pathetic and
, sure, but – they were there. Yes, he has the memory of John keeping a wary eye on him while Vaporeon took on an likely overleveled Luxio, not out of concern but because he was waiting to let Dean hear it if he showed a second of weakness, but he also has the memory of Mary splashing in the pond by their house with him and letting him dry his hands off on Leafeon’s fern tail.
It’s mostly dark in the room, only one of the overheads on. Cas’ profile is gorgeous when it catches just a hint of the light. Staring at it as he does, Dean settles on the bed, rubbing his hands over his knees to fight off the nerves that now spring up.
question come from? It’s just Dean’s luck to get stuck in Purgatory with the one thing that wouldn’t be able to discuss crappy late-night movies or music or any of the
“Tell me about it,” Ava says. She’s short, with a no-nonsense haircut with bangs and plain clothes. Her Malamar takes up all the flash, glowing in the dark and whirling his tentacles around. “I think anyone that didn’t get the hell outta there is too brainwashed to say anything.”
He doesn’t think. He keeps reading, even if it’s just running his eyes over the same words over and over again. He’s pushing on, is the thing, because it’s the one thing he can do.
“Look, I don’t like talking much, and I know you’re not really one for that either. S’why you get me, probably. I’m just… I’m glad you’re here, man.”
Still, all he gets is Gabe throwing her hands up best she can, while Whimsicott is tucked against her side. Much as he doesn’t want to like her at all, because of the absolute hostility that’s still wafting off Anna and Cas, watching the little guy cuddle up to Gabriel in utter adoration proves endearing as hell. “You two are gonna make this impossible for me,” she snaps.
Dean’s heart is still shattered, and the fight still rages not twenty feet ahead of them, but he cradles Cas’ cheeks, relishing the stubble that’s so rough under his fingers, and kisses the hell out of him. The wind whips up around them, angry, blowing cold enough that Dean has to move his body in until it’s cradled against Castiel’s. He hardly minds.
him who we have down there, right?” Sam asks, putting his fork down. When Dean doesn’t answer, Sam puts on one of his more constipated-looking bitchfaces. “You’ve only been having heart-to-hearts with

He rushes off to help Lily. Her Starmie and a Cloyster are engaged in a vicious battle. Starmie whirls and whirls, going fast enough to slice into the Cloyster’s shell, but the Cloyster snaps back, trying to swallow the Starmie whole. Dean’s moving fast as he can, which explains why he practically trips over the girl in dark clothes crouched by where the wall of the cave meets the floor.
“Probably not,” Cas concedes. “But he’s – what?” Cas must be distracted by the way Sam keeps looking at the two of them, mirth tinting the expression on his face.
and Cas isn’t strung-out and hopeless. It might be 2014, and they might all be stuck in a shitty world in Camp Chitaqua, but they can make it better this time. Sam looks older, but not beaten yet.
“Just… thanks for everything,” was all Dean could say afterward. His own face was hot, but it must’ve been because Cas’ skin was, or leftover from the stubble just under the skin. He definitely hadn’t fucking blushed, okay.
He’s intoxicated with it, muscles going loose as a flowing stream. Cas could do whatever he wanted with Dean when he’s like this. But what he does is keep thrusting into him. Long shoves, now, hissed breath between every push, but steady.
“If I see you again, I hope you’re not ramming that knife down my throat. Take care of yourself.” She might make a face like she wants to expel whatever the hell bubbles around in a demon’s stomach out from her gut, but she says it. With that, she turns around and walks away, gait firm and strong in a way he’s almost never seen from anyone else before. Dean hates how much he hopes it never comes to that, too.
to get over, and there ain’t a magic button to make any of it go away. Cas frequently describes himself as
and run right out the door to give those poor motherless guys a hug, but then again, he’s pretty sure that isn’t exactly good protocol in a job interview. He stays tight in his seat.
others about the bad juju. Rich assholes who donate money just to see their name on a college building are exactly the type to clutch pearls and squawk about how they wouldn’t want an Absol near baby Pokemon.
Zebstrika bumps his hand, as if expressing her solidarity, and wouldn’t you know, the girl still sets off this prickle of static electricity, and the hair on his arm stands on end. Dean doesn’t mind it.
Cas shudders in Dean’s hand, though he doesn’t spill over yet. He immediately claps his hand over Dean’s shoulder and locks his eyes on Dean. It could be a hundred moments they’ve had throughout the years, but there’s never been a moment like this, pleasure and promise interlaced. “We’ll do everything,” Cas gasps, moving his free hand into his underwear too, guiding Dean’s movements.
His tone puts a deep chill through Dean’s spine. It’s the same voice he used when they first found themselves in Purgatory, firm and commanding. The one that reminds Dean of
Over the next couple of weeks, Dean sells off most of the artifacts in the storage closet. He keeps finding trinkets, and fills up whole bags with figurines of every legendary. He doesn’t want the shopkeepers getting suspicious, so he takes them all over Opelucid, at least until one sorta fateful day when Dean walks into Frank’s shop.
“I don’t know. I – try and stay away from that topic. Hurts too damn much. I can’t think about it too much or I’ll lose it.” He laughs, completely black, before he hears his voice break on the next few words. “But it’s
Cas shakes his hand. Cas’ hands are so big and warm, and Dean feels stupidly giddy just from their palms touching. Then, he looks at Dean, still heavily intense, and asks, “Where’s the Paras hut?”
okay. Better at faking it, sure, but every memory was the heat of flames and his body aching and his fingers curled around the metal of a gun, Sammy’s body slumped against his own. Every moment was shot crimson with blood.
A man can only take so much. Dean’s orgasm rips the breath right out of him. It’s a sudden motion, like being knocked on his ass, leaving him lightheaded and shaking. Cas is normally kind of gross about Dean’s come, wants him to mark it on his back or across his thighs, and he’ll pull away when he’s just about done blowing Dean so he can anoint his face with it. Like his skin has a damn craving. But this time, Dean’s caught too off-guard, and he finishes right in Cas’ ass.
It’s never gonna stop being fucking weird that no matter how much they take, no matter the number of people they drag along with them from camp, and no matter how many loud conversations they have while walking down the aisles, there are people all conked out on the corn syrup that just stare at them. Sometimes they stand stock-still in the middle of an aisle, but sometimes they’re already collapsed on the floor. Creepy as hell, whatever position the poor suckers managed to find themselves in.
stupid. He knows a bad situation when he’s dunked into one. God knows enough people tried to lure him to back alleys when he was growing up, and even if they managed to separate him from what would be a very furious Vaporeon, they still met the business end of Dean’s frankly awesome left hook.
“Why are you denying all this? Dean, look, I’m here for you and I always will be. You know that. But so’s Cas, and don’t pretend that’s not like, the number one thing you want. He really cares about you, Dean.”
for someone so damn large and scary. “Taking advice from Lucifer’s kid,” he mutters, mostly to himself, but Kelly can’t help but overhear him.
Cas finally looks away from Dean. His profile, again, is gorgeous in the light; his eyelashes skim his cheek when he says, “No.”
He just nods in response, because there’s nothing else to say when an angel tells you that, that you’re something he needs in his life, and he knows all the fucked-up shit you’ve done and you’re capable of doing, and he just scoffs it off and draws you closer anyway. Dean lets his eyes slip shut, face slack. In this world, he’s never really relaxed, but he’s not so much on edge at least.
Vaporeon’s redirection leads the group to a whole new area, a mass of black tunnels to convoluted they might as well be tied in knots, too narrow for them to fit through in any way other than single file. Dean notices Cas and his siblings carrying their Flying-type Pokemon, because they don’t fit in a perch on their shoulders any more.
say.” He tries to smile, he really does, but it’s like his muscles have forgotten the emotion entirely and atrophied.
When they break apart at last, Anna closes her eyes, and lets the wind whip up around her. It catches hold of her arms and torso and stretches them out and out and up, until she’s a shimmering behemoth floating a few feet above them. Dean’s seen her in this form a few times by now, and he still always has to catch his breath at the damn majesty of it all.
“Dad was gone, Sam was gone. I had Vaporeon, always have Vaporeon, but it was the loneliest I ever felt. I
, before she thuds the heel of her boot right into Lucas’ side. Gabriel hocks a truly impressive loogie onto his prone body.
, just to defend his masculinity. He’s realizing now that it ain’t worth it if it means hiding who he is and what he wants, so all he does is laugh. He swings an arm over Cas’ shoulder and draws him closer, the two of them shuffling until they reach Sam’s room.
“I know, I know, I was gone for years,” Gabriel interrupts Dean’s internal monologue. The fact that the two of them ever shared a thought at any point is a bit disturbing. “But that’s where we differ. My brother – well, a big part of his life has been figuring out who he should be loyal
Cas props himself up on one elbow. “We’ll tell him everything – that you feel comfortable sharing, at least. We’ll see what he does.”
Dean lets a smile stretch over his face, until it snaps back fast. He’s going to pretend he doesn’t see Charlie’s eyebrows go up at that. Can’t get discouraged now. “So, when you do your hacking. What exactly… are you hacking?”
“You strategist, you,” Dean teases, grinning. They march up together, out of sight of the rest of the group. Sam, Anna, Charlie, Amy. Dean’s lost track of all of them. He just hopes they’re alright.
“Uh.” The only thing Dean goes shopping for is groceries, and he’s not great at that because he’s always buying, like, zucchini instead of cucumbers, and Sam has a fit about it. “I don’t do that.”
There’s an adjustment in their positions, and then – Dean may be all post-orgasm groggy and Cas is stumbling his way to sleep too, but those damn eyes of his still light Dean up inside.
The taste of it, and Cas’ deep groan the second his orgasm hit him, is gonna provide spank bank material for Dean’s entire life. If he doesn’t just have Cas right there with him, anyway.
He makes Cas practice on some of the other mostly rusted trucks and cars because no way he trusts the guy with his baby. Plus, if Cas is going above, oh, forty miles per hour, that’s when he tends to start rambling on about ant mating habits and not paying attention to the road, and Dean’s real grateful for Cas’ angel powers; it’d suck to make it through Purgatory and this fucked-up brave new world only to die in a giant fiery wreck.
, like he can’t stand to see Dean helpless and stuck to the ground any more than Dean could watch Vaporeon get hit by any attack and writhe around on the floor of a gym, right before passing out.
, at least until she carried her transcript through the nursery one day. Lowest grade she ever got was an A-. Dean doesn’t know why he’s so damn proud of that girl, but he is.
“Don’t think I would’ve seen this again without you,” Dean says to Cas, their shoulders knocking together. “Thanks.”
when they talked about Lucas, but anyone could see it in the odd stiffness of their shoulders and jawlines.
“Us?” Mary echoes. There’s a fierce hope alight in her eyes, until she looks over her shoulder and catches a glimpse of Dean and Cas, together. “Cas, is that – are you –”
“Nah. I can. Used to it, you know.” That’s no solution either, but Dean’s spent a good portion of his life catching rest on stuff way less suited for sleep than that sofa. Cas’ mouth pops open, and Dean’s sort of impressed that he’s able to keep talking and not find himself too distracted by its proximity and the shiny spot on the bottom lip. “I insist. Seriously.”
For his part, Gabriel’s Whimsicott has managed to curl his way into a corner, and he’s staring at what’s in front of him with a big frown. They’re naturally expressive Pokemon, so normally Dean might find his tiny cartoon face kind of funny, but the situation – well, it just isn’t.
“I don’t think you have to worry about that.” She’s smiling, and it would be the right moment for Dean to tell her that he’s got his own stories of what happens if you grow up
He contemplates kicking one of the legs of Meg’s chair, but he’s pretty sure that’d just be proving her point. So he just crosses his arms and tries not to glare at anyone who says anything.
He looks out at Krissy. She looks less agitated now. Dean’s got his hand on her shoulder, and whatever he’s saying, she’s listening. Good, that’s good. “Krissy and Aiden, they were a great hunting team. From what she’s told me, which isn’t much, she was the bait for the dragon, and he was going in to kill it. Brits showed up, took out the dragon.” She looks away. Her eyelashes slip against her cheek. “Took out Aiden. She saw everything.”
It’s never a good thing when conversations around the camp, especially with the angels, start going like this. “Uh, hi, Chuck,” Dean greets, and the smile just gets bigger. Okay, Dean’s officially freaked out, because the only smiles he ever remembers seeing on Chuck’s face were way too nervous, more suggestions of smiles than the real thing. “Long time no see?”
He’s tired, so tired, but an entire night of sleep seems like an ocean away. There’s so much to do here, right now.
into the touch, and he’s still shaking when Dean pulls his fingers away. The air feels like too much space as it slips between them, so he puts them back on Cas’ sides and crushes his chest to the angel’s as he kisses him, again.
As for Snorlax, well, she’s back to sleeping all the time, which is actually the best sign possible for a recovery. Hypno’s gotten enough of her facilities back to lead a tiny pack of Drowzee. People normally get a little freaked by a Hypno showing too much self-determination, so they try to keep her and the group out of the way of too many visitors, but Dean smiles when he sees her deciding for a group of Pokemon on where to go next, even if the answer is something like
. That’s their family, and it’s been ripped apart piece by piece. He’s not planning on starting an angel fan club any time soon, for the most part, but hey, he gets it. And all that loss is mostly due to his own shit, if he’s being honest.
parents,” Naomi continues. “Not biological ones. I erased your memories. Gothitelle and I.” Gothitelle continues to levitate a few inches above the ground, silently. Unblinking. “I made sure you were in a place where I could keep an eye on you.”
Dean’s laughing at something or other when he signs off, until he finds himself staring back at his own reflection as the screen powers down. Ain’t a bad reflection, he knows that. But it is a lonely one, a lot of the time.
, but he feels good enough to sing. A tiny, nagging part of his brain suggests that this is just the first part of insanity, but it feels better than the other options. Maybe he can go be one with the moths with Cas, or some shit.
“Hey,” Dean says. He doesn’t even think about it before sitting right next to Cas on the bed. It’s almost comically close, but their sides squish up against each other and that’s what Dean needs right now. “I told Mom and Sam about us. They took it really well.”
“It’s great, Cas,” he gets out eventually, and he steps right up against him. The angel’s eyes go wide, but thankfully there is no other reaction.
Nancy’s still sitting up on the hill. She’s shuffling her feet, inching closer to Aurorus. When Dean looks at her, she averts her eyes, embarrassed.
He keeps his eyes shut to kiss Cas, but there’s a pleasant, if funny, lurch in his stomach when he senses the flash of vibrant electric blue behind his eyelids. When his eyes open again, Cas as Dean knows him is standing right there.
And Krissy – something’s very different with Krissy. Not just the hair. Sam considers himself an expert on that, thanks. It’s the too-breezy attitude, the hand-waving so broad she’s actually smacking people. Her persona, all bravado. Shit, she’s reminding Sam of –
“Do you ever think about the shit you didn’t know?” Dean will ask later, when Cas has morphed back and they’re sitting side-by-side on one of the gentle green slopes outside the city. Cas bought a picnic basket with him; Dean inevitably gets the munchies after sex, so now he’s trying to juggle eating Cocoa Puffs by the handful while keeping Vaporeon balanced in his lap. “What you didn’t do? How it could’ve changed everything?”
“Hey, crankypants,” Dean says to him, cheery as possible even though he’s still kinda sleepy, tapping his fingers along the back of Cas’ head. Cas just swivels his head and half-glares in confusion, though the look’s more blunted than his usual expression.
came up some time, anyway, is the point. Dean does love him some badass chicks, especially if they’re hot. And Brad Pitt circa 1990 was — okay, he wasn’t awful to look at, either. What?
Those fingertips, they map the backs of his knees, moving up to cup as much of Dean’s hips as they can over his clothes. Over his gut, high enough that it could pass for clinical. They work their way into Dean’s armpits, which is fucking weird, but then again, angel, and Dean’s so blissed out it feels as good as anything else. They skim down the bridge of his nose and over his cheekbones and when Cas’ fingers reach Dean’s forehead, it’s familiar enough to feel like a benediction.
“So I asked him,” Cas continues, almost proudly. “And at first he just kept singing; his songs got stranger and stranger. I had to ask, and I kept asking. Many millennia in the Cage must have changed Lucifer, but I believe he grew tired of my questioning, and left.”
Cas does a blatant double-take, which would be funny if the situation wasn’t so fraught. Double angel grace electrifies the room, but Dean ain’t sure if that’s a stronger force than the tension whizzing between the three of them. Cas’ eyes up arc and over, tracing Castiel’s back, and of course. His wings.
Hypno shoots out another attack. He’s going right for Dean, ignoring Vaporeon entirely. That’s okay, if it means Azazel doesn’t go after Vaporeon; it gives him time to come up with a plan.
Charlie is easy to find because she’s surrounded by a huge group of people, which is completely unsurprising. She has her arm around Gilda, who matches her Floette perfectly with a handmade parasol, hair pulled in two tight pigtails and studded with tiny flowers.  Charlie’s crowd ranges through all ages; there are people who are definitely older and looking sort of sheepish at being stuffed into these costumes, and there are little kids who don’t look like they’ve heard of the word
“Yes, it would also ruin my post-apocalyptic brand of angel-demon Hallmark cards.” The bite in her voice makes the Alpha Vamp actually
Dean laughs, and picks up a handful of sand to hurl at the sea. Vaporeon has been silently trailing him this entire night, but she finally takes up residence at his feet. “Nothin’ bad. It’s all good. That’s just it. Everyone’s happy. I’m happy. And I don’t know what to do with that. I lost you. I lost
All of a sudden, Alex goes quiet, and looks away again, very pointedly. Her breathing’s almost staccato.
The three of them are in the kitchen between one heartbeat and the next. Mary jumps up from her chair, throwing herself bodily in front of Sam. In the middle of a metric fuckton of conflicting and wildly baffling emotions, Dean still gets choked up at that.
He stands up, and starts pacing the length of the kitchen. None of this is coming naturally to him, and he’s gotta keep himself distracted so he doesn’t lose his nerve. “Think I’m realizing, though,” he says, Vaporeon at his heels, confused but trailing anyway, “it’s not about need. It’s about who I
“Friggin’ malls,” Dean grumbles. He walks by one hell of an outlandish advertisement, framed with blinking fluorescents and portraying a Salamence and Dragonite engaged in fierce battle over a sporting goods warehouse, of all things. A Flaaffy bleats at him as they pass by a grooming kiosk. There are a few balloons, big and shiny and in the shape of round Pokemon like Voltorb and Wailmer, tied to the kiosk; they bounce into each other as Dean walks by and their foil coverings spark light all over the walls. “I hate ‘em.”
like Sam, way shorter and the hair’s too neat and even, but it still makes Dean’s heart seize up – toting a sign with
It happens in a flash – literally. The pink light bursts from Whimsicott’s figure, smashing into Dragonite. At the moment of contact, it turns into silver spheres that go skidding across Dragonite’s hide, looking like new shiny coins. They bounce across her flesh a few times, jolting, irregular, until they crash into her skin again.
“Sweet talker.” Cas thinks that will be all Dean says, but he surprises him – Dean is always, always surprising him, frequently in the best ways – by continuing. “I never thought – I mean, God, when you walked into that barn when Bobby and I summoned you, I was scared out of my mind, however much I tried to hide it –”
Despite the rain, there are no distinct clouds that Dean can see. Instead, the sky’s a screaming, damn near apocalyptic pink-orange. The last of the sun sinks into the flat horizon, and the entire world glows with its light. Every raindrop looks like a crystal until it splatters on the ground and breaks the illusion.
He catches glimpses of Kelly sometimes, or Jack. In the enormous mirror of his eyes, Jack turns every world into a wonder; Kelly, for her part, just looks freaked to hell. Dean always thought she was a pretty smart lady.
Now sober, Dean does a double take when he sees Castiel. The way he was strung up before, it’s nothing compared to now. His head and his wings are the only parts of him not wrapped in gleaming chains. Every movement he does, it catches the light.
Seems like the rain’s gonna keep falling no matter where he is. The morning after the ghoul hunt in Amarillo, he woke up in the motel to sheets of rain sloughing down the window. The remnants of a hurricane blowing through, but they’d be gone soon. It was still so hot out there that steam hovered a good foot above the ground, but the rain kept pouring. He thought of Krissy, hoped she was on her way back to Josephine, and actually sent her a goddamn text about it, because he was going to keep in touch with people before it was too late.
Warmth shoots through him once again, suddenly. He lands heavy on his back on a hard floor that he’s pretty sure isn’t even wood, but stone. All the breath is punched out of him, with no warning.
“Cas,” Naomi calls out as Dean’s heading away. He ignores it at first, not out of malice this time but because he figures she must be confused, and because the name swells grief inside him. “Cas would still fight for me, wouldn’t he.”
“I can explain,” she says, attempting to hold her hands up to placate Anna and Cas. All it gets her is Anna fixing her harder against the wall. “You guys are why I’m in the hospital anyway. Well, two of you. Who’s the hunk? New meat for Zachariah and Naomi? Guess he got all the good genes in the family.”
“I needed one damn day off from schmoozing those rich donors,” she gripes. “Glad to see you boys having fun.”
, and he’s already feeling kinda grouchy about the presumptuousness, but all Sam does is reel him in against his chest with one of his enormous arms.
Sometimes, he likes to pretend he smells hot cherry pie in the air, or the engine grease and wax that’d stick to him when he was working on or buffing the Impala. But the Purgatory air is too crisp, its coldness buried too deep inside his skin. There’s no pie, no Impala, and no Sammy.
, he’s with Meg, and if he thinks about how much that reminds him of the Ruby situation it’ll make him vomit all over the forest floor. And he hasn’t even eaten anything in, God, he doesn’t even know when.
at that, his own skin almost as hot as Castiel’s. “You sure do know how to make a guy feel special,” he says. Always shuffling off actual feelings with humor before they can take root in him too deeply. Best not to get too attached, is what he’s learned, as much as he wants it.
“I expect to make a visit or two, yes.” Dean’s heart thuds funky, like it’s not sure how to take that.
“You like your understatements, Cas.” Everything unsaid hangs between them, and fizzes away like bubbles when they’re like this.
“’Course not,” Dean laughs. He’s come to value his life, after all. “Just thinkin’ about all the lives we don’t know out there. How I helped some of ‘em. How I didn’t.”
“Thought you said you never wanted to see me again,” Gabriel says to the newcomer. Dean recognizes her tone because it’s the one he speaks in far too often, that false bravado.
Dean is warmth personified, in his smiles and his hands and the way his eyes crinkle, the heartbreaking amount of care he has for everyone on this earth. Cas still tries to emulate that. But right now, Dean is
There’s a wolf-whistle behind them, sharp in what’s mostly silence. (Dean can hear a lot of muttering, but fuck that.) Couldn’t be Sammy, the guy’s probably covering his eyes with his hand still. Probably friggin’ Meg, if she’s around the camp.
Dean puts his hand on the fleshy part of Cas’ ass and squeezes, affectionate. “I’ll show you feeling.”
“I thought I had to stay with Jack for the greater good –” Dean must pull a face at that, because Cas just glowers harder, and his voice drops down half an octave. “I hurt you. I know that. And I’m
“Sleep Powder!” Gabriel calls out. Whimsicott makes a damn acrobatic leap over the shifting glare, leaving a trail of powder in his wake, but the powder just dissolves right into its form with no effect at all. Halfway through his jump, Whimsicott hits some kind of invisible wall, and he spirals right into the morass of screeching white below.
that Thaddeus douche, who’s sporting a bandage on his nose and a blooming purple bruise around his eye.
His Grace is gone. This vessel’s spirit has passed on and he’s alone in this body. He kisses back and goes hot anew.
Dean whirls around to see Cas, who was way closer than he was expecting. “I believe I’d be able to sense my brothers and sisters if they’d been here,” he explains. “But no — there’s no sign of them, and I can’t sense Kevin anywhere.”
Still, it was easy to brush the sentiment off as familial. Especially with Sam and Mom there. They were the buffer that meant Dean didn’t have to explore his feelings too deeply, didn’t have to put anything on the line just to inevitably lose it. Just to inevitably get his heart broken for caring. For needing, for wanting.
Dean’s silent for a while, watching Staraptor sky-bomb a couple of spare Swellow and Masquerain out of the air. It’s graceful, even while her wings are spattered with dust. Makes Dean think of nothing more than Vaporeon’s easy water arcs. The area before him blurs, and it ain’t because of the dust. He can’t say anything to Bobby, because he doesn’t know how to put it into words.
There’s something in his poise, though, that reminds her of the snobbiest jerks she had the displeasure of meeting from the British Men of Letters. It’s a damn miracle she doesn’t run away screaming at that.
They don’t bother to circle each other; they just make a crazed rush toward the center, where they meet in a flurry of limbs and awful metallic sounds as their swords clash. Normally, Mary knows, elbows to the face and hard kicks from a human won’t do shit to an angel, but she’s got the wards powering them down.
Psychic-types are no different from other Pokemon; hell, he defended Espeon for years. It’s just a little different when you find yourself face-to-face with a creature that’s six feet high, with a perpetually angry glare.
When the weather gets a little better, to pass the time, Dean tries to teach Cas to drive. It’s a terrible idea and he knows it, but he doesn’t stop. It’ll be useful eventually, is his excuse. Cas gets behind the wheel and huffs that there is no point to these
, because his entire life has been one big warning against any kind of relaxation. But he’s sure gonna enjoy this small moment of respite, the two of them tangled tight together while sleep tugs at his eyelids.
Only – no, that isn’t it. Dean has his own home now; he has real friends. When he was on the road with Sam and Dad, all he had was his brother, and that relationship was so mixed up in his dad’s orders to
.” Dean’s heard enough people talk through voice distorters – oh, the benefits of having everyone in your life be a completely paranoid bastard – that he knows this is one of them.
“Anyway, I’m not interested in your particular failings. Humans are so disappointing in so many ways. Except myself and my friends.” This guy’s a winner, that’s for sure. “I’m Marv. You don’t know me. Cas, though – he just might. His dad’s been bankrolling me for
Dean does look. He sees all these people, all these people he loves, all these people he loves so happy – and he’s suddenly making his way out of the tent, pushing friends and strangers alike out of the way, because it feels too damn small.
Thankfully, Cas himself interrupts Dean’s thoughts. “Would you like some honey?” he asks, brightly, strange glint back in his eyes as he pulls the little baggy out of his coat pocket.
Cas’ only reaction is a nod. He’ll be upset later, Dean knows. He’s the kind of person who’s all stoic and starin’ off into the middle distance in the moment, but then later spends hours pouring sweat and beating his knuckles into raw meat on a punching bag at the gym.
The kitchen’s quiet for a long time after that. No one even pretends to eat anything, or read the books spilling over the table. They’re just – real fuckin’ quiet.
Dean beams. “Man after my own heart.” The smile collapses when he realizes how accurate that statement is.
Dean squirms at that, which is kinda pathetic, but it ain’t out of discomfort. Cas slides his hand up, pausing over Dean’s heart. It thuds right under Cas’ fingers. The two of them keep staring at each other. Cas’ hand moves up and up, until it’s around the back of Dean’s neck. Pulling him closer.
Cas always grips him inside so tight. The guy’s made handjobs into a damn art, but his ass is an even firmer hold than his fist. Pulling out and pushing back in is an effort, even as lubed up as both of them are. Neither of them wants to separate from each other, not even for a second.
But everything else is still the same, pretty much. They still spend way too much time with Sam, who got halfway through his girly-ass
Cas shows no sign of not believing Dean, though, and even though he immediately showed Dean a picture of Anna he doesn’t ask why Dean doesn’t show him a picture of Sam. “You proud of him?”
“This is a very public place,” Cas notes. Tamara, of all people, takes a step back when Cas casts his look on her. Whoah.
Dean asks Sam or Mary to go to the basement for him. If Castiel says anything to either one of them, important or not, they don’t mention it. The two of them won’t stop giving Dean pointed looks, which he shrugs off best he can, but at least they don’t ask why he’s not going to the dungeon himself. He can be thankful for any small mercies.
He recognizes that his body is crawling toward the wall, desperate and helpless to do anything but curl closer and closer and closer to it, but it seems so distant. Dean wants to call on Vaporeon to do something, anything, but when he opens his mouth the only noise that comes out is the hissing sound, no change in pitch or sign of inflection. The noise, the light, it’s swallowing him. There’s going to be no room left soon, and they’ll be gone too, it’ll just be – whatever the hell this is –
Cas looks around. “You’re in the hospital,” he says, in a tone that makes it very clear how evident he considers that statement. “I’d prefer you anywhere else.”
“You seein’ this, Vaporeon,” he asks. He doesn’t take his eyes off the sight in front of him, but he hears a happy trill in response. Even Staraptor outright coos.
“Yes. We’ve got other, superior resources. I’m sure you remember my Pokemon.” With one flick of his wrist, Lucas’ Hydreigon materializes from her Poke Ball. Dean’s always thought Hydreigon were awesome. This is the first time he’s seen one in real life and not just on television with some of the top battlers, even now that he’s living in Dragon-hungry Opelucid.
that passes between them. Dean glances around after the nod, desperate for some Elekid nearby to explain it, but no. It’s just his damn feelings.
Mary pulls at Castiel, breaking him from his thoughts. He looks up, and his robes slide off his face. The sun hits him, and he growls. The sun’s been blocked out for thousands of years in his universe.
Wearily, Vaporeon summons up one more Hydro Pump. It’s bigger than they have been the past few minutes, a good sign, but all that happens is Tentacruel’s advancing wave swallow it right up. The blue and white of the water shatters against the fetid purple of the poison. Now it’s Dean’s turn to dive, trying to shove Vaporeon out of the way – he’s never, not ever, used this much force against her – but she doesn’t budge.
Mostly, though, Dean’s pissed because the assholes keep handling the Pokemon. They’re not careful about it, either, scooping them up with both hands while not supporting their bottom halves, so the poor little guys wriggle desperately. “Can you all watch out?” he hisses, a little too loud, which gets him exponentially more glares. Shit.
Michael’s another young staff member, really just a kid. They find him trudging through a swampy area, inspecting a group of Rhyhorn huddled in a mud pit and shooing away bothersome Yanma. Even though his name makes Cas pull a face, briefly, this Michael is nothing like Cas’ shitty brother.
Marv doesn’t even react. “Your own little platoon, how charming,” is what he says. He’s looking straight at Victor, with a look in his eye that Dean doesn’t like at all. “But I’ll be damned if I sit in a jail cell and rot forever while you all ruin everything we’ve planned so meticulously.” The next gesture he makes is curious, arms straight out and palms turned up. He looks up at the ceiling, and the fucking asshole grins. “Steelix.
Cas raises his gaze to look straight at Dean. “Let’s get out of here,” he says, and even though they’re in a sunny, delectable-smelling kitchen, even though Jody and all their Pokemon are around, the world falls back and away until it’s just the two of them, Cas’ unreal blue eyes cutting through everything else.
Dean wonders what the hell kind of argument they’re talking about while the two Castiels size each other up with twin blue glares. Neither looks like they’re an immediate threat to the other, but Dean’s also pretty sure they’re not gonna start holding hands and singing Kumbaya together either. Stuck in a stalemate.
Most people his age have only had their Pokemon for a couple of years, and they’re still getting used to them before they head off to college to learn how to battle properly. Dean, on the other hand, has been fighting with Vaporeon for a full decade now, fudging his age on applications to training gyms and even tournaments. He’s gotten old, crappy dollar bills stuffed in his hands for coming in second and third and fourth – never first, he’s not good enough for that – too many times to count, ducked his head and said thanks, and ran off with Vaporeon to the nearest PokeCenter.
with Dean even over some point in the plan, Cas paused so he could… look at him, like he had outside the car, awe in his eyes and something else in the tilt of his mouth. Just — happiness, is what it was. At this point, it had been weird to see.
“Jack wanted to see you,” Cas tells Sam, very seriously, once Sam’s released the two of them from his monster death-grip.
“They are wonderful and awful,” Cas agrees, and Dean could swear his heart skips a beat at the fondness in his tone.
The two Pokemon take to the air. They circle around each other, two natural predators looking for any kind of opening, any moment they can seize.
that’s weird to say, it’s the love of Dean’s life. And they only had that one kiss, quiet and dark and too chaste, too. Well — on Earth.
It’s just a long shift, he tells himself. With Cas. He’s worked with him before. It’s going to suck, but he’s going to get through it with minimal awkwardness. He can do it.
Sam catches a glimpse of Dean’s face. A slash of dirt stands out on his cheek, and he’ll be complaining about it after the hunt’s done, but for now it just makes him look more feral. He’s breathing hard, but his expression makes Sam’s breath catch with horror. There’s
The crowd gathered at the wedding is huge. Everyone on their side in the Battle of Opelucid shows up, even people Gabriel only met at the police station afterward. The big shocker on the guest list has to be Naomi; Dean and Cas weather many questions about why she’s there. All they can answer with, honestly, is, “Well, you know Gabriel and her whims.”
And Cas is being even stupider, because he knows. He has to know. God knows that night clings to Dean’s memories, a fine mist over everything else in his brain that’s impacted the very way he sees the world. After it happened, he spent weeks looking over his shoulder for Alastair, but then when the worry ebbed, he started looking over his shoulder for Castiel. Dean didn’t believe in fate or any of that shit, but he figured meetings like that just don’t happen if you’re not meant to meet again.
And if that’s a friggin’ chick flick moment, well, Dean never said it out loud, just curled closer to Castiel and totally cuddled.
, like yeah his mouth is warm and tight the way the Impala is kinda cool, or the Leviathan are a little bit creepy, but it’s also the nearly reverent way his eyes flutter half-shut. His mouth is slack enough — fuckin’ pretty, to be honest, just wrecked enough — to fit around his dick, and tight enough to make stars flutter behind Dean’s eyes every time the guy decides to twist his tongue, even just experimentally.
Claire slips her phone into the pocket of her leather jacket, because she digs being a cliché sometimes, and slides into the shotgun seat in Abigail’s car, a Honda Accord – how embarrassing – from a couple of years ago, with Carina curled up in the backseat, snoring loudly.
“We could, and I’m sure she could do it, but – Dean. You can tell there’s something deeper going on here, right?” She sounds frightened, a tone Dean doesn’t hear from her much. Tessa’s got a damn Absol at her side; she doesn’t scare easy.
Dean’s met the woman who occasionally inspects the nursery, and other properties on Edlund’s campus. Her name’s Linda, and even though she’s almost a full head shorter than Jody, she carries herself like she could seriously kick anyone’s ass at any given moment. Most of her inspections are spent laughing warmly with Jody or Tessa. Dean’s pretty sure Vaporeon has a huge crush on her Greninja, who loves to take big hops from one enclosure to the next and scoop the baby Pokemon under his arms.
Jo huffs out an irritated little noise. “Dean, I know what you’re thinking, and don’t be ridiculous, please.” Dean adores Jo, honestly he does, but he’s noticed she’s becoming more and more like her mom, which means both awesome and
Dean wastes too much time watching television anyway, but now that he’s been told by both doctors and Cas that he has to
“Bullshit, Cas,” Dean spits out. Cas blinks hard at that, and his head jerks back just a few degrees. Good. “I talked to him because I was trying anything I could to get my
Anna pulls Cas aside; Dean lets them be. He just watches them nodding together, speaking soft and low. They’re wearing sad smiles, but they’re still smiles.
Bobby’s new place isn’t very far from the Roadhouse, so Dean swings by to see Ellen. Dean feels pretty lame some of the time that he saved the universe and his circle of friends didn’t really expand much, but he kinda sucks at trying to have
He pauses there, and Dean takes the opportunity. Edging his way in closer, he hugs Cas around the middle. “Feel like an octopus,” he grunts against Cas’ shoulder.
Cas nods in recognition at one of the guards. Dean’s seen pictures of Naomi, and this woman isn’t her, but she’s got the stern demeanor he’d imagine Naomi carries too. The fact that she’s flanked by a friggin’ Garchomp probably isn’t buying her any friendship points, either. Both Garchomp and the guard set dual shark-like stares on Dean and Cas.
When Dean pulls off, Cas is still all floppy legs and arms on the bed, chest swelling up and tightening back against his ribcage. His skin’s gone bright red in patches, which is freaky appealing. If Dean wasn’t too busy tugging his own pants down, sighing frankly embarrassingly deeply in relief at the loosening pressure around his erection, he’d roll his tongue over every one of those marks; Cas’d be shiny when he pulled back, and only the two of them would know about it.
