The next morning, the scent of pup wakes Dean again. This time, he opens his eyes immediately and sees the ice blue eyes of Castiel’s daughter in the same place she was yesterday, regarding him solemnly.
“I’m fine, Dean,” Cas assures him softly. “They surprised me, that’s the only reason it’s this bad.”
Castiel doesn’t have the luxury of time dulling the memory of his turning. Of his mother, a woman he had once loved, screaming in Russian as she hit him over and over, the way the ground felt beneath his bare knees, the sound his ribs made as they cracked in his chest. The soft, distressed cries from Anna as his sister called out to his mother to try to stop her.
So, a few years, a few dogs, a lot of healing, and about a thousand blowjobs down the road, when Cas asked, in his soft, gentle way, if he could show Dean something, of fucking
Joshua was a kind, loving soul. Gentle in all things, in touch and manner and voice, he was everything Naomi has never been. He was, quite simply, everything a frightened, aching, absolutely clueless young man on the run had needed.
But Bartholomew left his family rich, and shrewd investment decisions by Naomi have kept them that way. She also uses her husband’s good name, as well as the numerous charitable contributions she’s made to various organizations, to further her and her children as she sees fit.
The lower level, while not wall-to-wall people like the dance floor is, is pretty damned crowded. Anna, the cocktail server, is an angel on heels as she glides between and through throngs of patrons. She’s graceful and unobtrusive as she moves.
When he turns, Cas is staring down at the pile of fabric in front of him in consternation. From what Dean saw while he and Claire were sorting, all but one or two were fairly simple projects, and from what he can see now, they all look to be done.
How he got from that, to getting caught, to Mr. N pulling him aside, to sobbing in Mr. N’s arms in a tiny office while he wailed about missing his mother, Kevin will never really understand. He knows, though, that Mr. N started letting him come in after that, started texting him about homework and new shoes and “come here for dinner, please, I’ve made far too much.” Mr. N and Mr. W introduced him to the crew at The Bunker, the people who have become his family. Mr. W helped him get his driver’s license, buy a car, and talked him through the first panic attack he had when he wanted to ask a girl out.
It’s not a bad offer, even if it’s not a particularly compelling one, either. But the sight of his mom’s signature on the original contract hits Dean like a punch in the gut. His sentimentality over this, something she clearly wanted to keep intact, probably would have gotten him to sign no matter what. Getting someone as hot as Cas in his office is really just a bonus.
They both turn to look at Claire. She’s standing just in front of the little fireplace, her wide blue eyes imploring, a book clutched to her chest like a shield. Dean feels his own heart clench, he can’t imagine how Cas feels at the sight.
After that, it’s a blur of clothes flying off, Cas’ desperate, bratty demands, and Dean going with the flow. They end up with Dean shirtless, on his back, with his jeans and boxers pulled down to mid-thigh. Above him, Cas’ shirt is unbuttoned and hanging loose, framing his thin chest and flat belly rather nicely. His pants and briefs are on the floor, where he has one foot braced. The other leg is wedged between the backseat and Dean’s hip.
Cas shudders and wraps a hand around the back of Dean’s neck, kissing him hard. Dean arches and moans. He gives as good as he gets and before Cas knows it, Dean is pulling them up the stairs, one hand in Cas’ hair and the other fisted in the front of his shirt. It’s easy to forget that Dean is as strong as he himself is now.
Castiel smiles because Dean is ridiculous, but he’s also wonderful, and Castiel loves him very much. “Thank you.”
So he’s kind of surprised that Sam knows about the Walker deal at all, much less that he knows enough to be freaked out by whatever he heard.
But I know now, I did some thinking, just like you would, and I know he was just an experiment. You wanted to be good for me, you wanted to be sure.” The smile on his face is warm, kind, and absolutely devoid of any sanity that Cas can find. His hands start to tremble and breathing steadily is difficult.
It’s Halloween, though, so Castiel doesn’t begrudge his brother his fun. Not that Gabriel has some sort of deficit of fun in his life, but All Hallow’s Eve has a special place in both of their hearts, and has for the last hundred and fifty years.
Dean is still talking. “She looks up to you, Cas, so fuckin’ much. I think she just didn’t want you to see her struggling. She doesn’t want you to think she’s weak or something.”
“I said I’ll take care of everything and I meant it,” Cas says, smiling and cupping Dean’s face in his wet hands. “Go lay down, alpha, I’ll join you when this is done.”
Dean kisses the base of his spine. “Yeah? You think so, sweetheart?” he asks, his voice rough and low and smug.
His focus right now, however, must be on Dean, not revenge. He pushes the anger to the back of his mind.
“You were a very easy patient,” the omega assures him as he watches long, thin, capable fingers treat his injured leg.
He has no idea how long it takes for Dean’s hips to come flush with his ass, but it feels like a long time. He realizes dimly that Dean is running soothing hands up and down his sides, and that he’s murmuring praise and encouragement softly.
“I know you’re frustrated,” Dean says softly, “but we’re gonna figure this out, Cas, I promise.” Dean lays a gentle kiss on the back of Cas’ neck. “Let's get a few hours of shut-eye, then we’ll get back to it in the morning, okay?”
Later, after Cas bids him goodnight and shuts the door, Dean glares at the dark ceiling and wishes he had a mirror so he could be glaring at himself, instead.
“The board is…” John grunts and runs a hand down his ace. For the first time, Dean thinks about how old his dad really is. “The board has decided to move forward with hiring someone from outside the company to take my position when I leave.”
“Shh, whatever it is, it’s okay, we’ll handle it together. We can do anything together, really, I think. So whatever is happening, we’ll
anyone like Cas, much less involved with them. Cas is so unabashedly open, affectionate, and loving. He heaps physical touch onto Dean like it’s the last thing he’ll ever do, and Dean soaks it up like an abandoned puppy - needy, shameless, greedy for it.
Dean’s heart is thundering in his chest. He wants to put a hand to his cheek, he wants to run out of the room (an instinct he ruthlessly squashes out), he wants to curl himself around her and promise her every single thing he can think of.
He shouldn’t have underestimated his omega, though, because Cas responds beautifully. The hand still resting on Dean’s face slides back to clench in his hair, and Cas arches his back to press closer to Dean. Without thinking, since his higher brain function has deserted him, he rolls them so he’s pressing Castiel down into the mattress. He panics for a brief moment that he’s gone too far, but Cas wraps his arms around Dean’s neck and pulls him back down into another hot kiss.
Assured that Cas is entertaining Claire far away from the windows, Dean puts on the most ragged clothing he owns and goes to take care of that bastard, Michael.
Charlie blinks and looks around. Sure enough, there are a few people (Mr. W included) who have on bright green t-shirts with the word VOLUNTEER emblazoned on the back. They’re handing out tickets, numbers to pin to the leashes of the contestants, and lists of rules for the owners who have submitted their dogs.
Dean’s hands grip his hips and he starts a fast, hard pace, jolting Cas with each thrust and hitting his prostate head on every second or third thrust. Since they’re alone, Cas makes no attempt to smother his cries, and it seems to drive Dean mad.
and has the added bonus of absolutely smothering Dean in the Novaks’ scent. It also covers him in his own scent. As the days go on, the combined scents start to smell more and more like
only have the one mirror, in my bedroom, but it’s rather high, and I’m not sure you’re quite up to standing for that long yet.”
Gabe sighs. “An asylum. An old one, so we’re getting a lot of reverbs from the past as well as the current residents right now. That’s why it’s so strong.”
Colonel’s growling grows louder, more pointed, and Dean says coldly, “One word outta you and I shoot, you got that, pal?”
Dean is rolling his eyes irreverently. “You’re such an asshole,” he says, but the blush that’s spread across his chest and up his neck reveals his arousal as surely as his hard, leaking cock.
Dean nods. He obviously doesn’t believe Castiel, but since it’s the best lie he can come up with right now, they both let it go.
“Whatever you say, babe,” Dean says easily. He flops down onto the pillow, then tugs Cas until his back is flush against Dean’s chest. Now that Dean is a vampire, too, he isn’t quite as burning hot as he used to be against Cas’ skin. It’s better now, more comfortable. He’s warm, and his arm is firm when it wraps around Cas’ waist, holding him close.
Deciding that the lost limb is worth the risk, Dean wraps a hand around the back of Cas’ neck and yanks him forward to kiss him hard, firmly, dominating. Cas struggles for only a beat before he relaxes into it, kissing back fiercely. His hands clench in Dean’s oh-so-recently fixed collar.
And Mr. N makes sure he’s warm, along with everyone else, with his soft, worried blue eyes and his soft, handmade hats.
He agreed to the job offer before he’d really thought it through. He’s grateful every day that he did.
- (In case anyone was wondering, SIL and baby are doing very well! I've crocheted out some of my anxiety.)
Sheriff ketch holds his hands up as if in surrender. “Now, now, no need to get heated, I’m not implying anything. Just saying that alphas seem to have
“Don’t,” a very familiar voice says, and Cas freezes. “Just… Don’t, all right? I don’t want to do this,
"I'm sorry," he says gravely, trying to put as much sincerity as he can into the words, "that that awful person lied to you about how beautiful and brilliant you are."
He washes Dean tenderly from the top of his head to the bottom of his feet. Each of his muscles is given a thorough rub down and washing until Dean is a puddle in Cas’ capable hands.
He will never be able to tell them out loud how much he appreciates it that they’ve come, the loyalty they’ve shown. Not only because they wouldn’t hear it, anyway, but because there are no words.
Dean can barely hear his brother over the sound of the air whipping past them as they race past the last few buildings on the main street of whatever two-horse town they stopped at (he can’t even remember the name of the place), but he nods in the affirmative. He can’t keep his lip from rising in a snarl as the pain from his left leg starts to throb in earnest.
He doesn’t get the first word out before she moves, and then they’re fighting. She’s been doing it longer, and probably more recently, but Castiel is stronger, faster, and has the gift of leverage. They fight like a dance, moving too fast for eyes to properly take in, and Castiel loses himself in it again.
Cas doesn't hesitate to go to Dean, who rather gratifyingly doesn't hesitate to open his arms and wrap them around Cas tight, burying his face in Cas' neck.
The last word falls between them like a rock, which is fitting because Dean feels like a bottom-feeder when he says it. He knows, though, what he has to do. It’s going to break his heart, and he may never properly recover, but Cas doesn’t deserve to live with the consequences of Dean’s actions anymore than he’s already had to.
John stands, too, seemingly letting it sink in how serious Dean is. “Dean, son, think about this for a second, now. We can bring the board around if you’re not willing to get a divorce, it will just take-”
Castiel buries his besotted smile in Dean’s hair and fairly drowns in gratitude. “I’m sorry, dearheart.”
Dean straightens up a little. He tenderly takes all of his newfound contentment and folds it away. It feels ungenerous to assume that John will ruin it, but Dean knows it’s true, and he’s not willing to sacrifice the way he feels just to keep his thoughts about his father kind. It’s not like John will ever know, anyway.
Instead of the relaxing, playful, flirtatious experience Dean was anticipating, they’re both tense and drawn. While Dean’s alpha arousal is certainly in the air, so is the sweet, almost cloying scent of omega arousal. Cas is just as affected as Dean is, and he can’t decide if that’s a good thing or a bad thing.
Charlie loves The Pack like they’re her own. She doesn’t have kids yet, though she wants them fiercely, and she can’t have pets in her apartment, so she’s imprinted
“No.” Dean wants to be horrified that John would suggest a divorce instead of sticking up for him, but he can’t bring himself to lie to himself anymore. “No, we can’t, and I don’t want to. I’m done, Dad.”
He feels Dean press his face into Cas’ leg and whimper, so he flips his book page side down and turns all of his attention to Dean.
Besides his scent, though, Cas gives no hints as to what he’s thinking. His fingers are calloused on Dean’s newly exposed skin, and when he uses a towel to dry Dean’s face when he’s finished, his touch is gentle. He still barely looks at Dean, though, and they haven’t spoken a word to one another since Cas came into his own bedroom to help Dean shave.
“Hard to say for sure. Depends on the doctor you’re talking to. He’s got a lot of symptoms, fugue states, auditory and visual hallucinations, you name it.” Her voice shakes with emotion, and Castiel makes the first impulsive decision he’s made in a very, very long time.
“Indeed. I realized she wanted to do the same thing to the boy that she had done to me, and I couldn’t… I couldn’t let that happen. I had failed Anna, but I was strong, now, just as strong as Naomi, at least physically, and I wouldn’t let myself fail this child.
The post office worker, at least, is polite enough to his face. A mild-mannered beta, the man’s eyes are knowing when he posts the letter, but he doesn’t say anything offensive or cruel outright.
Lucifer has been remarkably… Casual about the Lightbringers, their mission, and their worship of him. He behaves mostly as if it’s amusing, which quite frankly boggles Castiel. The First seems to treat most things as though they’re jokes, though. Even this evening when they were gearing up, he made a quip about being “too old for all that” and firmly declined any offer of weaponry.
Castiel nuzzles at Dean’s cheek shamelessly, love making him affectionate and stupid. “You are, by far, the most singularly spectacular being I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing.”
He thinks about Claire, about her innocence, what she’s lost and what she’s kept of it. About her pretty blue eyes and her cute upturned nose.
Dean squeezes him tighter, which seemed impossible a moment before but is now beyond comforting. “Shh, I know, I
While he’s revelling, his phone buzzes, and he frowns down at it quizzically. Dean’s staring, too, and the room has gone silent.
“Claire,” Cas says from the bedroom doorway where he’s appeared again. His voice is a bit strained, his eyes worried. Dean does his best to project an image of “harmless, injured alpha.”
The next few days pass in a cozy haze. Claire is just as affectionate and clingy with Dean as she is with Cas now, always touching one of them somehow. Cas, too, touches Dean more often. Not as often as the pup, but little touches here and there. A brush of their fingers, standing close enough that their shoulders press together, a gentle hand on Dean’s arm when they speak.
“I chose a new name from the books he kept about angels, the name you call me now. Gabriel kept his, because he was, as he put it, ‘already an archangel, how much better could it possibly get?’”
Claire dissolves into giggles again. The day before, she and Cas spent the entire afternoon baking bread for the week. Lighter bread for breakfasts, dark, heavy bread for dinner, and easily crumbled bread as a treat for the cow and chickens. It’s something they do every week, but this week marked two important milestones: Claire was officially old enough to help with the baking, and it was the first baking day since Dean started courting Cas.
to the alpha. Maybe that was part of the reason Cas’ little pallet of blankets is in Claire’s bedroom, so close to her bed, but Cas not saying it out loud still means he’s trying to spare Dean’s feelings. Considering how mercurial the omega has been up ‘till now (not that Dean’s complaining), Dean will take hat he can get and be inordinately grateful.
Adam blinks a couple of times, looking around. The whole damn crew is here, doing a piss-poor job of pretending to work. Except for Charlie, who isn’t even pretending.
Balthazar, however, has proven to be an excellent teacher. Under his watchful eye, Dean has become quite proficient in a wide array of bladed weapons. Balthazar says he’s a fast learner, Dean says it’s easy stuff, and Cas thinks it’s unbearably attractive.
“In conclusion, we realize that the HLSC isn’t Winchester Motors’ normal investment. We’re hoping, however, that our good standing in our current long term agreement will encourage you to sign a renewed contract,” Castiel finishes with a nervous, hopeful smile.
“That’s right,” she says, satisfaction oozing from every syllable, “lay it on thick, my loyal subjects.”
Castiel’s respect for her, not insignificant to begin with, goes up several notches. She must have genuine, strong feelings about Dean Winchester to brush off any compulsion at all, even as weak as what he just did was. Castiel hates that he
So he’s taken quite by surprise when, instead of pressing his back into Dean’s chest as he’s done every time they’ve slept side by side, Cas’ front is pressed to Dean, and he’s looking up at him with a mixture of determination and trepidation that has Dean’s thoughts scattering immediately.
She has been friends with a lot of coworkers, of course. It's hard not to be when you're in the trenches of food service anywhere from twenty to sixty hours a week. A lot of places form a sort of family atmosphere, and she's made some lifelong friends that way.
Dean said yes. Because he’d do goddamn anything for Cas. He’d walk through fire, shoot himself in the leg, drive Baby right off a cliff if Cas wanted him to. Cas is such a loving, soft soul beneath his analytical, too formal exterior, and the fact that he loves Dean’s battered, broken ass means that Cas gets what Cas wants. No question.
Dean’s eyes are intent on his face, and his slow smile is predatory enough to make Castiel feel every inch prey as Dean leans closer to him.
“We were so worried, and no text!” she scolds as she brings them big cups, black coffee for Dean and strong tea with sweetener and milk for Cas.
Cas is busy checking the contents of the basket. “I need you to take Claire to the bedroom and hide with her when Mick comes.”
“So, if they come to you,” Dean says slowly, “and ask if you’ll lead the new world, or whatever, you wouldn’t say yes?”
He tries to tell himself that it doesn’t matter. The chances of his past catching up to him here are slim to none, really, and what good would it do to tell them, anyway? They both have fought so hard to trust him at all, and he wants to destroy that? For what? So he can sleep easier at night? So Cas will be able to knowingly place his full trust in Dean? So that, gods willing, when they mate, they’ll both go in with their whole selves in the others’ palm?
So instead of voicing his thoughts (or worse, swearing to protect both of them from harm forever), Dean grins at Claire. “Everyone belongs in the kitchen, pup. The kitchen is where the food is.”
“Charlie,” he says, voice tight. Dean is sitting up, right next to him, eyes intent on the side of Castiel’s face. “Do you have something?”
to be more than the angry young man he had been at sixteen. He put aside his resentment and opened his eyes to the privilege he had. He’s worked his
The guy is charming, into classic cars and classic rock. He’s objectively good-looking, Dean guesses, and a shameless flirt. He fills out the plain black tee he wears with obvious muscle, too, which will be useful if Benny ever needs backup.
Dean only indulges himself in staring for a beat. There’s no way Cas will miss it, but Dean does his best not to make him uncomfortable. It’s only a few weeks that Dean is staying, but he doesn’t want them to be strained, tense weeks.
case. This is a fiction of a fiction, actually, and we'll need to suspend disbelief together to make this work.
He wanted a birthday party, of course, but this is all about networking. He wouldn’t have let Sam come near this party with a ten-foot pole, but some people Dean trusts almost as much have their eyes peeled. They’re building alliances tonight as well as gathering intel, making friends while simultaneously taking note of who’s misbehaving and how.
a bit of a wild child, Dean.” Before Dean can even open his mouth again, John goes on. “Now, they haven’t
“Yield to me,” he says, and his voice comes out like unforgiving gravel. “It’s over, Naomi, all but the bleeding. You know it as well as I.”
of them trusts him, and they have no reason to. Something terrible happened on this pretty little farm, something that left Cas to care for the both of him on his own however he could. And maybe Cas didn’t do it on purpose, but Dean didn’t miss how the omega made sure to mention that he’s expecting someone to come see them. Someone is expecting Castiel and Claire to be alive an unharmed, and Cas made damn sure Dean knows it.
Castiel is suddenly fervently grateful that Lucifer, who is an ancient and deadly entity, has no higher aspirations than owning a club in Las Vegas. And that he is on their side and, to all appearances, even likes them.
to all of his classes. He’s cut back on smoking, especially since Cas won’t kiss him if he tastes like an ashtray. He’s still quintessentially himself, but he gives Castiel the control he needs by changing things that don’t matter all that much to Dean himself.
Sam’s bickering is cut off by the sharp sound of another gunshot. It goes wide, as far as Dean can tell, but a bad shot still gets lucky once in a while. The bullet in his leg is proof of that.
“Oh, yes. I use the petals to make oils that we sell or trade. Dyes, even, or someone occasionally wants a bouquet, I suppose. So the roses typically pay for themselves.” Sometime during the last few moments, shadows fell across Cas’ blue eyes, and Dean is dying to know why, but the omega barely pauses for a breath before is features are schooled and he’s moving on.
Now that they’re older, his favorite Cas when he’s getting ready for bed in the winter. When it’s cold out, Cas sleeps in old, faded long-sleeved tee-shirts and flannel pajama pants. He’s all warm, cozy softness then, and Dean can’t get enough of it.
Cas widens his legs to let Dean stand between his knees in front of him. Dean’s hands tremble with pain and fury when he cups Cas’ face. Cas lets the ice pack fall away, giving Dean the rest of the picture
Cas’ mouth is firm, warm, and everything Dean has been daydreaming of. They kiss for a long time, slow and gentle, tender and sweet. There’s no heat in it, not now, with both of them so emotional.
“Why didn’t you already have the market cornered on this?” Asa asked once, waving his hand around to indicate the atmosphere of his own bar.
The moment they’re close enough, Dean wraps his arms around Cas and crushes him to his big, solid chest. Cas immediately clasps Dean back just as tightly, tilting his head up to murmur soothing nonsense into his husband’s ear.
“It’s just Claire and I,” he says tightly. He quickly gathers up the mostly-empty dishes and gets up from where he’d sat on the bed. “I’ll come back in at midday, once the garden has been tended,” he says before fleeing the room.
They crawl beneath the covers together and Dean wraps around him like an octopus. Knowing his concentration is shot, Cas doesn’t even consider getting any more work done tonight.
Gabriel stands next to them in a horrific Hawaiian shirt, cargo shorts, and flip-flops. He’s got big obnoxious sunglasses perched on his nose, and if Castiel didn’t love him so, he’d be embarrassed to be seen with him.
The bottom drops out from Dean’s stomach, and he stares at Cas for just a beat before his body catches up to the words, and he wastes no more time pulling Cas close to him.
“I don’t have words for what Joshua did for me, Dean. He helped my mind, body, and spirit heal from the damage Naomi wrought. He told me…” Castiel’s voice breaks. “He told me that I made a brave choice and that I was my own man. That the choice of mortality was taken from me, but not of humanity. That I could be whoever I wanted to be.
As soon as he’s there, he sweeps Cas into his arms and kisses him hard and filthy. Cas responds in kind, the hand not holding his violin case twisted up in Dean’s shirt to keep him close.
you would do all of that just to lie about being in love with him,” Zeke says as if Cas hadn’t spoken, and it occurs to Cas that he may as well not have. This narrative isn’t
So it’s with a giddy, almost disbelieving smile on his face that Dean turns to press gentle kisses against Cas’ face, across the bridge of his nose and his high cheekbones, down his jaw and finally ending up at his full, smiling mouth. Cas shakes gently with raspy laughter.
“What’s your name, son?” the sheriff asks, though he’s probably not nearly old enough to address Dean that way.
He already left his shoes at the door, but he slips his jacket off, and after a moment’s thought, his jeans, too. He grabs Cas’ gift and crawls into bed next to him. Cas lifts the covers obligingly and presses against Dean’s side under his arm as soon as he’s settled.
Instead of doing any of that, he whispers, “Love you, too, Claire.” He leans down to press a kiss to her temple. She hums happily, and he manages to get out of the room before the wildly roiling emotions in his scent disturb her.
That, however, is a conversation for a time when Cas’ thick scent isn’t coating Dean’s nose and throat, when Dean isn’t hard enough to pound nails, and when Cas’ mouth isn’t begging to be ravaged as much as the rest of him.
There’s no other word for it. While Dean is struggling to find a way to put this right, to put Cas at ease, the omega flees the room.
Cas wraps both of Dean’s hands in both of his and leans forward until their foreheads are pressed together. Dean closes his eyes and presses into the comforting touch of Cas, the love of his life, his rock in the hailstorm that his life sometimes is.
Cas shrugs. The movement is still a little stiff, like he’s not sure he’s doing it right. It’s endlessly cute.
He roasts the bird in the cookfire until it’s crispy and brown. He also roasts a few carrots and long green beans in the juices from the bird until they, too, are browned and flavorful. The bread has, of course, already been baked. The only thing he’s missing is wine, but the cool, clear water from the well is almost as good.
He wakes up, he and Cas have coffee and breakfast together, and then they load Colonel up into Baby, who’s finally back from the body shop, and go to Needs Must. While there, he does whatever Cas needs, be it stocking shelves, cleaning, organizing, or general small repair. Regulars of the shop start to recognize him, and he finds himself embroiled in friendly chats about cars, politics, business ownership, and dogs. He wears t-shirts, jeans, and boots every day.
up his inner thigh, where the flesh is pale as cream and so, so soft. “You’ll forget everything but my name and my knot, sweetheart.”
John doesn’t smile, nor does his face soften. He doesn’t even give him a “colleague smile,” just nods. “I did.”
“I don’t know what it was about that day, Dean, or that beating. Maybe it was the hunger, the thirst, the aching, the exhaustion, or any combination of all of those things. Maybe it was none of them. Maybe it’s because I was weak, because I was always weak and always will be. I don’t know.
Anna nods, pauses awkwardly, then flings herself forward and hugs Dean fiercely before waving at Cas and darting away. Dean blinks, then chuckles and resumes walking them toward their physics class.
Cas smiles. “Welcome. My name is Castiel, I own The Bunker with Dean. Please, come have a seat while we wait for him to come back.”
His hurried warning is cut off by his orgasm. He clenches his teeth against a scream, spilling into Dean’s mouth. Dean sucks on the head of his cock almost tenderly and continues working his prostate, prolonging his aftershocks torturously.
It’s over now. In a moment, Dean will ask him to leave, and he will. He’ll go, and he’ll hunt down that bitch Naomi, and he’ll put her down for good. He doesn’t know what he’ll do after that, without Dean, but he doesn’t want to think about it. He’ll murder his mother, avenge the only man he could have realistically called father, and he’ll go from there.
There’s no alpha to fleece, beat, or any number of dark things that Dean wants to do when he thinks of Cas and Claire being harmed, though.
“Any food that tastes a bit off?” Ketch continues. “Any places ‘round there that it might be a little
Hell, Castiel is a business owner, clearly a sharp dresser, and seems to be at least a de facto leader.
The heavy velvet curtain rises as the house lights dim. The school orchestra is sprawled elegantly across the stage, and Cas is set apart, front and center, violin already tucked beneath his chin.
Dean’s heart gives a heavy, painful thump, but he can’t dwell on how much it affects him that this sweet pup has been so hurt. He probably needs claire’s help even more than he wants to pretend or admit, and he’ll need to recruit her fast if he doesn’t want her running off to share her suspicion with her father.
They’re taking advantage of the rare opportunity presented by Cas’ whole family being out of the house to have sex somewhere other than the backseat of the Impala.
At first, of course, it was that perky, tight ass encased in expensive slacks that caught his eye. The pale, smooth expanse of Cas’ neck that’s just begging to be marked up by Dean’s teeth. And,
He thinks blearily of his parents. Despite a life of crime, John and Mary Winchester were both taken by yellow fever a few years ago in a hospital in Arkansas. The last letter he has from his mother forbade him or Sam from coming to see them, lest they get sick or (even worse, in Mary Winchester’s mind) blow their cover. In the end, it didn’t matter. John and Mary were dead and buried before Sam and Dean managed to get to the hospital, anyway.
Lucifer shrugs, waving a hand dismissively. “Nah, I get it. What were you gonna say, ‘A bunch of vamps wanna meet with your vamp boss? Put us down for four-o’clock?’” He chuckles. “This was probably better. Come on! Sit, sit. It’s been so long since I had talked to another vampire, how long are you guys staying?”
Claire has gotten into the habit of darting back and forth and picking a combination of wildflowers, weeds, and long grasses seemingly at random. She gathers them into a bundle and wraps another long bit of grass around the middle. She’ll carry it around for a few hours until it gets left somewhere around the farm. It’s pretty damn cute, if Dean has anything to say about it.
“Now, I don’t expect that you’re ready to say it back,” Cas is going on, “but I wanted you to know. You’re so good to Claire and I, and you’ve been wonderful from the moment you woke up, you’ve been so patient, and I just wanted you to know how I-”
There are the kids who are there for athletics, who live for and breathe jerseys, exertion, and team spirit. There are the pure nerds, who thrive on knowledge in all forms. The politicians’ children, smarmy and polished, only rebellious when their parents can’t see them. The scholarship kids, endearing in their boundless work ethic.
The SUV that brought them here is parked right out front, across several parking spaces. Gabe is leaning against the back of it, not looking at them, his phone pressed to his ear. Though he appears to be engrossed in his phone conversation (Being berated by Kali for recklessness, if Cas’ own ears don’t deceive him), the way his shoulders relax almost unnoticeably betrays his relief.
“I’m signed up for remote classes for next semester, and Charlie says that doing that for the semester after won’t be a problem. Sammy and Bobby know, and Sam’s teaching the old man how to Skype. Benny and Ash think I’m studying abroad.”
Once there is nothing but crumbs left, Claire takes the plates carefully to the washing tub and places them in one by one. Cas watches this with a wide-eyed bemusement before turning to Dean with an arched eyebrow. Dean grins and holds his hands up in surrender.
Dean is unhappy, his usually carefree smile darkened and tight as he steers them toward their next class.
Benny’s not proud of those years of his life, but he doesn’t lie about them, either. He was in a gang, a violent one, and it was a bad crew. It wasn’t until Andrea was lost to senseless violence, a gunshot no one could tell him the origin of, that he got out.
never would have let something like that happen to Needs Must. I know how much you love it, and that bastard husband didn’t even know something was wrong until Gabriel called him.”
“I’m, uh,” the boy replies, eyes moving rapidly to take everything around him in. “I’m looking for Dean Winchester?”
“I heard.” He smooths a hand down her hair, left flowing in the deference to the unusual day ahead of them. “I have to take care of a few things, but I’ll join you and your papa as soon as I can.”
“Once upon a time,” and Dean will be damned if Cas’ voice isn’t suited for reading stories to little pups, “there was an omega princess. She was very beautiful, but alas, she had not met an alpha she could bond with, and was wasting away…”
As such, it is his personal responsibility to ensure that Dean feels no trepidation whatsoever about their future.
“The advantage,” Cas says, face still smushed against Dean’s skin, “of owning your own shop is that when your husband makes a life-altering decision, you can close that shop to spend the day at home with him. At home and ideally
“I know how Dean feels about me, Charlie. We both know that he’s uncomfortable expressing his emotions verbally, but I know how he feels. I’m at peace with it.”
She nods. “I just…” She seems to brace herself. “This is stupid, but I just wanted to tell you that I really like Dean, and I think you’re really good together.” She speaks so fast the words bleed into one another, but Cas understands her perfectly.
Castiel looks up and laughs softly, a sound that rattles around Dean’s head for a moment. “Only when I asked you to move around, lift this or that, and when I asked you to still yourself so I could remove your breeches, Dean, nothing more.” He pats Dean’s bare knee as he reaches for two long strips of linen from a basket beside the bed. He folds one into a pad roughly the size of the wound and uses the other to wrap around Dean’s leg, holding the bandage in place.
Castiel comes forward the rest of the way until he’s standing in front of Uriel, his old comrade. “Tell me what I’ve found is mistaken,” he says, almost pleading. “She cannot possibly still be looking for the First.”
Castiel blinks, utterly derailed. He really thought the meeting was going quite well. He’s nervous, of course, but he feels that he’s doing a passable job of covering.
They’re in their bedroom, and the darkness would be impossible to see through were they both not vampires. The sheets are tangled around Castiel’s ankles. He’s bare from the waist up, as is Dean, and they’re both wearing thin pajama pants. He keenly feels every place where Dean is pressed against him.
A bit further away, it looks like Balthazar and Lucifer are having a hushed argument. Well, Balthazar is arguing, Lucifer is as unworried as he has been for the last two days, maybe even a bit amused. As Castiel watches, Bal seems to run out of steam. Once he’s quiet for a moment, Lucifer reaches out to touch his arm, briefly at first, then curling around Bal’s bicep almost familiarly, warmly. Bal relaxes into the touch and Lucifer smiles.
It’s not until Dean’s cold, distant voice rings through the warehouse that Castiel even remembers he’s not alone.
Charlie is bopping her head to Billy Joel as she helps Anna wipe down the tables as they ready the club to open. Kevin is going through his music choices for the night with Dean and Cas up on the dance floor, but for now, Dean has the controls, so old music it is. He may have a point, though, because Bal is humming from the kitchen as he preps for the night. Even Benny is drumming his fingers against his thigh to the beat.
“They will pay for this,” he says solemnly, a promise to a father figure he didn’t protect and a sister he can barely look at.
Dean is silent, save for the occasional sniffle, for a long time. Cas holds him through it until Dean finally lifts his head. When he does, Cas pulls back just enough to cup that handsome face that he loves so much gently in his hands.
Cas looks up from where he was focusing on Dean’s leg and cocks his head to the side. “I beg your pardon?”
“Pretty sure yelling and breaking shit is the wrong way, babe.” Cas starts to protest, but Dean waves it off. “What does the kid want?”
“Love you, too, sweetheart,” Dean whispers, pressing another kiss to the top of Cas’ head. “Come on, you big mutt.”
Cas' words are harsh, and Dean is certain his collar was just fine, but he lets Cad push him around and "fix" it without taking it personally. Really, he thinks it's cute that Cas is nervous. Cas will sit in front of hundreds of people and play until his fingers bleed, but he's scared of walking across a stage and getting a diploma.
Right now, though, Cas is frowning down at a bag of “veggie pasta,” whatever that means. There’s a furrow between his brows as he reads over the ingredients (and, really, how many ingredients could “veggie pasta” have in it to begin with?) with an air of solemnity that would be right at home investigating crimes or slaying demons, but is a touch out of place in a grocery store.
“Is this because of Cas? Because they wanted me to settle down and I didn’t settle down the way they wanted me to?”
Everyone here is a stick in the mud.” He glares around at all of them. “If no one’s going to mention how wonderful I look today, will you at least tell me if we’ve made any progress as far as Crazies ‘R’ Us?”
Dean’s face softens and he pulls Cas into their almost empty physics classroom. He moves them into the back corner, and their reputation is enough to keep anyone from moving closer.
He tries to keep his scent free of anger, especially since Claire clambered into his lap like it was nothing as soon as he sat down. It makes his leg ache, and he’s sure that Cas will fuss over them as soon as he comes back inside, but her slight weight is worth the feeling of her leaning against his chest as she plays with her dolls.
Now he’s a bit worried that either he or Mr. Winchester is having a stroke. He’s not sure which of them, but one of them is, surely.
Just the idea of it makes Dean’s vision hazy with rage, and he has to stop to collect himself. Bad enough that he was hitting
Without thinking (which is something that gets Dean into more trouble than he’d like to admit), Dean blurts, “Where is your mate? Shouldn’t they be helping you?”
Cas is quickly gathering up the brush, bowl, towel, and straight razor, but he manages to shoot Dean a tight smile. “You’re very welcome, Dean. Sleep well.”
Cas lets his own fangs descend, still having more control over them than Dean has over his. He wastes little time, especially when Dean seals his mouth at Cas’ neck and bites down.
Dean’s mom comes to the door, drying her hands on a towel. Dean knows very well what she does for a living, but dressed in ratty jeans and one of his dad’s old flannels, it’s hard to think of her as anything but “mom.”
The thing is, there aren’t a lot of people around who care about Kevin these days. In fact, it sometimes seems like no one at all cares. Not about him, or if he’s eating, or if he’s doing his homework, or if he’s warm.
Dean is talking about a test he took recently, one on which he did well. Mary is already well aware of it and is proud of her son. There is now, however, a note of (albeit shaky) confidence in his own voice. It’s something she’s only heard rarely before, and in her surprise, she glances at Castiel.
Cas is reaching up to wrap his arms around Dean’s neck, bottle dangling from long, elegant fingers. “I am,” he admits, always bending easier when it’s just the two of them.
Once the fire is stoked and crackling cheerfully, he scratches his chin and sets the water to boiling in a small pot. Cas is a steadfast coffee drinker, much like Dean himself. It’s one of the only indulgences Dean has observed the omega partake in, if not
The other alpha steps toward Dean, just one step, but it’s enough. His stance, at odds with Dean’s own, is all alpha challenge and authoritative. Dean knows a man with an agenda when he sees one (especially since he’s spent so much time with an agenda of his own).
He keeps his eyes closed, trying to pinpoint where he is. Gradually, he remembers the injury, the ride, waking up, and Castiel. All of which is well and good, but Castiel never mentioned a pup.
Cas whines again and Dean adds another finger, stretching Cas a bit to account for his own girth. He’s not the
Once he’s signed in and down one of the hallways leading to the patients’ quarters, he steps to the side to try to organize his thoughts. His senses are more than capable of leading him, but there’s so
Cas smirks, but his scent is light and sweet with giddy happiness. Dean doesn’t understand why, but he likes making Cas happy, so he lets Ketch fade to the back of his mind.
She couldn’t say why, but there’s something… Slimy about him.  He’s never anything but a perfect gentleman to her, but she doesn’t trust him. He wants something that he’s not saying.
Castiel frowns down at his phone. He’s currently sitting in his advanced English course, the only class he doesn’t share with Dean. Which Charlie knows, because she’s in biology with Dean right now.
“She turned me instantly, drained me there on my knees and forced me to drink her blood. As I lay on the ground, trying to grapple with the new input of every sense I had, I was forced to watch, with enhanced hearing, sight, and smell, as she turned my sister into a vampire, too. My weakness had broken Anna, and she agreed so easily after that.”
what’s happened in his life to make him act this way? Who knows how he’s been hurt, that he would cling so to what was clearly a fantasy?
Dean tries to hold Cas’ hips still, but he moans when Cas wraps his fingers around Dean’s cock and pumps, smearing leftover lube around.
Dean kisses him again, unable to contain himself. “We’ll just sleep, darlin’,” he whispers huskily. “Nothing else, I swear it.”
really need to review their proposal again. It’s simple, a slight increase in their rent payments in exchange for another twenty-five year fixed-rate contract. It’s not much, but it’s what they can afford, and he’s hoping another heaping dose of nostalgia will keep the Heaven’s Light Shopping Center open and thriving.
Cas hums again, eyes tracing down Dean’s body in a way that makes him shudder. “Well, the offer is open, I don’t have enough beautiful things to look at during the day.” Cas smiles again before looking back down at his paperwork. Almost absently, he murmurs, “You could open your own shop, maybe. Work on cars all day. You
He nods toward the door they’re still standing in front of. “Will you tell me about this patient, please?”
“I just… You’re so busy, always working while I sit here and watch the days go by. I feel guilty, Cas, sitting here like a useless jackass-uh, sorry, useless lump. Is there something I can do to help you?”
Sam’s bellow has Dean leaning over Impala’s neck and urging her to run faster. Somehow, impossibly, she does, and they manage to catch up to Sam and his big bay stallion, Wisdom.
“I can take care of myself,” Dean says, just a hint of a growl beneath the words. He stalks past the sheriff, unties Impala,  and swings himself up into her saddle smoothly. “You’d do well, sheriff, to keep
thank God. I mean, shit, I thought I… Well, no matter.” He smiles, self-deprecating and just a touch shy. Castiel is not going to make it out of this meeting alive. “I’m not either, obviously.”
Claire’s shriek sets Dean’s ears to ringing, but he smiles down at her when she turns in her seat to beam at him.
Dean fiercely wishes it was the middle of the day so he could lay Cas out in the sunshine to see every bit of him, or even that he was willing to separate from Cas long enough to light a lantern to see by. Since it’s not and he’d rather die than move even an inch away from Cas, he has to make do with sinking one finger into his omega and enjoying the way Cas’ bak arches and his breath catches.
“Drink,” Dean says, urging Castiel to sit up and take the glass of water from him. Castiel acquiesces easily, never moving far from the solid warmth Dean’s chest offers. Dean combs his fingers through Castiel’s hair and kisses his shoulder and neck again while Castiel drinks. Once he’s done, Dean takes the empty glass and puts it back on the nightstand. Then he tugs Cas back to lying down and pulls him close, wrapping his arms tight around Castiel.
“She declined, told me that she had always planned on turning both Anna and I. That we were to be the first of her army, the first of the revolution, though I didn’t care to try to understand what she was saying at the time. She kept us down there, in that dark dungeon, chained to the wall, for… I don’t know how long we were there. She beat us regularly, tortured us mercilessly. I was waterboarded, burned, and starved. Never enough to scar, but she had other ways. She dumped cold water on our heads and left us shivering for hours. She would neglect to feed us for days, then leave fresh plates of food in the middle of the room. She told me often that if I were only to say yes, our suffering would stop. It was… Well, I imagine it is the hell I will return to when I die.”
Cas blinks at the sight of the carnage. He’s fairly certain that Dean never actually left the office the battle started in, so that leaves-
Mr. Alastair Rack, the biology teacher who to all appearances despises children, has taken a vicious delight in singling Dean out all year. He’s gone out of his way to tear Dean down, to belittle or demean him in any way possible. Cas was out for blood immediately, wanted him fired, but Dean insisted he stand down, that it wasn’t worth it. Castiel honored those wishes, albeit quite begrudgingly.
Without saying another word, Castiel turns and darts back up the stairs. Gabriel shouts, and there seems to be a scuffle behind him, but he doesn’t turn back around. Once he gets to the bedroom he and Dean share, he leaves the door open behind him and goes to sink down onto the bed. He rests his elbows on his thighs and buries his face in his hands.
Many Azure Court vampires prefer fear, claiming precisely what Gabriel does, that the vibrant taste of it remind them of being human. The argument holds little water for Castiel, since they’re all perfectly capable of eating and tasting regular food
Dean’s surprise brings another almost-smile to Castiel’s face, and he manages to open his eyes now. He can’t read the expression on Dean’s face, but he curses himself for keeping them closed for so long. If this is to be the last time he’s able to openly study this beautiful boy’s features, then by God, he should be trying to soak in every moment.
Not to say that Dean is casual about them, no. His easygoing facade is belied by the way his eyes are always locked onto Castiel, who preens under the attention. Castiel might get a little jealous (an understatement), but Dean gets downright
(Not that Cas particularly cares one way or another, really, but Dean has set college up as some sort of holy grail that only Sam is worthy of. Cas is determined that Dean will get there, too.)
“Yes, well,” Balthazar says firmly before Gabriel can agree enthusiastically, “that will have to wait until after we deal with the Lightbringers.”
He can feel, rather distantly, that there is a cut on his forehead that stings and is bleeding more than he’s used to (he, too, fed more recently). He knows his coat is torn, but doesn’t realize that his arm has taken a hit until Dean prods at it and scowls when Cas flinches. There are various scrapes and bruises, all quite expected from having been in the kind of skirmish they were in, but Castiel barely feels any of it.
“I know that this is… Unconventional, and completely out of left field, and I’m pretty desperate, but I want you to get something out of this, too. What I’m proposing will be mutually beneficial, I won’t lie, though, you’d be doing me a pretty big favor.”
When he does look over, Sam is scowling, but he yanks Wisdom’s reins and vers to the right. Dean lets himself be relieved. There’s only one man chasing them over the dry, dusty plain somewhere in the Missouri territories, and he can’t pursue both of them. Hopefully, he can smell that Dean is injured and come this way, so Sam can-
Supper passes like a dream. The lantern light flickers perfectly, emphasizing how lovely Cas is and how much Claire looks like her omega father. Everything ends up tasting absolutely perfect. Claire is so well-behaved that Dean would think she was in on his plans if he was so inclined to share them with a five-year-old.
They were both brawlers, aimless and violent and angry. Benny would see him around town, sometimes across the bar during a free for all. He was a twink, really, a tall twink in a leather jacket with an angry spark in his green eyes. Benny took note of him, but that was all.
She doesn’t share her concerns with anyone else. She wants to, she really does, but everyone feels the same way she does about Mr. W and Mr. N’s dogs, and she’s just not willing to freak anyone else out.
There is no protest. Cas knows who Dean is, how Dean operates. He knows this won’t go unaddressed. He knows there’s no stopping Dean until blood has been spilled in retribution.
“Good,” she says, “terrible place, that. Putting a nice boy like you in suits all day. A shame, is what it was.”
“Zeke,” Cas makes his voice soft, placating, “Dean and I have been together for a long time, it wasn’t out of nowhere. We just-”
“Do you… Can you…” She takes a deep, deep breath and seems to steel herself. “Can you read me a story, Papa?” she asks, the words bursting forth from her.
a life-altering decision when he quit his job. He’s well set-up for money, with careful investments, negligible spending, and the inherent privilege of having his father own the company he worked for for so long, so he doesn’t need to find other work
Since Joshua’s murder, however, their fervor has returned tenfold. Castiel and Dean are rarely far from research of any kind, and Balthazar is in the field, tracking down leads and following any suspected movement. Gabriel keeps them as coordinated and fed as possible. Sam and Charlie help as much as they can, but they have school and work, so their available time is limited.
Balthazar, unfazed by Castiel’s obviously sour mood, just smiles. “Someone’s a little grouchy, eh? Missing your man?”
Well, on the other hand is the way Cas’ poor heart picked up to a gallop in his chest when Dean said, “Marry me.”
So why, then, does he feel so bad about burdening one wary omega and his pup? Cas and Claire aren’t marks. In fact, something about the idea of anyone taking advantage of the two of them, even
He carefully pulls all of his clothes off and leaves them in a pile at the door. He’ll burn them in the morning, they smell to high heaven and are stained with any number of unnameable things.
She’s wearing a simple, worn dress in a pretty dark green. It’s clearly handsewn, but well-done and clean. Her pale hair is done neatly in two braids that fall well past her little shoulders. She’s a pretty pup, and she’ll be quite beautiful when she grows into her own, he thinks.
“I don’t mind and I’m feeling quite up to the task,” Dean says, cheerful in his victory. “If you’ll just help me outside I can get started.”
She met Mr. W and Mr. N at the little diner Mr. N worked at and where they offered free wifi. Mr. W would cuss at his laptop and make moon eyes at Mr. N, and Charlie found herself hopelessly charmed.  She told herself that was as far as it would go.
The thought tastes sour in the back of his throat. He lets his mind spin and wander for the rest of his run, making no attempt to rein himself in or make sense of his thoughts.
Slender, calloused fingers pressing against his lips effectively silence Dean. he realizes that his gaze has shifted away from Cas and off into the darkness. With an effort, he makes himself meet Cas’ eyes again.
Naomi looks over at him, giving him a dispassionate once-over. “I know about your paramour, James,” Dean stiffens in surprise but stays blessedly silent, “but who, pray tell, is this?”
believe that I don’t want to do this, but I need you to put your hands where I can see them, Castiel.” The voice sounds like it’s coming from underwater.
His planning is interrupted by Dean’s warm mouth pressed to his. Cas doubts he’ll ever get over how natural it feels to kiss Dean, and is therefore thoroughly distracted until Dean pulls away.
“I don’t think I want to ‘fix things,’ or whatever you’re talking about.” He waves vaguely. “I quit.”
The way Dean had looked when he’d talked about Cas made Benny think of Andrea, how Andrea had seen the best in people no matter what, even when she’d been proven wrong. How she’d urged him to do the same.
The next morning starts much the same as the one before did - Dean wakes up tangled up with Cas, in Cas’ room. There are a few things that are different, of course. They didn’t have sex the night before, so he doesn’t have any of that good soreness in his body that he did yesterday. His phone is on Cas’ nightstand and his clothes are in the laundry basket instead of strewn across the floor. Colonel is curled up at Cas’ back, where Dean is pressed to Cas’ front.
After the night before, everything that happened with Uriel, Castiel’s confession, and Dean’s casual acceptance of what Castiel considers to be his most heinous acts, it’s incredible to Castiel that everything seems to be the same as it was. The weather, however, cannot affect his buoyed spirits. If they weren’t still searching for the Lightbringers, and now Naomi, he’d be floating on air.
Castiel scowls, because he almost made it out, but he stops and turns to look at his friend. “Yes?” he bites out.
None of them say a word as Anna unlocks the door and leads them down a hall, then into a room to their left where the scent of copper is strongest.
Once Naomi falls, the rest resolves itself rather simply. Or so Castiel assumes. He is consumed by watching the remnants of pale blood ooze from her neck far too slowly to be human.
Actually, men like him have always made perfect marks, and it’s a bit of a fight to keep from falling into old habits as well as to keep from doing some posturing of his own
Cas cries out softly before biting his lip and gripping Dean’s arms hard enough to leave little half-moon marks that Dean can admire and preen over later.
Dean isn’t angry with him. Dean isn’t disgusted by his weakness. Dean doesn’t think he’s a monster (well, outside of being a vampire), or an abomination, or a failure. Dean still thinks Castiel is worthy of sorrow and physical affection.
He stretches hard, then silently leads Rugaru, Phoenix, and Kitsune out of the bedroom. His girls know the drill, so they’re all quiet until he shuts the bedroom door behind him. The Colonel stays in bed with Cas, and he’ll be there until Cas gets up.
He knows, of course, that this peace won’t last, not exactly like this, anyway. Dean is still reeling from quitting a job that he relied on heavily for his identity for a very long time, still trying to find his equilibrium in a world that has changed quite suddenly for him. While it’s nice to see him loosen up a little and to see the end of those terrible suits, Dean will need to figure out a plan soon, to find out what and where he wants to go next. Cas is really just glad for the opportunity to be a safe harbor for his husband during this time of recovery.
“I ran. I took Anna and Gabriel and we fled. I think we only got away so neatly because we had been so incredibly broken before then. Naomi didn’t see it coming, and we fled.
Dean must be showing his disappointment for the opportunity lost to play with Claire for an afternoon. For some reason, it makes Cas’ features soften, though, and he smiles.
just-fucked wild this time, sticking up at all angles while Cas squinted angrily at a cup of coffee. He was wrapped in Dean’s threadbare bathrobe and one hand was absently stroking Colonel behind the ears. Dean loves him so much it hurts.
“‘Night,” Dean says absently as Castiel shuts the door behind him. There’s something strange about the omega’s scent, some sort of combination of regret and relief that makes Dean’s nose twitch.
“I stayed with her.” Now his voice is robotic, strained. He is tired and heartsick, he wants to lie down and sleep forever, maybe. He just has to finish the tale of his failure to Dean and he’ll get to.
Dean winks across the table at Cas, who’s blushing furiously again and smiling down at his own plate.
Cas rides him slowly, luxuriously. They’re both nude this time and Dean takes the opportunity to admire the soft curves of Castiel’s body. The lithe strength when he rolls his hips, the supple flexibility in his legs as he fucks himself onto Dean’s cock. His scent is rich with arousal, love, and enough smugness to let Dean know that Cas knows
Mr. W is rolling his eyes, and there’s a rosy blush on his cheeks as he allows Mr. N to sweep him across the dance floor in what looks like a waltz. Billy Joel is still crooning, and Mr. N sings along.
“I do not need your help today,” Cas says stiffly as he turns on his heel. “Please stay in the bedroom. I’ll bring supper when it’s ready.”
Eventually, the students are released and they start to come down the steps at the side of the stage to meet their families. Cas is one of the first down, and Dean shamelessly hops over the first row of chairs so he can get to Cas before Naomi does.
Dean nods. “Yeah, for sure, but it is what it is. The problem is that I’m not in a relationship right now, and I definitely don’t have anyone lining up to marry me.” That nervous smile hits Castiel right in the heart again. “That’s where you come in, Mr. Novak.”
“Because I do, really. But Dean, you are not what you do. Or, at least, you are not what you have done in the past. I have never seen you be anything but gentle and kind. The way you care for myself and Claire, the way you plan for our future.”
A small part of himself is holding him back, too, and not just for Cas. As much as he wants to throw himself into a new life on this farm, with this omega and this pup, there’s something stopping him.
Dean finds a kind of peace in the next several days that he’s rarely known before, and never for as long.
After a beat of silence that must be incredibly awkward, Dean clears his throat. “Uh, okay. Do you wanna show us…”
Cas slumps against him, and Dean catches him with a soft “oomph.” He winces when his over-sensitive cock slips free, but he gently helps Cas maneuver himself so he’s resting on Dean’s chest and their legs are tangled.
Dean eyes them hungrily, but still finds it in himself to ask, “Don’t s’pose you’d be open to bringing me a cup of coffee, too?”
It’s intense, probably unhealthy, overwhelming, but when Dean pants into his ear, “You mine, Cas?” in the backseat of his car, Cas’ reply is the same every time.
As he is in everything, Dean has been remarkable through his adjustment to this faux-afterlife. He’s already able to be around humans without posing a threat, but when they feed on one another during sex, he sometimes loses himself.
mornings. He’s rarely coherent before at least one cup of coffee. It’s endearing as all hell, and the first stage of Dean’s plan.
Dean shakes his head as if in thought. “I just don’t know what’s different today. But you and your papa here have made the best bread in the whole world.”
Jobs go bad, of course, and there’s nothing for it sometimes. The life of a grifter isn’t always an easy one, either, or safe. Not to
He flips the movie to an old episode of Star Trek, smiling when Dean perks up a little. Colonel hops on the other side of the couch to rest his head on Cas’ shins.
Dean hooks a hand around the back of Cas’ neck and tugs him close to kiss him hard. Cas comes alive, a wildcat in Dean’s arms, biting and scratching and desperate. Dean’s so hard he can feel precome making his boxers stick to the head of his cock.
mated, but Castiel isn’t saying anything about it, so Dean doesn’t push. Gods know that he has a long list of things he won’t talk about, so he doesn’t begrudge the omega his own secrets.
Dean wrinkles his nose. He’s patched himself and Sam up a fair number of times, but he’s never gotten used to the sight or smell of so much blood. He’s never had an infection, thank the gods, but he remembers his father getting one before he managed to make it back to a safehouse. His mother berated him harshly and the cabin smelled like a terrible, sweet sickness for over a week.
“I love you, too,” Dean says in a rush, almost a gasp, a relief to finally have the words out loud, hanging in the air between them. “Cas, of course I do, you know that.”
