Steve tucked Tony into bed; he half stirred. "It's okay," he whispered and pressed a kiss to his forehead. "Sleep. You need it." But Steve didn't- the serum had changed that. To sleep for more than about eight hours, it had to have been an especially long day- the Expo being the perfect example of that.
Tony hiccuped as Steve handed him a glass of water and ran his fingers through his hair.  "I promised you I wouldn't," he said, watching Steve take off his collar and feeling a bit bummed.  Steve looked handsome in the collar. "...I wanted to win Donner... I hate thinking about... about Malick with his hands all over him, thinking about you... ugh.  Sick." He looked down at the car keys in his hand. "Pepper is gonna be mad about how much I lost... at least I got this... probably a Hawk... y'know a Golden Hawk in good condition could be worth up to sixty grand..."  Something was nagging, hard, at Tony's memory. Something about the Hawk. He struggled to remember.
Did Clint have a brother? Fuck. Now Steve was trying to remember and he couldn't, like every conversation he could possibly have ever had with Clint was fuzzed out of his memory. He didn't know. And even then, how common a surname was Barton? The conference attracted people from all over, the chances were minute but-- but it was worth checking. Steve knew Clint had had a rough start. It wouldn't be unusual for his brother to have been... bought. Shit.
"How's the investigation going?" asked Natasha.
Donner had nearly managed to sneak away.
Tony let out a sigh of satisfaction and arched slightly into Steve.  Part of it was physical, but part of it was hearing Steve say that he made him happy.  Tony was desperate to make Steve happy, just as much as Steve was desperate to make Tony happy.  Their motivations were slightly different, of course.  Steve wanted to please; Tony wanted to nurture.  But fundamentally, it wasn't so different.
Tony and Steve climbed stiffly into the backseat of the SUV after crunching their way through the dusty snow in the graveyard; the car was incredibly warm after spending two hours in the chilly outdoor weather.  Pepper looked up but made no movement. Happy didn't look back at all.
something, something important.
omega.  He could practically already hear Natasha laughing at him.  Talk about being castrated.  He'd wanted to correct Steve the moment he had said it, earlier, in the bathroom, but then Steve had been kissing him and Tony's mind had gone blank.  That sweet tongue, those soft lips... Steve had a remarkable ability to shut him up.
Tony checked the bedroom, immediately concluded Steve wasn't there, and then checked the studio.  He should have checked there first. The room was thick with the smell of him. Tony's neck prickled.
"If removed, you would likely die."
Maybe Steve's hero complex was rubbing off on Tony, because he couldn't help but feel strange that no one seemed overly enthusiastic about being liberated.  Athena and Cupid both seemed serene; they followed with their arms linked together, wrapped in their sheets, looking only mildly curious. Sera clung to the man he had been with, who seemed thoroughly indignant; from a brief, hushed conversation they had together, Tony gathered that they were spending the weekend together and that they were upset that Steve had walked in on them; they had been scheduled to leave the camp at the beginning of the following week and did not understand what the "rescue" entailed.  Tony felt sorry for them, both of them.  They were both, in their own way, victims, though they didn't yet understand that.
"B-Bucky."
"Has it occurred to you that I don't
Brennan glared right back at Hill. She looked deadly.
"...Steve.  You're a lot bigger than me," said Tony. There was a slight sense of embarrassment, knowing his own omega could easily hurt him, but there'd never been an omega like Steve before.
He pulled his own goggles up so at least Tony could see his face (not that Steve was sure he even wanted to). "Tony?" He asked, his voice hesitant. "Can you hear me?"
Wendy wrinkled her nose.
"Steve."
She hit his arm. "Get out of my bird, you sap. And don't take too long, either.  He's worried about you, Steve."
Steve swallowed. And then he pulled back.
"I know I need to stop going off and doing shit on my own. I'm sorry. It's just hard--" Steve let out a withered sigh. He walked over to the bag. "I just-- I got you-- well, sort of for you-- listen, I don't know why I freaked out yesterday. But I want to go that stupid conference. Everyone knows we went collar shopping. We've got to set an example now." Steve moved over to the bag. He pulled out a thin black box. "Cost me five dollars each. Boxes are tacky as hell. And... I got you flowers too. Figured a girlfriend probably never got you flowers before."
He wanted to speak out to Bucky but he didn't, scared he might snap Bucky into actually following a command. So Steve just waited, pressed up against the glass on the opposite side of the cage as if that would somehow protect him.
"You aren't shitty," said Steve.  "I was just angry when I said that because  sometimes you made me feel embarrassed and objectified.  And let's be honest, even in today's standards that's nothing new or unusual. I wouldn't have knelt if I hadn't wanted to. And I wouldn't have let you kiss me if I hadn't wanted you to, either," Steve pointed out quickly, nearly stumbling over his words. "Just...just read the report. Please. And don't do anything stupid, Tony. I didn't fight so hard for you to live for you to just hurt yourself."
"Don't worry, I'm sure they can airbrush out the bags under your eyes in the pictures," she reassured him.  Steve touched his face worriedly.  Was it that obvious he'd had a lousy night.
A memory seized him.
But Steve was only twenty-three.  Surely this wasn't anything they had to talk about now.  Tony was petrified of the idea of being responsible for a kid and felt mostly relief that Steve was okay.  But he could feel the hurt and loss coming off Steve, so he decided not to used the phrase "dodge a bullet" again.
"You look like you just got out of the showe--" began Aria.
"Would cost too much and take too long," Kerry said. "And give the others chance to clean up their dirt. We're going with a four-pronged attack and we want to catch them by surprise. Doing it on Steve's birthday gives us maximum publicity, too, which means they won't have
. You were
Pepper sighed as she stared down at Tony's plate. "Finish your sandwich. Then whiskey."
"Been there before," Steve pointed out. "And it's only three days this time."
"Steve, the tesseract is in one of the world's most secure facilities... and it's guarded by a guy with a bow and arrow, so don't worry, it's totally safe," said Tony.  "Talk to Clint, now that the cat's out of the bag, I'm sure he can tell you all about it." He stood up, and offered Steve a hand to get off the cold concrete floor.  Steve looked shaken, but a hell of a lot better.
Fury admittedly looked a little taken back.  "Listen, Rogers.  If you don't want to be a good little soldier, you can march right on out of here, because the Avengers Initiative doesn't have time for--"
, I'm not scared of... what, she's a super-gymnast and he's Robin Hood?  Why the hell would I be scared of them?  Like I've never had protective friends getting on my case about my
He patted Steve's arm, then stood.  "I'm gonna go take a nap by the pool.  You can keep reading, if you want.  I've got JARVIS transcribing everything for us.  You know what they say... keep your friends close and your enemies closer.  ...not that I'm saying SHIELD is my enemy, just that I like to know what's going on behind the scenes.  I never do business with anyone unless I've hacked into their e-mails first.  You ever notice how the only scandals Stark Industries ever has are ones I create?"  Tony tapped his nose with a smirk.
onto our civil rights to-do list.  I've never heard of this, but even in normal society, you know how people treat omegas whose Alphas have distanced the bond.  Can you imagine what
He went into the bedroom to change, heart pounding.  Hawkeye wasn't a code name at all. Or at least, hadn't started like that.  Hawkeye was the stupid pet name Clint had had. Tony was thoroughly horrified; he'd never given much thought to Clint's past, really.  Clint seemed, like Phil, to be a part of the agency. A SHIELD guy. Tony hadn't considered how or where he'd grown up; why would he? But being an omega born in the seventies...
. "But what about the rest of them?"
The pile of mail had more than doubled.  There were letters, packages, cards, manila folders, plus dozens of flower arrangements (myrtle, lavender, honeysuckle-- all of them obnoxiously fragrant) and several live orchids, the traditional bonding symbol.
Was he supposed to leave without the blond?  Was that it?
"Wasn't your father pair-bonded?"
Steve swallowed when Tony reached out to touch him. The fingers brushing through his hair felt nice and made him shiver.
omega.  It was delightful.  Tony would never admit this feeling of love, but goddamn was he enjoying it.
"What's up?" asked Tony.
Vim and Vigor stayed shoulder-to-shoulder; Vigor looked alarmed as he followed Tony.  "Are we in trouble?" he asked.
In Steve's humble opinion, it was probably the best Christmas ever. Steve wasn't freezing for the whole day, and they had food and real presents. He'd always just drawn Bucky pictures each year. He'd never been able to afford actual things before. Although this year Steve hadn't strayed too far from his usual style. After two movies and a very long bath Steve gave Tony his present.
"Karpov.  You were asking for Karpov."
"You must be Donner, yes?" David held out a hand. Donner looked at it, confused, as if no one had ever offered to shake his hand before. "Do you want to maybe go to a bathroom, and I can give you a once over?"
But what really warmed his heart was the tag that said 'cousin' on it. It wasn't a declaration of anything, but it was an acknowledgement. And that meant something.
He hung up.  Tony clenched his teeth.  "I
Steve's fingers flexed under hers affectionately. He half-smiled. "I'm okay," he breathed, not really wanting to think about new intel right now. "Maybe we should leave work talk for after New Year's, though..." he said.  Clint raised his eyebrows curiously.
"Maybe you'll win and you can put it toward the new nursery," said Richard optimistically, slapping him on the back.
Why was he having to talk about this? What the fuck was wrong with the world?
"You can thank me by taking care of yourself."
Steve sat up as Tony set the tray down, offering him a small smile as he reached out to pick at a piece of bacon. It was sweet and salty on his tongue. "So... what's the plan for the day?" he asked quietly, wondering if Pepper would hang out downstairs or maybe come up at some point. Steve kind of felt like the upstairs was their own space. And he didn't want it being invaded right now.
Steve was riding a very unique type of high. Nothing could really bring him down right now, even if he was worried about what was going to happen to Wanda and Pietro.  His emotions were all mixed together: he felt angry at them, and scared for them.  He felt sympathetic and furious.  He wanted to kill them, and protect them.  He knew, logically, it was his heat that was making him feel so mixed-up and strange.
"Please, sir." He pressed. "I really
"...Pietro and the girl made me leave," said Bucky flatly. He couldn't say that it hurt, exactly, but he wished they hadn't done that and he didn't understand why they had.
"Good."  He turned to the soldier.  "Go fetch him. The blond. Bring him alive.  No lethal force." Karpov had asked about inducers but intelligence from SHIELD reported that Steve had worked up an immunity to them.  He'd also asked about tranqs but no one was sure what sort of tranq would work on Captain America; anything that would work on a normal human wouldn't do, but they didn't want to overdo it for fear of hurting him.  In the end, they'd decided to leave it up to the witch and the asset to haul him in.
"He already has a blond, though, doesn't he?  So maybe he'll go for Twelve since she's got dark hair," said Seven, a bit nastily, clearly upset at Sixteen's cheerful, excited preening.
"Now what?"
Finally, around eleven-thirty, Rhodey had had enough.  It was close enough to midnight and he was bored to tears.
.  During the course of your life you've had some very traumatic things happen and I'm concerned that your tendency to worry about your friends is a mechanism designed to let you neglect yourself.  Are you familiar with the term
"Steve?  Have you... thought at all about the possibility that this new bond may be permanent?"  A pause, then Dr. Brennan corrected herself: "...
Donner crinkled his plastic water bottle nervously.
The moment they were back downstairs, Pepper was back into the thick of things, directly the catering staff around.  Mostly, Steve couldn't help but notice, mostly omegas. Dressed in black and white, the wait staff and chefs ran to and fro; Tony's kitchen quickly began to resemble a military operation.
"...it'll be good for us to get outside.  Get some sun," continued Tony, struggling to keep the conversation upbeat.  "...I mean, unless there's something else you wanna do? Whatever you want, Steve.  Your choice."
"Do you smoke?" asked the nurse.
"Because he was in heat!  And when you cycle in one or two months, then what, Pietro?  You'll 'want' it--" Wanda made little bunny ears with her fingers.  "--you'll 'want' it and he doesn't have the ability to say no. Then what?"
He was getting away.
The soldier had taken it gratefully and gone back down to the holding cells.
"Do you think they can go on vacation?" Pepper asked the doctor quietly. "Or do they have to stay here? I'm not sure they should travel like this..."
"...no," he admitted, leaning on Steve.  He didn't want to leave his omega alone. "Just... tell her to send something up with the doctor."  He reached over to place his hand on the back of Steve's neck, to stroke the bonding mark there.
"They're... vouching for me?" Steve repeated. "I don't deserve these people," he shook his head. "I really don't. They're too good to me."
"Nat?" Clint croaked. "What the hell?"
"Okay, so, let's see... that's the last poster, I think, isn't it, Rex?  ..any questions or comments or concerns? ...I'm seeing a lot of smiles... oh, grow up, it's just sex, people.  No judgement, there's no dumb questions... the male omega is pretty poorly understood... I Mastered in omegocology, let my tell you, Mom was
It clicked.  Tony realized suddenly what he was looking at.
Donner spotted Steve approaching him and looked around with a look of panic, like a gazelle that just realized it had been singled out of the herd by a leopard.  He shrank back against the wall, eyes still scanning the room, and it became obvious what he was looking for: Gideon.
, I can handle it.  I've been cleaning discharge out of the hole in my chest for two years.  I wanna help.  You don't have to do this alone.  I'm your mate."
"Why would anyone
There was the sound of a shutter click from across the room.  The waiter brought them a bottle of wine and had the discretion to leave without making a sound, giving them some privacy, although the idea of "privacy" was laughable.  Tony was not a discreet person, and for that matter, neither was Steve.
Natasha shrugged.  "Got me what I wanted."
"Is he okay?" asked someone else.
"'s time for mission?" he mumbled, cracking open an eye.  Steve's eye, bright blue, was in his field of vision. "Lemme get a shower and throw on my suit, gimme a sec."  He yawned expansively and stretched, making no move to actually get up.
, and also, ever since he'd hired Pepper, she'd been screening them, getting a driver's license.  (Tony's earlier system involved going "You eighteen?" while putting on a condom.)
have your shirt now?"  Tony's voice cracked a little.  He stuck his hand out impatiently.
the one who always ends up freezing on the fire escape..."
"Y'know, maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to just do one tiny little interview, y'know, with Banksy and Irshad, to tell omegas to be their own people and not listen to asshole Alphas and stuff.  Y'know. Little... morale boost," ventured Tony thoughtfully. He didn't add that he found both Banksy and Irshad to be very pleasant company. Young, attractive omegas... Irshad was unbonded and Banksy was bonded to a much, much older Alpha who was at about the same dominance level as Tony.  So sue him; he couldn't help noticing that. Anyways he liked them for more than just mating potential, probably. Both seemed clever. Tony certainly didn't mind sitting around listening to them talk about civil rights if it meant he got to ogle them a little. He was pretty sure you'd have to be inhuman not to notice how attractive Banksy was, or how high up on the status totem pole Irshad was.  Alphas tripped over themselves around both of them.
Of course she could smell it, too.
Richard laughed.  "Nothing at all. She's perfectly healthy."
"What's your middle name, kid?"
"...beautiful!  ...are you guys psychics?  You read my mind. Let's talk genetics.  Rex!"
"...is there anything we can get you, man?  Water? Food?" asked Sam. He didn't say "Tony" but assumed Steve knew that was an option.  The subject of Steve and Tony's relationship was definitely the white elephant in the room.
"Why not?  Lemme see your neck," demanded Tony.
Steve blinked in surprise when Tony suddenly mentioned Bucky, the test forgotten on the floor and its meaning now negligible. "Really?" He whispered and something strange seized in his chest.  He swallowed down a lump in his throat at the memory. "Why did you look up his family?"
But before Pepper could answer Steve promptly threw up. It was all water and pills.
"Really.  No use dwelling on it.  Steve, listen. You don't have to sign up or anything like that.  But we'd love if we could borrow you for an ad campaign to encourage membership.  It would really drive a lot of money our way and help us out. You don't have to say yes now; just think about it," said Tiberius.  "Those pictures of you in
"Thank you, that... that means a lot," Steve breathed. "It's been a little full on."
"I like seeing my friends," said DeSoto cautiously.
you even
Tony kissed Steve's forehead.  He was inclined to think Steve was over-reacting, but what could you expect from a guy who was frozen in 1945?  Steve hadn't understood lots of things; the world was undoubtedly a terrifying place for him.  Everything, right down to what money looked like and how people cut their hair, had changed.  It wasn't just things like the internet that baffled Steve.  He hadn't ever used a microwave or swiped a credit card.  Tony figured that, however powerful the Tesseract was, the fundamental problem wasn't the item itself but Steve's lack of understanding about it.  Now, in 2010, Tony was sure that he and SHELD could probably study it safety.  After all, if they had recovered it along with Steve, then it had been in their possessions for months and months, and so far, nothing had blown up, and no one had been turned into a zombie, and there were, to Tony's knowledge, no weird portals to other dimensions.  Everything seemed fine.
have a crush on him?"
"Oh.  What do I do if I want to help donate to conversion camps?"
He watched the shape of Tony's shoulders move as he checked himself in the bathroom mirror. Steve was aware how technical the other could get whilst preening; Tony liked a very tidy goatee. Steve was glad he couldn't really grow a full beard; he would never have that sort of patience. On average, omegas had less facial hair and less hair in...
He lowered the microphone while the crowd erupted in screams and cheers.
"I'm happy for you.  ...really, I am," said Pepper sincerely, lowering the folder a fraction of an inch.  "I really care about you, Tony.  You deserve to be happy."
Steve moved, crossing his legs on the bed, still blushing.
"I mean, I know, but what's she do?  Like... roll over... or...?"
Tony shuddered when he felt Steve's teeth graze his neck.  He nuzzled his cheek, briefly, his cock throbbing inside of Steve.  "...yeah... yeah, my omega..." he murmured, breath catching. Hearing Steve beg for it... that was enough for him to come undone.
Steve frowned a little and stepped up to Aria. "Is Pepper mad at me? Did I do something to upset her?" He knew he two were close. If he'd done something Aria would know about it.
"I gotta find Steve!"
"...what's wrong?  What are you thinking?" asked Tony softly.  He ran his tongue over the back of Steve's neck again.
"Yeah, okay.  I'm gonna go drop off Malick's shirts and then think up in our room for a while," said Tony.
Tony frowned a little.  He was surprised that Steve thought it was a good idea.  He thought it was stupid and had sort of assumed Steve would agreed that it was silly.  Steve was the one who needed support, not Tony.
. He'd stopped the car, bought Bucky food and called Fury whilst he pretended to pay for fuel that he hadn't even put in the car.
"Introduced."
No, of course not, logically, Steve was a captain, a veteran with years of tactical combat experience.
No time to suss that out now.  All that mattered was that Steve was in the midst of four hostiles and that he was pretty sure he'd seen a HYDRA insignia on one of them and he couldn't let his guard down for a minute.  He needed to neutralize the threats, not just to himself, but to Fury and to Agent Thirteen.
"He's not
Happy flipped on the radio as the car made its way down the long, winding drive.  Tony leaned his head against the tinted window, warmed by the sun, and slurped the noodles with a bored expression.  Happy was eyeballing them through the rearview mirror; halfway up the drive, he was so distracted, he nearly hit a flamingo.  "Hey, watch it!" snapped Tony, jabbing at him with the chopsticks.  "That's Bernard the Sixth!"
Aria let go of Steve and pushed him towards a chair. "Do you have the thing? So he won't get knocked up?"
"I am so sorry, Aria, but just give me one minute.  ...oh, and swell surprise! I really like Tyler Swift.”
"He's having a baby?" asked Boswell with surprise.
"Is that why she seemed so bitter when she was yelling at us about protection?"
"Yes.  True."
"--you can't call dibs on people, and you're bonded to Steve, so--"
"Do you want your birthday present now, or later?"
The press release was as boring as expected, and as cheesy as the lines Tony had produced before. Steve didn't really remember it, nor was he especially aware of what he was saying. He remembered hearing Tony's voice, and then his own, and thinking that the lights around them were too bright in the living room - couldn't they see the huge, windowed walls? There was enough light in here already. It was a nice day outside. They didn't need any more lights.
"He'll want to sing something much classier than that."
"Roger," said Steve, hanging up.
He gave the door a couple of scratches and then a few thumps with his left arm, but it didn't give the slightest indication that it was going to give.
"But you won't let me know what doctor he's even going to?"
Donner watched them as well, sipping some orange juice.  He cast a sideways glance at Banksy.  "He's unbonded," he repeated, clearly scandalized by Tony's flippant allowance of Steve having Alpha friends.
"Stevie," he repeated with interest, taking a step toward him.
A few guards spotted them on the way and tried to shoot. The bullets pinged off of the Iron Man suit like nothing.
He couldn't trust Steve.
He wrung out a washcloth and pressed it to Steve's head.
His neck was
Tony groaned, flipping up his faceplate, trying to get some idea of where he was.  The force of the crash made him want to vomit.
. He's on in five! I need make-up in here; someone clean that up. Excuse me-"  Pepper was shuffling everyone around, somehow managing to direct the stage hands and comfort the distressed reporter and make sure the Alphas stayed far enough apart that they couldn't restart the fight.  "Tony, go to the bathroom, you're bleeding everywhere. Someone get him some ice, hurry up-"  She caught Steve's eye and gave him a look he was familiar with, the disapproving glare that she gave Tony when he was drunk or late or otherwise making her job much more difficult.
He took Steve's hand and squeezed.
"Nothin'.  I just think it's cute how in love you are."
"Because the witch put me there."
"Pants," suggested Pepper.
Tony considered this.  "...why the hell would he work without being paid?" asked Tony, wondering if maybe the suggestion was a bug in JARVIS's problem-solving algorithm.
An hour passed. It was tense and stressful. Natasha had her safe houses checked (the ones that Steve knew about in the area, anyway), but there was nothing. SHIELD intel had nothing either. She'd trained him too well.  That, or it was the Winter Soldier's skills.  Perhaps a deadly combination of both.
He closed his eyes with pleasure when Steve brushed away his hair; when Pietro left, Steve leaned into him, and he put his right arm around him.  His face didn't make many expressions. It was only through his actions that his feelings could be read... if you could call them "feelings."
"I don't- I mean, I've never-"
"How long on the trace?"
"I miss him."
"Sorry.  Sorry, no... you're right... it's okay now..." said Tony, forcing a few slow breaths.  "I don't want any other Alphas--"  He stopped himself.  No.  That wasn't right.  It wasn't about what he wanted; it was about what Steve wanted.  Steve wasn't his.
"Thank you doctor. You too," Steve nodded, sharing a small smile with Gleason as the doctor rose.
hurt me," he whispered.
"For the record, I feel safer with you. Before you, I felt lost; I hated it here, in this century. With you...it feels like home. Like I was supposed to be here. Like all the shit I went through to get here was actually
"Nat, you better have a good reason for calling."
Then he stopped in front of Donner, who looked like he thought Steve was about to eat him alive. Oh dear. "I wanted to apologise for earlier," Steve said. "I didn't mean to get you in trouble."
He focused on licking Steve's hole, tonguing it, letting Steve wiggle under him, Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's legs so he couldn't move too far away.  "Mmmm," he repeated, licking wetly as Steve whimpering above him.
"Yes, I can.  I'm a billionaire," said Tony, teeth clenching a little.
"Favorite book is either
Tony's expression didn't change.  "So?" he asked after a moment.
"Sorry," he blurted.  Goddammit.  This was the second time in two days he'd been unintentionally destructive.  Tony's type of destruction was normally much more conscious and purposeful.  "Sorry, I... it just.... fuck, Steve.  That makes me so goddamn angry.  I didn't know.  I didn't know that happened."
"Merry Christmas."
"Steve? Goddammit, Steve, say something. Are you okay?" Natasha asked, narrowing her eyes at him.
She was already scrambling on stage.  Steve only knew her passingly; Melinda May was a slight Asian woman whose short stature belied her toughness.  Steve had seen her sparring with Natasha, once, impressed by her reflexes.
a man who's got some insecurities," said John loudly, obviously not the slightly bit worried about being overheard.  "Girls, you want a picture with Captain America?"
"No hard feelings," Steve repeated softly and stared down at their fingers tangled together. Bucky's skin was a touch darker; he'd been exposed to more sun. "That's kind of him. I could have caused permanent damage."
"Yes, but rings are different, Tony."
Personally Tony loved Steve's.. well, what Steve would probably call "spunk" or "moxie."  Tony's favorite position with women had always been on his back, hands behind his head, letting them ride him, watching their breasts bounce.  Though Steve was lacking in that particular department, it was still fun to let him go to town. Tony couldn't imagine anyone as timid as Donner or DeSoto having
The door to the roof was locked but he grabbed the knob with his left hand and easily shouldered it open.  The rooftop was snowy, poor visibility. He squinted, cautiously making his way out onto the roof. Yes, there was a dark figure lying on the ground.  Probably his target. And to his left another figure, though he couldn't see who, but figured it was one of the twins. He gave a small, sharp nod of greeting to them, not breaking his stride as he approached the figure lying on the ground.
Across the room, there was the sound of rocks tumbling, a flash of silver, and Rhodey rose unsteadily to his feet, coughing.
Karpov frowned.  "Patience, soldier.  I'll make sure you have first mating rights."
Tony had no interest in manipulating Steve.
Steve froze, his gaze fixed on the wall ahead of him. He dropped the water bottle and it fell to the floor with a sloshing sound, water spilling out onto the expensive carpet.
They went to a small, local cafe so thankfully no one had stopped them to ask for a selfie or autograph. Steve was just in gym leggings and a hoodie. He wasn't really looking his best. And he wasn't really in the mood for interacting with strangers. He was just glad to hang out with Aria and chat about nothing.
It wasn't okay.  The idea of Steve losing his virginity to some other Alpha was revolting.  The idea of Stark with his paws all over Steve made Bucky feel sick.  The idea of another Alpha trying to bite over his mark felt like a very personal violation.
He cleared his throat, trying to get rid of the lump there.
"This?  This will, someday, be the Mark VII," said Tony.  "Before I have the parts printed, I like to get in there myself, build a prototype.  The thing is, all the armors, except for the Mark IV, need a platform or framework to assemble.  See-"
and it inexplicably always works out for me for some reason."
"Yeah, she puked on me yesterday," said George with a grin.  "Banksy and me are helping out, you know, since... since Donnie doesn't have an Alpha."
"You don't have to--" Steve sighed. It was too late. He just gently pulled Tony back down with him, rubbing at his back as he curled against them. He leaned his head so it half rested on top of Tony's and let his eyes slip shut. He let the quiet wash over them for a moment. He savoured it before he broke it again.
"Don't want the sandwich.  Sorry Pep. Whiskey now?"
over Steve like he once had.
lessons?" protested Steve.  "But I want to do another raid!  I'm ready, sir.  They can't hit me with an inducer again.  I want to get back into the field.  I want to fight another battle.  HYDRA doesn't take breaks.  How can I?"
Tony whined insistently.
. Not that it really meant anything... he still wouldn't love Steve. Not like Steve had loved him. His bond with Bucky had made him feel powerless and trapped... with Tony it was totally the opposite.
"Steve," he said.  It was the one word he could think of to say and it was the most important word in the world.  His hands dropped from Steve's scalp and he stepped forward to put his arms around Steve and bury his face in the other's collarbone.  In the shower, all Tony could smell was shampoo, not Steve's new weird scent.
for you Tony. What more can I do to prove it to you?" Steve stared down at his milky tea in his lap. "Avengers or not-- I mean it. I protected your designs from SHIELD; I like to think
And what to do with them afterwards?  They couldn't send them home but Tony didn't want to adopt a person, have them hovering around his house like a permanent DeSoto.  These omegas were here because they couldn't imagine a world without strong guidance from an Alpha. They couldn't just be let go. They'd end up right back here.
So much for the hot anniversary sex he'd been imagining all day.

"Mr. Rogers, do you know your blood type, sir?" asked one of the EMTs.  An omega, like him.  Being called sir calmed him down for some reason.
in the bedroom; he wondered if omegas like Ashtray and Trickshot had just laid there, or if they had fought, or what.  It was chilling to think about.
Steve's question snapped him out of his reverie.
"No, I really shouldn't," said Steve.
"...excited," whispered Donner, who genuinely looked excited.
"...no, you can't talk to Stark, he's..."  Sam cast a look of desperation at Pepper.
"Is that any way to talk to your temporary Alpha?" asked Malick.  Tony's eyes narrowed. "Let's not forget, I won a couple of nights of your regrettably disrespectful company.  Unfortunately for you, I don't like other Alphas, so there won't be any mating. ...I saw the mark on your neck.   Very interesting idea, trying to hide it with a collar."
Steve frowned deeply as he followed the curve of the woman's lips. She was screaming. The same word over and over and soon Steve could make it out.
Donner was still watching Steve.  Though he'd said nothing, Steve had the impression that it was largely due to Pepper, Aria, and Banksy's presence that he hadn't yet bolted.  George had been keeping Steve updated and even after all this time, Donner still spoke fondly of Gideon, although less and less often. There was no doubt in Steve's mind that Gideon could probably sweet-talk Donner right back into a terrible position if he wanted to.
"You might want to avoid that room," he advised her.
have more to select from, if none of these appeal to either of you," jumped in Lydia, who seemed a bit miffed that none of the collars had jumped out to Tony or Steve.  "And if there's elements you like on different pieces, we can always craft something from scratch. These are all one-of-a-kind, signature pieces, but we could easily make anything you could imagine."
“Tony, you’re gonna miss Steve singing!” added Happy.
Bucky.
Steve's eyes narrowed. "Tweeted?" he echoed.  "Is that the bird thing?" He couldn't help but blush at the way Tony looked at him for asking.
Steve moved down with Tony's touch, pliant as he moulded into the sheets and arced up into every touch. He gasped softly when Tony's hands explored lower, bucking up into the touch a little in an automatic reaction. Steve felt his cheeks tinge pink. Would there ever be a time when Tony couldn't make him blush? Probably not...
It was too much for him. Sure, he could deal with the chaos of a battlefield, but this was something else. Steve wasn't fighting, he was supposed to a be part of it and he couldn’t be, he couldn't goddamn
"I called for your doctor. He's waiting inside," she said softly. "Let me know how it goes. I know this isn't fun Steve. Let's just be thankful it lasted a few hours and not a week."
He wouldn't give anything else away as they headed down to the garage. They took the usual car, Steve in the driver's seat as he knew where they were going. It was nice to drive out of their house and have no protesters hanging around for a change. "You wanna put some music on?" he suggested, knowing a lot of unanswered questions hung in there that Steve had no intention of answering. He wanted to surprise Tony. He didn't make the effort to enough.
"Do it, Jarv  One Stark special and one Steve special.  And get something for yourself, too," said Tony, unconcerned with the program.  Like the original Jarvis, JARVIS was a useful household extension and Tony rarely thought of how unnerving normal people might find him.  Yet this time, he felt a pang of unease.
Steve was introduced to so many people from the Status Alliance in so very few minutes that he really could not keep up. But he was all polite smiles and handshakes all the same. Banksy was clearly excited for Steve to meet 'his people' and it he couldn't hardly deny the man on his birthday. Eventually Banksy settled him down with a drink (Jesus, it was strong. It seemed everyone was aware of his metabolism and were trying to compensate) with two young men from Status Alliance. They were around Steve's age, both omegas and he was pretty sure they were a couple...or just overly touchy. Some omegas were like that with each other.
"I was prepared to fight for HYDRA. So I guess I didn't feel in danger...but they sent these kids. I like them. They're not HYDRA. I wasn't prepared to fight them. I should have known they'd send them but I didn't think. I think I just wanted a fight. And I didn't get one," Steve breathed. "I was in a pretty self-destructive mood, I guess. But I imagine that's pretty normal when you've sort of died once already."
Steve tossed the box onto the mattress by Tony's head before he crawled back onto the bed, hovering above his alpha before he leaned down and pressed a kiss to the corner of his mouth. "You're very bossy today," he commented in a murmur, tone fond as he traced his teeth and tongue over the edge of Tony's jaw.
Steve said he would kneel for him.  They'd go home together.  That's all that mattered.
"I'm just gonna go down and grab coffee," Steve told him softly before he pulled away.
Artist and engineer.  Alpha and omega.  They were like puzzle pieces, filling in for each other... fitting together perfectly...
"Ни хуя́ себе́!" said one of the men finally.
Steve laughed a little awkwardly. "Yeah, okay... you seriously don't care that I bonded?"
"Anything."
"Pepper's a beta, that's practically--" began Tony.
"Yes, well, I'm never bored..."
!" she shouted loud enough for them to hear in the corridor before she turned back around, tucking a loose strand of hair back in place. She offered Steve a tight smile, regaining her composure.
.  The mission came first.  And besides, Tony didn’t even know who he really was, who he was really propositioning.  Steve swallowed and looked up slowly from his e-mail inbox on the tablet.  “I tend not to
Tony's eyes lit up.  "It's something

Mackenzie blinked. "I, er, yeah. I guess. Let me just let the Colonel know..."
But there were two factors Steve clearly didn't understand.  First of all, Tony had been asking Pepper out for years and she always said no.  Second of all, Pepper was a beta. Tony liked women, sure. He loved 'em. But Steve's appeal, as an omega, would always outrank that.
"I'm Tony goddamn Stark," said Tony with a shrug.  "If you're not into it, just say it.  It's not rocket science."
Tony reached out and put a hand on Steve's knee, not moving.  He gave Steve a worried look.
Steve turned back, meeting Melinda's gaze with a cold, hard stare. "No," he breathed. "That's on
"Why wouldn't-"
"JARVIS, update me," said Tony, still popping his joints as he walked blearily into the shower.
The people on the TV were ignored. It was all about Tony now. Steve had no words. No, he didn't need an Alpha but that didn't mean he couldn't want one. This said it all.
"I do," said Dr. McDermott.  "But I have a fellowship with UCLA right now to investigate a new type of birth control for omegas.  ...by the way, Captain, Rex and I were quite happy with your Project 84. I've always advocated against conversion therapy, you know.  If any of your... contacts... well, if they need... reconstructive help, I would be happy to donate some of my time. My mate, you know... he was from Pine Hills."
Tony grinned helplessly.  "Yeah and I can demagnetize credit cards, too," he said helpfully.  "That's how come I don't put anything in my breast pocket. Anything too close to it gets zapped."
"Steve," said Natasha, grabbing his upper arms.  "You were frozen and that was a one in a million chance.  Barnes... I don't think he was that lucky.  Maybe HYDRA found him and that's how they knew you were an omega, I don't know.  But have some goddamn common sense, Steve.  The Winter Soldier is dangerous.  He's responsible for over a hundred deaths.  And now you're having dreams and... and, I don't know, hallucinations... Steve.  If you're compromised, you need to tell Director Fury.  This isn't safe.  What if they're trying to lure you to them to kill you, huh?  Did you ever think of that?  That maybe, just
Later, Tony wouldn't be able to really recall any details of the fight.  He felt it was perfectly summed up by a single quote.  As a child, Tony had read
"He touched my neck. He wouldn't stop touching my neck. And then he started pressing on the gland. I could barely speak properly at the time. He kept asking me to kneel for him, wanted me to- me to say he was my Alpha. It's like this sick power fantasy of his.  And then he pulled me up so I was kneeling and I couldn't f-fight back.  I wanted to.  But I couldn't move. He put my head on his knee and he wouldn't stop pressing on the gland behind my ear. It almost hurt."
for him.  This doesn't make any goddamn sense!  How can I be bonded to
"This is
Tony took another sip of coffee, then said, "DeSoto."  He said it a hell of a lot sharper than he meant to. It came hard, stern... like he was channeling his inner Howard or something.
Tony and the other man rolled. Steve didn't know how Tony was doing inside the suit but the HYDRA agent didn't look great. There was blood, but not much of it. The man wasn't dead; Steve could hear him groaning.
Inspiration struck.
"...Steve... you can't just throw forty thou at a Domino's pizza driver."  He looked over at Doug. "Don't worry, Doug, I'm not gonna take it away, it's just that Steve has this habit of throwing money around and it makes my accountant get on my case.  Steve. You're literally doing an education charity thing tomorrow. Focus on that, not on delivery boys." He looked back to Doug. "...don't just stand there, we just gave you forty-two thousand!  Keep pancakin', Doug!" He turned back to Steve and explained, "I already promised him two thousand for the pancakes."
"...what a bunch of stupid fucking names," said Tony suddenly, irritated.
"Cheeseburger," said Tony flatly.
"CORRINE!" barked Tony again.
"He's fine, look, we can reprogram him.  Two words won't undo decades of training."
"Thank you."
"Only me," repeated Tony in affirmation, brushing his fingers through Steve's hair.  He tugged Steve gently toward the bed and pushed him down on to it, crawling after him, on top of him.
Tony abandoned his search and let Jarvis get a mug for him.  "I had the weirdest dream, okay.  Oh my God, it was so weird, Captain America was there, but he was an O, and I had this flying robot suit..."  It was already starting to fade.  "...and my heart was gone and replaced with an arc reactor..."  He slid into a bar stool, putting his elbows up on the kitchen island and waiting for his morning coffee.  He'd only just discovered Fresh press, which was gross, but was what Stane drank, and Tony liked feeling mature.
He didn't exactly consider Natasha a friend but he was looking forward to seeing her.  She was gorgeous, and more importantly, she was clearly
Tony stared at her blankly.
"You too."
"So," said Tony, looking Sam over.  "...army, huh?"
Tony's mind turned toward those motherfucking tulips, and it was like a fist clenched around his stomach, tight and painful.  He couldn't tell if that was from him, or his mate.
"Not typically.  I guess Steve's did, at least partially, anyway, because of the serum."
"Does the Winter Soldier know where you are?" asked Natasha.
"Hey," said Tony softly.  "I'm gonna pull out."  He squirmed under Steve, rolling them over onto their sides and tugging; after a few seconds of slow strain, it managed to work out the knot.  He didn't pull away any more, though; he stayed on the floor, holding Steve in his arms.  "...we'll be fine.  Whatever they ask," he said, a bit more confidently.  "We're awesome, right?  Our bond is awesome.  You're awesome, I'm awesome... yeah.  It'll be fine."  He kissed Steve's shoulder again.
"...it
Steve's pills were on the bedside stand, but since neither of them were mating yet, Tiberius hadn't touched them.  It was a moot point; they could hardly mate while both of them were half-unconscious.

"What do you mean,

"Go," said Rex with a nodt.  "I got your number."
omega.
Tony paused, then threw his palms out and hit the jets, throwing both of them backwards and through a wall, nearly annihilating the DJ, who scrambled out of the way just in time.  His computer went skittering across the floor, still playing Queen.
weird, and I thought bonding was different than dating, I mean.... I mean, you don't have to marry the person you bond with, right?  I mean, you wanna talk about
"He's not doing that anymore."
want to," said Tony, looking up.  "I really want to, Steve. I'm happy when you're happy, remember?  And besides, I want to ensure I get that birthday collar."  He gave Steve a cheekily little grin, then leaned down. A moment later Steve felt something wet between his legs.
He grabbed a handful of smoke bombs and a flash-bang from his belt and threw it.
He had been anxious when he saw them dragged Karpov into the van.  Very anxious. Because he knew what "retirement" meant. Knew where people who was pulled into the back of those vans went.  But even since his confused, rambling story about a sick omega, Karpov seemed back in everyone's favor. And he hadn't been given a retraining session, which he thought was very suspicious.
not perfect.  I'm never gonna be perfect. I've got..."  Tony reached up to rub the back of his neck, where the largest scar was.  "...Fury says I've got more issues than a news stand. ...I know that monogamy is important to you.  I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna go around sticking my dick into every bubble-headed, bleach-blonde bimbo that looks my way.  But I'm gonna flirt. I'm gonna posture.  That's just who I am.  I'm insecure, and I'm a low-dominance Alpha, and I feel like... I feel like I need to prove that.  Like I said.  I'm not perfect.  Trust me, it
Steve set Tony down on his bed and then quickly went to fetch the man a glass of water. As he did he sent a text to Fury:
Yeah, that'd go over well.  Tony was the one who had distanced himself from Steve in the first place.  And if he weren't such a weak Alpha to begin with, maybe Steve's body wouldn't have accepted the other mark.
"I can't wait for Gideon to see us take down Trinity in a matter of hours.  Just wait 'til July," Steve mumbled, trying to sound meaningful and probably coming off as petulant. "I wonder what he's said to Donner about me. There must be something...a reason why he's so convinced I'm 'bad' but thinks that people like Banksy are 'good'."
the kind of Alpha you are?" Natasha demanded, voice soft but vehement with fury.
"...some of the news about us... people are saying, you know.  It's a political move.  Us bonding," adding Tony.  "You're Captain America, national symbol of freedom and justice and... whatever.  And I'm... y'know."  Pause.  "A Stark."  Another pause.  "My company pretty much single-handedly outfitted the entire armed forces for like twenty, thirty years.  ...I've probably killed a hundred, a thousand times more people than you.  People I never met.  Never had to actually look at."  Pause.  "So that's what some people are saying.  That... Captain America, shacking up with an arms dealer... y'know.  It's... political."  He glanced down, picking at a nail, then added, almost viciously, "
"Yours," Steve whispered in affirmation and then Tony was kissing him and it was like fireworks. He couldn't quite comprehend it, his thoughts were on fire. Steve had kissed people before.  Okay, two.  A beta blonde woman whose name he didn't know, and then Peggy, just before Steve went to fight Schmidt.
Steve was laid out, knees lazily tucked against his chest and head leaning on one arm. He was staring at the blank wall in front of him, blue eyes a little glazed over. He didn't look up when Tony walked in. But he heard the liquid pouring into the glass and sighed internally. The fancy blue jacket he'd been wearing was a little ruffled beneath him due to his position but he didn't care.
"What the hell are you doing?  People could be hurt!"
"Well," she breathed. "I'm glad you boys... worked thought it."
He jabbed a finger at Sam.  "I never lied about who I was, or spied on him.  I never even opened his little sketchbook because I actually respected his privacy, which is more than we can say about him.  He kept me in the dark about his old mate, and ever since he came out as an omega, he's been stealing my spotlight while I just tag along as his supportive little partner.  Yeah, he gave me everything, all right, and it was a hell of a lot more than I bargained for. He should've told me everything before I mated him but he didn't, did he? I don't want to be part of some civil rights movement and, unlike you, I don't want to be bonded to another Alpha, so how about you keep the preaching to yourself, homo?" snapped Tony.
"You're a commodity to him. We both are. And we're both better than him. And I'm gonna keep saying that until you believe me, okay? And I know you still don't. And I know you're probably gonna go back to him. But I had to do this, I had to try and prove to you what a sleaze bag he is. You deserve so much better. Because if you go back to him today, after everything, then I'll never goddamn forgive myself."
Tony dialed Tiberius.
"Tony takes what Tony wants," said Pepper.  She examined the wine and then took a deep drink of it, trying to forget about that damn kiss.
ended up in the Avengers he would have to respect Steve as a leader, and the chances of that happening were growing slimmer by the day.  Steve pressed his lips together in a thin line and went to get Tony his usual three (yes, three) fingers of scotch.  He tried not to look as furious as he felt as he sat down after handing Tony his drink.  Though he did maybe sit a little heavily, and tap a little harder than necessary on the tablet.  “...all that stuff about boxes earlier.  What the hell did that ever mean?  I had no idea what you were talking about.”
Steve was having none of it, however. Natasha was quicker, but he was stronger. He backed up her against the car like she weighed of nothing with his forearm pressed against her chest. He forced the phone out of her hand. Steve wasn't afraid of getting in close and he was in no mood for games right now. He glanced down at it. It really was a blocked number. Huh. Steve blinked and then he looked back up to see Natasha's forlorn expression and she sighed.
"That simulator's been approved by the highest authorities," said Sitwell defensively.  "Councilman Pierce--"
Natasha, Clint, and Sam had already stormed in.  Tony had finished retching and was currently still in the storage area, in his suit.  Maybe he wasn't in a place where he was capable of fighting, but that didn't meant he was useless.  Natasha had told him to wipe out their communications after the alarm sounded. It had taken Tony longer than he'd liked to hack in, but now he was scrolling through the source code from within his helmet.  The idiots had everything up on connected servers. They might as well have been uploading shit to a Google dropbox.
"They swapped us around," Steve swallowed, finally speaking up. "Bucky tried to kill Tony and I... I woke up in a chair. The kind they use to..." He trailed off. "Control him? I don't know."  He fidgeted.  His heat made him feel strange, like he was small again.  Even though all of the agents were betas (except Phil) he still felt oddly shy around them.
"But satisfaction brought him back," shot back Tony.  "So, do you guys, do you all cycle together?  Follow-up question, exactly how many accidental pregnancies have you had so far?  Are casual Fridays super awkward when you guys are in heat, or do you just, like, leave bags of ice in the breakroom and pray to the powers that be that everyone's going to act rationally?"
.  How does that even
"Nice shield.  What is it?" asked Steve, draped over Tony's shoulder.
"No, seriously, I have no idea.  What'd I do?" repeated Tony. "Is this about Ty?"
Everyone else looked confused.
"I'm going to read part of the transcript now.
JARVIS put on line 1, keeping his end muted so Tony could listen.
Justin raised his arms.  "

Steve fell asleep again. He couldn't deny that he was exhausted. Keeping himself hidden from both SHIELD and HYDRA had been no mean feat. He liked to think Natasha was secretly proud of him, if a little annoyed.
"  Pepper slapped him again.  "Get ahold of yourself!  ...oh my God, you have a concussion... who's the president, Tony?  When's your birthday?"
had been...
It was enough to make him blush. Captain America blushing, ha. Natasha would hit him if she could see him now.
He strode over and held out his right hand to help them to their feet; the two were a tangle of limbs.
Tony sat up, his body still hunched, tensed, curled into itself.  "It's bad enough you have all these dominant Alpha friends like Natasha and Sam.  You have no idea how badly I wanna just... slam you to the floor and sit on top of you like Smaug guarding his hoard.  (That's a reference you ought to get, by the way.  Tolkien's gotta be at least a century old, right?)  I wanna be supportive of your whole... omega rights thing.  I really do.  But I can't hover over your shoulder getting emotionally castrated over and over.  I mean, Jesus Christ, I was gonna go to the Expo tomorrow and rub you in Justin Hammer's stupid face, and now... can you imagine if people found out I was your second bond?  I mean, you'd look great, you'd look like a total badass omega, handling two Alphas.  But it's embarrassing, Steve.  It's so fucking embarrassing.  You might as well slap a collar on me and lead me around like a little dog."  A pause.  "I mean, it's sexy in the bedroom, but I'm talking about, you know... in public, at SHIELD, shit like that."  Another pause.  "Can I
Tony smiled a little and leaned in to kiss Steve's neck.  "I love this one," he mumbled happily.
Cooper grinned around a mouthful of toast. "I want to be an omega and I want to save people like Captain America does.  And drive a tank!"
"Don't talk to
went and got the collars?  You hated trying them on in front of people. I could just pick 'em out myself, if that'd be easier for you."
Banksy blinked.  "According to
Tony sulked.  He was remembering now why he hadn't wanted to talk to Peggy after his parents' death.  She had too many fond memories of Howard, someone Tony would probably always resent. Obadiah had known about Howard's drinking, how angry he'd been later in life.  Peggy's memories were kinder, gentler, and they didn't mesh with Tony's view. He had no fond memories of his father and even if he had, they wouldn't have made up for the fact that Tony held Howard personally responsible for the car accident that had killed him and Maria.  Tony was certain he'd been drunk and that it was Howard's selfish self-pity that had made Tony lose his parents.
When Tony appeared he let out a breath he hadn't realised he'd been holding. He let out a trembling exhale.
They headed out of the conference room, toward the elevator. Steve ducked his head down to try and talk to Piper. "What's your guys plan for the rest of the day?"
"Are we done now?" Steve asked.
"...you've been letting me call Natasha Dark Angel when you were the Dark Angel all this time?"
Agent Simmons looked at Steve in surprise.  She'd assumed he was in critical condition from the way Tony was acting, but Steve looked fine.
Tony had quietly, discreetly, and rather guiltily looked up one of Frond's books: "The Omega Mind."  It had been shockingly informative. Frond--
"I find confidence to be one of the most attractive traits in any person, regardless of status," said Tony petulantly.
much better after he peed. He sighed in relief and slump back down, his arm brushing against Bucky's metal one. Now it was just a waiting game, to see if the kiss had actually done anything. Maybe they wouldn't come...but maybe they would. Steve didn't want to be kept here, bred, studied, an unwilling pawn in HYDRA's game.  When he'd said before that he would rather die, he was serious... but he really didn't want it to come to that.

him, to fill him so full that even if another Alpha tried to take him it would be impossible because Tony would have already thoroughly used him.
, man."  He slung an arm around Steve and handed him a couple of-- what, pills?  Candy? They were baby blue and reminded Steve of Smarties, a candy he actually remembered from the forties.
"Thanks."
He looked embarrassed, and Charlie began grinning.  "You wanted to take Captain America sight-seeing through Washington DC, didn't you?"
Charlie was the pilot.  Steve had seen her in passing, though she'd never spared him more than a glance before.  She was a short young female Alpha with a boy's haircut who looked like she should be climbing trees, not piloting jets; she dressed in t-shirts and wore headphones, and Steve had once overheard her complaining about breaking her collarbone on a skateboard.  He had no idea where Tony had found her.
, was Steve's immediate thought. He didn't voice it out loud.
He sat back down on the end of the bed in his faded, baggy Jack Daniels shirt, still uncertain.  "...Steve? Can I hold you?" he asked in a small voice.
The only thing preventing Tony from attacking her was that he was still on top of Steve, but his body was tense, ready for any sudden movements or aggressions.
"So if you inherit the LMG-2 gene, you can have a beta allele but still be an Alpha or an omega.  You're basically a carrier.  Otherwise, most Alphas and omegas are homozygous.  It's a recessive trait, hence the lower number in the population compared to betas."
"...what did you think--"  Pepper's jaw dropped. "
lose. This is it. It's over-" griped Tony, managing to rip the whip off of him and get up.  Vanko was lying on the ground, chest sparking, and the drones around them were lifeless, their chests blinking red- on stand-by, maybe?  He let out a shaky sigh and turned.
There was a knock on the door but it didn't open.  Banksy rolled his eyes. "Okay, okay, I think I've got to return you before Keisha murders me.  Also I need to go make sure Boz is wearing that hat." He rose and opened the door for Steve with a winning smile.
-- but there was none of that.  Mostly, he just felt happy.  Being around Steve was an all-encompassing feeling of wellness, one that overwhelmed any misgivings Tony might have had.  Even with Pepper and Rhodey being mad at him, he still couldn't feel much trepidation.
"...it was dece," said Tony as the elevator came to their floor.  He and Steve made their way to their suite. It had been a surprisingly tense day, for both of them.  Tony felt like one of the drawbacks to being bonded to a civil rights leader was constantly being aware of civil rights.  The locked collars, Jane's innocent remark... all of it gave Tony an unsettled feeling. And since he and Steve could feel each other, every time one grew bothered, so did the other.  One of the drawbacks to having that link.
She laughed.  "You're still funny."
"That could take days, sir."
"That's normally what I do," replied Tony quietly.  There was no grand secret to his process. On March 15th, he stood by the graves for a while, then went back to the hotel, drank a fifth, and passed out for a day or two.
"Tony, tell us more about your theory," said Pepper, trying to redirect him.
phone) from the omega's hands.
He felt a sudden lurch of emotion.  It was from Tony.
"Already been," Steve waved off his concern and dropped into the backseat with a relieved sigh and a thank you. Even the car smelt like Tony a little.  It was comforting after the day he'd had. He curled into the seat, willing the smell to be stronger.
thought Tony grimly.  He could hear Steve talking on the phone in the other room but couldn't make out what was being said.
"I'll come back," promised Tony.  "...don't wanna leave you
now. He rubbed a hand over his face and sat up in bed, one of Tony's arms lingering around his waist, his Alpha's robe pooling around his thighs.
Tony found Steve's hand and gave it a squeeze.  His mate felt uncharacteristically worried. Not nervous, just... out of place.  Poor Steve, thought Tony. It was unfair to make him give these huge press conferences so soon after being force-bonded.  He needed his privacy.

"And I told
Tony cringed.  "
"That
"--you know we can't use them.  They're feral.  Too dangerous.  We need Rogers."
That word instantly moved Tony.  He ripped off his faceplate and tore across the room.  "Steve! Steve!"
!  Are you serious?  Oh, that is so old-timey and cute!"
...Stan was his PA.
"Stephen," corrected Donner before he could help himself, then quickly mumbled an apology.  Then, for some reason, he corrected the Alpha a second time: "It's Donner now."
Her voice dropped. "You're a good omega, even if you're not very well trained." She gave him a deadly smile, then turned away, a nonverbal dismissal.
"I won't. I'll be better." Steve breathed and leaned forward. He rolled onto his front and edged closer, a strange coil tightening in his belly as he leaned forward to nuzzle Tony's crotch before he mouthed at his Alpha's member through his boxers.
Steve could smell food coming up the stairwell into the bedroom, and his stomach growled. He was pretty sure he heard Pepper's voice downstairs but didn't really feel like going down. When he said he didn't feel like seeing anyone else today he'd meant it. Pepper was a friend but...he didn't want to see the way she'd look at him. He'd gotten enough looks of pity off of the nurses to last a life time. Why did people feel so sorry for him when he'd done this to himself?
. I felt him with me. He touched my face and he had his voice." Steve's own broke a little then. He ran a hand over his face and breathed out slowly, his shoulders sagging down. "I know it was him.  I know what his presence felt like, I'll never forget it and that is
"Who?" Clint piped up. "Sam?"
Steve laughed again, in relief this time, his shoulders shaking. He almost wanted to cry, he was so relieved. Steve peeked over at Tony between his forearms and shook his head. "I was real scared for a second there. Jiminy Christmas. Let's never do that again."
and then I am going to
"What, what is it?" asked Pietro, hurrying over.
"They were bonded before," said Tony suddenly.  "That's why Bucky did it, isn't it? He didn't rape Steve.  He bonded him, and the reason why is that he already had a claim.  Because they were already bonded. Everyone keeps talking about Steve being force-bonded.  But it was his old mate. Bucky was just... reclaiming him."
Had it really be forced?  Pietro was sure Bucky would do all sorts of awful things if instructed, without even a second thought.  For the first time since they'd met, Pietro felt uneasy around the Alpha. Wanda was right; he was unaccountably strong, treated with a serum similar to Steve's... with the prosthetic arm, he was almost unstoppable.  If he wanted to take an omega, even one like Captain America, he probably could. Pietro was fast but if Bucky got the upper hand or the element of surprise, that was that.
omega!  But save it for the interview!"
"Okay, okay, chill out... let me call Aria, she was with his this morning, maybe she knows what's up."  Tony called Aria, who picked up after two rings. "Hey, Aria, any clue where Steve is?"
"Tell Olivia I'm dead."
Tony climbed clumsily over Steve, eager to get inside him, turning the phrase
Tony pulled his pillow over his head, feeling awful, shaky and weak and cold.  He found himself hoping that, where ever Steve was, he was having a better day.
Tony honestly wondered at how he managed to stay so in love with Steve.  The average length of a relationship for Tony was a handful of months. And yet, they were ten months into being bonded and... well, there had been that terrible two and half months, and Yemen... but aside from that... aside from that, as they approached a year, Tony still feel a magnetic pull toward his mate.
," Steve wheezed, pressing down on the wound on his leg and wincing a little. He was ruining Kate's car, that was for sure. He was okay for now, but he wasn't sure he could last it out for an entire plane ride. "I mean..." he slumped back. "I
He had gotten so used to compulsively touching the reactor over the last few weeks that it took an enormous amount of willpower not to snap it out then and there and check it.  Watching the palladium cores oxidize inside of him, watching the reactor discharge into his chest and poison him, Tony had come to hate the thing.  It was funny, how first he'd hated it, then love it, then hated it... now he supposed he loved it again.  After all, it was no longer killing him, and Steve didn't seem to mind it.
Steve swallowed the pill. In that moment he would have done about anything anyone asked of him. He was too far gone to even feel embarrassed at Tiberius seeing him like this. God, he didn't have a care in the world. Heats were funny like that.
yet, then we've gotta watch that.  Do you have a computer?  Give me five minutes with a computer and I can probably jack your neighbors' Wifi and download it."  He looked around the room.  Lots of books and paintings and stuff.  Not a lot of technology.
"So, Steve, do you think it's because you're from the forties and representation an old form of omega stereotypes that people like to think of you as virtuous?"
He felt someone press something against the back of his neck and he hissed softly.  It hurt.
He didn't respond.
"You are
"Was this back in the forties?" Louis clarified.
!  ...Pietro, did something happen?"
"Love you.  G'night," mumbled Tony, curling up against Steve's body.  The shop would be there in the morning, he figured.  It was past nine.  Normally, Tony was a night owl; his dusk was other people's dawn, and he'd spent a lot of mornings watching the sun come up from his balcony, a cup of coffee in his hand, before crashing into bed, hard.  With Steve around, he'd noticed his sleep schedule was starting to resemble a normal person's.
"I said
Steve had been about to answer him.  Fury was grabbing him and dragging him out, even as air was flooding his lungs again and he was gasping out ragged breaths of relief. "No-no-no! It's him! I'm not- it's
"...did you just say please?" asked Beth in surprise.  She put the car into gear. "...okay, fine, we'll drive around, but I really think you'd be better off trying to track him.  Can't you hack his ankle bracelet or something?"
Fuck.
"Stan, come on, come dance with me!" shouted Tony, bolting for the stairs gleefully.  The main staircase was an elegant curl; everyone cheered when they saw him descending and he flung his arms out.
On the other line, Clint was trying to remember if he had ever mentioned having a brother to Steve.  He was pretty sure he had. It wasn't a secret, either. It was in his file. He had one sibling, estranged, whereabouts unknown.  That was that. Not uncommon for a SHIELD agent, frankly. Natasha's file, for example, listed both parents as unknown and her birthday as unknown as well.  (They assigned her the first of January for legal purposes.)
, because right now, I just want to get to know
When Pepper spotted Steve she turned to kiss his cheek, too. Steve felt closer to Pepper than he did to Tony, admittedly. She was more open towards him. She was a cool and collected beta, and he admired her.  "We did okay," Steve murmured to her, and she knew that meant that Tony hadn’t drunk too much. But that he'd still drunk something. She was worried about his drinking habits, understandably so.
"I've been in preheat before and I was running home. And I broke this guy's nose to keep him away from me," Steve said, looking incredibly proud of himself.  "Bucky was
"Map," said Bucky automatically.
Kerry looked confused about why Tony had asked for a cigarette if he didn't smoke, but she was too busy holding him up to ask.
). Irshad was gently nudging all her cubes of jelly onto his plate.
"Pep, where are we going, the party's down here--"
He lit a cigarette, his second to last one, and stood stock-still by the side of the road, hoping his purpose would reveal itself in time.
If Steve wanted to shrug him off he could probably fling him across the room like Tony was nothing more than a kitten.  And yet Maggie Frond, all 5'3" of her, had somehow temporarily turned Steve off. ...was SHIELD aware you could do that? Was HYDRA?  ...or was it just that she had surprised Steve? That was probably it; he had been caught off guard. If he'd expected it, he probably would have broken her in half.
"Right, but you'd still need more than one," said Phil.
He turned his head to kiss Tony's temple. "We could just stay in bed? Ignore the jungle down here?"
"Steve?!" he exclaimed, looking around wildly.
heat with your Alpha.  Steve."
The longer Tony waited the more Steve began to anticipate what was coming, his mind racing with possibilities. The collar was still a little cool on his neck despite Tony warming it up, almost pleasantly so. And the weight around his neck was familiar and possessive. Steve exhaled softly, feeling the press of metal against skin.
Happy did what Pepper couldn't; he stuffed the end of his shirt into Tony's mouth.  Tony let out a muffled growl, thrashing.  "I'm sorry, Mr. Stark," said Happy.
He, Eric, and two others slipped out onto a balcony to smoke cigars while Jessica Simpson gave a performance (none of them were into pop music; in fact, they all had a great discussion about classic rock and metal), and as the sun set, the four of them leaned into the cool night air chatting about life as Alphas who were sons of Alphas.  (The topic had come up while talking about the recent smattering of omegas coming out as such. Tony had mentioned Happy's theory about Eminem being the next reveal and everyone had heartily agreed; a short, skinny blond? Likely candidate, though currently, he swore up and down he was a beta.)
"Oh yeah?  Do this." Tony's hackles prickled.
"You're going to have a panic attack."  Pepper hated to admit it, but she'd seen this coming a million miles away.  Tony reacted to commitment like he was allergic to it. Frankly, she was impressed she and Steve had managed for seven months without any upsets.
The nest?  Hm. Their "nest" wasn't really a "nest" so much as a pile of sweat- and semen-covered blankets bunched up into the corner of a now-ruined couch.  Oh well. It was getting the job done, for what that was worth.
"...fucking hell,
Steve slumped down on the sofa with Tony laid on top of him, still feeling dazed and light-headed as his vision settled on the smashed vase on the table. They were safe here, he reminded himself. Rhodey was on top of it. They had suits...they were safe. Steve sighed and let his eyes slip shut. He was warm and full of Tony's spent and Tony himself. Right now Steve couldn't think of any feeling that was better.
"You don't have to take that," said Tony firmly.  "Not if you don't want to.  Steve, listen to me."  Tony took Steve's face in his hands and tilted it to to look at him.  "You're mated to the single most technically superior person in the world.  I'm going to find out everything,
Steve smiled at him. "I think I'd rather go naked."
Steve sighed and closed his eyes. "What are you thinking?" he asked, wishing he'd taken his clothes off too. He was probably ruining his trousers and waistcoat, creasing them as he leaned into Tony's touch. But if it was just an omega audience he was sure he could get away with jeans and a t-shirt for dinner. That would be more comfortable, at least.
Satin gave Tony his coffee and then showed them around the rest of the rooms. They cleared the omegas out and told them they would have to go to the lobby. They didn't look happy about it but they seemed willing enough to comply. None of them looked like Clint, or even a distant relative. Steve felt oddly deflated, like they'd failed.
"You're not supposed to know about that!"
"Hey."  Steve appeared by Piper's side. Eric was in an animated conversation with another Alpha, probably about collars, or something. "Can we talk for a minute?"
"Is it about Clint?" pressed Tony, who hated being left out of conversations and could think of no other reason Fury might be calling.  They had not called Clint to inform him of the possible discovery of his brother. Fury shouldn't know about that, but Fury had a way of finding things out.  Tony was willing to bet money he knew all about Project 84 and that it was entirely possibly he knew about their search for Trickshot. Clint, blissfully unaware, was currently stationed out in the southwest, guarding the Tesseract, which, he had assured Steve, was a very boring, stable position.  He had not asked for any more info on his brother. Perhaps it was just too painful, or perhaps he didn't realize they'd found out more.
Tony was right; he did smell and Steve really did need a shower.
"Well," said Pepper, checking her phone.  "The
?" he asked, clearly fascinated.
mouthed one of the doctors again.
Maybe he'd just been through his heat. Yes. That was it. It was the day after boxing day. Bucky had gone out the night after Christmas and brought her home. Steve had squeezed a pillow around his ears to try and avoid hearing the banging in the bedroom. He'd cried silently and angrily as he'd watched the odd firework being let off from their neighbors outside.
"...Steve.  You're causing quite a stir," said Fury.  He didn't sound thrilled. "Sometimes I get the idea you like getting beat down.  You realize you're picking a fight with a guy bigger than you, right? Gideon Malick is second in command at the World Security Council, and just because you've been decommissioned by SHIELD doesn't mean we're not keeping a close eye on you.  Malick's trying to open up a case against Stark and his weapons again. Seems to think a guy who crashes black-tie events drunk in his underpants shouldn't have access to anything capable of bringing down a fighter plane. Hard to argue with that."
Steve sighed softly as Tony nuzzled against him. "You don't need a gland to get me at your feet Tony," he said, a voice a touch softer now. "That's what a real Alpha is. Someone who doesn't rely on biology to assert themselves.  Real leaders lead by commanding respect.  Not fear."
Pepper was having an increasingly difficult time putting up with Tony.  She cared about him, inexplicably; he was self-absorbed and immature and often downright rude, but he was also a brilliant person who cared about the company, cared about social issues (despite pretending not to), and a hell of a lot of fun.  That being said, over the last year, Tony's actions had twisted from "eccentric" to "self-destructive."  His usual neuroses and compulsions (and there were plenty) had spiraled out of control and at this point, Pepper felt that, unless he was dying, his behavior had passed the line from eccentric to inexcusable.  She had called to try to rein him in again, since it was his name on the side of her building and he was making Stark Industries look bad; she had been ready to have a firm, possibly aggressive argument.  But hearing Steve on the other line had disarmed her.  She would have been able to handle the sleepy voice of some ditzy woman half Tony's age; she was used to that.
Pepper looked up to see Steve coming down the stairs in a dressing gown. It was one of Tony's but it was long enough to keep him decent. He offered her a tired smile. "Coffee?" she offered.
"...can I ask you something and you won't hate me?" asked Tony, voice low.  "...I think you're hot as fuck, Steve. That's why... well... I guess that's why I hired you back when you were spying on me, and why I was always teasing you and arguing with you, and then... then when I found out who you really were... I guess that's also why I decided I had to have you.  And the reason this has worked is that you're not just your looks. You're also this... insanely noble person. I mean, seriously, it's infuriating, sometimes I just wanna smack you, you're so...
At last Tony couldn't be scared of Steve leaving him for Bucky now, now that they knew he was barely a person. He was broken. He was a shell. He needed therapy, and friends. Not a mate. Steve wasn't sure if he could ever be capable of that after what they'd done to him. And he certainly wasn't capable of consenting to anything more.
Steve smiled politely. "They were in my jacket. And, you see, for some very odd reason...I wasn't allowed to wear my jacket."
"Oh-- okay.  Yes. I can call George," agreed Donner meekly.
Grabbing Steve around the waist felt weird in the suit; Tony had gotten used to being the smaller, shorter one, but the suit changed that.  Now Tony was the bulky one. He was glad he couldn't easily smell Steve, couldn't feel his skin. Right now, he wanted to think of them as Captain America and Iron Man, not Tony and Steve.
"What do you mean by....a 'test run'?" Steve asked. Christine was rushing over with a dust pan and brush to clear it all up.
Tony's heart was pounding with panic.
"We'll look after each other," said Tony, and offered Ty a hand.  They gave each other a friendly shake. Tony was getting used to the creepiness of his smell.
Steve Rogers," she stated, the lift doors flicking shut behind her.
that... would you do anything different?  Everyone says they would.  But I wouldn't.  I like to think I would but I wouldn't, I'd do the same shallow bullshit..."
Maybe it was the kind of thing they taught in sex ed but no one talked about after.
"Not long."  Tony was pulling a small circuit board out of the box.  It was covered in chips; Sam pulled up his goggles to look, curious.  "Lemme think... wow, shit, they should fire their contractors... look at this, it's like the Amish built it, this design is terrible..."  With incredible delicacy, considering the weight and size of his gauntlets, Tony teased a pair of chips from the board, then began scratching at a small copper line on its surface.
"Takosubo syndrome?"
"Captain Rogers?"
Steve had always had a good moral compass, or at least felt like he had. But right now he had absolutely no idea what the right thing to do was. Tony was on his side, Steve reminded himself. But he just didn't want it to be true, that Bucky could...do that.
"That's not the man who comes home with me," Steve murmured in explanation. Arcadia seemed to consider this.
"No.  I want to talk about Steve Rogers," said Bucky.
He met Tony's gaze almost timidly. "Please," Steve murmured. He didn't want to think about HYDRA, or the winter soldier. Just Tony. "Tell me how to be good for you."
have let him mate me if I knew you were still alive. I swear. And now I can't even ask for your forgiveness because you don't fucking understand!"
as his body worked through the inducer. Another spasm and Steve jolted, falling down onto the ground as his knees gave way beneath him. The pain went away again but lingered achingly in his belly. It made him feel sick. He was so confused between pleasure and pain, his body dancing between the two.
"And how are you finding the 21st century, Captain?"
Tony pushed himself to his feet and went to the bedroom to drag Steve's sheets into the living room and make a nest on the couch.  Tony had always had only two modes: wired, manic, and restless... or sinfully lazy.  He felt that the events of the last few days entitled him to a few sinfully lazy ones.  The only real problem was the lack of alcohol.  He was tempted to see if he could steal another bottle off Sean-Down-The-Hall, but Sean had creeped him out a little last time, so he decided against it.
"Fine, fine, fine.  Thanks, man. Seriously, we owe you one."
"For Tony," amended Pepper with a little smile.
Banksy paced a little, then began rambling again.  "He's in great health, really, he's very active, you know, he takes the stairs every day to the production office.  He's going to be fine, right? We caught it super early. When we came here he was holding my hand and looking right at me."  He looked from Danielle back to Steve, desperately.
He nodded.
...his mate was panicking.
He leaned back into Tony's touch on instinct and smiled.
Pepper gave Tony a pained look.  "No... no, Pine Hills was... it was bad, Tony."
"Tony!" cried Pepper, jumping up and rushing to him.  She knew, immediately, what had happened. Tony's eyes had that unfocused look they got when he went into a panic attack.
the priority here, do you understand?"  Steve asked, stealing a glance sideways at him. "We're going to hot wire a bike. I'll leave money in this car." Then it sort of wasn't stealing. "Then we're going to get the hell out of here.  And I don't
"...also a reindeer name," said Tony, wisely.  As a child, he had thought Nixon was a reindeer because that's how his father had read it.

"According to the

"I'm okay if you're okay," he whispered. Not even thinking about his phone. It didn't matter. It could wait. Steve would no doubt hurt himself reaching out to it in the first place. He settled back, letting his legs fall down either side of Tony as it ached to keep them curled around him. He hummed softly, eyes heavy lidded.
was twice his size.  Steve was huge and the idea of a regular person kicking his ass in a back alley was ludicrous.
"Everything is," said Tony.  "We kinda had to leave in a hurry."
.  Was she following them?  Tony eyed her suspiciously.
Steve felt the very slightest brush of Bucky's nose on the back of his neck, just behind his ear.
"--but aliens are invading New York and only Iron Man can stop them," said Pepper, eyeing Tony.
Well, that answered that then.  Steve should have known better than to expect any sort of transparency from Nick, who was, after all, a spy.  But then, Peggy had been, too, and so was Natasha.  If Steve was honest, he'd always had a bit of a soft spot for spies.
Tony knew Steve could feel his trepidation.  He knew Steve could feel how anxious he was.  But not knowing was worse. Tony would rather know.  Even if it wasn't his mark, he'd learn to accept it. The important thing was that Steve was in his bed, not Bucky's, and that Steve had chosen him, not Bucky.
Tony felt a stab of guilt.  Right. Alphas-only.
Tony staggered after Joey, only because he felt so completely numb and didn't know what else to do.
"I know you have a lot of issues with the Horseshoe Society," Steve said and Ty hummed noncommittally. "But if we don't present a united front we're never going to win this fight. As long as we're divided then it's easier for people to ignore or dismiss us. I'm not asking you to play nice. I'm just asking you to be open to reason. The Horseshoe Society are just trying their best, as are you."
- Tony/Apollo
"The Winter Soldier bit you.  We were hoping you could fill us in on the details of your incarceration."
Pepper gave Steve a look of sympathy.  When Tony actually remembered birthdays, he went crazy.
into you, Steve, you... the way you smell... your smell..."
"Brute force 'em."
Steve and Tony both became indignant. "Hey-!"
"No.  I'm one of the agents who followed them here to make sure something like
"...not sure," said Hill flatly, digging through one of Tony's desk drawers and pulling out a gun already fitted with a silencer.  "As much as I'd love for SHIELD to come get us out of this one, if it's only two teenagers, I think we should go on the offensive. They won't be expecting it.  If I can bring the girl down, then it's game over. Once we neutralize them, Nick can come pick them up."
?  I wanna join the team. I wanna be there, Steve.  Iron Man could use a couple of sidekicks."
The other man looked at it, brow furrowed, clearly trying to work out whether or not this was some kind of trick.  (It was. Tony's phone was a StarkTech III and changing time stamps on text messages was child's play to him.)
The press release passed by in a strange sort of blur. Aria came around for it, so she and Tony actually met for the first time. She and Pepper were clearly good, or at least old, friends, and exchanged a hug of sorts. Aria's attention was focused on Steve, not Tony; still, she offered him a small nod and told him it was good to meet him in the flesh. So much of Steve's life was affected by Tony, she felt she knew the man already... and admittedly, Steve had completely changed Aria's previous conceptions of him. Before she just assumed he was just another brash Alpha who was a womanizer and a party animal. But Steve had showed her a completely different side of him. If Aria had met Stark a year ago she probably wouldn't have been so polite.
An old habit, one he'd learned in the forties.
"...we can get you a pizza.  What kind?"
"I was at Pine Hills," said Tiberius, and Phil looked horrified.
He tried to look at the photo album in his hands but it was impossible to focus because Steve was giggling at the wealth of pictures Peggy had of Tony's family.
Natasha looked oddly domestic in the doorway of the farmhouse in her large coat. A strange sensation bubbled up in Steve's chest.
his Alpha."
Despite being technically out of practice Steve worked efficiently. The first guy he elbowed in the throat then kneed in the temple before he snapped around punched another the jaw, the impact of which was apparently enough to put him down. Bullets flew but there was smoke everywhere still. Steve dropped another grenade.  He was better at fighting blind than most people were with full senses.  For him this was as simple as breathing. It was what he was
Despite his bravado Trickshot looked grateful at the reassurance and nodded.
His appearance had changed drastically.  He'd lost noticeable weight, grown a full beard, and looked like he hadn't slept in days.  He was also much paler, as if he'd stopped going outside altogether, which was pretty much exactly the case.
Steve was grateful she didn't assume he wanted to go back to Tony, immediately.
"Cher and Sting are singers.  Oh, wait, no, actually, Ellen DeGeneres, never mind," said Tony, snapping his fingers as he remembered her last name.
Tony heard Pepper before he saw her.  Not her usual business-style click of stilettos, but the tread of her tennis shoes.  Tony turned as much as he could without hurting Steve to see a pair of yoga pants. He looked up.  Pepper was looking away.
Tony eyed him for a moment, then shook his head.  "No way. I want to get my vacation started. Me and Steve have been planning this for months."  He wheeled around the pointed to Pepper. "Are you gonna call her?"
"If I hadn't been allowed in the army then history might have played out differently," Steve pointed out coolly. He didn't usually blow his own trumpet. But Steve had potentially saved a lot of people but from a lot of bad things happening to them. Who knew what would have happened if Schmidt was allowed to carried on? Would someone else have stopped him?
"Coffee?" offered Mackenzie.
Steve kissed him, and Tony kissed him back, gently, softly, eyes fluttering closed.
How long had he been asleep?  He'd gone down at seven but the light coming in from the west windows was long and hazy and orange and he felt completely disoriented.
Tony reacted without thinking, hitting the jets and getting out of the way a second before the gun went off.
Richard blinked. "Well. That's an alarming question."
"So?  Can you use him?" asked the man in the suit, Mr. Pierce.
Tony swallowed.  Steve had said he would.  It was practically an invitation to ask.
This was an ongoing conversation.  Bucky would often ask about feelings.  Sometimes, Wanda would point to a person in a magazine and say, "She's happy," or, "He looks concerned."  Bucky would take notes. The whole thing was exhausting to the twins, but at least it provided a distraction.
"Fuck
"Aww.  What do you want, a martini?"
"Here you go," Aria handed him a cup. Steve smiled gratefully. "Sorry we woke you." She definitely was not sorry.
"...to our first year together, I guess," said Tony, smiling at Steve.
Tony stole a few peeks at Steve when Steve removed the towel to fluff his hair out.  His body looked as perfect as ever. The bite on the back of his neck had healed rapidly and was now a shiny pink. It disappeared under a high-collared jacket.  Yes, Tony had decided, the other mark would certainly fade.  It only looked bad because it had been infected.  That was all.
me for not getting a good enough squirrel get-up?"  Tony smirked. He was clearly intent on taking the squirrel costume bit as far as he could.
Aria grabbed a box of pills and waved them in front of Steve's face. "Steve! Listen carefully. You have to take one of these an hour, okay? I've set alarms on your phone. This is very important. Steve, do you understand?"
Natasha rolled her eyes.  "Эти шрамы... они не от ветряной оспы," she observed, leveling Steve with a questioning look.
"Partial," repeated Pepper, sounding exceedingly disappointed.
"Hi, Ty.  It's me. I got a... sort of weird favor to ask."
No. This couldn't be happening. It couldn't.
She maneuvered Steve around.  Tony wasn't a super soldier by any stretch of the imagination, but adrenaline had done its job and he had managed to give Steve a rather large bump on his head when he'd brought the potted plant down on it.  Pepper looked over at the orchid lying on the floor. "Sam... can you put that in a glass or something?" she asked. "And clean up these shards so no one else gets cut? ...get him some water... Steve? Steve, if you're going to be sick, you need to let me know, okay?"  She tried to move his head so that he was looking at her, but his eyes weren't focusing and he was mumbling a stream of apologies without acknowledging anything she was saying.
He was trying to untangle a pile of copper wires when Steve came up behind him.  Tony sensed him before Steve said anything, but still let Steve speak, not wanting Steve to know how much attention Tony was paying to him.
The Winter Soldier knew he was being laughed at.  His eyes narrowed.  But not before he spotted Karpov.  Saw the look on his face, one of disappointment and hurt.  And then saw the two men who grabbed him, began shoving him into the van.
Steve froze underneath Tony,  his hands fisting in the sheets. He almost had the Brooklyn accent. It was unnerving and creepy. Steve wasn't sure how many more heats he could go through like this. He felt sick at the knowledge that Bucky was awake. He'd already felt crippled with the guilt of putting him in cryo, no matter how many times Phil assured him he did the right thing. But knowing that Bucky was waking up alone and in pain because of him...it wasn't almost too much. Steve wanted to  be a good person; he was

Steve hesitated and then brought the water back to his lips. The lack of sight was making him paranoid, he knew, and during his heat things
Nick sighed again. "How reassuring."
"...hey," he said softly when Steve inched in.  It struck Tony, not for the first or last time, how strangely intimate their relationship had become.  He had never been this close to literally anyone else in his entire life, not even Pepper. He had bonded Steve out of pure instinct, without thinking of the long-term implications of a lifetime partnership.  Without realizing that, for the rest of his life, he would have another person to share his defeats and triumphs with.
"Why would a camp--" began Tony.
Vanko laughed.  "I quit."
...then you can touch as much as you want. But right now, you shower and you sober up. Come on. I'm not getting in there with you."
"I don't care about your status if you don't care about mine," he offered with a weak smile.
"Hey, what the hell, that's our dog!  What did you do that for?" yelled the man.  The dog was already coming back.
"...the nearest bar."
"Are you seriously telling me they're all going to die after going through all this shit?" he asked, voice a little more high pitched than usual.
"You could slow down.  There's no timeline on this.  You'll figure it out eventually; the answers are in your head.  You won't find 'em if you keep getting knocked around by big pieces of metal."
He gasped when he felt Tony's knot nudging at his entrance already. Steve's blush darkened a fraction. He cried out softly as he sank down onto his knot, now
Mackenzie held Tony's shoulders firmly, guiding him out of the room; Tony was too upset to say any words.  One of the sergeants threw Steve's arm around his shoulders and half-carried, half-dragged him out. Donner waddled after them.
"Even if you're at home, in heat, I can be on the phone with you, tell you what's up," offered Tony.  He doubted the camps could be any worse than he'd already seen in the Middle East. And he knew Steve would be unhappy to miss it.
"We'll shower when we get back," Steve told Tony quietly. He would have reached out to rub his back but he wasn't sure if his touch would be quite welcome right now.
He watched Tony cook, or at least, try to cook. The sight was sweet. Steve leaned his head in his hands and let his eyes slip shut briefly.
"Are you okay?" Steve asked softly, hesitating before he started up the engine.
Who said he was going to die, though?
"He's fine, Tony-- Tony, down!" commanded Pepper, snagging the collar of his shirt.  She shot Steve and Aria a look of apology. "That song gets him all wound up," she explained.  "...but we watched on his phone and you looks fantastic up there, Steve. And Tony's all done drinking now and he's going to go to the party-- I mean, function-- with you and
Tony spread his arms.  "I can't help it! Sometimes thoughts just pop into my head, okay?  I'm a
The back of his neck was beginning to itch as the blood dried. It felt uncomfortable and confusing. His bite mark before had been singular, a calling-- now it was mixed up with messages. He couldn't tell what was him, Bucky or... Tony.
.  Pin them down.  Sink his teeth into flesh.  Sink his--
Tony peeked out through his fingers, still visibly shaking.
Tony's face blanched and he tore out of the room like it was on fire.  Maria turned back to Steve.  "I'm going to need a statement- this is a PR disaster. Fury is on the phone right now with the Department of Defense and we're about two minutes away from a federal indictment.  What the hell happened, Rogers?"
"One or two drinks a night," said Tony.
He gently pulled away from Steve, threw on a robe, and went to get the door.  He opened it, squinting at the bright sunshine. It was brisk out. A rather excited-looking omega was standing there on the stone steps in a Domino's uniform, clutching a couple of boxes.
It... it
Tony matched Pepper's breathing, trying to calm himself down.  "...is it always this bad?" he asked, feeling like a child.  Tony couldn't ever remember feeling this out of control.  Not that he had much experience, but he was certain Jarvis never prompted quite this strong a reaction from him.
, but you just wanna make a point, don't you?  You just want something you can burn afterwards, feel like the strong, independent omega you are.  Bet it's real fuckin' easy to feel independent when your Alpha is basically just a glorified beta."
"Hey!  ...you have
.  He bet this didn't happen to other Alphas.  He bet Alphas like Rhodey never had to worry their omegas were keeping other Alphas.
Steve hummed in agreement as she began attaching a few wires to his head.
Tony grumbled but let Steve lead him into the center of the room and slipped his arms around Steve's waist, automatically going to lead.  Steve looked a little flushed. He wasn't much of a drinker, but when he drank,
"Are you going to finally feed us?" Steve asked, cocking his head at the director again. The man laughed gently.
It was pretty typical of Tony to get distracted and flirty when they had somewhere to be in an hour.
"Okay," he said softly, a warm kind of smile breaking out onto his features as he turned around. Tony's arm felt strong as he curled it around Steve's waist and he was tucked back against the Alpha, their bodies slotting together surprisingly well. Steve reached down blindly and pulled the duvet up over their shoulders. He sighed contently and curled against Tony, happily pressing against him as his eyes drifted shut. Steve wasn't sure he'd ever felt so safe. So... at
"Steve," he murmured against the other's mouth.  Steve's voice was almost musical.  Like wind chimes.  Tony's body shuddered.  "Mine."
Hawley ignored him.  "Exceptions will be made for Canada and the United Kingdom."
Donner went silent.
Steve remembered seeing Bucky's car on the street and just
Yes.  Closer.  The voice was fading in, and Steve was suddenly aware of music playing faintly from an old record.
The instructions they gave him were always simple, straight-forward, and clear.
Tony."
and get no say on it. Did he actually enjoy it or was it just easier for him to pretend he did? How much did it screw with his self-esteem? Fred was 'cute,' but Shimmer was something else.
"...Steve," he said, smiling groggily.  He reached up to run a hand through his hair.  His hair was a mess, and jaw had a faint five o'clock shadow.  He yawned widely and reached up to scratch the scars around the arc reactor.  He glanced down at his hands; they were trembling a little.
"Yes but only because I was trying to get some work done, I'm very behind, why didn't you tell me about Wakanda--"
Donner had finally taken a very small sip of champagne; he began coughing.  Banksy patted him on the back. "S-sorry," said Donner. "I've n-never had-- had alcohol before."
"I have a taser, dumbass," said Natasha.  "...you okay, Sam?"
"We didn't mate," said Tony.  "I was in a suit of armor."
private."
"Did you know that the Greeks thought orchids looked like testicles?" asked Tony suddenly.  "...I was reading about them online. Orchids, I mean. Not Greeks or testicles. ...I'm just gonna shut up now."  He wriggled against Steve's leg, his hand exploring, stroking Steve's entrance, tracing the length of his shaft. "...you like me, right?  I mean, you think I'm a good person?" asked Tony suddenly. Maybe it was unfair of him to ask that while touching Steve, but he needed to hear it.
He tried to ignore Tony's emotions and focus on the weight on the arm around his waist.
"Thank you Happy," Steve said with genuine gratitude as he reached over to take an offered bottle.
"I'm Tony Stark... I'm here to rescue you," said Tony.  He turned to Steve. "You take room five and I'll take room three."
Fury glowered, because Sam had gotten it on the nose.
? I thought this was the twenty-first century, not the forties," Steve said. "Are you
"Okay.  I'll meet you in the bathroom," said Tony.  "...I assume you're coming with me," he added.
Pepper was hovering by a bank of television, eyeing them sternly.  "Tony!  ...Tony, are you-- are you watching this?"
It was unfamiliar, this feeling of caring.  Tony wasn't in the business of caring.  He'd liked Steve, liked the way he looked and talked and moved.  But it wasn't until Steve's heat that something had awakened in him.  Something pure and primal that made his whole life up until he'd mated Steve seem inconsequential and gaudy and pointless.  And now that they were mated, Tony couldn't think of any cause more noble or worthwhile than spending every waking moment with Steve, being there for him, as his guardian.  There was a vulnerability to this level of love that was exciting, like going to a nude beach or trying out an untested suit for the first time by flinging himself off a cliff.
