While Sherlock drew, Mrs Hudson passed through the living room with a basket full of bound weeds and an armful of thread. Walking to the castle’s door, she twisted the manual switch till the diamond above turned green-side down.
John felt his chest expand, barely realizing he’d been holding his breath, which he then released in a sigh of relief.
“Yes, I was in Monte Carlo.” He waited for Magnussen to comment on the implications of picking up a man in France, but they never came. Perhaps Magnussen assumed he’d fill in the blanks.
Except, that came to a halt when John reached around the outer corner of the tub only to find it empty. Sherlock’s head swiveled to the sink where John’s bottle of shower gel sat, having never made it to the shower.
John was angry—rather,
The bed frame had been parallel to the sidewall when they’d been in earlier.
“You don’t need to worry about anything,” John repeated. “And on your right you’ll see quite a lot of hydrangeas, my sister raves about them. I told you this place was drowning in flowers. Perhaps you can make a study of that?”
“You can’t even hear it, either,” Moriarty continued, walking slowly further into the room. “You wouldn’t even know the house was by the sea, from this wing.”
Something the bird folk knew, but didn’t care to dwell on, was that the peacock who used his feathers only for good deeds was rather lonely. The other birds might accept his help, but they didn’t like him for it. With his changing feathers, they never felt at ease around him. The duck had been pretending to be a peacock, but little did he know, the peacock was an impostor too.
John was looking anywhere but at him, and lifted the cover from a silver platter and began to cut into a piece of ham.
Before John could convince himself to act like a sane person, he pointed at the alien, and then at the scouter.
“I used to think about this,” Sherlock commented offhand, almost without intending to.
“The first wants to replace what was taken. The other has gone below.” The smile has never left her face. She returns her cup to its saucer to remove something from her pocket, which she holds out to him like an offering. It’s a bloody red dianthus.
He strode across the last stretch of lawn, well aware that he might have an audience if Moriarty and the person unknown were peering through the gap in the shutters. That was assuming they hadn’t fled the West wing after being seen.
“Suicide,” John said. Sherlock’s mind spun. The police officer closed the door.
Moriarty, for once, appeared confused, though mostly unimpressed. He wasn’t overly angered that his game hadn’t worked. Moriarty liked a challenge too well, and oh, he would give it to him.
Unknown to the doctor, he had a rapt audience, four men collectively holding their breath. The pause stretched out, as long as the drop from the opened trap door to the end of the rope.
(See the end of the chapter for
John stumbled after them, far less graceful in his hulking suit than Sherlock who glided down effortlessly.
On reflex John jerked open his bedside table drawer, rattling the gun inside. The knocking paused, before restarting again shortly after.
“Sir?” she asked.
Below, there was a river leading to the pond John had spotted, and next to it, a small stone cottage with a water wheel attached. “Is this what you wanted to show me?” John asked, when they came to a stop. “Is the cottage yours?”
“But, John, listen to me, you can’t keep bearing this burden alone. You’ve shut me out this whole time, perhaps to spare me from it,” he said, intense and focused. “I am begging you to share this with me. I've made up my mind to grow up, in twenty-four hours, if that’s what it takes. I'm not the child I was before that you needed to coddle, and I promise to you that I never will be again.”
Wilkes droned on regardless, “- and there’s his wife, isn’t she gorgeous? Mike’s wild about her, as I’m sure you can imagine. He didn’t know her back when he threw the party where I first met you, but I dare say you don’t remember me from then, do you?”
“And this is her wife, as you said, Clara,” John spoke, acting the part of polite host rather than meeting his inquisitive gaze. “As I was saying, I would have prepared you, except that Harry decided to surprise us.”
While Sherlock did seem like the sort to have moods, John didn’t know what that entailed, as Sherlock had been nothing but a gracious, if distracted, host the entire time they had been living under the same roof. John removed the muddy seven league boots from his feet, in the interests of not making Sherlock’s mood any worse.
“Get him changed!” she yelled at Lestrade, pulling John after her as they all watched John struggling to draw breath. He made to follow after them,
Sherlock dug the take-away menus out from beneath a container of frogmouth owl feathers and a pair of cow’s eyeballs, with the heavy weight of John’s eyes still on his back.
Archie held up a piece paper, cut to have five uneven pointed ends. “I made a star, and used the bellows from the fireplace for the wind, but it didn’t work.”
The floor creaks as John enters. At first the room seems entirely barren, until John can make out a rusty old bedframe to the left of the entrance. On the far side of the door he can also see floor length curtains that have seen better days, hanging where there may have once been a window. Nothing much else inside.
“What did you mind about my appearance then?”
Sherlock had expected John to find that a bit funny, but his hands stilled where they had been wringing the washcloth. “I have a feeling I know what it’s about, actually,” John said slowly, almost hesitant. Sherlock craned his neck to face him. John’s expression was regretful, and apologetic.
“Yes John, I know what you meant,” Sherlock snapped. They turned back to the projection, with their back facing John. “You meant because I can grow limbs. Ha ha, John.”
Luckier still that John had been a healer, and that not a week after his arrival he happened upon a local clinic advertising an open position in its window. John was put to work, though his hands shook too much for him to be of much use beyond treating acute ailments, and he imagined he’d only been given the job because the other healers had taken a liking to him.
Maybe because it was all so unreal. Or, maybe because it was real—the situation too similar to two friends having a chat in front of the fire, leaning in, as if they’d known each other their whole lives. In the end, there was simply a limit to a stiff upper lip.
John knew what the shepherd saw—his cane and diminished frame—but he could not be persuaded.
This was not the first time John had received this directive, nor did he expect that it would be the last. BAK 2212 required more bot repairs than any other planet monitored by their exploration company. While John’s last few visits had been relatively painless, John knew that if the Hudson had been dispatched, this trip would not be a quick job. John wasn’t particularly thrilled about the prospect, and neither would Greg be, when he heard.
He grasped at John’s shoulders frantically, and John eventually drew away, allowing himself to be pulled back up till they were lying face to face. Without prompting, John wrapped his left hand back around Sherlock’s cock, now wet from John’s mouth, and began to pump. He could feel John’s wedding ring, warmed by the friction, pressing against his skin on every downstroke. Sherlock moaned helplessly, as John leaned forward to kiss it from him.
Sherlock for the second time bounded up the stairs, taking John to a small landing, with one door at the end, and one door to the left. Sherlock opened the door at the end, and ushered John into the dark room within.
“That should do it!” Sherlock said. As the magic in the air receded, his hair returned to its usual place, deeply parted with his fringe across his forehead. “Now, Mrs Hudson has an entire floor to herself, and I’ve even added a guest room!”
“But I’d be happy to try to do more,” John offered, an idea occurring to him.
“It’s not difficult,” he insisted, placing his hand over top of John’s. “It’s much easier than wherever I thought I would be. I have infinitely more freedom here than I would have elsewhere. I’m out from under my brother’s thumb. And I won’t lie to you, I used to think it would be dreadful to be married. I’d never even considered it. Frankly, you’re nothing like what I imagined a spouse would be.”
“But I suppose you’re right sir, I’d better get dinner sorted,” Moriarty said crisply, with exaggerated politeness, before finally leaving the room.
John had recovered in some ways, and was himself again. They lived their lives together as the best of companions, sleeping, eating, walking, driving to the village, working each day in the same room. But he felt all the same there was an unspoken barrier between them because of it. John walked alone in the world, fighting against some unseen enemy. And he himself was on the other side, despite desperately wanting to assist John. All he knew for certain was it was related to Mary.
I managed to get this out in a week, let's see if I can keep it up <3
“Mycroft,” the Queen greeted. John, still bowed, was only able to see the hem of her green dress as she passed. “And who is this?”
“Was that what you were actually trying to ask me earlier?” John asked, still propped up over Sherlock’s lap. “Because you could have just - you know - said that.”
“Redbeard.”
Lestrade cleared his throat. “I don't know sir. It can get windy out there.”
He was returning to the West corridor, where he had not been in quite some time. Not since he’d had that odd run-in with Moriarty, which he hadn’t really wished to repeat.
He considered it, but ultimately dismissed the idea.
“Know what?” Sherlock asked, lower lip jutting out in a pout.
“Good boy,” he said, breaking the silence, and feeling the dog deserved it.
“Not quite,” Sherlock smiled, “but a good guess.”
“At least we can sit together on the drive up in the car,” John said with forced brightness.
John had never thought of his face as distinct, but that was rather besides the point. John felt Sherlock watching him with close interest as he processed their frankly unbelievable situation.
“You were there weren’t you?” David asked, pressing in. “You peered in at the window, and you saw John Watson with Mary. You saw him.”
she would have, I just know - she shot me. When I saw the gun, I moved to get out of the cottage, but she still got me in the shoulder. And then I - stupidly - shot back. The only difference being, my shot didn’t miss.”
“Mm, John, necking in a client’s house in their daughter’s bedroom,” Sherlock murmurs, re-gripping John’s upper arms tightly, “Excuse me, a client’s haunted house –“
“I don’t know,” John said. “Though, I won’t be shedding any tears if he didn’t.”
Once they stepped through the door, Mrs Hudson was on her feet. “John! Oh, I’m so glad you made it back all right. We had to let loose the storefronts in Kingsbury, and Porthaven too.”
Throughout the day, other customers arrived at the Kingsbury and Porthaven doors, where Sherlock was known as the Wizard Sigerson and Wizard Vernet respectively. The transaction process was brief, as Sherlock always knew what a customer wanted before they even spoke. The woman with wet shoes from Porthaven wanted a spell for her ship’s sails to catch the wind, the runtish boy from Kingsbury wanted a wart curse for a bully at school, and the old woman with weathered hands wanted powders to help her garden grow. The details about each customer that tipped Sherlock off were all rattled off without more than a single glance, and John would conclude the interaction by providing the spell for them.
“Mr Watson, do you have any objections to this diary being reviewed?” Colonel Barclay asked.
He hoped John wouldn’t come.
Sherlock held the scalpel in hand, hoping the boiling had appropriately disinfected the metal. “Did you bring yourself something for the pain?” Sherlock asked, already unfortunately knowing the answer. John licked the corner of his lip rather than answering.
“Yes, I’m quite sure.”
– invading his personal space, perspiring,
“Did you get your wires crossed and mean to say idiot?” John asked, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth while his lined face scrunched in confusion.
He looked up through the curls hanging over his face, startled by John’s tone. Now he blinked, and ducked his head again. He wanted to believe that, he really did. But that wasn’t quite right - of course Manderley was about John, an extension of himself. To be right for John, he had to be right for both.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, still aggressively twisting his hand. “Ten times now, and under two separate identities. You’d think they might get the hint.”
Sherlock blinked, the pace of the blinks slowed by his wet lashes. John had only briefly summarized his conversation with Mary in the boat house. Sherlock should have known there was much more to it than discussing her affairs. A pregnancy. No matter how hard he tried, resisted, he couldn’t stop the thought from creeping in, that it might have been, could have been -
“You mean, come with you to work as a secretary? Someone to do administrative tasks for you?” he asked, putting effort into speaking so as to hide that he felt like he was gasping for air, his chest tight and hot. He felt as if he might be set ablaze at any moment.
He was speechless. His face was turned down in shame, his fingers frozen on the edge of their ruined map. He thought if he tried to speak, he might cry.
“O-oh, all right. And what does he look like then, your deaf man?” the voice cooed at him.
“I gather from the context it’s how plants on your home planet generate energy.” After trailing one of their long fingers further down the page, Sherlock added, “The process is indeed similar, though I was living on very little fluid and mostly starlight. That was still rather astute of you to guess, John.”
Maybe it wasn’t in general Sherlock’s “area”, but there had been The Woman. And Janine was attractive.
John had offered him the seat intended for himself, partly out of politeness, but largely to increase the distance between himself and Wilkes. It did not escape his notice that Wilkes must have asked the young man to go all the way to his room to retrieve the letter after recognizing John in the dining room. John was familiar with Wilkes’ elbow-rubbing breed, which was in fact his reason for traveling outside of England, and was resigned to the inevitable unpleasantness of the conversation.
He had the distinct impression he wasn’t going to like this person.
John’s hands began to make their way from his chest back to where they had rested before, and Sherlock drew in a short breath in anticipation. “Did I do this next?” John whispered, the tips of John’s fingers skating across his abdomen, lower, and lower. “Yes,” Sherlock gasped. “Yes.”
He felt less…. uneasy with the daylight in the room. The closed windows and electric light had made the perfectly laid out room appear like the backdrop of a play. As if he was on stage in between scenes, behind the curtains. He was a spectator here, not a player. He had walked into someone else’s spotlight. Being caught in a woman’s room had never been much of a concern for him, but now he felt as though he was truly somewhere he should not have been.
‘There is a crowd.”
John’s eyes flick upward to gauge Sherlock’s reaction, but his pale face is unreadable. Instead he is intently focused on the task at hand. there is a rip of paper and the stench of iodine fills his nostrils as Sherlock cleans the wound.
John stood and made his way over to him just as slowly as before, only this time, Sherlock didn’t turn him away as he got close, instead the taller man allowed John to wrap his arms around him. And Sherlock leaned into him, his body still tense and solid but John could feel trembling in Sherock’s body as the tears began to fall. The tension in his body remained as John held him, the sun slowly rising over the horizon
He had hoped that Greg had brought his car, instead of walked, he had no idea which method his friend was using to find him however. He didn't hear a car start, hell he didn't even hear Greg leave the bar.
Mycroft pushed himself away from the counter, closing the distance between himself and his little brother, careful as not to crowd him. His hand coming up to cup the side of his brother’s face. Sherlock looked so much younger than he actually was in that instance.
He looks at Sherlock and wonders if it’s a matter of who he can’t live without or who is the smart choice.
“Are you certain?”
“I’m sorry,” John says again. He’s backed well out of Sherlock’s reach, almost out of the kitchen. “I shouldn’t’ve done that.”
She kicks him out after he fails to answer the last question. He can’t picture himself just being a husband to this woman anymore. He can’t picture coming home to her every night after a long day at the surgery. And he loves her, he wants to love her just like he used to, but he doesn’t think he can anymore. Everything he’s wanted for them has gone up in flames because of Sherlock and he has no idea how much that scares him.
It was quiet, for a beat while John tried to compose himself and Sherlock absorbed facts hurled at him. “Tell me how.” Sherlock finally says.
Unsure how to proceed, he held his hand out to greet the approaching figure in an attempt at displaying dignity and composure. The other man took his hand and smiled – though his face was benign, his hand was deathly cold, and it lay limp in his own hand like a dead thing.
(See the end of the chapter for
Somewhat alarmed by John approaching him with a broom in hand, Sherlock fluttered away from the lamp. Whenever Sherlock was in motion, John ducked low into a crouch. However, his broom was very much at the ready. Sherlock steered his flight as high as possible to avoid getting whomped.
Sherlock had wanted to take his leave immediately, as he done during the first incident, but the window hadn’t been open enough for him to fly directly through. It had required wiggling to fit through the first time. Even in this form, Sherlock had too much dignity to
were - as if I hadn’t already bloody married you!” John laughed, mildly angry, but mostly disbelieving. “I knew he didn’t approve, I knew it -”
“The chance isn’t gone, John,” he insisted, willing himself to return to the moment, to be present, to
“Hmm,” he said. “That’s a terrible name.”
“John, can’t you see there’s more going on,” Sherlock insisted, while desperately trying to determine what exactly that was. “Why would Mary have gone to see a doctor for a pregnancy test, and then refuse the follow up when the rabbit died? And then, why would she leave a note at David’s saying she had to tell him something, only to go home to Manderley to shoot at you?”
Watson’s driving at this point might have been described as reckless, given that he had to swerve the car to avoid hitting a dog in the road.
“Yes, you’ve surprised us all,” John said. He could now tell when John found something ridiculous and was moments away from laughing. This was absolutely one of those times.
“No—no!” Sherlock protested, leaning forward as John drew back. “Never wanted it, with someone.” Sherlock turned away, a hand covering his still reddened from kissing mouth. He looked frustrated, embarrassed even. “Fantasies were… easier.”
In response, Sherlock stole a kiss from his lips, and slid one of their many hands down his front. “For starters,” Sherlock murmured, “you haven’t even taken the coveralls off yet.”
At some point, John’s hand had lifted to cover his mouth. His face felt warm from a varied series of facial expressions, and now from smiling. Whoever had written this, no matter how practical they perhaps thought themselves, had obviously included their own personal preferences throughout. John attempted to imagine this
“Tell me,” John said, hands slowing in their ascension up Sherlock’s leg. “Why did you really read those Captain Watson comic books?”
While there were already obvious signs of falling debris, John didn’t have time to waste on looking up to assess the danger of anything else giving way overhead. John moved fast, and trusting his instinct without question, climbed the stairs and headed for the West wing.
“Uh. Is it different?” John asked.
If he turned over to the other side of the bed, the sheets still smelt of him. Indescribable, but entirely John. He breathed in, and then reached for the handle of his bedside drawer. He was hard, he already missed John, and he wanted to make the most of it.
“I never know what you wizards are on about,” John said, though he did recall that particular rumour from Market Chipping. “How do you draw power from a demon?”
Thank you, Sherlock says, dipping his chin down to his bare chest. The list is as follows:
He was consulting a psychic, God help him.
He felt warm. Presumably from the jacket, and from being pressed up against another person. He nodded against the other man’s shoulder.
They eyed each other, before the Colonel finally left with a murmured, “See you on the morrow.”
John’s hands rushed to sign,
John’s fingers twitched, just as the man lifted his wrists. They both stopped, and then urged the other to continue. John laughed once, quick, when they couldn’t decide who should start. The man smiled in return.
“And you think I’m right for it?” he asked, daring John to say to his face what they both knew was highly debatable.
It was interesting that Moriarty would choose the only day John was away from home to show a guest the old, closed off wing. Interesting was one word for it, anyway.
Sherlock’s glowing gold freckles returned at this comment, bizarrely, and Sherlock looked away. “I was—curious about them, that’s all.”
This was his doing - it was him who had decided to go to the other beach, her beach. He’d inadvertently brought this on them by opening John’s memory to the past. The exact opposite of what he intended.
“And you started reading the novels when you were young?” Sherlock continued, looking anywhere but at John. “And um... you kept up, all these years?”
John needed to be patient, as he was still attempting to push through the cotton padding the inside of his skull. Slowly, as he moved aside each piece, the short time he’d spent in Monte Carlo in the other man’s presence played out in revealing segments. Desiring John’s praise, attention, his company. Wanting John to look at him and laugh with him. The distress he felt at John thinking ill of him. His dreams about John, a John who either forgot him or adored him. One he feared, and the other he desired. Not to mention, the nature of the dream he’d had the previous night… It all painted a very telling picture.
He turns the page to find another, and another. The entire book it seems is filled with them.
The alien made a new sound, not unlike a purr, and the gold flecks returned, shining bright across their skin. John wasn’t sure what to make of any of it, and so merely motioned for the alien to follow after him past the boarding area.
John contemplated asking if Sherlock came there often, before he was saved by the food arriving. Starving, John tucked in, while Sherlock began a painstaking arrangement with his food. With a single chopstick, Sherlock pushed each individual dumpling away from the stir fry noodles till none were touching.
“How can you be sure?” she asked, pausing to cough. “They say that the Wizard Holmes wants the heart of every young girl in town.”
—if you couldn’t speak English a moment ago?” Not to mention a male name, though John knew that didn’t necessarily mean anything either.
“Take this curse off me,” John said from the carpet.
“Hey, hey,” John said, concern etched in his brow, “you know we don’t have to do this, right? And I mean, never, if you’d prefer. I’m more than happy with what we’ve been -”
> Hi, hello.
John wakes to ten fingers on his face in a position that cannot possibly be comfortable, the joints extending the way only a concert pianist or long time violinist could hold for so long. The fingers aren’t still, though, not exactly. They’re drifting over all the lines, and beneath his eyes, bags, all places that must show his age. Sherlock’s face is screwed up in frustration. It’s as if he’s reading John’s mind, but badly. As if John is a particularly hard nut to crack. John resists calling him Spock again.
“You’ve never - done that. Before. Described me like that,” Sherlock said in a low, almost hopeful voice.
Maybe there was an actual reason (beyond seeing the kitchen) that John’s armchair had been moved from the living room. With his chair in Sherlock’s bedroom, maybe they’d done quite a bit of. Well. Lap sitting.
That’s how he ends up several hours later drowning his sorrows in a mug of pitch black coffee. He would have gone to a pub, but he remembers his therapist telling him alcohol and despair shouldn’t go, no matter how they longed to be together. He couldn’t go to Mary’s because she was still waiting for an answer he couldn’t give her yet. He couldn’t go to Sherlock’s because the man would still be asking about his suicide attempt.
John breaks the silence first, “I choose you, Sherlock,” it came out as a whisper. “I always have.”
“Shut up!” Sherlock snaps. He hands tighten on John’s face and he moves closer, forcing himself in-between John’s legs. They’re level and John was sure if he looked dead center he’d see the blue of Sherlock’s eyes.
He especially doesn’t know what he’d do if he saw both.
Sherlock’s head presses harder into John’s, “I know,” he says at the same volume.
*****************************
John does, he turns his head and looks at Sherlock. He always looks at Sherlock, he never stops looking at him.
And John can only nod, he does.
Before he can get anywhere else, John blurts out.
John heaves out a great sigh, “Mary,” he starts, but she bulldozes over him, fueled by her anger.
John’s looking up, down, right, left, anywhere but Sherlock, “This ridiculous, let go me, Sherlock. I have to—”
As he looks up, John looks away and he can tell instantly that Sherlock is looking directly at him. Trying to make the eye contact is so inexplicably afraid of. “GPS on your phone,” he answers nonchalantly, pocketing his phone.
Sherlock’s large hands tightened on knees, squeezing them until it almost hurt. “I know.” His head suddenly dropped and he leaned forward. Forcing John’s legs apart as he sagged between them. “I was— I got a text from Molly about a body,” he murmured as he rested on the side of the dresser to John’s left. “I thought I’d be back before…”.
John considers, in hindsight, this is worst thing he could have done. He had not been in Sherlocks’ room since the fall. The room was impeccable, neat, not a single item out of place. Cold. Sherlock’s room was cold like it had been in those days so long ago. And for reasons he couldn’t explain something in him broke, he couldn’t find Sherlock, he was gone again, he’d left John again. John slid down the wall, his back against Sherlocks dresser knees bent up to his chest and his breath coming out in hot wet spurts. John, of course, can recognize a panic attack from his many sessions of therapy, but for the life of him can’t seem to do anything about it. His head is spinning and he breath is coming in ragged, he’s sweating and he’s on the verge of tears and Sherlock’s gone!
It’s a whole disappearing train debacle and John is angry with Sherlock more times than he’s not. Sherlock does his thing and saves the day. With his turned up collar and his mouth twitched up in that smirk of his, John can’t help the feeling of warmth that spreads throughout him. In this moment, as he’s telling Lestrade how incompetent he is and how it really wasn’t all that difficult, was the most relaxed and unguarded that he’s seen him. Sherlock was always somewhat tense around John in the rare instances they’ve met since he’s been back. And John does suppose that has to do with guilt of leaving him behind. But, right now they’re Sherlock and John, so John doesn’t stop the smile from creeping to his face.
“Who are you trying to convince John? Me or yourself?”
“I know,” John says running his hands down his face. “I know.”
And John’s not sure about what it is that Sherlock just gets about him, but it suddenly clicks for him. “Oh.” Sherlock’s mouth forms the perfect little circle.
“Except I didn’t kill myself, John!” Sherlock barks accusingly. And John sees red.
“I want to tell you something,” a look of frustration passes across his face and John can’t help but think he looks adorable. “However, even with my vast vocabulary, I cannot seem to find the right word.”
I do not own Sherlock or anything associated with it besides the ideas in the fic
John wanted so very badly to disagree. He loved Mary, he did. She was there for him when everything went to hell. She made him want to start truly living again, she was one of the reasons John was still here today. For a while she was his whole world, it only seemed fair to repay the kindness.
“Injuring myself—shot? I was protecting a
But, really, it’s not weird to John and probably not to Sherlock either. It’s reaffirmation, a reassurance, a safe guard against the against the anxiety that attacks both of them at the least opportune moments. Like when they’re chasing down a criminal and John doesn’t think before splitting off from Sherlock and to be fair John
John goes back home with Sherlock, not bothering to tell Mary about the change in plans. He and Sherlock walk into 221B with rings of ‘hello!’ and ‘oh John your back!” from Mrs. Hudson. They answer back and Sherlock waves away her offering of tea as they trudge up the stairs.
As for physically being together, Sherlock had no qualms and was in fact eager; which John will admit, mildly surprised him. The thought of Sherlock being with anyone that way was completely foreign to John.  When John brings this up Sherlock shakes his head claiming he’d never had sex before, never even had a reason to try until now. And John thinks he’s lucky, having something from Sherlock that will always be his and no one else’s.
I do not own Sherlock or anything affiliated with it besides the ideas in the fanfic.
John tells Sherlock how he went to therapy for a couple months after and how he moved all of his things out of the flat. He tells Sherlock how he found a tiny flat and how much that small space reminded him of the days before he ever met him. He tells him how his days had a set routine: visit Mrs. Hudson, go to work, eat lunch in his office, have a round with Lestrade, go home and go to sleep, then do the same thing again the next day. His only break in that routine was his three times a week therapy sessions or when the surgery was understaffed and they needed him to come in.
“It doesn’t make sense,” Sherlock said, leading John off the stoop and away from the door. “Meaning there’s something missing, more to the story.”
“No to the first, and yes to the second.”
> I see you’re online. Should I be waiting for my daily question?
“Maybe nothing. Maybe everything,” Sherlock replied, under his breath. “John, what if Mary shot you because she knew she was going to die?”
Sherlock, sitting in his leather armchair across, did look up at that. “Well, she got her revenge, didn’t she?” A moment later, under his breath and horribly mumbled, Sherlock added, “But not that other thing though.”
For the second time, it was only the sound of his name, strung out and high in John’s voice, that brought him back to the moment. This was far more than enough—he was strong now, far more than he’d ever been on a bag, the donor lending his personal fortitude to Sherlock. And still Sherlock lapped, and licked, and mouthed. He knew his saliva could heal the wound till there would be no tangible reminder for John, the incident nothing but a brief moment of pain, followed by his friend making a fool of himself.
“Do you already know... how I knew about the case?” John asked, tentative, shifting even further forward in the chair.
Sherlock inclined his head. “Mr Stamford, if you’d be so kind as to go over the details for Captain Watson.”
“He’s spoiled Watson, that’s his trouble. Anyone else would give their eyes for the chance to see Monte.”
John had gradually learned to become less restrained when with him, so to speak. They still of course had gentle times, and soft words, but there was a time and a place for a bit of roughness between the sheets, which Sherlock encouraged with increasing frequency.
You should be the kettle.
“Why indeed?” the Wizard replied with a single raised brow, which reminded John very much of someone else.
“What?” Sherlock asked, fear creeping into him from the edges where he had pushed it away. “What did I get wrong?”
The only downside of this being that Sherlock was assisted from the courtroom, and taken to a small waiting room at the station. He would now not have any idea what was happening, and instead of living through the twists he would have to wait for the end of it. Sherlock then regretted his choice of action bitterly. What if, even after his great effort to distract him, John was still asked the question, and lied terribly? What if now John was being cross examined and making himself out to be the murderer? Who else would anyone suspect, given the circumstances?
Really, John. You don’t even know what type of bird?
Mycroft leans forward and places his hand on Sherlock's bruised on. Silently vowing he will get whoever did this to his brother. He will make them pay.
“S-stop..please.” Sherlock managed to find his voice but it came out nothing more than a whisper, and much to his horror John didn’t.
“You’re safe Sherlock, it’s just me.” John stated, and Sherlock slowly entered, he looked tired and worn, his face was slightly more pale than usual, but for the most part he looked as well as could be expected.
Sherlock knows he has to fight back, he has to at least get away, to prevent Moran from violating him in his own safe space.
He could feel his heart beating against his ribs as the floor lights lit up as he passed.
“I’m sorry.” John replied as he made a particularly hard thrust, causing Sherlock to cry out, tears forming in his pale eyes from the pain, he couldn’t figure out how to get his body to move with him as a sob bubbled in his chest, nothing seemed to want to work like it should. tears poured down his face as John’s movements were harder, rapid and erratic as he grew close to his climax.
“Sherlock?”
"Mycroft Holmes." he answered half asleep as he tied to wake himself up, though that didn’t take long as a voice he didn’t expect to hear come through the line.
“Why can’t I delete it?” he asked finally, god he wanted to know why he couldn’t get rid of the memory as much as he tried.
"I know things haven't been the same since...since a we were taken, but I think we need to fix that." he breathes
“Do you honestly think that would be a good idea John?”
Silence follows as Sherlock slowly unfurls himself enough so that he may sit up just enough for John to slip under him and Sherlock falters slightly as he decides if he should sit up completely or lay down once again.
Thank you everyone for your kind comments on this story. I am sorry it took so long to update and I hope to begin to update regularly.
“No.” John replied firmly as he tightened his grip on the door knocker, pulling it firmer against the jamb, fearing that it just might be ripped from the door.
"Sherlock. Sherlock. You're alright." Mycroft's voice was urgent even in the soothing tone it had taken on. "You're safe, Sherlock. Safe."
“I believed him.” He continued still not looking up. “I believed what he said because how could anyone look for me? I ruined people’s lives, I made them hate me, I gave them more than their fair share of worry so why should anyone look for me when they got the peace they deserved.”
"Its his case file."
He took a deep breath as the doorbell downstairs rang, though he waited a moment to step back from John to right his suit one more time.
The doctor nodded. “She was, apparently this was a rather elaborate plan, but you knew that already.” The blonde stated as he cast a glance towards Sherlock, he would know the sort of set up they would have, Moran would have no doubly rubbed it into his friends face. “But Though I take it she was the last of them, Mycroft and his people where already looking for her.”
He moved methodically as he grabbed clean clothes before walking into the bathroom attached to his room. It wasn't used as much as the one down stairs near Sherlock's bedroom. He preferred that one most days because of the deep tub was perfect for a bath and was big enough that he could stretch out and sink down into the water. But today, that was the last thing he wanted, using that bath meant going down stairs to face Sherlock, and he couldn't do that yet.
The hospital room is silent as Mycroft leans into the chair and closes his eyes. He’s been staring on and off at his mobile since he called Anthea hours before, hoping to find a message or an incoming call, only to find nothing. He knew he was being impatient but this had gone on too long and Sherlock had suffered too much without him knowing and he was determined to do something about it now.
The government official makes his way down the stairs first, the detective following behind by a step, both are quiet and Mycroft can feel the tension slowly fill the air as the get closer to the street door, but he doesn’t voice anything, leaving his up to his brother because this is his healing process and he won’t intervene with what Sherlock thinks he can take.
“He looked like him.” Sherlock breathed “He looked like him… and I know it can’t be him because he’s dead…he’s dead My. I know he is because you killed him.” The detective’s voice was strained as he spoke, as if he wanted to cry. The government official leaned forward slightly, his hands coming up to grasp his brother’s face gently.
Mycroft shifts himself forward and rests his hands atop the table.
There is a large stain in the middle of the room and the next photo shows the dark pool of blood that outlines the V shape left by Sherlock's legs
Disgust began to fill Sherlock at the response Moran’s touch was having on his body, and while he knew it was just a physiological response to stimulation, he couldn’t help but feel betrayed at the way he moaned and by the unwelcome feeling that was pooling in the bottom of his stomach. Sherlock still refused to open his eyes as the weight was put back on his legs as Moran sat up. The blonde was delighted with himself as he looked down at his toy, the prize that his boss was allowing him to play with, and while it may not have been part of the original plan, things had certainly been changeable... Sebastian looked down at Sherlock, his lips parted. His milky white skin glistening by the sweat. His arms outstretched over his head, bound by the rope. His entire body completely vulnerable and under the mercy of Moran's bigger, stronger body above him. He looked obscene. He couldn’t help but wonder how good it would feel once he had his cock buried inside the body below him. The thought made his cock throb and begin to strain the fabric of his jeans. God he wanted to fuck him senseless, Fuck him hard until his arse would ache for days, until his legs turns to jelly and he wouldn't be able to walk. Until his entire body would be bruised. Until the pain and humiliation will stay with him for days and months and years to come. Until all he could do is beg and cry. Until all his tears would run dry. And all his fight and all his energy had been drained out of him.
“Turn around and brace yourself against the counter, Captain.” Sherlock orders and John complies. Sherlock sticks his hands into the pockets of the pajama bottoms and feels around for the small bottle that is most likely going to be there. With a pleased sound, he withdrawals the bottle of lube from one of the pockets and places it on the counter for later use.
The kiss started off chaste and slowly grew more heated as Sherlock traces John’s bottom lip with his tongue silently asking for access, which John grants. They stand there for what seems like hours, but can be no more than a few minutes, kissing passionately, muffled moans filling the air along with the occasional clank of teeth.
It didn’t take long before the brunette was pressing a hot trail of kisses down his neck, his fingers undoing the tie of his dressing gown, slowly pulling it down his shoulder, leaving a trail of kisses as he went.
He sits quietly for a while, his laptop forgotten on his lap as he notices the little movements Sherlock makes, the tells that give him away from the dressing gown that is pulled tight around his frame to the wiggling that makes it seem he is unable to get comfortable.
“Don’t you have something else to do? Like your jobs?” Greg asked, pulling Sherlock forward as they continued to walk, the older man not stopping to see if they had actually done what he had suggested.
“You don’t need their crap, you don’t have to deal with them or have to put up with them lurking around here, You need time to finish healing Sherlock and I don’t think London is the place to do it.”
Now Sherlock was wearing a hole in the carpet, his eyes going from the door to the clock on the wall to the watch on his wrist as he fiddled with his suit jacket (pulling it down, buttoning and unbuttoning it as he moved, playing with his cuffs.) There was a thin line of perspiration that had formed along his brow and hairline, giving away the fact he was most definitely a bit not good.
Greg held out the file for Mycroft to take.
"He's- well, He's alive and given his injures I say it is better than expected." there was a grim note tl Mycroft's voice as he spoke. "Whomever did this didn't want or expect him to survive."
Sherlock had been bored, he had been searching for a case, he had been willing to take anything that was given to him, so needless to say as the email came in saying there had been a theft of an expensive painting from a locked vault, Sherlock jumped at it. Half an hour after the email came in they were sitting in the back of a cab, heading to the address that had been given.
“I am trying to prep you for the less amount of internal damage.” John hissed. “I doubt you want to go to the hospital from here and explain that your best friend ra-”
“When did you start taking cases again?” John asked and he turned around to face the doctor, his brow furrowed.
Sherlock sighed and drummed his fingers on his violin for a moment before standing “Now all there is is for me to clean up the mess with the media.” Disappointment and anxiety colored his voice as he set his instrument on its stand, his back to Mycroft. “I supposed it was going to happen sometime.”
Sherlock could hear Greg huff as he turned to make his way towards the tape, ducking under it to make his way towards the body lying in the middle of the alleyway. There was no keeping his head down this time as stopped and leaned over the body, taking in the man’s appearance and gave an annoyed huff when he didn’t notice anything immediately.
Even before his door was shut completely, Greg was speeding down the street to the hospital
He sighed as he ended the call and leaned back in the chair. His eyes roaming over Sherlock as he slept. He didn't want to ask his younger brother about the man, not yet anyway. He didn't want to pressure him into talking about something he wasn't ready to. However, Sherlock and what he knew was the only lead Mycroft knew they had.
From what Sherlock can see, his wrists are the worst. Rubbed raw by the rope and bruised from being so tightly restrained.
“You didn’t have to do this.” Sherlock stated breaking the silence that filled the car as they drove, his voice was quiet, subdued as he spoke, as if he thought he was being a bother to the silver haired man behind the steering wheel.
"Perhaps you would know if you didn't go out. even more so, we might not be sitting here."
“Really Sherlock? I just got up.”
There were plenty of people on the street, but no one said much or anything to them as they made their way back to the flat, Sherlock’s hand in his brother’s as he tried to keep his head down. They were nearly home when someone knocked his shoulder and Sherlock looked up. His heart stopping as he got a quick glance of the man that had hit his shoulder. The grip on Mycroft’s hand tightened as he felt the bile begin to rise in his throat.
Mycroft’s attention was focused on John as his hand clenched, a handful of emotions crossed the doctor’s face in a heart beat before his nostrils flared and a smile tugged at the edges of his lips.
“O-of course, John. The room is always yours.”
The ride home was quiet, John sat in the back of Greg's car by himself, while Sherlock sat in the passenger seat by Greg. It had been the silver man's orders, ones that Sherlock wasn't too happy about, but Sherlock didn't argue when John had mumbled a soft please. Now he sat moodily next to Greg as he glared out the side window.
“No, I just told him to leave instead. It was easier than finding out later on I was just a bother to him.”
"Thank you, Gregory."
“I don’t always listen to what he says.” The doctor replied as he shifted his weight. “I wanted to ask you something before I confront her.”
John made his way up the stairs, making the usual noise as he went, but he knew that Sherlock could tell from what step he had been on he had been listening. He wasn’t going to be angry about this thought, there had to be a good reason Sherlock thought he was a bother, and wanted to hear it.
ring.
"Its alright John, I'll find you. I promise."  there was a sincere tone to Greg's voice and John had no choice but to believe him.
It was unusual for John to be awake before Sherlock, but as the Army doctor made his way down the stairs, it was nice to see that the taller man was still in bed, asleep. He knew that the nightmares woke the detective up most nights and that he was usually too afraid to fall asleep afterwards that he would stay up until he needed to sleep. It was no secret between them that Sherlock wasn’t able to keep the same hours he used to, not as his body healed. Of course most of the injuries on the outside had closed and begun to fade, but it could take up to six months or more for the internal damage to be healed completely. So in essence sleep was essential for him to heal faster, sleep was what he needed, because even if he wouldn’t admit it, John knew Sherlock was only human.
Sherlock’s shoulders sagged as the tension in his body melted away and he shut his eyes as he allowed the cool London air to brush against his warm skin and fill his lungs as he took a deep breath.
Sherlock grabbed the paper work that Sat on the bed next to John while John pushed himself off the bed and eased himself into the wheelchair. Sherlock noticed the wince as John Sat but sat nothing.
The doctor sighed and closed his eyes before turning his head so he could stare at his mobile, longing to reach out and grab it and send a text or twenty to Sherlock to make sure he was alright, thought any movement would stir the woman who was curled up rather close to him, and the last thing he wanted was to argue with her over the fact he was awake and corresponding with the person that saved him first. So instead John elected to lay awake and stare off into the darkness, watching the shadows dance across the walls as he waited for the alarm to go off so he could get up and go to work.
They had been passing by a magazine stand when his eyes fell upon it, his name and face plastered everywhere with one of the worst photos he had ever seen, it was him, but it wasn’t him, well not really the him he wanted to remember. It was from the hospital, the quality was poor, and the lighting was bad but he could make himself out laying on the bed in the shadows. His heart stopped, it plummeted into his stomach, he felt sick and nauseous and before he knew it he was rushing back to the flat as fast as he could.
“Is it still possible to see him?” John questioned
Sherlock watches him out of the corner of his eye as he pretends to be indifferent to his flatmates actions
Mycroft closed his eyes as he shut the chart and placed it back on the clipboard on the edge of Sherlock's bed.
John glanced towards the hall that lead to Sherlock’s bedroom every so often hoping to see the detective emerge from his room, even though he knew he wouldn’t. Mary lingered around the kitchen door waiting for him rather impatiently if he thought about it, but he had little to no desire to actually go with her.
“We will see Director, have a good day.” He hung up the phone before leaning forward, his hands resting in his hands, taking a deep breath. There was so much to do now: Look for the disgusting human being who had done this, repair the damage it had done, ensure that Sherlock was safe and well, the last thing on the list topping everything else.
John Gets hurt on a case and Sherlock takes care of him
graphic depictions of rape
It was well after sunrise before Mycroft gently slid the pillow and Sherlock’s head from his lap, pausing for a moment to make sure he had not wakened him before slowly standing. His legs were stiff and sore as he began to move, but he had expected that much for being stuck in that position for so long, but as long as that helped his brother sleep, then that was all that mattered. He stretched his limbs slightly as he made his way into the sitting room, digging through his coat pocket for his mobile before calling Anthea. It was well past the time he should have been at his office, but right now Sherlock just came first. He simply stated that he was not going to be in and that he would be doing his work from home, to which she just agreed before hanging up. Though she did sound mildly surprised at the fact he wouldn’t be in, it wasn’t like him to take a day off, and even when he was younger and Sherlock went missing, vanishing into the alleyways of London looking for a fix.
Sherlock turned into the room, squeezing in past the nurse who was still in the door to get to John.
There had been a small sigh of relief when Sherlock became associated with Scotland yard and the premises of working for them if he stayed clean, the crimes were like puzzles and something that could give him the same effect as cocaine, and Mycroft was all for it as long as he stayed out of trouble for the most part.
“That’s what John’s Fiancée said. That is why I didn’t call him to come back, he can’t put things on hold because of me. Had he said anything I would have made sure to stop being such a bother, Greg could have stayed instead. I don’t think he would mind it.”
He refuses to look at himself in the mirror as he peels of his coat and suit jacket, tossing them on the chair by the shower. His tailored shirt is ruined, bit he doesn't care as he unbuttons the few fastenings left and tosses on the floor. The detective falters as he undoes his trousers and it takes him a moment to shove them down to the ground. His heart pounds as he slips his thumbs under the waist band of his pants and tries to slip out of them, wincing as he has to literally peel them from his skin
John, and as instantly as John had wanted them, was tipping their kissing over into open, desperate presses of mouth to mouth. Sherlock received and responded to each kiss with nothing less than enthusiasm, and each time John licked past the seam of Sherlock’s lips, he was distantly aware of Sherlock’s gills fluttering against their neck as they drew in gasping breaths.
I should cut it, John says, and Sherlock just runs his fingers through it again.
John had been about to say ‘when I was first married’. Mary’s ornament then. Likely a wedding gift. No wonder Moriarty was hyper-aware of it. He was Mary’s man, after all.
The Colonel seemed to repress a sigh.
So, this was how Sherlock had arrived on BAK 2212. John found he now only had more questions.
Sherlock wasn’t paying attention any more, inching towards the window, attempting to see how much of the rest of the house was already on fire.
“Yeah, all right, give me a minute,” John said, as the hotline worker was still rattling off lewd acts. “Not much for foreplay are you?” John added, a bit annoyed. He got paid for that rubbish?
It was Harry - presumably she’d finally heard the news of the inquest from the day before (her timely interest in them was truly
but hearing it from him was something else entirely.
“One hundred percent?” Sherlock clarified, catching John’s eye.
God, this was getting out of hand. “John, if you could leave classism out of this—”
Thanks again to my lovely beta
Sherlock isn’t quite sure what to make of that.
“Yeah,” John replies, still feeling dazed. “On the bright side, I got to tell our client we found her dog.”
“Do you photosynthesize then?” John had asked.
“Do I want to know why you’re burning bits of cloth?” John asked pleasantly, a few bread crumbs about his lips.
Harry’s focus returned to her mobile and John’s turned back up to the telly. The ticker running across the bottom of the press junket read
Besides, John had never been good at self restraint. Or being cautious.
“And why the hell would he go to one of his bolt-holes?” John seethes through his teeth.
“Just needed a breath of fresh air I think,” John replied, turning slightly, but reluctant to look away from Sherlock. “I’m sorry we didn’t thank Doctor Murray for his time, he’s been very helpful.”
Fuck. Shit.
“Just a few weeks,” Greg rushed to say, aware he was breaking bad news. “We need to keep an eye on the bots. Maybe even figure out what keeps happening out there.”
John’s lips found his again readily, and as Sherlock scooted himself further up the bed, John crawled after him, never allowing him to be any further from a kiss than what a quick lunge could compensate for. Once Sherlock was far enough backward that his head struck a pillow, John promptly lay fully on top of him, and returned to devouring him properly with wet open-mouthed kisses. John’s clothing rubbed against his skin deliciously, but Sherlock did not intend to be the only nude person in their bed. While Sherlock had no qualms about being bare, this just did not seem fair. Sherlock scrabbled for the buttons of John’s shirt until John paid him the courtesy of unbuttoning them himself, and Sherlock watched the display with hunger - that is, until his eyes focused in on John’s shoulder.
First, the brick wall by the fireplace mended itself; brick by brick snapped back together, and then was covered by wood, and papered with a damask pattern.
Sherlock seemed uninterested in going into further detail, and instead continued to search John’s face with their keen pale eyes.
On such an occasion, Archie had been working alongside Sherlock, and was abandoned by his tutor without any notice. Rather than lend a hand to Archie, John elected to read the paper, though the date was more surprising than any news of the war. John was well aware that many believed it was only a matter of time before their enemy would attack Ingary; he’d seen the giant warships in the sky from the Kingsbury door. Far more shocking was that almost a month had gone by with him living in Sherlock’s castle, meaning their agreed upon deadline for the end of the arrangement was fast approaching. As far as John knew, no progress had been made on his curse, though he found he was more concerned about being kicked out than anything else.
, suggesting you were close, but then never spoke of him to me, your
It was at that moment that Sherlock realized his penis, which had been dormant for many years, was currently as flushed with blood as John’s face. He was completely erect, and if he stood from his crouch, his state would make itself very apparent.
What else could he have faked? Or, did faking end up being necessary? Janine and Sherlock seemed to get along almost immediately at the wedding. John had seen them, chatting, Janine standing close to Sherlock. John had seen them, and had walked over, and touched the small of Sherlock’s back.
> Where’s the nose?
Delirious, John contemplated that if he were in a novel, there was an author out there writing him out. Even though he had never been a religious man, he thought that might be a god worth praying to. But with his resentment at Sherlock’s author boiling up inside of him even in his last moments, John thought he’d rather die than give any author the satisfaction of begging for his life. In the end he thought of Sherlock and what he could have been—really, what
“I thought you were bored of Manderley. Or, worse than that – I thought you were already bored with me. You seemed so unhappy here, and I could understand it. I'm so much older than you, and you’d agreed to this under less than ideal circumstances. You were always talking with Lestrade, much more than you ever did with me,” John explained, and his voice soured toward the end. He realized John was jealous, that John had been
“Has your brother forgiven me for having us keep the wedding party so small and secret?” John asked, and for a moment he wondered if John could read his mind.
John fell asleep almost as soon as he had laid down his side, only dimly aware of Sherlock closing the door behind him as he left.
Sherlock’s reply drifts over as he begins tapping a response on his phone.
Well buds, welcome to Manderley......
John.
“What would you have me do?” he yelled out over the wind.
Sherlock sighed. “They’ll only call someone else. The magistrate, or the captain of the ship that got us into this.”
“All right. Tell me about him,” Watson said.
As a last ditch effort, John agreed to meet with Harry when she got in touch, already knowing the first thing he’d ask her.
You didn’t say the breeds.
When John awoke one night after a fight to the feeling of Sherlock's groin pressed flush against his leg, his husband seeking his pleasure out against him in small unconscious movements, John realized that his restraint was truly to be tested. When Sherlock woke shortly after, and immediately withdrew to the other side of the bed in understandable self consciousness, John was no longer able to hold back. He had felt Sherlock's interest against him after all, and it hadn't seemed like the kind that went away on its own. John had reached for him, testing the waters, and Sherlock had been unresisting. He'd asked permission, and Sherlock had given it.
It was in no way an exaggeration to say that he would have perished without these small distractions, as the inner workings and obsessions of his own mind would have otherwise slowly driven him to madness. Manderley didn’t offer distractions itself. With so much free time on his hands, he was unfortunately left to ponder and agonize over the reality of his present situation, which otherwise could have been ignored for quite some time.
He gripped the leather seat of the car tightly in his hands.
> Do you have one? A dog, I mean?
“God, I don’t, but I did wonder if you were maybe trying to be funny? In your own way.” Lestrade smiled to appease him, but it was awkward, more like an apologetic grimace. “Mr Watson doesn’t think you’re capable of it either, you know. It was just such a shock for him, and then after, he probably didn’t know what to think. When you first stood at the top of the stairs -”
John began to mouth the word ‘photosynthesize’ once again, however this time Sherlock pressed their mouth against his from the start of the word’s formation. Sherlock lips molded to John’s as he continued to pronounce the word. It was by far the strangest form of physical intimacy John had ever shared with another living creature.
“No begging, apparently,” John said into his headset, maintaining the farce.
Sherlock wanted to tell John that he would never need to be alone again. That they would never need to dwell on the past again. But his mind kept returning to Moriarty, and Magnussen. He wasn’t as naive as he had once been. He knew this wasn’t over.
John’s sister had finally decided to visit, and he had not been present to receive her. He truly wasn’t much good at this master of the house lark.
John kissed his bottom lip—the top one would have to wait its turn—and heaved Sherlock’s lean legs over his shoulders. With one finger, John confirmed that physically Sherlock was as ready as he was ever going to be. John opened his mouth to ask.
Sherlock seems to consider sitting on the couch next to John, but instead climbs over the coffee table and continues his wandering. Dr Davenshaw eyes him momentarily with curiosity, before quickly understanding it is to John she should direct her account.
All John could hear was the sound of the pastel-coloured sleeves of Sherlock’s jacket being buffeted by the wind, though the jacket never strayed from Sherlock’s shoulders. John focused on putting one foot in front of the other, despite no firm ground beneath them.
“You know that’s not what I meant,” John interrupted, despite a large part of him wanting nothing more than to listen to Sherlock rattle off theories on pressure across BAK 2212. “You’re the genius. You know why we’re out here. They want me to find out why the bots were breaking, and you’re well aware these samples aren’t going to tell them anything about the actual reason.”
John catches Sherlock’s lower lip between his teeth and pulls.
John resists the urge to grab the finger and bring it to his mouth.
Sherlock scoffed. He felt embarrassed, even though he was quite certain there was nothing to be embarrassed about. “Of all the….,” he trailed off, eyes dropping back to the safety of the microscope. He could still feel John smiling at him regardless.
John had intended a quiet evening, perhaps read the Lancet or watch the news, but the tabloid paper he’d planned to ignore (and instead read fourteen times) had inserted itself on top of his medical journal.
“You can’t just tear up whatever you like whenever you like,” John eventually said, but he sounded tired, already resigned to Sherlock’s behaviour. “Christ, this is going to get logged as a broken bot. Just—put him back together when you’re done, all right? And turn off the bloody alarm. I’ll be back on the Hudson.”
Gladstone looked at him, wagged his tail, and started racing about the beach in circles, barking at nothing.
“The Witch of Belgravia sent you, I take it." His voice was devoid of inflection.
“We don’t need them to do bot maintenance on uninhabited planets,” John recited, and then wished he hadn’t, as Sherlock of course immediately picked up on his tone.
When John turned his head to look back, three black mounds had joined the first, all dressed in human attire. Worse still, it seemed only more were on their way, detaching themselves from the stone surrounding them, and getting closer.
John looked at Sherlock pointedly. “Well? Go on, how did that all happen?”
Sherlock bowed his head in concession, while Watson appeared relieved that he would be able to hear the explanation. Stamford reached forward to hold her arm, hand clasped at her elbow to comfort her.
“Yes John, but
“You never intended to let me win,” Sherlock stated, voice deadly calm. “It doesn’t matter. Manderley would be destroyed no matter what.”
“Oh, how I solved it you mean?”
It isn’t until John sits that he notices her eyes are unusually glazed and unfocused. It takes John a moment but it doesn’t require a genius to see that she’s blind. A blind seer. Finally a cliché.
Sebastian’s jaw dropped, aghast, before laughing it off. “Us?
“Yourself, if you like,” Sherlock said, circling him, causing the sheet to slip down one of his shoulders. “Oh! You’re my new shop assistant, now turned caretaker, in light of my degenerate ways. I’m completely dependent on you, not fit for service at all.”
Returning home to his increasingly depressing living situation, John wondered if he was maybe a bit delusional. He was in a loop of doubting his own sanity, and conversely, his creativity. Was he even imaginative enough to make something like this up to avoid the reality of his injury? And yet, wasn’t that the most reasonable explanation?
The pair had been passing a lazy Sunday morning in silence up until this moment, each in their respective chairs, however John found this interruption unsurprising given that their last case had been over a week and a half ago.
In a recent attempt at documenting one of their cases, John had let what Sherlock would likely have classified as his ‘romanticism’ run away with him. Limited only by his piss-poor typing, John had gone so far as to describe Sherlock in detail at the moment of an epiphany, including all of the physical attributes that John’s imagination often fixated on. (John felt that the frankly orgasmic appearance of these epiphanies as they played out over Sherlock's face should really have taken at least some part of the blame.)
John’s shyness was somewhat uncharacteristic, but there was something unsettling about Sherlock seeing him like that while he was unaware. John knew he didn’t have anything to be ashamed of, quite the opposite really, but wasn’t sure if an alien would have any appreciation for that.
“Who you calling ‘rabble’?” a younger member of the military entourage piped up, though he was shushed soon after.
John was laughing in disbelief, and rolled up the paper to swat at him with. “You! It’s you, you - whatever you are!”
Another mystery that had plagued John earlier on was how Sherlock had sustained themselves. The Hudson had more meal portions aboard than John needed, as it had been stocked for more than one crew member and for a much longer journey. John had more than enough to share, however Sherlock elected to only drink tea and eat pieces of toast, and that was only if John did the buttering for them rather than the Hudson’s in-ship bot. Slowly, Sherlock was coming around to eating more varied foods under John’s insistence, the image of Sherlock’s thin frame still fresh in John’s mind.
” Sherlock shouted down the stairs.
.” They stayed in their relative positions, neither drawing back, nor moving closer together.
When they reached the top of the crater, the alien seemed to know exactly where they were heading. They even had the cheek to walk ahead of John, and at one point, John could swear they turned back to look at him and
“Oh?” he replied, quirking one of his brows. “So you can ‘come along, and carry me off’?”
Mary hadn’t drowned. John had killed Mary. John had shot her in the cottage, and then moved the body to the boat and had sunk it.
Who had John been fooling? Certainly not himself. Not successfully, at any rate.
One of the bots on the other side of the bay let out a lone chirping noise, signalling it was ready to depart for its route, and it reminded John of Sherlock’s noises from before.
Sherlock didn’t know where to look. His palms were clammy when he removed his gloves.  John’s arm was bare and he was waiting, and Sherlock had never done this before. He wasn’t sure if the arm was even the best spot, he should have paid more attention, he shouldn’t have isolated himself, he should have learned the right way to treat a human when they willingly gave, he should have learned how to keep himself calm under these circumstances—but he had not.
> What?
“They both still live at the galaxy border, quite happily I might add.”
John reopened his eyes. They were still very blue, and very candid, up close.
He felt a bit sick with himself for the first time in a long while. He had never felt guilt before about asking to see corpses, or asking questions of the dead. He was always able to dissociate. Taking care with the dead wouldn’t help solve their murders, after all.
Offering John a dark, gloved hand, with his torso bending at the waist, head ducking down, dark eyelashes fanning out with eyebrows mere brush strokes above them, the man who was Sherlock said, “Yes, I’m him.”
That punched a laugh from Sherlock’s gut, though shortly after made him tenser than before. With a forced smile he quipped, “Not everything is about sex, John.”
John stayed up, waiting for Sherlock to return.
John heard the toilet flush, which abruptly brought him back to himself, and prompted him to speed away from the door.
Moriarty nodded, scuffing his shoe against the fuel soaked floor as if bashful.
Sebastian’s criticism still rankled him, though. “I preferred Nice, is all,” he said, in his defence.
Sherlock stopped. The magic that John could sense in the air fizzled out, and Archie took in a big gulp of air.
“Because they’d want to know you’re human! And they’re not failures, no one can know everything. There’s nothing wrong with that.” John’s voice was gentle, but he sniffed at him.
“Without any description of a suspect beyond a dog killing ghost, there’s not much else I can do. But, you know, I appreciate it when you call me about these things, alright?”
John was smug the entire ride home.
Sherlock had thought he might find his own release against John’s leg, with John in his mouth, and a part of him was disappointed he hadn’t. He wiped at the side of his lips. As suspected, he’d been rather sloppy.
” John said incredulously, still pointing the 3D-printed gun at the man, his finger feeling trigger-happy after hearing Sherlock called ‘it’. “You poachers aren’t much for naming things, are you?”
John paused, thinking that over. Then, bizarrely, he smiled. The expression was reminiscent of the time John had watched Sherlock feed the homeless network.
Wilkes had apparently made a miraculous recovery, and was organizing a soirée in his room. How he’d managed to smooth things over with the previously dismissed nobodies (now considered somebodies) was unclear. Wilkes had a way with these things, and now almost the entirety of the Hotel Cote d'Azur was to be entertained in Wilkes' generously-sized hotel room.
> What was your question?
John blinks, but thinks he gets it.
“You still haven’t decided what you’re going to be wearing?” she asked when she realized. “You know, all the best places in London are going to be filled up to the brim with everyone else’s soon.”
“I’m sorry that with my youthful years there doesn’t seem much more to me. We can’t all be the incomprehensible and mysterious John Watson.”
“You said
The man, a real piece of work, John was learning, had the gall to give him puppy dog eyes. John could see why that move might actually work for him, most of the time.
different.”
“But I am,” John repeated, truly in earnest. “You were so excited about your costume, and you couldn’t have known - “
farther than the ones Master Holmes was selling before. They’re more like fifty-seven league boots.”
After Mrs Hudson came back from the shops in Market Chipping, the three of them shared a dinner of sausage and yams, with one link thrown to the dog. The plate prepared for Sherlock went cold, and was still sitting untouched when Irene and Mrs Hudson returned downstairs for bed.
“Oh I never dress up, the one advantage of being the host,” John said, rocking back on his heels. “However, I’m sure whatever you end up choosing will be the talk of the night - probably something incredibly posh.”
The curve of Watson’s lips indicated he would not be cross, before he said it aloud. "Not at all. As in all things, I trust your judgment."
Lestrade looked like he’d been caught in a trap. He bowed his head while smiling politely, remaining respectable despite the unusual turn of including him in the conversation. “I don't mind organizing the ball if Mr Watson has no issue with giving it. It's up to him and Mr Watson.”
“I won’t be needing all of you any more,” Sherlock said, lips brushing John’s hand. “Now that I’ve got the real thing.”
He imagined that the day before had gone differently between him and John in the library. More melodrama perhaps than their real life conversation - he told John he would go, he’d leave, and instead of being
Except.
Did he have a girlfriend then? A boyfriend? Was he interested in women? Or men? Or both? Not enough data.
“It's no use, is it?” Moriarty whispered. “It’s like I said, no one could ever get the better of her. She's still mistress here, even when she’s dead. You already know that don’t you? It's you that doesn’t fit. Do you understand, the final problem?”
“What’s an exciting one like, then?” John asked, in the hopes of drawing Sherlock’s attention back to him. “A few more dead toes than that?”
“Sherlock,” John said, then stopped. Heart rate spiking, John lifted his hand to cover one of Sherlock’s still touching his face. He was warm to the touch, even through the gloves, much warmer than John had expected. “I—”
Ok so some credit is due! Someone actually messaged me on tumblr to ask me about this, and yes, the layout of the house is based on the house in the movie The Pact (to mention it earlier would have spoiled the ending a bit lol). If you're worried that I've now spoiled The Pact for you (sorry), the plot is at least not at all similar?
I do not own Sherlock or anything associated with it besides the ideas in this fic.
He jerks back, out of Sherlock’s grasp. “I’m sorry,” he gasped out.
Sherlock looks dazed when his opens his eyes, staring at John longingly. His lips are a bit kiss swollen and John thinks he could stand here and look at him forever. But he doesn’t, he pulls Sherlock by the hand into the kitchen claiming they need to eat.
As john managed to let some rational thought in his brain, he supposed Sherlock was doing this to show John that he was here and he wasn’t going to leave. There was an apology in the hands that clutched his knees and a reassurance in the breath that brushed his ear.
They’re either sitting to close, which Mrs. Hudson loves. Standing too close, which Mycroft never fails to comment on. Or making unwavering eye contact, which makes Lestrade uncomfortable.
She looks like she’s weighing her options and several seconds pass before she inclines her head and lets him pass.
“So, look at me John.” John doesn’t look at Sherlock, he can’t.
As if Sherlock just now realized she was there, her turned towards her. Looking down at her and Mary staring right back up at him. He makes a sound in his throat, the one he makes when he’s deemed someone unworthy of his words. Mary parrots the same greeting back at him.
John bows backward in his chair, trying to create some distance between himself and Sherlock. He doesn’t get far when Sherlocks large hands suddenly lash out and grip John’s elbows. “Answer me,” he breaths and John can feel his warm breath ghost across his face.
But none of that mattered to Sherlock, when he’d turned the last corner and caught up to John he was, in John’s opinion, quite upset. Bypassing the criminal immediately, which Sherlock never does because the likes to gloat in their faces like the drama queen he is, and grabs John’s chin in his hands.
In the end, it wasn’t much of a choice. It never really was, John supposes. The moment Sherlock came back into his life was the end of everything else. Although, the prospect of being with Sherlock was frightening. The man already possessed so much of John, he didn’t know what would happen once Sherlock got ahold of that last piece.
“Look at me,” Sherlock says, finally having caught his breath.
“I’m Mary Morstan,” she extends her hand out for a shake and Sherlock does so without hesitating. “John and I were just getting lunch, join us would you? I’d love to talk to the infamous Sherlock Holmes.”
“It’s not that,” John says, “It’s just…” He doesn’t want Sherlock to worry, but he doesn’t know if he can get himself to look at him.
Sherlock looks at John with eyes he can’t quite place and says the nearest word he could find. Then, it’s out there, floating in the hairs breath that’s between them.
“Of course, I meant it.”
He enters their flat and instead of a hello, Sherlock greets him with a “Is it done?” He says it so matter of factly, like John has just dropped off the mail and not just broken up with one of the most important people of his life. He sets the food in the kitchen and walks back into the living room.
She’s excited and John lets her hold on to him and talk him into submission. He was worried about the separation but he thinks he’s exhausted enough to sleep to through the night with constantly worrying about Sherlocks whereabouts. He also thinks they could do with a bit of division, they’ve basically been living in each other’s pockets since he’d been back. Besides, John’s trying to work on not tying his entire sense of self into Sherlock’s.
Mary stood there in all her glory, tight lipped and fingers squeezing the door frame just a tad too hard.
John leans back in his desk chair and heaves out great sigh. He thinks about Mary and how he’s only been back to her place a handful of times since he and Sherlock were back to being a ‘dynamic duo’. He knows it’s not fair to her and knows that only a few weeks ago he was going to propose to her. And he loves her, he does. It’s just the age-old problem of trying to balance out his life with Sherlock with his life with someone else.
“How so?” Sherlock asked, in an attempt to distract. “Everyone wants to change their tune on that subject.”
Moriarty motioned with his hand in silence towards the stairs. “After you,” he said, demurely. His speech had a strange lilt, a change in tone that added a whimsical quality to it.
“Good day Moriarty,” he repeated, before hastily dropping the phone back in its cradle.
“Sorry,” John interrupted, holding up a hand as he looked about the living room. He had been too exhausted the previous evening to be observant, but he now saw there was no other bedroom on the first floor besides Mrs Hudson’s.
John laughed, relieved. “The surprise of my life, oh God. I can’t imagine. There won’t be blood involved will there? No maiming? I’d prefer minimal maiming.”
“This isn’t yoga class,” John said, smiling. Somehow, everything Sherlock did was endearing. “Get comfortable. Turn around.”
Watson’s face was, for once, devoid of expression. He couldn’t tell if Watson found the whole conversation funny, or offensive. Or maybe he just didn’t know how to interpret him any more, now that Watson had betrayed him and his confidence.
Some art !!
“Also the interpreting. God knows he used to solve a case and I’d get one text with a name and nothing else. It’s good to get an explanation every now and then.”
Almost.
“What do you know about gossip down here?” John pressed. He seemed… anxious.
When John returned, Harry announced that it was high time she and Clara left. John smiled blandly, looking excessively relieved.
“Yes John, plural!” Sherlock cried. “A mother and a father, just like you. And for God’s sake not like that!”
“You don’t understand,” Sherlock said, hands grasping at the roots of his slicked back, restrained hair. “I can’t ever know for sure that what you say is him, or me. You are, all of you, merely created in his image!”
But, when he awoke, it was just him and the spiders.
The station was unchanged from his last visit. John walked through the base’s door and headed straight for the charging bay, wondering which bot required his attention this time.
John was in fact rather distracted by Sherlock slipping out of the sleeves of their coveralls, the top half falling loosely around their waist, and the cave’s walls becoming visible as it was now illuminated by Sherlock’s exposed upper half. The gold freckles that were occasionally visible beneath Sherlock’s skin were now glowing, now closer to green than gold, John noted. Sherlock’s skin, normally in a constant state of imitating John’s pale tone, appeared purple in the darker light.
He tried to return the man’s eerie smile, trying to keep up with the game, but found he could not. Moriarty had given him a scare, and was frankly continuing to do so. He opened his mouth to speak, but couldn’t settle on the right words to say.
John seemed to abandon hope of ever getting him out of his shirts, as his hand then lowered to the top buttons of Sherlock’s breeches.
Sherlock dropping to his knees and demonstrating that devotion in the physical sense had also been, to say the least, a delightful addition to the surprise.
He leaned slightly towards John’s arm, and John lightly covered his hand. John patted him, absently.
Anderson shook his head. David was beginning to look flustered, while the Colonel’s growing doubt was plain.
> Oh, is that our barter system? Is that what we decided?
John now knew roughly where they were in the novel’s sequence of events, that Sherlock had already texted the cabbie. Which meant, technically, John had gotten what he’d wanted from the conversation.
“What the hell are you implying?” John asked, voice more than a little raised. Sherlock feared he might kick the table, though he supposed that would be a compromise if the alternative was a physical altercation.
The road ahead climbed the tall hills of Monte, circling around and around, as aimless as their traveling. At one crossroad, there was a young boy walking that smiled as they drove past, and who waved enthusiastically at them. In good humour, he even waved back. It was little moments like these that made him wonder if there was any place more agreeable than Monte.
“I was injured, though not actually in my leg. I used to be a soldier,” John responded, stupidly, considering the alien could not understand him. It was dawning on John that he had voluntarily brought a person of unknown origin into the Hudson with him who he couldn’t communicate with any better than a bot. John wondered if he’d gone a bit mad.
“Like how you can grow limbs? And your mass redistributes in your body?”
While John considered how to respond, another text followed the first, and then another.
John did laugh then. He could admit, it was a delight to see Sherlock be wrong. Though, not that he was that far off. John typed out his next message at his usual glacial pace.
“Well, we’ll just need to grab coats from inside?” he suggested, and John’s good mood seemed to return. He nodded towards Lestrade, who had appeared at the top of the stairs to the house.
“You don’t intend to serve your country.” John didn’t phrase it as a question.
He must have seemed alarmed, because John soon calmed.
“So,” John began, pointing again at the man precariously held over the railing. “You’re saying him beating up Wiggins last night for a fiver has no bearing on you now giving him a bit of a scare?”
Watson laughed. “A boy of twelve! You were a child genius then, of course. And how old are you now?”
“The same way they said I ate hearts?” Sherlock returned, rapid-fire and snippy.
Fine, John says. Yes. Okay. So, you and me, but we’re…
“But go on, you’ll be so busy packing this morning you won’t even have time to get caught up with missing Monte!” Wilkes laughed, still greatly enjoying that he had managed to keep something a secret from him.
Sherlock laughed, helpless with it. He felt as if he hadn’t laughed in decades. Eras, even. “You haven’t. But you must admit it sounds like something you would say.”
The door was locked.
Sherlock was still pressing against John’s wound, but managed to retreat from his gaze by turning his face away. “I can’t
It was difficult for John to quickly browse websites on a laptop let alone a mobile screen, but he could gather that it was the personal blog of someone who was at the very least impersonating Sherlock Holmes, and doing an excellent job of it. Something a fan might have done—only, without the novels, there was no Sherlock Holmes to impersonate.
“There are things,” John whispered, his throat moving with the effort of swallowing, “that I’ve been meaning to tell you, that I should have told you before -” John was gripping the handle of his cane. John was looking down at his feet. John was looking anywhere but at him.
Ten seconds passed before the paper was abandoned entirely, dropped unceremoniously onto the sidetable next to his armchair. “No, actually,” John said, his voice raised, “
John did a double-take, of course—who wouldn’t?—but the fabric of his tailored trousers did not leave much room for error. John’s gaze darted back and forth between Sherlock’s face, eyes still closed, and the apparent reason Sherlock had been reluctant to turn around.
With nothing covering his prick any longer, John could see the man grabbing hold of the small pillow, holding it closer to his front as he resumed his humping. Three short gasps, followed by one mewl, and then another, told John all he needed to know about how long that would last.
“You said they wanted to find out why the bots are breaking,” Sherlock said after a pause. “You have your answer.”
John watched on, bemused, eyes barely able to keep up with the alien’s movements.
Neither of them said another word as he followed Magnussen out through the drawing room and into the hall. Magnussen didn’t stop, but did look back over his shoulder at Moriarty.
And, when the wheel turned to green, John was expecting the strange winged creature that walked in.
“Because you fascinate me, John Watson,” Sherlock said. It was spoken in awe, leaving no doubt as to the truthfulness of the statement.
“You’ve eavesdropped on me?” John asked, his voice raised, using the tone that meant John found his behaviour bad, but not bad enough to care.
John heard the train coming before the black smoke rose past his window. When nothing could be seen out of the window but exhaust, the woman lifted herself onto the window ledge, and fell backward out of it, through the glass.
The response back was slower than before. Anxiety spiking, John wondered if SH really did think he was a cheater, and was about to write a post on John’s blog to let everyone know of John’s love of anal fingering guides as a form of vigilante justice.
John smiled with his brows pulled together. “That’s good? I think.”
through an opening in front of John.
He rolled his eyes. He had hoped he wouldn’t need to spell it out. “I’m suggesting you broach the subject this afternoon over tea.”
It was clear he wouldn’t get anything other than scorn if he tried to ask again, so John simply acquiesced. Admittedly, he was a bit excited, or at least more excited than he’d ever been to third wheel someone else’s phone conversation. He imagined this man couldn’t possibly be boring, even over the phone.
), but still Sherlock found his curiosity wasn’t satisfied. The combination of hating having John out of his sight and his poor impulse control had resulted in the perhaps bit not good habit of following John. Only occasionally.
“You obviously didn’t want me to go to the other cove, John. And you wish I hadn’t, I can see it in your face.”
“What are you suggesting I do, Lady Irene?” he asked, his lips numb as the words left them. “Bow out?”
By the time John arrived in town this was all considered old news, but he was still given an earful on the subject during nearly every patient consultation. However, John didn’t learn why Holmes in particular was so disliked until a young girl who worked at the pastry shop Cesari’s caught him just before closing.
“Sherlock,” John said, at once crowding his friend. John peeled Sherlock’s coat back, and along his back climbing up to his shoulder was a gash, blooming pink against the thin cotton. The shirt was sticking to the wound, and when John pulled at the collar, Sherlock shrunk down into his chair with a whimper.
John hefted Sherlock one last time, and lowered him into the bath awkwardly, banging Sherlock’s elbows and feet against the sides. But, at last, Sherlock was submerged, and John’s eyes could finally drift without guilt.
, why am I not back at home?” Sherlock had attempted to demand, but any strength his voice had gained had ebbed away by the end of the question into a weak scratchiness.
“We should return,” Mrs Stamford declared. “Allow me to apologize once more for troubling you Mr Holmes, and you Captain Watson. Coming all the way out here, for a matter that could have been solved privately!”
“We will return before our guests notice both hosts missing!” Stamford exclaimed. “Shall we see the two of you again as well?”
“Why, why, why. Why not? I made it look like someone else outside of us had hired the hit, of course,” Moriarty said, turning back towards the bed to lay the cannister on the sheets, seemingly uninterested in confirming what should have been obvious. “Couldn’t have her growing resentful and
Sherlock closed his eyes over the
They had turned the sweep of the drive, facing Manderley at last. With its classic appearance and impressive size, Manderley was somehow always pleasing to the eye. Something to be painted and admired, and for all who saw it to think the place a paradise.
John moaned and ceased discouraging him, instead slipping his hands back into Sherlock’s hair. It wasn’t to push or to pull, just to gently cradle his head. It took him a moment to work his lips around the substantial size of it, but he soon adjusted and set about taking in as much of John as he could, using his hand to make up for whatever he couldn’t accomodate. He had to pull off almost immediately to avoid gagging, but John hardly seemed to mind as he took his time. When he returned to his task he began to set a rhythm, sliding his mouth down over John’s flesh and up again, moving his hand in synchrony, with John’s hands in his hair lightly guiding his head back and forth. With the feeling of John’s hard length in his mouth and the sound of John’s moans in his ears, he repeated to himself, in utter and complete awe,
The Witch lifted the dog into her arms, and then aimed a sad, doe-eyed look in John’s direction. The dog followed her lead.
“Yes, I did, but you weren’t rude," he responded, worrying at the edge of the tablecloth. "Or at least, not the sort of rudeness that someone as thick as Wilkes would understand.”
Sherlock returned to the main area of the sitting room just as John slipped out of his suit jacket, and began to unbutton his shirt. Despite the context, Sherlock couldn’t help but watch with an interest beyond the clinical.
“Well, anyway, I suppose it’s for the best then,” John comments.
“John, hi,” Molly said, sounding apologetic, which only made John feel worse. “I know you just passed this one off to me, but….”
When I first posted this I mentioned that an epilogue was pending, andddd here it is ! I really liked where the one-shot ended, but I also really wanted this closure, and now I get to have it all. Thanks to Anna for the beta!!
Magnussen chuckled. “I think you’ll find that it...
“Yes,” John said, his quiet voice loud in the silent room, everyone collectively on the edge of their seats, all wondering where this line of inquiry would take them.
David now pointed the twisted note at Sherlock, breathing hard, and looking between the both of them as if they were demons come to haunt him. Under difference circumstances, Sherlock would have clarified his nationality, but it seemed a moot point - especially with David making himself look like a lunatic in the Colonel’s eyes.
“There are as many ways to break a curse as there are curses." Sherlock's gaze darted to the left. John supposed he was dismissed. John waited for him to continue, but Sherlock appeared to be lost in thought, staring into the fireplace.
Come here.
Gratifying, and amazing, and messy: Sherlock gasped his name, and clung, like anemone to a crab. "You were perfect,” Sherlock echoed. “I couldn’t have—ever imagined. It was everything I wanted.”
“You seem like a man who prefers action, something Florida isn’t exactly known for.”
, the discomfort became a distant and remote thing.
There was no further signature, but it was clear from the provided context (as well as the slant of the writing and the quality of the card stock) that it was from John Watson. He was floored – it was not John Watson who had been rude, and the very idea that he could have forgotten the man he’d just had coffee with. It was him who was forgotten, or remembered for being off-putting, not John Hamish Watson of Manderley.
“With the both of you so inhospitable,” Magnussen commented, turning from them to calmly sit down in John’s arm chair. “It’s impressive you’ve managed to maintain your family reputation for as long as you have.”
A damp breeze drifts in through the cracked window to nip at their exposed toes. Sherlock bends his knees till his feet press into John’s thigh. John catches them by the arches and rubs. A car somewhere outside splashes past. Something unspecified happened to the window.
“John, you’re an idiot,” Sherlock said, still breathless. “We are already tied to each other, whether this happened or not. This is just the declaration. I want this, and you. I want this marriage, and whatever comes with it. I want it to be real. I won’t let them hang you, but even they do, we’d both go down together.”
John’s concern vanished, quickly replaced by amusement.
“Yes John, I have a penis,” Sherlock answered, their attempt at haughtiness given away by the purple blush across their face. “I’ve been able to practically hear you thinking about it. You might have just asked.”
He still had to spend time with Wilkes occasionally, even if it was only for short periods. As Wilkes hated the violin and his deductions, the entertainment was restricted to endless rounds of card games. He started shuffling a deck on his way down the hall to save on time.
Pulling back from the view, he made to return to the landing and the rest of the house. However as he was about to hurry down the stairs, he heard a door behind him open, and turned to find himself face to face with Jim Moriarty.
“Yes, yes,” John grumbled. “I’m sure it’s an excellent arse.” His ego was inflated about everything, apparently.
> I never really answered your question, but you told me about your name and age, and that’s not how the barter system was meant to work, so. I answered you.
After that, the coveralls were soon dropped to the floor. Sherlock stepped out of the pool of material on the ground once John released their arms, unselfconscious in their nudity despite their earlier concerns.
However, Sherlock supposed that assumption was better than her knowing what they were actually about to do.
“Right,” John said. He laughed, not quite sure if he was even offended, or if he even should be. But Sherlock’s cheeks pinkened, and any ego damage the previous comment might have done to John was repaired.
Some things never change.
He watched her amble her away across the floor, in command of the open space. Here was someone who knew the value of the possessions Manderley had to offer. Someone to watch for indeed.
He felt himself beginning to smile, and then he started to laugh.
“How could you possibly know that?” the maître d’hotel demanded.
There was a large black door facing them, close to double John’s height. “Do you suppose that’s the way in?”
John’s expression must have given away some of his surprise, as the Wizard explained, “Yes, I know they’re the same person. And, as you’ve already pointed out, it will be hard to sell spells with your doors kicked in. Not responding to a conscription notice is considered an act of treason. Now he’ll have soldiers after him, in addition to the henchmen.”
“My husband left one on the day he died and. Well, Mr Holmes, they’ve been continuing ever since.”
- this was much worse than he had ever thought. “There had to have been an attacker. You tried to shoot Mary’s assailant, but the bullet hit her instead, by mistake. Was it Anderson, the man from the beach?”
John’s body shifted under him, his leg moving, most likely aching from having Sherlock’s weight against it, though the taller man was certain John was happier that they had made it to the couch this time instead of Sherlock going dead weight and going down in the middle of the sitting room on the hard floor, effectively pinning him there until he could get a grasp on himself enough to move. Though the brunette was beginning to wonder when John would grow tired of this, his need for some sort of physical reassurance, he had to be growing tired of it didn’t he?
The sun has just begun to rise when a nurse comes from behind the black double doors near the nurses station in the waiting room. Mycroft is up in a heart beat when he notices that she is approaching them.
“You left me a note.”
"What are you doing here?" Sherlock asked, his voice less hoarse as before as he settled his attention back on his brother.
“Oh you will soon enough, Ms. Morstan, now are you going to get in the car willingly, or am I going to have to make you?”
“Why can’t I find him Sherlock?”
No one said a word as he made his way to his office, upon returning, and it seemed as if no one had noticed that he hadn’t been gone for the better part of two hours. Though he knew that wasn’t the case. It was their jobs to keep tabs on him as much as it was his Job to keep tabs on his younger brother, though Mycroft had to admit that that aspect of his people’s job was easier than his own.
It was just little over fourteen minutes when Sherlock heard the street door open before closing and locking, his body tensing as the stairs creaked under the weight of the person walking. The door to his flat was unlocked and opened quietly as Mycroft stepped in, dressed as he would for a usual day at the office. The older man didn’t say anything as he pulled off his coat and hung it behind the door, next to Sherlock’s after he closed it. Instead he placed the things he had carried up with him on the coffee table before turning his attention to his brother.
Sherlock gasped as John began to move, the sensation as far from pleasant and despite the amount of time John had spent preparing him, it was painful and uncomfortable, even with John’s reassurances from above and the feeling of John rubbing his hips and lower back as he moved in and out slowly.
I'm sorry I haven't updated in awhile. I just had to think of how to get where this story is going.
“Come on Sunshine.” Greg called as he slid out of his seat and locked the car before walking a few paces ahead, Sherlock nodded and pulled his coat collar up before keeping his head down as he followed, careful not to run into the other man. However he looked up occasionally to make sure there was no chance of running into anyone. His heart was racing the closer they got to the building as he waited for the inevitable, but the moment they walked through the door, it was evident that Greg had chosen to take the path that was less likely to be full of people and for that he was grateful.
"I think you're done there buddy." Moran stated as he unceremoniously shoved John from the bed, Sherlock gasping as John's cock slipped free. Something warm and unpleasant trickled down his thigh and Sherlock shuttered at the thought of what it was. He watched as Moran moved towards the head of the bed, a smirk on his face as he began to unknot the ropes that held him in place.
“Hello, John?” the sound of Greg’s voice filtered through the speaker and into the dark silent alley. “what’s up?”
"I don't give a shit about any of that. You think that will scare me away? You think your smart mouth can get you out of this?” Moran asked, a sharp yet surprised edge had met his voice as he squeezed his hand a little tighter around Sherlock's mouth, his nails digging into his skin slightly. The panic that had somewhat subsided in Sherlock's stomach flared up, his heart began to pound against his rib cage as a whimper escaped his lips. His eyes were wide as he took in the malicious intent in the face looming over him, causing him to silently plead to himself that John would get up off the floor and save him.
