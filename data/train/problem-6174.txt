“Is there a problem?” Bruce asked in a carefully-calm tone, looking between Steve and Tony.
Tony ran a hand through his hair, suddenly feeling a little queasy. How much tequila had Clint poured for him? He couldn't really remember.
Hurrying down to the beach, Peter waved at them and grinned.
“Someone’s coming.”
Clint stepped between Bruce and the shop.
"WOOHOO! Alright!" The merc jumped to his feet, arms above his head. "One 90 year old man, comin' up!" He dashed off up the stairs.
Tony looked like he was trying not to laugh at the slow-motion panic on Steve’s face.
Pepper blinked and stepped toward the door.
"Not sure, sir," Jarvis said drolly.
Thor put his other hand over Loki's, smiling a little.
Frowning, Clint decided to wait on telling Bruce that. Cap and Tony had been pretty damn clear about Hulk not being allowed on the trip.
Bruce looked at him—kind of. More stared through him. He was probably in a mental struggle with the Hulk at that very moment. Hawkeye grabbing onto him seemed to snap him out of it slightly, though, and he sucked in a breath. It wasn't as deep as it could've been, but it was an effort.
Snagging a second pack of the flags, Bruce smiled at him.
"It's got to be Doctor Doom," Tony grumbled over the mic. "The signal's coming from Latveria, who else, right?"
The night air was nice as it blew over Clint’s face, cooling the flush from all the tequila. He was definitely still drunk, but some of his senses had started to return.
"Water w-would be great." Cap nodded, returning Tony's pat. He circled back around the room to the chair where he had sat earlier. It was the only one not covered in wires and parts. The blond man sat down, leaning back against it and sighing. Vague images of Doom playing the piano flashed through his mind, yet he ignored them. The weekend couldn't get any more bizarre. He wouldn't be surprised if he found out next that Modok played the harp.
That meant the Clint he'd thought of as real was actually the real one, didn't it?
Clint muttered something under his breath, taking another sip from his coffee.
Peter tilted his head, trying to decide if he was just imagining Hank's face flushing. It was Thor, anybody would get a little flustered, right? Hank was the straightest person Peter knew, sooo probably he was just projecting about him and Wade.
“That’s good,” Cap told Bruce, “but just camp a bit closer. Please.”
"Let's just go, Thor," Hawkeye grumbled, heading out the door. "I hope it isn't still raining..."
Picking the glass back up, Cap sipped it lightly to make sure it was actually water. It was indeed water, and his parched throat felt better with even a few sips. His lungs were on fire, and it took a lot of effort not to cough while drinking it. As soon as he felt his voice coming back, he looked to Doom again and sighed.
Giving up on scraping the burnt marshmallow off the stick, Peter dropped it beside him and turned to hug Wade sideways.
"Fair point," Peter said with an uneasy laugh back.
Blinking, Steve stared at Bruce some more. Wait. If the scientist was asking…
Uncomfortable, Cap looked back out to sea.
Not far away at the end of the couch, Loki saw that Hawkeye looked like he wanted to kill him. Goody.
Clint stared up at him, tucking his nose under the covers as he stuck a hand out to point across the room.
Beside Tony, Cap crossed his arms and shook his head.
Alarmed, Cap stared at him as the marshmallow ignited into a blazing ball.
“Yeah, YOU! You know this was my weekend with Spidey and you show up, actin’ all cute with his dads! What the hell, man! I’m trying to make a good impression here!”
Shifting to let Bruce reach his back, Clint cleared his throat.
Waving a hand over his head in one wide sweep, the familiar glow of green magic revealed his true form. Loki leaned back against the table, fixing Doctor Doom with a charming smile.
Bruce was an odd person. Clint was never sure how to act around him. They’d shared countless missions together when Bruce was in the Hulk’s head, but they never really got to talk. Bruce probably felt like he knew Clint a lot better than Clint knew him.
“Race ya!” Clint barked, jumping back into the water. How the hell was Bruce being so casual about touching him?
"Well, I don't mind warm rain like this, but we'd better get inside so we don't get hit by lightning," Peter suggested quickly, hurrying over to help Wade to his feet. "You okay?"
Blushing, he sipped it and glanced at Loki. “So, um, you here for the whole weekend, or…?”
Clint shifting a bit must have disturbed Bruce's silent sleep, because he stirred a little, sighing slowly. Noticing he was nestled up against someone, he suddenly froze, then cautiously opened his eyes. They were still brown, luckily.
With the nice weather, hopefully the storm would wear itself out before Tony gave up on him again.
“Thor? My, what a unique name,” Lola mumbled, gold nailed fingertips playing with the tote bag’s handle. “I came out here for some fun, myself. I was trying to get away from my normal routine, but it just keeps following me!” The woman dropped the bag to one hand, propping the other on her hip. “You’d think this beach was well known!”
Bruce waved the bottle away, putting both palms on Clint's back behind his shoulders and smoothing what felt like quite a bit of sunscreen up onto his neck and over each shoulder. Clint was a lot more familiar with the Hulk's hands than Bruce's--that one time Hulk had grabbed him by the freaking face the day they met was particularly memorable--so the careful, light movements were pretty unexpected. It almost felt TOO careful, like Bruce was afraid of applying any pressure at all. He was pretty thorough, though, covering Clint's upper back, the tops of his shoulders, and the back and sides of his neck.
“No no, I’m sorry, you had a question, I didn’t mean to interrupt,” Steve defers, the words sounding as fake as they absolutely are. He’s grinning so hard his cheeks are starting to hurt.
sealed, fully bonded, their hearts and minds pouring into each other the way they had always been meant to. No more catching and throwing random feelings: he should have been able to look into Steve’s eyes and project the knowledge of who he was and what had happened straight into Steve’s brain, and would have followed that right up with directions to Strange’s office. He could’ve been back on his own two feet four and a half days ago, and spent that time getting to know Steve properly.
Tony squinted at him, incredulous, and peered at him sideways. He pointed a finger at Steve’s chest. Steve’s jaw dropped.
The table
Thirty-five minutes later it was still only a quarter past eleven in the morning, but the plan had been a bit light on details so Steve had shown up back on the common floor twenty-eight minutes ago with his walking shoes on and his dog harnessed. He’d combed his hair the old-fashioned way (because he was still sure he wasn’t doing it right when he tried to do it any different) and was dressed in a soft blue henley, a leather bomber jacket, and a worryingly tight pair of jeans that Clint had once told him to wear if he should find himself stepping out with a fella.
A few days later when he’d walked in on the happy couple sitting hip-to-hip on the common room couch and jointly snuggling the dog, he hadn’t even bolted. Tony had found it in himself to greet them pleasantly, get what he’d wanted out of the fridge, politely decline whatever they’d been trying to ask him, and only then made a dignified retreat.
“Cheerful area, isn’t it?” he remarked with a smile, nodding at one of the many rainbow-striped flags dangling from an upper-floor apartment window.
he’s got the side of his thumb on Tony’s forehead, gently scrubbing the short fur at the top of his face back and forth. Tony is melting, he’s dying, he’s died, he’s in heaven. His whole body is tingly and warm, he’s got chills shooting all the way down his spine to the tip of his tail. He tips his face to the side, crushing his cheek into Steve’s palm, and Steve obediently digs deeper, pressing harder until it’s almost too much. Tony’s tongue flicks out without his quite deciding to let it, and he gets just a couple tastes of warm, salty skin before Steve pulls away.
Eventually, Penny’s returning gallop after each catch slowed first to a trot, then to a walk, until finally she watched Steve fling a disc out over the grass with only a morose sort of longing, and lay down at his feet instead of chasing it. Clint checked his phone and found that they’d been out for nearly three hours, so Steve scooped his exhausted pup into his arms, clipped on her leash in case she got bored of being carried before they reached the car, rescued the errant frisbee and began the trek home.
Steve had been busy chugging his post-run shake, so it had been Clint who’d asked, “Birthday
“Well, then, pull up a stovetop, instead.”
“OH, oh my god, this is the
“And a pinch to grow on.”
The second video is also short, following a similar style to the first. This time it opens on a shot of his hand holding a cell phone, with the living room out of focus in the background. It’s not his own phone, because he’s using that to film, but rather a spare--an older model, one of many that Tony keeps stashed in their apartment in case he needs something to tinker at. The screen of the phone in the video shows what appears to be a text conversation between himself and Tony. (This conversation is, in fact, fake, and is itself a video--created by JARVIS for the sake of expediency--and all Steve has to do in the moment is try to swipe his thumb along the line of the typing animation as his replies appear.) On the fake phone, a string of heart emojis timestamped as being from yesterday afternoon slowly rolls off the top of the screen as new messages appear.
“How do you know?” Steve’s voice climbed in pitch, very much against his will.
"Cap's poisoned?" Peter leaned into the view of the card, too. Undoubtedly he, Johnny and Carol looked like some three-headed monstrosity on Tony's side of the view. "Doom poisoned him?"
Clint paced, rubbing his forehead and racing through the list of suspects all over again.
"I d-don't think that's a good i-idea," the captain said, also coming over to the door. "Tony should be back s-soon." He coughed deeply, placing a hand on his throat. The medicine was taking its sweet time to start working—or it wasn't working at all.
Carefully catching Bruce’s hand before he could start stitching, Clint gawked at him.
"Why did we even bother with a vacation?" He asked Daredevil, mostly because he was the only person there to talk at. Without waiting for a reply, he added tiredly, "How exactly did you track Deadpool here, by the way? How well do you know the guy? Do you know his real identity?"
"ERK," came the smashed reply. Clint struggled to break free. "Thor—Thor, OW!"
“Sounds good to me!”
"What is repulsive about caring for one's kin?"
With a very sinister laugh, Loki smacked the fake Clint aside.
"Um." Clint froze, stiffening up under Bruce’s head. "Okay then," he mumbled to himself.
The sun was sinking below the horizon by the time the second round of Avengers came home to their mansion. Loki stood patiently waiting by his fake ice cream cart, eying Hawkeye as he slid off of the Hulk’s back.
"No, no, that's exactly what we can do," Peter realized, blinking. "The site doesn't even have to exist because we won't have a phone or computer to show it to them, so I can just explain the kayak game and say I read about it online! Yesterday, maybe. Before my phone died." Pulling said phone out of his pocket, he turned the power off pointedly.
Crawling out of his sleeping bag, Tony stretched and shoved a pair of shoes on, grabbing the coffee pot. He stepped out of the tent and meandered toward the campfire, yawning. What time was it, anyway?
Cap followed Bruce's movement, leaning on the edge of the medical table a bit too heavily.
"Is he still coughing?" The shirtless Clint asked, concerned. "Can Tony cure it?"
It took a few minutes for Clint to realize that the taxi never turned around to go to the Avengers Mansion. In fact, it was going exactly the opposite direction—and into a tunnel, to boot.
"Okay. Just don't freak out." The blond leaned over and kissed Bruce's cheek, pausing to smirk at him. "Did I really mess with his head that much? Hm. I'll remember that." He sat back up, casually smoothing his hair with a hand.
"Brother! Do not wish my allies dead," Thor said, frowning and turning back to him. "Though he can be foolish at times, Tony Stark is a great warrior." Tony had just mustered up a smile at that when the thunder god added worriedly, "And think of the heartbreak the captain would endure should he meet his end."
Tony raised an eyebrow.
Deadpool walked up, waving.
He wrapped his arms around himself and shrugged his shoulders a little. “You can talk to Hulk directly about the tent thing if you still think it was malicious, but I’ll warn you right now, he probably won’t take that talk as well as I did. Peter doesn’t think I have anything against him or his friends, does he?” He looked truly bothered about that possibility.
"I'm sure somebody has something you can borrow that'll fit," Tony countered. "'Til then, at least take the mask off."
"Yup, that's us," Tony said, as if challenging her to question it. "And he's a high schooler, so...HOW do you know him again?"
“Oh no, Matt did all the talkin’. Hot ginger to hot ginger. I think Matt said he was your cousin or something? I don’t remember. Oh and MJ might think you’re a punk that needed a lawyer.”
She leaned her head against the stair railing beside her and sighed. "So...how's Tony?"
Tony felt the hand on his shoulder and sighed, the tension draining away. He looked up at Thor expectantly.
"Don't worry, Cap. Tony's not blond," Loki reassured him from his spot on the medical bed.
"I have already traced Captain America's and Hawkeye's last known locations through their Avengers cards," Jarvis responded. "The Captain activated his hours ago today, but it was promptly shut off, and now both are untraceable."
Without comment, the Ice Giant slid his hand under Tony's—it was surprisingly cold. Then, with a more than slightly evil grin, the demigod's hand pulsated with energy. It sent a shock through the billionaire's entire body. The usual soft hum of the reactor gave way to an alarming whine. Tony’s vision had started to turn green when finally it stopped.
When he opened his eyes, he saw Bruce get to his feet, carefully staying behind the couch to peer over the top at him.
Counting how many push ups he did was a waste of Captain America’s time. Watching the carpet as it almost brushed his nose, the big blond man was lost in thought.
Wait, it would be really awkward for poor Bruce if he WASN’T part of their relationship…
Groaning in annoyance, Loki got slowly to his feet. His stitches had definitely been ripped clean open. Blood was seeping through the hand that had been held tightly against his wound.
“I had an accident last night. SO tragic. I was swimming and was bitten by a radioactive catfish!”
"Come on, we'll be home a lot quicker this way, too."
Doom watched Iron Man go, apparently unconcerned with how he'd find his way outside, before turning and stepping inside the cell with Steve.
His stomach gave a shockingly loud grumble as the root beer hit it, and he laughed nervously.
He started walking again, but glanced over his shoulder. Bad idea--set a sway into motion he had to take a couple steps to counter-balance. "What's so bad about Peter actually being serious, anyway? What, he has to be a moody brat about relationships just because he's in high school, is that it?" The gay part was actually more bemusing, because Tony was dead positive the kid was bisexual. He'd had a girlfriend before, right?
…On the other hand, did Peter really want the God of Mischief to know who he was actually with? He was even wearing Clint’s sweatshirt at the moment.
"Explod--guys, the most dangerous things where we're going are the bowl-sized margaritas!" Tony said, glancing over his shoulder at Hawkeye in the back. Through the back window, he could see the other identical SUV trailing after them with a weary-looking Hank Pym behind the wheel. "I'm not going to turn this car around, so just RELAX. If you even know how."
“I was saving him, fool,” he huffed angrily, unable to stand on his own much either. “An investment to stave off the boredom later.”
"Tony can't buy another YOU," he sighed, reluctantly climbing under the blankets despite his better judgment. He hugged one side of the blankets close around himself and laid his head on the pillow, watching Clint sidelong like the man might leap at him suddenly or something.
If he hadn't already, because Steve had raised an eyebrow at him.
Something went clattering past his feet, spinning and washing away in the water. Just as Peter realized that it was Clint’s bow, the archer rocketed past him—also spinning.
Peter sat up quickly, holding up a hand.
"Be strong, my friend!" T-shirt Clint didn't have a chance to reply before Thor was crushing him in a big hug. "Stark, I wish to be imprisoned along with them. It is not right to be on the other side of the cell!"
They came into view of the living room as Tony held up an armored hand.
Peter held up both hands quickly.
Bruce mustered a weary smile.
Peter hardly paid any attention to the three of them walking away. He was wondering how he could possibly salvage the situation he was now stuck in with Wade and his sort-of-parental-figures all around the same campfire.
Without hesitation, Clint wrapped an arm around Bruce's shoulder, leaning heavily on him.
Bruce hurried after the two blondes. Moving up alongside them, he reached and patted Loki's shoulder, then Hawkeye's.
“Do you think they’ll be watching us? Should we stay on the beach?” Matt asked, still whispering. “I sunburn really easily.”
Grumbling, Clint just shook his head and went back to his coffee.
"We..don't...ne..." The captain coughed deeply and settled for simply shaking his head.
Pepper took a step back quickly, trying to stay out of his way.
"Hey bub."
Peter blinked, glancing between him and Bruce. The scientist nodded to confirm Clint's explanation.
Should he be snarky and make some quip about soap opera death scenes? Tell Cap he was clingy and old-fashioned to be so melodramatic? ...Maybe be honest, and admit he was actually in a fair amount of pain, and yes, that plan to hook up to the power had been kind of stupid, but he'd done it for Cap's sake without a second thought.
At the hand being placed on his back, Clint slowed his pace.
The train finally arrived, grinding to a halt next to the grimy platform. People boarded in an extremely slow line. It wasn't any mystery why the train was so late. After what seemed like half an hour, Peter had made it to the train's door.
Not that Tony was frustrated or anything.
“Yes, dinner’s ready—and while you’re eating, think about how your actions affect the team.”
“Decaf,” Bruce mumbled, wrapping his arms around himself. He felt sick. What if neither of the Clints was real? What if he had developed some kind of feelings for somebody who wasn't even real? Not that it mattered—he couldn't have a real relationship, anyway, with his “condition”.
"Huh?" Peter did his best to detach Wade's arms from around his waist, frowning. "What FOR? I said I had to go sleep when I left!"
“Hold up, kid,” Tony called, stepping over to stand with Steve. “Wade seems like a guy who can handle putting out a campfire on his own.”
"Alone?" Doom looked at him skeptically. Pepper, meanwhile, was doing her best NOT to look at Doom, Clint noticed.
“Sounds like it might work—but can we plot AFTER dinner? I’m starving.”
Not well, from the looks of it.
"Don't worry, I can still take a hit as plain old me, you know."
"Hawkeye! You are wounded, friend," he said in concern, reaching for Loki.
“Yeah, root beer miserable,” Clint grumbled before the scientist’s words sunk in. Sunscreen? Bruce needed sunscreen? Playing it cool, Clint shrugged. “Sure, I can get your back if you want.”
"You better stay here," Clint sighed, heading after Tony. "He's probably gonna dissect me."
"He what!" He whispered, grabbing Cap's arm and peeking over his shoulder back at the frisbee game. He turned back to Steve, eyes shining. "W-well, what did you say back? Did you say anything back?"
Wow, the Avengers had been hanging out with a super villain all week!
A bit distracted, Steve skipped his first stone and was surprised how far out it went.
Dating somebody as only your hero identity sounded ridiculous. The idea of hiding who he was and always being encased in his armor at public events was one of the reasons Tony had just told the world at large his identity pretty much immediately. Peter didn't have billions of dollars and almost as many bodyguards to protect his normal persona from super villains, though. Oh no...
Looking off longingly down the hall, Loki turned back toward the medical room. If he acted too suspicious, his cover would be blown too soon.
The beach was gorgeous. There were indeed people around, though. Mostly rich fancy types on their folding lounge chairs, with massive colorful umbrellas over their heads while they read on their tablets.
Stark tower had made a refreshing shadow on the sidewalks around it, and Steve had found a comfy spot on one of the many benches in the shade to read his morning newspaper. He yawned, sipping on his large coffee. It was amazing how peaceful the mornings could be. Birds were tweeting overheard, a gentle breeze blew by and people were screaming obscenities at taxi drivers in the middle of the street.
“Y-y-you—” He sputtered, fuming. Glancing back at them, Clint looked suddenly nervous. He turned back to Loki. “You! You aren't...I hate you!”
“I should go, too. I could head up the trail on foot.”
Pepper sat down beside him and patted his shoulder.
“It got Hotguy!” Deadpool yelled shrilly, kicking his feet and dragging Peter along toward the mucky shoreline.
"Well?" Bruce watched Tony carefully. He kept a hand on Clint's shoulder protectively, suspecting Iron Man might just shoot whoever turned out to be the impostor on sight.
He knelt in front of Tony, placing a hand on his knee. "I'm rich, I have lots of guns and I'm unemployed at the moment—so I'll be able to take care of him, protect him, and give him all the love he needs." The entire speech was accompanied with sweeping arm gestures and loving tones. "Oh, and I'll have him back here before midnight. M’kay?"
Clint slammed into his back, growling at the impact. Holding his side, he stepped around Peter to frown at the little tunnel.
The shivering blond man looked disappointed at this, turning his attention back to the TV. A blood spattered baby sat back in its crib, sucking on the thumb of the burglar's arm.
"Don't worry, Cap. You'll be back in your spangles soon."
"Oh, give the professional focus speech a rest!" Tony retorted, waving his root beer bottle indignantly. It sloshed a bit, but at the moment he didn't care. Steve thought HE was the one playing games? "This is a vacation--it's supposed to be a BREAK from being responsible for the fate of the world at large. As for you and me, forget it, forget I said anything--you clearly don't want to touch that topic with a ten foot pole. I'm not toying with you, but I guess a plain, cold, PROFESSIONAL working relationship is all you want us to have, so, fine. Done. Maybe now you'll be happy instead of moping around like a stick in the mud all week."
"Yeah, and cooperation means telling me how you got the Hulk to visit twice in one night!" Tony added, smirking.
"Finally! Geez!"
He coughed lightly and dug around for the first aid kit, making small talk to distract from the situation at hand. "Let's run a few tests, make sure you're not melting from the inside-out or something, and then I'll get Jarvis to synthesize a cure for the gas."
"Give up on the sandwiches."
The shirtless Clint leaned against the other side of the door, eying the first one.
Remembering he was in the middle of a conversation with Cap, Peter snapped back to looking at him, smiling uncertainly. “What’d you say?”
“Aye, the meatball subs of legend!” Turning hopeful eyes back to Loki, he lifted one of the lady Trickster’s hands and kissed it gently. “Please?”
Who the hell was Wentworth, Clint wondered tiredly, stepping to stand beside Peter and Matt. If they were gonna talk to Loki, he wanted to be ready to shoot him.
The scientist blinked at him worriedly as some loud movie trailer began to blare from the TV. He was joking, right? If they woke the Hulk up ONE more time when he was supposed to be sleeping, Bruce was worried that Clint would end up a fine paste on the kitchen floor.
"Hey Jarvis, where's Spider-Man?"
"I actually left last night," he informed Johnny, shrugging. "My aunt will worry if I'm gone in the morning when I was supposed to be in my bed."
While it wouldn’t bother him to be out in the elements, Tony was a normal man, and if there was any chance that he’d get ill or, heaven forbid, struck by lightning, Steve would rather paddle through the storm.
Loki sputtered, weirdly caught off guard by Thor’s silly assumption.
"Hey, when's breakfast?"
“What does that mean?” Cap asked, clearly not amused by Deadpool’s nonsense so early in the morning.
The scientist started stepping around him.
Tucking the second big bag of sandwiches into the other car, Peter mentally checked off what else to do. They had returned the rental kayaks (apparently Tony had to pay to patch up the shark-bitten one, because the rental place believed he and Cap just broke it), they’d packed up clothes and belongings, and Peter had made the whole team sandwiches. Most important of all, Cap and Tony were actually getting along, better than Peter had seen them get along in months. So well, in fact, that Peter had hope they weren’t still pretending to be in the friend zone.
“I can hear you,” Clint commented dryly.
"I'm f-alright Ms. Potts. Don't...worry." He told her, closing his eyes to rest for a moment. It was pretty unlikely that Doom would just let him die, anyway.
The archer suddenly scooted over next to him, holding up half of the vest over Bruce's head.
Cap glanced his way and then to the Clint in front of him.
“Alright, creep, I told you Peter’s not here! Get lost.”
"Yep," the agent across the room agreed. He was holding another arrow just like the first—slowly rotating it in hand and staring at it with disbelief.
“Where is Stark?”
Rather than inform Clint that he was boring like usual, this time Bruce was compelled to heavy, awkward silence. He was second-guessing everything Clint said now, and trying very hard not to think about the fact that every inch of his room in the mansion had cameras in it.
The storm had been swept away, leaving only thin wispy clouds drifting in a bright blue sky. Peter could see all the way out to sea now and sure enough, a kayak was making its way toward the sandy shoreline.
Stuffing his foot back into the hiking boot and lacing it as quickly as possible, Clint went to get up…and didn’t.
"Outside? Why?" He exchanged a glance with Steve.
"Bruce, maybe you should go c-check on him. He's alone down there. Actually," the large blond moved back toward the door. "I'll go. You go get Miss Pots—she's still outside."
“Thanks, Clint. I wish he was kidding about the wood chipper, but he’s probably not.” Stepping just inside the cave door, he pulled his phone out of his backpack and tried dialing somebody. Tony, probably. He must have been worried to try it outside in the rain. “…Aww, c’mon. No reception again?”
“But WHY?” Steve asked, baffled. “Do you really think Hulk was so angry that he’d lash out at a blind man? That doesn’t seem like him at all.”
"Captain America and Tony? Stark, Tony Stark?" She asked.
"Let me out of here!" The pajama one growled, slamming a hand on the cell wall. Ms. Marvel moved closer, on guard in case she had to stop a rogue Clint from escaping.
“Just a plain stinkin’ onion. You aren’t nothing.” He held the onion up, looking it in the ‘eye’ before whispering to it creepily. “I’m gonna peel you like Logan.”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Matt was scowling.
"Yeah, well, I'm you." The shirtless one poked his shoulder back. He squinted at his lookalike and shook his head. "There's no way my nose is that big."
Turning to his friend, Cap’s determination faltered. Tony was within arms’ reach, his hands warm through Steve’s shirt and his eyes concerned over the silliness of Steve plunging into the stormy sea after a simple recipe card.
Offering a smile, Peter stuck out a hand.
Matt seemed surprised at the comment and frowned back at him.
"How about no? I've got a test to study for, man. And whoever you stole that wig from is gonna come back and light it on fire while you're wearin' it, and I really don't wanna be around to smell that, so I'm takin' off."
A short pause, then Clint cleared his throat only to lower his voice.
As if there wasn’t a big enough crowd in camp already, Tony arrived, dashing up behind Steve. The trees seemed to move opposite the lake, too, before Clint realized the wall of green was in fact the Hulk trudging toward the campfire, too. He took one look at Loki and growled.
"That's what I said. Okay."
"No harm done," Tony promised, for once not adding something sarcastic at the end. He looked up at Steve and fell silent, topaz eyes distant with thought. "...You okay?"  Tony asked, seeming bothered all of a sudden.
“Um…should we pretend to be dating? Might make everyone more open to the idea. Or would that be weird?” Clint mused, frowning to himself.
"Carol! Come to take in the scenery with me?"
“You know Peter would never put someone in harm’s way, especially someone he’s fond of. Besides, Wade hasn’t done anything romantic toward Peter. Maybe we have it all wrong.”
SNAP!
“Ah yes.” Cap looked at Wade, who was still lingering next to him. “When we made that deal, it was with the agreement that Wade stayed for two more days. If we cut our vacation short…”
That blocked the view of the toaster Bruce had been staring at, snapping him out of his daze. He looked at Clint, too exhausted to make any excuses.
“The power’s out.” Matt relented and patted Wade’s arm gingerly.
Peter, Tony observed with suspicion, looked like a deer in the headlights.
"Uh...yeah. I-I only tried the drink kind because Doom did. This's more effective. Need...titanium needle, though. I might sit on the floor soon," Bruce warned Clint tiredly.
“I wouldn’t mind knowing you better than I do,” Peter blurted out, and wow, that actually sounded halfway smooth. Weird. “If, you know, if you’re even interested in that.” ‘In me’ was what he WANTED to say, but that was just too direct a rejection if Matt turned around and said no. This was nerve-wracking enough as it was! They should be going out there and finding Wade and carrying through with the plan, that would be the easy distraction method. Peter didn’t want to be like Cap and Tony about this, though. He wanted to know what Matt thought, not avoid it.
The merc stared up at him with beady little white covered eyes.
Ignoring the offered hand, Matt kept picking up dishes.
"We should probably talk to Cap tomorrow, though," he said a bit guiltily. "The last thing I want him to think is that I'm angry at him."
"Completely," Clint said slyly. "I think I know how to get Thor's brother here."
"I'm being careful not to injure you worse." To Hawkeye, he added, "Could you please hand me that medical briefcase?" He nodded over to the counter, glancing at the other blond. "Once I pull this out, there's going to be a lot more bleeding."
Peter hadn’t actually spent any time up close to Loki, had only read about the Trickster on the database and seen some pictures. He hadn’t gotten one whiff of danger from Lola this whole vacation, so either Loki wasn’t there to actually cause trouble or the Spidey Sense was just as fooled.
At least this room was warmer than the dungeon. And this cushioned chair was actually very comfortable...and the music just blended together into soft little chimes, beckoning him into dreams. When he closed his eyes he almost forgot where he was.
Thor stopped Mjolnir from spinning abruptly, catching the handle in his hand. Standing up straighter, he turned concerned blue eyes on Steve.
"Awesome! What'cha making?" Johnny followed, giving Thor a pat on his way past.
"You can call Matt later," Peter told Wade quickly, then turned and jogged past Cap to Tony's side of the play area. "I'm here, I'm here!"
"What happened, they mess up his sandwich order?" Peter joked, swinging to a different building as the green behemoth went swinging at the first one.
"Always, sir," the AI replied, deadpan.
"We're about to begin our descent, so be sure your seat belts are buckled, your tray tables are up, and your arms and legs are inside the vehicle," Tony said drolly, sending them into a dive down toward the mansion. "Thank you for flying with Stark Express Airlines! Oh, and something about peanuts, etc, etc."
“WOO!” The loud blond shouted, dropping Peter onto his feet again.
Or on Earth, thank god.
“He went to try and call Bruce again. We haven’t seen him for awhile.”
The assumed Loki, since he still looked like Clint, landed on the ground with a thunk. With Hulk on a rampage, he was lucky he looked like Clint. As he started to sit up, Amora landed on his back, wringing his neck.
"Then that's not really your fault," Bruce pointed out, looking at him sidelong. Dubiously, he added, "Clones don't get the person's memories, though—and you're definitely you."
…Or did he?
Deadpool froze up, glancing from Cap to Peter and back.
Hanging up the call, he shoved the phone into the nearest pocket of his backpack and immediately started up the trail again without looking back. “Okay, it’s hikin’ time!”
“She’s Loki,” Matt clarified, waving a hand. “In case she told you otherwise.”
As soon as she was out of earshot, Cap turned back to him looking very grim.
"Will you two cut it out already...?" Bruce sighed against Loki's back.
"Hot dogs?" Johnny looked down at him. "With Deadpool? Man, don't eat hot dogs with him! People'll talk!"
“Well, if you don’t need anything else from us—”
He glanced over at Clint, who had been laying on the table very quietly for some time now. The other Clint had been the one to decide he should be restrained; really, injured like he was, it wasn't like he was much of a threat.
“But isn’t she really, uh, a he?” Peter asked, now feeling just plain sheepish. Thor seemed to think this whole thing was a great joke. Whether Loki was male or female didn’t seem to matter to him, either. Was looking like a lady part of the facade, or…
The kid looked like he might be tearing up a little.
Bruce groggily became aware of a mechanical beeping sound somewhere near him. Sounded almost like those lab heart monitors he'd been hooked to countless times over the years. There was nothing attached to his arms, though, so it wasn't hooked to him.
Bruce turned his head to peek over Clint's shoulder at Steve.
Bruce had just stepped back over to put an arm around Cap's waist and let the man lean on his slim shoulders—since Hawkeye wasn't jumping to offer to help, for some reason—when there was a loud crashing sound out in the hallway.
"Let's elope!" Wade shouted, standing up out of his seat to hug Peter around the shoulders. "To the land of hotdogs and women younger than your grandma there." He added, jerking a thumb at the house.
“No, no. Tony and I aren’t homo… Aren’t together,” he corrected himself, shaking his head slowly. “That article was also faked. Someone is very talented at manipulating photographs.”
Spider-Man slung a web up to the side of the nearest building and stuck to the wall, crawling sideways along rather than walking down there.
"Let's go," Bruce mumbled. He was pretty sure there WAS no good way to be strapped to a table naked by Doctor Doom.
The First Avenger led the way back up the steps to the cabin.
"Cap? Tony sent you here alone?" He waved for the blonde to step inside.
"Don't want to be that close to the evil robot, huh? Fine," Clint quipped, rolling over onto his face. After a moment, the blond muttered through his pillow, "Might want to turn on the heater."
“Holy hangry Robin Hood, Batman! You want a granola bar or somethin’?”
But Deadpool had completely calmed down, his mood turning on a dime as he gave Peter a big smile from under his mask.
"It's MY bow." Hawkeye told him, aiming at Loki’s chest and drawing the shot back. "And since you're supposed to be me, you know exactly which arrow this is."
A little distracting meddling sounded pretty good right about now.
"Okay, I'll stay here and you go check it out." He gestured to one of the medical beds.
"Wanna smash who poisoned him," the Hulk grumbled, smacking a fist into his palm. He seemed resigned, though.
"...Later then," the armored Avenger added, turning and rocketing away toward the entrance to Castle Doom.
“Hello Peter,” Cap said, rather glumly. The man managed a small smile, putting a hand on Peter’s shoulder as they headed toward the bonfire. “I was starting to wonder if you got lost at sea.”
“Take a first aid kit,” Hulk said flatly. Aw damn it, was there blood running down Clint’s arm again?
“Oh, it’s not as bad as it looks,” Lola told him, placing her hand in his and shaking it. She looked from Tony to Steve, smiling tightly. “Are you his parents?”
"If I sleep through this, it's not because I'm bored," he said tonelessly, rubbing at one eye.
First Peter was dating Deadpool, and now the super villains were starting to show up. This was going great.
“Clint, part of taking a break from your normal routine is slowing down,” Captain America lectured, hopping out of the SUV and turning to haul the cooler with him. “Tony will open the doors. Just help Bruce start unloading the car.”
“WHAT?” The purple hooded Avenger laughed, glancing back up at the Hulk. “Are you SERIOUS? Come on, Tony! Like we’d ever…you know!”
"Let's just...not," Bruce said glumly, holding up a hand. It happened to be the one he'd tossed a bandage on after getting stabbed with the needle earlier. He probably should clean and dress it properly, but at the moment he didn't feel like it. Even if this Clint WAS the real one, after whatever ordeal he'd been through with Doctor Doom, romance was probably the last thing on his mind.
“Anybody home?” Clint called, listening to see if there was any kind of response. There wasn’t.
Rain beat down on the roof of the cabin. The shadows cast by the candle in the middle of the circle wobbled and swayed across the walls, long and eerie. Peter was doing his best to look spooky while telling a creepy story about a guy who lost his skin in an acid accident and ran around stealing the skins off of other people. Which was gross, sure, but honestly he'd seen worse in his line of work. What was freakier than 'an alien tentacle slime monster fell from orbit, took over my body, and made me drool a lot'?
“We don’t need the whole team. It’d be nice if we had everyone’s help, but I’ll bet Cap and Tony will do it. It’ll make them feel like they’re focusing on us.”
Why was the scrawny little scientist so intimidating!
Tony, being Tony, just assumed the rescue would go without a hitch.
"For dessert, duh!" Wade yelled, squeezing him. "More like breakfast now..." He added in a mutter.
"Then c'mon already, I'm hungry," Spidey added, sounding determined. He'd see this outing through, Wade would go to Detroit and things would be much quieter after that. He hoped.
“They’re up the mountain looking for YOU,” Tony grumbled, waving a hand at him. “Never mind. You guys should change into some dry clothes.” He started over toward Steve, shaking his head.
Lifting one of the donuts from the box gingerly, Bruce watched the blond.
"I'm gonna go lend a hand!" He swung off the way the Hulk had gone.
"Oh boy." Clint cringed, leaning away from the masked man. "Exactly what 'use' do you need me for, Wall-E?"
Wow, maybe Wade DID know a shortcut.
It might be fun to spread some rumors about Doom, Clint thought. Doom would be none the wiser.
"We're about to head out and save 'em," Tony replied to Thor's question, sitting up from the wall and stepping over to Clint. He patted the blonde's shoulder. "Except we have an evil—"
“What? No way! I wouldn’t bring a weapon to a romantic camping getaway! No way!” He kept laughing as he used his foot to push a large black duffel bag behind the edge of their tent.
The pizza box caught Clint's eye but then he looked at his hand. He didn't get up, just sitting there crossed legged to stare at the tracking bracelet. It was what was beeping. He rotated it on his hand, looking for a button.
“WOW,” Clint managed, baffled both that he had been found out and that Cap managed to use a term like ‘G-rated.’
“This is a team building weekend, Hawkeye. You need to be present.”
“Oh, I’m fine. Just as blind as usual.”
Tony was listening to all of this with a thoughtful squint. Bringing a hand up to his mouth, he turned to Steve.
"It has to be around six by now!" Clint muttered, finally checking his cell phone. Without comment he shoved it away and leaned back again, pouting.
“Wouldn’t that just charge up your Arc reactor super high?” Peter raised an eyebrow. Tony blinked at him, then glanced down at his own chest.
"Five. ALMOST five," Bruce said tiredly. "...I think this is how the laundry feels when you forget to switch it to the dryer." He combed his hair out of his face with slightly numb fingers.
Cap chuckled.
"At least I can't get sick," Bruce answered rather miserably. He paused. "You can, though...y-you better soak in the bath when we get back..."
Tony leaned back against the wall, in no hurry to leave.
“Please god, let it NOT be a man in an animal suit,” Steve prayed aloud, pouring batter and scowling at the waffle iron. Spider-Man had some of the strangest villains Cap had seen--And that was saying something, with all of the bizarre opponents Hydra had dished out over the years.
Since the cabin was currently full of people, he made a U-turn and went right outside--and instantly got soaked, since it was still dumping rain out there. Dark, too, but the Arc reactor was like a built in headlight, so whatever. Maybe a little night walk would do him good.
"What was in that bomb?" He wheezed.
"I'm s-sorry big guy. I didn't do it on purpose," the blond told him honestly. He guessed even the Hulk liked a day off on occasion. They could all use one. "I won't try it again. Just, uh, go back to bed and I'll leave Bruce to his paperwork."
The frown on Cap’s face softened and he began to nod, fidgeting with the patties and condiments again.
"I'm alright Tony. I can t-take it from here."
"Your bandages...I-I'll fix it, Clint, don't move." He looked and sounded pretty exhausted; Loki was pretty sure he was leaning on the couch, not just hiding behind it.
"Jane and Thor haven't been close for months. He was away on Asgard and they drifted apart." It wasn't a complete lie. The big demigod had hinted at the same. Thinking better of it, Cap didn't sit on the table, though he did lean on it to stay on his feet.
As they made their way upstairs to Steve's bedroom, the blond did feel slightly pathetic. It was usually his job to haul people off to their room for bed rest—not the 'mere mortal' under his arm.
"It's nice," he said, and then grabbed Clint's arms as a wave did its best to wash them both off of their feet. "Sorry, sorry. Wow, I can't believe this."
"Pfft," Tony replied, brushing off the comment. "I can swim drunk--you saw me, I was swimming. Besides, I'm not drunk, I'm just a little bit buzzed." Sitting up, he swayed slightly and planted a hand on Cap's shoulder to steady himself, frowning. Swimming had been nice. Balance hadn't been an issue when floating in the water. "Is that all that brings you to my side of the beach, a PSA about drinking?"
Also standing nearby was Hawkeye. He was waving his hands and trying to calm the Hulk—which made no sense. The archer was lucky to be alive. Hawkeye wasn’t wearing his usual purple outfit, so maybe that was why he was trying the waving.
Peter shook his head and checked his watch. The train was late. At this rate it would've been quicker to just web-sling his way home and claim he'd missed Aunt May at the subway station, even though she was waiting there to meet him on his way home. It wasn't like he'd really been on a days-long field trip like he'd said, but Aunt May didn't need to know that.
Loki wrinkled his nose at Clint.
“Are you alright?” She asked him, delicately placing a hand on his shoulder as he stopped next to Peter.
“You've got a little...something in there.”
Nope, Peter wasn't feeling any better while looking over there. He turned back to Tony and mustered the biggest, saddest eyes he could manage without looking ridiculous.
Cap had to wonder, too. All of these powerful people with grudge matches were as frustrating as they were dangerous. It was kind of scary to think that Tony could have been like them if he didn't have SOME sort of conscience and desire to help people in trouble.
"I hate to tell you this, Cap, but Peter's already been with this guy unattended for who knows how long back home," Tony said bitterly back. "You wanna pretend we're a couple, can you start with standing still and pretending to listen to me for a second?" Wow, that sounded a lot more bitter than he'd intended. Too late now.
Peter half-turned, linking arms with him. He felt a little guilty for not asking if the guy still needed help getting around—since Matt had his walking stick now, Peter had guessed he might not want to make a big deal of it. The storm was really messing with him, though, it seemed.
“Shh, bugs,” Wade said dramatically, cupping a hand to his ear. “I think I hear the sad gargling of that ghost guy!”
"So, uh, Wade. You mentioned talking to MJ about where I went," Peter began awkwardly. "I hope you didn't freak her out that I was actually missing or something. We're not a couple anymore, but it's not like she hates me or anything."
Tony shook his hand, now glad for his dark shades because they might make him more intimidating.
Well. There it was. Underlined, even.
Apparently having Captain America at full strength wasn't much of a threat to Doctor Doom, at least not by himself. It did open up more options for Steve to try and escape, though...
"Aye!" Thor acknowledged just before another deafening roll of thunder drowned him out.
"I'm gettin' my bike." Wolverine slapped a hand over the merc’s face and shoved him off.
He dumped a blob of sunscreen into his palm and dabbed a bit on his friend’s nose, frowning to himself.
The train creaked to a halt and people began to slowly unload.
"Then you had better start to cooperate," Doom said, hovering his metal fingers (gloves? It was kind of confusing, he never took them off...) over Clint's midsection far too close for comfort. "Tell me everything you know about the Asgardian—the so-called 'god', Thor—or you shall be submitted to the touch of DOOM!"
“I’m sorry, Tony,” he told the dark haired man, drawing him in for a kiss. “Really, I’m sorry this is going so poorly. We could just tell everyone and be done with it. I’m sure once the Hulk destroys the camp, we can convince everyone to go home,” he joked, smiling for Tony’s benefit.
Wade looked down at the arrow, blue eyes impossibly wide.
“Oh? Which one?”
"...I could stand to get up and move around awhile, though," Bruce allowed, seeing that the blond man was restless. "Maybe we could watch some TV or cook or something." Not exactly thrilling pastimes...but, then, Bruce tried to avoid thrills and anything else that upped the heart rate.
Cap's comments drifted to mind again, and Tony scowled at the sauce like it had summoned them.
Loki was among them, covering a yawn behind a hand as he was handed a giant latte.
“Well,” he ventured slowly. “We’re not near a bunch of computers or bad guys, so maybe they’ll work their issues out on their own.”
Peter held up his hands quickly.
"I'll try not to stab it clean through your arm like your face says you're worrying I will."
Lightning arced out of the sky and struck the hammer, producing a brilliant burst of golden light.
The card blinked for a little while. Finally, after a good three minutes of waiting, Tony replied.
“What, while I wait here? I don’t think so,” Tony declared, resting a hand on his back. He sighed. “I know from experience, Cap, Thor’s gonna see them first anyway from the air. I knew I should’ve brought a suit, just in case…” He didn’t sound like he actually wanted to hop in the Iron Man armor for once, though.
"You're nuts," Peter grumbled, climbing onto the roof of the building Wade was webbed to and hauling him up by web-strings as well. He did have to reach and grab the man's wrists to pull him over the edge at the end—the angle was just bad for something like web.
“Oh, no,” the woman told him lightly, shaking off the blanket she had thrown over her lounge chair. Lola had tossed a lacy gold cover up over her bikini and had taken her hair down, leaving it to cascade in dark curls over her shoulders as she jammed the blanket into the top of the tote. Clutching the bag to herself, she turned and gave him a tight smile. “I’d hate to be in the way of the frisbee game. I don’t like it when people throw things at me.”
“Uh…yeah.”
Peter looked over from where he was buttoning up the last few buttons on Wade’s new shirt—gray plaid flannel that was definitely Thor-sized. The kid looked worried for Clint, too. What the hell? He’d fought so many overpowered psycho villains that they should’ve given him just a LITTLE more credit for being tough enough to handle basic day-to-day injuries like cracked ribs and a stitched up gash here or there.
"He probably went back down to the basement to check on Tony," the strapped down man added. "I think he said something like that."
Steve had half a mind to march back across the lake and confront Loki about it. Bruce could handle himself, and Peter was strong, too, but versus Loki? A man with all the possibilities of magic at his fingertips?
Clint also seemed to catch onto the awkward vibe and pulled his hand away quickly.
“I’d love some,” Matt said, sounding a bit distracted when he turned his head in Tony’s direction. After a moment, he faced the fire instead.
“Uh, about that,” Peter said sheepishly. Jeez, they really were getting along better now, especially for guys who had just been through a ridiculous storm and barely made it back to shore in one piece! Peter hadn’t actually intended for the plan to get to the kayak race before everybody fessed up.
"Nothing of value, it seems," the Jotun said huffily to his brother. But he didn't shrink away from Thor's hand. To Tony's amazement, he actually trailed his fingertips along the back of Thor's hand hazily, like he was deep in thought about something.
“Banner did this?” Thor looked like he wouldn’t have believed what he was hearing if not for who was saying it. He placed a big hand on Steve’s shoulder, shaking his head. “He seemed so very calm and resigned when I spoke to him yesterday… I would gladly keep watch as long as you need me to. Take care, Captain—if he is already out of sorts…” He gave Steve a knowing look, sighing and stepping back. “I shall delay you no longer.”
"He fixed the power and has to stay there—that has to be the basement like Clint's saying."
"Really?" Tony gave him an incredulous look. "C'mon, Peter's a smart kid, you have to give him more credit than that, Cap. If Deadpool is a troublemaker and hurts people, there's no way Peter would be mixed up with him. Besides, didn't Wade say his only superpower was 'eating his body weight in tacos'?"
“You wouldn’t be intruding at all. The mansion is plenty big enough for you to visit,” Cap commented in passing, ducking back into the cabin.
“Never been with a guy before,” he ventured, keeping his eyes fixed on a particularly ugly clump of moss in a tree. It kind of looked like a melted face.
Staring at it, Peter shifted awkwardly from one foot to the other. T’challa had mentioned Lola was here and everything, but what else could he do? If the storm got much worse, Cap and Tony might get washed out to sea, here.
Tony groaned and sat up straight.
Seeing the bright smile from Spidey had made Cap smile, too. Peter seemed to exaggerate his expressions a bit, probably from wearing a mask all the time.
Tony raised an eyebrow and stepped inside, closing the door after him.
"So, he likes you too? Great. There goes my trump card." The Jotun pouted, staring off at the medical briefcase instead.
The redhead stared his way for a moment, smile fading a bit.
Doom turned and walked back over to the table. Of all the things Cap expected, having a glass of water pressed into his hand wasn't one of them.
"His pulse is rapid—he’s lost a lot of blood, but I don't think he'll need a transfusion, at least. You probably feel pretty light-headed, right?"
Oh, right, Wade.
“Fear not, we will find him,” Thor reassured them all, raising his hand for Mjolnir. “Banner, perhaps you should put on warmer clothing before venturing out again.”
“Peter, you’re too young to drink,” Cap told him firmly, but answered with a shake of his head. Eyes landing back on Tony, the captain got lost in his thoughts, expression frozen in a frown. Slowly, very seriously, he looked back at Peter and whispered to him. “Have you ever been in love before, Peter?”
“Us,” he breathed, unsure if Tony could hear him or not. Never in his life had Captain America had trouble thinking of what to say in an important moment.
Glancing to make sure that Bruce was still skipping stones, he lowered his voice.
"Hello, friends!" The demigod boomed, waving at them happily before wrapping his arm around the woman's slim waist. "It is good to see someone enjoying themselves in this glorious place. Midgard truly is full of beauty and wonders."
T’Challa had been in plain sight all day and had slept in the other cabin. He had no involvement with the box and would probably open it, investigate it, and put it back if he found it.
“Even he had to admit that it looked bad, Steve. I could buy Bruce happening to be around Peter’s camp when he Hulked out, but what about Matt’s cane and glasses? What about Thor saying Bruce was in a bad mood yesterday? How about the dozen trees knocked over up the hill? Come on, all of that adds up to an ugly picture!”
“Er, it can cause stomach aches for most people. We should wait a half hour,” Steve explained, wishing with all his heart that he could just step in and kiss Tony whenever he wanted to without alarming everyone.
"You're the one who said 'steak'," Peter shot back, shrugging his shoulders. He hopped off of the wall down onto a dumpster top and then to the ground, looking up at the building. It was just across the street from them now.
"Dr. Banner says he goes through shirts so fast he buys whatever's cheapest from the thrift store," Peter explained, shrugging. "I'm kind of glad this one's not gonna get ripped up--it looks like something Wa--uh, s-somebody I know would wear." He plastered on a slightly too-enthusiastic grin and added, "I'm gonna go check out the beach now," before dashing off.
It was sort of fun to sit and people watch at coffee shops, or to date hopeless men and women. Loki had even stooped so low as to play cupid after he had dated both sexes and found a few that seemed to match.
“Let’s talk.”
"Wait. That stuff was made to work on super soldiers, right? Maybe it has some kind of residual effect," Carol offered. "Or he's a robot," she added, shrugging.
"I'm on my way down to the basement," Bruce said carefully. "I told Tony to unplug from the power, so that's why the lights are out. You don't have an arrow for that, do you?"
"You think? He acted like he saw us making out right in front of him." He paused, wanting to say more. To ask what things would be different if they really were together, what Steve thought was missing, here. Instead, he turned and pulled the bag of hamburger buns out of the cabinet, starting past Cap and down the kitchen hallway. "We...should probably get back out there."
"Stark!" Thor abandoned his phone call and hurried over. "How is the Captain?"
"If Peter's able to trust us, that says a lot to him, I guess," Tony replied softly back. There was no hope of hiding the conversation from Matt, but Peter and Wade probably wouldn't hear.
Rather than offering any particularly alarmed reaction, Bruce just brought a hand up to his cheek and opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again. He took a few steps back down the hall just as the elevator cheerily dinged to announce its arrival.
"Yes," Loki replied softly. Taking Hawkeye’s hand, he smirked as the archer looked uncomfortable, but too guilty to not accept.
Hawkeye followed, raising an eyebrow. Maybe Hulk and Bruce didn't share memories after all...
Bruce sighed and stood, dusting donut crumbs off of his hands.
Peter stared at him, processing that. Hawkeye. Hawkeye? ‘Smelled romance between you’ about him…and HAWKEYE?
Tony raised both hands and looked skyward in exasperation.
Noticing Cap, Peter turned sad brown eyes on him, but didn't exactly confirm that there was trouble. He actually looked kind of guilty, probably from the redhead suggesting HE was being the irresponsible person here.
“Hey,” Steve sounds serious again, “Fury’s not asking you to do this, is he?”
Tony grimaces at it.
His echo-location efforts were only a few degrees off, and he spots Steve at once, sitting on the living room floor (fully clothed) next to some kind of cardboard monstrosity. Steve has built this, clearly, it’s a mass of duct tape and wood pulp: old moving boxes left over from their last move,  and product-cartons that look like they’ve been brought up from the shop, all with holes in varying shapes and sizes hacked out of their sides. It’s strapped together into a shape that might slightly resemble a castle, if castles often listed dangerously to the right and sagged in the middle. It’s even got ramparts, in places.
he would’ve picked someone with some chance of returning his affections. Steve. Sweet, gorgeous, careful, soft-hearted hard-headed Steve, with his dog and his biceps and his eyes and his pancakes, was without a doubt the straightest person Tony had ever met. Tony was making his peace with that, gradually. It would take time to teach his heart (and his dick) to let go of the idea, but there was nothing to be done. You couldn’t just make people change, and he’d never want to change a single thing about Steve anyway, even if that meant Steve would never want him.
appears with permission from the illustrious
“...oh,” Tony froze for a moment, and seemed to shrink in on himself a little. “I didn’t...I mean, I don’t know. She’s yours.”
Clint nodded, cringing.
“...wow,” Tony said softly. By the huskiness of his tone, Steve judged it must’ve been option two.
“David.”
“I did say, and I meant it,” Clint assured him lightly. A sudden rush of air was all the warning Steve got before Clint had flopped out on the floor next to him with surprisingly little impact. Clint mimicked his pose, chin on arms, and half-turned his face to Steve. “You called, I’m here, what’s the deal?”
“Well, he blinked at me.”
“Tony?” Steve tries. The cat looks up at him, and gives the same low, almost mournful mew. Steve reaches out a hand.“Hey, Tony. Are you Tony?”
as tight as Steve’s), and a sharp sport coat, open, over a printed t-shirt that had a picture of Steve’s shield on it (what).
Tony jabs out with a paw, frustrated, and hits the back button on Steve’s phone with great prejudice.
“I’d ask if you can keep a secret, but I know I don’t have to,” the young (young?) man said softly, eyes on his tea. “I know I overstepped, getting the blanket without asking, but I couldn’t have asked without explaining, and, well, I was really hoping Tony would be the first one to find out.”
come when called.”
“Not Frodo,” Bucky observes, based on that evidence.
Penny failed to appear in the kitchen.
But what Steve learns, which interests him very much, is that
“She is.”
Tony laughed, but Penny tilted her head all the way back to stare up at Steve with the aggrieved gaze of a very good girl who had been wearing her OUTSIDE gear for some time now and yet was still, despite all logic, inside. Steve smiled at her and ruffled her ears. He picked up the end of her leash and she began to wag furiously, ears pricking forward.
There’s a pattern.
“No!”
about viral videos. He knows that sometimes they have sequels, and very rarely they are the start of something long and consistently successful, but most often it’s just the one video that gets a lot of attention, and then the person or people responsible are unlikely to be heard from again on any large scale.
Resigned acceptance has only just begun to take shape on Steve’s face, when it is suddenly replaced by panic. “Tony, no!” he shouts, and leaps up so suddenly that Tony, startled, flinches and dunks most of his face in the mug of hot, black coffee that Bucky had unwisely left behind.
With Thor, Tony hadn’t quite known where to start, but they’d somehow found their way to an arcade, a go-kart track, and eventually, an ice-cream parlor that served old-fashioned hard ice cream in scoops the size of volleyballs. One of the more harrowing days Tony’d lived through without the suit in recent years, but worth it.
“Clint is going to see his boyfriend this weekend,” Steve said slowly, “He said you knew that.”
Tony lurched awake, struggling to draw breath past the familiar fingers of clammy fear. The sheets were twisted around him, drenched in sweat. Details of the dream were fading fast, and already he was unsure of whether it’d been the darkness of space or of the cave that he’d been so desperate to escape. He struggled free of the sheets until he could sit up, and scrubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands.
The three of them boarded the elevator. About halfway down, Tony wrinkled his nose and turned toward Steve with one eyebrow up.
planning to wait for someone to come to the door. He lives here, dammit. Four days ought to be enough time that he can reasonably expect all persons in attendance to have their pants on, especially if they’ve been warned, and he’s doing his best.
Tony whistled lowly. “Damn, you’re into the ice years already. I’ll have to step up my game.”
, what the fuck--”
He’d been so nervous, but so
jump. He just hasn’t had a lot of practice, yet, and Steve has witnessed what practice he’s had, and Tony will grant him that it’s been quite a spectacle so far, but his judgy eyebrows are nonetheless very hurtful.
For now, he could bask in the pining, just a little, and enjoy the view, just a little.
“Steve, meet Tony,” he announces, smug. Steve’s jaw is hanging open. Tony yells again. “I take it back, apparently some cats
Clint laughed, a sudden short bark that startled Penny out of her seemingly permanent stupor just long enough to wuff sleepily at them before snuggling back down.
“Are you okay?” he settled for eventually.
“Pretty sure you control whether or not you bring one into the house, Stevie.”
Tony turned on his heel and strode out without waiting for any kind of reply.
So he posts it to Youtube, naturally.
“Both,” Steve grinned back.
Tony takes his first opportunity to hop up onto the table, because Steve is moving too much to sit on now, and he’s probably not going to hold his phone where Tony can see it anymore. He stations himself in the middle of the table, instead, sitting tall with his tail curled around his feet. At least he’s caused a distraction. That’s worth something.
“Only one, Cap, I promise,” Bruce swore, hand on his heart but a grin on his face. “I did start it, I had to participate.”
This was a gross underestimation of Tony’s genius.
“Don’t say mean things about my daddy!” Sarah-Marie piped gleefully and clearly by rote. “My daddy is the best daddy and I love him and Papa loves him and, and be nice!” She finished with a gap-toothed grin.
“Have you
Dangerous.
Jimmy rounds on him at once. “WHAT.”
Getting up to such hijinks with the rest of his team had been great in its own right, but more importantly, had led to his second realization: spending time with Steve had been
“Not on purpose,” Steve pointed out, turning around to lean backwards against the counter. “And it wasn’t really that bad. They didn’t seem to have any clear plan of what to do with us, so mostly it was just kind of dull.”
“What?”
“Tony.”
“Yes!” Steve can’t stop giggling, and Jimmy keeps wheeling around like he’s searching for answers, like he thinks he’s been had. “It’s true, I’ll prove it! Guys, roll the clip I gave you.”
He grins.
gay neighborhood,” he agreed with a smile.
“Yes,” Clint drew in a deep, fortifying breath. He started to speak a couple times before he apparently decided to rip off the band-aid and just blurted out: “It means homosexual now.”
“Tony Stark is missing?”
Then again, Tony had asked him out. On a real date. In public. With Tony.
Steve shrugged one shoulder. “It’s okay. It’s not your fault.”
They’re both cooing at him now, Bucky has backed off a few inches and there’s a general chorus of “aw, baby, it’s okay” but Tony’s back is up like a discount Halloween decoration and he Will Not Be Mollified, because that shit is
Tony vanished.
“I’m not in until eleven.” Steve is still in his pajamas, and his hair is all over the place, there are pillow wrinkles on his face and he’s the softest and most beautiful thing Tony has ever seen.
“...you’re not wrong, I guess,” Barton allowed after a second, his posture still wary.
Oh HELL no.
Before anyone could pull away from the table, though, Steve cleared his throat to get their attention.
“Not really,” Steve answers easily. Too easily, and Bucky clearly hears it.
“Puppy??” Tony breathed, aware that his face was doing unacceptable things, (big-eyed, enamored, devastated things) but unable to currently care.
or team
Steve was immediately making the face again.
Tony’s going to cut that thing off of him and burn it.
“What’s wrong now.”
“Oh, baby, talk anatomy to me,” Tony drawled, smiling lasciviously. He settled back against the park bench and started peeling the paper back from his own sandwich. “And anyway, who expects a ten-pound dog to be able to generate that kind of force from a standing stop?”
Because Tony
“Sanderson is a shitbird,” Bucky agrees heartilly. “The people who work for him and don’t need to end up like me, they’re worth it.”
“Tony? What did you do?”  Steve’s voice wavered between amusement and concern, drifting over from the other side of the workshop.
“Aw, you scared the baby away,” Steve mourns, looking after him with sad puppy eyes.
“Well, we
Steve had been perfectly happy to keep his dog to himself. Steve was proving much less happy to keep his gay to himself.
Tony holds up a finger in a wait-and-see gesture, grinning deviously. “They didn’t believe it was your channel. But what they do believe is that you’re
crossover.
“Yes.”
“Edwin Jarvis,” Jarvis offered, somewhat unnecessarily, returning the handshake. There was strength behind that man’s grip, but the Captain--Steve?--apparently felt no need to use it on him.
The panoramic views were one of the tower’s best features, after all. Nearly every room had one. Tony was used to seeing his city laid out at his feet. Every day. From one floor higher, even.
The most striking part of all of it, though, was Tony.
“Days?! Steph, no, hippogriff, you can’t do this, I’m in the French countryside with five small fluffy Avengers, you can’t leave me like this.”
Clint, looking faintly amused out the corner of Steve’s eye, copied along, turning his own attention to the furry sphere tucked back into the deepest shadows. “She appears to be sleeping.”
“Good god, that was a lot,” Tony muttered, almost inaudible but for Steve’s enhanced hearing. He glanced down suddenly, seeming surprised to notice the dog in his arms. “And where did you come from, madam?” he asked, bemused. He brought up a hand to stroke her neck and she rewarded him with a doggy smile, mouth open and panting. “Yes, I see, you smelled someone who needed a hug, very well done. You’re a good kid, Charlie Brown. However, you are also most definitely playing hooky and absolutely ruining your father’s plans for the day, he’s probably looking everywhere for--oh.”
Steve was holding a puppy. Steve had a
The ending scene where the little screen just flashes “TILT” over and over again as sparks fly out of it is a little fake, but it’s not done in post. It’s a fake FitBit that Tony whipped up, rigged to display whatever Steve wants and appear to short itself out on command. Steve puts “practical effects by Tony Stark” in the video description.
“Was that so bad, old man?” Bucky teased, slinging an arm around his shoulders.
Tony had used to make him feel so safe, so
, mister!” Steve shouted back into the room, scrambling to his feet, breathless with laughter and answering Tony’s challenging grin with one of his own. “No more home-field advantage for you! You want me, come and get me with everybody else!”
“Tony,” he breaks in, “Have you watched any of these videos?”
, but even thinking it made him feel like a five-year-old. He almost considered actually explaining why he was feeling so shitty, but dismissed the thought before it was more than half-formed. “You and I are not currently the kind of friends who have that conversation,” he settled for.
Once Nat had been brought back to the plane he gathered everyone’s scattered gear, his suit included, and took a hard-earned nap while FRIDAY flew them back.
The day they’d brought Penny home, reactions had been mixed. There had been a common theme of surprise, some enthusiasm, some caution. Bruce had seemed lukewarm but in favor, Thor had been as enthused as ever but quickly reigned himself in when cautioned to be gentle. Steve wasn’t too good at reading Natasha, yet, but she’d given Penny a considering once-over and then turned a pointed look toward Clint, who appeared to have gone all melted inside and promptly “volunteered as tribute” for any and all dog questions and situations. Tony had vanished the moment Steve’s back was turned.
“I...don’t think I have answers.”
. Steve blinked his surprise, watching her snap the thing right out of the air.
In the interest of not missing a week completely, here's about half of what would have been the last chapter. More next week-ish!
He’d done a pretty good job of avoiding being alone with Steve, over the course of almost an entire week, which was some truly record-breaking self denial on his part. Granted, the previous week or so, since Penny, had also been pretty light on the Steve-contact, but Steve hadn’t made him
“We’ve talked about this, bud,” Bucky says with mild reproach. Tony’s pretty sure they haven’t, actually, he hasn’t left Steve’s side since they saw that news broadcast and he hasn’t heard them mention it again. Steve doesn’t question it, though.
“What.”
While Tony had been playing Real Life Neko Atsume, his team had been held captive by literal dark wizards.
Is the worst.
His head was a wash of half-memories, of secret meetings and secret clubs, dark alleys and desperate sprints away from sirens, of pretty boys who sprinted down a different alley and never turned up again. Fear and smoldering anger at the one injustice he hadn’t dared to stand up against. The six hundred times he’d tried to work up the courage to tell Bucky, just so he’d have someone to talk to, and the five hundred ninety-nine times he’d decided it wasn’t worth the risk.
What a goddamn mess.
, the jarring clang of his toes skimming the tip of the tower and that split second of absolute certainty that he’d fucked it up and knocked himself off course.
“Well for one thing, I used to live here. Also, they’re being pretty obvious about it,” he gestured around at the decorations. “The, uh, rainbow flag, and the other ones,” he pointed specifically at the pink-and-red curtains. “It’s a pride thing.”
That smile got a bit more knowing. “The first time we spoke, I was sitting on top of the shelves, reading, and he came over to bother me. I wasn’t as nice as I could have been, I’m afraid, played a bit of a trick on him,” he paused to breathe, eyes far away. “I think I broke his poor heart right in half, that day. But he kept coming back. He still reached out to me, even knowing I was already dead.”
“I’ll put that on the to-do list,” Steve answered wryly, ignoring his own attempted chatter-control. “Right under--”
“Yep. Sure. I have definitely slept,” Tony groped for a mug in the cabinet, initially coming up with one emblazoned with Steve’s shield and then very studiously putting it back. “That is absolutely a thing I’ve done.”
“Penny’s nearly forty pounds.”
Natasha took the longest, though, because if Nat didn’t want to be caught, you were not going to catch her. In the end it took Tony lying motionless on his back in the grass with her tac suit draped over him for almost ten minutes to lure the little tortoiseshell ragdoll out of hiding.
“I am
Every room in this apartment is like a gothic cathedral, the table’s as high as a normal ceiling, Steve and his roommate are like
This table, though.
Tony shuddered so hard he nearly lost his footing, and took two staggering steps back from the windows. Away from the unthinkable what-ifs, from the cracked masonry and armies of cranes that whispered to him of blood and failure.
The video ends.
Tony slumped into the dining chair that Nat had left his coffee nearest to, and obediently tucked into the plate of breakfast that landed in front of him. Everything was excellent, as always, and there was far too much of it, as always, but they’d put him next to Thor this morning, which made it particularly easy to dispose of extra. With a little help, Tony managed to clean his plate by the time everyone else started to look done and ready to move on with the day. He still wouldn’t consider himself fully booted, but he’d probably crossed 50%. That was better than he used to ask of himself before operating power tools, so lab time was on the immediate horizon.
Steve knows what a viral video is. He’s familiar with the concept. He’s seen most of the classics, in fact. He can tell you with confidence the difference between the Charlie who bites fingers and the Charlie who is skeptical of magical leopluradons. Steve
for young Tony--not that it wouldn’t be even better if he’d hurry up and trust them with the truth about who was fighting beside them, but, there, that was an old argument, and one he certainly wasn’t going to win when the Master wasn’t even present.
Tony had been neck-deep in holograms when Steve had wandered in, and hadn’t seemed to even notice him. Steve, not wanting a repeat of the Doorway Incident, had kept his distance and quietly gone to visit Dum-E.
“How does that--” Steve began, before his brain caught up, arranging the thoughts
“Ow, ow ow ow, ow, fuck, ow--”
“Ah, let them cuddle,” Bucky suggested with a grin. “We can blackmail them about it later.”
Steve swallowed heavily. “Gay people.”
Pepper, calm down) and that means Steve is at home alone with the internet.
“...wouldn’t that hurt your foot?”
He was paralyzed, though, by confusion, at the fact that Tony appeared to have been doing his sobbing
Tony was sprawled out full length on the marble floor, clearly startled but already gathering himself up, with his right arm outstretched. His right arm, which was holding the leash leading to an equally-startled Penny. Penny, who was standing in front of the bank of windows (where a planter box currently hosting several pigeons was clearly visible), and who was looking back at Tony with an alarmed expression that plainly read:
That, finally, left only Steve and Bucky. Steve turned around to face his oldest friend with a rueful smile.
Strange sighed. “Okay. I really am busy, I don’t say that lightly, but I should be able to fix this. Just gather them up and keep them safe for a few days.”
Steve tumbled backwards, scrubbing mysterious wetness from his face with both hands only to find himself with two hands full of wet instead. He glimpsed Tony through squinted eyes, apparently trying to squirm out of his own skin while scrubbing his face with the hem of his t-shirt.
“I’m sure he’ll be fine,” Bucky lies, automatically. Either there are ransom demands ongoing, or the poor guy’s already at the bottom of the bay. Possibly both.
The thing was, even with all he’d done for Tony’s odd friends so far, this was, still, a very unusual load of laundry. A
Either something had gone terribly wrong, or the jeans were working.
“But you’ve had some time now,” Fallon continues, “And I’m wondering, first of all, if you’re familiar with YouTube?”
“--reported missing this morning by his close friend and CEO of Stark Industries, Virginia Rhodes,” the anchor is saying. “Mr. Stark was last seen at the Bridgeport offices of Stark Industries’ medical technologies branch, by his colleagues on the research and development team. We urge anyone with information about the whereabouts, movements or well-being of Mr. Stark to please reach out to the phone number or email address on your screens…”
“He’ll get used to it,” Bucky says flatly. He looks a bit guilty, though.
He woke to the disapproving face of Bucky Barnes leaning over him. Apparently the landing had been too smooth to wake him; or maybe he was just
“Fuuuuuck,” Tony breathed out, sounding utterly defeated. “I have to start all over now, apparently I didn’t even know what I was apologizing for, the first time. I’m so, so sorry, I didn’t mean to--”
Steve launches into one of his familiar rants, and Bucky knows he won’t really have to listen to know what it was about, later, so he doesn’t. He already knows how Steve feels about the guy. He’s got more important things to worry about right now, like how he’s going to change the subject to something less upsetting, without offending Steve and just driving him deeper into a fret about this. It’s not like they’re going to find Tony Stark themselves, so it’d be best not to let Steve dwell on it.
He cut himself off. He sounded a little choked up. Steve waited.
But, at the same time, Tony had gotten a good giggle out of the poptart thing, once his heart had quit racing, and Steve refusing to leave his side could never be counted as a problem. Having such a big part of the team so helpless in his care was humbling, too, and it felt good to be able to take care of them, after all they’d been through. He could see it was good for Bucky, too. For all the progress the man had made, being able and allowed to
, for years now he’s been showing me his favorite Cap comics and sitting next to me wrapped in a Cap-ghan and making grand speeches about how the Avengers are a good idea because ‘it’s what Captain America would do, I know it’ and I...” he held up his hands, helpless, gesturing vaguely at himself.
“That’s
Tony looked genuinely shocked for a moment, but then seemed to remember that this was what a joke looked like when Steve told it. He burst out laughing. “What happened?”
“Acceptable losses, Cap,” Tony fired back, a little slurred, but adamant. “The world needs you, and it can get by with one less asshole billionaire. There’s plenty where I came from, I’m only--”
*********************
“Okay, yes, I’ve seen that one, it’s not
“Oh, thank you, that’s very nice of you,” Tony had learned by now that trying to reclaim his fingers at this point would only net him a gentle but firm set of bitty pointy teeth latched onto his hand, which would not relent until he stopped trying to move away. “I
“Seemed like the thing to do,” Tony huffed, uncurling from around his abused ankle and running both hands through his hair, mussing it up, wiping away that last scrap of board-room-presentability that had snuck home with him. “I mean, you know how it is, sometimes you present a good idea, and sometimes you spend five hours trying to defend a garbage sidegrade to an unimportant susbsystem in a piece of consumer
“Any idea where Romanoff got off to?” Tony’s mouth said while his brain was still stuck on
For the first few hours, it had certainly seemed like Tony wasn’t planning to get involved. Steve hadn’t even seen him again between breakfast and lunch. After his own lunch, though, Steve had tossed some extra pasta salad, a hunk of chicken, and a bottle of water on a plate and headed for the main lab. Even if Tony wasn’t going to join in the (totally not Steve-approved and definitely improper) game, Steve still wanted to spend some time with his once-and-future friend on his day, if only to show that this was a bridge he was still interested in rebuilding.
Steve makes a face, which Bucky isn’t looking at because he’s trying to remember how to work the new smart-box-whatever that makes Netflix and Youtube play on their very un-smart television. “He’s got a family, Buck, he’s not here forever. I didn’t
They’re not.
It’s titled “Captain America Learns to Use a FitBit”, which has nothing to do with anything; it’s just a suggestion Steve had drawn from his inbox. One of many little gadgets his viewers want to see him try out. The video is mainly various clips of his wrist, each showing the display on the workout monitor after an activity, framed so that it’s obvious what he’s been doing. One next to a set of weights, one on a treadmill, one at the edge of a swimming pool, and so forth.
This does not happen.
you’re going away for the weekend with your boyfriend and the dog, you know.”
the hallway into the wall. He apologized for the unnecessary force, and made sure to check that Steve was all right before leaving, but still walked away calling “Two!” over his shoulder.
“She’s at least three years old, the vet said.”
Steve drew another long, steadying breath, remaining resolutely seated out of reach of the creature, very carefully not offering it the comfort it seemed to long for. He’d get attached, and it had a chip. This dog had a family, somewhere. Its hurts weren’t his to tend to.
, where did Steve get the saddest, floppiest pupper ever, oh
Tony smiled a little, brain functioning just enough to remind him to cover it behind a sip of coffee. That way any besotted sighs he let slip would be blamed on the beverage. His gaze drifted over to Steve, though, watching the play of his muscles under that damn tight t-shirt in a way that was probably terrible for Tony’s cover. Steve was still busy at the stove, turning pancakes and bacon and potatoes and sausage and eggs on the industrial-sized range with precision timing born of months of practice. People tended to start helping, once they’d had half a cup of coffee, but you had to be willing to take orders if you stepped into the Captain’s kitchen, so that ruled Tony out. Clint was already in there, actually, shoulder-to-shoulder with Steve and doing most of the potato upkeep (Steve kept checking them anyway, which led to a lot of low-grade bickering) and Tony gradually realized that Natasha had appeared as well, sometime when he wasn’t looking, and had taken over most of the meat detail. Steve didn’t seem quite as willing to bicker with her.
, Tony!" Steve burst out, "If you wanted to get your hands on my ass so bad, you could have just
I meant to get a lot more of this done before I started posting but I Do Not Have Patience, so here's the first bit! You get more whenever I finish writing more, i have no idea how long it will be. Let's find out!
“Uh, maybe, what day is it?” Tony grimaced and waved off the inevitable scolding. “Don’t answer, it doesn’t matter. Got things to do. Stuff to build. Money and machines, it’s what you keep me around for, all I’m good for anyway.”
Mind the new tags; I don't feel this is a particularly severe example of either of these things but I'd rather over-warn.
With that arranged, Jarvis was slightly at a loss, for the time being. Their newest guest had been situated in his new rooms, fed, and directed to some useful common areas, but Jarvis didn’t feel quite right retiring for the evening with a newcomer left idling about the place. It didn’t feel hospitable, somehow, especially when their guest was someone he knew the Master held in such high regard. For goodness’ sake, Tony’d been sleeping with an enormous crocheted afghan in the shape of the Captain’s shield since the boy was, what, six years old? Perhaps less? He’d stopped for a time, as young boys do when they feel the need to act less young, but once the Old Master had been gone a while, the blanket had quietly resurfaced, and Jarvis had carefully not mentioned it.
Somewhere on the other side of the room, Steve bursts out laughing.
Tony sighed into his coffee again, militantly keeping his eyes above the level of the apron string where it crossed Steve’s lower back. Openly ogling the man’s ass would be too much for even Bruce to miss.
“It is!”
It’s not fucking fair. He did what he was supposed to do. He found his person, he looked into their eyes. That’s how it works, most of the time. People who don’t have sight often bond at the sound of their person’s voice; nature finds a way. Everybody knows the story of Hellen Keller, unable to see, hear, or speak, but bonded at the first touch of her person’s hand as he attempted to greet her in the touch-language that she and her teacher had invented.
Tony had been there for Bruce’s unfortunate explanation at breakfast--bleary and scruffy and drowning himself in coffee as usual, but definitely present. He’d had an odd, conflicted expression on his face when Steve had scanned the room as the team was realizing what Bruce had unwittingly suggested. Tony was never what Steve would call an open book, but it tended to be a little easier to get a glimpse at a page when his caffeine reserves were low, and as muddled and complex as the emotions he was showing looked to be, Steve had been pretty sure he recognized them. Tony wasn’t the only one who sometimes felt a bit off-balance when an opportunity came up to be, well, silly again.
“Well, firstly because it was incredibly classified,” he started, “I’m not sure what I thought could possibly come of it at that point, but treason is treason. And then, I guess, it would’ve been awfully mean, wouldn’t it? Assuming he believed me, I’d just be adding more awful things to the situation. ‘Hey Tony, know how your soulmate’s dead and trapped in a library and can’t touch you? Well, he’s also your favorite superhero! Who’s dead and trapped in a library and can’t touch you! Forever!’“
“Have fun!” Steve called after him. Once the elevator doors closed, he let all the air out of his lungs in one huge sigh and allowed himself to slump back against the kitchen island.
“I’m here for movie night, nobody tells me anything,” Rhodey complained, wide-eyed and absently scratching Clint’s ears. “Why is this one wet?”
Steve’s voice was shaking by the end of his declaration, but, this time, Tony was smiling up at him with the exact sort of soft, gentle understanding that Steve had so desperately hoped for a week ago.
Tony does. It doesn’t take long. He looks up at Steve from behind the phone with an eyebrow raised, when it’s over.
It wasn’t the usual cold grip of fear in his chest, with fingers of dread clenching around his insides to steal his breath and send his heart into overdrive. That feeling was distant, more like the dread was resting a hand on his shoulder like an overly-familiar party guest who couldn’t take a hint. Like someone who couldn’t be bothered to save him from the swirl of guilt, jealousy, rejection, and loneliness he was drowning in.
with several thousand pounds of torque at a moment’s notice--until everyone had all their fingers and toes and IQ points back.
********
Still.
“Why do you want to yell at Natasha?” Clint asked flatly, “That’s usually considered suicide, by everybody who isn’t me.”
“Oof, wow,” Tony grimaced so hard Steve could hear it, without looking at him. “That obvious, huh?”
Tony’s coffee was snagged out of his slack grip. He whined sadly as Natasha stole away toward the table with it, wafting the mug at him as she went. Not the first time someone had used this tactic to move him from the kitchen bar to the dining table when breakfast was ready. He followed, not proud that such methods worked on him, but glad the team seemed willing to work with his sleepy-brain rather than leave him blinking at the wall until he got hungry enough to notice that they’d all finished and left hours ago.
The day of the interview arrives, and Steve can hardly contain himself long enough for Fallon to steer the conversation in the direction he’s been waiting for.
Steve had declined all press events to spend this day with his friends at home on the compound, but he was starting to regret it. Sam got him by calling an “on your left,” and then going in from the right. Nat got in three more before lunch. Steve gave himself half a complex dodging away from any object big enough to have a person hiding behind it, after the first four such pieces of cover he’d passed had concealed either Clint or Bucky lying in wait. FRIDAY had started keeping the tally, in order to coordinate between scattered teammates, and would slyly announce the new number after each hit landed.
“You’re not wrong,” Tony snorted, and tilted into Steve’s side without further preamble.
Steve nods along, trying to make the right face. The one that looks serious enough to acknowledge that they’ve mentioned something Not Funny, without removing the possibility of bringing the conversation back to a happier place.
There’s no warning, no precursor. Just, one day in his inbox, a very formal and clear “stop what you’re doing” from Stark Industries’ legal department.
Steve nods, accepting. They share a quiet moment while Bucky tries to send back a general sense of calm and reassurance to his person, but it doesn’t echo, so he’ll probably never know if they caught any. Well, he tried. It’s not like he can do much more than worry, until he’s met them, even if they’re having strong enough shitty feelings that the bond wants to share them with Bucky every few hours.
“Could’ve, and I just didn’t see them. What does it do?”
“For looking after him. For being someone he could count on, when I couldn’t even offer him a damn
Steve’s shield was face-down on the ground, and the shallow bowl it formed was filled halfway to the brim with orange and white fur, as if the cat had been poured in. Tony knelt down and cautiously poked at it. The cat’s head reared up at once, silent but clearly affronted.
It’s not just that the viewers don’t know (and they don’t; it’s adorable, they go on for paragraphs sometimes praising his attention to detail and lauding the little ways his “character” is “subtly different from the real Cap”). It’s that
“No,” Steve said flatly, propping an elbow on his knee and resting his chin in his hand. “Maybe before, but...I don’t think he likes dogs. He stopped coming around to see me after Penny moved in. And.”
“Big kitty,” Tony commented, beginning the walk back to the jet. Steve wasn’t too abnormally huge, by cat standards, as far as Tony knew, but he was nearly two of Clint, lanky and leggy and with what seemed like about a mile of tail. His fur was white all over except for the aforementioned “cowl” of orange that covered his ears and the top of his head down to his eyes, plus two large orange splotches on his back and an orange tail striped with white bands.
“He?” Steve prompts. Shit, this is already going off the rails.
He twitched the covers back and twisted awkwardly, peering down to find his soldier’s face innocent and slack with sleep. And yet, Steve clung to him like a limpet, sighing out a surprisingly intelligible “Don’ talk mean about my boyfriend, I love’m,” before resuming his usual quiet snoring.
“Now come on, stick around, take a break with us. Clint made waffles.”
Penny seemed unconcerned with talk of her age and/or weight; her entire focus was on Tony’s sandwich. She was staring at his ham-on-rye like she thought if she hoped hard enough, it might magically fly into her mouth. Tony smiled at her, ruffled her ears, sat up and turned back to Steve.
"Hmm." Thor swooped them down further, then flew slowly along near the treetops. "Perhaps if we signal, he will come to us." He glanced up at Mjolnir.
"Stark. Who are you to criticize our intimacy while you yourself hang off of your fellow teammate? Are YOU under a 'god of mischief' type spell?" Loki had been on earth a lot it seemed, because he knew how to use air quotes now.
Pepper's sympathetic look told him she didn't believe him. That, and it was a little difficult to explain why he had those strap marks on his wrists. Who'd believe he really got strapped half-naked to an observation table and only got talked to?
Giving him a dull stare, Clint shook his head.
Tony crossed his arms and snapped the mask of his suit down, scanning the both of them.
"Perhaps you could order your home to lock us ALL in, together."
"Probably never put it on when getting dressed yesterday."
Bruce looked up from the soggy ground to that intent stare, opened his mouth to speak, then shut it again. What could he possibly say, here? 'You're making my heart pound'? Because that wouldn't sound odd at all...
"The other night Bruce talked to you the same time Clint was talking to me," he pointed out to Steve. "What did HE tell you about him and Clint? Because I'm pretty sure Clint was making up half of what he told me that night. Not sure why, but he was pretty keen on dosing me up with tequila, too." He sat the spatula aside and stepped away from the counter, running a hand over his face before sighing and rubbing at his eyes. They still kind of stung. "I guess it doesn't really matter. They're adults. As long as the Hulk doesn't demolish this beach then I don't care what they do. It's not like they're Peter."
Tony walked close by his side, still trying to hold his hair out of his eyes.
The giant smirked and patted him on the head. Felt real enough.
“Jeez, I’m standing right here,” he sighed. His image wasn’t THAT bad… Okay, maybe in Manhattan, but people in Queens knew what was up. At least, he was pretty sure they did.
Matt frowned at the sound of Tony’s voice. Blowing out a breath, he got to his feet and turned toward the two men, casually offering Peter a hand up.
"Just wanted to apologize. You know, for getting drunk last night and making you have to deal with me. And now I guess for shooting down your plan I didn't know I shot down."
Not that many superheroes got married or settled down. The few exceptions were just that—exceptions.
“To camp,” Thor supplied, not sounding like he believed it in the slightest. He turned to Steve regretfully, adding, “Forgive me for scolding you, Captain. I thought it better not to have any confrontations that come to blows so near to all of those mortals in the camp. This is very unlike Loki—he must have some scheme in mind to do such a thing.”
"...Yes, Tony's still in the basement," Bruce answered Cap's question finally, turning to face him. It was better not to think about the Clint situation at the moment.
"Oookay then." He pushed open the large gate and went outside, holding the gate for Bruce to pass through, but keeping his eyes on the ground.
Mostly just being able to feel his face. It was a good start.
"Do your worst, tin face." Loki twisted to look up at Hawkeye. "I knew you were the fake! You've been working with Doom the whole time!"
Peter watched the redhead walk into the cabin, then sighed and let his shoulders slump.
Coffee. Where was the damn coffee?
"Ooh, come here with that." Clint waved him over eagerly.
Deadpool was eating, perched on the top of Peter's house, legs slung over the edge casually. He had climbed up there while Spider-Man retrieved the bike—probably to stay out of range of Wolverine, who sat sulking below just around the corner of the house. "Hey, Spidey babe, you're on TV again. Aww man, Hulk was in town?"
"Uh, h-hey, need any help over here? Wade, maybe you could grab some more firewood."
“Yes please! I need you to help with the sauce,” Cap called casually, ducking around Peter and Wade like it was something he did every day.
Trying to reassure him with a smile, Cap followed him. God, hopefully it wasn’t actually about dating. That wasn’t something the super soldier was good at. If dating was the topic, he decided he’d politely direct Bruce around the bonfire to Tony.
Out of nowhere, Tony brought a hand up to catch and hold the blond’s. He looked like he wanted to say something, but remained quiet. Holding Cap's hand.
"He says whatever it is will be more fun than fishing," the scientist relayed with a sigh, brown eyes avoiding Clint's. He glanced over at the door like maybe he was planning to dash for it. "Usually he sleeps while I fish, but he can't sleep for a week, so he's not exactly broken up about leaving my tackle box behind."
“Heeeeeey,” Wade said, sticking a hand up to wave. Nice place ya got here! We got Hulked last night, so we moved down the hill and since it looks like you guys are already awake—I figure I’d let you know that I already made pancakes! Not city pancakes, though, CAMPFIRE pancakes with that authentic smoky flavor!”
“You did?” Steve asked, his face falling even more. “I hope it didn’t hurt you.”
"Tempting." The Frost Giant glanced down at his hand. "Why is it that you want Thor?"
The other Clint raised an eyebrow.
“I think I hit something.” Dr. Banner’s troubled voice came from below them, very close as well. Peering down at the ground, Peter saw his brown hair and Clint’s blond, both from the top. There was a small bit of red on the ground at Bruce’s feet. He gestured to it, adding, “Whatever it is, it’s injured.”
Peter shook his head. He figured it was none of his business if Loki and Thor were sneak-dating under the rest of the Avengers’ noses, but it was still kinda weird. They sure seemed sincere, though. That was weird, too, when one of them was a literal super villain. Whatever. Even super villains needed vacations and romance, apparently.
"Ursa Major," a familiar deep grumbly voice declared from off to his left.
"So how'd you two meet? You sure don't look like you go to his high school," he said pointedly to Wade.
"He's my something," he replied awkwardly. "But I can't call him my boyfriend or sweetheart or anything when I've never asked him to be. That's just weird."
“Give that to Bruce.”
Wade laughed nervously.
"That's...nice that you think so."
After last night, Clint really didn’t want to even LOOK at him. Rejection hurt, but somehow it hurt WAY worse when it was coming from the adorkable freckled physicist.
Tony gave him a carefully neutral look and took another swig of his drink.
“Are you two serious? I know I’m not around as myself much, but you know Hulk pretty well by now, and he’s put himself into harm’s way countless times to protect civilians. You don’t know me, but I’m around all the time in Hulk’s head, and I know you. I know you wouldn’t joke about something this serious. What in the world made you think I did this?”
"At least I'm doing something useful this way," Tony admitted, tossing the shoes aside and standing up. He offered Steve both of his hands. "C'mon, let's get you tucked in."
"Who's asking?"
Cap watched as Thor stepped over beside the medical table, leaning to examine Clint’s injury. "What happened...? I should never have let you leave my sight."
“Avengers, assemble.”
"I-I wouldn't drag you around while you're hurt unless it was important," he mumbled.
“Please believe me when I say this,” he told the Avengers co-leaders grimly. “I didn’t deliberately do anything to hurt anyone. I’ve done enough damage for several lifetimes already, okay? Every minute of every day, I have to be careful so that nobody gets hurt. I’m doing it right now.”
For all the effort Steve went through asking Bruce to stay himself, it seemed like the scientist didn’t care. He must really have a problem with Peter and his…friends.
With a heavy sigh, Tony relented and pushed himself to his feet.
"ALRIGHT, FINE!"
It was pretty quiet over there in the sauce-making area. Too quiet...
"As if I would waste vibranium on mere restraints," Doom said in an 'are you stupid?' kind of way. "They are electromagnetic, and you cannot escape them."
"An arrow made of WHAT, exactly?" Tony's interest was clearly piqued.
"You're the one who woke me up," the Hulk noted, frowning at Hawkeye. "Banner's all quiet now. Hmph."
"Let me see it."
"He-ey, gorgeous! What's a carrot top babe like you doing in a storm like this?" The man said enthusiastically.
Blowing out a quick breath, Clint regained his composure and managed to look at Bruce.
“Honest to god, any trouble at all, Reed,” Steve said into the phone for the fifth time, blue eyes gazing sadly out the windshield of the SUV.
Peter had always figured Matt’s Radar Sense, as he called it, was a bit like his own Spider Sense going off all the time. Having that blaring from every side and from half a dozen things at once really would be overwhelming.
He could tell how well his puppy-eyed expression came across by how Thor seemed to mirror it back at him, looking at him with such big, sad eyes that he would have been compelled to some kind of sympathy...IF it hadn't been Thor.
Tony went to retrieve some spare blankets from the closet. "I bet Bruce's already cracked the code and he's making the cure right now," he commented. "When he's not all green, he's a huge nerd, really."
The scientist sighed wearily. "Unless somebody put it in the car when they put me in the car..."
“Maybe he’s one of those YouTube guys who makes bushcraft houses and livestreams it or something. I don’t know,” he said, shrugging. “All I know is that there’s no Spidey Sense tingling, so I’m not worried. We could go down to the lake and check it out, if that’ll make you feel better.” He hadn’t actually seen the lake yet since they’d arrived. When he’d offered to help Wade get firewood, he’d been hastily assured that his time was better spent making the campfire. Then making lunch. Then roasting marshmallows…
"This sort of works too." Clint grinned and pointed to the vest. "Too bad you aren't wearing one."
"Like hitting a wall would even faze you," Peter replied, a bit annoyed. "Did you know you smell like perfume?"
"D-don't, don't...!" Thor shouldn't have let Loki anywhere near him, he thought. He was probably tampering with the reactor to make it explode or something. At least that was kind of what it felt like.
He steeled himself, squaring his shoulders.
“Peter takes extra explaining, actually,” Tony whispered to Steve. “Like telling him about the college fund we’ve got for him. Thank god we can save all that for later.”
"I always thought you meant the other thing, so no." Clint shrugged, following closely. "I thought about checking in but it'd just be..." After a long pause he shook his head. "Creepy."
Dropping his newspaper and coffee in the nearby trash can—never on the ground—Steve bolted across the street, pausing briefly to dodge one of the vulgar taxi cars. Covering his nose and mouth with the side of his coat, he ducked inside to check for survivors.
"—abundant Chinese food and a garment as Hawkeye has described," Thor concluded to Jarvis. To the two blonds in the cell, he added, "Iron Man is tending to Captain America. The vile Doctor Doom has put him through many horrors, and I am told he is quite unwell!" His heart ached for Cap as he said it.
"Little busy right now, hold please." And he hung up again.
"Hours—nearly a day later, and nothing?" Doom held out both hands in a sort of shrug. "Perhaps they value you no more than Thor does."
"Come on," Clint pleaded childishly, sliding closer to Bruce. "Just for a few hours. Then we can come back here and I'll help you with your stupid papers."
"I'm sick, he got me a pizza—what do you want?" Clint all but growled at Tony, rattling from the draft that came in the door.
Peter swung back into the room through the door, flinging over Bruce's head and sticking to the wall by the kitchen counter.
Why in the world would he WANT Peter to like this guy? Wade and Peter seemed to go together strangely well. Both of them seemed to follow Matt's lead on things, though. Why? Why was this guy so important to either of them?
Peter's spider sense tingled seconds before something human shaped and on fire slammed right into him as he rounded a corner.
"Um...What, no mean green guy?"
“Matt, I’m really surprised to see you here after I mentioned the Avengers camping nearby on the phone. I-I mean, I’m happy to see you, I just… Didn’t Cap and Tony recognize you?”
"Hello," Peter said to himself, blinking and shading his eyes as he looked up. It made sense for Thor to be out in this storm—he was a thunder god and all that—but who was he rescuing? Why no other Avengers?
“After coffee, we should head down to the lake.”
Oh, boy, here they went.
“I think that’s a bad idea,” Clint told him, propping himself up on a rock and crossing his arms. “If people think we’re gay now…” He shook his head.
“Oh god,” he muttered, looking around at the dimly lit trees and sparkling lake. “It wasn’t a nightmare.”
Tuning out Wade’s obnoxious voice and the weather, Clint frowned a bit as he listened to Peter talking.
Thor had just placed both big hands on Loki's shoulders when he realized what Hawkeye had said.
The Human Torch came over to Bruce.
Bruce gripped his chin and turned his face carefully, examining the bleeding side.
"Then we're d-down to the device that helps him take over the w-world." Steve coughed hard, laying his head back against the wall.
"I'm not so sure that's a good idea," Peter said, frowning after the two as they walked off. He turned to Cap, looking at him sadly. "I'm sorry I told you I had a boyfriend when I don't yet. It's one reason I never really mentioned liking guys; I know it should still be valid to say I swing both ways even if I've only dated girls, but I feel like an impostor." He sighed, glancing the way Wade and Tony had gone. No screams or laser beams coming from over there yet.
"Well, technically sh-she's my assistant...so that's her job. What's your excuse?"
Anyway, Cap is trying to be tactful here and not use much more derogatory terms in a 1940s sense, such as "homosexual". Just know that we took that word usage into consideration while writing, and decided this would be in-character for him. It's Cap, he's not calling anybody a slur on purpose--I think that's about the least Captain America thing he could do.
"Have fun storming the castle." She waved after him, bummed at having to sit out the fight.
The blond knocked twice, paused, knocked once, paused again and then knocked four times. The door opened instantly and Ms. Marvel hung her head out.
He looked at Steve curiously. He'd just almost said ‘queer’. Well, he WAS from the 1940s. Whenever Tony thought about that too much, he always realized his high-tech ways must seem like science-fiction to Steve.
As far as he could tell from the skyline, there weren't any buildings being destroyed. Yet. But there was a steady flow of screaming, kicking, punching and panicking crowds running down one street. Odds were that the Hulk was nearby.
Hesitating, Cap frowned at Tony.
"He should be in bed."
A glowing street sign a block ahead of them caught his eye. It read in large, simple text, 'SANDWICH.' Not sandwiches, but a singular sandwich. Clint's eyes lit up at the sight and he sped up to Bruce's side.
It was the annoying blond guy.
Peter thought. They were going to have to be quick.
"Bon voyage!" He called, trying not to sound as eager as he was to get them paddling away already. They needed this. If they could just have one honest conversation they couldn't run away from or distract themselves from, his 'dads' might return a real couple. What a thought.
With a shriek of rage, the enchantress turned on Loki again—lifting him up by the shirt. Blasting a huge hole in the wall, she jumped outside.
Loki leaned back against the couch, feeling heavy. The antics were entertaining, but he needed to rest his eyes.
Thor turned to Steve curiously.
Somehow, 'lady I just met on the beach wants to have a summer fling with him' seemed like a strange explanation. Peter decided to try and stay a little vague, shrugging and being casual about it.
Knowing anything about Daredevil told Clint that the redhead was probably listening in on all the conversations around the campsite, Tony included.
"With the way you talk about fishing, I must bore you to death."
"Curing Cap's important, yeah," he said idly. Perhaps they would run into his brother and that other Hawkeye along the way to the cure. "So, uh. Where do you think that OTHER me is?"
“It is done!”
"Hey, I think our flag delivery got delayed," Tony joked from down the stairs. Peter glanced back at him and waved with a slightly too-large smile.
Shoving the various items back into the first aid kit without really looking at them, Bruce nodded quickly.
"Geez, stop dragging your feet—I meant outside of the ROOM. How long has it been since you slept?" Clint led the way through the hall, hands tucked casually in his pockets.
"I couldn't tell you that," Bruce sighed. He noticed Clint inching toward him, but didn't move. "I don't think he's that angry with you—or he would've gone for you instead of the scenery both times."
“I apologize,” Steve told them both sincerely, all of his sternness melting away. “I know this is very unprofessional and--and it really isn’t any of my business. I’m sorry, you’re right. Of course you’re being careful,” Cap added to Bruce, shoulders slumping. “You have every right to be here and enjoy your vacation. I’m..sorry I bothered you.”
"Then how a-are we going to get everyone in one place?" Looming or not, Bruce still qualified as a mad scientist. Because...he was angry all the time. The blond repressed a tired laugh. He had been around Tony too much.
Hawkeye was talking under his breath too, but it was mostly just cussing.
"Huh? I'm confused," Peter said, tilting his head.
“No,” Cap sighed, looking over at Bruce. “It’s not that.” The captain struggled to come up with words for a moment, then he shook his head and braced himself on the door frame with a hand. “…I heard you two are together.”
"I…what?"
"Where's the Hulk? You didn't send him somewhere alone, did you?" She asked, almost scolding.
"Steve?" Tony sounded sort of surprised to be hearing him. "Hey, you don't sound so good. Don't worry, I'm on my way back after this last scan."
Meanwhile, Bruce gratefully wrapped the towel around his waist and tied it.
The first Avenger paused. It was Bruce. He came around the corner slowly, so as not to startle the scientist.
"Easy!" Tony patted his back. Popping the face mask on his armor open at last, he looked at the blonde with obvious worry. "It's my house, I can figure out why the backups aren't working and get 'em doing their jobs in no time. Okay? 'Til then, you can't push it too hard."
Clint stared down at his feet, a look of guilt on his face. Ms. Marvel stood nearby to keep an eye on him, in case he did turn out to be some kind of robot or clone, as she previously stated.
As they drew closer to the shore, the water seemed to be getting darker. A huge shadow passed below them slowly, long neck extended in front of it.
"Wow, as an Avenger you'd better hope nobody learns your secret weakness--tiny fish hooks," he joked. "In all seriousness, maybe I'd better take a look. That's bleeding a lot." Without waiting for Clint to comment, he gripped the blond's wrist and pulled his finger out of his mouth, maneuvering the hand over to examine Clint's finger. It had promptly started bleeding again. Bruce frowned and gripped his finger, squeezing it to add pressure.
“They know, why keep that form—I am certain they would dearly LOVE to watch you die!” He braced a boot on the injured man's chest. “But I suppose there is no need to hide my form either. That...metal golem of a man has failed us both now—but I will still have Thor!”
“Don’t try to lie to me, Parker. Odin’s filthy beard! You’re dating THAT moron?” Loki jerked a thumb at the water, staring Peter down.
Loki dove off of the couch, half tripping on the blanket as he stood to face the door.
Bruce placed the medical supplies on the table beside Loki, then headed back across the room and got a glass of water from the sink there. He returned, pulling out some gauze and medical tape, ointment of some kind, antiseptic...and a bottle of pills.
“Just tell me the day when I can toast to your happiness, and I shall be there!”
T’challa chuckled, expertly pouring a cup of coffee for Matt and sitting it into his hand.
"Nice! I only got to see the living room. You know, for poker night. This is legit!"
"I'm okay...i-it's not like I've been poisoned or anything..."
"Okay, Hawkeye I get, but how'd he get the big guy to cooperate?" Tony chuckled, hovering down close to the shield. "Jarvis, activate the external speaker. A-hem. Hey, guys, hold up a second!"
"I-I'm not. Have you s-seen Miss Potts?" Steve slapped a wet hand over Thor's. The demigod’s hand felt warm compared to his own.
"In your present state, it's very fortunate that I can navigate for you if necessary, sir," the computer replied dryly. Pieces of red and gold armor were already flying at Tony from across the room. Thor wisely took a step back.
Clint could relate. He’d been cooped up in the damn medical ward for days at a time. It was painfully boring.
The blond scientist didn't seem hurt, but mention of the frisbee game made him fidget uncomfortably.
"Heeeey buddy," Deadpool, aka Wade Wilson, said cheerily. The crazy merc was in disguise—which meant he was still wearing his usual mask, only with a sleazy mustache and giant rimmed glasses over it. To complete his look, he had thrown on a long curly haired wig that went past his shoulders in an almost hobo-like fashion. "You wouldn't happen to have a spare wheel for a Harley in there," he said smoothly, sliding a hand inside Peter's jacket to check the interior pocket, "would ya?"
Bruce stood, his eyes sparking green.
That actually made him way more suspicious than some form of protest would have. Peter glanced behind him as he stepped off the train, looking for some glimpse of Deadpool's very conspicuous "disguise"—and missed the step, falling flat on his face on the loading platform outside.
"Mad? Nah. Not at him. At Hawkeye for getting me sloshed on tequila, yes."
“Camp my ass!”
Thor crossed his arms and watched this worriedly.
“Then you can sit on the shore.”
Clasping the handle of his bow on his back, Hawkeye carefully considered whether shooting Deadpool would be worth it. It wasn’t like the moron could die from it…
"That's just sad! It's not like it's hard," Clint laughed, nudging Bruce's shoulder. "Okay, next time we go on one of your fishing trips—I'll catch you a fish." Clint seemed surprisingly awake for so early in the morning.
"I doubt he'd have the energy to move." Clint cringed.
"Clint," Steve whispered hoarsely. He cringed at how bad he sounded. Whoever it was, they would most likely assume he was some kind of sewer freak—or maybe a super villain. With a sigh he tried again, but it came out even creepier. "Are you okay?"
"I'll help you pick it u—" Clint sneezed suddenly, grabbing the counter to keep from falling over. He sneezed again and then sighed. "I'll help. I'm pretty good with making piles of paper—you can thank Shield for that one."
Peter stepped over in front of the couch and put two stacked pizza boxes there, leaving space for Johnny to add the third one.
"Did you call for me, friend?" Thor hurried through the door and to Hawkeye's side, seeming quite concerned for him.
"Because he's—" Clint spun around to face Cap, but paused. "He's just evil!"
"Oh, Clint? One's all scratched up, the other's got a cold."
"Not again! Who closes on a weekend?" He groaned, rattling the door again.
"It's been a crazy weekend. You know what? I think we need coffee. Er." The blue eyed man stared up at Bruce, thinking it over. "Wait. Can you even drink coffee?"
Obviously disappointed at the lack of enthusiasm, Hawkeye tucked his bow onto his back and helped Cap along to the door.
Peter wiped sopping bangs out of his eyes and gave Matt an almost shy smile. Uh-oh, Tony thought.
“Welcome, friends.”
Which was going to happen anyway, if he was ever dating Peter. Though it might be mixed with implied threats, now that Cap knew exactly who he was dealing with.
The teen, whose upside-down on the ceiling thing looked really bizarre without the Spider-Man costume involved, jumped slightly and blinked down at Clint, squinting.
“I know you heard most of that call with Matt. I’m guessing one of the reasons you’re here is to report stuff like that to Cap and Tony, right?”
"So that's where you went."
"Too tight and I'll choke," Peter threatened, keeping his eyes set on the rooftop. Just a few more stories...
