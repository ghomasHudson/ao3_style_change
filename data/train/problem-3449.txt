Castiel didn’t reply. Maybe in a few months they could try. But he was definitely not going to spank Dean after he’d just confessed to having had an abusive father and boyfriend. Granted, he didn’t specify exactly what had happened, but Castiel would definitely not mess with Dean’s head like that. It would only be praise for the foreseeable future.
After Castiel had kicked the door closed, Dean emerged again, red faced. “Couldn’t find it,” he mumbled.
When he landed on a cartoon, Dean let out a gleeful sound. “Oh man, I love that stupid dog.” He pointed his fork at the TV, which was showing a Scooby Doo re-run. Castiel sat down his remote and kept watching Dean out of the corner of his eye, happy to find him obviously engrossed and enjoying the program.
“Yeah, I knew that,” Dean protested a little too quickly. “I just didn’t actually want to shoot anyone. Jesus.”
Castiel looked at him in surprise, apparently not expecting him to be able to sew. Or maybe not trusting Dean with his fabric. But after Dean made the first few stitches with one of the thorns and a fiber thread tied to it, Castiel nodded in satisfaction and let him work.
“Hello, Dean.” A familiar voice greets him and he turns around.
“Dammit, Sam.“ Dean glared at his brother. “I told you. No. Even I haven’t met him yet.”
“And abandon our one cash cow?” Meg snapped back. “Go fuck yourself, Clarence. Remember that I can always cry and say you coerced me. If we go down, you’re the one who ends up with life and I’ll get parole.”
It felt so good, the way Cas slowly split him open. Even more intense like that, because Dean was controlling it, was doing it to himself. He was impaling himself on Castiel’s big cock and fuck. He threw his head back and groaned, biting his lip so hard he tasted copper.
“That’s no problem at all,” Castiel reassured him, slowly letting him go, but not stepping too far away in case Dean needed to lean in again. He regarded him carefully and seemed to like what he saw, because he was nodding. “Please ask for what you need, Dean. I am here to give it to you.”
Castiel couldn’t help but smile. “Ok,” he repeated, stealing yet another kiss.
Feeling even more guilty, Castiel reached for the mug. “Dean…” He started, unable to look him in the eye. The unusual smell of the coffee distracted him though and he cocked his head, taking a careful sip. There was definitely a good helping of whiskey in it. He took a longer gulp and let it burn down his throat before meeting Dean’s eyes over the rim of the mug.
After Dean’s people realized they had started mining resources essential to the Ceruleans’ survival, and the Ceruleans had just defended themselves instead of randomly attacking, they were quick to agree to a ceasefire. Since both sides had suffered significant losses, though, a long-term peace treaty would probably still take a while. But it was a promising start.
“Dean, I’m leaving when you’re leaving.” Castiel crossed his arms in front of his chest and raised one eyebrow.
“I could go home?” Dean suggested.
Dean’s knees felt weak when they turned off the water and toweled off, but he had a grin on his face and the pain would be worth it. Besides, Castiel probably still had it a little worse. Not only did he spend some time on his knees before Dean pushed him up against the wall, but he also took quite a pounding. Twice. With minimal amounts of lube. Dean’s proud grin wouldn’t even go away when Castiel smacked him with a wet towel.
Having turned around to walk back to his car, Jimmy’s phone rang. The display informed him that it was Anael and… shit. “How’s my beautiful partner doing on this fine evening?” He answered the call.
“Nothing.” She quickly changed her tone. “Sorry for interrupting your class, Castiel. But see, this guy here…”
Castiel groaned and stood up. “We better get to it. Would you mind coming with me and being on the lookout? Just in case Meg comes back after all, or if maybe she has someone else working with her?”
Feeling bad, Dean sighed, passing a hand through his hair. “You’re right, I’m sorry. It’s just I personally always wondered about the song. Not in relation to your sexuality. Just because it became so popular and I’d just love it if it was about gay sex.” He shrugged. It was the truth.
“Hey, Cas?” Dean asked, wriggling until Castiel loosened his arms, letting Dean turn around to face him.
Maybe Anael had now also discovered the account in the Cayman’s. But why wouldn’t she come to Jimmy first before arresting his brother? And besides, she hadn’t arrested him. She had left alone.
“Better?” Castiel asked, letting go of his wrists to check on the compress.
“What you told me earlier…” Dean started, leaning in and lowering his voice, even if they were in Castiel’s bathroom with the doors closed. “About Meg. Maybe I can help you… investigate.”
“The girl?” Castiel asked.
“I’m way too sick to eat,” Jessica replied, wrapping her arms around herself. The other two just shook their heads.
Castiel nodded, pushing back from the table. “Guess we have to.”
“Hey, I’m the one who’s been in its belly,” Dean yelled after her retreating form, voice still a little hoarse.
“That wasn’t the name on his passport,” Jessica shrugged. “I think he chose Alfie? But I am honestly not sure. Sorry. And while I am incredibly sad that he died, I don’t see how I could help you with the investigation?”
“The one asking for our help. You just gonna ignore that?” Dean asked.
Dean chuckled at the girl, who looked after her dazed, with a blissed out smile on her face. “Fair enough,“ Dean exclaimed, finally holding out his hand. “I’m Dean.“
“Too bad,” Dean quipped.
They were in it for the long haul, and he wasn’t sure if either of them really knew what they were getting themselves into. But despite Dean definitely getting under his skin, he also had a surprising knack for defusing Castiel’s temper. He’d never admit it, but he was looking forward to their partnership. Dean was intriguing and maybe he was just the right person to help Castiel break free from his shadows and embark on his new journey with the FBI, leaving his military past behind.
Castiel snorted. “You think I don’t know what you guys think of me? You think I like being called to murder scenes and reliving said actual murder when I touch the victim’s clothes? But this… this orb. It has nothing to do with any of this. And I’d rather just forget we ever even saw what we did.” He pulled his trench coat tighter around himself. “I want nothing to do with any of this. Good day, Detective.”
He’s not even lying. The people he killed wearing the mark. The good monsters he killed before he learned not to think in black and white.
“Fuck, fuck.” Dean was writhing again, clenching around Castiel’s fingers and trying to suck him in deeper. “More. Oh please. More.”
Not wasting any more time, he made his way straight there. But once he arrived, he was informed that the prisoners had already been escorted out. And not to worry, someone else had already warned them and there was a unit already dispatched. Castiel thanked them and left the building, the bad feeling in the pit of his stomach growing.
Dean shrugged, squirming a little. He was a red-blooded single in his thirties. There was nothing to be ashamed of. He was allowed to look at porn. And if it was animated, was it even technically porn?
Dean snorted and nudged his shoulder. “Thank you though. For making me feel better.” Taking a step back, Dean bowed down. “And for taking care of me,” he added once he was standing again.
Yes, he knew that.
“No, of course not.” Dean sat up straighter. “That’s why you’re reading the books. I want to be as prepared as I can possibly be, so I can be the one to kill him.”
Dean lost himself planning his return to Earth, and he almost didn‘t realize that his eyelids kept drooping for longer and longer periods of time until it was too late. It was a deep rumble in the distance that fully woke him up again. It sounded like the start of an earthquake and when he touched his hand to the ground, he could feel it shaking. Fuck.
Castiel dared to walk closer to the railing and looked down, seeing smoke come out of the wound before the Kraken dipped it under water and it stopped. “That!” Dean exclaimed. “We gotta keep doing that.”
Dean gulped. And there it was. This was bigger than any of them wanted it to be. But also, a perfect opening to turn this conversation around. “I should maybe inform you that I‘m not shareable. But if you want to have one of your orgies, I‘d be amenable to superwise and share you with who I deem worthy.“
He looked up in shock to find Charlie making a face. “Aw man.” She was trying to keep her voice down, as though the loud sounds of the movie playing shouldn’t be enough to wake Dean up. “I thought my shutter sound was off.”
“I know everything.” She winked at him. “Always.”
“Yeah?” Castiel kissed his way up Dean’s neck, over his chin and to his lips.
“Thank you, Castiel,” he said, handing back the bottle. Castiel recapped it for him and placed it on the nightstand, then he waited for Dean to settle back down.
Their dicks came into contact with each other through their boxers and they both groaned. Dean rutted his hips into Castiel’s in a sensual, teasing motion but Castiel didn’t have it. He wrapped his legs around Dean and pulled him closer, moving into the thrusts and causing Dean to speed up.
If that was up to him. With a start, he realized that they couldn’t just stay on this planet forever, now. That would mean leaving Mary alone eventually, even if no accidents happened before they died of natural causes. And what kind of life would that be for her? Always just with her parents, no other kids her age.
After putting the car in park, Castiel just sat and looked out front for a while. Dean sighed and stretched out his arm against the car seat, creating a space for Cas to move in if he wanted to. It worked and he turned, moving in for a long kiss.
Castiel’s smile lit up his whole face and he hesitated, almost leaning back down, but then he visibly straightened up, putting on a neutral expression, before nodding a wordless goodbye and leaving Dean alone.
“Fuck, Cas!” Dean buried one hand in his hair to keep him against his chest, his own pleasure sky-rocketing. When Castiel used his teeth to worry at his right nipple before soothing it with his tongue and blowing air against the abused skin, the added stimulation was enough to push him over the edge, coming untouched. “Fuck!”
Castiel rolled his eyes. “I am not sleeping in the wet spot, you ass. Either scoot over or sprawl out in the bed you soiled.”
“Keep my mind sharp?” Jimmy asked.
“Looks good,” Castiel assessed. “A little more pressure…” Dean tensed his muscles. “Like that. Good job, Dean. You’re a quick study.” Dean beamed, even though he knew this wasn’t even a hard position. “Now take deep breaths with me,” Castiel instructed.
Dean was still coming down from his orgasm and he knew he was clinging to Castiel, refusing to let him go, but he couldn’t help it. His pleasure had built and built and then it just crashed over him like a gentle yet forceful wave, taking him away and covering him up in pleasantly warm water.
“It’s fine, Cas. I’m ok. You’ll heal. We’ll get rescued.” Or not. Part of Dean was ok with staying here. He had Castiel. Whichever of their people found them first, it would not end well for the other.
Castiel nodded, pleased, and tried to hand back Dean’s credit card. “Here you go.”
Dean still felt weirdly dirty. Not in a bad way. Just… naughty. Which was weird, considering he wasn’t shy around sex. But he’s never had a threesome. Let alone one with actual twins.
Odin looked delighted to see the effect she had on him. “I’m giving you until tomorrow evening to pack up your shit. And that’s only because I really truly do like you.” She walked over to him and patted his cheek. “We had good times together, didn’t we?”
The next day at 8 pm Castiel rings Dean’s doorbell. He doesn’t bring flowers but instead he has a quality hamster treat and a small selection of fruit, because he wasn’t sure which is Dean’s hamster’s favorite. But of course Dean can eat some as well. Dean just has to laugh when he hears it. It’s perfect.
They had decided on starting a rewatch of the Lord of the Rings movies, Castiel and Charlie overruling Dean who didn’t care too much but really just wanted something with Harrison Ford. As a compromise, they’d do Indiana Jones and then Star Wars next.
“Can you?” He repeats.
Dean flopped down on the bed next to him. “So don’t pull me off next time, you dumbass.”
Half an hour later, he was sitting in the middle of the room, stroking one of them—probably Bertha?—and he realized why Charlie was so fond of them. It had a very soothing effect and he didn’t leave until it was time for dinner.
“Do you know his last name? His address?” Dean prompted.
Castiel handed over one half but Dean just looked at it. “I’m on a juice cleanse.” His stomach churned at the thought of solid food.
Castiel could only stare, wide-eyed. Why would Dean set the wood on fire? They could’ve built something with that. And would Dean now have to carry wood every day? But Dean was holding his hands over the flame and looking blissful, saying something about “warm.” Castiel suddenly remembered that the night before, when he’d helped Dean sleep, he’d been shivering. The destroyers probably needed a lot more warmth than Ceruleans.
Dean passed a hand over his face. “Alright. Tell me exactly what you did.”
Castiel nodded. “Correct.” He waited for Dean to get on the mat. “But you’re going to put a bit more thought into posture for this. And you hold it, once again trying to breathe deep and evenly.”
Deciding to risk it, he opened Dean’s website to check for any recent orders or bugs that might have occured and then shot off a message to Charlie to tell her he was back on track. She just replied with a thumbs up and then shot off an invitation to movie night for next Thursday. Mentally checking his schedule, that should be doable.
Castiel shrugged again, looking towards his nightstand, probably checking the time - or avoiding the question. “You needed the rest.”
“What the fuck is going on here?” Dean turned to Novak when he realized he couldn’t move.
Castiel frowned. “Jealous? No. I want them off my back for a while.” He groaned. “Ugh, I can’t take it anymore. I’m over it. I just want to get well and truly fucked. You in?” He pushed Dean against the wall and started to crowd in.
Castiel bit his lip. “Ok, look. I might’ve told Donna that I was hoping to not be alone tonight. And I assume she called in when we got in the car? I definitely didn’t order this.” He flushed and then turned to blow out some of the candles.
Castiel hugged his phone to his chest, glad nobody was around to see it. Then he went to sleep with a big smile on his face.
“No, it’s a partner card. It’s linked to my account.” Dean shrugged like it was no big deal, but he started to avoid direct eye contact again.
Dean did as instructed, nuzzling Castiel’s thighs and pushing in between his legs. When Cas opened his zipper, Dean looked up at him. “What about Jimmy?”
“Yes,” Cas didn’t look up from the chat.
“What?” Castiel frowned. “You misunderstand. I’d choose you over Heaven any time.” He said it casually, like it was a well-known fact. “I’m upset they refused to help.”
Castiel was looking at him in silence for so long that Dean almost cracked to break the awkwardness, but then Castiel slid out of bed. “You know what helps expel negative thoughts?”
Dean beams. Usually when he meets guys, they mock him for having a children’s pet and not a ‘real one’. It’s an immediate red flag for him. He’s glad Castiel is not one of those morons. He pulls out his phone to show Castiel some pictures but stops when Castiel pulls his own phone out as well. Oh.
“I don’t… I don’t have anything else,” Dean admitted, his fork now clattering to the desk. He looked morose and like he was about to cry.
“You’re welcome.” Dean winked and left to get himself ready.
Castiel frowned. For the first time Dean seemed like he might suspect something. “I hired on for the long haul,” he replied stubbornly and went back to reading his book.
Just as his instincts were about to kick in and make him get dressed and flee, his door was kicked open and a man with a gun was breaking into his place, taking aim. Exactly as he’d seen it in his dream.
“We?” Jimmy jumped in. What the hell?
“I mean, there’s other fun activities I can think of. And my friend has a private beach, so we can do those indoors or outdoors.” Castiel winked, then he ducked his head to nibble on Dean’s throat.
He looked towards his cramped closet where one of Jimmy’s suits was still waiting to be picked up again. They hadn’t gotten up to anything unsavory, but when he had come over to watch a game with him and Dean, it had gotten so late that Castiel had offered his couch. And the next morning, some of his clothes. At least Castiel would be ready if an interview came up last minute.
Castiel closed his eyes and just held on. In the back of his mind, his cynic brain was yelling at him to not get attached to Dean, and what the fuck was he even doing right now. He should pack and leave town and never look back. But the part of him that wanted to stay, finally listen to Balthazar and train and maybe save Dean next time was a lot louder.
“There’s my good boy,” Castiel praised, kissing his way up again and granting Dean a lazy kiss, stroking his tongue against Dean’s with the same languidity he was fucking him with. “You feel so goddamn good. Don’t want this to end,” Castiel confessed.
“We better run,” Ana suggested, helping Dean up. Dean was still cradling his shoulder, though the bleeding seemed to have stopped. Going by how drenched in blood his clothes were, Castiel could have sworn that had been a deep cut. “You good?” Ana asked Dean and when he nodded, she let go of him, drew her sword, and pulled another gun with her left hand.
After collecting their mugs for a refill, he went back to being useless at his chosen profession.
Ana held her head high. “You’re lucky you’re cute. And that I find mutinies tacky.” She patted Dean’s cheek and breezed off to yell at a different crew member.
“Right. That was Uriel’s ship?” Dean asked.
He couldn’t waste time for his own mission though. Castiel went back to his room and got out his shrooms-and-other-hallucinogenic-substances collection from the back of the cupboard and when he looked for a jar to stash his USB stick in, he remembered to also get out the peppermint. With a smirk, he badly hid the second USB stick in that jar, then threw everything in a bag and went to his office again.
He unbuttoned his shirt and took off his bulletproof vest, making a mental note to get one for Dean, as well. He‘d have to put in the request along with an ask for everything they had on Lilith and Alastair—and hope they wouldn‘t pull this case out from under him now that it wasn‘t just open-and-shut, anymore.
Jimmy got out his phone and thumbed through his gallery. Anael was extremely prissy about having her photograph taken, but early on in their relationship, Jimmy used to have a crush on her, so he’d snuck a few candids. Not ok behaviour, he realized that, but this way he didn’t have to log into the FBI database to access her official ID photo.
Castiel couldn’t do this. He wordlessly opened his trailer door and stepped inside, about to slam the door shut.
“What? You broke it? What about your armor?” Anna looked him up and down. “You seem fine.”
Castiel waited until Dean’s breathing had evened out and he could be sure that he was truly slumbering before he rose to leave. He quietly moved to his door and opened it, finding Meg already outside, hand raised, like she was just about to knock. Castiel frowned at her. She would have woken Dean.
Dean smiled up at him, but was still hesitant. “Didn’t quite feel like it at first,” he protested.
“Today we will talk about how the allegory of the cave still holds up, and how it can be applied to modern media and the emergence of so-called ‘alternative theories’.” He made air quotes around the words and smirked when he saw some of their faces light up. It would be a great topic for a whole thesis and he hoped someone would bite.
Dean wasn’t sure if he was offering a kiss or Jimmy’s finger, but either way, he felt rooted to the spot. “That’s… that’s still unsanitary,” he croaked out, finally tearing his eyes away from the twins and looking around the café. Thankfully nobody else seemed to be close enough to the counter to have witnessed this.
“If you say ‘be careful’ I’m going to take that coffee of yours and pour it straight out,” Dean warned.
Meg was about to snap a reply, but Castiel cut her off with a hard glare. She rolled her eyes and turned around instead, dismissing them. Dismissing
“Excuse you?” Castiel mock-pouted. “I seem to recall you being quite devout there just a few days ago.”
“Yes,” Castiel poked him in the side to get him moving, happy to find him in a playful mood. “We both are.”
Before Dean could think about slipping out of bed to snoop, Castiel opened his eyes and blinked at him. “Dean,” he rasped out, voice still laced with sleep. “Are you feeling better?”
He cupped Castiel’s cheeks and angled his head, taking control of the kiss. They embraced for a long time until Dean pulled away to throw more wood into the fire and get the new blankets Cas had woven from some long leaves Dean had used to carry more wood. He spooned up behind Castiel and threw both blankets over them, pressing one last kiss to his neck before they drifted off to sleep.
“Oh, that’s where we’re at now? Good to know.” Meg had lowered her voice, but she still seemed extremely pissed off. “Seriously, Clarence. He’s an FBI agent and you’re letting him into your quarters?”
Dean picked up his coffee mug to hide his smile and drained it while he was at it. Damn straight he was! He surveyed the table and realized they were all pretty much done. “Speaking off, I gotta get back to my desk. Fill out a report on last night’s shooting and such.” Like come up with a good reason why he hadn’t called it in last night or why he’d let Garth leave the state. He rubbed his temples. Thankfully his Chief gave him a lot of leeway because he brought in results, but he’d been off the grid for almost a full day now. He had to report on what it all had to do with the bike messenger. “Cas, you coming?”
Castiel nodded. “It’s not over yet, Mildred, so please don’t say goodbye.”
the fall guy. “Clarence, you can’t…”
“Cas? You ok?” Dean touched his shoulder when he passed him. “What happened?”
Looking up at his boyfriend, Castiel sighed and moved away from his comfy spot in Dean’s lap to sit up next to him instead. Dean grunted in protest, but he could probably sense where this was going and waited patiently for Castiel to start.
Dean was smirking at him and added a wink as soon as their eyes met. Then he saluted with his own mug and took a drink as well before pushing the brownie forward towards Cas. “If you don’t want to talk about it…”
“Stop thinking,” Castiel grumbled, pulling him back in. “I can hear your thoughts from here.”
“That remains to be seen.” Castiel raised an eyebrow. Then he looked at his watch. “Alright, fuck. I need to be at sound check so we’ll continue this some other time.”
Castiel cocked his head in consideration. Dean knew it was weighing on him to not be quite as powerful as he once was. But he must have settled on the correct meaning, because he smiled a little. “Oh.”
However navigating the backstage area was proving to be difficult. There were a lot of groupies and other press already loitering the hallway, probably to be first in line to snatch Castiel when he came back from the stage. Dean felt weird passing the row and he received quite a few nasty looks when he forced his way through the throngs of people.
As he was leaving the coop, the ship’s alarm began sounding and Castiel made his way on deck to investigate. The sea snake couldn’t be back, could it? No. Dean had definitely killed it. Maybe it had a mate?
“I’m asking
It was enough for Dean to tumble over the edge and come. Castiel swallowed as much as he could, bringing his hand back up to stroke him through his aftershocks until he had stopped spurting. Castiel licked him clean before he moved back up to face Dean.
“Isn’t this a non-profit for the community type operation here?” Dean teased him. “I’m only thinking of everybody else.”
Castiel nodded. Yes. That was the plan and his plans always worked out, at least since he became Castiel. “Alright, let’s see if Mildred was right to be worried.”
“How’d that happen, anyway?” Dean asked. “Did she visit you in jail?”
“So, while I still have you contained on my ship, I figured I better make good use of your skillset.” Dean shrugged, suddenly a little nervous.
Castiel was about to protest that he didn’t need cleaning, but then he remembered how fun their times under the shower could be. In any case, he’d get to soap up Dean and thus take more care of him. He would use every opportunity Dean allowed him for this.
“Maybe if she’d…” Dean interrupted but received the same harsh noise from Ana that Charlie had just gotten.
He’d considered smuggling one in, but decided against it in case they had equipment to check for it. By now, Dean was pretty sure he would’ve been safe, but it was too late and Castiel didn’t seem to have one either. Probably by choice, seeing how the leader surely could’ve gotten away with it? It was only more proof that Castiel was authentic.
Dean paused, wondering if that was a joke. He wouldn’t be too surprised. But he hadn’t witnessed any usage.
Castiel shrugged. “Sorry.” He looked down at his hands. “I didn’t want to, but once I was alone…”
“The leg?” Dean asked. “Is that why the armor won’t move?”
“Apparently it’s clean.” Dean informed him. Cas nodded, like he had expected that. “It’s ‘too clean’,” Dean added, including finger air-quotes.
“What?” Jimmy could feel a ringing start in his ears. He needed coffee for this. No, wait. He needed Whiskey for this. “When?”
Castiel put the soup down and was by his chair in a flash, grabbing a hold of the back of it and turning Dean around so he could hug him to his chest. “You don’t have to eat it,” Castiel quickly reassured him. “I’m sorry.”
Dean laughed again, feeling lighter than he had in a long time. “I’m gonna call them and have them retract your bonus. You’re suddenly bad for my work ethic.”
Castiel huffed into his hair but after a last kiss to Dean’s skin, he slid out and rolled over onto his side, immediately gathering Dean up again and spooning up behind him.
“Oh,” Jimmy scratched his arm and looked down. “Do you not want me to move here?”
“And the resident guinea pig expert,” Castiel adds with a smile. “I forgot.”
“You hunted for us? Thank you, Dean.” Castiel decided to praise him, but it really was nice.
“She works for the FBI? No wonder she’s always one step ahead of us,” Cas replied. “Shit, that does explain why she always warned me just before one of you guys came around.”
“That’s because you suck,” Odin snapped. “And do you have any idea how fucking expensive it is looking the way I do, just so I will get taken seriously by anyone? And then… and then I still don’t get promoted. You know who got promoted over me? Ruby. And you know why?”
The alien’s eyes widened, then he pointed at himself, too. “Castiel.”
“Just tell me what it is I’ve supposedly done this time,” Castiel asked.
“I watch a lot of detective shows,” Dean lied. “I am sure I can swing it.”
Castiel sighed. “Dean…”
Dean’s eyes snapped open at that and he immediately got lost in Castiel’s blue depth.
“And tomorrow you’ll show me a picture of your dinner,” Castiel demanded. It definitely wasn’t a question or a joke. Something in Dean unclenched.
Truthfully, Castiel was fascinated. He’d read what he could on Dean, but little was known about him beyond that he had inherited the ship from his father. Some records say he also had a brother who died at a young age, but again, little was known about it. He invoked an unusual sense of loyalty within his crew; any who were captured never talked, and they all mysteriously died in capture before their sentence could be fulfilled. None of Dean’s men ever hung.
Sam nodded. “I heard, too late, that someone had betrayed Dean. At first, I thought it was you, but there was no mention of you having a successful mission. So I rushed here as fast as I could.”
Next thing they knew, they had kicked down the door and walked in on not only two, but seven vampires apparently having a party the night before with two unfortunate victims. They were swarmed but Dean and Sam wielded their machetes expertly while Castiel was smiting three of them. He looked over to help Dean just to see a vampire get way too close and scratch up Dean’s arm. Before he could get to Dean’s neck however, Dean had kicked him away and beheaded him with a swift stroke.
“No.” Dean shook his head. “It tasted weird. I didn’t even finish my cup.”
When he woke up again, Dean was stroking his hair. Castiel sighed and smiled happily, eyes still closed. The soothing motion of being caressed was almost enough to lull him right back into sleep, but as his senses grew more aware, he realized how sticky he felt. That, and he was still slumped on top of Dean.
“Like someone I’d be lucky to be able to call my boyfriend,” Castiel replied. “A kind hearted, talented, sexy person. And I don’t just mean your physique. I like how you let yourself go when we have sex. How responsive you are. That is sexy.”
“What?” Dean wrapped his arm around him and turned to look at him. “You remember some of my old articles?”
Cas reached down to grab Dean’s cock and with the way his boy hissed, Dean must be pretty close himself. But he’d kept his own hands off, because he knew better than that. With a smile, Castiel withdrew from the kiss and pumped Dean’s cock a few times before pulling away. Dean let out a whine, but he didn’t complain.
Now that was a new thought. They’d already planned on working together to gather actual evidence on Odin. They just had to speed up their timeline. He nuzzled into Dean and stroked a hand up and down his back. This. He couldn’t give this up. His life had been ruined once. Not again. If he went down again, he’d go down fighting. With friends by his side.
Just as Dean had gotten so wriggly again that he threw Castiel’s arm off, Castiel stopped, pulling back with a last soft kiss to where he’d placed his bite earlier. “Good boy, Dean,” he praised. “You showed remarkable restraint.”
Dean sent his brother a glare and doubled over, groaning and pretending he was in a lot more pain than he actually was. Cas was immediately at his side and Dean had to dodge his fingers again. “Painkillers. In my room.”
“It’s not.” Dean sighed. “There’s no evidence yet. I’m investigating one murder and when I went to question Jessica, we got shot at.” He left out the parts about the time piece and the other people in it which he still had to find, actually.
“How long?” Dean repeated.
Dean sobered at that, thinking of his own mother dying early. But his mom had been a great mom, so who was he to judge?
She looked him up and down pointedly and Dean shuddered a bit. “I don‘t...“ He stopped. Ok, he did get it. So far he‘d thought it was just a myth though. Those other tours he covered never had anything close to this spectacle.
“Who the fuck…” Castiel paused. “Fucking Ruby. Still holding a grudge, I see.” Dean raised his eyebrow, waiting for more. Finally Castiel sighed. “One girl. I banned one girl. And Alaina was a vindictive bitch. Friends with Ruby, or so she claimed. But whenever Ruby couldn’t come, she shamelessly hit on Anna. All the while watching me. So I took her off the menu.”
An hour later, Castiel, Dean and Garth, the lanky guy, were on their way to the Impala. The Navy had not caught up with them, so Castiel wasn’t going to find out how Dean always escaped, but fine. That wasn’t his assignment, anyway.
“Oh really?” Castiel challenged. “Next weekend, you’re gonna prove that.”
“Fine.” Jimmy conceded. “What does float your boat though, Dean? I have a few educated guesses, but I guess it’s time we talk about it.”
“You could go back to sleep,” Dean offered. “Or…” he deliberately trailed off.
That night, after storing the rest of the carcass in a far corner of their cave, Castiel took off his armor and scooted a little closer to Dean while he slept during the second shift.
Like meditation, however, he just silently went through his own routine and allowed his followers to graciously join in. If they were beginners, Pamela actually led classes. She’d been a yoga instructor before joining them. One of the few people here who hadn't been scouted for their portfolio alone.
Cas nods. “Sorry you only lived a few more months.” His mouth is a thin line and he honestly looks regretful.
Castiel snorted, not expecting the bluntness. “You’re the one who’s gonna be less sore,” he chuckled, but then held up his hands. “Alright. It’s gonna keep you healthy, help you relax and most of all, it’s something we get to do together?” Now Castiel was pulling out his own puppy look, sticking out his lower lip. “Don’t you want to salute the sun with me?”
Castiel was aghast and half-expected Dean to storm after her and have her reprimanded to reclaim his honor, but instead he just smiled. When Dean socked him in the shoulder, Castiel almost fell over because he didn’t expect it. “Don’t look so shocked, Cas. It’s like you’ve never seen a female pirate.”
When she finally hatched, Dean was with him and they both sat around the egg, eagerly watching the process. She’d probably felt them and waited until they could share the moment; she was smart like that.
“Yes…” Castiel bit his lip to stifle it, but Dean could see his grin emerging as well. “I believe the knowledge that none of this is real and all of it will be gone soon has made me petty.”
“Comfy?” Castiel asked with a smile in his voice.
“See? You’re a good person, Dean,” Castiel told him.
“Hey, Cas,” Dean greeted back, still nervous. “You want your usual to drink in, or…”
Dean instantly shut down. “Oh, fuck off. I thought we had something. But fine. If you just wanted a one night stand, just fucking leave.”
Having a very bad feeling about this, Dean asked around who that was and what his business was. Apparently he was an FBI agent - something Dean severely doubted - and was investigating a serial killer operating across state lines. And he’d been looking at Dean’s case. If Dean had been in earlier, they probably would have been introduced. But apparently the FBI agent had been very interested in Castiel.
“It’s not…” Cas looked at him, probably realizing his level of understanding. “You could say we write these ourselves.”
Once they were almost out of sight, Ana turned to Castiel. “Do you want to leave and help him or do you want to leave and go back to where you came from?”
Castiel sighed. He wanted Dean to initiate it. But… he didn’t expect him to be so forward. It was grating on Castiel to not be in total control. “Drink your goddamn tea, you menace,” he ordered.
Dean kicked him again and Castiel snapped out of it. “I know you said you were identical twins, but… damn.” Dean remarked.
“I am?” Castiel asked, then caught himself. “Yes, I am. I will be very useful to you.”
“What? You’re going to go down for an actual criminal? Don’t be dumb, Cas.” She threw a candy wrapper at him and he caught it before it could hit Dean, glaring at her.
Castiel shrugged. “I don’t even care.” It was the truth. They’d leave here soon enough.
“Morning, Dean.” Castiel placed the mugs on the nightstand and gave Dean a closed mouth kiss before joining him in bed again.
It’s Sam and he looks wrecked. There’s deep circles under his eyes and his clothes are covered in blood. Instantly worried, Eileen opens the door. “Sam?” She asks and Sam tries to sign in reply, but his hands keep faltering. He stares at them forlornly, as if he has forgotten all the words and then finally looks up at her.
They woke up still entangled the next morning, but neither of them commented on it. There was only a faint smirk from Cas when Dean had to run down to his car to get another shirt because last night’s didn’t have buttons anymore. Thankfully he remembered that he always had a second set of clothes in his trunk. Depending on where his crime scenes ended up being, he didn’t want to drag the dirt or smell with him into his precious baby. He even found an old tee for Castiel to wear, since his shirt from last night was also worse for wear.
“Dean.” Dean said again, now pointing at himself. “My name is Dean.”
“I’m sure they have enough to arrest her. You dug up a lot of evidence with Jimmy, and that hacker friend of yours should have come through, right?” Dean tried to reassure him.
“I saw that,” Dean smiled back and nudged him with his shoulder.
Castiel shrugged. “I relaxed.”
“No. Because when I kill him, he can’t kill anyone else, ever again.” Dean slammed his fist down, gaze fiery. “So keep reading.”
The alien’s voice was rich and melodic. It was easy to just listen to him. He obviously knew that Castiel didn’t understand him, yet he kept talking. Castiel wondered if the alien knew that he had a knack for languages and was learning, or if he just didn’t care that Castiel didn’t reply. Every now and then, Castiel nodded in encouragement and gestured with his hand for the alien to continue.
“Ah,” Castiel nodded. “Yes, I understand money.”
“Who doesn’t?” Dean replied. “But yes. Basically raised my little brother. Wasn’t all bad.”
“Oh, no.” Castiel looks at him in shock. “I need to… I can’t…” He swallows and takes a deep breath. “I can’t make it tonight, but is tomorrow ok? Text me your address?” He fiddles with his collar even though it is already loose. Dean thinks it’s adorable. “If you want to, of course. Oh God.” Castiel’s eyes widen. “I promise I am not some stalker who has been watching you for weeks only to now pounce.”
Dean just nodded, fingers itching to touch, to see if he could calm him down. But he still had his encore to play and Dean didn’t want the tiger to snap and kick him off his tour. The rest of the band chose that moment to come back, sending him curious glances before they joined Castiel and prepared to go back on stage.
Jo rolled her eyes. “Ok, look. If it’s about physical attraction, why not just go and bang it out of your system?”
Now that
“But thank you so much, sweet boy.” Castiel kissed his cheek, fingers slowly trailing down his arm. “I do appreciate the offer and would be very happy if you could still have dinner with me?”
Dean tensed up again. Castiel should stop poking him, but the sooner Dean came clean, the faster they could move forward. “It’s why I came,” Dean hedged.
With a sigh, Dean got up to walk to the breakroom himself, but as soon as he was standing, it felt like someone had pulled the rug right out from under him and he couldn’t feel solid ground anymore. Just as he tried to piece together what was even happening, everything went black.
Dean snorted. “Please. None of that stuck, you know that as well as I do. And I’m certainly not going down for a crime I didn’t even commit.” He glanced at the images again and shook his head. “I am not going down for this.” Looking back up, he implored Castiel. “What if I help you catch the real bad guys, here?”
Castiel strode over to him and took the cups out of his hand before he wrapped an arm around him. “Welcome back, Dean.”
“Or?” Castiel prompted, blinking open one eye. When Dean just grinned at him, Castiel swiftly moved to roll on top of him, pushing Dean into the mattress. “Or?” He repeated again, in a different tone, more playful and suggestive.
, I want to be able to take my time and have you all spread out for me, preferably in a bed.” Castiel winked. “Though I guess the yoga mat would do.”
“Yes. Why do you think I was on a juice cleanse?” Dean took his hand away and rolled his chair so Castiel’s hand fell off his thigh as well. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I have some work to do.”
Dean’s lips twitched and he gave up trying not to smile. “Fair,” he conceded. “Don’t tell Jimmy, though.”
“And since you’re identical twins, it’s almost like masturbating?” Dean offered.
“Do you want me to sleep on the chair?” Castiel offered.
“Uhm,” Castiel bit his bottom lip, looking like he was caught doing something wrong.
Dean got up and stretched, banning the thoughts from his mind and getting ready to head on out. The sooner he left, the quicker he’d get back for a second run. “Be careful,” Castiel warned him.
Castiel looked at the knives, hooks, and other medical instruments in his kit. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. He wished he could say no. “Yes.”
Dean flinched back. “I would never. Cas, please.”
“What?” Dean frowned, having a bad feeling about what came next.
Castiel glared at him and ignored him in favor of starting his coffee maker.
“I only see upsides so far.” He nudged Castiel’s still clothed leg with his naked one, thinking about how they definitely needed to rectify this as soon as they were done eating.
“So is there anything else I can do for you?” Castiel offered. “Anything you need? Anything at all?”
“I need to see those before you use them,” Castiel growled, suddenly a lot closer to where Dean had been trying to hide.
Jimmy ground his teeth and took off his sunglasses, slipping them into his expensive-looking suit’s side pocket. Corporate sell-out. Castiel sneered, not even a little bit self-conscious about his faded tee, ripped-from-actual-wear jeans and scuffed Converse. “You’re not supposed to have this,” Jimmy repeated.
‘I had you drugged for your first two weeks here, you idiot,’ Castiel thought. “So what you’re saying is, you don’t need me?” He gave Dean a wounded look.
Thankfully, their ships were still where they used to be. Dean’s wreck had fully burned out, and there wasn’t anything of value left. When Castiel deactivated the forcefield around his own ship, he went inside to grab all the fabrics he could find. His armor wasn’t designed to be worn full-time and Dean’s suit was already damaged; they would need to make clothes at some point. It had been an intentional slight, but now he was pleased that he’d been issued an older model ship that still came with a parachute. It hadn’t deployed during the crash, of course, but that meant it was still good to cut up and sew into new shapes using salvaged thread or even strips of the vines.
Speaking of. “It should be though. Maybe then you’d see the clues,” Balthazar supplied helpfully.
“No.” Rowena looks offended. “What are you even doing here? Shouldn’t you be…” She points up.
Dean huffed. “And tonight?”
“And instead of following in his footsteps, you decided the pirate life was more for you?” Ana asked in a disbelieving tone.
“No, but you’re trying and letting me guide you. That’s all I wanted.” Castiel smiled, rewarding him with a kiss to his temple. “Thank you, Dean.”
Dean frowned, sitting up a bit straighter but trying not to disturb Cas, who was almost asleep. “You ok?”
“You suck.” Dean pushed him half-heartedly but then he slumped back against his side.
Castiel hummed and kept his eyes closed. “I’m tired. My mean boss worked me ragged all week.”
“Nonsense,” Castiel replied, hand moving into Dean’s hair instead, petting him softly. “I promised to take care of you and I will.” He’d make the tea as soon as Dean was back in bed, adjusting the herbs. The detox was working, now he just needed something to soothe him.
With another curse on his lips, Castiel sat up and threw off his shirt and then wiggled out of his pants and socks. He could feel Dean doing the same next to him. “Didn’t realize I was that tired,” Castiel admitted.
“Ooh, finally I get the respect I deserve again. Thank you, Dean.” Castiel grinned. “I’m glad you’re being a
Dean sniffled and wrapped his arms around him. “That’s not it. I’m…” He broke off and just kept crying, his shoulders shaking with it.
Castiel frowned at him, letting go to look for another pair of pants. And, right. Dean finally allowed himself to focus and look. Castiel did still have a dick; it was thicker than Dean’s and flushed blue, matching the rest of his skin, but otherwise it seemed… compatible. But so, if Castiel was male, why…
.” Dean somehow made it sound dirty. “Do I get a treat for being a good boy?” He winked.
Starting with making an appointment with Doctor Barnes. It helped that Castiel spoke receptionist and he managed to weasle Dean into a recently cancelled appointment this afternoon by offering to pay a little extra — and specifically knowing to ask for recent cancellations. He knew the receptionist would have rather not filled it and gone home early instead, but her boss definitely wouldn’t appreciate the loss of income.
Castiel knew he was expecting sex though. He had to softly let him down without making Dean feel bad about it. Faking a yawn, Castiel walked over to the other side of the bed and slid in, patting the spot next to him. “Come cuddle with me?”
Seeing how Dean should hopefully spend a lot more time in here in the future, Castiel made sure to push those to the far back of his cabinet when he got out the ginger, sage and whatever else he thought might help Dean right now, blending it before he started the electric kettle and brewing Dean a pot.
“And Meg?” Dean raised his eyebrow. Meg was almost as elusive as Castiel himself. Though there’d been a few scandals, mostly involving her yelling at bouncers or destroying cameras.
“That was risky, Sam. We would’ve gotten out on our own,” Dean chastised.
“Because I… care about you,” Castiel admitted. “You’re a good boss.”
Castiel frowned but then remembered his fall and… dammit. “How’d you find me?”
“Jimmy,” Dean supplied. “I mean, uhm, I’m not just thinking about your brother, uhm,…” Dean stammered, unsure how to go there.
Castiel threw Dean a quick look, obviously as annoyed about this as Dean was. “You’ve been with us for what now, five months, Kelly?” Castiel asked, waiting for her to nod. “My guidance is, that if you still don’t know how to be kind to new members, I have obviously failed you.” He added a small pause, waiting for her eyes to light up with hope. “Maybe you should seek a new mentor elsewhere,” Castiel concluded, smiling kindly and Kelly’s face fell.
Garth held up his hands. “Come on, Jess. He wasn’t very forthcoming. Dude wants to dampen his powers to sleep better I give him some pills. He didn’t tell me he, what, hears the thoughts of everybody in a three block radius?”
Jimmy had quickly ducked down, hoping she hadn’t seen him. What the hell had she been doing there? He had immediately checked his phone for any missed messages, but there were none. But just in case, he’d gotten back in his car and driven off without delivering the laptop. He didn’t want to make anything worse for Cas and he had to log into his account and go through his work emails first.
Dean pushed back. “What? I’m here to do a job. I’m not losing it over one night with you.” Thankfully he was still sober and pissed enough to decline. Any other time, Dean might have gone for it.
“Cute.” Castiel reached for the lube. “I told you your cock wasn’t going anywhere near Dean today and I meant it. But go and fetch me a vibrator. The purple one.” It wasn’t too big and Dean would be fine, so they could actually have their scene in a few days. If Jimmy had earned it by then.
“Yeah well, case sounded important.” Sam shrugged and Dean frowned. That was definitely not all there was to it. But he’d interrogate him later. “This is my brother, the district attorney.” Dean introduced him. “Jessica, he’s going to get you somewhere safe.”
“Turn,” Castiel asked him, staying on his knees. Dean did, legs a little unsteady, and Castiel smirked up at him. “One area left that requires special attention.”
“I’d like it if you spent more nights here.” Dean advanced again. “Assuming
“I feel sick. Heal me.” Dean bit his lip hard, trying to draw blood. When he succeeded, Castiel bent down to lick it off and it tingled a little again but it was definitely not enough.
Castiel leaned against the doorframe, basking in the warmth of having all of Dean’s attention. “I was wondering if I should order us some dinner?”
He pushed Jimmy inside and when he was sure he was inaudible to his students, he hissed, “Go in the corner and think about what you’ve done. Don’t move. Don’t touch yourself. Or I will know.”
“I’m gonna tell your brother you referred to him as it,” Dean joked.
The doorbell jingled and Dean Winchester looked up from behind the counter, his friendly smile turning into a scowl as soon as Jimmy entered. Jimmy sighed. Yeah. He didn’t even want to know what kind of stories Cas had been telling about him.
Meg had a lot of gall, threatening him like this. Castiel made himself a little taller, dropping all of his relaxed appearance. “Unless you end up with an unfortunate overdose before we get arrested,” he threatened, pleased to see her flinch. That wasn’t his plan, he didn’t even have any heroin around lest Dean went snooping and actually found something. But Meg didn’t need to know that.
“We go?” The alien tried and Dean looked at him. “Wa… water?”
“Should I follow?” Dean asked. “Make him stay?” Cas knew him better. And not only that… Dean had no idea what the whole etiquette was for threesomes. Maybe they should have talked about the aftermath a little before they started.
Dean bit his lip, flushed all over. “The oil?”
“Hell, no.” Castiel rolled over him, peering down at Dean. “I meant it when I said you’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me. I don’t want to imagine my future without you. I…” He faltered, realizing what he should be saying, how true it was, but… “I…”
Castiel nodded, rolling out of his side of the bed. But when Dean walked past him, stark naked, he couldn’t help but trail after him. “Or we conserve some water?” He suggested when Dean raised an eyebrow at him once they’d reached the bathroom.
Castiel finished securing the ropes around their boat so it could be pulled back up when Sam followed his brother. “The Kraken. Can’t believe you’d go after him without me. Jerk.”
Thankfully the place was mostly deserted since the breakfast rush was over and lunch hadn’t started yet. Jimmy extracted the laptop from his messenger back and slid it over the counter. It was still in an evidence bag, but Dean could have it back.
Dean happily nodded, taking the mug back behind the counter. Castiel was about to berate his brother for belittling Dean, but Dean knew he had absolutely no computer skills. Yet he still wanted to help. And Jimmy had found a small way he could do that, thus ensuring Dean felt like he contributed, instead of dismissing him like Castiel was about to do.
When Dean’s rim felt swollen and tingly but incredibly wet, Castiel pushed his cheeks apart even further and started to push his tongue in, slowly at first, spearing him with short jabs, until Dean had relaxed enough so he could curl all of it inside and lick.
“Nice to meet you,” Garth gushed. “You’re running a tight ship.”
They rolled and traded places a few more times until they were both naked and writhing in the sheets.
his toolkit. He’d never have agreed to this operation if he’d known they would pressure him into torturing some hapless civilian, even if he was a criminal involved in human trafficking.
He accepted it, anyway, and the next day, they both left the cave wearing their new shirts—Castiel wearing the one Dean made while Dean got the nicer one that Castiel had been working on. It felt good to get rid of at least part of his flight suit and to see Castiel in something casual, too. Like they were finally leaving their soldier roles behind, so they could continue to work as a team on this strange planet.
“Uhm, yes.“ Dean decided against introducing himself.
“Cas-Tee-El,” the alien repeated, stressing each sound.
“But not anymore?” Castiel prodded. Dean was a Fed who went undercover. Surely that came with a bunch of scrapes and bruises, too.
Castiel let go of Dean’s hand and put both of his hands in his coat’s pockets instead, feeling awkward. But Dean seemed strangely unfazed. “What a dick,” he remarked. “And he’s with you a lot?”
Castiel slumped against the counter and passed a hand over his face. “No. The victim was naked.”
They leaned against the counter shoulder to shoulder and sipped on their tea in comfortable silence. “Thank you,” Dean sighed after drinking about half of it. “That warmed me right up. You always take such good care of me.”
“Of course,” Castiel agreed. He took Dean’s hand in his and led him over to the bed. “You get in, I’m gonna bring you your tea.”
“He said he needed a second breakfast,” Mildred chuckled. “I like him, Castiel. Thank you for assigning him to work in the kitchens. He’ll flourish here, with us.” She tried to reassure him, but Castiel was pissed. Dean shouldn’t flourish in the kitchens. He should flourish with him, at his side. At all times. Or stay in his room and wait, like he was told.
They could see it approaching, taking its time and slithering over the water before dunking down again and coming back up, a little closer each time. It was toying with them. Or maybe it was waiting for that virgin sacrifice. Castiel had no idea. At least it wasn’t big enough to swallow their ship whole, but it was definitely much bigger than any moraine Castiel had ever seen. And it didn’t look like one, either.
“I’m…” Castiel paused and cringed. “Here to care for the chickens. I’m the new kitchen help?”
Except for the ones that get captured and mysteriously die before they can be interrogated and hanged. Castiel still couldn’t understand how that played out. Dean didn’t seem like the type to have his crew murdered before they could spill his secrets. Especially since his secrets might be so unbelievable, nobody would buy it. He didn’t say anything, just looked at the book. There was a squid on the cover.
When he arrived, at least half the group was actually doing the work and Dean tried to stand in the back and mimic the position as well. It didn’t look too hard. Castiel was standing on one leg, had his other bent behind him, held up by his right arm while his left pointed forward, for balance. However, Dean didn’t even really get his leg up and as he tried, he wobbled and had to do a hop to not fall over. Unfortunately that brought him into contact with the girl standing in front of him and when he bumped into her leg, she had to break her position and turned around to snap at him.
Dean quickly waved him off. “Please. You carried me around for half a day after my ship burned out. You’d do the same for me.” He could appreciate it, now that he was sure Castiel had not intended to eat him later.
“No, you’re not,” Dean protested. “You’re
In the evening, the whole office was empty again and Castiel had stupidly hoped that Dean would leave early once more and had not planned for his own dinner, or at least an afternoon snack. But so be it. He’d have to order in for the both of them. If it were solely up to him, he’d order burgers again. Castiel liked burgers. But it might throw Dean into another crisis, so instead he ordered pho.
“Breathing,” Castiel explained. “In,” he repeated, happy to feel Dean follow him. “And out.” He moved his hands, cupping Dean’s chest instead and brushing up against his nipples, delighted to find them already hard. “In.” He rubbed. “And out.” He rubbed again.
The petty officer on duty looked up and gave him a once-over before nodding. “What happened to your uniform, soldier?”
Ellen hummed. “Rat bastards, the lot of them. You’re doing more to protect the seas than those scallywags ever could.”
“We watch Die Hard and get drunk. I bet you don’t even have a tree,” Sam protested.
Castiel rubbed his thumb over Dean’s bottom lip to stop him and then wrapped his arm around him, pulling him into his side. “I guess. I’ve never done this before.” And Castiel had said what had been bugging him the most. Dean should know that he had a choice. Just because Jimmy and him had a past, didn’t mean they had to pick it back up now.
“Listen, you’ll come stay with me,” Dean quickly reassured him. Hadn’t they already established that? “And we’ll figure out the rest. I’ll get a bail bond.” Maybe he should call Sam. They’d lost touch when Sam left for college, leaving before Dean could even consider to follow. He hadn’t even given Dean a chance, back then. He’d just… Sam hadn’t just left dad. He’d left Dean, too.
“You want me to carry you, too?” Castiel suggested, challenged by the glint in Dean’s eyes. Not waiting for a reply, he hoisted a laughing Dean over his shoulder and carried him to the bed, smacking his ass once before dropping him on the mattress.
Both Dean and Jimmy looked up in surprise and then started to protest, but Castiel shushed them. “Just think about it. The shelters are currently overflowing and somewhere there’s a poor little ball of fluff just waiting for us.” He made his lip quiver a bit. “And we could definitely use some more joy right now, right? Just think about having a cat stroking up against your legs while you’re cooking, or cuddling up next to you on the sofa. Or having someone to play with while two of us are busy.”
“Ok, one, ew, and two, you couldn’t drink the peppermint anyway.” Dean reached for his cup, which seemed to be simple black coffee, judging by the glimpse Castiel got through the hole in the lid.
“No.” Castiel shut him down immediately.
“They do though,” Dean said, sounding contrite. “Cas, you know they do.”
Castiel sighed and stopped, cupping Dean’s cheek and giving him a quick kiss. “Kneel,” he whispered in his ear and ruffled his hair affectionately. As soon as he’d stepped away to get in front of the screen again, Dean sank down gracefully and inaudibly, hands behind his back, looking at Castiel for approval. When Castiel smiled and nodded, Dean smiled back and then averted his gaze, looking down.
“That bitch!” Mildred exclaimed before she slapped her hand over her mouth. “Sorry, Castiel, I mean no disrespect…”
on November 8th, at 2am?” Dean parroted.
“I am happy to be here,” Dean replied, then he added a soft, “With you.”
Dean just moaned, opening up for another kiss. “Does feel good,” he admitted silently.
“Just my leg,” Castiel replied in jest, before realizing what he was admitting to.
“Oh,” Castiel bit his tongue to keep from smiling too hard. He took another drink to hide his smirk.
“And you want to be next?” Castiel asked, before he could stop himself.
Castiel looked at Dean with a raised eyebrow, but when Dean shrugged, he untied the goon from the chair. Frankie fell down to his knees, crying and thanking Castiel for not hurting him, but Castiel felt no relief himself. He’d come too close. If Dean hadn’t intervened… He looked down at the snivelling man coldly and made a mental note to ask Henriksen to  pick him up before he could tip off Lilith.
“It’s my title,” Castiel replied. “‘Special Agent Novak.’ You’d better… you should show me some respect.” Inside, Castiel was furious. Mostly at himself, for losing his composure this quickly.
Jimmy nodded. “Yeah, ‘s what I thought.” He came closer and Castiel fought hard to stand his ground and not flinch back. “Rumor has it you’re the only person who knows what he looks like. And make no mistake, they will find a way to take you down so you might as well give him up.”
It didn’t help that he was also really fucking sore from Friday night. Pleasantly so, in a way, but… every movement was a reminder of his fuck up. How could he have allowed himself such a grave mistake? Castiel had been a perfect assistant. Always pleasant, reliable, charming but able to cut off customers Dean didn’t want to speak to. And on top of it, he was just super nice to look at, when Dean allowed himself a peak outside his office. Or when he came in to bring Dean his requested files - and even more so, when Cas came in to take care of him. Refill his water. Remind him of his lunch. He truly was an angel.
He knew neither Dean nor Jimmy actively wanted to sabotage his career, but he had to be strict and make sure this wouldn’t repeat itself. Though he had a feeling Dean had just wanted to be punished in the first place. He wasn’t dumb. He knew Cas wouldn’t thank them, but he should’ve found another way to rile Cas up. They would have to have a talk tomorrow. Today was for corporal punishment, though.
He wondered if he should maybe get his affairs in order and pack instead, but he had faith. Or rather, he had a little more faith in Cas and Jimmy finding a way to arrest Jimmy’s partner than he had in said partner really letting Cas off the hook so long as he retired to a tropical island with a bunch of money in his account, courtesy of her.
Dean’s eyebrows raised in surprise. He held up his flask. “Water?” He repeated and the alien nodded his head.
“Alright. You should get more sleep, Dean. Your body still needs to heal.” Castiel unconsciously scratched at his still bare chest, only aware when Dean’s eyes were tracking the movement.
The alien smiled and said something in return. Dean sat up and knee walked to look up out of their shelter. Two suns up in the sky. They warmed the earth and Dean was grateful for it. Now that he was awake, he could feel how much the cold had crept into his bones the night before. He slid out and sat in the direct sun for a few minutes, joined by his alien companion.
Castiel was impressed. All he’d gotten for his tenth birthday was nothing. Nobody remembered. But even if they had, there definitely wouldn’t have been presents as fine as this one. Silver. Wait. Silver! He pointed at his notes. “Actually, my book here mentions silver, as well. Apparently one crew defeated a snake by feeding it a casket of molten silver.”
Dean tilted his head. More shirts? “I took care of this one.” He pointed towards the table.
Castiel’s hand was on his cheek, bringing him out of his thoughts. “Sorry I am causing you so much trouble,” Castiel apologized. “Maybe I deserve to go to jail for failing my charges. So just… don’t bother.”
“Do you regret it?” Dean asked.
Castiel raised his eyebrows. He hadn’t expected this much criminal energy out of Mildred. Having Meg out for the night would definitely help Dean meet his contact and Castiel get the books. “Are you sure you’d be willing to do this for us?”
Dean almost chokes on the sob that escapes him and then he‘s embracing Cas so hard that it hurts. “You asshole. You stupid asshole,” he mutters.
He had to admit that he finally saw the appeal. One reason why Dean was sent on this assignment had been his very vocal disdain whenever anyone had mentioned the Fallen Angels. So his boss decided she better send someone neutral to get the real scope instead of a fanboy. But actually witnessing Castiel - and the rest of the band to be fair - play a live gig was a whole other thing than hearing their post grunge emo shit on the radio. It felt much more raw, much more emotional.
“What?” Castiel frowned, suddenly flustered. He didn’t mean it like that, surely? But he couldn’t stop the sudden mental image of a naked Dean Winchester behind bars in a private dungeon, and for fuck’s sake. Castiel ground his teeth when he could see Winchester’s smile widening; he would not let a suspect play him. “It’s Special Agent,” he corrected, knowing it was a lame comeback.
“I dunno, Cas. Why do you do anything?” Dean passed a hand over his face. “Ok, fuck.” He turned towards his crew. “Disarm him. We’re taking him with us. And let’s proceed slowly.”
“Unsanitary,” Dean wrinkled his nose.
Jimmy looked a second away from throwing it down and murdering Cas, but he complied anyway. Castiel smiled and stilled, taking out his fingers and carefully inserting the vibrator alongside his cock. He hissed when he realized how cold it was. Next time he’d definitely find a way to warm it up, even if he was just using it on Dean. But it helped to stave off his own impending orgasm, and Dean didn’t seem to complain, either.
“Wherever you end up, take Dean with you. You two need each other,” Mildred advised, touching Castiel’s cheek in a motherly way before she turned to open the door again.
Suddenly, he heard a “Dean! Be smart about this!” and his head whipped in the direction it was coming from. Ana was trying to hold Dean back, but he shook her off and jumped on board the pirate ship, something in his hand.
“I like your tea,” Dean replied, pulling Castiel in by the collar of his shirt for a real kiss.
The next morning, Castiel woke up from the weirdest dream. Naomi had visited him, deeply displeased. She accused him of sharing his grace with a lowly human and warned him that if he wouldn’t stop, he’d be cut off from Heaven.
“Sure,” Dean replied, holding out one hand.
The next day, Castiel insisted they go back to their ships. He needed to check if there was anything else to salvage from them, now that it appeared they would be spending a considerable amount of time on this planet.
“Yeah.” Castiel nodded. “I understand.” It was quite frankly too much for him as well. But Dean had… he’d said it back and… Castiel cradled him close and was ready to just hold him for a while when he felt Dean sneak a hand between them to start jerking him off. “Oh.”
“Oh no, Dean,” Castiel pulled back a little so he could kiss Dean’s forehead, then his nose and then both cheeks. “You’re perfect. Absolutely perfect how you are. I am sorry that I mistreated you.”
“Yes.” Castiel smiled a little and Dean held him a tighter.
“Good morning, Sam,” Castiel greeted.
It was as much a statement as it was a question and Dean smiled back. “In between lying in the sun in Costa Rica.”
“It would be safer for you to use your powers to their full potential, darling.” Balthazar didn’t even hesitate with his retort. “You might’ve been able to save some of the others, too.”
Dean stopped him, reaching up to cup his cheeks. “Me too,” he whispered, hoisting himself up for a lingering kiss.
“Because you’re such a horrible person?” Dean still wanted to know if Castiel was the diva some made him out to be. But usually he would not just go out and ask. He mentally kicked himself and his big mouth on drugs.
Dean laughed. “If I wasn’t convinced your mom would poison my drink for it, I’d bring you with me in a heartbeat.”
“You’ll never know,” Castiel winked and licked his lips slowly, deliberately.
With a smile, Dean trailed his fingertips over Castiel’s chin and up his cheek, admiring his handsome face. After a whole bunch of nasty operations, Dean had lucked out this time. This operation had led him to Cas, and he would forever be grateful.
Dean came immediately, crying out, legs giving out on him. Castiel stroked him through it while Dean rutted against his hand and the bedsheets, still spurting a few drops. When he was done, Castiel crawled back up on the bed, blanketing him, pressing kisses to his neck and hair. Dean was still moving his hips and Castiel couldn’t help but thrust against him, the friction against his cock delicious. This wasn’t part of the plan, though, and punishment for Jimmy wasn’t over yet. But he indulged for a few more minutes.
He still remembered the last time, with Balthazar. Anna had had to lock him in his room until it was over. And he hadn’t been fertile again for years. It required a deep emotional connection. A bond and a willingness to share a life. Why was Dean not more happy about this? It was a gift. And to receive on the first try!
“No. I don’t want you to face him alone, either.” Castiel surprised himself with his outburst, even more so because he meant it. God dammit. He didn’t want Dean or Ana or Charlie to die. Not even Benny. And he’d only known these people for a few days. “Nobody should die at the hands of the Kraken.”
“Believe me, I’d struggle even more if you were all around me to distract me,” Castiel admitted, taking the cartoon of milk after Dean was done and adding what felt like half a mug full.
He sounded certain of it, so Castiel mirrored Dean, cupping his cheek as well, before he leaned forward for a sweet kiss. Dean smiled against his lips and they laid down again, continuing to kiss and lazily explore each other’s chests and backs without any urgency until their movements slowed down to a full stop and they fell back asleep.
“You ok?” Dean asked, picking up on it, of course.
.” ‘You miserable skank,’ he silently added. He should’ve cut off Meg a while ago. She was getting too presumptuous.
“See?” Castiel said. “That’s what I mean. That’s why you’re a great boss.” He tapped his fingers on the table, considering. “What if we tell them we were afraid to come clean because we’re gay and there might be harrassment.”
“It’s in my car. Come on,” Jimmy stressed.
“You did crash my Farm,” Castiel replied, but he added another wink and touched Dean’s cheek. “And I’m thankful for it,” he added.
Once he had found a good rhythm, Castiel turned it on to a low setting and cursed, “Fuck, that feels good.” He looked at Jimmy and he wasn’t even exaggerating for show. “This is so nice, Jimmy. Man, I wish you could feel it, too. This is almost better than having your cock stroke mine.”
“I don’t think my ego could handle it,” Castiel mumbled, sliding down the bed and pushing Dean’s legs up and apart a bit so he could kneel between them. Dean stayed still as Castiel spread his cheeks and then just immediately went to town, licking and sucking on Dean’s rim without further warning.
Dean hesitated, but then he shrugged. “Gonna let me pick the flavors?”
“You can have it back later,” Castiel rolled his eyes. “Thief. Should’ve known.”
“Fuck,” Castiel cursed, faltering in his methodical movements. With his free hand, he pulled Dean back by his hair and kissed him again. “Can’t get enough of this either,” he confessed, biting Dean’s lower lip, which already felt swollen. “Gonna be so hard to be around you all day, not able to kiss you.”
When Dean came back, he was dressed in nice slacks and a form-fitting dress shirt. It was a far cry from the casual jeans and flannel Castiel was used to by now, and he couldn’t help but let his eyes rake up and down Dean’s body in appreciation.
Castiel pouted, tangling a hand in Dean’s hair and pulling him off. “Stay the night and I’ll help you carry your hoard.”
would do well to remember that.”
Dean focused on making eggs once again, which seemed to have turned into his unofficial duty around here. Breakfast was not a community event such as dinner because they all had different shifts and routines, some of them eating before yoga and others after. People just came and grabbed it as they could.
“Yeah, right,” Dean snorted. “As if I would leave you here.” He looked at the fallen branches and grabbed a sturdy, straight one, fitting it to Castiel’s leg. Dean used the sharp stone to break off the part that was too long, then took off his shirt and began ripping it apart.
Dean scratched the back of his neck and avoided Castiel’s gaze. “Ideally, they’re gonna set you free on bail. I’ll definitely make a plea for you. But a judge will have to decide if there’s a case against you or not first.” Dean placed a hand on Castiel’s knee in a comforting gesture. “But again, I will do my best to spare you all of this. There really shouldn’t be anything to pin on you.”
“For how long?” Dean asked, feeling a deep pit open in his stomach.
“I…” Castiel hesitated. “I do. I love you, Dean.” He trailed his fingertips over Dean’s cheekbone. “I’m sorry if this is freaking you out. I know it’s soon and you don’t have to say any…”
Sam was coming to his aid and together they wrestled him down to the ground. “No, Dean. No.” Castiel felt bad for doing so, but he gripped Dean’s wrist hard, digging into the pressure points until he lost the grip on his sword. Sam immediately snatched it and threw it behind them.
“More time to spend with you.” Castiel shrugged. “It’s not like I have anyone to come home to.” He tilted his head. “Well, I guess that would be you then, so if you work longer, we’re both missing out on this.”
Castiel grew bolder again, seeing how much of Dean he could swallow. His hand was playing with Dean’s balls, gently rolling them, his other placed on Dean’s stomach, ready to push him down if need be. But there was no need. Dean held himself back and let Castiel take the lead while continuing to compliment him.
There was this word again. Sex. So Castiel had interpreted it wrong before, apparently. Weird. “Of course I know. We have a connection.”
“Jesus,” Dean raised his eyebrows. “You really are a fan, huh? You’re usually not that pushy.”
“It definitely wasn’t my idea to just fall asleep,” Dean teased him, the smile on his lips obvious from his cadence.
“Don’t be stupid.” Guy Two reached for the other’s arm to hold him back. “We have to work together. Please. We can help each other.”
Castiel nuzzled his neck. “Goodnight, Dean.”
“Oh Jesus Christ.” Dean hid his face in his hands. But aside from the mortification, he was surprised that his heart was fluttering. So Castiel knew more about him than Dean expected and he still sought him out. In a way, they were on the same level. Having read about the other and connecting in person. He still wasn’t sure about their future, but this was… not a bad start.
Castiel‘s lips twitch upwards briefly. “Surely I wasn’t that important,” he says, looking down.
Castiel grinned at him. “Alright, I’ll give you a hint. It’s based on a real person. And as the song also stated, they have blue eyes and a mop of messy black hair to bury your fingers in.” And right on queue, Castiel passed his hands through
They’d reached the exit of the building and Dean insisted on going out first, gun raised. He looked up and down the street, scaring a late night pedestrian into running off in the other direction, but all seemed to be quiet.
He provided Dean with a communications device and, without revealing where he was located, Dean was able to reach out to his own command and set up negotiations. During those meetings, Castiel was present as well, to act as a translator, only needing Dean to explain the words he still didn’t know. Mary probably would’ve been able to pluck them from Dean’s mind, but they made sure she’d stayed hidden until a peace agreement was reached.
Castiel beamed. “It’s good to know I have an ally. You care, Dean. I am so glad you joined us.”
. “I like taking care of you, Dean.”
That would make it easier for Jimmy to live without Castiel. And Castiel had Dean. But… Fuck.
“Ok, Angel,” Dean agreed and Castiel cocked his head. Interesting. Dean had also responded to commands beautifully on Friday night, but Castiel hadn’t put too much thought in it, too lost in the throes of passion himself. But he could work with that.
“Oh, right,” Dean replied, chagrined, and followed those orders as well. On their way to the elevator, they got a few curious looks and Dean realized he definitely wasn’t used to leaving when other people were still in the office. But Castiel gave everyone a nasty look and nobody commented anything.
Dean looked around the kitchen with big eyes, actual food forgotten, until he suddenly cursed and turned around to take care of the eggs. “I… I’d like that,” he mumbled, looking down at the skillet. He eventually turned off the stove and faced Castiel again, a slight smirk on his face. “I promise to take better care with the food from now on, too.”
Castiel’s displeased scowl only deepened. “Plans change, Meg.”
Castiel narrowed his eyes. “Just stop.” He was not talking to his brother about his crush. They were definitely not back to that stage in their relationship. Not that they ever were, because fucking Jimmy himself had been his crush growing up.
“Thank you for your trust,” Sam beamed at her and sat down. “Any idea who’s been trying to kill you?”
Apparently another hunter had been tracking these two vampires and their license plate had just been registered in a parking violation two towns over. Since it was early in the day, the vampires would be hunkered down. But the other hunter was too far out to reach them in time.
He was fiddling with said ring when Dean peeked over his shoulder. They were sharing a shabby apartment for the duration of the mission and had moved in the day before. “Shit. You know how to use all of these?”
Dean lands in a heap right before Rowena’s throne.
.” But he appreciated that Dean would be willing to make such a huge sacrifice to make him happy.
When he slowed down and focused more on his surroundings, Dean realized that Mildred was currently walking around the main tables, offering refills on the community tea. This wasn’t that unusual, but so far, he hadn’t seen Mildred do it herself. By the time she reached Meg, Mildred suddenly stumbled and poured a lot of tea straight into her soup bowl.
“Alright,” Dean agreed, rolling away and stretching himself. He made a face. “I think I should take another quick shower.”
Castiel’s smile vanished only to be replaced by a sad look. “That would definitely not be what I want.”
“Tell me about it.” Castiel sighed. “I’m sorry for making it worse.”
Dean shrugged with a grin. “Can’t blame me for trying.”
Dean ate the sandwich during lunch—Castiel had surreptitiously glanced into his office and spotted him eating—and his yoghurt at around three. A healthy snack. Castiel took it as good progress.
“I do,” Ana confirmed. “But I doubt they’d fit you now.” She raked her eyes over Sam’s body slowly and deliberately, causing Sam to squirm. “We’ll see about that after I care for the wounded. Dean, do get us out of here.”
“No,” Castiel quickly declined. “I’m sorry, I know you mean well, but no.” Maybe he could become an IT security consultant instead. His background might actually even help with that. Looking around his trailer he suddenly realized how much more money he could earn. But wait. They’d only talked about the past. “So what about now? Am I in the clear for Odin’s activities?”
“No, Dean. If I were to do any of that, I’d find a way. Probably get a warrant and then do it while we have your phone in custody,” Jimmy told him, sounding casual.
Castiel raised his eyebrow. “Snuck off to the kitchens and lied about it?”
“We’re not sure yet if she’s skimming donations or if she found another way to rob our members,” Castiel told her. “I tried to get the books earlier to give them to Dean, hoping he would be able to read them, but I couldn’t.” He shrugged. “Meg was already in the office and wouldn’t leave.”
“Of course it is,” Dean replied, sliding it under the counter before looking back up. “Thank you,” he added, after a long pause.
When they were done eating, Dean leaned back in his chair and patted his stomach. “That was a good burger, but I think I‘m too full for strenuous activity now.“ Even though his cock was at half mast ever since Castiel had been moaning over his burger.
Dean chuckled, watching them settle down and wondering how he’d survive getting double teamed by two of them.
Dean avoided a direct answer, because he wasn’t sure he could lie about this. “I don’t appreciate being used like that. And for what? To make your groupies jealous?”
“You look like the enemy.” Dean replied.
It hurt to see Castiel being led off in a full set of cuffs, but Dean couldn’t dwell on it. He made his way to a bail agency and set up a bond, putting down $10.000 in cash as collateral. It was all his savings, but Castiel wouldn’t run. He would get it back once Castiel showed up for his actual trial.
“Thanks, Cas.” Sam smiled. “You want to fill us in on your progress?”
“Jimmy can stand in his corner a little longer,” Castiel replied, unbothered, and freed his cock just enough for him to guide it between Dean‘s plush lips. Dean immediately took him deep and started sucking, his hands clasped at his back again without Cas even giving him a command. He raked his fingers over Dean‘s scalp and scratched at his neck in a reward, leaning back and enjoying it.
After filing his report and noting that Garth had left before Dean had a chance to arrange protective detail - leaving out the part about breakfast - he checked the full forensics report on his bike messenger. It didn’t offer any new clues. But he decided to cross reference it with a few other unsolved murders to see if they were missing something. Would’ve helped if Jessica had provided him with names of the victims she thought were connected. He’d have to call his brother later to get those.
“No.” Castiel pointed a warning finger in his reaction.
, Dean,” Castiel replied. “My sweet, perfect boy. I am so happy I found you.” He pulled out his come covered hand and looked at it, then gave Dean an inquisitive glance.
As soon as Dean was awake enough to groan and slip a hand into Castiel’s hair, he really made an effort.aking Dean deep, he swallowed around him, relishing in the feeling of him growing to full hardness between his lips. He had to pull off to breathe and swirled his tongue around his head before sucking just the tip between his lips and rhythmically tapping his tongue against it. Then he opened his lips and licked his way down the big vein of his cock, nosing against his balls before he licked back up and focused on the head again.
They sat side by side, munching on their respective salads—Dean’s not containing any meat but Castiel could spot some edamame and sprouts, which he’d barely sprinkled with his brown dressing that came on the side—while Castiel decided to turn on the TV. It was still set to his documentary channel, but he switched, trying to find something more entertaining.
“So, what are we fighting and how do I kill it?” Castiel asked, trying to sound light.
“Ew,” Sam protested loudly. “Not before I’ve had some food in me, you guys.”
“But there was something…” Dean prodded. “A moment. I could tell.”
In the office, Castiel frowned at him when he just handed him a travel mug to put in the fridge and declined his coffee. He’d only be drinking juice and water for the next few days. Time for a detox. He’d added extra cayenne pepper in his juice for lunch and that should give him an energy boost.
“Good boy,” Castiel praised, patting his shoulder and Dean couldn’t help an involuntary shudder. As much as he hated this, he did like pleasing Castiel.
Castiel wasn’t sure if Dean was bluffing or not, but it sure worked. Balthazar pouted. “You wouldn’t.” When Dean didn’t back down from his stare, Balthazar sighed. “Fine. You’re both no fun. What a great match.” He walked over towards a part of the store and pointed towards a stack of what seemed to be photographs. “Here’s your precious clue. I’ll be taking my leave now. Don’t do anything fun without… oh, nevermind.” He smirked again and then vanished into thin air.
“I love you unconditionally,” Castiel replied, crawling half-on the bed so he could give Dean a soft kiss. Then he pulled back. “Remember that for the next twenty.” He winked and Dean groaned, burying his face back in the pillow.
“No, I…” Dean flushed. Consecutive rooms. Right. He slumped down a little in his seat.
Though nobody should know that Chaos was Loki. Castiel deliberately didn’t touch any of his old codes. But he wasn’t stupid either. He still had a unique style. Couldn’t be helped. And maybe he should’ve strayed further with his new alias. But… Odin had chosen him. It meant something. Before he knew she was probably even younger than him. For that she was freakishly talented though.
“I came to an understanding with Rowena a while ago.” Dean shrugged, not elaborating further.
In reply, Cas raised his eyebrow. But then he gave a small nod and got up, walking over to where his brother was sitting in the armchair, and without further delay, he straddled Jimmy and claimed his lips in a deep, hungry kiss.
“Oh,” Castiel shrugged. “Whatever. Just bring him by. Or tell Bobby and see if we have some time before the concert.”
Dean was playing music and singing along off-key and Castiel recognized a few of the songs from the mixtape Dean had made him, which was securely lodged into the tape deck in his Lincoln Continental.
“Oh,” Cas shrugged a little. “Mostly I just funneled money from corrupt corporations or occasionally individuals and put it to better use.”
Castiel scrambled to pick it up from where it had skidded, since his own dagger didn’t do any good. But by the time he’d reached it and turned around, he could only watch in horror as the snake rapidly descended on Dean.  He just narrowly managed to catch Ana’s dagger, which she’d thrown at him, before the snake swallowed him whole and then retreated back into the water.
For a second, Castiel wondered if he’d had any weird porn open that Dean could have seen, but then he remembered handing Dean his phone after he’d looked up the psychologist. Instead of prompting Dean, Castiel waited patiently for him to phrase his request.
That night, he even slept ok. But upon waking up, he was still feeling a little guilty over that burger and the cold fries he’d eaten last Friday night when they were done but not ready to leave yet, basking in the afterglow together. So Dean started his Tuesday by going on a juice cleanse. As an additional bonus, it would even save him time during lunch break and he could catch up on the work he’d missed the previous day.
a benefit.” Cas gave him a poignant look, before he winked and grinned, giving him a small kiss on the lips.
There was that word again. Why would they need this contraption if they had a healer? Unless they really didn’t. “How long does it stay on?” he asked.
Grumbling to himself, Castiel went to get his blend for Dean. He was too good at mixing those teas. The detox had obviously worked wonders. He poured Dean a mug and watched him with a raised eyebrow, daring him to complain. But Dean just met his gaze over the rim of the mug and dutifully drank it.
His father had been absent his whole life. And his mother had turned him over to an orphanage when he’d been four. But the nuns raising him had been extremely strict. Thankfully he was a quick study and the Navy had provided a way out, otherwise he might have ended up on the other side of the law, just the same.
?” Her expression changes to one of fear and she takes a step back. “Oh fuck. We’ve been warned we might be expecting you, but… I didn’t think I…” She trails off. “I thought I’d at least get a heads-up it would be me.”
“That’s sad, honestly,” Dean replied, sitting back on his haunches and crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Castiel’s shivers slowly subsided and he fell asleep in Dean’s arms.
“Wait. This was... an accident?” She looks around, waving her hand and the rebar appears behind Dean again. Dean instinctively flinches away, getting a little angry.
“Anything I need to know?” Dean asked.
Dean didn’t see Castiel again until the next night. Another city, another show. And Dean was really turning into a fan. He almost crossed lines to watch it all from the audience and not just from the sidelines. He definitely had to do that when his brother came to the show.
“Mmm,” Cas hummed. “Little worn out.” He smiled, eyes still closed, and rubbed his head against Dean’s chin, reminding him of a satisfied cat. “But ‘m fine.”
Perfect. Castiel smiled and fired an enthusiastic email back, thanking Chuck for his hospitality and telling him how proud he was that he’d made it there and was living the good life, away from his toxic family. They’d had him extracted from the Farm over a year ago. Chuck had been one of Castiel’s earliest supporters and inhabitants, resistant to deprogramming mostly because Castiel hadn’t done much to
Castiel winked. “Yeah, I was thinking along those lines.” He leaned in closer, almost brushing Dean’s lips and hovering for a few seconds before he pulled back. Dean was left with his eyes closed, lips slightly parted, definitely expectant. But his face fell into a pout when he sensed Castiel had pulled back.
‘Are you not a package deal? ;)’ Charlie shot back.
“Thanks for saving me, Cas,” he says.
“What is it?” Castiel joined him, kneeling down in front of him and placing a hand against Dean’s temple. “I can’t find anything wrong?”
“They cut us off. Disowned us, refused to pay for college, no more allowance,” Cas shrugged. “At that moment, I didn’t care. It felt freeing. But we had to find a way to make money on our own then. That semester was already paid for, but the next would be hard. So we both applied for jobs. When it became clear we would still need more, I was going to drop out, work full time and let Jimmy finish first. I hadn’t actually told him yet, just that I was working on a plan and not to worry.”
“So what you’re saying is, you used my computer to make the world a better place?” Dean rephrased, because that was what it sounded like to him.
“Yes.” Dean was confident. “He knows you’re not Ruby and what we have doesn’t compare to what he thought he had at all. He’ll get over it and come on board.”
“Yes, yes,” Castiel chanted, doing his best to meet Dean’s thrusts. “So good, Dean.”
“Your family ditch you, too?” It was out of Dean’s mouth before he could think it through. His eyes landed on the bag again and he noticed that seemed to be filled to the brim with clothes. When he focused back on Cas himself he could see his eyes fill with unshed tears. Shit.
He looked at Cas to find his face full of hope and… was that love? “Ok,” Cas simply said. “Yeah, ok.”
What if he had a heart attack? Or a stroke? Castiel had made sure that he’d actually eaten his lunch at 2 pm, after Dean had waved him off repeatedly starting at noon. Good thing he usually only ate a salad. Nothing that could get cold. Castiel had also repeatedly refilled his ginger water, so Dean should survive. But Castiel still feared that he would just keep working right into the weekend and then some.
“If we stay here, we’re sitting ducks,” Dean replied, pulling out his badge and hanging it around his neck.
“Should I be worried?” Dean raised an eyebrow.
“Can I stop if you’re wrong?” Dean bargained, finally getting up as well.
“Oh, like all of your furniture is sex proof,” Castiel growled, looking back and forth between Dean and various places in his kitchen, probably considering where to move this to.
“It can wait. Let me help,” Castiel pleaded. The other sailors were eyeing him warily. Ana came to join the group, as well.
“Evidence,” Meg replied casually.
Rubbing his back seemed to soothe Castiel a little, at least, and he closed his eyes, breathing deeply through his nose. The moans of pain stopped and he seemed to calm down. Maybe this was Castiel freaking out, but definitely not the birth. Dean just started to feel relieved when suddenly something dropped down into the clothes and…
“You’re gonna get more flexible, for one,” Castiel replied.
“What if we just don’t tell HR?” Castiel suggested.
about it? Can we not just… invite him over and see where it’s going?” Dean bit his lip.
He was surprised when Castiel collected various thorns and vines, stripping those down to their fibers once they were back in the cave. But it all made sense when he started to rip apart the fabric they’d carried over from the ships and stitch it back together.
“Alright, time to move,” Dean announced and Castiel realized that the second sun was about to set, as well. Dean helped him up, then gave him a longer, sturdier branch to lean on.
They quickly formed a plan. It was haphazard and heavily relied on Sam, but it was better than trying to shoot their way out again.
Castiel bit his lip, unsure if he should admit to it or if that would get her in trouble. “I snuck off.”
“She offered to help,” Castiel said, once again not elaborating further. But at Dean’s sharp look, he shrugged and walked over to the kitchen, opening the cupboard with the teas and taking out a bundle for Dean. “She caught me perusing this for you and I told her.”
“Good to know,” Dean replied, cringing when Castiel raised his eyebrow.
Dean let out a pitiful, wounded whine. “I was hungry.” He pouted.
With a bright smile, Dean answered his phone. “Sammy, hey! Are you about to get on your plane?”
“Ok?” Jimmy asked, but when Castiel didn’t react, he didn’t prod further. “So… we should try and find out who really set up that account, but I have a feeling we both know who that was.”
“Look who’s talking. You think I went in here intent on hooking up with the leader of the goddamn cult I am investigating?” Dean snarked back.
“Or I’ll tie you to this bed until you are,” Dean threatened.
“Oh,” Dean frowned. “So you’ll have to go take care of all of them?” He’d be loath to lose his special treatment, but he couldn’t keep Cas from his duties.
Ruby snorted. “Yeah, right.” She nudged him. “Taking Castiel off the market for good should definitely have earned you some death threats.”
Castiel frowned. “Wouldn’t that hurt you?”
Jo rolled her eyes. “Maybe you’ll finally get lucky and he’ll blow you in gratitude.”
“Alright. I’ll give you all I have on Lilith. I heard she’s now in bed with Alastair, but I didn’t want to believe it.” Bela looked disgusted. “But from what you’re telling me, it’s time to cut ties.” She got out her phone and started typing. Without looking up, she added, “And speaking of, just release poor Frankie, here. I think he’s learned his lesson about staying loyal.”
“If you let me in, I’ll make it quick.” The mysterious man on the other side tried, before there was another bang against the door.
Castiel groaned and let go of Dean’s hand so he could pull him closer as he deepened the kiss. Dean wasted no time in ridding him of his shirt and Castiel followed suit, pulling and tugging on Dean’s shirt until it was off. Pulling away a little to look his fill, Castiel was surprised to find Dean’s skin marred with a vast number of interesting scars, as well. No shrapnel or gunshot wounds like his own, but Dean was definitely not unblemished.
“Miss Moore is in the database,” Dean supplied. “She was booked for possession of illegal drugs.”
Sam’s face lit up and he waved at Ana. “She’s right. They might come try to rescue me.”
“Oh shit,” Cas cupped his cheek. “Dean, I’m sorry. That was insensitive.”
“Oh, but I really do.” Dean sidled up more closely, placing his hands on Castiel’s hips. “What are you gonna do to me, Special Agent Novak? Are you gonna test your interrogation skills on me, to see if you still got it?”
“Is it?” Castiel challenged. “How do I know you’re not playing me to close your case. Pin something on me.”
“Just read it, ok?” Dean narrowed his eyes and reached for the quill and a new piece of parchment. “I’ve got a few more where that one came from.”
Dean bit his lip. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have said anything.”
Ana touched his arm. “I will be. Just need a little sustenance.”
Dean hesitated. Eat the food, where Castiel could see him? He wouldn’t be able to refuse it and just pretend he was eating by picking around with his fork before he could get to his stashed protein bars in his own room.
Sam smiled at him slyly and nodded at Cas. “Did you find what you were looking for?”
“Like hell, you will.” Dean raised an eyebrow. “Get comfortable and I’ll be right back.”
“Why should I?” Castiel asked.
Cas was peeking up at him and Dean could tell he really wanted to accept, but he wouldn’t allow himself to do so. Asking for help made you weak. It’s how Dean grew up, too. It was such bullshit. So as soon as Cas opened his mouth again, Dean beat him to it.
Dean was left on the ground staring after the main protagonist in the story he was supposed to write. Who wasn’t at all the diva he expected. He was, however, a lot more attractive in person. He slumped back down and stared up at the sky. He could really get in trouble at this tour.
“Promise.” Cas straightened up and added more lube before he finally allowed himself to sink into Dean—while looking straight at Jimmy, who had returned. It was a struggle not to close his eyes, because no matter how stretched out Dean was, or how many times they did this, it always felt wonderful.
Well, it was about as good an invitation as Dean was going to get. With a grateful smile he made his way over to the table. “Hey there,” Dean smiled. “Mind if I join you? It’s really crowded today.”
Castiel nodded.
And Dean isn’t quite sure anymore if
He got Dean boxers and an old, worn tee shirt along with fresh towels and a new toothbrush before he sent him into the bathroom. Meanwhile, Castiel changed his own clothes in the bedroom and waited for Dean to come back out. Usually he took a shower to wash off the day, but that could wait until tomorrow. It made him too anxious to think about leaving Dean alone for too long.
Castiel sat back, one eyebrow raised. “What is the question?”
After a while, Cas’ sobs subsided and he pulled back to reach for a tissue and blow his nose. Dean was glad that his box was conveniently located close to where he watched TV. For reasons. His shirt was soaked where Cas clung to him, but he didn’t mind.
“You can’t know that.” Dean pushed his way in when Castiel was done and cleaned himself up as well. This was not the aftermath Castiel had planned for them. He sighed and placed his forehead against Dean’s shoulder.
Castiel usually relished those, but today it felt lackluster. He was missing Dean. There was no way Dean was ready for anything advanced, but it would sure be more fun if Castiel knew he was here to watch him. And maybe Castiel could guide him in a few more easy poses. Or just… lie out here on the mat with him, under the sun. Just touching and breathing together.
Dean closed the gap between them and pressed his lips to Cas’. At first it was just a quick peck, but before Dean could start to question himself, Cas responded and kissed him back. They both smiled too much to actually deepen it, until Cas buried a hand in Dean’s hair, scratching his scalp, and Dean let out a moan. Apparently Cas took it as an invitation to deepen the kiss and before Dean fully had time to process, he had Cas laid out under him on the couch, hands roaming and slipping underneath shirts.
“Aw man, did I miss the show?” Dean joked, but one look at Castiel had him cock his head and open his arms for Castiel to step right in.
After Dean had left, Castiel went back to his own room to freshen up as well. Then he wandered around his Farm, letting himself be seen by his followers until it was time for the mid-day meditation session, which he led. Followed by yoga, attended by those who could squeeze it into their schedule. He also led an evening yoga group.
He woke up in the middle of the night and realized this was his cue to leave. Just like planned. Get dressed and quietly slip out into the night and he’d have a very happy memory to tide him over for the next three months. But when he looked down at Dean breathing evenly next to him, lips parted and features relaxed, he just couldn’t do this. Balthazar was an idiot.
His investigating skills finally reactivated, Dean seized the opportunity to hand out lunch to the farmworkers at the orchard. It meant he got to drag a handcart up along with Alfie—and ask him questions while they were on their way.
“Oh,” Castiel breathed, finally stepping close again and wrapping his arms around him. “Come here. I’m sorry.”
“I keep trying to explain. I am tuned in to you. I know when you’re in danger. Thankfully for you by now I can differentiate between an adrenaline spike out of fear and one out of lust.” Balthazar explained.
Dean groaned and opened the vest, taking it off and looking at his chest. “That’s gonna leave a bruise.” He quirked a smile but then looked alarmed again, reaching out for Castiel’s face. “You ok? You look pale.”
Dean gave him a shy smile. “That’s what friends are for, right?”
“Can anyone corroborate this?” Castiel asked.
Castiel winced. “He didn’t say that to Dean by any chance?”
His cart set, he handed his phone back to Dean, who quickly added his own order before handing it back. “Wait, I’ll get my credit card,” Dean offered, squinting and looking around, probably wondering where he’d find his wallet.
Ana chuckled. “Thanks, but food isn’t gonna be enough this time.” She sighed and patted his cheek, then went back on deck.
“Jimmy was right. I did use your device for illegal activities,” Cas admitted. “And I’m sorry. But that’s why you’re better off without me.”
Dean seemed a little hesitant, but eventually nodded, thanking Mildred politely before she returned to the kitchen with Castiel’s special blend as the rest of his followers were served their own tea. The actual
And Dean realized where their conversations went wrong before. Now that he really thought about it, all those random incidents he kept choosing to not analyze too much made sense. Not to mention the specific talk they had after Castiel broke his leg. “Wait, so if I had broken my leg, you could have just fixed it?”
“I feel kind of worn out. Would it be ok if I just laid down for a bit?” Dean sounded unsure, as if Castiel was going to say no.
“That’s what you were supposed to think,” Dean replied, glaring at Sam. “So thanks, Sam. In case Cas ever goes back to the Navy, you just busted our whole operation.”
“No, it’s really fine,” Dean assured him. “Just sometimes I look over and I think it’s you and get really excited until I remember.”
“Thank
“I am unable to help you. Heal you.” A tear ran down Castiel’s cheek. “Protect you.”
He rubbed at his temple, realizing his head really fucking hurt, probably from the impact. Or the heat. Or, on second thought, maybe the alien had drugged him? Nah, it let him go, just now, so that wasn’t very likely.
“Dean. You passed out earlier. You will go home and relax. Eat more. Maybe a nice salmon dish? Or a steak?” Castiel suggested and Dean had to admit that sounded really good right now. But his diet…
“Alright, Dean. Well done. I’m proud of you,” Castiel praised him.
“Antarctica.” Castiel bit his lip.
Dean stopped chewing and went to stand by Castiel instead, offering silent support.
“Oh, fuck. Yeah, he hates
“That’s different. I’m the boss,” Dean replied.
Castiel raised his eyebrow but didn’t stop petting Dean’s hair. “Don’t show him that. It’ll be awkward.”
“Ok,” Cas nodded, face flushed not only from the alcohol. Dean ruffled his hair before Castiel could swat him away and they both grinned at each other before they parted. Once outside, Castiel looked back in through the windows to watch Dean work for another few minutes before he finally made his way home.
“Mhm.” Dean crossed his arms in front of his chest. “It makes me want to cut it off of you and punish you slowly.” His voice had dripped an octave and Castiel didn’t feel like he was referring to actual torture.
can call me Ana.” She whipped her hair around and gave Castiel another withering glare. “I’m not the only woman on this ship. If you have a problem with that, I have a nice plank where you can exit my ship.”
“Take in all the energy you need,” Castiel guided him, once again moving his hands up Dean’s side. “And with every breath out, expel negative thoughts.” He moved his hands down when Dean breathed out. “Energy in.” He moved his hands back up. “Negativity out.” Hands back down.
He picked up one of the pages from the spell books and looked at it, when suddenly a flashlight beam was thrust in his face and a voice commanded him, “Freeze, police.”
Jimmy smiled. “Besides, Chaos works on it. He’d find it in a heartbeat.”
Dean grinned, happy that he could affect Castiel so much, and reached back for the bowl of fruit, intent on being good and staying put until Castiel came back.
Dean bit off a ‘How did that make you feel?’ Because he felt like Castiel might expect this. “Did you take any specific actions to make sure this wouldn’t happen again?”
Oh. Castiel stared in awe when suddenly, the snake’s whole throat started bleeding the black ooze, then broke apart, revealing a gap into the snake’s insides - and Dean jumped out, landing on top of the snake’s body covered in black goo, gripping the dagger victoriously. He threw them both a feral grin, the effect somehow ruined by all the black goo. But before Castiel could breathe a sigh of relief, the snake’s body got caught in a maelstrom and was sucked down and they could only watch as Dean went under himself.
“No, it’s…” Castiel trailed off. It was not ok. “Is he bothering you? I can talk to him.” He would, for Dean.
Dean blinked and Castiel knew he was trying to process this. It was ok. Castiel knew he wasn’t normal. He just didn’t care anymore. “But it would be on your list now?” Dean asked.
Maybe if Castiel wouldn’t denounce his gifts, he’d have already crossed paths with her and this would’ve saved them some time. Or so Balthazar snidely insisted. Castiel just cursed his life once again, pulled on the rest of his clothes from this morning, donned his trench coat and made his way over to Jessica’s shop, hoping to find some answers.
Dean shrugged. “Yeah, eh. I was malnutritioned and impressionable.”
“Egg?” Dean blanched. Did he mean in his species males have a womb or… Oh fuck, what had he been thinking hooking up with an alien?
“Why…” Castiel started but Dean shut him up with another kiss. Thankfully Cas hadn’t been wearing his trench coat, so Dean just had to pull his shirt out of his pants to get his hands on Castiel’s skin. He felt feverish and like only Cas was the balm he needed.
allergic to peppermint?” He’d only heard this about peanuts, but then again, his only allergy was to cats. He’d never actually read up on allergies in general. “Is that why you use the disgusting toothpaste?” Dean suddenly realized.
Dean narrowed his eyes. He did. He’d worked hard so he could afford his new place and he finally had room for a tree, so of course he had one this year. But fine. He wasn’t going to stand in the way of Sam’s happiness. “Guess I’ll leave it up a little longer then so you can see it when you come for your college tour next year, huh?”
“Oh, you’re leaving?” Dean asked, trying not to sound desperate.
“God, I really hope so,” She muttered almost inaudibly. “Don’t want to collect your carcass because this dumb-ass experiment failed.”
When they were well on their way and the ghost ship was fully engulfed in flames in the far distance, he stopped to take a breath. Charlie had stayed close to him but was making her own adjustments, looking through a sextant and barking her own orders as soon as they were out of immediate harm's way.
Oh great, now he probably thought Dean was faking it. “Thanks. Then I can probably enjoy my stay more, too.” Dean closed his eyes again to not even see Castiel’s reaction, actually faking another bout of pain this time when in reality he was feeling a lot better by now, just tired.
“I wish,” Castiel muttered, glancing over to the man in question. Jo caught his gaze instead and scowled at him. That girl did not like him. She had way better instinct than Dean did. He ducked his head and was about to ask Charlie what movie when another chat window popped up.
“But…” Dean frowned. “Please. Let me do something for you.”
Dean was leaning over the toilet, moaning in misery. Castiel knelt down next to him and rubbed his back. “You ok? He asked.
“Hey, man. Can I help you?” The cute barista asked. Castiel tried to answer but failed to the point that the barista laughed. “I can recommend you a drink if you tell me what you’re generally looking for. Let’s start by coffee or tea?” Castiel still didn’t find his voice. “Hot chocolate?” The barista suggested.
“You can print that.” Castiel offered. “Wouldn’t that make a good headline?”
“God, Dean.” Castiel slid down, moving behind Dean and wrapping his arms around him so he was protected from both sides, blanket and couch in his front and Castiel plastered to his back. “I don’t even know what to say. I promise I’ll try to make it up to you and show you what a good partner is like.” He squeezed Dean a little tighter. “And I most definitely will not leave you no matter what happens with your body.”
Dean whistled appreciatively. “We gotta get you some better-fitting clothes, Special Agent Novak.”
Castiel handed Dean his mug and wondered if it would be too soon to take them to bed and cuddle. With a sigh he realized they still had things to talk about. “So you didn’t find anything, right? The Farm is a good place?” Castiel prompted, hoping he wouldn’t have to implicate Meg too obviously.
“Of course I did,” Jimmy responded. “We’ve been partners for seven years now.”
When he finally made it towards the rails, it got even more eerie. They had erected planks that seemed to be made of fog, which the ghosts used to board the Impala. But when Castiel tested one, a hole appeared in the plank right under his foot. Experimentally, he waved his poker and the plank vanished fully.
Dean was so flustered, he didn’t even know what to say. “Oh,” came out, before he clumsily tried to bow as well. Castiel had taken a hold of his hands again and started to gently wash them in the sink when Dean realized how rude he was being. “No, uh, thank you. Of course. Sorry,” he mumbled. “Thank you, Castiel.”
“Don’t think you’ll still be on this boat when that happens,” Dean groused.
Castiel set the water to boil and put his boxes back into the drawer once he’d filled his tea filter. After he’d set it up to steep, he turned towards Dean. “Should we just get this over with so we can get to the more fun parts of this evening, or do you want to wait for the tea and cuddle a little first?”
“Kept holding onto the headboard,” Castiel replied, slithering up Dean’s body and lying down on top of him, his arms stretched out over Dean’s until he could reach his hands. “You can let go now.”
He nipped and bit at Castiel’s neck until the angel growled and pushed back, manhandling Dean onto the bed. They both quickly got rid of their clothes and Castiel was getting himself ready while Dean showered him with kisses and more lovebites all the way down his chest. When he was done, Castiel looked used and debauched before they had even gotten to the good part and Dean was loving it.
he added in his mind. He wasn’t sure he could handle it.
“What? No.” No way does Dean want to go and relive stale memories. They might not even include Cas. He’d never let himself be as truly happy with him as Cas apparently was in his last moment. Everything is overshadowed by tragedy, by guilt, by repression. He can’t risk it. It would honestly be more hell than
Dean didn’t know what to say, so he just wrapped Castiel up in a hug. “Your brother sounds like a dick.”
Castiel’s eyebrow climbed higher, but there was definitely a smirk on his lips. “U-huh.” He pointed towards the nightstand. “Drink your tea then.”
“Long,” Castiel replied. “Fucking long time. You?”
“Yeah?” Castiel focused back on him.
Dean burrowed a little closer and reached behind him to pull Jimmy in. “Love you,” Dean mumbled and Castiel stroked his hair. Yeah. Dean was clearly out of it. Didn’t mean he hadn’t technically agreed to getting the cat, though. Castiel smiled and kissed Dean’s forehead, then he turned towards Jimmy.
Castiel frowned. “I want you to be healthy.”
It was not too late to fully fix things with Castiel. He could have his brother back. And Dean was pretty decent as well. Jimmy enjoyed hanging out with them for the few movie or sports nights they had. And he hadn’t even met Charlie in person yet. She sounded like a fun friend who might not even judge them for wherever this would…
“Oh, Dean,” Castiel breathed, giving him the softest look and it seemed like he was holding himself back from leaning in again. “I’ll accept, until you can find the courage to be this for yourself.” One injured hand wrapped, Castiel cupped Dean’s cheek. “I want you to be good
“Animal shelters. Environmental activist groups. LGBTQ causes.” Castiel shrugged again as if this was no big deal.
“Detective work?” Dean grinned and walked around the body in a circle, looking up at the surrounding buildings. No cameras in sight. He wasn’t surprised. He went over to check on the bike. It looked well-cared for, but Dean could see multiple points where it had been fixed. It was a light, fast bike. Perfect to navigate through these streets even in high traffic. Maybe it had a serial number and they could identify their vic a little faster that way.
“Very important asset. Fierce and loyal protector,” Dean countered and Castiel’s lips twitched.
“I still haven’t fully forgiven Jimmy yet,” Cas went on to explain. “But I hope I can. I… I missed having my brother.”
“Damn straight, I will,” The woman behind the bar agreed and set down a rum for Dean. Castiel noticed that she’d poured it from a different bottle than she had for most of the others. As soon as the girl, Joanna, left with a pout, the woman patted Dean’s cheek. “Can I get you a meal, hon?”
Dean blinks, trying to get his brain back into gear. But all it’s thinking is how much more beautiful the man is up close. The blue-eyed mystery man who is staring right back. And oh shit, this was starting to get awkward, wasn’t it?
Dean stared at him and Jimmy half expected to be thrown out. “You still can.” Dean informed him after a short pause. “I’ll recycle your cup.”
“Of course,” Dean was quick to reassure him. Hell, he really sucked at this if Cas even had to ask. “You were gone for two weeks, man.”
“Here, take this,” Castiel pressed two pills in his hand and held out a bottle of water. Dean opened his eyes and squinted, trying to guess what kinds of pills they were. But in the end, he went against everything he’d been taught and wordlessly accepted them, swallowing them down.
Castiel could parry the sword with his poker, but it was hard. This ghost seemed to have a lot more strength than the others did, and he was more solid, too. When Castiel swung his poker, he flickered but didn’t fully vanish like the others had. Well, fuck. He swung his poker again, but the ghost parried with the sword and the force of it was so strong that the poker flew out of his hands.
Dean carefully turned around and came face to face with a still sleeping Castiel. He always looked relaxed, but in sleep he was the absolute picture of serenity. And just incredibly beautiful, with his dark messy hair and the ever-growing beard.
“The goddamn navigator of this vessel.” Charlie kept her head held high. “Maybe if you wouldn’t spend so much time below deck re-reading your tomes on…”
Dean shrugged again, spoon halfway to his mouth. “What you bring me is fine.”
Castiel decided not to read too much into it, but he picked up the bowl, pressing it into Dean’s hands. “Eat,” he ordered, waiting until Dean had picked up the spoon and tried a little bit. “I hope pho is ok? I’m not too sure which foods you like?”
“Oh, come on,” Dean rolled his eyes, but he sat up a little straighter. “M’sorry. I’m good. I promise.”
Jimmy whimpered, biting his lip. “Cas, please. I promise to be good. I’ll never disturb your lessons again. I
Castiel pumped his fist in the air like he’d just won something very important and led Dean to the living room where his yoga mat was already waiting under the window. He rolled it out and insisted Dean take it, then he took up a position opposite of him on the carpet.
Dean blew out an audible breath. “Oh man, that’s hard. A lot of the bands I love don’t go on tour anymore. Tragedy of my life: I was born too late.”
Castiel’s mood improved even further when he spotted Dean all the way in the back, having hidden behind the participants but obviously having watched at least part of his session. He slowly made his way through the small crowd, making sure to bless a select few with a fleeting touch to keep them happy, before he finally arrived before Dean.
Dean took his hand again, interlacing their fingers and squeezing. Castiel smiled at him and pulled up his hand to press a kiss to the back of it, apparently not caring anymore who saw them together. Dean’s heart started hammering in his chest. It felt good to be the one to offer comfort for once.
“Oh, good. You’re smarter than your colleague. He still insists he isn’t to blame but rather you getting distracted by, and I quote, some hot piece of ass.” Charlie said.
“Safe,” he repeated again and dipped down his hand into the stream, catching some water and drinking it himself.
Even if Dean’s editor almost fired him, but that was another story. He didn’t. That’s what counted. After the tour, Castiel holed up to write his new album and Dean stayed put as well, writing CD reviews for a change. It was a great two months and in the end, a lot of Castiel’s songs probably ended up about Dean. They never talked about it, but they both just knew.
Castiel patted the top of Dean’s head. “Sorry if I overstepped?” He tried.
Mildred waved him off. “And don’t worry, I told everyone that Dean has been feeling really under the weather and you had to devote all of your time into healing him.” She winked. “And of course you’d do the same for every single one of them if they fell as ill as Dean.”
“Huh?” Dean frowned, then he realized Castiel meant before they could leave the country. “I meant now. How long before you have to leave?”
Castiel stalked closer and crowded into Dean’s space. Dean tried to hold his ground, but he involuntarily took a few steps back. He couldn’t help it. Magic still kind of scared him. When his back hit the wall, it was a wake up call and he pulled himself up to his full height, trying to tower over Castiel. “You heard me.”
It wasn’t solved yet, but he was right. Castiel basically just handed him all of the fake evidence on a silver platter. “I also found some deeds to land, I think? I threw them into the bag as well.” He paused for dramatic effect. “I just hope Meg is not gonna check the safe anytime soon. She’s gonna know it was me.”
Castiel leaves shortly thereafter and gives a small wave and Dean ends his shift excited for the next day.
“Bitch,” Dean hissed, kicking down but missing Sam’s hand by a wide margin. Castiel hoped it was an intentional miss. He followed them up as soon as Dean had reached the railing.
“Dean?” Castiel demanded his attention. “Tea?”
Castiel was speechless. Why would Dean give him the first bite? That was a high honor. And to think they were enemies just days ago. He watched him in fascination while trying his meat. He couldn’t help but let out a moan at the taste. This was… so much better than he expected. He wondered if it was the animal or the fire. But… wow.
Castiel tried to push him towards the door, but when Dean didn’t move fast enough, he untangled himself and clasped their hands to lead the way. “We’ll be back in twenty minutes,” he announced to the room before dragging Dean out of it.
“But my dreams are usually just a lot of jumbled noise and images and none of it makes sense. Last night was the only…” Castiel stopped. Wait. Did he have a premonition?
Castiel was startled out of his doze by his phone ringing. He almost ignored it. His lawyer had gotten him a cheap prepaid and left it at the station because Castiel didn’t have a phone registered under his name. The one at the Farm was under Meg’s name, obviously, so he had to leave it there. But apparently his lawyer needed a way to contact him.
Jimmy shrugged. “Yeah, actually. Do you want to know how to delete the browser history off of your phone?”
He tried to pay attention to his students with all of his focus, but Dean muffled a grunt and he had to look. Jimmy had him spread out on the table now, so Castiel had a better view of him playing with the plug, thrusting it in and out in no particular rhythm, keeping Dean on his toes, quite literally. Castiel hid behind his mug once more and watched them until he realized the background noise coming from the screen had stopped.
“No,” Jimmy admitted. “I was gonna drink it here though.”
“That he can’t have it.” He sniffs. “Can’t have…
“I’m not pinning anything on you, Meg. You’re the one who corrupted my project. You’re stealing from those poor people needing help.” Castiel raised his voice, making sure Dean could definitely hear him now.
Castiel stirred and Dean quickly pulled his hand away as if burned. But it was too late and Castiel slowly blinked his eyes open, tightening an arm around Dean at the same time, as if he was afraid Dean would leave him now that a new day had started.
When he opened his eyes again, Castiel was radiantly beaming. “Thank you for giving me this gift, Dean.” And Dean’s heart was fluttering wildly. He almost got lost in Castiel’s blue eyes, but then Castiel averted his gaze again to wrap up Dean’s other hand.
“But I didn’t.” Castiel frowned. It wasn’t sneaking on if Dean apparently willingly let him come. It suddenly dawned on him that Dean had known his secret all along, and now definitely had it confirmed. Would he tell the crew? Were they feeding him to the mermaids next? Maybe he should change strategy and plead. But… no. He had done nothing wrong. He’d followed his assignment until he realized Dean was a good man, and then he’d betrayed his Navy superiors. Surely Dean knew that.
“Dean, you’re really hurt,” Castiel admonished, placing his fingers against Dean’s temple and healing him. But because they were joined on such a profound level to begin with or maybe because Castiel was in the throes of passion or for whatever reason that didn’t really matter, it turned into so much more than just healing Dean.
“A witch?” Dean asked, eyes wide.
“In,” he commanded again, repeating his stimulations. “And out.” Dean didn’t even need to be told anymore, he was following him, taking deep and even breaths even though Castiel was distracting him. “Good boy,” he whispered. “So good for me, Dean.”
Dean Winchester would definitely be his downfall, but what a way to go.
Mildred nodded. “What about the tea?”
The alien looked at his hand and frowned, probably only now realizing that Castiel’s glove had pricked him. Castiel saw a tiny red spot on his hand. Red blood? How weird. Maybe that‘s why he was so pale. To not lose any more of his trust, Castiel clicked on the button that would retract most of his armor, only leaving his back, chest and groin protected. It was a huge sign of trust, and he hoped the alien would take it as such.
Castiel shrugged, smiling a little. Dean still cared about him. “It’s ok. She’s making it better.”
Castiel grunted. “That was the plan. But when I did that little jump, I realized how much my own thighs were burning too.” He chuckled darkly. “Next time I’ll really just sit still and let you do all the work.”
Dean kissed the top of his head and they just stayed in Jimmy’s hotel room for a little while longer before they finally left for Dean’s place.
“No.” Meg wasn’t dumb. If she suspected foul play, she might search her place and find all the evidence he’d hid and destroy it before the FBI arrived. Castiel still left enough of a paper trail to implicate her. But if she just vanished, the FBI would still need a scapegoat and that might be him. He also just realized that he hadn’t deleted those tapes from last night. Damn, he’d let himself get complacent. Distracted. And now here he was. “I need to take care of this,” he announced.
“Goddamn,” Castiel mumbled when they finally broke apart. “Did I tell you how happy I am that they sent
Jimmy opened the door and ushered her in, only activating the master light switch after he’d closed the door behind her.
“But you didn’t.” Dean frowned. “My laptop was clean.”
“I would, if I thought I could get away with it,” Castiel replied with a grin and a twinkle in his eyes.
She glared at him and crossed her arms in front of her chest, blocking his exit. “Clarence. Care to tell me what the current plan is?”
Castiel replied with another kiss and then used the handle on his wall to pull himself up, now happy it had been there already when he’d moved in. Apparently he was getting old enough to need it. He held out a hand for Dean to join him and Dean followed him up.
All too soon they reached the destination. The car was parking in the handicapped spot of a motel and a quick interview with the bored clerk manning the check-in desk revealed the room they should be staying in. They didn’t even have to flash their badges.
“Call your Detective and jump out the window?” Balthazar suggested.
Dean grinned but pulled the shirt over his head obediently, folding it up and placing it on the nightstand reverently. Castiel snorted and took off his own shirt, throwing it on the ground carelessly. Next, both their boxers went flying and Dean opened his arms expectantly. But Castiel shook his head, twirling his index finger.
Dean frowned, looking at Castiel. He was probably going to run that name through the system. Castiel didn’t even blame him. He was prepared, in any case. It would come back just as squeaky clean as Castiel Novak did, neither of them being his given names.
into this. Performing for an audience definitely added to the thrill.
Jimmy had also just left the coffee shop and was probably on his way home. If at all, he’d listen to the tape tomorrow morning when it was too late. Castiel longingly glanced at his landline phone, wishing he could dial 9-1-1 without Odin noticing. But there was no way.
He clicked the button to charge the gun. Unfortunately, the distinct humming noise alerted the alien and it quickly dropped Dean’s leg, holding out both of its arms in the universal gesture for ‘I mean no harm’. Then again, was it universal? Or was the Tin Can summoning powers of its own? Dean had no idea if they even had powers. Not much was known about the species and certainly nothing special was shared with Dean. He was just a dime-a-dozen pilot, expendable in this war. He doubted anyone would tell him if the aliens had telepathy or… what was the other thing? Telekinesis?
“You can always leave,” Castiel offered. “The doors are open for you.” It would make his life a lot easier if he could implicate her without her being around to notice.
Castiel frowned. “I never asked. Would’ve felt wrong, too.” The tea was his only privilege and that had been out of necessity.
“Bail bond,” Dean replied. “They only require a deposit.”
Castiel hesitated. He came in here thinking the ‘real bad guy’ was in front of him, but instinct told him that Dean’s reaction to the images had been genuine. Winchester might be a criminal way overdue on jail time—and Castiel was pretty new to the FBI, so an easy conviction would be in his best interest—but he had integrity.
“Of course I do,” Jimmy quickly reassured him. “Oh, I forgot. I’ll also write you a letter explaining your situation, so you can show it to any future employer. Maybe get hired in IT?”
“Alright, fine,” Castiel ground out. He pulled back and without warning, thrust into Dean hard and fast, making him scream and scratch at his back, then he just as abruptly slowed down again.
“Listen Dean,“ Castiel started. “If it was just me, fuck it. But you already had restrictions for your article. I‘m… it‘s not just me. It‘s the band. All the people that are supported by my music and my tour. I don‘t see a problem, to be honest. For every listener I might lose, new ones will find me. But…“ He shrugged again. “So far there‘s never been anyone serious, so I just blissfully blocked this out. But I‘ll… I‘ll talk to Bobby.“
“Your dad in the military?” Castiel asked.
“Yes,” Dean replied, before he could think better of it. “I mean, uhm…” Shit. He bit his lip. “It was peacefu…” Dean squeaked out the last word when Castiel was suddenly right in front of him, placing his thumb on his lower lip.
“Now, we’re ready for today. Unless you still feel under the weather?” Castiel questioned.
“Didn’t say that,” Dean finally faced him again, getting back on the bed and sitting up cross-legged. “Please go ahead.” He gestured towards the window under which Castiel usually performed his ritual.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You know how I meant it.”
“Depends,” Dean started. “If I neither lost nor gained, it was just no TV for the week.”
“No, of course not,” Dean reassured him, blatantly staring at him. “I can go.” He didn’t actually move though, hoping Castiel wouldn’t take him up on it.
With a last kiss to Dean’s thigh, Castiel pulled out his fingers and Dean whined at the loss. He made sure Dean saw him hold up the oil and liberally coat his own cock before he became too distressed. “Yes, yes,” Dean chanted. “Yes, please, Cas.”
“Did your mom teach you?” Castiel asked.
When he had started to shiver the night before, Dean had been afraid it might be worse than a broken leg. Who knew about internal injuries? Sure, he still had his apparently magical armor, but if it glitched for his leg, couldn’t it have glitched in other places, as well?
“We gotta throw it at him. It should trap him, at least for a moment.” Sam looked out to the sea, behind them, his face suddenly lighting up. “Now.”
“No,” Castiel shrugs. “Maybe? Things work differently here. You‘ll get used to it.“
It ended up more crooked than he’d wanted, but it had been a while. And also, he was working with vine strips and thorns, here. The shirt Castiel made looked a lot better, he had to grudgingly admit, so he was confused when Castiel insisted on switching them.
“Uh, yes,” the man, Castiel, rasps in a deep voice and Dean’s head snaps back up. “I read that you should always buy more than one guinea pig but is two a good number? Or should they be in a larger group? And how will I know if they even like each other?”
“I know your brother hurt you a lot. And I would definitely not put you in a situation where you’re uncomfortable just to… fulfil one of my dirty fantasies,” Dean said before he rubbed his hands over his face. This conversation made him squirm. “And we’ve only just started… being us.” He gave Cas a meaningful look. “I don’t want you to think you’re not enough.”
For a being of his caste, it was highly unusual. He’d expected to have a mate chosen for him, one day. Well, not anymore—what with his recent, forced fall from grace—but when he had been younger. It probably wouldn’t have been him who conceived, though, because Ceruleans need a deep emotional bond to even be ready for conception and an arranged coupling rarely qualified, but it was easier for those who were female. So he’d always assumed he’d be the one to donate the DNA, not carry himself. Castiel was very grateful it all worked out the way it had.
Just then the mermaids swarmed in, attacking the Kraken with daggers. They kept away from the net as much as they could, and Castiel could see that those who came in contact with it flinched back. But it didn’t keep them from continuing. Those who had more access to tentacles not trapped in the net seemed to gnaw at them, ripping open the flesh before spitting it out.
Castiel again didn’t question it, just did as told. It created a shockwave that sent the shooter flying backwards, knocking the gun out of his hand. Castiel used the opportunity to run towards his bedroom, flip the lock, drop his towel and step into some sweatpants. Much as he wanted to just flee, naked would not be the way. And the guy trying to shoot him was blocking his only exit. He looked at Balthazar, who had followed. “Any hints on how to bolt my door?”
“Oh, uhm…” Castiel took another drink, mostly to buy time to come up with a story other than Naval academy. “My dad taught me. He was a priest.”
“So, what?” Dean joined in. “She’s been grooming you to be her ultimate fall guy, or what?”
“Jimmy and I…” Cas circled his own wrist nervously. “We grew up in a very religious, extremely strict household. We were not allowed to go out unless it was a church activity to keep us free from sin.”
They didn’t go very deep into the trees this time, staying at the jungle’s edge to collect their supplies. Castiel heard something rustling behind the bushes, and when he looked, he found a family of baby boars. That might explain why the boar had charged them earlier. He briefly felt bad, but an angry growl to his left revealed another adult boar eyeing him. He raised his hands and backed away slowly, thankful when he didn’t get pursued. He’d be loath to kill both parents.
So he drank the tea and ate the food he’d helped prepare, all the while stealing glances at Castiel. They didn’t talk during the meal. Somehow it was supposed to make you concentrate on the food more and really experience it. ‘Mindful eating’, he was told. For the first time since he’d joined two weeks ago, he actually tried to partake, closing his eyes and really feeling the taste and texture of the food.
When Dean got back, Castiel put him to bed and quickly went to perform his own bathroom rituals, albeit in a speed run. Once he returned to the bedroom, Dean was sitting up against the headboard, looking at him expectantly. He looked really cute wearing one of Castiel’s favorite tee shirts, much younger and vulnerable. Nothing like his stylish, primed boss.
As soon as he’d opened the remote classroom, he could hear his students join. There were still five minutes to go and he smiled at their eagerness. They were good kids. He waved, his microphone still off, and watched them wave back and otherwise interact with each other, probably through private chats going by some of their faces, until it was officially time for his lecture to start.
“Do you?” Jimmy questioned back, sincerely doubting the validity of that statement.
“We used to date.” Castiel clarified. “But maybe don’t print that. I dunno. I’d have to clear it with her first.”
Maybe his superiors hid this knowledge because nobody would want to kill beings as ethereal and beautiful as the alien on the ground in front of him.
“I called Rowena,” Sam informed him. “She’s on her way.”
“You know Dean.” Sam replied in explanation, trailing off and Dean flushed again. He’d definitely gone off on a few rants about why the fuck they wasted money on charlatans and if Castiel’s bullcrap was even admissible in court. And he definitely did not also describe how irritatingly hot he was and that it messed with his head and otherwise Dean would have definitely solved those cases where Cas consulted on all by himself.
Castiel frowned, trying to relax again, but it was no use. “Sorry, I’m…” Castiel used a little more force to get out from under Dean’s tight embrace and slipped out of bed. “I’m still responsible.” He shrugged and without waiting for Dean’s reply, he went to the door.
Dean rolled his eyes, but Castiel startled a laugh out of him, forcefully turning him around again and placing his hands back on his hips. He slid them slowly up his body until he had forced Dean to raise his arms above his head.
Castiel scratched his eyebrow, letting it sink in. “Wait. Were you mad that I used your name?”
Castiel finally had a little more control over his body, now that the singing had stopped, but it wasn’t enough to let him crouch back down and hide. Instead, a few other female bodies popped up out of the water, one of them winking and waving at him, beckoning him in. He frowned but found himself resisting, which in turn made her frown, as well.
But the Farm was established now. It was a smoothly running operation. He didn’t need a partner anymore. He needed a loyal companion. Someone who showed him the respect he deserved while also being worthy of Castiel’s attention. Someone like Dean. He looked to his right and smiled just as his tea was being served.
“Torture?” Dean suggested.
“Peppercorns?” Dean frowned.
Castiel nodded and finished his own coffee before sliding out of the booth to stand next to Dean. He fiddled with the hem of his shirt for a few seconds, before he nodded towards Jessica. “Stay safe, Jess. I hope we meet again soon.”
Dean’s mouth dropped open and he stared at Castiel. “
By the end of July Dean had finally accepted Cas’s words and with all hopes of a relationship dashed, he didn’t feel as weird about casually touching Cas anymore. So he didn’t have to awkwardly force it, and they were finally back to their casual intimacy from the beginning.
Having made up his mind, Dean went back to the kitchenette to tell Castiel he was leaving. However, once he finally found the strength to look him in the eyes, Castiel cocked his head and said, “Oh, Dean,” in that voice of his that made Dean melt and then he wrapped him up in a hug.
Castiel frowned at the screen, wondering how the fuck she always knew so much about what the FBI was up to, especially concerning him.
Jimmy raised his eyebrow. “She warned you?”
His fellow kitchen workers were finally willing to talk to him, too. Maybe it helped that they saw him enter with Castiel in the morning. Or maybe it was just because he was happy to start the conversation by gushing about Castiel himself this time, before they moved on to other topics. Dean just felt happier. Lighter.
Since he just got
Castiel nodded, even if it was a stupid question. Of course he’d felt it, too. How could he not? Maybe he hadn’t understood Dean’s words, after all?
“Mm, yes, “ Dean purred, opening his arms. “I like where this is going.”
“And we’re weirdos.” Dean nudged him playfully.
Dean froze, pen ready to write on the first cup. “Ok, are you shitting me? Is this a test? Did corporate send you?” Castiel’s face fell. Yeah. It’s why he usually said his name was Jimmy. Dean must have realized his mistake, because he quickly scribbled the name onto the cup and showed it to him. “Like this?”
“Because I’m the Captain of the Impala,” Dean replied, like that would be explanation enough.
Shit. He focused back on the screen. “Anyone want to add to that?” A few hands raised, thank fuck, and Castiel picked Kevin. As soon as the kid started, Dean’s shirt was flying past him, just off-screen, and he was forced to look up.
“Of course not,” Dean clarified.
“You’ll be better off without me. All I ever did was incriminate you.” Cas slowly pulled back. “I’m sorry, Dean.”
Castiel picked up his own bowl and finally looked at the TV, realizing it had been set on the nature documentary channel he’d been watching last night. “Is this ok? I can put on a movie.”
Dean rubbed his cheek against the bedsheet and bowed his back like a cat. Castiel had a feeling he’d be purring, too, if Castiel stroked him just right. “Yesss,” Dean moaned. “Just hurry. I still feel empty,” he sighed. “Don’t make me come empty again.”
“We have time for a quick blowjob?” Dean offered, placing his hand on the bulge in Castiel’s linen pants suggestively.
Castiel grinned, remembering. “A variation of that had been on my mind for tonight as well.”
Today, Dean could hear the sound of the rushing water, and when they made their way towards it, there were a few birds flying through the forest, as well. Some were fiery red, while others were darker with various specks of color. They were all quite pretty and none of them attacked, so Dean took it as a good sign.
When he woke, Dean actually felt rested. Stretching, he smiled at the alien, who was watching him from a few feet away. “Good morning, sunshine.”
“I should be asking you that,” Castiel replied, indicating the office.
“Could you please put my lunch into the refrigerator?” Dean handed him his bag and Cas narrowed his eyes.
Castiel chose the heaviest and took aim, about to smash it onto his leg, but Dean intercepted him, snatching the stone out of his hands.
Dean rolled over so they were back to back and he tried to fall asleep, but it became apparent that Castiel was now shivering and fidgety. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, then rolled over again, wordlessly gathering Castiel up in his arms and pulling him close. Cas burrowed into him and instantly relaxed. Dean rolled his eyes and smiled fondly, pressing a kiss to the top of Cas’s head before closing his arms more tightly around his charge and listening to Castiel’s breath slowly even out. The slow and steady sound was enough to lull him into his own sleep.
Castiel started rolling his hips into Dean’s and Dean spread his legs further, to make more room so Castiel could slide closer. Grinning against his lips, Castiel seemed to approve, because he lowered himself even further, putting more weight onto Dean and pressing him into the mattress with each slow, deliberate roll of his hips.
Dean reached for his hand and squeezed it again, before he sat back on his haunches, staying in close vicinity to the toilet. “Don’t think you pictured this though. Not glamorous.”
It was a tight fit and they laughed their way through bumping into each other in all the non-sexy ways. Not like they actually had time to fool around some more - yet another reason why Castiel couldn’t wait until they’d leave this place.
Castiel wrapped him up in a warm hug and Dean let him, clinging to him and soaking up his comfort until he had himself under control again. All the while Castiel was making soothing noises and told him he was worth so much, he was loved.
“Most of you are from Boston?” Dean asked carefully.
“Of course not,” Castiel bristled. “That would be immoral.” Jimmy could tell that he was itching to get out of the car now, but they hadn’t reached their destination just yet. “And I got everything I need.”
“Yes,” Castiel agreed, picking up his cup and taking a sip. “I’m allergic to peppermint and it’s in the community tea.”
Castiel groaned and closed his eyes. “Yes. Let’s not repeat it.” He tried to sit up but the movement caused sharp pain to spike down his right leg. Shit. He winced and tried to move it again, but it hurt so much, he was afraid it was broken.
He was right. They were waiting in the hallway.
Jimmy zipped his lips shut and handed over his credit card instead. Dean raised his eyebrow and rang him up and Jimmy grabbed his coffee and brownie to go. As soon as he’d turned around, he heard Dean mutter ‘cheapskate’, so he turned again with a smirk. “If you wanted a tip, you should’ve been nicer to me.”
Dean felt like shit. How could he lie to this man? “You’re too good to me,” Dean told him, brushing his own fingers through Castiel’s hair.
Dean sighed, opening his eyes. “Hey, Cas?”
In November Meg also brought along her girlfriend Ruby and Dean visibly sighed in relief when they were introduced. Meg had grinned and winked at him afterwards, but since she still never really talked to him alone, Dean never found out what that had been about.
Castiel sat down next to Dean. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to screw with your case.”
Castiel kissed his temple and rubbed his arm. “Do you want your shirt back?” He offered, realizing Dean probably felt naked and exposed, just wearing boxers for a conversation like this.
“Thanks, Cas.” Jimmy quickly scrambled off to get a cockring for himself.
Dean pulled away long enough to take off his shirt, throwing it behind him and freeing Castiel of his shirt as well. “You’re insanely beautiful,” Dean mused, trailing kisses down Castiel’s neck and over his chest, sucking a nipple between his lips and toying with the nub. Castiel moaned, pulling him closer, one hand in Dean’s hair and the other scratching down his back.
Ruby laughed. “Well, yeah. They thought you were vying for Castiel‘s attention and let‘s be reasonable, you stand a fair chance.“ She winked at him. “But now you‘re a ticket to get into just this very backstage area for the next concert and trust me, they‘d so much rather fuck you than some of the other crew on this tour.“
A good angel. The dicks shouldn’t count. But the
“Why did you contact me? It’s not safe.” Guy One was hissing. He was short with brown hair and no real identifiable features.
When he could shake himself out of his stupor, Castiel followed, surprised that the men currently on deck now seemed friendlier. Some even smiled and nodded, though nobody opened the door for him. He briefly considered going to Dean’s quarters, but what reason could there be, aside from just really wanting to be near Dean? And that definitely wasn’t a good reason. That was a very dangerous, slippery slope.
Castiel flushed and sputtered. “I wasn’t… What? No!” He didn’t need to be thrown out of the bar for his proclivities. And besides, Dean was a filthy pirate. Then again, it was better she thought him enamored than on a mission.
“Oh, thank fuck,” Castiel muttered. “Let’s just get out of here.” He wrapped his arm around Dean and slipped his thumb in the waistband of Dean’s jeans. Which earned Dean even more murderous glances than the night before.
Dean’s eyes met his, surprised. He held Castiel’s gaze until he answered in an equally soft voice, “My mom.”
“I know a great spell to replenish your energy in a jiffy. If you would finally let me help, maybe you wouldn’t be so grumpy anymore.” Balthazar remarked.
By the time they actually made it on deck, the ship’s crew was already ready to depart. It was a flurry of commotion, Castiel standing off to the side with Garth as they watched the crew work together without a hitch, Dean at the helm looking glorious and carefree, a natural aura of leadership about him.
“Dean,” Castiel stressed.
“Why, thank you, Dean,” Rowena sounded pleased. “You’re such a sweetheart.” And suddenly the fog in Castiel’s head cleared, and all he could hear were the waves crashing. No more singing. He looked out to sea again, catching the eye of the blonde trying to lure him. She pouted and blew him a kiss and a wink. Castiel shuddered and Ana loosened her grip on him.
Castiel bit his lip, squirming a bit. “I mean. I do. But they’re welcome to come back to the show. They’re just not welcome near me again.”
“Charlie, are you…” He couldn’t finish because Dean took that moment to wake up. Castiel had probably been too rigid and he’d stopped petting his hair too. Though in hindsight that was a lot better than to be caught with his hands in Dean’s hair.
Because he was. So special. Most of Castiel’s followers were depressed trust fund babies who just wanted some meaning to their lives. They were happy to be put to work here, feeling like they were finally good for something and reconnecting with nature. And more importantly, part of a family that cared for them.
Dean must have been really out of it, because he slept straight through it. Castiel should probably be proud of himself. His thighs were burning from his earlier exertions and he stretched them out, adding a few basic yoga poses while he was at it. When he looked at the bed again, Dean was awake and watching him.
Dean nodded. “I don’t know why that’s a bad thing. Like, my kitchen can’t ever be too clean.”
Castiel closed his eyes and bit his cheek hard, forcing himself to only clench his left fist, since he was still caressing Dean with his right hand. God help him if he ever met Dean’s father. “Well, now you can do all the sports you want.” Castiel tried to cheer him up a little.
Castiel smiled. “Thanks for helping me with them.”
Dean has to laugh and puts a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. How had he found a guy this hot yet this insecure? “It’s fine. I invited you, remember? You didn’t press.” He suddenly gets an idea. “But you have a point. Let me take a picture of you to text Charlie so if I don’t show up to work the next day, the police will know who to look for.”
Dean looked down at the floor, not sure what else to say. How did he go from this ecstatic to hopeless in such a short time? Deep down, he knew this was silly. He’d see Castiel for dinner. They had tonight. But that still didn’t help him right now.
Jessica beamed. “Call me Jess.”
“Yeah…” Dean drawled, looking at the plate of food. “If you don’t really like anyone, it doesn’t hurt when they leave you, right?”
blend, the one that kept them happy. Castiel noticed Meg refusing to drink hers and he frowned. Maybe she should start. She could use a little more calm.
“What?” Castiel asked. “Did I say something wrong?”
“I’ll try not to distract you from it,” Castiel winked. “I am sure you will do a wonderful job in taking care of our family here, feeding us and making sure we stay healthy.” And he could report back that nobody was spiking the food. Win/win.
Dean’s answering grin looked almost predatory. Fuck. Castiel fiddled with his tie. Things wouldn’t get easier, then. “No, I’m not, Special Agent Novak.” He lowered his eyes demurely. “How many do you think I deserve?”
Castiel interrupted him before he could finish. “Dean,” he said. “Why would I go for a run when I have you here waiting for me?”
“It’s too early. I should’ve done this already. Fuck.” Castiel was still fiddling with the pile until Dean knelt down and helped him. He had no idea what he was doing, but it seemed to calm Castiel down.
There were more ghost pirates now ganging up on him, and he flung his poker around wildly, wondering just how many of those damn ghosts there were. Going by the clothes they wore, they seemed to be from more than one era. Castiel wondered if this meant you joined them when they killed you. He didn’t want to find out.
Dean raised an eyebrow and followed. “Detox rooms?”
He maneuvered Castiel away from the plate and hoisted him up to sit on the table, deepening the kiss and burying his hands in Castiel’s hair, messing it up a little more. Castiel wrapped his legs around Dean’s waist and pulled him closer, hands sliding underneath Dean’s shirt and tugging it up.
Rowena sat down at the map table and Castiel joined her. Dean was too anxious to sit and Sam still seemed uncomfortable with the whole situation, so the both of them remained standing. During Rowena’s explanation, Sam started pacing and Dean kept inching closer and closer to Castiel’s chair.
to write that piece on me?”
Castiel smiled at him again and Dean didn’t even know why he was telling him the truth. Or why he honestly felt like he was failing Castiel, personally. Weren’t there other people more important to Dean? Something tried to come forward from the back of his mind, but when he tried to picture someone, anyone else more important than the smiling God currently taking care of him, all he could see was Castiel.
One he was back at his own place, he used every resource he had to try and arrange a fast bail hearing with a sympathetic judge. Sadly it was too late for today, but he could set it for the next afternoon and made sure he was on the witness list to speak on Castiel’s behalf. He should’ve informed his supervisors of this first and gotten it approved, but he really didn’t care. What could they do? Fire him?
“Dean?” Castiel frowned, regarding him warily.
And somehow, this was the first time he truly doubted the righteousness of his mission.
“Mildred crushed some sleeping pills into her food. Meg will get a good night’s rest and I can get those books for you.” Castiel explained.
“A cockring. Please?” Jimmy wrung his hands. “I want… to be… good for you, Cas,” he ground out, and oh, how much that must have cost him to say. Castiel gloated. This was almost worth the trouble they put him through. But not quite.
“Used to,” Dean shrugged.
Dean molded his body to Castiel’s, initiating a hug. It felt like his chest would burst open from all of his feelings if Castiel didn’t hold him together. He breathed him in, head buried against his neck and sighed. “I could’ve made it enjoyable for you though.”
It worked and the kid scrambled. “Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.” Within minutes, Castiel had a new uniform. He felt a little bad for abandoning his pirate gear because by now he’d grown fond of it, and it was certainly a lot less stiff than this uniform, but this would grant him entrance to the jail.
Mildred had already been taken away, having been one of the first to go up and get into the transporter van peacefully. Dean had to make sure to follow up on her. Though first he had to try and get Castiel out of prison.
He got up and stretched again, amused when the alien did the same. Then the alien started walking, but Dean held out a hand to hold him back. “Wait,” he said. It was starting to feel weird to keep calling him ‘the alien’. He placed a hand on his heart and said, “Dean.”
It wasn’t like Castiel wasn’t enjoying more of Dean’s pale skin, but he was confused. “What are you doing?”
“Just like that?” Jimmy questioned. She wasn’t going to grill or berate him for going to talk to his brother? For what exactly she had heard?
Castiel unloaded the last of the equipment he would need and said goodbye to Charlie, who seemed reluctant to leave. He’d only spoken to her in brief video chats before today, but she seemed like a good colleague to have. Maybe if he could come back and not be isolated, she’d be a good team member to have.
“I don’t need to know the notes to be able to play them. And when I have a melody in my mind, I can keep it.” Castiel shrugged. “And my band members are all pros. They can work with me just playing it. Still. The drugs haven’t fully fried our brains yet.” He laughed.
Maybe he’d focus more on that kind of work. Raise awareness and not just fix all of the problems himself. He was still pondering about it when he reached the outside of Charlie’s apartment complex where Dean was already waiting for him.
“No, Dean. Please stay,” he pleaded. “It’s my fault. I’ll explain later.”
Even if it smelled a lot better than what Castiel got stuck with. He sighed and wiped some juice off his chin. Dean‘s dull green eyes had softened a bit after he’d eaten a second fruit, so maybe he‘d just been hungry. Or maybe now he was convinced Castiel had not poisoned him.
“It’s only fair,” Dean mumbled, embarrassed.
“May I?” Dean asked instead, hands hovering, until Castiel nodded. Then he trailed his hands over the scars carefully before placing them on his shoulders in what was hopefully a comforting gesture. Dean leaned down to plant a kiss at the nape of Castiel’s neck. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
Dean’s lips curved in a small smile. “You too, Cas.” Dean mirrored him, also cupping Castiel’s cheeks. “I couldn’t bear to watch you walk away without me. So please, wherever you go, take me with you.”
“How many are there?” Dean asked.
“Ok, Ang… Mr. Novak. I’ll see you tomorrow?” Dean had phrased the last like an honest question and Castiel sighed.
“Yes, you will,” Dean shouted back.
Jimmy nodded, entering and trying very hard not to look around too much. Castiel knew it must be killing him, because he was curious by nature. “So, uhm,” Jimmy held up the computer he’d used two days before. “I brought you your laptop.”
“You gave me part of you while I was ready to…” He paused again. “Receive?”
She had hatched a lot further developed than a human baby and she’d been able to eat real food straight away, even if it was only mashed berries and cut fruit for the first three days. Then her teeth had fully come in and she was able to eat some meat, as well. Mary was having exponential growth spurts during the night while she slept, but Castiel had assured him that this would stop soon.
With a nod, Castiel went to his closet and got out a towel and a fresh set of clothes. And just when Dean had gotten his hopes up, Castiel added, “Let me watch you walk to the bathroom though, at least.”
Dean was about to start a conversation when his cell phone rang. He sighed and held up a finger, indicating to Cas that they weren’t done yet and then glanced at the display. It was his brother.
Dean woke up feeling warm, safe and happy. It immediately switched to disoriented and confused when his brain kicked in, because those were not feelings he usually felt. He was used to waking up alone and miserable but today felt different because he was… in bed with Castiel, his Angel. Because he’d had had some kind of pathetic panic attack the day before and Cas had felt the need to take care of him.
Castiel’s hastily assembled public defender made sure to mention that Castiel had no money in his bank account and all of his acquaintances had been on the Farm, so he had nowhere to go and no means to flee the country. But otherwise the guy seemed distracted. Dean had to get him a better lawyer. Sadly the only lawyers he knew hated him, since he was usually a witness for the prosecution.
There was a pause on the other end of the line. Sam hadn’t officially decided yet, but of course he’d join Dean here. It was what made Dean get his two bedroom apartment. Sam had been very encouraging about it. “Sam?” Dean prodded.
. He really should send the FBI that fruit basket one day. After he was safely hidden away with Dean in their new home in Costa Rica.
Dean ground his teeth. Hostile interview it was. He actually trained for this, back at college. He set up his recorder and fired off his first question. “So, you became popular because you ripped your jeans at a gig and video of that went viral.”
Castiel raised one eyebrow, then he morphed his face into the mask he wore around his followers, smiling at her wide and beatific. “Oh, child.” He placed his hands on her shoulders. “We’re all just living our best lives here at the Farm, striving to return to nature and achieve true happiness. Nobody will ever go down for becoming a better person. The only way is up.”
“Oh fuck.” Dean had to bite the pillow again.
Well. That explained why it didn’t fucking work. But since it had just saved his life, Castiel would save that conversation for another day. If he’d see another day. “Ok, what now?” He asked.
He would have to watch her more closely in the days to come.
“That’s impressive, Dean.” Castiel smiled.
“Not a cult,” Castiel protested on auto-pilot, but then he pulled back, met Dean’s gaze, and grinned. “Yeah, ok. I hear you.” Dean wasn’t that dumb. And by now he should know that Castiel wasn’t either. “So where do we go from here?”
“You’re doing great, Dean,” Castiel encouraged him when he’d eaten half of his sandwich.
“Michael was nice to me,” Dean protested. “Mostly.” He stopped himself and frowned again. “After I’d gained more muscles.” Dean started squirming and Castiel wasn’t sure quite how to comfort him. “But uhm… when I sorta surpassed him, he… still broke up with me.”
“Detective,” Dean clarified.
“Wait. What do you take me for? It’s three months not three years.” Dean frowned again. “Maybe I gave you the wrong impression yesterday, but I don’t actually just sleep with random people. I thought we had a connection. That we both felt it.”
Dean was now sure that he was definitely not dreaming, because no way could his mind come up with
Dean stopped rolling and looked up, pointing his thumb to where they came from. “Dude, I’m sure there are at least ten people in there volunteering as tribute.”
“I’m sorry, baby. I’m sure he will come around,” he whispered, happy when his stomach was glowing again. The connection was already strong. She would be healthy. And she would be loved, if only by him.
Dean gave him a horrified look. “Oh god. You’re gonna make me pull something, aren’t you?”
Anna smiled and the two of them shared a passionate kiss. Dean actually felt a little uncomfortable witnessing it because it felt really intimate. Anna placed her hand on the girl‘s cheek. “Wait for me. I‘ll be right back,“ she promised and slapped her on her ass before she went back on stage with the other two for their encore.
Or fight, in case Anna hadn’t received his message. Or she came, but  wasn’t the first one to arrive. Or—he didn’t even want to consider this possibility—she had received his message but had decided to stay neutral and ignored it. He told himself it wasn’t likely, because if she had betrayed him like that, they’d have already been apprehended.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, like for push-ups?”
“Maybe he did.” Castiel shrugged, playing it cool.
Castiel paused. What? “Did you not just announce it?” He frowned.
Dean had enough of that position for now though and turned, keeping his eyes closed to not get overwhelmed again and buried his face against Castiel’s neck. This way he could wrap his own arms around Castiel as well and cling on, which he did.
this morning.” He had lowered his voice at the endearment and Dean immediately flushed, almost spilling the tea.
“Nothing,” Castiel bit his lip. Damn. He should go find new clothes and a place to sleep. “I’ll leave you to it.” He nodded towards Dean, who probably wanted to talk with his brother, and made his way down below deck.
“Yes,” Castiel replied, looming over her bed menacingly. “Just go back to sleep, then you won’t even notice me murdering you.”
Just wanting Dean to feel good overrode all of the bad memories he’d thought buried deep in the back of his mind. Castiel was even able to relax enough to let Dean hit the back of his throat while he swallowed around it. He knew how good that felt, so he repeated it a few times until he pulled off and focused on the head of Dean’s cock again, licking and gently nibbling until Dean grew restless, his steady stream of words slipping into incoherent curses.
