‘How many times can we have the same fight, Sherlock?’
’ he spat, crossing one leg to sit more normally by John’s feet.
John would almost certainly be describing him as looking like an old turtle in a waistcoat. (He wouldn’t be wrong.)
‘What is the matter, Holmes?’ I asked, innocently as I could, hoping thereby to avoid further grumbling.
Head spinning –
‘ John urged, and Sherlock reached the top of the stairs, pain radiating through his abdomen, forcing his breathing to stabilise so he could move as silently as possible into the room, while everyone (the guests and the guards alike) had their attention focussed on the Nemesis now in their midst. ‘
Contrary to any reasonable man’s actions, John took a solid step towards him. (This proximity, to any hypothetical onlooker, would connote…. intimacy.) John’s chest was still labouring slightly, but his stance was firm, unhesitating — waiting.
’ John repeated, incredulous.
without hurling it at his sister, never mind the next fifty years. But things were just beginning to settle down. They hadn’t had a row (unless you counted the small ones in the hospital about deducing the medical staff, or complaining about the machine noise) in… well, since before the hospital. And as much as John’s gut twisted with the fear, mixed with a kind of grim familiarity, that this latest attempt was going to end very, very badly, some absurd part of him couldn’t stop replaying Sherlock blurting out, ‘
in my life determined to lie to me?’ He grimaced. ‘It wasn’t enough to face Moriarty, for you to throw yourself off a building? Had to go and fall for another trick?’
It was beginning to rain.
John did smile this time. (Primates and many mammals interpret the upturn of the mouth and particularly the baring of teeth as a sign of aggression, a warning signal, for precisely this sort of smile.)
‘But you’re clever,
’, when the temptation of wondering what the soft, firm insides of John’s thighs would feel like, warmed by their pre-ejaculate and saliva and friction; to stop when John made those noises and held Sherlock so tight it seemed again like it was worth whatever humility he would need to muster later (now) to have this, them, in the night… To believe, in short, that he was not addicted to John Watson beyond reason was to fail to observe himself.)
On his hands and knees, he grits his teeth and wrenches himself forward — the pain is a

John kissed him.
And what? Sherlock was abruptly aware that he was standing, in his room, in the dark, pulse racing, shirt unbuttoned, trousers and pants hastily wrenched up around his hips, hands and lower abdomen coated in his and another man’s semen.
Sherlock huffed impatiently and crowded further into the constable’s vision. ‘Water,’ he enunciated, ‘towel,
please Sherlock, so John either took his mobile and some earphones or, more and more often, just sat back and enjoyed the quiet of Baker Street. Added to which was the fact that Sherlock, with his consistently uncanny ability to know some things, often treated John to some of the most breath-taking music he’d ever witnessed in person, the sort of pieces that made a shiver run up your arms and prickle the back of your neck, made you
Could she do this, or couldn’t she? Would they have enough time — less than 24 hours — to prepare? Was she doing this just to please Sherlock? Most important of all, did she really understand what Sherlock — what they both — were asking of her?

‘None, I’m sure, and a little strain –’
‘Deeply though I respect your insistence on candour,’ Damery hedged, ‘surely you must also understand that my work depends on my ability to put myself forward in the place of others. I believe if you heard the whole story you would change your mind. Might I at least describe it to you in more detail?’
‘HA!’ he barked. Unbefuckinglievable. It was never-ending. ‘That’s not — absolutely

‘I want you to know,’ he vowed solemnly, hands steepled and resting on his knees. ‘That you will not be alone anymore. You don’t have to hide anything. I will not expect you to be anything other than John Hamish Watson. I won’t always understand how to give you what you want but I will always want to, just as I will always - ultimately - tell you the truth. Sometimes you will be impatient, or frustrated, or disappointed with me; you almost certainly have to be explicit, more explicit at times than you feel comfortable, to explain to me what you need. But there is nothing you could want or need or do or be that would make you anything less than the most important person in the world. More important than the cases, though I cannot say it will always seem that way to others. But the cases, the work, would be – would be utterly meaningless without you. As would everything else. I loved you before I knew what love was.’
So John hopped into the shower, trying as he scrubbed not to think of every inch of skin as a place Sherlock had or had not touched, marked by the invisible imprint of the previous night. Fifteen minutes later he reported downstairs for duty.
‘I’m not stupid,’ he pleas, feeling eleven again, because the pain in his chest is gaining momentum, shaking the fibres of him at the epicentre and radiating outwards, hot where the rest of him is growing chilled by the second, lonely, dim… reducing him from himself to someone else, someone whose body gets found in the morning and identified in the same morgue where he’s already seen it, laid out, death-white, still.
‘They are pretty juicy documents,’ John had allowed, mock-frowning, ‘though they leave a bad taste in my mouth. But’s that just me.’
He couldn’t stop himself staring, even as he argued. ‘We didn’t last time!’
Only once John was down to a shabby shirt (procured from the stack of clean laundry on the dresser) and pants did he resume his seat.
‘I’m not important,’ she shrugged. ‘But I’ll mind how I go.’
Eventually, for accuracy, Sherlock stated, ‘I didn’t sleep.’

Chapter 4
In spite of all subsequent efforts of Sherlock’s to undo this one shining act of generosity, John stood here, on two healthy feet, breathing like a bull facing off against a red flag (and the moron who was waving it), hating to the depths of his being the person who had relished, even for a moment, the opportunity to take the wind out of Sherlock’s insensitive, selfish ego.

The second floor, behind a scuffed, once-white door, was little more than an unlit defunct storage room. It was filled with a maze of open and sealed cardboard boxes, tangled webs of indistinguishable black cables, dented aerials, precariously piled DVDs and computer games, and wire crates of what seemed to be (from the multilingual labels) lightbulbs. John wondered if Sherlock could read any of the languages on the packaging or if he simply knew the wattages and sockets by their box-shape. As if hearing this thought, Sherlock threw his a small, private smirk over his shoulder. John assumed this meant yes. The insufferable git.

There it was — well, at least as much of it as he was willing to tell his blog-reading (and, maybe, soon-to-be wider) audience. He grinned.
‘Mind Palace converted to a call centre, was it?’ mused John.
In spite of himself, Sherlock repeated, blankly, ‘Ideas?’, because, while Sherlock had never really stopped thinking about what he wanted to do to/for/with John, it seemed almost incomprehensible, even with the preliminary evidence of John’s arousal caught between their bodies, that he – that he wanted – Sherlock’s mind was spinning.

Well if John was going to behave like a child then Sherlock was more than adept at such tactics. Mycroft was his brother after all.
I chuckled. ‘Not quite in the way you meant perhaps, but possibly in another.’

At just before the appointed time, Sherlock, stomach coiling in hot distracting undulations, put Ovid back in his cage. ‘We should at least teach him one of the original phrases.’
The lightness John felt at Lady Morcar’s shrug burst forth as he laughed himself into the corridor, made his way to the street, and – as the first few light drops of rain tapped the back of his neck – stepped into a cab. The feeling only intensified slightly when he opened a beautifully signed cheque for £15,000.

Five uninterrupted minutes in that study, he was sure, would do the trick — enough time to get a sense up-close of the locks, desk drawers, potential decoy Tang vases or Rembrandts that might be hiding a key or switch or encoded document of some kind — better still, a quick run through Gruener’s clothes to see if he had any false pockets or secret compartments in a humidor—
Sherlock heard his exit cue in this performance piece. He had solved his client’s case, at any rate, and wanted to wash his hands, in every possible sense, of it.
It was hardly steam-wallpaper-off-the-walls suggestive, but — well, if John didn’t pick up on it, no matter; it was a legible sentence without the (intended) innuendo.
He smirked. ‘I’ll refrain from pointing out that it was your genius idea to stop next to the sewer monster's own skip.’
Almost sobbing with relief – had this been
After a long (searingly long) pause, John finally pulled away — mere inches, but enough for Sherlock to blink and find his vision no longer
Even Before, Sherlock had been able to switch trains of thought at the speed of lightning. One minute discussing a poisoner’s MO, the next the idiotically high-res CCTV as shown on telly, then back to arsenic, before John had even spoken. Sherlock’s mercurial libido was not a surprise development of After — at least, John assumed so. The fact that Sherlock was more likely to moan when a slide culture failed to mature than when he was denied sex seemed all too believable.
‘Put your hand down

Crossing the road dredged up a stale, almost forgotten memory of the previous contender for the title of ‘best he’d ever had’. With it came the prickle of long-dulled shame, grief, and — because even amidst such an unfortunate cocktail of emotions, some part of him still relished it — a tiny swoop of pleasure in his gut.
Also as expected, Sherlock is nowhere to be seen in either the front room or kitchen or, as John walks by, bathroom.
The fact that John, who had always considered (misguidedly) his duty to ‘family’ to be among his most fundamental responsibilities, would accept, even with a jesting tone, the suggestion that he
‘Sorry!’ Challa cried, horrified at her carelessness.
‘I’ll call and cancel then, shall I?’ John quipped — from much closer than Sherlock had anticipated. (His stealth skills were frequently impressive.)
The bathroom door whisked open downstairs; he had approximately two minutes. What if John returned, cleansed of their encounter, and wanted to be alone? What if, after a lapse of time in which to think it over, he had changed his mind? (What if, demanded a pitiless interrogator in his mind, Sherlock broke him, like he broke everything else?) Sherlock found the potential consequences psychosomatically impaired his respiratory function.

I quickly realised, however, that there was very little reason – in fact a staggering amount to the oppose the idea – of sending you accompanied by only

In one gulp John necked the last of his pint, then stood to fish out his wallet, throwing it down with one hand as he nonchalantly used the cover of the crowd and the shield of his body to hide a hand that slid all the way up Christopher’s leg to where he was, the heel of John’s hand discovered, tented with interest.
Mind refreshed, body sated (chocolate, cherries; dumplings only twelve hours ago; John’s kisses last night, and one across his forehead this morning on the sofa as he dashed out this morning) but itching for proper exercise, he found his mobile.
‘I don’t think that’s possible,’ Sherlock croaked, voice thicker than he had expected.
How reassuring.

A minute later they were crossing the main hall of Bow Street, Sherlock yammering already to Inspector Bradstreet, who was – to his credit – nodding in apparent approval.

Sherlock was scowling, studying him, but John didn’t want to be read for clues. He couldn’t even begin to have this row that forced him to doubt himself, to doubt what he knew to be fact in Sherlock. This was a frightening emotional reality, probably, for the maestro of high, mighty, calculating reason. But John didn’t feel up to convincing Sherlock how much they… they cared about each other, wanted each other; how different this was to all the other times with every other person he’d ever been with — especially not when his insides were already churning at how fucking quickly things had gone from heated to — cool, in the worst possible way.

Sherlock had felt his nostrils flare. This was… inconvenient. In his peripheral thoughts, Sherlock had already been halfway to Kingston (by the time they reached Waterloo, the commuter traffic would have died down considerably, making it far easier to get a cab: it was — he thought briefly — Monday; good). But John uncharacteristically dragging his feet presented an unusual impediment to his careening thoughts.

suit. His grey eyes, as he struck and lit the cigarette, looked unblinkingly at Sherlock: no doubt it was more a function of smooth, skeletal cheekbones, hot-white shirt, and rich blue jacket that made those eyes seem so flat and… inhuman. As though he might even blink in slow motion, then strike.
John felt a swoop and soar of desire in his gut, mind rocketing through several satisfying ways he could shove the smug smirk on that gorgeous alien face into a gasp of pleasure.
Or… well, perhaps, if not ‘stupidity’, at least obstinacy and perversity!)
2. Also: I'm rather conscious of the orientalising move that happens in the middle of this chapter. My footnotes are: 1) this ties in to the previous two stories in this series; 2) it also ties in to the *Many Happy Returns* mini-ep from before S3; 3) I did substantial research to make sure I was fairly representing, to the best of my ability short of becoming a Tibetan Buddhist monk and devoting years to study, the way the Sera Mey Monastery (on which this one is based) and the Abbot depicted (based loosely on a previous abbot, not the current one) work, so that the squicks of cultural appropriation are, if not dissipated, at least somewhat mitigated by respectful treatment. I very much hope so.

‘My wallet, darling,’ he growled, drawing on no shortage of impatience and funneling it into his character. ‘I think it might have ended up in the bin!’ People never looked twice at others doing what they considered ‘mad things’; and in any event, this was a perfect cover story, sure to elicit either sympathy or smug disapproval from passers-by. And that was if anyone even bothered to notice him, in a place so clearly intended to be used only by residents rather than passers-by, with only the pavement (or the rear windows of the next street over’s residents) exposed to traffic that might spare him any glance at all. By the time he’d had a thorough survey, the fact that they had him on CCTV in their back garden would be too little, too late to prevent him gathering all the necessary pieces to close the noose around Gruener.

There was something unnameable, something more precious than John was prepared to handle just now, about a Sherlock, curls still wet and cashmere socks but no shoes on his feet, passed out from sheer, natural tiredness. He’d managed, consciously or unconsciously, to lie flat, avoiding the possibility of doing damage to his still-healing abdomen; at the moment, the taut, olive green shirt rising and falling minutely concealed everything but the crest of his collarbone and the hollows of his wrists.
— his abdomen felt hot, a spike of pain when he twisted to follow her; felt it pressed tight despite the lack of any apparent cause of pressure —
In the seconds between tapping his card and waiting for it to go through, as the pair of women behind him stepped up to the other register, John had time to for another realisation to percolate up to his consciousness: Sherlock
John’s attention was laser-like, palpable as much as the wind whipping the lobes of his ears until they felt in danger of frostbite. They need not stay a moment longer than it took to finish his (prepared, pared down) narrative.
‘Not necessarily, he wouldn’t – not if –’
‘Hey,’ he murmured, nosing his cheek, and Sherlock turned his head and just barely caught the very corner of his mouth, so sweet and soft John was sure he would deny it later.
Sherlock had made into the mattress, the feeling of that once-forbidden zone just below Sherlock’s navel, warm and sensitive beneath John’s fingertips, of his knees forcing Sherlock’s thick, fur-hair-smattered thighs wider apart, the press of Sherlock to his chest afterwards, so close, heart almost visibly heavy in his eyes, that John had felt — truly, though not for the first time since they’d first kissed and turned his world upside down (yet again) — that maybe they were more than fooling around, more than some romantic dream in his writerly imagination. Maybe they really were meant to be
As usual, all mistakes mine. (See one,
Every part of him was tensed, staggered, emanating from a soreness in his chest that ached like burn of a pneumonic cough. He turned his back to Sherlock for a moment in the hopes of mastering himself.
Sherlock happened to agree, though John was correct in considering the potential health hazards if she did not properly decontaminate her skin and nailbeds. (This did, however, confirm Sherlock’s near-certainty that Sgt. Challa lived alone.)
Not for the first time, his body felt over-large, disassociated, outside of time. He wasn’t entirely sure where his own fingers had got to. (He wondered, briefly, if John had drugged him. (Intriguing; understandable. Alas, not likely.))
The guard at the front door, it seemed, presented no problem (even with only audible data, Sherlock gleaned that the man was irritably hungry and distracted: at least one variable to their advantage), and soon Sherlock’s ears were filled with the grumbled sounds of John accepting a seat (‘
wouldn’t necessarily, but yeah, a normal bloke? He’d notice.’
He gasped, hotly, struggling to see through the stinging wetness on his face, where he found himself on the floor. His beige carpet stared callously back.
Sherlock affected nonchalance but John must have seen — his eyesight, minutely declining though it was, was still sharp at only a hearth’s-width distance (good: he needed to keep his sight for the subterfuge in Gruener’s house) — the tic of annoyance that quirked Sherlock’s face, and —

In the kitchen, their one good tea service — well, the pot and two matching cups (with the third, slightly heavier but nearly matched, though John would of course take the odd fourth mug for himself;
Creeping here, along the cliff’s edge, with the waterfall thundering around him, Mycroft’s taunts and the ghostly echo of Moriarty’s laughter rising up from the deep, it seems like there’s no point.
‘A Stanhope,’ Sherlock pronounced solemnly. Mycroft extended his palm and took the items, eyes swivelling now to his brother.
He tried to let the slights roll off his back, ignoring as best he could the discomfort of hearing someone outside himself judging the way his life with Sherlock worked. ‘Before, actually.’
‘You went out this morning for groceries,

Sherlock carried one, flipping it over to see the quoted ‘praise for this work’ by an assortment of people whose works on supposed ‘crime fiction’ Sherlock had one time or another berated privately to John, as well as the brief biography and headshot photograph ‘About the Author’ in the bottom-left.
‘I know, but…’ He swallowed. ‘I’m here now.’
. This boded well both for the night’s rest and tomorrow’s post-case 221b weather forecast. He rinsed the knife, flicked off the light, and mounted the stairs, resisting the urge to whistle.
‘He’s lovely, isn’t he?’ John had said, removing his sunglasses and sticking the other hand down into the canine’s long, soft coat and scratching him generously while Sherlock was still being alternately slobbered over and nudged with a wet nose. ‘Who’s a good boy? Yeah, good boy.’
‘No,’ Sherlock agreed.
5) The first part of John's dedication is lifted from
It would be difficult, he saw now as he considered the years ahead. The flat returned to its baseline of ticking clocks and silent skulls. The cases evacuated of the laughter, the mischief, the drive to care in the first place. Perhaps he wouldn’t stay in the flat at all. It might be easier, to avoid the same relapse as he’d undergone at the lowest points of his time on the run. Easier, too, on Mrs Hudson, not to have to bear the burden of caring for him without a buffer, without someone to tell him when he’d truly crossed the unforgivable line. It had been borrowed time (an expression he’d never particularly liked). No one had believed it when John had stayed; they’d been impressed and sceptical when John had returned. And, for once, they were right. But Sherlock wished he’d committed more of the previous night to memory, the soft heat of John’s body next to his, fingers scratching minute, beguiling aches of sensation across Sherlock’s skin, humming and smiling and behaving as though it wasn’t the last time.
As the three separate solutions cooled from their various boiling points back down to room temperature, Sherlock stared unseeingly at the slide of the control compound. No hints, nor mentions of dogs during the evening; nor any (at least easily legible) signs of malcontent or resentment at Sherlock having blundered as a romantic partner. Perhaps John simply didn’t consider the annual marker to come into effect at this time of year: it was just as valid to date their relationship to the end of March, when Sherlock had returned from being away, reuniting them in a way that had been, from the first moment, renascent. Or for that matter, from some winter date, long since — also involving Stamford, and beverages, and microscopes. The thought was, for the first time, comforting.

That was very much the problem: homeless witnesses were notoriously untrusted, unreliable, unprotected and therefore unobjective. Objectivity, Sherlock mused, was the privilege of those who didn’t have to worry about whether they would be knifed in their sleep on a bus bench for their honesty. And addictions only muddied the waters further.
HEYO, ratings-content ahoy!

After a moment in which he tried to gather his thoughts, feeling a slither of something in his gut, something ugly and corrosive, he shoved it away.
‘I am…’  His lungs felt swamped and his molars ached, but he gripped at the worn fabric of his chair between them, dragged the words out like thick-rooted weeds in a garden. ‘I am fucking
He felt hyper-aware of John’s presence, and tried to compensate for what was, to himself if to no one else, the magnetic pole of John’s completely normal and yet totally new body at his side. (He had spent nearly an hour while John was asleep mentally preparing himself for a number of scenarios for any future sexual encounter, varying based on John’s adventurousness and their access to a more palatable brand of lubricant.)
Sherlock’s eyes were attempting to deduce the package now taunting him from the kitchen table, but he answered, ‘Yes.’
Sherlock looked surprised. ‘A hat contains a surfeit of deductive evidence. So few people wear hats these days, which narrows the pool considerably to begin with to those with punk or goth tendencies, ceremonial positions, or no sense of style whatsoever.’
‘Scintillating, John, that time-telling is really coming along.’ And, prodding John in the armpits until he lumbered stiffly to his feet, Sherlock shepherded him towards the bedroom.
, he meditated inwardly,
Sherlock pocketed the note. ‘And, out of curiosity, might I ask…’ (John recognised Sherlock’s Columbo voice and knew he had arrived at the last burning question which could connect Ryder to the carbuncle’s reappearance.) ‘Do you have any idea where the birds came from, before Mr. Windigate’s shop sold them on to you?’

At that moment, the doorbell rang.
Sherlock sat (a clean — well… — distance away from them), leaving enough room for John just where the bench extended beyond the length of the table: easy to go on conversing with those standing by the table’s edge, as well as to run unimpeded from the scene, should the need arise. (The need was certainly arising for Sherlock with each passing minute.)
‘Did they fail to finish it on time?’ Sherlock wondered. Perhaps the power of the symbols expired if un…blessed within a particular (stellar? solar/lunar?) time frame?
to keep feeling that — to believe that such a feeling would safely shield them against every, entirely likely, change to their relationship (against a future version of himself he could not even begin to predict) — was impossible.
‘Suze Winter,’ John told him, in a clipped, directive tone he’d learned from being pointman on more than one op in his life. ‘You said last night on the phone that she —’
John, in a rush he didn’t quite know how he accomplished, brought the bottle back to bed.
He gaped. ‘It’s not even half-one.’
‘I already got another of these,’ he noted with deliberate bravado, waggling the bottle in the air despite the fact that Sherlock obviously
‘Ahem.’

had, in falling down on a knife, also fallen in his primary post. His legs felt like there were insects crawling just under the surface; his chest set aflame every time he took too deep a breath.
. Except, naturally, John knew Sherlock would never really have said ‘please’.
‘John, where are you? You need to get to Guy’s. They’re taking him —’
Sherlock considered kicking him down the stairs, but didn’t fancy having to clamber over the mess on his way out.
Sherlock rolled his eyes.
‘I was just making dinner and Flint made this horrible racket, and then I heard this loud
Ah: that explained the books. (He had only, so finely, by the magnitude of a fruit fly’s hair, managed to avoid the temptation of sneaking a look at the parcel.) Evidently this was not a movie of sacred significance to John, so Sherlock also spoke over it: ‘How many typos have you found so far?’
However many times Sherlock had contemplated how the unearthing of these chief facts of John Watson’s self would go, he found now that he was struggling to anticipate where the conversation was headed.
A dab of gauze that brought away only two pinpricks of blood – only pulled, then, with surrounding skin very red and angry (he’d have to be extra watchful for infection and temperature), but nothing fully ripped. Not for lack of trying.
A minute of fiddling with the television landed on — oh, lord. The corner of the screen (the strain on his eyes, another unwelcome consequence of the drugs and this absurd fiasco generally) proclaimed another terrible James Bond film was playing — good grief, were the masses so anxious about imperilled masculinity that they sought, in every way, to idolise a constantly-renewingly virile monolith of heterosexual promiscuity and poor gun handling? The damned films didn’t even have the decency to make logical sense! And they seemed to be broadcast on some channel or other
‘Whoa,’ whispered the sergeant. The shouts from a moment before were still ringing in John’s ears.
Molly was silently rehearsing the information she needed, staring unseeingly out the window. (Perhaps after this, he would remind her more sincerely of the functionality of a working Mind… well, Coach House, at least.)
John’s thighs were tacky and burning victorious as he walked out into the last dregs of night, across the three or so miles back through the town centre, by which time it was nearly sunrise. He might, he thought, manage to avoid the brunt of the hangover if he skipped to coffee and pastry now. When the bakery opened at half-five, he was the first and only customer, snagging three kinds of croissant for himself; he only just remembered to grab a large pecan danish for Anne. The first of his was gone before he was over the road.
‘I am renowned around the world for my collections.’
Echoing down the corridor as he walked away, John heard, ‘If we’re going to steal Gruener’s scrapbook or files or whatever they are, we ought to do so as soon as possible. And we need a way to be assured that we truly have enough irrefutable evidence for Mycroft to counterbalance the repercussions for all those involved.’

tales.’
Still, it was only early. Sherlock had looked set to get stuck in to reading up on Gruener’s background, hacking his finances or scouring the message boards or hosting a scouts’ meeting of the Irregulars, or something, John hadn’t caught the exact plan, distracted by the peculiar email from Mary.
‘Is it entirely necessary at the moment?’ Sherlock stressed primly, getting to his feet. By the sound of it, their hired car had just pulled up downstairs.
, was feigning a royal silence which John was going to well and truly end once Baker saw himself out.) ‘I have been unemployed for over a year, apart from my frequent gratis lectures at the Ashmoleon. But… now, I must thank you for the bird, and –’
‘And you aren’t troubled by Horner’s denial? Or the blatant inconsistencies of the story? Or the expensive elephant so lamentably
‘Mrs Hudson said you were upset,’ John persisted,
Sherlock’s stupid smirk was contagious, and very quickly they were both giggling and grinning like idiots. His stomach unclenched a bit.

‘Right, yeah,’ John echoed, trying not to give away that this was as startling news as it was. ‘Been a while.’
‘So, you think this is it?’ John asked bluntly, pointing between them.

*deep breath*
Rolling his eyes dramatically, Sherlock returned (alas) to the case. ‘Gruener clearly fancies himself more than a distant operator, as seen by the complaints (or rather, lack of same) from the high turn-over of jockeys and trainers: no explanations. Same about the sudden “retirements” of three promising young horses. Virtual silence.’
John exhaled a laugh, one that ruffled (Sherlock was glad to note, realistically) his newly-acquired facial hair.
Baker Street saw, not for anything like the first time, the bullish pacing of one of its two inhabitants, treading out his anger through his socks into the carpet.
He turned around, to find Gruener now sitting at his desk, entirely at his leisure, though still coiled like a cobra, chuckling.
‘Except, in order to do any activity at all, like, oh I dunno, chase suspects or spy on murderers through opera binoculars, you actually have to have some energy to start off with.’ His mouth creased into a line of unsympathetic annoyance, difficult to see at this angle. He chewed on the perfectly boiled-and-then-baked vegetables, mulishly ignoring the weight of Sherlock’s gaze falling down upon him.
‘None, happily. We are incredibly fortunate.’

‘You’ve found Henry Baker?’ he confirmed, a little triumphant himself.
Instead he ordered a third.
1. FWIW: this chapter is the most substantially different from my pre-S4 draft to this revised published version. But that said, a *shocking* number of things here were remarkably close to what's been going on in 4x01 and 4x02, so the changes were made less to shoe-horn in brand new elements and much more to connect the bits I'd already written to their counterparts in the aired eps.)
Sherlock would probably wake if he tried to throw a blanket over him and, since tonight’s portion of the little pill sorter on the dresser was empty beside a 2/3 full cup of water (the glass they usually kept by the loo sink), there was no reason to wake him.
‘It was – surely you heard that I – that is, that
John leaned forward enough to plant a steadying, heavy kiss on Sherlock’s shoulderblade, a hair’s breadth away from his birthmark at the base of his neck, ignoring the scars, then — as he knelt and pushed wider Sherlock’s splayed legs and petted the silk-prickly hairs on the back of thigh with his dry hand — reminded himself that it was his job to take the lead here, including in all matters of tone.
Sherlock glared at him, assessing, and John's nails bit into his palms and he refused to speak first for fear he’d just shout some more.
Swamp-voiced, Sherlock muttered, ‘There is no — logical reason why a royal “arse” should be — any more attractive than any other.’
‘There is,’ Sherlock grimaced, ‘an experiment at home that I was hoping to complete.’

(They would, at least, being getting paid — probably well — for this case.)
‘Morning.’
They’d stayed folded on the dresser, sandwiched between another of John’s shirts and a grey pair of Sherlock’s pants.
, Sherlock wanted to say, but John was already unconscious atop the covers, guardless and guileless in a way Sherlock found terrifying.
,’ Sherlock had said, and John didn’t want to be that man, wanted to be good and strong and honest and faithful and… well, yes, brave. But he hadn’t told Sherlock about the woman at lunch, despite being furious with Sherlock for lying to him. Was that all he was, then — doomed by his genetics to be an addict, doomed by his rebellion from his family to fail forever at anything like a stable relationship?
‘He didn’t see me at the opera,’ Sherlock pointed out. ‘And you know I can’t get the same amount of data sending you or, heaven forbid,
Stubbornly, Sherlock marched directly to the side of the messy bed he knew was not John’s and planted himself on it. Even if John returned, or woke in the morning, regretting what had happened, Sherlock could not prevent himself seeking more. John would either have to give in to him, or push him explicitly away. The thugs and criminals would wait until tomorrow.
He needed to think.
‘Well,’ John finally said, voice unreadable and closed off. ‘I’m… a little surprised.’
She sounds serious. He tries to listen.
‘Have fun!’ Flint cheeped sleepily, and John marvelled again at how clearly she understood their movements. She recited for about the millionth time the riff from Sherlock’s violin, the one that reminded him faintly of Harry’s favourite musical from their childhoods, Oliver!, but he didn’t know exactly why. ‘Pax vobiscum!’
‘Gruener will be hosting a pre-wedding tea tomorrow.’
‘Yeah, I would,’ John admitted, chest tight, ‘but I’m not going to, because, whatever you’ve convinced yourself, it’s not actually always the best plan, breaking in to the offices of infamous criminals on the chance you’re
He blinked some more. A million thoughts were clamouring in his head. It seemed utterly impossible; yet, here was the proof. And whatever remained, however improbable...
Refusing to release his mouth, Sherlock slid his hands with singeing slowness up to John’s neck and then down, fingers slipping beneath his dressing gown to peel it deliberately down his arms. John shivered and leaned further into Sherlock’s body heat, shuffling out of the gown so that it pooled at his waist while his hands dragged up along Sherlock’s shirt to press, forearms to fingertips, along Sherlock’s neck and shoulders. The resulting impatient huff from Sherlock’s nose spiked desire fresh in his stomach.
(Who had guarded him, when he was away? And before that? Who protected him while he slept, defenceless and angular and snoring?)
Eventually, when he trusted his voice, he cleared his throat to get Sherlock’s attention. ‘Alright?’
, I’m,’ but he didn’t want it to end this way, not tonight, not before he was prepared to return the gesture. He pushed at the top of Sherlock’s shoulder until he drew unbelievably perfectly off with a surreal, obscene
John smirked gleefully.
‘No, but Molly might want to, and if you want to get the smell of hospital off you before you eat, now seems like the moment.’
‘Not tonight,’ he said, regretting having to refuse. (The aroma of carrots, tomato-based gravy, potatoes, beef, saffron, and… oranges? Well: Florida. Too bad the congealed sauce would be merely half as appetising after being reheated tomorrow.) ‘Digestion diverts energy away from brain work.’
‘It’s fine, John,’ Sherlock had said in a reassuring undertone. ‘You were dreaming. It is still the middle of the night, and you are in your room in Baker Street, and everything is fine.’
John huffed, sighing more than laughing, and Sherlock wished he could touch him — wished this were the universe where John stroked Sherlock’s palm with his thumb not only as a prelude to sexual activity but simply as a means of… well, non-verbal communication, of whatever sort.

His phone buzzed, and, shirt unbuttoned down the front, he paused to read it.
He got to the fold and risked a glance at Sherlock. His grey-blue-green eyes were scanning the city slide by with an expression of faint distaste, and his fingers were thumping a vigorous beat onto the leather cushion between them. Was he allowed to rest his hand there too? Sentimental, definitely, but he
Lady Morcar (once the elitist front desk manager finally believed him and rang, in her most brownnosing tone, up to the Countess’s suite) was slightly, gracefully surprised to see him.
It had only been three days since Sherlock had woken up to full consciousness and John was completely unsure whether he was overjoyed or heartsick at the fact that Sherlock had restarted reality with such ruthless efficiency; that he was so determined to continue with the case, as soon as possible, even from his hospital bed. (In the spirit of giving Sherlock the necessary time to rest and heal, John had temporarily put to one side the million-and-one thoughts that had crept in between getting Lestrade’s call and meeting Sherlock’s eyes again for the first time this side of surgery. As such, he’d insisted that Sherlock take it easy — they were only just out of the window for round-the-clock observation for a pneumothorax or worse. So far, Sherlock was keeping to the letter of the law, but not the spirit.)

in the next room when in his heart he knew it was impossible… Lying in Sherlock’s empty bed instead felt like a perverse intrusion.
‘I want you to be happy,’ Sherlock said with a sigh, a small breath a thing, like the rustle of a spring breeze through the tulips in St. James’.
John is, perhaps obviously, slightly misremembering the breathtaking 1917 Wallace Stevens poem, 'Gray Room' (
‘How I knew that one of Gruener’s lackeys by her smile.’ Then he added, eye still boring into the side of John’s skull, ‘Even had I not recognised her face, however, she went to the very useful smokescreen of wearing women’s perfume to catch me off-guard when she stabbed me.’
He rolled 180*. John was sitting — leaning really —, spine twisted, (beautiful) collar exposed, on

one (which of course made John curious as to just how much chatty birds were going for these days – what happened to good, old-fashioned budgies?). Sherlock had then enlisted John’s help in the frankly transparent task of ‘teaching the parrot Greek’ and a smattering of other languages to help Baker get back in his wife’s good books; this was, of course, entirely a ploy to see how much he could make John say. (John was about 80% that this had been the actual goal – but Sherlock was both juvenile and naïve enough to do something so sentimental unconsciously.)
‘The binder at Ramani’s,’ Sherlock replied tersely. ‘He was not happy with you.’ St Clair nodded. ‘Though, in this matter at least, he was perfectly innocent.’
He hadn’t been with a man since uni (and even that hadn’t been more than a drunken party fumble) — honestly hadn’t thought about it once since then —, but with the fiery sensation beneath his skin that made him want to break things and scream at the unfairness of the world and be a selfish, carefree, pleasure-seeking version of himself who could get away with murder, he bought Christopher a drink. And then another.
His throat caught but he didn’t want,
‘Any…’ He hadn’t really thought of how that sentence was going to finish, only that he felt guilty that she was their friend — his friend — and he seldom treated her like one. ‘Anything interesting in the morgue lately?’
‘You have to encourage him.’
For all that he seemed like the fantasy-come-true of some middle-aged, sleepy woman from the Cotswolds, Captain John Watson, MD, was a protector, a rage-prone guard with little stomach for liars, cheaters, traitors, or fools. If ever Sherlock had doubted this, John had reminded him today.
Curtly, John nodded.
they never had to do again. John kissed the bottom lip fervently, then the top, long and wet and deep enough to drown. For a brief second he felt Sherlock’s quiet sigh, but as Sherlock continued to meet his kisses ardently, John decided to interpret the sigh as contentment rather than irritation.
‘Scents take on different aspects when in contact with natural human odours, chemical signatures with different notes as they combine and decay. In this case, your skin plus this cologne gives off —’ he grazed his index finger along John’s stomach — John shivered radiating out across his bare skin ‘— oranges.’
Often times Sherlock knew that he was terrible at reading signals, at noticing what others needed, particularly when they felt they could express it indirectly with their (entirely mixed and unhelpful) body language. But John was direct, even in the midst of emotional turmoil in the dead of night. So Sherlock had stayed.
As the door to the street opened and shut downstairs, John breathed, ‘Seven

, or maybe kicked or stomped or all three,
As he was hoping, Sherlock exhales what seems like a long-withheld breath.
As he rifled through his closet for an appropriately John-esque outfit, he lamented, not for the first time, the height disparity between them, otherwise he would simply have stolen one of John’s jumpers and revelled in the smell of him as he and Suze paraded around Lambeth and its environs posing as a couple.
This was — there was something awful, enormous and terrifying, in this statement — it echoed in his ears like thunder shaking a small aircraft as it flew through a storm. Every terrible thing he’d ever seen reflected on the faces of Victor and Alec and Sally Donovan and his parents and his teachers and the shrieking little girl whom Moriarty had nearly poisoned with sweets, all of that irreconcilable, inconsolable darkness they feared in Sherlock was at the heart of John’s words: and yet, somehow, John was throwing himself into the darkness willingly.
John snorted. ‘But then Ryder leaves the room at around quarter-past-five, after Huggins has already head off home, accidentally leaving Horner unattended until he goes for his dinner...’
‘Nonsense. And it’s ideal for daily use.’
‘I’ll go and get him,’ John explained. ‘Help yourself to whatever you like, don’t wait,’ distractedly handing Molly the plates and making for the bedroom, because he hadn’t heard the water against tile, nor even the muted thuds of footfalls on Sherlock’s rug over the slightly creaky floor.
Late that night, after the family and a selection of John’s army self-styled ‘mates’ sang and toasted and made consummate fools of themselves with no sign of regret or remorse (though, blessedly, they let him alone after a few ribald comments: no doubt on Bill Murray’s orders to behave), John giggled and, in the guest room (the attic of the renovated barn on Bill Murray’s property), pressed and pulled and dragged and exalted Sherlock with a slow ardour that made him feel like he was losing his mind, obliterating the entire world because the entire warmth and weight of it was surely here, beneath John’s skin.
Emphatically in spite of the inanity, Sherlock repressed a shiver.

Despite the substance of their quarrel so far, Sherlock’s tongue caught on the image he wasn’t supposed to have: Mary Morstan, a woman he wasn’t supposed to know existed — an assassin (a fact not even John knew (Sherlock himself was only 95% certain)).

about them could be normal. But that evening after dinner and two large glasses of wine, they’d kissed quietly on the bench in the kitchen, John murmuring apologies while creeping his fingers beneath Sherlock’s clothes and suggesting ways he could make it up to him. And when the next morning he’d found breathing strips stuck all over his body, he’d laughed and invited Sherlock to help him get them off under the warm spray of the shower.
Shaking her head, Molly frowned. ’That’s not what I mean. I’ve just got… well, a date.’

They went on criticising the film until, unfortunately, he couldn’t hold back from sleep any longer.
On the bed, in a fresh dress shirt and clean, straight-off-the-dry-cleaner’s hanger trousers, Sherlock was lying, asleep.
he locked his ankles, and Sherlock hissed and slid down on his side, and the angle was rougher and suddenly Sherlock’s slick fist was in front of him, dragging downwards. John’s hand flew up to grab, white-knuckled, at the strained cords of Sherlock’s neck; his body couldn’t decide to rock back or forwards, and for a single electric instant he felt like he and Sherlock both were

Several minutes later, grips no longer quite so vice-like on each other, John felt Sherlock release a shuddering breath. ‘You have no idea,’ Sherlock gulped, in a voice wet and trembling, ‘how deeply I love you.’
(Visions of Dewer’s Hollow and John’s jacket with leather elbowpatches; of him ordering corporals around Baskerville completely on a bluff and smirking as he saluted; of him pulling rank during that Bloody Guardsman case… John’s charms were often best displayed when taking charge.) ‘Tempting though that might be, I’d err towards no.’

Lastly, I reiterate for the 9000th time that there are some absolutely gorgeous fics going on on this site. Sometimes I read a chapter and someone's got an idea for a character's backstory or thoughts or mannerisms that I've also written; other times, they cotton on to something brilliant, something that seems canon-friendly to me, and so I weave it into my headcanon without precisely writing it into my fics. If/when I ever fully refer to something found in one source that changes my work, I'll try to cite it. So far, it's the diffusive culture of fandom works its diffusive influence...

‘Since approximately six o’clock last evening when he stole it.’
‘Cheers, think I will,’ said Sherlock, with genuine appreciation of the man’s utter stupidity in letting a potential adversary – hell, assassin – roam the grounds unattended. (Then again, he should keep an eye out for cameras and other surveillance equipment: Gruener was an idiot, but he had managed to elude at least the most rudimentary searches.)
Sherlock’s laugh.
With a begrudging sigh, John levelled his direct gaze at him. ‘What happened last night: more than a bit not good.’
‘Yes, I’ve been hearing a great deal about your friends, not to mention your relations.’ (‘Relations’, honestly; if he’d wanted to spend his life speaking this way he would have gone to work for Mycroft.)
Despite not being overly-prone to sentiment, they had — by mutual, unspoken agreement — brought home the stone that had made its way into Sherlock’s supposedly impenetrable boot, marketed (for — again — more than John would be comfortable spending) as ‘EVERYTHING-PROOF!’ (Naturally he’d brought them home and subjected them to relentless testing of every possible substance and eventuality. The results were enlightening, and would absolutely be relevant should anyone ever commit a murder in the peat districts of Great Britain.) But the stone was not for experimenting — he was a chemist, not a

a highly intelligent parrot to distract Sherlock from taking John to bed. Unfortunately for Sherlock’s primary plan, that was exactly what the day had in store for them.
‘We can be adults,’ John called, excavating each hot plastic container from deeper and deeper in the paper bags. ‘Kitchen table’s safe, I think.’ (Mostly because they hadn’t been home in ten days, so any germinating experiments had gone into the bin days ago.) ‘Red curry, sweet-and-sour chicken, pad thai, and rolls. Oh, and soup. S’all good, so help yourself.’
‘And…,’ he sighed, ‘thanks for the tea.’
‘Will everyone stop fixating on the petty reward!’ he snapped. There was enough confusion about ownership and exchange in this mess without adding more interests from the people professing to be disinterested! ‘I do not intend, nor do I believe you wish, Sergeant, to plunder from the aristocracy in order to keep prizes for ourselves. Our part in this business is to determine

emails specifically? He wasn’t a complete fossil, but the auto-reply function of a bounced email seemed to leave a great deal of ambiguity (apart from an error code, like that meant anything to him) for him to muddle over.
and he struggled to locate any frame of reference for how bereft it had felt, even with John so close by, to be forcibly thrown back into the untouchable unspeakable vacant uncertain realm of the 800 days when he’d had nothing but a ghost of John conjured in his imagination, so much less perfect than reality. But he reached now and John, rather than sitting on the edge of the bed, used his stance to his advantage and hovered close to Sherlock with restless, bright eyes. Their fingers intertwined, in spite of the hideousness of tubes and monitors and cables.
The next few patients went by even more quickly than the first.
Adding more lube, he gradually become more forceful, more direct, allowing Sherlock’s body to accommodate him, stretching just barely around him, deliberately finding — that helpful stereotype about doctors (well, it wasn’t wrong) — Sherlock’s prostate and provoking a positive shout. John added a third.
‘Your brother had no idea.’ He was smiling, a cruel, pained twist of his mouth that made Sherlock want to recoil in spite of his anger; his voice (thick: altered) carried no amusement, only fierce, dangerous restraint. ‘I was not fine. Bad. I was… bad. All right? Now,
‘Mmm,’ Sherlock agreed, since he suspected it was ‘not good’ (to say nothing of illogical) to unleash his fury that Mycroft had taken even fifteen seconds to gather numerical information about any aspect of John’s body.
’S’me, Anne,’ he called, putting his mostly finished croissant and the rest of it on the recently-cleared worktop. Then he took himself for a proper scalding shower.
John stiffened, holding a hard breath in his nose — so close Sherlock felt the pause skitter across his skin.
’ Sherlock demanded, flummoxed, breathing heavily and looking at John like he’d asked him if he’d like to have Mycroft round for an extended nudist Sunday roast. John could only blink at Sherlock: his mouth was entirely wet and red, including above his lip where his familiar patch of dark faint stubble had begun to appear.

Her already dehydrated, bloodshot eyes blinked darkly, pupils dilating in (he surmised quickly based on available evidence) genuine fear.

In the cab, John dutifully skimmed the headlines: famous gentleman politician’s glamorous wife robbed of her almost-equally famous, insanely valuable jewel. Safe apparently unbroken, and yet apparently not so safe.
In the longstanding game to outpace Sherlock’s imagination, John had surpassed himself.
It was not to be. ‘If you insist upon perusing those

More erratic, more brutal, instinctual, every time he rocked into Sherlock again he grunted louder, losing and finding a good angle with each crash of the tide, never releasing their right hands though definitely approaching his climax.
Sherlock looked at him flatly. ‘Hardly black-out blinds, John.’
This much Sherlock already knew; and, in any event, if he was unfamiliar with his popular culture references, he was absolutely uninterested in the stultifying matter of St Clair’s
John blinked at him, which seemed eminently reasonable, since somehow Sherlock’s mouth and lungs and voice had just articulated, albeit somewhat circuitously and with no hint of ‘romance’, the question of how John wanted to spend the rest of his life — asked him this

The whisky was the first real thing he’d felt in a fortnight.
Challa did blush, her cheeks burning with sudden shame. ‘Well… Flint isn’t exactly part of my official work at the moment, and I didn’t report her as “found property” this morning before I brought her here. I can’t keep her, I know, once we – well you – find Mr. Baker – and so I just… I thought it would raise too many questions. And it’s not as though I intend to keep the carbuncle either,’ she added, her eyes falling a little dazedly on the stone again. ‘And, really, as you’re the ones who’re tracking Baker, I imagine –’

The man turned slowly like a serpent, glaring with icy fervour. ‘Did you know the agent Le Brun, of Paris?’
Downstairs, Mrs Hudson was doing her washing up, with her radio for company.
Christopher was drunk and gone a bit soppy, John well into his cups as well and more importantly not giving a damn — not about whether the cabbie or the people on the pavement or the angels overhead disapproved — as Christopher and he hopped happily into the back seat, partners in crime, then played up their drunkenness, giggling and finding ways to get their hands on each other not-so-surreptitiously the entire way. Pulling up only a few minutes later, the house appeared slightly less romantic or clandestine than John might have imagined: a surprisingly average and decent looking attached house (nicer than his parents’), on a street with lamps far enough apart to splash tangerine-coloured light and imperfect shadows. Even the front garden was ordinary, decked with an overgrown attempt at a garden and the one (or was it two?) blurry Council-provided bin(s). All this John had time to glance at hazily as he threw himself first from the taxi, hoping Christopher would pay (since John, even in his cups, tallied the remaining cash in his pockets as ‘insufficient funds’).

‘I agree, that there were several other items of great value on that table which would certainly have been all too easy to take, for a desperate man. But surely the Carbuncle is enough!’
‘It was in, I swear on my life, the perfect shape of a cock and balls.’
Eventually, Sherlock spoke again. ‘Loathe though you think I am to admit it, John, I cannot control my own realisations. I cannot apologise for that. I cannot promise to know when pressing data will crystallise, nor can I promise to wait at home, twiddling my fingers, waiting for your permission to act on it. No more than I could ask that of you.’
As he unlocked the front door to 221B, he paused a moment on the other side.
–Oscar Wilde, ‘The Ballad of Reading Gaol’
‘Well…’ John equivocated, and for a moment Sherlock’s stomach plummeted with the idea that
John smiled. ‘In which case, maybe you’ll also listen to me when I say you’ve got to stop leaking things to reporters about how you’re at death’s door.’
Nodding, Sherlock escaped gratefully into the night.
‘Mycroft’s people, I think. Probably got him to go through a special high-res CCTV security gate at the Grand National or something, scanned everything they could without him noticing.’ Sherlock had mentioned something like this toward the beginning, when the possibility of digital or even imaginary records was striking John as more and more likely.
‘Let’s see him.’
Sherlock made quick work,
(1943). It's really actually very good -- a good case, good comedy... a good film. Much nationalism, though, because um #1943 so mind your heads there. And yes, those who've seen Series 4, that reference is as close as I'm getting to Eurus. But this chapter tried to knit together ACD, Rathbone, S4, the Bert Coules radio ep, and a few bits and bobs, so no wonder it's so hectic.
It wasn’t a kiss that needed to lead anywhere in particular, didn’t make demands on either of them, and when it came to a natural end, John continued to rest his forehead softly against Sherlock’s, with arms holding tight to the bespoke wool puckers at Sherlock’s elbows. He’d hated, bristled at the implication Molly made:
The light went off and a minute later he could just hear the pat of bare feet into the kitchen. So Day One of the Rest of His Life did, as it happened, include a woman. And Sherlock. Somehow, he wasn’t even surprised. Sighing, he shut his eyes and held on, indulging for the smallest moment in the floating, dreamy sensation that the world beyond what he could feel right here, right now, didn’t exist.
‘Were the cows nice, then? Make some friends?’ he replies brightly. They’re in his old room—her room now, gone a bit pink and a lot untidy—and he sets her down on the edge of her bed. She sways where he sits her.
‘How poetic,

making these sorts of things, even for yourself.’
There were infinite alternative answers to that question, but he hazarded, ‘Tampons?’ knowing it would derail Sherlock’s incredulous train of thought.

‘Yes,’ the Rinpoche agreed. ‘For its time. And we saw.’

‘Just… just let me know if she’s alright?’
), speculation that — as people were always stressing to him — the words on the surface were merely that: superficial, designed to deceive, or at least obfuscate, their subterranean meaning:
Sherlock’s mind zinged like the scrape of metal pins as the perfectly fitted facts slotted themselves into place: two years, Ayenat Braithwaite had said; Catherine Cusack, glamorous but attainable, flirtatious but clearly (to the objective observer) indifferent to his attentions; savings wasted on attempts at a private online business (failed), new wardrobe, and demonstrative gifts, all entirely unnoticed; delusional heist fantasy born of too many late night action film screenings, and a poor schoolboy’s idolatry of Robin Hood; and, judging from Sherlock’s last visit, a sense that, when his sister inevitably died within the next six months, he would have no family, no skills, and nothing left to lose.
and company in. Everything of importance will be there. Gruener is old-fashioned. He keeps a tight —‘ (he only just caught himself in time) ‘—
He contemplated the chicken option for a moment longer, then set it down and met Harry’s critical stare evenly. Her grey-blue eyes dared him to lie. ‘I wouldn’t know,’ he replied honestly, feeling a tiny twist of guilt in his stomach. ‘We… split up.’
She smiled. ‘Yes, I suppose.’ Biting her lip, she stared into the middle distance for a bit. Then: ‘So, we’re reasonably sure of a few things: first, that he does have some hard-copy, something tangible, that he uses as… as proof, or something, that he’s assaulted each of these girls.’
He was hard-pressed to give a single fuck about his back, no matter how knotted it was.
‘If you are
‘Those were hypothetical goals!’ Sherlock argued, jaw tensing against John’s shoulder, fingers tight on John’s ribs. ‘I’m not interested in hypothetical eventualities based on cultural norms and assumptions you’ve accrued from being just around – people!’ He spat the word with such venomous disgust, John couldn’t help but pull his head back and sit up to look at Sherlock, who lifted his chin just enough that his eyes – grey opal whirlpools in the dim – could meet John’s.
‘Afternoon,’ offered John cheerily, shifting back to complete his paragraph.
As ever, any changes (ie, errors) made since my incredibly helpful beta
,’ he growled, and thrust his hand below Sherlock’s waistband to grip his cock before he could overthink it. With relief and at least five degrees’ increase on his body temperature John found Sherlock hard and hot in his palm. He ran his thumb along his length causing Sherlock’s hips to stutter back into the sofa before jumping up into John’s grasp for more. Hungrily, John managed to shove Sherlock’s trousers down to his thighs and nearly came then and there at the sight of his hips, his cock, his dark wiry hair, the flushed naked plane of skin from his collarbone to his knees.
‘What’s this?’ John finally asked, picking up the box that slid into his leg. (How long would it have taken him to say something had Sherlock not taken that last turning at rather a speed?)
In the siren- and jackboot-rocked din of the paramedics arriving, Gruener, the guard, Mary, Molly, Suze, all being manhandled or carted or escorted away, John had been too preoccupied making sure the ambulance people had all the necessary information (acid, Christ, not a pretty weapon; he shoved aside the phantom odour of more serious guns and explosives, more dust and desert, more blood) to have much time to keep an eye on what became of Sherlock, never mind Mary. By the time he found him again – apparently arresting yet another guard, the outside one – the MI5 or whatever-they-were-in-suits-and-handguns had carted her off.
Sherlock sat, which at least apparently released everyone from the binding predicament of not being the first to stop standing.
John smiled. ‘I knew you could read minds.’
, like it wasn’t screaming for anyone to jump you and snog you senseless…’
Sherlock bucked his hips and relished the muffled groan that John failed to stifle, audible even beneath Sherlock’s own deafening rough breath.
She looked at him, a mixture of gratitude and distrust on her thin face. ‘I can hardly ask you the answer if Baron Gruener wants me to prove I’m not a fraud, can I?’
, he admitted, internally. But he was sure that John would be more than happy to demand what exactly he was sorry for, right here, in front of Mycroft and — in approximately one minute — their next client. The list would take longer than that.
‘I don’t think you live here?’ she breezed over him. Unruffled. Calm. Cool. ‘I’d have noticed you.’
), ‘Your sodding brother must think I’m the thickest —’
‘You’re already thinking about the case again, aren’t you.’
They climbed in, Sherlock into the driver’s seat, and John in the back beside Molly. Once the lumbar adjustments were made, Sherlock pulled the tight woollen cap over his hair, containing all of it, and making a radical departure from his usual appearance. Which was, of course, the point.
‘Perhaps I’ve been wrong to ignore John’s desire for a dog,’ Sherlock mused aloud. ‘Might come in

Heavily, Sherlock’s eyes crinkled up at the corners, and John wanted to climb onto the bed and cradle all of Sherlock’s limbs carefully and gratefully against himself and
, he was so turned-on and they’d barely got started. He was never going to leave this bed, just wring every ounce of pleasure out of Sherlock, every low broken sound that deafened them in the roaring quiet of his room, press every part of himself, bumps and ridges and inside and outside, into every part of Sherlock he could get to, outside and inside, until they’d ruined the bed. And then they could buy a new one and start over — no! They didn’t even have to — his old bed was upstairs! He had never been so happy to have his old, separate room as now.
Jargon aside, Sherlock’s little speech went smoothly, and John thought
‘I believe I offered to not-pay,’ Sherlock said quietly.

‘I shouted at her.’
Before Sherlock had time to congratulate himself further, John shoved him none too carefully back against the open sitting room doorframe. ‘Shut up.’
‘I know you could hear what I said to Suze before she left.’
John’s rages, unlike Sherlock’s, tended to be silent in their ferocity. But if John barged out to ‘walk it off’ now — no, he was pouring himself another measure — two — of Scotch. It was so frustratingly, wastefully
Ella would have told him.)
The darkness hid the smirk slipping from his face.
‘All right?’ John inquired, looking at the wet asphalt beneath their feet, his voice too low to be heard by the old man smoking in a doorframe as they walked past.
His fingers found the sweep of Sherlock’s cheek just as Sherlock scooted to lean over and kiss him, and John refused to worry about stitches or Suze or Mary or Molly, about any of the things they had said or done in their entire lives, and just kissed him back.
Ovid cheeped.
He was slightly out of breath. He hadn’t – hadn’t meant to go on at that length – hadn’t quite known his imagination had painted those pictures, contradictory in places, consciously or even unconsciously.
Still John was not there.
‘Five minutes alone in Gruener’s study would be more than sufficient, I promise you: I would leave with more than enough proof to put him away for a decade.’

‘From my hat,’ Sherlock told him, in a quick and quiet parody of a ring-master, ‘our rabbit.’
‘Of course.’
Eyes closed, Sherlock dug desperately through the dishevelled mess in his Mind Palace foyer, papers and mental images and soundbites from that day, all strewn about, sodden wet, as though a pipe had burst and torn through flooring and walls alike, mixing files and even furniture that were supposed to remain separate.
‘I knowed it,’ she reasons, arm dropping again and seeming immediately unfazed by the experience. ‘I made it better with my mind.’
‘Not if we keep talking,’ John said pointedly. ‘And you should sleep too. Forty minutes is not enough for someone still on a long-term physical therapy schedule. But,’ he interrupted, because Sherlock had started to protest, ‘whatever, do what you want: just… either lie down, or go finish sorting out my backstory.’ He settled more deeply into his pillow, tucking one hand underneath and wiggling his toes to warm the cold sheets up a bit. Yawning again, he started to work on slowing his heart rate and breathing, exhaling, evenly measuring each inhale and each —

Force of habit: John walked her to the lift (a little ridiculous since the room, big enough since they had it to themselves, was only a few steps away).

Gruener’s gentle chuckle felt like it was tolling ominously in his mind, clashing painfully with Maureen’s acetic scepticism.
His gaze remained focussed on the soap between his fingers. ‘When did you know it was Mary?’
John had not mentioned a particular date on which their relationship was… confirmed? Accredited? (That made them sound like a university rather than a couple.) Certainly not ‘serious’: they’d been solemnly devoted to each other before there had been any sexual interaction — or, deliberate sexual intercourse, perhaps was more truthful — between them at all. Whatever the correct terminology, there had been no precise date affixed to it. Nor had this seemed to matter. But it struck him, now, as slightly odd, that he had spent 797 days in France, Norway, Serbia, Indonesia, Florida, Venezuela, counting every single day like a toll on his life, as though each precious one stretched and contracted into the distance, taking with it the finite amount of time on the earth that he could, should be spending with John Watson. And so to discover that, having — so improbably, so utterly humblingly —
Returning from his Mind Palace to the sitting room wall, Sherlock reflected that he was glad this case had come in. Whatever his renewed commitment to taking seriously the problems of any (even

— bloody politicians and underground peers of the state. Secrets from one end to the other. He could probably work it out in under an hour, but to do that he would have to give a damn. Gruener was a major criminal, no doubt in his mind, but Sherlock was done hunting shadows and only ever finding more.
He smiled minutely at the picture of Sherlock, forced to play by the book and do his own bloody clean-up after a case. He hoped Bradstreet would add to their growing album of such unusual moments.
… He filled his lungs with it. Passers-by took no notice of him, a hazy sensation he had hoped to have abandoned completely after returning to 221b. Sherlock closed his eyes.
It seemed surreal. Empty words, from a different life. (Maybe, in his eventual write-up of these years, he could weave Mary’s story into a case. One of the rich City clients that preferred to remain anonymous.
‘Er, no. And some of them are my friends, too.’

. A moment later, John had shoved his own belt open and Sherlock did at last manage to contribute because he was not, under any circumstances, going to get in John’s way when that direction was mutual nudity. Kicking away his trousers, he spread his legs wider to allow John some room.
‘Tea emergency?’ Sherlock guessed sardonically.
Another long moment (in which Sherlock tried fiercely not to fidget), John nodded once more. ‘Well. That’s not exactly the explanation I was hoping for, but,’ he looked up at Sherlock still poised in the very centre of the room, ‘I guess it means I can delete her from my contacts list.’
‘Many of these were difficult to acquire,’ Gruener preened. ‘These English vendors are so squeamish. Fortunately, I have friends who are helpful in these matters.’

Footsteps again – Sherlock peeked over the edge of a refracted-glass shelf – Suze’s whole self was now glowing like the Byzantine icons in the recessed corridor, but with the modern amendment of a gun rather than a lily or lamb outstretched, while her other, gloved hand grasped something (too tight a grip to be a button for a bomb? dear god, he hoped it wasn’t an actual bomb, but only the very limited object his deductions concluded it would be), arm as it had been when she’d been at Baker Street, wrapped self-protectively across her chest.

[a long night of the soul]
Sherlock didn’t look up from his computer screen, so it fell to John (for the millionth time) to do the work of being a conversant, polite human being: ‘Oh?’
‘No more words,’ Sherlock murmured, without moving. ‘Get out.’
After a moment, John bowed the crown of his head (Sherlock scrutinized the difference between the fair blond strands in the light at the top of his head versus the earthly brown (or so it appeared in the shadows on either side).) Then John exhaled again. ‘I think — I need you to promise.’
Visibly relieved to return to the proper chain of command, the spotty young man nodded once and weaved between them in the direction of the mess.
‘Yeah, because you’ve been spoiled by

done that? How many hands had he grown in the last few minutes?); his neck was wet and red and bruising where John’s mouth had been.
John managed to get an over-stuffed pillow behind himself while Sherlock, probably unhelpfully, held John’s skull tipped up towards his in kisses, entwining them, kneecaps bumping as he climbed — too many limbs, fitting awkwardly, arms and legs like crash test dummies or puppets, knocking about blindly —

Getting down on one knee like a sprinter, he budged up close to Sherlock, who turned under heavy eyelids to peer at him warily.
Sherlock was clearly holding his tongue, looking into John’s eyes keenly; he was keeping himself, what he actually thought, behind a wall. It was
‘Turned out,’ Molly continued, a knowing smile in her voice, ‘it was a birthmark. His wife had to identify it.’
But clearly Sherlock seemed to think it was a cataclysm, standing there with his shoulders hunched.
‘So it’s about one thing now: shout or crawl?’
Once, just after Baskerville, Sherlock had almost involuntarily found himself standing in just the same spot, watching John thrash and hyperventilate and howl in his dreams. Paralysed, Sherlock had tried to recall what he had read since signing the lease on the subject of sleep disorder anxiety episodes, but had found himself unable to make the requisite motions from doorway to bedside. Pillows and sheets had been shoved at odd angles. The mattress had groaned slightly as John had dug his heels physically (and no doubt metaphorically) in. But still he had continued unconscious. Then suddenly, John’s mouth had formed a single articulate word, ‘
‘Mr Ramani, we may not be the police, but our investigation is taking us to Bow Street, where I’m sure Inspector Bradstreet would be keen to hear about you weekend in Dundee with your employer. So let me advise you again, take us upstairs.’
John stared blearily up at him. ‘You’re dressed.’
Molly scrambled to her feet, unsteady like an Olympic runner after a 100m dash, and moved towards Suze who was crumpled on the ground –
John nodded at the table, refusing to smile.
‘“Complications,”’ repeated John, rubbish a finger (habit) over his right eyebrow, in the same flat, unimpressed tone. ‘Do you have any idea how lucky we’ve been?’ He shook his head, then swallowed. ‘Two bloody years wasn’t enough of a “complication” to make you consider that you are not in fact omnipotent?’
John’s stomach gave a leap of victory despite this laconic reply, then felt a stab of guilt. Mrs St Clair’s face, proud and hopeful and sure of her husband’s survival, winked into his memory.
‘No? Really? You?’
The woman, in multi-coloured lycra leggings (thirty-one or -two, Iberian ancestry, avid social media user, regular runner but also today exercising away a hangover from a work-do with several closer-than-colleagues that she preferred not think about now, bisexual) had given them a wide and good-natured smile, and then looked to John, as everyone did.
Standing with definitive purpose, John advised, ‘Maybe Mrs Hudson would be better for this?’
‘Pa-pa-pa-’
His breathing had settled during the brain-dulling tedium of ‘paperwork’, but he marched homeward attempting to pretend to himself that he was not at all nervous that John had left. Hedging his bets, he diverted three streets and picked up their dry cleaning and some batteries (John’s old electric razor was nearly dead) before resuming his route. His step felt uneven the whole way.

‘You going somewhere with this?’ he inquired stiffly. ‘Or can it wait until we’re not eating?’
(John resisted rolling his eyes. Shinwell, mostly known as ‘Porky’, Johnson was one of Sherlock’s underground informants, happier to spill to them than to the police and get himself a visit from some nasty people. Half the time his information was bollocks, but Sherlock persisted in meeting him all over the city, peevishly groaning that ‘Even the smallest mote of dust could be the foundation for a criminal case some day.’ Utter crap, John thought, so he usually kept his remarks to the short (and admittedly sarcastic).)

Objectively, it was true: Sherlock’d managed to get down a bit of solid food today, and even stood up just after lunch. But his pallor after going round the room fully once, the dark rings under his eyes, the hour-long nap he’d succumbed to once they’d got him back into bed (

John was scooting to lever his now-bare back against the arm of the sofa as he lifted his hips to rid himself of his jeans — Sherlock helped —
‘I imagine the staff records will quite wrongly list him as a “commissionaire”,’ mused Sherlock, texting furiously, as the taxi neared Baker Street. ‘And you should see Mycroft’s bathroom. You’d be sick.’
to the whole case that had driven John and, yes, himself, to the brink of what they could bear. More intellectually stimulating than locating jewels or trailing cheating husbands but... there was a price, too. One in a currency with which he was not familiar.)
‘Are you —’
Another kiss, more, lingering, narcotic, blissfully slow. (For himself, he would have been content to do little else for the next several hours but continue to breathe in and out, bodies fusing slowly until he could not expand his lungs without crowding space occupied by John’s heaving chest… But, as expected:)
Striding out, fully dressed for the day, Sherlock breezed past without missing a beat: ‘I don’t have any birthmarks either.’
‘Got samosas,’ John announced, joining him. ‘Couldn’t resist, they smelled absolutely — ’
‘Mphlf!’ John managed in surprise, before sinking into the kiss. His heart-rate pounded in his ears as Sherlock’s warm tongue caressed his. ‘T-tomorrow?’ he choked out, as Sherlock pressed his entire body, shins to collar, into contact with John’s; the heat of his skin against John’s already warm skin was
A memory, or constellation of memories, surfaced in his mind: Sherlock pestering him for weeks, trying to catch him off-guard, hoping to deduce (‘Henry.’) or surprise (‘Humphry!’) or maybe just stumble upon (‘Higgins…?’) John’s middle name. The invasion of privacy, at the time, of coming home one afternoon to see Sherlock reviewing a birth certificate John had quite definitely not given him, had been mitigated by a sense – even then, before Irene, before the full hell of Moriarty, before what came after – of the lengths Sherlock would go to know him,
. ‘Ideas. My room, now.’
‘Is that what you think of me?’ he heard himself wonder. ‘A dragon-slayer?’
‘Er,’ said John. When had he stopped listening to music during cases? He loved music, though his eclectic lack of pickiness had set Sherlock off more times than John liked to recall. Cooking, tidying, or just sitting around reading or blogging between cases, yeah, a bit of Thelonious Monk, Bowie, Adam and the Ants, (on a really nostalgic day) Bananarama, even once in a while — with the silver lining that it’d please Sherlock — some Beethoven. But the problem was, of course, that it so often

He was, he knew, mercurial, impulsive, and domineering — all useful traits, it emerged and continued to prove in his years with Alec, with the Met, outsmarting his brother, outsmarting the drug dealers, outsmarting nearly every idiotic person who entered his sphere of notice. —

Their rough breath continued to fill the bedroom as John automatically grabbed a handful of tissues and scrubbed away what he could, allowing Sherlock to shift onto his side, the sharp bone of his shoulder sticking familiarly into John’s.
Every so often, John chuckled at the screen, evidently settled in but still very much awake, already somehow engrossed in a programme he must have seen before.
‘Just the one,’ John said reasonably.
‘We have to get up.’
‘A hat?’
He nodded in thanks, trying to think of any earthly topic that might steer them back to calm waters. What was on telly lately? — An intake of breath was all the warning he got as the dam broke:

Soundlessly, Lady Morcar nevertheless emanated an air of complete shock. After a moment she took the Blue Carbuncle into her palm, probably testing its weight or smoothness or possibly just making sure it was not a mirage.
Again John bristled. ‘But I’m here. And you’re here. Even today, when… But I’m staying,’ he added, with sudden shift in tone.
Oh! And -- in my capacity as actual professional Victorianist -- it behooves me to mention that Mycroft's off-hand remark about 'the maiden tribute of modern Babylon' refers in fact a series of salacious 1885 exposés about the selling of virgins into prostitution, written (and scandalously under-cover discovered) by W.T. Stead, famed odd Victorian journalist, who then went on to die on the Titanic. The

(At some point, he was going to have to inform Sherlock that sex in the morning was a particularly effective way to make sure John didn’t waste the entire day keyed up and hyper-alert to every ruddy thing he encountered. Or else he should make a habit of having a shower directly after leaving Sherlock in bed.)
when Neville St Clair had disappeared leaving nothing but a blood splatter in an East End drug hovel, leaving the one person in his life who had sworn in words and actions to believe in him, to trust him, to put him ahead of everyone and everything else because she loved him, this man had made this woman believe he was dead, had blind-sided her with the fear that kept her up at nights and stopped her midway through her coffees while she watched the news, throat tight, terrified, with the knowledge that one day, someday, the best part of her life would require her identification so it could be put in the

Instead he hung up his jacket, shoved his rucksack under the bottom shelf, and swiveled his armchair towards the —
The theatrics of criminals really did deserve its own monograph, Sherlock mused, strolling unhurriedly towards his adversary. The man had, entirely as a power play, kept Sherlock waiting in this overlarge treasure house (a converted church turned ultra-modern mansion, a sepulchre to his self-aggrandizement, as chilling and offensive to taste as the man himself) filled with his eclectically displayed
‘You should lie on your back,’ he informed him.
‘Mmm,’ Molly allowed. ‘And it’s not, well… not microscope slides or anything fragile like that: not exactly sexy to make the person you’re trying to sleep with stare into a microscope.’ (John took a moment to admit to himself that the image of Sherlock hunched over a microscope, dexterous hands wheeling the lenses about, absurd skin illuminated by the light underneath the platform, did plenty for him. But he took her point.)
‘Get it,’ said John roughly, sounding drunk, ‘it’s probably Bradstreet or Lestrade at –’ he rolled to peer at his clock, ‘– half past ten at night.’
She crossed her arms and looked him over, appraising. ‘My husband made a similar remark to me, the day before our wedding. I’m not an overly romantic person by nature, but… I was afraid, really, that people would talk – a fashion model, marrying into a title, and all that. “Is it the gossip you’re worried about?” he asked me. “I’m only afraid I’ll miss the chance to spend my life with you.”’ She smiled. ‘Of course, later I discovered he had shamelessly stolen that line from a book, but by then I’d married him.’
For a moment, John was overwhelmed with affection for the wild, brusque genius who was unconsciously placating their exotic pet. (The bird, in spite of himself, was growing on him.) But today, while he did feel slightly, madly drawn to this more pliable Sherlock, irritation sparked between his shoulder blades and along his lower abdomen, both because Sherlock was clearly avoiding any contact with John, and because, between Yard sergeants, Mycrofts, and landladies,
‘She dead, then? Got herself killed, like I told her she would.’ Her laugh was bitter and aspirated: smoker since early adolescence. ‘Stupid cow.’
But Harry was on a roll now: ‘Brilliant of you to wait, though, ‘til mum and dad had died, I guess,’ she sneered, her face drawn into a look he’d seen on her before, both sober and drunk, always vicious. ‘How horrible for them to have one queer in the family, but

He looked up and met John’s eyes, crescented with amusement.
A while later, he pulled himself into his jeans, and put on another t-shirt; he removed his socks, slightly annoyed with himself. He never slept well with his socks on.
‘Exactly,’ Sherlock grimaces.
‘Sorry I didn’t have it gift-wrapped,’ he added. ‘Feel free to deduct that on your expenses claim.’
Ryder!) was to be found lurking behind a lamp or beneath their furniture. ‘Since when is Ryder the suspect?’
Some murmuring from the kitchen and answering coddling murmurs of affirmation grated on his already taxed nerves, so he retreated further into his Mind Palace.
Bracing his right hand just under Sherlock’s armpit on the settee, John’s forehead bumped with Sherlock’s as he panted, drinking down air as Sherlock teased the nape of his neck with his fingers, kissing John’s cheek and jaw and neck with a purposefulness that made him see stars.
(Had the world any justice, Mycroft would not be familiar with the workings of miniaturised photographic novelty items, and Sherlock would have the very muted pleasure of explaining it to him.)
, so that when he finally tripped that wire it felt like it a fifty-story controlled demolition, predictable yet earth-shattering as it wrung him out completely, loosing the farthest reaches of John’s body and setting him aloft like an arrow off a bow, harder and better than he had ever climaxed in his life.
‘Maybe it’ll sort itself out,’ John continued to insist. ‘Lestrade’s had a big break with this child prostitution syndicate. Good of your brother to get me those files while a Yard DI was sitting right next to me.’
He hadn’t been gone all that long, the Violet interview (if he could even call it that, rather than a massive waste of time and a frustrating failure of his ability to stop someone doing something incredibly stupid) taking only about an hour, and Sherlock had informed him (as he grandly swooped into a cab) that he would probably be occupied all afternoon. Even so, it was difficult not to take out his phone immediately to text him. Since they’d gone back to taking cases, they hadn’t separated very often — not more than the length of Sherlock’s running stride ahead of John’s, and usually that only last a block or two before John caught him up.
‘I thought it just… sort of… happened.’
‘No, I know,’ John huffed. ‘The house has its own art studio, though: that’s got to be part of it, surely?’
‘Isn’t it just,’ Sherlock spat, turning with a scratching whisper of his shoes on the hideously bleached-and-tarnished floor. ‘Bradstreet, arrest this
start accepting that, maybe it’ll get easier.’
For 797 days after the fall (the jump — the circus leap) from Bart’s, John had discovered, beyond anything he’d ever known before, exactly how true that proverb was. More than true: it was real. It was realer than work, than taste, than people laughing, than the time on the clock, than the news, than danger. For the first few days after Sherlock had died, John felt like his body, even when he was standing upright in the shower or sitting calmly on the tube (or most often in his chair in the flat, staring), was really somehow being pulled to the floor. His neck ached uncannily like he was really wearing one: a large, impossibly heavy stone wheel on a chain. (In his mind, it was the same material, the same age and weight and vast primeval incomprehensibility, as the blocks of Stonehenge.) His movements — going to the toilet, helping arrange the funeral, waking in the middle of the night to force down some food so that when he was sick there would at least be something to expel… — all this was a holograph, a false double-image. In reality he was lying pinned on the pavement beside Sherlock’s body on the pavement, and he was pretty well convinced he would never manage to get up again, which was fine, since where else did he want to go?

‘I apologise,’ because this was the heart of the problem: his own utter emotional inconsistency; an ability he simply lacked. ‘That was not intended to —’
‘But then our client – whoever they may be – would find Miss de Merville distraught and undissuaded from the Baron, and we might not get paid. Which reminds me Molly: I believe you would be agreeable to terms of one-third the client’s sum, whatever it comes to?’
‘If Henry Baker really did purchase a parrot’ (‘Pretty parrot, yes you are,’ said Ovid, and Sherlock stroked his ear-tufts to quieten him.) ‘for the sole purpose of entering the good books of his recently-distant ornithologist wife, he will require a bird that can repeat the phrases which – according to Mr. Breckinridge – were taught to Flint’ (‘Flint! Linus! Soup’s on!’) ‘before she was acquired. If, on the other hand, Henry Baker is involved in the burglary, he will use any excuse to avoid taking this bird home once it becomes clear that Ovid has not ingested anything of any human value.’ He examined Ovid for a moment. ‘So far as I know.’
Sherlock regarded him with (masked) confusion. Why this particular reference was so disagreeable to John, he had no idea: if he’d known anything about the book/film/programme/other media work, he’d evidently deleted it.
She smiled kindly at him, eyes crinkling in half-moons. ‘John, I may not be in my youth, dear, but I don’t plan on staying in bed because of every tiny cough or ache, or I’d never get out of it!’
‘Oh, Mr Holmes… you don’t know the half of it.’
He opened his eyes: Challa was still talking, somehow, but John was watching him closely with a slightly altered expression.
John couldn’t breathe; he wasn’t sure he could stay in this room with the farcically bumbling police officers and Sherlock, rapidly deflating with boredom. He turned, moving the sergeant and constable aside possibly only with his thunderous expression, and started for the exit.
. Didn’t even want me to go to work, said he could look after me better at — at home.’
For those curious,
Sherlock swivelled, striding down the narrow tiled corridor to stand definitively before the last and only shut door.
‘Well she’s clearly been owned by someone with taste, if nothing else,’ he ventured. ‘And perhaps a sense of humour.’
Sherlock’s hand intruded dumbly and wrapped around his own, his fingers adding pressure to John’s and suddenly John’s rhythm became a punishing erratic pull of two, three strokes and then,
His options (and therefore
‘Mmm,’ Sherlock murmured, inwardly euphoric with relief and letting a small percentage show through the surface. ‘My research paid off, as usual.’
‘Good heavens!’

to stab me. But she… didn’t shy away from doing it. Wet work: very probably a familiar province.’
(his ancestral flora) — weathered the barrage of Sherlock’s deductions, shaking off the sting of it and
‘No rubber duckies, I’m afraid,’ she chimed brightly, and John caught her eye in amusement. Sherlock grabbed the towel and turned to the red plastic bucket where the constable had plopped it heavily. He looked like a man on his way to an Aston Martin car wash.
‘Gruener employs multiple security personnel —’
‘What,’ repeated Ovid, in a near-perfect mimic of John’s voice.
John expected him to be close enough to interrupt his sleep. Therefore John expected them to sleep together.
John had attempted to kiss him earlier, which had been euphoric and positive, but Sherlock couldn’t work properly to secure John Horner’s liberty and catch James Ryder while imagining, with leaping, nauseated thoughts, how painful it would be when John told him he was too much.
‘? There was no going back.
As ever, despite departing from the show at TRF, corresponding moments tether my version to canon-Series 3, because WOW even still it's hard to believe some of that actually happened.
John’s own heart is in his throat, because as stupid and helicopterish as it makes him, he hates it when anything bigger than a dachshund even crosses the street near them some days. She’s still small enough that everything lights up his danger instincts if he’s in that sort of mood, and worst of all she’s clever enough lately to have worked out how to get herself into trouble but—for reasons both developmentally and parental—she hasn’t quite learned the best self-protective reflexes.
It was too much –
The corridor was deserted, illuminated in faint bronze by the most elegant track-lighting money could buy, and Sherlock slipped between the recess in what had once, in a world that knew nothing of the chaos erupting in the hall, been a vestry. No cameras here – another security mistake.
John opened his eyes a sliver. He wasn’t sure what that meant. ‘Even you?’
Sherlock blinked at the screen for a moment, then handed the phone back. ‘Surely you haven’t forgotten how to read?’
It wasn’t raining any more, he noted absently as he walked, just gusting with the promise of changeable autumn storms. The sun had barely had time to come out and, overcast, it wasn’t likely to, which meant his jacket was clinging clammily to his neck. His feet carried him quickly down Baker Street as he mentally rehearsed an excuse for Dr. Punde, while simultaneously considering how much of any excuse he’d need if he went back now and finished making up with Sherlock after last night’s quasi-row (make up properly, maybe even a little roughly).
– elsewhere. ‘Besides, Ricoletti was a shit. Terrible agent, terrible bloke. Leave him.’
Any remaining errors mine: do let me know if you spot any!
Sherlock did look up, just a quick glance, to find John topping up his glass again with water. No tension or other tells of reluctance, passive aggression, or blame.
Mrs. Hudson stirred, getting off the stool with a pat to his knee, and he realised he had basically been staring. It had been a long time since Mrs. Hudson had bothered to comment (obliquely of course) on his and Sherlock’s odd, somewhat tumultuous habits, so he was hardly surprised that she hid a smirk as she went to place her teacup in the sink. She did not appear to have other symptoms besides the cough, so, he conceded, she was probably right in thinking it just a summer cold; but she – like Sherlock, no wonder they got on so well – often refused help, so her venturing up to have him check was, itself, an indicator of her ill health. He watched her in case she needed his arm.
John ceased poking him, momentarily speechless. Then, attempting normalcy, he clambered off the sofa, shoving Sherlock’s tangle of legs to the floor with a muted
‘Don’t worry, John, I’m sure there’s a course you could take that would get you beyond two-digit keypad typing.’
‘You should go home, John.’
Well. When I started this series, I was in another country, in another degree; there was no Brexit, or Trump, or TAB, nevermind series 4.
Chapter 7: John
Chapter 11:
Bradstreet held up a hand. ‘Hold on, Holmes, hold on. We’re working this case, true enough, but I think Horner’s our man. And Peterson is taking another two people this morning over to the hotel to get the remaining alibis.’ He offered a slight smile.
He shifted back to place his weight back on his own feet; Sherlock tilted forward with him, feeling off-kilter and light-headed, in a manner not dissimilar to being inebriated. He wanted to lean into John and fuse himself there. When John placed a hand to the small of his back, his ring-finger sliding below the fabric to rub along his skin, he shivered, and allowed John to push him towards the stairs. As he walked, John’s fingers skittered around his waist until, a pace ahead, he almost let go – Sherlock’s hand flew up of its own accord, curling his rigidised knuckles to hook his fingertips with John’s, as he crowded him on the bottom stair. He had never climbed the next thirteen steps faster, even with his toes kicking the soles of John’s shoes in their haste. On the top step, John swirled round and kissed him and began – or continued, Sherlock wasn’t sure – undressing him, while simultaneously pulling him backwards into the room. Sherlock tried to help but he could hardly keep from going to pieces so here as elsewhere, he added as a footnote to his admittedly impressionistic observations, he almost certainly just got in his own way.
‘I like it,’ he announced loudly, as two lads in football kit and high-vis trainers (it was broad daylight. Honestly.) walked past chatting loudly (one hated his job — skipping off today, meeting with uni friends, hoping to network with other friend’s colleagues for new job; had golden retriever; parents in/from Shropshire; frequent user of online dating apps —; the other, almost identical, but with a girlfriend and her cat).
since we are at the risk of actually

‘I’ll just go get dressed,’ Molly informed the widening silence.
‘There’s plenty of lamb madras and naan left,’ John informed him, standing only inches away with his arms folded. Sherlock nodded thickly and shuffled over to the refrigerator. John’s fingers itched to drag him down for a syrup-slow good morning — well, a good afternoon — a
research).
John’s spine went rigid. He turned now to look down, past Sherlock’s dark gaze, nearly level from where he sat on the lid of the toilet, to his shirt still open – though at least tonight he’d at least lost the driver’s oversized jacket, baggy and all wrong – and skin exposed to the unheated air, like the night they’d rowed after the opera, but now the normal pasty white was flushed and pained and bruised and raw. He didn’t… He clamped down, hard, on as many thoughts clawing in his head as possible and tried to stay in control.
‘You’ll have to speak to your sister eventually,’ he pointed out.
She wasn’t wrong.
‘Christopher.’ He offered a hand across his body, a little awkwardly.
Sherlock’s frown was etched all over his face. ‘It only escaped my notice directly afterwards.
‘Fuck
‘Lie flat,’ John grunted, as though his voice wasn’t as wrecked as it sounded even to himself in the quiet, budging up so he could curl once more around him, nose to toes. His feet were warming up already.
He felt, with his militarily-trained internal clock, that it was probably somewhere just before five, so he doubted he would sleep much more than another hour. If he timed it right, he could wake before Sherlock… could kiss him awake.
‘Pa-pa pa pa pa? pa-pa pa pa pa?’ pealed Flint,
John shook his head faux-sadly at Hopkins’s back. ‘Talk about adding insult to injury.’
, playing dress up, two old mad…
As usual, his body did precisely the opposite of what he craved: somnambulantly carrying him to the uncharacteristically regulation-tidy bed (he ground his teeth), throwing him down upon it so that his whole vision was taken up with Poe’s sunken, peculiar face. He too contemplated murder.
A moment and he was on his feet. He didn’t bother to look at her again: simply released a heavy, furious breath and marched out of the restaurant without another word.
Sherlock resisted rolling his eyes once more. ‘Yes, of course.’
He watched Sherlock roll up his sleeves with geometric exactitude, then crouch to submerge the cloth in the steaming bucket. His hands plunged into the water and reappeared, pink and slippery and twitchy from the stinging heat, and John thought that Jacobs might have been foolish enough to bring boiling water after all.
‘Something along those lines, I wouldn’t be surprised. Although, “nurse” is probably not her role,’ he added under his breath.
He tries to think. His body is missing, somehow, has been replaced with someone else’s —
‘I could do the disguise. A… a moustache, I dunno, dye my hair — we could figure something out —’
He sighed. John was knackered, if he was honest, too knackered to worry about anything more than the time, Sherlock’s pill regimen, and the day they had coming tomorrow — well, today. He yawned. Shameful. Ordinarily he could go days without it. But then again he hadn’t had a proper full night’s rest in god knew how long, and neither — despite his less-than-an-hour long kip during dinner — had Sherlock. Maybe in an hour or so he could talk Sherlock into letting them lie down, just for a bit, just to rest their eyes…
‘But for fuck’s sake, he’s
‘Oh,’ said Sherlock simply, his nose pressing into John’s cheek as he breathing hitched. John, unsure how long he himself could go on, arranged Sherlock’s low hips forward to force their cocks to slot together, this time hot and skin-tight. When he flailed wildly for his bedside, Sherlock pulled his face back an inch to examine John’s, which began to say, ‘I’ve got –’ before he interrupted, ‘Yes, of course,’ and spread his long arm to rummage in the nightstand until he found the bottle beneath John’s spare notepad.
. And he
Surprised, John did look round, into his every-colour eyes that were reflecting the light from the kitchen.
Ooh boy. No S4 spoilers but... yeah, John's kind of a shit. It is known.
) and… went to have a shower.
John half-laughed on an exhale, fingers threading the long curls at the back of Sherlock’s brilliant head, the soft lobes of his ears, the ripples of flesh of his neck twisted against John’s. For 797 days John had wondered, scraping at his own imagination until it felt like he was bleeding inwardly, if Sherlock had ever had feelings for him. Whether he was even important to Sherlock, or just another variable to play with before casting away. What his feelings had really been. Whether Sherlock, as John had told himself and a few other people time and again, even felt things that way.
so John paid the driver, distractedly assuming that he probably looked like exactly what he was: a bloke off to get lucky after a posh night out (more specifically, a man to shag the living daylights out of the man he jumped after).
Several minutes later he pulled himself into his old striped dressing gown, towelling off the last of the water and the preceding day. He needed to shave in the morning, but, he thought as he switched off the light with relief, that could wait too.
Sherlock’s ears burned; of course Mycroft had noticed their situation. ‘And how go the troop withdrawals, Mycroft? Everyone home on schedule?’ he parried. (This was an area proven to alienate his brother from John, a move Sherlock was keen to foster since they were behaving rather too much as they considered Sherlock and his parrot the opposition.)
This drove at the heart of it: how he had eluded them – clever, impressively clever; but foolish, too – fiddly, immature, conceited. And this of course was entirely consistent with the man’s profile: antiquated, proud even unto overplaying his hand, and interested in childish things. (In childhood; in children.)
while I was out of the picture. Mycroft kept me generally apprised of your status: Mike Stamford and the new clinic and that truly
Years of his life had gone by in which John had wondered, really painfully wondered, if he could tell when Sherlock cared and when he was shamming — when he was speaking from the heart and when he just sounded like it. This, John knew, looking at Sherlock illuminated by the lowest angle of daylight, just as cars were beginning to think of headlamps and traffic and their tea waiting at home — this was the real kind. Sherlock trusted Molly; had trusted her (and John had to swallow the thick air in his throat as he thought of it) when he had trusted almost no one else, not even John. (What had gone on between them? John thought of Molly like a co-worker, or a middling cousin, the sort of person he’d always stop to check on if he saw them in the street, but might not remember to text or see for months together. But Molly and Sherlock shared something: treated each other differently, since Moriarty.)
‘Sherlock, she’s fine.’
‘Christ,’ John jumped, and he swiftly moved to repay the gesture, struggling to tug Sherlock’s shirt off. As it popped over his head and ruffled his mess of curls John bent up to lick his right nipple.
Once again Bradstreet dropped his voice. ‘And what, in the name of heaven, do you have my constable fetching a bird bath for?’
‘I must first begin by asking how much you know of Baron Heinrich Gruener.’
Little did she know, of course, that ‘snap’, in Mary’s case, apparently meant ‘shoot you in cold blood.’
At least a bit.
, whispered a familiar (impossible) voice echoing down the corridors of his Mind Palace.
Frowning slightly, he said, ‘When we try.’
— and so it sat, on the mantle, with their other assorted objects. For a week, every time John had gone to sit in his chair, his eyes had traced a particular constellation from the rock, to grate (even when empty, which it usually was), to the headphoned bison, to Sherlock’s chair (to Sherlock). Even when, in the months since, cases had proved disappointing or John's surgery work had upset him (or the singular difficulty of combining their wardrobes into what had formerly been Sherlock's room), all of which brought them both to the edges of their tempers, their rows were less vicious, less fraught, and their (often wordless) apologies somehow knitted from a skein of trust brought home from Scotland.
with each other?
’, until his brain screamed –
‘— your best friend’ (he swallowed any other epithet for himself) ‘is a sociopath who solves crimes as an alternative to getting high; YOU! You, most of all, you’re a doctor who decided to go to a warzone. You shot a cabbie the night you met me —’
His heart slid coldly into his gut, still hammering.
‘Ah, ah, ah,’ he chided, enjoying this turn of events to an extent
Having deduced a great deal about the man from his writing style and chosen subject, the question remained: how could such a sleek cat as Baron Heinrich Gruener be exposed for the brutal criminal he was?
