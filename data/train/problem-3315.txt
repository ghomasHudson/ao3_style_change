“I am so sorry, Max.  I don’t know what to do.  I can’t develop feelings for the person I am protecting.  Then I will screw things up majorly and can’t place his life in peril.”
Castiel reluctantly nodded and thanked the actor.  Gabriel had already left the suite to go shopping at Christian Dior’s boutique with Dean’s American Express Black Card.  Gabe’s shopping excursion took too long so Dean and Cas left to the press conference without him.  Castiel remained close to his charge and was like a hawk searching out for its prey.  The conference lasted for ninety minutes and the international press fell in love with Dean’s flirtatious manner.  He had them eating out of the palm of his hand after his first witty reply.
Castiel smirked.  “Let’s go.  We have a lot of work to do.”
Someone knocked incessantly on Castiel’s bedroom door.  The bodyguard swiftly wiped the tears from his eyes and lean cheeks before rapidly getting to his feet.  He cleared his throat before opening the door.  Gabe stood in the hallway smiling at him.  “Sorry to bug you, Cas, but Deano instructed me to come over here and change your bandage.”  He wiggled the antibiotic ointment in mid air.  Cas hesitated for a moment but eventually bid the short man to enter.
Dean lied back down after he read his lover’s text.  Now he could actually fall asleep knowing Cas was safe and on his way home.  The actor was unaware someone was in the process of breaking into his home.  Adam was dressed in a black turtleneck sweater, black cargo pants and matching military boots.  He carried a small backpack on his right shoulder.  It held rope, a pistol with silencer, a Kabar utility knife and a bottle containing chloroform.  Adam had shut off the duplex’s electricity before heading to the backdoor.
The trio exited the interrogation room.  Gabriel ran up to them.  “I’ve been told my Sammy will be released soon!  What the hell happened?”
“His arm is being placed in a cast as we speak and afterwards he will be groggy due to the pain medication he was administered.   You two should go home and return later this afternoon.  He will be more alert by that time.”
The following afternoon, the ventilator was removed from Cas.  He was breathing on his own, which was a very good sign.   No infection had set in after the surgery and transfusions.  Later that evening he was transported to his own room.  Dean was allowed to remain with him.  A young red haired nurse rolled a cot in for him.  She blushed after he thanked and hugged her.
“Does that mean you like it?  I even got Dean to help me paint the sky since he did not want me to fall from the ladder.”
The five men all played at first but then the showdown was between Dean and Max.  It was a close one but the American won in the end.  “Game well played, mate.”  Max offered Dean his hand and the blond man shook it.  “You too, man.”
“No!  I am tired of being the one, who is emotionally invested in this relationship.”  A furious Dean turned to Max, pointing a finger at the flabbergasted actor.  “And you!  Don’t think I don’t know what you are trying to do.  Finagle your way into Cas’ good graces and seduce him.  Then he will leave me.”
Samuel strode to the tub wearing only a pair of white boxer briefs.  Gabriel licked his lips appreciatively as his amber eyes raked across the Scottish Adonis’ chiseled physique.  Sam and his ramrod erection stood right in front of him.  Gabriel lowered the underwear.  His mouth trailed kisses down Sam’s hardboard abs until it reached the tip of the engorged, red cock.  His tongue laved the pre-cum before he took all of Sam in.  The Scotsman moaned as his hands dug deep into the shorter man’s shoulders.  In no time he came within Gabe’s mouth.  Gabriel held his hands to assist him in finally entering the Roman tub.
When Gabe returned to the spacious and bright kitchen, Castiel was preparing a fruit salad.  The bodyguard smiled at him.  “I know you must be hungry.”  Gabriel nodded and gave him his thanks.
Fassbinder quickly replied, “He and I can share mine.”  Castiel’s face turned beet red.
He could be so sweet, Castiel thought to himself.  He smirked and told the actor everything was fine.  All of a sudden, Cruella Deville interrupted them.  The rude model did not acknowledge Cas and invited Dean to dinner.  Castiel was surprised the beanpole actually ate!  Dean cast a rapid glance at Cas but the latter just shrugged his shoulders.  Gabriel decided to rejoin them at that moment.
Dean was whisked away to wardrobe and Gabriel went to see if he could get a couple of free samples of the cologne.  Castiel felt out of his element as he sipped espresso over at the crafts table.  Out of nowhere a tall and willowy beauty appeared with an entourage.  The beanpole must be Dean’s leading lady in the commercial.
“Gabe, let’s get the hell out of here.  I am suffocating with all this attention.”
Gabriel flew out of his seat and embraced Cas wholeheartedly.  He kissed the bodyguard on the lips.  “Thanks, Cas!  This is the best news I have ever received.  I knew my Sammy was innocent.”
“Of course not, beautiful” The tall man languorously ran his thumb across her plump lower lip.  His firm mouth covered hers in a greedy kiss.  The foreigner’s large hands cupped her firm ass causing her to moan.  A few minutes later the two of them had to break the kiss for much needed air.  “My name is Pamela, by the way.”  He chuckled.  “Has anyone told you, you look like Chad Michael Murray?”
“Hey Fassbinder want to race?!”  Dean bellowed.
After taking a lengthy cold shower and performing his morning ablutions, Dean entered the suite’s small dining area.  His eyes landed on a bare chested Castiel, who was sharing breakfast with Gabe in a diminutive oval table.  The bodyguard only donned a pair of flannel pajama pants and was barefoot.  Gabriel wore a Lady Gaga t-shirt, denim cutoffs and Nike flip flops.
The three of them managed to disentangle Gabe from Sam, who had assumed a Mr. Ed persona.  “You guys suck!”  Gabriel screamed as Dean and Max dragged him kicking to the picnic blanket.
Castiel felt rather uncomfortable as he sat in between his employer and new friend.  He wondered if he and Max would ever have sex.  Last night Cas felt terribly guilty after leaving his charge unattended while he and Fassbinder had a jolly good time. Dean’s safety was his number one priority so he returned to the table and did not leave his side for the remainder of the evening.  It had become a difficult juggling act, guarding Dean and getting to know Max.  The handsome actor had pleasantly surprised him by informing Castiel, he was staying at their same hotel.
“Does Dean know?” Samuel asked.  He was visibly nervous for his younger sibling’s well-being.
“Oh shut up, you know the model guys are hot.”  Gabe said as he wiggled his eyebrows.  “I need to use the covers as inspiration for an art project I plan on doing when my Samuel arrives tomorrow.”
“Come on, don’t you get it?”  When Dean and Cas shook their heads unanimously, he continued.  “If you look closer you block head, you will see I had the pastry chef add balls to the dick.”
Dean continued glaring at Castiel.  “Please don’t tell me you are still threatened by Fassbinder?  He and Cas are only friends.  Get over it!”
His eyes scanned the club until they landed by the bar.  The two guys stood waiting for drinks.  Fassbinder whispered something in Castiel’s ear causing him to blush from head to toe.  As the actor continued whispering to the bodyguard, Cas wrapped his arm around the man’s trim waist.  One of his hands slid down until it discreetly palmed the man’s
The three of them met up with Bela at Bulgari, one of Milan’s finest dining establishments.  The beanpole wore a cream colored dress that looked as if it was a bandage covering only her fake breasts and private area.  She had the audacity to kiss Dean on the lips.  Castiel saw red.  The host led them to a table for five and assisted Bela in sitting.
Castiel had witnessed the tender moment from the kitchen.  He joined his lover in the hallway.  Cas kissed his cheek.  “You are one of a kind, Dean Winchester.”
Later that night, after they fooled around for a while, Dean and Cas lied in bed.  The actor’s head rested on his bodyguard’s chest.  Castiel stroked Dean’s short hair.   The latter’s eyes were closed and he was falling asleep.  Before the Sandman claimed him, Dean whispered, “I love you, Castiel.”   Cas kissed the top of his head gently.
“As you can see his discharge papers from the navy are there, as well.”
He joined Cas in the center of the bed.  The bodyguard hungrily kissed him; laving his own jizz from Dean’s lips.  “Was I good?”
That evening the three Americans had an early dinner and went back to the hotel.  Fortunately, the paparazzi were no longer buzzing outside the hotel.  Pam must have worked her magic and conjured something up with the press and the agency, which represented Dean.
“So what do we do now?  Gabriel asked.
Gabriel made a gagging sound.  “Seriously, Dean; get over it.  Hey kiddo.  I’m Gabriel, your bro in law’s assistant and this tall and delicious Scottish drink is my boyfriend and Deano’s brother, Sam.”
“Sorry, dude but I have grown accustomed to having this bathroom all to myself.  Maybe next time use the one at the end of the hall.”
Castiel kissed him softly on the lips.  “Eew gross, too much PDA!”  Jimmy exclaimed.  He was rewarded with Dean tossing a pillow at his head and Castiel giving him the bird.
Adam’s frantic hold on Castiel lessened.  Cas head butted him.  Adam heard his twin’s footsteps approach the bedroom.  “This isn’t over,” he whispered to Castiel before escaping through a window.
Max had been right.  Cas had used him as a means of trying to rid himself of his feelings towards his charge.  Fassbinder was an available hottie, who wanted to have a good time.  So he desperately clung to the guy.  How pathetic he must have looked to those around him?  Castiel moaned into the goose feather pillow.
Castiel shook his head.  Pamela told Cas about the Belgian chocolates and hit &run incidents.   After he heard everything the former Secret Service agent said, “I am sorry but I don’t believe I am the right person for the job.  Maybe you can get a private security company to hand over one of their top guards.”
His eyes scanned the area and he instantly saw Dean’s boots next to the vehicle.  “Damn it, Dean!  I mean it; get your ass as far away from here as possible!”
For quite some time they viewed video footage from the hotel’s main entrance and nothing caught anyone’s attention.  “Wait a minute, there had to have been cameras in the hotel’s garage, am I right?  The SUV was stationed there until the morning, when we were scheduled to depart.  Can we see the video of the garage starting at six hours before the explosion?”
Castiel and Fassbinder laughed so hard tears formed in their eyes.  Dean was livid.   “What the fuck is going on?”
Dean joined his partner on the mattress and kissed his forehead.  “Happy Birthday, baby”
Sam shook his head and stared at Gabe.  “I swear I am innocent, love.  It wasn’t me.”
It took Dean about three minutes to vacate his chamber and join them in the living room area.  “We are in fucking Paris, France, you guys!  Let’s take in the attractions and scenery.  We don’t leave for LA until tomorrow afternoon.”
“I am not leaving you alone!”
“Are you alright, Sam?” Dean asked.  He knew the poor guy felt like he was hit by a ton of bricks.
“Not many people know the meaning of my name but yes, my mother teaches religious theology at the local college from where I am from.  She even named my teenage brother James after the dude from the Bible.”
The funeral service for Barbara Bush was being held at Arlington Cemetery.  A group of Scottish pipers played “Sleep Dearie Sleep” as her remains were laid to rest.  The entire Bush clan was being emotionally supported by various Heads of State.  George Sr. wept for his devoted late wife.
Both Dean and Gabe both asked at the same time, “You’re gay?”
Once they had secured a room with two full size beds in it; Gabriel asked Dean if they were safe strolling around Milan on their own.  “Let’s take a shower, eat something and then return to the hospital.  At least there, Cookoo for Cocoa Puffs will not try anything since it’s a public place.”
The bodyguard dropped the croissant on the china plate.  “Believe me I would have preferred to have been fucking the life out of Max last evening but I have a job to do.  So I spent it in my room with the door open on the lookout for our favorite killer.”
“That wimp is going to protect me? Ha, that’s a good one, Pammy!”
“What the fuck?!”  Dean bellowed.  He threw himself on the straw mat and held on to the bench.
“I have never been so scared in my life as I was earlier tonight.  I thought I was going to die without ever seeing you again.  Things got so ugly at the pub and it was my entire fault.”  Dean swallowed hard before he started to cry.  Cas soothed his back, and allowed Dean to get everything out of his system.
Castiel made note to keep an eye on this so called Sam.  The man was a stranger and would be around Dean.  Gabriel explained everything to Cas so he would not be flabbergasted once they arrived at the premiere.  As the bodyguard stepped out of the black limousine, Castiel thanked Gabe for the warning.  The incessant flashing of cameras and the hounding reporters harassing Dean was overwhelming.  He got a grip and became Dean’s shadow for the remainder of the premiere.
“It’s not that…Cas still hasn’t told me the three words.  I don’t know what the fuck he is waiting for!”
Due to the late hour, there was a skeleton staff in the hospital.  So Adam’s escape was extremely easy.  He found Jerry’s car keys inside his jacket’s pocket.  It took him a couple of minutes to find the pick-up truck.  He made sure good old Jerry had cash in his wallet.  Adam found about two hundred dollars’ worth in money.  This would cover gas.
“Likewise, Trixie” Cas headed to the dining table and started clearing it.  Dean approached him.  “You weren’t planning on eating some of the pie, where you?”
Sam suggested a game of darts.  Dean and Gabriel declined and headed back to their booth.  The waitress had already placed a pitcher of Fat Tire, when they returned.  Gabriel served the two of them.  After chugging down the entire content of his mug, Dean wiped his mouth with the table cloth.  “Classy, Deano”
Castiel grabbed his left wrist to prevent him from leaving.  “Listen carefully, you stupid man.  Max wants to treat all of us to dinner and a couple of games of darts.  He wants to personally congratulate us on our marriage.”
When the pilot stated the plane was about to land at Narita International Airport, the three Americans breathed sighs of relief.  The trio observed radiation monitoring sessions, where held throughout the airport due to the massive earthquake the country had recently survived.  They would most likely go through monitoring before boarding their flight back home.
Her phone had been buzzing off the hook with calls from the CEO of the agency she worked for.  No doubt he was livid at hearing the news of one of their most sought after male clients having married a man.  Pamela was so confused.  When the hell did the two dumb asses get hitched?  Dean knew better than to do something that could turn out being detrimental to his career.  She tried calling him once more but the idiot must have turned the phone off.
“This is it, you guys, Casa Novak.  You are going to love my mom and baby brother.”
Fassbinder remained quiet and stared at Castiel.  “What, you need to ask your boyfriend for permission?”  Max glared at the cocky American.
“I am the one, who needs to apologize for overstepping my boundaries.  Take care, Cassie.”  She got in the car and drove away.
“Are you in love with Fassbinder like you previously said?”
Castiel’s dark brows rose as he turned to look at Sam.  “Castiel, I know we do not know each other well but please help me.  All the answers will be provided by my Uncle Crowley, who lives in Glasgow, Scotland.”
Shania brought the devastated man a cup of steaming coffee and napkins for his nose.  Max patted his shoulder from across the table.  “Drink the coffee, it will help.”  The waitress remained standing adjacent to the booth.  “Can you please bring us the check, sweetheart?”  Shania smiled.
“Maybe we should call it a day, Winchester?”
The kid smiled revealing a couple of missing front teeth.  The two of them started flying the kite once the breeze picked up a bit.  Castiel grinned as he witnessed how caring Dean was always around little ones.  He went back to the blanket where Max was dozing off.  Cas sat adjacent to him and placed the slumbering actor’s head on his lap.  He played with his short brown locks.
Castiel helped Dean removed his dead brother’s corpse from him.  A large patch of dark blood had already formed around his body.  Cas embraced Dean and kissed his forehead.  “The nightmare is definitely over, baby.” The actor’s body shook.  The bodyguard consoled him.
Samuel nodded.  “Adam served in the Royal Navy and is an explosives expert.”
Adam dragged the unconscious short man to the living room, where he tossed him like a sack of potatoes on the couch.  He snorted.  Samuel it is bad enough you are a faggot but choosing this funny looking character as your partner…you could have found someone better looking.  Adam’s adrenaline was at a full rush.  He composed himself as he silently walked down the hall, which led to the bedrooms.  The psychotic Scotsman first opened the door of the chamber Castiel used, when he first started working as Dean’s bodyguard.  He was not immensely disappointed to discover his little brother nor his lover slept there.
He was impressed upon parking the Impala in the two story brick house’s huge driveway.  The front door was opened wide by Gabriel and Rachel.  Dean hugged his mother in law, who kissed his stubbled cheek.  “Welcome home, son.”
Gabriel had witnessed the whole exchange and smirked.  He listened to Christina Aguilera’s greatest hits on his IPod.  Castiel on the other hand, read a book on meditation.  He needed to be extremely focused during the short trip to Japan.   Dean had to go urinate twice during the flight so Castiel stood sentry outside the bathroom.  A couple of passengers noticed this but did not say anything.
As soon as the two lovers saw themselves arguing with Bela on the laptop’s screen; their eyes almost popped out of their sockets.  Castiel turned to face Dean.  “I am so sorry.  This is my entire fault.  If your career is ruined due to this I will never be able to forgive myself.”   The bodyguard seemed on the verge of tears.
Samuel had followed his brother to a nearby park.  He caught his breath as he stood next to an oak tree.  All of a sudden, a military knife landed about two inches from him on the tree.  Sam was alert once again.  Adam must be closer than he thought.
Castiel set the almost empty bowl aside.  His appetite swiftly evaporated.  “Listen Gabe, I am here to do my job.  That means I have to keep Dean safe at all times and apprehend the maniac, who is trying to kill him.  I can’t afford for any feelings to develop between the two of us.  There can’t be any distractions.”
Dean frowned as soon as he heard Gabe’s reply.  When Gabriel had basically pronounced them married, Dean was elated.  Of course he was not going to illustrate his emotions externally.  Especially, when Cas was acting like a crazed chicken that could not lay an egg.  Would it be so terrible to be married to him?
The actor threw the book on the floor and placed his weary head on the side of the hospital bed. His hand remained holding Castiel’s.  He cried his heart out.  All of a sudden, Cas’ hand held on to his.  Dean swiftly stood.  He smiled upon seeing Castiel’s clear blue eyes gazing into his emerald ones.
Everyone vacated Castiel’s bedroom.  Dean held Cas’ right hand and led him to the bathroom.  He kissed his neck as the two of them undressed.  They took a speedy warm shower.  Dean gave his lover a special birthday blow job.  Castiel had to admit the man was becoming a pro at performing oral.
“Thank you, now time for desert.”  Gabriel presented to them sweets, which they had to eat from a special form of paper called kaishi.  As per usual Dean gobbled up the tasty treat in no time.
“So a broken humerus means the boss man is going to be extremely grouchy and with no sense of humor, when he wakes up,” Gabe asked.
A visibly tired Dean drove his beloved Impala adjacent to Yellowstone National Park, which was located near Park County, Wyoming.  The sixty acres ranch Castiel had inherited was in the county, whose population was estimated around 28,205.  He rolled down the window and inhaled the fresh air provided by a gentle breeze. The actor covered his emerald eyes against the bright sunrays with black Ray Bans.  The sky was light blue reminding him of his husband’s vibrant cerulean eyes.
“Babe, why are you pissed?”
The 5’7 tawny haired man fell on his knees.  When Dean and Castiel approached him, they automatically felt his body shivering as his entire form was racked with violent sobs.  “I don’t understand.  He is such a big teddy bear of a man.  I can’t believe he is a cold blooded killer.”
A shivering Dean gulped.  “What about you?”
For the first time that evening Dean remained rooted on the floor and did not utter a syllable.  Twin red spots adorned each of his chiseled cheeks.  Damn had he been wrong about the geeky, scrawny bodyguard!  The ugly as hell trench coat covered a flat well toned stomach and healthy medium built form.  Castiel had muscles in all the right places.   To top it all off, the dude was hung as a prized stallion!  Shit!  When the fuck did Dean Winchester start noticing if dudes were well hung?  He must still be drunk; that’s all.
Castiel kissed him hard on the lips.  “Because you have tell Sam he is your brother.”  He was the first to get out of bed.  Cas playfully slapped one of Dean’s hard butt cheeks.  The actor leapt out of bed and scurried after him.
Two hours later, the satiated couple finally moved to the bedroom.  If someone would have told Dean Winchester three months ago that he would be spooning in bed with a man he was in love with; he would have punched them in the face.  He smirked as he trailed soft kisses down Cas’ back.  The actor even kissed the bandaged area and the barely visible scar from the Paris fire.  Tears started forming in his forest green eyes.  Castiel, who he believed to be asleep felt them fall on his skin.  He rapidly turned to face Dean.
The director ordered champagne for everyone.  “OK kiddies, who is going to be the first victim?”  His wife surprised him by volunteering.  She headed to the stage area and began scanning the playlist.
Dean had never seen Castiel this happy.  All off a sudden, a car horn was heard.  Dean was the one, who turned red now.  “That must be your gift from me now, babe.”
Samuel did not hesitate and ran outside the house in pursuit of his maniacal twin.  Castiel ran to Dean’s room.  He shook him gently as he felt his pulse.  Tears ran down his face, when he realized his lover lived.  “Baby, open your eyes.  I need to know you are ok.”  He removed the gag from his mouth.
Max handed him the dart and stood behind him.  Although there was a bit of a distance between both of their bodies; it looked like the opposite from where Dean was.  He saw red, when he watched Fassbinder stand body to body behind Castiel.  Max placed his hand over Cas’ right one before he threw it.  This time it landed approximately an inch and a half from the center of the board.
“Hey, no problem, old man and Iloveyou”   The teen scurried out of the dining room while mumbling the last words.
“Yes!  Mom made your favorite breakfast: French toast, eggs benedict and fruit salad,” Jimmy said as he headed out the door.
“Not at all, I am glad you met someone.  Why don’t you prepare Cas for the zoo the premiere experience will be?”
The following morning at eleven, Dean had a photo shoot and interview for a Japanese entertainment magazine.  His wardrobe was casual and had been provided by an up and coming Japanese designer.  Dean felt comfortable throughout the entire process since the reporter was very down to earth, as well as the other staff involved with the shoot.
Castiel had remained standing at the door.  He had been stunned speechless by Dean Winchester.  Deep inside he knew he will cave in to his feelings and desire for his so called husband any day now.  He just prayed to God he wouldn’t imperil his life.
“Can I see him?”
“Thanks dude.”
“I am waiting, boss man.”  Gabe impatiently tapped his barefoot on a dry section of the kitchen.
Well that's all folks!  Thanks for reading, commenting, kudos and bookmarking the fic.  Until next time!  :)
The boys observed Gabriel ritually clean a tea bowl, whisk and tea scoop.  He went on to place the items precisely in a particular order on the small bench.   As the ceremony hostess, Gabriel placed a measured amount of green tea powder in the ceramic bowl.  Then he poured hot water, as well to whisk the tea.
“Cas?”
“You never will.” The bodyguard instructed Gabe to tend to Dean’s injuries.
Gabe whispered in his ear, “I am not the one you should apologize to.”
Castiel did not let go of Dean’s hand, as the actor led him to where he had been sitting.  He helped Cas get the shirt off and told the EMTs, who were fluent in English to tend to Castiel’s back.  As the bodyguard was given oxygen with the mask, one of the EMTs lathered antibiotic ointment on the burn he received on his mid back.  Dean traced soothing circles across Castiel’s hand.  “Everything is going to be fine, dude.”’
He licked Castiel’s nipples.  The bodyguard’s limbs felt like gelatin.  He landed languidly over Dean’s body.  He traced circles over Dean’s chest.  “I think we should shower before dinner.”
This was always Dean’s favorite part when he attended premieres and events; the warmth that his fans always gave him.
Dean did not allow his hubby to continue his harping.  His lips swiftly covered the other man’s mouth in a hard kiss.  Castiel’s clear blue eyes widened as he reciprocated the kiss.  Dean’s tongue traced Castiel’s full lower lip.  He could feel his bodyguard was trying to stop himself from participating in the heated smooch.
Castiel replied, “I believe we both saved each other.”
“I promise, dude.”  Castiel remained standing outside the bathroom.  Dean would not know he was out there anyways.
As the two of them consumed the fresh salad which was comprised of honeydew melon, kiwi, strawberries and golden apples, Gabriel finally spoke.  “Dean told me the reason for his Paris Hilton tantrum.  I know you lied to him.”
The three Americans arrived at the police station at ten thirty in the morning.  The detective in charge of the case motioned for the three of them to enter his office.  When he closed the door, Gabriel inquired about Sam.  “He remains in the holding cell.  The Scottish Royal Navy has been very helpful in assisting us with the case.”
“I am still confused.”
Gabriel and Samuel joined him.  “How are you feeling, Deano?”  Gabe asked.
Crowley Maclachlan rose to his height of 5’8, when the detective entered the interrogation room.  The Scotsman wore a dark tailored suit and stubble covered his face, which at the moment sported a scowl.  “I am here to get my nephew out of this mess but need to return to Edinburgh immediately.  My tailoring business can’t run without me.  Those lazy buggers of my employees most likely closed the shop and are at the local pub as we speak.  Time is wasting, detective and I am losing money.  So let’s get the show on the road.”
“Good night, Gabe,” Dean stated as he went to assist his lover in packing their clothes.
Dean released his hold on him.  He kissed him chastely.  “Even though our marriage is not legal; I consider it to be a fact.  I will not be with anyone until you are ready to accept what is going on between us.  It’s up to you, how you want to handle things.”
“Sweetheart, he is monitoring Morning Star’s status.  She still is not due until this evening.”  She led him to the spacious sunflower themed kitchen.  Dean liked the warm feeling provided by the sunlight that illuminated the room courtesy of four large windows.
“Castiel Novak this is…”
Gabriel started sketching his lover.  Once he was happy with the finished product, he would paint it.  After two hours, Gabe could no longer control himself and threw himself on the gigantic Scotsman.  Sam was going to remove the kilt but Gabriel told him to keep it.  “I’ve always had a thing for hot Scottish dudes in kilts since I watched Braveheart.”   Sam smirked as he rolled up the kilt and removed Gabe’s denim cut offs.
Dean threw one of the pillows at Gabe’s head.  The assistant giggled right before he started snoring.   The actor frustratingly covered his head with a pillow.
“He can be so stupid and stubborn.  In how many different ways have I not shown I adore him and would die for him?”
The two minutes it took him to exit the suite felt like an eternity in Hell.  When he finally made his way out, two firefighters were already heading towards the suite.  An EMT was assisting Dean into the elevator.  The door was about to close, when Dean’s red rimmed emerald eyes clashed with his.  “Hold the door!”  He bellowed to the EMT.
Her doe eyes became dewy.  “I’m sorry, Anna.  He is the love of my life.  I will always consider you one of my greatest friends.  Please let’s not lose our friendship.”
Dean kissed Castiel’s hand.  “You want to leave this place then I suggest you rest and stop freaking out.   If you follow the doctor’s instructions; he will discharge you within four days.”
Gabriel retrieved two wrapped Blow Pops from his cargo pants pockets.  “Practice with these; although something tells me they are nowhere near Cas’ size.”  He wiggled his brows.
Gabriel clapped his hands and wiggled his eyebrows.  “Just in time, Deano”
“Don’t listen to him, Dean.  He is playing psychological games with you.” Castiel said as he tried to escape the rope which bound his hands.
“This is Castiel Novak.  Starting tonight he will be your twenty four hour bodyguard.”
“You never consult anything with me so why should I be surprised.”
“Dude, it’s the least I can do for you.  You are willing to die for me.”
“Really?”
“Sure, let me grab a jacket.”
Castiel flew from his chair and embraced her for quite a while.  She pecked him lightly on the lips.  Dean assumed this was Anna right off the bat.  Cas turned to everyone in the room and introduced her as Anna Milton, his high school sweetheart.
“Great!  We will go on a double date.  Dean and Bela and you and me, Cas.  Well at least until Sam arrives.  He has a minor part in the latest Bond movie, which happens to be filming here.”
The actor fell on the mattress bringing Cas down with him.  “Are you ok?  I hardly touched your knee,” a worried Castiel mumbled.
Cas’ mouth attacked Max’s.  The two of them kissed passionately as they jerked each other off.  Cas kissed the actor’s jaw and bit it hard.  Fassbinder was the first one to be brought to orgasm.  The bodyguard felt guilty as hell because he thought of Dean during the entire time he was in the shower with Max. The water washed away their jizz from each others’ bodies. They took turns lathering each other with gel again.  They were already turning into prunes.  A couple of minutes later, they exited the shower stall and entered Max’s bedroom.  The actor gave Castiel a pair of sweat pants and an old t-shirt to wear.
“Babe, is everything alright?  You were a long time on the phone.”  Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel’s torso.  The bodyguard was adamant in not ruining his lover’s Thanksgiving.
The actor rolled his eyes.  “Jeez, thanks for the affirmation.”
“How does two thousand a week sound?”
Dean gazed at him one last time before crawling out of the bedroom.  Castiel felt a lancing pain go across the middle of his back.  He already felt the flames licking at his exposed skin.  He got on the floor and crawled his way through the smoke filled room.  His throat felt extremely dry and his eyes burned like crazy.
“Go on, Deano; don’t leave us in the dark.”
Dean licked his lips.  “Man, you saved my life again.  Thank you.  I mean it.”
Dean widely opened the door and in a flash grabbed Cas and carried him inside the suite.  The guard laughed as he closed the door.  “Never say I did not keep up with traditions on our honeymoon night.”
Castiel placed his hand on the assistant’s shoulder.  “We will see what comes out of the interrogation session.”
“Where do we change?”  Dean asked feeling uncomfortable.  She pointed to double doors to the right.  Castiel went in first and noticed four cubicles for private changing.  He motioned for Dean to enter, as well.
The couple checked on Pam, who finally regained consciousness.  She cried after Dean and Castiel gave her their words that they had barely received any bruises.  Dean assisted his friend in standing up.  All of a sudden, they heard sirens.  The trio hobbled outside the shack and onto the docks.  Castiel was pleasantly surprised to see Robert Singer lead the brigade.  “Are you two ok? Winchester’s assistant called me frantically from your cell phone several hours ago.  Your family was extremely helpful in letting us know places where the psychopath could have taken you.”
As the paramedics wheeled Dean into the emergency room, Gabriel was instructed to remain in the waiting area.  He must have worn down a section of the floor tiles due to his constant frantic pacing.  A frazzled Pam entered the waiting room and held Gabriel.  “What the fuck happened, kiddo?”  Gabe reluctantly relived the traumatic minutes and told her everything he saw.
Finally, Gabriel parked the car inside the garage.  He was going to assist Dean in exiting the vehicle but the blond man swatted his hand away.  “I am pretty sober now, dude.  Go on to bed.  Good night and I am sorry for being a big gonad this evening.”
Cas threw a pillow at him.  Dean joined him on the bed.  They snuggled for a while.  “You know babe, this is going to be the first family Thanksgiving I am going to have.”
“I am so Ken cos I refuse to be Barbie,” Dean said in between chuckles.
“I don’t need a fucking baby sitter!”
Fassbinder waited until Castiel closed the suite’s door and started taking off his sodden clothes, shoes and socks.  Cas did the same.  The two drenched men strolled to the bathroom and slid off their wet boxer briefs.  Max was the first to enter the marble tiled shower stall.  He set the water to come out warm.  He offered his hand to Castiel.  The bodyguard entered and closed the sliding glass door.
Twenty minutes later the five men stood outside their suites’ hallway.  “We all are in desperate need of a warm shower and change of clothes.  What are we going to do with the bathroom situation?”  Gabe asked.
Dean had no idea the manmade lake would be pretty damn deep!  How embarrassing!  Cas must think he is such a loser!  All of a sudden, his right leg got tangled with some weed like plant.  He tried not to panic.  Two minutes felt like an hour for the desperate man as he held his breath.  He saw a hand reaching out to him before losing consciousness.
“Until Shania’s shift ends at two am.  We already made plans.”
“We wait for Crowley to deliver the documents and proof needed to exonerate Sam.  The military information will be obtained much quicker.”  Castiel informed the two men as he finally sipped the delicious cappuccino.
Eight hours later, the trio was at Pam’s house.  She was away on a business trip and told them to stay there until the movie’s Japanese premiere the following week.  Dean had to be in attendance.  Dean had finished unpacking and was famished.  He headed to the kitchen.  The actor froze on his tracks when he saw Castiel standing by the kitchen’s island.  He did not know how to approach his bodyguard.  After the hot make out session, the two of them had not said a peep.
Castiel rolled his eyes.  “I can’t believe I am doing this. OK I’ll show you some basics.  Then we will call it a day.”
The detective entered his office and motioned for Dean and Castiel to accompany him.  “What happened?”  Dean asked.
Pam had chosen this particular hotel for Dean because of the warmth and comfort feelings its traditional, classic French style provided its guests.  Every time she visited Paris, she would stay there.
Crowley smirked and walked over to his tall nephew.  He patted his cheek playfully.  “You know I would do anything for you, Sammy boy.  You have always been like the son I never had.”
“Yes, he has been transferred to ICU.”
Dean crossed his well toned arms across his chest.  He licked his lips before speaking.  “Simple, you want to return to Mr. Sinister and continue where the two of you left off.  I was the cock block, who prevented you guys from having some afternoon delight when the fire debacle happened.”
He ran into Dean’s room, which miraculously was the only part of the suite that wasn’t a complete inferno.  Castiel’s vision was blurry as he ran to the bed.  Dean was asleep.  He shook the slumbering man’s shoulders.  “Dean, wake up!  The suite is on fire!”  The flames had already entered the room.
Castiel knelt next to Sam.  Once he made sure the Sasquatch was well; he called 911.
Dean surprised his friend/assistant by embracing him heartily.  He kissed the shorter man’s cheek.  “I know you meant well and I am not mad.  Thanks.”
“I am going to order us an apple cobbler.  I’ll be right back.”  Cas observed Max put in the order with Shania, who placed her hand on the actor’s chest.  At lease someone was going to get lucky tonight, Cas thought.
Castiel smirked as he lathered strawberry preserve on a freshly baked croissant.  “What are you smirking at, Johnny Castle?  Where the fuck did you leave Baby?  After your Dirty Dancing re-enactment last night; I thought the two of you would be at it like bunnies.”
No one had given much thought to the Belgian chocolate since they claimed Crowley expired due to the large amount of theobromine found in the dark chocolate.   If ingested in large quantities by a small dog it was supposed to be dangerous to the animal’s health.
A tear fell down Castiel’s cheek.  He wanted so badly for Dean to be here at his side.  It was during moments like this that he missed his husband terribly.  He cleared his throat and asked Jo what to do next.  “Leave Impala alone; she will stand on her own in ten minutes.  I am going to check on mom.”  Sam went to fetch a blanket to wipe the blood from Impala once she was on her feet.
Dean bade good bye to his former co-workers and returned to the hotel with his bodyguard.  As promised by the chief of security a burly guard stood sentry outside their suite.  The two Americans bowed at the man and he did the same.  Once they were inside, Dean broke the tense atmosphere.  Since his temper tantrum, he and Cas had kept things professional.   They would keep their conversations at a minimum.
“We have it all on video, figlio di puttana.”
“Deano, I don’t think it’s the best idea to move him at the moment.”
Fassbinder inhaled deeply and his eyes widened.  “Shit!  I do now!”  Cas was already putting on a pair of sweats, which he had abandoned on the floor.  As he ran toward Dean’s suite he instructed Max to call 112 for help.
(See the end of the chapter for
In less than five minutes two patrol cars came.  Castiel and Sam gave their accounts of what transpired that night to two police officers.  They handcuffed Adam and read him his Miranda Rights.  The oldest of the officers told Sam and Cas they needed to go to the police station so a report could be filled out.  The two men agreed under the condition they were allowed to return home to see if Dean and Gabriel were alright.
Castiel stopped blowing at the scolding coffee.  “I’ve been through a lot of stuff in my life, which has somewhat made it difficult for me to say those simple three words to anyone.”
“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Winchester.”
Castiel was trying to hold his laughter inside.  “Yeah whatever dude…and one more thing…I better be the dad.”  Cas could no longer contain himself and started cracking up.  Dean mumbled something the other two men could not decipher and gave his back to Gabriel.
“Look I am not scared, as long as you are by my side.”
Gabe giggles nervously.  “You are quite welcome.  Aren’t you going to ask what this ceremony was about?”
Castiel chuckled huskily and damn if the sound did not make his groin twitch.  “I don’t believe in labels. I just don’t discriminate between the sexes.”
The short man grinned at them and gestured for the old man to leave the room.  After the elderly musician exited the tea room, Dean and Castiel thanked Gabriel for the nice gesture.  They stood up.
Castiel sat at the booth running a frantic hand through his disheveled hair.  “I shouldn’t have hit him.  It’s just I have never seen him being such a giant ass while under the influence of alcohol.  The night I met him, he was acting like a douche but nothing like tonight.”
Dean gave him the stink eye.  He gave Cas the keys and opened the front passenger door.  Castiel eagerly got in on the other side and revved up the engine.  He smiled as they sped down the street.  Cas drove the Mustang to a secluded wooded area, which was the town’s make out hangout for the local teens.  The place was deserted.  Dean knew why Castiel drove them there but remained silent.  In no time, Cas unzipped and lowered Dean’s jeans, along with his underwear.  He showed Dean his appreciation by giving him the best blow job of their relationship.  “Imagine what you will do to me if I ever get you a house.”
“Cool”
He did not bother with condoms because during Castiel’s recent stay at the hospital, the two of them had been tested for HIV and STDS.  The results came back negative for the two of them.  Since they decided to be in a monogamous relationship with each other; they had no need for prophylactics.
July 1, 2011
“Dean, he will make it.  You know him better than me.  When has he ever given up on anything?  He is as stubborn as they come.”
The actor squirmed on the stool.  Gabriel’s mouth hung open. He dramatically placed a hand over his head.  “For Christ’s sake!  You have never given your man a blow job?  No wonder he hasn’t said he loves you!”  He chuckled.
Pamela turned around dying to see the stranger’s face.  She really liked what she saw.  “I am no longer alone.  Now am I?”   Pam swiftly said good night to her gal pals and vacated the club with the stranger.
Castiel was already on his way out of the bedroom.  “There is no fucking way I am letting you leave this room until we settle a few things!”  Dean spun his bodyguard around to face him.  His hands held on tightly to Cas’ upper arms.
Gabriel showed Cas where the linen closet was and which bathroom he could use.  Afterwards, he left the bodyguard to finish settling in.  Castiel liked the assistant.  His shoulders were tense and he smelled of cigarettes and sake.  Cas removed his clothing and placed it in a neat pile by his full size bed.  He remained in his boxer briefs and fetched a navy towel from the linen closet.  The bathroom was situated adjacent to Dean’s room.  He made sure the light was off but knocked to be safe.  When he heard no response, Cas entered the bathroom.  He took a much needed warm shower; reveling as the water soothed his tense shoulders and upper back.  Once he was satisfied Castiel stepped out of the shower stall.
“It’s nice to meet all of you.  Let me help you with your bags.”
“Nice meeting you, Anna.  Cas told me you guys were each other’s first love.”
“Only you can get away with saying something so cheesy, Sammy.”
Dean hit the back of his assistant’s head.  “Can you keep your fucking voice down?  You know I am new at this.  I have never been with a man before Castiel and I’m still getting used to things.”
Dean’s soft snoring was the only sound heard in the bedroom.  Adam stared at his youngest sibling.  He fisted his hands at his side.  Oh how he loathed the little bastard.  His parents did not toss him aside like a dirty nappy, when he was born.  He went on to live a great life and found someone, even though it was a man; while he and Samuel’s adoptive father was abusive to them and their mother died of cancer, when they were adolescents.  Crowley always doted on Samuel.  He had always felt like he did not belong anywhere and no one gave a shit about him.  Dean Winchester on the other hand was living the life of a prince.
Castiel motioned to the shack.  “Maclachlan is finally dead.  His corpse is bound inside the shack.”
Dean swallowed loudly.  “Dude, I told you I don’t want to talk about that anymore.  I am not gay!”
Dean kissed and nibbled both of Castiel’s thighs.  The other man was already arching his hips upwards.  Dean licked his lips in anticipation.  Then tentatively laved the pre-cum off Cas’ erection.  It actually did not taste as gross as he thought it would. It was somewhat salty.  He licked the head cautiously but the moans being emitted by Cas got his motor running.
“I like your kimono, Gabe.  The maroon and golden design is …pretty,” Castiel said.
“No problem, just keep taking care of my Deano.”
“I’m fine, thanks, Gabe.”
“Nothing, I’m just tired of watching you become a bitch in heat whenever Fasswanker is around!”
“The green eyed monster got the best of him.”
“First let me tell you, he is the luckiest bastard I have ever treated.  The results of the MRI showed no internal bleeding and the x-ray only illustrated a broken humerus, sprained ankle and two cracked ribs.”
“Shut the fuck up, baby brother!  I need you to do something for me before I kill you and your lover.”  Adam spat on the floor a couple of inches from where Castiel sat.
Castiel observed outside one of the living room windows to see if he saw any suspicious characters in the area.
“He kept many of my mother’s personal possessions after she passed away.”
Their conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Dean and Trixie.  Gabe frowned as he turned to face the stove.  Castiel finished setting the table.  He immediately noticed Dean sported two hickeys on the left side of his neck.  Trixie’s dyed blonde locks resembled a rat’s nest.  What kind of person named their kid Trixie in this day in age?  The only Trixie he ever heard of was Speed Racer’s girlfriend.
He tossed it to Dean.  The actor opened it and his eyes widened in pleasant surprise.  He gulped loudly.  Cas knelt in front of him once more.  “Since we never exchanged bands during our impromptu wedding ceremony I planned on giving you this as a Christmas gift.”
Cas opened one blue eye.  “Dean, I love you with all of my being but please don’t quit your day job.”  His husband chuckled.  “Love ya, babe”
tonight.
“Your Uncle Raphael, and he has been doing a pretty decent job.  With the ranch’s lucrative profits he has enough money to pay for taxes, the animals’ veterinary expenses and the staff.”
Castiel felt a lot of pent up emotion being emitted from Dean.  He loathed putting the guy through this.  It must have been extremely difficult for the actor to finally admit he was attracted to men and worse that he might feel something towards the first man he was sexually attracted to.  But in the current predicament Cas found himself in, he could not afford to have his charge fall in love with him.
“That’s great, my angel.  I haven’t seen you in so long.  You know I always worry about your safety.”
The main house also consisted of three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a remodeled kitchen, and rec room, where Dean would unwind playing pool, poker and/or pin ball.  Behind the house stood an attached separate, all inclusive and charming guest suite with one bedroom, bathroom, kitchen and laundry room.  Finally, after being shown the home’s four car garage, Pamela brought Castiel to a medium sized terrace, which held twenty people at a time.
“I like the way you think.”
The hairs on the nape of his neck rose.  The house was eerily quiet and when he went to turn on the kitchen lights, the room remained dark.  What the fuck?  He strolled over to open the refrigerator so it could somewhat illuminate the kitchen.  Gabriel was completely unaware of the giant dark form standing adjacent to the refrigerator.  Adam’s black outfit blended in perfectly with the darkness.  He had made sure to close all the curtains.
Castiel’s clear blue eyes widened.  He bit a fingernail as he thought of a way to fix this mess.  Dean eyed him suspiciously.  “I bet I know the reason why you want to leave ASAP.”
Gabe removed the Blow Pop from his mouth and cracked up; falling on the floor in the process.  “OK, let’s get this straight.  This is not Muppet Babies and I certainly am not Baby Kermit.  So please have the courtesy of not bull shitting me!”
“That’s what I am here for.”  All of a sudden, there was a knock on the door.   Dean rose rapidly from the dining room table.   “That’s for me.”  He smirked.
Samuel smiled at the bodyguard revealing dimples in the process.  He patted one of Cas’s covered feet.  “We are glad you are alright, mate.”
Dean smirked.  He knew damn well what was bugging Castiel but he wanted to hear him say it.  “I guess so cos I have no idea what you are talking about.”
“Still, allow me, please; just humor me this time.”
“It was really great meeting all of you.”
Castiel rose and headed to the sink, where he rinsed the bowl and spoon before placing them in the dishwasher.  “Maybe this is a sign he should not reveal to anyone yet of his sexual preference.  Anyways I don’t think Dean is the type of guy, who cares about labels.”
The former US President’s assistant coughed discreetly as she sat behind the podium erected in the lawn of the Richard Nixon Library & Museum.  She whispered, “Today is Friday, Mr. President.”
Gabe opened one amber eye.  “I don’t want to get up…too comfortable.”  The short man had the audacity to hold on tighter to Castiel’s waist.  The dark haired man finally woke up.  Foreign arms were wrapped around his torso.  He swiftly removed them.  Dean was already in the process of yanking his lazy assistant from the bed.
“You have to see the twins’ birth certificates.”   The detective handed Adam’s to Castiel and Sam’s to Dean.
Cas kissed his forehead.  “Dean, there are certain things you need to know before you meet my family.”
“Actually, it’s something I did not have to buy.  The present is from your father.”  Her cerulean eyes became watery.
“Why are you crying?”  He gently wiped a tear from Dean’s beautiful face.
His boss headed to his bathroom and quickly removed his sweaty clothes and rocketed inside the shower stall.  The water was freezing as it pounded his body.  “I am not gay!”  He continued screaming in his mind.  If it weren’t because his life was in fucking peril; he would fire Cas’ rock hard ass right now!  Fuck!   He was so getting some sweet poon tang
One of the Italian officers informed them he would pay a quick visit to Judge Palermo in order to obtain an arrest warrant for Samuel Maclachlan.  The brawny officer of the law took with him the cd, which showcased all the evidence they needed for the warrant to be signed by the judge.
“Well you can kiss your little fantasies good bye because you are not breaking your contract.  So call Fassbinder and notify him there has been a change in plans.”  Dean finally took the envelope and ripped it in two.   He smashed against the wall a glass pitcher, which held orange juice.  This caused the liquid to slide from the industrial GE refrigerator onto the floor.
His assistant giggled and led them to a small bench, where he gestured for them to sit on straw woven mats on the floor.  Castiel couldn’t help himself and discreetly chuckled.  Dean rapidly joined him.  Gabriel was visibly pissed.  “Please do not ruin the mood.”
Dean banged his closed fist against the small oval table.  “He had the balls of steel to tell me he wants to reunite with Max Fucking Fassbinder and play house with him.”
Gabe and Castiel both gazed at Dean simultaneously as if waiting for his reply.  The autumn day’s weather was surprisingly warm so it was perfect for sightseeing.   Dean knew he was going to regret it but he agreed with Gabriel’s suggestion.
The lanky teen stopped the vehicle and hopped off.  “Dean, it’s great to see you!  Cas is going to be happy.  He has been morose without you.”
Unknown to them, Dean had been spying on the duo ever since they vacated the house through one of the living room windows.  He was seething as soon as he saw the little bitch get closer to Cas.
Castiel rubbed the back of his neck.  “I don’t know if that is a good idea…I need to be protecting Dean and should not have any distractions.”
A livid Castiel slammed the door as he entered the house’s living room.  “Whoa! Cool down, cowboy” Gabriel said.
Castiel savored the last spoonful of clam chowder. Max removed the tray from the king size bed and swiftly returned to it.  He cupped Cas’ jaw and kissed him hard. Castiel’s hands wandered down to Fassbinder’s denim clad ass.  He froze. Max inched away. “What’s going on?”
“Merci”
The waitress pouted and slipped him her number inside his jeans’ pocket.  “Maybe you will feel better tomorrow night.”  She kissed his cheek.
Castiel drank the remainder of his water.  “We’ve been here alone for over two hours and you have not tried anything.”
The two men drove in silence towards the nearest park.  Dean parked the Impala underneath a tree in an isolated section. Castiel was the first one to exit the vehicle to scan the perimeter.  No one was around at the moment.  The bodyguard started stretching.  Dean’s traitorous eyes landed on the dark haired man’s hard firm ass.  Shit, not again!   He really needs to get rid of Castiel.
Pamela retrieves something from her Coach purse.  “I happen to have your plane ticket for LA.  The flight leaves DC tomorrow morning at ten.”
Gabriel withdrew himself from Dean.  He sniffled.  Castiel rapidly handed him a handkerchief and glass of water.  “I want to be here, when he is brought in.”
“I might have good news.”
“You don’t look so bad yourself.  Thanks by the way; I really like the stuff you chose for me.”  Castiel surprised Gabriel by hugging him.
All of a sudden, someone knocked on the door.  Castiel prayed it wasn’t Jehovah’s Witnesses.  They always managed to sneak in through the building’s front gate.  “Who is it?”
Impala eventually got up on her sternum and a couple of minutes later rose on four wobbly hooves.  Morning Star experienced one more contraction as she expelled her placenta.  Jo placed plenty of fresh hay next to her.  Morning Star lied down for a while before she started munching on the hay.
He opened the door and eyed Dean’s visitor from head to toe.  The woman was dressed like a hooker in a short red leather dress with matching stripper shoes.  Her hair was dyed honey blond and her grey eyes were made up with black eye liner and blue mascara.  She had to be at least a D cup.
A week prior to the beloved pet’s death, Dean had personally taken him to the veterinarian for his annual checkup.  Crowley’s vaccines were updated and the vet gave him a clean bill of health.  Dean had lost his parents when he was a young boy and had no other living relatives.  Crowley had been his family since the actor had gotten him as a pup.  Since then he had become his faithful companion.  Until this day, Dean missed the mischievous canine.
“They did not mention me, did they?”  Dean inquired.
“No, I wouldn’t have taken things so far.  I only make love.  If I am not in love with someone, I do not go all the way,” the bodyguard whispered.
“Hey, I know how you feel.  Never forget that I love you more than anything or anyone in this planet.”  Dean kissed him tenderly.
Gabe and Sam sat in the backseat enjoying the scenery.  The tree leaves were golden brown since it was late autumn.  Castiel was an excellent tour guide as he drove into Sycamore.  Dean had no idea small Norman Rockwell towns still existed in the 21st century.  He loved that Cas came from such a quaint and picturesque place.
Castiel kissed his nose.  “I am going to make sure it’s the best.”
Three hours later an orthopedic specialist appeared.  “Are you two here for Dean Winchester?”
Castiel woke up groggily from a drugged state due to the ominous sound of waves crashing against wood.  He wearily opened one of his cerulean eyes to discover foggy vision.  He licked his chapped lips and swallowed nervously.  His mouth tasted like led.  When he tried to sit, he instantly became dizzy.  As he took in his surroundings, Castiel soon realized he was being held prisoner in the abandoned dilapidated shack people used for fishing at the lake.  The bodyguard’s hands were completely numb due to the thick rope which bound them behind his back. They were seriously cutting off his circulation.

“Have a good one, Gabe.”
“Dean is a stubborn guy, who would die before asking for help.  I really worry about him.  He has no family and I look after him.  The only two people who genuinely care for him are Gabriel, his assistant and me.”
“I have an idea of something fun we can do in the shower to make up for Gabe’s successful cock block attempt last night.”  Dean winked at Castiel.  He started running into the bathroom.  “Last one in has to give the loser a blow job!”
“How many fucking times have I told you to stop comparing me to desserts and pastries?”
“Oh no…please tell me this isn’t going where I think it is?”  Castiel asked before drinking a cup of sake.
Gabe patted him on the back three times.  Once Dean was alright, Gabriel found the source of his boss’ bad temper.  “Oh shit, Cas has been Fassbindered!”
Last year as Dean’s agent, Pamela was in the yearly process of renewing her client’s contract with the show, Jerry Bruckheimer approached them with the script to Bang You Are Dead.  The movie was supposed to be this year’s hottest ticket at the box office.  Pam and Gabe told him that if he did not take the offer he was insane.
Dean nodded.  Gabriel flew out of his chair almost causing it to fall in the process.  He hugged Dean and kissed his cheek.  “Now, we truly are family!”
Castiel turned around to face him.  His eyes were filled with adoration towards his husband.  “Yeah, we do.”
Rachel smiled as she entwined an arm with one of Dean’s.  “As a matter of fact it is.  Why don’t I cut you a slice and you can wash it down with some homemade lemonade?”
“Mom, you didn’t have to.”
Dean must have felt his presence and woke up.  “Babe, is that you?”
The Italian detective perused the family album first and observed a plethora of pictures of the Maclachlan twins starting from their infancy to their early adolescence.  He moved on to the baptismal record, which illustrated the two infants were baptized on the same day.  When his eyes landed on the boys’ birth certificates something caught his attention ASAP.
Dean and Castiel rushed to the hotel in order to get ready for the premiere.  When Cas entered his chamber he rapidly noticed all the clothes and two pairs of shoes Gabriel had placed over his bed.  He headed to the bathroom to take a shower.  Dean was doing the same thing in his own bathroom.  Gabriel already was getting dressed.
“I would never do that to family and I would not try to kill my own flesh and blood!”  Dean glared at the cocky Scotsman.  “Now the number one question is, why the fuck does Adam have a major hard on in wanting to kill me?”
“Why can’t we stay in bed the remainder of the night?” Dean pouted.
The nurse continued.  “He was given a sedative and administered local anesthesia in order for the piece of shrapnel to be removed.  We were able to stop the bleeding.”  Her dark gaze landed on Dean.  “There is something else.”
“I hate this!  When you get this creep, I will personally help you castrate the fucker!”
Dean rained kisses all over Castiel’s neck and back.  “How do you feel today, babe?”  The blond asked referring to Cas’ wound.
He went on to demonstrate the strike against the bridge of the assailant’s nose.  He held out his hand and spread its fingers wide.  He pushed said hand forward and struck the center of Dean’s nose.  Castiel did not use real force.  Dean picked things up quicker on that technique and Cas went on to explain the last move.  “The final move will literally bring the attacker down to his or her knees.”  He arched his leg and brought one of his heels to the inner side of Dean’s knee cap.
Later that evening the two of them were discharged from the hospital with minor scrapes and bruises.  Rachel fussed over her two boys’ heroics and prepared a special meal.  Everyone consoled Sam over his twin’s death.  Even though the man was a vile piece of excrement he was still an integral part of his life.
“What the fuck?” Dean exclaimed, earning a couple of stares from the surrounding café patrons.  A silver haired woman in her seventies shushed him.
“Yo, Deano; quit it will ya!  If I would have known you were going to be imitating a food processor tonight, I would have stayed over at Sam’s hotel.”
“No, not yet; I did not want to ruin his Thanksgiving.  He was so happy that we were all a big happy family.  I’ll tell him when we take our morning jog later on.”
“You have turned into Cruella Deville since the tasty Blechkuchen moved in on your territory.”
“Shit Dean, I am so fucking sorry.  We just wanted to get a bit high.  The kid we got the stuff from must have sold us some hard core stuff.  I promise this will never happen again.
“We are going to a karaoke party now, Cas.  So I expect you to have some fun.  I am not saying for you to be off duty but chill out, man.”
“No, don’t leave me.”  Cas felt Dean shiver.  He smoothed his hair and kissed his temple.
“Sorry, force of habit.”
“Dude, I can give you money and it’s not my freaking fault my parents gave you up.”  Adam pulled Dean’s hair harder causing his youngest brother to hiss.
Castiel’s hot breath against his skin caused Dean’s pants to tighten around his groin area.  Cas was going to kill him if he did not get to fuck him soon.  “Baby, drink this for me, please.  I don’t want you to get sick.”
The dark haired man opened the door and scanned the woman from head to toe to make sure she did not hide any weapons.  He invited her inside.  The woman smirked.  “I thought you would be taller.   You know with you being in the Secret Service and all.”
As Mister Bush continued boring half of the crowd with his unrehearsed speech in his annoying nasal Texan twang, Secret Service Agent Castiel Novak rolled his ocean blue eyes.  He was sweating like a pig being led to a slaughterhouse for execution underneath his work uniform which consisted of a typical Men in Black suit.  Dark Ray Ban aviator glasses covered his beautiful baby blues and they were a gift from Heaven, because they blocked anyone from witnessing every time he rolled his eyes at good old George W’s plethora of faux pas.
“I see your lover is not here.  I was looking forward in torturing you in front of him before I killed the two of you.”  Adam trailed the blunt military knife down Dean’s face down to his carotid artery.
“Signore Maclachlan was court martialed for beating a soldier, whom he suspected of being homosexual.  The man was in a coma for two weeks as a result of the beating.  He was dishonorably discharged and in the process lost all of his veteran benefits.  Maclachlan served a year in military prison.  He was transferred to a mental hospital for psychiatric treatment because he did not pass the evaluations provided by the military psychologists.  He managed to escape and the rest is history.”
“That is half of the reason why I loathe you with all of my being.  I also plan on ending up with all of your money.”
Gabe suggested they play Dominos before going to bed.  Dean cleared his throat.  “Before we start playing, there is something I need to tell the two of you.”
Gabe scurried to the sink where he acted as if he was retching.  Castiel laughed heartily.  “He can go for classier women.”
“Are you ok, Dean?”  Castiel was relieved.  Dean was acting like his old self.  His t-shirt’s sleeves were a tad singed.  The actor’s eyes were red and his voice was hoarse.  Other than that it seemed he had not gotten burned.
“Come here, Gigantor” The two newly discovered siblings shared a long warm embrace.  Gabriel soon joined them and motioned for Cas to partake as well.  The quartet laughed soon after.  “OK, enough of the chick flick moment.  I feel as if I am trapped in the Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants or something.”
“Whatever,” Dean murmured as he ate some of the rice.  Castiel ignored the actor and ate all of his salad and chicken lo mein.  He drank some hot tea to wash the delicious meal down.  Pam forced Dean to drink some of the tea, as well.
Chad aka Adam approached a cherry wood table, where Pam had left her Blackberry.  He searched her contacts and scrolled down to the letter D.  When his eyes landed on Dean Winchester’s address, he smirked evilly.  “Things are becoming easier now.”  He rummaged through her 100% genuine Italian leather purse and found a batch of keys.  Adam knew one of these opened the door to Dean’s house.
Gabriel cut in.  “Dude, when we watched Bullitt you practically had wood throughout the film.  I don’t know if Steve McQueen or the car gave you the hard on.”
Dean rubbed the back of his neck. “Two weeks…and then you will be history.  I’m telling you guys no one is trying to kill me.”
The shoot took four hours.  Dean was beyond tired at the end of it.  The photographer and Lancôme exec shook hands with him.  They congratulated the actor and told him the campaign would be a huge success.
“Shut the fuck up, Gabe!  Castiel, why didn’t you tell Fassbinder to not stand so close to you while you played, huh?  He was practically fucking you in front of everyone!”
Castiel chimed in.  “Your scheme is riddled with flaws.  There is no way the two of you will get away with this.  Samuel and Gabriel know that you escaped so they must have notified the authorities by now.  The police are most likely searching for us right now.  Even my former boss at the Secret Service is on the hunt for you.”
“Cassie Bear?”  Gabriel murmured.  Samuel elbowed him in the stomach.
“Don’t worry about me.  Where are Gabe and Sam?”
Bela pouted with arms crossed.  Her hazel eyes shot daggers at the visibly sloshed man.  “The copious amount of wine you have imbibed in such a short amount of time has obviously assaulted your faculties.”  She inched closer to Dean, who stood now.  One of her French manicured hands trailed down the blond man’s torso.
Dean kissed him chastely on the lips.  “Thanks for telling me.”  Cas wrapped his arms around Dean as the two of them settled to go to sleep.  Dean was starting to understand why Castiel was afraid of getting emotionally attached to someone and telling them he loved them.
The female form stirred a little but remained unconscious.  Dean glared at his psycho sibling.  “Leave her out of this man. Your illogical beef is with me and no one else.”
Senior Agent Singer banged his beefy hand on his cherry wood desk rattling his coffee cup in the process.  “I have never witnessed such incompetence in my entire twenty five year career in the service!  The ridiculous stunt you pulled yesterday can mess up the progress made between the US and certain Middle Eastern countries since 911.”
“I am sorry Dean but Castiel has a piece of shrapnel around six inches wide stuck in his back.  He is losing a lot of blood.”
The German born Fassbinder had not removed his aquamarine eyes from Castiel.  “Aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend, Winchester?”
He took in much needed breath and coughed water out.  Cas remained kneeling at his side.  Once Dean released all the water, he helped him sit down.  Dean’s breathing was returning to its normal state.  “Deano, you gave us quite a fright!  What happened?”  Gabriel asked as he held on to his boss’ cold and clammy hand.
“Come on boss man, it will be loads of fun!”  Gabriel grabbed Dean’s hand and led him to the lake’s dock.  A bald man, who resembled Mr. Clean, secured three of the small boats for the group.  Sam and Gabe hopped on the first one.  Castiel instructed Dean to take the middle boat so he would be safe in that spot.  Castiel would be with Max in the third boat, where he would have Dean in his sight at all times.
Castiel was mentally scolding himself for crossing the line with his client.  His number one priority was to take care of the actor’s well being and keeping him safe 24/7.  The first rule in the guard business was to never develop feelings for the person in your charge.  Shit!  Thank God Gabe discovered them before things got out of control.
Once they reached the bedroom, Castiel threw Dean on the mattress.  He straddled him.  Dean’s eyes had darkened.  He licked his swollen lips.  Castiel’s eyes, which had practically turned onyx, stared at them.  “You have no idea how hot you look right now,” Cas whispered in Dean’s ear.
After that the acting bug bit him really hard on the ass and he joined the school’s drama club.  He knew if he remained in the small town he would never make it as an actor.  It took him five years to save enough money to leave his hometown and have enough money to sustain him until he found decent employment.  Dean worked at Starbucks and later as a waiter at Spago’s.  During his days off he would go on dozens of auditions.  His first real job was as an extra in an Old Navy spot in which he only wore cargo shorts in a summer themed commercial.
An hour later, Dean and Castiel were jogging down a snow covered bike trail by Miller’s Pond.  Cas was constantly on the lookout for anything suspicious.  Underneath the several layers of clothes he had on was his pistol.  He was about to tell Dean, when the blond man grabbed his hand and led him to a patch of pine trees.
Dean sat down.  He really could not take any more bad news.  “There is extensive internal bleeding.  He will receive a blood transfusion before surgery and most likely afterwards. He is O+, which is the universal blood type.”
“Are you kidding me?  That’s my dream come true, if you would come live with me in California.  I promise to make you happy and you will not be home sick.”  Gabriel kissed him hard on the lips.
The following afternoon, Gabriel and Sam evaded half a dozen paparazzi that were flocking the sidewalk outside the hotel.  The two lovebirds had seen the video in YouTube earlier in the day.  Gabe had tried calling the newlyweds but their phones were off.  When they reached the room, Gabriel started banging on the door.  “Come on you guys, I know you are in there!”
Castiel decided to break the silence.  “I want to apologize for my behavior this afternoon.  You need to know my priority is to keep you safe.”
“Dude, that chick gives me the heebs and the jeebs.”
“Max is in town and wants to meet at Dillon’s for a few drinks.”
“Nothing much really; I’m going for my daily morning jog and then will go over a movie script Pam left for me.”
Max and Castiel chuckled as the two men remained lip locked for quite some time.  Dean coughed.  “One of you is going to need fresh air soon.  I refuse to administer CPR to either of you!”
Dean did as told and lied down.  Castiel wrapped his arms around Dean’s middle and watched him go to sleep.  He kissed his neck.  “The nightmare is finally over, sweetheart.”
Castiel held on to Dean’s hand.  The blond man retrieved a copy of each of the twin’s birth certificates and handed them to Sam and Gabe.  He gave them time to register the information.  Gabriel’s mouth gaped open and Sam frowned making him resemble a Cro-Magnon man.  “This can’t be?”  His hazel eyes landed on Dean.  “You are our brother?”
Meanwhile, in the suite’s other bedroom, Dean’s pulse was starting to beat back to its normal pace.  Perspiration covered every minute inch of his muscular body.  Castiel licked some of the sweat from his lover’s torso.  Dean’s cock was still buried within him.  “Shit, babe; I think we fucked on top of every piece of furniture in the bedroom.”  Dean laughed as the two of them gazed at a broken lamp and vase.
Pam smacked the back of his head.  “Can you please speak in simple terms, doctor?  My friend here dropped out of school in the tenth grade.”
An hour later, Dean’s stomach was full since he had eaten two full plates and drank two cups of hot tea.  This had sobered him up quite a bit.  He decided not to pay attention to the bodyguard, who he planned on giving the pink slip tomorrow.  Gabriel handed him two aspirins and he swallowed them with water.
Two beefy federal agents grabbed and handcuffed him as they strolled by the open casket.  Barbara Bush sat and wrapped her wrinkled liver spot littered hands around Cas’ neck.  He tried fighting the elderly woman but she leapt on top of him and they started wrestling on the floor.
“Mom, you did not have to go through all that trouble,” Castiel murmured as he got out of bed.
“Remember your Grandpa Uriel left your father the ranch in Wyoming?”  Castiel nodded.  “Your dad managed to change his last will and testament six months before he passed away.  One day he woke up and headed to his attorney.  Anyways, he wanted me to give you the papers illustrating you as the new owner once you settled down.”  Her gaze landed on Dean.  “I can see you have finally found someone, who you will hopefully spend the remainder of your life with.”
“Will you excuse me a moment, Mr. Crowley?”
Dean could not believe how swiftly the four days in which Castiel remained hospitalized flew by.  He was extremely grateful for that, because his lover had acted like a complete spoiled baby.  The bodyguard remained insisting to be discharged before the fourth day.  When it came time for his meals, he complained about the food.  On several occasions, Dean had been tempted to pull Castiel over his lap and spank him.
After that the two of them hit it off.  Dean even assisted Rachel in preparing a couple of pies for tomorrow’s Thanksgiving dinner.  Castiel appeared in the cozy yet spacious kitchen.  “Mom, can I borrow my man for a moment?”
“Don’t worry about me.  My priority is to make sure you vacate this room safely.  Cover your mouth with my t-shirt.  Now move!”
“I am Dean Winchester’s husband; that’s who I am, sweetie.  Why don’t you go eat a burger and leave us alone?”
“Yeah, Gabe deserves to find a life partner, who will love him unconditionally.”
“I have a couple of up and comers.  Have you heard of Dean Winchester?  I represent him.”
“I am an agent with the William Morris Agency in LA and Dean Winchester happens to be my most promising client.  You never watched Young, Desperate and Beautiful?”
Dean wanted to find out once and for all why Adam had such a hard on in killing him.  “So why you don’t tell us the fucking truth, man? You want to kill me out of jealousy cos our parents gave the two of you away and kept me?”
Dean was loyal to the soap opera but knew if he re-signed with it; he would always regret not accepting the movie role.  He signed on for the action hero part and received a hefty paycheck of two million dollars.  Michael Bay directed the movie and the man was a tyrant on set, when it came to getting down to business.  However, off the set he was a great friend to have and offered Dean great advice.
He breathed deeply as his gaze landed on a slumbering form by one of the corners.   Castiel scurried over to an unconscious Dean.  Since his hands were tied he was unable to feel the other man’s pulse.  He knelt adjacent to him and tilted his head to the side in order to verify Dean was breathing.  “Thank  God” he whispered.
Cas went on with the lesson.  “An integral rule to remember is not to use the old kick in the groin routine.  Most assailants expect this and will anticipate that move.  There are three body strike points:  eyes/throat, bridge of the nose and the knees.  I will demonstrate the moves on you.”
“It takes some people longer than others to realize what their sexual preferences are.  I had sex with a man for the first time in college.  I knew it was something I would definitely repeat again afterwards.”
Dean smiled brightly.  “The jackass finally came to his senses and admitted we are married.”
“Maybe I will rearrange your face.  Let’s see if lover boy will stay at your side if you look like a freak.”  Adam brought the knife back up to Dean’s face.  He cut his left cheek.  Dean closed his eyes and refused to give the whack a doodle the satisfaction of hearing him whimper or moan due to pain.
“You’re welcome, kid.”  Dean affectionately ruffled the boy’s red mop of hair.  “Hey, mind if I join you?”
“This is ridiculous!  You and I are not married.  Put me the hell down now!”
All of a sudden, Dean’s body covered his.  They kissed.  Dean was in the process of getting up, when he fell down next to him.  His eyes were closed.  Castiel frantically shook him.  “Dean, what’s wrong?!”
“You keep on deluding yourself, Deano.”
Castiel smiled.  Who was he kidding?  He was head over heels in love with Dean Winchester.  Dean quickly gazed at Cas before making his final decision.  “Alright, I’ll be Hypnose’s model or whatever.”
He blow dried Cas’ unruly dark hair and then put gel on it once it dried.  In no time his hair was tamed and looking fashionable.  Castiel had shaved after showering.   “There, you look frakin hot!”
Cerulean eyes clashed with jade ones.  “No, he and I decided to remain friends; that’s all.”  He swallowed nervously.
He felt slightly better afterwards.  Dean changed into black sweat pants, a faded Real Madrid jersey, socks and running sneakers.   As he tied his shoes, the blond thespian could not stop himself, and remembered last night’s masturbating session courtesy of his bodyguard.  No way in hell did he bat for the other team!  Dean Winchester has always been a ladies’ man and he had never been attracted to dudes!  He swallowed hard before entering the kitchen.
Gabriel clapped and stood up.  “Pretty soon Sammy will be a free man!”
“Dude, you have something on your face.”  The blond actor was going to wipe it with a napkin but Max beat him to it.  He cupped Castiel’s flushed face and licked the pate leisurely.  “There, all clean.”
Castiel’s demeanor remained serious.  “I will try but I am here in one capacity and that is to ensure your safety.”  Dean headed to his bedroom to shower and change.  Castiel made sure the guard remained outside and locked the suite’s door.  He also went to take a shower in Gabe’s room.
A shot rang out in the silent early morning air.  Adam howled in pain and dropped the knife.  Sam rapidly took the weapon as he shoved his brother off him.  Adam lied on a fetal position holding his right upper arm.  Blood oozed from the fresh wound.  “You fucking bastard, you shot me!”
Gasps were heard throughout the pub.  The manager appeared with a security guard.  “Dean, what has gotten into you?” Castiel asked.
Pam yelled his name, when she climaxed.  Chad came a few seconds later.  He unrolled the used condom, tied it up and tossed it aside.  He traced patterns across Pamela’s perspiring toned abdomen.  “So what do you do for a living, Pamela?”
“What the fuck?  It can’t be; why would he want to kill me?”
“He is telling the truth.  I am not gay!”  A livid Dean vacated the rec room.
Castiel bolted on top of a terrified Gabriel.  He wrapped his lean and long fingers around the frantic assistant’s neck.  Gabe’s honey eyes pleaded for Dean’s help.  The actor remained sitting on the straw mat sipping sake as he witnessed his bodyguard turned supposed hubby choke the life out of Gabriel, the busybody.
“Thanks, Sam.”
Dean had exited the Impala and embraced his brother in law.  “What’s up, Jiminy Cricket?”
Gabriel, who had finally ceased dancing said, “Sweet, so you are bi!  I knew there was a reason why I automatically liked you, Cas.”  Dean remained standing where he was with his mouth hung open.  When he realized he probably resembled a trout gasping for air, he shut it closed.
An hour later after the two of them made love in bed and took a shower.  Gabriel led a blindfolded Sam into their room.  “I hope you like the surprise.”  He removed the silk handkerchief from his boyfriend’s eyes.  Sam gasped.
Gabriel rode in the ambulance with a bloodied, unconscious Dean as it raced from the site of the terrifying accident to Wilshire Boulevard, where Good Samaritan Hospital was located at.   Gabe had been raised Catholic and even though he had not set foot in a church since his confirmation; he prayed to the Angel of Thursday since the crazy SUV driver almost killed his boss on said day.  No one, not even the cab driver, who was to drive them home, had been able to catch a glimpse of the mysterious vehicle’s tag.  Gabriel panicked since he witnessed Dean fly several feet in the air before crash landing on the hard sidewalk.
“I gather you are impressed by other attributes because you have not taken your eyes from my torso since you got here.”
Half an hour later, the nurse finally emerged looking haggard.  “Is the surgery over?”  a frazzled Dean inquired.
Dean finally spoke.  “Why the hell are you doing this?  It wasn’t my fault our parents gave you and Sam up for adoption.  He is not holding a grudge against them.  Why are you?”
“Don’t make jokes out of this!  I saw you kissing that little bitch in heat, Anna!”
Their foreheads touched.  “I’m so sorry, Cas.  I promise not to be an insecure jerk anymore.  You have no idea how much I love you.  It scares me sometimes.”
Castiel surprised everyone by punching Dean in the jaw.  The blond man saw blue jays flying in front of his eyes.  Sam was going to hold his arm, when Dean punched Castiel on the nose.  Blood ran down his nostrils.  The bodyguard was going to leap on Dean but Max held him by the arms.  The beefy security guard caught Dean, who was already in a fighting stance and escorted him outside.  An embarrassed Gabe and Sam followed them at a discreet distance.
“I hope they catch the fucker,” Sam said as he held Gabriel tight.
“Hey, you deserve so much more, Cas.  I love you so much, babe.”  Castiel cupped Dean’s face and kissed his lips tenderly.
Upon hearing the words, Castiel’s skin blanched and his armpits sweated profusely.  The latter tended to happen when he was extremely nervous.  He swiftly assisted President Bush in getting to his feet.  As soon as he knew, the man was well; Castiel strolled over to his two co-workers and the Middle Eastern man.  Cas apologized profusely to the supposed assassin.
Two hours later the sun had gone down and the moon started to make its first appearance of the early evening.  Jimmy ran into the kitchen.  “It’s starting!  Morning Star is about to give birth!”  All of the kitchen’s habitants followed the teen to the stables.
Sam and Jimmy chuckled.  “I think he was referring to the Mustang not you,” Sam said.
“I know I am the center of a twisted love triangle.  I guess I have to learn how to share,” the dark haired man added with a dramatic sigh.  His eyes scanned the entire perimeter.
“Yeah and at first I became hysterical because I did not see neither Dean nor Cas.  I thought perhaps they had perished in the explosion.  When my eyes fell on them, I almost wept with joy.  But when I got closer, I saw the shrapnel on Castiel’s back and how it was bleeding profusely.”
“Follow me Castiel.  I will show you where your chamber is.  Good night, Deano.”
Besides roasting like a pig at a Hawaiian luau’s rotisserie due to the aforementioned dark suit, Castiel had to tame his naturally unruly dark hair with half a pound of gel.  Every time he caught sight of himself, the agent would cringe, since his slicked back hair made him resemble a seal.   Special Agent Novak had graduated at the top of the class at Langley and had been recruited by the CIA.  Once he had completed his training and was about to make his debut for the intelligence agency, the offer for him to work as a secret service agent was presented to the ambitious recruit.
“Later today after we go to the police station, I am taking you to the hospital.  The EMT said you have two fractured ribs but I want to make sure it is not anything serious.”
Castiel’s tongue swirled around the engorged staff.  His head bobbed front and back, as he took almost all of Dean’s cock inside his mouth.  Dean continued moaning and thrusting into him.  The actor admitted to himself, this had to be the best damn blow job he ever received.  His vision started getting red as Castiel’s right hand sunk deeper into his left hip.  “Oh God Cas, I’m almost there!”
“Thanks, and this is way too much.  I know you earn peanuts at the carwash.”
“I think I might have a hunch,” Castiel whispered before turning towards him.  His bright gaze appreciatively scanned all of his beloved’s face.  He traced Dean’s freckles with two of his lean, long fingers.  The actor leaned his face to Cas’ and kissed him longingly.  Their mouths devoured each other as the two reunited lovers landed on a pile of hay.  Their hands groped their heated bodies as they removed every single garment of clothing.  They made slow love well into the night.  “I love you so much, Dean, it hurts.”
He scurried down like a spider monkey and handed the kite to the small boy, who had joined them.  “Merci, monsieur.”
Whenever he flicked his tongue over the bottom part of Castiel’s cock; one of the bodyguard’s long elegant hands grabbed on to Dean’s hair.  “Shit Dean, you are pretty good at this.  Did you take lessons or something?”
Dean rapidly stopped him by holding on to his shoulders and setting him down.  “Babe, you heard the man.  You still are weak and need to recover here, where you will get twenty four hour medical attention.”
“Oh and there is no way I am allowing you to be shadowing me dressed like Colombo.  You can wear one of your favorite dark suits for the press conference but something hip for the premiere.  If you don’t mind I gave Gabe your measurements for clothes and shoes.”
Dean actually blushed.  “I hope so.”
Max emerged from his suite after calling 112.  “What can I do?”
“Much better now thanks to your TLC” Castiel turned to look at Dean.  They stared at each other for a while.  That was something the two of them would never tire of; gazing into each other’s eyes for long periods of time.  Castiel ran his thumb across Dean’s lower lip.  He brought the digit inside the warm cavern of his mouth, where he took his time sucking it.  Cas peppered kisses all over Dean’s face.  “Have I ever told you how much I love your freckles?”  The bodyguard went on to kiss all of them.
Meanwhile, Pam was shaking her moneymaker at Avalon’s dance floor with a couple of girlfriends.  She had been severely stressed out the last couple of months and needed a night to unwind.  The sultry agent was also horny, as hell.  She had not had sex for three months.  Pam had broken her own record of going without any and she was tired as hell of using the Pocket Rocket and the Rabbit.  She would not leave Avalon tonight without a boy toy at her side.  She donned a black, tight and short Armani dress and six inch Manolo Blahnicks.
Once the kitchen was immaculate again, Gabriel poured coffee into two coffee mugs.  He handed one to Castiel and gestured for the dark haired man to join him in the island.  All of a sudden, Dean bellowed for his assistant to finally bring over the tequila.  “Oops!  I’ll be right back.”
Castiel beat him to the door.  He looked through the peephole before opening it.  The bodyguard chuckled.  He knew what Dean was doing.  Poor guy, he was obviously coming to terms with not being straight and was going to have sex with some woman to convince himself he was a modern day Casanova.
“You are under arrest for the attempted murders of Dean Winchester and Castiel Novak.  If it were up to me, you will rot in prison for injuring all those innocent lives with that explosion.”
“Should Cas open it in front of his mother?”  Sam just laughed making Dean more nervous than he already was.
Rows upon rows of tall Sensation Boxelder trees aligned the long driveway.  Dean started to relax as soon as he took in the tranquil view.  The nineteen hour drive from LA to Wyoming had stressed the hell out of him.  He had only stopped twice for short bathroom breaks.  He wanted to spend the 4th of July with Cas.  Dean smiled as soon as his eyes landed on a skinny form riding an ATV heading towards him.
The house’s vast backyard was decorated with red, white and blue balloons and banners.  Sam and Gabe were in charge of preparing the burgers and hotdogs, while Jimmy and Rachel brought out the hamburger and hotdog buns, cole slaw and baked beans.
“What about you?  This place looks like Dante’s Inferno,” Dean murmured in a hoarse voice.
“Please excuse me,” he stated while placing his napkin on the table.  He walked to the family room and closed the door.  “Castiel Novak speaking”
“Good night.  Sweet dreams and I hope you don’t speak in your sleep.  I don’t want to hear you moan when dreaming about Cas blowing you.”
Max’s hand remained firmly placed on Castiel’s narrow waist.  He smiled at his fellow thespian.  “Good day, to you as well, Winchester” There was a mischievous glint in Fassbinder’s aquamarine eyes.
“Yeah, he covered me before the SUV exploded.”   Dean observed as two young Italian men wheeled Castiel inside the ambulance.  He had to be laid face down on a gurney.   The smell of smoke and burned plastic was making Dean gag.  “I need to go with him,” he informed one of the paramedics.   The young man nodded and gestured for him to enter.
Ten minutes later Pam drove Ash and Chuck to their respective abodes.  Gabriel drove Dean’s cherished 1967 Chevy Impala.  Dean sat in shotgun and Castiel in the backseat.  The actor remained silent through the entire ten minute drive.  Why the hell did his friends insist he needed a twenty four hour babysitter?!  He had practically been on his own since his parents died when he was six.  From that age until he turned eighteen, Dean had lived in various foster homes.  If some diabolical douche bag really was after him, which he did not believe to be true, he could take care of himself.
“No!!!”  Dean screamed.  No way in hell was he going to get gay sex tips from Gabriel!   “Thanks but I can handle things.”
“Just open Internet Explorer and go to my favorites.  Then click on YouTube-Destiel.”
Gabe turned towards Dean and bowed at him.  Dean realized he also had to bow and did so.  His assistant handed him the bowl.  “Now you bow at Cas,” Gabriel whispered.   Dean did as instructed.  Castiel had no freaking idea what the hell was going on.
“Where the hell is Gabe?”
“Sorry, I was thinking about dad.”
“Did it ever occur to you to discuss this with me?  I’m only your husband after all!”  Dean paced the floor and ran a hand through his hair.
Castiel chuckled and headed to the bed, where he removed his t-shirt and lied on his stomach.  Gabriel sat on the mattress.  He removed the bandage from Castiel’s slightly bronzed back.  “Doesn’t look so bad, my friend” He went on to apply the ointment.  As Dean’s assistant smoothly lathered the ointment on the burn, Castiel closed his eyes.  He already missed Dean’s touch.  The actor would apply the antiseptic on his skin gingerly as if he was made out of glass.
Jimmy cackled diabolically.  “Chill out, man.  I’ve had my license for a week.  I know what I am doing.”
Castiel entered the house and noticed everyone had gone their separate ways.  Sam and Gabe were most likely getting ready for bed in the basement.  Jimmy was online chatting with Amelia and his mom preparing her next class lecture.  Where the hell was Dean?
Gabriel squirmed on the kitchen stool.  “Which slut did he bring over to make him believe he is a hetero?”
After they signed in, Castiel went to speak with the head of hotel security and explained what was happening to Dean.  The middle aged Japanese man was very amiable and professional.  He gave Castiel his word that he would keep a close look on the suite.  He would even have one of his men keep guard outside for their protection.  Cas had really liked the man.  They bowed to each other and shook hands.
“I’m sorry but I did not want to ruin your Thanksgiving.  I know I fucked up.”
Several days later, Castiel drove Dean’s beloved Impala through his hometown, Sycamore, Illinois.  Gabriel stated that Cas was definitely the love of Dean’s life, because the actor never allowed anyone to touch his baby’s steering wheel.  The only time Gabriel had been allowed to use the vehicle was when he had to drive a plastered Dean home.
Meanwhile, Gabe and Sam had finished showering together.   After making love for the second time that evening, the two lovers laid on the pull out bed in Sam’s small room.  Gabriel played with Samuel’s long chocolate colored hair.  “Sammy, what are your plans after you complete filming tomorrow?”
derriere.  Dean choked on his tequila.
“What is your itinerary for today, Winchester?”
As soon as they settled into a two bedroom suite, which smelled like cherry blossoms, Gabriel said good bye to his two friends.  “Deano, your clothes for the press conference, premiere and karaoke party are all sorted out in your bedroom.  I also asked the staff to stock your mini fridge with a couple of beers and your favorite snacks.”
“Sorry, laddie but I have to return to Edinburgh as soon as possible.  I can’t leave the shop unattended.”
Castiel laughed.  “I’m being an idiot.  Ever since I saw Kill Bill and hear this particular piece at the end of the movie, I always blubber like a baby.”
Dean’s beloved Impala waited for them at the LAX garage.  He kissed her hood as he caressed the smooth black surface.  “It’s great to be home, baby.”
Dean choked. “Yeah, thanks, you guys.”  His eyes did not leave Cas’ relieved ones.  His bodyguard smiled at him.  He helped Dean get up.  “I think we have had enough fun for the day.  Let’s head back to the hotel.”
He turned to Dean and kissed the tip of his nose.  “It was Pam asking if you had given me the Mustang already.  You know how nosy she can be.”
Dean sincerely hurt for the poor bastard.  Oops! He should never associate that word with Sam.  He could not fathom what a difficult time his older brother was experiencing.  Adam was his twin and according to the pictures Crowley took to the police station, the two rug rats had been inseparable during their entire childhood.  Dean shocked himself by enveloping the Sasquatch in a warm embrace.  “We’ve got each other now, dude, and never forget that.”
Dean was scarfing down his second slice of pumpkin pie, when the doorbell rang.  Jimmy volunteered to go open it.  A minute later he returned with a petite red haired woman in tow.  She had expressive dark eyes and porcelain skin.  Her gaze searched around and as soon as it landed on Castiel, she smiled radiantly.
The actor pointed to the bedside table.  The bodyguard retrieved two Trojan condoms and a container of KY Jelly.  He started ripping the condom wrapper, when Dean stopped him.  “What’s wrong?  If you are not ready…we can wait.”
He pulled Castiel down on the ground with him.  “Dean, what are you doing?”
He knew it!  A piece of brownie lay inside a small transparent plastic bag.  Castiel discretely sniffed it and instantly knew it was laced with marijuana.  Dean had ceased flying the kite with the red haired boy after his mother told him they had to go.  He waved bye at the actor gifting him with a gummy smile.  Dean waved and headed back.  He stopped on his tracks, when witnessing Sam and Gabriel’s mad behavior.
“Run that by me again?  You were set to marry…a woman?”
Gabriel smirked.  “Oh just sushi prep; see you guys tomorrow evening.  Do not make any plans!  I have something special arranged for the three of us.”   He blew a kiss at them and exited the suite.
“That’s bullshit!  I mean all of this does not make a lick of sense.  Who cares if the two of you become an item?  I know Deano pretty well and I can imagine how difficult it was for him to initiate something with you.  He abhors chick flick moments.”
The geisha giggled and pointed at the clothes.  Castiel was majorly confused.  “Do you want us to put this on?”  The girl was either extremely shy or mentally deranged since she kept her head down the entire time.  She gave Castiel a navy blue men’s kimono and handed a pine green one to Dean.
All of a sudden, the elderly man started playing “The Lonely Shepherd”.  Every time Cas listened to this particular piece his eyes got watery.  Dean instantly noticed.  His hand covered Castiel’s right one over the table.  He realized what he had done and swiftly removed it.  “Are you alright?”
“This is the last time; you make a fool out of me, Castiel Novak!”
“Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday to you, Happy Birthday Dear Cas, Happy Birthday to you!”  Castiel woke up on Thanksgiving morning to his family, friends and Dean singing around his bed.  Thankfully, he had slept with boxers and an old wife beater the previous night.  He would have been mortified to have been caught in his birthday suit by his mother and Jimmy.  He rubbed his sleepy baby blues as his mom hugged him.  “Happy Birthday, baby boy”
Dean went on to rinse his glass, when a gravelly good morning was said to the kitchen’s occupants by the wannabe Kevin Costner.  He had been contemplating dismissing the man’s services later today.  Dean was convinced he could handle any psycho and did not need to be babysat by a disgraced former Secret Service agent.
Castiel peeked through the peephole.  The woman looked safe enough.  Just in case, Cas always had his friendly Taser gun by the door.   If this Pam Kowolski tried anything, Cas would tase her ass right on the spot.
A knock was heard on the door.  The detective bid the person entrance.  A uniformed female officer informed him Crowley Maclachlan had arrived.  “That is great news; please escort him to the interrogation room.”
“Hey, Deano, don’t blame yourself.  He would hate seeing you like this.  You know he would never blame you for anything.  Let’s go get you some chamomile tea.”
“You better get used to the entire ass kissing, because this is only the beginning, Dean-o.”
Dean had been eyeballing the cake box since the two men entered the hospital room.   He turned to Gabriel.  “Dude, is that cake?”
“Dean, shut the hell up.  You are acting like an ungrateful spoiled brat!”  Gabriel exclaimed.  His boss was acting like a major dick towards Castiel.  He would not blame the guy if he walked away from this nuthouse.
“I understand where you are coming from, Dean but this outcome is too easy.  In all of his prior attempts, the killer was immaculate in not leaving any evidence.  He knew there were cameras all over the hotel, specifically the parking garage.  Why would he purposely allow himself to be videotaped at the scene of the crime?  This all doesn’t make sense.”
“No offense, but can we go for round two.  I really don’t like to talk during sex,” Pamela interrupted.
Out of nowhere, the movie’s producer, Jerry Bruckheimer and rising star, Max Fassbinder stopped by their table.  Dean greeted both men and asked the duo to join them.  He noticed Cas had remained silent and his eyes had widened since the two men appeared.
“Dude, we are going to be in public settings.  Mr. Killer is not going to risk being caught by trying to gank me, when there are tons of people around us.  Go ahead and tell Sinister, we’ll stop by for him.”
“Why the temper tantrum and need to drink so early in the day?”
The two men helped each other dress.  Before leaving the stables, they saw Morning Star nursing Impala.  “I am glad you were here to witness this with me,” Castiel said as he held on to Dean’s hand.
“I don’t understand.”
Dean smirked.  “Come on, I would not mind going one on one with you, Cas.  Besides, I need to protect myself.”
“You are being demoted to a desk job immediately, idjit!”
“I should have known better.  Listen you are a terrific guy but…”
The quartet did not say a word as the paparazzi buzzed around them like starving vultures after a carcass.  They stepped into a taxi and dropped Samuel off at the movie studio, where the Bond movie was being filmed.  Gabriel kissed him hard before they said good-bye once again.  Long distance relationships sucked big fat hairy balls!  Sam said farewell to Dean and Cas and was on his way.
Gabriel reluctantly removed the tangy and sweet confection from his mouth.  “You can’t be this dumb, Deano.”
Castiel had never felt so much panic in quite some time.  He opened the door and he could feel the heat being emitted from within the suite, before entering.  The smell of smoke was overwhelming.
Dean was furious.  “You are a fucking hypocrite!  I know you want me just as bad as I want you.  What we did on that bed right now is proof of it.  You are afraid of falling for me.  I am beginning to think you used Fassbinder as an excuse to not get close to me.”
“Why is this happening?  He doesn’t deserve to be suffering like this.”
“So my dear brother, you choose our little brother over me.  It is good to see where your true loyalty lies.”  Adam appeared from behind the basketball post.  Samuel yanked the knife from the tree.  “Now is when you finally grew a pair, brother.”
After everyone ordered wine and appetizers, the waiter brought them a basket of warm, freshly baked bread.  Cas lost his appetite as he witnessed the insipid and shallow model feed Dean a piece of bread.  Castiel could not even talk to Gabe, who continued texting Sam.
Later that afternoon, Castiel was venting his frustrations out on a punching bag Dean had in the rec- room.  His research on the cartridge only came up with it being manufactured in Finland and it was used in the Afghan and Iraqi Wars.  He was convinced the killer was a war vet.  He gave a round kick to the defenseless punching bag as Dean entered.  “What did the poor bag ever do to you?”
“Come on, did you grow a vagina all of a sudden, and are chicken now?”
Dean scurried over to him.  “Are you alright?”
Dean was galvanized with Castiel’s efficiency.  “I’m impressed, Mr. Costner.”
“Bite me, Hendrickson,” Castiel said through grinding teeth.  Someone bellowed right after that the President’s mother had passed out due to the commotion.  “Can this day get any worse?”  Cas thought to himself.
“If you will excuse me, I will go change.  Pamela paid me for two weeks in advance and I keep my word.  If by the end of the two weeks no attempts have been made against your life, then I will hit the road.”
Cas scanned the entire suite and was relieved to see no balcony in sight.  The only way in and out was through the front door; so psycho killer would have a difficult time trying to enter.  The bodyguard decided he would sleep on the couch, which was situated to the left side of the door.
“I am not hiding anything, Gabe.  I love pussy and will never tire of it as long as I live; you get it!”  The blond 6’1 thespian’s face was as crimson as a red jalapeno.  He was not able to look at either his assistant or bodyguard in the eye.
Later that evening, Gabriel treated Samuel to a celebratory dinner at a local Italian restaurant.  Pam was able to get Sam to sign an exclusive contract with a modeling agency.  They had an interview scheduled with a Dolce & Gabbana exec after the Holidays.  While the lovebirds ate their scintillating dinner, Dean was preparing for his night with Cas.
“Thanks dude.  What class are you taking again?”
“Not bad at all, Maclachlan.  You are a bloody genius, mate.”  He laughed.  His plan was coming along famously.  Poor Samuel was taking the heat instead of him.  By the time the police were on his tail, he would be in the States.  He had purchased a plane ticket to Los Angeles under a false identity.  Adam knew how to create false immigration documents.  Inside a duffel bag, lay his newly created British Passport.  He had breakfast in a cozy café in the airport as he waited for the announcement to  board his flight.
“He has my birth certificate, as well as my brother’s.”
Castiel tipped his chin up.  “Relax, will you.  I already told you that my dad died on duty.  He was the local sheriff and was shot by a junkie, who was holding up a convenience store.”
“Shut up and listen, dumb ass.  Dean’s career is just taking off.   Can’t you see how much you mean to him if he is willing to embark on a relationship with you?  The shit will hit the fan once news breaks that he plays for the other team.  People are more open minded now a days but still there are those narrow minded idiots, who will not take the news with a grain of salt.  Some of his fans will probably boycott his films now.”
They sat down to watch the fireworks.  Dean wrapped his arms around Castiel, who sat in front of him.  The actor licked his lips nervously.  “Cas, we need to talk.”
The officers dragged him into the interrogation room.  “Yeah right, dumb ass!  You were caught with your hands in the cookie jar!”  Dean bellowed before the group disappeared inside the room.
Dean’s lower lip remained caught in between Cas’ teeth as the two men stared like deer caught in headlights at the short assistant.  The actor, who straddled Castiel at the premise moment hopped away from his bodyguard swiftly, reminding Gabe of a crazed kangaroo.
“Didn’t you make snow angels as a kid?”  He started spreading his arms and legs over the snow covered ground.  Castiel smiled at his husband and copied his movements.  He did not have any worries for a couple of minutes.  Dean’s happiness was too infectious.
“Great this makes me feel a lot better,” Dean murmured.
“Shut the fuck up!  I knew coming from you it had to be a deviant sex act.”
“No…because he had an overnight guest.”
Twenty minutes later, the quartet arrived at Hotel Principe di Savoia.   Cas had fallen asleep with his head leaning against Dean’s shoulder.   Samuel carried the slumbering bodyguard with ease into the elevator.  The hotel guests gawked and murmured to each other as they witnessed this.  Dean and Gabriel took another elevator to the Deluxe Mosaic Room the three of them were sharing in the fifth floor.
She handed her first born a thick manila envelope.  “Go ahead; open it.”
The following morning Dean and Castiel waited for Gabe outside of the hotel.  The assistant was in charge of bringing their entire luggage down to the SUV, which the hotel had arranged to drive them to the airport.  The driver stood talking to the two Americans by the sidewalk.  He and Castiel were discussing yesterday’s Inter vs. Milan match.  The bodyguard remembered to check underneath the vehicle for explosives.
“Shut your pie hole!”
He continued rowing madly.  One of his oars got caught with an underwater rock and impeded his progress.  Dean stood up and fought with the wooden oar.  He became so agitated upon seeing the other boat pass him that his boat capsized, sending him into the cold water.
Dean gently wiped a tear from Castiel’s face.  “God that was a lot of shit for a kid to go through in such a short period of time”
“It wasn’t your fault.  I should have called you before Gabe and Sam left.”
“Thank you so much!  How did you know this has always been my dream car?”
“OK but if you are not back in ten; I will come back here and kick in the door!”
Twenty minutes later, he was brought into the station.  His gaze instantly landed on Gabriel, whose vibrant honey eyes were red rimmed.  His nose was red, also.  Dean sat next to him, holding his hand.  Castiel threw daggers at him with his cerulean eyes.  Dean rose and headed towards him but Castiel held his waist.  “So you are the sick/evil dick, who has been trying to kill me, huh?”
