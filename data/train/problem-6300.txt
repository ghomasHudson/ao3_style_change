“Also, how did you get the keys to this place? I’ve been wondering about that, actually.” Bruce said.
Tony lifted his head up, trying to figure out who’s dickish enough to reflect sunlight to people’s eyes and then give him a piece of their mind, when his train of thought suddenly halted. Sitting in one of the booths by the window was the most beautiful man Tony had ever seen. He was blonde, with broad shoulders and incredible arms, reading a book in his left hand as he propped up a knife that was reflecting sunlight to Tony’s eyes with his right hand. He was tall, if he stood up he would be taller than Tony by at least a head. His grey t-shirt left very little to the imagination, and Tony saw the most ridiculous shoulder-to-waist ratio known to man, and Tony knew supermodels without that proportion. Even from a far, Tony could see his patrician nose, his full lips and the wide set of his brows, all coming together to make a face that Michelangelo should have used as a model when he sculpted the David.
“Right, I know that. It’s just that-- I don’t exactly know how to tell you, which is weird, since I’ve had to tell you this, like, three times already but still. Well, technically I only had to tell you once. The second time you found out by yourself, and the third time we found out together. I mean, I still have a hard time believing it myself. Because this, this was nothing short of a miracle, Steve…”
Thor and Jane observed them silently, a look of longing on their faces as they looked at the couple sitting across from them. Thor broke the silence, “Uh, Jane, would you like some of my stew?”
“Locking up, Boss!” Thor called out to Steve. Lights have started to be turned off on the bar’s floor, leaving only Tony’s office as the only illuminated room.
“Well if it makes you feel better, I think the only reason I figured you out is because you squeaked out my name last night. Just be careful not to do that with anyone else though,” Jamie chuckled at Peter.
“Neither did I, stud. But after Dr. Rosenberg said we’d have another son, I thought it only fitting to name him after one of his grandfather’s.”
Tony’s just gonna defer to Steve when it came to the intricacies of dealing with his emotionally stunted bestie.
“What? Powerpuff Girls?” Tony laughed at his son’s assertion, “how did you know about the Powerpuff girls, baby?”
“Uh-huh. It fits! Because Joe also has yellow hair and blue eyes. And he’s the joy and the laughter because he laughs a lot.”
“I thought we were good together,” Ulysses sullenly continued, “she was nice, and she cared about me. We’re so similar to each other. We have the same goals, the same views. But I guess that wasn’t enough for her. She wants to get to know other people. Meet people who are smarter, better, nicer than me…”
The rest of Peter’s family also have celebrity status through achievements of their own. His godparents were none other than Thor and Bruce, the King of Asgard/God of Thunder and a world-renowned Nobel laureate gamma radiation scientist respectively. Among his aunts are Natasha Romanov, best known as the Black Widow, the woman who leaked the dark secrets of the deep infiltration of HYDRA within the ranks of the US government through SHIELD, and Pepper Potts, one of the few beta females to ever become the CEO of a Fortune 500 company and a trailblazer for women everywhere. While among his uncles he was fortunate enough to have Bucky Barnes aka the Winter Soldier, the Hawkeye Clint Barton, James Rhodes the War Machine and Sam Wilson aka the Falcon.
Steve wryly shook his head at Tony’s antics. His love had an odd way of showing his affection that was for sure, but Steve couldn’t deny that he found it endearing. Tony showed his affections through his actions and through his words, rare as they were. One would need to read between the lines to decipher what he meant, but Steve never doubted the sincerity of his love and affection for Steve. Every time Tony looked at him or smiled at him, Steve could feel it as surely as he could feel the beat of his own heart.
“It’s my journal. I write in it every night.” Steve flipped through the pages, showing Tony his neat handwriting and the pictures he put in the journal as well as some doodles that Tony knew Steve drew himself.
The boys were sad, to say the least. Though it seemed they were less sad about the absence of new sibling and more for the fact that their Babbo was sad and hurting. Peter immediately hugged Tony and refused to leave his side, attaching himself to his father like a limpet. Ulysses took over making dinner for them, a simple pasta carbonara that he knew Tony’s mother used to make him as a kid. Joe told Tony amusing stories about band practice which brought a smile to Tony’s face. The warm fuzziness in his chest and the overwhelming love Steve felt for his children at seeing how kind, how thoughtful and how compassionate they were being warm the dark recesses of his soul where grief still reside.
“I know I hurt you, Tony. But you deserve to know no matter how painful it was. It wouldn’t be right to lie to you and to lead you on. And the fact that it was Bucky that--- You’re the most important person in my life and even if after this you want nothing more to do with me, I will always be here for you.”
They were silent for awhile, a moment of silence in remembrance of a good man gone too soon. Neither of them seem to notice nor mind the fact that Steve was still holding one of Tony’s hands in his own.
“Steve! Steve! Steve!” the man ducked to avoid being hit by the paint brush projectiles, “If I wasn’t telling the truth, then how would I know that you’re an art teacher, and you go to the Hukilau Cafe every Saturday and you make waffle houses, and-and-and you like Stargazer lilies.” he continued, talking as fast as he could while Steve looked around for something to incapacitate the man.
“Well, I had a great time celebrating your birthday, Dad.” Steve hugged Joe, “happy birthday again, Dad. “Good night, Buck. See you guys in the morning.” He said as he climbed the stairs up to where his room was located.
Then Thor placed his index finger on his lips, in a gesture of silence and made a fist with the same hand and pounded his chest twice in a show of loyalty to Steve. The big man then turned, putting an unlit cigarette in his mouth and returned back inside the bar, leaving Steve alone with his thoughts. Great, it seemed not only Bucky, but Thor also thought that Steve was the murderer and both were willing to look the other way. It’s a damn miracle that any murder was ever solved if this was what happened on the daily.
The next day, Tony and Steve went down to the gym for a sparring session only to find Thor in lying down on the bench under the heaviest set of weight, looking as miserable as a kicked puppy.
They were silent for a moment as Tony laid his head on Steve’s shoulder, watching the band set up on their center stage.
Steve beamed, excited for a chance to create something special for his father. It’s been awhile since he worked on a mural. His go-to medium was paper and charcoal, and if he’s feeling melancholy some water color would be used. He reserved his oil paintings for paid commissions, and he hasn’t been getting those in awhile. “I won’t let you down. Hey, you should watch the Giants game while I’m painting,” Steve turned around surveying the white walls, already brainstorming possible scenes to paint.
“No, Tony. That’s what you want to believe. It’s what we all want to believe,” Dr. Erskine gestured to himself, Joe and Bucky, “but it’s never gonna happen.”
“I mean, I didn’t know it was going to end. Who’s to say that just because we’re going to different schools, our relationship wouldn’t work?” Ulysses asked shrilly, “no one knows that.”
“Man, I still can’t get over the fact that Thor feeds babies like a pro.” Sam remarked, his phone was up and pointing at the direction where Thor was gently bouncing Ulysses up and down as the baby sucked on the bottle. Tony’s pretty sure he was live streaming the whole thing.
“Certainly, Captain Rogers.” the lights in the room started to dim and Tony’s technologically advanced curtains started to shutter close in tandem, extinguishing any sunlight from their room. In the darkness, the atmosphere somehow became more intimate and Steve could almost forgot what had happened before.
Tony groaned and whined into Steve’s shoulder, “Too early.” Steve chuckled at him and rubbed his hands up and down Tony’s back. Tony made a pleased cooing sound and nuzzled closer to Steve, “Let’s go back to sleep. The kids won’t be awake for another few hours.”
As soon as Steve was out of earshot, Tony said, “JARVIS, prep the Hulk cage.” If Barnes would be here for an extended amount of time, some contingency plans need to be made.
The deafening silence from his siblings was so satisfying, he couldn’t help the smug little smile that he could feel was forming on his face. Anthony was looking at him with stars in his eyes at Steven’s proclamation, his acknowledgment of their status. He looked so beautiful, Steven couldn’t help but kiss him, just because.
The sculpture was a masterpiece. Made of white Italian marble it depicted all six Avengers in various fight poses against the Chitauri army. Tony was represented by the Iron Man, hands aloft, ready to fire the repulsor. Thor held Mjolnir in his hand, ready to strike down his foes. Bruce as the Hulk was depicted in mid-roar. He was covered in some of the Chitauri army but was successfully ripping them away from his body. Steve was in his Captain America uniform, shield displayed prominently in his hand and he was posed as if he was in the process of throwing his shield at an unseen enemy. Clint had an arrow lined up in his bow and was aiming it at an enemy and Natasha with her batons was beating down a Chitauri goon.
“How’d you convince the Crew to come back and play tonight? I thought they were on tour until next year.” Tony chuckled at his mate.
Amazingly, their parents, uncles and aunt still haven’t found out that Peter was the masked vigilante that had been occasionally helping them in their fights. That either said something about how good the boys were at keeping secrets or how oblivious the Avengers were. As Peter bent down to look at the new modifications and calculations Joe had made to his web fluid, Joe surreptitiously glanced at the boy that have plagued his thoughts from the moment he knew how it was to feel for someone.
“Are you kidding?” Peter rolled his eyes, “I think if Joe’s inner thoughts were ever broadcast it would go something like
‘I uh, I had a bee on me.” he explained, as he jumped into his convertible. Steve, who was also in the act of doing his own happy dance, stopped abruptly at the sight of Tony.
“The point is, you don’t have to do this just to impress us, Peter. The life of a superhero is a dangerous one. Don’t do this, unless it’s really something you want to do.” Papa told him.
Steve chuckled and pulled Tony closer until Tony was nestled up against him. He kissed Tony’s forehead and murmured, “Still obsessed on that, huh?”
“Head cracking, leg breaking, neck snapping, finger snipping. Things like that.” Pierce continued, “it’s possible they sent this guy.”
Steve leaned his head forlornly at the banister. He thought of his Dad and Bucky’s life. They sacrificed so much of their free time and their lives just to help Steve navigate his way through his memory impairment. He has become a burden on his father and his brother, and he’s not going to be a burden and ruin Tony’s life. Not on his watch. Steve knew this status quo couldn’t continue. The four of them couldn’t keep pretending like Steve was normal and that watching a video in the morning would fix everything. Steve knew what he needed to do, and it was something he should have done a long time ago.
“I’m sure you were, son.” Steve added, “she was a good girl and I know you cared about her and she cared about you too. But sometimes it takes more than fitting together to stay together.”
Steve gasped loudly and had to muffle the shout that was surely burgeoning from him. He squeezed Tony’s arm tight enough that he was sure there would be some bruising left on his arm but at the moment he couldn’t careless.
“I don’t know where you’ve been for the past eighteen years, babe, but this…” Tony gestured to his body, still muscled and toned even after all these years, “this is fine wine. Something to sip and savor, not to chug.” Tony chuckled and leaned up to nip at Steve’s lips. Steve deepened the kiss, opening up Tony’s mouth with coaxing lips and tongue. Tony reciprocated fervently, kissing Steve back with fervor. The kiss was warm, and sweet, a little wet, and perfect. They kissed for a long time, until Tony pulled back, his breath a gaspy sweet thing against Steve’s cheek. Tony smiled at him, the love in his eyes evident and unchanging. Steve counted his blessings every single day to have the chance to mate and spend the rest of his life with this beautiful and amazing omega.
“Me too,” Steve smiled softly. His eyes lingering at Tony’s feature. His fingers itch for a piece of paper and some charcoal so he can draw Tony’s likeness and keep it close wherever he went.
“Damn right, this is my domain,” Clint interjected, “I can’t believe you two have been fooling around here without my knowledge or consent.”
Ulysses wanted to go on the jungle gym that was installed on the park much to Tony’s immense relief. He climbed the slide and was having fun with the other kids playing there too. Tony and Joe went to sit on the bench nearby, keeping an eye on Ulysses. Joe seemed to be as hyped up as his older brother, his big blue eyes taking in the park scenery while he gnawed on Tony’s fingers. He’s been seeking for things to chew a lot these days, his teething days might be coming soon.
“Excuse me Sharon, but this napkin proves that Rumlow was sent to hurt my mate.” Steve interjected strongly, moving forward as if to shield Tony from Sharon’s accusations.
“Did you just Han Solo me? Really, Tony? Here I am, recovering from third degree burns and my own mate Han Solo’d me.”
It turned out that AIM wasn’t performing human experimentations after all. They saw other potential from Extremis, that was they saw the potential to turn their failures into success. If they couldn’t stabilize the Extremis serum then why not just let it destabilize and build a weapon based on what happened when Extremis broke down?
“Sorry to hear that, buddy,” Steve said in his best caring leader voice, which wasn’t hard to do since the man really did care for his family. He patted Thor’s back, Joe sitting on his lap, his baby blue eyes flickering back and forth from his father to his uncle, as if trying to keep up with the conversation, “I don’t know what else to tell you. I’m sorry I’m really bad at this whole relationship thing. The only person I’ve ever been with is Tony and well, you know how we are. We might scream and holler at each other until kingdom come, but I’d rather fight with him for every damn day of my life than live a life without him.”
“Lately whenever I talk to Jane, all we do is argue. We fight more than we talk to the point that I dread making a phone call to her because I know all we will do is argue. She’s coming here in two days for a conference and I can’t for the life of me be excited about that.” Thor looked up to them, his blue eyes stromy, “what should I do, friends? Is it time to end things?”
“I was taken aback. They found him in the men’s room.” Bruce answered. Steve and Tony exchanged a look. There was a dead body at their place, though thankfully it wasn’t one of their employees.
Tony was starting to wake up, his brow scrunching up adorably as his eyes started to flutter open. Steve felt him sigh against his chest, and Tony started caressing his chest, signaling Tony’s wakefulness.
“And you think I know where it is, don’t you Buck?” Steve concluded for him, halting them on their tracks.
Joe swore under his breath and told JARVIS to change the viscosity constant he was previously using, while Tony asked “Permission slip for what?” and tilting his head to the side trying to remember if Peter ever said anything about a permission slip.
“He’s half me. So that’s expected, Brucie.” Tony quipped. His eyes were starting to get heavy. Giving birth was more tiring than being in battle, who knew.
And what if Aunt Natasha was alive? Would she be comfortable with the way things are? Tony still funded research, hell, Tony himself was still doing research. JARVIS was a pinnacle of artificial intelligence. His self-learning and adaptive algorithm was unlike anything in the world, and if Tony wasn’t such a paranoid bastard, he would have included the full code when he submitted the manuscript for publication. He knew he was justifying his current works and his company’s works, but what else was he supposed to do? People depended on him. American service members depended on him, he couldn’t in good conscience let them use Hammer Industries weapons. That would be tantamount to manslaughter.
Steve and Tony were optimistic that they would make it to 20 weeks. Then they’d tell the rest of the family then six months later celebrate the birth of their new niece/nephew.
“See, Bruce and I haven’t been on a date night in awhile. Ever since Aurora was born, actually. So could you do us a big favor and watch over her for the night?” Thor pleaded with him.
“I wish Gamora has short term memory loss. That way she won’t remember that I called her father a narcissistic, loud mouthed drunk with a face that looked like J. Edgar Hoover’s ballsack.” Quill quipped from his position on the lanai.
“Trying to solve how to overcome the energy barrier needed to fuse two atoms together. If I can do it, then the arc reactor technology is basically complete.” Steve’s awestruck and amazed face would always be one of Tony’s expression he saw on Steve’s face. Other than his orgasm face of course. Steve looked so beautiful when he finally reaches completion.
“It’s okay, Bucky. Skin grafts are standard procedure on burn victims. And with Steve’s enhanced healing, he should have an even better prognosis than the usual patients.” Bruce reassured him.
“Rumlow could have hid back here and waited for the bar to be empty.” Steve deduced, as he and Tony entered the closet and surveyed the surroundings. Noticing a matchstick on the floor, Tony bent down to pick it up.
At the mention of a ring, Tony’s heart jolted painfully. What would Steve do or say if he knew that Tony already have such a ring completed and ready for him? Would Steve just threw it back at his face, breaking his heart and ruining their chance for happiness together, like what he’s doing now?
And it was Tony who was hugging him and stroking his hair gently, comfortingly, whispering soft encouraging words to him and apologizing for something that was not his fault. Steve hugged Tony closer, tighter, not finding the proper words to express the mess of emotions warring in his chest right now. But hoping, hoping against all hopes, that Tony knew he wasn’t to blame. No one was to blame. Only fate.
Steve fell to the ground as Thor used Mjolnir to flip over a taxi and send it flying to the Chitauri brigade that attacked them, ultimately incapacitating them. Steve tried to get up, using his shield to lift himself up but his legs gave up under him. Thor grabbed his arm and helped him back up.
Peter was the last piece of the puzzle, completing their family, making them stronger, sturdier, more connected to each other.
“I’m glad you’ve decided to get out of that business, Tony. If I may ask, what does your business do now?” Steve asked, his face open and honest.
“Tony, you know I have enhanced memory. I still remember what the stick looked like from two years ago for Ulysses.” Steve paused, taking in Tony’s disheveled appearance. His hair was mussed up like he had been running his fingers through his hair multiple times in frustration. Tony’s eyes were wide and full of emotion. He looked equal parts happy and terrified. Though right now, terrified seemed to be the dominating emotion.
Phil Coulson walked over to where one of his regulars was sitting at the bar. Loki Laufeyson was a bestselling murder mystery/thriller novelist but most days he could be found parked at the counter of
“Trump’s getting ready to pick a new Supreme Court justice since the previous one’s retiring. They just published a short-list of nominees”. Clint answered.
“Yeah, do you feel that?” Sam Wilson, aka DJ Falcon, walked up to the stage at the center of Sarah’s, clad in a white tuxedo and sunglasses. Trailing behind him were Tony and Nick Fury. Steve and Thor, who were already on the stage, discussing logistics and issues that occur from the brief closure of their bar was pulled out of their conversation by the arrival of the newcomer.
“Oh my God,” Papa sat down heavily on the couch next to Joe, he looked dumbfounded by the onslaught of information he and Peter were spilling to him.
“Well, aliens invade the city on a daily basis so I guess you being sorta kinda part spider isn’t that weird.” Jamie shrugged.
“Nonsense, Bruce. My appetite, and my whole day for that matter, would be ruined if I don’t get to consume these blueberry toaster strudels first thing in the morning.”
Joe smiled, “Sure, Peebee. You need anything? I’ll get you a cold compress, okay?” Joe said again, “Babbo’s not home. Auntie Pep kidnapped him to the factory in Long Island. Papa’s plane is landing soon. I’ll ask him to make his famous chicken noodle soup for you.”
Peter had patrol that afternoon, though he cut it short because he still wasn’t feeling too good after what happened yesterday. He arrived home that evening before the sun went down, expertly dropping down into his room and finding Joe lounging on his bed. He was on his phone texting, a dopey smile on his face which meant he saw texting Jamie. Peter rolled his eyes fondly. He was glad Jamie and Joe finally got his act together. Joe always acted like he didn’t need anyone and that it wasn’t bothering him to see the guy he liked dating other people. But Joe looked happy now, like a burden had been lifted off his shoulders and he could breathe and live easier.
“I do.” Barton spoke up for the first time. The man looked like he’d been through the wringer and his exhaustion wasn’t all physical. Steve couldn’t imagine the toll being mind controlled would have on someone, but Barton looked like he was itching for a fight despite his exhaustion.
It had been three months since Ulysses and Joe discovered Peter’s Spiderman alter ego. Peter had begged his older brothers to not say anything to their parents, insisting that this was something that he had to do, now that he has this awesome powers and abilities in his hands, it was his responsibility and his calling in life to use it to help people. His older brothers relented, persuaded by Peter’s heartfelt pleading. They did have two conditions though. First was that Peter would not hide any injuries that occurred during his nightly patrols even though it would heal with Peter’s enhanced healing. Their second condition was that Joe and Ulysses would be redesigning Peter’s costume and web shooters. They had been apoplectic once they realized that their baby brother was swinging through Manhattan in a ski mask, tights and subpar web fluid.
“We’re Hawkeye,” Tony rolled his eyes at the name, “I mean the name of the band is Hawkeye. No one’s actually named Hawkeye. It’s like there’s no one named Jethro in Jethro Tull, you know.” Clint started to ramble on.
” Tony asked him, getting out of the car to take Ulysses’ backpack and buckle him up in the carseat.
Tony laughed at Steve’s question, his hands caressing Steve’s face. “Of course, lover. As you were.”
It was a stressful day for everyone involved, and one that was not made better by what happened the next morning.
So they haven’t been alone for the past two months, which made having sex difficult. And a pregnant Tony has always been a horny Tony. Well, hornier than usual.
Tony grinned dopily, sated and happy were good looks on him. Steve resolved on making sure to put that sappy smile on his face everyday for the rest of his life. “You’re right. And not that I’m complaining but what brought this on? You were jumpier than a snapping turtle this morning and now you’re all Mr. Lovey Dovey.”
“Pierce told me that he works for HYDRA.” Tony told Steve as they drove back to the bar. Steve scoffed at the ridiculous notion, but Tony continued, “he told me something else too.”
Tony decided to rest for the night, he had a shareholders meeting in about four hours and he promised his newest PA, Pepper Potts, that he would actually show up this time. She was a ball buster, that Pepper Potts. She didn’t care for his shenanigans, and was able to get him to do what he was supposed to do approximately 60% of the time. She entered Tony’s life on a thunderous stampede of high heeled shoes and organized the chaos of his daily life and Tony’s own self into something that resembled a semi-functional human being. She was like a conquering general, all efficient maneuvers and brusque manner to get the job done. Tony expected nothing less from the granddaughter of a Howling Commando.
“No!” Ulysses cheerfully answered before Bucky could say anything, prompting a loud burst of shocked laughter from Tony and snickers and chuckles from everyone else. Steve rubbed his forehead, feeling a headache coming in.
Steve sighed, “Great. Just when I thought we could keep our hands clean…” the cost of doing business in New York was starting to be more than Steve was willing to bear. Maybe Tony had the right idea about moving West.
Growing up, Tony wasn’t exactly rolling in friends. As par for the course, being Howard Stark’s and heir to the leading weapons manufacturing company in the world, his friends were more acquaintances. Tony kept people at arms length, never fully trusting that they befriended him on purely altruistic reasons. Rhodey was actually the first friend he had. They had met at MIT when a drunk 14 year old Tony mistakenly entered Rhodey’s dorm room, thinking it was his room instead. From then on, it was the beginning of a beautiful friendship that lasted all the way through Rhodey’s commission to the Air Force and Tony’s life as celebrity playboy billionaire.
’. Sure I can mourn for what I’ve lost, what has passed before me, but you can’t turn back time. So, you look forward to the future. And this is my future. You and our baby boy.”
“Promise me, Tony. Promise me we’re not ever going to have anything to do with SeaWorld.” Steve impassionately told him, his fist still smarting from punching the coffee table, splitting it right down the middle. The boys were sleeping peacefully on his lap, undisturbed by the amount of crying and painful moaning their uncles were exhibiting.
” Tony frantically asked after Joe who had his nose buried in an astrophysics journal and was eager to escape him towards the lobby.
“.38 right? Matches the murder weapon.” Steve observed as he stood next to Tony who was peering into the speaker, looking at the gun.
“The top contenders are said to be federal judges Anna Corrine Barnett of Pennsylvania, Tyrone Banks of New Hampshire, and Raymond Rutledge of Michigan. President Trump will reportedly choose his nominee…”
“No worries, Big guy. I’ll just stay here with my babies and my Brucie boo, eating leftover casserole, Russian lactation soup and day drinking like the smarter and better looking versions of Kathie Lee and Hoda.”
Pouring himself a cup of freshly brewed coffee, courtesy of Steve, Tony walked over to the couch and sat next to Clint, deciding he might as well take a break from coding and inventing for awhile. Plus, if he stayed topside for a little bit he’ll be able to see Steve coming in from his morning run, sweaty and delectable with his shirt clinging to his torso. Yeah, he’ll stay awhile, Tony thinks.
“I’m glad you’re happy, Steve. For the longest time, as far as I can remember, there was always sadness and guilt in you. When Sarah died, when I first died. But you’re happy now, Stevie. I’m glad.”
“Fuck you, asshole. I saved my paychecks to buy your laudanum and this is how you repay me?” Bucky retched into the toilet bowl again, Natasha at his side holding hair back and rubbing his back.
“Tony, please,” Steve was aware he was begging, but he didn’t care. This wasn’t fair, they’d just meet each other again.
“Captain America, perhaps not. But Steve Rogers is just an Alpha madly in love with his Omega and would do anything to get back in his good graces.”
“And that’s how we feel about you, big guy. You’re never a burden to us. We’re here for you. I’m here for you. And the boys are here for you. They’ve missed you so much, Steve.”
Tony’s eyes scanned the food on the counter. So the food wasn’t making him nauseous, but something was. As his eyes landed on the boba in Natasha’s drink, that lightheadedness he usually associated with motion sickness came back. Tony quickly averted his eyes away from it, and his gaze landed on the fruit bowl, specifically on the oranges. When he saw them, he started heaving.
Steve placed a plate filled with eggs, bacon and pancakes in front of Tony, “Eat, Tony. Your last meal was at lunch yesterday.”
Tony called out to Peter, who was busy taking pictures, and without waiting for Peter’s answer pulled him aside and started slathering the sunscreen on Peter’s face, much to Peter’s consternation and whining “
They all went inside to check in and get settled in their rooms then went out for lunch at a local place where food trucks seemed to congregate, serving a variety of dishes from Thai food to poke. For all their celebrity status and the fact they were all used to eating fine dining from going to various charity galas and dinners, they still preferred eating street food any day of the week. With the combined appetites of Steve, Thor, Bucky and Ulysses, they ended up spending most of the afternoon at the food court, eating some trucks out of business, much to the vendor’s delight. Before leaving they graciously posed for pictures with the other customers and the food truck vendors who were more than happy to have an anecdote about that time the Avengers stopped by and ate their food.
“Night. Love you, Stevie.” Bucky said. Once Steve disappeared up the stairs, Bucky and Joe turned to each other and sighed. The real work has just began.
“Well, Phil’s cello was very romantic and it made me feel horny,” Clint started. Coulson started to blush, urging his new boyfriend to skip all the gory details, “Whoa! I think we should just skip ahead.”
Tony looked away from the holograph to him so fast, his neck hurt from whiplash. “What? No, I’m not! Am I?”
But right now Steve was taking care of Joe, and that ain’t the way it’s supposed to be. Joe realized that the time for grieving is over. He would always miss Sarah, and she might be gone, but a piece of her lived on in Steve. Joe still had Steve. And he always would until the day he died.
As Clint pronounced them bonded for life and they shared another kiss to seal their vows to each other, Tony thought that this was what paradise must have felt like.
“Wouldn’t miss it for the world, Steve.” Bruce said, “congratulations, guys.” he placed the bunny on the nightstand by Tony’s bed.
Steve cleaned him up, carried him to bed when he had too much to drink. The kid practically run the whole household in Sarah’s stead. Instead of staying at the UH dorms like the other student athletes, he chose to live off-campus with Joe and make the early morning commutes to Manoa for football practice and classes. Joe, deep in the bottles and on extended leave from the Marines, didn’t notice until on one of his sober days, he went to the kitchen to find Steve cooking breakfast.
“You think one of us is the killer?” Phil Coulson, the bartender, asked from the back of the booth. Sharon spared him a glance, putting her hands on her hips in answer to the rhetorical question that was posed.
, Steve. See ya,” As they both walked to their respective vehicles, both men couldn’t help but catch their breaths over the events of the morning. Both felt as if they’ve finally met the right partner, someone they delight to know better, and eventually someone to spend their lives with.
“What’s up, Big Guy? Want some lunch?” Tony greeted him, sitting down on the couch leaving room in the middle for Steve to sit between him and Thor.
“It’s the shaved head, babe.” Tony told him, “Ever since the accident and they shaved all of your hair off, the resemblance is starting to be more noticeable than usual.”
Three days later, they finally let Tony and Ulysses leave the hospital. Thank Hawking, because it was getting boring just sitting around in bed, resorting to tapping away on the tablet or watch terrible daytime TV, in between changing Ulysses’ diapers and breastfeeding him. On the one hand, Steve seemed to be the one enjoying his stay at the hospital. The man was starting to get into General Hospital and the Wendy Williams show, for god’s sakes.
Steve looked up in alarm at JARVIS’ words. What had happened that JARVIS seemed reluctant to even tell him?
“Aloha, honey. How are you doing today? What can I get for you?” a matronly older woman approached him with a carafe of coffee.
“Please, I would never invent something plebeian like a potato gun,” Joe retorted back, “when I was your age, I already made my first telescope.”
“It’s Alexander Pierce.”  Pierce’s voice, instead of Fury, came on the line. The couple, taken aback by the unexpected voice.
“Well I think she likes you. You should ask her out sometimes,” Steve said. He reached over picking a couple plump green grapes Joe bought at the market.
“You don’t know that, Bruce. What if-- what if this was the one thing the serum can’t fix? You saw him earlier. He--” Tony gasped, “oh God, please Bruce, I have to get out of here. I have to be with him, please. Even if it’s just at the observation room, I have to be there, please.” Tony pleaded again with his friend, “he’s my life.”
“Okay you got me there,” Tony took a sip of his Kona coffee. After all this time, it still amazed him how he managed to live without having Kona coffee everyday. Now if he were to fly back to New York, he’d probably turn his nose up at the stuff they tried to pass off as coffee over there.
“God, you’re such a troll,” Tony shook his head exasperatedly, “Nobody would believe me if I ever told them what a little shit Captain America is.”
“Well if we didn’t do it, then why do we need a lawyer?” Natasha Romanov, the bar’s hostess asked, “Unless one of us did do it?” she tilted her head sideways.
“Tony! Goddamnit!” Steve yelled after him as Tony vanished from view. “Any of you know how to fly one of those planes?”
Just as he felt Hypnos’ pull towards slumber, a shrill ringing noise rang across their room jolting him back to wakefulness. Tony jerked awake at the sound and groggily opened his eyes, “Whuzzat? Jarbis, whaz goin on?” he slurred out, yawning the whole time.
“Shut up, asshole.” Tony covered Ulysses’ ears as he swore at Clint, “Steve and I haven’t been sexually active ever since this one starts teething.” he motioned down at Ulysses who seemed to be enraptured with the conversation taking place, moving his head in the direction of whoever’s talking. “Crying babies are the opposite of an aphrodisiac.”
Steve thought as he tightened his hold around Anthony’s waist, keeping the man secure in his arms as Groot flew downward towards the floating island.
“I almost like it better when you guys were still staring at each other from across your lockers,” Aaron said from behind Peter, “they’re gonna be insufferable like this, trust me.”
“Alright, peeps and company, let’s get this show on the road,” Tony said. He was seated on a chair situated to Pepper’s left. She shared the chaise lounger with Natasha, dressed in an ivory dress. Steve was standing behind Tony, looking handsome in a three piece Tom Ford suit that Tony bought him for the occasion, carrying Ulysses in his arms. Standing next to Steve was Thor, smiling jovially with one of his big hands on Bruce’s shoulder.
“Why couldn’t I have met him one day before his accident?” Tony lamented wistfully. He took a long gulp of his own drink.
And hey, Tony told himself, they’re not war profiteers. They only arm one side of the conflict, not both. That wasn’t how they did business, that’s the line in the sand they didn’t cross.
Tony stared silently at Steve, taking in his words and accepting that Steve never meant to hurt him with his revelations. “I know, Steve. I know why you did it. And even though I’m angry and upset at you, this is a necessary evil.” Tony took a deep breath, bracing himself for what he would say next, “It will take some time for me to get used to this. I will still help you find Barnes, but don’t expect me to forgive him so easily. Don’t expect me to welcome him with open arms when you do find him and bring him back. I can’t. I can’t forgive him just yet.”
Point is, he was smart. He could look at anything in the world, dissect and analyze it to bits and if it’s broken, he could fix it. If it’s not broken, then hell, he would improve the shit out of it until it couldn’t be broken anymore. But for all his genius and his intelligence, he still didn’t understand why the United States didn’t have a federal policy for paid parental leave. Tony was proud of the fact that Stark Industries was one of the few companies that offered paid maternity
“Just this morning I thought I would end up as lunch in that beast’s belly. But now, here I am, riding a flying horse with the most handsome man I’ve ever seen in my life. I’m either dead or unconscious right now.” Anthony kept laughing even as he tightened his hold around Steven’s impressively trim waist considering how wide the breadth of his shoulders were. And, oh my, are those
“That’s the plan.” Steve smiled at Tony, relishing in how peaceful Tony looked with their newest son in his arms. He knew how scared Tony had been with this pregnancy, how much he blamed himself, irrationally so, for Joe being born premature and the spectre of health problems that followed the boy early on in his life. There were sleepless nights where he and Tony would stay awake in the nursery, gazing at their baby boy, relieved that he was here with them despite everything.
“Hey, don’t blame yourself, it’s not your fault.” Jamie placed his hand on his shoulder and Joe reflexively leaned back into the warm and comforting presence of the boy, “You knew this could have happened, that’s the reason why you lo-jacked Peter, wasn’t it? You saved him, Joe. He would have been there for hours if it weren’t for you.”
“Okay, help me understand why we’re naming our kid after a novel?” Tony asked again, guiding them to sit on the couch on the far end of the workshop.
“Yeah. How could I forget, Tony…The moment I was so close to killing the demon from your past, but you won’t let me.”
Natasha sighed and lifted Ulysses out of his playpen to carry him, “Then why are you moping down here, instead of being down there with Steve?”
Tony found his way to Steve’s side where he stood by the stove cooking up another batch of pancakes for his family. “Morning, handsome.” he tilted his face up for a kiss which Steve obligingly gave to him.
After Clint’s revelation, Tony went back to his office to grab his stuff before heading home to prepare for the night. As he walked into his office, he noticed a lump on his couch which turned out to be Bruce, laying face up on the couch.
Ulysses James Stark Rogers came in to the world on Saint Patrick’s Day, further cementing his reputation as the most Irish baby ever irished in New York City. The entire week Tony had been experiencing contractions that he brushed off as Braxton-Hicks contractions and declined a trip to the hospital, despite Steve’s insistence. Steve went to mass that morning, silently despairing the fact that in this era the Feast of Saint Patrick was more synonymous with copious alcohol consumption than a religious celebration of Ireland’s patron saint. Oh well, he was pretty sure Bucky would be happy with this type of observance than the usual trip to church to attend mass.
by James Joyce. When it first came out as a serial novel, it was banned and later censored in the US because of the sexual contents and later, Joyce’s literary style that sharply diverged from the conventions made the book controversial. Steve had been lucky enough to found a copy of the complete novel in a bombed out library they were taking refuge in when he was stationed in Europe along with the Howling Commandos. He read the book from cover to cover under HYDRA bombardment, laughing like a loon at the high and low brow humor Joyce liberally peppered his writing with, and becoming solemn and introspective at passages in which Leopold Bloom contemplated his life and his unfaithful mate. The vivid and descriptive languages Joyce used was fascinating to Steve. As an artist, he always had a good imagination. Reading
The floating island of Delos was the way the name implied. It floated above the sea, hidden amongst the clouds, free and unanchored from the confines of earth. Mythologically, it was the birthplace of Artemis and Apollo, chosen so because Hera, in her jealousy of Leto’s pregnancy by Zeus, tricked the lands of Greece to shun her, so she was unable to give birth in any island in Greece. Then Leto found the floating island of Delos, unanchored and unmoored from the ocean, thus not considered land, and was able to stay and gave birth to the twin Gods there. For this reason, the island of Delos has always been a sacred place for Apollo and Artemis in addition to Apollo’s temple in Delphi. Anthony didn’t think Delos actually existed, mind you. But after meeting Steven and Groot, he was prepared to change his whole perception on almost anything he thought about the Gods.
“No, that’s not the real reason.” Nat countered, following him to the dialysis machine “I think you’re afraid of commitment. Let me guess, your college girlfriend cheated on you with an older guy?”
The sound of Sam choking on his laughter drown out Tony’s sobs. “Oh my God, this is fucking amazing!”
“No.” Tony started to say, then seeming to come to a decision he reiterated, “Yes. Steve, I’m not young anymore. I’m not at an age where I should be getting pregnant. We dodged a bullet with Ulysses. What if-- what if it doesn’t work out?”
Thank you everyone who have read and gave kudos to this work. I'm a new writer and your feedback means a lot to me :)
“This means I can lord everything over Bruce,” Tony cackled hilariously, “now he has to do what I say no matter how “dangerous” or “unstable” the reaction might be. I’m a Nobel laureate, bitch.”
Anthony cocked his head to the side and squinted his eyes at Steven, his expression concerned, “So, it’s a ‘no’?” he started to move out of Steven’s embrace, putting a distance between them.
” Joe replied, fingers tapping at the StarkPad in his lap. Peter had asked him for his input on his spider web formula. It’s a fascinating project to be sure, but Joe was finding it hard to concentrate. Now that Peter pointed it out to him, the weight of those violet eyes on him, so rarely seen on a person, made Joe hyper aware of everything around him.
“Hmm, I don’t generally endorse manipulation by the Fates or anyone else, but if the end result is meeting you, I’m finding it hard to be upset by such blatant display of manipulation.” Anthony said, directing his smile at Steven. Seeing his beautiful and happy face, Steven was finding it hard to be too upset. If one thing in that chain of events that lead to him meeting Anthony was missed, he wouldn’t have been here. He wouldn’t have a chance of meeting this wonderful man, holding him in his arms and if Anthony would still have him, marry him and bind themselves to each other for the rest of their days.
“Do I?” Tony grinned impishly. God, Steve loved to see him happy and carefree like this. Tony seemed to glow in the yellow fluorescent light of the restaurant. And sure, Steve knew that the whole pregnancy glow thing was just an old wives’ tale, but right here and now glowing was the only way to describe how beautiful his mate looked right now. Steve was so overcome by all the love, affection and devotion he felt for this omega. He reached for Tony’s hand and pressed a reverent kiss to the knuckles of his left hand, right where his mating band lie.
“I think it’s the hair. And the general aura of awe and admiration we all feel whenever we’re near Steve. We generally feel the opposite of admiration and awe if we’re anywhere near the other one.”
“Oh, I know Jamie. Good football player, but I don’t know if he’s good enough for you, Jujubee.” Ulysses looked pensive on the screen, while Joe just exasperatedly facepalmed as he felt a headache coming on.
“What? You gettin’ sleepy?” Steve snarked back. His stomach was killing him, he was ready for this to be over.
“Don’t worry about it, Tony. It’s Steve. With Natasha and Clint, at that.” Thor tried to reassure him. The drum set looked comically small in his hands. It was a wonder the thing hasn’t been smashed to pieces by now. “They’re as indestructible as an infinity stone. They’ll be fine.”
Tony started to nod, but then remembered that old adage of communication being key to a healthy relationship. And much as he loathed to talk about his insecurities, if he couldn’t be open and honest with his mate, who else could he be that way with?
The pain was so great that Tony had to sit down on the floor just to pull himself together. Soon, he started to feel the dreaded sensation he hoped would never come: a trickle of wet tendrils in his inner thighs and Tony knew what had happened.
“I don’t own a cell phone. Big Brother’ll always know where you are if you got a cell phone.” he answered. Next to Steve, Tony rolled his eyes at Pierce’s paranoia.
Steve woke up a few hours later. That Hawaiian sun was shining brightly by now, and though Steve couldn’t say what time it was, it was most likely later than his usual schedule. He would have to wake up soon if he still wanted to get in some morning run before he went out for breakfast to have enough time to go pineapple picking this afternoon up North.
“Hey, come here.” Steve pulled Tony aside by his waist, letting the hotel employees finish unloading their bags. They stood to the side, Steve rubbed his hands up and down Tony’s back in a comforting gesture and leaned his forehead close to Tony’s, “what’s the matter, huh? The kids are fine. Everyone’s fine. We turned around and got Bucky and Ulysses back.”
So yes, Steve could deal with Tony’s aversion of spherical objects. It wasn’t that big of a deal. Steve was getting good at getting rid or concealing spherical shaped objects from their shared living space. Except when those objects were attached to his person.
“That’s just unfortunate of her,” Tony said, “it’s her loss, then, because we’re a group of kickass people, not to mention fly as hell. We’re what people these days called ‘family goals’, amirite?” Tony continued, “‘sides, you don’t wanna be stuck dating a vegan anyway. It’s depressing as hell.”
“Yes, it’s very cool.” The soldier grinned happily and took out his instant camera out of his jacket pocket and gave it to the soldier sitting in the front seat. “I don't want to see this on your MySpace page.” Tony told him. The soldier then put up a peace sign as he leaned in for a picture with Tony. “Please, no gang signs.” The young man looked crestfallen at Tony’s words, “No, throw it up. I'm kidding. Yeah, peace. I love peace. I'd be out of a job with peace.”
“Well, it’s talk like that that makes me sure just how proud we are of you.” Babbo said again, smiling at Peter, “But from now on, you update us on what’s going on with your double life as Spiderman. I see that suit you’re wearing to swing around town and I gotta tell you, kid, you’re giving me a heart attack. You and me are redesigning that suit
He was aware later on of Papa coming in to his room, stroking his head and murmuring some words. Irish words, Peter thought. Peter didn’t know what they meant but the way Papa said it elicited such warmth in Peter. Peter felt Papa kissed his forehead, Papa’s scent enveloping him and fell back to sleep. Then he felt Babbo, crooning the lullaby he always sang to them when they were little and swapping the now-warm cloth on Peter’s forehead with a colder one. Peter felt Babbo settled in next to him, curling around him and Peter snuggled closer to his Babbo. Minutes later, he smelled Papa’s scent in his room again. Peter knew from experience that his parents would be spending the night camped out in his room, they always did so every time he or any of his siblings were sick. Peter relaxed into his bed and fell back asleep, comforted by the knowledge that his parents were here with him, protecting him and comforting him.
Tony smiled to himself and thought of what Steve and the boys’ reactions would be. They would be ecstatic to say the least. Their family was getting a new addition. After Morgan and Aurora’s births a couple of year back, there hasn’t been any new addition to the family. This would be an unexpected, yet greatly welcomed surprise for their family.
“Let your Babbo know where I went, will you? Thanks, guys.” Steve clapped Ulysses on the back and placed a kiss on Peter’s forehead before heading out.
Steve rolled his eyes at Tony’s words, “The old one did it justice just fine, Tony. You couldn’t stop looking at them even when you were pissed at me when we first met.”
They had been going to the lobby from their room, taking the elevator and apparently arguing about how Bruce thought Thor enjoyed the Big Guy’s company better than his own, which devolved to Bruce saying Thor was more attracted to the Big Guy than to him, at which point they stepped out of the elevator, leaving behind their baby, still in her stroller, at the elevator.
Steve just hugged him instead of answering, clutching Tony’s body closer to him and peppering sweet kisses on Tony’s laughing face, “Thank you, thank you, thank you, Tony. God, you’re amazing!”
Peter had just taken his mask off when his bedroom door opened and his parents walked in, oblivious to what waited for them on the other side.
“Why did you say that, Tony?” Steve fixed him with a piercing look, his blue eyes were a hurricane of emotions. Sadness, pain, grief, and dare Tony say hope, which confused him to no end, “Why?”
Joe was still coughing in his arms but his breathing seemed to go back to normal, still hitching periodically. That was a close call, Steve closed his eyes in relief. They almost lost Joe and all because he was too preoccupied with his own plans. Steve hugged his son closer, pressing a kiss to his hair.
“That’s my Papa!” Ulysses proudly proclaimed to the crowd, before Tony could prevent him from blurting it out. The gathered people clearly thought Ulysses was joking, though, and just laughed at him, dismissing his claims as a joke.
“Of course I don’t mean Thor. You don’t stand a chance with Thor. I meant our esteemed bartender Phil Coulson.” Loki gestured to where Phil was stocking the liquor cabinet at the far side of the counter. Clint followed his line of sight, taking in the sight of Phil. He had always admired the older man, but knew he would have better chance at shacking up with Thor than with him. But maybe Loki was right. Time to seize the moment. Just then, a new person joined them at the bar. The man was dressed immaculately in a grey three piece suit, his medium length blond hair was slicked back and tied in a pony tail. It was Aldrich Killian, coming to once again making an offer on the bar.
“Official visit,” Detective Carter spoke again, “See the badge?” she said, waiving the badge in Steve’s face.
“Ugh, what’s with the ‘Doctor’ thing? I don’t have a medical license.” Tony retorted back. “It’s just Mr. Stark. Who are you and what do you want?”
“Okay, okay, I’m at a hackathon! The midterms were too easy, it’s boring. I need something to distract myself with. These people can’t code their way out of a wet paper bag sober, and they’re supposedly here to study computer science.”
“Powerpuff save the day!” Ulysses started running around the kitchen, arms held aloft like Superman. His parents laughed at his antics and let him run around for awhile until Steve caught him in during one of his rounds and deposited him back on the chair, Ulysses laughing and squirming the whole time.
“Don’t go, okay, Steve? Please, don’t go.” Tony muttered to his chest, he sounded so small and unsure of himself. It pained Steve to see him in such obvious distress.
Once Ulysses was satisfied enough with playing at the park and tired out, Tony ushered him back to the minivan, buckled him up and drove back to the Tower. Since it was time for his afternoon snack, Tony gave Ulysses a bag of Goldfish crackers for him to munch on. On their way home, Tony started to hear cooing sounds from the backseat and saw that Ulysses was trying to share his afternoon snack with his little brother.
Joe cooed from his high chair next to his work desk, the banana puree Tony gave him as his morning snack smeared all over his face. Joe seemed to not mind the mess though, he was having fun after Tony gave him free reign with the spoon while he did a bit of coding for the new StarkPhone operating system. Tony grinned at the adorable sight of his baby, banana mush covering his chubby cheeks.
“You’re ridiculous,” Steve rolled his eyes fondly. The light in her eyes was back which Steve was grateful for. Lately he’d been noticing how easily her moods shifted, one second happy then the next some words or some gesture would take away from her playful countenance. He tried to talk to her about it, but Natasha just shook her head and kissed him softly, whispering softly that everything was fine, yes everything was fine. It pained Steve to see her so troubled, even more so when it was trouble he couldn’t punch in its face or knock down with his shield.
“Okay, okay, Tony. Settle down, sweetheart, settle down,” Steve placate him, gently pulling Tony to him, wrapping him up in an embrace.
So they were all going to Maui and would be there for two weeks. Tony (or rather his PA Joshua) had booked them at the Four Seasons at Wailea. Everyone who had kids were getting a residential suite. Sam and Clint both insisted on getting an oceanview room, while Bucky and Natasha didn’t much care for the oceanview, just as long as they had rooms far enough from the rest of them so they could do unspeakable things to each other. Everyone shuddered at the thought of what they did behind closed doors. If it was anything like the way they fought, it was acrobatic, to say the least.
Steve laughed then scooped Ulysses up with his other arm, so now he has two boys, one in each arm and kissed Ulysses’ cheek then Joe’s. The boy giggled then kissed his little brother's cheek much to Joe’s delight.
When he got home, Clint, Thor and Sam were in the middle of throwing a party in the penthouse common room. They managed to obtain green beers and judging by the mugs around the room, they had been at it for awhile. And it’s not even 12 PM yet…
Clint just looked blankly at him. One of his eyebrows quirked up, questioning Tony’s assertion and making him doubt himself. Tony hated how well-versed he was becoming in interpreting Clint’s eyebrow movements.
“You got hurt on the mission, my love. AIM made a new type of bomb and you were caught up in the blast.”
Ulysses, their oldest son, was seventeen years old now. He was smart as a tack, clearly taking after Tony, and determined, for lack of a better word, just like Steve. He was a perfect combination of them both. He was intelligent, but rarely did he leveraged that fact over his peers. At school, he was class president, captain of the football and debate teams and all-around good guy. Ulysses was a born leader, charismatic and charming to a tee, just like Tony was. He was well-known within his cohort, popular for his kindness, his intelligence and since this was high school, for being a handsome Alpha. Ulysses never lacked admirers, betas and omegas alike flocked to him but he was always respectful of them, not really interested in the playboy lifestyle Tony used to enjoy before meeting Steve. Ulysses was also very close to his little brothers and protective of them. He took his role as the oldest with great gravity and saw his role as the protector and the first line of defense for his little brothers against bullies who thought they could get away his bullying Ulysses Rogers’ little brothers just because they were small and nerdy.
“Wow, you are as heartless as they say you are,” Sharon remarked. Tony stopped short at Sharon’s words.
“Our family.” Steve whispered. Tony hummed in answer, watching their family cooed and made funny noises at their sleeping baby. Bruce seemed uncertain with what to do, his hands were folded behind his back, though his expression was affectionate and fond. Sam was cooing at his son and Thor had the brightest smile on his face. His blue eyes seemed to be shining with happiness and awe, a big thumb softly caressing Ulysses’ cheek as he muttered something that sounded foreign to Tony and Steve’s ears. Something Asgardian perhaps? They’d have to ask him about that later. Clint was crowding Natasha, asking her for a chance to hold Ulysses himself. By the look Natasha shot him, it’d be awhile before the redhead would be willing to part with her nephew.
“I do want to do this, Papa. I have to. For some reason, I got this-- this power in me. The power to do something good, something that can make people’s lives better. And if bad things happen on my watch because I choose not to do anything about it when I can, then it’s on me. So I want to do this, Papa, Babbo. I want to help people.”
“He looks like a lot of guys I serve at the bar, man. I’m wondering though, is that his real hair? ‘Cause from it looked like a comb over from far away.” Clint asked the detectives.
Joe snickered from beside him and Peter shot him an annoyed look, “No, Babbo. I told you, they recently allowed a section of their R&D floor to be accessible to the public. They’re going to be doing a 3D tissue printing demo for us. It’s cool!”
Thor chuckled, and Tony congratulated himself on a job well done, “You’re right, Tony. Besides being a vegan doesn’t make sense. Why would you purposefully deprive yourself of the joy that is meat?”
Joe plagued his every thought. Their brief interactions throughout the years only seem to solidify Jamie’s affection for him, made him crave Joe more, made him want to know him better. Jamie knew he couldn’t go on like this forever, hiding his feelings and admiring the most wonderful Omega he might ever know in his whole life from afar, missing his chance because of his cowardice. Jamie decided then that he should take a chance, it was now or never. Aaron was right, what was the worst that could happen?
“What indeed.” Anthony replied. “I’ve always had the same thoughts, I just never voiced them. They punished my father for committing hubris, but aren’t they also committing hubris by claiming that nobody can be more than them? Nobody can be more beautiful or more intelligent or composed better music than them? Then what would be the point of a human’s life? To continuously submit and worship them? That’s not a way to live.”
“What!” Jamie could feel the back of his neck starting to heat up, “lead with that, you asshole! Is he-- is he still looking this way? Yeah, the Sabbath shirt looks good on him, but I kinda like the Tool shirts better.” Jamie rubbed the back of his neck subconsciously, his eyes taking on that dreamy look on them again.
Each one of Peter’s family members were, as Director Fury put it nicely, people with “remarkable talents who came together to become something more”.
“I’m moving out, Buck. I’m gonna live at the Institute. I already arranged it with Dr. Erskine.” Steve calmly took another bite of his roast beef. It was his turn to cook tonight, and to placate his dad and Bucky he decided to make something that everyone liked.
“Sirs, Masters Ulysses, Joe and Peter have arrived from school. They’re inquiring as to your whereabouts.” JARVIS interrupted the comfortable silence they’ve immersed themselves in.
Pepper cried when they told her. She knew Tony better than he knew himself, and as such she always knew that for all Tony’s bluster about not needing anyone in his life, she knew that having a family to call his own was Tony’s deepest wish and desires. She hugged them both, and told Tony that under no circumstance should he be working overtime in the workshop and pointedly looked at Steve to make sure he understood and followed her mandate. Steve, for all that he was an Alpha supersoldier, wasn’t immune to the patented Potts stare down and reassured her that Tony would be keeping a more regular sleeping hour.
“Why would the murderer hide the gun in your stuff?” Bruce asked. He placed the gun back in the speaker.
Tony’s mate was more calm facing down a hoard of Chitauri army descending on Manhattan. His panicked expression and dilated pupils indication of an adrenaline rush coursing through his veins at the moment. As second in command of the Avengers, Tony needed to take charge of the situation.
“No. It was Natasha.” Now, Steve couldn’t hold back his surprise, he had to take his eyes off the road to look directly at his mate, mouth gaping the whole time.
“You’re the father of his child, Tony. He had a chance to go after Barnes last year, but he stayed so he could be with you.”
Brianna rolled her eyes, and started walking around again but not before taking a picture of the drawing with her camera. Ellie made a mental note to ask Brianna for a copy of the picture later. The picture she took might not capture the whole glory as well as Brianna’s high powered camera.
“Tony, dude. You dropped your coffee.” Clint said, gesturing at the floor. But Tony remained motionless, and upon closer inspection his face was white as sheet. His brown eyes were open wide, but unseeing. It’s as if he was seeing something that only Tony could see. The hand that was still holding the StarkPad was trembling minutely and cold sweat started to appear at his temple.
“I don’t think that matters to him. I mean, Captain America and the Winter Soldier were like us. They were regular blue collar working guys from Brooklyn. Surely he would have taught his kids better than that. It’d be kind of hypocritical to forget where you came from, right?”
“I don’t know why you kids make such a big deal about that. Isn’t it nice to have proof that your parents still love each other?” Thor asked, “Loki and I walked in on my parents lots of times. We were the better for it.”
“Tony, you smell different.” Steve whispered, pressing his nose into Tony’s neck and leaving small chaste kisses on his mate’s neck.
“Guys, guys, guys,” Tony held up his hand, trying to placate them, “I’m fine. Just a little bit of a scare back there. I’m okay, now. And yes, I’m pregnant. Again. And we didn’t tell you because we haven’t passed the first trimester yet, okay?”
“According to all six of the pregnancy tests I peed on, yes we are definitely pregnant. One of them even spelled out the word “pregnant” on the thing as if there could be a possibility of someone being vaguely pregnant. Or halfway between pregnant and not.”
Forty-two. That meant Tony had made forty-two whole new suits since Steve left ten days ago. That’s...troubling.
On the video screen, Ulysses ducked his head in happiness, a small smile spreading across his face, feeling the warmth of affection in his Papa's words. Joe might have teared up a bit there listening to Papa's speech, but damn it always felt good to know just how unconditional your parents' love was.
Steve rolled his eyes at the two of them, standing back up and walking over to Tony. “I’ll be back soon. Don’t blow anything up while I’m away.” He kissed Tony and caressed his stomach, the bump was barely visible under the loose Iron Maiden shirt Tony was wearing.
“As you wish.” Steve swept him up in a bridal carry and carried him all the way to their bed where they cuddled and did other things until they both fell asleep.
Steve carried a case of liquor inside to further replenish the bar’s stocks. As he walked in, he saw Maria carrying her signature Tower of Wings and placing on the side of the counter where Loki was currently sitting with Clint. Across from the counter, he saw Tony with his back turned to him, talking with Killian, once again. Sighing in annoyance at the sight of his mate talking to the unsavory Alpha, Steve roughly opened the beer case and started taking out the bottles one by one.
“As your lawyer, I must advise you. If Mr. Wilson lodges a suit the outcome is not assured in our favor.” Nick said again.
“I tell you, that kid could have gone to the moon and back and Steve would never even know he left.” Joe remarked once Tony was out of their sights.
“Ah! Steve! Oh baby, that feels so good,” he gasped. Tony’s lips were red and swollen, his eyes taking on that glassy and hazy gaze he would always get when in the throes of arousal. Steve continued stroking his mate, relishing in the thought of bringing pleasure to his Omega. Steve could also feel his cock starting to harden and leak at the sight of his mate clearly enjoying himself. Tony’s moans prompted Steve to move his hands lower to the opening behind Tony’s penis. Steve inserted one finger, relishing in how wet Tony already was. Tony moaned as Steve insert his finger, canting his hips forward in an effort to get Steve to insert his finger deeper into him.
Steven privately thought that Anthony’s father was right when he asserted that his son was more beautiful than the Nereids, but wisely kept that thought to himself. “But you were trying to escape from the chains earlier when I first saw you. I’m guessing you have a plan to kill the monster?”
“Steve…” God, Tony loved him. Tony didn’t deserve him, but by Hawking did Tony loved him. Which is why the next words that comes out of his mouth would be the hardest things he would ever say.
“Hi, sweetheart. Good to see you up and moving. Are you feeling better today?” Papa enveloped him in a hug which Peter readily returned, resting his head on Papa’s chest. He had missed his Papa while he was away, though it was only for a few days. Another peculiar thing happened as he hugged Papa. It was no secret that when they were little, the boys loved to hear the sound of their parents’ heart beats. Often times they would fall asleep to its soothing rhythm. As far as Peter knew, he was the only one of his siblings who would still sought out Papa or Babbo’s heart beats, Joe and Ulysses have both grown out of it. But today, the soothing beats of Papa’s heart morphed into a thunderous one, one that Peter could hear miles away, even without laying his head down on Papa’s chest and Peter flinched away from the hug as the loud sound assaulted his suddenly sensitive eardrums.
“Anthony, please don’t take my silence as rejection. I’m just trying to...to think of the best response to your proposal.” Steven finally said, his tone reassuring to the prince still in his arms. Anthony’s hands moved from its place around Steven’s neck to his chest. Steven’s words seemed to assuage him for the Prince’s face regained its mischievous countenance from previously. Anthony’s smile was so bright and infectious that Steven was helpless not to return it with a smile of his own.
“Okay, to be fair, that first one was more of a scare. Nothing bad happened, and I carried the baby to term.”
“Not gonna disagree with that.” Tony said and picked up the chicken feet and started devouring it. After a moment, he felt Steve nudged his feet and tilted his head towards where Rhodey was slowly oscillating Ulysses’ bassinet back and forth to lull the baby to sleep. The couple exchanged few meaningful glances in silent communication before Tony cleared his throat to get Rhodey’s attention.
“Tony, stop trying to climb the stool, and just sit on the couch. You’re scaring me.” Steve chastised him, his hand was pressed to the small of Tony’s back helping him up to the stool.
“No, Babbo, of course not. I trust you and Papa both. I wanted to tell you, but later. Much, much later when I’ve already established a name for myself, a reputation so to speak. I was gonna tell you when--” Peter trailed off, unsure of how his parents would react to what he would say.
Three months into his Pepper-enforced hiatus, he got bored laying low in Malibu. He was itching to go out and to have some form of human interaction but the humans of Los Angeles were insipid, vapid and conceited human beings who cared only for their outer looks. Taking the jet to Las Vegas would also be a no-no since he promised Rhodey that he wouldn’t be spending what amounts to someone’s 401k in one craps table. Also he was still banned from Caesar’s Palace and Bellagio for counting cards at Blackjack.
“I’m sorry, honey. I wish we had more time.” Tony flew further and further up towards the portal as Steve and the rest of the Avengers watched from the ground, helpless and useless as they watched one of their own sacrificed himself to the cause. Steve fought the overwhelming urge to scream and cry and rage at everything around him because this wasn’t fair. He and Tony had just met and now Steve would lose him again. Steve was forced to let him go, yet again.
Bucky’s heart stuttered at that. Steve had named his firstborn after him. Damn, that’s enough to bring tears to a hardened assassin’s heart.
Two months later, an A0 size picture of the family was hung over the penthouse’s fireplace where it would remain for years to come.
Sharon shrugged, “Why not? If they break up, then I’ll finally be able to get a crack at your brother.”
Steve smiled at Tony indulgently, “Kids are growin’ up, Tony. They can take care of themselves. God forbid they start keeping track of their stuff by themselves,”
Outside, he saw two people standing beyond his door: his brother Bucky Barnes and a woman he assumed was Bucky’s partner at the NYPD, Detective Sharon Carter.
Tony chuckled softly, “That’s not why.” and he left it at that for Steve to piece all the information together. There was a moment of silence where Tony lifted his head up from its place on Steve’s shoulder, gazing at his mate’s face. Steve looked flabbergasted, mouth gaping open, but his blue eyes were shining with happiness and elation.
So, regret over something he had done as a notorious playboy wasn’t something Tony felt very profoundly in his life. At least not until today.
“He’s not slowing down,” Thor observed, then the God of Thunder started swinging Mjolnir around, preparing for flight. Before he could, however, the Hulk jumped out of nowhere, snagging Iron Man mid fall and crashed onto a building which the Hulk promptly destroyed by sliding down to the ground. As he reached the ground, the Hulk threw Iron Man on the ground and Steve and Thor ran to him. Impatiently, Steve tore off the helmet, needing to see Tony’s face. Several alarms sounded in his head as he saw the brilliant blue light on Tony’s chest was off. Tony, vivacious, full of life, mischievous Tony, always had the blue light on his chest keeping him alive, keeping the shrapnels away from his heart.
So I imagined the statue at the Avengers Tower lobby to look like the marble statue at the end credits of Avengers: Age of Ultron. Because the end credit was the bomb yo
Sure he was pretty smart. Any child of Tony Stark wasn’t capable of being dumb. Uncle Bruce praised his mad chemistry skillz and told him numerous times that he wouldn’t have been able to complete a project or make an experiment work without Peter’s inputs and suggestions. And Peter had to agree with Uncle Bruce on that. The man won a Nobel Prize, okay? Peter wasn’t gonna say no to a compliment for him. Babbo and Joe would always ask him to work with them on any biochem related projects, the latest of which their attempts to further stabilize and deweaponize Extremis which the three of them finally achieved (team work! yay!). His parents, siblings, aunts and uncles all knew their calling in life. Maybe it was by virtue of his age, but Peter was still searching for that one thing that could help him become “something more”.
“Turn around,” Steve sighed despondently, resigned at this point to any and everything going wrong during the vacation.
Tony curled in towards Steve in their bed, loathed as he was to be away from Steve, his sole source for comfort, and Steve seemed to share that sentiment. He hugged Tony close to his body, warm strong arms resting on Tony’s waist and his lower back, massaging the throbbing pain that was still present. Tony pressed his face closer to Steve’s neck, inhaling the deep masculine scent of his Alpha and feeling a wave of comfort wash over him at the gesture.
“I was afraid you’d reject me. I was afraid...you didn’t want me anymore. Not like this...” Tony finished lamely, gesturing to himself.
“Clint, sit up when you’re eating. You’re spilling milk all over your shirt, dumbass. You’re gonna end up choking on your own vomit.” Tony said, alerting Clint of his presence.
“He looks like both of you,” Rhodey said as he peered into the bassinet, where Ulysses was laying down, sleeping the day away after feeding. “He has your hair, Tones. That messy, curly, rambunctious hair. But I bet when he grow up, he’s gonna have Steve’s aww shucks smile down pat.”
“Me? I’m just the messenger.” Pierce said. Steve scoffed at the obvious ploy to lowball himself, “I don’t know how you got Bucky to believe that crap, but I know you’re nobody’s messenger.”
“We’re going up there this weekend to ground you, so be ready,” Tony said to his oldest son, his tone grouchy but the smile on his face belied that.
“Hey,” Tony greeted, standing up and walking towards the door, signalling JARVIS to unlock the door, “What brings your royal handsomeness here?”
“I want this bar because I know how to turn into a gold mine,” he started, both Clint and Loki looking disparagingly at him.
The next couple of hours was a blur. He remembered being reluctant to relinquish Tony to the EMTs, until he felt Natasha placed her hand on his arms and gently urged him to “let him go, Steve. They’re going to help him, Steve. But you need to let go first.” He remembered riding in the ambulance with them, holding Tony’s slack hand in his own, praying fervently for Tony to be safe, for the baby to be safe, for everything to turn out alright. He remembered waiting alone, lost in his own thoughts and all the possible ways everything could end badly, and feeling scared like he never felt before --not even when he was certain he was going to die on the Valkyrie-- because if anything happened to Tony, Steve didn't know what he was going to do. Tony was his life, his whole universe, his soul’s mate, his reason for being and to have that light taken away from him would be a fate worse than death.
“Merry Christmas, Natasha,” Steve murmured softly. It had been a great day with he and the rest of the Commandos miraculously getting a 24-hour leave just in time for Christmas. And who better to celebrate this one day of freedom with than with his love?
“Aaaaaahhhh! What the hell! What just happened! Steve!” Tony exclaimed, amber eyes wide open in shock. And Steve, well, Steve was helpless to do anything else but smile indulgently down at him, hugging Tony, armor and all, to his body. He was so happy and grateful that they got another chance to be together. “Did you finally kiss me?” Tony asked innocently.
“Hmm, I guess,” Ulysses conceded. He seemed comforted by his parents’ and uncle’s advice. “I’ll be okay. Just had to process everything.”
It’s a miracle that he had been able to hide these episodes from Steve. He had always sleep better when Steve was with him. Making love with Steve was a mind blowing, passionate, love-fest that always left Tony boneless and sated to the point where he would fall into a dreamless sleep. If they didn’t have some fun before falling asleep, he would always be comforted by Steve’s arms around him, or by wrapping himself around Steve like an insanely codependent octopus. That’s usually enough to keep the nightmares at bay. Having Steve’s presence permeated his every sense did wonders for Tony’s trauma.
They only noticed when they got to the lobby and there was a distinct lack of blond haired blue eyed baby and promptly panicked, ran back to the elevator but when they got there the baby was not in the elevator anymore.
“Just one of my many hidden talents,” Tony shrugged, smiling deprecatingly. He stood up to place Ulysses back in the crib for the night. “Good night, baby boy. I love you.” he whispered to the sleeping infant.
Tony sighed. He didn’t want to get into it in Ulysses’ nursery. That would scar the child for life, regardless of whether or not he would remember any of this once he grew up. “Not here.” he said, then walked out of the nursery to their room right across the hall.
Along with Clint came Natasha Romanov, who also worked at the Aquarium. Natasha was a red-haired Russian woman, beautiful and took shit from no man. Tony tried to proposition her once, and it ended with Natasha threatening to castrate him and threw him in the shark cage. And Tony only need to be told “No” once.
“Shall we?” Ulysses said, holding his elbow out for Tony to wound his arm around. His other hand was holding Steve’s who was arm in arm with Peter, Joe at Ulysses’ other side. And together they walked down the aisle to where Clint was officiating their mating ceremony.
“You just don’t like it because it has better efficiency than the one you made.” Peter stuck out his tongue at his brother.
Joe might be the spitting image of “pre-serum Papa” as Babbo put it once, but that was where the resemblance ended. While Joe might have inherited some of Papa’s shyness and self-deprecating tendencies, there was no doubt that Babbo was who he took after the most. Joe excelled in robotics, engineering, quantum science, artificial intelligence, whatever Babbo taught him Joe took to it like duck to water. He had even taught himself medicine to cure Uncle Clint’s deafness. While Ulysses’ fans were of the cheerleader, preps and cool kids varieties, Joe’s admirers encompassed the nerds and geeks of Midtown high. As co-captain of the Decathlon team, Joe was basically the end all be all of Midtown High’s nerd community. It’s unspoken, but everyone in the family knew that Joe would eventually succeed Babbo, though in what capacity he would be in was still undecided. Uly had made it clear that he had no interest in running the company in any capacity. He was more interested in expanding what the Maria Stark and September Foundations were doing, increasing their non-profit charity works and funding even more projects in the future. Peter was pretty sure that the combined powers of Uly and Joe were going to change the world for the better.
Anthony was still in his arms and he was starting to fidget slightly. His previously happy and eager countenance started to take on a hesitant mien, his eyes flitting from side to side, likely assuming Steven’s silence as rejection. Anthony started to withdraw his arms from Steven’s neck and he couldn’t have that. Steven tightened his hold around Anthony, hugging the man closer to him, unwilling to be parted.
Steve accepted the polaroid and tilted it to show the picture to Tony, still nestled in the crook of his neck. Clint managed to take a picture that somehow incorporated the natural light from the sun spilling inside the penthouse living room from the floor-to-ceiling glass windows, making the picture looked like it was professionally taken, and not a candid one. In the picture, Tony was resting his head on Steve’s shoulder, his eyes steadfastly on Ulysses, who was sleeping soundly in Steve’s arms. Steve himself was smiling down fondly at Tony, happiness evident in his face. This was the first time he ever saw the three of them together, and Steve felt a flood of love and affection so great for his family. “Thanks, Clint. It’s a really good picture.”
They fought together like they’ve been doing it all their lives. Anticipating each other’s moves and complementing each other’s attacks. Tony seemed to know instinctively when and where Steve would be throwing his shield and would have corralled the Chitauri goons there for Steve to demolish. And Steve would know where Tony was aiming his repulsor blast and would be ready to use his shield to deflect the beam and smoke the bastards in an instant just with the combined power of the two of them. All in all, it was the best team up that Steve could only dreamed of. He finally had someone who had his back, and his front too, supporting at every step of the way on the battlefield and off. And he would do the same for Tony. Their relationship wouldn’t be limited to their day to day lives. It would be all encompassing, wholesome, perfect and unheard of. Battle partners and life partners. They’d be stronger together.
Steve embraced him, letting Tony rest his weary head on his firm, comforting chest. “It’s okay. Like Dr. Rosenberg said, we caught it early. Now we know the risks and what to do to prevent it. And don’t tell me you’re not already working on an algorithm to allow JARVIS to constantly surveil the baby’s heart rate.”
“That’s the six million dollar question right there.” Tony said, taking a sip from his tumbler. What, indeed, would he do? Stop going to the diner so he doesn’t have to see Steve? Pros: heartbreak and rejection avoided. Cons: not seeing Steve. Not seeing his smile, or hear his laughter or see him furrow his brow in that really cute way of his when Tony told him an inappropriate joke. Or would he go to the diner, do what Clint and Quill suggested, ensnare Steve under false pretenses, have fun with him for a day then leave him at the end, no commitments, no strings attached. Pros: Seeing Steve again, even without Steve remembering that one amazing morning they shared. Cons: unethically taking advantage of a trauma patient.
“We all have our roles to play here. Mine is to care about my bar and my employees because I’m a business owner, and yours is to care about the victim and solving the crime because you’re a crime solver.” Tony shrugged.
There was a clattering sound from behind him, which was strange because nobody should be in his room unless U figured out a way to escape from Babbo’s workshop again. Sighing, Peter turned around to fetch U and escorted him back to the lab when he staggered mid-step as he saw Joe lounging on Peter’s bed,
Steve just hugged Tony closer to him, smiling in amusement and kissed his forehead softly. His family was crazy, but at the end of the day, it was his and he couldn’t wait for their family to grow bigger.
“How nice of that man to give me a CD of music that would remind me of all the wonderful times I shared with his son…” he said sarcastically, “What an ASSHOLE!”
Honestly, Clint actually found himself suggesting different food pairings to Tony and if Steve was away on a short term mission, accompanying the genius on his jaunts to obscure food carts around the city when the cravings hit. It worked out well for both of them. Clint got to post viral snapchats of a pregnant Tony Stark demolishing a Halal Guys gyro platter and Tony got his gyro platter and an excuse to yell at him without actually going through with the various threats to do bodily harm to Clint’s person. Win-win solution.
“I told you it was a bad idea,” he muttered to Bruce who was consoling Thor, who was trying to hold back his tears so he didn’t appear weak in front of Bruce.
“It’s not your fault, you know,” Tony started, “it’s nobody’s fault but whoever detonated the bomb. Steve wouldn’t want you to blame yourselves. Let it go.”
“Just that when I woke up this morning, this was not how I pictured my day would go,” Tony smiled deprecatingly, “finally getting the guy of my dreams, finding out my parents were actually murdered by a HYDRA assassin who happened to be my guy’s brainwashed friend from back in the day. I feel like my life just became something out of a Lifetime movie.”
“Hi,” Jamie greeted him after he settled in his seat, a tray of food containing his usual lunch picks of toasted ravioli, marinara sauce, an apple and water was placed in front of him, “Lunch?”
“Yeah, well maybe I’m just one of those people who are meant to be alone, Nat.” Natasha thought he looked melancholic for a beat. This is the Tony she sometimes saw a glimpse of when he was playing with Lila and Cooper, or babysitting Nate. Tony wasn’t meant to be alone. Before meeting him in person, all she knew about Tony was limited to what she read in the gossip magazines. The genius, playboy, billionaire who charmed the pants off everyone. The genius inventor who succeeded in every field he dabbled in. One of the richest man in the world who could have anything he could dream of. It was only after getting better acquainted with Tony that she realized what a big heart the genius had. Clint’s story about Tony paying for his and the kid’s lunches when they first met was interesting enough. Natasha knew that Tony has paid off Clint’s mortgages and contributed heavily to the kids’ education savings, without Clint’s knowledge. His new SI subsidiary, Stark Resilient, provided prosthetics and life-saving medical devices to hospitals in Hawai’i at a heavily subsidized pricing, and was made free for all veterans. He invested heavily in the protection of Hawai’i’s beaches and education, and was driven to make Hawai’i the first state to run solely on renewable energy because he knew that tourism was not the only thing Hawai’i could offer to the world and to its citizens.
Phil reached into his pocket for his cellphone. He started to unlock the phone to pull up the picture of the dead guy that Maria sent to the
DUM-E chirped happily when he saw Steve entered the workshop. He pointed at Tony’s sleeping form with his claw, eagerly showing off his accomplishment in successfully covering Tony with a blanket without setting anything on fire.
“I heard you the first time, Buck. Find it, get rid of it, burn it--whatever. The only problem is, I didn’t kill the guy. Pierce said you’re in HYDRA’s pocket. Did he send this man?”
In the dream, Tony saw himself at some kind of fair. People were milling about around him. It was night, but the fluorescent lights strewn about at the fair lend an artificial sense of brightness, obscuring the fact that the sun had set long ago. Tony was not alone in his dreams, there was another man walking next to him, they were talking and enjoying each other’s company. It was such a novelty for him because for once in his life, Tony was the one who towered over the man. His features were obscured in his dream, but Tony could see that the man wore a suit. It looked baggy on him since he was a skinny man, but for some reason it made him looked so precious in Tony’s eyes. In the back of his mind, Tony felt like he was abandoning his main purpose for being at this fair in the first place, but couldn’t find it in himself to care at all. He had never enjoyed another person’s company as much as he enjoyed this man’s, and that was something new for him.
Steve shrugged, “Why should I be surprised? You’re one of the most brilliant scientific minds on the planet. Frankly, I’m more surprised they haven’t called sooner.”
“Why are you doing this?” Tony walked away from Steve, he couldn’t believe his day was taking such a drastic turn after that amazing scientific breakthrough and a surprise visit from Steve.
In hindsight, Peter should have known that his sudden reversal of myopia, super strength and huge increase in appetite was a harbinger of something more to come. Now, he discovered the hard way that he could stick to things. Walls, floors, ceiling and on one momentous occasion, the side of Avengers Tower. Additionally, he now had something resembling a sixth sense, except he couldn’t see dead people, just that he had a feeling whenever something bad would happen. On more than one occasion he knew something bad was going to happen even before the Avengers alarm sounded off.
Rhodey laughed again, “I can do that.” he looked down again at the baby soundly sleeping in the baby crib, his godson now. “I thought you were going to ask one of the others to be his godfather. I mean, you already named him after me.”
Joseph Carbonell Stark Rogers was born on a rainy Monday morning on Veteran’s Day, affirming Steve and Tony’s decision to name him after the man whose sacrifice they were honoring on the day World War I ended one hundred years ago.
“I can’t do this. I’m sorry, guys. I have to go…” Tony scrambled to sit up and left the booth. Throwing a couple of bills on the table enough to cover the tips and if Clint and Quill decided to stay longer. As he left, he managed to caught a snatch of the song’s last verse.
“And one of my godfathers is an alien too, so it’s just another Wednesday in the Rogers household.” They laughed for a bit before Peter solemnly said, “Thanks, Jamie, for keeping my secret. You’re a good guy, I guess now I see why Joe is so head over heels for you.” Peter clapped his hands in front of his mouth the moment he realized what just came out of it, eyes wide with the realization that he just blabbed his big brother’s deepest secrets to the one person who was never supposed to know about it.
“Thanks, Steve. Okay, sweetheart, you’re going to hang out with Uncle Steve for a bit, okay?” Bruce told his daughter, eliciting a gummy smile from the baby.
Tony saw Natasha in the kitchen, already seated on one of the stools on the counter sipping on her morning tea, “Are you seeing this disaster?” Tony asked her.
“I love you, Tony, so much,” Steve murmured, blue eyes shining with love and affection that even after eighteen years, Tony was still in awe that all of that was for him, “thank you for making my dreams come true.”
“It’s not just that we found each other, you know? Although that’s an amazing, life-altering event on its own, but I also-- I experienced things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can, Steve. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, so much. I'm the luckiest man on Earth. But, Steve, I can't sleep. You go to bed or go on a mission and I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.” Tony paused, catching his breath. His amber eyes wild with undisguised emotions, not all of them good. He looked scared, like he’d seen a ghost, “But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without and that's you. My suits, they're uh...they’re an extension of me. And building them, working on them makes me feel better. Makes me feel like I’m doing something to protect you.”
‘Do right by him?’ Peter mouthed silently. Jamie was a bit old fashioned it seemed. Kinda like Papa. “I’m sure you will.” Peter finally said.
More sobbing. “I just-- I just can’t believe they replaced the great and talented Billy Mays with this hack! Don’t they have any respect for his memories!”
Steve found Tony sitting towards the back of the bar, commandeering a table with a tall glass of tonic and lime in front of him. As he approached his mate, Steve felt a sense of contentment washing over him. Steve knew in his guts that Tony wouldn’t have done what Bucky seemed so certain of. He and Tony were a solid couple, two parts of a whole. And while they may have their disagreements and differences of opinions, Steve believed with a fervor of a religious man that he and Tony were meant for each other.  And he knew Tony would never even think of jeopardizing their relationship.
“What’s that, little one?” Thor’s voice drew their attention. He had put the empty bottle down on the counter and was holding Ulysses up to his face. He looked excited, “did you say something?”
They made quick work of Peter’s suit, Joe noting that it was to be relegated to the incinerator. They saw that the wound originated from Peter’s side, most likely a graze from a bullet or a knife swipe. It was already healing though, Jamie watching in awe as he saw Peter’s skin slowly knit itself back, his blood clotting at an amazing rate to stopper the wound. Joe gingerly prodded the back of his little brother’s head, trying to feel for a head injury.
“Yes, me too. All joking aside, congratulations, Tony. We’re all very excited about the new arrival.”
Tony’s eyes snapped open and he looked at her bright green eyes. There was happiness there, but also an understated sadness that came from knowing she would never experience what Tony had. During the course of Tony’s pregnancy, he and Natasha had unexpectedly bonded. While he and Clint bonded over weird cravings and food combinations, he and Natasha shared an affinity for designer clothing. Natasha needed clothes, more than any of them because even though she was an Alpha she was also a woman. And as a woman she was subjected to the double standard that paparazzi and the media placed on a woman no matter what her standing. Every single thing she wore or didn’t wear became a subject of scrutiny.
“My mate is concerned about your gang ties,” Tony added, trying his best to placate Steve and Falcon, “which is not you, but
“And we’re wearing it around the house now? Should I start wearing my armor instead of civvies around the house too?” Steve asked, dropping down on the couch to sit next to Tony.
. You just have to be patient. In the meantime, keep your head up.” Steve tapped Ulysses’ chin in encouragement.
A week later, Tony had a working prototype of a particle accelerator in his house. The Kahala mansion was just a shell of a house by now. Metal coils protrude from walls, spiraling from Tony’s basement, upwards towards the ground floor and the second floor. Based on his calculations, it would be sufficient to accelerate one hydrogen particle and one helium particle. The modifications he included within the accelerator should be sufficient to prevent an uncontrolled chain reaction and allowing for exothermic energy to be harvested for power source. This miniaturized particle accelerator would be sufficient to perform proof-of-concept experiment to be scaled up later on.
“Pep, relax. We’re all still dressed from the Baptism. I’m sure we can bear wearing monkey suits  for another two minutes or however many long this photo shoot is gonna take.” Tony tried to placate her, “everyone looks amazing, and we’re all good looking enough not to look too shabby even with the wrong outfits.”
“The name of our son.” the OBGYN had confirmed that they were expecting a son earlier this month, “We should name our son Ulysses.”
“As you wish.” Steve leaned down to give Tony a more thorough good morning kiss but a strange accented voice over the PA system stopped him.
“Uh…” Peter wracked his brain desperately to come up with excuses, anything to take the heat off him. His eyes flickered back and forth looking for inspiration when his eyes caught on the flashing light of Joe’s phone indicating a new message received by the phone.
It was amazing getting to know each other. Joe learned that Jamie was Brooklyn born and bred. An  only child, his father was a firefighter and his mother was a nurse. He was a bit perplexed at first, since Jamie’s life history read just like Papa’s. He thought Jamie taking the piss out of him until the boy shyly admitted that it was all true and that all his life he has looked up to Steve Rogers. Both he and the Captain came from similar working class backgrounds, yet the Captain showed that despite their limitations, or rather
“Oi! don’t knock on the prosthetics! This thing is a piece of art, okay. It has pneumatic sensors, amazing neural connection that lets me feel the things I touch and makes me look jacked as hell. Check this out.” Bucky flexed his metal arm, willing Steve to feel the smoothness of the metal.
When he got to the mansion, the sight that greeted him was peculiar to say the least. There was a giant stuffed pink bunny wearing a Captain America costume on the front yard. Around its neck was a heart shaped pendant that proclaimed ‘Merry Christmas Steve’. Steve gingerly parked his motorcycle next to one of Tony’s numerous Audis and dismounted, looking at the giant stuffed animal in amusement.
” he murmured and stroked Peter’s hair, in that special Babbo way that always lull Peter to sleep no matter what, “I’m sorry Papa and I haven’t been around much. These missions keep coming one after the other.”
“Hmm,” Tony hummed and planting his face on Steve’s chest, relishing in the warmth of Steve’s emanating, “it’s okay. We missed you, but you’re back now.”
Just then, as if noticing something in his periphery Steve looked up from his sketchbook towards the ocean, then turned his head in Tony’s direction, his eyes landing on Tony. He gave Tony a small smile, one that Tony was powerless not to reciprocate, then turned his attention back to the sketchbook in his hold. A small smile that Steve reserved for strangers, that was all Tony deserved. That was that, Tony thought, that’s all I am. A stranger.
“So, fellas, I’m very satisfied with what I’m seeing so far. Tony’s blood pressure is under control, and it looks like the fetal heart rate is doing well. A bit slower than we normally expect but it is within normal range. So now, we’re at the point where we can start to tell what the sex is. Would you like to know?”
A low murmur of disagreement roll through the doe eyed people standing in front of him. “Good, Because all of y’all are suspects.” he declared succinctly. Just then, Detective Carter and a crew of coroners came out of the restroom wheeling out the dead body of their murder victim. Nick moved out of the way to let them pass through the middle of the bar, and as they passed the victims hand slipped through the gurney and remained hanging off the side of it as it was being wheeled out. Thor, Jarvis and Clint watched from the sideline as the covered dead body pass by them. Natasha scrunched up her nose in disgust at the sight, while Maria watched placidly from her perch on the bar stool.
