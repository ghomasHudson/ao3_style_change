- and handed Dean his drinks. Their fingers brushed, and the waiter glanced down towards Dean's rolling gut once more. He didn't look away this time, and when Dean cleared his throat, he practically had to pry his eyes away. Oh, Dean could have some fun with this guy.
As Cas worked at Dean's bloated belly, he heard a suspicious-sounding clank. He looked up to see Dean smiling guiltily, ice cream spoon raised halfway to his mouth, and Cas sighed again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel tentatively stabbed a small bite of his apple pie and raised it to his mouth, eyeing it as if it might jump off the fork and bite him. His Mother and Father had always told him that gluttony - added sugars, processed foods, and eating for pleasure - was a path that led straight to Hell, and Cas really had no desire to go to Hell. "Dean, I'm really not sure-"
Just as Sam's eyes widened in understanding, Dean figured out the solution to his problem. After all, the table was pretty low - weirdly low, actually, seemed to be a bit of a design flaw - and his belly was pretty maneuverable. Before Sam could flag down a waiter and get them seated somewhere else, Dean sat down sideways on his side of the booth, belly hanging out to the side as his ass and love handles shoved against the table. He spread his legs to give his gut some room, groaning when it dropped between his thighs.
When Dean got home, he stripped off the shape wear and lounged in his underwear in front of his TV, ordered a large pizza and bread sticks, and proceeded to eat everything while watching some shitty rom-com he’d stumbled across. He didn’t even notice how much he’d eaten until it was gone, but oh god, an alien had to be inside of him, because Dean felt like he was gonna burst. Dean moaned. This was
Prompt from Does It Matt3r over on Dreamwidth: "Since you put that you have no weight limit, I want you to write a fic with Dean being the biggest you've ever written! I'd prefer not astronomically obese, but definitely immobile with descriptions, please! :D And have the pairing be either Dean/Cas or Dean/Benny! I love both and thank you!"
Castiel put a supportive hand on his lower back as he made his slow way to the locker room, attempting to soothe the aches brought on by the bouncing his belly had been subjected to. His back was usually a little sore after a day of lugging around his gut, but this was different, more acute, and Cas was seriously worried that he'd pulled something.
Castiel giggled, because the nurse definitely hadn't said anything about that last point, but nodded anyway. He drifted off shortly after and was woken up by Dean's light prodding, because he'd brought Cas dinner in bed, a dinner completely comprised of dessert foods, because he was amazing. Cas said as much as he stuffed a cookie in his mouth and moaned.
Dean ended up making way too much, as he'd just used the first recipe he found without looking at how many it made, and he definitely had enough meat for five sandwiches. Shit. But Dean Winchester wasn't a quitter, and he didn't feel like packing away the leftovers, so he shoveled down five sloppy joes while leaning over the kitchen counter, sauce dripping down his wrist. He was full to bursting and panting like a dog by the end, but he finished it all.
what he should be doing, especially since he was trying to lose weight.
“Um, Dean Winchester. I’m a senior, just moved here,” the guy said, grasping Cas’s hand, and Cas noticed that he was blushing a bit too. The cute boy - Dean - opened his mouth to say something else, but the coach blew his whistle loudly and the other boys jogged over to the pitcher’s mound. He shrugged apologetically and turned to join them, and Cas almost had a heart attack; if he thought the view from the front was good, the view from the back was even better.
True to his word, Dean picked up the next donut and took a big bite. “Ew can tuff,” he said around the mouthful, rolling his eyes when Cas clearly did not understand. He swallowed. “You can touch. I’m not a fuckin’ art show, and I’d pay good money for a belly rub right about now.”
Once they'd finished dessert, they somehow ended up making out, Dean still in his chair while Benny tried his best to sit in his lap. Dean didn't have much of a lap anymore, so Benny mostly ended up straddling Dean's belly with his thighs, but whatever.
“Only for dinner,” Sam said dismissively. “My sister has them tomorrow. Three work for you?”
So here they were, eight years later. They both had civilian jobs - Dean as a plumber and handyman, Cas as an online tutor - and consulted for hunters far and wide, and although Dean had planned on hunting a little, the truth was that he hadn’t been on a hunt in three years. They were frequently visited by family and friends and the occasional Jehovah’s Witness, and life was good.
Or he’d thought it had been fair, but, well. Dean had been struggling with his jeans for a little while now, and they’d been leaving deep red marks in his skin, but he’d figured his weight would level out, so he hadn’t bothered buying new ones; after all, he’d just bought these a few months ago. Today, his pants seemed to have a different idea.
“You know,” he wheezed, “maybe I’d be able to feed myself if
This was what Cas thought about as he studied his and Dean's blurry reflections in the glass front door of the Winchester home. Their matching uniform pants were slung low under their chubby bellies, Dean's untucked shirt clinging nicely to his gut while Cas's tucked one strained to stay closed, little patches of milky skin visible between the lower buttons, his significantly pudgier love handles bulging out over his curvy hips. He was definitely bigger than Dean now, that was for sure, and Cas was confused as a rush of heat went through him at the realization.
Either he was too full or too lazy to lean forward and get it himself. Whatever the reason, Cas eagerly handed Dean his next (and last, damn, already?) treat, and it was gone in seconds, the only evidence of its existence an apple core and the sticky caramel on Dean’s bottom lip. He licked his lips and rested his hands over Cas’s, right on top of his massive middle. It sat like a boulder in his lap, heavy and hard, and Castiel would have been worried for the child inside if the doctors hadn’t already reassured them that Dean’s weight shouldn’t cause any difficulties, that a more than healthy appetite was not a problem. Still, it had to be hurting
Dean grunted, but the light blush on his cheeks gave away his embarrassment. He moved Cas’s hand to the apex of his gut, an open invitation, and Castiel began to rub in earnest, bringing his other hand up to help. Cas had large hands, but they looked tiny against his omega’s hulking middle.
snowing, so they'd admitted defeat. Dean took the opportunity to pamper Cas again, and Cas spent all day in bed watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer and dozing off whenever the mood struck. His boyfriend joined him for most of the day, only leaving to bring food back from the cafeteria, and when the following day - a Friday - was called off as well, they spent their time similarly.
He had to have gained at least a hundred pounds. No part of Cas was recognizable any more except for his face, and even that looked different, chubby cheeks and double chin hiding a previously angular facial structure. His hips, which had always been the skinniest part of him, were curvy and soft, almost like a woman's, and he actually had an ass now. Thick rolls hung where his flat stomach used to be, chunky arms were forced away from his body by generous love handles, and fat thighs ground against each other. And he'd stuffed himself in the cafeteria before changing, so he looked even bigger than normal, and this outfit left nothing to the imagination.
I... may have taken some liberties with the prompt, but the premise is basically the same! Just several years AFTER s13 instead of during.
"Dean," Sam whispered, "what the hell are you doing? I'll just get us a different table-"
Set eight years after Dean and Cas have (more or less) retired from hunting. Chubby!Dean, fat!Cas (because chubby doesn’t really cover it in this case).
Once Dean was settled, Cas left to hunt around the many, many food stands for a satisfactory meal. He got three bacon cheeseburgers, a bucket of chili cheese fries, and, of course, a funnel cake. There weren’t exactly a lot a health food options, so he just grabbed a smoothie and a deep-fried ear of corn and called it a day. He’d have to go on a second run anyways, as Dean could pack away a lot more than this.
The first time Dean ate at Devilish Delights, he knew it would become his new favorite place. He'd heard about it from his friend Victor, a cop who swore by the new bakery's donuts, and Dean, food-lover extraordinaire, visited at the first possible opportunity. One bite into their 'vampire muffin' - red velvet with molten chocolate on the inside - and Dean was hooked. He proceeded to order one of everything they had, eat all of it in-store in one of their booths (the tables weren't bolted down, thank god), then got a dozen donuts to go. Which he promptly ate in the parking lot.
Dean licked his lips and reached towards the cookies before Cas had even sat down. He was at the point in his meal where he needed to lean back in his seat, give his belly some space, so he placed the baskets on his gut and went to town. The oreos were quickly demolished, and Dean only paused only to give Castiel a quick and dirty kiss - payment for his services, he supposed - before he did the same with the chicken.
Finally,
Shirt undone, Dean reached behind himself and tugged at the fiddly little hooks, pulling and sucking in until finally,
Cain chose that moment to come back onto the porch, which was probably for the best. Not in the least because he came bearing gifts, an uncorked bottle of champagne and two glasses in one hand, a giant platter of chocolate-covered strawberries in the other. He was also gloriously unclothed, stripped down to his silk boxers. Dean’s mouth watered at the sight of both his food and his boyfriend.
do something about all the UST - it’s driving the rest of us crazy.”
“One, be nicer to yourself,” Sam chided. “And two, I’m not a lady, if you haven’t noticed, and I think your extra weight is extremely attractive. I mean, you weren’t exactly bad-looking before, but...” He squeezed Dean’s love handle, and Dean shied away.
"I don't know about this," Cas said warily, poking at the piece of pie with his fork. "Mother says that-"
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmm?” Cas said, still caught up in the sheer size of his body.
“Mm.” Sam continued to stare, and Dean cleared his throat. “Sorry, sorry. You’re just so- actually, it’s fine. On a different note, you want a shopping buddy tomorrow? It’s probably time for a wardrobe change.”
"That was- that was pretty good for your first time, Cas," he breathed, still picturing how his lips had wrapped around the glass.
"It's three in the morning."
“Plenty comfortable here,” Dean said around a yawn, but he didn’t protest when he felt Cain shifting him onto his lap. He was full enough that this would have been impossible on land, but the weightlessness of the water let Cain manhandle his significantly larger significant other sideways across his thighs, allowing his thick legs to sprawl across the bench while he leaned against the adjacent side of the hot tub. It also put his belly right where he wanted it, the side of it pressed close to Cain’s torso with the top part peeking out of the water. Then there was the added bonus of being able to feel Cain’s impressive erection digging into his ass. They always had the most amazing sex when Dean was stuffed like this, and the reminder of what was to come was more than welcome.
Dean’s mouth immediately started watering when Cas came back with their substantial lunch. “How much do I owe you?” he asked, eyes locked on the prize.
: Bar/club AU, Dean/Cas, age difference, chubby!Dean
Which led Cas to his current predicament. He framed his stomach with his hands and turned sideways in the mirror, studying how his indecently tight waistband made him look bigger than he was, how his belly bulged out over his belt. His new weight was a little easier to hide when clothed, but without a shirt, the results of Cas's gluttony were as clear as day.
Sure enough, Dean got another timely reply. ‘You’re making it very difficult to get through this meeting.’ More of a response than last time at least, but still not good enough. It was time to pull out the big guns. Unfortunately, the big guns involved Dean getting up, and he grumbled as he hauled himself off the couch. Dean cradled his full belly when it protested the movement. This was commonplace, as Dean was always full nowadays - honestly, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d truly been hungry - but it could still be uncomfortable at times.
In what seemed like no time at all, Dean had plowed though five more ice cream bars. He carefully arranged the empty box and wrappers on the counter for a picture, but no, that wasn’t good enough. He needed more to send.
Wait.
A beat of silence.
"You have a nine A.M. class on Wednesdays."
"Cas," Dean whined, drawing it out. "Can't- can't reach th' brownie." He dramatically lifted an arm up as if to demonstrate the gaping distance between him and his dessert - a foot, give or take a few inches, but Dean wasn't getting there any time soon. His bulging belly sat heavily on his lap, the weight pinning him to the back of the chair. He'd only been able to reach the burgers because Cas had (oh so kindly) placed the plate on his gut for him.
Friday night, Dean sat alone in his hotel room, shirtless and munching on the famous Junior’s cheesecake he’d treated himself to. Whenever Dean took off his shape wear lately he’d just take off the shirt he was wearing as well, as he couldn’t get the buttons done up without the extra layers of constricting fabric to hold his belly back. It was fine, Dean was gonna go to the gym soon. He’d lose the weight. But for now he wanted to enjoy his cheesecake in peace, so he shoved aside the anxiety building in his chest and served himself another slice to take his mind off the whole matter.
"Oh my god, I've said it before and I'll say it again - how are we related?" The waiter seemed to perk up a little once Dean made it clear that he and Sam were related, that they weren't on a date. Yeah, the dude definitely had the hots for Dean. Seemed that he had good taste in more than just milkshakes. "Anyways, darlin', I'll have the buffet special."
Didn't follow the prompt to the letter - Dean can still get around a bit - but considering the biggest I've written him is 530ish, he's pretty big ;)
Dean cleared his throat and looked around the bar, anxious to find another customer. He, a grownass adult, was seriously considering jumping the young, gorgeous dude across from him, and that wouldn't do. He needed a distraction. Sadly, the club closed in fifteen minutes, and most other customers had cleared out. The only people left besides Cas, and a few others still dancing, were drunk enough that Dean had cut them off hours ago. He was out of options.
Some time later, Dean was roused by a large hand on his stomach, and he hummed when it started to rub in wide circles.
baby, was almost too much to handle.
: Bakery AU, Dean/Benny, baker!Benny, fat!Dean
Dean settled even further into his seat, unbothered by this recent development, although he did reach under his gut to find just where it was touching the seat. He shoved his hand between his skin and the seat and lifted slightly, his fat giving way much easier with the help of the water. It was usually too difficult for him to jerk off while sitting down, but he was getting hard anyway, and the water
"There's more where that came from, buddy," Dean said with a laugh, pushing his own slice of pie towards Cas. "Dig in."
"Oh, dude, you didn't even have to ask," Dean said, mouth already watering. He took the plate and placed it on his belly, the way he'd been eating for a while now, as the table was much too far away. Dean took a bite of the dark, crumble-topped pie, not even bothering to ask what it was, 'cause he knew anything Benny baked would be delicious.
That night, as Cas made new holes in his belt with Dean's pocket knife, he decided that he could deal with a bit of a belly if it meant he could eat the food he loved, even if he didn't like it that much. But Dean seemed to like it a lot, so maybe it would grow on him.
Dean remembered that night. Cain had been weirdly clingy, wouldn’t let him leave his side even to get drinks. “Jealous much?” Dean asked with a lazy grin.
"I'm straight," Dean said without thinking. That was his usual reply to the more polite kids, his way of letting them down easy, even though Dean's bisexual ass was about as straight as a corkscrew.
“What is it?”
“You realize what this means, right?”
And that's how the night ended, with Dean on his hands and knees on Benny's bed, his belly hanging low as Benny plowed into him from behind. A perfect ending to a perfect date, as far as Dean was concerned, and when they set up another date while laying in Benny's bed, he knew his baker felt the same.
But Cain just nuzzled his neck and placed a hand right next to Dean’s on his belly, rubbing slowly. It forced another few burps out of Dean, and while it was a little embarrassing, it freed up some space in his stomach and felt amazing, so Dean just hummed instead of apologizing again. Belly rubs were fucking awesome under any circumstances.
a tight fit - as he picked up the menu with the other.
"Gym requirement," he said, squeezing Cas's soft side in silent apology when he groaned pitifully. "I'm sorry, babe, I totally forgot about that. I don't think the teacher's gonna cut you a break, either."
Dean popped open the buttons and his belly surged out of the confines of the vest and pushed the sides away, bouncing as it fell into place over his waist. It hung low, as opposed to how the vest kept it high up in its proper place, and jiggled as it settled. That's what a life of overeating, drinking beer, and hating exercise will get you, Dean thought as he looked down at his gut. An oversized beer belly and a set of impressive love handles.
"T-thanks, darlin'." Apparently it was Dean's turn to stutter. This guy was just getting bolder and bolder, and damn if Dean wasn't into it. And when he winked as he walked away, Dean's dick twitched. Oh yeah, he loved this place, not only for the food but also the eye candy and the crappy flirting.
A little bolder now, the waiter gave him a once over and replied, "Of course, sir. Let me know if you need help with anything." He walked away, hips swaying a bit this time. Once again,
"Oh, shut up," Dean huffed. "Now come over here and help a guy out."
"Yeah, just takes a bit of elbow grease," Dean replied, flexing his flabby biceps. They didn't bulge in the slightest. "And anyways, it's not really all that tight. Her seat doesn't go back anymore, but it's okay. I still fit."
Mirroring Dean's raised brow, Cas gave him a pat on the belly. "You're not wearing a shirt, Dean, and I sincerely doubt that any of your old shirts will fit. You can't exactly safety pin your shirt buttons."
"It's currently twelve fifty- oh my god, would you
“Yeah, it’s a bit much,” Alfie admitted, looking uncomfortable even as he said the words. “It kinda feels like you guys might jump each other on the field about fifty percent of the time.”
"Seriously, dude, it's okay," he assured, trying not to stare at the guy for too long. Fuck, what was wrong with him? Change the subject, Dean. "Uh, can I get you a drink?"
"Our reservation was for almost half an hour ago, Dean," Dean said to himself in a high-pitched voice, watching as Sam walked away. God, his little brother was such a nerd.
Cas's mind whispered, and he shuddered.
Anon named ‘nonny’ requested some fat!Cas, and anon named ‘Oops’ gave me this prompt: “Season 13 AU, after coming back from the dead, Cas is weakened and almost human. Dean takes to spoiling Cas rotten with food while he recovers, and then it's just habit (and Cas realizes how much Dean likes Cas at home and safe so really he's helping Dean by allowing him to feed him up) Cas becomes quite the spoiled couch potato due to all the goodies and Netflix he could ever want. And he may not strictly NEED help moving around yet, but Dean loves helping him anyway, gotta keep his precious angel safe getting off the couch.”
Dean did everything he could to disguise his body; Cole had always been ridiculously fit and Dean didn’t want to look like he’d blubbered out. He wore his puffiest jacket, ugly though it was, to camouflage his soft torso and tight shirt. A scarf was pulled up high to cover his double chin. Even though he left the house feeling like a sausage shoved into too-small casing, Dean was pretty sure that Cole wouldn’t be able to tell he’d gained weight. The two problem areas were hidden. He knew he wouldn’t be able to keep up this charade forever, but hopefully his metabolism would figure itself out before the problem got too big for him to handle. Or something.
"Fine," Sam said after a moment, eyebrow raised, still surveying the carnage. Cas didn't say anything, and Dean shifted uncomfortably. "But christ, Dean, what did you do while we were gone? Eat a small country?"
“A little,” he muttered, “but I still have dinner at home after this,” and Cas went up to the counter and ordered another milkshake. Dean spluttered a bit when he brought it back, eyes wide. “Cas, I really shouldn’t have another,” he said with a hand on his belly.
“Kind of.” Sam sat up straight, and while a part of Dean missed the kisses, a bigger part of him was glad that Sam’s attention had been diverted. It had become a little too much. Though he still kept his hands on Dean’s stomach, and that was okay. “I like bellies. They make great pillows, not to mention that they’re super sexy.”
“Shut up,” Dean mumbled, and hell, why not — he went in for that kiss.
Fast for Dean wasn't exactly fast for everyone else, however, and Castiel caught up with him before he'd even reached his room. He spun around furiously when Cas touched his shoulder and yelled, face red from both embarrassment and anger, "Leave me alone!"
“No, I mean it.” Dean wiped the sweat from his brow, waddled another step forward. “I have a strict no dick policy, starting now. You’d fuckin’ agree with me if you knew what it was like to be pregnant in goddamn June. In goddamn
Dean whimpered and grabbed Cain’s wrist, tried to guide it further down his body, but Cain just kept tracing above the delicate lace, avoiding the one place Dean really needed attention. He ran his fingers along the sensitive underside of Dean’s belly and Dean shuddered, goosebumps popping up on his arms. He probably deserved this for all the pictures he’d sent, but damn it, Dean had waited long enough.
He grunted a curse at Sam, as the slap had caused his overly-full gut to jiggle madly, and picked up the receipt to leave an 80% tip. It was then that he noticed the white box sitting next to the folder. Curious, he said to Sam, "I didn't know we had any leftovers. You get something to go?"
“How do I look?” he joked, turning to Sam, but his mouth dried up at the way his shirt stretched over Sam’s shoulders, barely contained his biceps. “Uh.”
, as the shirt showcased his cave-like belly button, hanging breasts, and bulging love handles.
theirs, finders keepers and all that jazz. And the pie looked too good to leave until tomorrow.
Hands still on his middle, Dean belched loudly and leaned back in his seat. He eventually bit the bullet and unbuttoned his pants, let his stomach expand, and sighed at the instant relief it granted him. Finally feeling comfortable enough to drive, Dean turned the key and made his way home slowly, wincing whenever a bump in the road jostled his gurgling belly.
Pretty much canon, but with chubby!Dean. Short and sweet, no pairing - just Dean and a pair of jeans ;)
Dean grunted around a mouthful of chips in response, and Cas took that as his cue to start eating. He took a bite, and
“Baby wants funnel cake,” Dean agreed, and while Castiel knew it wasn’t good for him, he couldn’t say no to his beautiful mate. He’d grab something healthier to balance it out.
Dean sighed as another twenty-something wearing too much glitter ordered a blowjob shot, winking at Dean like he was the only one who'd thought of the joke. He was the first one of the night, at least, so kudos to him, but he certainly wouldn't be the last.
It had taken little convincing to allow Cas to go to Dean's house for Thanksgiving, as Cas's parents didn't really celebrate it - a holiday centered around food and warm, fuzzy feelings wasn't exactly their cup of tea. As a result, Cas had never had a true Thanksgiving meal, and he was quite looking forward to this one.
"Novak!" Walker yelled, hands on his hips. "You ain't done yet!"
The amazing eyes belonged to a twenty-something guy with major bed head, pink lips, and a little too much stubble. He looked completely mortified, his eyes wide and mouth open, and he said, "I apologize, that wasn't me, my friend-"
"Mm hmm."
The club closed in several minutes anyway; he could afford to clock out a tad early. And hey, it was about time he had a midlife crisis too. His was just about to come in (heh, come in) the form of fucking a dude who was young enough to get carded at a liquor store.
Since their previous pitcher had graduated last year, Dean made the team easily, though he probably would have made it even if they already had a pitcher. He was just that good. They had a designated hitter for the pitcher anyway, so his somewhat subpar skills in the hitting and running departments didn’t matter in the slightest.
"I'm surprised you can button them at all," he chuckled. "You've really been packing away the calories, buddy. You out-eat
Nothing really changed after the whole ghost incident. Screw killing ghosts, Dean was good at the job he had, and there had to be
"You love me."
No matter how hard Dean tugged, the flaps refused to meet over the soft swell of his middle. He sucked in, wrenched the sides together, but still no cigar. The little gold button managed to just brush the hole on the other side, and Dean got his hopes up before he realized that this was quite literally as far as they’d go, ‘cause the waistband was slicing into his sides and might actually start to cut him if he pulled any harder. Either that or the fabric would split.
been leaving all that shit?”
"Sorry, little brother, but I can't turn this thing off," Dean smirked, gesturing to himself. "And this is the only way I fit, dickhead. Besides, I think I might do this more often. I'm kinda liking this." He shoved one hand under his belly - and damn, was
“It’s because you’ve totally fucked with your metabolism, man,” Sam told him during their weekly drink meetup. “Those horrible ‘cleanses’ you used to go on weren’t good for you. Like, at all.”
"Sammy, my shirt's just gonna roll up again if I try to stretch it back down. Why don't you try an' make yourself useful instead? Do me a favor and pull," he said, reaching out towards Sam with a pudgy hand. He still wore his favorite ring, Sam noticed, but it was so tight that it looked to be cutting off his circulation.
The following evening, as Cas studied himself in Dean's full-length mirror, he was struck by the fancy that he wanted to button his pants over his belly tonight, something he hadn't done for months. Castiel sucked in as much as he could and shimmied his waistband up slowly, changing his tactic to sharp, belly-shaking tugs when he got nowhere fast. After a couple sweaty minutes, Cas wheezed triumphantly, the waistband of Dean's old pants nestled firmly in the crease that ran around his torso, his lower belly and love handles safely contained.
He worked his way back up to a loping jog, his thick thighs chafing where the basketball shorts had ridden up. Everything hurt, and although no one was being outright mean, Cas could feel pairs of judging eyes on him as he stumbled, could hear the whispers and snickers. If his face wasn't already red as a tomato, Castiel would have flushed in embarrassment.
As he continued to liberally sample the pie, Dean started to think back on his idea of calling up Lisa when he got home. Might be a little while, cause he was pretty sure he wouldn't be able to move (let alone get in his car) for at least half an hour, but she'd still be awake. They hadn't had sex in a few months now, and it filled Dean with glee to think about how she might react to his new weight. Also, he was still hard as a goddamn rock and had been for at least an hour.
A few seconds passed. "So," Cas began, "was your - frankly obvious, by the way, as you're clearly not heterosexual - admission of your sexuality your way of saying that you'd like to sleep with me?"
"It was good," he said, ignorant of the way Cas's brain lost all function at the sight of a shirtless Dean. He stared as Dean tugged on a new, less sweaty shirt, hypnotized by the way his belly shook where it pushed over the waistband of his gym shorts. He didn't seem to have any of the little pink stretch marks Cas had noticed on his own hips and stomach.
“And truffles,” Dean pointed out. “And pizza, and the leftovers from last night’s dinner, and the rest of that cake. We’re out of cake, by the way.” He stifled a burp with one hand and blushed a little, uncharacteristically shy all of a sudden. “Uh, sorry.”
exercise out of his life had made a huge difference in his physique. And Sam meant
Almost.
Anything to get some of Cain’s layers off. Dean nodded eagerly and stood, remembering how full he was when his middle fell into place over his waistband. “Fuck,” he hissed, and he clutched his belly. Cain used to carry him when he was like this, and while he was way too heavy for that now, Dean still turned pleading eyes to the other man. He could make the journey himself but that didn’t mean he wanted to.
Victor, Jo, and Bobby were already eating, the lucky bastards, but Cas agreed easily. “Large deep dish sausage, please.”
“I gotta-“ Dean heaved himself out of his chair and made a break for the single stall bathroom, his one track mind managing to miss Sam’s look of alarm. As soon as the door closed he tore at his shirt buttons, desperate, glad that he’d forgone the tank for once. Off, off, off-
Cas chuckled. Dean did like to show him off on the rare occasion they went out, and he always kept a possessive hand at the small of his back while they walked (more like waddled, in Cas’s case) together, like someone might snatch him away if Dean wasn’t careful, as if a lot of people were trying to land an obese ex-angel. And the only place they really went on dates was the local buffet, because they had special seats for people of Cas’s size, and Castiel sincerely doubted that anyone went there to pick up men. And Dean was the only one for him anyway.
“Seven hundred and thirty-two pounds, sweetheart.” He shuffled forward, grabbed two big rolls at Cas’s sides and pressed his face into his belly. “That’s fuckin’ ridiculous,” Dean said, words muffled.
Dean's fantasizing was cut short as he noticed the short note scrawled on the inside of the box. He hauled the pie on top of his belly and continued to eat, grunting as the motion caused all of his rolls to shake. The note read:
Every once in a while ended up being basically every meal, and by the time his Friday meeting rolled around, Dean’s shape wear was tighter than he remembered it being. It was probably just because of his big lunch, he reasoned — two huge chicken salad sandwiches and a coke and a bag of potato chips and a cookie the size of his head, not to mention the two free cupcakes from a birthday on the fifth floor — but whatever the reason, sitting was almost unbearable, and Dean was glad he had to give the presentation. Gave him an excuse to stand. He loosened the belly belt a notch when he got home.
, 'cause Dean fuckin' hated stairs. He made a whole crockpot of gumbo, gave Dean much more than his fair share, and then produced a pecan pie out of nowhere, of which he had one slice. Benny gave the rest of the pie to Dean.
Dean slowly made his way to the kitchen and grabbed a popsicle out of the freezer. The best lighting was by the bay windows, so Dean wandered over as he peeled off the wrapper, opened the camera once more. They were miles from their nearest neighbor; Dean had no qualms about taking slutty selfies in his underwear in plain sight.
Cas had brought Dean a total of three milkshakes, three slices of pie, two of Mary’s gigantic cheeseburgers, and about a pound of french fries over the course of their evening. He ate whatever Cas gave him. It really was astounding, how much Dean could put away, and lately Cas had noticed the buttons on Dean’s jerseys getting tighter and tighter around his gut. They’d also stopped at Target the day before so Dean could get a new belt, as his usual one wasn’t up to the job anymore.
It was at this moment that the waiter stopped by to drop off the check. His eyes bulged a bit at the sight of Dean's ruined shirt, and, realizing that Dean was a bit incapacitated, he handed the check off to Sam without taking his eyes off of Dean and his mammoth stomach resting on the majority of the table.
Wait. Shit. He was meeting Sam at the local coffeehouse at one, ‘cause Sam’s parents were in town and they couldn’t meet that night. And dammit, he really wanted to catch up with his friend — they hadn’t hung out in more than two weeks at this point, as Sandover was a big company and it was difficult to overlap if you weren’t in the same department — but it was already a bit past noon and Dean was in no shape to leave the house. Still, he missed Sam a lot. He could do this. Dean shifted his weight in preparation to get up, but oh, that was so not happening right now.
“That’s just ‘cause you’re a freak.”
Sam had to cancel their plans that week, and Dean spent his Saturday night watching Indiana Jones movies and eating ice cream and absolutely not moping.
“It was a little more gradual than that,” Dean protested weakly. He barricaded himself back in his office for the rest of the day, worried that people would start to suspect that his body shape was less than natural, even though he knew that it was probably only Becky. Girl was a freakin’ stalker. He got another intern to bring him a BLT and fries for lunch, devoured the food in minutes, and spent the rest of the workday feeling hungry even though he knew that he’d had a fairly reasonable lunch.
Sam immediately brought his other hand to Dean’s belly. He worked his fingers gently, and rather than focus on how not even Sam’s giant mitts could hold the entirety of his gut, Dean was mesmerized by how good it felt. This felt so much better than when he did it. Dean let out the breath he didn’t even know he’d been holding, and his middle nudged Sam’s knuckles. Just a friendly belly rub between bros, that’s all it was; no way Sam felt the same way as he did.
wanted Cain’s hands for hours. He could feel his dick harden even further in anticipation.
“You know you love it,” Dean said with a smirk. He held up a spoonful and Cas opened his mouth automatically.
Third grocery trip of the month and Dean's belly was really tugging at his shirt now, a little crease in the fabric evident where it was starting to bunch up above his stomach. He tugged the sweats' waistband a little lower, too - he'd just had a whole medium pizza and cinnamon sticks, give him a break. Weirdly enough his nipples were also more evident, and when Dean pinched at one to see what the deal was, there was a little more to pinch than normal. Interesting.
Dean didn't stop eating
Crap, it would be pretty rude if Dean fell asleep in the middle of talking to Cas, no matter how full and sleepy he was. Dean opened his eyes and sat up a little straighter, grunted from the effort of doing so with a stuffed stomach. “Shit, sorry.”
He lived up to his words by giving Cas a long belly rub after his feast, Castiel whimpering every so often, his gut pooled onto his lap. Dean had brought a huge amount of food, expecting leftovers, but Cas had eaten it all. He didn't regret it, even if his stomach was very angry with him. And when Dean sucked him off later, Cas held his still-bloated belly in both hands because he needed to keep it from smothering Dean.
During the drive back to Cas’s house, Dean sat in the driver’s seat with his pants still undone, belly sitting in his lap, and he punched Cas lightly in the arm. “Asshole,” he said with a slight smile, one that turned into a grimace when they went over a pothole and his stomach was jostled. “Feel like I’m gonna explode thanks to you.”
say you could wear either, and it would certainly save Cas the trouble of unbuckling after meals. Dean kissed Cas when he opened the box set of Star Wars movies he'd gotten him, and Cas smiled.
Cas nodded. “I stress bake,” he said, as if that explained everything.
In the three or so weeks of school between Thanksgiving and Christmas break, Castiel managed to outgrow both his - Dean's, really - shirts and pants. Dean just let out the pants again, but not much could be done about the shirts, so he ended up with quite a few popped buttons and even a torn seam. His boyfriend, ever-helpful, would just roll his eyes and fix the rips and tears, but Cas noticed the way he blushed high on his cheeks as he sewed.
He slowly made his way to the set of tables, hands resting on the sides of his belly as he walked, as Dean liked to feel how he jiggled when he moved. When he reached the buffet, Dean's shirt was back above his belly button, but he was too hungry to care. Some skinny chick gasped as he got in line behind her, like his very existence was scandalous. He just winked at her as he patted his ample gut, and she huffed, disgusted, and looked away. Whatever, he wasn't everyone's type, but she sure was missing out.
Not to mention the fact that dinner was when Cas really let himself cut loose in terms of food. He'd taken to shoveling down a plate as quickly as possible so he could get to the real prize: dessert. Dinner was really more of an appetizer followed by a multiple-course dessert, at least for Castiel. Dean would bring him pie, cake, cookies, ice cream, and more. Cas didn't even have to get up.
The flaming pile of garbage presented to us as the series finale has raised me from the ashes. So here, have a fic that has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Castiel squeezed Dean’s hands and tugged, a signal for Dean to get up. Dean hoisted himself up, one hand on the wall, one on his gut, and immediately plastered himself to Cas’s side. He pressed into Cas desperately, barely managed to get close enough to give him a kiss on the cheek, too much fat in the way to get any closer. A hand slipped underneath Cas’s shirt and rubbed, knocked soft rolls into each other, and Cas huffed, the violent jiggling pulling the breath from his lungs.
"Y'know," Dean said through wheezing breaths after they broke apart, Benny still in his lap, the chair beneath them groaning pitifully, "I've never been against puttin' out on the first date."
“Hello, darling,” Cain said, and Dean opened sleepy eyes and yawned. “You were quite the distraction at work today.”
But damn if Cas wasn't amazing at this. He sucked and licked like he was getting paid for it, and Dean felt like he was the star of a porno. The only thing out of place was his doughy belly as it shook, Cas's movements making it jiggle madly, but Dean honestly didn't give two shits.
“Fuck off,” Dean said, but he grinned as he eagerly unwrapped the paper plate piled high with snickerdoodles. He shoved one in his mouth and sighed happily. Lunch wasn’t for another three hours, and Dean needed this like he needed air.
Bloated and full, Dean puffed out a breath and leaned back, reached up to loosen the shoulder straps of his overalls and give the fabric more room to accommodate his stomach. Soda puffed him up like nothing else, and the two liter bottle was more than halfway empty, and he’d also scarfed down two pizzas. Dean only had twenty minutes left of his official break, so set his hands atop his thick belly and closed his eyes, planning on using the rest of his break to digest and maybe take a quick power nap.
"And how did you even get here? Can you turn the wheel? Like, at all?"
Dean grabbed his duffel of clothes he kept stashed behind the counter and took Cas's hand, mind spinning, and gave a half-hearted goodbye to his fellow workers as he burst through the back door and into the employee parking lot. Cool air brushed against his bare belly and Dean shivered as he pulled Cas towards his Baby. After unlocking the doors, Dean tossed his bag in the front and climbed into the back seat. He swore he wasn't usually this easy, but something about Cas made him wanna spread his legs and beg for it. Like right now.
"Unfortunately, yes."
Maybe he put off the gym membership until next week, but hey, he had to ease himself into this.
"What?" he asked without thinking, eyes wide. He'd already finished his exercise!
He told this to Dean excitedly as his boyfriend helped him brace his ankle, slightly loopy on the pain medication the nurse had given him as he swayed lightly on the bed.
"Hey, Dean," Sam replied. "Nice of you to finally show up." He wasn't annoyed anymore, not really, but he still had to antagonize his brother. It was practically his job as the younger sibling.
“Oh,” Dean said. His heart skipped a beat. “Same, for the record. And I guess I didn’t? Kinda thought you were straight.”
Cas felt Dean's guiding arm around his waist as they slowly trekked back to their room, and when his hand squeezed a roll at his side, Cas felt a surge of heat go through him that definitely wasn't from the alcohol. He took a hand away from where it was attempting to hold his stomach steady and snuck it around Dean's waist to do the same, relishing in the sharp intake of Dean's breath and the softness of his love handle as he grabbed at it. Castiel would never do this sober, but currently his parents' words had fled from his head and he really just wanted to know if Dean was as soft and cuddly as he looked.
Though Dean hated cardio and refused to run unless something was chasing him - his words - he frequently lifted weights at the school gym, and it showed. His arms pulled at his shirts just as much as his stomach. He was wearing a tank top today, as it was an unseasonably hot day for early October, and his biceps bulged enticingly as he stripped off his shirt, no qualms about his own nudity even though he always seemed to turn into a blushing mess whenever Cas so much as rolled up his sleeves.
Well, in
Cas pulled his shirt up above his stomach and huh, it did kind of look like his binging had taken its toll. His stomach sloped slightly outwards where it had previously been flat, and when Cas poked at it curiously, his fingertip pushed in more than he'd expected it to. When Castiel looked back up and dropped his shirt, Dean's face was red.
"Yes," Cas said firmly, bringing his hands to Dean's hips. He squeezed gently and rubbed at Dean's belly with his thumbs, and Dean couldn't help the little sigh that escaped him. Then they were kissing in the hallway as Cas ran his big hands up and down Dean's body, caressing every inch of new fat, Dean pressed against the nearest door. Cas broke the kiss and whispered, "It really is quite becoming on you."
"And what time is it now?" Cas prodded.
"Yes, I think I like blowjobs," Cas said with a look in his eye, and goddammit, he totally knew what he was saying.
Most of the time, Dean could keep himself occupied. He’d sunbathe, watch Netflix, stuff his face, go shopping, play video games, see a friend, jerk off, whatever, but god, today was just stretching on and on. Nothing seemed appealing right now, Cain’s meeting was running late, and Dean was dying.
Do not fuck the hot twink, Dean.
noticed when, that night, Dean's supple midsection bounced as he rode Cas. Thick thighs squeezed Cas's ribs and, instinctually, Cas grabbed onto Dean's hips. He came immediately when he felt the soft love handles forming there.
without passing out. He had no idea what he'd do tomorrow and went to bed that night dreading the following day, even being the little spoon not enough to make him feel any better. When the day broke, Cas woke up with a knot of anxiety buried deep in his chest, but he didn't say anything to Dean, as he had a huge physics test that day and didn't need Cas's problems on top of his own.
Though his shirt had long ago ridden up around his upper belly, he'd still managed to pop two of the buttons, and now Cas's entire belly was on display, pooched out into his (and Dean's) lap. He giggled and panted and opened his mouth for another chocolate, blissfully ignorant of the way Dean's face was bright red. The bag was gone soon enough, and Cas sighed again and grabbed Dean's wrists, brought them around to his belly, and demanded that he rub.
But Dean knew he’d be able to hide it tomorrow, and that gym membership he was gonna get would certainly cut off some pounds, so maybe it was fine if Dean pigged out every once in a while. That was a normal thing to do, right?
Sam crunched on his salad, trying not to look at Dean as they talked about various subjects, apparently embarrassed by his public gluttony. Dean didn't hold it against him, though; he knew Sam loved him, and so what if he thought Dean was being a pig? He was right, after all, Dean thought as he tore into a steak.
"Would you like to go to Denny's?" Cas asked, eyes locked on Dean's gut. "They have all you can eat pancakes."
“Of course. I’ll be right back.” Cas took off like a shot towards the food stands, managing to fill his arms with even more snacks than before. Two pulled pork sandwiches, half a dozen donuts, a caramel apple, a fried chicken basket, three corn dogs, an order of fried pickles, a huge cup of coke, and a full dozen of those fried oreos later, Cas stumbled back to their table. He’d forgotten to get something for himself, but right now that wasn’t as important as feeding his pregnant omega. Dean always came first.
How the hell was he supposed to get out of this one? There was no way he could stuff himself back into that belt, but his shirt wouldn’t button without it. Dean ran his fingers through his hair, cupped his gut with the other hand, and racked his brain for any ideas. If he could somehow get his pants buttoned around his middle then maybe he could get the shirt done up?
"You have gained a significant amount of weight, Dean," Cas cut in, and oh god, not him too.
God, Dean never would've thought that he'd ever get this big. Back before getting ownership of the garage a little over a year and a half ago, his 300 pound self had never even imagined cresting 500 pounds. The pounds had piled on fast, and now Dean regularly fantasized about hitting the next big number. 550, 600, maybe more... Actually, 550 couldn't be too far off.
"No problem," Dean said casually, though it sounded forced, and Cas couldn't help but notice the way Dean's eyes dropped to his stomach. He purposely pushed his stomach out as far as he could, and Dean swallowed. Well then.
Dean glanced at the huge analog clock hanging above the exit. "Twelve fifty-four."
Dean couldn’t help his ugly laugh. “Oh yeah, I feel hot as fuck right now. Just me and my gut, reeling the ladies in left and right.”
southern drawl and yup, this was officially Dean's new spot.
“Yeah. And thanks for all the help, man. You’re a real life saver.”
"That would be much appreciated," Cas said. He wasn't too worried about his weight gain. He'd always been on the skinny side, and getting some more meat on his bones would just make him solid, more mature-looking.
“Fine, thanks,” Castiel responded tersely, embarrassed beyond belief. He decided to play it cool and turned to meet the faceless boy, but that plan ground to a screeching halt when he caught sight of said boy.
Wait, fuck, maybe it was because he’d downed his entire drink without meaning to. Self consciousness had activated automatic feeding mode, it seemed, and now that Dean took a minute to stop and think, he needed this fucking belt off ASAP. It was even more unbearable than before if that was possible.
liked women. Dean didn't like to deprive anyone of all that he had to offer.
“Actually,” Dean said, still massaging Cas’s stomach, “I got permission from the hardware store to use their industrial scale after-hours, and I was gonna surprise you with a visit. I guess it’s not a surprise anymore, but what do you think?”
"Phew, felt like a fuckin' sausage in there," Dean panted as he rubbed his stomach. "Not that I don't love my Baby, but she is
“Mm hmm. Feels nice.” Dean shoved down his self-consciousness and uncertainties and let himself enjoy the experience. It wasn’t like all his insecurities had spontaneously disappeared, but Sam obviously didn’t mind the extra weight, and that knowledge helped Dean stay calm.
"That's neat," Dean managed to get out, trying to steer his brain away from the thought of Cas' pink, pink lips wrapped around... something. "What year?"
“And you’re mine,” Dean agreed, and he finally sat up with a grunt. “Don’t worry, baby. I don’t got eyes for anyone but you.”
So maybe Cas did a little more than notice, but he couldn't help it. Dean just looked so
“What the fuck, Smith,” he muttered to himself, and his stomach responded with a loud noise. He needed to fix this before it got even more out of control.
It was settled. Dean was going to hell.
“I don’t like other people looking at you,” Cain growled, and he squeezed Dean’s belly possessively. “You’re mine.”
When he arrived, Dean stopped in the doorway, took a couple slow breaths, and wiped away the beads of sweat forming at his brow. Being fat in August sucked, and the garage didn’t have the best AC. He was always sweaty, and moving didn’t exactly help. “Anyone wanna split some pizzas?”
When Castiel woke up the next morning, his head was pounding, his belly gurgling, and his back sore from falling asleep... sitting up? The memories from the night previous rushed back all at once and Cas felt his face flush. He was propped up against Dean, and there was a wet spot on Dean's shirt that Cas had drooled on. They were pressed together and Dean's arms were holding him tight, Cas atop his lap, and Dean's head was tilted against his own, soft snores coming from his slightly-open mouth. He was downright adorable, but Cas was more embarrassed than he'd ever been, fuzzy memories of gorging himself and demanding cuddles resurfacing, not to mention the fact that he needed to pee like a racehorse, and he needed to get up.
Dean adjusted the waistband of his pants again, trying to make them more comfortable around his hips. The pants had always been tight, as that was how they were supposed to fit, but lately the elastic had started to dig into Dean uncomfortably. Mostly because when Dean got settled, he got fat; a well-paying job had steadily added to his weight over the past month, and Dean was seriously considering asking for a size up. The tight waistband was slung low under his belly and it still cut into him, leaving deep red marks under his stomach and love handles. Dean lifted his gut out of the way to massage the marks and rolled his eyes when the action garnered several wolf whistles and a tenner thrown on the bar. Jesus, you'd think he was a stripper or something, but he was really just a fat guy in tight pants who wanted to go home and eat his leftover pizza.
"I make a mean blowjob," Dean's mouth said without his brain agreeing.
"Hmm, I'll give it a try. One blowjob, please."
Dean left the bar uncomfortably full, holding his jacket in front of his middle to hide how his bloated stomach stuck out in front of him and tugged at his shirt buttons. He groaned as he sunk into the driver’s seat, palmed at his belly, and winced. God, there was a lot of food in there, but he hadn’t been able to help himself lately, just couldn’t stop eating until he was stuffed. He really should have had more control after years of dieting, but his flabby stomach said otherwise.
“Guess,” Dean said faintly, and he grabbed Cas’ meaty leg as if to steady himself.
Maybe Dean had a bit of a crush, but he was handling it, okay? Well, mostly handling it. At least he managed to avoid blatantly checking the guy out, only sneaking a quick glance at how well his overalls hugged his ass. Damn, what an ass.
For the past five weeks or so, some angel at the garage had been leaving plates of goodies in the break room. Dean honestly had no idea who it was; none of his coworkers had owned up yet, and every note attached simply said ‘for whoever,’ never signed. ‘Whoever’ generally ended up being Dean, much to his delight, as everyone had heard the tales of the infamous Winchester appetite and knew better than to stand between Dean and food, even unintentionally. The type of food varied, though it was usually some type of homemade sweet, and although at first it had only happened once or twice a week, a plate of cookies, tin of pie, or box of donuts had been left on the table every day for the past nine days, and Dean wasn’t complaining.
Two twenty really wasn’t that bad, Dean knew that, but he’d gained thirty-five pounds in just over two goddamn months. Which
“I think it’s a little small on me,” Sam said with a laugh, but when he turned to face Dean, his face went slack. “Never mind, I am so glad we switched shirts.”
to accumulate, or so Dean said - in just over two months, Cas didn't hear what Dean said next. "What?"
Cas's pants had busted for a reason, and his full belly definitely didn't need more food. It gurgled pitifully from where it rested lightly on his thighs, still not happy about the way Cas stuffed himself with junk even after ten weeks of the same treatment, and against his better judgement, Castiel slurred, "Thanks, Dean," and took the opened bag. Damn, the drinks were really starting to hit him now.
“You don’t have to do that, dude,” Dean said as he opened the top box. “I know this wasn’t cheap.”
It was a feeling he was used to.
"What was that?"
When they were finally in bed, just a few minutes shy of two, Cas snuggled up behind Dean and ran a soft hand over his overfed stomach. "I don't know why you do this to yourself, Dean."
His dick was hard as a rock by this point, but he couldn't exactly do anything about it, both because he was in public and because he was pretty sure that he couldn't reach around his gut at that point; his arms felt like lead and his belly was bloated beyond belief. Some combination of the delicious food, the show he was putting on, the plain disgust on the other diners' faces, the hot waiter, and the thrill that his hard on couldn't even be seen due to his hulking belly turned him on like nothing else. Maybe he'd call Lisa tonight. Yeah, she was his ex, but they still kind of had this friends with benefits thing going on that Dean could really go for right about now.
"I think I'd like another blowjob, please," Cas said when Dean didn't respond.
Chubby!Dean, Dean/Cain, and some cross-dressing, because why not. Very much AU.
Wow, it’s been a while. After writing this, I realized that I kind of took inspiration from one of mnwood’s fics - she’s awesome, btw - so big shoutout to her! Check out ‘Fat and Happy’ for the fic I’m talking about (I think it’s the last chapter).
Halfway through the third week, Dean got a call from Cas while he was eating Doritos and watching Cupcake Wars. "'Ey, Cas," he managed to get out around a mouthful of chips. One dude's cupcakes came out all weird and deflated, and Dean grumbled, "Idiot."
The belly rub paused not long after. Dean cracked one eye open and frowned, tightening his hand around Cain’s hair to emphasize his displeasure. “What gives,” he grunted.
“Nah, not for a couple more hours. Oh, I got you a vanilla latte already, the line is killer. Hope you don’t mind.” Sam was fidgeting a little, kind of pink-cheeked, but Dean was too busy worrying about his buttons and internal organs to give it much thought.
"Mm," Cas hummed absentmindedly, bringing his own hand up to join Dean's on his stomach.
He ignored the little voice in his head that said his metabolism wasn’t the problem.
"Ugh," he moaned, gingerly placing a hand on his angry stomach. It was gurgling and bloated and Dean felt like a beached whale. He rubbed gently and
, Dean had now made up his mind about coming here more often. Soft-looking hair, gorgeous eyes, pink lips... oh yeah, he'd be coming here a
Sam burst between them and into the house, yelling something about them taking too long, and Dean chuckled and pushed Cas inside ahead of him. He was immediately pulled into Mrs. Winchester's plush frame for a hug, and although Castiel had never met the woman in his life, he hugged back. It just felt right. And if he secretly compared their hips during the hug - hers were just a little wider than his own - nobody needed to know that. Mr. Winchester gave him a firm handshake next, and Cas felt a twinge of jealously as he tried not to eye the man's large, round belly. Somewhere along the line, Cas's love for junk food had turned into a love-hate relationship with his own growing body, and Castiel always felt a weird rush of satisfaction whenever he was the largest person in the room.
He bit the bullet and started doing up the belt on its last set of hooks.
Cas’s eyes flickered down to where Dean’s hand rested. He reached out his own hand, ever so slowly, like he was asking permission to touch. “I disagree.”
"Oh my god, Dean," Sam said, "just let me do it." The butter packets were all open and smeared on the biscuits within thirty seconds.
He held his phone just in front of his face, deepthroated the popsicle like it was his job, looked at the lens through thick eyelashes, and hit the button. The picture captured his plump lips stretched wide around the ice cream, his double chin framing the spectacle perfectly. Torturing his boyfriend was so much fun.
By the time break rolled around, Castiel genuinely could not button his uniform shirts any more. No matter how hard he tugged and sucked in, the sides refused to close, and he arrived at Dean's house in one of Dean's stretched-out workout shirts that refused to stay down over his belly. Turned out he hadn't needed to worry about Christmas at all, as his parents were doing some pilgrimage in Jerusalem all break. While Cas was slightly saddened - he hadn't seen his family since they'd dropped him off at school, after all - it was overshadowed by a huge wave of relief. He knew he'd have to face Mother and Father some time, but he was happy putting it off for as long as possible.
idiot, and Cas wouldn't have him any other way.
been at the restaurant for over two hours. The only reason he wasn't bored was because he had been constantly eating.
Turns out Purgatory was less classy, more trashy than Dean had originally thought, and it catered especially to the college kids of Austin. It was the kind of place where bouncers only gave a cursory glance at your ID and workers wore strangely provocative uniforms. Unfortunately, he wasn’t an exception.
: College AU, established Dean/Cas, chubby!Dean
Dean stopped with the spoon halfway to his mouth, and a drop of ice cream dripped down and splattered right on his chest. He pouted, picking at the spot, and whined, "Look what you made me do!"
Coach Walker did the exact opposite, actually. From the moment Cas showed up in Dean's gym clothes, basketball shorts pinching under his gut, tank top barely managing to cover his belly button, the gym teacher slash football coach had it out for him. Every class would start with a warmup, Walker said - five laps around the gym, followed by fifty jumping jacks, push-ups, or sit-ups - and only once you had completed everything could you move onto the game-playing portion of the class. He smirked at Cas as he said this, distastefully eyeing the band of fat that couldn't be contained by Dean's clothes, and Cas gulped.
"Ready to go now?" Cas asked impatiently. Dean let out a resounding belch and sighed happily, closing his eyes. "Guess I'll call a shuttle then."
“Lower,” Dean said around a mouthful. “Left. Mm, yeah.” Another sandwich down the hatch, and he sighed, eyes closed. “Pass me the apple?”
“What, bitch?” Dean asked defiantly, taking a seat at the map table. He grimaced, his abused jeans not taking kindly to the action, and cupped his stomach with his hand. Fuck, this wasn’t comfortable at
“Let’s go get some food,” Cas suggested, gently pushing Dean towards a shaded group of picnic tables. “The baby must be getting hungry.”
Maybe they were doing things a little backwards, but Dean liked Cas, even if he was a bit weird.
Cas gave a gummy smile. “Excellent. It’ll be my treat.”
"'M fine, don't need friggin' babysitters," Dean said petulantly as he dropped a hand to his belly. Damn, he was full. "Good luck on the hunt."
“Fuck you,” Dean said, although he was smiling a little. He tugged his too-small shirt down and left a hand resting on his belly, on the strip of skin that refused to stay covered no matter how many times he tried. “It’s baby weight.”
As it was, Dean really, really needed to go up size or two, but he was perfectly happy with deflecting and fixing his problems with shape wear until the problem was resolved. The belt was gonna be a bitch and a half to get on in this state, and Dean almost texted Sam to cancel, eyeing the contraption anxiously. He’d grown out of it astoundingly fast. His stomach gurgled as if voicing its own concerns.
“Cain,” he said, but it came out as more of a whine.
More or less set in canon. Chubby!Dean is left at the bunker for a month and watches food network too much.
Maybe it all had to do with how different he was. All the other bartenders were young, muscular, and charming, while Dean was the exact opposite. He was solidly middle-aged, hadn't gone to the gym since he'd dropped out of high school, and mainly grunted to communicate with his customers. He lifted weights at home to keep his arms impressively large if he did say so himself, but still. Maybe he just checked enough weirdos’ boxes to merit the cash. Whatever it was, he wasn't complaining as long as it kept the tips up.
As it was, Dean managed to show up barely two minutes late. He spotted Sam at a window seat and took slow steps, still very full and very much in pain, letting out little quiet burps every few feet. He’d figured out in the car that it made him feel marginally better, and at this point Dean was willing to do anything (bar taking off his shape wear) to get some relief.
God, but Dean was pushing all of Castiel’s buttons. He couldn’t have said no even if he wanted to.
Dean stood upright after a couple seconds and took a deep breath, his fat middle making his shirt ride up. He gave his belly a lazy scratch, pulled the hem back down, and wrapped an arm around Cas so he could help him walk. “Let’s get goin’, tons of fun.”
This was actually part of a 5+1 thing I’ve had sitting in my drafts for almost a year, but it makes sense by itself, so I figured I’d just post what I had finished! Wanted to post a short update before I really get cracking on some longer fics
“It was my pleasure. I hope you enjoyed my cookies as well.”
Dean lay on the couch and stared at the ceiling. He tried counting the lines in the wood. He started drumming ‘Africa’ on his belly. He sighed melodramatically and threw an arm over his face, blindly groped for the bowl of truffles he knew was on the coffee table.
how angry your stomach is at you-" Dean's belly interrupted with a pitiful gurgle "-and yet you're still sitting there, stuffing your face."
When they woke up the next morning, it was to a snow day. Westfield generally didn't call off classes for weather, but the power was down and it was
"I am aware. Now please, let go of my neck. I have a lardass boyfriend who I need to buy clothes for -
A week passed, and then another. Hiding his belly was one thing, but by the time Dean was two months into his new diet-less life, he found that his little double chin didn’t just appear when he looked down anymore. Dean stopped shaving in the hopes that a beard would cover the way his chin had settled into a pocket of fat. In the meantime, he scrambled from the elevator to his office as quickly as possible in the mornings, ate lunch by himself, and thanked who or whatever was watching out for him that he didn’t have a meeting until the next Friday.
. Sam looked like he wanted to sink into the ground. Dean just continued to rub his own gut, eyes closed.
There were still two burgers and a rather large brownie on his plate, not to mention a glass of coke. And the rest of the ice cream.
High School baseball AU, chubby!Dean/Cas. Cas is the team captain, Dean’s the new kid, and I’ve only seen like 4 baseball games in my life, so this might be 100% incorrect.
His breath came in harsh pants and he could practically feel Cas’s eyes glued to him, and he subconsciously tried to regulate his breathing. Stupid crush. It was almost soothing to Dean that it was one-sided, made it a little less unbearable when another stupendous belch escaped his mouth without permission. God,
ABO non-hunting AU. Alpha!Cas and omega!Dean go to the Kansas State Fair. Warning for mpreg, which I honestly never thought I’d write, but here we are.
“Why not?” Sam shrugged, gesturing at Dean’s torso. “No way in hell will that come together, and I’m not about to let you put that belt thing back on. I’m probably a size up from you.”
with the added weight. Not that Dean wasn't beautiful without it, but something about the new softness and curviness to his features hit Cas in just the right spot.
“Shit,” Dean gasped, his eyes sliding closed. He pawed at the back of Cain’s head until he got the message and trailed his lips lower down Dean’s body, only stopping when he was tonguing at Dean’s tits through the wet, sheer fabric of his bra. Cain lightly bit down and a high-pitched whine escaped his mouth, but he was too far gone to care.
"Oh," Dean breathed, and he squeezed Cas's love handles reverently. "Yeah, uh- yeah, I'll try it on in a bit. Just gimme a minute."
"Dude, no offense, but you're mom's completely, abso-fuckin-lutely wrong," Dean managed to get out around a huge mouthful of burger. "Eating one measly slice of pie ain't about to 'enslave you to a life of gluttony,' or whatever the hell she says. Now grow a pair and eat the damn pie."
Eventually the hunt for a new uniform began in earnest, because there weren’t exactly a lot of Dean’s size lying around.
Shaking himself out of his reverie, Cas searched his mind for an answer to Dean's question and found that no, Dean didn't look particularly evil, nor was he a bad person. He was kind, caring, and compassionate, despite his love for bloody video games and greasy food. If Hell was filled with people like Dean, Cas decided, then Heaven must be incredibly boring.
Dean snorted, but judging by the look on the guy’s face, he didn't even know what he was saying. Fucking hell.
Dean slid into his boxer briefs and went through the now familiar process of tugging them past his thighs and snapping the waistband into place far below his actual waist. They still pinched, too small for his current physique, but Dean refused to buy new underwear (or shirts, or suit jackets, or pajamas, or jeans) because that would mean admitting defeat. He’d only bought new slacks because the situation had been dire, though he probably needed to do so again sooner rather than later.
The day sped by, unfortunately, and it was last period before Cas knew it. He lined up with the rest of the class, listened to the lecture about what a 'qualifying time' was - like Cas would make a seven minute mile, right - and eyed the clock nervously. Forty-five minutes of class left, and Cas took about fifteen minutes to run five laps. There was no way he'd finish in time. Wait, what happened if he didn't finish in time?
his body, but sometimes he got tired of his belly always getting in the way. But, of course, Dean realized that he had to get used to it. He loved being fat too much to lose any weight, and he loved food too much to stop
Sam’s face lit up when he noticed him and Dean managed to force a smile. Most of him was happy to see his friend again; it was just that his stomach wasn’t, and it was being very vocal.
“I love you,” Dean said when he returned, and although Cas was pretty sure he was talking to the food, he’d take it. He slid in next to Dean, pressed up closer than strictly necessary along his soft side, and stole a fry. The cheesy goodness was worth the look of betrayal Dean shot his way.
“Of course not,” Cas said with a snort. He started to rub his hand in little circles, and Dean sighed. “Honestly, my main reservation was the fact that you’re out of my league, but-“
: It’s a Terrible Life AU, Smith/Wesson, chubby!Dean
He kind of looked like an overstuffed sausage or overfilled balloon, like he was poured into these pants and allowed to ooze out wherever they weren’t. He spilled over the waistband in the front, sides, and even the goddamn back, and yeah, the tight jeans probably made him look bigger than he actually was, but. Wow. He had to have gained thirty, forty pounds, and he was man enough to admit that he hadn’t been a twig before that. He was looking seriously chunky.
"Um," he said, "what is a 'blowjob'?"
Dean gave in and finished the rice and beef. It was hard to breathe, the sheer amount of food crammed into his belly diminishing his lung capacity, and Dean was balancing on the thin line between pleasure and pain, everything in him warning against more food. But he couldn’t stop now, he was almost done, so Dean scarfed down the rest of the chicken and the last egg roll and all three fortune cookies and leaned back in his chair, firmly on the pain side of the line. Oh, he shouldn’t have done that. His insides gurgled and Dean couldn’t even give himself a belly rub at this point, as any pressure on his middle registered as painful. A loud belch escaped his mouth and Dean couldn’t find it in himself to be embarrassed. He could see and feel how bloated his stomach was, angry red stretch marks striping up and down the abused, taut skin. It was packed hard with food and felt heavy, and yeah, Dean tended to overeat, but this was ridiculous. And it
A week into his staycation, Dean sucked it up and went to the store. He'd been cooking a lot and they had next to nothing left in the fridge, so he pulled pair of sweatpants on over his cast, threw on a flannel, grabbed his keys and crutch, and slowly made his way to the garage. Only his left leg was broken, thank god, but it still made getting in and out of the car a little awkward.
An astounding burp surprised even Dean, ruining the moment. “Excuse me,” he mumbled, but Sam just laughed and continued rubbing.
Dean was still fat, kind of insecure, and he didn’t know what to do about work, how to lose the extra weight, or even
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean generally ordered some combination of a dozen goodies and pastries to eat while he was at the bakery, varying between their pies and cupcakes and muffins and croissants depending on his mood, plus the free cookie he always got. He'd devour it all, table moved as far away from him as possible but always a light pressure against his gigantic gut, the increased breathing room still not enough to leave him entirely comfortable. Still, the slight discomfort and humiliation was nothing compared to the fantastic view of the cashier his seat provided, and even when he wasn't working, Dean needed to stay at the bakery to eat anyway. He couldn't exactly carry a dozen sweets
"Yes, please," Castiel said without thinking.
"I-I could let those out, uh, if you want," Dean stammered, avoiding eye contact. "Done it a lot for me and my family."
Dean complied, putting his hand in Sam's and taking a deep breath. Sam noticed that Dean's belly didn't actually move at all, but Dean looked like he was trying really hard to suck his gut in, so Sam sucked it up and just
"Glad to hear it," Benny said with a hearty chuckle, not-so-secretly eyeing the spot where Dean's hand rested on his belly. "Think I'm gonna call it the Leviathan. Want the rest? I can't start sellin' it now - too late in the day - and I sure as hell can't eat a whole pie by myself."
league? Dude, other way around. I’ve had a middle school crush on you since you walked through the door.”
He took off the jacket in the car, and yeah, there was the button. It clattered to the floor and Dean could feel it staring at him as he felt for the hole along his front. He sighed, unbuttoned his jeans, and another popped off.
It started out slowly, but Cas noticed right away. The softening of Dean's jawline. The slight curve under his t-shirts. The added roundness to his cheeks, and the way that smiling emphasized his soft chin. Cas didn't say anything, but oh yes. He noticed.
Dean looked at Cas with hooded eyes and a shit-eating grin, his bare belly pressed up against the table. “Baby wants ice cream,” he said decisively, and Castiel couldn’t help but think that he was the luckiest man on Earth.
he doing to himself?
“I would love to see a Dean/Cas fic with a really big Dean. 400+ lb, and Cas LOVES it. Especially his huge belly, Cas just can't get enough. Stuffing at a buffet or food court and then home for sexytimes, or maybe they're not together initially, they work at the same office, Cas keeps bringing in food/cake and leaving it in the break room "for whoever" knowing Dean will indulge...”
Their cute waiter came back with Sam's water and Dean's milkshakes, setting Sam's drink in front of him while he held the two shakes awkwardly. He seemed unsure as to where to set the shakes, as Dean's belly took up most of his dining area.
Thankfully, Dean’s abundance of striped and patterned shirts helped hide the full extent of his weight gain from the general public, though the same could not be said about his pants. During the week he’d started having to button his slacks beneath his rounded tummy, let it push over his waistband, and he hated the way it made his stomach bulge out, how it made him look bigger than he really was. Dean had started to self-consciously tug at his shirts when he sat, tried to avoid looking down and showing off his double chin. He sucked his stomach in during presentations, slouched when sitting to hide his protruding middle, and was miserable by the time his end of the week get together with Sam rolled around. It was kind of difficult not to feel insecure, no matter what Sam said.
“Will do, boss man.” Cain sighed and Dean just winked. He also craned his neck around to stare at his boyfriend’s ass in those suit pants as he walked away, but hey, he was only human. And Cain may have been a good dozen years older than him but god
Their first real date - not counting all the time Dean spent at Devilish Delights - was at Benny's apartment, which was on the first floor of the building to the bakery's left. Thank

From that point on, Dean and Cas were inseparable. They walked together, talked together, ate together, practiced together, and were generally disgustingly adorable. They’d go to the local diner after practices and share a milkshake, and then Dean would have another to himself, claiming he was a growing boy.
It was Thursday.
Dean sniffed. Okay, that was a lot more than he’d expected. “You callin’ me an idiot?” he joked, watery.
Humming, Cas moved to Dean's other pec - though they really were tits now, soft and flabby, resting on Dean's big hunk of a belly - and put his mouth around the nipple, licking and biting harshly. Dean gave an embarrassing whine, lost in pleasure, his dick hard enough to pound nails.
Cas suddenly sat up, and Dean made a desperate little noise. "Cas," he choked out, "what're you- what're you doin'?"
They grabbed some bigger underwear and were on the way to the checkout when Cas noticed Dean eyeing the women's lingerie. He didn't say anything, but it gave him an idea for Dean's birthday present, and when they got back to Dean's house, he placed a custom order on a women's clothing site.
“Do you need assistance?” Cas asked, and Dean’s face burned even hotter.
Lunch breaks were pretty lax at the garage, so Dean was allowed an hour or so as long as he kept one eye on the front desk; someone else would take calls, and there was a little sign telling people to head straight to the garage that Dean put up when he wasn’t there. Still, despite having ample time, he managed to crush the first pie in ten minutes, the gnawing hunger in his belly not settling for anything else. Once his stomach was sated, Dean took his time, leisurely taking bites of pizza and gulps of coke as he talked to Cas, just savoring the flavors and textures (and company) at this point. Dean asked about Cas’s classes, Cas asked about Dean’s brother, and the conversation flowed smoothly up until Dean finished his second pizza.
But until the problem was solved, Dean couldn’t exactly go without pants. There was a case nearby, and while Dean probably could have gotten away with lazing around in his robe otherwise, he’d already told Sam that he and Cas would take care of it. And these were his only clean pair of jeans.
"You call that a sit-up? You barely got your back off the ground," he barked, which was untrue, as Cas really had tried to sit up as far as he could before his gut got in the way. "Stand up!"
“Whatever, Smith.”
When Dean went into work on Monday, he was pleased to note that gossip about him was back down to its normal levels. Between his beard, which was finally growing in, and his compression belt and tank, it looked like Dean had slimmed down.
. After about ten minutes of this routine, Dean felt like he was ready to tackle dessert.
He struggled to sit up a little more, knowing that it would be a bit of a chore to get to his wallet. Dean still kept everything - wallet, change, keys - in his front pockets, even though he couldn't really reach them anymore. It was usually quite difficult to get things from his pockets, but tonight Dean was grateful; his belly was already out of the way, so all he had to do was reach underneath.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Besides,” Dean said with a smirk, snapping Castiel out of his thoughts, “we all know you’re the trophy wife anyway.”
didn’t insist on stuffing me all the time.”
“I asked if you’re feeling okay,” Sam said with a raised eyebrow, looking pointedly down at their food. “You’re a pretty shitty conversationalist tonight, not to mention the fact that you’ve only eaten like a third of what you usually eat. And you always love hearing about the IT gossip. What gives, dude?”
Though he hummed in agreement, Cas begged to differ. Dean’s facial features were soft, his lips plush and pink, and he was the owner of a rather generous set of curves. His hips and belly were thick enough that they almost spanned the width of his wide shoulders, and his pecs had softened into two little handfuls that rested on his gut. Although the beard and muscles and deep voice clearly marked Dean as a man, his round, curvy body had softened his edges, made him a little more feminine-looking, and he truly was beautiful.
Cas raised his eyebrow right back and put a hand to his flat stomach. “I am fully aware, not to mention absolutely starving.”
Dean slumped back in his chair with a sigh as Cas began rubbing, spreading his legs wide. Cas rucked his shirt up above his belly and stroked angry-looking stretch marks with his fingers as his hands worked. It really was amazing, Cas thought, how big Dean had gotten in only two and a half years.
Dean used both his hands to rub his stuffed gut down. He could feel the hard ball of his stomach underneath the many layers of his fat, and he smiled a little, because even when he was full to bursting, his stomach wasn't completely hard. It was too big and soft and had too many rolls for that to ever happen.
“Higher.”
Dean was tired, hurting, embarrassed, and angry, so he couldn’t stop himself from snapping, “It’s because I’m fucking fat, okay? I can’t stop eating — I don’t
Prompt from Boo: "Dean and Cas meet in residence, Cas has just gotten away from his stifling, uber religious family that never let him eat junk food or really enjoy food cuz blah blah gluttony blah blah sin (also homophobic as fuck family). But he’s got a full ride to school, money in the bank from a trust fund and a roomie in Dean that is all to eager to intro the art of decadence into his cute roomie’s new free life. Also, maybe Dean and family range from a bit chubby/stocky/well fed, but Cas leapfrogs them in no time."
"G-gladly, sir," the cute waiter stuttered. Sam ordered a water - what a fuckin' loser, how were they even related - and the waiter smiled shyly at Dean before he walked away. Dean craned his neck to watch him go. Damn, tight ass too. And was it Dean's imagination, or had the waiter seemed interested in him, too?
“So full,” he whispered as he gently rubbed, and Dean whimpered quietly. “No wonder you’ve got this big old belly, eating like this.”
Cas shut down that train of thought quickly as Dean came back with two more slices of dessert and a bag of Doritos. Chocolate cake this time. He set them down in front of Cas and opened the bag of chips for himself, crunching loudly, not caring about the mess he made. The steady motion of his hand to his mouth never varied, and Castiel stared.
Dean, mouth still open slightly, brought his hands up to delicately cup Cas's breasts, almost as if he was afraid to touch them, pupils blown so wide that only a slim ring of green was left around them. "It must be, uh- must be my birthday or somethin'," he joked weakly, slowly raking his eyes down Cas's body. A low moan tore from his throat when he noticed Cas's panties, and he trailed his hands down to play with the lace. "Holy shit, Cas."
That was probably 130 pounds ago.
coming back here.
"Because you're usually all about working out," Sam said with a smirk, and goddammit, Dean didn't need to take this shit, even if he could usually brush off Sam's teasing easily. He grabbed his crutch angrily, pushed himself off the couch, and hobbled as quickly as he could away from Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Asshole.
"Just give 'em here, sweetheart. I'll double fist 'em," Dean said with a laugh. The waiter flushed again - and again, how goddamn
Yeah, Dean liked Cas a
He finished his third plate quickly and took some plates from their waiter, stacking three of the full plates on top of the three empty ones. But there were still three plates left, and not much space. Dean thought for a moment. What the hell was he supposed to do?
," Cas said loudly, effectively cutting off his rant. "I know. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be hurtful. The extra weight looks quite good on you, actually."
glared up at him, and Dean had
"Aw, Cas, don't worry," Dean said with a snort as he pulled the remains of Cas' cake towards himself. "They have cake here every day."
As he started rubbing at Dean’s back, Cas snorted. Dean had been fat for years; he’d started using ‘baby weight’ as an excuse a few months ago, and while it was partially true - he’d probably put on eighty, ninety pounds over the course of his pregnancy - Dean was only just beginning his third trimester. Most omegas had only gained around twenty pounds at this point.
Cas sighed. "We're both idiots, aren't we."
Just eight or nine years ago, Cas had been an angel of the Lord, able to move at the speed of light, to fly wherever he wanted within seconds. Now he was human, unable to walk a dozen paces without needing a rest, so fat that he couldn’t even get his belly rubbed without difficulty. He should be ashamed of himself.
Huh. Yeah, looking back, it was kind of obvious. “I thought he was just a friend,” Dean defended weakly, and Sam laughed.
“You know,” Castiel pointed out, “you didn’t exactly have to eat everything I gave you, at your house or the diner.”
Although Dean bristled at the implications, he knew Sam was right. Even if he did manage to work the weight off (and that was a big if at this point) he needed to actually fit into his clothes. “Okay,” he said, and Sam lit up. “But I thought your parents were in town?”
"Uh, blueberry-blackberry crumble," Benny said, face pink but smile wide. "You really like it, sugar?" And oh, they'd progressed from 'brothah' to 'sugah,' Dean liked this. He liked it a lot.
Spotting a pair hidden in his many slacks, Dean dug around and snagged the jersey-like material. He checked the tag apprehensively and discovered that they were a size medium, grit his teeth, and pulled them on anyway, figuring that the elastic would help. And it kind of did, but he still had to situate the waistband under his stomach. His love handles swelled over the sides, previously slim thighs now pulled the fabric tight, and his gut stuck out in a stretch-marked mound and refused to submit to the waistband. The shorts even felt tight across the ass, so Dean had to be putting on weight there, too, which was rare for him. Hopefully the shirt would cover most of it.
The pizza was gone within the hour. Dean burped loudly and scratched his bare belly, stuffed, sated, and sleepy. One of the great things about being home alone was getting to be as gross as he wanted without Sam's bitchface popping up everywhere, and Dean could laze around in his underwear and do whatever he wanted. The bunker was a judgement-free zone for the next couple weeks, and Dean was planning on taking full advantage of the fact.
It was gonna be a long night.
"Please-"
Dean snorted. Yeah, sure. He ate another chicken wing (had Sam touched the plate at all?) and sighed, because at least he could eat wings again.
, Mary Winchester supporting him, a bum knee the result of a fight he didn’t remember with an entity he couldn’t name. Dean had greeted him with a rather enthusiastic kiss, and that was how almost a decade of tension was resolved in the span of thirty seconds.
Checking his watch again, Sam noticed that it was now 7:24. The restaurant had a cancellation policy for reservations missed by half an hour or more. Ignoring his ongoing embarrassment, Sam said, "Dammit, Dean! Fine, look, I'll push your stomach in with one hand and pull with the other. Suck in as hard as you can and give me a hand."
"Yeah, whatever," Sam mumbled, annoyed once again. "You can thank me later, cause we need to get a move on. Our reservation was for almost half an hour ago, Dean." Sam started walking quickly toward the restaurant's entrance, expecting Dean to be close behind.
Dean gave another long sigh as he readjusted his tight leather pants and clingy vest. Part of the 'uniform,' if it could even be called that. All workers at Purgatory wore some outfit of leather, lace, or both, and Dean was just glad he wasn't in the frilly getup that Victor had to wear. Poor guy had to chafe like a bitch.
"But Sammy, I'm too fat," Dean moaned. "It'll take me forever!"
He wrapped his lips around the second shot, keeping eye contact with Dean once again, and Dean could feel his dick press into his gut insistently. Dean pressed his belly into the counter and gave a low groan at the increased pressure.
“You don’t have a double chin,” Sam protested, but Dean knew the truth. His belly and face took the brunt of his weight gain, always had. Dean’d had a slightly pudgy chin even when he’d been in the best shape of his life, and the pounds he’d added onto his frame in the past month and a half weren’t exactly helping. No amount of cleansing had ever gotten rid of the thin layer of padding around his middle either, and he was getting softer by the day.
Dean huffed and puffed, his face tinted red, sweat rolling down his temples both from the Kansas heat and the exertion of eating so much.  But he didn’t seem to be slowing down any time soon; Dean still ate like a starving man, a corn dog in each hand, and he only stopped eating long enough to direct Castiel’s hands, or maybe to take a sip of coke. Cas knew they made an odd pair, the fat, bossy omega and the lean, submissive alpha, but he loved nothing more than doting on Dean. If that made him look like a chump to some people, then so be it.
Dean. "It's cool, man. It's- it's totally fine, don't worry about it. Happens all the time." Normally Dean would have tried to keep up his gruff, tough guy facade, but something about this dude made him short circuit a bit.
"This is one of the best pies I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot of pie," Dean said with a wink, shoveling another bite in his mouth with one hand as he slapped his gut with the other.
But then Sam kissed a spot right above Dean’s belly button, and Dean’s breath hitched. Did he...?
Cain obliged and thumbed at Dean’s bottom lip when he pulled away. “Oh yes. I couldn’t focus at all, and I had to cut the meeting off right in the middle of Crowley’s dreadful pitch about some bad idea or another.”
Though he was panting uncomfortably by the end of his plate, Dean managed to finish all the food. He leaned back in his chair with a groan, and Cas snuck a hand onto Dean’s belly under the table, never pausing in the polite conversation he was having with Mrs. Winchester.
: ABO non-hunting AU, alpha!Cas, omega!Dean, fat!Dean, mpreg
He leaned down and licked the hard line of Dean's dick through his tight pants. Dean choked and put his hands back on Cas's head, tugging his hair harshly, desperate for some direct contact. Cas slipped his fingers in the tight waistband and tugged it down so that only Dean's cock and balls were out. His dick slapped wetly against the underside of his gut and he grunted, beyond ready.
