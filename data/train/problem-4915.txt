“I’ve always been like this, in my head,” Steve responds, deciding not to let anything ruin the moment. He resists Bucky’s instinct to pull away, tightening his hold on his hand and pulling him back in closer. Bucky doesn’t really resist, closing his eyes as Steve runs his other hand gently through Bucky’s hair. “Tony just made me feel all right with saying it. With saying what it is I want, with being who I am.”
“I was even going to take you to Serendipity for frozen hot chocolate afterward, so you could live that movie you inexplicably adore.”
underneath the pads of his fingers as he tries to imagine Howard sitting in this very spot.  “They do like their tradition.”
“Maybe I had too much to drink after all.” He mumbles, his brow furrowing. Tony wants to take him in his arms and kiss that worry away. “I should probably…” He gestures inside.
“What are you good for? Huh, Cap?  Why try so hard to keep it together?  For Fury?  Afraid he won’t let you lead the team if you show a little weakness?”
“I want to.” Steve assures him, lifting his head and pulling Bucky down to meet him halfway. “Wanted to for so long.” They kiss with renewed fervor, their entire bodies behind it now.
“Only weird if we let it be.” He replies with a slight shrug. Steve shoots him another look. It’s not that simple, even if Tony believes it. “Here, let me guess: then he jumped you?” Tony theorizes as Steve waffles. “I mean, that’s what he said he was going to do.”
“You know, that cat’s getting mighty uppity for being on the street only a few weeks ago,” Tony comments as the tabby stalks away, tail up in the air.  “So, you were saying…”
“It’ll keep ‘til morning.”  His hands go to Steve’s hips and guide him backward toward the hallway, toward the stairs.
“That’s…yeah.  Okay.”  Tony processes this information, wishing he were there instead.  Right now, Nat’s probably one of the last people Steve would want to deal with.  But at least he’s in one piece.  “Okay.  Good.  But other than that…?”
“Can’t believe that.”  Tony really can’t.  He can’t imagine Steve longing for him this way.  “Since when?”
Steve is swimming.  It’s midnight and Tony should be taking advantage of the workshop the Malibu house has to offer, but here he is standing stock still in his living room, looking down as Steve completes lap after lap after lap.
“This isn’t a good idea.”  Tony won’t look at him and Steve sags back against the wall, drawing in a deep breath and trying to get his thoughts in some kind of order.  He can’t
“You smell like the bottom of a bottle,” Steve comments, not exactly criticizing, more observing.  Tony nods, knowing Steve can feel the inaudible response.  Steve sighs softly and then reaches to set his paintbrush down on the easel’s edge.  “Have you eaten anything tonight?  Let me heat up that leftover lentil chili.”
Fury and Sam exchange a weighted look that Steve doesn’t miss but chooses not to comment upon. Steve knows it’s about him—they’re anything but subtle—and he knows he’s not acting like himself, but he can’t bring himself to care.
He strips off his tie and shirt, then undoes his pants and lets them drop to the floor. The belt buckle clangs as it hits the ground and there’s another thud that makes him realize he’d left his phone in his pocket. On any other night he’d strip bare and slink into bed, press the warmth of his body against Steve’s curved back and slim hips, but tonight’s not any other night.
“We were actually lucky compared to the other boys – at least we were used to sharing a bunk more often than not.”
“She won’t be all that concerned,” Tony replies.  It doesn’t hit him at first that Steve might not know.  Steve’s forehead wrinkles in confusion and Tony realizes that Steve hasn’t a clue.  “She’s gone, Steve.”
“I’m going back to bed,” Natasha tells Steve, ignoring Pepper.  She’s pissed at Tony and anyone associated with Tony, and the look of warning she gives him tells him to be careful.  “Wake us up when she’s gone.”
in New York, Tony?” Steve interrupts, nearly closing the space between them with two broad steps forward. “Just tell me what happened. Or whatever it was that I did to drive you away.”
“I haven’t done a nude portrait of Tony,” He manages to say without sounding ridiculously defensive, looking around the room at everyone and hoping they believe him.  “I really
“No.  They fought about Steve.”  Tony shuts down the memory quickly.  That’s what happens when the door gets open; anything can come out.  He points to his empty glass and is poured another.  Pepper picks up her martini and stirs the clear liquid with her spear of olives, being carefully silent.  He’s pretty much answered his own question as to whether or not he should tell Steve.  “So I’ll just keep that lovely little story to myself then.”
But Steve clenches hard around him, so tight, so good, pulling his orgasm from him whether he wanted to let go or not. Tony’s teeth cut sharply into his bottom lip as he stifles his shout.
“Well. That’s a first,” Tony comments, amused. The mood has broken, shifting away from whatever intense intimacy they’d just fallen into. “Guess we should be lucky we didn’t break the pipes.”
“I can always eat,” Steve lies anyway. Tony gives him a long look but doesn’t challenge him on it. He uses his grip on Steve’s leg for leverage as he pushes to stand up. Feeling exposed in the light of day, Steve draws the white sheet over his lap and around his waist.
“Yeah.  I get it.”  Barnes says quietly.  Tony nods, and at least Steve manages to give him a small nod in return.
“I’ve spent the whole night trying desperately hard to be a grown-up.” Tony rocks a little on his heels, antsy as he explains himself.  “One more twenty year old model or Hollywood ingénue undressing you with their eyes and I might have lost the battle.  I was about to grab some starlet’s bright red lipstick and write
I wasn’t about to give the designs to the Germans, and I’m not about to give them to the U.S. government either.” He’s not sure who he’d trust less with his advanced weaponry.
“Carry on then.”  Tony waves with an imperious air, sauntering toward the elevator.  “Just be careful of rusty nails, don’t know if super soldiers are immune to tetanus.”
“As in Viastone? So all you rich folks just know each other then,” Bucky scoffs contemptuously. Jan takes no offense.
“As it’s a matter of national security, I have already briefed your team members with the basic details.  However, this case is of particular interest to you and if you prefer, I can have the room cleared while we discuss this.”
“Happy, you don’t mind if I sit back here just this once, do you? It’s not, I don’t mean—” Steve starts then stops, hand gripping the edge of the car door tightly. Happy looks at Steve for only a moment and nods quickly, unaffronted and understanding. Steve clearly isn’t up for friendly conversation tonight.
“I know how to dance.”  Tony announces, unbuttoning and rolling up his sleeves like he’s gonna teach Steve how to box instead of box step.  With his hands he beckons Steve closer.  Steve smiles awkwardly, getting what Tony’s trying to accomplish here, but feeling rather silly about it.
He nearly drowns in it, saved only by Natasha gripping his hand tightly underneath the table, her fingers squeezing hard and pulling him back in.
“Agent Barton mentioned the lady in passing as a possible alien invader – and yes, I did realize he was joking –” Steve cuts Tony off before he can interject.   “And Agent Romanoff provided the iPod-”
Steve thanks Happy for the ride, opting to walk the short, stone driveway up to the arched doorway. The lobby is small, and despite the large windows, it is rather dark now that the sun has dipped below the hills. It’s not uninviting however, as the table lamps are all shaded with golden yellow glass or beige linen, throwing pockets of warm light over richly upholstered chairs and dark cherry wood tables.
Bucky answers.  He’s shirtless, his hair wet, a toothbrush hanging out of the corner of his mouth.  He simply looks at Tony for a beat before opening the door all the way and motioning for him to come in.
Redemption cannot be his, but he knows enough to see he was the tool and not the hand. The hand must be slaughtered.
“I’m…I’m where I should be.” His words go slightly soft at this, then it's back to that formal tone he began with. “And speaking of where I should be, I really am needed back on my own set, and your people are probably wondering where you are.”
However, as act one pushes into act two, Susan Storm wraps her hand around Tony’s and leans her head on Tony’s shoulder. Tony stiffens at first, just a miniscule amount, but then visibly relaxes. Steve swallows down the bile rising in this throat, offers a quick explanation and a promise to return to Wanda, and climbs up from his seat. Leaving his own premiere is worse than merely looking bored, but if anyone asks later, he’ll merely explain he was in desperate need of some water and it simply couldn’t be helped.
“That’s what this is about?” He doesn’t know how she’s surprised, but he’s not about to get into this with her. What he’s feeling is his business, and only his.
Tony has to admit, this does throw him for a loop. It shouldn’t – people know who he is, it’s not so unbelievable that this stranger would too. Nevertheless, it’s the way the man says his name so crisply, like he knows more about him than his name, that sets Tony off guard.
The door falls gently closed, taking the noise of the nightclub with it, and Steve is left with the soundtrack of the city as somewhere a clock chimes eleven. Further in the distance, there is a mournful wail of police sirens.
“Right now, a benefit. Though I’m half-surprised you didn’t try and walk down the mountain on your own. I’m very glad you’ve lowered the stubborn to a reasonable level.”
“Exercise keeps my mind clear,” Steve replies a bit defensively.  “Besides, Fury’s been limiting my time with the clean up, so I don’t have much else to do.”
She has likened it to clearing the area before a bomb goes off, but he thinks that metaphor’s just a leftover from when she used to work for his father. At the very least, he’s sure he’s a better boss than his old man.
“Buck?” Steve twists to look at her as she disappears behind the dressing screen. “He and Tony don't get on much, but truth is they've barely met but twice.”
His jawline is cut from stone, his cheekbones equally chiseled. At this angle, Tony has yet to see his face in its full glory, but in profile, he’s striking. He still has a fingertip of his tan work glove caught between his teeth, his full, pink lips seeming to mouth something against the leather as he finishes his task.
“Okay, then go clean yourself up, wipe off the flop sweat, and call Steve, would you? I’m sure he’s working himself up real good too, if you’ve been avoiding him all afternoon.”
Control just as quickly shifts to Steve as soon as the door slams shut. Steve holds him against it, mouth on his and his hands roaming everywhere. His long fingers and broad palms slip through Tony’s hair, slide down his arms, smooth over his chest, before finally settling to work at the latch of his belt.
“Tony, that's not being serious. This is your first film. You can’t cast me in the lead role simply because of
“Cigarettes, sure.  But that’s it.”  Tony tilts his head back to look at Steve better, narrowing his eyes.  “What?”
. Tony never thought he’d live to see the day. She just as quickly schools her face into its usual calm repose, but it’s too late, the jig is up.
“You’re in a hotel suite on the 4th floor of the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. You’ve been here for one night. It’s 10 in the morning on Saturday, August 6th, 1949.” Steve nods again, everything registering clearly. He begins to relax, his breathing returning to normal. “I’m Tony Stark, millionaire movie producer and arrogant asshole extraordinaire, and you’re naked because we just fucked each other senseless for
“Did you call him?” Jane inquires, taking the card from Darcy to inspect it herself. Steve doesn’t respond immediately, not sure how to explain why he hasn’t made an overture if it in fact does mean more work. Everyone always wants more work.
?”  Natasha’s off and running as the truth of the situation hits Tony like a freight train.  It’s too late though.
“You don’t say,” Pepper retorts and then laughs, pointing at herself.  “See, there I go again.  It’s my default setting.”
The door here leads directly to the yard.  No patio, nothing but grass.  He leaves the door open behind him.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Tony asks, careful to keep his tone even. He doesn’t want to seem too concerned and alarm Steve, or color what Steve thinks about the situation before he even has time to sort out his own feelings.
Bucky’s right, in his way. Captain America is precisely why he didn’t call Tony Stark. He became Captain America because it was the best option available to him at the time. He became Captain America to do
The question is a betrayal.  They’d had an unspoken agreement – no talk of Howard, no talk of Bucky, and everything would be a-ok with them.  Maybe Tony has been pushing that boundary little by little, but his small nudges gave Steve a chance to nudge him back, put him off.  Steve can’t nudge him back now; he’d have to shove, and shove hard.
“Amazing.”  Tony is anything but interested.  “Well, Wilson, since you’re here, may as well stay for the dime tour.”
He watches Tony now as he stands up, announcing he’s going to the kitchen to grab more beer and he wouldn’t be bringing any back for the lazy bums who invaded movie night.
Steve’s already in Pennsylvania, just his bike and the clothes on his back, before he fully realizes what he’s doing.  When he does, he just revs the engine and keeps on going.
Tony looks at Bucky for this first time since he walked in and saw Bucky beside Steve on the couch, as if just remembering that the other man is even there. Bucky can see that fondness for Steve still shining brightly in his gaze, dimming slightly as he switches his attention.
Tony stops in his tracks, shoes nearly slipping on the wet pavement.  He puts a hand out, steadying himself by grabbing Steve’s wrist.
He regards Tony; briefed or not, Tony’s clearly feeling him out for something.  Steve doesn’t understand what, as Tony can get access to any information he wants easier than ever these days.
Perhaps more awkward than the time his father had tried to explain the birds and the bees to him, had given up not even halfway through, and handed him his first beer instead.
“You need to go to him.” Is what she says. All she says. She sits in the non-functional kitchen of his rundown squat and stares at him like she’s the one who is owed an explanation.
He’d stayed in the dressing room until he was sure Steve had gone. Afterward, he sat and stared at the empty bed with its rumpled sheets for a good long while, the silence of the hotel room oppressive with its loneliness.
“Ever since you saw that photograph of Thor’s, you’ve been pestering me about him non-stop. And now here you are, the two of you, together, and what are you doing?” Jane makes a raspberry noise and makes a
, right?” Tony continues, as simply as if clarifying directions on a road map.  “He said nothing about me.”
“And you really don’t care to make the distinction?” Steve presses. It’s not as if he thinks Loki will ever regret his choices, but it’s hard to believe that anyone could be so vapid and heartless.
“If it means we get him back, I’ll live with that.”  He watches Bruce for a sign of disagreement, a bit of moral protest, but it’s not forthcoming.  It appears Bruce is okay with sacrificing Barnes in order to save Betty as long as Tony’s willing to do the same to save Steve.
The pots and dishes from dinner are soaking in the sink and the empty wine bottles are on the counter. At some point, Bucky had pulled out some leftover key lime pie and a handful of forks, and now all that’s left is crumbs on a plate. It’s well past midnight and despite trying to play pinochle for the past hour, none of them are managing to keep the rules straight. While they’ve had a good time making a mess of it, Nat yawns, tosses her hand of cards to the table, and announces it’s time for her to make her way home. She's the only one sobered up between them.
—accurately, I might add—that for the past month and a half you’ve been looking at me like you want to throw me off this rooftop, and you’ve been looking at Steve like you need him as much as you need the air to breathe.”
“It’s a story for another time.” Steve finally settles on replying, tilting his glass and looking down at his wine in order to avoid Tony’s piercing gaze. He takes a long drink, buying himself some time to figure out what to say next. He could ask Tony about his own childhood, but that hardly seems like a fair tack to take.
He turns to Bruce for confirmation; he’s finally able to see the other man clearly now that his vision isn’t swimming.
“Christ, Steve, I didn’t mean it like that.” Tony blurts, impulsively grabbing Steve’s hand, stopping him from going. Steve doesn’t jerk away, but he freezes at Tony’s touch, staring down to where Tony’s fingers wrap around his. “I didn’t mean…
The new ending rolls out and Tony gives up trying to be discreet. He openly stares at Steve as Steve watches the original closure completely undone by a more ambiguous tag.
“I’m not just thinking with my cock, if that’s what you’re worried about.” Tony’s smirk grows wider. “I thought you would be perfect for the role the second we met, long before we fell into bed.”
Steve leans against the iron railing and concentrates on slowing his breathing, his heartbeat. He hopes that the flush of exertion will fade from his pale skin a bit before he goes inside.
“This isn’t for fun, this isn’t—“ Bucky stops, and Tony suspects it’s because something insulting was on the tip of his tongue. He’s aware that his previous romantic exploits left him with a bit of a reputation, but Bucky has to know by now that he’d never take any part of his relationship with Steve lightly.
The doors smoothly open on an empty car; the lush carpet, ornately decorated walls and bright sconces a jarring juxtaposition with the rough, barely finished tunnel they’ve just left.
Steve ignores the comment and pulls on his underwear and pants. He finds his dress shirt in a crumpled heap halfway underneath the bed. He tries to shake out some of the wrinkles, but it’s hopeless. He looks a frightful mess; Bucky is going to have so many questions when he walks in like this, and Steve doesn’t know how he’s going to explain.
“Look. I didn’t mean to overreact." He rubs his fingers against his stubbled cheek. He must not have bothered to shave, what with searching for Steve's whereabouts. "But this isn’t something you
Tony takes off his jacket and throws it onto one of the chairs, followed by his tie.  Steve watches, confused, as Tony pushes some furniture around and creates an empty space in the center of the living room area.
Tony unfolds his arms and steps down into the sunken living room, glass from the broken windows crunching under his boots; Steve stands, bracing himself for whatever’s about to come next.
“Count me out.”  He loves Steve’s Eggs Benedict but he’s not about to give the man the satisfaction.  “I’ll either be sleeping or in a conference call with the folks in London.”
He doesn’t cry.  But after another half hour, Tony looks bored to tears so Steve takes pity. They wander the Strip for a while, Tony talking and Steve looking.  Tony has a story about almost every single establishment – a girl, a party, a drug, always something.  It’s ostensibly for Steve’s amusement, but Steve doesn’t find it all that amusing.  It’d be much better if Tony would risk being quiet and just be.
“Nah, that’s definitely not it.  Couldn’t care less about that.”  Tony shakes his head, even if his smile undermines the lie.  Steve pulls back anyway, throwing Tony a mock scowl.  He taps one of his tattered Converse-clad feet against one of Tony’s Toms.  “Hey, watch the footwear.”
He considers this when he sees Steve Rogers across a crowded piazza in Venice, so close yet far enough away that he can certainly escape his view and continue on unnoticed. He’s with that other man, the man who had the wings, and they stand comfortably close to one another as they exchange words, as good friends do.
“Tony is waiting for you to put a name to it.” Pepper states, as simply as if she were informing him of a shift in the weather.  Steve’s gaze snaps up toward her, surprised.  “I think…he’s attempting to be respectful of whatever you’re working through with James Barnes.  He doesn’t want to force anything before you’re ready.”
“It’s all right, Tony. I just have to…” Bucky tries to explain it, but the right words won’t come. “It just…it
“So are you, Steve.” Sam holds up his glass in a toast and Steve mirrors him. “So don’t worry about Bucky too much. Whatever’s bothering him, he’ll come around. You two are like blood brothers, ain’t no undoing that.”
He opens his trailer door and looks to the floor expectantly, but there’s no note there. He steps all the way inside, glancing about to see if the paper had slid out of view, but he finds nothing. He ducks back outside, checking the ground. Perhaps it stuck to the bottom of the door and fell to the pavement below, or maybe caught on the metal grating of the stairs.
No sooner had he recovered than Tony came down with it himself, who passed it right back to Steve. Tony says he was careful to keep away, but Bucky knows better, knows Steve. The stubborn prat undoubtedly persisted in caring for Tony the way Tony had cared for him.
“Okay. Well.” Steve isn’t sure what to say, and Tony isn’t helping. He seems preoccupied with dressing, pulling a fresh shirt from one rack before crossing to grab a tie from another. It’s jarring to feel such distance from someone who he’d been so completely lost in just minutes ago. Tony might as well be a stranger, for how connected Steve feels now.
, Mr. Stark, please stop talking.” Peter begs him, burying his head in his arms on top of the table, papers rustling as they are shoved aside.
, this long-lost brother.  So this douche, who’s pissed about his crappy childhood and pissed about being lied to and generally pissed about everything a person can be pissed about, he basically takes his brother hostage and they hit the road.”
“Thought you were going to be on the jogging track,” Tony says by way of greeting, unfolding his arms from over his chest and standing up straight.  One hand fiddles with the knot of his light lavender tie.
“Well, you better call Bucky and tell him that then, Tony, because I’m pretty sure he thinks he drove you away.”
“I can sometimes be an idiot,” Tony mumbles between kisses, lips laying a claim each time they connect with a new expanse of Steve’s warm skin.  “And I’m often an ass.”  Steve laughs, broken and breathless, as Tony moves his mouth down the defined center line of his chest and abs, tongue tracing a trail south.  Steve’s hand is in his hair, fingers threading loosely through the strands.  “But I’ve never been a fool.”
“Like…for Superman?  Batman?” Tony finally prompts, proud of himself for sounding genuinely interested rather than mocking.  His default tone can sometimes be read as mocking.  Or so he’s been told.  Numerous times, by many, many different people.
“No, you’re an idiot.  He wasn’t in your workshop everyday because he needed a place to draw, for chrissakes.  He wanted to be with
His thoughts wander toward Tony as he inches back toward sleep, Natasha’s breathing settling deep and even in time with his.
Accidentally but maybe on purpose, Tony pitches backward slightly, thumping the back of his head against a cabinet and knocking over one of the empty wine bottles behind his arm. It clatters against the countertop but doesn’t break. It’s enough to startle them both into stopping.
“I apologize for not giving you my complete attention, Tony, but see, I haven’t been sleeping all that well.”
Steve folds his large body into a seat a careful distance from where Tony stands. Tony resists his natural contrary urge to close the gap and plop himself down directly beside him.
“I see you found him some clothes on your own,” Pepper comments to Tony as Steve finally reaches them.  He doesn’t look that surprised to see Pepper, which is weird because Tony never mentioned that she’d be showing up.
“I believe in magic.” Thor states and Steve hears both Clint and Natasha humming the Lovin’ Spoonful at the exact same time.  Sometimes he’s positive those two share the same brain.
Tony ignores the niggling sensation in the back of his mind that keeps insisting that the issue with the serum should trump his personal matters.  He takes Pepper in his arms, forcing himself to focus instead on the feeling of her slender body fitting against his, her skin warm beneath his fingertips.  Her hair smells like lavender.
“I have a couple somewhere, I’ll dig ‘em out.”  Tony says off-handedly and Steve stops what he’s doing, unable to keep from staring at Tony in dismay.  “
“Haven’t given it much thought.  Get you to stay in bed past six am?  That would take some work.”  Tony laughs.  “What’s yours?”
“You put anyone else in that machine and that experiment would’ve gone sideways.  It had to be Steve.  And maybe my dad did realize that, after Steve was gone, that Steve wasn’t just some guy he beefed up into a super soldier but that a truly good man had willingly sacrificed his life for the world.  And maybe that’s why Howard was the way he was.  Because he got to go on living and Steve died and he realized too late it should’ve been the other way around.  Or maybe Steve had nothing to do with it at all, and Howard was Howard and that’s it.  I can’t pretend I understand.”
“How’d that happen? I would’ve thought no one would touch him with a ten foot pole after what went down,” Morita comments, and after the others nod in agreement, one by one they all pause and then look at him.
He remembers the first time they kiss, hot and sticky on a Fourth of July, Steve’s lips cold and tasting like cherry popsicles. He remembers when Steve’s mother dies, and when he tells Steve he’s been called up and Steve cries tears of rage and frustration at not being able to follow. He remembers fucking Steve on a lumpy bedroll in some drafty tent, smothering muffled
“Nevermind.”  Tony wanders further, tapping his fingers across the sill as he passes the window, which is propped half-open to cool the joint down.  The night’s too warm for that to do much good though.  He doubts Steve would want to install an air conditioner, if he even knows what one is.  A few potted plants sit on the rusted metal grating of the fire escape; a short clothesline is strung up, white t-shirts pinned and fluttering slightly in the barely there breeze.  He holds back a snort at the thought of Steve likely cleaning them using a washboard in the kitchen sink.
“Hmmm?”  Tony drags his gaze away from Steve and finds Pepper standing at the other end of the large window.  She’s staring at him solemnly, and he wonders how long she’s been standing there, watching him watch Steve.  Because in all honesty he doesn’t have any idea how long he’s been staring this time and it could be hard to explain away.
on New York hot shots swanning into Hollywood thinking they can fix it.” Natasha cuts in, rolling her eyes, evidently familiar with Bucky’s diatribes from other occasions. She saunters toward Steve and takes a seat on the armrest beside him. Her long fingers curl over his shoulder, her arm a reassuring weight against his back. Her position might seem improper and casual, perhaps even too intimate, if taken by someone else, but she makes it look perfectly acceptable.
Steve Rogers now has five other people he answers to before his own desire to find James Barnes, five other people who rate a higher priority than his personal, private mission.
Nevertheless, he follows the blond man, the one whose name he has not been told, through the capital city streets with little difficulty.  When they wind up back at the man’s apartment, he’s almost annoyed, because if he’d known the man was simply going to return
“JARVIS.  JARVIS!”  Tony is shouting to no one.  He’s plummeting and the helicopter is getting further away.  It was an EMP, he knows it, but he’d worked around that.  An electromagnetic pulse shouldn’t affect his suit.  This isn’t supposed to be happening.
“That’s what I wanted too.” Steve smiles faintly and Tony squeezes his arm, smiling back. “And I really do think I want to give this movie thing a try.”
“Natasha,” He sighs, making a face.  “But Bucky’s the one who told me to look in the drawer if this ever happened, so…”
Steve backs away from the both of them, and Tony wants to say something, anything, but he doesn’t want to make this worse.  There are so many ways to fuck this up.  If it’s not already ruined.
For a terrifying second, Tony thinks Barnes is going to take a shot.  His finger twitches on the trigger.  But he stops, for which Tony thanks god because Steve doesn’t need to deal with Barnes, of all people, attempting to kill his own team member.
“Not the Stark Industries file, Tony.  The one in my head that features such brilliant gems like the two strippers in Reno –“
“So you’re saying, what, what – that he was brainwashed into coming here and drawing Steve out and now he can’t talk about it?  That’s fucking ridiculous.”  Tony clenches and unclenches his fists.  He doesn’t know how Bruce is standing still.   Isn’t Bruce supposed to be anger incarnate?  How is Bruce keeping his head when Tony can barely see through his rage? He has to come up with a plan.  He’s usually so good at this, at keeping cool and seeing things exactly for what they are, at being two steps ahead.  Why can’t he think of a goddamned plan?
“I’ll give you some privacy.” She rubs his shoulder comfortingly as she passes, heading back toward one of the plane’s other rooms.
“That bad, huh. See, I wouldn’t know. Steve won’t say boo about anybody. Not even Tony Stark.” Steve shoots Bucky a look over his shoulder, cottoning on to what Bucky’s doing—going on a fishing expedition. He’s been wary of Tony from the start, and that suspicion only grew worse once Steve decided to star in Tony’s picture.
“Team effort.  Yay.”  Tony chuckles with a half-hearted cheer, trying to take the note back.  Steve makes a move to crumple it up and toss it aside but Tony grabs it, straightening the crinkled paper out.  He sets it on the nightstand as Steve lifts an eyebrow, confused.  “Hey, Cap, I plan on taking that seriously.”
“I thought she was attached to Reed Richards,” Wanda murmurs beside him with an air of judgment lacing her tone. “I thought they were
She leans in and presses a soft kiss to his cheek.  He recognizes it for the blessing it is, but he doesn’t know if he can live up to its promise.
“Depends. If you think it’s a way to increase the width capabilities of the image, then yes, it’s what you think it is.” Bruce mumbles, distracted, as he sets back to work on the camera in front of him.
“I’m rather used to things not going as expected,” Steve replies, looking back down at the woman in his arms. Wanda scowls at him, albeit more playfully than angrily, and flicks up the end of his tie as she steps away.
She asks about where he went before Tony caught up with him and he tells her, which is more than Tony’s been able to make him do.  They make plans to visit the MoMA when he gets back to New York, which is the first time Tony’s heard Steve even mention going back home.  It’s immediately obvious that Pepper needs no prompting to be Steve’s friend, and he wonders how long she’s been avoiding the connection out of deference to Tony.
“Why are you carrying this ratty thing around? Looks beat to hell. Is it a treasured keepsake from a lady friend, you old dog? I bet you –” Darcy stops, taking in the name written on the card. “Tony Stark? Who are you
“Tell me how you really feel,” Tony snipes at her coldly. Steve opens his mouth to defend her, but the look Jan shoots his way reminds him that she can well take care of herself.
He shoves down Steve’s pants just enough to get his length free, waistband tucked snugly underneath Steve’s balls. When Steve was changed back to his pre-serum self, Tony had honestly been
“Thought I’d take a longer route today.  What’s wrong?”  Steve doesn’t dally, quickly closing the space left between them.  It’s obvious Tony, dressed in a sharp suit and Italian loafers, isn’t here to join him on his run.
“You can’t get the clap from sitting on a bed,” Steve comments unhelpfully, nevertheless heeding Tony and standing up.  His towel slips a little and he pulls it tighter.
“What brings you here, Jan?” Bucky asks, shooting a look at Steve over her head that really directs the question at him.
“Compared to what?”  Pepper replies without missing a beat, turning around to face Tony.  Tony takes her champagne, polishes it off.
lands as hard as a punch to the gut. The thought of Steve injured in a violent fall is replaced with the equally unwelcome image of Steve and Tony together, bathed in soft light and warm, soapy water, Steve cradled in Tony’s arms as Tony runs his hands over Steve’s pale, bare skin.
.  No way these two things aren’t related.”  Bruce gets between Tony and the holographic map of Asia, reaching out a hand and angrily sweeping all of Tony’s work aside.  “Listen to me.  She’s not like me.  Or you.  She’s just a scientist.”
“Eh, I don’t think I’ve quite hit that mark yet. Give me a few years, though, I’ll see how crazy I can go.”
“He gets ahead of himself. Ahead of us, really.” Steve says, hearing the fondness creeping into his voice. He doesn’t actually like that Tony dropped Bucky this casual, less-than-informative letter, but he knows exactly why Tony did it. He knows Tony’s intentions were good, if his execution poor, because he knows Tony sometimes better than he knows himself.
“Today?”  Steve leans back against the counter, cupping his mug with two hands.  He looks down at it like the answer to Tony’s question is there, maybe rising in the steam or written in tealeaves.
dining nightly with Van Dyne or making off with Maximoff to get married in Mexico?” Sam grins. “Stark has gotta be paying Laufeyson a small fortune to drum up heat for this movie – you’d think you’re Clark Gable for how much ink you’re getting.”
He’d been quiet, strangely asking no questions about what he’d interrupted on the balcony before trundling off toward their bedroom, leaving his sketchbook and pencils behind.
“Oh please, Pepper, stop,” Tony cuts her off.  He hates it when she chooses her words carefully, tiptoeing around him.  It’s always how he knows something is really worrying her, because usually she and Rhodey are the only ones to call him on his crap and if she’s hedging...
Steve shrugs off her touch and folds his arms over his chest, pulling everything back into himself that he’s let spill loose.  He steels his gaze, swallows against the crack in his voice, and sets his jaw before speaking.
“I’m going to see Fury,” he announces, scooping up all his work from each screen and depositing it all into a file folder to take to the SHIELD helicarrier.  He runs a quick encryption on it and puts it on a portable drive.  He could certainly access it directly from SHIELD but he doesn’t want any avenues open to his network, doesn’t want any SHIELD agent poking their nose into his business.  He doesn’t doubt his paranoia is warranted.  Stupid assholes, letting Barnes come in like that, how could they not have
“Thanks for waiting up, Buck, but I…it’s been a long day and I’m really tired.  I think I’m going to go to bed.”
“Tone, deck suspenders,” Bucky, always attuned to the undercurrent of tension between himself and Tony, never misses a chance to push Tony’s buttons.  Looping his arm over Steve’s shoulders, he reaches across to Tony and snaps one of his navy and red striped suspenders sharply.  Steve can practically feel the pain of its thwap against his own skin.  He doubts Tony’s white button-down dress shirt helped cushion any of the sting.
Bucky angles Tony’s head back, tipping his chin upward, and captures his lips in a sloppy kiss. He fucks his tongue deep into Tony’s mouth, groaning out Tony’s name. It sends a flare of arousal anew through Tony’s veins, for the first time the want surging through him solely for Bucky.
Steve looks past Bucky for a moment, expecting to find a doctor in a white coat approaching.  Instead there’s Tony, frozen in the doorway with this strange, stricken expression on his face.  Almost like Tony’s disappointed to find him awake and talking.
“Never been more sure in my life.” Tony slides his hands around Steve’s waist and then down the back of his pants, fingers spreading wide across the tight swell of Steve’s utterly
Tony doesn’t pry further, and he doesn’t offer any empty assurances or advice. Anyone who’d been in it over there knows better than that.
But in all honesty, there was no way around it. Perhaps he hadn’t meant to say it just like that, but he was always going to talk to Steve about this thing with Bucky first, before he let Steve and Bucky sort it out between themselves. He wishes he were the bigger person who could simply send Steve in to talk to Bucky without getting a lay of the land, letting things shake out as they might, but even he's not that much of a self-sacrificing idiot.
“I’m inside you,” Bucky says, and for a second, he sounds sixteen again. He repeats it like he can’t quite believe this is actually happening. “Steve, I’m inside you.”
“This is indeed a delicacy,” Thor announces, obviously pleased as punch.  “We have no such dish in all of Asgard.  These Italians you speak of must be masters of the Midgardian culinary arts!”
Not that he wants that to happen.  It was just an observation.  And if he watches a single bead of water slide delicately from Steve’s sharp collarbone down the defined lines of his chest and stomach, it’s just because…
“And don’t sit on the comforter, those things are disease-ridden germ infestations.  They never wash them.”
Tony is overcome with indecision, his mind racing to play out possible outcomes. He should be decent and let Steve leave. They can’t be together and it’s cruel to drag this out any further and hurt Steve more while punishing himself.
“That really would’ve worked?”  Natasha quirks an eyebrow up at him, a hint of a smile playing at her full, red lips.  “I’ll remember that for next time.  Just.  Ask.”  Natasha rolls the notion over a few times on her tongue as if it’s a novel idea she’d never considered, and Steve realizes he’s being mocked.
“This is Madison Square Garden?  It’s…” Steve looks to the corner again, checking their location.  “But where is Penn Station?”
“It’s not really any of my business,” Steve mumbles, ducking his head and rubbing the back of his neck.
“Tony…” Steve breathes as Tony leans in and presses kisses to the insides of Steve’s thighs, feeling the muscles tremble underneath his lips.  He continues stroking and his mouth caresses everywhere else, following the lines of Steve’s abs and breathing in that heady scent of sex that he never would have believed could hang on Steve.
Taking the risk, Steve stretches his right arm across the couch cushion between them, leaving his palm face up.
“Fine....just...it's fine. You know, it's healthier you don't have secrets, right? You're gonna have enough to deal with coming from out there. You don't need my shit between you on top of it, in here.” He runs his hands through his hair and then rubs them over his face. This is exhausting, unexpectedly finding a high and then crashing back low all over again.
“Sorry I took so long to call you back, I just…” Bucky closes the door behind him, leaning against it. He digs a folded piece of notebook paper out of the breast pocket of his flannel shirt and holds it out to Steve. “Read this.”
up from a dead sleep at three in the morning, the welfare of others would be the furthest thing from his mind.
He eats, they drink.  Then he sits and they drink some more.  He tells them about the volunteer work he’s been doing, they offer him vague details of the latest missions SHIELD has handed down.  Every time he tries to make a departure, one of them finds a way to reel him back in.
What once was a memory slips easily into fantasy, safe yet sensual. There’s intense desire there, but it feels more like completion, something slotting into place that he’s always needed but never had, rather than something he merely
The wood ceiling feels about one hundred feet high and three sides of the room are built with floor to ceiling windows, asymmetrically and artistically separated into panes by smooth, golden warm planks of pine.  The large fireplace is already lit somehow, even though they only just walked in.
Tony mutters something under his breath and disappears into the bathroom.  He comes back a moment later, plastic glass clutched in one hand and a towel in the other.  He stops beside Bucky and drops the towel to the tile to sop up the mess.  He’s halfway toward bringing the glass to Steve’s lips before he aborts the movement and stutters back.
There’s such disdain for Tony in Bucky’s voice. Even after Tony’s treatment of him this morning, it pains Steve to hear it. He picks at the bedspread, not trusting himself to speak.
“Home sweet home, Cap.”  Clint announces as they step into a small foyer.  There’s a large oak door directly across from the bank of elevators; a much smaller, polished steel version of his red, white and blue shield is affixed about eye level.  There’s another keypad and print scanner on the wall to the right of the door.   Clint punches in a code and gestures for him to press his thumb to the small black screen.  “JARVIS can help you reset this to a personal pass code.  Until then, I promise not to break in and steal your shit.”
“I like Scott and all, but that’s your reputation, Rogers. Your reputation means our jobs, in the end.” Dugan’s got a point, but Steve would have thought after all this time, they’d have more trust in him than this. Scott Lang might be an ex-con, but he’s a good guy, and he’s not going to let Steve down.
“I really should have known you’d be into the obscure arty stuff, you damn hipster,” Tony smirks, and then takes a long drink.  They pause in the hallway before one of the huge windows.  Tony taps a finger arrhythmically against the brown glass of his beer bottle, slipping into silence as he stares out over the back patio.  The water of the pool shimmers from the underwater lights.  “We could see
“Oh, we should go.”  He starts to get up, clumsily knocking his knees against the tabletop, pulling the checked tablecloth askew and rattling their empty glasses.   Pepper reaches out a delicate hand to steady him and Steve very nearly chuckles to himself.  Her support would be useless against his weight, but the thought is kind.  He steps clear and starts pulling off his borrowed jacket.
Even so, he makes to pull back.  Steve whimpers at the loss and Tony sucks in a sharp breath, the sound of it making his own dick twitch.
“Except I’d like to. Seriously – slip a note under the trailer door when you decide what you’d like, I’ll stop on the way and pick up the ingredients. It’ll be nice. Just let me know the proper address and what time I should show up.”
He attempts to listen in on Rogers’ conversations, sifting for pertinent information, but he is distracted by the deep, warm tone of Rogers’ voice and the shape of his full, pink lips as they wrap around certain words.
When they pull away from one another, Tony pulls his vintage pocket watch from his front jeans pocket and glances at the time.
“No, I’m not.” Bucky tilts his head to look down at Tony. A small but honest smile curls at the edges of his full lips, barely visible in the darkness. “Not yet,” he continues, and it sounds like a promise.
Back then, when he had no personal knowledge of any member of the Stark family and being invited to their home would have been a ludicrous notion.
“I do. I love Tony too.” Steve nods. There’s no question of that; in this whole mess, he’s never once doubted that what he feels for Tony is real and lasting. It’s weird how assured he is, even as he grapples with the overwhelming resurfacing of his desire and love for Bucky.
Content warning: This chapter contains scene of attempted blackmail for sexual favors. In the end notes, I have provided a bare bones summary of the scene and information as to where to skip in the story if you'd rather avoid that content.
“She knows me too well.”  Tony murmurs, slapping a hand over Steve’s thigh good-naturedly.  Steve tries not to tense when Tony leaves it there a few moments too long.
He shoots down two combatants on Natasha’s tail – what else to call them, he doesn’t know, because he’s never seen creatures like this before, seems to be a running theme these days – and then takes out one that was this close to taking off Clint’s head with a swipe of its strange and huge ax-like weapon.
He shoves all of that aside, knowing that if Tony is blown away by a mere joke, discussing Bucky and his own murky sexuality is out of the question.  He focuses back on Tony, not about to let the man change the subject.
“Heard a rumor you’d rejoined the land of the living.”  Tony saunters to the foot of the hospital bed, his smile tight and forced.  The other man’s shirts are layered thick enough that Steve can’t see the light of the arc reactor at all; Steve really doesn’t like that.  “Good to see you, Cap.”
Sure enough, Bruce is back in human form and out like a light, sprawled on the deck in what’s left of his pants.
Steve slips further into the shadows, moving to peer down the driveway that cuts a sharp path down along the rocky cliff. “I was considering it.”
When he returns to New York three weeks later, Bucky Barnes is apparently better than ever.  And staying on Steve’s floor, because that’s the kind of bullshit Tony’s opened himself up to now.
“Tony…” Steve sighs, but Tony shakes his head. He slides one arm around Steve’s neck, and brings his other hand to Steve’s mouth. He presses three fingers softly over his lips, hushing him.
“Steve?”  Bucky leans forward, reaching out with his other hand to touch Steve’s face.  The move is aborted by the clang of the handcuffs that tether his wrist to the bed.  Steve narrows his eyes at the shiny metal, confused.  “He’s awake!  Steve, can you hear me?  Hey, he’s awake - get the doctor!”
Tony has had a few moments in his life already wherein he knew, immediately, that things from there on out would never be the same. The fight he had with his father over his decision to go to North Africa. Waking up injured and alone as a prisoner of war.
Bucky leans across Steve now and kisses Tony with surprising force, mouth demanding Tony’s submission to the act. Tony may or may not let out an undignified squeak at the unexpected move, but he quickly adjusts and pushes back, giving as good as he gets.  Steve grunts between them, the intensity of their kiss traveling its way down to the insistent push and drag of their fingers inside his body.
“Tony-“ Steve grabs him by the crook of the elbow, pulling him back.  He does it without thinking and he immediately knows it was the wrong call as he feels Tony tense up underneath his grasp.  For a man as tactile as Tony is, he doesn’t like to be touched, not without permission.   Steve lets go as quickly as he can and holds up his hands in a gesture of surrender.
“Tony…” Steve wraps his fingers around Tony’s wrist under the pretext of pulling his hand away but instead leaves them there.  He closes his eyes, not wanting to admit how nice it is to have someone touch him like this.  Like they care.
“Worship beauty?” Tony supplies, smirking.  “That’s a religion of its own, Cap, especially in this city.”
“Anything happens to Steve, I’m going to end you.” He means it.  More than he’s ever meant anything.
“What did he do?” Steve asks, more to himself than to Bucky, and quickly scans the short, to-the-point directive for Bucky to basically do with Steve as he pleases. He shakes his head, his laugh a mixture of bitter disbelief and reluctant amusement over Tony’s gall. “Christ almighty, Tony.”
Not thinking, Bucky starts running his hand soothingly through Steve’s sweat-damp hair, pushing the wet strands back from his glistening forehead. Steve’s closing his eyes, and Bucky can
“Yes.” Steve nods. “But there’s a big gap between saying something happened and saying what happened…
Because he doesn’t really know himself, not fully. How could he, when he has denied this part of himself for so long?
“No? You dropped me so fast that I nearly got whiplash and you couldn’t be plussed to tell me why. Did you meet someone else?”
“You’re such a joy when hungover, Tony, truly.” Pepper comments, and he can practically hear her rolling her eyes. “After pouring you home last night, I stayed over to make sure you didn’t die in a pool of your own vomit, and then kindly woke you up before you slept away one of the most important days of your career.” Pepper comes to stand near the end of the bed, crossing her arms over her chest. He looks at her, perfectly put together and pressed in a navy skirt and blazer, so bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, and he wants to kill her. “The words you’re looking for are ‘thank you.’ Or perhaps ‘I owe you a raise.’”
Maybe if he’d been honest with Pepper from the start about Steve Rogers being an emotional hand grenade, she would’ve been able to pull him clear of the blast zone.  But he’d given her half-truths, a partial rendering of an incomplete picture.  This isn’t the kind of thing that can be extrapolated correctly, much less from corrupted data.
“Don’t gimme that, I’m not the one who’s been wearing the same clothes for three days.  Unless you want to stand naked in the laundromat tomorrow while you wash your horribly filthy disgusting jeans and disgracefully unfashionable shirt, you better suck it up and deal.”
A series of images flash through Steve’s mind, mostly of Bucky and Tony in various highly sexual scenarios, and a few rather more innocent romantic ones. He blinks at Bucky, processing how he might feel about that. It doesn’t strike him as bad, exactly, and the thought of them doesn’t make him jealous, but it still feels slightly odd to consider.
“You know what you meant, Tony.”  Steve stubs out the cigarette on the railing and tosses the butt into the pot of dirt Bucky’s been using as an ashtray. “And I don’t appreciate you coming here when all I’m doing is giving you exactly what you wanted.”
“New security ID cards for the tower.  Come by, use the new gym, whatever.  It’s there.  We’re there.”
His attention is diverted from snarking back at Widow by the sound of Hulk’s roar, the not-so-jolly green giant crashing back into view and bringing half of the Macy’s storefront down with him.
“Mostly back to normal already.”  Steve slows his steps as he shows Tony his reddened palms, no longer raw and blistering as they were twelve hours ago.  Tony’s face twitches as he clicks his jaw.  He thumbs his nose and looks away as he starts walking again.
There’s a medieval suit of armor on display in the corridor, and Rogers pauses before it.  Tony ushers the rest ahead and then hangs back, watching as the other man reaches out and touches the arm, fingers gentle against the cool metal.
Deciding to act like he belongs there, Steve is about to take a seat and force himself to relax, perhaps read an abandoned newspaper, when Tony arrives. He’s like a rock in a small pond, rippling people into motion around him wherever he goes. The concierge who had studiously ignored Steve’s presence approaches Tony quickly, offering to call for a car.
Rows of fluorescent fixtures hang from the high ceiling, making the room bright but without enough intense, focused light for Bruce to direct to his work. To that end he has a few portable studio lamps and a number of magnifying glasses rigged up on arms, with clips. The back wall is covered in pegboard, various tools arranged neatly for easy access. The red light bulb above the door off to the left signals the dark room, and another, narrower table along that wall is littered with a few changing bags, cast aside spools of film and leader, dust blowers and orange sticks, a portable developing tank and any number of bottles of chemicals.
He stands there quietly until Steve finishes shaving, splashes water over his face.  Tony offers him a hand towel to pat dry.  When he’s done and casts the towel aside, he smiles at Tony and picks up the razor.
“You could fuck me again,” Steve offers instead, kneeling up and inching forward. His cock is already plumping between his thighs. Tony feels his skin warm, blood rushing and heartbeat picking up as he responds in kind.
His hold on the acetylene torch slips, leaving a wide swath of a scorch mark outside the knee joint of his new suit of armor.  As he switches the flame off he swears under his breath even though he knows that the already-planned fresh coat of paint will easily cover his mistake.
“Maybe I should take a shower first.” Steve suggests weakly as he takes the robe from Tony. He stands, bringing the sheet with him. Tony’s eyes track down his body for a moment and then back up to his face. A telltale flush spreads across Tony’s cheeks, revealing his thoughts to be less than innocent. Tony doesn’t say anything though, evidently aware that now is not the right time.
But right now, Steve is across from him at a table in this diner and they’re going to eat breakfast at four o’clock in the afternoon.
“Rise and shine, Tony!” Pepper’s cheerful voice hits him a moment before he feels the slap of the morning newspaper against his chest. He hears the slide of porcelain on wood as she sets a cup of coffee on his nightstand. The rich smell of coffee floods his nose and sends him stomach churning. Tony groans, pulling a pillow over his head and closing his eyes tighter as she unceremoniously throws open his curtains, flooding the bedroom with late morning light.
80s movies, in particular, seem to be a favorite.  The fact that Steve knows what 80s movies are now -
“Besides, I’m not particularly hungry.” Tony’s pouty lips twitch into a small, teasing smile. “For anything we ordered, anyway.”
“I can find my way out, Miss Potts, no need to go to such trouble,” Steve says so very courteously and Pepper reaches over, puts a comforting hand on his forearm.
Steve’s own belt is still undone, the button of his pants unclasped. All that’s left is for Tony to tug down the zipper.
“You remember that I have to fly to London tomorrow morning? I’ll be gone for a couple of days. I want you to spend that time with Bucky.”
“Guy’s gotta do what a guy’s gotta do,” Tony retorts, angling his head back over his shoulder to kiss Steve again.   He quickly turns it hard and dirty, fucking his tongue in and out of Steve’s mouth and not so subtly pressing his ass back against Steve’s groin, only the thin cotton of his own underwear and the terrycloth of Steve’s towel separating him from what he wants.
“The last one didn’t feel all that useful,” he comments, but Steve shrugs and pockets it anyway.  Tony sighs.  “I guess I’ll go if you want to.  Maybe in ten years when we go shopping, we won’t have to keep checking all your favorite soy products to see if they’re still non-GMO.”
She’s battered to hell now, the paint job chipped and fading. “Maintenance is your responsibility. When’s the last time you brought this old gal around?”
He presses a kiss to Steve’s shoulder and then rubs his thumb over the spot gently in a small circle.  He wishes he could get his name tattooed into Steve’s skin.
But he’s a little bit drunk, and the thought would have never crossed his mind if Tony had followed through on their dinner plans. He wants this thing with Tony, even if it’s not easy. Even if Tony apparently doesn’t care quite as much.
Not saying anything, Tony quickly crosses toward him and wraps his arms around Steve’s shoulders from behind. Steve tenses for one painful moment, like he’s startled by the move, but then slumps a little, sinking back into Tony’s embrace. Tony buries his nose in Steve’s soft hair, breathing him in. He’s warm and smells of coffee.
“I could still drive us out to my place.” It’s late, and it’d be a long ride, but it’s safer than here, with neighbors around and Bucky, oh god,
“We believe he refused to see Captain Rogers because he was afraid of what he might do if he did.  James Buchanan Barnes is at war with the Winter Soldier, Stark.  And we’ve been trying to get what we can from him, but let’s just say that…he’s having a hard time getting himself to cooperate.”  Fury cocks an eyebrow at him, like he’s daring Tony to find a way around
, that’s helpful.” Tony snaps, but Rhodey laughs. He takes a seat next to Tony on the wooden crate, slapping a hand over his knee.
“I don’t know. Let me down easy?” Bucky replies, though it’s obvious he doesn’t fully believe that. “You love Tony.”
“We showed.  The last message I got from Hill, she was in Fury’s communications room.”  Tony points down the hall and Clint and Natasha file behind him.  If there are any enemy fighters left, he’s better equipped to take the hit.
He cries for everything he’s refused to cry for.  Everything he denied and repressed because he had needed to be strong and he hadn’t a choice.  He can stop pretending now, at least for this moment.
“Scientifically speaking?” Clint snorts.  Tony stops hovering in the air around them and comes to a gentle landing beside Steve.  Steve steps away under the pretense of avoiding the repulsors, but as soon as he’s on solid ground Tony flips the faceplate and shoots Steve a look that says he knows otherwise.
He’d been honorably discharged, done with the war by 1943, just as Captain America went off to Europe to become a real hero. He’d received a chest marred with battle scars and permanent heart trouble for his efforts; Tony doesn’t know how or where Steve Rogers wound up, and he doesn’t much care.
“Okay…” Steve nods. His heart stutters a little, the relaxation of a well-earned sleep ebbing away completely as the tide of anxiety sweeps in. He’d taken Tony at his word that he should explore his feelings for Bucky, but now is when he finds out how much Tony really meant it. If Tony can really handle it.
Bucky is sweating profusely – though it’s more like glistening, that lucky fuck – and his long brown hair hangs in his face as he looks down at Steve, blocking his expression from Tony’s view. Steve looks back at Bucky with something nearing reverence, and Tony can only imagine an equal amount of desire and love on Bucky’s face.  But Steve’s a pleasure to look at for now, no imagination necessary. Steve’s mouth is bitten and kiss-swollen, his pink lips slightly parted as he gasps out labored breaths that are probably shaky from excitement and not exertion.  His usually pale cheeks are rosy, his blue eyes blown dark with arousal beneath his lush, long eyelashes.
“C’mon, Pete, it’s okay.” Tony puts a hand on his shoulder. “Look at me, it’s fine.” Peter lifts his head a little, unsure. “Come on now, up, face forward, there we go. You're a young guy, y'know, these things happen.”
He starts to roll over to face Tony, to make things easier, but is stopped by Tony snuggling into the bed behind him, sliding one arm underneath him and the other over his waist to wrap firmly around Steve’s middle. He pulls Steve back toward him. He likes doing that now that Steve is small, now the he can move him easily. Steve submits, sinking into Tony’s embrace with a contented sigh.
Tony and Steve look back to each other at the same time and Steve can’t help but join him when Tony bursts out laughing again.
His military dress uniform should have been enough, he’d thought, but Pepper had said that wouldn’t fly with these kinds of people.  Apparently the only thing high fashion wants from the military is the occasional borrowing of thematic khaki or camouflage.
“No.”  It’d be easy to think otherwise and he understands why his mother might’ve done so.   But it really had nothing to do with how beautiful Steve was, or how wonderful a person.  He doubts now that Steve and his father were even that great of friends.  It wasn’t adoration that drove Howard in his search; it was self-preservation.  Captain America was the last weapon Howard Stark ever created that was more than chaos and destruction, an agent of good and not solely an agent of death.  His father had merely been clinging to the source of his own redemption, maybe even the chance to replicate the serum and do it all again.  Finding Steve, dead or alive, knowing what happened to him…
Pepper’s knowing smile leaves him ruffled. There are three people who are permanently in his life who know that while he’s enjoyed the attentions of many women in the past, he frequently prefers the company of men. His chauffeur, Happy, knows by necessity. His best friend, James Rhodes, knows because once in an ill-advised drunken moment, Tony had laid one on him. Pepper knows because she understands him. He couldn’t love her the way she’d wanted, and she’d guessed why; he hadn’t even had to tell her.
If only he’d known then that Bucky had wanted him too. That if he’d only had the nerve to make a move, Bucky maybe would have pinned him to the couch and fucked him senseless before even thinking about rinsing the long day off of his skin.
“Won’t say a word.” Steve promises.  Natasha draws back, her fingers tracing the length of a bruise on his cheek.  She presses just hard enough for him to feel it.
“Far be it from me to help,” Bucky retorts, dropping the spoon back into the container. He hands it over to Steve. “You hold it then, and don’t ask me to clean up when you have a fit and spill it all over yourself.”
“Totally fine,” Steve replies.  He reaches down and takes Tony’s hand, not wanting his personal angst to ruin the evening.  “Let’s go, don’t want to miss the magic, right?”
“Three months ago your house exploded, you were presumed dead.  Then you saved nearly everyone on Air Force One, before saving the President himself from being killed on live television by the Mandarin.”
Oh dear. I’ve gone and done it now. You know, Pepper, smiling is the Hollywood way. There are many lovely young ladies who would
– this folder, this target, this mission.  Just a blank space where even he innately knows memories are supposed to be.
“Ok, Happy.”  Tony says quietly, tapping the headrest of the seat in front of him gently.  The driver nods, his reply a gentle ease on the gas.  Apparently he must be looped in on the direness of whatever is occurring, because he remains quiet and slowly heads for the western edge of the park, then turns southward without instruction.
,” Tony spits, shoving Fury hard one last time and then letting go.  He paces to the other end of the room.  Fury straightens his clothes and looks at Bruce as if he expects Bruce to be more receptive of whatever spiel he’s about to spin off.
“Tony said that you love me.” Steve blurts out, and that stops Bucky in his tracks. His cheeks heat, his skin goes clammy. He hasn’t been this apprehensive around Bucky since…well, ever, really? Maybe ever since the day they first met when Steve hadn’t yet figured out why such a charming, strong, and popular kid wanted to be friends with a stubborn pissant like him. He still hasn’t figured that out, but he did quickly stop questioning his good luck and decide to just be grateful for Bucky’s odd choices. “Or he said that you’re
“We’ll see.” She eyes her sometimes-boyfriend askance, and then looks down at the list of tracks on the mix critically.  Steve had offered a few suggestions, Lord Huron, Joywave, and A Silent Film among them, but he doesn’t know what Bucky eventually went with.  When Natasha doesn’t offer much of a reaction, Bucky steps back, decides to go stand by Steve.
She nods politely in thanks, not really looking at him, and her companion doesn’t give him so much as a glance.
“No.” Steve reminds himself aloud, shaking his head sharply to derail that train of thought. These morning jaunts are supposed to give him the time to get it together every morning, to get his mind clear and focused – not lost in the muck of the past. He turns and directs himself toward home, purposefully choosing not to give in to the cowardly voice inside that tells him to hide.
Steve looks away, pained gaze catching on the kitchen countertop where Tony had only moments before taken him to pieces.
“Maybe you and I should just run off together, Stevie, put a stop to these blind dates once and for all.” She pulls a cigarette from a slim silver case and holds it out to him between two fingers.
“Steven, does it strike you as odd that we’ve been neighbors for months and yet I’ve only seen you on this set? Why, the only times we’ve spoken have been during your costume fittings.
But Tony’s got this. Bucky knows Tony will hurry Steve back inside in a moment and cuddle him up on the couch. Tony will explain that whatever occurred between him and Bucky just now was nothing for Steve to worry about.
“I’m not saying that anything needs to happen with Bucky. I’m just saying…if it does, I think you should go with it. I think it’s a question you need answered.”
But even if he and Steve are loud enough to shake the walls, no one will dare speak a word of it. This is where the rich and famous go when they need their secrets kept.
He’s been told “real” New Yorkers now avoid Times Square like the plague, so he supposes he might still fit in here after all.
“Oh, and what. Is. That. I didn’t know you were interested in sound equipment as well, Banner. Moving away from mono, I like it. So the speakers would be here and here?” He points to the different places Bruce has marked on the theater layout, but Bruce only grabs the drawing from him and puts it aside.
Tony seems to sense this, like a shark scenting blood in the water. He smiles, all teeth, his next words coming out overdramatically polite and just a touch too loud.
“It’s raining,” Steve states, and Tony doesn’t know why. It sounds like the words actually mean something else.
“I feel like we need to come up with a better contingency plan for this, guys,” Natasha states the obvious.  “Standing here watching him trash the place isn’t accomplishing anything.  It’s not as if he’s going to wear himself out, he can do this for days.”
“Good to see you back, Tony.”  Steve says, his face lit up and his smile soft and easy.  He looks at Tony like he really is glad to see him, and Tony goes back to drinking his coffee, swallowing down his urge toward violence with it.
They press pause on their conversation as the hors d’oeuvres arrive – shrimp cocktails, rolled toast with mushrooms, and stuffed olives with bacon. Steve’s glass of wine is refilled before it can go empty.
“You knew, didn’t you.  What turning yourself in but refusing to see Steve would do.  You knew him better than anyone.  Knew how he would react.  You wanted him as far away from this city as possible.”
“Yeah.  To think the doc once told you smoking would help your asthma.”  Bucky grins, shaking his head at the memory.  Steve can imagine what he’s thinking of – measly little Steve Rogers, weak and barely able to breathe, coughing his way through his first cigarette.  He can remember the feel of Bucky’s hands firm but careful on his shoulders, holding him as he heaved.  “Just goes to show you, what the hell does anyone really know.”
Steve bites back his questions and concerns because he knows his words won’t register.  Bucky would have no answers even if they did.  He has to settle for being close enough to touch, reassured by the steady rhythm of his best friend’s breathing.
Then Tony’s hand is on his face, gently stilling his pained laughter.  Steve steps back, frightened by the look on Tony’s face, even more frightened by how it makes him feel.
They look at each other, both seeming like they’re going to speak, but then look away. Bucky chuckles, then sighs.
"Maybe we should call the whole thing off?" Steve kids and Tony groans.  "You very rarely quote anything from before the 60s, let alone the 40s, Stark, let me enjoy the moment."
“Works now.”  How that happened is a mystery to neither of them.  Natasha sits down on the couch and gestures to the cushion beside her, pulling a dark blue throw pillow out of the way.
Tony Stark is rude, unpredictable, entitled, and comes with entirely too much baggage. Steve’s tangled up with Tony’s family’s past in ways that he doesn’t think he fully understands and probably never will.
.”  Steve whips toward her, hackles up.  The accusation is unfair, especially since Tony’s the only one who did any actual running.  “I left because I thought he wanted me to.”
“That makes you filthy,” Tony retorts teasingly, but his next words are more serious. “That makes you mine.” He takes Steve’s cock back in his mouth and swallows him down, throat tight around him. Steve loses all touch with reality as Tony works him, using little of his usual finesse to draw it all out. Instead he’s insistent, demanding, pulling an orgasm out of Steve’s tired body with nearly violent exigency.
They are near enough to one another that Tony can feel Steve’s body warm behind his, hear his quiet breathing as they move silently down the long hall. It’s not enough. He wants to look back over his shoulder and make sure of the other man’s presence, to gaze directly into those captivating blue eyes, but he’s afraid that Steve will disappear like Eurydice in the Underworld.
“Can’t get drunk; there is a difference,” Steve corrects, a slight smile breaking his stoic expression.  For a moment Tony thinks he might be pleased with this turn of events, but Steve backs away from the edge of comfortable familiarity as quickly as he approached it.  “This isn’t for me though.  My mother always said to be prepared to entertain guests.”
They wind up close enough to one another that he can hear the man’s stunned gasp and heavy breathing when he stops the thrown shield cold, catching it solidly in one hand.  He stares, getting a long good look at the other man, and it’s suddenly hard for him to breathe as well.
“She won’t,” Tony tosses off.  “Wake up, or worry.  She sleeps like the dead and she knows I don’t.”
“Where’s your lady love?” Sam asks, and before Steve can ask him what he means, he puts a folded copy of
“You have anything?” Tony murmurs against Steve’s skin when he slides a finger in alongside his tongue, and Steve nods. Steve’s still so hot and tight. Steve manages to grab a container of petroleum jelly from the bedside table drawer and Tony opens it eagerly, hands fumbling at the task.
“No, no messages. But you could check with Gert – I mean, Gertrude, the intern up at the production office? She’d handling calls today.”
There’s no place to sit and they’re forced to stand close to one another, Tony’s smaller body seeming to fold into his own.  Steve looks down at their entwined fingers and slowly disentangles, reaching to grab the handrail instead as the train lurches into movement.  His palm is sweaty now, and he’s feeling sheepish about the whole thing.  He expects Tony to be irked; instead he seems incredibly amused.
- but it doesn’t happen.  He stays silent and the door closes behind Clint.  It locks automatically.
Tony vaguely hears someone speaking above his head, but he’s too concentrated on the exquisiteness of Steve’s stubbled jaw line for it to really register.
It’s his first real smile in weeks, his last one given freely as he looked down on Steve in bed, stunningly gorgeous as he fell into a peaceful slumber.
Steve and Bucky are sitting side by side on the edge of Bucky’s bed.  Bucky is holding Steve’s hand in his lap, and oddly seems to be tracing some kind of idle pattern onto Steve’s palm as they talk.
“Sure, she only steals his cash, betrays his trust, and crushes his heart—a gut full of lead would really have been overkill.” Steve shakes his head.
“Speaking of getting your own, Pepper, I invited an old friend of yours to stop on by tonight, it looks like he just arrived.”
It’s fleeting, the action covered from public view by Tony reaching with his other hand to give Steve one of the bright yellow oversized menus, but it feels like the most important thing he’s done in a very long time.
ago,” Jan remarks, turning back to Steve with an arched eyebrow at the ready, as if to sarcastically say,
Tony hadn't, in fact, seen it, as he's been studiously avoiding thinking about Steve whenever possible. He can't help the jump of panic in his stomach at the mention of him, and he hopes he manages to school his face into disinterest.
“Who is this, playing now?” Clint is asking.  Everyone is quiet for a moment as they listen to what’s playing over the speakers.
Feeling daring, Steve leans forward in his own chair, gesturing for Tony to lean in. The other man complies. He wets his lips, watching Tony’s gaze catch on his mouth, and lowers his voice to a deep whisper.
“Don’t appreciate your silence here, Tony.”  Steve presses, and a brief smirk breaks Tony’s stoic mask.
Except Tony does care, and as loathe as Bucky is to admit it, Tony wouldn’t merely stand back and let Bucky do this, whether Steve was upset or not.
Tony manages to push himself upright. He tosses the newspaper aside without looking at it and clumsily reaches for the coffee. It tastes like something died in his mouth.
“I thought duty meant he’d be riding a desk!”  Tony shouts and beside him, Pepper winces.  “Writing briefs about what he remembers so other far more dependable and less
“Some kind of robot attack on Battery Park.  Some bozo named Dr. Doom is claiming responsibility and threatening to unleash the rest of his forces on the city.”
“Where the hell are you?” Bucky demands immediately. His voice is rough and agitated, his words coming out in a near growl. “What were you thinking with this?”
He holds Tony’s hand tighter. He’ll be embarrassed about it later, he knows, but he needs it right now.
“A lot of people don’t want Stark in town, you know, and there are even more who want the Stark name back in weapons production where it belongs.” A lock of his black hair falls down across Loki’s forehead as he tilts his head, and he off-handedly pushes it back. “They would all pay a pretty penny to drive him back to his war toys.”
“Don’t worry, I can cover the damages. Well worth every penny,” Tony grins. He grabs one of the towels that’s barely clinging to the broken rack and turns on the faucet. The pipes let out a distressed croak, but enough water comes out to moisten the fabric.
“It’s okay…” Bucky says comfortingly. He regrets it when he hears Steve suck in a sharp inhale. It’s a different sound than before. Steve bites his lip and keeps his eyes shut as tightly as he can, clearly fighting back tears of frustration and pain.
Bucky grabs the container back and sets it on the coffee table, ignoring the spill. Steve is too wracked to protest. By force of habit, Bucky quickly hands Steve a tissue and then moves half behind him; he leans Steve forward, rubbing his back as he weakly tries to retch phlegm from his chest and throat.
“And the only way I could fix it would be if you let me provide entirely for you so you wouldn’t have to worry about work –” Tony holds up a finger to cut off Steve’s predictable protest. “And I
Though if they’d done this when he was sixteen or seventeen, Steve knows he never would’ve lasted longer than a few minutes. He’d either have come too fast in an embarrassing rush, or halted the whole thing with a coughing fit or asthma attack.
Pulling his handkerchief from his breast pocket, Tony unfastens his trousers and pulls his hard length out with a sigh of relief. He doesn’t bother to get up and lock the door. It only takes a couple of rough pulls and the thought of Steve’s lips sucking at his tip, blond head bobbing between his thighs; Tony comes quickly and quietly, one surprised gasp pushing past his lips, and the heavy load caught carefully in the red square of silk covering his other hand.
She glances at him and Steve tries to school his face into the blankest expression he can muster.  It’s not easy to do.  He can’t lie – as a result of their joint search for Bucky, he had been growing closer to her than anyone in this new world of his.  While it was just a part of their cover, they had even kissed, and it had created a strange kind of intimacy between them.  Like him being able to play the game and keep up with her on the job made her comfortable letting him in.
“I’ve been busy.  It’s hard to have fun when you have exploding arrows to design.  Well, okay, the exploding arrows were fun, but you know what I mean.”
, if he could have believed Tony to be so fickle. He would have gone after Steve in a heartbeat if that were the case. If Tony weren’t good enough.
…” Steve’s fingers tighten in his hair as he thrusts into Tony’s warm mouth. Tony keeps his jaw loose and his throat open, but Steve doesn’t lose control. He goes fast and hard enough to make tears prick at the edges of Tony’s eyes, for him to breathe in sharply through his nose when he can’t quite get enough air, but Steve always backs off before it’s too much. Tony eventually manages to take him in deep, to bury his nose in the thatch of hair between Steve’s legs, the head of Steve’s cock nudging down the back of his throat.
“It’s a minor continuity issue. Both the suits read almost the same in black and white anyway, and maybe you brushed your hair when you went off screen? Who knows? Let those imaginations fill in the blanks. Honestly, I think it’ll escape most folks’ notice.”
It’s uncomfortable but it’s the only option. The mattress springs will squeak; the headboard will rock; the bed frame will creak. Steve can’t even take him up against the wall because the drywall in this place is paper-thin and the sound will travel. The blinds aren’t down and the drapes aren’t closed but Tony thinks, idly, that that can wait until after. It’s late now and dark, the moonlight nearly blocked by the jacaranda tree outside the window, and they’re on the floor already.
“Only every day since he got switched back.” He says flatly.  “It’s not like you’ve been subtle. Something’s clearly bothering you, so he’s upset, and frankly, I’m confused. Because Steve and I have been together for over a year now, and I thought that we were cool. I thought maybe that we might even be considered…friendly, let’s say, if not friends. But suddenly you hate me, and I suspect it’s for the same reason I used to hate you.”
“What was that?” Steve asks, and rightly so. Tony certainly hadn’t come to bed with the intent of getting off on Steve talking about Bucky, yet that was somehow exactly what happened.
“I’ve told him time and time again that he’s gotta let the Other Guy out to play once in a while.  Keeping him cooped up like this is a recipe for disaster,” Tony comments, snapping his face plate down as he watches the Hulk thrash toward the windows.  Steve rolls his eyes, because leave it to Tony to contribute nothing but snark.
Clint finds Fury pinned underneath a comm unit and Natasha hurriedly helps him lift it.  He’s barely conscious and his leg is clearly broken.  His eye patch has been ripped off, revealing his scarred eye socket.  Barnes lays a few feet away, unmoving.  Clint slaps Fury’s cheeks, trying to get him to stir.
“Alas, my attempt to replicate my Lady Jane’s likeness has not met with great success.” Thor turns around his jack o’ lantern to reveal three jagged holes that Steve divines were supposed to be Jane’s eyes and her mouth.  “Loki always displayed greater artistic gifts than I.  My talents sadly do not extend thusly.”
“A slight situation?” Pepper repeats, eyebrows lifting.  She stands up, coming to Tony’s side.  She understands the gravity of the words just as well as he does.
Steve doesn’t fully wake, slipping back asleep with a deep exhale, so Tony takes a seat at the far end of the couch, lifting up Steve’s feet and placing them in his lap. Fiorello lets out a disgruntled yowl and scampers away in displeasure.  Tony curves a hand gently around Steve’s ankle, thumb rubbing small circles against his skin.
His fingers toy with the two photographs, attached by a weak paper clip to the information sheet in front of him.  The first is a military ID photo taken in black and white, Rogers in his dress uniform staring sternly out from the frame.  The focus is soft, the corners are curling, the whites of the paper yellowed and the darks going no deeper than brownish-gray.
“Six o’clock is taking it easy?”  Tony glances at his watch.  It’s near midnight now, and even if he tries to go to sleep it’ll probably take a good two hours to settle and that’s only because he’s already pretty tired.  “Ugh.”
Bucky just shrugs, mustering up only a weak guilty look that fades quickly.  He kicks his heels up on the armrest and Steve scowls at the dust shaking off his shoes and onto the faded but clean fabric.  But he knows better than to think Bucky will apologize for anything – ruined drawing, ruined couch, or otherwise - so Steve sighs and reluctantly unfolds the newspaper, scanning the headlines for the story that Bucky apparently couldn’t wait to share.
“Maybe we should hit you in the head really hard.  Worked on Barton during his mind robbery and I have to say, it’d feel pretty good to boot.” Tony’s impatience is ratcheting up again, making his skin itch and his heart race like so much yellow wallpaper.
“He’s a little drunk.” Steve excuses. Across the street, Jan’s door also bounces closed as Nat finally gets her inside. Only the two of them out here now, alone with the cicadas and crickets.
“Steven Rogers.” His name slinks of Loki Laufeyson’s tongue like liquid silver, just dripping with smug superiority. “Fancy meeting you here. I heard you had a picture going on, was I wrong?” He smiles slowly as he takes one step closer behind him.
Tony pauses, imagining this in his head and trying to decide if the prospect of it angers or excites him.
“Tony.  Can you…” Steve stares at him, holding up both his hands like he wants to grab hold of something but isn’t sure what.  “Can you just stay still for a second?”
Steve moves his mouth but no sound comes out.  The rosy flush of desire high on his cheeks fades, surprise draining the color from his face.
to, but he’s learned over the years not to – so he opts to slide his palm down over Steve’s thigh instead.
“Oh it’s okay,” Jane assures him, bright and cheerful.  Her cheeks are rosy and her smile is sweet.  If Tony didn’t know she was fucking brilliant, he might be tempted to write her off as a chirpy dimwit.  “Only Thor and Steve do it anyway.”
!”   He groans again as he enthusiastically shoves another piece into his still full mouth, earning him a few looks from people sitting around them.
“Yeah.  I guess we don’t.”  Tony mumbles, closing his eyes.  He tries to calm himself, running through what he remembers of the file he received on Bruce before this whole Avengers mess began.  “Betty…she was in your file.  College girlfriend or something like that.”
They lean in toward each other, but before their lips meet, Natasha punches the button to close the window.
“You’re not late at all, Tony. Our meeting is at noon.” Pepper smiles, looking slightly pleased with herself. Tony looks at his watch, seeing that he has a full hour before he’s expected at Paramount.
“I hardly expected this from you, Cap.”  She speaks with a studied nonchalance, and without looking Steve knows she has her eyebrow arched in a calculated display of amused contempt.  He doesn’t have to ask her what she means.
They’d taken a car service out to Queens, but when Steve suggests that they head back into Manhattan, Tony shocks him by countering that they ride the 7 back instead.  While he’d thought that the subway might make Tony uncomfortable, he figures Tony knows his own limits better than he does so he tells Tony to lead the way.
The sets are shoddy, the acting atrocious, and half the footage is marred by a hair in the gate, the ragged black line twitching at the top edge of the frame.
“That light…” Steve whispers to himself, realizing now that it only could have been one thing: the flash bulb of Loki’s camera. “How did you even…?” Steve turns back to Loki, shocked. For someone to get onto Tony’s property, to climb up to the house…
Steve chuckles a little at that, which makes Tony feel victorious even as he’s sure he should be giving up this whole conversation and walking away.
“Howard Stark provided funding and stage weapons, he wasn’t exactly in the film business.” Steve rubs his palm over his heated face as he turns away from his friend and back to the drawing board. “Once the war ended, I don’t think Howard had anything more to do with movies.”
To his surprise, Tony and he take off without a word to anyone else, ducking out of the mansion through the back entrance and hailing a cab before Steve has time to second guess his decision.  The texts from Natasha and Sam begin when they’re only a few blocks away, and cease shortly thereafter, meaning either Nat tracked him down or Tony had somehow sent word of their plans.  Steve doesn’t ask; he just enjoys the silence.
“Fast?” Tony supplies quickly, perhaps betraying his own apprehension.   He’d honestly been expecting Steve to put on the brakes long before this, so he steels himself to stop, drawing on his shallow well of self-control.
you…” Tony replies, pushing apart his thighs, fingertips brushing over that sensitive skin. “But there’s other things we can do in the meantime.”
Heaving a heavy sigh, Steve pushes himself back to his feet and slips on his suit coat. With one last long look down the hall, he lets himself out.
Steve nods, glancing down at his feet.  Tony lifts the hand that was on his shoulder and puts a finger underneath Steve’s chin, tilting his head back up.
“Damned if I know,” she replies as she lights a cigarette and tosses her gold-plated lighter onto her makeup table. She inhales and then slowly angles a cloud of smoke toward Tony's face. “You were saying, about the film? Is it rotten or no?”
“We all have something at stake here,” Bruce says quietly, the warning implicit.  Tony knows it’s unfair but he can’t believe Bruce is putting some woman none of the other Avengers even know ahead of
“My sketchbook?”  Tony repeats, leaning forward and resting his elbows on his knees.  “You mean how do I deal with it?”  He moves his head from side to side, looking up at the swiftly moving clouds as he considers the question.  “Uh, copious amounts of work and booze, in equal measure.”  He claps a hand to Steve’s knee and uses Steve’s body as leverage to push himself up to stand.
“I’m sorry, I think that’s my fault,” Steve apologizes even though he knows it would irk Natasha to no end to hear him do it.  “I know the two of you were friends at one point, but she’s not so happy with Tony right now, and I-“
Perplexingly, Nigel pauses along the back wall. Steve glances at Tony as they stop beside one another; it may just be the low light of the cellar, but Tony’s eyes are wide and dark. He’s already breathing slightly fast, however, and Steve doesn’t think he can attribute that to the location.
“Drunk enough to say that I want to kiss you right now, but not drunk enough to do it.” Steve replies quietly, leaning in for a moment and then drifting back. Tony is helpless to follow him, closing the space between them.
“Tony.” Steve sighs deeply, then reaches out and grabs his fidgeting hands. He pulls Tony close, twining their hands together over his chest. He doesn’t know what to say to make Tony change, knows that even if he said the most brilliant, perfect thing in the world, that change couldn’t possibly happen right now, so he settles for pressing a gentle kiss to Tony’s lips. He pulls back before Tony can push it anywhere less innocent.
It makes him feel a little odd, like maybe he should have been more grateful for Tony’s attentions now that he suspects he’s been singled out.  The leather bound set of first edition Walt Whitman poetry, the boxes of used jazz records, the set of oil paints…he’d tried to refuse the gifts at first but Tony had assured him that he liked doing it and he’d stop being amused and get offended if Steve kept trying to give everything back.
The moonlight is bright enough to highlight the tops of the pine trees, to break the mountains from the sky along the horizon.  He can see the stars and he wants to go outside and look up, name all the ones he knows.  At the orphanage, sometimes he and Bucky would sneak out onto the roof and Buck would ask him to point out the constellations.
“I am of course happy to oblige. I think you’ll find our wine collection most impressive. We will need to go down to the lowest level, so if you’ll forgive the short walk?”
He’s fine with having an aesthetic appreciation for anyone beautiful, but thinking about Steve within a sensual, physical framework sets off warning signals in every quadrant of his brain.  He’s reckless and all, but letting sexual attraction pile on the already towering heap of conflicting emotions he has for this guy would be beyond willfully dumb.  He can’t afford to think that way.
Steve stirs to the sound of hushed voices just outside his doorway. He lifts his head from his pillow, blinking enough sleep from his eyes to notice that the door he’d firmly closed before falling into bed is now ajar. He glances at the clock on his nightstand, and realizes he's been asleep for going on three hours.
He even selfishly wishes Bucky would remember the war itself, fighting side by side as equals, partners.  The times that Steve finally saved Bucky’s life, returning half a lifetime’s worth of favors.
“Yes, you donkey,” She smiles up at him forgivingly, reaching up and tapping him on the nose with one finger. “I remember what my first one was like. I ran to the ladies to throw up.”
“I’ll go.”  Steve volunteers tersely before Natasha can continue, keeping his gaze locked on Fury’s stern face.  “Agent Romanoff can stay.”
“Oh fuck, Tony,” Steve gasps as he wraps his own hand around his length and jerks himself to completion. The mess on his chest is spectacular and Tony rubs his hands through it as he loses his rhythm, stuttering inside Steve’s body and then pumping in hard like he needs to get further in than he’s physically capable of going. His whole body pulses with his orgasm as he fills Steve with his come.
“Let’s go for a drive.” Tony pulls a set of keys from his pocket, pressing them to Steve’s palm. “You decide where.”
me, if nothing else. But he’d never do anything when he was awake. Always froze up and bolted out of bed soon as his eyes opened, and neither of us ever said a word about it. I don’t even know if he knew
Tony sits up straight, tipping his glass toward Rhodey in accusation. Booze slops to the Oriental rug.
“What?” Steve asks quietly, waiting.  He brings a hand up and places it over Tony’s forearm.  Tony lets out a long, deep breath and closes his eyes.
“I fucking hate not knowing what to say to you,” he admits, and Steve smiles, feeling some of the tension in his chest ease.
Tony slides his hand up to meet his mouth, stroking up as he slips down. Steve’s cock twitches against Tony’s tongue, and Tony pulls off to catch a small pulse of liquid that spills from Steve’s tip. Tony has his free hand on Steve’s chest, stuffed up underneath his still-buttoned shirt and tight undershirt, and he feels all the muscles tense up under his palm.
Natasha tilts her head toward Steve and raises one eyebrow, arching perfectly over the rim of her oversize 80s-style pearlescent-rimmed glasses.  The thick lenses are actually clear plastic; she wears them because she thinks they encourage people to underestimate her strength and beauty and overestimate her intelligence.   She insists it’s not a quirk but a careful calculation.
“Come for me, baby,” Tony pleads, endearments always seeming to do the trick when it comes to pushing Steve over. He grabs Steve’s hips, urging him harder against him as he thrusts more shallowly, more of a sensuous roll than a harsh thrust. “I love feeling you come all around me.”
Manhattan takes his breath away as Steve weaves in and out of traffic, hugging the lower curve of the island.  He almost asks Steve to edge west off the parkway so they can take a long, twisting drive north up the length of the island, through the crazy mess of streets below Houston – the graffiti-covered stalls all closed up for the night on Canal, the cozy restaurants open late in Little Italy, the last few dive bars left in the Bowery, all the tiny community gardens and twenty-four hour bodegas in Alphabet City…he suddenly wants to see this city, like he needs to know it’s all still there.
Tony approaches him slowly, pausing to circle down the volume as he passes the speaker.  The change in the music must alert Steve to his presence, though he doesn’t stop what he’s doing and he doesn’t say anything.
“Just one question. Blame a curious mind. Was it me, or Steve, that got you all…hot and bothered over here? Or is that about someone else entirely.” He points downward and Peter blushes all over again. It’s not that Tony isn’t attractive, but he is older. Peter’s never had occasion to think of him like
He’s working on Steve’s belt, and Steve should be stopping him, but he’s not.  And the fact that he’s not makes Tony’s head swim.  He whispers something vulgar, maybe an entirely unedited stream of thought about Steve’s body and what he wants to do to it, and Steve
“Much,” Tony replies, already looking forward to spending tomorrow night in his California King size bed with nice, clean, 1500 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets, with a stunning view of the majestic Rockies instead of a dirty parking lot.   He goes all the way back into the bathroom, and as he shuts the door behind him, he catches a glimpse of Steve’s hands going to his waist, loosening his towel.
“Too late, I’m coming in,” Tony declares, throwing himself in between them and wrapping them in an exuberant hug. Belatedly, it occurs to him that he's only wearing an undershirt, boxers, and his dressing gown, and that he may not have showered in a few days, but then again, Rhodey is probably used to him, and Carol, if she's going to date his best friend, probably should know what to expect from him as well. “I can’t believe you finally had the gumption, gumdrop!”
He reluctantly uncurls his fingers.  One poor sketch is hardly reason to toss an entire book, no matter how wretched he’s feeling.
“This is all pretty good, Cap.  You should show Pepper, she’d appreciate having an art buddy to chat up.”
“I didn’t pin the note to Steve. It’s not as if I sent him down to Bucky’s room with a sign that read
Steve does roll over to face Tony now, pillows and sheets and blankets getting twisted up as he turns. He finds Tony staring at him intently, his deep brown eyes guileless. It’s far more Tony’s nature to tease and poke and make the uncomfortable into the laughable, but there’s no mischievous wink or sly grin now.
“How are you?”  He asks Tony, all too aware of his voice cracking.  His parched lips strain to form the words.  His head is starting to pound and he considers asking Bucky for some water before remembering that the other man is cuffed to the collapsible handrail and won’t be going anywhere.
“You’re the one who offered the blank canvas,” Tony replies, smirking, looking quite pleased with himself. He leans his elbows on Steve’s thighs and runs a finger down the center line of Steve’s stomach.
“I mean it. I know you think you’re invincible now that you’re built like Johnny Weissmuller, but even Tarzan needs shut-eye.”
But Steve never moves his gaze, the flickering images slanting light and shadow over the sharp planes of his handsome face.
“The same way I feel about most of this city, I suppose: I probably shouldn’t be there.”  Tony makes a face at him in response to that ludicrous thought, and Bruce demurs, knowing a losing battle when he sees one.  “What’s on the upper east side?”
He toes off his socks and slowly pads over to the bed. He lifts the covers, sliding in carefully as not to wake Steve, practically holding his breath until he rests his head gently against his own pillow.
Leaning back to control his pace as he starts his downward descent, Steve ponders taking the triangular route, heading southeast to Union Station before turning west toward his and Bucky’s apartment. It would add another seven miles to his journey, but Bucky would probably be up and gone by the time he got home in that case.
The metal door slams shut behind him.  Tony stares at the empty art studio, trying to process everything that just happened.
Steve knows his grin must look incredibly goofy, but he can’t stop it from spreading across his face.
Tony hadn’t realized that Steve was still holding one of his pencils until he hears it snap in Steve’s grip, the upper half tinkling to the floor.  Steve looks down at his hand, his long fingers unfurling slowly and letting go the bottom half of the pencil too.  It rolls away.
“Cap, you’re getting to meet almost everyone who means anything today.” Tony announces as Steve climbs into the backseat beside him.  He points to the broad shouldered man behind the wheel, who in turn tilts his head up to meet Steve’s gaze in the rearview.  “That’s Happy up front there.  Happy, this is Captain Steven America.”
“You're a sweet thing for trying to make excuses, darling. But that wasn't about the film—that was about your Jimmy.”
“It wasn’t really an either/or scenario, Cap.  You’re both going, and it’s not up for debate.  I’m not having two of my best men tied down playing nursemaid.  I have a qualified team of psychiatrists and doctors waiting to do that and both of you are just
“I’m in the middle of ‘Wait, Wait, Don’t Tell Me.’ Bring me a coffee back?”  Happy replies and Tony decides he has to give the guy another raise.  He always knows precisely when he’s needed and when he needs to leave well enough alone.
“Well, something truly extraordinary would have to happen to top that particular tale. I don’t think that’s a challenge I want to take on.”
“You’ve got cash, buy a new one.”  From the look on Steve’s face, that’s a non-option.  “Or here’s a thought, fix it.”
“Well speak of the devil,” Jan purrs, turning toward Bucky and crossing her legs. “Your ears must be burning, Mr. Barnes.”
” Pepper takes him by both shoulders now, forcibly turning him around to face her.  Sometimes he forgets she’s actually rather strong, even without Extremis coursing through her body.  “No amount of work is going to make up for you not being there.”
“This gym has the best and the newest equipment available.” Tony gestures around to all of the machines that Steve has ignored.  “You should really give some a try.”
On the rooftop, he had been caught off guard by something, something strong enough to make him hesitate, make him consider, but he’d shrugged it off and re-focused his efforts.
The room is dark except for the faint moonlight drifting in through the tall, wide windows. After allowing a moment for his eyes to adjust, Tony can make out Steve’s slight form lying on the bed, tucked under the sheets and comforter, laying on his right side with his back to the bedroom door. He takes up so much less space than he used to, the California King mattress so unnecessary for his 5’4” frame. Tony tries to listen to Steve’s breathing to see if he’s asleep or not but he can’t tell from halfway across the room.
“Oh, Tony,” Steve half-sighs, half-cries, surprised by how fast things are going.  One of Steve’s hands settles softly in his hair, and when Tony chances at look upward, Steve’s got his other hand against his own forehead as if he might swoon, color high on his cheeks and his kiss-swollen lips parted as he pants out short, shaky breaths.  Steve closes his eyes tightly, opens them and then closes them again, apparently unable to decide how best to cope with the sensations overwhelming him.  Tony could lie and say that this wasn’t his intention, but he doesn’t see the point.  He kind of wants to blow Steve’s mind before Steve has time to think better of it.
“Not always.”  Steve can hear an edge sharpening in Tony’s voice and knows this could easily go somewhere not so good.  “I do have a mind of my own.”
“That’s a nice thought.  Don’t know how true it is.”  He hands the cigarette back to Steve carefully, the stick half gone.
“To be fair, it’s happened in many stage shows since.  And television shows.  And movies.  There’ve been many fake punches thrown at many fake Hitlers.  Can never have enough Hitler TKOs, if you ask me.”  Tony presses on, not wanting to linger over the embarrassed look on Steve’s face.  “Fury did catch you up to speed on the whole brand of merchandising that went down, y’know, after you supposedly did?  The other lug heads they got to pretend to be you, the comics, all the lunchboxes and the bed sheets and the trading cards-“
But Bucky hadn’t been there when they’d liberated the camps. Bucky had been in a hospital in London and he didn’t know, he didn’t
“I have too many, is the answer, but never enough.” Tony grins at him. “Happy could pick you up every day in a different car for near a month, I think.” Tony’s extravagance should repel him, but that smile sends a spark up Steve’s spine. There’s something about Tony that’s electric, something that makes Steve feel like his whole world is made dull by comparison. Even when he’s saying rude or obnoxious things that logically make Steve recoil, there’s part of him that just wants to hear Tony keep talking if only for the sound of his voice. “You drive, Steve?”
“Kids love superheroes,” Coulson states simply. “There’s already talk, even at Warners.  Maybe a Superman feature, leading into a television serial sometime over the next few years if the movie gets off the ground, no pun intended. I think they’re waiting for television to gain a bit of a stronger presence in suburban markets. Captain America would really be an ideal venture for us in order to get a foothold in that corner of the industry. He’s a
“Besides, I don’t have a pressing need to hear Lady Gaga and if I did, s’pose that’s what an iPod is for.” Steve turns back from the fridge, carton of milk in hand.  Tony hesitates a moment, pulling himself away from evaluating Steve’s living space and focusing back on the conversation.
“To work, yes.  Not to me.  We’re done.”  Tony watches Steve carefully, reading the minute changes in his expression for some sign that maybe Steve’s moral code was the only thing keeping him from acknowledging whatever was happening here.
“It’s not that,” Bucky says, taking a deep breath and narrowing his eyes at him like he’s not all together sure that he should say what he’s about to say.  Steve braces himself for the criticism.
He doesn’t know who this man is with the high-powered sniper rifle, sights focused intently on the center of Tony Stark’s forehead.
“I think that might need that last ‘A’ on the end if he wants anyone to fill in the blanks correctly.”  Tony might have a point there but Steve doesn’t do anything to acknowledge it.
His father had been sure they’d discovered a star, and Tony read all about it in his father’s short missives. Tony couldn't have possibly cared less at the time, and found his father’s focus on wartime propaganda frankly appalling. Howard didn’t want to go to war to save the world; he wanted war because war meant more money in his pocket, and Steve Rogers was going to help him sell the idea to the American public.
The story is a simple one. German soldiers are terrorizing a beachside town in England, clearly conveying that without American intervention, German forces were sure to succeed in their invasion of our closest ally.
Steve slumps. Of course, it was only a matter of time before their newest friends discovered this information about him. It wasn’t exactly a secret. But he’s not really in the mood for the usual song-and-dance tonight: smiling when someone inevitably remembers the theme song, laughing when another someone recalls the tight costume, pretending not to be flustered and embarrassed by his brief time in the spotlight.
“I’m going inside.”  Bucky mutters, patting Steve on the arm.  He pauses at the window before ducking inside.  “Maybe then you can apologize for more than party crashing, Stark.”
“Are you with that boring Henry James flick down there?” Tony points from whence he came. “Then I don’t blame you in the slightest for wandering. That’s precisely what drove me to Brooklyn. And I tell you, I usually avoid Brooklyn when at all possible.”
Tony looks down at the sketchbook in his hands, wondering why it always feels so terrible when he gets exactly what he asked for.
“But you are both from New York, are you not?” Steve snorts over Thor’s question; the man has a point.
Tony won a few games in Luna Park, happily shouting “Science!” whenever he outsmarted what was rigged up.   Steve’s been carrying around a Hulk plushie for half the day as a result.
“Tony…” Bruce is getting up and walking toward Tony, likes he’s concerned Tony’s the one who is going to Hulk out and destroy the room.  Tony shakes Bruce away.
“Better. You can barely tell.” Tony announces, and Steve glances past him toward the mirror. To him it’s glaringly obvious – his lips are rosy and the color on his cheeks high, and he’s far more sweaty than he has any right to be. He looks at Tony, dismay clearly apparent. Tony shrugs. “You’re playing a detective. You
because you told them to. Mindless sycophants aren’t your style. It’s pretty much the only reason I keep working for you.”
“Damn straight I won’t stop,” he agrees, the adrenalin running through his body leaving a bitter taste in his mouth.  He heads to the roof, and after that it’s all a blur.  Practically, he knows at some point he suits up and flies with Bruce to the helicarrier, but the next thing he’s actually aware of is his bloody hand fisting in the lapel of Fury’s black coat as he slams the man into the wall, demanding to see Barnes.
He’s cold again; when he breathes it smells of ice.  Crisp and harsh.  It makes his lungs hurt.  Eventually he hears something over the beating of his own heart.
“Well.”  Bucky doesn’t argue, though it seems he may want to.  “It’s just so we’re clear.  I have your back.”
“I’m fine,” Steve tries to sound reassuring. “I just…I had a bad night last night, that’s all. Didn’t get much sleep. You know how that goes.”
“Yeah, it is.”  Steve agrees softly.  Maybe Clint and Bucky should talk.  Besides Natasha, Clint’s probably the only one who could understand how his best friend feels these days.
Tony pulls himself up from the water slowly, blinking at Steve with a disgruntled yet disbelieving look on his face.  He sets his jaw, ticking it sideways as he grinds his teeth.
Bucky texted a snapshot of the note Tony left behind. The note that basically gave Bucky permission to do anything he wanted with Tony’s boyfriend.
“And what do we do now?” Steve asks, gesturing between them. This isn’t the post-coital conversation he’d intended, and while he’s definitely glad they had it, it’s not quite how he’d wanted their first time to wind up. He’d honestly hoped for a lot more time with Bucky in his arms before they had this out.
“Exactly how are you going to do that, Rogers?  It’s 3000 miles. You can’t exactly ride bitch with Iron Man, and I don’t have a passenger seat.”
“I’m not napping, old man,” Tony cuts him off.  He pushes up, adjusting so he’s straddling Steve’s waist.  He presses the flats of his palms against Steve’s firm pecs, the soft, thin fabric of his t-shirt a barely there barrier between Tony and what he wants.
His smirk falls as he untangles his feet and gets them to the floor, accidentally kicking Loki’s blackmail photographs from the bed to the carpet. He’d passed out last night staring at them hopelessly, tears streaming down his face.
“All right.  You take your shower now, we should get an early start in the a.m.”  His voice shifts into his Captain tone, issuing an order instead of inviting discussion, but it doesn’t make Tony bristle the way it usually does.
, Tony. Don’t be so overdramatic.” Rhodey has the audacity to laugh, which only irks him further. In theory, he knows his friend doesn’t damage the plane on purpose – would in fact do almost anything to avoid it – but he’s so torqued up after this morning that everything is setting him on edge.
“It’s fine, worry about your own damn problems,” Bucky interrupts tersely, immediately feeling horrible when Steve physically recoils. He’d forgotten how much Steve could look like a kicked puppy, big blue eyes so wounded and sad. Bucky sighs softly. “You got enough on your plate without worrying ‘bout me.”
“Then that’s what we’ll do.” Steve agrees. Tony will agree too, he knows, even if Bucky is right about how awkward it will be. Tony will be blunt and provocative and Bucky will be defensive and he…well, he’s probably gonna be some weird, fumbling combination of stubborn and unsure that’s going to send Bucky and Tony all kinds of wrong signals he never intends. He’s going to have to do a lot more research between now and then so he can be better prepared for the discussion.
“You’re right, I don’t believe you.”  She leaves the door open in a silent instruction for them to come back inside.  “I’ll get some towels.”  She calls back over her shoulder with the practiced air of someone who’s had to do something like this many times before.
Steve leans into it, and Bucky’s deft metal fingers brush gently through the thin strands of his hair.
Tony puts space back between them as they both chuckle nervously over the abrupt intrusion of reality.
“You’re more than welcome to stay out, Tony.  I can certainly find my own way back, I don’t want to put a damper on your evening.”  Steve takes two steps backward, but Tony advances.
She looks up from her laptop and gives him a grateful smile when he slides the glass onto the coffee table beside her heavy binder of governmental regulations.
“It’s very…Cubist.” Steve searches for the right spin, wanting Thor to be proud of his efforts.  “Picasso would love it.”
Captain America and his compatriots successfully battle the Germans back to the shore, where they scurry back to their boats and presumably retreat to mainland Europe. The adoring townsfolk praise Captain America for his efforts, and a sweet bonny lass innocently bats her eyelashes and kisses her hero chastely on the cheek in gratitude.
He thinks it’s perfect until Happy rolls up to Madison Square Garden and Steve gets out.  He stares at the building, and then casts about for a street sign, and then looks back at the building with utter dismay.
“I’m sorry that I couldn’t…” Bucky reaches out, like he wants to touch, but stops halfway through the movement.  Steve backs away to put some space between them.
be angry. He shouldn't be thinking about how Tony would feel pressed up against him, or how he would taste.
“I wanted you from the moment I saw you.”  Tony blurts just as Steve is slipping a piece of French toast onto Tony’s plate.  Steve stops in the middle of what he’s doing, a bit surprised by the seriousness of Tony’s tone.  “I’ve wanted you
Tony waits, feeling so strangely out of his element. He’s tempted to either interrupt with some rude comment or witty observation, or to leave all together.  When Bucky suggested that Tony show up this evening and help show Steve a good time, Tony had figured on a more formal
He immediately notices two things.  Cap looks like shit, and he’s not alone.  He comments on the first of these observations, taken aback by how drawn and pale Steve appears.  A quick scan with Extremis tells him Steve’s heart rate is up, though that can’t account for how Steve’s usually bright blue eyes seem dull and utterly lifeless.
Steve's hand leaves his mouth and trails down his neck, tracing the path Tony's lips had traveled again and again.
“I don’t, really.”  Tony’s gaze travels pointedly down to the cigarette still clasped between his fingers.  Steve’s first instinct is to stub it out but he resists, feeling like it would just be a capitulation to Tony’s judgment.  “Did you need something?”
, Steve repeats inwardly as he tosses the tomatoes into a frying pan. They sizzle as they hit the olive oil.
“You up for some biometric tests later?  I’m working on a lighter weight alloy for the suit, trying to up the speed, and I’d like to -“
And Tony is touching his Steve, and kissing him, and making him laugh, and pulling him close without pretense, and it's not okay that Tony gets to have that when he never could.
Steve seems to get it together and Tony feels himself being practically dragged along, barely needing to control his muscles as Steve nearly carries him through the crowd.  He doesn’t think his toes are even touching the ground.  Steve finds an usher, a young looking kid petrified by the sight in front of him.
Steve pulls him down as much as Tony pushes in, surging toward one another fast and roughly enough to make the couch creak.
“Soulé likes me, he can give us the back room.” Tony tosses back over his shoulder as he darts across the foyer toward the grand staircase leading up to his private quarters.
“Why, you little punk.”  Tony uses his whole arm to sweep water in Steve’s direction.  Soon they’re both laughing and out of breath.
Guiltily, he looks to his right, through the floor-to-ceiling windows, to where Steve sits inside, resting on the oversized couch in the sunken living room. Steve had once told him that before the Battle of New York left it partially in rubble, the room had been black marble and gold trim and shining glass, a full bar and a huge, black leather couch, but now it’s more subdued, homey. Still like Tony, but with more Steve.
If they were still just friends, if tonight hadn’t happened, he’d go in.  But things have changed, and entering Steve’s bedroom right now would mean something else.  He’d be going in for different reasons, needing answers to far more difficult questions.
“I don’t want to be in it. Your movie. That’s not for me.” Steve states as he stares across the table at Tony, feeling strangely compelled to clarify that it’s just the film specifically that he’s turning down.
“Thor, what are you carving into your pumpkin?” Steve asks loudly, stamping out Clint and Tony’s friendly argument before it stops being friendly.
“JARVIS?  Something nice and slow,” Tony commands loudly and “Because You Loved Me” emanates from Tony’s phone, the sound clear even from inside Tony’s pocket.  Steve chuckles.
“Ah.”  Steve curls his fingers around the cuffs of his blue hoodie, pulling at the sleeves.  But he can’t stop himself from giving in and reaching for his sketches.  “Could you…?” Tony steps away and Steve pulls his hand back.  He covers the aborted move by awkwardly running his fingers through his hair, pretending that’s what he meant to do all along.  Then he shoves his hands into the front pockets of his sweatshirt to stop himself from reaching again.
But give ‘em a little rain, and inside they’ll stay.  Navigating crowded sidewalks is difficult enough without adding umbrellas to the mix, and Steve has noticed that while umbrellas may be smaller, people today are far less cordial and careful than they used to be.  Someone almost took his eye out the other day as he walked back home from the Guggenheim.
Steve turns and goes to the kitchen, apparently deciding that whatever Tony’s business might be at this hour, it is clearly not Avengers-related and therefore he can, at the very least, stand down.  Tony follows him slowly, stopping to lean against the open doorway between the living room and kitchen.
been the one to make Steve’s fantasies a reality. He’s the one who got to make Steve fall apart in his arms while the rest of the world slept on.
“You were saying something about plans, Steve?” Bucky mutters, tossing the wad of shirts to the floor at his feet. He pushes up from the bed and stalks out, bumping Tony’s shoulder as he goes. Tony tries and fails to conceal a wince.
“I thank you for the overwhelming vote of confidence, sir.” Pepper hangs up, and that once-promising light on the telephone goes dark a moment later.
“Thank you, Pepper.”  Bruce bites the edge of his thumb as his gaze ticks from Pepper to Tony and back and forth again.  He seems to be waiting for Pepper to do something more than stand there and watch Tony pace.
“I like you wearing my clothes,” Tony whispers, fingers sliding underneath Steve’s borrowed tee. He can feel the ridges of Steve’s rib cage, the way his stomach concaves as he sucks in a sharp breath. “I like that when I mark you now, it stays there for days.” He tugs down the crew neck collar of the t-shirt and his lips find the bruise on Steve’s collarbone that he’d made days ago. “I like that you’re mine and everyone knows it.”
“Is there anything worthwhile even left on St. Mark’s these days?  Fucking Pinkberry,” Natasha snipes venomously.  “And there’s a god damn Jamba Juice in the Bowery, what the hell.”
Bucky and Natasha sit opposite, stoic and silent but with their knees touching.  Tony smiles, amused; for them that’s the equivalent of a Times Square kiss on V-J Day.
“Don’t stop on my account, big boy.”  Tony holds up his hands and Bruce raises an eyebrow, lets out a small sigh.
.  Just the description makes him think back to sitting in the balcony at the Paramount, stealing sideways glimpses at Bucky, watching the flickering light play over his handsome features.  Occasionally Buck would catch him looking and give him a knowing smile like they were sharing a secret.
“What do you need me for?” Steve manages to get out the question without sounding too eager or too desperate. Tony doesn't need to know how lost and longing he's been for weeks, especially when Tony couldn't be bothered to care then, or, seemingly, now.
believe it, even as his eyes trace the sharp planes of Bucky’s cheekbones, the lush pout of his lips, that beautiful icy blue of his irises that always reminded him of the fall sky over New York Harbor on a rainy day.
“I was just about to make breakfast, would you like something to eat?”  Steve gently offers.  He’s not sure why Pepper’s here at 7am on a Monday morning, but she seems a little distressed so he decides not to press her with questions.
He reaches down and grips the bottom hem of Tony’s black tee, lifting upward and giving Tony no choice but to go with it.  Steve tosses the shirt aside and pulls Tony back close, the following kiss deep and quite thorough.  He’s really good at this kissing thing, good enough that Tony’s actually feeling a bit dizzy.  Steve’s hands start to work at his belt and zipper and it takes him a minute to catch up to the action.
He had needed to get out.  He had needed to make sure, somehow, that he wasn’t the only one feeling as he did.
.” Steve rests his elbow on the armrest and his head against his hand, tilting his face to look at Bucky across the length of the couch. He smiles softly at his best friend as the realization dawns over his handsome face. “Why do you think I’m here, exactly?”
“You’re here now.” It’s as simple as he can put it.  All that other stuff doesn’t matter.  No matter what happens next, Bucky is still Bucky.  They’ll strip the rest away like the garbage that it is; somehow give Bucky back his life.  He doesn’t know how they’ll do it but he has faith they’ll figure out a way.   “We’re both here.”
“Or maybe it’s Natasha.  I’ve seen the way you look at her, the way she looks at you – are you going to be the man who’s man enough for her?  Or maybe you’re beholden to a bunch of stupid memories.  Being strong for good old Peggy, still trying to impress
But Tony’s prattling does distract him from the fact they’re not really pointlessly meandering; he realizes too late that Tony has a destination in mind.  Their journey ends at a ‘40s style swing club well off the main drag.  Strains of “Chattanooga Choo-Choo” blast from inside whenever someone opens the front door to go in or out.  Twenty-first century men and women go passed him dressed in styles that, for him, were current six months ago.  Steve’s past is a nostalgic curiosity for them, something to be put on for fun like a Halloween costume.
“I think your tea’s ready,” Tony says as he enters.  Steve starts, jolting a little and reflexively putting his hand out to steady himself.  The sound of flesh sizzling against the hot metal makes Tony wince in sympathy.
“I think…I think maybe he felt weird about letting himself in and using your gym without even saying hello to anyone?  The guy’s polite.”  Bruce sounds unsure about his theory, but to Tony the basic hypothesis seems correct.
“You keep mommying them and they’re never going to leave,” Tony warns as Steve grabs four more bottles, knowing enough to grab double for Thor.
“We’ll do what we have to do.”  Bruce gently moves Pepper aside and walks into the elevator beside Tony as it opens. Pepper looks at him plaintively, her wide eyes begging him to stop and think this through.
That’s his weakness showing through, however. He shouldn’t – can’t – turn this into anything sexual or romantic. No matter how badly he wants it, that part of their relationship has to be over.
“Can’t have that.”  Honestly, he remembers the names of every public figure discussed who “came out”, as they’re apparently calling it these days, as if they’re debutantes stepping out in fancy white dresses, hoping to catch a future husband.  Terminology aside, living openly like that…at the time he kept thinking to himself:
“That has yet to be proven.  Besides, we could easily just get some beans to take home and have it all time.  Actually – isn’t that what we already do?  I distinctly remember buying both a grinder and a French Press-”
“Oh Stevie honey, Stark Industries has season box seats at every sporting venue in the city.  It’s an expense that every big business has – they make great gifts, they’re good spots for a night out on the town with clients, and are excellent places to close deals.  We have our very own permanent suite.”
Tony winks at him, mistaking his very real confusion as purposely playing dumb, and lifts up on his toes to peck Steve on the lips. Right in front of him, just like that.
Tony is leaning leisurely in the open doorway, backlit warmly by the bright lights from the party inside.  His black bowtie is hanging undone around his open collar, half empty glass of champagne held loosely in his hand.  He’s devastatingly handsome in his black tuxedo, managing to look both distinguished and debauched.
“Peter, I…” Tony starts soberly, really about to make this some kind of heart-to-heart, but then pauses, registering that something isn’t wrong so much as weird.
“Hmm.” Tony nods once and Steve just sort of shrugs again, not sure what else to say now that the vehicular inquisition has ended.
Steve leans forward, runs a finger down the side of his juice glass, cutting a trail through the condensation there.  He opens his mouth to say something but instead mumbles:
“I’m fine,” Steve protests weakly as Tony sits down, leaving only a foot of space between them.  He leans back, throws his legs up on the coffee table and his arms across the back of the couch.
“No. It doesn’t.” Bucky reaches out, wanting to still Steve’s hand, maybe hold it in his own. But Steve moves away, bringing his hand up to cover his mouth as he coughs again.
“Fine.” Peter gulps, hoping Tony doesn’t come anywhere near him. He’s hard, and he’s sweating, and even though he’s trying so desperately to think about something,
Tony decides not to needle Steve right now, instead flirting amiably with Suzanne, the elderly waitress, and ordering the world’s largest coffee for himself and a glass of orange juice for Steve.
“Well.”  Tony stands, re-claiming the seat next to him and sliding his arm behind his shoulders.  He has a triumphant smirk on his face as he leans in.  “Then I guess I just got
Steve is climbing from the pool, water streaming down that vast expanse of his back, down his strong legs.  He’s wearing dark trunks that amount to little more than boxer briefs as they cling to his skin, leaving nothing to the imagination.  Yet Tony’s imagination runs
“Huh.”  Tony contemplates this for a moment, and then glances around the lab.  “Why was he down here?  Gym’s three floors up.”  Tony shoots Bruce a quizzical look.
Tony crosses to the fridge and grabs a bottle of water, needing a task to keep him from colorfully expressing his frustration.
They easily could have never met, and when they did, Tony had irrationally wanted to punch Steve’s perfect, perfect face.  Everything about the guy was naturally, effortlessly amazing and Tony could not stand it.  He was cynicism’s kryptonite, seemingly inspiring unabashed love and admiration from everyone at a time when no one wanted to admit to liking anything or anyone.
Steve wraps a hand around the base of his cock and presses himself to Tony’s entrance. He stops there, with just the head inside.
“Well, Pepper said it was important, and she’s not one to lie.” Steve replies. Though it sounds off-hand, it cuts Tony deeply. He falters a little in his next step, then tightens the smile on his face.
“Hey,” he murmurs back.  For a moment Steve wishes she were the kind of person who gave out hugs.  Seeing as she’s not, Natasha takes his hand and gives it a gentle squeeze.  A faint smile softens her expression considerably.
Even though Tony had handled the crowd of the baseball game with remarkable aplomb, Steve fears this may be different.  When the doors open, Steve acts on instinct, grabbing Tony’s hand and taking the lead, using his considerable size to clear a straight path through the swarm of people toward the stairs.  He knows he can be intimidating when he absolutely needs to be and at this moment, he needs to be.
Steve lifts an eyebrow and nudges the box toward him, not saying anything more.  Tony ignores the pizza and tilts the bottle of booze back, reading the label.
“Like…this?” Tony lowers his mouth to his, lips parting softly. “Or, like this?” Tony’s words brush against his lips and then Tony kisses him harder, filthier, his tongue sliding deep.
Steve chuckles to himself, trying to think back to the last time he celebrated a new year with anything but apprehension.
“No, that’s you,” Bucky corrects, chuckling.  Steve doesn’t believe that but it’s never seemed to matter.  “Never wanted or needed to make a ton of friends, Steve.  Not when I had you.”
Tony lifts his head from the pillow and looks up blearily at Bucky, who is sitting up against the headboard. He’s still naked, bed sheets loose around his waist, and his long hair is pulled back in a loose ponytail, wayward strands falling down around his face. He has a thick hardcover book cradled in his hands, evidently able to make out the words in the pale moonlight.
“I’m not done, I –” Sam nods his head toward the exit exaggeratedly, eyes widening at Clint.  “Oh.  Yeah.  Right, tell ‘em we’re out there.”
“I’ll give you a call later this week.” Steve pats the top of the piano twice with his palm and then gives Sam a small wave goodnight.
“Wouldn't want that,” Tony mumbles, but not low enough that they can't hear. Jan rolls her eyes and inappropriately gives Steve a tap on his butt as he walks behind the brass and green brocade dressing screen.
It takes some fumbling before he manages to bring the receiver to his ear, only catching the tail end of Pepper’s sentence.
Part of him wants to ask why.  Tony had expected Steve to be at SHIELD HQ every damn day, absolutely refusing to leave until he was allowed to see his friend.  He figured Steve would be an obstinate and determined pain in Fury’s ass until the man relented and granted Steve access against Barnes’ wishes.
“Nothing.” Tony shrugs.  It’s a bit mean to deliberately keep the guy unsettled, but he can’t stand side-by-side on solid ground with Steve.  In every situation with every person, someone always has the upper hand, so it best be him.  His sense of self-preservation is innate and overwhelmingly strong.
Steve makes a note to run all the information onscreen by Dr. Banner later.  He’ll remember what’s in the file, but he doesn’t know what any of it means.  Bruce will have to be the one to make heads or tails of it.   He can see the strange arm, resting listlessly by Bucky’s side.  He’ll ask Tony too.  Tony will know about biomechanical extensions; from what he can gather at a quick glance, that’s what Bucky’s inorganic arm is being referred to as.
talented,” Tony says, hooking a finger through one of Steve’s belt loops and placing his other hand on Steve’s hip to steady him, wanting to keep in contact even as they stumble over someone’s purse left on the floor.  He cops a feel of Steve’s firm ass.  “So very talented.”
“Yeah.  He thinks Pepper’s swell.”  After many years spent on the sidelines himself, Steve’s well acquainted with the look of someone pining.  Happy has had that look as long as Steve’s known him.
,” Steve mumbles when he finally stops hacking, his voice rough and hollow. He crumples up the tissue in aggravation, tight in the ball of his fist. He draws his legs in close and leans his head against his knees. It hurts Bucky to hear him struggling to breathe.
“Well we were just about done anyway.”  If Natasha’s bolting, so is he.  She’s barely making an effort to conceal this attempt to leave him alone with Tony and Steve resents her for it.  Last night had been such an elaborate ruse that he’d been slightly charmed, but her dashing out of here like the gym is on fire is a bludgeon past subtle.
“Maybe. I don’t know.” Tony leaves him unsettled, and if he’s honest with himself, it’s not just because Tony had been rude and arrogant. It’s because despite those things, Steve had still felt drawn to him. That spark of annoyance had lit something else on fire inside of him, something much, much harder to douse.
He bites back a curse and grabs the pan, taking it off the heat.  It’s too late though; they’re pretty much destroyed.  He’ll still eat them so they don’t go to waste, but he can’t offer them to Pepper like this.
“You taste so good,” Tony murmurs, curving his lips into a teasing smile. “Must be all that clean living, Captain America.”
Granted, it’s the third floor he’s done this to, but property damage is easier to deal with than casualties so he’ll take it.
Well, he’s always wanted Bucky to kiss him, but the need for it now is overwhelming and sharp, like his brain had suddenly grasped that this thing he never thought would ever happen can now happen. Is going to happen. Finally.
He can see Clint and Natasha casing the place as they move through the hallway – he’d expect nothing less, really – but it surprises him to see Cap moving so warily.
“You askin’ me to sign a long term contract, Tony, or are you askin’ me to go steady?” Steve is careful to keep his reply light, just in case he’s misreading the subtext.
“We’ll figure out something better for next time.” Tony comments, tightening his arm around Steve’s waist as much as he possibly can.  The last thing he wants to do is drop Captain America somewhere over the middle of Kansas.  Steve nods tersely, firmly in assault mode and his mind on the mission alone.
“Is everything all right?  I didn’t get a call from Director Fury.”  Steve is already near full alertness and his tone is brimming with concern.  Tony could guarantee that if someone had woken
His own cock is leaking so he gathers up some of the liquid dripping from the head and strokes it down Steve’s hard length, trying to make the slide of his hand less rough and dry. It doesn’t last for long before it’s rubbed entirely into Steve’s skin, but Steve pushes whimpers of pleasure into the fabric of his pillowcase, thrusts his hips to meet Tony’s sliding grip, so Tony keeps going. He pumps a little faster, a little harder, as he kisses and sucks and licks around and into Steve’s ass, biting back on his own noises of satisfaction.
“I get it. No more blind dates.” Natasha takes his hand and pulls him back toward the house. Bucky and Darcy are laughing raucously over something now, Thor holding Jane in his arms as they look on, fondly. “But Steve, you’re kidding yourself if you think you’re not
“I’ll be on my best behavior, try not to sweep you off your feet.” He manages a charming smile despite his blush.
Steve rocks back and forth on his heels slightly, tilting his head upward to look at the sky once more.
“He’s like I was, he can’t catch anything…give anything…” Steve explains, suddenly wishing he had expressly cleared that with Tony before foregoing the condoms. It’s true about Bucky, but there’s still the intimacy of it, and before this weekend Tony had been the only one ever to…
Steve gasps lightly at the stretch, at the feeling of being so full as Bucky slides in, inch by inch. He stares up at Bucky and Bucky’s gaze refuses to waver from his until he’s fully seated. Then his eyes flicker closed for just a moment as if he’s overcome.
Steve smiles and drinks because he can’t bring himself to care one way or the other.  It actually feels good to let Tony ply him with booze, to let Tony singlehandedly carry the conversation.  It feels so easy, warm and companionable that he wonders if the alcohol might be having an effect after all.
“Here we go,” Tony mumbles to himself as the lights fully dim. He stubs out his cigar and makes a show of rubbing his hands together and leaning forward in anticipation, making a mockery of the very idea that this could be more than an exercise in futility.
Tony leans in to kiss Steve again but he feels Steve tense under his hands, the muscles of Steve’s chest and stomach tightening as he sucks a deep breath in.  Tony sighs in response to Steve’s obvious hesitation, even as Steve’s lips part in an incredibly inviting way.
“First you won’t let it go when I turn you down, now you’re second-guessing when I accept?” Steve starts walking up the beach toward the stairway like he’s making to leave, but his tone is gentle and teasing.
Steve doesn’t expect to see Tony again before he leaves, but immediately after Bruce is situated with Betty in medical, Tony tracks him and Clint down on the communal floor.  Clint is already on his third beer, quite hyped up about the day’s goings on.
“A rousing success then.”  Pepper rests her head on his shoulder, runs her hand down his arm until she twines her fingers with his.  “Don’t worry.  You figure out a solution to every problem eventually; you’ll find a solution to this.  You’ll make it work.”
“We’d…share you?” Bucky sounds a little surprised, but he shifts closer on the couch, his metal arm unfurling across the length of its back. Steve’s not sure he likes the word
“What are you so happy about?”  Steve asks, tired but curious.  Considering Bruce is passed out in the back after days of flipping personalities, Sam’s suit is good and busted and Clint hasn’t said two words since going into stoic post-battle mode, there logically isn’t much to smile over.  Even Thor is down, staring off into space pensively and wearing a stern frown usually reserved only for his brother.
“What are you working on?”  Steve asks after a beat, though it seemed like he really wanted to say something else.  His brow furrows a little as he makes a vague, hopeless gesture toward Tony’s workbench.
“No, it's Loki's shill. It seems he's taken quite the interest in your new leading man. There's been at least a blurb, if not a full story, about Rogers near every day in
“Not so wonderful.” Steve doesn’t bother lying.  Natasha nods a little, her full lips tightening into a stern frown.  Her hair’s a little longer, and there’s a new scar fading on her forehead.  There’s a bandage wrapped around her wrist, partially obscured by the long sleeves of her black shirt.  Time once again marched on without him.
“If it means I can be with you, Steve, even some of the time…” Bucky whispers, and Steve nods slowly. He wants Bucky to kiss him, all of a sudden.
“Should I ever tell him?  That I met her?”  The jazz band winds down their lengthy jam and the bar becomes less loud by half.
He waves and smiles and poses until both his face and his feet hurt, until his tie feels too tight around his throat, until Wanda gives his hand a sharp squeeze and whispers through gritted teeth that he’s gripping her too hard. Steve mumbles an apology and unwraps his fingers from her arm; he really hadn’t realized.
“Bruce, would you like-“ Jane’s offer is interrupted by an abrupt knock on the door.  Everyone stops, exchanging curious looks.
They kiss like they need each other to breathe, and Steve fucks him like he’s trying to split Tony apart. Tony is crying out, high and breathy, and his grip is tight enough to turn his knuckles white. Steve would worry about hurting him if Tony weren’t begging for more whenever he pauses to gasp for air.
Steve has no idea what stands in that paradoxically infinitesimal yet vast space between them.  Tony isn’t sure that he ever wants to tell him; he isn’t sure what he’d say.
Steve pushes all the way with one smooth movement, bottoming out with his hips flush to Tony’s backside. He groans at the tight, wet heat enveloping his length so easily.
“That’s our Stevie,” Bucky replies, chuckling. He’s having far too much fun with this, and Steve dreads to think of how long it may take to live this evening down. Bucky plops down at the table across from Jan and loosens his tie, props his feet up on the other chair beside him. “So, tell me, how’s the shoot going? Steve here won’t tell me a damn thing.”
As scared as he is of being a powerless cog in someone else’s machine, he’s equally scared of being powerless to this immoral desire, the need to
“What about you, Tony?” Bucky’s fingers dig into his hips, his words slightly sharp. “You want to come inside my boyfriend’s body?”
Steve pulls the shower curtain back slowly. He knows what he must look like; Tony had probably come in half-expecting to find him curled in a ball, a sobbing mess on the floor, and instead he’s standing here solidly, dripping wet and fully hard.
“Steven is of the most modest sort!”  Thor’s broad palm lands on his shoulder.  “My father would hold him in the highest regard, for humility is a quality upon which he places great value.”
“It’s for a project,” Steve bypasses whatever conversation Tony is trying to have and just addresses the unspoken question.  “I thought I’d try my hand at something…bigger.”
It kind of takes Tony’s breath away.  Seventy years gone by.  Years of mental contamination, of having his identity toyed with; unable to trust his own thoughts and memories and James Buchanan Barnes still understood Steve like it was second nature.  Like their friendship was something intrinsic and absolute, unaffected and unchangeable by even the most severe circumstances.
short reels!” Bucky grins widely, his teeth clenching down on the cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth. Steve cheeks flush in embarrassment even though those silly films were over years ago now. Bucky’s gotten enough mileage out of them that they should no longer matter, yet he still can make Steve turn pink at the mere mention of them.
“Thanks, Tony,” Steve murmurs, drawing his head back slightly.  He smiles, really meaning it.  Tony’s returning smile seems a little broken, and he visibly swallows before responding.
Steve opens it all the way, still dripping wet, his pale skin flushed from the heat of the shower.  A threadbare white towel is slung low at his waist, sitting loose around his hips like all Tony would have to do is brush against him to make it fall off.
“That’s precisely what I mean.  I don’t usually get comfortable.  Settling in doesn’t exactly agree with me.”
One might think that the emptiness of the park might be due to the explosions that rocked the harbor yesterday.  Maybe people are more likely to remain in the safety of their homes, keep their children close.  But Steve knows that’s not it.
Steve’s on the brink of orgasm already, as if his body knows time is limited, and he tries to stutter out a warning to Tony. For a moment he thinks Tony is going to swallow, feeling him hesitate in pulling off, and that alone makes him lose control. Tony pulls off mid-thrust, however, angling the spray back over Steve’s chest to join the mess Tony already made on Steve’s skin.
“How was the show?” Tony mumbles into Steve’s shirt, feeling Steve’s whole body stiffen up almost imperceptibly in his hold.
He seems so far away, somehow, and Tony wants to go down there, if only for the sake of being closer.
“I only mean that you, of all parties interested and concerned and willing, are maybe not the best choice for this.  You know your head’s a mess when it comes to him.”
Pepper, who is already reaching down to pick up his black bowtie, instinctively reaches for them. The second they are in hand, she freezes, the color draining from her face.
He’s barefoot, clad only in his white boxers and undershirt. His brown hair is in desperate need of a comb and his prosthetic arm is already off for the night. He still manages to seem threatening.
“I’ll just sit here quietly then?” He sighs.  Clint echoes him, reaching out and patting him on the shoulder.
When Steve startles awake in the middle of the night, he expects to find himself alone.  It’s not until his heartbeat has settled steady in his chest and his eyes have adjusted to the darkness that he makes out a shape across the room, slumped in one of the uncomfortable plastic chairs.
“What about that other one, that Luke, or Lucky, or…” Tony snaps his fingers repeatedly as he takes another long drink of his coffee, urging Pepper to fill in the right name he’s looking for.
Because the truth is, everyone went their own separate ways that day, casual goodbyes and thoughtless assumptions that those next times would just work themselves out.  Fury would call them in; the world would need them once more.
Steve tries to smile and not to squint in the glare as Wanda guides him the length of the forecourt, traversing the new covered walkway that had replaced the rows of palm trees. They move ever so slowly along toward the renovated lobby. He’d asked Jan to be his date for the evening, but Pepper insisted that he and Wanda play the item. The suggestion of so publicly stepping out with Jan before her divorce was final – despite the fact they weren’t romantic in the slightest – had made Pepper’s face go tight enough that Steve has to admit he caved despite his principles.
He looks to each person in the room, searching for some sign that this is a terrible, sick joke.  No one will look at him and he wants to yell at them all, ask them what the hell they think they’re doing.
Steve sets his lips in a thin line and takes his time picking the words to use to explain this to Tony.  He stares off past the tree line into the darkness, trying not to think of the last time he ever saw Bucky, trying to remember the first time he ever did.  He’d been ten; his father dead before he was born, his mother already gone three years, and his grandmother had passed four days before.  He had no more family left.  The other boys were already on his back, and he’d arrived at dinner with his shirt ripped, a split lip and a fresh black eye.  Bucky sat down next to him and silently offered his piece of bread.
Tony stops under the arch, the white stone basking in the glow from the floodlights at its base.  Steve gazes up at it and then down the Fifth Avenue thoroughfare back in the direction of Union Square.  He’d never been able to see the Arc de Triomphe or the Champs-Élysées while in Europe, having crashed into the Artic before Paris was liberated from Nazi control, but he always imagined that it’d just feel like a needlessly bigger version of this.
Beyond the blinding light he can see movement.  Someone is shouting in Russian.  There’s a wild beeping, shrill and insistent.  A face, half covered in a white mask, hair tucked up underneath blue paper…wide blue worried eyes looking at him from behind plastic glasses.  It’s a woman, he thinks, vaguely.  He’s not sure why he thinks that.
need to say yes to my offer, Steve.” Tony is caressing his chest and stomach and it takes a moment for Steve to process the abrupt change in topic.
“Oh, I dunno, I think I’ll miss the sound of Thor singing in the shower.” Bruce comments idly, slowly looking up from his reading for a moment and adjusting his glasses.
.” God, had she been a beaut, all shined up in red, white and blue, so perfectly balanced and streamlined for Rhodey’s complicated aerobatics. His modifications to the Boeing Stearman 75 had made the
“Good Captain!  You have awoken!  Come, I have made myriad flavors of delicious pastry to break fast with you all.”
“Have fun last night?” Pepper asks loudly, knowing full well how much pain he’s in. Tony shoves the paper aside and reaches for the coffee he knows she has.
“Stark…” Steve sighs, re-adjusting the tape on his hands to give his brain something else to focus on instead of how difficult Tony can be.  As a tactic, it fails.  “Why do you insist on saying things you
“I’m fine, I’m fine.” She doesn’t look at all convinced. “I’m just bored. I’m used to having more to do.”
He follows Tony to The Players Club, a long, three-level white building with terra cotta shingles and burnt orange awnings that sits in the shadow of the Chateau. Cars are lined up near door-to-door along the building’s front, lights from inside the three different restaurants and the dance hall making all that chrome and polished glass twinkle and shine against the darkness.
“By the way, Steve’s here.”  Her voice echoes back, an offhand punch to his gut.  He startles mid-drink, water dribbling down his chin and all over the front of his favorite AC/DC shirt.
“Look,” Tony holds up his hands in a gesture of surrender, as if Steve is already fighting him on it when in truth he’s still processing the words. “I’d be the first to admit that I didn’t want to go anywhere near that
“Just because he’s on your payroll now, doesn’t mean you can bother him at all hours.” Bucky takes a step half in front of Steve, shielding him from Tony.
gesture with his right hand. Tony makes a face at him, still reluctant. “You know it’s gonna come down to talkin’ to either me or Pepper – you really want to discuss this, whatever this is, with her?”
“You make it sound so personal, Buck,” Steve chuckles. He contemplates taking a drag of the cigarette, but stubs it out in the overflowing ashtray. Bucky opens the fridge and pulls out a beer, opening it using the edge of the countertop in that way that Steve hates. It gouges the tile and it’s already beat to hell as it is. “It’s not like we’re ever crossing paths with the man.”
“Probably Happy coming up the hill,” Tony guesses, though there’s really no way the sweep of his headlights would break through the trees here at the back of the house. But his property is guarded and gated and quite frankly, built into the side of a steep cliff, so he doesn’t know what else it could be. “Or lightning – maybe there’s a storm coming in.”
all the time if Bucky and Natasha would finally settle in for the long haul, if he could love someone like Jan. It would be so straightforward. Simple.
before.  I’ve had just about every adjective in the world thrown at me.  But never that one.  Hurts a little.  Stings.  Gotta be honest.”
Steve sighs, dragging his gaze from the sharp lines of Bucky’s face to once again take in the sight of Manhattan.
“Wait.” Steve calls out and Loki stops with his hand on the door. He pivots back on his heel with a sly, knowing grin. He thinks he’s won, and the truth is, he has.
It was the house of some high-level executive at MGM and the guests had been strictly A-list. Considering he’s not exactly Hollywood glitterati, the invitation clearly meant he’d piqued the interest of
Then he remembers that Steve is Steve; dressing for vindictive purposes isn’t really his style. It is Jan’s style, though, and the whole outfit is a bit more fashionable than Steve’s usual combination of plaid button-downs and khaki pants.
Steve has no idea what that actually means, but he can take a guess that it somehow involves their friends conspiring to get him and Tony in the same place at the same time without either of them begging off.
With this in mind, Steve puts on his best happy face, takes Pepper’s arm and presents her to the group.  “I think you know almost everyone now that you’ve met Jane.  And Darcy, that’s Darcy over there.  She works as an assistant to Dr. Foster.”
“We went out tonight and Clint and Natasha had a little too much to drink, so I brought them back here.”
“Man’s got a point.” Sam and Clint bump fists in acknowledgment.  “Speaking of which, you guys need more disaster movies here to build this theme up, FYI.
“May I take a moment?”  Steve asks, waiting for permission before going to the double doors leading out to the stone patio.
In Manhattan, Tony once saw himself, writ large with neon signs and massive billboards, street grids marking off organized chaos that just seemed so perfect and brilliant in its irrational sanity.  Manhattan was to him a perfect paradox – logical and illogical all at once.
Tony ignores Maria’s sarcasm and shakes his head sadly, flicking his hand toward the projectionist dismissively. The playback is switched off, the film shuttering to a stop.
Their HYDRA target is one and the same, and while the Winter Soldier could deftly handle the situation with single-handed stealth, Captain America is with his team, with his Avengers.
Tony throws himself down onto one of the leather armchairs arranged along the wall across from Pepper’s desk, slouching petulantly like an angry child. Pepper eyes him wearily.
?” Tony asks, though he knows full well what.  “We’ll hang them in your room after they’re out of storage, all right?”
Steve has him arm slung over Bucky’s shoulders; Bucky has his mechanical arm wrapped familiarly around Steve’s waist.  The thing looks so damn close to real now that it’s obvious SHIELD’s furnished an upgrade.  Tony can’t bring himself to care that the new tech isn’t his.  Steve and Bucky are both wearing similar blue t-shirts, looking like poster boys for the American Dream, and it’s thoroughly obnoxious.
“I shouldn’t be going around trying to kiss other people’s boyfriends anyway.” Steve sinks all the way to the ground, adjusting so he’s sitting on the hard tile with his legs curled in toward his body.
Tony slides back in as he takes Steve’s still hard cock in hand, overstimulation setting Steve off like a live wire.
Tony tends to give him gifts at the slightest provocation.  Steve thought it a given that he was doing it for the others as well, slipping them small presents under bare pretenses like May Day and Mardi Gras, but maybe he shouldn’t have assumed.
“It’s been a long week. Everyone has them, now and again, even me,” He reasons, but Nick doesn’t look at all convinced.
Clint glances his direction; he must look as apprehensive and concerned as he feels, because Clint’s expression quickly turns apologetic.
Tony stretches out his legs, knocking his feet against Steve’s ankles.  He gives Steve a weak smile and Steve seems to get it, because he unbends his own long legs and they sit there quietly with their legs touching until the buzzer sounds over twenty minutes later.
“Yet.”  Tony echoes, as if pointing out there’s plenty of time left to learn.  Steve tilts his head to look at him and finds Tony staring right back, directly into his eyes like he’d just been waiting for Steve to turn to face him.  Tony’s eyes are wide and dark and unblinking, his expression soft, maybe even fond.  The breeze rustles gently through Tony’s dark hair and Steve curls his fingers around the wooden railing to keep himself from touching.
“But he didn’t see mine!” Darcy exclaims. “For god’s sake, Jane, you’re in public relations, yet you couldn’t smooth the way a little? Talk me up, sell the goods.”  She fluffs her curly brown hair, then adjusts the off-the-shoulder straps of her red dress, pulling the whole ensemble
Tony watches Pepper go and then turns to the group, plastering on a bright smile and jiggling the bottle of wine.
for so long hits him with its full force, and for the first time he doesn’t try to fight it, or handle it.  He lets it all through.
“Good.”  Bucky puts his hand on the curved root of the pumpkin, metal fingers tapping the hard surface.  “But if he hurts you, Steve…I swear I’m gonna hurt him back.”
“How’d you find me?”  Steve asks, picking up a socket wrench from the battered toolbox sitting on the curb and bending back down to his bike.
“Well, if we’re being honest,” Jane echoes, “I should also probably tell you I already knew you were Captain America. Before tonight.” She leans into him in the way that slightly tipsy people do when they’re unsteady on their feet. “In fact, I had my picture taken with Captain America when he was in Pittsburgh for a show in ’42. I was seventeen and my girlfriend dared me to kiss you on the cheek.” She laughs and kisses her hand, then presses it to his cheek playfully.
“We’ll get him back, Tony.”  She says, and he almost tells her not to make promises that can’t be kept, but she knows the hard truths better than anybody.  She catches his gaze, staring into the bright lights of his faceplate as squarely as she would his real eyes.  “We’ll get him back.”
“Here…” Steve gets his hands on the hem of Bucky’s tee and pulls up. Bucky takes it over his head as Steve immediately goes to the buckle of Bucky’s belt, and then the button and zipper of his jeans. Bucky tries to start undressing him and return to kissing him at the same time, and the result is a uncoordinated tangle of arms and legs, noses bumping and teeth clacking as they both focus on doing too many things to be competent at any of them.
