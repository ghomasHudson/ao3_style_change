"It does indeed, and I have to say, friend, better you than me. He's got two speeds—surly and silent, or never shuts up—and  he’s deuced odd besides. Still, you won't be bored, and that's something."
It was quite infuriating, but there was something, something on the edge of his consciousness that nagged at him.
The ride, however, was not fruitful, and when they came in sight of Lestrade’s cabin they turned the horses around to ride home. John’s hands worried Arthur’s reins, and Sherlock kept his eyes trained on the road.
an evil imp said, but he crushed it down.
“Yes. Good.” Sherlock said, looking discomfited. He scrubbed his hands through his still-damp curls. “Let’s.”
"This is against the law," he tried.
“Truly awful,” John agreed dryly. “Monsters.”
Then, he heard the soft clip-clopping of horse’s hooves, and John came around the corner of the shed, leading the two horses and carrying a dark lantern. Sherlock let out the breath he’d been holding.
"Is there a scientific reason to speak to animals?" Sherlock asked seriously. “Do they mind you better? Do they gain flesh more quickly?"
“Finally, a little justice,” Sherlock muttered.
“Uncomfortable! That’s all? Is this what you mean to do all summer? Endanger my animals—the animals that I distinctly remember requesting you to
“I must.” John said. “Where she goes, I go.”
“Cats aren’t friends.” Greg said, turning away.
I’ve said Sally was a Home girl—a British orphan shipped to Canada for a better chance at a “healthy, moral life”, but Home children didn’t actually start arriving in Canada until 1869: https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/immigration/immigration-records/home-children-1869-1930/Pages/home-children.aspx
“Again?”
“That’s fine,” he said, clearing his throat and stepping back. “I would have helped anyone. I’ll be clearing up by the far north field,” he added, and fled, leaving Sherlock standing bewildered and aroused in the middle of the cabin.
Sherlock cut his eyes at John. John kept his face perfectly straight.
Holmes levelled a gaze at him that made John feel no less agitated.
The lonesome little house in the hollow was full the day of Douglas Watson’s funeral. People that had never spoken to him in life came in and looked upon his dead face with a freedom and insolent curiosity, and John Watson hated them all. Even more, he hated his mother’s family, the Lestrades, arrayed beside him in their sober funeral dress. They had disapproved of his father, disowned his mother, and were strangers to him, and he wished, as he shook hand after hand, for them to remain so. Uncle Phillip said afterwards that he had never seen a child so absolutely devoid of all natural feeling
"This is a fascinating example of a sulphur polyphore, John."
I think that’s it! Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos.
John, when he noticed the sun was high in the sky, felt rather calm than otherwise. Hoeing potatoes morning was repetitive and oddly soothing, and having the house in view had allayed some of his fears regarding recent events. He sighed, and, propping his hoe up against the shanty, went in to lunch.
“No great loss. Besides, Mycroft’s already sent an undersecretary to purchase new ones.”
John obliged, pulling gently at handfuls all over his head, until Sherlock fairly purred.
“Love is very unscientific,” he muttered.
“Fine,” Sherlock didn’t blink. “But if I win, I don’t touch a snow shovel again.”
“Are we not compatible?” They both knew the answer, but sometimes it was better to ask questions one knew the answer to.
“Them, it.” Sherlock waved one hand at the sky. Each long finger was stained red with strawberry juice.
“Both losers.” he said. “That means I owe you six minutes, correct?”
I think that’s it! Let me know if you have any questions or comments, or if you see any typos. Come and visit me on tumblr, where I’m redscudery, or Twitter, where I go by @scudery. Thanks for reading!
“You think it’s aimed at the two of us.”
“Indeed,” John muttered, darting a glance around the shop. Sherlock was presently invisible but a loud clanking from the corner where Angelo kept his stock of tools signaled his whereabouts.
“What are you planting?” Sherlock seized another piece of paper and readied his pen.
“Ugh.” John said, looking away. “What now?”
Home. Sherlock had called his cabin home. A warm flush suffused John’s insides; he didn’t dare look at Sherlock, but instead mounted Arthur, directing him towards the cabin.
“The cravats cover the worst of the damage.”
“In case you hadn’t noticed, John, it is raining outdoors.” Sherlock’s snide tone grated over John’s strained nerves.
“There’s tea, Sherlock, sit up.”
“That sounds monstrously dull,” John smiled, “as though you are trying to convince yourself and me.”
“A little,” Douglas acknowledged. “There is more to some of them than you might think. Persist, John, and see what is good in them, though you may have to fight to get what you want.”
“Use both hands, Sarah, it won’t bloody bite you,” she said. Sarah, who was slender with shining red hair, made a rude gesture in her direction and continued kneading expertly with one hand.
“My truck or yours?”
“I don’t believe in gut feelings, or intuition. Only facts. And it is a terrible mistake to theorize without the facts.”
The light gave the story away; John was once again furious at himself for missing the signs on their long trek home. He bit his lip when he saw the fire, laid in a haphazard fashion. He struck a match; it caught immediately, the flames licking at the small dry branches Sherlock had piled over the tinder.
“Good night, Sherlock,” he said, softly.
“Yes,” Sherlock muttered, and went, not standing on ceremony.
John looked at him, nonplussed.
Sherlock smiled, then, and John knew he had said the right thing.
Same-sex pair bonds were not unknown to him. There was historical precedence; seventeenth-century pirates, in fact, had had a system called matelotage, in which pirates became partners in plunder and in bed. Closer to home, Sherlock had known boys at school that way, though their system had been much more secretive and dangerous. He recalled a house master finding two boys together in the baths, and the whipping they had received.
After a long moment, John broke the kiss.
The theme song is “Someone New” by Hozier. Did you spot the reference to the lyrics?
"I'm hungry, so I'm going to cook. You're supposed to be under my care, so you'll be served food whether you eat it or no."
he wondered, and flipped open his notebook to record some of the symptoms of his condition:
Letting Sherlock’s speech run under the surface of his consciousness, John reached out the hand with Idiot Horse’s reins towards Sherlock as slowly as possible. If only he noticed—there! He was extending one finger towards John, still talking about saponin and temperature. John reached out a little farther, and farther still. Almost…
“Sherlock,” he said, as he approached the bed. Sherlock did not respond. John lifted the blankets and took a deep breath; it was worse than he had thought. Sherlock was unresponsive. He should have hurried, he thought, mentally chastising himself. He shoved the image of Sherlock nude--long, pale back and surprisingly full bottom shining in the firelight—to the back of his mind. It was time to save a life. The bedframe creaked as he slid between the covers.
“And yours were what?”
“You’ll spoil them.”
Herding in the geese, he fed them, then collected the goats—putting them in separate pens for now—and let the horses and oxen in, giving the latter an extra handful of grain. No sign of Sherlock, but the curl of white smoke from the chimney of the cabin told him that dinner was on.
“So it’s a woman.”
Mentally, he added a line to his last entry in the old account book: “Uncle Gregory was someone much nicer before, because now he is ARBITRARY, VIOLENT, and UNFAIR.”
“Don’t go into the woods after dark,” was all he said, more curtly than he intended.
“I’m taking the horses up there, Sherlock,” John said, pointing even though he knew Sherlock was paying no attention at all.
a crank--in Shrewsbury, and your Great-Aunt Janine at Priest Pond.
Sherlock's horrified face was John's reward.
“Hired man, yes. Useless specimen. Can’t tell waterliles from skunk cabbage.”
“You didn’t like the way the army treated the whores.” It was as clear to Sherlock as if John had said it.
“Lyons,” Barrymore nodded. He and Lyons were close neighbours, and John realized he had no idea how those two interacted. He’d never needed to know before, he supposed.
Sherlock nodded, nearly meekly, and stayed sagely on the settle with his papers for the rest of the afternoon. He rose carefully to make a simple supper of fried salt pork and potatoes (no roughage, he noticed, and made a mental note to see if he could add some kind of green food to their diet), which John ate with appetite. Their evening was much the same as the preceding one, though John retired earlier, insisting on taking the loft bed so that Sherlock didn’t have to climb.
“That I’m not a sexually demanding drama queen. And that the Tim Horton’s cups are rigged.”
John did not, could not move. Sherlock made a small, displeased noise and pulled him close. John struggled to get away: Sherlock’s arm was just below his navel, and his face was tucked into John’s ribs. Black curls tickled his left nipple.
Who had destroyed John’s peace of mind? Sherlock’s vast brain worried at that problem like a rat at a biscuit. And yet, as he thought of their excursions and their evenings by the fire--the way John made sure he ate and slept and behaved like a person, the way Sherlock pushed John to the edge of his intellectual capacity--he felt perhaps that they were already a pair.
John is angry. Guglielmo can see it in his face. He opens his mouth to deduce John, to make him angrier. He stops, though. Can't say why. But his cheeks are hot. John is charmed by this submission.
This reluctance had nothing to do with making John grouchy while holding an axe. It was due to Sherlock realizing that while he had always been interested in anatomy, he had never truly realized the pull of the subject when observations could be made on a living person. The flex of John’s back muscles was utterly fascinating, pinkening Sherlock’s face in a way that had nothing to do with the sun. He forced himself to focus on only the scientific nature of the muscles, rather than the fact they were attached to John Watson; any dwelling on that fact resulted in an uncomfortable consciousness that his drawers were too tight.
"Yes. What do you know?"
Relief brought more tears, and several overflowed. He shook himself. He would not fail now. He would light a fire, and he would get warm. John would get warm. John needed him to light a fire, too. He fixed the candle on to the bench—crude, but couldn’t be helped, and went to the box beside the hearth. Pulling out crumpled handfuls of birchbark and sticks of kindling, he laid them on the old ashes. It wouldn’t be an elegant fire—Sherlock did love laying elegant fires—but it would be warm. He went for the candle.
And yet he would never go back, not beyond occasionally helping Stamford, the local doctor--that was a line he could not cross. So he farmed, and he spent his evenings with a bottle of whiskey and the fire, hoping he would sleep without dreams. It was a life, though a hard and uncertain one.
Well, I'm updating this again. I'm kind of excited about this fusion; it's one of my favourite L.M. Montgomery books and I think there are some real possibilities. It'll be short and sweet (ten chapters I swear).
"No fire, no supper," he tried.
John’s heart lurched.
Sherlock would have to be well-prepared, but the beaver grease would do for that, and John could be patient. A slow, consistent opening, that would be key. At this thought, his cock stirred; he himself was not averse to such a thing—a flash of one sultry Indian night crossed his mind, a tangle of limbs, slick oil on long fingers. He shivered, then squared his jaw and damped the buzz of desire in his mind. Prostate stimulation could be a sexual act, but its medical application was quite different; he felt on surer ground here than he had for pelvic massage. Draining the gland really would alleviate some congestion, though not as completely as the sexual act, and Sherlock should feel some improvement.
That first Saturday and Sunday at New Moon always stood out in John's memory as a very wonderful time, so crowded was it with new and generally delightful impressions.  There was a certain charm about the old house which John felt keenly and responded to, and he loved the beautiful land around him. So, in spite of the ache for his father and the house in the hollow which persisted all the time, he was beginning to be a little glad again in sunset and bird song and early white stars, in moonlit nights and singing winds.  He knew life was going to be wonderful here--wonderful and interesting, what with out-door cook- houses and cream-girdled dairies and pond paths and sundials, and Disappointed Houses and men who didn't believe in God, ANY God.
“John.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, lost.
“Oh, so you can dictate my behaviour now?”
He didn’t. He consciously relaxed his muscles and let the horrible scent fill his nostrils. He would be more than his instinct. He would.
"Wait," John interrupted. "What exactly does that mean you are doing with my geese? I ask because geese are expensive, and I don't want you endangering their lives."
He ignored any further rustling in favour of drinking in the view. The old pasture ran before her in a succession of little green hills right down to the famous Blair Water--an almost perfectly round pond, with grassy, sloping, treeless margins.  Beyond it was the Blair Water valley, filled with homesteads, and further out the great sweep of the white-
“Of course, Cyrus,” Mrs. Hudson said, and vanished into the house. When she emerged a moment later, bearing an entire pie, her face made John shiver. He was willing to bet that nobody in their right mind would want to eat that pie. Mrs. Dimmock, when Mrs. Hudson gave it to her, handled it with an uncharacteristic delicacy. Cyrus Dimmock was supremely unconcerned.
"I'm not taking chances"
“So smug.”
“That’s ridiculous,” John said. “It’s likely coincidence. Someone’s tramping through, that’s certain. The bear is more worrisome.”
"I want to touch your cock with my hand," Sherlock growled, and did so.
He felt as he had the morning after his nocturnal emission, only magnified twofold. He nearly laughed with the sheer pleasure of inhabiting his body, but he did not want to wake John, who was still in a deep, twitching sleep.
John has a dangerous mystery, a moribund squirrel, and a neglected potato patch on his hands. What he doesn’t need is an argumentative, insubordinate Sherlock as well...but that’s what he’s got.
Greg nodded thoughtfully. “Mostly spruce, but I hope it’ll last. I’ve got larch for the roof.”
Then, he settled into a regular rhythm, firm at the base and light over the tip, his hips rocking slightly for extra friction. His breathing was already harsher, and his pulse pounded in his ears; his cock stood straight out from his body, glistening with grease.
“Can I get you another?” Someone jostled against him, his Australian accent drawing John’s attention. He turned to see a husky blond man in his thirties smiling at him.
“What woman would do this?”
And yet… He rose, and went to his trunk. Opening it quietly, he drew out his diary. The pages of the service-issue notebook were slightly yellow, the ink faded; he handled even the cover carefully so the ill-kept leather would not crack. His pen was equally neglected, but he set it right with a quick polish and dipped his pen in Sherlock’s inkpot. The pen felt strange in his hand, but another glance at Sherlock—this time, his hands, curled around a glass—made him think of that first night, and the afternoon that preceded it.  He held his pen with more certainty, and began.
Inwardly, John groaned. Outwardly, he shifted in his chair.
“We can’t very well ride about the district asking to look at our female neighbours’ boots, especially at this hour.”
“Stamford,” Sherlock said, not unpleasantly.
"Nobody ships me anywhere," Sherlock grumbled, but a look flashed across his face that made John feel more reassured than anything he'd seen so far.
“Not so fast, Sherlock.” John broke the grip and sat back up. “There are some things to take care of first.”
“You have substantially improved my mood.”
Well, perhaps, he thought, remembering the long sweep of Sherlock’s pale, cold body. A feeling of dread unrelated to marauding bears, and entirely related to his visit to Mrs. Hudson’s descended upon him. Her prescience in the face of any kind of romantic or sexual entanglement was frankly unnerving. He steeled himself as he pulled into her yard.
"You don't want me to see you?"
“All right there, Sherlock?”
Come and visit me on tumblr, where I’m redscudery, or Twitter, where I go by @scudery. Thanks for reading!
“Mrs. Hudson likes to get out, and Frank does too—or so she says. I’ll take Isadora to Byron…”
trace every feature. Soon. Despite the danger, despite the uncertainty of their position, he would be able to touch every part of Sherlock that he wanted to touch.
John didn’t pull back. He didn’t move forward either. Sherlock’s lips were soft and his mouth tasted of cream sauce and desire. The slide of his bottom lip was as delicious as John had always known it would be.
"If I tell you what I want I'll spend where I stand."
“Not for a moment,” John replied, and he had to laugh. Certainly they must have looked—did look, for that matter—ridiculous, the pair of them; he didn’t blame Idiot Horse for enjoying the show. Sherlock’s hair was quite on end, and the relative pristineness of his shirt had been irretrievably compromised. What John could see of his own self was similarly disastrous; he could feel an unpleasant trickle down his back that promised the rest of him was just as bad.
"You will find, Dr. Watson, that the sheriff is willing to oblige me as well."
“It might. Now, help me. Who’s the weakest link?”
The sun was actually visible in the sky when the lake came into view. The horses picked up the pace when they smelled the water, and Sherlock’s nose twitched, assessing. John kicked Arthur into a trot, and Arthur, always ready to distance himself from Sherlock, was happy to oblige. They whisked away, leaving Sherlock and Idiot Horse ambling through the little poplars on the hill, and were down at the beach in a flash. John dismounted on the pebbly shore and led Arthur to the clear water, almost inviting even on the cool May day. Arthur stuck his face in and drank. The shadow of a cloud scudded over John’s face as he began to unload the gear, and he looked up to the west to see whether the rain clouds were coming back. Though the sky wasn’t clear, it didn’t seem likely. Good news, he mused, thinking of his wet fields.
“W- What’s the matter John?”
There is a silence. Sherlock yawns and looks at his watch. I am starting to get angry now and I hate myself for it. I should know not to get angry, he can't help it, he's just scared but Christ he is infuriating.
I practically stab the key into the door before stomping up the stairs. I've probably woken up Mrs Hudson but I couldn't frankly give less of a shit. It's when I reach the door to my flat that I hear it. Quiet at first but then it gets louder. The violin.
Shit. Sherlock has tried to… I don’t even want to think about it. I have to admit I thought about it, after he left, and there were times when I nearly did. And it’s not like I don’t have scars of my own, I know what he is going through, I need to talk to him, let him know that it is ok. I run down the stairs, intending to catch him, and burst into the loud main room of the club. I look around desperately but he is gone, swallowed by the wild crowd…
There were so many scars, layered one on top of another. I would say it's been a long time that he's been...
Anthony and Sherlock talk for a bit more, exchanging casual conversation, but I am engulfed in my thoughts. Thoughts of the man next to me. Wishful thinking, wishing that the situation we are in will last forever, Sherlock idly twisting my fingers in his own, unaware of my longing for more. I want more...
I shake my head in disbelief before nodding curtly. Sherlock leads me round the side of the crowded dance room and through a back door. We walk up some rickety stairs, and come to face a bright orange door. Sherlock looks at me and knocks 3 times.
and rush out the door, turning back only once, to see her standing by the window, giving her self a small, knowing smile.
"Sher-"
Sherlock smiles, clearly amused by my outrage, the annoying sod.
It is only after I stand up again, hands shaking and eyes red that I see Sherlock, receded into the shadows. His face looks like a sheet, and his eyes are a deer in the headlights. He turns and he runs.
I can't quite get the words out, I don't know what to say, so I sigh and go and sit down, head in my hands.
This appears to amuse her for some reason, and she looks at her two friends – a tall and skinny awkward looking boy in a dashing bright purple suit and a short stocky girl wearing a blue polka dot dress. They look like something from an old film. They grin back at her.
His voice finally gives him away. It is not a sharp scolding tone but one of pleading, one of fear, one of loneliness and so much more and it breaks my fucking heart.
My heart drops to the pit of my stomach. I have never seen him like this. So vulnerable, and just plain sad. I have caused this. What the hell was I thinking? Guilt washes over me and I feel like sobbing my eyes out.
We sit in silence for a long time, him staring out the window. I am used to long stretches of silence with Sherlock but this is different. It has never been awkward before, not like this. I study him, his perfectly chiselled face which is whiter than normal. My eyes follow down the neck to his porcelain chest. I can see his rib cage, more prominent than ever now. I frown - he hasn't been eating. I wouldn't be surprised if he hasn't eaten all week. This doesn't seem the right time to bring it up though so I stay quiet.
We never spoke of it again.
"John?" his voice is low but there is a warmth to it.
“Yeah?” she says brashly.
"John I have no idea what you're talking about," he says, smooth as anything.
John and Sherlock get into a bit of a domestic. (World's biggest understatement)
“Hello?”
"John?"
A strange case leads to a knew found intimacy and John finding out a dark secret of his ex-flatmate.
"Sherlock," I say, trying to sound calm and composed. "I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have acted like that. I need you to know that I'm not angry with you."
I feel Sherlock’s breath on my face momentarily, before I am dragged off between purple curtains, into a buzzing room. The bar is on the far side, and is crowded with people, each one shining with a sheen of sweat, illuminated and glistening in the flashing lights. However, it appears that if anyone wants to get through to the bar, they will have to shove through hundreds of bodies, all dancing together to the infectious beat blaring out of the huge speakers that loom over the flashing dance floor. I glance at Sherlock before deciding to take hold of his arm and lead him off to a more quiet room.
"Fine, sorry"
"For god's sake! What's wrong with you? You're such an emotionless..." I search for a word, my eyes darting, head sweating in anger.
I sit, stunned for a while, before giving Tackle a curt but awkward nod and scurry out the door.
We talk for a while, meaningless words, utterly useless conversation – until Ella changes her stance and I can tell that we are about to get into the serious stuff. The whole atmosphere of the room changes; shifts to somber and stern. She leans forward in her chair, smiling slightly.
He hasn't come out of his room for days as far as I know. I've been calling in sick to work and going over there everyday, relentlessly knocking on his door, telling him we need to talk, that I'm there for him if he needs me. The silence on the other side suggests he doesn't but I stay all the same, sometimes for hours on end.
"Are you having bad dreams again john?" I don't know why but this really irritates me. She sounds like my mother, not my wife. I sigh loudly and she comes to the door, bleary eyed.
"I should have known? Sherlock, I thought you were dead, Jesus! I thought you had..."
John this isn't funny.
I can feel the heat rising in the back of my neck.
"John."
"Oh, Sherlock..." I whisper. He swallows and juts his chin out, trying to look strong. He fails.
“Yeah we know where that is,” replies the green-haired girl. “Just go down Church Street and turn left at the bottom and you’ll be on the right road, can't miss it after that.”
"Ah, you don't want me to be dead."
Sherlock turns away and walks to the kitchen counter, facing away from me. He rests upon it for a minute and I realise I may have gone too far. All the anger leaves my body for the second time that night and I swallow heavily. What seems like years pass before finally he turns to face me. His eyes are filled with tears and for the first time in my life, I see that I have hurt him.
"How about we talk about why you're up at this ungodly hour crying on my doorstep?"
"FREAK!" I spit.
The tube comes to a stop and I stand up, pushing my way out of the door through crowds of people, darting amongst bodies as if they are obstacles in a course. My body moves slowly, shuffling through the crowds, but my mind does not. It races, the anticipation like a fluid, slowly filling my head, spreading warmth and sending shivers of excitement down my spine. I chuckle to myself in a kind of childish delight, more loudly than I intend to, and earn a few strange looks from passing strangers – but I couldn’t care less. I am on the last escalator; the light from the outside world revealing it’s self slowly. As the light builds, so does the anticipation, making my whole body buzz, my head light and giddy. The thing is - it’s not like this is unusual – this is how I feel every single time I am about to see him.
After what feels like an eternity I hear a small cough. Shit. My eyes slowly drift open and upwards to Sherlock who still isn't wearing a top and I don't know whether to wish he would put one on or not. I swallow, cursing myself for lingering on him, for even feeling like this in these circumstances. His face is ashen, and it is clear that he has been crying. A lot.
"Out!" I practically scream and slam the door, leaving my pregnant wife alone and looking bemused.
Where the hell are you?
"I'm fine, just can't sleep. Go back to bed I'll join you in a second"
I do, I do love her. I look up to my wife and give the most reassuring smile that I can, attempting to convince her that I wasn’t just daydreaming about being with my best friend romantically. Again.
I lose it. In three quick paces I am in front of him delivering a sharp slap to his face. He looks at me as if I have just murdered a puppy in front of him and for some reason this is not enough so I slap him again. We are nose to nose now and my whole body is trembling with anger.
I am really distressed now, and I need to calm myself down. I stand still for a moment, taking a few deep breaths. I go sit in my armchair but for some reason decide against it, instead eyeing up Sherlock's. He has left his dressing gown on it and it has a few half drunken cups of tea. I smile to myself, comforted by the familiarity of this sight, and make my way over there, before settling into the softness. I try to relax, to clear my head - at least one of us needs to if we ever hope to talk. I shut my eyes, breathing in the clean but soft scent of Sherlock. It is gentle and sexy and gorgeous at the same time and it instantly relaxes me. I sit like that for a long time, eyes shut, head in my hands, breathing in Sherlock.
I sigh and bring up her contact, deliberating before pressing call.
Suddenly it kicks in. Are we going to have to act as…?
"Oh god, Sherlock no, I could never be angry with you. I was... I can't... Shit this is hard, we don't talk. About each other and..."
John goes back to therapy for the first time since Sherlock came back
I give her a final grin
“Ella,” I stammer, “I… um… I have to go now.” I can see that it’s paining her that she thinks that she upset me and I am leaving never to come back. Her false face has finally shown some emotion, and for that, I finally respect her.
Villiers St,
Fuck it, I think, and grab Sherlock’s wrist in my own. This may be the only chance I get to have intimate contact with him so why not make the best of it. I pull his hand into my lap and begin to trace my fingers up the side of his thumb, reaching the top and tracing down the other side. I do this to every one of his fingers before moving down to his wrist. This seems to shock him and he tries to pull away but I keep my grip firm. I run my index finger over the top of his wrist, and begin to trace the whole way round. When I reach the pulse I notice that it is elevated and Sherlock is pulling away more forcefully now. He seems desperate to hide something. Suddenly I reach a rough patch in his wrist – a huge scar, layered over lots of smaller, more faded ones. It takes a moment to click in my brain before I realise what these scars must mean. Some are still slightly scabbed over meaning he must have recently tried to…
“John… the disappearing man case… murder… new lead… text you an address… come NOW.”
“Anthony Tackle,” says the man, and his toothless grin grows wider, stepping to the side and inviting us in. I look around me, bemused at the strange room that stands before us, almost too bemused to still be conscious of Sherlock’s hand in mine, although every time I think of it I seem to become hyper conscious of him.
“John?”
I am so sorry this is such a sad chapter - trigger warnings for self harm.
Ever since Mary and I got married, we haven’t seen each other as much – I have a life to keep up with, a married life, and to be honest, it’s hell. I love Mary; I truly do, but Sherlock…
The cold air hits me like a brick as I stumble out onto the street. It must have gotten late without me realising. I look around, slightly confused. I'm not familiar with this area so I head back to the station, hoping to get a cab outside. I wrap my arms across my chest and blow my cheeks out as my mind begins to race about Sherlock.
"Yes?" I don't know what I am anticipating - a breakdown? Anger? Crying?
We pull away from each other far to soon for my liking. He seems almost scared of me now, skittish, and he instantly opens the space between us. He walks briskly to his chair before awkwardly sitting down, crossing and uncrossing his legs over and over again. His face is still pale and he is shivering all over, I can practically hear his ribs rattling. He somehow looks simultaneously 20 years older and younger that he really is. I stay standing still, looking down at him. My arms feel empty without him in them now, and it feels wrong and I want to hug him again. Instead I cling onto the doorframe to the kitchen in a desperate attempt to stabilise myself.
I realise that I am almost shouting and I sit back, ashamed of my outburst. Nicely handled John, well done. Sherlock, however, doesn't seem affected. Cool as a cucumber he stands up. His whole stomach ripples, each muscle moving and despite the circumstances I don't think I could help myself from licking my lips if someone paid me.
I attempt to crush the hope that’s building in my stomach – because it never is the despair that hurts you, it’s nearly always the hope. I past the depressing 1960's greg flats – Sherlock is probably waiting outside some witness’s house. I peer down the street, searching for the long coat and mass of black curls. No sign of Sherlock yet. I move further down, passing houses and approaching the bar. I walk past it, and just as I am about to move on, a hand grabs my jacket and pulls me through the entrance. Sherlock.
Of course, having always identified as heterosexual, I quickly pushed these thoughts out of my head. I told myself that I was being ridiculous, that it was just the shock of seeing him again after all these years, after all of this pain. I shoved those thoughts out of my head as soon as they entered and for that I will always be eternally regretful.
"Sherlock. I know what you did and I just want you to know... I'm here. For you. If you... need it."
The next time it happened, was just before my wedding. I was stressed out beyond belief, and having so many pre-marital jitters that I was a mess. Nobody knows how much of a wreck I was before that wedding, nobody except for Sherlock. He was there, the best man, helping me get ready for the wedding. I was having trouble fastening my tie; I had somehow completely forgotten how to perform this simple task. Sherlock had gone to the loo, and as he walked in I burst into tears. Now I am not an emotional person, even in the worst of times, so you can imagine Sherlock’s confusion when I started to sob. He stood there for a while, simply staring, open mouthed, before rushing to me to help.
When Sherlock died - or didn't I suppose I couldn't deal with the pain. It was like nothing I had ever felt before, every bash and scrape and gunshot I had ever seen or felt replayed and amplified in my head.
"John, I have been known to ignore people for long periods of time. You should have known..." he is a little quieter now, more unsure of himself.
. . .
In the end, I opt for the far more secretive – “Fine.”
. . .
“It’s ok. I’m not leaving because… It’s Sherlock. He needs me. Now.”
An ugly mix of a sob and a hiccup comes out of my mouth and I dissolve into crying again. Sherlock just stares at me and says nothing.
The first time I felt sure that I had feelings for my ridiculous ex-flat mate was when I realized that he and Jeanine were dating. I had come over, just to say hi; perhaps it was to work on a case? I can’t remember. Anyway, when Jeanine had opened that door, a load of emotions had come crashing down upon me, tearing me down with them. Confusion, anger, regret, jealously. God I was jealous. And, later on, I had seen Sherlock kiss someone for the first time, finally seen him showing an ounce of romance – well, more than an ounce – and it had killed me. I didn’t want the first romantic scenario I had seen Sherlock in to be with someone else!
“Now,” she says, “Let’s talk about Sherlock Holmes.”
11, The Arches,
He looks down in defeat. He clearly doesn't want to say anything so I go on.
“John,” she begins, leaning forward in her chair and clasping her hands together on either side of a pen. Her voice is calm, false, and plastic. All of this is hard, cold, plastic. “How are you doing?”
John!
Thanks for reading - please leave a comment constructive crit is very welcome (:
I look up at him, shocked, and he stares back before pulling his hand away incredibly quickly, moving his sleeve down, as if he can undo what I have seen – or, rather, felt. He stands up abruptly and this shocks the small man sitting across from us. He frowns as Sherlock’s chair clatters against the wooden floorboards, and he stands to. The two men look at each other briefly before Sherlock turns his head away and then his body. With a dramatic sweep of his coat he runs out the door.
Looking back, I don’t know what the hell I had expected – I was married, I loved Mary, I did, but…
There is a moment before we hear shuffling footsteps approaching the door, and it begins to open. Suddenly Sherlock grabs my hand, lacing our fingers together. I turn my head sharply towards him, which he clearly reads as outrage and he gives me an apologetic look and shrugs. For a moment I am lost in the sensations of our intertwined fingers, savouring every moment of contact possible, and I do not even notice the odd looking man that stands in the door way before us. He gives an obvious cough and I look at him. The man is short, very short; much smaller than me in fact. He must be 60 and has tufts of bright orange hair sticking out from the few patches on his head that are not bald. He gives a wide smile, and I note that he is missing 5 or 6 teeth, giving him a goofy look. He holds his hand out, which is laden with heavy rings, decorated with all sorts of brightly coloured charms.
"Sherlock I... you need to..."
(See the end of the chapter for
"John? You alright?"
“John, I am so sorry, I truly didn’t mean to imply that-“
I snap my head up, taken aback by the politeness, the formality, the un-sherlockness of his tone. I have composed myself now, and am standing awkwardly by the window, unsure of what to do with myself. I want to scream at him, cry, hit the wall, hit his perfect face and his perfect body for being so normal. I don't. I just shake my head.
Hope you enjoyed (:
He placed his hand on my back and stroked it comfortingly but I continued to weep, so Sherlock pulled me in for a hug, something that I had never experienced before from him. We sat like that for a while, until all of my tears were gone, and I stood up, wiped my eyes and walked out.
"For Christ's sake come here." I hold my arms out for him to come.
Not that. He is facing me now and I have crossed the room before even thinking. I wrap him tight into my arms and he collapses his weight onto mine once again and right now I don't care if it means more to me than him and I don't care that this is the man that I am utterly in love with. All I know at this moment, all that matters, is that we are standing at the window, just holding each other.
"Hi, how are y-"
“Do you know where The Arches, Villiers Street is?” I ask.
"Would you like to sit down?"
And then there is Mary. She is comfort; she is warmth, and security. Fondness. But not love; not pure desire and electricity that rips through your body every time you are in the same room as them. She knows me, and I know her, and we are supposed to be together. But she is not him. She is not Sherlock.
I am still in slight shock about the events of last week as I stir the tea quietly, so as not to wake Mary. I haven't told her about anything that has happened - I'm not quite sure why but I do know that I now feel more distant from her than ever.
I take a deep breath, I can't lose my temper, not now.
"Sherlock, you know what I'm talking about-"
His voice is like Ella's, plastic and fake. I look around and somehow it doesn't feel right to sit in my chair so I sink into the hard wood of the client chair. Sherlock flinches - I can tell he's noticed, obviously he's noticed. He thinks I don't see the flinch but I do, he's not the only perceptive one around here. He is nervous, I know because he is biting his cheek like a child waiting in the head masters office, but other than that his face is calm, eyes relaxed.
WC2N 6NG
That was he first time it happened, well, it was when Sherlock came back. I was angry at first, so angry, fire coursing through my veins. But as I lay in bed that night, next to the woman I loved, I thought of why I was angry. There was the pain. There was the loss, the emotional turmoil, but, mostly, there was regret. There was disappointment in knowing what could have been, what should have been. If I had known, if he had given me one word, perhaps it would be different. I had glanced over at Mary, and I remember wondering if I would still be with her at all had Sherlock not faked his death. I was wondering if maybe, just maybe, I would be with Sherlock instead.
I swallow, not even wanting to think about what Sherlock was attempting. Absent mindedly I trace the bumps on my hip through the thin material of my shirt which I had created not too long ago myself.
“John?”
"I said I'm fine! For gods sake why can't you just hear what I'm saying and that's enough!"
I laugh awkwardly "I don't know, feelings and that... stuff, but I... I was just terrified Sherlock, I was so, so scared - I thought you were gone, and..."
5 DAYS LATER
"This is abnormal John, we don't hug."
When I touch Sherlock, even by accident, electricity jolts through my body, and I can’t breath, and it’s the most natural feeling in the world and yet the most unique, and alien at the same time. When I see Sherlock my heart physically changes pace, my eyes light up, my breath quickens. When he talks, I hang on to every word, trying to familiarise myself with the gentle yet beautiful lull of his tone, but I never will. He will always amaze me; I could never be bored around Sherlock Holmes.
Seeing the usually calm and collected woman flustered is slightly amusing, and I’m sure I should be enjoying the moment more but I am probably more worried myself. She knows. She knows how I feel. About him.
"Come on Sherlock, let's talk about this."
"What?" I practically spit.
"Would it be alright if we exchanged... a hug again?"
When I reach the bottom of Church Street I turn left as instructed. There is only one establishment that is clearly open to the public, and it is brightly lit in neon purple. For some reason I instinctively think of the young lad in the purple suit – it’s funny how the brain makes connections. It appears to be some kind of nightclub, and as I get closer I see it’s a gay bar. My heart leaps and I roll my eyes at myself. For god’s sake of course he’s not taking you to a gay bar - that could imply…
Sherlock sits still on his chair, and for once, I can't read him at all. He looks like a perfect statue, one that could shatter at any moment. He suddenly stands up, startling me, and walks to the far window, facing it.
"Yes?" He is clearly trying to sound composed but his voice wobbles and he ends up sounding like an eight year old crying.
This gets my attention and I laugh for a moment, before meeting his eyes which are dead serious. My face falls. Does he not know I care about him? Am I that horrible, that terrible that he thinks I don't care?
Afterwards, John had crawled into bed once more, pulled Sherlock against his chest and made sure he was alright, knowing the first sexual experience with a partner could be quite intense. Sherlock had mumbled an affirmation, shyly hiding his face in the crook of John’s neck and pressing his lips against the warm skin, breathing him in. In truth, Sherlock
“Beauxbatons has plenty of small ponds that freeze over during winter. When my father still lived with us, I usually stayed over the winter in the academy. Taught myself to skate. It’s not hard. Just some simple mathematical equations and physics. I can teach you if you like”.
“He fainted smelling Amortentia? That’s rather uncommon...How close was he?”
Suddenly realising how long the hug had been going on and wondering if it was still in the socially acceptable range Sherlock loosened his hold on John. He started to let go, and the blonde followed his lead, apparently unaware of Sherlock’s sudden unease and nerves.
“JOHN! Zonkos! It’s no Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes but I’ve heard it’s quite brilliant! Come ON!” he was pulling John now, dragging was a more apt description. John followed promptly, grinning as Sherlock basically ripped off his arm in the process of taking them there as fast as humanly possible.
The smaller boy sighed heavily and called back “I was just exploring, mummy”
John was flipping through the large drawing pages, mouth gaping in awe. “Sherlock… Every time I think you could get more talented and amazing… these are so wonderful” he looked up at him “It’s like…  I’m watching who I am. Who I am inside when I see your drawings, your paintings.” he said, remembering the many times he had felt that, and the times he had known when Sherlock was looking at him he was looking at everything he was, the good and the bad.
be psychosomatic".
“Absolutely John. They're just potion ingredients… Oh no, not that one! Maybe.. maybe just this one. And this one. And.. I'm sure a
He stood. Now was the time to survey the way his students were getting along with their drawings. John watched him walk around the room, not moving a single muscle but his eyes and Sherlock smirked, clearly he was expecting Sherlock to say something about the talented students he had before him but Sherlock decided to instead say,
Soon enough the bus stopped and John walked out into the streets and onto his apartment building. An army pension and his salary for modelling were not conducive to a grand amount of money so at least for now he could not afford a proper apartment that was more than basically a bedroom with a tiny kitchen and an equally minuscule bathroom.
John chuckled, tightening his hand around his friend’s waist. His friend? Is that what he should call him now? Even calling him that was rather strange since just a few days ago he had even doubted whether they were friends at all… but then again they hadn’t had the long talk they had yesterday. Now things were definitely different. And not just because now they kissed, and GOD did they kiss. It was different because Sherlock now looked at him without any walls. Without
It was a relief, however, walking into the warmth of the castle entrance and they both sighed in pleasure. John turned to Sherlock as the latter was pulling off his light blue robes, darkened with the cold rain and dripping steadily onto the marble floor. Hitherto, John hadn’t seen the Beauxbatons uniform without the outer robe. Now he could see Sherlock was wearing tight blue pants and a matching dress shirt. Over the dress shirt, he was wearing a tight vest of a slightly darker colour engraved with the Beauxbatons symbol and a dark tie. The water had soaked through the material of the robes and onto his shirt and vest and they both clung skin tight to Sherlock’s chest, accentuating his abdomen and collarbones. John could stop staring at those. Not to mention the few raindrops that were rolling down Sherlock’s pale neck and onto the hollow of his throat.
John’s soft expression disappeared and he looked thoroughly annoyed “I’M THE CAPTAIN AND I’LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE GREG!” He answered just as loudly.
John nodded, encouragingly. He didn’t want to interrupt Sherlock. Clearly, this was taking a lot of effort for him to finally say.
through Sherlock’s head and as John disappeared beneath the black panels of the changing screen he scribbled down some notes on his first impression. He rarely got this much information from a single look.
(See the end of the chapter for
“We..” John started, grinning shyly and looking down at their joined hands in the center of the table. “We’re… together right? Like… Boyfriends?”
And the entirety of the one after that.
John was sitting on the closest bench to the door softly smiling to himself, and putting on his boots with his right hand and holding his broom up with his left. His firebolt, Sherlock mentally noted, was in perfect conditions. Showing how much John loved it and cared for it. Sherlock knew John’s family didn’t have much money, which was why he had second hand school and Quidditch robes. He remembered seeing John dreamily lust over the model outside the broom shop at Hogsmeade and as soon as John had retreated to his dormitory that night Sherlock had snuck out of school and went to buy it for his next birthday.
He lowered himself onto the bed, pulling John on top of himself until they were pressed skin to skin, still immersed in their kisses. Sherlock moaned freely when John’s lips slowly roamed down to his neck and chest and finally attached themselves onto one of his peaked dusty pink nipples. He tangled his fingers in the golden strands of John’s hair and pulled teasingly, as John nibbled gently on the pebbled pink skin. “John” he breathed.
“Well class today we’re going to observe the effects of a very common but highly potent potion. can anyone tell me what potion created powerful effects on infatuation or obsession on the drinker?”
Sherlock just smiled, chubby cheeks glowing a rosy pink.
They had fallen asleep in each others arms after a quiet night in just after finishing off a case. At the crack of dawn, however, John had woken up abruptly from a nightmare to find the other side of the bed empty and cold. That wasn’t really that unusual considering Sherlock was quite fond of painting at dawn, even more s since he had been offered the gallery space for his first solo-exhibit. But that night, John had suddenly craved the warmth by his side in the remaining veiling of his nightmare.
Sherlock kept his eyes steadily fixed on the ground as to avoid looking directly at John. When he had offered to teach John to skate he really hadn’t thought it all the way through. Now he could feel John’s body heat through his gloves. He could feel his breaths drifting towards him as the misty words they exchanged intermingled in the air between them. Sherlock could feel John’s eyes on his face, but he just couldn’t look back at him. He couldn’t do it without giving it away. Without accidentally showing John that he was pretty sure he had fallen completely head over heels in love with him.
“Sorry sorry…. This isn’t working.” He stopped and looked at their hands, pressed back to back by the vine. Sherlock knew he’d be able to get rid of the devil snare with a simple light enchantment, but Filch was coming and although he suspected there was someone in here, that was no reason to give him a confirmation. They’d be followed. “We need to figure out something. It’s going to crush our hands if we keep going” Sherlock muttered.
Class ended faster than Sherlock had ever thought possible. The students had all clearly taken a liking to John, as when Sherlock had returned from the break most of the students had been back into the formed huddle surrounding the platform and John had been grinning happily at them
Before he could even get a single word out, however, Sherlock shifted his eyes towards him quickly and said “It’s not Irene, John. I’m not dating Irene”
“Molly” Molly turned around, a little nervous, “This is a pretty good start. Keep going.” Molly only smiled and nodded, knowing Sherlock was not expecting a thank you but a continuation of effort and work.
How presumptuous of him to just invite himself to Sherlock’s class as the model. Remembering the shocked look Sherlock had given him as John had said those words just brought a whole new wave of shame through his body.
Finally, the day of the Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor came and John was not even thinking about the game as he went down for breakfast as instead of seeing Sherlock sitting with an open book on his usual spot at the Gryffindor table next to where John usually sat, (He’d refused to sit with the Ravenclaws because they were “Obviously wrongly sorted John! None of those idiots have a superior level of intelligence. Just yesterday I saw Janine take two whole minutes to solve the riddle, John! TWO minutes!” he looked positively astonished) he saw empty space.
“Do you know you do that out loud?” Sherlock asked curiously
“Off of high street. It’s some place nice. Trust me”
“You alright, Sherlock?” John asked uncertainly.
After short fumbling hands on belt buckles and zippers, they finally managed to get each other naked.
“OhmyGodjustgo” Sherlock rushed out, already feeling his face flaming in embarrassment at being caught out making out with the model by most of his students. Said model was giggling in the background, covering his face in equal embarrassment.
John dropped his glass. It shattered against the hardwood floors with a thundering crash, splinters of glass exploding in all directions but no one flinched. No one even took notice.
Once the time was up (Sherlock had counted the minutes in his head), he nodded at John and released the pose, much to the relief of his cramped arm muscles and back. He stretched for a moment, releasing the tension.
he was the only one. And what could be better than that? He resigned to keep himself collected for now. Too ‘woo’ John, per say... into being his.
year Hufflepuff student. “Beauxbatons and Gryffindor are tied! And it looks like Holmes and Astley have spotted the snitch! They’re in pursuit, Beauxbaton’s Holmes on the lead Gryffindor’s Astley not far behind.”
John tried his best to hide his smirk.
John cleared his throat “Uh… Mycroft Holmes? Sherlock’s brother?” he stepped forward from beside Sherlock’s tense form, not letting go of his hand but stretching out his other in greeting. “John Watson”
He leafed through his drawings from last night. Some he remembered drawing. Most… he didn’t. The majority of them were detailed renderings of parts of John’s body whilst only a few showed him in full view. Even with the colossal amount of drawings he had already made, instantly Sherlock felt the itch to make more. The thought surprised him. Even when he had interesting subjects the most he ever did was dedicate them a few drawings, a painting even, if they were lucky. But once an idea was through he never revisited a subject. The only time that had ever happened was with his mother, but sentiment was a clear factor in that; why should he want to draw… better not think about it. He felt oddly calm. The buzzing that was constantly in his head dulled to a soothed buzz after drawing last night.
John didn’t look convinced at his dismissal. His eyebrows scrunched together in worry and the artist leaned forward and kissed his brow gently. His eyes still stung from unshed tears. The memory of that woman flirting with John was painstakingly vivid in his mind. Her fingers curling around her long red hair and the model’s laughter directed solely at her. The artist’s lower lip gave a tiny sad wobble he hoped the blonde couldn’t perceive in the darkening light. The memory of the sunset they’d watched together stabbed at Sherlock’s insides, and he wished with all his heart that he was still there.
The Beauxbatons offered another tentative smile, not quite knowing how to react.
John mentally struck himself
“No! Sherlock wait!” John hissed. “Aren’t mandrakes pretty much deadly? We don’t have earmuffs!”
John snapped his head towards the door, a deep shade of scarlet.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What just happened?” asked Molly, perplexed and staring after Sherlock.
John stared at her, his heart still beating painfully against his ribs and his fists clenching. “What?”
Holmes’s Estate, First Floor, Kitchen
“I thought you regretted our kiss the other day” he sighed sadly
But John just remained by his side, talking about his potions essay and moaning about not being able to go out to practice if he wanted to finish it tonight.
to be in?” Greg smiled, sensing John’s discomfort.
“Oh uhh.. yeah! I.. was thinking about getting one this summer” John quickly responded, ignoring the blush quickly rising from his neck to his cheeks and thanking Merlin that Molly had not spotted him spying on Sherlock and Irene. People would talk. And the last thing he needed was Sherlock hearing about his friend spying on him.
He didn’t finish his sentence. Just that second, Sherlock took all the courage he had and closed the breath of distance between them, his eyes slipping closed instinctively as he felt his lips collide gently with John’s. For a millisecond John stilled in surprise, but then without hesitation, he wrapped the arm around Sherlock’s hip tightly around his waist and pushed his other hand into Sherlock’s curls.
“Right. I didn’t. Umm. Yeah. That’s perfectly understandable. I don’t know what I was- uh.” Sherlock spluttered out, mentally berating himself and blushing to the very top of his ears embarrassedly.
But just as John was building himself up to say something, anything really, Sherlock tugged and they were running again towards the door under the vines. The Beauxbatons tugged it open and they were out of the room, running in the darkened stone hallways away from Filch as fast as they could manage, holding on tight.
“Sherlock” he whispered “Sher-”  he observed the painting closely, blinking slowly as if trying to assimilate, to understand.
? His
“Thinking. It’s a substitute of nicotine patches. I used to nick those from my muggle-born herbology professor back at Beauxbatons. He found out eventually and I haven’t been able to get any since. So I made my own substitute”.
“Well, she approached me when you were speaking with Dimmock” he started, encouraged by Sherlock’s nod to continue, “I admit it did seem as if she was trying to hit on me at first, asking how I knew you and why she’d never seen me around before, that sort of thing” He shrugged, Sherlock’s eyes narrowed slightly, glad he knew she definitely had been interested but feeling the sudden urge to cover John’s body with his possessively.
Sherlock frowned “No… It doesn’t matter I ate breakfast yesterday” he tried to dodge John and head towards the door.
“Sherl! Be careful hon- you’re going to hurt yourself!” Eliza cried as Sherlock sprinted across the kitchen and towards the sealed envelopes.
He swerved his broom as high as he could honest room and started shouting instructions as his team zoomed in right beating bloggers and chasing each other in preparation for the game. John tried his best not to pay attention the tingling feeling that someone was staring at him, that
“He must be really in love” Mike whispered just as John crossed the frame of the wooden door.
He bit his lip and started unbuttoning his own shirt, bringing forward his hips to grind down his rapidly filling erection against John’s. “Oh..” he sighed. How had he never done any of this before? Well, not that he’d want to do this with anyone other than John.
Over the next few hours Sherlock drew and drew.. only John. His face, his hands, his lips, his back. He dedicated at least 5 pages solely to John’s neck and 3 to the scar that had marred his shoulder.
John smiled, “You get along with your mother well then?”
Once he came out behind the changing screen Sherlock was already packed up, keys in hand. John smiled, picturing going back to Sherlock’s place and this time really letting him let go, picturing all those beautiful sounds he made when he kissed his neck and held him tight.
“Always so formal…” she turned her head, trying to see what Sherlock was scribbling onto his notebook. “Deducing me already, are you? You haven’t even looked up from that sketchbook of yours” she sounded amused, her voice just as low and smooth.
Sherlock smiled at him, realizing they were still holding hands and squeezing John’s lightly. “Come on” he whispered, pulling him along close to the far end of the room, the view getting larger and completely enveloping the both of them. “We’re going to miss it” he whispered. There was really no need to talk quietly, but this moment seemed so precious. So intimate, that the artist simply couldn’t help it. He could already picture his new painting. John immersed in the light of an approaching sunset, his eyes looking clearer than he’d ever seen them when the light hit them dead on and fused through the azure blue of his iris, tinging it with yellow lights and shifting the midnight colour into aqua. Magnificent.
Sherlock didn’t know exactly but he averted John’s eyes anyway, feeling his heart beating faster the more he thought about the way John was looking at him.
“Mhmm” John hummed back, unfazed by Sherlock’s exaggerated agony.
John shot up, grabbing hurriedly the first book he had within reach and stammered quickly “Er.. yeah f-found it!” he laughed weakly turning to look at a confused Molly, clutching a book in her arms.
. He looked completely blissed out of his mind.
“I mean it” Sherlock insisted.
Now John was able to stand up. He took the space Sherlock had run away from and wrapped his arms around Eliza, hugging her tightly. He knew it was not his place to tell her what to do. He knew that he couldn’t even begin to understand what had really happened. He knew he couldn’t help her. But comfort. Comfort, he could do.
The blonde let him go with an obscenely wet pop, just the sound making him even more desperate to get closer to Sherlock. He was instantly pulled down and kissed, Sherlock able to taste himself on John’s tongue and humming deeply.
There was no need for hurry. They had time.
John stroked his thumb across the artist’s palm, prompting a small shiver from the latter. He felt his eyes flutter in pleasure and he hummed happily.
Sherlock almost never gave in to even acts of pleasuring himself. Knowing well that soon enough the problem would go away and he had never had the need to share himself or his pleasure with another body. He’d known since he was a child that he was gay, but that did not mean that he desired to interlace himself with issues such as
Even from the floor above, you could hear the shouting that followed.
John nodded slowly, “I think so… back then I didn’t even know what I wanted. I didn’t know what it even MEANT to want but. I just wanted to be close to you. It was like a pull”.
“So,” John started. Sherlock couldn’t see his face as he coursed through the hotel’s lobby and approached the elevator, but he could tell John was probably looking at him uncertainly, still tentative as to how to act around the artist. “What are we dealing with here?”
John gave in with a groan, recapturing Sherlock’s lips and pulling the artist in with both hands around the small of his back. With trembling hands, he rubbed Sherlock’s sides gently, feeling the man’s spiking pulse directly against his chest and wanting to soothe him
John.
The bus doors opened and John climbed the first few steps then stopped, turning to look at Sherlock
“Hello, love” John sighed, raising his hand to Sherlock’s cheek and smoothing his thumb across the cheekbone.
John snickered “You're the one that never wanted to leave the library!”
“Hi” Sherlock smiled
John looked towards Sherlock and smiled. “Don’t worry. You’ll do fine. It’s just smelling a potion”
Sherlock finally looked up “You’re not interested in men, Irene. Why would my love life be of any importance? Not that there is any of which to discuss, anyway” he said, trying not to sound bitter as Irene’s eyes lit up with surprise.
Suddenly the wet heat of another mouth was gone and John had pulled away. Sherlock dragged his eyes open and was met with the sight of John looking at him, eyes wide and worried. Anxious. “I umm.. I ought to go. See.. see you soon” he smiled hesitantly, it not quite reaching his eyes and before Sherlock could do anything other than blink, trying to process everything that had just happened, the cab’s door was closed and was driving away into the night.
“She…” John took a deep breath, composing himself “She relapsed. Of course, she did. I thought I’d learnt to never trust Harry with important moments but she panicked. She’d grown used to both of us being such colossal disappointments that the thought that I was happy… well… I don’t know. I can’t help but think that was it.”
“Are you ogling me, Watson?” Sherlock smirked, looking over his shoulder and directly at John, catching him in the act.
Sherlock wondered to himself, frowning. John had no reason to contact him, even after the cane incident. He would probably just forget about everything by next week.
The Beauxbatons struggled. “Let me go! We were just joking around! If you knew him at all you’d understand! He’s not worth saving, mate!”
The day passed without a hitch. Mary was absent from class today so Sherlock was in a much better mood by the time the afternoon session rolled up. The other students were still quite entranced by John but Sherlock was enjoying the fact that during the breaks John would always send a smile his way.
“I told you. I observed. There’s plenty of evidence.”
Sherlock shook his head “No, I think you’re brave. I don’t think I could do that. And I imagine you left people behind. Your parents, sibling… significant other?”
“Off” John panted “Everything. Off”
John rolled his eyes good-naturedly, “Right. You sure no one will be around this time of day?”
“No,” Sherlock murmured. It must’ve been John’s reflection on the crystal. Why would he see John in his future, anyway? “You?” he asked.
Sherlock tried to smile back, feeling like he probably failed miserably “Uh yeah... Would you um… Would you like some tea, John? Take a seat, make yourself at home” without waiting for an answer he turned towards his left and onto the kitchen, feeling his face flaming hot red with nerves.
Six stages (the courtship)
Charmed by the unexpected answer, John smiles. “Not roses, or orchids?” Sherlock shakes his head. “Why daisies, then?”
“Speaking of fun, one thing we haven’t heard much news about lately is your love life.” There is a chorus of “oohs!” in the audience as John smirks out at them. It’s fascinating to see this from John: the cocky celebrity version of himself he presents to the public. Beside Sherlock, the real John is busy covering his face and groaning.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, but seemed to accept that John’s presence at his rehearsal for the moment. He turned off the music—something with a solo violin—and grabbed a water bottle. “It’s called ‘spotting.’ Helps to control balance and prevent dizziness.”
“Oh, just Greg and the other counselors. So that’s me, Philip, Janine, and David. Oh, and Mike. He’s one of the cooks. And I heard Mrs. Hudson added to the pool this morning.”
“Sorry mate, he’s like that with everyone.” Greg said. “C’mon, Molls and I will show you around backstage. If you like it, come back Monday after classes and we’ll fix you up with a position for the run of the show.”
John inhales a deep breath through his nose, letting his chest expand and his shoulders straighten as he looks around at each of them. “Yeah. In for a Sickle, in for a Galleon. Wish me luck.”
John is in love with Sherlock.
The orchestra fades out, and it’s just John’s voice a Cappella, fingers snapping, as he sings through the refrain twice more. Like a prayer
“I’m having dinner with John. A
From there, John has trouble remembering the exact sequence of events.
” calls Henry eventually. “It’s probably not even
“Yes, well, good,” With a startled look, Sherlock backed away rapidly and John nearly lost his balance again. “I think you’ve got the general idea, in fact you’re practically a ballerina. So if you don’t mind, I’m going to just continue with my rehearsal. Goodbye, John.”
Sherlock rumpled, lips kissed, socks off. Victor hovering over him, touching him, kissing his lips.
John’s hand covers his tentatively. “You alright?”
“Easy, easy,” John soothes, leading Sherlock to the couch with an arm around his back. His weight is heavy against John’s side and his head continues to rove around the room wildly. John settles him on the couch and sits beside him, rubbing soothing circles on his back as Sherlock’s eyes screw shut and he starts to shake his head from side to side. “Breathe, hon,” John encourages. He summons a glass of water from the kitchen because, well, fuck it. Sherlock’s eyes are closed and anyhow John is about to tell him that magic is real and his boyfriend is a wizard.
“Balance of probability. Much more likely than it being rigged.”
“And sweets.”
“Sherlock, I’m sorry. I don't quite know what else to say."
Sherlock’s face flamed red in the firelight.
This chapter’s actual rejected title was “Good Buns, Bad Buns”.
“That’s champion. You’ll need a dairymaid before long—or a wife.” His tone was jocular, but his smile was thin; John knew that his unwillingness to take a wife inexplicably irked the man. He winced.
"Unbelievable. So what did you tell him?"
believe in them either; you know enough to respect the Indian’s experience, and you reason that there’s something behind those legends, even if this generation takes a more pragmatic view.”
“She’ll hang!” John choked out, his eyes never leaving Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s belly flipped over and he felt the prickle of tears at the naked pain in John’s gaze.
“You want me to eat more.”
Nothing more had been said about being lovers. They had exchanged one more kiss, barely a brush of lips, one day as they had crossed paths in the doorway of the barn, but nothing else. John had spent his days clearing, gradually trying to reorganize his heart around Sherlock’s open desire.
“You’re sure you’re all right.”
“What’s all this?
"Do you know who it is? Did yesterday give you an idea?" John sat down at the table and picked up his cooling tea.
“How can you say that?” John was meticulously shredding the lettuce in his own hands.
“The same bear.”
They stopped for lunch in Charlottetown; John was very silent during the meal, taking in everything for his now-imaginary account book. The speed of movement in the elegant dining room where they ate roast beef and potatoes was startling to him, and he earned a brief reprimand from Uncle Gregory for staring at the waitress. He had only been trying to decide on the precise word to describe her neat-handedness, but his cheeks stung.
John spent the rest of that summer at Sherlock’s place.
“Well... I don’t know. But something tells me it’s not going to be Irene Adler or any other model like that through that door” he turned to look at Moly meaningfully
John grinned “Lucky you. Just when I was about to get to 500 points!”
When he turned back to John he was staring at his drawing, eyeing it with a furrowed brow, “Wow, what did I do”.
John watched the woman close the door and had felt a sudden rush of panic. He ran after her, needing to know if he too was special. If someday he would receive a letter just lie Harry’s and a promise of an escape to a magical land. The woman had smiled sympathetically but shook her head, “I’m afraid I don’t know, dear…Sometimes, sadly, only one sibling from muggle parents has the magical gift.”
His current painting came to no surprise to the watching portraits of the wall. All their eyes on Sherlock’s poised figure now carefully smoothing brushstrokes of golden hues peeking out of the shadows.
A few moments later Sherlock finally broke the comfortable silence. “Will we still do this? When we.. when we get to Hogwarts?”
“Okay, okay” John raised his hands as if in surrender, looking hurt. “Is it… is it the student’s knowing?” he asked softly “Telling the headmaster or something? I’m sure they wouldn’t but Sherlock, I’ll do anything for you not to lose your job over me. I couldn’t do that to you” his face scrunched up in worry, clearly not wanting to overstep but needing to know what was wrong and how he could make it right.
“It’s not like it’d be flying around the house, John,” Sherlock said. “You can let it out. And when it’s night time it’d have a cage to sleep in”
“You’re not sorry at all” Sherlock chuckled before ducked to kiss John in return. They were the only ones in the Great Hall so neither of them felt judgmental or curious stares as they reexplored each other’s mouths and lips. Sherlock hummed against John’s lips, relishing on the feeling of the blonde’s hands sneaking up to cup his neck and stroke soothing circles with his thumbs.
John stood partly behind and beside Sherlock’s canvas and started drawing.
way that I could possibly find someone that I liked more. Or preferred as a friend. You…” he paused seeming to be on the way of choking himself up with the sheer amount of emotions rising up inside of him. “You’re the best person I’ve ever met. Without you… I don’t know who I’d be.”
He felt Sherlock lightly tap his tongue with his own, hesitant and unsure. Again the question of Sherlock’s experience popped into John’s head. Sherlock was far too good at this to be new at it… but then again, this was Sherlock.
“Why didn’t you tell me you were going out with Irene?” John asked, eyes inexplicably sad and tense.
Irene walked from behind the screening again, now fully clothed in her siren cut white dress and matching delicate heels. “What is it Holmes? You seem so out of it today. You always nag your students to the ends of the earth and today... nothing? I want to get to shut down your arguments with my incomparable wit-” Sherlock smiled. “What happened today?” she prompted seriously, not concerned eyebrows, no questioning eyes. A demanding no-nonsense inquiry.
"He ordered me out of the second drawing room, which is really the limit. And I planned it well, too--kitchen unhygienic, stables would 'scare the horses, Sherlock'," Sherlock said, in an uncanny imitation of Mycroft's rather flat voice. "And of course the first drawing room was out of the question; Mother's harpsichord is there. Not that she can play, mind you, but she does love that instrument."
"He's unusual." John finally said.
“Wendigo” and “Windigo” are both common spellings (there are many more, of course, because it’s been transliterated), but the Canadian Ojibwa generally use “windigo”.
"Sleep." Sherlock said, then waved his free hand. "Sleep is boring."
“I liked it, John.”
“There’s a gland,” John began hesitantly, “at the base of your organs of generation.”
“Goodnight,” he said.
“Mine’s faster,” Sherlock said, almost gloatingly.
, John thought.
"No tea?" Sherlock responded, clearly horrified. John had seen that look on the faces of newly commissioned officers being shown the regiment's latrines.
They had only gone a few steps when they heard a loud snap of branches and a grunt. John kept to his measured pace, but a crash closer behind him told him that Sherlock had not. Sherlock sped past him, clearly terrified, and out into the cleared area. John followed, almost laughing at Sherlock’s fear, despite their circumstances. Then, he remembered Sherlock was a man of the city, and that these dark woods were just as frightening to him as dimly lit streets were to John.
Once it was up, John looked out a barrel, and filled it with water and saltpeter. He'd have to get the meat into the brine right away if he didn't want it to spoil. He sighed at the hard work ahead of them, then turned back to Sherlock to see what he'd found.
“Good for her.”
No reply. The silence stretched out as the fire died down. Finally, John rose to prepare for bed.
“I should have known you’d find it, but yes.”
A movement in the trees, a crackling of branches, startled them all. Idiot Horse strained at her reins. Arthur shied, then ran. John held himself still. Sherlock risked a look back.
"It is." John stood straighter, waiting for some kind of comment, but Holmes just tossed his head and disappeared into the cabin, leaving his horse where it stood.
He shouldered the rifle and approached. The geese were making an awful racket.
"I feel... I'm so..." Sherlock was panting now, mouth open and head thrown back.
As John sat on the edge of the settee, as close as he could come to Douglas Watson’s still, breathing body, he stared into the darkness and tried to face the awful thing that lay before him. A terrible pain consumed him, and his flash seemed years ago. He would have to go to the Lestrades, most likely, until he could earn his own living, and how was he to do that? He could not fight imaginary pirates for his bread. Worse, he would be motherless and fatherless now, with nobody to understand him. The world seemed cold--not a howling wilderness, for that would be interesting at least--but a cold nothing.
John had to laugh, but at the same time he cursed a world in which such a man was so unfamiliar with his own self.
“Maa,” said Harry, looking him right in the eye.
“That’s where you’re wrong,” Sherlock whispered back. “It’s the bicycles. In February. Nobody’s coming back here, at least not for the three minutes you’ve got.”
“Very well. Just… do as I say.”
John looked at the geese, then back at Sherlock. He
John went to the outhouse; when he came back Sherlock was in the very same position as he had been for the last half-hour. Suddenly secure that he was nearly as alone as he had been the previous night, John stripped to his shirt and climbed into his bed. As he settled gratefully into the wool blankets, he glanced up one last time at the unfamiliar sight of someone else in his cabin: Sherlock Holmes, unwelcome and yet reluctantly interesting, bent over his papers, one curl shining in the firelight.
"You've rarely said a truer thing.”
“You’d have a less labour-intensive source of sweetener,” Sherlock said one evening after dinner. He had just scraped the last of the sugar from the canister into his tea.
“You love that old bastard.”
"That's what he'd have you believe, but he doesn't appear to like horses much more than he likes bears. I guess in Carleton he takes carriages or walks."
Finally, only the threat of John waking while he was gone allowed him to tear himself away from the water. He rubbed himself down briefly with his trousers, but decided not to put them on.
“That’s faith, not science.”
“Please, John,” Sherlock whispered. “I’m sorry. I want…”
Sherlock had even met Lestrade, and despite Sherlock’s incivility and Lestrade’s wariness, the meeting had gone off quite well. Sherlock had led with a rude comment about Mycroft’s size, and Lestrade had warmed right up, though there had been a look in his eyes John hadn’t quite liked. Just how did Lestrade know the Holmes family?
“Must have been hard to stomach.”
He drew a long breath.
John fought something down that wanted to choke him, but could not.
"From Carleton?"
“Horrible old woman,” Sherlock called, his cheeks pinkening. Did John think he had a delicious bottom? He was beginning—arresting thought—to suspect that John did think so. Sherlock himself had never really thought of bottoms as such, but now he rolled that new idea around in his mind. He had no trouble bringing the curves of John’s arse to his mind; though he hadn’t realized it at the time, his mind had stored the image of John sliding underwater. He could almost taste the cool lake water on his own lips as he recalled the jackknifing grace of John’s body, the compact curves of his arse breaching above the water for only a moment. It did have a pleasing shape: lean hollows above the sweetly rounded gluteus muscle, all set against a muscular back and strong thighs.
“Good. Look,” Sherlock said, as though he was reading John’s mind. “I’ll put myself back together.”
John looked at the row of little glass containers along the back of the bench. At least one of them contained squirrel viscera. Another was, without a doubt, chicken manure.
John held his breath. Now Uncle Gregory was only holding the old account-book.
John needed to get outside, and soon. He took his plate to the kitchen bench and headed for his boots.
Harry's plaintive call broke into his reverie, and he shoved the thick wool blankets aside and got out of bed. The air in the small cabin was icy, and outside the wind whistled forbiddingly. He shrugged into his heavy coat and poked up the fire before shoving the door open. Another blizzard, dammit--he leaned into it and pushed. He'd have to shovel the front later, but for now he needed to get to Harry before she started destroying things.
Another one of my obsessions is names. I especially like old-fashioned Quebec names, of which Philemon is one. He was almost called Phydyme, which is my favorite.
Because he was, wasn’t he? John looked at Sherlock.  His body swayed with the music and his face was dreamy with pleasure. He was right at home here, and at John’s, too. With John.
John shook his head and watched the Dimmocks and the Barrymores roll away into the gathering dark with something like satisfaction.
They rode a short way in silence, Sherlock attentive to each inch of verge once again. John watched him, letting his own alertness lapse a little and drawing in a deep breath of fresh spring air. Sherlock did seem healthier than ever possible when he was absorbed by a mystery in this way, his brain seeming to run faster even than when he had been dissecting fish or experimenting with bread. And his generative organs seemed to bother him not at all.
"Leave them ALONE," Sherlock shouted, "You furry arsehole! You squirrel-murdering parasite!" Another wallop.
There must be a link—but how? Why?
“You,” John said, closing his eyes, “are going to be the death of me.”
Then, he looked around. Sherlock was clearly visible—in a spotlight, in fact, leaning against a wall and looking casually gorgeous. John’s heart leaped, but he clamped it down and positioned himself diagonally from Sherlock, so they could see almost the whole bar.
"Maybe you should," he said. John's eyes widened, and he pulled Sherlock's head down into a bruising kiss. Sherlock gave himself up to it, suddenly ravenous for the feel of John's skin.
When he came down the stairs Great-Aunt Martha was setting the breakfast table in the kitchen, which seemed quite bright and jolly in the glow of morning sunshine. Even the black hole in the ceiling had ceased to be spookish and become only a commonplace entrance to the kitchen loft.  And there! On the red-sandstone doorstep Eva was sitting, preening her fur as contentedly as if she had lived at New Moon all her life.  John did not know it, but Eva had already drunk deep the delight of battle with her peers that morning and taught the barn cats their place once and for all.  Cousin Mike's big yellow Tom had got a fearful drubbing, and was minus several bits of his anatomy, while a stuck-up, black lady-cat, who fancied herself considerably, had made up her mind that if that narrow-faced tabby interloper from goodness knew where was going to stay at New Moon, SHE was not.
“Fuck!”  he exclaimed, scrabbling for decency and his trousers.
The road was clear and dry, and the day was fine; they reached Bonne Chere before noon.
“Shake on it?” Sherlock held out his large hand. John hesitated, just for a moment, and clasped it in a firm grip.
It was true enough, he supposed – even if it was only half the story.
“What are we going to say?” John wasn’t ashamed, but he didn’t want his neighbours in his private business, either.
“Julia, dear, I’d like you to come and meet Violet’s son. You remember, Violet Grondin that was? Holmes now? This is her youngest boy, Sherlock. Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson had divested the loud woman of a covered dish, “This is Mrs. Barrymore and–blast it, Prue, put the tarts down and come here—Mrs. Dimmock.”
, John.”
THIS IS NOT GOOD SCIENCE.
When he woke up, Sherlock was standing there, fully dressed, with two Roll Up the Rim cups in his hands. John pulled the covers back over his head in the hopes that he was hallucinating, but when he peeped back out he was not.
“Sherlock!” he yelled, divesting himself of coat and boots and stomping his feet on the mat. “What the hell were you…what is this?”
A couple of historical, hand-wavy inconsistencies: it’s too early for fiddleheads (fresh fern shoots) when they eat them. Fiddlehead season is usually mid-May. Pretend the’re canned or something.  Also, I couldn’t find any evidence for coywolf hybrids in the mid-19th century in Canada but that doesn’t mean they didn’t exist. Sherlock seems to think they do though and who am I to deny him?
“I…” He stopped. His breath seemed trapped in his body. Sherlock said nothing.
“I don’t think it’s gone.”
“Stop, for the love of God,” John said, wheezing.
. He clenched his fingers and shook himself, fighting to keep the surge of adrenaline confined to his upper body, but the blood slowly ebbed to his cock. He tried to focus his anger back towards Sherlock, towards the foolishness that once again was keeping him from his work, but he could not find it. Only desire, and then, thankfully, laughter.
Also, it was impossible to climb out the window. Greg wasn’t that familiar with young boys’ hijinks, but he remembered climbing out of his own bedroom window once, and being whipped for it. He knew that he did not have it in him to whip anyone, and therefore the issue was best avoided.
“That’s what you think,” the widow said, but she said it to empty air. John had disappeared into the study to watch over his father.
Sherlock said nothing else, but—quite rudely, John thought, although at least he could respond in kind—pulled out a handful of notes and began to read. Well, that concludes the interview, John thought to himself. Then, a sudden abashedness came over him—-he should probably at least offer to feed his guest. Some doctor he was.
Sherlock set his coffee down and spread his legs provocatively. John straddled him, but waited until he’d ostentatiously pressed the “start” button on his timer before bending forward and kissing the notch in his collarbone. John sucked a little, until the flesh was soft and tender, then nipped Sherlock hard enough that his body jolted beneath John’s. John rocked his cock against Sherlock’s, and though Sherlock remained silent, the soft huff of his breath told John he was hitting the right spots. He sat back and undid each shirt button, touching the sparse hair on Sherlock’s beautiful chest. When he finally drew the shirt back to expose the full spread of Sherlock’s shoulders, he could see that his time was almost up; wasting no more time, he fastened his mouth over one peaked pink nipple, tasting Sherlock’s bare skin and feeling Sherlock’s cock harden against his own.
, Sherlock.” John said. He took a piece of toast and dipped it into the bowl. It was too hot on his lips, but so rich and delicious he ate it anyway.
“Goodness, Sherlock dear, how you’ve grown!” Mrs. Hudson said, when Sherlock released her.
“Indeed, and not before time. I should never have worried; I’m so sorry I troubled you, John. It’s just that my system was much more overloaded than it has ever been—perhaps some research is in order—but thankfully my mind is quite restored. You, I perceive, slept fitfully, despite your earlier emission. Perhaps it was the stimulating effect of the tea so late at night?”
John did not disturb him, reaching behind the settle only to hang up his coat. He dipped some hot water out of the kettle into the kitchen basin and washed his hands and face, then pulled up his work chair near the fire to warm himself. Sherlock glanced up at him, without a smile but with a friendly expression nonetheless. John felt, with surprise, no awkwardness. Their early conversation had been almost pleasant, despite its distinct oddness, but he felt no urgency to renew it, and Sherlock clearly wasn't inclined to talk. Instead, John settled down to stare at the fire, as he did most nights, though tonight there was no whiskey glass in his hand.
“All right, Sherlock?”
“About that. It’s the rain that worries me, though. It’ll likely soak us, and I don’t want to risk another sprained ankle for you.”
“She’ll be fine, John,” he said, taking the basket.  “Go on in, now.”
Sherlock nodded, feeling rather awkward, and turned away to finish washing his hands. The kitchen fell silent as they all set to their tasks; only the clank of plates, the sizzle of meat, and the gentle chink of eggs being put to boil could be heard.
"John." Sherlock's voice, pitched low in his ear, rumbled through his body and John couldn't help but arch up against him.
"The cow is fresh and I'll take her to Mrs. Hudson's tomorrow to visit Byron."
"You utter bastard!" John thought of the few coins that he had drawn from the worn leather bag that served him as purse and bank both. Mycroft Holmes' shoes cost more than his home, he'd wager.
“I’ll finish this,” John said, “then we can go.”
… with your tumescence?”
“No more than four coffees a day. My system can’t stand any more than that.”
Sherlock stared at him for a long moment without speaking. John recalled seeing much the same expression on Harry’s face when she ran to the end of her tether and was jerked back.
Oh, John desired him, all right, desired every creamy, frustrating inch. And he had permission, he thought. Permission to take Sherlock's cock into his hands and give him pleasure. It would settle him, too, John knew it would; likely Sherlock was just too much of an arsehole that nobody wanted to get close enough to fuck him. A few "crises" and he'd be much more tractable.
“Now.”
"Can we... since it's light... can we bring a bucket of water in?" Sherlock sounded suddenly unsure.
John waved and, scooping up Idiot Horse’s reins, walked over to Lestrade.
"No respect for science."
At every gross breach of civility, John would try, and fail, to remain calm. The moment he lost his temper, Sherlock would submit meekly to the dressing down, a tantalizing flash in his eyes that would force John to turn away in order to maintain his composure.
As he drew on his trousers, the pamphlet crackled in his pocket. John extracted it from its constant resting place, as he had learned by now that Sherlock could not be trusted to respect normal conventions of privacy. Unfolding it, he perused the design as if he did not know it by heart: the slim, curved figure, to reach the gland, and the broad, flat base, presumably to avoid a disappearance into the fundament.
“I’m not your patient!”
“Nonsense!  There are barn cats at New Moon, but they are never allowed in the house.”
"It'll save you rushing back. You can have dinner with Mrs. Hudson and stop at Lestrade's for a whiskey, if you like." Sherlock said with dignity.
He had just decided not to start a fire right away when Sherlock came trotting into the clearing—or rather, Idiot Horse came trotting into the clearing, carrying Sherlock on her back like a sack of flour. Sherlock’s curls flopped crazily, and his face was that of a martyr. Arthur lifted his head and snorted derisively.
"Please," Sherlock's voice broke into his thoughts, "I want... may I?" He took a step towards John.
[/spoilers]
“When this is finished, I am going to bite you all over.”
“Sherlock!” John exclaimed, and Sherlock, startled, fell back into the pile, face first.
Sherlock cut his eyes at John, but did not seem to take offense.
“Mother rarely dined with us. Too busy with her research, I suppose.”
“Are you doing this on foot or on horseback?” some imp compelled John to ask.
“What can I do?” John asked.
But what about John? He had been discomposed, nervous, and tense.
John stood, draining his cup.
“She’s just bleating…no, she is bellowing. Someone’s coming.” John rose to go to the door but Sherlock sprang up at a speed that seemed unlikely given his previous languor.
Supper was, of course, salt pork and potatoes, with some of the early wild cucumber that Sherlock had gathered to stave off scurvy. John ate without tasting, though, still slightly preoccupied with his discomfort at the human scat in the woods.  Sherlock ate the potatoes and cucumber, but only pushed the salt pork around. Eventually, John speared it with his fork and put it on his own plate. He was hungry, at least.
But he had. And when he had… disaster. He drew a long, shuddery breath.
“You can.”
"I like the sound of 'worm units'" John grinned, and Sherlock ducked his head, a pleased smile on his face.
“I will be.”  The note of finality was unmistakable.
“Fine,” said Sherlock.
A light rain began to fall. It was not as cold as the night of their hike back from the lake, but neither was it warm. John hoped Sherlock had his coat on.  If he had come out to the barn in his shirtsleeves, he would catch a chill, and another bout of hypothermia would mean the end of them both.
“That you won’t be able to make it?”
He says something to Guglielmo that's kind--tersely kind, but kind--and Guglielmo can barely look at him. Probably because he's got an extremely awkward boner under those worn and stained work jeans. John goes back to his room and writes a poem about slim, clean-limbed boys.
“Stuff. You threaten me so often with bears that I’ve come to believe you just use them as,” Sherlock paused, smugly, “
Sherlock turned away. He would not flee.
“Just…let me think about it, Sherlock. I have to consider everything. I can’t rush in.”
John’s hand was raised…it was winding itself into his hair. A slight tug nearly brought Sherlock to his knees again; his scalp seemed inexorably connected to his groin.
John won again. He was starting to wonder if Sherlock was losing on purpose.
, that he had needed to follow John to the barn when he had deviated from his usual habits,
He knew it was right. If he laid hands on Sherlock’s body and brought him pleasure, only disaster could ensue. He thought of the shipwrecks of his past loves; he could not subject Sherlock to that.
Sherlock tried to lift his arm, failed. Tried again, with the other arm. It moved, a little.
“I will try, and succeed, in stopping you.” John’s fist clenched. He did not need Sherlock running around loose in the woods when he already had a dangerous mystery, a moribund squirrel, and a neglected potato patch on his hands.
"Cold?" said Great-Aunt Martha kindly.  "These June evenings are chilly yet.  Come into the sitting-room--Mike has kindled a fire in the stove there now, and you can have a little lunch before bed."
"Geese?" Sherlock was immediately diverted from the question of bedding. "I read a very interesting article on bird intelligence recently. Do you mind if I perform an experiment or two on yours?"
“Your mother is a bluestocking?”
John, seeing he was not going to get another word from Sherlock for the rest of the evening, set water to boil for dishes. When those were done, he poured two small glasses of port and broke up some chocolate.  Setting Sherlock’s share at his elbow, John sank into his chair and watched the fire…and Sherlock, despite himself. The firelight illuminated Sherlock’s distinctive profile and tinted his dark curls with a warm light, and the whole picture was of such pure perfection that John wished he could immortalize it. He was no artist, though.
By early afternoon he was ravenous, but he had also managed to get the tree down. The sled was getting full when the wind changed, bringing him the rank, distinctive smell of goat. Male goat. He sighed. The rattle of a wagon and the familiar “Yoo-hoo!” call confirmed it: Mrs. Hudson had arrived with Frank to breed Harry and Clara.
“I shouldn’t theorize, as we haven’t been able to make it down to the southeast ravine before dark in the last week or two.”
John looked at him. In the low firelight, Sherlock was only a pale shadow against the blankets, but John’s brain filled in the missing lines of his body: the broad shoulders, the surprisingly muscular arms, the light dusting of hair on the lean chest. To get back into bed would be a master class in self-control. John exhaled gustily. His breath formed a wispy cloud in the cold air of the room, and he shivered.
“But why draw our attention in this way?”
“That way,” John pointed. “Oh, and, Sherlock?”
He looked towards the barn. Sherlock was still standing watch, wedged in the doorway in case Harry should try to escape once more. His face was cast in shadow, and yet John felt as though he could trace every feature.
"I'm starting to see why he wanted you out of the way. Animal experiments can be very messy."
He slung the sack into Arthur’s saddlebags. Then, he untied Idiot Horse’s reins and handed them to Sherlock, who had stood and was waiting diffidently beside Arthur for John to be ready. Arthur whickered in irritation at Sherlock’s closeness. Sherlock pulled a face at him.
Each inch of skin was a terrible temptation. John knew he was in deep—dangerously so—but it was too late. He would set the world on fire to protect this man. His man.
“Anyone would believe that that animal never eats.”
A loud baaing interrupted his thoughts, and he looked at the sky. It was a trifle late; perhaps he would do the chores (with clothing, as Harry was not to be trusted around anything that appeared to be loose and flapping). Then, he thought, looking at the still surface of the pond, a swim. He would scrub himself clean and slip back into bed with John. He wanted to touch every part of John's body, and he wanted to do it soon.
“You don’t believe in them; they’re unscientific. Except…you don’t
Sherlock was not so lucky.
“It is a mistake,” Sherlock said, leaping on to the settle and surveying the whole cabin, “to theorize without knowing all the facts. Tell me about the other neighbours?”
“No. Go. You’re going to the south field to clear. I know how to find you.”
“I should imagine you didn’t.”
“Sherlock!” John called. Sherlock walked out of the water and continued walking. He was going to make tea—a massive quantity, in the kettle itself—and then he was going to drink it alone, on the roof of the shanty if necessary. He could live out this crisis—he cringed at the word—in peace.
“Pick up the cups when you’re finished,” John sighed, and went to see if there were any dinner ingredients that didn’t come from giant aquatic rodents.
“I helped you a bit!” Sherlock called from his corner.
“Bet that was your first word,” John said, in his ear.
“There are snowshoes on the outside of the cabin, if you want them,” John said, and left for the barn.
“Thank you,” he said, softly.
He would return to the site -- yes, he would. John was hoeing the potato patch on the far side of the house and would not see him; he could run there and be back before John required lunch. Perhaps there was more to see, after all.
“Well, your mouth.”
John slammed the door of his truck and clomped his way up the steps of 221 B Avenue, Baker, Ontario. Or rather, he tried to. Two feet of heavy snow covered the steps; the only tracks out were his own.
“A job well done,” the elder Dimmock answered, coming up behind Joe and clapping him on the shoulder. “We ought to thank God for the help.”
