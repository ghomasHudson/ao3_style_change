Sherlock was breathless. “I took it out to box. Otherwise…”, he trailed off, trying to suck in some air, “since I decided you were coming with me.”
John used the hand he liberated from Sherlock’s back to reach under him and coat his hand in the lube still leaking down onto Sherlock’s bollocks. When it was slick enough he took hold of Sherlock's cock. Sherlock didn’t know whether to push forward into the fist stroking him or back onto the cock splitting him open. He went with both and between the two of them, they set up a rhythm that sent them hurtling towards a climax. John had no breath for anything but keeping up the punishing pace, while Sherlock was pleading and moaning, “Please, John, please, yes, more, don’t stop, John, John, John…” gradually devolving into babble as he got closer and closer.
“Nonsense. You’ve been nothing but warm and cuddly,” John said as he walked quickly over to Sherlock and hugged him from behind, kissing him on the top of his head. Sherlock looked back at him and smiled. Target neutralized.
Since the day we met, you have seen me ignore the opinions of the rabble. Such is the change that you have brought about in my life, that I now care what some people think; some very few. (See previous letters). Most infuriatingly, I care, overwhelmingly, what you think.
John sighed and tilted his head dubiously, but kept his voice neutral. “Maybe the summer suit. Silk.”
When they reached the restaurant, Angelo was as ebullient as ever and tried once again to convince them to stay for the meal, but Sherlock reiterated John’s assertion. “I’m not at my best, Angelo. We’ll make it up to you, weekend after next?” He looked at John, who confirmed. “You can put yourself out as much as you like then.”
Sherlock was flushed red from his chest to his cheeks, with the combination of arousal and embarrassment that set John’s cock pulsing. Sherlock buried his face in John’s hair to hide. With his trembling fingers he brought John’s hand back around and along the delicate skin, covered with goosebumps. When he felt the base of the plug that Sherlock had buried inside him, John’s knees wobbled. He grabbed onto the sleeve of the coat to steady himself. “Fucking hell.” He swallowed and as he ran his fingers over it lightly, Sherlock shuddered. John rasped out, “How long have you had it in?"
“Smart mouth for a man with a smarting arse,” and he gave him a pinch, just to see him flinch. “If you behave yourself, I’ll let you play with my stethoscope this evening.” Sherlock turned around, spatula in hand and proudly displayed the admirable tent in his black silk boxers. He growled in a register that made the teaspoons rattle. “I’ll show you mine, if you show me yours.” John understandably lost focus for a moment, staring at the impressive display and licking his bottom lip. He couldn’t stop himself from cupping Sherlock’s bollocks and running his cupped hand up the rigid length. Sherlock’s head dropped back with a moan and he dropped the spatula, jarring both of them out of their lust-driven stupor. John stepped back and shook his head. In a hoarse whisper he said, “I’m going to take a shower.” Time for another wank. He turned back once and hollered, pointing his finger at him. “And don’t interrupt me this time. Or I’ll…do something.” He fled.
He was sleepy and sated from last night, the omega hadn’t even been aware he could orgasam as much as he did the night before.
“I don’t want the medicine’’ the omega boy whispered. “I-I-I want my pups to be with you, you are safe.”
With a sigh, John slung the duffle securely around his good shoulder and scooped the tiny omega up awkwardly. Reaching the lobby John paused at the exit desk. And setting the thin body down plucked up the keys for the chains and a generic pair of grey joggers provided with his purchase of an omega.
Sherlock sat cowering in a butter-soft leather chair in the courthouse as John shouted at the secretary.
Instead of getting up and rounding the long table the boy slid out of his seat and onto the floor crawling under the table the pregnant omega pulled himself back out from under the table and onto John’s lap.
John settled on the loveseat's left side (closer to the door.) with his legs spread and back straight in the perfect picture of dominance and aggression. Having his newly bound omega around so many strange scents were stamping on his nerves.
“Our thcents are to thimilar to be cousinth, but we don’t look that thimilar. Thame mother different thire?”
“I thayed with hith body. I was too thcared to leave. I kept thinking maybe he would ‘wake-up’ and wathn’t really dead. Then they brought me back to the auction houthe and thold me to Ryan. I didn’t even go to hith funeral.”
One hand cradled his Bee the other held John’s mobile captive his face lighting up as Molly rambled on with a story on the other end of the line.
The previous blush and uncertain look settled on the boy’s face as he nodded towards the eye make-up.
Walking to the kitchen John sat down at the table and pushed a second chair slightly away from the table for the omega.
“Jawn Pleathe!” The raven-haired boy wailed as wet tongue and thick finger worked their way inside of him. “I’m ready pleathe!”
“When I’m bad.” The boy corrected himself. “Like when I didn’t pick up my bookth and you had to punith me.”
“Oh hmg- Yes!” John growled cuping the pale hips and pressing his massive cock into the gasping omega inch by inch.
John ground his teeth together in anger, a human, his soon to be mate, should not have to ride in the boot and then be moved to tears by the simple act of a light being handed to him. This was inhuman. Softly he shut the lid taking extra notice of the vent holes on the sides of the lid.
“Jawn I need y-you! ” The omega was writhing now in the nest, rutting against the soft fabrics, arse clenching desperately for something to fill it.
The older omega stiffened in apparent distaste before crawling forward to bow at John’s feet. John scowled and pulled back.
“He was given to me.” He snapped back, “and it doesn’t matter how old he is he needed me.” The omega in question quickly buried his face in John’s neck at the harsh tone. Speaking softer John continued
Sherlock clutched John’s thigh and sniffed, the boy lay face down over the plush green sofa’s cushions pale backside bared. The flawless marble flesh was now mottled blue and purple a skin broken in one place.
The stripped Jumper while defiantly comfortable wasn’t very intimidating and gave off more of a cuddly teddybear look than strong alpha.
John pulled his mobile from his pocket and set Sherlock lightly down in a bus row encouraging the girl to sit also.
“Master Thean let me netht but that was before I had heat. He said I could whenever I wanted, even if I wathn’t old enough for heat yet. ”
“Abby has been promised to another alpha but I suppose he could be persuaded to take my brother instead.”
The dark jeans fit like a glove tight in just the right places, the purple sweater was perfect, soft and warm and just slightly baggy like the young omega preferred. John let out an appreciative growl from where he sat lacing up his shoes.
“Pregnant? Are you sure? Can you tell how many, when do they come?” And a dawning of terrified shock
“Pleathe!”  He didn’t need to ask twice. In an instant, John was over him on all fours plundering the omega’s mouth and rutting against the much smaller cock.
And if this alpha was a Detective Inspector he would probably be just that, intimidating and strong.
John could picture the raised eyebrow through the darkness and it only served to annoy the older man.
“s’lock? Whaaaat are you doing?” John spoke through a massive yawn. The omega bowed his head further bitting at his trembling lip.
John couldn’t tear his eyes from the boy, he walked closer, his skin was marble white, also hairless as was typical of an omega, contrasting violently with the riot of black curls on his bowed head. The dirty oil-slicked body was malnourished but slight hints of muscle were still visible under the snowy hairless skin. Unusually broad shoulders for an omega, but with the expected characteristics of softly curving hips, a plush arse, pink lips, and thin build.
“That people were gonna try and fuck you? Or course I was. I’ve been here for over two years. I know how these people think.”
That alpha was sweet kind and then he ordered the teenage omega into his bed and nearly broke the thin body, impregnating the omega and beating him severely when the litter of pups didn’t make it. Throwing Sherlock back to the slavery-like a piece of rubbish.
Sherlock however looked edible in the sinfully tight black jeans and perfect purple sweater. John could help himself and stole a kiss as he walked past smearing clear lipgloss onto his own mouth.
Greg was pacing back and forth hackles raised as Molly gently cleaned and bandaged the boy. He was still angry at John but he had at least listened to his explanation and accepted the fact that John knew he was wrong.
John sighed rubbing at his face a digging his knuckles into his eyes. The boy at his feet shifted pressing his face into John’s calf nuzzling again the fabric and whimpering softly. It suddenly hit him. He didn’t even know if his omega could understand him, or speak. No, he understood his eyes showed that but perhaps again he had to be given permission to speak?
Remembering his master’s promise of good news he quickly stabbed a noodle with the fork provided. It had been ages since he was allowed a fork but he still remembered how to handle one. He kept his eyes trained on his bowl and focused on eating slowly, who knew when he would eat again or what the punishment for eating to quickly be.
Somehow those words did clam the ex-solider. He after al. had killed many men in combat and one in self-defense.
Hailing a cap John placed their order on his mobile and handed the man a few extra notes to allow Sherlock to sit in the cab.
Sherlock woke when John’s knot deflated and instantly whined at the loss of fullness. Wriggling below the alpha he managed to wake the older male.
Now John was busy stripping both of them Sherlock to sleepy and hunger sated to pay much attention to the alpha.
“I’m proud of you. Using the bathroom, and showering by yourself was very brave. You did a good job Love. Okay? You didn’t do anything wrong. I overreacted okay? I love you, Sherlock. Do you understand.”
The moment the strap was loose the omega collapsed forwards taking deep gulps of air and pressing his face into John’s bent knees. Before he knew what he was doing John found himself with a lap full of the beautiful omega thin arms and legs wrapped around him as he stroked the dark curls soothingly and pet the back of his elegant neck.
“That’s Alister, he basically runs the prison and you caught his eye. And as if it wasn’t enough that he decided he wanted to fuck you you had to go and piss him off.”
Sherlock knelt on the red cushion grateful for the plush pillow against his knees as a chatty beta woman blabbered inanely on to John about the pros and cons of different fabrics vs leather or metal.
The muscular alpha finally seemed to come to and took an overly large bite from his jam slathered toast. Crumbs stuck to the beginnings of a four-day-old beard. He would have to shave, Sherlock being an omega had no such problem, he couldn’t have grown a beard if he wanted to.
John groaned his member jerking up and very nearly stabbing the sleepy boy in the eye. Sherlock looking incredibly focused slid himself back up the alpha’s body and re-alined John’s cock with his hole.
“I’ll be good I promise I’m sorry Pleathe” blubbering tears ran down the sixteen-year-old omega’s face. A small shriek of pain escaped those pink lips and Sherlock let his head hang crying.
Both males took in a deep breath to calm themselves. John pushed forward and oh fuck oh hell he was right there.
The scent of omega in heat was stifling, and all John wanted was to claim he omega and mark him where all could see.
The omega rubbed a hand over his concave stomach he couldn’t let it happen again. No one would kill his pups, even if that meant running away and most likely being killed for it. No one would touch his pups if he were to ever to have them.
Bracing himself above the boy John pitched forwards, tenderly assaulting the pliant mouth beneath him, the omega whimpered. Pulling back for air and to search the alpha’s eyes. A moments pause and the two mouths joined again.
John slid out from under his omega draping the blanket-clad boy on the sofa and sneaking into the kitchen to prepare dinner.
Squaring his shoulders Sherlock stared at his reflection. He would have to please John, be a perfect omega, submissive and helpful.
Long pale fingers twitched every so often and he could practically feel the slave vibrating with discomfort.
The omega quickly finished his food and seeing that John had also finished his bowl rested his head against the alpha’s shoulder.
“Can I give you my number? I’d like to see you again.”  The female omega was ignoring John her kind brown gaze focused on Sherlock who was at the moment toying with the plush bee’s antenna attentively.
Mike stood outside the door listening to the hushed voice of John speaking and the sounds of drawers being pulled open and clothes being pulled on. Satisfied that his friend was exiting the room Mike wandered to the kitchen to make tea.
John thought about what he’d just said, and thought about how a lifetime of habits died hard. Of course Lisa knew about Harlan, it was probably the first thing she felt when she woke up this morning. Now that John knew how strong and deep a bond could settle in between two people, he’d never needed to ask a question like that again.
“Yes?” John questioned as several of the other agents in the room leant in to hear. He found he didn’t really much mind, they were on his side after all.
John settled himself in for a long wait, unsure of what Sherlock was doing and whether or not he’d be inclined to respond. He thought about the micro-heats, Sherlock’s misery and how all this was enough to do any sane person’s head in, let alone someone exceptional like Sherlock Holmes.
He was more than surprised when an answer came not thirty seconds later. Sherlock was rarely what one would call attentive when responding to John’s, or anyone’s, text messages. At least, he never had been.
Since the idea of starting a conversation with Mycroft seemed too much for his frayed nerves to bear, John pulled out his own mobile. He wasn’t sure if it was the distance, or the fact that both their lives had been irrevocably changed, but there was one more thing he needed to know before things got too far, before his mind succumbed to the all-consuming rush of hormones.
,” John stuttered, elbows trembling with the effort of holding himself on all fours. The pressure on his neck remained as Sherlock reached back with one hand, lining his cock up with the slick passage.
John grunted as Andrew brought him down, hard, on the wooden floor. Another shot from John’s gun flew wide of its mark, and John had no idea where that one landed because Andrew was soon sat astride his hips, knife flashing, eyes shining with murderous intent.
Mycroft continued, unamused, “as I was saying, being a man of science, medical though it may be, I wonder if you have you ever heard of the Polar Shift Hypothesis?”
“Good on you love, good on you,” John replied with a short laugh he couldn’t quite contain. He never thought he’d actually feel the need to praise Sherlock purely on the volume of his ejaculate, but, this was his life now.
It is a safe bet that Sherlock had a bad experience, perhaps when using and that is why he is celibate. I also noticed Sherlock’s addiction was not down-played, John was very concerned about danger nights and Sherlock really is uncomfortable with seeing people “subject to motivations against their own will.” This sounds like a parallel to addiction. I think when he was using, sex was involved and he abstains from both because they are all tangled up in his head.
John scooped up the pistol from where it had fallen, checked the mag, then tucked it in his waistband. Across the house, several room over at least, a door slammed.
With a low sigh, John binned the soiled papers and walked to the sink to give his hands a good scrubbing, Sherlock following in his wake like a nervous shadow. When he was satisfied his hands and nails were free from oil and gun shot residue, John cleared his throat, glancing at a looming Sherlock practically hovering at his elbows.
“Just now, Chesney phoned. He says it was Andrew, Terry’s Omega. Terry…uhh… I don’t know his last name.” All of Mycroft’s cronies stayed in the foyer and stared at John, obviously waiting for something.
But, Sherlock was right, as always. Although John had no doubt that he would never be officially connected to the death of Mr Russell and company, there was no use in tempting fate by leaving potentially damning evidence laying about.
The funeral was a surprisingly crowded affair. Lisa and Harlan’s work on the streets had made an impression. John caught the scent of at least a dozen Omegas, and recognized a number of NSY officers as well as even a doctor or two from Barts.
JW esp. thinks that “the new normal” will be cataclysmic and ruin their friendship but maybe it just moves the guideposts.
No, he couldn’t  think that way. Sherlock was not his, he did not belong to John, and he couldn’t give in to this biological jealousy and possessiveness. Sherlock was his
The two of them collapsed in a sticky-sweaty heap on the tangled nest of blankets, exhausted. Sherlock indulgently lickied at the bond bite, cock still rigid and buried inside him. John gasped as he felt Sherlock shudder, apparently shooting another burst of come deep into his womb.
“Contrary to your opinion, John, I'm not actually inexperienced, and unprepared anal sex is agonizing.”
Man who runs an underground Omega trafficking business in London. Very little is said about him other than that he is evil.
Per the original text,  the author establishes that under normal circumstances, an Alpha can smell an Omega from five miles away. This distance increases to fifty miles if the Omega is in heat. See:
“You too,” he challenged, and they both knew they weren’t talking about nudity anymore. This was about letting go now, and taking this final plunge
John locked eyes with Sherlock, who was no doubt deducing exactly what Chesney just said by the look on his face alone. Sherlock’s expression was grave, fragile, especially since they both knew what it was like to be willing to give their lives for the one they loved most in the world.
“John, in the spirit of full disclosure, I think they already have. I am experiencing a very powerful urge to bend you over the back of Mycroft’s £3,000 armchair and just take you.”
“Sure.” John snapped, though honestly he hardly cared what bloody bells rang when in what bloody tenor - whatever, that meant. He was sure by this time tomorrow he’d hardly be able to remember his name, let alone have enough mental acuity to phone Sherlock.
The staccato of their rough breathing filled the room, and the wet sounds of Sherlock pounding into him with animalistic delirium went directly to the pleasure centres of John’s brain. It was inelegant, frenzied, simple - but somehow everything John never knew he’d wanted.
With his shoulders low and gun gripped loosely, John exploded through the doorway. A young man lay face up on the flagstones, his clothing already dark with blood from where the bullets had torn through his flesh.  A Beretta 92FS slowly spun on the tiled floor where it had slipped from nerveless fingers. The man took a few gurgling breaths before falling quiet, eyes going dim.
They found her there, shivering in her thin hospital gown with garishly sparkly slippers adorning her small feet. A gift from a friend perhaps? They didn’t exactly fit with the tomboyish persona she projected to the rest of the world. A dressing gown, inordinately fluffy and powdery blue, lay thickly over the top of Harlan’s sheets, hiding the alarming jut of his hipbones and knees.
In 2014 the population of London was 8,538,689 (see "Population Estimates for UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, Mid-2014". ONS. 25 June 2015). While the original story takes place in late 2013, these numbers are likely closer to the 2013 figures than the results of the 2011 Census.
“Mycroft had gone beyond the call of duty to volunteer a personal home that would be routinely visited by a keeper for the duration of John's stay.”
Sherlock took a step back, lips swollen, eyes half-veiled and feral as John kicked off his loafers and socks before shedding his trousers. John’s pants were damp with moisture, both in front and back now, and the pungent fluid caused the fabric to cling to every tender piece of flesh inside.
We sincerely hope you enjoy our efforts. Please come visit us on the Tumbles: shipping-by-numbers.tumblr.com and justsuperblue.tumblr.com
He checked that his ringer was set on maximum volume, and shoved the phone into the front left pocket of his trousers. He had little experience with flumazenil, and even less with megestrol acetate. Most of his patients had been human, as Alphas and Omegas typically saw Omegaverse specialists. Due to its limited duration of effectiveness, Megestrol acetate was not used as a suppressant, and due to its heat blocking effects it was an equally unpopular birth control method. From what he remembered, the drug typically took effect within sixty minutes; his heat would be suppressed for approximately twelve hours, and conception would be prevented for the remainder of the estrus cycle. One hand absently made its way to his right trouser pocket, and his fingers closed over the smooth, cool vial.
John swallowed spasmodically against the abrupt declaration. He couldn’t say he was surprised, because he had one of his own.
It was extremely difficult to take someone else's well crafted world and follow in their footsteps (Brandon Sanderson/Robert Jordan Wheel of Time series anyone????). But I think we have come up with something that remains true to the original concept, but also makes it a bit our own as well.
“It’s all right, I’m - oh God, I’m so sorry,” John began, “I understand. Go. Mycroft needs his best people working on this.”
It was more than a relief when Sherlock replied, though it seemed like an age had gone by in the meantime.
John silenced his mate with a good natured whack to the arm before rolling to prop himself up on one arm.
“They released me a month ago. I’m feeling alright, more or less. Does that satisfy all the questions you couldn’t quite ask?” She smiled at him, like old times, like the last four months didn’t even exist, and popped a bit of gum between her teeth.
brand of domesticity, both men shared a guarded look. They’d told Chesney to call them today with any updates, good or bad, and knowing what they knew now, they dreaded the worst.
“The ambulance is here,” Chesney gasped, having gathered himself together once more, “I have to go. I - I hope you find Sherlock.”
A few more minutes was probably all they had before the strain of the situation broke him. John reminded himself that despite Chesney’s bravery he was still only 18 years old. Diving into the water to save a friend was far cry from watching your cousin bleed-out from a gut wound.
“Yes,” he growled, moving a step towards him, and then apparently thought the better of it and spun back to face the door. He appeared loathe to leave the room undefended, and John didn’t think this was something he could convince Sherlock to let go.
“When we were fighting on the bridge Terry called her a liar, I thought he was talking about faking her death to Harlan but he must have suspected she was the one who killed Rexfield.”
“Exactly. Why would he tell a lie that will undoubtedly lead to his own death? What was his motivation?” He let the pause hang dramatically between them before continuing rapid fire. “
John called upon his courage, as was more than accustomed to doing when trying to have a serious conversation with Sherlock Holmes.
“Take off your clothes.” Sherlock rumbled, only a hair’s breadth away from John’s once again sensitive ears. “I want to see you.” His baritone eased its way into John’s brain, whiskey dark and just as sweet.
Sherlock only snarled in response, never slowing his pacing, angling his nose in the air every once in awhile as if sniffing for intruders. John wracked his brain for something, anything, that he might have heard of that could help his friend. He vaguely remembered reading an article by Dr Shibuya about “denning” behaviour in Alphas, an extreme reaction brought on when an Alpha perceived their Omega to be in danger. It typically presented as a regression to territorial behaviour focussed solely on getting the Omega to a defensible area and then safeguarding them by any means necessary.
John slapped his hand hard against his face. He had no idea how much of the sedatives were still in his system, or if he was even in a fit state to be giving life-saving medical advice over a bloody mobile. It was Chesney’s  distressed breathing, huffing through the line in fits and sobs, that finally made up his mind.
now. Splitting up had been a disastrous decision and John was finally able to understand why Sherlock was so hell bent on the two of them remaining together. All their separation had done was get one kidnapped and almost killed, while the other stewed in an agonizing hell of his own making.
John smiled and nodded placidly, knowing Sherlock was only looking for attention. It was two days into their mini-break holiday, and the man was fidgeting on the bed, having already depilated four 3x3 centimeter squares of John’s leg hair to correlate re-growth time with the different hair removal methods. Why he couldn’t have done his own legs was never adequately explained. How, John
In his fevered dreams Sherlock was there, lean, hard, beautiful, but far, far away from him. Sherlock was there with Lisa, and Chesney, and John remained alone. Alone, because Sherlock didn’t want this, never wanted it, he told him he never wanted this, and would never want it. Sherlock found all of this beneath him, tedious, and now he would think John was
John groaned into his hands, a sound of such pure heartbreak and misery that Timothy immediately placed a cool hand on the top of John’s head. It was a small gesture of comfort, but it felt good nonetheless. John moved his head, leaning into the touch and revelling in the sparks of sensation that ran down from his scalp to his very toes. He shivered with sensitivity.
It wasn’t so much that Sherlock said yes, he didn’t have to, he felt Sherlock’s cock swell against his thigh, as if the thought of breeding John excited him. John felt his own entrance contract and pulse thickly with sympathy, even though he was days away from heat.
Chesney snuffled into the phone, perhaps wiping his face or covering up a sneeze, “yeah, I’m meeting with the barrister on Monday.”
“I… I am sorry, I didn’t mean-” Waverly sputtered as all the other agents moved away, returning to their posts and separating like sand in a strong river current.
Sherlock affixed the young man with a stare that, given the right amount of exposure, would most likely be deemed illegal in several small countries. His efforts ultimately went unnoticed though, as the the agent loudly rummaged through the crisper and pulled out one single apple, crunching merrily into its skin with a groan of delight, and shuffled back out of the kitchen completely unaware of the world around him.
“You need to be more specific, I need you to describe it as best you can.” John pounded on the door, thinking vaguely that it should probably hurt more as he viciously thumped the fleshy bit of his left hand in three rapid beats. “Did you call 999?”
“Yes, I just took the suppressant- should be about an hour before it takes effect,” John leant against the doorjamb, suddenly dizzy, probably from the amount of drugs roiling around in his veins. Some of the other agents looked alarmed, but he pushed them away with a strong hand. “I’m fine, God, you’d think I was the King of England!”
“Git.” John smiled and turned to face him, sliding a warm hand up Sherlock’s side, feeling each dip and curve of his gloriously naked body. “He said that you liked children.
"I met Terry in 2009. He was one of our better workers, and I just...trusted him too much too fast. He seemed passionate. Ready to help. He was an alpha, so I assumed he understood the pain of...look, I thought he was a friend, but he was never one of mine. I'm sorry, John. Truly. He came for me, and you were collateral.”
The second email attachment was a colour scan of his driver’s licence. John’s first thought was that Andrew did not look the
The response made him think for a moment as the car veered off the main road and onto a smaller side-street. Sherlock’s text was more than a little bit ambiguous, and he pondered whether he should ask for clarification when his mobile suddenly buzzes with text after text after text.
There was a moment of silence before Chesney replied, a strange and questioning tone lingering in his voice. “No, he wasn’t...I, Dr Watson I just told you that he wasn’t. He can’t go into heat anymore.”
The driver commented, rubbing his hands together quickly as he huffed air into them. "Wish the sun would come up. I'm too old to drive in the dark. Eyes have gone bad."
Andrew laughed to himself and flung Sherlock’s head away towards the wall, letting him fall limp against the crumbling plaster, sliding with a grimace back to the floor.
that it brought John to tears. His hands scraped and flexed against the floor, unsure as to whether he should push back into the stretch, or pull away from the intensity.
“Not as of yet Dr Watson. We are pursuing all possible avenues of investigation at this time. We did locate the girl you knew as Stevie.  She was able to positively identify  Dr Sylvan as the man she knew as Lysander Evans. We are working with her now to try and identify the locations of the safe-houses that Andrew might have known about through Terry.” This new information was delivered in a neutral, almost flat, tone. It was almost as if Mycroft’s ubiquitous PA was bored.
John only smiled, pushing away the horrible revelation of their conversation and thinking only of his love for the infuriatingly, impossibly, wonderfully
“You have Sherlock?” John almost talked over her outright, his impatience and need for good news finally outweighing English propriety. He had hope, though he knew it was a dangerous thing - a useless emotion that Sherlock had probably deleted long ago.
Harlan tells John that Rexfield Barcroft murdered his bonded mate Lisa-Shay Palmer on December 8, 2013 (two weeks prior)
“Good, that’s great Chesney. Now, I need you to tell me exactly where she’s hurt?” John stood up carefully, slowly testing his balance and strength before heading to the door.  For a moment he swayed, dangerously so, before righting himself again with a grunt of effort. At the door, he rolled his eyes with overt frustration when he found it locked. He probably should have been more grateful, as it was for his protection after all - now, it was just in his way.
There was no use waiting for standard English niceties, and he began talking the instant the call connected, sliding his bare feet into a pair of his trainers he found on the floor at the foot of the bed.
“John - I’m not sure why I came back here,” Sherlock turned away, closing his eyes against the small room before him and the frank reminder of their situation. “I…I was not thinking clearly. I need to leave before - ”
No answer, or at least, none John had heard. The footsteps moved away, out of earshot, and while both men continued to talk, it became far too muffled by plaster and stone to be understood. John continued to move along the wall in a crouch, stopping just before the corner towards the front of the house. The front door opened with a slam, and John tensed when he heard the march of angry footsteps heading in his direction.
Andrew must have sensed his decision, because he crouched forward suddenly, knife still in hand and leapt towards John’s legs in a lunge meant to bring John crashing to the ground. At the unexpected movement, John fired a shot, the bullet going much too far to the left and embedding itself in the wall in a spray of plaster dust.
“Alright, well noted,” John conceded, never too proud to give credit where credit was due, “but how are you getting from there to murder?”
He swung his gaze round to Timothy, who left the glass partition down, but put the car in gear and began to drive once more. John forced his attention back to his mobile, typing another text to Sherlock.
John cleared his throat and shifted his legs, crossing one ankle over another, denims scraping along his skin as he did so.
“Yeah, that all makes a sick sort of sense.” John wasn’t sure who to feel worse for: Lisa who’d been abused and then betrayed by her own body, or Harlan, irrevocably bonded to someone who could take no joy in the union. He couldn’t imagine how terrible it would’ve been for them both. Lisa and Harlan had been a team, and deeper than that, potential bondmates. When Rexfield impelled their change with violence, he’d robbed Lisa and Harlan of the chance to offer themselves freely to each other out of love. Instead, their bodies had become battlegrounds, every cell urging them to bond, but knowing that due to the circumstances they would only hurt each other - and hurt each other they did, over and over again, never able to forgive each other or themselves.
“Can you even do maths, John? We thought Harlan was 27, he registered as an Alpha at 16,  that would have made Lisa nine years old and we know that is incorrect. That is not only horribly inappropriate, but illegal by
But no, John was alone, always alone and the lesser, the disregarded and the overlooked, and he remained so as he convulsed and drooled into his eight hundred thread count pillowcase, twitching in a drug-induced half-waking, half-nightmare entombed in God-knows-what-room of a nameless house on a nameless street in a tiny village on the outskirts of Petham.
This is somewhat supported by the Omega who did not want to go on the Registry because “they would find her.” Is Lisa the person on the inside? The first Omega, Magdalena Orr, was also registered before she was killed.
John tasted blood, he felt the heat of righteous anger dull the pain from Andrew’s frenzied punches. He bucked and heaved in an affort to dislodge his attacker, hoping he could at least land a glancing blow to his face or disarm him. Barring either of those, he didn’t see this ending in his favour.
"How long did you know him?" John asked around the memory of Terry's gun and Lisa's wild crack-shots firing into the night. She had to have been somewhat trained to be that familiar with the anatomy of a gun.
Timothy gave him a wry smile, “Of course. Birthday parties every year, he even fancied my sister for a bit in secondary but, well…we always knew we’d end up with each other after we changed. We’ve been together nigh on,” Timothy thought for a moment, scratching at his hairline underneath his chauffeur cap, “forty years now. We’ve two young-uns of our own, several grandkids as well. It’s all that matters really, family, and love.” He smiled brightly, eyes wrinkling and gleaming with an inner light that could only be recognized as a life well-lived. “Sorry if I get a bit emotional you see, it’s the hormones. We Omegas react to each other like that sometimes, when one is in heat.” He shrugged, chagrined.
Sherlock continued scenting him, breathing  in with heavy uninhibited huffs, unconsciously grinding himself against John in short, teasing thrusts.
enough. The sense of incompleteness was shattering, and all John could do was sob and push back into his lover, unable to speak but hoping Sherlock would understand.
“We’re under orders not to leave you unprotected until your heat is in remission,” Waverly replied, surprisingly earnest. John promised himself he’d put in a good word for this man when next he saw Mycroft.
“ - really think this is for the best?” Pounding footsteps neared the window, and John made himself as small and unnoticeable as possible, clenching the loamy ground unconsciously in his left hand. Try as he might, he could only catch snippets of a no doubt heated conversation, “...your Alpha...Terry was a...made up his own damn mind to get mixed up with the likes of Lysander and you
Sherlock had been loathe to move his ‘optimally placed’ furniture, but the Omega and ex-Army side of John just couldn’t bear to sleep without his back to the wall. After much grousing and good natured sniping, they’d agreed to shift the chest of drawers to have their nest flush with the south side of the wall. This gave them a clear line of sight to the bedroom door, the bathroom door, and the window.
” John drooled, tongue thick and fuzzy, the mealy dredges of drug induced sleep still clutching at his consciousness. He could barely even hold his mobile steady, let alone parse the deathly importance of what was just said.
Taking another deep breath, while also praying Mycroft was as good as Sherlock seemed to think he was at keeping things out of the courts, John waited for the heavy footfalls to turn round the corner before he sprang into action.
Three months later found John heading home from the shops, precariously juggling several paper bags that insisted on shifting their contents every which way, usually towards the pavements. He’d only made it a block before a small hand grasped his elbow, righting a tilting carton of eggs before gravity took over and made egg-covered fools of them both.
He only realized he was still holding his mobile when the light from the screen blinked off, and he was left alone and emotionally wrecked in the darkened room once more. John quickly shook himself out of his fugue, fervently stabbing in Mycroft’s number on the tiny screen, probably with more force than necessary.
Reality cut through the haze, clear and knife-edged, leaving him acutely aware of his nakedness and altogether unsure of how long he’d been lost to the drugs and heat. John almost dropped the mobile, his hands diaphoretic and weak, making it difficult to hold on to anything. He cursed the decision to take the sodding benzodiazepines from Mycroft. Now that he finally could comprehend what the hell he’d just heard - he felt like he’d been doused in ice water, each muscle and nerve tensed with a rush of adrenaline strong enough to momentarily override the burning need of his heat.
“John!” Sherlock jerked, making to move towards the door before Andrew put him down with a thunderous blow to the neck. Sherlock coughed, slouching back towards the floor before wrapping both hands around his head. John didn’t take his eyes off Andrew for long, but it was hard to miss Sherlock’s slowed movements and the flush of blood against the collar of his white shirt.
Only a few of the agents managed to look surprised, but one brave fellow immediately made a beeline straight towards an open area to John’s left, disappearing behind a half-wall that lead into what must be the kitchen.
“And what is that?” John motioned towards the bottles, setting his chin forward in an unconscious defense mechanism.
“Right, right...j-just fold whatever you’re going to use and put it over the wound, make it as thick as you can, then press down -
Almost an hour and a half later with no word or update, John was antsy and impatient. He’d stood for so long under the scalding water, scrubbing the sweat and slick of heat off himself that his skin felt raw and bruised. He’d chosen to prowl around the back entrances of the house, watching cars zip by and the dainty flowers dip in the breeze.
John drew his brows together, finally taking in the hard portable storage monstrosity resting on the bureau top. It made for an interesting juxtaposition - organic versus plastic - and John had no doubt that what Sherlock said was true, though he didn’t remember it being there before hand. It must have been Mycroft.
wash. We were just dropping Sherlock off at your flat when he got a text saying Lysander was arrested early this morning.”
The cabbie murmured impatiently as John got in, and proceeded to drive aggressively nostrils flaring at the sweet scent of fertile unbounded omega. John could feel nothing but jealousy in the moment and he soon realised he was practically drowning the cab in the sent of aggressive alpha hormones. For the sake of the omega in the boot behind him, he tried to calm down.
The bruising was nearly non-existent after the last night’s ministration of healing kisses. John’s eyes followed the path of milky pale hips and the muscular v leading to an innocent, dusty pink penis, and a deliciously leaking hole.
“I only came because you’ve been neglecting your mobile, I called you and hundred times, you were starting to worry me.”
(side note: Also what do you get your boyfriend for his birthday? I'm really not good with that type of stuff... Help!)
It had asked for age: (full grown,16+) hair colour? shrugging he had scribbled (dark brown/black). If they were to breed he didn’t particularly want a bunch of redheads or blonds, he had been made fun of enough as a child to have a certain distaste for blond jokes.
It, however, would be disrespectful in the extreme to disregard his instructions and the solider in him refused to disobey an order. So here he stood, it was 5 'o' clock in the evening and the traffic in the auction house was slow.
“Thop Jawn thop crying and apologizing. I disobeyed you I deserved punishment. I’m sorry Jawn. I am the one who thould be thorry. I will obey you next time.” The confidence slowly died through Sherlock's speech until the last sentence was nothing more than a whisper.
The large alpha buried his head between Sherlock’s thighs licking up the shining slick with a greedy tongue. Making the boy’s toes curl in embarrassment and pleasure.
“J-Jawn wh-what are you doing” the boy stuttered as the large alpha began crawling towards the sofa, eyes dark and predatory.
“Mhm, an omega male. He reminded me of you, when he wakes up you’ll see, he’s the only one of our pups without brown eyes. Greg?”
John was coming, he was in the hall. Sherlock pulled away from his hand and knelt on the bed all fours, face pressed into the mattress, presenting himself for the alpha.
John flinched internally when noticed the scar of an unwanted, and later broken bond as a doctor he knew what a consensual bond mark looked like, this wasn’t one of them. The fact that another Alpha had bread, bonded and knotted HIS omega made the alpha in him scream to mount the boy right then.
Sherlock was thin, very thin, but not as unhealthily as John had expected. In fact, he was rather well developed, his entire body a smooth line of pale muscles.
“Thank you love.” John smiled. He hadn’t even had to voice his thoughts and already his omega had solved the problem. Looking in the mirror Sherlock was right. The boots add a whole to air to the outfit.
“That’s not fine, and I intend to feed you multiple times every day. Besides you hardly ate last night you have to be hungry.”
John kissed his omega possesivly ramming on last time into the pink pucker and came silently as the boy’s arse tightened around him.
Sitting up with a swallow Sherlock brought his arms to wrap around his knees the trill of arousal dampening his fear.
John growled deep in his throat scaring the beta clerk and making an omega mother, his alpha, and three pups turn to look at him curiously.
“No love, I meant do you want some tea?” The slave sat back on his heels rubbing his glossy lips together nervously. He looked pleadingly at John looking for permission to speak.
“I-“ Sherlock looked pleadingly at John. “Am I allowed to call Molly?” The silver eyes begged and John found himself nodding his head before the request had even fully processed.
John was nervous, frustrated and annoyed. On top of that now his shoulder hurt from slamming into the hard floor. Why could his omega just obey? It really was simple. Pick up the book and sit it on the shelf. It only would take a few seconds.
“My name is Mrs Hudson I won’t hurt you…This was mine sweetheart when I was a pup… I had hoped to use it if I ever had any pups, but you know beta’s aren’t as fertile as omegas and I never did have one. I would like you to have it in case you ever have a litter… would you like that?”
“Mhhmgh I love you too Sherlock” John murmured through a yawn. The alpha tightened his grip on the tiny omega and clumsily pulled one of the nest’s blankets over the pair.
Snapping back to the matter at hand John sunk gratefully into the hot water relaxing  his muscles singing in relief. Despite the pups not coming for atleast 4 and 1/2 more months Sherlock had insisted on having at the very least having one crib ready in case. Therefore John had been working on assembling the bloody thing most of the day.
John gave the young man a small but genuine smile and moving slowly tugged off the oversized jumper leaving the boy naked again.
“When’s the last time you fed him? I bet it’s less often than you fuck him, you old man. He’s just a child. Sixteen! And how old are you forty? Forty- five? Fifty? ” John growled lowly in anger hackles rising.
“I’m th-th-thorry, You thaid I could uthe the bathroom whenever I wanted tho I was just thowering and getting ready. I won’t do it again I’m thorry Mathter, I mean Jawn.”
Nosing over his omega’s cock John smiled inhaling the sweet scent of arousal and the beginnings of slick.
“Like I said,” John ran a tender hand through the dark curls “he was given to me, the military decided to reward my service with an omega… I had no choice in the matter. And I couldn’t leave him, he can’t even walk Mike.”
“Hush. Love you need to listen to me and stop panicking so quickly.” The omega stilled and burrowed into John’s neck snuffling.
The locker was deeper than John had expected and inside was rather bare only two nondescript cardboard boxes and a dusty instrument case.
“Thomas, he’s got a brother over there, an alpha.” Mark pointed over to where a young pup crawled back an forth across a green blanket aggressively racing with someone of his imagination.
“Love, are you okay go sit in the sitting room and wait for me?” John asked desperately needing a moment to collect himself.
He was still a boy. He could pass for as young as 16 but considering his placement in the room had to be at least 18.
So I'll won't be able to update everyday anymore and it will be more like two or three times a week. Sorry:(
John was angry with himself now, he knew how typical alpha/omega relationships worked and he knew that holding an omega’s head underwater was not an uncommon punishment, often used on omega’s who had drunk without permission.
“I told you the first day you can go to the bathroom whenever you like. You do not need to ask permission.”
Alex L. Weathers, 2 pounds six ounces, Gender: omega Sex: male Hair: Black Eyes: Blue Length: 11 inches
“that still doesn’t explain why you were getting a slave in the first place, you’ve always been against slaves, you’ve been very vocal about it!”
John held onto those pale hips roughly thrusting into the tight wet heat above him. Sherlock was so tight almost painfully as he clenched down on John’s cock greedily.
The alpha skipped the groin area in favour of doing what would most likely be the worst last and examined the torso of his omega, concave stomach and prominent heavily bruised ribs, miraculously nothing broken, the omega’s neck would need tending something to stop the swelling and a salve to heal the skin.
“I know you know what you did was wrong. And I know you said you were sorry but I want you to know I will be watching. That boy means the world to Molly so if I feel that you are in any way abusing him I will have him removed from you.”
Mike went to retrieve the mugs while John settled both himself and the omega on the sofa. Placing two mugs within John’s reach Mike settled on one of the two armchairs and waited. The fear scent making the omega decidedly less appealing to the weaker alpha.
Tomorrow he’d be back at the surgery and John supposed he’ll have to bring Sherlock along. It wouldn’t be wise to leave the boy alone. Not while the boy was pregnant and the bonding papers had not yet been finalized.
“Swimming?” John guessed as the boy wrapped himself up in a towel getting ready to follow John to the shower.
Laying the panting omega in the center of the nest John stepped back to observe the beauty before him.
“How’s this…What is your birth name?” The boy sucked his plush bottom lip into his mouth worrying at it with downcast eyes until he finally answered.
“Molly!” Sherlock wrapped his limbs tighter around John as he spoke drawing the attention to himself.
“I wish I had something that would fit you better but I guess what you’ve got on now will have to work.” The alpha sighed eyeing the too large red jumper, shorts, and huge grey socks.
Sherlock, however, seems unfazed nuzzling into John’s chest in his sleep his soft scent warm and content.
“Come on” he whispered more to himself than the young man and pushed open the door tugging slightly at the lead in order to break the boy from the daydream he seemed to have fallen into. John rubbed his face. What was he getting into?
Although the bee technically wasn’t in the cart. The omega had latched onto the stuffed toy and clutched one of the fluffy legs with his fist.
John smiled and reached to pet the dark curls affectionately and revived a  pleased keening purr and lick of his hand in response.
John sat Sherlock down on his own feet as he rung the bell to Molly and Greg’s house and fidgeted with his too cuddly jumper.
“Hush love, I’m just going to take care of your bruises okay?” A small sigh of relief escaped and the tiny omega uncurled his legs and allowed John access.
John grinned and thrust up in one brutal movement than had Sherlock arching his back and screaming in pleasure.
“Yours!” Sherlock gasped breathlessly arching into the aggressive touch. This alpha was strong, but he was also kind, which made the possessiveness arousing rather than terrifying. It made Sherlock feel safe and protected rather than captured and owned. He keened under the domination and peppered the alpha with licks and nips where ever he could reach.
The room they entered was cluttered, old, and yet clean. A rickety love seat sat across from a blue wingback chair. A metal exam table stood in the left corner, a desk to the right, and stacks of paper covered every centimeter of the old wood surface.
Sherlock clung to his plush bee chewing nervously on his thumb's nail. As John tried to sit him down from resting on his hip the omega whinged burying his face in the alpha’s white coat.
The flawless skin of his omega was bared completely as the boy lay naked in the bed. The position obscenely open, quite obviously prepared, and John’s alpha had no problem imagining what to do with the gift before him.
The auction house was so well known that even though he hadn’t visited the impassive marble building he knew the location without needing the address. He didn’t particularly want to buy an omega. John felt he was perfectly capable of taking care of himself and did not plan on using someone as a tool or toy.
“ yeth thank you,” and reaching with pale hands for the soft cloth. He gave the beta a genuine smile and she made a quick exit.
The raven-haired-omega looked puzzled and nearly trampled the older freckled omega in his lurching forward to scent him.
The boy kept his face to the ground. “Look at me” the omega rose his head slightly flinching and cringing away from John’s large hands and cain.
The dark-haired boy was by no mean poorly endowed but he was after all an omega which meant even fully hard he would not choke a mature alpha. That being said an omega’s cock was every bit as sensitive as an alpha’s if not more so.
Sherlock relived himself gratefully and refastened his trousers. Kneeling down the boy looked up at John with big eyes and thanked him.
Fearful of interrupting his alpha’s brooding Sherlock refrained from drinking any water as his bladder was already quite full and he did not want to have to ask permission.
Propping his head up on a pillow John early plundered the pink lips above him savoring the taste when a heavy pounding on the front door stopped them short.
Scenting the young omega deeply John buried his nose in his neck and allowed his free hand to explore the contours and ripples of the alabaster back tears pricking his eyes at the uneven ridges of lash marks.
John had watched with fear as Sherlock ran his pale fingers over one particular photo. The man, Sean John assumed, had his eyes crinkled up in laughter, arm thrown around a sheepishly grinning Sherlock. The pair were both covered in flour Sherlock’s bouncy curls dusted white the silver and gold collar still gleaming under the bright light of the massive kitchen.
Sloppy wet kisses covered the alpha’s face as the omega sobbed outrageously clutching John’s beetles tee.
A tall man with dark skin and a crooked smile was the boldest, he reached forward seizing Sherlock’s arm and pulling the boy flush against him.
John growled tugging at the waistband of the blue striped trousers. The omega hurried to comply, his smaller erection happy to be freed from its confines.
One it was inconvenient to his master. An omega should never inconvenience his master that was a lesson he learned with his first master when he was still five years old.
The thin beta woman at the omega registry looked incredibly bored. She was chewing on a piece of gum as if her jaw depended on it and staring off into the middle distance blankly.
The boy continued to stare at his nails and John sighed, grumbling under his breath about death wishes.
Sherlock shuffled on his knees despite not having drunk anything at lunch the two cups of tea from that morning were putting pressuring his bladder. The red-haired woman wrapped a hideous floral print collar around his neck and seemed to consider it a moment before looking up at John’s distasteful grimace.
A bonding was considered good enough and many alphas would scoff at the idea of an omega becoming anywhere close their equal. Laying back down John tugged the sleeping omega to his chest and kissed the parted lips.
John ran a hand through his short blond hair as he impatiently waited for the lift to reach the top floor.
Sherlock darted forward sliding onto his knees and seizing the case. Pulling it up into his lap the boy flipped open the case to reverently run his hand over the instrument inside.
“Watson!” her nasally voice shouted without warning causing Sherlock to jump and whimper and John to glare at her. Walking into the door indicated John held a protective arm around his omega. Sherlock for his part was overwhelmed the scents of so many newly bonded couples lingered on every object, clinging to the brown wallpaper, and rising up from the ugly carpet.
Mixing a protein pack into a glass of milk John retrieved the paper in his pocket from Molly and placed it on the right side table the side of the mattress furthest from the door that the alpha had already started to think of as belonging to Sherlock. Smoothing the covers back onto the bed with military precision one last time John returned to the sitting room to find an awakening omega.
“Why! Johnathan Hamish Watson! You went and bought an omega after all that talk about how buying people is wrong! You should be ashamed of yourself!”
John froze unsure what had brought this on and slowly eased onto his haunches keeping his hands in clear view. Trying to take on the least threatening position he could muster while murmuring gentle reassurances.
“Andre’s new ‘master’ I presume. I don’t know if you are aware Sir but there are laws regarding proper diet for omegas and it does not appear you are following them.”
“Mathter! I don’t want a different alpha mathter pleathe, masthter. pleathe keep Pup- Love pleathe mathter!”
John squeezed his eyes shut tighter and opened his mouth in jaw cracking yawn. The bed was warm from the mates combined body heat.
His heat would start within the next two days maybe John would give in by then. A heat alone would be painful.
His omega, his beautiful clever omega. John lay the omega down on his queen sized bed and brushed silky curls from his glazed eyes.
He hadn’t taken John outside of heat yet and he wasn’t entirely sure his body could adjust comfortably to such a large intrusion.
“Pleathe stop, Pleathe!” Sherlock pleaded as another teeth chattering strike pulsed through his body spreading red hot waves of pain through his sensitive arse and exposed aching private parts.
The grey haired omega on the boy’s right said something that made Sherlock smiled shyly the other omega was a rather chubby woman with soft features and wild textured hair.
John was angry this alpha had bred the poor boy almost every single heat since he was 10 years old. Bred and terminated each litter of pups.  Murdered them in John’s eyes. It was after all legal but by no means right considering the omega would have had no say in the terminations.
Mycroft visits Gravesend RAF and receives some intel regarding Captain John Watson. John is caught up in a case of mistaken identity that could have costly consequences.
John is silent for a moment, and James finally meets his eyes. He smiles, then they both laugh. John grins, “Well, I can think of some circumstances wherein I might be able to call you Major still if you ever find yourself in the right mood to pull rank.” James looks back, scandalized - then both men dissolve in boyish giggles.
“That's not Moran and you know it. Are you disappointed? Poor Sebastian - loyal unto death to King and Country, after all. Maybe that’s how you’ll bond with this one...his little Captain, your brave, strapping Colonel...", Irene gestures back to the room where Sherlock Holmes is held. "How does the poem run? ‘
“No. They won’t figure that bit, but I may have a bit of a reputation with the ladies - and after singing up on stage….well, I’d have to be blind not to pull someone, wouldn’t I?” John peers out from under his blonde lashes, and Sherlock can’t resist kissing him once more.
Jim smiles, “Towels are in the cupboard. Don’t be too long”, Jim smooths his hands down Sherlock’s chest, and misinterprets the shiver as pleasurable.
“Quite. Well, I can have my agents make discreet inquiries amongst the clerical staff - not that I think there is much future in it. If Moriarty has a source and revealed it to you, no doubt the first place to look for that person is the bottom of the Thames.”
“I see. So - were this...person’s attentions the reason for leaving your sixth clinical facility under cover of darkness?”
“A codename isn’t the invasion plan. And - though he quite enjoys gloating - why even hint at his source to me? It’s illogical”.
Sherlock looks at John’s journal, fingers tracing the ink forming ‘Dear Sherlock’ on each page, “I’ll stay. Bring in the nursing staff as soon as you are able?”
“I think your sniper would have to repeat his course, and his shot was not a clean one”, Watson makes a note on the rough chart and goes to move away, but Moran stops him.
They tour the gallery - Mycroft stands closer to her than he should. He is more interested than he ought to be...he cares more than he should. Alessandre is flirting with him, but Mycroft cannot tell if she means to flirt, or if it’s completely impersonal.
“Then perhaps for the remainder of the evening, you could call me Alessandre?” She fixes Mycroft with a look that is both veiled and analytical.  Blue eyes then, Mycroft decides  - exceptionally dark blue - for a moment, they recall the steady gaze of his brother’s companion, Dr. John Watson.
Training Excercise Tiger was a bit of a disaster for the Allies - hundreds were likely killed between the German E-Boat attack and friendly fire accidents, but the incident was hushed up so as not to give away Operation Overlord plans.
John enters the Officer’s Mess and salutes his Colonel, “Capt. John Watson reporting, Col. Moran, sir. Duty officer told me you wanted to see me?”
“Sir. The moving crew will arrive in the morning,” Anthea carefully pitches her sentence between a statement and question.
“Corporal, get me that dressing kit? Looks like we will be here for a while - at least until first light.”
“I need to finish what I started with Mycroft...but I will come tomorrow night. And...will you stay at Montague Street tonight?  Even if I cannot come home - I want to know that you are there.”
This lovely fic prompt was going to be a quick song and dance, but I've found - much to my surprise - that there is a longer tale to tell about the planning of Operation Overlord, Sherlock the Spy, and Moran/Moriarty... So I do hope you will enjoy reading it as much as I have enjoyed researching it, listening to period playlists, and reviewing WWII history that I'd have otherwise forgotten.
Jim Moriarty hears the line cut off. He looks in the mirror, smoothing his bespoke Vivienne Westwood suit. Alessandre’s here - and that can only mean one thing. It’s finally show time.
Mycroft reaches into the secret compartment in his desk, extracting a packet of letters. He places them in front of Sherlock, “There is one other item - not sent by Capt Watson, but likely his Corporal Bill Murray - John’s journal. I’m not certain he intended you to see these - but Murray thought John had given up and this was his...response to save his friend.”
Glenn Miller takes the stage to thunderous applause. He announces that the evening's’ concert would be broadcast back home over the wireless, and the band swings into their first number. Corporal Murray grabs John by the arm, “Captain! I can’t believe it - all the lads here and without even trying that bird of paradise flies right up to you!”
Sherlock Holmes - in the original stories - was something of a master of disguise. So I resurrected that aspect of him to impersonate Winston Churchill to the man's driver.
“They say that there were hundreds of tunnels that sailors would escape through to avoid conscription aboard a Royal Navy vessel. Romantic, isn’t it? Always better in theory than in practice, I’ve found. Rats, you see. Absolutely everywhere - enough for one to abandon each of those sinking ships in the Channel. Don’t worry - Jeff won’t put you down - they look hungry.”
have more frequent meetings - but she wouldn’t be as exposed and attuned to changes in Admiral Cunningham’s diary”.
“Tomorrow your orders will come through - you are moving up to Portsmouth. I don’t want you to be anywhere near Moran. Are you sure I can’t have you transferred? Mycroft..”
Jim Moriarty leans by the door of the American Red Cross club - he’s glad to be back in England, even if he must pretend to be a US soldier to do so. The American enthusiasm for the war meant the sheer number of GI’s has staggered all efforts to maintain control over them. SHAEF was pouring men and supplies into England - it was clear that something was coming, and soon. Perhaps this extracurricular intelligence gathering would be unnecessary, but Mycroft Holmes was a powerful man, and if Moriarty was certain of Nazi victory, he was also the sort of man who made contingency plans. Mycroft himself was unassailable, but Jim knows how to traffic in people - and Mycroft’s brother could be the pressure point that brings Mycroft to heel.
“Mr Holmes, your brother indicated a different address,” Anthea hedges, “221B Baker Street, London.”
“You do. Yet you will not help me find him,” John meets Mycroft’s eyes; it is a statement, not a question.
With the door closed, Sherlock starts filling the tub, as a cover for examining the room. Like many manor house dressing rooms, the wall contains a secret panel from which a valet (or mistress) can easily enter or leave. When the room was converted to a bath, the passage was not removed - it was partially blocked by the installation of the tub. Fortunately, the door opens out into the passageway to the servants quarters. Sherlock shuts the water, and lets the bath drain a bit under cover of flushing the toilet. Then he turns the hot water spigot on, grabs a dressing gown and slippers from the wardrobe, and with a press of the panel - he disappears down the narrow hallway.
“Well, thank goodness you are immune to such urges.”, John smiles at Mycroft without a hint of humour. Sherlock grins and arches a single eyebrow in Mycroft’s direction.
The men crowd the foredeck of the SS Victoria and HMS Princess Josephine Charlotte. Their faces are blackened with Pond’s Cream; still, no one speaks. It is difficult to discern much in the pre-dawn fog as the ships of the Operation Neptune armada roll silently at anchor, miles out to sea.
“Oh God, yes” John removes Sherlock’s hat, handing it to him. In that moment’s distraction, he flips Sherlock against the tiles, pressing the length of their bodies together, tangling one hand in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock gasps as John murmurs, “You are doing that right now. Just...yes, right there...oh!”
“Well, Mycroft. You brought him here, you didn’t shoot him - so I assume we are not going to behave as though he’s a child from whom the biscuit tin ought to be hidden.”
“I believe he could be”, John pushes the needle home in his arm, “Good night, Colonel” - and walks away.
“Sherlock.,” John’s voice carries a note of warning, “Professor - I take it you didn't bring pajamas to the opera?” John continues.
John is incensed - but he catches a look in the colonel’s eyes that causes his anger to crack open and drain away. Moran is scared - if anything, he wishes John would put him out of his misery, instead of waiting for death or transport. He thinks back to something Mycroft once said.
“Will do, Corporal - 2nd Devon should catch up soon enough - we can hand off some of the injured - then I’ll try to…incoming”, Watson and Murray look up - several stretcher-bearers trot into the RAP. Capt. Watson instantly begins triage, until the man on the third stretcher pulls him up short.
“You still aren’t frightening. Aggravating, yes. Along with fantastically self-important. But you don’t frighten me, and when it comes down to it - neither do the Germans. But I would rather take my chances with them than spend another moment in this car with you,” John growls.
“Mycroft.” Breaking eye contact, Alessandre settles back into her seat, watching the English countryside pass in the undulating fog.
“Perhaps not. Moran made a play for you - yet he knows who I am and he knows I’m on the staff of the Admiralty. The balance of probability suggests that Moran has been told to stand down with regard to me - which means a new player is about to enter the field.”
After patching up a sergeant who will be lucky if he uses his arm again, John comes up for air and sees Bill, dragging a gut-shot marine back into cover. 47 Commando was to muster at Le Hamel - a plan complicated by the continued German presence there - a presence announced by the continuous artillery barrage strafing the beachhead. It is nearly noon before the commandos muster at Les Roquettes, where they set out on a forced march to secure Port-en-Bessen. Before long, the marines are pinned down in the village - waiting for air cover before advancing on the Eastern and Western features. Capt. Watson and the other medics improvise a Regimental Aid Post in one of the more intact houses.
Mycroft smirked, “I strongly suspect Anthea would object to your analogy on many levels, and she probably knows the First Sea Lord’s diary better than Andrew, but I take your general point. Not every aide-de-camp is Anthea”.
“Obvious. So - you have returned to London, and instructed Anthea to move your belongings to a flat on Baker Street - when I think you know that, without reasonable assurance from a man of medicine - that you are fit for service, I will simply remand you into institutional care...again.”
Jeff leaves the kitchen, and Irene walks over to the cloudy window - opening her compact. It’s mirror flashes a series of signals outside. Then, adjusting the edge of her lipstick, Irene closes the compact and returns to the lounge to face Moriarty.
“Nooooo. Noooooo. I wanted our first time to be special - well, at least conscious”, Jim rubs his hands together greedily.
I don't know what to say about this chapter other than "It's Over". I've cheated on Across Every Universe with CMBYN fandom (and more recently - a wee dalliance with SKAM Italia) - I've wanted to re-write the whole thing (except for the songfic in the start). I've done some amazing research that might make this into a real novel one day (totally different throughout the middle - but it was only once I got John invading France that I realized the huge, historically accurate opportunity I missed with the SOE and D-Day spying. It might be nice to have the protagonists in the same country for the entire middle bit, until snipers and fate intercede, for example.
Hours late for tea, Sherlock resentfully hails a cab to take him to Mycroft at the Diogenes Club. John left his bed only an hour before - Sherlock had to send one of the more reliable members of his homeless network to bring them some food, as John discovered after their evening and morning exertions that Sherlock didn't have so much as a packet of biscuits in.
The Sibelius is his undoing. As the romantic theme swells and the orchestra chases the lush violin line, Mycroft’s hand crosses the distance between them, sliding first over her wrist at a pulse point then grasping her hand. Alessandre never looks away from the orchestra but doesn't remove his hand.
“Be silent, both of you. Do not speak again until we are behind closed doors in The Stranger’s Room.”, Mycroft bites out.
In the small hours of the morning, he wakes again, “So Doc, I’m still here - they don’t think I’ll make it. What do you think, John?”
John takes a deep breath as he runs his hands over his face. Both Sherlock and John are surprised by a voice behind their bench, “Nicely done, Lieutenant. Shall we take your little Captain away to be shot for treason, or will you just leave him to Moran?”
Her family, in a burst of liberality between the wars, allowed her train as a nurse in London. Her sensibilities led her to rouge her knees; her beauty and love of danger drove her into the path of Jim Moriarty. But instead of prostituting Irene, Jim realised that her intellect would serve him far better as a madam, a dominatrix. Irene possessed an uncanny ability to observe and discern anyone's darkest desire or fondest wish.
“So you say….so you may even believe….so I thought, once too. But I was wrong, and so are you. Eh? You are...
John laughs, “Yes, Mycroft - it did. I wanted to take comfort...to shelter from the storm with James, as we are both invalided - he would not let me. James reminded me that - as far as we knew - Sherlock was still out there, somewhere in the world,” John shakes his head, “James forced me to get well so that I could find him, even if Sherlock doesn’t feel the same - I need to hear it, from him. I didn’t simply ‘have a regard’ for your brother - I loved him...love him.”
Sherlock frowns, then the fog lifts and he smiles broadly, “On the contrary, Mycroft. Moriarty clearly wants us to ‘clean up’ after him. He implicates the secretary and we try him or her for treason. But the secretary would have to be close to the actual pressure point, otherwise their value as a leading indicator would be limited. Don’t you see! Your Anthea would see increased volume in
“You have to hand it to Dr. Scott. Brilliant mathematician, gorgeous, she's apparently seduced your brother, and through all of the trauma of last night - she didn't seem thrown by any of it. Remarkably adaptable woman!”
“I suppose we shouldn’t get too accustomed to these luxurious digs. Forgive me for saying so, sir. But you need to get some rest too.”
“Mr. Holmes….Sherlock. I'd happily tell you my story but a game of deduction might help settle you down enough to kindly FOCUS.”
“John was injured! His injuries clearly encompass his dominant hand - you can tell from the shaky handwriting. John was hurt and I wasn’t there,” Sherlock tears at his hair.
“No - you were hoping that he liked you” Irene eyes Jim speculatively. “I can tell you the truth, Jim. Maybe I’m the last one who can...where
As dinner progresses - Mycroft finds himself considering a seduction, a train of thought that alarms him to no end. His mission was to broker an arranged marriage between Crown and Country and the American professor, not to be taken in his own trap. Still, they discuss everything from advanced mathematics to Sibelius's symphony that they are about to attend.
Sorry, we've gone so long without an update - but I haven't abandoned fic! Just...plot is so much harder than porn. :)
Sherlock strips away John’s uniform, then his own. Their bodies slot together as though they were long-time lovers, their lips entwined, hands blindly grasping as they slowly rocked into each other - feeling pleasure build and crest again and again until dawn steals across their twisted sheets. In the early dawn hours, many promises are whispered - but there is nothing sure about life in war time. And both men know it.
So  - John finds himself in Tottenham Court Road, limping along towards the British Museum. He seems completely unconscious of where his legs lead him until he is standing outside of Sherlock’s door.
“Quite, Capt. Watson. Now, if you both would be so kind as to come with me. There is a matter of security clearance which we must quickly address.  I wouldn’t try walking away, regrettably, the snipers have their orders. Come now - we will maintain the fiction that I am merely here to take Lt. Holmes and his new….”, Mycroft smirked, “...
“James - it isn’t as though there is aught for me on the outside, either. I can’t sew anyone up with these hands,” John thrusts his shaking hands under James' nose. John pauses, thinking, “It’s all well to judge, isn’t it? That’s what you are telling me.”
“And I, you. More than you know. More than I thought possible just a week ago,” Sherlock holds John’s hat as the cab waits below, “You
“Bullshit, James...Do you really think so poorly of me, that your scars would put me off? And if you have your scars, well - so do I,” John grasps the Major’s hand.
John tries to follow Sherlock, but the tide of humanity pushing in the opposite direction takes him into the Tube station at Piccadilly Circus. From there, he takes the underground to Marble Arch, changing lines at Bond Street and by the time he climbs from the station, the All Clear sirens wail. He settles down on his bed, hopeful for a decent night’s sleep - uninterrupted by dreams of Sherlock or air raid sirens and the Luftwaffe. As he lays between the hotel’s starched white sheets, he replays their conversation again.
Sherlock knows that tone will brook no argument, and so he yields. He stands in front of John - the air is heavy with the weight of all that remains unsaid between them - and memorises every line of John Watson’s face.
Dr. Scott's return prompts Sherlock's jealousy to boil over, but John Watson is no one's whipping boy.
Thanks for the kudos and comments (they keep me going) - I am considering making a Sherlock Holmes and John Watson AU series - Across Every Universe, because - for me - there isn't a universe where these two don't somehow fall in love (though, perhaps there are a few where they can't make it work).
Mycroft Holmes is so rarely surprised that he says nothing at all. Anthea takes the lack of response for consent and amends the workers’ orders.
solidified - but he or she knew when Overlord planning was ‘heating up’. If you say that Overlord strategy
This pulls Sherlock up short - he had pushed John out of his mind after seeing him leave Rainbow Corner, wrapped in Helen’s arms. “If he even goes to Montague Street, which I doubt, he has a key. When last I saw him, he was quite...taken up with Miss O’Connell.”
As always - the kudos and comments give me life - and get me back here, writing - just that much faster, so thank you!!!
“Captain Watson, you have been granted an overnight leave - pending your final discharge paperwork, sir - you might want to go up to London and...arrange your affairs?”
The black sedan rolls quietly down High Street, reflecting street lights and illuminating the fog that follows the rain on a cold October evening. It stops in front of an unassuming section of a wall in the old college - by a dark wooden door. A tall man unfolds himself and his umbrella from the back seat and knocks twice. The porter looks surprised - “Good evening, Mr. Holmes. Will you be dining in college tonight, Sir?”
The four stare at each other, only Alessandre is entirely self-possessed. There is a knock at the door. Mycroft draws his gun.
“I think I saw ice cream? It’s the Americans - they are hard on feed, didn’t you notice?”, John tucks into his plate - the last time he had eaten so well, a certain Naval Lieutenant was his only messmate. If it is possible to chew pensively, John Watson does.
“No need, Gregory - here I am, Mr. Holmes.” A tall woman emerges from the darkness, wearing an a midnight blue evening gown and wrap. Her jet black, short hair frames a pale face, and wide eyes - so dark, they could be blue or black or any colour in between. Mycroft smiles - the smile even reaches his eyes - shakes hands and offers his arm to conduct her into the waiting car.
Sherlock sighs, tilting his head and considering, “An affectionate note to yourself...and your ‘overlords’. ‘Secretaries - they know everything’ - or so he said”.
"Sherlock, are Northern mining practices really pillow-talk between you? Capt. Watson is more exceptional than I allowed - exceptionally what, I won't venture to say."
Thank you for all who read and especially to those who commented, I love interacting with readers and I appreciate all of the encouragement.
Mycroft  rubs away the frown from between his brows. There is no one on Admiral Cunningham’s staff that could be called into question. Sherlock must be wrong - admittedly, a rare occurrence  -  but not an impossible one. Mycroft considers whether it would be better to shelve the Overlord plans or deal with the fallout of withholding intelligence. It’s a horrible decision to make - and pointless either way - sort of like choosing the calibre of the bullet for your own firing squad. As Mycroft ponders, Sherlock hurtles through the door.
John lay down on top of him, gingerly this time, shifting to accommodate their sensitivity and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s chest. John said, “I’m sorry love, that went way too quickly. I had such plans,” he said sadly. They lay there, sated and nuzzling against each other. After a few minutes, Sherlock said, “John. I want to hold you.” John hummed.
John sat back with his arms crossed, thoroughly pleased with himself. “Just give up, Sherlock. Not even you will be able to figure it out.”
Somehow Sherlock managed to give him a scathing look out of just the corner of his eye but begrudgingly he said, “Yes, Captain.” He swirled himself and his coat out of the flat. Before he got to the front door, John stopped him. “I want to see if we can take Mrs Hudson to dinner tonight. She fed us for the last 4 days. Go hail us a cab.” Sherlock huffed, while John negotiated time and place.
“What do you mean, did I want to stay clean, of course I did, I wouldn’t have tried if I hadn’t wanted to, I just failed, that’s all.” he protested rapidly and half-heartedly.
Mickey said, “That’s the clinch. It’s called the clinch. Normal part of a bout." Mickey gave him a sidelong glance. The bell rang surprisingly quickly and Sherlock returned to his corner and Jack, who got very busy with his hands. All over Sherlock. John decided the safest strategy was not to look. He chatted with Mickey, asking questions about the gym, gossiping about common acquaintances.
The exhaustion hit John suddenly and Sherlock felt him drifting away. He considered retrieving a wet flannel from the loo, but his own exhaustion dissuaded him. He groped around for the shirt that John had so helpfully placed on the bed. He softly wiped him clean of lube and come and then did the same for himself. When he was finished, he tossed the shirt into the corner. He sprawled across John, laying tiny kisses everywhere he could reach. The last one brushed his temple, then he whispered in his ear, “I’m your idiot, though, aren’t I?”
Indignation in his tone, he said, “Really, John. It’s not that unbelievable, is it? I do make you breakfast on occasion. Periodically. Sporadically.” As soon as he put the tray on the night table, John grabbed him and pulled him on top of him. Sherlock put up half-hearted resistance.
“You’re always fussing,” he grumbled out of a sense of duty to maintain his curmudgeonly status. John’s fussing was actually honey on his tongue.
John shifted his concentration to the slit of Sherlock’s cock and alternated between broad swipes and tiny pointed licks with the very tip of his tongue. The fingertips of his right hand traveled lightly over Sherlock’s arse and he laid the other on the front of Sherlock’s thigh. He gripped the base of his cock as he opened his mouth and lowered his head to take as much of him in as he could. “Aaah!” Sherlock’s hips jerked forward and John let him in deeper. As soon as Sherlock gave him room, he slowly bobbed his head up and down. He alternated between sliding his tongue along the bottom and sucking gently as he moved up and down. He had a lovely rhythm going when all of a sudden, Sherlock grabbed his hair and pulled him off. “Stop.”
He scooped up some of the ointment and began to work it into Sherlock’s rear. When he tensed up at the first touch, John put his hand on the small of his back, trying to soothe him a bit. It helped and Sherlock breathed deeply and started to relax. He let out a couple of groans but John couldn’t tell if they indicated pain or pleasure. He steadily moved his fingers in circular patterns moving from right to left and shifting as necessary to cover all the colored areas. He spent extra time on his sit spots, which were, to be honest, leaning more towards red than pink. He made a mental note to avoid them during the next go-round. “Do you think you could tolerate a cold pack?” he asked. There was no answer and John heard the even breathing that meant that Sherlock had fallen back to sleep again. John kissed him in the dip between his back and hip and left him to pass the time free of pain. The more time he was sleeping during this period, the easier it would be for both of them.
Sherlock glared at John then and stuck his hand out for the folder yet again. This time, John handed it over. Sherlock opened it and was transported immediately. He took the papers out, and absentmindedly held the folder out to the side and John took it from him. He put the pages down on the desk, fanned them out and handed some to John. He walked to Lestrade’s bulletin board and stuck some up with pins and whipped up a snowstorm of paper around the room. Then he got to the photos. Lestrade and John stepped back and let him work his magic. He ordered and reordered and sorted and picked then up again. He picked up one of the stacks, flipped and reordered it and then shouted, “Oh. Oh. Of course! Take me there. Now!” He turned looking at the two of them in disbelief, projecting wordlessly:
John was soberly looking down assessing Sherlock’s readiness, and said, “Hold still. I want to stretch with one more finger, I don’t want to --”
Sherlock went to him and settled onto his knees and said, “I’m, uh, sorry about the, uh, well,” and pointed between his legs where he was halfway to a decent erection. John shrugged and said, “It’s to be expected. It’s been four days. I’m not far behind you. Just make sure to situate yourself…precisely, shall we say,” and he shifted on the chair. Sherlock leered and draped himself, precisely, dragging his stiffening cock over John’s thigh.
John signed his name at the bottom of the page with his tightly curled penmanship and handed Sherlock the pen. His signature contained many fewer flourishes than usual. Sherlock started to hand the paper back to John, but he gestured with his chin towards the fireplace. Sherlock walked over and prised the dagger from the Cluedo board pinned against the wall. He folded it and slid it onto the bookshelf between Chemical Analysis of Asiatic Soil Samples and John’s copy of “Top Gear’s Jags and Porsches”. He stabbed the contract deep into the mantel.
John went and got dressed, rubbing a little liniment into his shoulders beforehand. They would be getting more of a workout this evening and he didn’t want to stiffen up. When he got downstairs, he was surprised to see his place at the table set formally with a placemat, linen napkin, good silver and wineglass. There was even a single candlestick right in front of the fine china plate that had been part of a wedding gift from one of Sherlock’s more clueless relatives. John gazed at him with a pleased look on his face, but Sherlock, brushed it away, looking down and trying to cover his embarrassment. “You were taking too long and I didn’t have anything else to do.” After a moment he looked up, slightly worried. “I wasn’t trying to make it romantic or anything. Just trying to be…”
Sherlock was stunned into silence. His mouth in a perfect circle, he turned to look at John. Then with a huff of irritation, he said, “You’re right John! How could I have missed that? How could you have understood that before I have?” Frowning, John looked around to see if they were in view of anyone, then he pinched him on the arse.
Mycroft remained silent for a moment and then stood. “Indeed. Thank you for the tea, John,” he said, having tasted no more than his first sip. “And congratulations, Little Brother.” They both looked at him curiously and he clarified, “Day 50, is it not?” He left.
John slammed his mug down on the table and shouted back. “Your body, Sherlock! Where was your body?”
John hurried Sherlock through the squad room to minimize the number of insulting deductions and they presented themselves at Lestrade’s desk. He didn’t lift his head from his paperwork and forgoing a greeting, spoke directly to John. “I’m not gonna fight with him about lunch, so I hope you fed him. And if you’re not here by 4, I’m leavin’ him in a cell wrapped in a jacket.”
Kissing his forehead before he slid out of the bed, John stripped his shirt off and tossed it into the corner. He hurried to the kitchen and returned to the bedroom within two minutes, but Sherlock had already fallen asleep. John rubbed his shoulders and dug his thumbs into the tight muscles around his scapulae to rouse him. He absolutely had to cool his arse off, but shocking him out of a doze would be counterproductive.
“I never actually considered that John. I’m sure I’ve been…an embarrassment to him on at least a few occasions—“
“Ow, alright I am sorry. I shouldn’t have said that.” His eyebrows furrowed and his already somewhat creaky morning voice lowered in pitch and volume. “It’s just that you’ve kept me clean for 46 days now and,” he took a deep breath, “I’m afraid.”
Fortunately for the moment Sherlock was asleep as he normally would be at 7 in the morning. It was a brilliant fall day with sunshine as crisp as the temperature. That was not going to help. It was easier to get him out of bed on a grey London morning.
John leaned over and whispered into Sherlock’s ear, “Are you waking up my sleeping beauty?” giving the lobe a tiny nibble. He was gratified by a low grumble coming from deep in Sherlock’s chest. He pried off his limbs reluctantly and untangled the sheets. (Sherlock was always tangled in the sheets.) He pushed on his shoulder so that he was flat on his back and straddled him. He slid his hands down over Sherlock’s collarbones, and paused at his nipples to give them some attention on the way, just the lightest of circling strokes. Against his back, he could feel that Sherlock had now attained his usual morning erection. Already halfway there, he thought. Sherlock grumbled some more.
John pulled away and tried to catch his breath. He shook his head sadly. “I’m afraid we’re not going to be able to go as slowly as I would have liked.”
The water in the shower, and John, cooled off simultaneously and he dried off thinking happily that the punishment would be over soon. He was not worried in the slightest that his morning wanks would detract from the eventual celebratory downpour that would end the five-day drought. He couldn’t wait to get his hands, mouth, cock on him. Or in him. Or both. When he opened the door, he was startled to see Sherlock standing waiting for him. “You took too long. I got lonely,” he pouted. John smiled and gave him a kiss. “Well, I’m here now. Did you let the toast burn? Let’s go eat.”
Sherlock sat up, crossed his arms over his chest and his glare slid into his pout, complete with lower lip extension.
John blew his own breath onto Sherlock’s rosy pink bud. Frustrated with the restriction of the trousers around Sherlock’s knees, he stepped back and pulled them off. He dove back and licked right up to the dripping head of his cock, where he swirled his tongue around lazily. He made the lewd, wet noises that brought a beautiful blush to Sherlock’s cheeks. From there, he slurped sideways from the tip back down to Sherlock’s puckered hole. Sherlock lifted his head to watch and John met his eyes with a wicked grin, sticking out his tongue as far as it would go and swiping around in hot, wet circles. Sherlock’s face was a bright red by now and he slammed his head back down on the table in agonized bliss. The poor table let out another creak. Or was it a crack? Sherlock groaned, “John, please, now, now, now…” John shoved his own trousers and pants back down again, shook one foot, then the other and stepped out of them. He pushed on the backs of Sherlock’s thighs, exposing him completely.
John had warned Lestrade not to disturb them. He knew they had to head back to NSY to give their statements, but he wouldn’t wake Sherlock until he’d had his full fourteen hours of post-case sleep. He was fairly certain that Sherlock would want to go to the lab to confirm the variation in the chemical composition of lipstick something, something, profile and how it compared to the spectroscopic analysis something, something, which he’d unsuccessfully tried to explain to the two of them. Molly would understand and happily indulge his endless soliloquy. As he drifted off, John listened fondly from a distance:
“Ok, love, you’re going to have to listen very carefully to this one. It may be too hard for you,” he teased. John slid his thumb inside the band of his pants, stretched it out away from his tight waist and let it snap. “What does that sound like, Sherlock?” Back to his ear, “Hmm?”
“Two years, 3 months and twenty-two days.” He looked at John a bit desperately. “But I wasn’t always an addict! Most of the time I just used casually.” He gestured casually with his six inch fingers. “Here and there.” John’s mouth was slightly open, his own cup was frozen three inches above the saucer.
, “Ring rats are the girls who follow the wrestling stars around, trying to get a leg over. Kasseem’s not the type,” he said teasingly. “He prefers boxers, don’t you Kasseem?”
Sherlock looked seductively over his shoulder as he zipped them up and lowered his voice an octave. “I will keep that in mind, Doctor.” John’s cock twitched and he forced himself to think of Mycroft.
The tickling brought up goosebumps on the skin of Sherlock’s hip and John teased the fine hair with his fingertips. He outlined the shell of Sherlock’s ear, brushed his lips over his temple, and then lowered his knees to the floor. He had denied himself even a look for the last four days and he felt like he was coming home. His hands met lightly around Sherlock’s back. He looked up to watch his face as he laid his forearms across the backs of his thighs. He held his arse, surely and confidently enough so that Sherlock knew he was owned, possessed, being handled by an expert.
John swallowed, actively sweating and trembling now, and reached down into his denims for the pills and for a moment he considered the vial in his other pocket, but Mycroft had said it should only be taken in emergencies. So, the pills it was then.
“I had a thought, actually,” Andrew ran a large hand through Sherlock’s limp curls until he gripped the hair at the crown of his head, pulling it backwards until Sherlock gasped in pain. With Sherlock’s neck and collarbone exposed, John could clearly see several lacerations, presumably made with Andrew’s knife, angry and seeping blood onto Sherlock’s once crisp white shirt. “I thought maybe I’d let you come, kill you, and continue to have my fun with your Alpha here. I might not have heats anymore, but I can still satisfy an Alpha in rut.”
. Furthermore, the preliminary pathology report on Ms. Orr found fibres linking her death to Terry Fanning. The Crown Prosecutors are also likely to pursue charges additional charges against Dr Sylvan for complicity in her murder.” Her voice broke over the line, and then, “I’ve another call John, I need to take it.”
“Sherlock, we need to figure out what we’re going to do before the blocker wears off, but I can’t think clearly with you stalking around like that. Whatever it is you’re doing to try and gear down is clearly not working so, umm, lets see if we can distract you. ” He kept his voice as gentle and neutral as possible, drying his hands on a sunny gingham hand-towel he found hanging by the sink.
Sherlock managed to look rather gratified with John’s concurrence. He stopped his pacing, his breathing regular but his dark curls falling limply to his forehead with the exertion.
*That is what I thought it meant when I first read the title, but in the context of this fic that would mean either:
After a long moment, Sherlock relaxed into the kiss and emitted a satisfied sigh, cradling John’s face in his big hands while running each thumb against the stubble of his skin. It was a tender kiss, a gentle affirmation that they were both alive and finally safe, both from those that would do them harm, and even themselves.
Based on the length of John’s trips we can conclude Harlan was most likely being held on remand at either Pentonville or Wormwood Scrubs.
Then she was off, skipping down the pavements like a half-remembered dream, her skewed baseball cap letting her ponytail flap about in the wind.
Neither Sherlock nor John were sure how she managed to make her way into his room, hospital rules being what they were, but John supposed they must have made special allowances for bonded pairs. It was common for the spouse or partner to be present whilst their love was actively dying, and even though Lisa suffered from her own serious wounds, he wouldn’t put it past her to scream, needle, or cajole the staff into getting her way. Injured or no, Lisa always
Yet, to his utter dismay, and no small amount of horror, he found no comfort between the soft, expensive sheets. The duvet was too heavy, the walls too close, and his mind only whirled and whirled, a veritable reel of unchecked anxiety. Sherlock. Sherlock.
John boldly walked up behind Sherlock, hoping against hope they wouldn’t have to resort to more desperate measures, and pressed his body flush against his. He felt Sherlock’s muscles vibrating with tension, and at this proximity the ‘volume’ of his distress was emotionally deafening. With careful fingers he reached up and began to stroke gently through Sherlock’s hair, the other arm wrapping protectively against his waist.
John!” Now, the real pacing began. Sherlock spun and stalked across the kitchen, the leather soles of his shoes thumping on the floor like a heartbeat. “If Rexfield hurt her somehow, and Harlan killed him, the end result would be the same - Harlan would go to jail and likely get a more lenient sentence considering someone assaulted his bonded mate. Why ‘fake’ her death? And poorly at that, it’s not like she’s been keeping a low profile.” He paused once, levelling John with a steady glare as he turned his shoulder towards him.
which clearly states that “Alphas and Omegas make up a meagre 10% of the world's entire population.”
“Oh, don’t be like that. I’m just trying to have a bit of conversation now,  since we’ve got all this extra time.” Andrew continued, rolling his neck and shoulders. He leant down towards Sherlock, wiping the knife clean on his Belstaff.
While there are reputable studies showing that true polar wander has occurred at various times in the past, the rates are much smaller (1° per million years or slower) than predicted by the pole shift hypothesis (up to 1° per thousand years. Analysis of the evidence does not lend credence to Hapgood's hypothesized rapid displacement of layers of the Earth. Data indicate that the geographical poles have not deviated by more than about 5° over the last 130 million years, contradicting the hypothesis of a cataclysmic polar wander event. More rapid past possible occurrences of true polar wander have been measured: from 790 to 810 million years ago, true polar wander of approximately 55° may have occurred twice. There is no physical evidence of more rapid shifts occurring at any point during Earth's history.”
"I told you. I value what we have more than I value my comfort. I can endure anything if I know he'll be better for it in the end." John explained, feeling something sort of fracture inside of him at the actual formation of the words he had so long suppressed.
John is bi, he had experience with men before. When think about blow-jobs he says: “He had given just a scant few of these in his lifetime.”
“I dunno.” She shrugged, with another pop of her gum. “Since Harla - since everything happened, I think...maybe social work? Maybe specialize in Omegaverse? There are so few of us, and half the time we’re exploited or stared at like a bunch of freaks. I thought maybe uni…?” She peered up at John from under the brim of her cap, face open and young, perhaps seeking his advice or maybe even his encouragement.
John was unsurprised, and with an amused, long-suffering sigh, he squared his shoulders and followed Sherlock down the hall and out of that cursed house.
John smiled, dipping down to run his tongue against the sinfully crafted flesh along Sherlock’s neck. He blew softly afterwards, watching as Sherlock shivered and rolled his eyes upwards.
In response, Sherlock growled low and dangerous, never loosening his desirous grip on John’s neck, and began taking him with ferocious abandon, back curved in a tight arc, covering John’s body protectively with his own. Every powerful, deep thrust of his hips elicited a staggering jolt of bliss across John’s nerves.
John always wondered why people insisted on introducing themselves in this day and age, as if Chesney’s name wasn’t bright and clear on the mobile screen.
iii ) If  Lisa did fake her own death she is doing a terrible job of it just walking around using her name.  For the plan to work should would have to assume no one would tell Harlan including his lawyer…
As requested by Oleta, here are the notes in text form for anyone who had trouble seeing the graphics on their web browser.
He must have, he remembered, vaguely, a man, a tall man gently pushing him away and offering him words of comfort while John sobbed and prostrated himself on the floor, naked somehow and on his hands and knees with his glistening and oozing backside angled obscenely in the cool air, hands and nails pulling tufts of that hateful carpeting from its stitching against the floor...the soft floor, exhilarating and coarse, and he rubbed his face against it, wishing it was beard burn from his Alpha, until he was cautiously, bodily lifted and forced to drink blissfully cool water with a few more sweet pills, and situated back on that wretched bed.
He realized Sherlock had spent the better part of a day drugged and locked in a room regularly used to hold captured Omegas. The combined miasma of years of misery and terror would have been profoundly distressing for an experienced Alpha, but for an un-bonded Alpha in the midst of his first rut, it was probably devastating. Not to mention the hints of John’s own scent he must have caught every once in a while, since they had somehow ended up in such close physical proximity to each other after Sherlock’s abduction.
“Oh God, he wasn’t in heat was he?” John burst out, a rising stab of hot jealousy pulsing within him to battle uncomfortably with the icy terror in the pit of his stomach. It was ridiculous, he knew, to feel this way but...but he couldn’t
"I don't know. It had a cobble-stone garden with Shasta daisies and bird feeders, but our house-guard Terry only let us look out from the windows in the sun room, so I never saw anything except the garden. The car windows were tinted, but I think they took me to the upper--"
We hope this resonates with you, and that you all realize this was crafted with love and reverence to the original material. We did the best we could, and I happen to think that was pretty darn good! If you don't like the ending, or feel that it didn't fit with the tone of the original story, then c'est la vie.
Several days after their bonding, when Sherlock and John both decided some much welcome time off was needed, they received a call from Chesney. Both men were laid out on Sherlock’s larger-than-necessary-but-absolutely-luxurious bed at Baker Street, John reading the latest in a series of crime novels Sherlock had demonstrably claimed was ‘a deplorable excuse for fiction,’ and ‘so transparent even an eight month old could figure it out.’
“Remember Timothy,” Mycroft intoned as he pulled a prescription bottle and a small vial of clear liquid out of a hidden pocket in his suit jacket, “full disclosure.”
John sighed from deep in his cramping belly, more cryptic nonsense, as per usual. “Can’t say that I have.”
If we look at the 853,869 Omegaverse individuals in more detail, we can make the conservative estimate that by the age of 30 most of the people who were born Omegaverse would have presented. Per the census data, 62.5% of the population of the United Kingdom is 30 years old and older, so if we assume that the age distribution in Omegaverse individuals is the same as in the human population, then we can infer that approximately 62.5% of the 853,869 Omegaverse individuals living in London would have already presented their secondary gender; this works out to approximately 533,668 Alphas/Omegas.
This makes make more sense to me as the theme of this story is they are discovering things that were always there
His heart in his throat, John gripped the doorknob and carefully opened the door. Even without Sherlock’s charged emotions blaring through him like a klaxon, one look at the room and John knew they were in trouble.
John counted the next eight hours as possibly the worst of his life, and that was no small feat considering what he’d just endured. He tried to find something moderately useful to do, but only ended up pacing in the front parlor, engaging in pointless small talk, and compulsively checking his phone for any news. Eventually, he bullied himself into at least attempting to lie down and rest. He didn’t want to be
and then I knew he was not coming back to me. So I am giving you three hours. Three hours to suffer before I kill him. Every minute you will know that
He closed his eyes, feeling his heartache swell to unbearable proportions. In his mind’s eye, he could see the bright little flower beds in the shadow of the church, swaying untroubled in the breeze.
Andrew. John cursed inwardly, hoping it was only the two of them left. He was not sure how much longer his luck would hold.
“Lestrade called last night, said the court date for Lysander, or ah - whatever his name actually is, is set for three months from now. Sherlock and I will be there. I expect they’ll want Lisa to testify, have they called you?”
“The NAOD is online, all the sordid details are there for everyone to see if they are interested enough.” Then he continued on in his pacing, tearing across the room and looking immensely pleased with himself.
The two men stood in the doorway, wayward witnesses to the emotional breakdown of a tortured woman, little more than a girl really, as she curled over her bonded and dissolved into a body-wracking torrent of sobs.
It was only the work of a moment. As soon as he spied a figure turning the corner, John lunged forward and grabbed the unknown man by his dirty jumper. With his left hand still clenched full of earth, John stuffed the man’s surprised and gaping mouth full of dirt and grass before he even had a chance to think about screaming. Then, with a quick change in momentum, he swung him around in a vicious arc, making sure his face collided full force into the limestone wall. The resulting crunch of bone on stone was visceral, and satisfying. Most of all, it was
“Alright,” John began, his tone cold and forceful, “I don’t have time to fuck around. I need another syringe, 5ml or 3ml if you have it. If it’s necessary, I will call Mycroft Holmes back
“Exactly, John. So now we have one murdered Alpha and Lisa and Harlan are in an awful position. The network was Lisa’s, if she went prison, then no one would be able to help the Omegas. So, he sacrifices himself to save her and let her continue her work.” Sherlock sat down in the chair next to John, a cheap wooden thing that creaked at the movement.
It didn’t take long for John to use a small alcohol wipe, also provided by the anonymous suited man, to disinfect the top of the vial and plunge the needle through the rubber top, drawing up 2ml of clear liquid. He already knew what the recommended dosage was, but what he didn't know was how much benzodiazepine was still in his system. He decided he didn’t much care and unceremoniously plunged the needle into the top of his thigh, depressing it quickly until all the liquid was gone. He grunted as he massaged the injection site, knowing the vastus lateralis was the easiest and best location for self-administered intramuscular injections. Now, all he needed was time, fifteen minutes or so - maybe a bit longer.
killed Rexfield, or, maybe he was wrong and was just theorizing ahead of the data. The truth was, either way Harlan wanted to set her free - from jail or from the bond. Maybe in the end it was the same thing.
The young man in the suit stared at John throughout the entire ordeal, offering no help but blatantly ogling his exposed groin until John shot him a look that sent him scurrying for the hallway in alarm. After that, John pulled up his denims and pocketed the megestrol acetate once more. He didn’t bother with pants.
. His dignity, his humanity, and now, perhaps even Sherlock. He couldn’t help but think back to his last visit to the detention centre, when Harlan had asked him how he thought
John managed to raise his head slightly, peering at the man through tear stung eyes, frustration colouring his voice. “You – you knew him, your mate, before? You were friends when…it all happened?” John raised his head higher, his expression full of confusion and possibly, hope.
Sherlock didn’t respond, only shifted away from John until he was more on his back, gazing at him with questioning but openly fond eyes.
John asked to be shown to the bathroom right away, he tottered stiff legged through the doorway, which was mildly embarassing since he was sporting a rampant erection and didn’t have any means to hide it or save what was left of his dignity. Not to mention that for some reason he felt an inexplicable urge to move his bowels, but instead, he passed a small glob of blood-tinged mucous. This was new and frankly bizarre, but it wasn’t exactly uncomfortable, it just felt...wet, warm, and viscous. Through the drugs and growing fizzing in his brain he realized with grim acceptance that his vaginal channel must have lengthened by now, exposing his cervix and completely blocking off his rectum from his descending colon. Wonderful. His heat had really, truly, begun.
Bill stretches down from the upper bunk to touch John’s shoulder, “Sing us a song, then?”. He turns to stare at the ceiling as John quietly sings “White Cliffs of Dover” as though it were a lullaby.
“You’re back. Irene is a bit far from her nursing training, it’s true. And again - I don’t know that she was ever working with pure, uncut heroin during her extended Florence Nightingale schtick”, Jim laughs. He plays with Sherlock’s lank, messy curls, “But as long as she didn’t kill you, I could wait - after all - from here on out, it’s you and me-eeee”, he sing-songs.
“Don’t make me cross, Cap’t. We’ve spoken often enough - do you much fancy moving in with your blessed sister? Because I don’t think this war would stand an expansion on the home front. But - judging from your letters and her visit - I give you one week before you try to re-enlist if you elect to live with Harriet.”
Mycroft has bought more time - but he fears it will not be nearly enough to extract his brother while the Normandy Invasion rages around them.
Sherlock abandons intelligence gathering with Moran and makes his way down onto the dance floor. He sees John return, the conquering hero, to the table where his men have gathered. Other well-wishers (mostly British or female or both) are winding their way to congratulate him. He has a pretty brunette hanging off of his elbow, and Corporal Douglass patting his arm. Sherlock is about to abandon hope of coming anywhere near him, when John politely breaks for the loo. Sherlock follows.
“I thought you might enjoy the Japanese gallery, so I took the liberty of closing it to visitors so we could tour.”
“Only until I resolve the leak, with your assistance, of course - and can find suitable accommodation for Professor Scott.”
“No. But the Holmes brothers’ constant squabbling is starting to do so.”, Alessandre stretches like a cat.
Moran is dead by morning, John slips his tags into his pocket and prepares to move out in 47 Commando.
John stands across the street from Sherlock’s flat...again. Despite his limp, he has walked the length of this block more than ten times, trying to puzzle out what awaits him behind the door of 221B Baker Street. The one unimpeachable method to discern this small truth - to walk through the door and face whatever lies behind it - John has repeatedly discarded. Uncertainty is better than death, perhaps? John leans against the doorframe, unsure of which outcome would be preferred. Perhaps Sherlock only wants a flatmate - feels a sense of responsibility or guilt towards John? Or maybe Sherlock simply forgot John was there - he cared so little for John’s presence beyond confirming the cause of death? And why should any of it matter? It’s a flatshare, isn’t it?  A man who volunteered to storm the beaches of Normandy with Marine Commandos should not fear discussing a flatshare.
Surely my own brother has the necessary intellectual wherewithal to carry out what should have been an exceedingly simple instruction,” Mycroft snaps.
“Hardly, this is my brother’s club. It has special security concerns, as His Majesty is also a member.”
Royal Marines 47 Commando were an integral part of the Normandy Invasion - liberating Port en Bessan - which would serve as a supply pipeline for the Allied Forces until Cherbourg was taken.
“I can’t tell you everything...I shouldn’t tell you anything, really. But - this affects you, you are being drawn into it. I won’t allow you to come to harm because I left you in the dark.”
Sherlock and John settle in for the first night of bedsharing in 221B, but the romance they discuss is most definitely not their own....
“I’ll put the new plan through General Strangeways - no sense in giving the game away, in case there is another double agent on the inside. That will work - the perfect diversion.”
“I am dying, Captain - and you have no where you need to be”, Moran speaks slowly, it is costing him a great effort to continue.
John returns to his command. Sherlock meets to debrief with Mycroft at the Diogenes Club, though he is shockingly late for tea.
Sherlock hangs his head but accepts the wisdom of Mycroft’s words. He picks up the letter, examining it for the thousandth time,“This was written in November - it implies there were others. Where?”
John stretches and flexes his left hand, nods sharply and executes an about-face and steps away. Before he’s taken more than three paces, he stops without turning back to Mycroft, “If he still feels something for me, as you say he did...then he needs me to heal, just as I need him. If you are keeping me from him, he will never forgive you once I find him. And I will find him, Mycroft,” John squares his shoulders, and walks away - never looking back.
“Ah yes, I am certain that dealing with a reeling addict is precisely the course of physical rehabilitation that the staff at Netley would recommend.”
The first time John realised was at the Pool. Moriarty strapped John into his vest personally. Jim was such an innocent looking man, but he made John’s skin crawl. When he approached Sherlock, John did not stop to analyse his reaction - he wrapped his arms around Jim’s neck, ready to die to keep Sherlock safe. Later - Moriarty had gone, Sherlock thanked John for risking his life and John attempted to deflect from the sentiment that he feared would never be returned. He made a joke about Sherlock ripping his clothes off in a darkened pool. But, Moriarty was still listening, and he wasn’t pleased. That exchange was all it took - an infinitesimally small hint of John’s feelings for Sherlock and the potential that Sherlock might have feelings for John - and before John could stand, the sniper sights lit up their hearts.
Thanks for all the feedback so far - only a few more chapters left...though it seems that every chapter in the outline splits before being posted, so ...
Irene laughs, without humour, “My dear boy - it’s immaterial to me. Jim wants you - and he will have you. Consider me your angel of mercy - at least this part, you enjoy.”
John Watson emerges from his bedroom looking dazed. “Sherlock, it's past midnight, I thought you were sleeping - what are you on about?”
“Well - you have many options, Mr Holmes - but every single one begins with my needle in your arm - so let’s begin”, Irene nods to Jeff, who holds Holmes' arm steady - and she injects the heroin. In a few moments, Holmes goes limp. The chauffeur bends to take his body to Moriarty.
We have entered the History Channel portion of the programme - just a little - Operation Fortitude was a real thing, and did get 'spiced up' in the way the story suggests (though, obviously, not by a Holmes, but rather by Gen. Strangeways).
“And, Mycroft, before you interrupt~of course I know you aren't really Foreign Office... your Mum is a mathematical genius. Your genius, however, is far more catholic - but of all possible agents they thought you might at least understand me and my worth - quite rightly as it turns out - you do.” The rapid fire conclusions wind down and Alessandre looks away. “Also, not once all evening did you leave me bored. That is...something.”
They enter what appears to be a servant’s kitchen. A thick coating of dust and grime reveals the house to be long-abandoned. They are still close to the water - but the dirty windows do not admit much daylight; Sherlock tries to make out a bit more of his surroundings when he is thrown haphazardly into a straight-backed chair and a flour-sack covers his head.
Corporal Harrow responds with alacrity, closing the door and standing close to Mycroft’s desk, “Priory - SH dosed, 2H - 1 repeat’..that is all that it says, Sir.”
“Then I think we should reserve you seeing all of me for when I’m fit to be seen. Let me take a bath, at least - my hair is filthy”, Sherlock speaks slowly, languidly. He can see that Moriarty has swallowed the bait - wanting to believe that Sherlock is preparing himself for Jim’s bed.
Tuesday rolls into Wednesday, then Thursday night, and John has not seen Sherlock or the American GI he absconded with at the club since Monday night. John waited until closing on Tuesday, hoping that Sherlock would appear in his dressing room so they could speak, but to no avail. Wednesday, John plucked up his courage to go to Sherlock’s flat on Montague Street, but there was no sign that Sherlock had been in since they left together on Monday. John waited as long as he could, then hurried Rainbow Corner so he had time to dress for the evening performance.
“I have a better idea. You think Andrew will be able to survive without his secretary? Get him working out of SHAEF instead of the Admiralty. And get all of the real plans out of the Admiralty - leave nothing to chance. We already have fake plans - codenamed Operation Fortitude - circulating about Gen. Montgomery - the second army - they are good, of course.  But he doesn’t really sell it, does he?”
“Quite. I didn’t expect you would agree to keep her, but she seems...uh..nice. How did you get rid of Mycroft so quickly?”
The Mount Royale Hotel (near Speaker's Corner) was where Major Glenn Miller stayed - and American GI's were given a list of available hotels because there were no flats left in London. It was hit by a V2 rocket in March of '45, but remained somewhat functional.
“Are you ready? This is where it gets….interesting. Oh - and will you tell your brother? Ah...Sherlock - Sherlock, I won’t even ask ‘did you miss me?’ - because I already know, I’ve always known - you miss me, no one else ever came close, did they? I’ll save you from the painfully ordinary,...my dear.”  (New Edits to This Chapter)
“Sherlock, Dr. Scott is missing. She went to the restroom, security footage cuts out for fifteen minutes, CCTV, everything. A staff door onto Montague Street was found propped.”
“Only that we are coming...that we haven’t been together for long, and that you are impossibly dear to me already.”
“I work for the..Admiralty. I’ve a flat near the British Museum. Come. You can’t leave me like this.” Sherlock’s smile is equal parts debauched and wicked. John already feels the impossibility of saying no to this remarkable man.
Mycroft gives John an appraising glance, “You wrote - but only what you could send through the military censors.”
London during the blackouts is otherworldly. Few people are out, and those who are focus intensely on navigating the darkened streets. Illumination is transient - the occasional directional lantern and the headlamps of passing automobiles. John follows Sherlock’s certainty and unerring sense of direction. Several blocks away from Montague Street, they realise that nothing prevents them from holding hands.  No one would see it, and those who did might think that they were guiding each other. Their hands slip together, the furtive twining of fingers and palms is a potent messenger of desire, even when covered by shadow.
“Mr Holmes - I will be needing your arm”, Irene slides Sherlock’s shirt cuff back, swabbing the vein with alcohol, “Well - I suspected this might be difficult. You weren’t always careful, were you?”
“No, no. I am a soldier. I get orders and I march. We don’t ever get to ask ‘why’ - I understand that. Just….are you going to be….seducing Moran?”
John, ultimately fed up with the silent argument between the Holmes brothers, takes the bag off Anthea and turns to Alessandre.
“Not a code breaker - but codes are math, so it's not beyond my powers. I'm not sure about anybody's interest, moreover-I doubt it is relevant.”
“Thank you - cobblestones and medieval pavers are murder in high heels.” Alessandre Scott  - the world renowned American mathematician - smiles teasingly up at Mycroft with perfect cupid bow lips, painted crimson.
“Jesus, Holmes - I don’t either, but we must stop. This isn’t where...oh, do that again....this isn’t the right time or place for all I want to do with you. Not to mention, the loo is going to be overrun with servicemen when this song ends.”
During WWII in the UK, there were two 'spy' agencies: the SIS - Secret Intelligence Service and the SOE - Special Operations Executive. Mycroft is the shadow head of both in this story, but his brother is SOE.  IRL, the SOE's nickname was
“Mycroft, don’t fuss. He consented...although perhaps he had a different idea of what he was getting into. Remind me - is attempting to sodomize patients in the linen cupboard a standard therapeutic practice or will Mr Rocher potentially be facing disciplinary action if our little escapade became widely known?  I assure you, he is safe - as long as he doesn’t fall off the bed,” Sherlock grins as he steepled his fingers, pressing them against his lips.
John and Sherlock pretend nothing happened, Mycroft confronts his brother about sentiment, while confessing his own. An unexpected package will disrupt all plans.
Sherlock reverently places the hat on John’s head; John straightens it - and with a quick salute, shoulders his bag and returns to his battalion, his men, and his orders to move up with the 2nd Army to Portsmouth.
“The scars on the outside are enough to fright the birds off their branches - but I’m not so vain as all that. But - I’ve only ever been a soldier, and - truth be told - I am not entirely sure how to fit back into a world where nobody is calling me Major,” James shakes his head.
“Her Majesty’s Foreign Office would like to  extend its official welcome, Professor. I hope you don’t mind, I took the liberty of planning a quick dinner before the concert? Just the two of us - nothing formal?”
James snorts, then speaks in a low whisper, “You always turned my head, John. That has not changed, but I have.”
“You will be the death of me - ok, yes, I’ll come. Whisht, now. First, we have to escape this WC and the rest of my platoon.”
“You are sure that is the reason? It's not just coincidence that she was with him? Or linked to her arrival in London versus Oxford?”
“And yet, here we are,” Mycroft examines John thoroughly as John tries to look past Mycroft into the flat, “He isn’t here, Captain.”
James pulls himself together first, “That’s enough, Captain. At any rate, John - I rather thought you fancied Navy whites nowadays?”
“He is.  Well, I’m in his command. I’ve been sheltered from his..ah...attentions by my Major. Will you be...Oh! No wait…Holmes...Sherlock.” John cups Sherlock’s jaw with both hands and forces him to meet his eyes, “The way you two were looking at each other...will I be getting in the middle of something?”
“Immaterial - He…,” Sherlock swallows, thinking of Moriarty’s snipers trained on John as he performed, “This...dalliance with John has been diverting, of course, but there is no room for that with The Work. Moriarty is playing an elaborate game - and I won’t be distracted again.”
“Sherlock, this is why I fight. I won’t leave my men, I won’t abandon my post because it’s become dangerous - I signed up for dangerous. Moran has a war to win - he can’t afford to nurse personal grudges.”
“She can take Dr. Watson’s room - you two could share your bed if you intend to sleep at all, which I consider unlikely, since we are also bringing you a case.”
“Sherlock. I can bring in skilled nursing here. Stay, get clean first - you have an excellent motivation -  then find John,” Mycroft pleads with his genius brother.
Another April evening and John limps away from his room near Speaker’s Corner. A recent raid demolished part of the hotel lobby - but the lobby was not part of the structural foundation of the actual hotel, and John accepts the broken glass and rubble if it means there is still a roof over his head.
The moorings creak as the soldiers board their landing craft. The barrage has started - it is almost impossible to talk now, over the whistle of torpedoes and rat-tat-tat of ceaseless machine gun fire. John and Bill are going out with A Troop.
Alessandre walks out onto Montague Street, after quickly tucking a gun into the back of her jeans under her jacket and gets into a waiting dark blue Jaguar. The driver hands her a mobile phone as she slides in, “Hello darling, you will never guess where I'm calling from!”
It is nearly midnight when Mycroft turns the key to his tastefully lavish home on Avenue Road in St Johns Wood. He passes through the reception hall into his study, making a beeline for the bar cart. Mycroft pours a measure of scotch into his glass, then sighs and adds a second finger. Only after his first sip does he notice that one of the snifters is missing.
Overlord will take you days to sift through,” Mycroft considers for a moment, “That is likely Moriarty’s true plan. Take you out of the equation, on a wild goose chase - and exploit whatever pressure point he has uncovered with impunity. Elegant.”
Morning comes and John bolts awake from a nightmare: he is looking for Sherlock, who vanished in the mist. As he disappears, Moran emerges from the fog and begins to chase John towards the edge of a cliff.
advanced, then Moriarty is going to put Phase 2 into effect. He has no more need of his canary; he can put pressure on the true leak to get details on the invasion. That’s why he gave up his source - they are only a leading indicator, no longer required if the invasion is close to formalization”.
Alessandre’s glances comprehensively at Mycroft’s tuxedo and her evening gown, gloves and cape and widens her eyes slightly.
“I have another plan that might keep you safe until we can secure you. It will mean staying on in London for a bit, are you willing?”
The SOE was active in France prior to the Normandy invasion. Rommell was surprised by the invasion - but he presciently elected to increase the defences of the Normandy beaches - largely due to their resemblance the beachhead in Italy where the Allies began their re-invasion of Europe.
The war took Moriarty away from England, which allowed Irene much more latitude to operate independently. It also brought her into circles of military men and their secrets - which made for both a lucrative side business and a first line of defence for when she misbehaved - which was always.
“Yessir, they’re strapping lads - must barely keep them together”, Bill blushes as he stares at his supper, “Same with our Marines”.
John replaces his cap, while Sherlock buttons up and sets his hat at a rakish angle. John reaches over, straightening it with military precision.
Sherlock comes to consciousness in a dark room with floors of compacted earth and stone. The window shows only the first glimmer of daylight, and the breeze carries the rank smells of low tide, but not the freshness of open ocean.
John stares into his mug, as he contemplates Sherlock’s offer. Sharing a bed does make logical sense, the sofa is anything but comfortable. John’s heart has other plans - and he worries that those plans will become too obvious if he spends the night in such close proximity to his flatmate. Damn Mycroft. Instead, he says, “OK, then. Good. Great….I guess - good night, then.  Ah….are you coming?”
The applause of the crowd surprises them both - Alessandre stands, gathering her clutch and leaves the box with the confidence of a woman who knows a man will follow her, unquestioning.
Comments, please!?! I need some motivation to come back to the page, in a life that is - otherwise - a madhouse. Cheers!
“Ah, come now, Billy- they never guess”, Watson tightens his pack and jumps down into the LCA which will bring them into the JIG Green sector of Gold Beach.
“On the contrary, brother mine - planning is advanced. Not many know exactly what Overlord is, but the fact of it? The list of people who
Turns out - First Sea Lord at the time of Operation Overlord was Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, not Dudley Pound, so I need to backtrack and correct one of the earlier chapters that has Sherlock working for Pound.
Monday Morning - John and Sherlock, both in uniform, go out for a full English breakfast. To John’s surprise, Sherlock eats. They talk about little things - childhood, why John joined up after starting his medical training - Sherlock talks about some of his pre-war cases with the Yarders, and John can’t stop himself from calling Sherlock brilliant, perhaps more than once. Sherlock deduces that John has a younger brother, John admits a sibling with an air of mystery.
. Miners had no resources for sophisticated monitoring systems, so they used the birds as indicators of gas leaks because canaries were particularly sensitive to gas at low concentrations - ".
When Wilson was too busy to socialise or some other rot, something big was on the horizon. The secretary didn’t need to give Moriarty the plans - plans that were
John wanted Sherlock from their first dinner at Angelo’s, but Sherlock said “married to his work”, and Captain Watson stood down. He spent the next several months tagging along on cases, trying to get his bearings in civilian London, and systematically ignoring any flicker of interest in Sherlock Holmes. Lust is well and good when it is reciprocal - and best ignored when it is not. He sought out girlfriends, and focused on being a friend to his often infuriating but always interesting flatmate. John was so focused on sifting out any thread of desire, that love slipped in, unnoticed.
“Irene…”, there is a terrifying, mad glint to Moriarty’s eyes as he paces towards her - his fingers flex.
“Major - some Christmas cheer?” John Watson wheels himself to James Sholto’s bedside, sloshing a flask, “Courtesy of Harry - guess it’s her thought for a care package.”
“Sherlock has had...a difficult time, in your absence. He asked me to send him in with the Overlord operation, a request which I naturally denied, “ Mycroft frowns.
“Mycroft - this is insufferable. I don't keep clients in the linens cupboard. Where will she even sleep?”
“Let’s embroider upon Operation Fortitude South - create a new American army group, and - to complete the deception - throw in ‘lead by General Patton’ - give Rommel nightmares - then he will believe the target is Pas de Calais. Falsify the plans - in the Admiralty’s copies - make sure they look like they are for Operation Overlord and for God’s sake, make sure Wren Morstan gets them. Then - we can arrange something that isn’t suspect. Illness - food poisoning - anything to take her out of the Admiralty.”
“I just have to take a piss”, Sherlock’s years of addiction mean that he clears the drug quickly from his system. While he mimes a traditional ‘heroin nod’, his brain came back online and examined his circumstances. The initial injection from Irene must have contained something other than heroin, something far stronger - like the Nazi drug Eukodol - said to be twice as strong as morphine. Irene administered it and Jim didn’t know, “Are you really going to stand there and watch?”.
After breakfast, they walk through Regent’s Park - Sherlock takes a seat on an out-of-way park bench and John sits next to him.
“No, he won’t’, John sniffs with rage, “..even if it isn’t me for him - for damn sure it’s not Moriarty. Not. Ever”.
Thank you to everyone who has joined me on this historical WW2 AU journey (which now has one more chapter to its chapter count). Special thanks to Posh-Boy-Clever-Boy, who has gone beyond beta'ing into a bit of hand-holding and a**-kicking, as required, to bring this over the finish line.
John wonders if his Corporal is still pining. Bill never questioned his new assignment, and John never told him. It comforted John - even though the worst may come - that Bill knew him and he knew Bill, even those things they were often forced to hide. Bill catches John’s gaze; John ruffles his hair affectionately as they stand and move off towards the compartment where they will try to sleep.
John steps up behind her and slides the zipper down - exposing her marble white shoulders to the small of her back. John swallows as his fingers graze her skin accidentally. He realizes this is more than a bit not good, bids her goodnight and hastily retreats to the living room where a different set of alabaster shoulders await him.
Sherlock returns to the theatre for John’s last performance. Together, they leave Rainbow Corner and return to Montague Street.
Mycroft stifles a sigh of exasperation, and begins, “Dear Sherlock - I hope my letter finds you well. It has been many months since we last spoke, but the thought of our handful of days in London has been my only consolation as I struggle to recover, in both body and mind.
As the final, frantic bars of the movement play, Mycroft lifts Alessandre’s fingers to his lips. He kisses each of her fingers in turn, breathing in her scent - not one he knows - but captivating.  Her hand remains relaxed in his, but her eyes never leave the orchestra until the final mad runs of the soloist - an explosion of virtuosity - that Mycroft cannot hear over his hammering pulse when Alessandre's peerless eyes lock with his own.
Sherlock pouted a bit, but dropped his boxers and stepped out of them. John closed his eyes while Sherlock knelt and then arranged himself across John’s lap making sure that his penis was centered strategically to avoid any contact with John’s thighs. John reminded himself to keep his mind on the business end of things, then opened his eyes to examine Sherlock’s bum with as much professional distance as he could muster. Shouldn’t be any complaints about his technique. There was an overall pink to the skin and some slight bruising across the sit spots. Sherlock hadn’t been exaggerating his discomfort. He was definitely sore, and the skin probably felt like he had a mild sunburn. John ran his fingers over it and Sherlock gave a little whine, but since John couldn’t tell if it was from pain or arousal, he lifted his hand as if the skin had burned him. He cleared his throat and asked, “Are you ready?”
Billy had a new throwaway phone apparently. Damn, damn, damn. Maybe it was a good sign. Brixton was the closest spot to find a dealer. Maybe that wasn’t where he was headed. He texted Lestrade to let him know that Crosley was still a possibility and seconds later Mrs. Hudson reported that he wasn’t at home.
As he scooped up some of the lubricant that had leaked out along with the plug, John kissed the dimple of Sherlock's lower back. “Shut up. I’ll buy you another. Now, pay attention. You’ve got the real thing.” He slicked himself and directed his cock towards the emptiness the plug had left. Sherlock was so ready for him, John was comfortable skipping his usual foreplay, the methodical (tedious and unnecessary according to Sherlock) stretching of his passageway. He slid, forever, into the slippery, wet heat in one long, slow push. His breath caught in his throat as Sherlock whimpered beneath him.
On cue, brakes shrieked outside and the door downstairs crashed open. Mrs. Hudson opened her door. “Have a scone, Detective Inspector?” she asked hopefully.
John closed the doors and said, “Let’s see what you have up in the undercover closet.” They climbed the stairs to what used to be John’s bedroom and Sherlock perked up a bit. He did enjoy his role-playing. He flung open the doors of the closet with relish. John watched him with pleasure. “Didn’t you have a set of coveralls for “The Poisonous Paint?” Sherlock had posed as a house painter to prove that a newly widowed film starlet had grown tired of waiting for a second, ancient husband to die of natural causes. Sherlock spent a week flirting and persuading her that he was only painting houses until his true artistic talent was recognized. And when she was convinced that it was true love, she had revealed the nature of the paint, which she had tampered with, adding peanut oil to trigger anaphylactic shock in the naïve elderly man.
John himself had had a solid 10 hours, then dozed on and off for another two. When he woke, he was starving again, and ran downstairs to Speedy’s for a takeaway breakfast. He settled down to enjoy the remaining two hours of blissful Sherlock-free silence.
Before he woke him, he’d have to find someone to take over. He didn’t want Sherlock trying to cope with the uncertainty of not knowing where he’d spend the day on top of having to spend it with somebody else. John leaned forward on the table with his head hanging down and braced himself for the hunt.
John growled at him, “Close your coat and let’s go.” Sherlock clutched the coat with one hand and John grabbed the other, running a few steps, until he realized the coat was flapping in his wake. He shifted to a slower pace, but his head was still swiveling, keeping an eye out for anybody who might question their motives. He was finding it difficult to accommodate the increasing pressure in his trousers.
“I know he felt he lost his way, the way we used to be. I know he felt we would never be able to bridge the gap between who we became and who we thought we’d be when we finally had our own lives.”
“Anagrams, right,” he muttered, eventually moving his attention to an unadorned dresser tucked up against the far wall. John rifled through the drawers one by one, holding the mobile against his cheek with his good shoulder until he found a pair of familiar, worn blue jeans and a checked shirt. Apparently, Mycroft had instructed one of the agents to eschew his privacy completely and carefully unpack John’s clothes. He was not surprised in the least. “But

of this damned car. He wanted to get out and find Sherlock. He wanted to find him, he wanted to smell him and taste him, he wanted to bite him, he wanted Sherlock to bend him over and –
“If past behaviour is the best predictor of future behaviour then he could no more hurt Lisa than Anderson could string an intelligent thought together. They did not bond until over six months after they presented - that is a
“When he got the text, Lisa and I got out of the car. We were just standing on the pavement in front of that cafe and Andrew came out of nowhere -
Conversely, the remaining 37.5% of the Omegaverse population would be between 0 and 29 years old and thus may not have presented yet. This gives us an additional 320,200 latent Omegaverse individuals living in London at any given time. (See “2011 Census: Usual resident population by five-year age group and sex, local authorities in the United Kingdom;” the next full census is not until 2021 so this is the best data we can get.)
” She whipped her face back towards Harlan’s hand, trembling as  she squeezed it with brutal force. “But do know what it was like? What it was like to pretend not to care that he was here, killing himself on
While John did love to be Sherlock’s sounding board on all things mysterious, he only shrugged, waiting for him to continue.
“While you were off interrogating Harlan at the detention centre, I did some digging of my own. Harlan is actually 21 not 27. He was 16 when the two of them presented; they needed a place to live, but without a guarantor you need to be 18 years old to sign a lease. Harlan lied about his age to help them get a flat. Do you remember how she reacted when she first scented me? She was so afraid, she practically backed herself into the corner. Now, what does that behaviour suggest?”
His nerve endings were firing on all cylinders now, invigorating his mind and inciting that all-consuming haze of kill or be killed he so loved in the Army, and so dearly missed in London. He waited a long moment, crouched once more, barely sparing a glance to the unconscious thug lying face-down on the damp ground. The winter day had turned dusky, and the small streetlamps dotting the pastoral lane barely lit the road, let alone the houses. One more thing in his favour.
.” Sherlock began to pace, as was normal for this type of advanced brainwork, “So, what was he trying to conceal? To answer that you have to ask yourself - what does he have to gain by being in prison?”
“Doesn’t matter right now. You’re doing fine Chesney, all you need to do is put pressure on the wound until the paramedics arrive. Do you have a scarf or something like that you can use?”
John thought long and hard about the next text, about how he would phrase it and whether or not it was even appropriate to ask. His finger hovered over the virtual keyboard for a time in indecision, wondering if this was really the time and place to go into all this. He sighed, rubbing his free hand along his temple and frowning when it came back damp. The temperature in the car must have risen at least ten degrees since they’d started driving. It must have, it was positively stifling.
“This Dr Watson…is just a little something to help you make it through the next few days.” Mycroft held the plastic pill bottle in a loose grip, holding the cap in his long fingers while angling the bottom towards John. “This,” indicating the glass vial held in the palm of his other hand, “is only in case of an emergency.”
Harlan lay motionless, a wax figurine, dry and cachexic against the hospital sheets. Lisa held his still warm, fragile hands as they came through the door.
John eyed them warily, every instinct in his body screaming at him to refuse, to run back to Sherlock, to, to…he inhaled and swiped a trembling hand across his clammy forehead.
That is just weird, why get a driver that can’t see? My bet it that the driver is a bonded omega, that will be acting as the “keeper”.
Sherlock’s panic throbbing and scrabbling in a cold knot behind his breastbone. It took John a good long moment to recover, and with a controlled breath in through his nose and out through his mouth, he ruthlessly stamped the feeling down. Now was the time for action and cold, unemotional, ruthlessness.
Andrew howled in agony as he reared back and clawed at his face, viscous fluid dribbling from his eye socket onto his cheek and lips.
Sherlock interrupted, his voice hoarse with arousal, but still somehow firm in that oh-so-clinical way that John realized he’d grown to love.
standards one wishes to interpret the law. She presented on September 3, 2008. She was 15 years old.”
BronzedViolets: I definitely agree with SuperBlue! Finishing someone else's work was terrifying, especially when it was such a well known and loved story. The best part was writing it with her. Together we were brave enough to face this challenge. Along the way the story made us laugh and it made us cry...  SuperBlue - it was a privilege to work with you, your guidance has helped me improve my writing and you are an awesome friend. <3
“Wha - How -” He sighed, furrowing his brow and trying to find the exact set of words to portray all that he wanted to ask.
knew she was alive and never said a single word to either of them. “You can’t be serious...Harlan is
John nodded, a swell of pride flushing his cheeks. He knelt down as they reached the steps to 221b, gingerly placing the bags on the stoop before fishing for his keys.
, Lisa. He could never let them take you away. He knew he was keeping you alive every second he spent apart from you. He knew you had a vision, a - a purpose in your life. You had to be free, you had to stay around. He was-” Sherlock turned his liquid gaze to John, eyes bright and reddened, “he made it possible for you to go on...to go on and make a difference.”
“Tell him good luck on finding the boss-man, but it's really a lost cause. No one’s ever found him.” Chesney said as he threw a biscuit into the air and caught it in his mouth. “Don’t even know what the sod looks like. Hell, even Harlan couldn’t get any inf—“
John only just managed to overcome his shock as Andrew’s body pitched forward, and he had just enough presence of mind to shove him to the side, not relishing the idea of Andrew’s lifeless corpse on top of him.
John’s jaw clenched, muscles rippling in his face. “Shut up now, and I might not blow a hole in your ugly face.”
Conduct a suppressant bust in the evening, receive information regarding Lysander from an Omega called Stevie
Although Harlan had confessed to the murder of Rexfield Barcroft, his reasoning behind the murder had put a kink in the entire investigation, so his trial date was indeterminate at this point. He would undoubtedly go to prison, but the murder sentence could be diluted if his allegations regarding Lisa Palmer, Rexfield Barcroft and the phantom Lysander Evans were proven to hold any credibility in court.
Acts 1 & 2 were done so with a typical 5 Act structure, the story could be resolved in three chapters but the author was foreseeing splitting it into at least 5 to 9 additional chapters i.e.,
=> I read this that Terry was admitting that he was Lysander, and that he knows that she is lying about being Lisa or that she lied to Harlan
Right, it was the shower for him then. He would have to leave the house eventually, and considering what he’d smelt like before, the last thing he needed was to give all the Alphas from Cantebury to Ashford a hard-on.
“Why would I prevent my only brother from participating in an invasion where brute force is the order of the day and his particular talents would be of no use?” Mycroft snaps.
“We really must be in for it, when is the last time we had this much food?”, Bill asks around a full mouth.
“Major James Sholto - your Major, also your former lover - did that play a role in your motivations, I wonder?”
“Sherlock’s deductions. That's the bit he got wrong - you aren't a code breaker. Then why is the British Government so
“Timing is unfortunate. Mycroft, there should have been two guards at these doors - there was only one. The Americans should have put a tail on your car the moment we left All Souls, but I could not detect one. There was a face - busboy, I think - that I later saw in an adjoining box in the theatre. I'm afraid I need to ask for help-but I’m not entirely convinced that the MI6 hasn't been compromised.”
“No. Ah, Moran is...persistent. But, rest assured Capt. Watson, I could not see anyone else in the whole of London after you sang to me. You...you were singing to me, weren’t you?”, John looks into Sherlock’s eyes - his expression is amused and ridiculously fond.
Moran, John, and Sherlock all prepare for the Normandy Invasion, while Jim Moriarty plays a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse back home in London.
“Sherlock, Dr. Scott will need a temporary place to stay while I arrange for more secure permanent quarters. As she will need to be in London, I thought the best place for her was Baker Street.”
I know.  The Chapter Count Has Risen! I'd promise it's the last time, but I'd hate to lie inadvertently. The boys just need enough words to get them through. Not much more to go - promise.
James nods his head, “So, physio? Might as well have a nip off that flask then, Captain. Happy Christmas, John.”
“Really, Mycroft. I could have assassinated you ten different ways, eleven if you count poisoning your mediocre-yet-ancient whiskey,” Sherlock drawls.
“Watson...John, I saw you the night you returned from your last leave. If you were ever that in love with me, you hid it with all you have. And I rather suspect you will love him for as long as he is still in the world. I don’t...I am not good with sentimental nonsense, John. But I am not blind,” James pats John’s shoulder in a fraternal way.
Sherlock loses a bit more time - drifting in and out of consciousness as he is borne along down the passageway. A change in the incline and they arrive at a bolted door - the wood is so dirty and worn away that it is difficult to perceive the change in the wall. Moriarty dangles a key in front of Sherlock, then snatches it away - unlocking the door with a theatrical flourish.
“Come inside, ...John,” John raises his eyebrows - it is the first time Mycroft used his Christian name.
“Get in the car, Doctor Watson. The Germans are punctual, and this is one of their favourite bombing runs with the factories nearby,” Mycroft concludes.
Irene immediately subsides, “I’ve spoken out of turn, Jim. Forgive me. You need your nurse now. Is there anything you require first, or shall we dose him right away?”
John passes through the oak-panelled hallways over silent oriental carpets until they arrive at a massive door. Mycroft produces a key, and locks them all inside, “Wilder, Brandy - I think - for everyone, then you may retire until we have need of you.”
