Cas stared at Dean. He waited for a "that’s really fucking creepy Cas." but it never came. Instead Dean set his coffee back down and resumed eating. Pointedly staring at the table.

“You have a spreadsheet,” Sam says, staring at his laptop screen. Dean shuts the lid and shifts in his seat to face Sam properly, because his own mental bullshit should not affect Sam’s day. The whole reason he was going through the bills and double checking his bank statement was to remind himself that there was a point to all of this. The upshot of the last three years of working for Rufus, apart from the fact that he
“Not right this second,” Dean says, and Sam hands it over. It still sounds like he's dragging the words out from a locked up place under his lungs m, but words are happening. “Always got time for my nerdy little brother.”
the other day, so he figured it’s okay for him to just show up a little early, even if he feels apprehensive as he knocks on the half open door.
“Will you think about taking them more often?” Cas asks, somewhere after his first cup of coffee and slice of toast. Cas is officially back to squinting at the ‘how to’ knit youtube video, but Dean doesn’t really need to get clarification about what, exactly, he’s talking about.
“In this scenario, who else could I possibly shoot?” Cas asks, eyes shut, with his head resting against the passenger seat.
“I have a free weekend,” Dean shrugs, “Look, Cas, I owe you a Daddy-issue crisis, okay? You did a lot for me and my messed up head when we were teenagers. I'm returning the favour.”
as one of their intimacy attempts and he learnt that he kind of has a thing for Cas washing his hair. It’s probably about his
“I know,” Dean says, hands in his pockets, even though there’s so many other, better, places available right now. He’s waiting for Cas’ cue on this one. He’s going to stand at arm’s length and just soak in his presence until he has any indication that Cas wants anything else because he has

.” Dean finishes. It’s a little easier than it had felt to drag out that kind of sentiment into the light than yesterday, but that doesn’t necessarily mean anything. It just means his hangover has taken out some of his usual instincts.
Sam turns up fifteen minutes later, with his mane of grey hair and his fancy ass coat that kinda makes Dean think he should be on a detective show. Dean tries to find his way to the usual Dean-Winchester special dumbass, dorky and/or inappropriate joke to lighten the mood, but he loses it before it comes out and just nods at him instead.

left Lawrence. Not that I aint pleased you’re pulling your head out of your ass and talking to me about it.”
The body can’t differentiate self-inflicted agony from an external attack; it feels pain and locks up tight all the same. Dean’s hands shake on the Impala’s steering wheel, nails biting blunt crescents into the supple leather. He flexes his fingers and regrets it instantly. Swears softly under his breath as the muscles ache in protest, an unforgiving throb from wrist to shoulder. Blood trickles down his chin from the cut on his lip, which doesn’t seem to heal any faster in Heaven than it would on Earth. His head is pounding, from stress or crying or both.
And at his heart’s center, a half-conceived dream: a small and silly and futile hope never realised, of the three of them on a beach somewhere, toes in the sand, finally free. If the world was safe, he’d told Sam, then he would give it up. Because they earned it.
At the far edge of the clearing, tucked into a quiet corner. Right in the beating heart of the world: a tall, narrow marker.
It doesn’t work. Not that it matters. No amount of slapdash composure could ever prepare him for the sight when he turns.
And it is. The gas and fire collide and the world around Dean explodes, destroying the room in an instant.
When asked about it later, Dean will swear blind it’s the echo of that sound that catches him off guard,
The question earns him one of Cas’ exasperated sighs, which they both know was the point of him asking. Dean grins wolfishly.
, not from the crying this time but from release—the sheer emotional upheaval of the day manifesting like a concussion wave following detonation. He’s not okay, not in the slightest, and there’s catharsis in admitting that. There are no secrets inside him, not anymore. He spoke his truth to Sam before he died, to himself and Castiel after.
Cas’ soft expression shifts slightly, a small vee appearing between his brows. He tilts his head just so and
Dean’s quick to realize it’s one thing to hope Cas could hear him and another entirely to have it confirmed right in front of him—a mountain of his own making, but it’s grown so much bigger than him. He doesn’t know where to even begin climbing it, so he deflects.
His wandering fingers slip past Cas’ trench and suit jacket to anchor at his hip. Cas is so damn warm, bleeding heat into Dean’s palm through the thin fabric of his dress shirt and the mouth gently probing his. Dean tilts his head to deepen the kiss, runs his tongue along the seam of Cas’ lips until they part for him. His petrichor scent explodes on Dean's palate, thick and heady. He drinks it down like it's ambrosia.
His smile softens, almost shy. It sparks a kernel of joy inside Dean to see it, for this is Cas as his most unguarded, authentic self. The second-last time Cas smiled at him like that, Dean had just poured them a finger of whiskey in celebration of Jack’s return, and Cas being right about him.
He thinks of what he’s accomplished, a weight lifted in just being. The thought sparks a memory: of those same words in another’s voice, and the feeling that accompanied them, equal parts cleansing truth and crushing despair. Dean closes his eyes, allows it to crest over him, and completes the inexorable slide into the thought’s final resting place.
Just as the demon’s head starts to resemble pulp rather than face, he drops the catch for his angel blade, releasing its hilt into his hands.
with that.” He swallows around the sandpaper in his throat, his breath a jagged, wounded thing. “I tried. You have to know that I tried. To make all that sacrifice mean something. To be everything you saw in me. I tried so damn hard to live, and I couldn’t even do that.”
“I couldn’t sleep,” Dean confesses. His voice is a choked whisper, awash with misery. “Every night, I’d hear you. Talkin’ to me. Saying that you… what you said. I couldn’t forget it. And I couldn’t move on. And I knew, deep down I knew. It wasn’t anything you said or did that cut me up so bad. It was what I
It hits Dean like a battering ram. So much has changed in such a short period of time, but not this. Not Cas.
The smell of blood and sulphur pervades his nostrils, throat and lungs screaming from exertion and a distinct lack of air in the smoke-blanketed room. Dean grits his teeth, flips his grip to angle the blade toward his enemy, and channels his strength into his arms for the killing blow.
It’s only the suffusion of smell, beyond the oppressive heat and stink of the world collapsing around him, that puts a stopper to Dean’s fear: ozone and petrichor, fresh snow and pine needles and rich, drenched earth.
It’s old. Made of dark stone, worn and cracked in places. Dean’s drawn to it like iron filaments to a magnet, drinking in each line and plane as they come into sharp relief. The moment he’s within range, he’s reaching for it. In the split second before he makes contact, Dean wonders if it will feel warm, but the stone is cool to the touch and slightly dusty. He presses his entire palm to the surface to wipe away the grit, startles at the feeling of something etched into the underside.
“I once told Jack that you feel things more acutely than any human I’ve ever known,” Cas tells him. “That your way of processing is to one day explode, let it all out, breathe deeply and move on. I like to think I know you well enough by now to see it coming, so I waited. I trusted that once you had that moment, you would know where to find me if you wanted to. And you did.”
Dean closes his eyes, letting the emotions of the day swell inside him like the slow-roiling waves of an ocean as they crash to shore, crisp and cold and cleansing. When he opens them again, it’s to the sight of Cas staring at him in that preternatural way of his, eyes bright and so, so blue.
, Dean loves him. It's a feedback loop he can't seem to switch off now that it's on, repeating ad infinitum:
His head fell heavy on Sam’s shoulder, fingers slackening in their cradle against his heart. He felt the heaving of his brother’s chest as he sobbed, the sound echoing through him like a funeral toll, and then he felt nothing at all. Death swept him into cold oblivion like a tide to sea; all that he was or could have been, swallowed up and buried by the drowning deep.
In the cradle of Castiel’s arms, Dean’s eyes rove the breadth of his wings, drinking in every last detail. The smooth, interlacing coverts where wing meets shoulder fan out into long flight feathers the color of an oil slick, iridescent in the light of the burning room. He glimpses gaps in the plumage—places where Castiel still bears scars from the fall and his return to grace—and inhales sharply, something profound settling in his chest.
His eyes are bright with the same vicious protectiveness Dean saw from across the room, tempered only by his concern.
Dean's free hand buries itself in Cas’ unruly hair, fingers dragging gently at the scalp to elicit more of those delicious noises from him. It works; Cas gasps, low and delighted, and Dean licks into his mouth, reveling in the push-pull, giving as good as he gets.
Slowly, purposefully, he lowers to his knees. His body doesn't protest like it would on Earth. The only agony he carries here is of his own making—the ghost of his guilt clawing down his back.
He leans into the monolith, unable to bear the weight of his own body and the despair welling within. Another echo of Purgatory clings to him like a cobweb—Dean leveraging himself against a tree he had to have passed a thousand times over, knees slack at the thought of Cas dying at Eve’s hands, never knowing Dean already forgave him. His prayer had been a desperate bid to right that wrong before it was too late, the words leaving his lips like a tired exhalation.
As he clears the rest of the dust from the monolith, revealing row upon row of ancient text, an understanding of a different kind begins to form.
, in Heaven. With him. There are no big bads, no world-ending stakes; there’s nothing and nobody standing between them now. They’re safe and they’re here and they’re in love with each other.
He does. He feels the truth in the statement the same way he felt his way here. It soothes the part of him still chomping at the bit at how his story ended, the reassurance that at least here
The wings close even tighter in response to Dean’s touch, blocking out the world until it's just the two of them in a cocoon of shadow, sharing breath in the warmth of Castiel’s embrace.
“You tapped into the intrinsic network of information offered throughout the Heavens. You asked it a question—where to find me—and you found your answer,” he says. “Nobody controls you here, Dean. No God. No angels. Nobody. I need you to understand that.”
“Yes,” Castiel says, “They’ve known each other for a long time, as it turns out. They were friends for a long time before they got together.”
chunk in his current state of perpetual freak-out is the tip of the fucking iceberg. Charlie’s barely speaking to him, he’s avoiding Sam so he doesn’t have to try and explain any of this, he still hasn’t gotten even a fifth of an Autumn menu planned and he’s relatively sure that he Cas are actually goddamn
“Deal,” Dean says, “And you —- you call me at least three times before you give up on me all together. Give me the benefit of the doubt.”
“This is…. Significant,” Cas says, slowly, like he’s scared of chasing Dean away just repeating Dean’s own words back at him, which isn’t exactly surprising. Dean’s not known for outbursts about his feelings and… and they’ve slipped back into
As it turns out, Dean has made the bed, which means that he has at least considered this possibility of this happening, or has turned into the kind of person who makes their bed every day (doubtful). Or, he had intended for his room to be part of the tour before he changed his mind. Either is plausible, and ---
, but Cas looks great in his sexy professor get up (“I’m a researcher, Dean”) and he had this pathetic kicked-puppy look when his alarm went off this morning and looked at Dean like he hung the damn moon when he bought him coffee.
“I - what do you…? The hell does weirdly platonic, mean?” Dean asks, a lot more flustered than he meant to be over goddamn
“Do you want a drink?” Castiel says, setting his box of belongings down near the sofa and tracking Dean’s expression. He needs to explain why he didn’t tell Meg about Dean. He needs to explain why he’s been keeping Dean away from his apartment. He needs to explain why he has suddenly erected all these walls, when he doesn’t want them, doesn’t like them, and does not understand them.
“They were… happy and so sure of their decisions,” Cas frowns at the cover of his book. Last Dean heard, Gabriel got just far enough into the family firm to print business cards before he quit to spend his trust fund doing whatever the hell he wanted. Anna did four or five years before she sacked it off to become an art therapist. Both of those things happened just before they’re big fight, and Dean’s pretty sure that Cas was just about ready to cut both of them off like the rest of his brothers. Apparently, they made up. “I don’t remember the last time I was sure about anything.” A lump of something painful rises at the back of Dean’s throat. Fuck, he’s always been shit at dealing with Cas being unhappy. It’s always tugged at some deep need to just freaking
“This associate just came in here and asked if this was my brother-in-law, because his kid-brother is making some kind of tik tok video out of it.”

Dean sends him, heart beating oddly fast considering all he’s done is consider sending Cas a photo of his damn face. It shouldn’t really be a big deal.
Cas calls him when he's cooking dinner and Sam's ‘doing his homework’ with the TV turned up so loud that Dean can barely hear himself think, but that appears to be Sam's thing right now. Freaking volume. Dean puts the phone on speaker as he chops onions and the conversation
in the world and tends to give him the highlights (or, you know, lowlights), but Dean figures that the reality of it pretty much trickles down to his actual life. He knows the country is taking a nose dive into the twilight zone, because he’s living it.
an asshole,” Castiel agrees, spooning soup into the bowl that’s Sam holding. “But I could have handled it.”
. And we’ve been slowly eating into the damn savings for months anyway. There’s not that much left.”
, and you want all of it. No, I didn’t have to cut Sam out because I thought I was having a kid and, no, Cas, I didn’t have to push you out because I thought it was the only way to hang onto my brother, but ---- yeah. I’d have had to choose between moving to Indiana and seeing Sam at Christmasses and Thanksgivings, or being the kind of Dad that’s only ever seen his kid in pictures. I --- right now, at this place in my life, things are

Gabriel about it, even if he didn’t really mean to exactly, then wanders upstairs to put on real clothes and to work himself up to doing something with his day.
“Can’t,” Dean says, “I’m doing a set on the top deck in half an hour. I gotta…. I gotta get my head on straight. You, um, thanks.”
“Perky-ish,” Dean says, which gets him a snort and a kiss, and then Cas pulls the covers half over them with his socks still on, because they’re really really married these days. “Okay, so I’m old. You leaving me for a younger model?”
“I already did,” Sam says, “With Charlie. Kevin, Bess and Ash are your headline acts. Garth if he’s back off sick. You want the list of servers too?”
“Thank you for cooking,” Cas says mildly, finally setting his book down. He said he’d ‘finish his chapter’ than help, which Dean’s pretty sure is just a way to get out of doing any of the work, because every single time Dean’s glanced over at him (more than he’d admit) his eyes haven’t been moving. Cas seems maudlin today, though, and Dean’s pretty sure if the only reason Cas invited him here was so Dean would cook while he processed Dean would still probably have come.
Now, Dean is eating his meat feast pizza with a beer wedged between his thighs and his hand on Castiel’s knee.
“There’s never been a good reason for me to hate you, Sammy.” Dean says, “And I’d never cut you out. Not for anything.”
Dean bites down on instinct, a desperate ploy to distract himself from one wound by inflicting another. Copper bursts on his tongue as the skin breaks, but the sting has nothing on the pain that cleaves his chest just
Dead and gone just two weeks after saving the world for the umpteenth time, after losing his best friend and their kid, after hearing everything he ever wanted from the person he wanted it from: that he was more than a weapon, that he was worthy, that he was
Dean can’t cry for help, can’t even part his lips to summon the sound. He’s only breathing because the witch doesn’t want him to succumb to asphyxia before the demon gets to him, and isn’t
“It’s a touchstone,” Cas explains, obliging him like he always does. “It isn’t enough to scribe words on the monolith’s surface—a portion of my grace is embedded in the stone. It is, quite literally, a part of me.”
Dean clears his throat. “Really,” he says, and it’s better. Just. “Rattled me is all, but I’m okay. Promise.”
The strangest thing about it is that it isn’t strange at all. Faith isn’t something Dean has ever really lacked, not where it counts. He had faith in his father when John’s word was all he knew, a pillar of strength in his formative years despite how troubled those memories are now. Faith in his brother to have his back come hell or high water, that raising Sam was the one thing he knew he did right. Faith in Bobby to keep him in line, not to the letter of the law but to the word of his heart. Faith in Cas to walk the hard path with him, to fight alongside them, and to keep the most precious parts of Dean’s soul safe. Faith in Mom to return to them no matter how long she’s gone, to remind him that now is always better than before, that what’s real are people, families,
He slips out of consciousness in the arms of his best friend and the canopy of his umbrous wings, lowering his guard because it’s safe now.
His face is still cradled in Cas’ capable hands; Dean rests their foreheads together, chasing the ghost of Cas’ warmth on his lips.
The demon looms large before him, wrenching the angel blade out of Dean’s white-knuckled grip to test its tip against a finger. That dark grin grows wider as he jerks Dean’s chin up to meet his dead-eyed stare. So he can watch as he dies.
he thinks, imbuing the word with intent. It’s the Hail Mary of last ditch attempts—to get the angel’s attention through prayer.
The restlessness returns in full force beneath his skin, zero to a hundred in an instant, like he’s hit the accelerator without ever even moving his foot to the pedal. The ache in his blood is so strong it’s palpable, pinpricks of heat emanating from his heart’s center, only this time it doesn’t feel like he’s running away, but
Heaven isn’t a gilded cage anymore, it’s another form of living: an open sandbox of the best and worst things freedom has to offer. Full cast, new episodes, no reruns. Dean never expected to make it to the pearly gates, even with a line to the man up top. He can’t tell if he’s committing some cardinal sin by being spitting mad about it, choking on the
The punch connects, knocking Dean back with alarming strength, followed by another and another as the demon rips into him, unrelenting. The final blow sends him careening into a pillar at the center of the room, chest-first and—
Dean stands stock still, his breath a fragile, trembling thing. His gaze is locked on Cas as he follows the path of his hands up, up, up Dean’s body—there's no tension on his face, just that small, shy smile and single-minded focus. Cas’ hands crest his shoulders, fingertips grazing Dean’s bare skin as they rake over his collar toward his neck. Dean swallows hard, throat working beneath Cas’ long and careful fingers.
. Hot and slick, the rasp of Cas’ stubble raising gooseflesh on Dean’s skin as they kiss and kiss and kiss. They’re close, but Dean wants more. He wants Cas everywhere, wants to drown in him.
The distance between them falls away. In the time it takes him to draw breath, Castiel is there, forcing himself between Dean and the demon, who reels at the sudden intrusion—and the hand on his forehead that burns the afterlife right out of him.
Castiel spins to face Dean, and with the same fingers that just smote an agent of Hell—the scent of earth and electricity warring for dominance in the air—touches his cheek to heal him. Dean’s ears stop ringing, the stinging cuts to his face and the band of pain around his ribs fade, and the locked muscles of his body relax. Dean capitulates, but Castiel is waiting for him. He catches him on the shoulder with his free hand, palm coveting the exact place he branded Dean when he raised him from Perdition all those years ago.
“There's something I’ve wanted to do for a long time,” Cas announces, stealing Dean from his thoughts. “If you’ll indulge me.”
time—but it doesn’t stop the panic from mounting inside him, crushing hope beneath its bootheel as it climbs. Everything else has irrevocably changed, but he'd been holding out hope that maybe,
It feels like a revelation, though it really shouldn’t. Castiel is here, on the same side of eternity as Dean.
He feels lighter than he has in years, coming out the other end of that fire. Like for once it was enough to simply
It’s Cas, this time, who bridges what little space exists between them. He does it slowly, telegraphing his movements, giving Dean all the time in the world to back away if he wants to. He doesn’t. Cas reaches out with both hands, loops his fingers around Dean’s wrists and slowly, gently, cards them up the length of his arms, palms flat against the soft cotton of Dean’s shirt.
And then Dean was standing in the shadow of tall, dark trees, facing the wall that stretched out into the unseen distance on either side.
And then there was the weekend away for Valentine’s. Ash had let them use his cabin in the middle of nowhere…so Cas could be as loud as he wanted when Dean slammed into his prostrate again and again, taking him apart and putting him back together in so many varied, colorful,
Dean’s brows furrowed. Ellen was supposed to keep Cas here until Dean could talk to him, but Ellen and Jo were nowhere to be seen. He would have called out to Cas, but between one breath and the next, the detective was gone.
Sam studied the machine for a moment more before shaking his head. “We have to consult the others before making any final decisions here.” He glanced at Dean, “I’ll go get them.”
"Because you don't even have to take them off to spank me...or to fuck me," Castiel whispered as he grabbed Dean by the ears and yanked him in for another kiss. Dean groaned into his mouth, his hand speeding up over Castiel's cock.
The green-eyed boy smiled at him. "Old family secret," he murmured, reaching up for another kiss. "If I told you, I'd probably have to tie you up and gag you, just to make sure it never got out."
"Hey!" Someone interjected from behind them. Castiel spun around to find Dean standing there, a wide smile on his face.
might not have been the word Castiel would use, and from the look Ellen tried to hide, he could tell that she felt the same. He simply smiled blandly and kept eating.
“Dear god,” Sam muttered. “I feel like I should warn them about what they’re getting themselves into here.”
"Dean, sweetheart, you can't enjoy the show if you finish too soon," he reminded. "Now watch," he breathed.
So Dean was into racing…and into Ketch. It was no big deal, he tried to tell himself. But it absolutely was, his alpha snapped back, because from what Castiel could see through his binoculars, Ketch was into Dean too.
as it arched its spine into Cas’s hand, plodding first one way then the other across his lap. Cas brought his other hand up to scratch at its chin, then its head as it purred contentedly.
“I know.” But Cas’s voice was hoarse, cracking under the strain of his magic. His entire body was cracking, it seemed.
Castiel settled back down on top of Dean, straddling his hips and grinding down to rub their erections together. Dean groaned and threw his head back, his mouth dropping open as Castiel gave a particularly hard thrust.
“She left, but you stayed.” Cas pressed a kiss behind Dean’s ear. “Even when I tried to push you away, you stayed.”
A small part of Dean, the same part that had wanted to take Castiel’s hand in the field, felt the urge to go check on him, but the rest of him overruled that as he jumped up and stumbled from the lab, practically running.
But above all that, his practical side won out every time. How would Dean even find him? And that’s if the man felt inclined to do so… Lucifer had been right: Cas was now just a successful mission to Agent Winchester, nothing more. And even then, there was still Cas’s deal with Lucifer, and through him Crowley. If Cas went back on either of them, especially given their shared history...he was a dead man for sure.
“I ought to follow you home,” Cas threatened the cat, who was devouring the small portion of grilled fish Cas had laid out for it on the counter. “Make sure they know you’ve already had a good meal.”
That smug feeling lasted for about two days. First Cas begged off for homework, which wasn’t too weird. Like I said, he’s super smart.
But just because he hated something didn’t mean it would magically change. Because that’s how things went in the world. Because life just wasn’t fair.
Before its gaping maw ever reached Ana’s throat, she gasped in pain with tears springing to her eyes. Its gaze dropped to the knife now lodged in her abdomen, the knife with her own fingers still wrapped around the hilt.
Castiel turned to face her, and immediately his face took on the same surprised expression that Ana’s had. “You are one of us.”
Again two rings. This time, a deep voice filtered through the speakers. “Good afternoon, Agent. Status?”
Tears brimmed in his eyes, threatened to spill, but then the damn cat was there, flicking at his cheek with its tail.
And just like that, they were back in easy territory. Castiel let out the breath he’d been holding, his eyes adoring on Dean’s face. A rush of exhilaration coursed through Dean. He felt like he could take on the whole damn world, if Cas would just keep looking at him like that.
But now Cas had his answer. Dean. Dean would take care of him, just like he would take care of Dean, even after their own graduation, even if it did have to be long distance for a few years. It was worth it, knowing that Dean would be in college earning his degree in mechanical engineering.
The silent thanks he sent Victor's way definitely wasn't the first since that day in the bathroom stall, but it was definitely the most enthusiastic.
No matter what Dean might have said, and no matter how he may have acted toward Castiel when they were alone together, he'd been the same as all the others. He had others. No, actually, he had her. It was just like Victor all over again. Castiel was just a cheap replacement for the pretty cheerleader.
“I think this type of bread would be perfect for the festival!” the golden-warm voice exclaimed. And then it was right there, right at Cas’s elbow. “Don’t you think so, Lord Dupuis?”
He headed for Crowley’s house after school, intending to ask him about it, but no sooner was he through Crowley’s front door than the boy was practically pouncing on him, claiming his mouth in a hungry kiss. Castiel didn’t get very much out past that beyond the occasional moan. Afterward, as they lay there, chests heaving, sweat cooling on their skin, Castiel tried to figure out a way to broach the subject. Crowley beat him to it.
Cas, realizing his silence had stretched too long and too awkward, opened his mouth to respond, to tell M. Winchester that he should have no problem finding a willing young suitor from the town to help him. As if proving Cas’s unspoken thought, the butcher’s daughter Amara stepped up on the young man’s other side.
.” His hand came up to cup Cas’s cheek as he pleaded, “Come back with me, give me another chance. I can’t promise that I’ll be perfect, but I’ll sure as hell be yours, if you let me.”
Despite all of the boys he'd had since Victor, none of them had quite met up to a certain standard in Castiel's mind. Even when they were a little rougher, just like Castiel liked it, they still lacked that quality that Castiel so loved. They lacked the power to control Castiel and his bright blue eyes and his pouty lips and his insatiable need to be touched and lov— no. No, he didn't need that other part. Castiel just wanted to be touched. Nothing more.
“Yeah, that whole group,” she explained. She glanced back at Sam. “Right, he dated Crowley last year?”
Dean stiffened involuntarily. Was he actually talking about hooking up with other guys? While Dean was still in his bed?
. Dean hadn’t pushed too much after that, which meant that it was already happening. Dean was moving on.
The man again placed a gentle hand on Cas’s forearm, just as he had in the bakery. “Won’t you please call me Dean?”
“Castiel!” she cried, diverting his attention for a split-second. In that moment, the demon almost broke free, ready to attack.
“Keep your voice down,” Cas muttered as he jerked his head in the opposite direction Crowley and his bodyguard had gone.
Castiel shrugged. "Usually I come here on Tuesdays when Naomi and Michael go to the soup kitchen. You know, guilty pleasure food."
“Good, there’s a little deli around the corner I’ve been wanting to try,” Dean explained as he guided them back toward the entrance.
Dammit, Cas was going to be the absolute end of him. And the worst part was, he didn’t even mind it so much. Even now as the cab sped toward Cas’s apartment—toward the home of a fucking detective who could put him away for a long time—he felt his heart picking up a beat in anticipation.
Castiel disappeared after dinner, and at first Dean worried that he’d left without saying goodbye. But when he walked into the common room, he found Castiel floating by the tall windows, staring out at the city night. No one else was in the room, just him and Dean. For some reason that made Dean’s stomach pitch and his throat dry up. He couldn’t tell if that reaction was a good or a bad thing.
What the public, along with those scientists, hadn’t considered was how the secondary genders would further divide society. Things had been bad enough with primary genders and race and sexuality. Now, with alphas and betas and omegas, suppressed peoples found themselves even more so.
“Yes, you did.” Hannah squeezed his arm. “You don’t even realize the depth of your powers when it comes to him.”
He sighed, and she could suddenly see it, see how he was so weary and broken. “Because my power is weakening by the moment. I know you feel it...When I finally exhaust my power, I will not be able to keep the shadow from escaping into the world. If he gets free, he will resurrect the others, and then...”
He couldn’t help but wonder how many times it had happened already, how many more times it would happen after Dean was out of the picture. He couldn’t stop the sadness that accompanied that thought, so he shoved it all away.
Then when he was in sixth grade, he won first prize in some big essay thing where he wrote about  what he wanted to do with his life. Even then he knew he wanted to be a lawyer.
It still felt a bit odd to watch Sam fiddling with the First Blade, preparing to carry it into battle. Still, as Dean cleaned his colt, he knew he’d made the right choice.
As the rain suddenly lessened, more of their surroundings became visible. Brady could finally see the trees surrounding the abandoned parking lot, the bus stop on the corner…his classmate standing under the bus stop’s canopy, staring straight at them.
“Bonds cannot simply be rejected, Dean,” she explained, her tone sad. “Especially not by the man who carries the blood of the first alpha. That pain must be felt.”
“Uh, we haven’t actually...like, called it dating or anything. We’ve just hung out and did some… uh,
“I think you’ll find him more than acceptable,” Castiel said, his genuine smile creeping through. His tone, however, spoke the unvoiced truth: Dean was staying, even if she didn’t find him acceptable.
Once Castiel had gotten the children safely tucked in for the night, he wandered down to the bathroom to brush his teeth before bed. He’d just barely turned the corner when he felt it again, that inescapable certainty that he was being watched.
“True pain?” Cas murmured, but the words were still heard just as clearly as the yelling. Dean stiffened as his omega’s crazed laughter echoed through the air. “For months now, I have known nothing but pain.” Cas’s magic flared. “And you’re right: I am stronger than ever.”
Dean flushed and glanced over at Castiel, but the smaller boy said nothing. He'd let Dean decide how this was gonna play, if they were going all the way with this.
So when Victor told him, in no uncertain terms, to speed things along with Castiel’s family, he wasn’t worried. He knew he’d figure it out, a way into the family...but he hadn’t expected it to come so damn easily. In fact, of all the options and scenarios he had planned for, he wasn’t ready for what actually happened.
Almost as though he could read his mind, Benny clapped him on the back. “Hell hath no fury, brother.”
And no matter what, that couldn’t happen. He may just be a pawn in his father’s political games, but he’d come out with his dignity still intact, dammit.
“Castiel,” he responded, his voice hoarse. He cleared his throat as he stepped up to the counter across from him, his eyes finding Castiel’s. No gold. “How are you?”
It finally finished middle of October, just in time for Garth’s Halloween...thing. Dean could never quite tell what it was meant to be, since so many different twists and turns happened throughout the damn thing.
“Ready for this, Lover?” he breathed as the head caught on the rim. And then he was pushing down, taking Dean inch by inch, moaning like he was made for this. Dean could only watch him, watch his beautiful face scrunched up, the light sheen of sweat breaking out on his brow, the way his mouth fell open as he pushed himself down further.
He slid out from the booth and headed toward the register with Dean. He leaned up against the counter to wait for someone to ring them up, and Dean stood right behind him, his hands resting on the counter on either side of Castiel, trapping him in. Castiel could feel the heat of Dean bleeding through his thin t-shirt.
“Within the month, I hope. You’ll need to bring the whole team, of course,” he explained, and Dean nodded. “I’ll send along the logistics, once I am absolutely certain that my plan will work.”
Lucifer frowned. “Crowley’s stumbled onto something big, something with a huge payout in about 6 weeks. I need to keep this in my back pocket until then, because if I sell this now, I won’t have anything to trade him then.”
“Fine, meet me at the parking lot in fifteen,” I barked at Brady. I spotted my boxers over by the dresser and pointed at them. “Hand me my boxers, Sweetheart.”
With a laugh, Cas had shoved Dean out into the open, pants undone, semi clearly visible…and with a soft giggle, he’d pulled him right back in.
The next morning he went into work like usual, but even his aide could see he was in a foul mood. The poor beta was walking on egg shells by the end of the workday when Castiel stormed out the front door to go home and get ready for dinner. It was another boring event scheduled for the sake of the Winchester brothers, with various business leaders and dignitaries in attendance. Oh, and there would be military leaders too, which meant donning his dress uniform, as if the evening wasn't going to be stifling enough.
“I’ll call someone in to cover your shift,” Charlie says, all business, before Dean can say a damn word, let alone process what the hell just happened.
Dean follows the stream for a time, watching the forest floor turn from patchy brushland to long blades of soft grass. The terrain levels out, lending him greater visibility to the far-off reaches of the glade. The area is bordered by trees, but there are only a few studded in the clearing itself. It makes the object that much more of an outlier when Dean lays eyes on it.
“Enochian,” Dean murmurs, tracing the sharp swooping lines of the celestial language as it comes into view beneath his fingers. He’s unable to discern the meaning of the symbols, only that they aren't any he's ever seen.
He taps Dean’s chest, just above his heart. The brief touch is electrifying. “That’s what you need to understand about this new world, Dean. It’s all on you. I didn’t bring you here, I didn’t have to. You brought yourself.”
“Cas,” he says, and the familiar blade of pain slides home between his ribs. The sick loop of those final moments threatens to play out behind his eyes so Dean opens them, roots his gaze to the roughhewn face of the monolith. Tries again. “Cas, I’m no good with words and I am straight-up bad at praying. But I’m gonna give it a shot. You better have your ears on, man, ‘cause there’s something I need to say.”
It’s why he drives for what feels like forever, even after finding Sam on that bridge; no destination in mind, just the burn of Baby’s tires on the open road. Dean wants to burn too. He’s restless—got gasoline for blood, body itching for that one spark to light it all up.
“This world, this paradise. It’s amazing. It’s so much better than I could have ever hoped for. But it ain’t my Heaven, Cas,” he admits. “Not without you in it. So I'm asking you, I'm begging you—hell, I'm even
He’s writing it now, with every turn of Baby’s tires against the asphalt and every mile he closes between him and his goal.
He holds Castiel’s gaze for a beat too long, the way they used to when neither of them knew what the pull between them was. It settles something primal in Castiel, the tension bleeding from his body by degrees.
Riding the strange high of exhaustion and awe, Dean reaches out to touch the nearest crest of feathers. For all the wings are hazy and indistinct to the eye, they’re surprisingly solid to the touch, soft like velvet against his skin. Castiel gasps brokenly into the crook of Dean’s neck; the hands around his waist tighten but the overarching line of his body relaxes further into him. When Dean imagines intimacy between them—which is more often than not, these days—it’s never like this, in the barely-survived aftermath of a hunt gone terribly wrong. As cheesy as it sounds, he wants to wine and dine Cas before they… before. The whole nine yards, because he deserves it.
In the nanoseconds of time it takes the mind to operate, Dean realizes there’s no way out for him—no time left to reach minimum safe distance. Fear and despair churn low in his gut, the growing nausea assuaged only by the sight of Sam sprinting out the warehouse entrance, hand over his face to shield his nose and mouth from the fumes.
So he lets go. Of all of it. Weeps into the dark hollow of his hands, coming apart completely. He’s tired and he’s burnt out and he’s
Dean takes a steadying breath, opens his eyes to the sun-soaked road before him, and puts his car into drive.
It isn’t just his arms. Dean’s flanked on either side by a wall of angelic protection, thick and soft and ineffable. It takes a few, agonizing seconds for him to notice that isn’t right, another few to source out
as Dean dragged Cas down to his level. As Cas decided, inconceivably, that he liked his place in the dirt. As he proved, time and time again, that he belonged there with them.
Dean. His hands find purchase on Cas’ coat, gripping it by the lapels and using it to draw the hard line of their bodies together. Cas shudders beautifully at the contact, makes a sound deep in his throat that Dean can’t help but want to taste so he does, leaning forward to capture his lips in a searing kiss.
The witch he sucker punched has her arms raised in his direction, chanting. Her busted-up face is dark with fury—if looks could kill, Dean would be all-the-way dead. As it stands, he’s immobilized, which amounts to the same thing in a hunt. Either the witch kills him outright (boring), or she gets the demon to do it while Dean watches, incapable of defending himself (not boring, and kind of fucked up).
Dean’s eyes scan the room until they find Sam. He’s on the other side of a cabal of demons, indistinct in the haze, but Dean would recognize his shape anywhere. He doesn’t need the gory details to know Sam’s got it covered; there isn’t much his brother can’t beat nowadays, with a good knife, his wits and the reach to take on multiple assailants at once.
in love with him at the end of this weekend then he was at the beginning. He didn’t know there was still capacity in him to fall deeper, but Dean is a different man to the twenty five year old Castiel argued with on his stag night in a lot of ways, or at least more open and comfortable with who he is. He’s never got to see him
He cries because a twenty three year old who looks like Dean is dead and never got to fall in love and talk about permanence and he cries because Dean was
“I have some articles to write,” Castiel says, although he can’t think of anything less appealing than sitting down and trying to dredge something interesting out of his brain, because he’s saturated. He’s dried out, overcooked, over-seasoned. “Some to edit. I am a guest ‘food journalist’ on some evening news show and, ideally, I need to blog. And there is laundry. I’ll cook dinner for when you’re home.”
, because it hadn’t really shocked Dean, at the time. He sat there as they called him and Dean was pretty sure that he’d be left there to rot, because John Winchester had been pretty clear about Dean keeping his nose clean and Dean had messed up. The confirmation felt pretty crappy, but it wasn’t a surprise.
Castiel does take the time to drink a very strong coffee and to eat the breakfast that Dean left him as a peace-offering slash maybe apology (Castiel is unclear at present, but Dean
“Mostly, miscommunication, certain statements of intent and a lot of consummating our relationship,” Castiel says, picking up his phone and wandering into his bedroom, just as a text rolls in from Dean.
“Pretty sure that’s what I goddamn said,” Dean says, allowing Cas to pull him in for another kiss. He’s got no goddamn idea why he ever pretended this was something he didn’t want: why he ever thought he had the capacity to give it up.
“Ha,” Dean says, tipping his onions into the pan and heading back to the fridge for the rest of dinner. Vegetables, for Sam. Chicken. “You know... Charlie had opinions.”
“N’ah,” Dean says, “It's getting late and I pretty much spent all my pocket money on a kid-beer and a pack of peanuts. It’s a long drive, so I should —- I should go.”

“Yeah, maybe. But I’ve got a ten hour frigging flight of thinking about it and then they’re gonna be
“Uh, no,” Dean says, spearing his mostly-cold bacon onto his fork. He just missed the freshly cooked bacon delivered and got stuck with the stuff that’s been under the heaters, but he’s in too much of a good mood to really give a damn. “And no montages.”
“Thank you,” Castiel says, because he is proud of that too. His inadvisable tendency to give people the benefit of the doubt is not without its merit.  “I --- I am proud of you too, Dean. You are
the damn coffee and I like waking up with you. Things are good. Really good. Not intending that to change any time soon. Just want you to think of my apartment as home.
“Yeah,” Emma agrees, standing up. “I’ll call Jake.” She says, slipping out, and Dean thinks that they all know that she’s going out in the hallway to cry.
He wants to have a kick ass evening with Cas, on their beach, and he wants to do something with the sexual tension that’s been floating around all over the place  ever since they actually broached this conversation. He wants to be okay and he wants them to freaking make love, or some sentimental shit, and he wants Cas to know, in his bones, how much Dean fucking loves him.
Cas takes his hand and threads their fingers together. He’s warmer than his half-drunk cup of tea is, now, steady and solid as he looks him dead in the eye.
, but it’s pretty normal.” Dean says, “Go brush your teeth and turn your baby blues on Gabe, till he makes your pathetic ass some breakfast.”
it would be to hit the road with Cas, in his six thousandth tench coat and his glasses, driving across America like they’re freaking kids. No goddamn work anymore. Look after Ameila and his future grandson and do that baby thing again, but for set hours a day and the ability to give them back later, and buy Cas books on gardening and mock his efforts to grow tomatoes and cook weekend meals every weeknight and watch daytime TV on the sofa and make out and spend the next ten or twenty years or however long they get just being happy. He’s never properly thought about it before, but right now he can’t really think of
a fix-it strategy to break it down into manageable bite sized chunks, only then it turned out that a

they’re all in the same place and Cas is trying to fit it together in his head. The brother he’s met a handful of times and Gabriel, whose more sibling than cousin any day of the week.

because he was scared that if he pushed Dean would bolt, and because there were plenty of Castiel’s own insecurities that he hadn’t shared yet and because Dean didn’t
“Samandriel is not normally malicious,” Cas says, “But, it’s a possibility. I don’t care. He always knew I was in love with you, so there would be a certain sense of satisfaction in informing him we’re still very happy together.”
“I’m aware,” Castiel says, because he’s a dorky little guy who always manages to Han Solo him by accident. If he didn’t also intermittently offer up hyper-intense declarations of love with painful sincerity, Dean would probably have a complex about it, but as is it’s hard to doubt the guy reciprocates. It’s just no one ever taught him you’re supposed to say
, but he’d be scared of some of the answers on good days and today isn’t going very well. He’s silent for too long, apparently, because Dean squares his jaw in irritation and shucks up his shirt.
Dean brought trembling fingers to stroke down Cas’s cheek.“You were ready to give up your secret…to expose the royal family to scandal, all to protect me.” His breath hitched. “Only a fool would miss such obvious signs.”
He took a deep breath and stepped into the office, shutting the door firmly behind him. Hester barely turned her head to acknowledge his presence.
But even in his haze, he was glad he’d gotten away in time. If he’d been anywhere near his alpha...God, that’d be bad.
She sighed again, deeply...painfully. “Don’t thank me. I was all for killing you, but since Cas is the one calling the shots on this, you get to live.”
Dean watched as he reached for the drawer beside his bed and took out a bottle of lube and a condom. Castiel smirked.
“I understand,” Dean replied softly. He bowed his head in acknowledgment. “Please don’t let my presence disturb you. I’ll just be over there reading.” He turned and wandered away, leaving Castiel to his
Immediately Dean’s mind jumped to Castiel. If the bond always took for omegas... Dean would have frowned, had he not been undercover. So instead he smiled, but his panicked mind kept replaying his few, too-brief interactions with Cas, looking for hints of pain.
Dean drew a deep breath, then his next words came out in a rush. “I’ve never once felt this way about anyone before.”
“So I decided to just... remain mateless. I’ve spent the last eleven years dedicating myself to my country, my family. I fight their battles so they don’t have to.”
Before he could finish, Cas stepped forward again and kneed him in the face, and with a crunch of bone, he crumpled to the ground unconscious.
“Oh my god,” Meg burst out. “You don’t have to keep pretending. He’s got the message loud and clear.” As quickly as her voice had risen, it dropped again. Her expression softened a bit, no longer pure anger as more sadness bled through. “And he said to tell you he understands why you were so desperate to, uh, get it right. You know, this time around.”
Castiel blushed furiously. "Why should someone take the trouble to put in time and money when they know they can get it for free?” He shot Dean a suspicious look. "Which begs the question...why are you doing this?"
Dean shouldn’t have told him about Joshua or Pete. He should’ve just shut the hell up and feigned ignorance. He’d learned time and again that people couldn’t trust him for that scheming mind of his, and alphas didn’t want an omega that could outfox them. Plus the age difference, which Dean had never once considered before, was apparently a big deal to Cas.
“He’s so good...he must be. Only a good person could make those flowers grow like that.” He sighed softly. “And he is beautiful, isn’t he?”
Dean must have sensed that, because he tilted his head to the side, studying the alpha. “Do you really want to know?”
Crowley hummed pensively. "No, I can practically hear the wheels turning in there. What's going on? Why did you text me?"
He didn’t really need to be in there in the party; he’d just wait until Gabe texted him the plan for that night. He climbed onto the hood of the small blue car and leaned back against the windshield, staring up at the empty night sky that was so unlike the star-filled skies of his hometown.
Dean stared at Hannah for several long moments before finally speaking. “Ana can travel through time?”
Not that he and Dean had ever promised monogamy. But for some reason, Castiel’s mind had latched onto Dean’s promise, onto his words. Castiel was worth something, and he deserved better than a bathroom stall. And so, even though Castiel may not have ever admitted it to himself, he was waiting for Dean. Because if he—Castiel Novak, slut extraordinaire—deserved more than a bathroom stall, then Dean deserved more than a slut who let himself get fucked in one. And Castiel was willing to be better than that for him.
Down the street, safely in his car on his way back to the station, Cas browsed through the contacts on Dean’s phone, smiling softly to himself. Dean really needed to figure out a better password than his mom’s birthday.
The images played again and again in his thoughts, taunting him. That should’ve been him that Cas was gazing at worshipfully, Dean was Cas’s alpha...or he had been.
"Darling, you never invite me over to your house, ever. And you didn't even let me get through the door before you were practically tearing my clothes off." He gestured around the living room where they still lay in the middle of the floor. "We didn't even make it to your bedroom."
The first brush of Castiel’s mouth on his is light and teasing, there and then gone. It barely qualifies as a kiss but it
He finds it in one of three long, cylindrical canisters at the back of the warehouse floor, a sizable hole punched into its side, leaking a transparent haze that flirts dangerously close to the still-smoldering remnants of the witches’ spell.
differently than he had before and maybe even for the first time. His forty-some years on Earth amounting to one fraught jump after another, out of the frying pan and into the fire of a larger deadlier threat, on and on and on until they were staring down the barrel of a gun aimed at God himself. The only happiness he’d known was in stolen moments, few and far between as they were, bittersweet with the knowledge that it wouldn't last. That it never did.
. Castiel, whose body is a perfect curve along Dean’s back, securing him utterly in his embrace and the powerful fold of those magnificent wings. Castiel, whose head rests in the hollow of Dean’s neck, soft hair tickling the side of his face. Castiel, whose panting into his skin—warm, quick breaths—and whose arms tighten imperceptibly around him when he hears Dean’s prayer.
Something tilts, near imperceptibly, like the world’s axis has shifted gears. Dean feels it in more ways than one, within
Dean's eyes sting. “Me and Sam, we always keep fighting. Even after we lose someone. Especially then. But when you—”
—the entire front of his body should have combusted from the heat and fire—and as the debris clears around them, flames smoldering from the initial blast-wave, Dean blinks the smoke from his eyes and opens them to see…
The more he struggles, the stronger the hex gets, tightening like a vice on his insides. Rooted to the spot, unable to move or even speak, there’s nothing he can do but watch in abject horror as the demon picks itself up off the floor, glances between the witch and Dean with idle curiosity, and grins through blood-stained teeth.
The world skips and starts like an old home movie that’s been played too many times, intermittent bursts of static across his field of vision. Dean blinks it away, or tries to, gasps for breath but there's no air, only smoke, thick and acrid and
Heat blankets him, only it isn’t immolation—the sloughing of flesh from his frame, layers of skin charring to ash—but arms anchoring themselves around his waist. Dean thrashes in the stranger’s hold, blinded by the light, deafened by the concussion wave and struck dumb by the realization that he’s
