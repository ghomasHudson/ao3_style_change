When John turns back around, he’s ready with an inviting smile as he spoons sugar into the man’s drink.
It’s a bloke. A tall,
“Good morning,” he rumbles back, feeling a first stirring of arousal as he rolls the man over. The kiss is turning wetter, and rougher, and John is smoothing his thumbs across Sherlock’s bare hipbones, when he hears rustling at the door and they both freeze.
“Hmm,” Irene hums dispassionately as she joins John in watching the clearly distressed man in the corner, arms folded. “Looks like he could use a refill.” She disappears into the little storage room through a door behind the counter (not before giving John a pointed look to make sure he understood).
“What the hell did you do to him?” she spits.
Sherlock chokes on his water, feels it welling up through his nose and behind his eyes. John thumps him on the back, chuckling. “All right, there, Sher?”
When the next verse begins and Sherlock turns to face John again, there’s a wild smile on his face, which John returns around the lyrics he’s singing. His heart is pounding, more than it ever did in rehearsal, as he pulls Sherlock’s head down for the final beat of the song, lips almost touching. If John thought the audience couldn’t scream any louder, they do.
“So what you’re saying…” Molly begins.
trying out for the play. Mary Morstan, so help me-”
He starts eating as soon as he finds an empty table. Maybe it’s rude not to wait for Harry to arrive, but he’s pretty sure she wouldn’t touch anything here, anyway. He keeps one eye on the door and the other on the public floo, waiting for his sister to appear.
his death scene.
“Okay. But first, I have a question,” John says. Irene looks at him expectantly.
Their second time having sex together is just as fun as the first, and but not nearly as quick. John gets a chance to show Sherlock all the
“What are you working on?” he asks.
at the soonest opportunity.
A video of John’s Conan interview loads quickly, the show's theme shouting out of his laptop’s speakers before he has the chance to stifle them. John startles awake at the noise.
With a sigh, Sherlock straightens from his crouch over the table and nudges his cup closer to John. Wordlessly, John refills it, steam curling up fresh and hot and delicious from the dark brew. “So,” he begins as he sets down the pot and reaches into his apron pocket for a pair of sugar packets. “What’s all this about?” John gestures vaguely both to the files all over the table and Sherlock’s obvious distress.
Then John walks away, hating himself for the last glimpse he had caught of a soft, disappointed look on Sherlock’s face.
“I think you’ll find you’re wrong there, Johnny-boy! Add me to the list!” Sarah chirped, utterly unfazed.
, this one’s called. Irene would likely appreciate-“
, if you wanted to. The two of you, just, connect.”
“Oh?” (Strangled, bewildered).
John takes the now perfectly formed yellow daisy tucked between his thumb and forefinger and presents it to Sherlock. Sherlock’s eyes blow wide in surprise when he sees the flower.
“Oh, of course! That must be Holmes. The new kid, think he’s in my advanced chem section. He’s not usually wearing…that.” Holmes is wearing a crop top and the tiniest purple rugby shorts John has ever seen. Not exactly practical for the brisk fall weather, and they make the boy look like he’s mostly legs. He doesn’t have proper cleats either, just a pair of scuffed up trainers with rainbow laces.
When he stumbles out of the International Arrivals gate, John and Lestrade are there to greet him instead of Mrs. Hudson as Sherlock had expected. John is wearing sunglasses to try and minimize the amount of attention they’re getting. Although it’s only been three days, Sherlock launches himself directly into John’s arms like it’s been years, and John staggers back a couple of steps as he re-centers his balance without dropping Sherlock. “John!” he shouts. “The concert starts in an hour, what are you doing here?”
“I promise,” John said. He owed it to Mary. He would do this for her because she loved him, and he her. John pulled Mary in for a hug so tight the throbbing in his shoulder stopped mattering. “
He prefers to ignore how it had taken a few poor attempts to get there.
John hates it, but he feels a hot pressure in the back of his eyes, and has to blink it away. “Do you think Dad would mind?”
“Your dad’s doing better, then, I take it?” John says, and Sherlock turns the glower on him. Which is just unacceptable, as is the several inch gap between them at the moment, so John walks straight back into Sherlock’s space. God, Sherlock is so warm and close and solid and John had
“Then I suggest,” Sherlock says as he crawls back down John’s body and undoes his trousers, “that you not make too much noise.” With that, Sherlock takes out John’s cock and swallows it down. John stuffs a hand into his mouth as his eyes roll back in his head and his hips thrust up. “Wait!!” he manages to gasp out. “Condom! Do you—“
Their words start to pile over each other.
“Sherlock,” John asks gently. “Are you a virgin?”
“And I was thinking that, well. If I can’t go ten days not seeing you without losing my mind and getting on a plane to wherever you are…”
If you hurt him-“
But he had hesitated, and the whole altercation had ended with Sherlock narrowly avoiding a knife to the gut and the sound of bone breaking as John’s fist connected with Pearce’s nose.
“Obviously.”
Sherlock sighs again, and at this point John is no longer even pretending not to be paying attention. Sherlock sets his head in his chin with a despondent look at the man.
why I chose these laces, but yes. Their rhetoric would indicate that my sartorial expression of sexual orientation was a motivating factor in their actions.”
John feels so, so, tired all at once. He wasn’t prepared to deal with all the memories that Victor’s impending appearance has dredged up. “Irene, I’ve been over this with you.”
him pay attention. I was so heartbroken. It doesn’t make any sense, but I haven’t seriously dated any blokes since then. I wasn’t sure I would ever want to again.”
“I have no idea.” The sound of the words is muffled by John’s arms. “It caught me off guard.”
This is terrifying, but at least it’s going to be fun. “Well, I can’t take you anywhere magical dressed like
John winked. “Don’t worry, your secret’s safe with me.” Molly blushed harder.
John swallowed, hot shame coursing through his veins.
“Yeah.”
John doesn't quite believe that this is the same gangly, awkward Sherlock that went out for rugby in order to flirt with the captain. On second thought, John eyes Victor again and wonders whether Sherlock might not have a type. Victor is blond, maybe an inch taller than John, and built like an athlete.
"Right. Sorry, Greg. Standing by." John was ready. Eager, even, to see whether Sherlock actually had the chops to back up his big talk. Past his initial…demonstration, John hadn’t seen Sherlock act.
“WHAT?” Sarah shrieked. “Oh my god! I don’t believe this is happening, Stan!”
“Hold the lift!” John shouts, and manages to shove an arm between the closing doors. They spring back open and there’s Sherlock Holmes, blinking down at him through long lashes. “Going down?” John asks, stepping into the elevator without waiting for an answer. It doesn't matter either way, he just wanted to catch Sherlock alone, without the agents and the other faceless men in suits breathing down their necks.
Mary sent a pointed look his way.
Sherlock surveys the children’s work, giving particular attention to Soo-Lin’s (delicately covered in Chinese script – astonishing dexterity and patience for a seven-year-old) and Jim Moriarty’s (violently splattered with liberal amounts of red paint). He adds the latter evidence to his mental catalogue of ‘Reasons Why this particular six-year-old must be watched carefully around sharp objects and campfires.’
“It was with my ex. Victor.”

something newly fragile in Sherlock, and in his 52
Greg had understood the intent behind the song without being told, and had come up with some daring choreography to suit. It’s John and Sherlock alone on the stage, John circling, and Sherlock watching, his moves both cautious and coy.
Sherlock finishes the story with, “As I often like to say: I know ash,” and a smug look askance at John, as he closes his computer with a flourish.
Mike claps a hand on John’s shoulder. “I know, mate. It’s tricky. But if you want to keep him…you don’t want to wait until you’re moving in together, or walking down the aisle, to tell him you’ve been lying about who you are since you met.”
“Take good care of my boy, Mr. Watson!” shouts his mother from behind him. Sherlock turns to scowl at her, but his gaze is caught by the sight of John Watson nodding seriously back at his mother.
“Obviously.”
. And, surprisingly, he wanted it to stick. It was good work and he liked his new friends. John
“You’re
Sherlock has cause again to roll his eyes at this man. “I finally get it.”
“What?”
Reflexively, Sherlock turns to the girl’s mother, and sees that there are tears leaking down her cheeks as she smiles blindingly down at her daughter, a hand only half covering her mouth.
“John. I feel I must inform you.”
“You want to know my favorite flower?” John sets down his utensil, nudging his plate out of the way as he leans towards Sherlock along the small table, like he might be about to tell a secret. Sherlock does the same, and rests his chin on his beautiful hands, eyes sparkling.
“Mycroft! Summon your goons!” called Sherlock. John hoped Sherlock would get the hell out of the way sooner rather than later, but he didn’t have a chance to dwell on how far away his friend’s voice had sounded, between the loudspeakers and his current predicament. Hope’s knee kicked up to land squarely in John’s gut, and John huffed, all the breath in his body leaving him. Hope squirmed out of John’s weakened hold, stood, and backed up several paces.
“Is that John Watson wants to have sex with you.”
Next, Irene gives him a whirlwind crash course in operating the cash register and the various coffee-making machines, and they prepare the shop for the day ahead. John has just finished taking down the chairs when a few patrons begin to trickle in, looking haggard and desperately in need of caffeine. No matter what odd fashion choices these Muggles are making, John discovers that, blue hair and bits of metal through the nose notwithstanding,
They walk back to Sherlock’s place in silence when the officer dismisses them. It’s a weighty silence, charged and excited. Their shoulders and fingers brush tentatively a few times but never quite connect.
“You mean me,” Sherlock teases. John knocks his shoulders lightly against Sherlock’s in rebuke. Sherlock hitches his blanket up so that it covers both of them and moves in closer to skim the words. “Is there a melody yet?”
John, talk to me. SH
“Oh,” Sherlock says softly. “…Yes.” John hadn’t realized there was hope on Sherlock’s face until he sees that it’s gone.
John stared, silent.
“John. When you turned around just now, you winced and gasped slightly, as if in pain. Bruised rib, I’d guess. Did you get injured running spotlight?”
“Your deodorant told me that.”
John’s jaw drops.
He looks over his name tag and grimaces when he sees the Year 13 photograph they’ve had printed. At fifteen, his face was covered in acne, his limp, greasy hair had nearly fallen into his eyes, and although he hadn’t smiled for the photograph, the bulge of braces behind his lips is obvious.
* * *
John nods, throat feeling too thick to say anything in return.
when he danced - with women and men (!) – he was everything grace and power and confidence, sweat beaded down his temple, down the nape of his neck, formed dark patches on his snug tee. It didn’t help that it’d been two weeks since the summer began and John had neglected to shave. A delicious golden stubble was wrapped around that strong jaw, that sculpted chin, that--
Sherlock wants to say.
“NO WAY!” John nearly shouts. “
He’s ashamed, reading the messages, at how he’s continued to snub Sherlock since.
“Y-es. Hang on. Let me think what should I have said instead,” John says, trying to dissuade Sherlock from questions about Hogwarts that he doesn’t have prepared answers for. He racks his brains for hazy memories of slang that was covered in their Muggle Studies textbooks. They were all written in the seventies, but it’s the best he can do. “I could say…um. Sherlock, that deduction thing is totally rad!”
Greg stood up from the front row and said “You heard the lady, up! Places, for top of show!”
John grins. There’s that lovely ache, again.
“That I am,” John will agree, then swoop down for a kiss.
Sherlock had catalogued eighteen waiting patients and their various ills and illnesses. He had deduced six secretaries and three nurses, counting three adulterers, two compulsive gamblers, and an online porn addict amongst them. But for the past hour, he had been silently staring at a small patch of ripped carpet between his feet. Eight hours, and it was nearing daylight, but there was still no word on John. Sherlock had repeatedly cycled through a series of frantic, unanswerable questions in his head. Was John still in surgery? Would the staff tell him when he came out? Why would they? Sherlock wasn’t anyone important to John, and he’d certainly made a nuisance of himself.
“Fine, then.
“It’s yours.” Sherlock watches thoughtfully as John pulls out the chair and seats himself. John settles in, and meets his gaze. John tries to telegraph with his expression the maelstrom of feelings inside him. That he’s sorry. That he’s here to eat crow. That he likes Sherlock quite a bit and would he mind going out with him for a nice meal later this week? He hopes that some of it has come across, because Sherlock gives him a small smile, and goes back to his work.
Mum shakes her head, amused. She and John have spoken before about Harry and Irene’s strange flirtatious relationship that’s never quite gotten off the ground.
John shakes out some of his excited nerves, grinning enormously when he sees Irene approach, dressed in a green dressing gown, the red-sequined number underneath more suitable for under the warmth of stage lights than a chilly basement.
. Or don’t you know how we got together? Sherlock and me?”
“Hmm...Then it’s decided. You can be my boyfriend.” Sherlock bends down to plant a quick kiss on John’s lips.

“...Pretty good. I spent most of it flirting with the cute barista at my local coffee shop and not getting any work done on my thesis. How was your day?”
“Are you, in fact, secretly a gigantic nerd?” He asks gravely.
“I owl you every week, Mum.”
“Obviously.
That was his first kiss.
“My dad’s in hospital.”
“Sit.” Sherlock obliged, and John wove the wire of the microphone through Sherlock’s unruly curls until its head rested at the front of his hairline. The sensation of John’s fingers carding through his hair made Sherlock sigh. He watched John’s face as he worked: admired the concentrated crease to his brow, noticed the shadows under his eyes -
Sherlock screws up his face in thought. “No idea. I’ve been calling them 'Smarmy' and 'Rat-face'. In retrospect, that also may have had something to do with this.” He gestures to his injuries.
John lets out a tortured groan, and drops his arms from his eyes to either side.
John shrugs. “Afraid not.” He raises the pot in his left hand eloquently. “You look like you need a refill.”
John finds himself wrong-footed. He had planned on marching in here, shouting a bit, and possibly forcing Victor to come back to Sherlock’s to apologize. What is he talking about now?
John makes a small, frustrated noise in the back of his throat and closes the distance between them before taking Sherlock’s face in his palms –
Sherlock knocks his head against John’s with a stern expression. “Of course it’s the opposite. All the things that made me doubt about you, or made me wonder why you wouldn’t let yourself get close to me, they were all about hiding this part of your life. Even if it is a ridiculous secret.”
That’s interesting. John shakes himself like he’s just been caught in a rainstorm and notices that, yes actually, he feels significantly less fluffy. A pity. He’d liked his shaggy coat.
going to be a season.
By the time they step out of the cab, John is practically vibrating, a sizzle of adrenaline pumping through him. Sherlock zeroes in on the drop-off location as easily as if he had cast a tracking spell on Pearce.
Sherlock smirks, lifting the violin under his chin once again. “Now, now, I didn’t say that.”
“What do you care? You’ve said it before, you hate the football blokes. Why not try out for rugby again?”
Sherlock chokes, and tries to cover it with a cough. “Irene?” he manages.
John doesn’t realize he’s giggling like a madman until he’s interrupted a minute later by Bill snatching his phone and tossing it across the room to Irene. The movie has been paused at some point. Obviously, they’ve pre-planned this phone-theft operation without his notice, because Bill is ready to restrain John when he tries to make a jump for it.
Sherlock wants to wrap this small, spectacular man in a hug and never let go. Instead, he asks (proud that his voice doesn’t falter), “Why are you telling me this?”
“I’m brilliant at everything,” Sherlock declares.
As he starts through the doorway into the living area, John is shutting off his phone. Sherlock takes in the sight of candles burning down to nothing, their meal half eaten, and feels suddenly exhausted by this charade.
“Please? You know you’re my best wing man. Well. Wing-dog.”
Greg looked curious enough to burst, but he nodded to John. “You got it Watson…So, you get anything good on this TV of yours?”
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock stared at Irene, open mouthed and horrified. Irene raised a single, sculpted eyebrow. She had been his friend for a decade, he knew this was no empty threat. He closed his eyes, defeated.
Sherlock can’t believe that after a decade away, he’s back at school. His Yves Saint Laurent black leather shoes squeak horrendously on the recently buffed gymnasium floor, late eighties pop is blaring out of a nearby set of speakers, and there are red and gold balloons absolutely
He’ll get around to saying it, sometime soon. Perhaps once they’ve settled into the Baker Street flat Mrs. H had offered them for the fall.
Molly raises an eyebrow. “You started dating her best friend.”
John has had enough of his blathering. “Yeah, but am I a pretty lady?”
“Because if he is, I swear, I’ll-“
“He means, hello I’m John Watson,” Irene says, loudly, after heaving a sigh.
“Not…exactly. Victor. Well. He fell in love with someone else.”
. And that audition was the day that I started to find out that all the bullshit in the press was just that. And I fell in love with you all over again.”
John looks at her blankly.
who studies cadavers and went to uni at fifteen. I’m just…Sherlock, I suppose. It’s simpler, with them.”
by Arsenius Bode (predictable)
“Exactly. But back to important matters, since we’ve already interrupted." Irene approaches Sherlock, phone first. "Sherlock! John Watson's elusive, mysterious dancer Sherlock Holmes. My loyal followers are ever so curious about you.”
Sherlock holds him tighter.
,” Sherlock clears his throat. “I couldn’t help but notice that aside from being kind and well-spoken, you were also very handsome all of a sudden. So maybe I loved you a bit then, too, because you made it very easy for me to figure out I was gay despite how repulsive I found all the boys at my school.”
With each re-watching, John found ever more consistencies between Mercutio and Sherlock’s own character. Like Mercutio’s simultaneous charm and obstinacy in standing up to Tybalt:
Mrs. Hudson sighs as she brushes off some lint from John’s shoulder and gives it a squeeze. “I’m afraid this decision was made well above my head, John. He’ll perform a few songs solo, join in on two or three of yours, and that’s it. You’ll have separate dressing rooms, of course. It’ll only be the two shows.” John doesn’t respond, and Mrs. Hudson sighs. “Publicity has already gone out, dear.”
“Did you know that the concierge is a dreadful flirt?” Irene lifts a plastic room key in one hand to tap against her lips. “She’s not a bad kisser, though,” she continues, and bounces into the bed beside John with a grin on her face.
“Getting by at Clara’s place while I try and talk some sense into mum and dad. If I can convince Harry to pretend she’s bi, I think we have a shot at getting her home.”
casual.”
Sherlock barely glances at John as he pays for his drink without a single word.
Sherlock folds his arms defensively across his chest. “Yes.”
“Mmmmm….time for more sex?” John asks groggily, stretching out his limbs as he blinks his eyes open. Sherlock’s face is hovering inches above his own, a fond smile on his face.
Dog-John loves the park. It’s embarrassing to think about how excited he gets in this form, but emotions like that don’t translate so well when he’s a dog. For now, he is content to yip and run and catch and trot around with the other dogs.
. I’m an adult, I can decide who I-”
with a link beneath.
“Not like the others.” Sherlock clarified, matter-of-fact. “When I met you, I thought you were just some jock who’d been dragged backstage by his girlfriend kicking and screaming.”
“Uncomfortable, but expedient.”
“No,” Sherlock says.
Holmes grabs a bottle of water and unscrews the cap, while John admires the line of his throat as he takes a few gulps. Just as Holmes approaches the front of the bleachers, he directs his eyes deliberately towards the pair of them, leans his head back, and pours the remains of the water all over himself.

“I’ve told you before I’m perfectly happy to help you pay your tuition. When Harry had that apprenticeship with the Wizengamot I paid some of her expenses.”
Anderson stumbled through his lines as usual. Stanley didn't do a half bad job, honestly. Not his fault Shakespeare wrote such incomprehensible plays. What the hell was a bow of lath? Or a crowkeeper?
“--a few weeks. I know.”
“You have a type. And it’s tall, dark, and aloof.”
“What?” John asks, eyes still shut as he unconsciously mirrors the smile on Sherlock’s mouth, trying to persuade him back to snogging with little nips and pecks. Sherlock breaks into a full-blown giggle and John finally settles down on his heels, opens his eyes to ask—
“That good?” she asks, and bursts into laughter. John turns beet red, and buries his face in his hands.
“What, you can’t read it on me?” John asks. Some of the tension eases from the room as he smiles. John approaches him with the kit and lifts Sherlock’s chin to inspect the small cut on his face. “Christ, that utter
“That was twenty minutes ago.”
“Good. Make sure he knows. Your mother and I want to meet him soon.” Apparently satisfied by the short conversation, he heaves himself from the couch, batting away the help Sherlock tries to offer. Sherlock listens as he makes his way slowly up the stairs.
Sherlock hums, stretches out a crick in his neck, and ignores him. With a sigh, John gathers his bags and prepares to depart the plane. When they reach a stop, John exits to find an enormous purple bus waiting for them.
John licks his lips. “If you come up to my flat, I could explain better,” John starts.
trusted her. If I’d told her I was bi, I have no doubts it would’ve ended up in the press along with the details of our sex life and my sister’s drinking habit. Would’ve been front page news and I wouldn’t have been able to come out on my own terms like I did. So, I thought I loved her. But I didn’t
“John, could you do me a favor?” Molly asked, shifting at his side. She and John were sitting in the balcony together, watching as Sally hypnotically mopped the stage floor for the opening night performance.
He makes a handsome dog, he thinks, smug. He’s a tan German Shepherd with the same blue eyes that he has as a man, and nearly as big as he is as a human. His dog form has grown from a pup just as John has.
Molly gives Sherlock some preposterous advice, and a visitor comes to town.
Just as he allowed himself to look back at the object of his thoughts, Sherlock looked straight up to where John sat, smirked slowly, and winked.
“What?”
When stacked up against all the times John hadn’t done anything suspicious, he thinks his record is pretty good. But he is dating
* * *
John nods, trying to maintain a serious expression. “That is the literal dictionary definition, yes.” (Sherlock had speed-read a single book in the section of Flourish and Blotts dedicated to non-magical parents and partners before declaring that he was ready for more advanced material and striding towards the nearest clerk to ask where he could find books on transfiguration theory.)
Beware teenage insecurities and POV shifts.
Slowly, like handling something delicate and precious, John brings his nose to brush alongside Sherlock’s, a chaste nuzzle as he breathes in his scent. “I love you
John rests his head atop Sherlock’s, and breathes him in. If that’s the case, then John can’t wait to take their perfect slice of fantasy back into the real world.

John can't help but giggle, long and infectious, until Sherlock joins in. Once Sherlock’s all patched up and his blush has faded to a sweet pink, John wraps a careful arm around his shoulders and tows him back out towards the rugby pitch. “C’mon, mate, practice is almost over and you can tell him yourself. D'you know, I think I’m going to keep you around. Hardly anybody in this town is LGBT etc, or if they are, they are

Is Johnny with you? Put me on speakerphone! Wait! Do you have Facetime?” Victor’s excited voice slurs through the speaker as Sherlock switches on the video feed on and exchanges another confused look with John.
Even though apparition is instantaneous, John still has enough time to see Irene roll her eyes.
Sherlock takes his drink and quietly leaves the shop.
“Don’t avoid the question, John.”
So, yes, there were the mechanics to work through. But flirting was flirting, and John could flirt as naturally as a dragon took to fire. And it was
. Remember when you suddenly decided they chewed too loudly?”
When Greg called a hold, Sherlock collected himself before looking up behind the light that he knew John to operate, and winking.
“Seriously, lads, there’s no time for that!” Lestrade says as he begins to usher them out towards the exit. “We’ve gotta get on the road if we’re going to make it through traffic. Opening band can only stall so long if we're late.” He holds up a garment bag. “Sherlock, you’ll be changing in the back-seat.”
a little unfair, considering a mutual love of John Watson was the reason Sherlock and Molly became friends all those years ago.

“Wipe that hopeful look off your face, Johnny-boy! Lady Capulet only has a few scenes. I’ll have plenty of time during rehearsals to stop in and annoy you here.” She winked, still glowing from the news.
A look of surprise crossed John’s face. “Yeah, that’d be good of you. She seemed a bit upset... She cares about you, you know.”
The sex is soft that night in a way it often isn’t between two randy young men. Fingers lace between Sherlock’s own, calluses brushing against his palms, and this contact somehow feels more intimate than anything else. After an age of gentle, unrelenting pleasure, Sherlock’s climax hits him like a tidal wave, spreading through his body afterwards until he’s limp and drowsy, and slurring his words. John wraps a spare blanket around him and tells him to sleep. He’s out like a light.

blushed at its eponymous song) and are halfway through “True Blue,” they’re both panting. A slower number comes on, and, grinning mockingly, John pulls Sherlock in by the hand and waist for a slow dance. Sherlock’s breath catches at the feel of John’s strong hands on his body, at the feel of John’s muscles working under his fingertips.

John sits up. “Things not going well with Riya and Aiden?” he asks, referring to the couple downstairs that Bill has been fooling around with.
But John is nervous. Because Sherlock moving on means it’s time for the next part of his plan: to begin showing Sherlock how much he cares about him. To, with utter and complete sincerity,
“I thought. And. I want you in my life. Every day. For a long time. I wrote a whole stupid lovesick song about how I’d follow you anywhere, for Christ’s sake. So just let me know if this is too much too soon, but I thought maybe I could…sort of… follow you to Oxford? If you’d let me?”

John is sighing over his pitiful list when his phone rings, Sherlock’s name flashing on the screen. Taking a deep breath to gather his courage, John answers.
John smiles wryly. “I don’t know what you could possibly be talking about, Conan. Would you remind me?” There are laughs from the audience.
Sherlock scoffs, eyes not quite focused as they glance towards the pub. “That’s just a broken-down shop. What do you mean, ‘we’re here?’” A wrinkle appears between Sherlock’s brow as he says thoughtfully, “Do you know…I lost a criminal here, once. I was chasing him through London and he just…disappeared.”

“Would you look at that? My seat’s right next to yours!” John says, feigning surprise.
“Hey,” Sherlock manages to nod back. God, this is terrible and awkward.
John had shown up three hours earlier with a bottle of wine in each hand, graduation cap perched (somewhat crookedly) on his head, declaring that he’d had enough of his parents and Harry for the night. Sherlock has had wine before, at his cousin’s wedding and family dinners, but he’s never been properly buzzed. He’s beginning to see the appeal.
“Mm?”
“You’re the one who said you’d never had a proper date before. I wanted to give you the authentic experience,” John teases, bumping his shoulder against Sherlock’s. “It’ll be fun. There’ll be beer, I’ll smoke you at bowling, and you can check out my arse when I bend over to pick up bowling balls.”

Mrs. Hudson would give him an earful for this later, of course. She allowed this kind of experimentation in rehearsals, in the name of ‘fully exploring our artistic limits,’ but she also knew that this was a school play. Still, why not have a little fun for now?
John couldn’t. He squeezed his eyes shut, and pretended this wasn’t happening.
The door opens, and there’s Sherlock’s beautiful face, eyebrow raised and smirk in place. “Really John? Oscillating on the pavement?”
Hands on his hips as he looks around the room, Sherlock decides he’ll just have to be a little creative tonight. Resolved to make the best of this, he starts pulling open boxes and setting the scene. When he’s done, several duvets and every pillow he can find are stacked to make a comfortable cushioned space in the middle of the empty room, and the large window overlooking Oxford is lined with lit candles. He thinks about plucking apart the flowers he bought and spreading the petals, but decides that’s too much.
“Um, yeah. James, Sholto. He’s on the rugby team with me?”
Hazy and satisfied, John has enough presence of mind to clean them up as best he can before dropping off to sleep, Sherlock’s limbs curling around John like an affectionate Devil’s Snare.
“I thought we were taking things slow?” John pants, gently and ineffectively pushing at Sherlock.
to be subtle about checking out his arse in front of the children, won’t you?”
Sherlock pulled back a hair, enough to gasp, “John.” John captured his lips once again, but Sherlock was undeterred. They settled for a volley of brief words and soft nips and licks. “Wait…I shouldn’t…what about…you can’t…Mary!” At last Sherlock pulled fully away. His face was flushed and the haze in his eyes was clearing rapidly.
“Your fourth theory was that I was a time-traveler,” John teases.
“But what about Mrs. Hudson? If she owns the Speedy’s on Baker Street, then who owns the wizard bit?” Sherlock asks.
Fuck! I mean fuck! I can’t do this!” John whines, interrupting the bickering going on across the room. “What do I do? This is hopeless, I don’t know how to date a Muggle!”
John grins. “Diagon Alley, of course.”
John smirks. “Don’t like being upstaged, Victor?”
“Would you believe me if I said it’s mostly an image? All that ‘bad-boy’ nonsense?”
you…” he looks as stuck as he sounds, and twice as frustrated. The hopeful ball in Sherlock’s stomach glows that much brighter as John takes a shuddering breath and looks at the ceiling. Is John finally going to-?
He rolls his eyes. “Go on, then. Wake Mike, then we can all go and kidnap Irene from her shift in an hour. Go to Diagon for a drink together.”
“No.”
Tentatively, Molly asks, “What’s ‘usual,’ for John, then?”
With a sudden growl, Irene shoves John off the shop floor and into the storage room. It’s not much wider than a hallway, and there isn’t room to swing a Kneazle, so John stumbles over the cluttered stock, barely staying on his feet as Irene crowds in behind him.
Bill guffaws, while Irene and Mike have the courtesy to stifle their amusement.
“Bloody hell,” John says, shaking his head. “How am I the famous one? That was
They’ve touched on Victor briefly in conversation before, but John hasn’t gotten any more detail than what Irene had been willing to share: they were together a long time when they were young, until the relationship ended and Sherlock, apparently broken-hearted, swore off dating. Until John.
Sherlock tells him about the index he’s created so that one day he’ll theoretically be able to predict the fortunes before he cracks open the cookies. He takes diligent note of John’s fortune (“You already know the answer to the question lingering inside your head”), and wrinkles his nose at his own (“The fortune you seek, is in another cookie”)
Sherlock waved a floppy hand in the space between them. “The cadavers.”
This play was written four centuries ago, it should have been old and dry but the words coming out of Sherlock's mouth sounded absolutely
“You cannot be
“Fine, okay, I get it.” John raises his palms towards Sherlock in assent. “I’m no better at mind-reading than I ever was. Impress me, then.”
Sherlock is turning red. “I had a book about bees, and it said that in every hive there is a queen. So I declared myself the bee prince and wove myself yellow daisy crowns. It was very silly.”
He felt numb, and it had nothing to do with the bruises he’d sustained when John had pushed him to the ground. Pushed him aside so that he could take the bullet
since I’ve had access to a proper lab, I put all sorts of experiments on hold this semester.” Sherlock is biting his lip, and now he’s the one looking away to avoid John’s gaze, although he doesn’t withdraw his hands from John’s. “What about you? Did you have…plans for the new year?”
Snapping out of his reverie, Sherlock looks up at John with fascination lingering in his eyes.
tell him about that. John, you’re too good for the bone saw, I’m using it on Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s dad calls to brag about the new attention he’s getting from his colleagues at the local paper. He listens dutifully as his dad (a man who humored Sherlock's own celebrity crush for years) and indulges him when he reads out Robert Plant’s tweet about the performance for the fifth time.
. Mere hours after his audition, in fact.
“Well for one, he’s completely out of my league.”

“Alright troops, listen up!” John scans the faces before him, waiting patiently for the chatter to quiet. Sherlock likes to call this his Captain Voice. Particularly when he uses it in his too-small bunk. Alas, there’s no time to follow that train of thought at the moment.
“Were you?” Molly sounds really baffled now.
what was happening on stage, mind you. But we’re all mighty curious. I’ve got cards from all your biggest fans.Greg pulled a stack of cards from his jacket and put them into John’s free hand. On the top of the stack was one from Molly, going by the hand-writing and vibrantly hand-colored flowers decorating it. “Molly couldn’t make it,” Greg gestured towards the card in question with a fond chuckle. Silence fell as John flipped through the cards. Nothing from Sherlock.
Irene ignores this as she stalks towards John and reaches an arm around him to squeeze his shoulders. “You should come over to meet him sometime. John - my

Like the old barn door that creaks open when there isn’t wind, or the mural inside the canteen that Mrs. H swears up and down

Irene sighs, put-upon. “Don’t I know it. You going to be okay to rehearse?” John nods, so she offers an elbow, and John links his own through it, following as she pushes through the stage door.

John takes Sherlock to the dodgy bowling alley he remembers visiting eons ago with Harry and Irene the first time they traveled through L.A. It’s not the most romantic atmosphere, but John has fond memories here, and they’re less likely to get paparazzi crawling all over them.

Sherlock sits up fully as he feels this conversation take a serious turn. Flicking his gaze between John’s eyes, Sherlock deduces that John’s insecurity is rearing its ugly head. Somehow John is the only man in the world whose ego is
The chant starts slowly, but grows in conviction and volume. “
“Magic can be a big shock to Muggles,” says the portrait of Bill’s great Uncle Guillaume from against the opposite wall. Sherlock shrieks and dives off of the couch for cover, knocking over the glass of water in the process and shattering it.
“Yes, actually. My uncle’s ex-military. I go to the shooting range with him whenever he’s in town.”
know as well?” asks Sherlock, outraged. “How many people has Irene told?”
. With Victor’s arms around his waist, moving away when John gets too close on movie nights, these past months.
John snorts as he looks down the hall to see the side of Mr. Holmes’s head, his gaze directed at the telly as he flips through stations. With a glower, Sherlock pulls John into his bedroom and firmly shuts the door.
John shrugs, grinning. Sherlock scoffs and firmly returns to his work, although he looks like he’s trying to hide a smile.
Oddly, Irene pinches the bridge of her nose and heaves a pained sigh. “Yes, darling, it is. But that movie was made in the 1980s. Nobody dresses like that anymore.” John frowns as he looks down at the tatty red plaid shirt, faded denim jacket and combat boots. Without another word, Irene starts pulling off his layers until John’s left in a long-sleeved white tee-shirt and dark jeans. He makes a discontented noise when she takes his gloves as well. “…Besides, if you’re anyone in that film, you’re the Jock.”
Just before closing time, Sherlock packs up his things and leaves the shop without a word. After staring after where he’d disappeared for a moment, John chases him out onto the pavement.
?” Johns asks, disbelieving. Irene shifts so that John and Sherlock will both be in her frame.
Sherlock wanted to scream, but couldn’t.
“Fine, you do it then,” Sherlock says and thrusts the knife towards her. Rolling her eyes, Molly steps up to the counter and begins to dice efficiently through the beets with scary accuracy. Sherlock watches in a mixture of horror and mild awe.
John knew. “Of course, Molls. What do you need me to do, exactly?”
John’s eyes were wide with…something. Not disgust, anyways, so Sherlock took a risk and went on: “You didn’t have to. I can tell just by looking at you that you’re a med student in London, working your way through a medical degree with minimal student loans. You have an alcoholic younger sibling who you worry about and are estranged from your parents.” Sherlock watched John’s jaw dropping incrementally with every word spoken. The words kept coming, explanations this time (second hand trainers, engraved phone, supplementary first aid kit and the ease with which he used it when the children scraped themselves up). Eventually Sherlock ran out of explanations and was forced to let the silence blanket itself over them.
Sherlock doesn’t need to look at the target to know that it’s hit its mark. He doesn’t need to hear the deafening cheers. John smirks, looks directly at Sherlock, and winks.
Sherlock’s fabulous hair. John suspected his face had gone a bit dreamy because Mary’s eyes narrowed.
coffee shop in the middle of
"Standby Watson, we're coming up to a big speech. Get ready to spot Sherlock." Greg spoke through the microphone.
Pleased, and trying very hard not to think about his mother and John in the same room, Sherlock snuggles into his duvet and rewinds the show to watch again.
John inspects the curly green vine that’s wrapped loosely around Sherlock’s finger. It has the bud of a flower at the end of it. Yellow, and looking ready to open at any moment. John shuts his eyes in disbelief, because he suddenly knows exactly what this is.
John is more careful with him as he lowers Sherlock down onto the bed and crawls on top of him. Sherlock doesn’t seem the least bit nervous, but John, at least, is mindful that this is only Sherlock’s second time ever being this intimate with someone.
There’s a thump, and a clatter from the other side. “Oops.”
. It’s not as powerful as it would’ve been with a wand, but it’s enough to keep Sherlock in the bed beside him, and that’s all that matters. “There are some perks to dating a wizard, Mr. Holmes.”
“John, this is Greg! Greg, John. You two have fun!” Mary dashed off, leaving John facing ‘Greg’ and trying to remember just how he’d got here.
“Hello?”
John curses loudly and throws a vicious silencing charm at Gil, annoyed by his poor timing.
“Brilliant. Hold on tight.”
and Irene knew it. Irene had
John widens his eyes and clenches his jaw at Irene, trying to telegraph the words
Then the pleasingly low rumble of James Sholto’s voice joins the conversation. “Back from the car, yes. I was only gone a moment. Who are you talking to, love?”
Sherlock fiddles with the tattered ends of his scarf when John releases his face. “Even if it’s about Victor?”
John gapes. “How are you so okay with this?” John asks.
“Yeah I know about you two,” Victor rolls his eyes. “We had a huge fight over it but that was like, two weeks ago.”
The blonde lady on the other side of the counter doesn’t seem to mind, though. She smiles shyly at John when he glances towards her. When he thinks Irene isn’t looking, John boils the water with magic and passes the woman her tea across the counter. “Thank you, um, John?” she glances down at his name tag. “I’m sure you’ll get the hang of it soon.” She smiles meaningfully at him as she drops something in the tip jar and takes her leave.
“It’ll be okay.”
“So you didn’t sleep with him?”
“John Watson.” It was nothing but a whisper. All at once Sherlock surged forward and fastened his lips to John’s in a bruising, inelegant kiss. John blinked as he processed what was happening. Just as his mind caught up with his body, Sherlock pulled away.
John nods, taking a sip from his pumpkin juice.
“Your usual?” Irene asks him.
“In a few hours. The neighbors… said they would...” her voice trails off, and Sherlock decides to leave her in peace until their tea is ready. He goes through the motions mechanically. Tries not to worry. Tries not to wish there were someone else here to help, someone who knew better what to do.
John chuckles, a little watery, and starts laying down kisses all over Sherlock’s face. His forehead, a cheekbone, along his jaw and over each eyebrow. “Like this?” he breathes, pressing his love, the enormity of everything he’s feeling, into each firm kiss.
“Fine,” she huffs. “But from now on, you tell me everything. Is there any
James rolls his eyes. His boyfriend may be a shameless flirt, but James knows now that John wouldn’t betray him. Even if it had taken about a year of John telling him so for James to start believing it. Now, they have been together more than two years and James thinks he’s the luckiest bloke in their school. Plenty of people, of all genders, agree.

for you to be honest with me about yourself.”
Sherlock smiles, small but genuine. “I know I haven’t called you or mum in a while...”
Towards John laid endless frustration, but Sherlock kept going back for more.
John chuckles, a soft, sweet thing. “Open your eyes.”
“That’s offensive, John. You’re better than that,” Mary said sharply. She refused to hear John use words like that to describe his sexuality. John hung his head, defeated. Mary continued, “Besides, I might have to

When Sherlock glances over at him, John meets his gaze smugly, challenging.
“…Okay.”
“Oh my God, are you alright?” John asks, bending to help him gather his things. When he offers the man the phone’s battery, he keeps his curly head ducked down, not moving. Very slowly, the dancer tilts his head up only to blink at John.

Harry sighs. “Sorry, Mum.”
Greg was interrupted by Mary’s cry of “Sherlock! Congratulations, dear!” John’s head whipped around. Mary was friends with Sherlock?
“Ah. How was your day?” he asks, then immediately realizes they’d spent the entire day in the same place. He blushes.
The next day (the day of Mid-Summer Campfire, Sherlock’s brain screams at him the second he reaches consciousness) is busy. The morning and most of the afternoon are spent packing up all the campers who are leaving while keeping an eye on those who will stay. The parents are tedious, but Sherlock the goodbye hugs aren’t

“Mine?”
“Shan’t. It’s called Operant Conditioning, and you might know about it if you’d decided to go to uni like I did. Kate does the same thing to train her cat, except she uses a spray bottle.”
“Molly didn’t say anything about—Oh, never mind.” Sherlock shivered as he felt John’s hands accidentally brush the bare skin of his back. John extracted his hands and smoothed down Sherlock’s collar.
On Monday morning, Mike had given John his spare old mobile phone that was already equipped with a case that repelled atmospheric magic, and John had wasted a full hour agonizing over how to start the conversation before settling on something simple.
“Yes. Weren’t you listening to what I said before, John? No one
The thing is, Sherlock had ‘blown up’ Stamford’s science lab. Just a little bit. Barely more than singed, really. Everyone was just being
The hours at work before Sherlock appears are excruciating.
John chuckled as he watched the two of them dance wildly around the stage, falling into an rapid, bouncy waltz. He was only disappointed that his new friends wouldn’t be joining him backstage after all. He shouldn’t have worried.
“You okay?” John asks before he remembers that they’re not supposed to be in here.
“Sherlock, you know Mike from St. Bart’s already,” Irene says. “And this is Bill Murray. We were all in the same year at school, with John.” That they had. One from each house. An unusual group of friends they’d made, back at Hogwarts.
“Oh! Right. Um. Well.”
“Doesn’t matter. Tomorrow morning, you’re taking the Tube in with me
“Yes, John,” Sherlock answers, tearing his mouth away from John’s neck to look him in the eye. His eyes are smoldering and his hair is already a mess from John’s fingers running through it. “I remember.”
The audience shrieks, and the number of cell phones in the air filming them seems to double instantly.
As John begins to sing, he pulls the hood back from his face, and strips off the parka. With every measured step he takes towards the camera, another layer of clothing is removed. A windbreaker, several jumpers, a zip up hoodie. Color starts to bleed in, so slowly that you almost don’t notice it, as the jib sweeps around John.
“What? Why me?”
Irene pouts at Mike. “He’s acting like a pureblood idiot.”
Sherlock takes a deep breath, glances at John before returning his gaze resolutely to his lap. “Oh, you know,” he says gustily. “He went to uni. I waited for him to come back, but...”
“We do a Shakespeare every autumn,” Greg steered their way back into the conversation as he stepped slightly closer to Molly. “This year it’s Romeo and Juliet. Rehearsals start as soon as auditions get decided, which should be next week if Mrs. Hudson finds what she likes. Looks like a good group auditioned this year, a lot of familiar faces. Speaking of which, there’s our Romeo!”
Bit Not Good
“Sorry. Too boring?” John asks, face hot.
John starts by vanishing any glass or contaminants from the gash with a murmured disinfecting spell. Then he begins to heal, guiding Sherlock’s flesh as it knits neatly back together, a soft white glow illuminating the tip of his wand. Sherlock gasps, and John looks up briefly to meet Sherlock’s eyes, wide and amazed. “John,” he whispers. “How are you- this isn’t-“
“Yes, I know. But they wouldn’t tell me anything! Just information that was on the news already.” Sherlock’s frustration rolled off of him in waves, to John’s amusement. “I couldn’t see

Sherlock began to speak. His bearing, tone, and rhythm were all poise and precision. John began to
Sherlock hums as the song winds to an end and the shop is left in silence. Sherlock ducks to plant a kiss on the corner of John’s mouth and releases him. “Dinner? We could…” Sherlock bites his lip, apparently nervous. “order takeaway and eat it, um, upstairs? If you wanted.”
“Is that a new song?” Sherlock quickly uses John’s surprise to his advantage and snatches the open notebook lying in front of John’s seat. “
John turns to glare at his sister. “You told her about Sherlock?” he hisses, leaning across the table.
“What?” John asked, turning around to look. He winced at the movement, still feeling sore from yesterday’s ‘family discussion,’ as his dad had put it. Jeff Hope walked past, slouched and aloof as ever, his prematurely-balding head tucked deep into a hoodie. When he reached the other end of the corridor and left, John turned back to Sherlock. “Something about that guy creeps me out.”
“For Annie.” John beams up at him. “C’mon, I made the sound bloke pull a violin when I heard that you were coming back on the tour, just in case.”
John stares.
John clutches a hand to his chest dramatically. “You would choose Victor Trevor over me? That ponce doesn’t even write his own lyrics!”
“Shoot for that chair, off to the side,” Sarah suggested. John aimed the body of the spotlight before flicking on the lamp. It hit its target, dead center. Sarah gaped. “Lucky shot. Definitely. No way you’re that good at it without any practice. Okay, Mrs. Hudson just walked in. Aim for her.” John did so, and the director’s arm immediately came up to shield her eyes as she squinted up at the bright light suddenly in her face. John switched the light off. “Sorry, Mrs. Hudson!” he yelled, grinning.
When they arrive all John can process is an explosion of neon and sequins. “Is this a gay bar?” he asks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Actually, I wanted to talk to you about something.” Sherlock dares to glance up at John and sees his starlted expression at the seriousness of Sherlock’s tone.

Bill finds another dog-owner to chat up quickly. Obligingly, John trots over to them and nudges behind the woman’s knees, causing her to stumble right into Bill’s arms. He’s sits beside them innocently as Bill winks at her and apologises for John.
Sherlock hums as he lays out the case and prepares his bow. “I’ve discovered that Flight of the Bumblebee does a decent job of relieving pre-performance jitters.” Not as well as John or Molly would. But they’re not always at his side to get him out of his head and back on his feet.

“Thanks,” Sherlock says. “Keep them coming. And maybe a blueberry scone, later.” Sherlock pointedly replaces the earbud. The man gapes.

It’s all going according to rehearsal until the music break, when John disappears entirely. Odd. He should be front and center. Glancing to dancers on either side of him, Sherlock doesn’t find confused expressions: only smug ones.
If you're interested in reading a sequel, let me know what show you'd like to see Sherlock star in. Beauty and the Beast? Grease? Les Mis? Something entirely different? :) comment to vote!
Sherlock looks ready to protest.
Sherlock is still blinking sleep out of his eyes when they arrive in Los Angeles and John is put into a cab and whisked away to Conan’s studio. Between that and the day’s concert, there’s no time left for the two of them to have a conversation about the status of their relationship.

things he can do with his mouth, and Sherlock returns the favor.
“Hello, dear,” said a kind-faced woman as she approached John’s bed. “You’ve woken up a few times, do you remember?” She asked him and flicked on an overhead light. She shone a flashlight into John’s pupils one by one and peered into his eyes. “You gave everyone quite the scare! A couple of friends have stopped by. Your young woman even tried to bully her way in earlier.”

“Don’t I get attorney-client privilege?” John asks.
John perks up. He’s been curious about Sherlock’s flat for ages. “Yes, please.”
Molly and Irene have obviously spoken to James without him about all this, because soon they are shooting him twin pitying looks.
"Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace! Thou talk of nothing." John let out a breath of relief as Anderson interrupted, if with poor Shakespearean grammar. Greg called another hold.
John strokes his hands up Sherlock’s legs and sides, enjoying the feeling of Sherlock shuddering slightly in response. “Well, it’s close enough to London when I need to stop by the offices. And there’s actually another fun thing about being a stupidly rich celebrity. It turns out I have some strings to pull with the university admissions office.”
Sherlock's cut is nasty, but it’s nothing John can’t handle. He pulls his wand from the pocket of his work robes and waits until Sherlock meets his eyes. “Do you trust me?” John asks.
John supposes he must not want to talk to him after he’d bollocksed up yesterday.
“Hello, John. How are you?”
John stares. “But Sherlock wouldn’t—“ John doesn’t finish the sentence. He’s spinning, tilting crooked on an axis. "You and Sherlock- " Maybe…

“I-” was all that Sherlock managed to vocalize before John grabbed him by the hair and tugged him back in. The rest of his sentence was lost to a muffled groan as John’s tongue breached Sherlock’s open mouth. Sherlock’s kiss was messy and graceless and determined. Joy sang through John’s veins as he clutched Sherlock’s curls and nipped at his plush lower lip.
Sherlock inches towards John, fingertips trailing up John’s bicep to the back of his neck. “Aren’t you? We’ve been on six dates.”

John shrugs, coming to balance on the sofa arm beside Mike. “I tried all the usual stuff first. Sweets and flowers and Butterbeer in Hogsmeade. And he was definitely interested. He'd flirt and smile and stand too close. But he kept ditching me for other blokes when things were finally going somewhere. So, I switched tactics. Just played it cool, pretended I wasn't into it anymore. Wasn't interested, you know.” John smirks as he remembers how quickly that had earned Reggie’s full attention.
“Do you trust me, then?”
eyes. And I can't explain how, but I felt this… instant attraction, the moment I saw him.”
Dr. Stamford attempts to look as stern as a benevolent, baby-faced man possibly can. It isn’t terribly convincing.
It’s early morning. So early that there’s not even sunlight leaking through the curtains. John blinks slowly awake, extra warm, something tickling at his nose. Curly hair.
Sherlock’s eyes are still wide with lingering uncertainty, but his nod is sure.
“Don’t be embarrassed. I like them.”
“What do you mean?” he asks absently, as he starts caring for Sherlock’s injuries, dabbing tenderly at the cuts and scrapes, not meeting the boy’s penetrating gaze.
The tension breaks as John and Sherlock share a laugh with James. “Sorry about Victor, he had a bit to drink after we told his parents about us. I took my eyes off of him for five minutes and he’s totally smashed.” On the screen, James rolls his eyes, but Sherlock can see the fondness writ across his features.
Sarah called Stanley out of cast warm-ups, and they spent an hour kicking a football around on stage to let John practice following a target. It was fun, and took enough concentration to keep John interested. But soon enough the rest of the cast filed in and Greg called everyone down to the main level for Mrs. Hudson’s introductory speech.
