After that first case, John had been beside him at every one after. His cane, after that very first case back, had been a non-factor. And John knew Sherlock had been deducing that, if the firm set of his lips and his long fingers steepled beneath is chin were anything to go by. John supposes that he’s been inferring a number of things about him since John’s been back as a daily presence in 221B. And John had been wondering things about Sherlock too.
“It wasn’t great, but it was something. I started seeing a therapist again, a different one, at Harrys’ insistence. So, I suppose I was managing. But I didn’t really start living again until—” he cut himself off. This was a personal moment between him and Sherlock and it didn’t feel right to bring her into this. But, Sherlock, being Sherlock pushed past the boundaries on comfort.
At Johns, non-response Sherlock raises to is feet.  He’s walking towards John slowly, oh so very slowly, as not to startled him. But, honestly, he would have been preferred it if he was walking at his regular high- speed Sherlock pace.
John should have known better. Of course, talking about it just the once wouldn’t be enough for Sherlock. He’d pick and prod at him until he confirmed every theory his impossible mind thought of. He had woken up to several texts from Sherlock, ranging from ‘What Hotel?’ to ‘Which shoes were you wearing?’. He doesn’t text back because by now the messages are several hours old and he doesn’t doubt that Sherlock has already figured out the answers to most, if not all, of them.  He wished, futilely, that Sherlock would let it go. It was in the past and it should stay there, but, he wasn’t naïve enough to believe that it would.
Except it wasn’t. Something was broken between them and John didn’t even begin to know how to mend it. Actually, maybe, he did and he had a feeling Sherlock did too, but he’d be damned if he was going to bring that up of his own free will.
As it turns out Captain John Watson can run from his problems. At least briefly, and John suspects that’s only because Sherlock has allowed him to. He’s avoiding Sherlock to the best of his abilities, which means almost not at all because he can’t stand to be five feet away from the man.
Sherlock texts him about a case and he almost doesn’t go. He doesn’t want the help the man who had faked his death for two years. Who put John through hell and a series of 3 therapists. But Mary, bless her, somehow convinces him to go and John can’t shake the feeling that she’s going to regret thrusting him back into Sherlock Holmes’ orbit.
“And you meant it,” Sherlock presses, his experiment long forgotten. He was facing John again, full undivided attention on him and John feels extremely uncomfortable.
“Sherlock?” his voice comes out broken and breathy. His wide-open eyes are trained on the bridge of Sherlocks’ nose and John can see the tips of his long black eyelashes from his eyes being splayed so largely. “I thought—” he couldn’t finish the sentence and surely Sherlock knew what he thought.
So, John tells him and as he does a very small, vindictive part of himself is glad to see Sherlock squirm. Sherlock can hear with his own two ears, from John’s own mouth the agony he wrought. Though, he tamps down that feeling before it could grow too much.
And although he still hurts about Mary, it’s a dull ache that he hardly ever notices. And even then, he only mourns for the loss of previous friendship and everything he thought he still owed her. But, Sherlock more than makes up for every minute stab of pain with explosions of happiness. John doesn’t think the reverse would be true if he had chosen differently.
“Yeah, okay.” And he’s picking up his coat and running off behind Sherlock before Mary can get in a word in edgewise.
John wanted so very badly to disagree. He loved Mary, he did. She was there for him when everything went to hell. She made him want to start truly living again, she was one of the reasons John was still here today. For a while she was his whole world, it only seemed fair to repay the kindness.
Sherlock huffed and scooted until his head was resting on John’s shoulder, their sides pressed together, “That’s really quite insulting. Honestly what would I do without my blogger?”
John moves forward, not even all that much, and suddenly he’s kissing Sherlock. Mess forgotten the only thing John can focus on is Sherlock's mouth and how warm and soft it is. And Sherlock, he’s kissing him back. His hands had come off the counter and are now fisting into the back of John’s shirt. He’s sloppy and unpracticed, but John doesn’t care. He’s kissing Sherlock and everything feels right. He’s about to move forward, even closer, when it hits him.
John is sure it’s taking every muscle in Sherlocks body to keep him from rolling his eyes as he repeats himself, “I said: I’m sorry.” Sherlock walks towards John and plucks the jacket from his hands, effectively -in Sherlocks eyes- stopping him from leaving.
The only thing that he was certain of that he couldn’t be apart from Sherlock again and he knew that Sherlock felt the same way about John.
John almost chokes on his coffee, “Excuse me?” He subtly looks around the café, luckily not many people are present besides Sherlock and himself.
At that John had to take a moment then decides he has to get up and leave before he does something he’d regret. He’s unhooked his coat and is halfway out the door before Sherlock’s quiet voice stops him.
She’s excited and John lets her hold on to him and talk him into submission. He was worried about the separation but he thinks he’s exhausted enough to sleep to through the night with constantly worrying about Sherlocks whereabouts. He also thinks they could do with a bit of division, they’ve basically been living in each other’s pockets since he’d been back. Besides, John’s trying to work on not tying his entire sense of self into Sherlock’s.
Sherlock wants everyone to know that John is his and he is Johns’. Where John was never really a big fan of PDA before, he basically had no choice with Sherlock. Whether it was lap sitting in a cab or on the underground, hanging off John at restaurants, or even kissing him in the middle of conversation with Lestrade at crime scene. Sherlock had no restraints.
“You can’t leave again,” John thinks this might unfair to ask of him, what with their hectic life, but he can’t help it. Down the road, when they can stand to be away from each other for more than a couple hours, he needs to know that Sherlock won’t go.
Two things could happen if John looked at Sherlock, and he meant really looked at him. Eye contact, in John’s mind, could either make or break them. One, Sherlock would look at him like the weak man John feared he was. Sherlock would look at him like he was a civilian and not the war doctor he thought he should be. He would see him as fragile and unkempt; a ticking time bomb of psychological disorder. He’d see the worst reflection of himself in Sherlock’s eyes and he wasn’t ready for that.
“Mary,” He said her name in tone John couldn’t quite place. John nodded, unwillingly to say more on the matter.
Sherlock beelines for the couch and for a second John’s just stood there, unsure of what to do. So, he does was he always does and heads straight for the kitchen.
It was quiet, for a beat while John tried to compose himself and Sherlock absorbed facts hurled at him. “Tell me how.” Sherlock finally says.
“No,” John says breathlessly. Because honestly with Sherlock this close to his face he’s having trouble thinking clearly. And actually, he’d be a little pissed at being blatantly manipulated like this if he didn’t have the sneaking suspicion that Sherlock needed this confirmation more than he let on.
John doesn’t say anything, just inclines his head to confirm his listening. So, Sherlock keeps talking, “He informed me of your situation and your expressed desired to end your life.”
Eventually, he’d stop going to see Mrs. Hudson in the morning and stopped seeing Lestrade in the evenings. He cut his therapy sessions down to two and then one, claiming he was starting to feel better but really, he wasn’t feeling at all. In the end, he just stopped going completely. He tells Sherlock how he didn’t realize how tangled up his life had been in Sherlock’s. How embedded Sherlock was in his being. He remembers his therapist referring to this a sort of symbolic loss and he remembers telling her it wasn’t just symbolic if he was really gone.
John wonders if this is a new development in light of recent events or if this has been going on since before. Honestly, John wouldn’t be at all surprised if Sherlock following him wasn’t new; Sherlock had no concept of personal space or privacy.
He’s responding to Sherlocks texts with a ‘please stop sending me pictures of decaying eyeballs’ when there’s a knock on his door. He doesn’t know who he was expecting but he certainly wasn’t expecting Mary.
It takes a minute, an eternity, but he does. John gives in. He looks and he was right, immediately looking forward he was met with those all-seeing eyes. Sherlocks eyes were hard, trying to make John understand. John focuses on what’s the same: that familiar blue, those long black eyelashes. It’s what he remembers from the time before the fall. When he could look at Sherlock unabashed.
John’s looking up, down, right, left, anywhere but Sherlock, “This ridiculous, let go me, Sherlock. I have to—”
John let out a deep sigh, leaning the back of his head on the dresser alongside Sherlock’s. He wasn’t gone, he just hand Sherlock style errands to run. He didn’t leave John, he wasn’t dead. John didn’t have to go to that place again. Because he was sure that if history repeated itself he couldn’t endure it.
It seemed that this morning Mary had gotten over her infatuation of John’s return and was now hounding him about where he had been, why had he ditched her at the café, and was this going to be a regular occurrence. And John felt bad about it sure; the way he always felt bad when he put Sherlock above his significant others. She wanted him to try harder to balance his life with Sherlock with his life with her. And John didn’t want to have to try this hard. But, he loved Mary, he really did.
John doesn’t know what to do. What is he supposed to do, he’s spent all this time and effort loving her in a way he doesn’t. It feels wrong to him, like she’s been of use to him and now he doesn’t need her anymore. He doesn’t know if he can just discard her like that.
Sherlock back’s up, releasing his hold on John face and John opens his eyes again. Staring into the blue that he loved so much. Sherlock’s mouth was set in a firm line and his brows were furrowed.
He looks at Sherlock and wonders if it’s a matter of who he can’t live without or who is the smart choice.
“I want to tell you something,” a look of frustration passes across his face and John can’t help but think he looks adorable. “However, even with my vast vocabulary, I cannot seem to find the right word.”
“It’s not that,” John says, “It’s just…” He doesn’t want Sherlock to worry, but he doesn’t know if he can get himself to look at him.
John can’t help the bubble of laughter that makes its way from his throat, “You don’t have to announce yourself, Sher—”
And, suddenly, he wants to be done, he really does. This is a too emotionally taxing conversation for this early in the morning. Plus, he has to go to work soon, he’s already missed too many days running around London with Sherlock catching bad guys. So, John says this and the conversation is over, just like that, with not fight from Sherlock at all.
John narrows his eyes and closes his laptop. Sherlock was not going to do this to him, he didn’t get to analyze whatever it was he was analyzing about John to think he'd attempt suicide again. John wasn’t going to let him evaluate his every move as if John was a danger to himself. “What is this about Sherlock? If you think I’m prepared to do something like that again then—”
After work John goes to Mary’s. He thinks owes her that, not to mention he doesn’t think he can take seeing Sherlock tonight.
But none of that mattered to Sherlock, when he’d turned the last corner and caught up to John he was, in John’s opinion, quite upset. Bypassing the criminal immediately, which Sherlock never does because the likes to gloat in their faces like the drama queen he is, and grabs John’s chin in his hands.
He should answer it he knows, but he supposes he could spare Mary a few Sherlock-less moments. No matter how he was aching to talk to him.
“How long did you know?” John doesn’t need him to specify more, they’ve been avoiding the topic so long it seems to be the only thing they can think about.
Which leads to now, both of them sated and sweaty underneath a sheet. Sherlock on his side pressed up against John and John on his back with his eyes closed.
If they stand too close together at the crime scene no one mentions it. Though, John does see Lestrade give them an odd as Sherlock places a hand on John’s lower back when he crouches to inspect the body. And if he’s really paying attention he’d notice Donovan huff in disbelief when Sherlock stops ranting and raving about the uselessness of the Yard at John’s touch.
That’s how he ends up several hours later drowning his sorrows in a mug of pitch black coffee. He would have gone to a pub, but he remembers his therapist telling him alcohol and despair shouldn’t go, no matter how they longed to be together. He couldn’t go to Mary’s because she was still waiting for an answer he couldn’t give her yet. He couldn’t go to Sherlock’s because the man would still be asking about his suicide attempt.
“So, I’m just stood there, in the middle of the room, gun in my hand. Staring at my phone like it’s personally offended me and all I could think was ‘I can’t kill myself on my sisters’ birthday’. That wouldn’t be fair to Harry, having to deal with all that. So, I put my gun away…” John’s eyes are still staring at his hands on the table. He wonders what Sherlock thinks of all this. John is sure Sherlock could understand his reasons of attempting suicide, but not so sure if he’d understand his reasons for not going through with it. “I stayed with Harry for a few days after her birthday and thought about trying again. But, then it was someone from calling me to cover their shift, so I couldn’t do it that day. Then a finale of a program I had been watching or a conference I had to go to. Just little things like that, things that pushed me to keep living another day.”
Or, he could look at Sherlock and see that something had changed. He could see a look in his eye that would ruin John. Once you know something you can’t unknow it and if Sherlock knew John’s most horrible secret he would look at him differently. He’d look at him like he looked at people on the street or individuals on case. With a certain look of disgust, disinterest, and disappointment, the look he gave when everyone else were measly, boring human beings who ultimately bored him. John doesn’t think he could handle that look.
And John’s not sure about what it is that Sherlock just gets about him, but it suddenly clicks for him. “Oh.” Sherlock’s mouth forms the perfect little circle.
John’s just about had enough of it and tells Sherlocks so. Which, of course, Sherlock doesn’t take well. Soon enough they’re hurling barbs at one another, hitting where it hurts. They’re unleashing months of pent up anger, John at Sherlock’s leaving and
And we're almost to the end. Only a chapter or two left. Thanks for reading and pleases leave a kudos, it motivates me!
Before John can finish his sentence Sherlocks’ mouth is on his and John’s laughter dies on his lips. Sherlock’s moving hesitatingly and awkwardly, but his lips are just as soft as John remembers. He lets Sherlock lead for a while before placing both his hands on the back of Sherlock’s neck, pulling him further down. Then John’s kissing him slow and deep, running his tongue over Sherlocks bottom lip, making him gasp. Sherlocks hands find purchase on Johns waist as he steps closer, their bodies now completely flush against one another.
And John thinks that this why he loves Mary, her brashness and her no-nonsense attitude. She was there to fix him when he was broken, she helped pick up the pieces that fell away when Sherlock left. She made John stop going to the motions and actively participate in his own life again. He would think, that if not for hard edge he sometimes caught in her demeanor she’d remind him of Sherlock.
Sherlock looks dazed when his opens his eyes, staring at John longingly. His lips are a bit kiss swollen and John thinks he could stand here and look at him forever. But he doesn’t, he pulls Sherlock by the hand into the kitchen claiming they need to eat.
She kicks him out after he fails to answer the last question. He can’t picture himself just being a husband to this woman anymore. He can’t picture coming home to her every night after a long day at the surgery. And he loves her, he wants to love her just like he used to, but he doesn’t think he can anymore. Everything he’s wanted for them has gone up in flames because of Sherlock and he has no idea how much that scares him.
Sherlock shoulders his way past the small crowd and maneuvers himself through the sea of tables until he’s standing directly in front of John. “You weren’t answering your phone,” he says in lieu of an actual greeting. His mouth is set in a hard line and his right hand playing with his phone in his pocket.
Now, he was looking -not for the first time- at Sherlock’s chin, unable to meet his eyes. “I asked you to stop being dead,” he spoke softly. He was vaguely surprised at the amount of effort it took to keep the tremble out of his voice. He shifted the grip on the cane, the one he hadn’t had to carry not long after meeting Sherlock and he supposes that’s where Sherlock’s gaze was now. Analyzing John’s dependence on the once obsolete object.
And now Sherlock’s not looking at him, his hands are once again anxiously tapping against his thighs and John cannot figure out why this bothers him so much. It’s not as if John flung himself off a building right in front of Sherlock. “Are you—You wouldn’t be doing this on purpose, would you John?”
“Kill yourself, John,” Sherlock clarifies himself like John’s an idiot. He’s trying to sound like he’s unaffected, but John doesn’t miss the way his fingers are thrumming in a blur on the sides of the table. Joh tries to think back and recall if Sherlock had this nervous tick before, or was it a new addition, like so many things were in their rebudding relationship.
John knows exactly what he means, exactly what he’s trying to say. There’s no word, he knows, nothing to describe this feeling.
As john managed to let some rational thought in his brain, he supposed Sherlock was doing this to show John that he was here and he wasn’t going to leave. There was an apology in the hands that clutched his knees and a reassurance in the breath that brushed his ear.
A new addition of their tentatively rebuilding relationship is that they can’t very well seem to let each other out of sight. Though still not meeting each other’s eyes, and John was now certain that Sherlock wasn’t trying to meet his either—his chin was angled wrong and his head was tilted in quite not the right direction, they had to be in each other’s space or ear shot constantly. Like now, Sherlock’s in the kitchen fiddling with some experiment while John is sat in his chair-which popped back up sometime last week- reading, which meant his back would have been turned to Sherlock. But, as soon as Sherlock meandered his way to kitchen, John’s body and eyes tracked his. Sherlock stood up and John sat straighter, his eye coming to rest somewhere on Sherlocks right shoulder. As Sherlock took the few steps it took him to get to the kitchen, John angled body his more and more so that his chest was lain against the arm of the chair, his book dangling in the air in front of him. And Sherlock, who normally performed his experiments stood at the right side of the table, shifted everything over to the left. So, now he could see John’s head peeked out from over the side of the chair.
She’s pointing the menu at him now looking him hard in the eyes, “But, don’t you think for a single second John Watson that you’re going to get rid of me that easily!”
Mary sits down across from John and her smile drops a bit as they both hear his phone vibrate against the metal chairs. “Who would have thought I’d have to ambush you at your job for you to spend time with me,” she has a sort of contemplating look on her face.
It takes three weeks for John to notice the change. At three in the morning, John's begging Sherlock to sleep. "It's not right, Sherlock, it's just not healthy."
Sherlock's eyes turn darker. "Tempting," Sherlock mutters as he runs his hand down the front of her torso, down the center until his fingers are running right over the front of her jeans. Sherlock's eyes flicker up again for approval and John just nods. Sherlock runs his fingers in between her legs over her jeans and watches as John's legs start to turn to jelly just at the insinuation.
"Can I kiss you?" John asks, hovering over Sherlock's lips so closely that their breath is already shared.
John shrugs. "Sherlock would likely tell me if there was, they are his friends more than mine. We've only been recruited once to their facilities and it's likely their newest member that was responsible anyhow. Looks remarkably like Sherlock too, funnily enough."
"What are you trying to say, Sherlock?" John asks in shallow breaths as Sherlock's lips are now hovering directly over his.
John joins him on the other side of the couch, not once taking his eyes off of the detective. "I meant to apologize as well – I didn't mean to make anything more difficult for you to process. I just want…I just want to feel like the person you are in love with rather than an experiment you could finish and get bored with."
"It would have been better if the guy had meant shit-all to me, but yeah it got better after the first bit," John replies, grabbing round Sherlock's waist and flipping them over again, managing by some miracle with the grip on Sherlock's legs to keep them together, feeling as the long legs curl around his back.
Sherlock reaches up and grapples his hands in his own curls, tugging in frustration. John and Sherlock had gone out on case two weeks ago. It was early, John was sleeping it off. John hit his head very hard when one of the culprits tried to tackle him.
"Shhh," John says as he pulls Sherlock close again, kissing again and again like Sherlock's lips are the only thing keeping him breathing. Gripping tightly everywhere on Sherlock's body that he can gain purchase as they kiss, not ready for it to stop. John pulls away again for breath. "Too bad it's a crime scene and we could have to leave at any time," John whispers as he runs his hands up and down Sherlock's torso.
Sherlock kisses John back roughly, passionately. It's all quite new to Sherlock, but all the more brilliant as each sensation is heightened. John pushes Sherlock harder into the wall behind them and grinds their clothed members against one another, eliciting a sharp moan from the detective's lips into his blogger's.
When I first broached the subject, Sherlock seemed frightened. Later I'd find that it wasn't just the case in point that I had amnesia and he figured I would strangle him when I got out of it if he went further. No, it was the man who crumbled at one kiss like a teenager and didn't know what to do. Even without my memory I was the one to guide us this time. I was the one to solve the case.
John doesn't answer with words but with motions, feeling like everything he's doing is somehow right as he undoes Sherlock's zip with his teeth. He pushes away Sherlock's offending final layers of clothing just enough so that if they needed to walk away, Sherlock wouldn't have to be pulling everything back on in a rush. John licks the tip of Sherlock's leaking member first, eliciting a shaky moan from the detective.
"I am not good with small talk, I am only good with the two of us," Sherlock ventures. "Dates are tedious and frightening to me, but if we must."
"I've never been one for desire, never been one to want to do something like I just did," Sherlock murmurs softly before placing a soft kiss against John's lips. When Sherlock pulls away again, he's smiling so gently it's hardly normal for the detective. "I want to know why with you I just want more."
Mycroft is still being difficult, as usual. He doesn’t want me to leave yet, but he doesn’t want me ‘interfering with his work’. I figure if I interfere as much as I can, he’ll be so annoyed, I’ll be on a plane before I know it. There is no reason for me to stick around, he just wants me to suffer. He says ‘he worries about me’, but we all know that’s not remotely true. He just wants to show me who’s in control. Nosy git.
The song came to an end, and the next track was another slow dance. They stopped moving, but John didn’t look worried or shy. Relieved, Sherlock found it was the easiest thing in the word to pull at John’s hands to press their bodies together and settle his hands low on John’s back. He felt John’s arms circle around his neck and his soft hair tickle against his cheek. John sighed softly, his breath grazing Sherlock’s ear.
The potatoes seem to be doing fine, nothing is threatening to explode, so I have some time to think about what to do next. The basics are all covered, so I need to think in the long term. I can’t just sit around and wait here for someone to save me. I have no idea what is going on back home, so I have to rely on myself now.
Back in the rover (just to be safe) with a delicious freeze dried meal (screw rations today, seriously) and listening to the tunes James used to listen to while driving. Classical music, why am I not surprised?
Please, can you take him off my hands, at least until my shift is over? I’ll bring you coffee for a week.
I have just saturated the soil in the Hab with most of the water I had, and I deactivated the atmospheric regulator. That way it won’t pull the water out of the air and the place will be nice and humid. There will be enough condensation to keep the potatoes happy until I’m back.
After a 4 month journey the crew landed on Mars November 7th, and after only 6 days, we had to abort the mission.
Mike: Still, if he finds it and manages to fix it, it could be a means of communication…it might be as simple as cleaning the solar cells. And if he can’t, it’s a good thing he’s not going to Ares IV right now.  I’ll need to call JPL, just in case he manages it. Sherlock, can you come to my office, please?
Mike: Molly works at SatCon, she found the evidence that John is still alive. She’s supervising the satellite images for us now.
Greg will monitor the Hermes, and continue preparing future Hermes flights, as before. However we can always count on his expertise. He knows John the best, I believe.
Sherlock and John looked at the chaos of police cars and officers surrounding the seemingly ordinary house where they had successfully ambushed the suspect in a triple homicide case.
Rovers: both in excellent condition. If only I had somewhere to drive to. Might be good for spare parts, though.
“Know how to jive?” John asked him. Sherlock shook his head, “Not really part of my training,” he answered.
“Thanks, Sherlock,” John answers sarcastically. “But can you just go over it with me one more time? Slowly? Please?”
Now my idea for water is basically to make it from scratch. We all know the recipe, the problem is how to get all the ingredients.
: Yes. It’s been decided that it would cause more stress. They’ve already endured a traumatic experience and they have a long way to go before they are back on Earth. They need their focus.
John is still leaning on the bed, and he can see Sherlock’s eyes, wide and pale, and the freckles on his nose. His desperation from a moment ago vanishes and makes way for hope and determination. He grabs Sherlock by his upper arm and ducks forward to press his lips against the soft skin next to the corner of his mouth before pulling back quickly.
Mike: Well, the Mars Pathfinder was launched in 1996, but we lost contact with both the lander and the rover in ‘97.
“Doesn’t matter. I’ll lead, you’ll get it in no time!” John arranged Sherlock and started to show him some basic steps. It wasn’t that complicated, and soon they were dancing.
I agree that it is the best option we have so far, but I’d like it to be safer. I don’t approve of risking a whole crew for an operation this dangerous. And why should we use the MDV for this? Can’t we make custom craft for a mission like this?
“You’ve clearly demonstrated your ability to set me against him should you wish to do so. That power has to be reckoned with,” I said, shrugging my shoulders.
As I was turning in front of the mirror, the door opened and Holmes entered the bedroom. He stopped in his tracks, giving me a long, appreciating gaze. Then he walked up to me and embraced me from behind.
My Watson joined me, and having reclined on a marble seat, we kissed at leisure. Then languor caught up with us, so we rested, sweating copiously. I savoured John’s scent and the sensation of his skin against mine. In the common rooms it wouldn’t be prudent to gaze overtly at his body glistening with perspiration. Here I didn’t have to restrain myself, admiring the curve of his neck, his chest with a smattering of gold-brown hair, his taut belly, his narrow loins and sturdy legs.
Watson was as prim and dashing as three hours ago, as delectable and tempting in his tightly fit uniform. His posture was impeccable and his gait graceful; only the colour which tinged his cheeks and the shining in his eyes gave away his inebriated state. I could see by his face that his outing was a success.
He had moved to Kensington, having purchased a larger practice. Mycroft had ensured the reliability of his new household and had taken Mrs. Hudson under his wing too. Moran’s people were on the look-out, but as long as I remained dead to the world, the gang posed no danger to those dear to me.
Holmes can safely rely on Watson in any endeavour, even if it’s technically against the law, like detaining a person against their will. Watson’s streak for action shows when Holmes tries to make Milverton show his note-book, and it turns out that Milverton is armed:
“Sherlock, it’s just a friendly invitation. The fellow is bored alone, managing his household. We’ll leave if there’s anything we don’t like.”
I cursed under my breath. No, the toy was a poor substitute. Imagination could never replace the real thing. I removed the toy and glanced at it scornfully. What was John doing now? Probably talking to a tipsy young officer, trying to weasel out the information I had requested. Was the young officer flirting with him? Was some other man’s gaze raking shamelessly along my John’s body? My erection flagged. Gritting my teeth, I brought myself in order and washed the toy. Back in the bedroom, I tossed the toy into the drawer where it belonged and slammed the drawer shut.
Saville approached the clock castle, put the lantern on the drawbridge, and opened the gates of the castle. He had barely reached into the innards of the clock when there was a click of a pistol being cocked and Lestrade sprang forward.
“Good-bye, Doctor,” the Colonel said, shaking my hand at the station. “I see that you’ve found in Mr. Holmes a man after your own heart. God bless you.”
“Checkmate, Holmes,” he said, his bleak grey eyes lighting up triumphantly. “Your weapons won’t help you.”
“Hmm, you have prepared yourself,” John drawled. “Good. Lay yourself down upon the bed, spread your legs, and bend your knees.”
However, were Holmes and Watson apart this time? Having disappeared in America for two years, how could Holmes know that Watson would be available at a given moment to help him? Would Holmes wish to endanger Watson if Watson had nothing to do with intelligence? Would Holmes even bear to be apart from Watson for that long again?
So both BLAN and PRIO were in 1903, and thus we also know for sure that Watson changes the names of clients and places in his published stories for the sake of discretion.
“Middle-sized, shabbily dressed fellows,” he replied. “The one with the knife was rather swarthy with an earring in his left ear. The one who tried to strangle me from behind had a scar across his jaw.”
The Falls were indeed quite impressive. The roar of its torrents would swallow any screams, and the precipitous path which led to it would permit disposal of a body in a most efficient manner. When a Swiss lad overtook us with a written request for John to return to the hotel to attend to an ailing English lady, I became certain. The staging was impeccable, the signature style of the masterful hand. So I released John to hasten back.
“When I followed your directions, you were my commanding officer. Now that the task is completed, you are merely a civilian.”
The moment he left, I exhaled heavily. My prick was rock hard again, pulsing between my legs. I was standing behind the settee, so Watson hadn’t seen the bulge in my trousers. As if he needed to. I could bet he was counting seconds, wondering how long my stubbornness would last. It didn’t last even a minute.
I mean, isn’t it mind blowing? Holmes asks him to get out of his hair, and then deduces that Watson spent the day in the club because he had nowhere else to go. John H. Watson is a cinnamon roll and must be protected at all costs. (Which Holmes did and which resulted in the Hiatus and much angst).
Alright, perhaps ACD’s vision of Holmes mellowed some thirty years after the above mentioned interview, but I think it’s not the case.
The most obvious thing about Dr. Watson was his natural charm. He was attractive physically, with his powerful build, intensely blue eyes, gold-brown hair, and sincere, boyish smile. He must have fully recovered from his misfortunes in Afghanistan, for there was a spring in his step and a general air of robust health about him.
But instead, comforted by John’s scent, I let my thoughts wander, and it brings me to the time just before Moriarty’s downfall. I remember everything in minute detail. As I was drawing my net tighter around Moriarty’s organisation, I tried to involve John as little as possible, for his own safety, until he knew next to nothing about my doings. He sensed that matters were grave and remonstrated with me for overstraining myself. However, he didn’t press me on the reasons, for he is not in the habit of forcing a confidence—a trait of his which is especially dear to me.
“Please, please don’t apologise,” he blurted out as he turned to meet my gaze. “It was so beautiful. I loved it. It’s just… play it another time, when we’re both in a better place?”
department,” Lestrade gasped and nodded. “Very well. He was a dangerous criminal, that Stark Munro, so we would like to look around your house.”
Coughing, I raised myself from the floor, and John helped me to stand up. He was breathing heavily too, still clutching his pistol in his other hand. We gazed at our defeated enemy lying in a heap at our feet. Even unconscious the old tiger was a formidable sight, his sun-weathered face contorted in a ferocious grimace and his big moustache bristled. His dress-clothes seemed strangely appropriate for the occasion, for this was indeed his grand finale.
“The fee is half the price the blackmailer demands. It’s more than enough to cover our rent and provide for a living without a care in the world for a couple of months.”
“Incorrigible,” I sighed. “Very well, your efforts shouldn’t be wasted. You wanted me to fetch Smith? I’ll do that for you.”
This development was indeed vexing, but it seemed even more so for Sherlock. After his return his priorities had shifted, and he tried very hard to keep a balance between work and our personal life.
(1899), and while Raffles and Bunny are partly based on Holmes and Watson, their dynamic reminded me of another ACD’s story:
Wiggins was delivered fast asleep to a small, nondescript house in the dock district of Calais. A potent soporific had been slipped into his beer, but its effects were to be wearing off by that time. I regarded the sturdy young man for a few moments, reminiscing on the days when he had been a gangly, always hungry imp, the first Irregular who later helped to build that formidable street squad. His leadership skills and shrewdness had stayed with him—now, at twenty-three, he worked as a shipyard foreman, had made a good name for himself, and was already happily married and raising two children.
“It hasn’t been performed outside Russia yet,” I replied. “According to the press, it was not a success.”
One day I was on such a ramble, when a carriage arrived at the gate and an agitated footman rushed in.
“Oh, come. You are a highly skilled professional. Those petty police-court conundrums are not your level. You’ve grown out of them long ago.”
I chuckled. The outlook wasn’t too bad. I tested the fellow, and he rang true so far. He was devoted to my brother. He was hot-headed, but didn’t always allow his emotions to reign. There was some hope in that.
, a pretty lady of high society comes to him seeking his help against a blackmailer. She is engaged to a duke, there’s her compromising letter, and she doesn’t have sufficient means to buy it back. So she asks Poirot to negotiate. The blackmailer shows up to Poirot’s flat, but the negotiations prove to be futile. Pretty much a carbon copy, isn’t it?
“You would never have been able to resist the temptation,” Mycroft replied. “The man’s mind is a work of art.”
I suppressed an urge to jump to my feet and pace about the room. We smoked in silence for a while, minutes dragging by agonisingly, and then, at last, the sound of brisk steps came from the hall. I quietly drew a relieved breath, for I would recognise that gait any time, anywhere.
“God, no more gambling, ever,” I muttered as Holmes and I were rattling in a cab to Baker Street. “I shall be damned if I’m in your debt again.”
He put his finger to his lips and motioned me to the opposite armchair. Bewildered, I followed his silent order. Mycroft wrote something on a piece of paper and gave it to me.
“Ah, and Doctor,” Mycroft Holmes called out as I turned to leave. “Regarding your recent article, you mixed up the names of the Moriarty brothers. It was the Professor who was James, not the Colonel. The younger brother is actually your namesake John.”
Somehow the idea of visiting a public venue, even though we had a private room there, wasn’t appealing. Holmes didn’t seem keen on it either. There was another option. I saw the glint in his eye as we came to an understanding. A night in our nook. He slipped his hand under the table and caressed my thigh. We both shivered in anticipation.
He stepped closer to me, until there were mere inches between us, and reached for my cheek with the gentlest of touches. My eyes closed of their own accord. That warm, strong palm slid slowly down my neck and stroked my shoulder tenderly. Then it moved on to my chest and was joined by the other palm to tease my nipples. I quivered, my skin tingling with goosebumps, as John’s hands travelled further down to my belly. My heart hammered wildly and my breath was coming in ragged gasps; I looked at John with heavy-lidded eyes. His face was intense, his whole and undivided attention fixed upon me, just the way I craved. It made me feel drunk. I had to suppress a moan when John cupped my bollocks, squeezing them lightly, and then gave my prick a tentative stroke.
Another trait of the established relationship—Watson knows exactly when it’s better to step in or leave Holmes to his own devices:
He was dressed as a scruffy street photographer. Actually, his attire hadn’t changed much: his worn dusty trousers mismatching with my tweed jacket and his crumpled shirt were now complemented with a gaudy cravat and tinted glasses.
Moving caused him too much pain to hold a spoon, yet when I took the bowl to feed him, his eyes flashed indignantly. It was clear that he was a proud and self-reliant man who was unaccustomed to being helpless. But he was also a reasonable man, for he eventually allowed me to help. After a few spoonfuls, he was exhausted. His pain still wouldn’t subside, so I gave him a shot of morphine. It helped him to relax, and he fell asleep.
I couldn’t find the words to reply. I couldn’t say it out loud. I could not acknowledge it. She began to sob, looking at me. Unable to meet her eyes, I hurried upstairs to the sitting-room. There I dropped my belongings haphazardly and flung myself onto the sofa. So I lay, devoid of energy, for a few hours, until a gentle rapping on the door broke my reverie.
And so Watson goes. When later they meet up in France, Holmes supposedly scolds Watson for discovering nothing and declares that he did better in the meantime. But did he really? In fact, it was Watson who sorted out things, having investigated Lady Frances’s movements and reporting them to Holmes. Watson talked to the Lady’s former maid and her lover, Watson found out about the involvement of Peters/Shlessinger in the case, Watson even described to Holmes very well how Green looked.
The moment we arrived, I ran upstairs like lightning. The door to his room was locked. It didn’t deter me in the least, for I had my own duplicate key. He had let me have it, knowing that I was much unsettled by his penchant of locking himself in while under the influence of drugs.
On the other hand, Sherlock was prone to occasional whims. It was not unusual for us to use his secret refuges in London for relaxation in private. If that was the case, reading too much into this outing would not be wise lest I should be disappointed later, through no fault of his own.
It has been almost a month since Sherlock’s return, and we are still giddy with the joy of our reunion, not wishing to let each other out of sight for more than a few minutes. We cannot get enough of conversing as well as of sharing silence together. There is much to discuss after those three long years, but speaking is not always easy. Sherlock wants to know everything, even the harshest truth about my experiences during that period, and indeed he had told me in great detail about his own. Never before had he been so candid with me, and my heart bleeds for him—he spent those years in constant danger, battling the gruesome criminal syndicate almost single-handedly, plagued by severe bouts of black depression. Sherlock confessed that he had frequently used narcotics to keep going, but he promised from now on to give up that vice once and for all.
was written in 1886 and published in 1887). Yet here they are, two pals from England under different names and in a different country. That’s probably what people call kismet.
I could hear his steps going to the bathroom. He spent more time there than usual—either he gratified himself or… If it was the second option then his need was pressing indeed. He left the bathroom in half an hour, as he would on occasions he prepared himself for an anal intercourse. John hadn’t been with men before me, and for him being penetrated was an especially intimate experience when he relinquished control and allowed himself to unwind. He needed me but he wouldn’t distract me from my contemplations. My Watson.
I wish to be as sincere with my darling. Yet when I try, I get a lump in my throat, and words won’t come out. Committing them to paper should be easier. I hadn’t kept a journal since that day at the Reichenbach Fall, but now, perhaps, it is time to resume the practice. Facing what has happened should help us both heal.
There was such urgency in his voice that I couldn’t but comply. I straightened myself up, slathered vaseline over my prick and shifted closer to him so that my hips were aligned with the curve of his arse. Palming his pert buttock and exposing his hole more, I breached him carefully. When the tip of my cock slipped past the rim, Sherlock let out a luxurious sigh. Flexible as ever, he turned to look at me, his upper body reclining on the bed. He held my gaze as I pushed in deeper, inch by inch, until I was fully sheathed within him. His tight warmth welcomed me home; I undulated my hips gently, stretching him. Low, almost silent moans were escaping his lips, and his eyes shined with the same quiet happiness I felt. Colour spread across his pale cheeks and neck as I thrust harder into him, increasing my pace. Now he was stretched for my girth perfectly, my prick moving inside him with ease. Slick and hot, his tightness was just right, delicious. He moaned louder and bit his fist, trying to keep his voice down lest someone hear it downstairs. I paused for a moment to let him catch his breath. Sherlock grabbed me by the arm and pulled me atop of him for a long, hungry kiss. We explored each other’s mouths, our tongues entwining, our teeth clashing as we relished each other’s taste. Gradually our kisses were growing gentler, less desperate, and then we just lay still, embracing.
This is a last resort. If I can’t find another way to fix communication here, at least I can try to go there so I can speak to someone before I die.
: We’re ready for a new Watson Report! Today we’ll be talking to Ella Thompson, a NASA psychologist, connected to the Ares missions!
“Worth what?” Sherlock snapped. He was suddenly reminded of Sebastian and his friends, laughing at his expense until he had shut them up one by one by deducing all their dirty little secrets out loud in a full lecture hall. But John was not like Sebastian, not at all. John was still next to him, trying to catch his breath.
They settled in their chairs to eat, containers of fried rice and lemon chicken and roasted duck on the floor between them. Sherlock absolutely inhaled his food, clearing his plate three times before he put it aside. John watched with amusement. After dinner, they’d poured out some Scotch - it felt like that kind of night - and John asked Sherlock to go over the details of the case again, so he could start writing it up in the morning. It felt like home.
Please try not to upset the flowerpots in my bedroom, it’s a sensitive experiment. I’ll see to it when I come back.
“Look, Sherlock, I was just...trying to have some fun. I know you’ve probably never done anything like this in school and it seemed like a great idea last night. I’m sorry. The Scotch got to me as well, I guess.  It’ll wash right off, though, I didn’t use permanent marker.”
Okay okay, this isn't a real chapter, I'm sorry to get your hopes up! This little bit was written 3 years ago to start off the next chapter. I don't have the rest written out yet, but I already have a skeleton layout. Honestly, I kept getting notes about this fic and I always felt bad for leaving it. So here I am, testing the waters. I'll need to work hard to get back into it (haven't written anything at all in the interim), but if any of you are still interested, I'll make it work! I still have all my research notes and it would be a shame to let that work go to waste, no? XD I hope you enjoy this little teaser. <3 (yell at me on tumblr if you want!)
Alone in the kitchen, he takes a deep breath. God, he’s such an idiot. Sherlock will go home soon, and he’s still at square one. How do people do this? He puts the kettle on and prepares the mugs, adding a liberal amount of sugar in Sherlock’s. “Come on, Watson!” he mutters to himself, willing himself to be brave.
Now, I know my specialty is medicine and the human body, but I am a biologist, so that should get me somewhere. I also have all the notes our dear botanist friend Henry has left behind - so I went through them and I think it might be possible.
It’s funny how I get really calm and composed when I’m in a situation like that. I wonder what Ella would make of it. It was a good thing I was, though. I took an air sample, put on my suit and went to a Rover - we have equipment in there to check the atmosphere.
Communications array: dish is gone and nowhere to be found, antenna broke off and nearly killed me. Not the best situation.
: He is. I guess you could say he was the glue keeping the team together. He is easygoing, but he has a lot of respect for his commander and they had a very strong connection.
I’m going to drive in circles around the Hab, to test the lifespan of the batteries and to make sure the harness and the solar cells stay put. That way I can easily walk back to the Hab if anything goes wrong.
I’m John Watson. NASA Astronaut, and stranded during a mission of the Ares Program. The program consists of 5 manned missions to Mars, and our mission was the third. Not as exciting as being the first, but still pretty cool, right?
The first thing Sherlock forgets are - shockingly - the bees. He’s usually very precise, checking every two weeks if everything is in order. It’s been nearly three weeks now, and it worries John.
“Who’s this?” Sherlock asks, planting his finger on one of the pictures. John leans in close to see who Sherlock’s asking about.
He didn’t do this often, usually he prefered to go home and read or play the violin. But this week had been a hard one, and he wanted to let off some steam. The company was auditioning for some new ballets, completely new pieces with a modern choreography and Sherlock really wanted a part. The problem was of course that they all required pas de deux and none of the other dancers were keen on dancing with him, even though he was easily the best dancer in the whole company. The only reason that he hadn’t been promoted to principal yet was because he had such a bad reputation as a partner. He was fine being a soloist, if he had to be honest, because it annoyed him immensely if his dance partner couldn’t follow him on stage.
But my own exhaustion didn’t pass; it became an unshakable apathy and later spiralled down into a fit of black mood. John was alarmed as his embrace failed to dispel the chill in my bones. A persistent pain pierced my every muscle.
Holmes announces his engagement to Agatha, Milverton’s maid. I take Watson’s congratulations as humorous, since any engagement in Holmes’s case must be a ruse, especially if he is in a relationship with Watson:
Holmes being cold and heartless and Watson being a bumbling dimwit are popular cliches, widely spread images which were ingrained in many an adaptation. However, it seems that the origin of these misconceptions lies not in the numerous adaptations, but in the things the author said himself.
which ACD wrote in 1911, much later than the first Raffles stories were published. It’s about a man swindled by a bank owner. In revenge he commits a series of robberies on the road, taking valuables from two innocent parties first, and then from that bank owner. Later he explains that he did so to avoid suspicion and sends to the innocents their valuables via post.
“Thank you for your help, Dr. Watson,” he said in a clear, ringing voice. “I am sorry for troubling you at such a trying time. My household made too much fuss about a mere summer cold.”
“The game is up, Saville,” Holmes said flatly. “Your accomplices are in prison and the building is surrounded by police. You can’t escape.”
Even though the case involving the deadly disease had taken place almost a quarter of a century ago, I changed the names of the murderer and his victim to preserve the privacy of their surviving relatives. The time period was also altered for the same reason.
We went through a series of corridors and back rooms and finally found ourselves in the gallery overlooking the main hall of Hamleys. Even for me, an adult, the place seemed magical, like a miniature town: finely crafted dollhouses, trains, carriages, pretty dolls dressed up in the latest fashion, and countless other toys of all sizes and shapes imaginable. In the centre of the hall, there was a magnificent Christmas tree glittering in the semi-darkness and an enormous clock castle, a real masterpiece, with turrets and a drawbridge.
“It could be turned into quite a cosy nest if the owners were inclined to improve it a bit,” I said after we had examined the cellar, the servants’ room at the far end of the corridor on the ground floor, and the attic.
“Mr. Holmes,” he said in a very level tone. “Your concern on Sherlock’s behalf is understandable. Let me assure you that it is groundless. I would marry him if it were possible. Does it make my intentions clear? Good evening.”
The assassination was to have been disguised as a domestic accident—a gas explosion in Lord Knightsborough’s study. A maid had been bribed to tamper with the gas jet nearest to the desk when she was cleaning the study in the morning so that the judge would be killed at night, having returned from work and staying up late as was his wont. Posing as Lord Knightsborough’s new valet, I arranged capture of the maid red-handed, and by noon the operation was neatly finished. As the police were leaving with the apprehended maid, a newspaper boy ran up to me.
The scorching Afghan sun was ruthless. The supplies were out; the retreat had already begun, haphazard and ugly. I couldn’t dwell on it, for I had a patient to attend to. The poor fellow’s chest was badly mangled by a Jezail bullet, and he had lost a copious amount of blood, lying on the stretcher at the side of the road, abandoned to his fate by those who had been carrying him.
When Holmes asks the Duke about the circumstances of his not-so-happy family life, he does it with utmost care and tact:
Holmes grinned, his eyes twinkling again. I had an urge to smack him, yet he was right, and I just heaved a sigh.
“You have a new case?” I asked, watching through the opened door as he threw his belongings haphazardly into his portmanteau.
Here’s one of the instances when Holmes reads Watson’s thoughts by his features and startles him by the “
So, as usual, ACD turns out to be ambiguous in his views. On the one hand, they are quite conventional for his time, while on the other he admits that women are equally intelligent as men, and can even surpass them.
In the 3GAR discussion it was noted that Watson lets us see Holmes’s humanity very frequently. This story is no exception; here we go, cracks in the marble, as Jeremy Brett called them:
It was a delight to read such a story penned by ACD, because sometimes I was frustrated by his handling of female characters. For instance, in
“Taking a break from the metropolis is what the doctor ordered after strenuous work, isn’t it?” the Colonel replied, smiling.
, and every time he would demonstrate his astuteness in everything but my secret messages. I even did correct some blunders Mycroft pointed out, for quite a few of those weren’t intentional at all and could work as misleading markers. Anyway, I had no doubt that Sherlock would understand what I wished to tell him.
The police departed with their prize. I had promised Lestrade to provide the soft-nosed bullet, a twin of that which had killed the hapless Ronald Adair. John and I stood in the centre of the empty room in the circle of dim light from the street lamps outside. It was difficult to believe that we were finally free. John ran his fingers along my neck where the skin was tender to the touch.
I slipped my arm around his waist, and we looked together at the shattered window of the Baker Street flat across the street.
I gave him a mild sedative, ordered a light meal for us both, and helped him out of his clothes and into his nightshirt. We unmade the bed, and he settled himself comfortably under covers. When our meal arrived, he had a few morsels. At least his stomach didn’t act up. His eyelids began to droop, and I intended to sit by his side until he fell asleep. Then I would have to go arrange a room for myself as propriety dictated since it was already late in the evening.
We discovered a tin hip bath in the aforementioned lumber-room but agreed that filling it wasn’t worth the effort. It was much easier to share a kettle of hot water and employ the jug and the wash-basin in the bedroom.
Apart from my belongings, the only things I took from the Baker Street flat were Sherlock’s photograph and his old black clay pipe. I put the photograph in my room, and the pipe was my constant companion. Having it between my lips had to do until I could kiss him again.
Blast propriety. I wouldn’t refuse him the comfort of touch because of convention. Besides, we were in France, not in Britain. Having changed into my nightshirt as well, I put out the light and joined him in bed.
4) Also, tried to solve another riddle of the Canon as to why both Moriarty brothers were called James: Colonel James Moriarty (FINA), Professor James Moriarty (EMPT).
Holmes CARES about people’s feelings. Meanwhile, Watson, as usual, reads his moods and intentions easily:
Riding in the cab, I grew more and more restless. How would I present myself to John? What would I say? Would I still be welcome in his life? Those questions kept circling in my mind until I felt nauseated and weak, my temples throbbing painfully. I had steeled myself by the time the cab delivered me to a neat, respectable neighbourhood and stopped in front of a modern three-storied brick house. It had all the signs of a busy medical practice, with two brass plates beside the door. The upper, bearing John’s name and degree, I recognised as having been brought from Paddington. The lower one was relatively new. It announced that the poor could consult him free on Saturdays and Sundays. My dear man, he had been neglecting his rest too, all this time. No wonder he looked so tired in the photographs.
He nursed me through the darkness and despair and sickness. I savoured the sound of his voice, the warmth of his hands and lips—his very presence which made my existence bearable. As the pull of the drug grew stronger, I confessed to him of every ounce of secret supplies hidden in the flat. On worse days I poured out my soul to him, too tired and in pain to fear rejection or misunderstanding or all the things I couldn’t even name. The dreaded rejection never came. It was cathartic. The pain felt like the pangs of rebirth.
“I’m fine, sorry.” He gently pushed back the curls from Sherlock's forehead to scrub at the words there.  The ringlets curled around his fingers and he thought about how right it felt to have his hand in Sherlock’s hair. His mouth went dry. He felt his heart hammering and there was a sudden sense of alarm. Any second now, Sherlock would notice what he was thinking about, how he felt, and there would be no way back. He shut his eyes, willing his body to calm down again, when he felt long fingers close around his wrist.
The bar was dark and crowded. Sherlock liked it that way. It was oddly comforting to be a little invisible every now and then, to be able to hide away in the shadows. For six days a week, he danced in the bright-lit practice rooms of the Royal Opera House and he was forced to look at himself in the mirrored walls all the time. Every move had to be studied, precise, careful. And repeated endless times.
“Well, I assume you’ll plot your revenge, that’s usually how these things go. Bobby once filled my dorm room with cups of water, but then I wrapped all his stuff in aluminium foil, and then he…what?” Sherlock was looking at him incredulously. John really should know that Sherlock didn’t care one iota about boys called Bobby. Unless he was murdered in an interesting way. John sighed.

This is indeed a tragic day for the NASA family, for the Watson family, for the crew who joined him on this Ares mission. We trust your thoughts and prayers are with them and their families. John was an extraordinary astronaut, and even though he knew the risks, we never did want to see a circumstance in which this could happen.
At first I was a bit hesitant to go back into the Hab, but I tried not to think explosive thoughts. I rigged the regulator, bringing the oxygen level down to 3%. Then I used a battery, some wires and a small canister of oxygen to burn of a little hydrogen at a time. Worked great!
