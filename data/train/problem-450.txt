John hadn’t even bothered to open the pamphlet containing the full slave rights. He was familiar enough with them. The new owner’s handbook hadn’t seemed very interesting either, so he settled for flipping through the pages of the magazine.
They sat in silence for the rest of the drive. Holmes followed him patiently while he limped the stairs painfully slowly to reach his flat.
"I'm that, too," he replied calmly. "Soldier and a doctor. So you can bet I know a trick or two to hurt you. I've killed people nicer than you. My slave knows where you live. Hell, frankly my slave is clever enough to make your death look like an accident, so
Sherlock did as he was told to. He grit his teeth when the belt smacked his back one, two, three times, each of them hard, precise and painful. A military man indeed. And it clearly wasn't John's first time doing this either. Sherlock exhaled slowly, still holding his shirt up and keeping his head down while his master redid his belt.
Pretend or not, Holmes remained obedient and silent, so John decided to use his time by starting to arrange his slave a commuting pass, and a right to carry and earn money. Though naturally any money he might earn would belong to John.
"I don't think she's interested in you," Holmes said, ignoring the fact that John was talking over him: "What do you mean "the most dangerous person"? That woman? Anthea?"
Sherlock, who so far hadn’t said any of the sixteen remarks that had crossed his mind obeyed, albeit a bit slower than he should have. He knelt, leant his forehead against the floor and brought his hands before his head where they could be seen. No matter how many times he kowtowed, it was always humiliating. It didn’t help to be completely naked, but it was customary since the Roman Empire for a buyer to be able to fully see all parts of the potential property. He briefly entertained the idea of commenting on some of the “cosmetic errors” left on his body the woman had tactically failed to mention, but decided against it. She
Sherlock offers another smile, this one bland. He pivots away from John and heads towards the back of the RV.
No reason for her to build a new life for herself, to encounter John, to marry him. No reason for John to ever leave Baker Street and the life he and Sherlock shared together.
Jim jerked the steering wheel, but John was ready for that, bracing one leg up against the door as he swayed with the cab. His hand did not waver.
"All right," John says. He slaps his notebook shut with a bit more force than necessary, stands up. "I'll walk you out, yeah?"
Sherlock had learned to ignore John when he was stating the obvious rather than point out that he was, in fact, stating the obvious.
"I understand that you are upset," Mycroft said. He stepped through the doorway, moving slowly, gingerly. "But this is not your decision to make."
He stood up, careful not to disturb Rosie. It was getting to be past her bedtime, and he still had a taxi ride across London to contend with.
Still, the entire miserable scenario had unfolded exactly as he'd expected it to, in the end. More or less.
"Stay," he says. His voice is remarkably steady, given the circumstances. "In case I wasn't clear last night. Stay here, with me."
"Thank God that's over with," the man in front of them said. His voice was deep and drawling, irritatingly posh.
He blinked, caught off guard. "Yes," he said, because other than being cold and a bit soggy he was none the worse for wear. Though he suspected that was not, entirely, what she meant.
He looked at the wall, at the carefully framed periodic table and insect sketches. Shut his eyes again with a groan.
Tomorrow night. And the night after that.  And the night after that. And so on and so forth until—" he falters, not quite able to meet John's eye. "Until we run out of nights."
Rosie had nodded off on the sofa, and Molly had covered her with a blanket. She'd come over to the fire after, stood next to him for a time, not speaking.
Mrs Hudson, of course. It couldn't have been anyone else. Mycroft would have simply taken it. Lestrade would have had him arrested,
Mrs Hudson, well-intentioned as she was, had simply assigned meaning to something that had none. There was no reason Sherlock would have built him a laptop.
"The opportunity presented itself. I'd have been remiss not to take it. One last chance to telegraph to our killer—if he is indeed watching—that I am every bit as insufferable as the tabloids would have you believe," Sherlock said. He folded his arms across his chest, almost defensive. Rosie immediately set about trying to pry his hands free.
John's phone screen had gone dark. He'd been staring. He looked away, quickly. Woke up his phone and resumed scrolling absently through Alice's feed.
Rosie picked up a carrot, eyed it. He watched her for a moment, Harry's voice distant and forgotten in his ear. She mouthed at the carrot, screwed up her face in distaste. Held out her hand and let it drop to the floor.
"Well," Sherlock said, clapping his hands together, trying his best to sound dismissive. "Now you do."
There is no permanent place for John Watson, widower and single father, amidst the clutter and chaos of 221B. Sherlock has made allowances for him, for Rosie. He can see it in the way that Sherlock keeps his more gruesome and toxic experiments safely hidden away, the way he will pause in the midst of an excited deduction to lower his voice so that he doesn't disturb her nap, the way he patiently explains things to her, answers her questions even if they're repeated. The way he'll bring puzzles to distract her if she accompanies them to a crime scene, the way he'll make arrangements in advance for Mrs Hudson to look after her if he thinks there might be trouble.
"I'm not unsympathetic," she said. "I remember when we first spoke, when I first brought you on. I told you this might be a bit mundane for you."
He bent down, untied his shoes, slipped them off. Stripped off his socks, laid them neatly over the tops of his shoes in a pile. Flexed his toes in the cold, damp mud.
When he emerged into the kitchen, he was pleased to see that his noisiness had yielded the desired result. Mrs Hudson was waiting by the counter in her nightdress, arms folded, expression cross.
She laughed again, but it was a strangled dismissive sound. "Well. It's been nice chatting. Tell Sherlock to look me up if he ever makes it back to town. We'll have dinner. Two
And yet, Rosie's stupefied reaction to tangling a bit of tape around her fingers, and then her immediate and vocal interest in repeating the experiment was, strangely, captivating.
"Receptiveness," John said. It took a moment to sink in. "You mean my receptiveness. My—you followed me?"
Mary was gone now, and there was very little in the house that felt like it truly belonged to John. He had made a home there, but he had never really
Sherlock was still in his ear, not talking, just breathing, when John reached 221B Baker Street. He shifted his duffel bag on his shoulder so he could dig the key out of his pocket. It was impossible that the musty air in the front hallway should feel so welcoming, and yet it did.
His face is hot. His heart thuds unsteadily in his chest. He can feel Sherlock's eyes on him, that clear penetrating gaze.
He returned from reconnaissance to discover that someone had been in his room. They had not been subtle about it. His bag has been turned inside out, his mattress gutted. Limp feathers drooped out of the massacred remains of his flimsy pillow.
He stood and stretched, creaking, aching. The dog slumped by the fire lifted its ponderous head, gave a low growl.
"Humiliation? Your efforts were amateur, but reasonably competent given the amount of time you'd had to prepare. Surely you remember the basic steps."
He supposed he could deduce the entirety of her conversation with John if he tried. And if he asked, she'd tell him. Though he had been rather badly stung the last time she'd passed along a message.
"Raj and I met at work," she said. "Did I mention that? He's actually—well—he's the person we'd hired to replace you. Funny how life works out sometimes, isn't it?"
"Distraction," John said. "Injury. The fact that you might not always be as bloody clever as you'd like to believe you are."
John closes the lid, steps back. Thinks about the last time he touched Sherlock's skin. His wrist had still been warm, then, but devoid of life all the same.
and tells me to call you and arrange for you to come down. Next thing I know, the whole place is taped off, there are more people with even
"All right," she said, shrugging. He had the distinct impression that she'd had enough of him for one day.
"Up at the crack of dawn, out all day in the fields with his little notebook. Watching the horses run. Pacing his room at night. And the smoke!" she huffs, then turns back to face him. "But don't you worry, he keeps the window open. You shouldn't be bothered. Oh, here's your room."
It had stopped snowing, and the streets and pavement were a slushy mess. Sherlock watched last-minute shoppers (some rosy-cheeked and laughing, others looking altogether grim) as they milled about on the pavement, bags clutched in gloved hands.
He slipped on his coat, picked up his cane, went outside into the weak burgeoning daylight. The air was brisk.
She was lovely. Long hair, a little wavy. Silky floral top that she clearly saved for special occasions. Bare arms, a dusting of freckles on her shoulders. Her eyes were bright, her smile mischievous.
He liked it, but it was distracting. He could spend hours there, (carefully) perusing the drawers and shelves. Discovering what made Sherlock Holmes tick. And none of that would get him any closer to bringing the man home safely.
He kicked his legs, tipped his head back, drew in another gasping breath of frigid winter air. He could just barely make out the bridge above through the darkness and swirling snow.
"Good evening!" Pete called cheerfully from the front of the room. "Can you all hear me? Good. My name's Pete, and I'm going to be guiding you through an introduction to ballroom dancing tonight."
John lifted his head. His face was flushed, his eyes wild with something that might have been relief or fury. He relaxed the hand that was tangling in the hospital sheets, pulled it back slowly, as if just realizing it was there at all. "Fuck you," he said again.
"Joking, then," John says, his face still approximating a smile. He nods. "Good. That's—that's good."
He has steady work at the surgery, a continuous stream of cases with Sherlock, evenings at Baker Street with Sherlock and Rosie—takeaway and crap telly and Mrs Hudson slipping in with trays of tea and biscuits.
Moriarty gave a lazy shrug, did not even bother to glance in John's direction. "The type to settle down. Doesn't it get a bit boring after a while?"
The woman at the desk shut her eyes. There was a smile playing at the corner of her mouth, which he took to be a good sign. "Go," she said.
" he says again. "I, uh, I was in a better place than I was when I got back from Afghanistan, in some ways, because I—because you had—you fixed something in me, Sherlock. Something I didn't know was broken, and it's not just what you did with my leg, that first night. You gave me—purpose? I guess. Yeah. You gave me purpose. And then you jumped, and all of that purpose just—well." He breathes through his nose. Shuts his eyes for a moment. "I left Baker Street. Couldn't stand to be around all of that. But as much as—as horrible as it was, thinking you were dead, I was still myself. I had lost
John looked over his shoulder. His expression was strange—resigned, a little amused. "No, it really wouldn't have. Well. She'd have been upset about the carpet. But not about—you know."
John could not help but glance down. Sure enough, a streak of crusted brown mud swept across the aged leather of his shoe.
"I was hoping we'd have a chance to chat privately. I've heard so much about you," Victoria purred. "How you see
He did not have any reason to want to relive the experience, to hear his own choked and frightened voice, the muffled sounds of his own near-murder. He did not want to revisit the moment where he'd lost faith, where he'd realised that he'd failed, that John was not coming for him.
"Thank you," John said again, and the words felt wrong, all wrong. "Thank you for being here for me, I—"
"She was happy," Pete said. He looked a bit lost. "I mean—she was grieving, but she was getting better. He was a monster. You have no idea. The things he said—he—he held her back. She would have been miserable. I saved her from all of that."
Then they were kissing again, John's back hitting the door, his hands scrabbling along Sherlock's back, seeking something to grasp on to. Sherlock's hair was a warm tangle against his flushed face.
He thought of Reginald Teller, sprawled stiff and dead at the altar, crushed flowers from the mangled bouquet strewn all about his body.
"Right," he said again. "Yeah." He wondered what she meant by that, and found himself unable to meet her eye, casting desperately around the room for something to grab his attention.
Sherlock whips the tarp off of the lump in the back of his pickup truck with a bit of unnecessary fanfare—he's always enjoyed a touch of the dramatic, so John is not terribly surprised—and steps back, bouncing on the balls of his feet.
Sherlock ploughed on as if he hadn't spoken at all, "—consistent with frequent nose-blowing, which, clearly, hasn't come on due to an aversion to the—" he sniffed, grimaced, "—victim's appalling taste in cologne. You're moving slower than usual, your reaction times dulled—" his lip quirked, "—more than usual—"
The delivery had been confirmed. He has a grainy, scanned copy of Sherlock's signature on the mail slip to prove it.
"The bartender is going to notice the open door and shout at us for being in here in exactly seven seconds," Sherlock said.
"Right," John says, after a pause that has stretched on a bit too long. "Well. Guess we can chalk this one up to an overactive imagination, yeah?"
Sherlock blinks, reconsiders. John's face, alive and then not. All at once. The flip of a switch. The pull of a trigger. Thinks of him instead draining away, bit by bit. Blue desert sky. Indifferent sunlight.
He tells himself that Sherlock has always preferred being alone, and then he tells himself that he is full of shit, Sherlock
his eyes wide and uncomprehending. He looked terrible, John realized belatedly. Face gaunt and stubbled, hair greasy and matted. He'd hunched miserably in his chair, curled in on himself, shielded by the late-night darkness.
And even though he knew he was only delaying the inevitable, that John and Rosie would eventually depart and leave a gaping hole in their wake, he'd had to turn away quickly to hide his own burgeoning smile.
Sherlock raised his brows. Opened his mouth. Found that words would not come willingly. Shut his mouth again.
It does not matter what he wants. It is time to go. He lifts his phone, dials. John answers immediately, and the warmth and concern in his voice makes something cold and heavy settle in Sherlock's chest.
"You must understand," she said, finally, looking beseechingly at Sherlock. "The volume of flowers you're requesting, it's—it would be difficult on a normal timetable. And with your wedding date approaching so soon—"
It was meaningless, chasing his thoughts in circles like this. There was no point. Nothing to be gained. Nothing John had done or said years ago could make any difference now. He'd tried his hand at friendship and he'd made a complete hash of it, he ought to just wash his hands of it entirely except now he couldn't, could he, he couldn't because he
No matter. The man was clearly deranged and would need to be escorted out of the church immediately before he dealt additional damage. He stepped forward to do just that, glancing towards John as he did so, and what he saw brought him up short.
She loved him. She trusted him. In spite of everything, in spite of the long cold months after Mary's death where she'd been little more than an inconvenience, an afterthought.
Sherlock growled under his breath, refocused. There were no liquor bottles on the counter, and there had been no empties discarded in the bin. He opened cabinets until he found what he was looking for: a single half-empty bottle of scotch. He picked it up, examined it. Inexpensive brand, but not entirely bottom shelf. John tended to be frugal but not cheap, and his taste in liquor fell in line with that.
Sherlock had looked at him standing in the doorway and had smiled. His face had been pale, weary. That smile had lit him up.
He'd curled quietly next to John, breathed in his scent on the sheets. Rosie snuffled in her sleep in her little bed by the window.
And it hadn't been. It hadn't been forever. Not even close. Sherlock had—there had been blood in the street and his heart in his throat and a terrible long stretch of grey emptiness.
Victoria emerged behind him, smoothing down her hair. Her face was flushed, her lipstick clearly freshly reapplied.
For a moment she looked poised to scream, but then her eyes caught on the bookshelf and her face relaxed as she studied the curiosities stacked there.
He can do this, he thinks. He can sit quietly, can listen to John's soft breathing, can endure the occasional brush of John's arm against his own. Sometimes he doesn't speak for days, after all, a bit of silence now can hardly come as a surprise.
He startled, looked up at the realtor. Her face was tired, he thought. He'd likely contributed to that.
"Then I'm gone," John says. "I'm not—this isn't my life anymore. I want those papers, and I want to be done with this."
"We're going to begin by working on footwork," he said, stepping up close to John. One hand went on John's waist, the other clasped his palm. "Try to keep time with the beat. One-and-two-and—"
And John was there, John's familiar voice cutting through the cacophony and above all else it was imperative that he believe the lie.
John looked at the window, at the moisture pooling up against the glass, at the tall grass whipping in the wet wind.
"You're concerned," Sherlock said, unable to help himself. "You've tried all the usual distractions, but nothing's worked. Something is worrying you. Ordinarily you'd have a drink to settle your nerves, but you've elected not to. You think you may be called to act quickly, and you want to be sober."
Perched proudly in the rusted bed of Sherlock's truck is a 55-gallon steel drum, welded firmly into a square framework of pipes. Someone—almost certainly not Sherlock, he'd have considered it a waste of time—had carefully painted a grinning caricature of an Irish Setter on the side.
"Do be quick about it," he said to the woman. "The less time you waste on unnecessary details, the sooner I can solve your case."
John groaned, too weary to laugh and too heartsick to scold. He trudged up the stairs as Mrs Hudson slammed the door in Sherlock's face with an indignant huff.
Rosie looked back down at her hands. Went back to tearing. The sound of the tulle ripping was quite loud in the otherwise quiet flat.
"Someone came for you, didn't they?" John said, his mouth dry. "That's why you think MI6 has been compromised. Someone came for you and they weren't there to help."
It had been cold in his cell in Serbia. Cold and dark and damp. He'd thought of the fire at Baker Street, thought of John in his chair with a glass of whisky, the ice clinking gently against the side. Had thought of John's face, relaxed and open.
"Most of them avoid it," she concedes. "Except when absolutely necessary. And particularly at night."
Sherlock was right, he realised. He'd not had to clarify their relationship, or lack thereof, in a very long time. Whatever there had been between them that had made people think there was
Sherlock sits up straight, surprised. "Not interested? Why aren't you interested? By my calculations—"
would ever spare him a second glance. He'd just accepted it as fact. He'd allowed a monster into his life, had held the door wide open, and he'd never even questioned it.
But John had disposed of his last pack of cigarettes, his emergency rations, the ones he'd managed to badger him into revealing before they'd left for Grimpen Village. There was a sort of smug finality in his body language, something that stated quite clearly:
"I can—understand," she spoke the word carefully. "Why things were so hard for you after Mary—after what happened. I'm not upset. And I don't begrudge you the time I spent with Rosie. I don't see how I could. How anyone could. You were hurting. You were a friend and you needed help."
John was painfully aware of the distance between them. He opened his eyes, looked at their bodies, at all of the places they nearly touched.
Sherlock wrinkled up his nose. But he did not resist as John nudged the basket handle into his hand.
He cursed his own weakness, his own helpless affection. John had seen Mary's message, after all, had heard her say
A smile tugged at John's mouth and he breathed out through his nose, looked away. There was something charmingly engaging about Sherlock. Even—even like this.
He breathes out hard through his nose, shuts his eyes. Clenches and unclenches his hand. Flexes his fingers. Murmurs a few soothing words to Rosie, who has started to settle down.
"Getting something to eat," Wiggins said. He had his coat on, was standing over near the door. His coat had worn thin around the elbows. The hem was frayed. "You want anything?"
John looked up, looked at that familiar beloved face. There had been a time when he thought he'd never see that face again. And there had been a time when he thought he'd never
"—sounds exactly like you did at that age," Harry said. "You were awful, you know. Mum just about tore her hair out."
you absolute dick," John said. "Do you even believe half of what comes out of your mouth, or do you just say it because you think you're supposed to?"
John had smiled—a small, weary smile. It was inexplicable, that smile. He should have been filled with regret, with remorse, with pity. He should have been steeling himself to offer his explanation, his apologies.
conveniently highlighting every shocking thing she's witnessed today. Tomorrow, all anyone will be able to talk about is Sherlock Holmes callously cosying up to the chief bridesmaid while his poor oblivious fiancee waits in the next room, thus saving us the need to perform this
"Because there will always be a need for a consulting detective. And I'm the only one in the world."
EDIT: people seem to agree with me. I'm glad about that. But I added a little "warning" at the notes of the first chapter. Feel free to suggest tags, too, if you think something should be tagged.
takes my property and gets away with it. I don't know what your previous owners were like, but clearly you didn't trust them. I know you don't trust me and after tonight I can't blame you. But I
"Shall I pour you a beer, master?" Holmes asked, setting the plate and cutlery on the table for John.
He ran and he ran until he came to the evident, horrifying conclusion: he had nowhere but his mistress and master to go to.
He gave an exaggerated, judging look to Donovan's legs. "And scrubbed your floor, going by the state of her knees. Doesn't your slave usually do that for you?"
He didn't buy a mattress, but he did buy a small pillow and a blanket. They would have to do for now. He'd think about the mattress later.
"Now that's just impressive," someone commented. Sherlock turned to look at the direction of the speaker. The cab driver, Jeff Hope, was looking at him through the mirror. "I figured you'd stay unconscious a little longer."
He looked across the room. His eyes hadn't yet adjusted to the dark, but he could make the shape of Holmes next to the fireplace, the coat pulled over his shoulders.
“How do you take your tea, master?” he asked, just to be sure, as the printer went off. The man turned to look at him like he'd forgotten Sherlock was there. Which wasn’t an unusual situation –he was a slave, after all.
The slave lifted his eyebrow, but still said nothing. Instead he stepped to the roadside and like a miracle, a taxi stopped at his hail. He smirked at John’s astonished face and swung the door open.
John sighed and shook his head helplessly. "It just went too far. The next day he was dead. Died of internal bleeding."
Behind his back the slave smirked. Sherlock rubbed his fingers and returned his attention to the laptop.
"Forgive me, ma'am," he mumbled hastily. Her fingers combed through his hair –probably to both test how it felt and to dry off his saliva.
just accept that this was how he would live the rest of his life. There would be no better master than John Watson had already proven to be.
Mycroft smirked knowingly. He was back to wearing a smaller leather collar with his name written in cursive font on a metal plate. It was still quite a bit larger than what slaves usually wore.
Greg watched Sherlock converse with his master. The man had every right to be angry with his property, but he wished Dr Watson to be reasonable with his discipline. Sherlock, over the course of time he'd known him, seemed to have an unfortunate trait of attracting violent masters. Violent within the law mostly, but still violent.
Sherlock groaned, but complied. His muscles ached from lying all night on the cold floor and he had got barely any sleep at all. He could go long periods with no sleep, but for that he needed something interesting to occupy his mind with.
"Ah, master, welcome home!" Holmes smiled and quickly helped John out of his jacket. "Was your job hunt successful?"
The DI was completely unfazed by Holmes's extremely unslave-like behaviour. John couldn't help but to wonder. Holmes had been a slave for nearly his entire life, hadn't he? Why were the police treating him like...well, almost like a
"Very funny. A friend of yours," he corrected. Holmes tensed and turned to look at him with an utterly disturbed expression.
admit you are anything but loyal. A slave was supposed to love its owners. Disloyalty, showing any kind of resentment towards one's owner was punishable.
He could hear the slave in the kitchenette as he washed the dishes and wiped the surfaces. Some time later Holmes appeared to the doorway, hovering by the frames, uncertain of what he was supposed to be doing. It was understandable, of course. There were owners who didn't want to see or hear their slaves when they weren't needed, there were those who thought a slave should always be doing something and those who didn't really care what the slave did as long they did all they were told to do.
"Why not?" the man instantly wanted to know. No proper slave would questions its master, but by now John had grown used to Holmes's lack of respect. So long as he didn't cross the line, John could allow it.
She shook her head, but smiled. "Upstairs then, Dr Watson. Billy", she addressed the boy, evidently her slave, "put the kettle on."
They had discussed about Mycroft's collars in the past. Or rather, Sherlock had made a snide comment about them, and Mycroft had scowled at him.
"Why?" John questioned despite knowing why. Though he had no idea what exactly they expected Holmes to do for them. Sure his demonstration in the taxi had been impressive, but fairly simple after the explanation. This was a murder scene, not a scratched mobile phone.
Holmes sighed and for a moment John feared he would say he should not speak ill of his old masters, but he replied: "My master at the time was a violent man. He took pleasure in inflicting pain upon his property. He bought me because he wanted to tame a troublesome slave. But I never raised my hand against him because of anything he did to me."
John huffed at the thought. He was the master and Holmes would need to remember his place. Surely the man couldn’t be as difficult as the Ms Bruce the handler had seemed to suggest. He’d been a slave since he was a child. He must have had adjusted to his role in the society by now.
The slave sat on his legs and started pulling out clothes from the bag he had with him, while the woman beckoned John to the desk. “If you would then just sign here and here, please?”
He sprinted to the street, but the cab was already taking off. He tried running after it, but stopped when he realised there was no way for him to catch it. He took his phone, opened a new text and quickly typed down the cab number while he still remembered it. He walked back to the spot where the car had been parked less than a minute ago. There had to be
"Sorry, mistress. I didn't mean to defy you," he said. He put away his instrument, then silently undressed in front of the judging pair of eyes. He folded away his clothes neatly and piled them on the armrest of an unoccupied chair. He hesitated a moment before pulling down his pants, but mistress didn't stop him. Then he stood up straight again as if everything was perfectly normal, glad that he wasn't expected to look at them.
"Not mention what?" John bent and swiped at Rosie's messy hands with the damp napkin. She squirmed in her high chair and attempted to pull her hands free from his grasp.
"I fell asleep," Sherlock said, and then, feeling foolish for making such an obvious statement, added: "Get your things, we'll take the next train back to London."
He'd had no idea that the investigation was ongoing. That anyone out there cared about the truth behind Moriarty and Richard Brook. Sherlock had been tried and executed in the court of public opinion, after all. But it seems that they—whether Lestrade or someone else, someone impartial—had kept looking, kept digging.
"On my phone?" John stepped back, tugged his phone out of his pocket. Held it up. "Dead. I didn't have my charger. That's why I didn't—" he stopped again, looked at Sherlock. "Wait. You left me a message. You. Mr
A bittersweet exchange between John and Sherlock from an unfinished fic of mine. The fic wasn't working out, but I liked this bit of dialogue, so I cleaned it up enough to (hopefully) stand on its own.
He'd wanted to go and fetch her immediately. But he'd held back, thought of his own childhood, of the bolt-holes he'd accumulated, the secret quiet places he'd crept off to.
that I reacted the way you wanted me to, that I was goaded. The problem is that I'm the sort of person who's capable of being goaded into beating his best friend half to death."
What a wasted opportunity. To allow himself to be led like a stumbling fool, ushered to bed, soothed to sleep. He should have been collecting data, he should have been putting that time to use, he should have been
Christ, the friend request. He'd been accepting it just as Mrs Hudson had come up the stairs at Baker Street. In the flurry of activity that had followed, he'd not so much as glanced at his phone again.
It had been nice, the two of them on the run for a bit. He’d not been expecting that. A last hurrah, something to carry with him after.
"John!" Sarah's hand shot out, grabbing at his forearm. He looked down at her. She huffed, gave him an embarrassed sort of smile. Took her hand away.
"Oh," he said, smiled. "Congratulations. I—" he hesitated, because her presence here in the flat, which had not made much sense to him moments earlier, now seemed to make even less sense. "I hope you're not here to have him investigated," he finished, breathing out an awkward laugh.
The truth of it was written in Molly's briefly glimpsed face, twisted and apologetic. And it had, Sherlock supposed, been written in John's face as well the day before, uncomfortable and grim.
It was an impressive structure, all brick and marble and high ceilings. His shoes squeaked against the floor.
He'd just never been the type to make friends easily, that was all. Sherlock had been the exception to that. He'd taken to Sherlock right away. God knew why, but he had.
"Croissants," she said unnecessarily. She set the bag down on the table, turned to face him. Folded her arms. She was wearing another of Molly's jumpers.
He registers Mary's panic too late, drags his attention away from Moriarty as Anderson's RV veers too far to the right, tires briefly skidding off the pavement, and then fishtails madly in front of them. John jerks the steering wheel hard, too hard, overcorrecting and sending them careening into the corn.
"Mm. The staff had been using the cooler as a seat all day without ever guessing what might be inside. Hiding in plain sight. Bit risky."
"Just—" John let his hands flail helplessly. "I left her downstairs with Mrs Hudson. She can't spend the night on her sofa, that's not fair to either of them. I have to get her home."
Sherlock had sat quietly in front of the fire for what could have been minutes or hours—hard to say, really, he tended to lose track of time when he got to thinking about something. He was cold. He shivered a bit.
He did not lift his head, continued staring up at the ceiling as his brother approached the entrance to his cell. The door buzzed to admit him.
"Accident when he was a puppy. Only a few weeks old when he lost it. Dreadful," she sniffs, and scrolls to the next photo. "He's really quite sweet, you know."
Christ, Sherlock would be right to pitch him out into the street. But he wouldn't do that, he wouldn't, because he was Sherlock Holmes, and he
Moriarty's eyes are wide and dark and entirely unreadable. He does not look particularly alarmed. Instead, he steps back, out of John's grasp, makes an elaborate show of brushing his jacket clean. His moves are sweeping, theatrical; he is clearly hamming it up for the camera and the gathered onlookers.
The would-be jewel thief scowled at him, but did as he said, scrambling over to put his back against the wall. Bits of smashed biscuit clung to his coffee-stained apron.
"I did a study on the decomposition rate of various takeaway cartons, you know," Sherlock said, his eyes glassy but his expression quite serious as he pulled his drink towards him with unsteady hands. His voice slurred. "Took ages."
John glanced over Lily and Evie, who were watching with twin expressions of amusement. And then he looked to Janine, who seemed—well. Not amused.
cause and effect, and he is always able to see it, to pick apart those threads, but when emotion is added in to the mix it all gets muddled up, people behave in the most
John fumbled for the hem of Sherlock's t-shirt, helped him wrestle it up and over his head. Let his hands skate across the raised scar tissue that spanned his back, but did not linger. Instead, he ducked down to mouth along Sherlock's neck, tasting the light sweat that had beaded there.
John bounced her again, kissed the top of her head. Looked up to see Sarah watching him. Her arms were folded, and a smile curved at the edge of her mouth.
"Of course you don't," John says, and there is a tired good humour in his voice. He comes over and sits on the edge of the bed, then sighs and scoots up against the headboard, gathers Sherlock close. He does not seem to mind the cold sweat that has soaked through Sherlock's clothing.
"I'm glad I was wrong," Pete said, turning around as the music started to play. He held out his hand, smiled. "Shall we?"
The man was grizzled and unkempt, hunched over a beer and a half-eaten plate of chips. He was no one John knew.
He scoffed, looked away. There was a guilty flush of heat climbing up the back of his neck. "Lacking warmth? That's a—" he took a breath, forced himself to look back at her. "I don't coddle them. That's all. I don't—"
"Yes, I—" she says, faltering a bit. "Forgive me if I've missed something here, but don't jokes typically have a punchline?"
"Earlier. What I said," John is holding a plate under a steady stream of water. He does not turn to look at Sherlock.
Sherlock chose a wedding ring with very little fanfare. There were no staged arguments and no hysterics.
"She had, it appears, surreptitiously replaced four of the guards with inmates. Doctored the records. One of our men had been imprisoned under a false identity for going on two years.“
Sherlock blinked at him again, and then seemed to gather himself together in a rush. He nodded, a smile curling at the edge of his mouth.
The smell of the lilies reminded him, chokingly, of Mary's funeral, of the endless floral arrangements that had arrived with heartfelt condolences from friends and family he rarely saw.
"Besides," Sherlock said. "It's not as if he'll know I'm investigating the murders. They've all officially been classified as accidents. As far as anyone is concerned, I'm planning my actual wedding to my actual girlfriend. What better legacy could he ask for than adding me to his list of unsuspecting victims? Impossible to resist."
Accidents, John reminded himself grimly. The deaths had all looked like accidents. He needed to be less focused on the possibility of a madman leaping out with a knife and more attuned to loose light fixtures and broken floorboards.
"Wouldn't have figured you for the type," Moriarty had said, after a moment, turning his attention to Sherlock.
"You know," Pete said as John approached. "I didn't think you'd be coming back. I can usually tell when someone's not really into it."
She snapped her gum. She was always snapping gum. It drove the partners mad, but none of them had spoken to her about it. John did not particularly mind either way.
He kept Sherlock's phone charged up, left it plugged in and silent on his bedside table. He tried not to look at that, too.
"Sorry? Sorry for what?" Sherlock dropped his hands into his lap, furrowed up his brow in an almost obscene parody of confusion.
"Out of the ordinary how?" John asked, his voice a little too loud, a little too harsh. "Sudden shifts into third person? Dropping little hints about the East Wind? Offering to put a hole in my head?"
Holmes shrugged and continued his task. "You could still rent me full time. Did you get enough of me already?"
"Oh, don't be so prude. There's nothing wrong with it. You are not my first owner to enjoy pornography", he dismissed. Better they watched porn than made him perform. "And likely not the last."
Holmes paused as if to decide whether he wanted to reply or not. Then his posture relaxed and he resumed scrubbing the mug. "Not to the same extent, no. I'm not under a contract.
The woman pursed her lips at his reply and without a warning slapped him across his face. Sherlock yelped in surprise. It stung, but he would not cry. His eyes darted around the room. He saw the slave look at him with pity.
Apologies for any mistakes, English is not my first language. I'll be updating the tags and characters as they come along.
"Fuck, sorry, sorry", John automatically hurried to apologise and explain. "I didn't mean to yell, it's just..." He gestured with his hand helplessly. "Just this leg. PTSD."
"It really wouldn't make any difference. I don't have the rights to sell him." It was true, after all, but even if it wasn't, he had a strong feeling he would not sell Holmes to this lady for any amount of money. Something was off about her.
They had to strip all their clothes for medical examination, and they took Mycroft to a separate room at his request. At the time Sherlock thought it was because of his leg. Only much later in life did it dawn upon him that it had been because Mycroft wished not to speak of his sexual performance in front of his little brother, or have him witness the related physical examinations. They were interviewed for what felt like forever. They had to answer endless questions about their educations, skills and hobbies to determine what they might be useful for. Mycroft did most of the talking. How he remained so calm and civil was a mystery. Sherlock did his best to mimic him, but he hated everything and everyone. He missed Mummy and Daddy. He missed Redbeard and he missed Sandy.
Sherlock did not reply, only stared at her with wide eyes. She frowned. "I'll slap you again if you don't answer."
He looked at the mattress above him. If today was indeed Thursday 21st of January, it would be his twenty-third anniversary as a slave in little over two weeks. How time had flown. If he were to close his eyes, he could still easily recall his first night in a cell identical to this.
”Only for the decorated ones, and even them only if someone applies for them to get one. Apparently your heroic actions awarded you one.” She glanced at the printer, unconsciously stroking her wavy black hair behind her ear. She was wearing large silver leaf earrings. ”Whatever it is you did.”
John looked at him long and hard. No matter what Donovan had said, he didn't see a dangerous slave. Holmes was too clever for that. There must have been a good reason for him to risk his life. "Why did you attack your owner?"
Lestrade shook his head apologetically, but he knew what the slave meant. He had slaves at home, too, and he knew how slaves could treasure even seemingly insignificant things they may have owned. "Sorry, I can't promise anything."
She was sceptical at first, as expected. Like a slave would look at its master and think the master had all the power in the world and nothing could be done about it, she would think the same about her husband and the cartel. She had lived for years in the fear of them. But she was not a coward. Anything but.
John reacted faster than his conscious mind could comprehend. The knife fell on the floor and the man moaned in pain as he was thrown against the wall, arm twisted painfully behind his back for a moment before John let go.
"Sorry, Mrs Hudson. This slave's been trouble in the past." He grasped Sherlock's collar and forcefully pulled him up on his feet. "I'll have him flogged for bothering you. He shouldn't be out here at all. He'll be dealt with."
For the first week at each opportunity he ran. He ran and ran, yet each time he was caught. Each time the other slave would report it to their owners, and each time he was punished. Hunny would just spank him with whatever was at hand and tell he was lucky master wasn't home and that mistress was tutoring and thus not to be disturbed. She was right. Henry Marlowe struck hard. Hunny did, too, when Lydia Marlowe told her to. Their mistress seldom disciplined Sherlock herself –she was there to pick up the pieces. She stroked his hair and offered kind embraces, telling it was all right now. That what he had done had been wrong, but now that he had been hurt it was all forgotten. He was forgiven.
"There you go. That wasn't so hard, was it?" she said sweetly, but when no reply came, her brows furrowed even further. "
"Thank you, sir," the boy murmured and obeyed, though he was still wary and stood as far as he could while still remaining respectful.
dig into your pockets and pay for the damage you've done. Then, and only then, you will walk out of that door and leave, and I better never see your faces again."
Sherlock swallowed and slowly unclenched his jaw. All in the past now. He couldn't forget it, but he could look at it, accept it and push it back to the furtherest corner of his mind where it had come form.
"I…" John had forgotten what he'd been about to say, momentarily lost in her eyes. Maybe if he introduced himself..? One never knew, he might get lucky. She already had some interest towards his slave, or at least her slave had. A convenient excuse. A bit like using a dog to ask a girl out, actually.
There was nothing in the room to measure time with. The lone lamp in the ceiling stayed dim, never becoming brighter nor turning off. The door opened only twice: to let in a slave to tend their stigmas, and to let the slave out. They both knew it was likely to be their last day together, but they spent it mainly in silence, both of them lying in their beds, lost in thought. Mycroft was already asleep when Sherlock climbed to his bed, nestling his skinny being against him.
When night came, Hunny took him to the kitchen and locked him all alone in the dark slave cupboard. It wasn't at all exciting like it had been those times he'd sneaked inside one at home, pretending it was a cave where a hidden treasure awaited to be found.
“You’re my master now, it’s within your rights to name me as you please”, the slave countered, still talking to the window rather than him.
John was glad they were forced to head for separate cars from the platform. It gave him some time to gather his thoughts in peace. The only slaves allowed on regular cars were those acting as nannies or some other kind of caretakers. Once they were reunited again, Holmes led his master quickly through the streets to a cozy little Italian restaurant. The waiter seemed familiar with Holmes and directed them at a reserved window table.
"Then prove it, Mr Holmes. Pick your medicine. But which one I gave you? Was it a bluff? Or double-bluff? Triple-bluff?"
"Don't worry, Sherlock. We'll look after him," his nanny consoled him. She was a woman in her mid-thirties, a daughter of a late house slave of the Holmes family. Even her great-grandparents had been owned by the Holmes family, and she had taken care of Sherlock since he'd been born.
He was described as a slave who needed "strict rules, control, physical work to keep him occupied" and "regular disciplining should unwanted behavior arise". It also stated that his owner should be "strong-willed, consistent, repressive, resolute and ready to provide physical disciplining". John could see why he was given to an ex-soldier. Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately for Holmes, John wasn't sure he was the kind of man the paper described.
“I’ll be back by half five. Just…” John shrugged helplessly. “I don't know, make yourself familiar with the room and do…whatever it is you do. And, um… Have me something to eat by the time I’m back.”
to distract himself from this boredom. He would welcome the adrenalin rush with open arms if it could bring some change to this ever predictable dullness of the holding centre, where each day was followed by an identical one.
"I wasn't planning on calling Anthea, either," John assured the slave. Or whatever her real name was. He had discreetly compared Anthea's number to the one the woman in the black car had given him. It wasn't same. M didn't seem to be connected to Holmes's brother after all.
"Everything seems to be in order," she appraised. "He's in good shape, he's intelligent and handles the violin well. He's obedient and polite. The price you're asking seems very reasonable considering all that. Yes. Yes, I think we do have a deal. I'll take him."
had had sex with slaves in Afghanistan. Why did he care about this slave’s sexual history? It’s wasn’t like he had planned on having sex with his new property, anyway. Not now that it was a man instead of a woman. Besides, like many people from families who couldn’t afford a slave, he had always thought that an actual loving and willing person would make much better company in the bed. The “real men don’t need slaves to get laid” attitude. In the army there really hadn’t been other choices to have sex, and the bed slaves had been quite willing partners indeed.
“I should hope so”, she said, giving a meaningful glance at the man in question. The younger man turned to John, bowing deeply for several seconds to acknowledge him as his new master, before throwing the bag over his shoulder and striding to open the door.
The slave shrugged. "Like you said, I went missing for three years. I had several illegal owners. I didn't escape, I was illegally used. Yes, it was recorded as an escape, but I was never penalised for it. And legal or not, they
Sherlock listened silently, still kneeling by the bed. He could well remember his first nights in a cupboard, only it hadn't been terrifying at all. Not after the first night. It had felt like the only safe, manageable place in the world. As long as he'd been in there, the world outside didn't exist.
Perhaps rewarding him for good behaviour was actually working. At least the manageable behaviour continued. John still left him unattended for several hours each day, unable to spend all day within four walls with him. There were no new escape attempts, he had checked. In fact, his slave behaved so well that when on Thursday night John walked out of the bathroom, he couldn't help but to gape at his slave for a moment before picking up his jaw.
John was yet to take the bait. He didn't seem to have noticed at all. Larger part of Sherlock was relieved, but the little part whispering he was a failure, incompetent and unwanted, remained. He had no desire to encage in any kind of sexual activities with John, and yet the thoughts would not leave him: He's your master. You should love him. You should want him. If he doesn't want you, you're worth
Silence fell between them for nearly a minute as she kept working on her computer. The phone on the table started ringing, but she never answered it. John tried to occupy himself by looking at the framed picture of Mt. Fuji on the wall.
He was to be rented again today, but at least this time it would be fairly straightforward. A 50th birthday party. He would provide some of the night's entertainment with his violin –a pleasant change for the drunken parties he'd previously been to. He would just have to play and help the house slave with the clean up afterward. He had been promised food, shower, and sleep before he would be returned to his owner the following day. Hopefully, by next week Sherlock would have made John enough money to never do this again.
"It belongs to my owner", the slave said. "I've asked to be able to meet you, Dr Watson. I have my mistress's permission."
Neither his master nor mistress called for him for the rest of the night. Sherlock walked around the house aimlessly, trying to make himself useful while staying out of sight. It felt impossible that tonight would be his last in this house. How could they do this to him?
I want to trust, the slave in him said. It yearned to trust. It yearned to let John have everything and never have to fear or make decisions again.
The footsteps paused behind his door. He jumped down upon hearing a distinctive beep of the card reader and the electronic locks unlocking. The floor guard must have really had a bad day for bothering to actually open the door. Sherlock could hardly hide his grin while kneeling on the floor like he was supposed to. Couple of blows with the baton and he'd have at least
"I'm just saying, the economy, for example. They'd move all factories out of this country if it weren't for slaves", his master continued, completely oblivious to moodiness taking over his slave. "The world wouldn't function without slaves."
"He's annoying," Holmes said, but there was a touch of warmth to his tone that made John suspect he wasn't truly as hateful towards Mycroft as he pretended to be.
"Well it's your big mouth that's going to make Doctor Watson have you changed for another slave once he's had enough of your bad behaviour and attitude. Sherlock, I'm
. He hadn't meant to fall asleep. Despite the warm blanket, he was shivering. Shivering like he had back then, wet to the skin, huddling together with the other escapees saved from the freezing water. Even now he could recall the desperate and utter feel of failure hanging heavily above him. Unlike the majority, he had failed before. He had known what would await him back in England. The previous wounds hadn't even been fully healed yet.
John blinked, opening and closing his mouth a few times before finding words again. "Did you just tell me to shut up?"
"And that's were you went wrong," she firmly stated. "Let's try again, shall we? Hello there, child."
John watched the slave from the corner of his eye, who seemingly was fully concentrated on emptying his plate.
don't say you just left the door unlocked somehow, because then I'm really going to have to flog you."
"I don't buy into that act anymore," John scoffed, but decided to leave the matter. Holmes didn't seem to want to deal with this slave any more than his master did. Which only added to his surprise the next day, when upon returning from his now daily "get away from the slave for a few hours" walk the unnerving slave with a massive collar stood in his flat.
"What happened?" John asked. His voice was strained and everything of Sherlock that was a slave urged him to slump further down, be very small and so, so very obedient and submissive.
"Well..." John began uneasily. Right now? Holmes didn't really deserve to be freed, now did he? And he still needed his slave.
He was still on bad mood while limping through Russell Square Gardens when someone called his name: "John! John Watson!"
John bit back all the immediate responses that came to his mind and fought back the impulse to hit the man's jaw. Instead he pursed his lips a little before responding: "I got shot."
The slave –Mycroft, his name appeared to be, was at her side instantly, handing her a Black Berry that apparently had been kept in his inner chest pocket. She started typing, clutching the phone with her well manicured fingers.
Lestrade nodded sternly. Sherlock shook the blanket off his shoulders and threw it into the ambulance before bowing his goodbyes to the Detective Inspector.
"Well, you're more than qualified", the interviewer had said, but John had immediately noticed something off with his tone. Sure enough, he had continued: "Officially I should keep you waiting at least until tomorrow, but I think it's fair to tell you right now that it's a no."
Sherlock faked a smile and nodded with equally faked enthusiasm. Well, at least he wanted to tell himself it was fake. His sudden eagerness to serve wasn’t entirely an act. After the weeks spent within the same four walls, where only meal a day and a shower three times a week had distracted his routine of absolutely nothing happening, nearly anything to do was welcome. Even if it was to serve a new master.
Like his master, Sherlock was no stranger to nightmares. Scarce were the slave who never dreamt of the abuse they had suffered. It was not the first and unlikely the last time Sherlock woke up gasping for breath, half expecting to drown for several harrowing seconds before his brains caught up with the reality.
John swallowed. Three pairs of eyes looked at him, anticipating. But if the rent truly would be around the same as Holmes had assured him it would be... If he'd get a job he could afford it. It wouldn't leave him much cash to spare, but he could rent Holmes... The location was more than perfect, the rooms were more than he could hope for. It came with furniture.
”That should pretty much cover it, but a copy of the actual slave rights act is with the papers you receive. I suggest you read it carefully. Your slave’s ID is 99OR-79/3J3A. I'll print out its papers and you can give these”, she began, handing him the said slave rights act, the newest copy of monthly
Holmes growled frustratedly. "Did you actually have something you wanted to say or were you interrupting me just because you can?"
John had to drag his eyes away from the heavy looking dark, polished metal collar that disappeared under the white shirt's collar and look at the slave in the eyes instead. "How...do you know that?"
"See, it's not hard at all," she repeated. "Well, I will tell you this only once. I slapped you, because you did not address me properly. It's alright, I can forgive you this one time."
"You know each other?" he demanded, irritated by his slave talking to a stranger and ignoring his master.
"Wrong", Sherlock repeated more forcefully, even though he hadn't meant to say anything out loud. "He's wrong. The victims are not linked and they are
He gave up on escaping. He hardly ever missed his curfew. Perhaps that was why his owners were so enraged when the Powers case caught his attention.
John made an agreeing sound and sipped his coffee. He wondered if Holmes had ever asked for the contract before his rights for one had been stripped away. He certainly seemed eager to have himself freed. Or had been, at least.
Sherlock did not cry. When the auction opened and the people began to pour in he made nasty deductions of anyone who dared to come close. He was hit several times by the auctioneers in order to silence him, but it didn't work for long.
She walked out of the room, leaving him to dress in privacy. Sherlock did as ordered and gathered all his belongings in one place. He didn't have much. The only thing he truly owned was the violin. Everything else —clothes, shoes, collars, pillow, blankets, towels, personal hygiene products— they all belonged to his owners. Mistress would go through them to determine what would go with him as part of his sale.
have the baton after all, and he preferred to be able to properly walk when he’d finally get out of here. And despite his natural instincts to rebel, he had no desire to sabotage his sale if the alternative was possible execution after the auction.
"Not as sorry as you will be tomorrow," John snarled. He felt like kicking the man between the ribs, but suppressed the urge. Holmes's right hand had teeth marks where he must have bitten down on his fist to keep from screaming. "Get up, make that tea and go to sleep."
No one spoke until Sherlock closed the door to the sitting room behind him. He could hear John's low voice immediately after, but could not make the words.
"Hold him," Mycroft ordered Sandy. "Don't let him cause any trouble when someone comes for the dog."
Mycroft had said that. Mycroft was smart and he was always right. Mycroft always kept his promises. He would come and save him. He had to. He'd said he would.
It was both comforting and unnerving to sleep in the same space with someone. He'd missed the knowledge of other people nearby during his lonely nights here in London. In Afghanistan they rarely got to sleep alone. It was too silent in here, and too noisy at the same time. The cars passing by and the drunkards on the streets from nearby pubs made it all wrong.
A shiver ran through him as the distorted voice called him by his name. It was impossible to determine whether the voice belonged to a man or a woman. He straightened his back. "Who are you?"
The smile returned to her face. "That's better. Always address me and my husband as your mistress and master. Use it like a punctuation mark. Do you understand?"
"My body, my soul, my abilities and my thoughts, all of me belongs to you and is yours to use as you please. I give myself willingly and deserve nothing in return. I respect you, I obey you, I love you. I am grateful, for you give my life a purpose. I'm yours, and your word is my law," he finished and bowed down to the floor. He rather bowed than kissed John's hands or worse, his feet. His jaw hurt. He hadn't even realised how hard he'd been biting down.
She understood. Even if their exchange had been brief, even if she hadn't truly done anything, just being talked to like a real human being was the greatest piece of kindness he had received in months. Seeing her, getting to talk to her, even if it was just greeting her to have her look at him became like drug to him. And oddly enough, she seemed to equally seek him out. She wanted to talk to him, she found excuses to have him removed from his post to attend to her. Other slaves noticed of course and grew jealous of him quickly. It was devastating to have his fellow slaves treat him the same his keepers did, but Sherlock ignored it the best he could. It didn't matter. He wouldn't stay here forever.
What Sherlock didn't know was that after the auction was over and all the people had left, Mycroft was returned to their cell alone. The cast around his leg and the general appearance of him had chased away the buyers. As embarrassing as it had been to stand naked on the stage, it had been even worse to have no one bid for him. During all the time he had stood,
"And you were about to sabotage the whole thing. Everyone was aware of my position. You didn't need to make scene of it," Holmes argued. "Punish me later. We haven't got time for that now."
"I'm really sorry, ma'am," Sherlock apologised again. October? He'd been on sale for four months and he hadn't noticed?
When the floor guards came for him half an hour later, Sherlock had climbed to the far end of the top bunk, refusing to come down, fighting tooth and nail against them. The clothes had to be ripped off of him and he was dragged kicking and screaming down the corridor to the lifts where he was unceremoniously thrown with the the other slaves and his bag thrown with him -and that was what snapped him out of his fit. He cradled the bag and its fragile contents against him. He was the only slave in the lift owning anything.
Holmes looked delighted to return to his original theory, and delivered a maddeningly quick speech about Harry's shaking hands and how John didn't get along with her.
It took nearly an hour before the LED board chimed and his number appeared on it, instructing him to room number 12.
"Forgive me", he murmured, pulling his own hand away reluctantly. It really was none of his business. He knew he should ignore it, but... Curiosity got the better of him.
angry. "Why do you have to be so difficult? I just told you to make a cup of coffee, not run an errand to the other side of the city."
"There's a another bedroom upstairs if you'd rather have that one", she informed him worriedly. "It's smaller and doesn't have a cupboard for Holmes, but you could get a bed with slave space. It's more private. In case I get another tenant. But the only bathroom is here."
Holmes wasn't intimidated in the slightest. "I came back, didn't I? I was not aware I wasn't allowed to leave the flat."
"Not in the least. I might even ask you to. What do you mean by 'this and that'?" John wanted to know.
"Right." John sighed, shaking his head. "Sorry, you're right. I can see what kind of owners you've had previously."
He didn't, but John nodded anyway. He wouldn't be taking his orders back, not tonight. "Yes. But not before you've apologised."
He couldn't blame Holmes, though. As the master, it was his responsibility to make the rules and enforce the power structure. He should've stopped this nonsense of his slave addressing him by his first name, but he didn't want to.
"What happened? Is Mrs Hudson alright?" he urged, already standing up, ready to leap in action and find his medical supplies.
"I meant to cook pasta, but I burnt the spaghetti", the man on the floor replied. "Master", he added quickly. When John said nothing, the slave continued to explain himself: "The cereals were just a quick fix, I didn't have time to start over. There's sauce, though it might have gone a bit cold..."
"Mike Stamford, a mate from Bart's", he continued, pushing back the thoughts. Normal people talked to their slaves, too. "Promised to meet him again later."
"Revenge?" Holmes laughed mockingly. "Why would she write an angry message in German while she's dying? She scratched that with her nails while
Sherlock opened his eyes, inclining his head to get a better look at him, but did not get up from the sofa. "Yes, John?"
handles”, she said, emphasising her correction. Typical from an InS worker to frown upon the abbreviation everyone else but themselves were using.
John chuckled. "Well done, Holmes. Twice more and I hope I'll never have to rent you again. There might be a hen party you could do."
"I've been asking around," Sherlock decided to answer. He'd spent a considerable amount of time reconnecting with his old connections and retrieving items he'd hidden or given away years ago. He had asked about Moriarty, but with little success. "The majority know nothing and those who seem to know something are too scared to talk. Just rumours in the shadows and figures in the corner of my eye."
Holmes had considerably calmed down since the morning. When John opened the door and stepped in, he found his property lying on his back in the middle of the room, arms and legs spread so that his body took all the floor space. His eyes were open, but he didn't stir or seem to notice John's presence until he leant over him and lowered the shopping bag gently on his stomach.
Holmes moaned, but shrugged off the coat, undid his scarf, unbuttoned his shirt and threw it on the floor as he got up on his feet.
"They're slaves and they're not my friends," Sherlock dismissed. John wouldn't need to know. And he wasn't lying, not entirely. Some of his clients were slaves. The name Sherlock Holmes had a good reputation amongst them. It was obviously a risk to take cases from free people at all without telling them he was a slave, but that was part of the thrill. Most things were trivial anyway, and didn't require him to do anything or go anywhere that would give away his status.
