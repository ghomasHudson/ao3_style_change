"That's cause you're up on the ladder. You're not seeing it from the right angle. There's, like, ten million lights all on one side and none at all over here. It's like a black hole of no lights. Right here. Look from over here."
Grief over the worst loss he had ever suffered. A grief so intense it had taken over all his heart, and all his mind.
"And while you get the truck, I'll guard the beer," offered Sam, grinning at him. "Cause it's the only important part of the luggage, right?"
Cas was sitting on the tub near the door, looking up at Dean a little woefully. Looked like he'd just gotten out of the shower; he was wearing only a towel wrapped around his hips. And he was holding a bloody washcloth to his face. A
"Oh... but...." she whispers to Sam. "Can't he just heal the feather-roots?"  Dean and Cas exchange a glance.
job, and that is what will make me happy." Then he adds (desperately hoping it's true), "Cas, we'll have time. We'll have more time. You just rest. That's all I want."
, he realized, but he and Sam were already past it and the most important thing was to keep running. The drums commanded him to run, so Dean ran. Till his lungs were bursting, his heart was pounding.
"  Of course Dean wasn't listening, and of course he wouldn't stop, and all Sam could do was sit by Dean's side and watch, to help keep vigil over Cas.
The man stepped closer and put his hand on Cas's snout. Cas flinched, closing his eyes, and a shiver ran through his body. The man was silent a long moment, staring steadily at Cas, one hand still on Cas's long black nose.
It seemed right to at least go through the motions, though, so Sam hid the pistol as best he could, tucking it under a false panel he'd installed in his bottom dresser drawer a couple years ago and that he was pretty sure Dean didn't know about. The ammo and Impala key he wedged under the mattress. Then he set his phone alarm to go off in an hour, hoping this would ensure he woke up before Dean did.
"Yeah... got it...." says Sam. After a moment he says, rather thoughtfully, "You know, I really should've realized when you about passed out when we met Dr. Sexy that one time—"
"Some of us never get some," muttered Dean quietly, picking up the fork. "Not our favorite, anyway...."
And deep underneath was the baby parrot. Dean could just make out its outline now, barely visible under all the white butterflies.
There's a perfect view of the ridiculous-looking pine cone. Dean takes Cas's hand under the table, and Cas squeezes back.
"What's wrong this time?" she said, without any preamble. There was some background noise: people chattering in the background, bursts of laughter.
"Then finally it occurred to me," said Sam, speaking very matter-of-factly now now, "that you maybe you were also trying, all along, to save up enough money to get me back to law school." He looked over at Dean again. "The pay's better here than at the garage, right?"
Dean began to feel a little silly, the anger draining away as he bent over, rubbing his sore foot. He started to say, "That thing must be frickin' titanium—" when the black footrest shivered, all on its own, and bounced a couple inches away.
By late evening Cas perked up a little and spent an entire twenty minutes at a stretch sitting up and looking around.
Sam was right; Cas had gotten a pretty secure hold on them just with his feathers. Even when Dean sat all the way up, the feathers over his legs seemed to be hanging on securely. Dean still kept a tight hold on several plumes with his hands just the same, but at last he managed to look around.
The steady ticking of the clock, and Cas's slow, rasping breaths, seem the only sounds in the world. The minutes drift by. Dean's in a somewhat awkward crouch just behind Cas, and his knees are soon aching; he shuffles around to try to get one leg straightened out parallel to Cas's back, with other one folded tightly under him. Then the folded leg gets crampy, but Dean stays there, watching the clock's second hand sweep through a full minute, and then another, and then another. He thinks to himself,
"You only have the five-minute mist showers?" she asked, glancing at the shower trailer with one perfectly-plucked dark eyebrow raised. She ran her fingers through her shining hair as she said, "AP's got a desalination plant and we run full half-hour showers. Boy, I'd hate to have to wash my hair in a five-minute mist." As they came around a corner in view of the outhouse towers she added, "Oh wow, you guys actually use outhouses, Sam wasn't kidding!" She turned to Dean with a bright laugh. "Do you guys wash your clothes on a rock, too? Haul water from the lake? Communicate by carrier pigeon?"
and then they were at the shore, Cas floundering in the whitewash of the retreating wave, his waterlogged wings stretched far out to either side as he tried to stagger to his feet. A great shadow rose behind — another wave! This one came crashing down right on Cas's back, and Dean and Sam were swept right off into the water.
But Dean sat a long moment staring ahead. Now all he could seem to see was the featureless expanse of white of several days ago, when everything had been shrouded in blowing snow, Topaz invisible then in the snowstorm. Dean was parked now exactly where he'd parked during the blizzard, and indeed he was about to walk almost the same path, once again trying to help Cas. This time Cas really
"It was clear, at long last, that you were going to be the ones," Castiel said. He set down his mug again, slowly, and said, "The ones who would develop art, and music; who would dream of space travel, and codes of ethics — not that they were always the soundest codes of ethics, mind you, but at least you were attempting to think about it. You were the ones who would split the atom. The ones who would search for God, and who would actively seek out Heaven. You were the ones whose souls, of all the wild souls on Earth, have the most power of all." Castiel paused a long moment, his eyes on Dean now, as Dean gazed back stunned.
"It's super soft on the inside," Sam says, breezing past the "I used to fly there" comment. "It's got a fleece lining. I thought it might be comfy."
Cold, hungry, and tired, Cas wasn't at his most alert as he wandered into the Red House. He made his way out of the rain, shivering from the cold, and stood gazing around dully at the aggressively red-and-black decor. Scarlet drapes hung from the walls, blood-red barstools stood in a row at the bar, and all the bartenders even wore smart red bowties. He took a seat at the bar, waving off the bartender (he didn't have any money for drinks) and sat for a while. When a man by his side said, "So, whatcha here for?" Cas said, "I'm just trying to warm up."
Dig a hole, put three or four bulbs in it, orient them roots-down. Replace the earth, pat it down. Repeat. Repeat again. On and on. Two hundred and some bulbs took a while.
Oddly, the touch of the dragon's velvety tongue began, slowly, to calm him. There was a certain surreal absurdity to it (
"Um, I'm sorry, I'm intruding," said Cas. He was watching Dean's face again. "Maybe I should be on my way?"
Sam laughed; he was laughing at every story, actually. So Dean told him about the time a tent full of precious research notes had blown loose in a gale-force wind and had rolled, still completely intact, right onto the lake ice like a gigantic hamster wheel, with a desperate grad student dashing after it ("Did they fall through the ice and die?" asked Sam. "Not on my watch," said Dean. "I went out in the snow machine and picked her up, and then we had to chase down the tent. That thing was really rollin', man, thirty miles an hour at least." ) Then Sam wanted to hear about wolves, of course, and Dean was soon racking his memory for his best wolf stories too. Those stories weren't very dramatic, though, mostly along the lines of, "and then in the distance I saw a wolf-dot, and it went over a ridge and disappeared."
It occurred to him, then, as he stood there looking at the hundred-and-twenty-three dollars, that maybe he could save it for her university studies.
, angel?" Dean says, deliberately dragging out the words, emphasizing them. There's just a "nnNNNgh..." in reply from Cas, like he's beyond words now. Dean says, "Then you better
Balthazar laughed. "Well, of course he's gone native, seeing as how it can't possibly have been someone of, you know..." Balthazar leaned close to Cas's ear. "—
thoughts have started, it turns out that they won't shut up. It's like some kind of "Now let's think full-time about nothing but cancer" mode has kicked on, like an unwelcome visitor knocking insistently on the door, and the little voice in Dean's head keeps going
be fine. Though, the evening NWS forecast had in fact mentioned the possibility of a system moving in, probably the same system Sam had mentioned, the one that was going to "sock in" Prudhoe Bay by Sunday. Dean would be safely in Kansas by then, but what about Cas?
He hadn't gotten five strides when Dean realized how ridiculous it was to let Cas just walk all the way around the lake when Dean could drive him there in a tenth of the time.
"I don't believe it," said Phil. "Thought for sure they were goners. Well, it's only sea state two now, so let's go get 'em. You got some blankets?" Shelly was already running up with several fleece blankets and a first aid kit.
They can't tackle any new cases till Sam's leg and Dean's shoulder both heal up, so for the next week they're holed up at the bunker again. Once Cas knows they're safely back home and healing, he goes totally radio-silent again. There's no explanation for why he suddenly started texting that night, and no explanation for why he never does again.
Dean wakes thrashing, his pillow clutched tightly to his chest. Sam's shaking his shoulder, whispering "Dean! Dean! Wake up! Something's wrong."
"Yup," said Ruby cheerfully, still hanging possessively on Sam's elbow. He looked blankly down at her as she said, "We chose you
Once he's downed two-thirds of the bottle he opens his eyes and pushes the bottle away."It actually tastes good this time," Cas says. Dean's beaming at him, like Cas has performed an incredible feat. Cas explains, "It didn't really taste like water before. It does now."
Then the three orishas stood there in total silence, Oshossi and Elegua and Ogun side by side, still as statues, looking at Sam and Dean. Their faces seemed unreadable in the shadows. The quiet murmurings in the shadows were back; the other orishas must have returned as well.
He learned there was competition. A surprising amount of competition, actually. And some of them didn't like having Castiel there on their preferred nights (Friday and Saturday, mostly). After one fight too many, one accusation too many of having "stolen" a job from somebody else, Cas switched, for the most part, to a Sunday-through-Thursday schedule.
Dean and Sam both laughed, and the two ecologists then headed to a corner table to pore over their little yellow books as they ate. Dean watched them paging through the field books, thinking,
Sarah holds Dean's eyes for just a fraction too long, her brow slightly furrowed, and slowly Dean realizes that she, too, has a dilemma of her own. Even if she
Then a strange ripple in the air caught Dean's eye, low down on another hilltop. There was a boom of thunder, and a doorway appeared. A thin dark figure stepped into view, with another orisha just behind him. The dark figure raised one hand toward Cas, stepped back out of view and disappeared.
"I think I did that," said Sam, and Dean looked over to see that Sam was getting out of the Ikea chair. "I realized I wasn't close enough to grab you," said Sam. "This seemed quicker. Sorry, I didn't mean to play God or anything, but—"
The second was a small, but heavy, chunk of mottled-brown ivory — part of an old tooth. A very old tooth.
But a quick look inside revealed that the Chevy had actually survived the winter pretty well. The new seat covers that Dean had installed last year still looked intact and even seemed to have come through the winter with no weasel or vole damage, always a welcome surprise. The green cooler was in the back seat as promised, and it looked like Shelly had even retrieved Dean's box of old cassette tapes from the Winter Lab and had put them on the front seat. Dean grinned at the sight of the cassettes, and he patted the old truck on the steering wheel, where there was a neat parallelogram of duct tape with "
Dean pauses before sending it. He squints at the words for a moment — is "long-lost angel" too familiar? Too casual? Too... something?
Angels could inhabit human bodies, it turned out, taking over control of a living human being — though apparently only if consent was given.
Nothing has happened beyond that (well, not yet, at least); neither of them has made a real move of any sort. Somehow it seems more than enough to just be here together.
Dean had changed several things in the past couple weeks. He'd been improving the grave. There were some planks set across the head of the grave, for one thing; Dean would check those in a minute. The most important addition, though, was that there was now a little string threading its way out from the loose dirt. Dean plucked all the leaves out of the way and bent over, nose almost right down to the ground, so that he could study the very end of the string in the grey pre-dawn light.
Can't they take just one day off from this cancer thing? (It's not even been a week yet, and Dean's already exhausted from thinking about it.)
"You takin' your guns camping?" called a familiar voice, interrupting Dean's thoughts. Dean turned; it was Ryan.
It was embarrassing how often he forgot this simple fact. Castiel wasn't an angel anymore. So that old rule didn't really apply, did it? Cas was human. So... would this still be a sin? What rules applied to Castiel now? Could he lie with a man, now? Or... was he now subject to that finicky Old Testament rule about men not lying with men?
"—mosquitoes, yeah, when June hits," acknowledged Dean, "And grad students. Who are kind of like the mosquitoes actually; they arrive at about the same time. So far we've just got a few of the scientists. Like, those two sorry-lookin' dudes who just came in, Phil and David—" (Dean started pitching his voice a little louder, so that the "sorry-looking dudes" could overhear.) "They're the only ones here so far from the U Penn stream ecology team. You see that hopelessly scruffy look, all sunburnt and muddy and beat-up, and that confused look in their eyes? That's what a Ph.D. looks like. They spend all day, like, staring at the bugs or the snow or something and thinking deep thoughts."
He shook his head and donned the jacket himself. Even with wing-slits, it would make an excellent extra layer. The leather jacket went on over the fleece one, and then Dean grabbed his thin Kansas gloves and his hiking boots and looked over at the water-skins, thinking.
"That's how he got his name, you know," said Cas. "The name 'Lucifer' means Light-Bringer. It really refers to the fact that Lucifer was trying to 'bring light'
Slowly, Cas set the feather into Dean's hand. He gave a tiny, tight intake of breath as he let the feather go, rather as if he, too, were having a little trouble letting go of the feather.
It's no surprise when Cas's first move is to kiss the back of Dean's neck. Dean grins; there's some "angel things" that are definitely starting to come into focus. And each one seems an intensely wonderful discovery.
By the time they both finally turned back to the screen again, Dean had managed to school his expression into a cheerful, accepting grin.
Most of Sam's gear had been lost or ruined by the fire. The shotgun was long gone. The water bottles had melted and burst. Dean dug a water bottle out of his own pack and held it to Sam's mouth, trying to keep his own hands from shaking. There were some pain pills, too, in Dean's little med kit; he gave Sam a fistful of those, knowing full well that they wouldn't do a damn bit of good. He thought of making a token effort at dressing Sam's wounds, too, but all he seemed able to do was stare at Sam's horribly burned arm and shoulder for a while, thinking,
In Dean's own mind, where a faint little tendril of some unnameable hope had been rising, like a fragile little flower growing out of the dust, Dean shut a mental door, and put the tiny little flower into the dark.
- And then he does say "I love you"! I've never had Dean say "I love you" in any of my fics before this one. I used to think there were no conditions under which he would naturally say it. He tends to show his love in other ways, in his acts and behaviors, but he doesn't normally state it flat out. But in this fic he finally came to a place where it was natural for him. This surprised me; I'd originally planned that he would never quite say this to Castiel, not in those specific words I mean; but with the threat of Cas's imminent death looming so close, Dean ends up just blurting it out. This was one of those cases where the character just kind of did it on his own.
" Cas says again. "I got some, I got some on—" He's still having a little trouble breathing; there are abortive half-heaves interrupting his speech on about every other breath, and it's hard to understand what he's saying. Cas finally manages to get out, "On your, on your
A few more steps brought some more of the mortals into view: two men crouching behind a boulder, desperately working at a last-ditch attempt at a spell. Another two rolled on the ground nearby embroiled in a violent fist-fight.
After a moment they both put their hands down. That seemed to be that. Dean hesitated a moment longer, tempted to zip on out there in the snow machine and say hello for real, but Cas had not given the emergency two-arm wave, nor the big come-here circular one-armed motion. He must still be wanting his privacy, and Dean didn't want to intrude any further.
"Yeah, yeah, of course," says Sam, like this is so obvious it didn't need saying. He pauses a moment, and when he finally speaks again, his voice is a little more controlled. Dean knows then that Sam has already switched gears into planning. "I'm coming out too," says Sam. "Where are you guys?"
There was an odd stuttering feeling to their passage, as if the world had suddenly switched to low-resolution, low-frame-rate video.
The worst drive, of course, had been when they'd had to drive their dad's body away from the hospital, to cremate him on a funeral pyre out in the middle of a fallow field. Sam had always thought nothing could ever possibly be worse than that drive. That whole night, actually. The long hours they'd spent finding enough scrap lumber to build the pyre. Dragging Dad up there. Lighting the fire, watching it grow.
Quietly, the three of them walk closer. There's nobody else around. The whole parking lot's deserted, and it's eerily peaceful, the only sounds the rush of wind through the tree branches and the crunching of their boots on the snow. Together they flounder through a ridge of deep unplowed snow between the pine trees, Sam and Dean bracing Cas on either side. He gets through it fine, and they discover there's a little trail just past the trees, a freshly plowed paved trail about four feet wide. It stretches away to the left and the right, and there's a neatly lettered sign  that says:
It was nice to just stay home. Relaxing, even. Dean made dinner for the three of them: twice-baked potatoes heaped with melted cheese, a salad to keep Sam happy, and a nice set of steaks that came out pretty damn delicious, Dean thought.
Cas sounds like he's really only half awake, but Dean starts right in and announces: ""I'm just calling you to let you know that I'm not gonna call you." (He has to concentrate on enunciating each word, and feels rather pleased with how well the words came out. Hardly any slurring at all.)
Cas look up at him slowly, and finally he says, as he resumes the table-wiping, "One more cycle for sure. After that it depends on... " He pauses briefly, his hand hesitating in mid-wipe. "On how things go," he continues smoothly. "I've got two more treatments before Christmas, and the day after. And then they'll be doing some tests, the week after Christmas. To... see how things are going. I've got a set of appointments on the twenty-eighth. Aaron, my doctor, he said they should be able to tell me by the thirty-first whether.... " He hesitates again. "Whether it's working, I suppose."
Dean yanked Cas's silver blade out from its sheath. It was the only hard-edged tool within easy reach.
"I wrote a long message explaining it all," says Cas. "Asking for... advice, I suppose? Or just, I don't know, I suppose I just wanted to tell you about it. But then I thought I should ask what you were doing, and it turned out you were both preparing for a potentially dangerous evening. So of course the last thing you needed was a distraction, and I thought I shouldn't bother you right then." He pauses a moment, thinking. "Then it occurred to me that maybe I just shouldn't bother you at all. Because, I mean, you two are
Cas glances down at his own hand. "Sorry... of course," Cas mutters, and he finally manages to let go and step back.
Then he picked up "Rocky Mountain High" and looked at the first verse. Dean already knew it by heart, of course— he'd been singing it every day for weeks now— but now he saw the first verse printed in Cas's own handwriting:
It wouldn't have been bad, really, except that David was... well, not the person Castiel would have chosen. David had kind of an irritating laugh, and had already made a few crass comments about "back-alley whores" that had made Cas pretty annoyed. Also, David was not as clean as he could have been; his crotch, to be blunt, smelled bad. It seemed David's personal hygiene habits could use a refresher.
... and then, two minutes later, picking it back up again, wrapping it tenderly in the same handkerchief and carrying it right back downstairs again, still muttering, "I'm sorry, Cas."
don't have time..." he muttered, almost to himself, but he pulled his right arm out of his pocket and held out his hand.
His touch was quite soothing. Cas turned his face into Dean's shoulder. He was beginning to feel more and more absurd about the whole situation.
Cas paused, looking back at her, one hand still on the hanger. He'd never seen the movie Brokeback Mountain, but somehow he seemed to know the basic plot anyway: Brokeback Mountain was a famous movie about two cowboys who had fallen in love with each other, but who had never been able to reveal—to themselves or to anyone else— how they'd really felt.
After another long pause, Cas nodded. "I will tell you about my sparrows," he said, formally, "and you'll tell me about yours."
no god or angels, sort of a mirror but without myself — I watch it but I can't interfere. It's like the most ingenious clockwork toy, and it's turned out most fascinating, and—" He stopped at their appalled expressions. "Look, I
The butterflies must be reaching into Dean's mind somehow, plucking out random images and making hallucinations out of them.
"Great to see you too," said Sam, patting Cas's back gently with one shoe heel. "But I'm not the one who had the soul-bomb in his chest, remember."
to study him from this distance. He watched Dean's eyes darken, the pupils dilating a little, and heard his breathing go uneven again. Cas said, "Dean. As I said, I don't remember much. But there's something I'm certain of."
Dean couldn't help snapping. He reined himself in a moment later, saying, "I mean, we all ate them and we're all fine. Sorry she's feeling bad, though. I was gonna introduce her to Cas here. Sure she's okay out there? She need anything?"
A scant few seconds later the lake had vanished entirely, nothing left of it but a wide strip of brown mud.
An incredibly terrifying silence follows this disjointed statement. The silence seems to grow, and grow, till it's pressing down on the entire room like a tremendous invisible boulder. Finally Dean's compelled to break the awful silence with something, anything, so he takes a jerky breath and adds, "Anyway, it kinda is like that. I think."
"Maybe," Dean says. (For there's really no point in denying it.) "Maybe, yeah. But it's a hell of a lot better than you carrying it all on your own. This is what family is
"Okay, dude, listen to me," said Dean, starting to pace back and forth in his room. "Get those hand-warmers started, get your extra layer out and get it on, and get on back down to shelter."
Dean buttoned the jeans. They were warm and toasty. "Cas pulled me out," he said, briefly. "Right above the waterfall."
Dean looked around, a little disoriented. Cas was sprawled nearby, on his stomach stretched across the corner of a narrow bed, wings waving slightly as he blinked dizzily down at the floor. Sam was scrambling up from a muddy pile of rubber boots in the little room's corner.
"Forecasts have been converging on that outcome for a good ten years now," clarified the Princeton scientist, "and at this point we're just dialing in the exact rate at which it'll happen. But we all know that, right? Not a surprise by now. Anyway, to sum up my other main points—"
, but it had long been Dean's policy to stop and check on any random stranger that he encountered along the road. A pulled-over truck, a guy or two standing a little ways off the road, a tent in an unexpected place — he checked on everybody. And it wasn't just because of the potential "social activities." This was wilderness, after all, and it was Dean's job to keep everybody safe. (Or it was his self-appointed job, at least.)
"The ones you met weren't true dragons," says Castiel. "Or not the original dragons, I mean. They've just adopted that name. They're more just gold-hoarders, and they don't have true wings. We, um, what I mean is, real dragons do fly, and, um, anyway, to make these blades, we — ah — the dragon donates the claw voluntarily. The claws can get too long sometimes, you see, and then you have to trim them, and then the trimmed-off part can be carved into a blade. An angel-blade."
Dean, still sitting in his chair, took it numbly. Sam's forehead creased in concern as he looked at Cas, his eyes flicking briefly over the heart rate monitor and the breathing machine. "How is he?"
"More than a copy," said Cas, still looking at his hands. "There's scars I still have. There's certain feathers that were damaged in certain ways... the way the feather-vanes were torn, the way the shafts were broken... it's all precisely the same." A contemplative expression had come onto his face. "I wonder if he reassembled the original atoms? Jack or that entity, I’m not even sure who.... Or is it a copy that was somehow summoned from my own memory? Or maybe he, or they, performed a temporal adjustment, recalled the same vessel from an earlier point in time—"
.) And if the wounds were "a couple weeks old," it had probably happened right after Dean had sent Cas away from that Wyoming bar.
- and it was on him. Jets of semen shooting out, his cock twitching in Cas's mouth, Dean convulsing on the bed, both hands knotted in the sheets, nearly out of his mind at how good it felt.
Castiel returned occasionally after that. Always in the middle of the night. Always when Dean was at his lowest, when he felt the Mark gnawing at him so acidly that he feared he wouldn't last the night. Somehow Castiel knew which nights these were — Dean was never sure if Sam called him (or if Sam knew at all), or if Cas had some other way of sensing when Dean was particularly close to the edge. Dean never felt him arrive. But later Dean would come half-awake in the night to feel Cas's arms around him once more, and Cas's warm breath on his neck.
"I think these are protection runes," said Sam, wiping more of the tusk clean. "I just learned some of these. Protection against..." He peered at it more closely. "Heh. Fire. Of course." He turned to Dean with a grin. "Looks like this is our Fire Gate! And, you know what, this means that Elegua had some fans on both sides of the ocean. He wasn't just in Africa, I mean. He was here in North America too, assuming he helped set all this up. Just think of it, an angel spread his wings here... and then Elegua stabilized it. Maybe Elegua's worshipers helped with the tusks."
"Guess I'll never know what it mighta been like," Dean muttered to himself. "Guess I'll never fucking know, Cas, huh?"
Then Sam hesitated, looking at his hand. It was still blackened with the dark dust that had been coating everything— the black dust he'd wiped off the lever a minute ago.
Seminar set-up was well underway by the time they got to the dining hall. Shawn and Nicole were lowering blinds over all the windows to try to dim the main room a bit from the endless light, while Ryan set up the little projector, various other grad students bringing out extra chairs and tables. The rest of the chattering crowd were eating dinner, downing heaping plates of Teddy Bear's beef stew with slabs of his warm fresh-made bread. Dessert included peach cobbler and, an especially rare treat, a fruit salad.
Cas nodded. "Are not two sparrows sold for a penny, yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father's care," he said, finishing the famous quote. "Matthew 10:29. We were always taught that God grieves over the fall of every sparrow, even though nobody else may notice the little bird fall. It's become a shorthand among angels; in garrison terminology, sparrows are any events that may be deeply moving but are not of tactical significance. We are sent out into the world with a specific mission, you know, and there we see...." He hesitated, glancing at Dean again. "There's such pain in the mortal world, Dean. Such suffering. And when we leave Heaven, suddenly we witness it all — the grief, the love, the pain, all of it, such tremendous things. But we have to complete our mission. In the end we must return to the garrison to report, and there is a problem, you see, in which some of the angels become so... so moved, by what they have witnessed, that it becomes difficult for them to give an objective report. They can be so... very deeply moved, so, um, extremely affected, so...um... distracted—" He hesitated, as if groping for the right word.
"I do," said Cas. "I'm so grateful, Dean... I'll admit I've gotten rather attached to this vehicle. It looks so very beautiful. Thank you. Thank you so much." He glanced back at Dean. "Do you like it? The car?"
," Ted corrected him sternly. "Not that I'm boasting, but it's just the plain facts, right?" As Dean laughed again, Ted added, "People get serious about their berries up here, y'know. One of the great wild foods of the north. One of the few you can just go collect yourself. There's some real work that goes into a berry pie."
"Damn, wish we had more time," Dean murmured, a long moment later. "Cause I just thought of something else I'd love to try. Right here, right now, under the sun—"
It's a strange feeling. Like losing something he'd never even had. Of missing a chance that he hadn't even known he wanted.
Sam eventually got Dean to leave Cas long enough to chug a little water and down some energy bars (and they each took a discrete trip behind a nearby boulder to relieve themselves). Cas, meanwhile, got deeply engrossed in rearranging the feathers on his back between his wings, his long neck arced around to pull a few feathers loose and carefully preen all the others. (He incinerated the loose ones in a puff of flame.) Dean sat down cross-legged before him and watched him work on the feathers, still trying to take in the reality of what Cas was now.
"A prairie Heaven," Sam said, considering the idea. "Could be. Somebody like that. Somebody from the Great Plains... or the African savannah or Mongolia or something. Who knows."
"I swear it's around here somewhere," Dean said two days later, as he peered through the old Chevy's windshield at the ranks of trees. "Paid all that money to have the property lines re-surveyed and now I can't even find the damn place — wait a sec, there it is." He braked the old black truck to a halt, pointing.
," said Dean. He was standing at the lake edge, balanced a little precariously with his feet spread on two different tussocks. If they were all going to be on snow machines, they weren't restricted to having to use the lake perimeter road. They could go anywhere there was snow. This meant they might as well take the shortcut, straight across the lake ice — which was almost always, conveniently, covered with a layer of snow.
"Puff, the magic ... uh... dragon..." began Dean, singing a little slowly, feeling very uncertain. It sounded absurd, and Dean broke it off almost instantly with "Oh, hell, I can't sing for shit, Sam. Without the guitar this isn't going to work—"
, not a dimensional plane," said Cas, waving his hands around. "The Sun exists in all five planes, like Jupiter exists in all five planes." (
The lead caribou snorted doubtfully, and all three animals turned away and settled into a high-kneed, ground-eating trot, noses in the air and antlers tipped back. Dean stood still, watching them move; he'd seen caribou many times before but it was rare to get a view from so close. Maybe a caribou sighting wasn't as cool as a wolf sighting, but nonetheless it was impressive how easily they seem to glide across thick snow and over the incredibly bumpy tundra. "Don't you guys ever trip?" he murmured to them, but they just kept going. They were going north, straight up the second hill toward the sun, paralleling the boardwalk.
, Dean thinks. But a heavy sorrow seems to be settling over him, and he realizes there's a stupidly childish sense of rejection stirring around in him now, about how Cas had batted his arm away. It's totally illogical, but it's almost making Dean's eyes prick with tears.
And all he'd done wrong was to pop on down to Illinois for a little look around, ten years ago, and take one particular "vessel" instead of another one. What could harm could that possibly have caused? And for that tiny, infinitesimal transgression, he'd been exiled to the frickin' Arctic for forty-plus years! They'd stuck him about as far away from humanity as they could possibly get him... and it was abundantly clear that Castiel was an angel who enjoyed human company. Dean had been thinking about Cas's story for days now, and he still winced to think how lonely Cas must have been. He'd survived up here, sure; he'd been resourceful and clever. But it was very clear (to Dean, anyway) that he'd also been lonely. Achingly, desperately, lonely. Exiled from his own kind, barred from humanity too. And all those years he'd had his sadly crippled wings dragging at his back, reminding him at every step what he'd once been, and what he could never be again. Reminding him of everything he'd lost.
Cas interrupted him with, "I have to break the vial." He grabbed Dean by one hand and began to pull him to the little back door in the kitchen, repeating, "I have to break the vial."
Sam looked at him for a long moment, and finally shook his head. "Well, I've been running around all damn night looking for you. Went clear over to the next county and back, trying to follow the river. Finally Cas called, a little after dawn. Damn, never been so glad to see his name on the caller id. Knew right away he must've found you." Sam started handing Dean the dried clothes, adding, "Turned out Cas was in town looking for me, but by then I was way down the river road in the other direction." Sam then shot Dean a slightly nervous look. "We had a, um, a nice little talk actually. He apologized for being out of touch, by the way. Said he'd had some stuff going on." With an obvious effort at changing the subject, he said, "So, um, he said you fell in the river?"
Sam made a vague gesture up toward the sky, and said, "And now even Heaven's being eaten up, with I don't know how many souls in it... Hell's being eaten up, even the friggin'
Dean actually rolls his eyes at this. "What did I just tell you, about the I'm-fines? I swear, you better unlock this door, or I'm—"
Well, it was a fucked-up and illogical move in many ways, wasn't it? Arrogant, even, to think he could handle something like the actual Mark of actual Cain himself. Truth was, there were probably other ways to tackle Abaddon; there were a lot of other things they could have tried. Dean never really allowed himself to think much about why he'd done it. But the fact was that when Cain offered the Mark, the very first thought that sprang to mind was,
"I did, didn't I?" Castiel replied, with a little smile. "I'll try to keep my promise. Um, I really should get going; I need to dry off my, um, the contents of my pack before they — before it dries. I mean, before it dries... wrong. I mean, before it dries on its own. In the wrong shape. I mean — well, I'll be going now," he said. With a sudden, almost awkward lunge, Castiel took two quick steps forward, reached out and closed one hand (now much warmer) around Dean's.
Of course. The Topaz ice tunnel. The snowmelt streams around here could form all kinds of odd ice formations. And when ice and packed snow crusted over the top of a flowing stream, it could freeze over into a sort of roof. Meltwater carved out a tunnel in the snow underneath, and when the meltoff slowed and the stream shrank, the tunnel became passable. Hikeable, sometimes. Dean had even heard before that there was an ice tunnel somewhere around Topaz, though he hadn't been to this part of the mountain for years.
God nodded. "Even Lucifer retained a fragment of the original mission. I sometimes hear his thoughts too, you know, even now... He still is trying to collect human souls and bring them to him. Unifying human souls with his own." His eyes flicked to Sam, here, and Sam looked away.
Cas insists he loves this mix of tasteless breakfast goo, and tries to force some on Dean every morning. It's only edible if buried in about half a pound of the organic honey, but Dean piles on the honey and smiles and nods and chokes the stuff down.
"Your father is at peace," Castiel said, looking Dean directly in the eyes. "He is in Heaven. There is no pain now. No fear. The moment of death may have been awful, but it was brief, and
Dean thought, but this seemed altogether too dangerous a thought, and in the end Dean simply let Cas pat the boxers more-or-less dry with more handfuls of the dry pine needles. Castiel did not look at Dean at all during this boxer-drying process; in fact he was working with perfectly calm efficiency, his expression now a mask of calm, no emotion visible at all. (His touch, however, was extraordinarily gentle, as if Dean could be bruised by even the lightest of contact.)
But he did learn the second chord eventually, and the third. He started playing in the library occasionally. Dean had taken, by now, to hanging out in the kitchen nearby, listening to Cas's awkward strumming and wondering what he was working toward. It never made Dean's headaches any better, but he had to admit Cas was actually making some progress. Soon Dean was starting to think Cas might succeed some day at getting all the way through a genuine, entire song. (Though possibly at one-twentieth normal speed.)
Dean looked over what he'd written, hands on his hips. "You get the idea. We need to know where you went. The feet, truck, bike column is so we can look for the parked truck or the bike or whatever, to see where the bear jumped you or whatever happened. Or if you went by foot, then we kind of know how far you might've gotten. And the "overdue" is basically to give us a clue about, when should we really start to worry? Like, right now, the two of us might hang out at the sauna a while longer than I planned, but if it gets past the overdue time and we're still not back, that's when the other staff would swing into search mode."
"Dean, wait. Stop," said Cas. He had to grab Dean by the shoulder to make him stop running around collecting dollar bills.
A smile tugged at a corner of Dean's mouth. It was a good memory. Last summer had been fun. Big Seven had been by several times. It had been fun, sure.
, it seemed, somehow getting much, much taller. Even from a mile away it seemed to be reaching impossibly high, towering above them like some kind of unthinkably massive tsunami. Gabriel, who had taken a rear-guard position just a few wing-lengths behind Cas, seemed absolutely dwarfed in comparison. Gabriel really wasn't all that small at all (elephant-sized, Dean had to remind himself), but against that huge backdrop he looked tiny — a little feathered speck of green, against a gigantic roiling stormfront of black cloud that seemed to fill the whole world.
"BP's still dropping," reports one EMT to the other. The chopper's picking up speed. The distant glint of water disappears; the whole canyon recedes, flattening into the distance. The chopper crests a hill and then the entire canyon vanishes from view, its astonishing grandeur snuffed out completely by a low, unprepossessing hill of scrubby little pine. All that's visible now, in any direction, is open desert, and the millions of tiny little lumps of snowy sagebrush and rabbit-brush, and the endless little pines dusted with snow. Dean turns away from the window and folds both hands around Cas's.
Cas begins unrolling the sleeve of his sweater, working it back down his bruised arm in silence, and Dean watches as the bruises disappear under the familiar blue wool sleeve. Then Cas puts the hat back on his head, tugging it firmly into place with both hands. Again he feels lightly at the remaining tufts of hair, a move that Dean now realizes he's seen Cas do many times. Cas then wraps the scarf around his neck carefully, and he's soon all muffled up in the sweater, scarf and hat once more. It's a familiar look, but Dean's startled by how obvious it now seems that Cas is ill. He's thin — nearly gaunt, actually; he looks pale and worn, his skin dry and lined, his lips much more chapped than usual, and there are dark circles under his eyes. When Cas stands to put his jacket on, it now seems incredibly obvious that he's moving his arms quite gingerly, maneuvering both arms carefully into the jacket sleeves to try to avoid brushing the bruises. It seems so clear now that he's hurting. It looks like he can't even raise his arms very high, and there's an air of fatigue in all his movements.
But the next night, Friday night, doesn't really work out either. On Friday morning they have to re-station back near the Gas-n-Sip for a long three-day-weekend of work. And that means staying in the nearby motel again, the motel near the Gas-n-Sip — the "Colorado Border Special", as Dean's been calling it. And it turns out that the Colorado Border Special has two rooms available now, instead of just one. So Dean books two rooms for Friday night, and for Saturday night too.
says Cas. He glances, frowning, toward the area of invisible wing-warmth that's hovering just above Dean's shoulder. "You won't have seen them, but they look just
Maybe he and Sam were worrying about nothing? Maybe the sun "going blank" thing was just a coincidence?
Cas nodded. "I suspect so. Though it was still quite a powerful explosion. Obviously it shut me down for a while."
"Yeah, the... lesser realms, if that's what they're called," said Dean, nodding. "Uh... Please? Sir? Sirs?"
Cas went on, "Did you notice that the white-crowned sparrows have returned? They say that they — um — I imagine that they came over the mountains just now, right after the storm. They've been waiting on the south side for the weather to clear. A huge mixed flock. I've been listening to them. They all came over together just a few hours ago and they've already spread all over this area. There's a dark-eyed junco who got a little excited and came with them. He's rather confused now. He's a forest bird, you know. He was supposed to stay south of Atigun Pass, and now he's flown all this way and he's not sure what to do."
clear that you were in a river and that we would need a rope. So I grabbed my rope, and I ran. I may not be able to fly, but so long as I still have power I can run pretty well, even at night." He then added, "I was able to do a small discussion with the local river elemental along the way. She wasn't really all that cooperative, but I think I managed to convince her to at least let you try to swim. Do you think that helped?"
"NO!" Dean yelled, almost hyperventilating with panic. The feathered toes only tightened slightly around him, almost cradling him. Dean wanted to close his eyes, but he couldn't; he
Dean, startled, looked up at him, but Sam was already walking away down the hall, and soon they heard the
Dean's vaguely aware that he's raised both hands to his head, but it's not till he hears a worried "Dean?" (from Cas, behind him) that he realizes he's actually clutching at his head with both hands while he scowls at the painted pony. Dean takes a breath, makes himself lower both hands, and turns back around.
Dean set his hand on the side of Cas's jaw, cradling his face, as he had several times before. He said, looking very serious now, "We gotta get you sorted out first. I don't want to do anything else till I make sure you know everything. We gotta figure out what happened to you, and put you back together. And then... " Dean paused.
"Damn, Cas, I'm sorry," says Dean ruefully. He's starting to get worried. "I should've thought about the altitude thing. And I didn't meant to take you down the trail so far."
And then Sam and Sarah have to have their own long farewell hug. Which turns out to also include a totally public, and fairly long, kiss.
That was easier to talk about. "Not really," said Cas, looking over his shoulder again at the trenchcoat. "They're just.. a little sore. They've been aching a lot, the past few months. I think they were healing, maybe? From the burns. But I wasn't even aware that it was my wings that were hurting. I thought it was my shoulders. I never was really able to treat them, of course, all this time. There are ointments I could have used.... to try to preserve the feather-roots, I mean. That is, to try to... save the... uh...." Cas's voice trailed off.
"But," he said, turning back, "I used to still visit those last little hominids in East Africa from time to time. They'd always been so fascinating, and so clever and... It's hard to explain. In your kind, there was, and is, a... flexibility of the soul, I'll put it. A boundless capacity, one that can stretch in almost any direction. You humans can be violent and cruel, or you can be so kind and sympathetic. You can fall almost completely into hedonism — and just by the way, may I just mention there is no other species
"Quite all right," said Castiel, and there was a little half-smile quirking up one corner of his mouth, as if being caught nude by a near-stranger wasn't the least bit embarrassing. Castiel added, "I was just taking a quick bath."
"I'll be back in, like... two hours, minimum," says Sam carefully. "At the very earliest. Actually more like three now that I think about it. In fact, definitely three because I've got a few other errands. Maybe three and a half."
Sam blinked. "Whoa," he said. "Artifacts.... You just reminded me of something." He levered himself up out of his chair, took a couple long strides to the next library table and began searching through several precariously high stacks of books that were piled up at the far end of the table.
Dean was realizing now that the argument had probably been lost from the beginning. Nonetheless he couldn't help saying, almost begging, "You can't throw your life away, Sam. Please."
Dean's eyes slid to the Pluto video. Again Pluto sailed through space; again it disappeared. And it seemed then that Dean was almost viewing himself from outside; as if he, and not Pluto, was that little speck of light that was soaring helplessly through space to his doom. He saw his trajectory all at once, everything that had happened and everything he'd become, and he saw where he was now: all the obsessive treks up the hill, all the prayers, all the sleepless nights, the blinding guilt, the riveting obsession... he saw it all, in that moment. And he saw it for what it really was:
Cas said, "I couldn't find another job. I looked for weeks. I was tired of sleeping under bridges and on benches... it's really quite uncomfortable and I found I really didn't like being dirty. I wanted to be somewhere that had showers and somewhere to wash my clothes. I found a hostel downtown, where I stay. But I have to pay. I needed money, for food and shelter. I couldn't get a job. I looked. I couldn't. I was hungry, and I was cold. I found I can get twenty dollars for a handjob, or thirty for fellatio, or fifty for—"
Cas seems to be rambling a bit. His hands are moving a little restlessly too, on Dean's, tightening and loosening, tightening and loosening. There's a soft brush of warmth through the air, a soft fluttering. Like Cas's upper wing is fidgeting. And Dean's suddenly certain that if Cas were in his dragon form right now, one ear would be pointing forward and the other pointing back. Cas is uncertain about something. He's worried.
But, of course, "family" doesn't necessarily mean staying in touch. Come to think of it, family might actually not mean that much to an angel. One day Dean wonders if telling Cas "You're our brother" might even have given him the wrong idea. From the point of view of an angel who's been repeatedly abused, tortured and betrayed by his own siblings, for millennia, maybe being part of a family — and having new "brothers" — isn't really all that attractive an idea?
"Thirteen years...." Sam said softly. "And you're still trying to make a couple more payments on my last year, aren't you? That's why you're back up here this year."
Cas regained his footing only to sprint at top speed over the hill, actually running now, just as Dean realized what was going on: That jaeger. Cas had gotten hold of the black jaeger again.
"The town is too far for us to reach tonight," Cas said. "But I spotted a cabin on my way in, when I was running downstream after you. It had no sign of current habitation — I believe it's a seasonal vacation cabin that has been closed up for the winter — but with any luck we could shelter there. I think I can get us back to it. It's just a couple miles, I believe. This way."
It was far worse than that brief glimpse of Cas's wrists down in the library. This time Dean could see
. Blood is merely a form of water. This water will match the nature of the water around it — it will become blood — and it'll keep that water in its proper channels. Which is to say,
Cas shrugged one shoulder (this seemed to be as much as he could move without causing more pain). "It's only been ten days," he said. "This is about normal. For an angel-blade wound, I mean. You must remember, it always takes me a while to heal from these sorts of wounds."
The whole long hallway smelled faintly of that inevitable hospital smell - a mix of bleach, alcohol swabs and betadine. And maybe a faint tinge of the stale breaths of the sick and the dying. The smell brought back far-too-vivid memories: of Dad dying, of Bobby paralyzed, of Bobby dying, of Lisa nearly dying, of Sammy nearly dying. Dean had sat by hospital bed after hospital bed, far too many times, over his life. Keeping vigil. Waiting. Hoping.
"No, just blushed like a frickin' twelve year old girl and lost the ability to talk for like five minutes, that's all. Look, uh, just, uh, putting the puzzle pieces together here. Gimme a sec to adjust, okay?"
The crowd reaches "ONE!!!!", and then everybody's screaming "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" Behind them, Sarah and Sam get lost in a long, deep kiss. Noisemakers squeal from everywhere; a spray of confetti bursts over them, a thousand sparkly bits of glittery paper falling right down over Cas's and Dean's heads. Cas, unfazed, finishes his sentence with"— that if you wish some, ah, some freedom, if you would rather I... well, step away a bit, as it were...." He takes a deep breath and sits back. "I'll understand."
Also on the shelving, on the top shelf between all of Dean's clothes, were several huge black feathers nested together in a little stack.
, remember? And... didn't you hear his voice? And... he, he remembers when I was a little girl... last night he said he remembers making me pizza when I was seven. He made me pizza again ...."
And no matter how carefully Cas arranged the jacket's empty sleeves around him in the cold night, it did not truly keep him warm, and it really was not like a real embrace at all.
"Oh god Dean, what happened to him, holy fuck," Sam said, his hands shaking as he tried to pull Dean's hands off of Cas. "What happened, let me see,
Yep, probably just the light. Just like how that thing with the jaeger-feather had probably been just the light. Probably just the light and the sleep deprivation.
"Lucifer lives. Unfortunately. We did stop the Apocalypse, but Lucifer remains alive. There was a fight here — by any chance, when you came through, did you see a man in a leather jacket? Short blond hair? And a couple of other men? I was knocked out and I've got no idea where they went. Might they have gone through to your side?"
There was a little pause. Cas said, almost thoughtfully, "Why would you want to know if I'm okay in the snow?"
Cas smiles as he hands the sweatpants to Dean. But it's a warped and worried smile, only one corner of his mouth quirking up, and it somehow makes him look rather sad.
The road took him straight north. To vast I-90, which cut across the landscape from east to west, clear across North America in fact. The entire town of Missoula was nestled in the hills just south of I-90, such that a driver going north out of Missoula inevitably came to the intersection with I-90, where there was, of course, a strip of motels.
How he'd scrambled away, literally falling to the floor. How he'd actually been sick to his stomach... and how he'd ended up huddled on the floor for that long awful moment, curled up in real agony. He'd recovered rapidly, of course, but....
Cas was flapping pretty well by now, both ears practically glued backwards pointing to Sam and Dean, so they kept singing, hissing new lyric ideas to each other under their breath and adding new verses whenever inspiration struck.
It wasn't till he watched the firefighters hauling Dad out, with Dad swinging crazed punches at them, then screaming at them... then giving up and walking over to Dean, his steps slow... It wasn't till Dad sat down next to Dean, with such a quiet, stunned look on his face, that Dean's faith began to waver.
He straddled Dean, there on the blanket, straddled him and rode him, hard. They'd been switching around among innumerable positions every night, as if Castiel (well, and Dean, too) couldn't get enough of experimenting with every possible orientation and every possible angle. But this position, tonight, provided Dean with perhaps the most stunning view yet: Castiel above him, totally naked now, head tossed back, Dean's hands on Cas's cock as Cas slowly ground his pelvis into Dean's... and those wings. Those magnificent wings, lazily spread, outlined against the sunset sky, as the aspen trees whispered in the warm summer breeze, and the cottonwoods stood tall overhead.
Cas looked at him a long moment. "You would do all that when we've only known each other a few weeks?"
"Oh! I know!" Cas says suddenly, straightening up from the duffel bag. His face brightens; he's had an idea. "Come with me," he orders, and he spins and goes scampering down the stairs, still clutching Dean's white duck feather in one hand.
Dean also found himself continually biting his lip to keep from talking to Cas out loud, to ask what the diagrams were all about. The third time this happened, Dean stood from his chair abruptly and said, "Gonna go work on the cars."
," — while Sam, still cursing at top volume, stood on the pier wrapping his towel frantically around himself. Finally Dean pulled himself over to a little wooden ladder and scrambled up to join Sam. The wintry air, and even the falling snow, seemed almost warm after the bone-chilling lake water.
"Oh...right," was all Dean could manage. Weakly, he managed to ask, "Are the glyphs, um, are they like... made with... Sharpie?"
"Let's wait one more minute to see if anybody replies," said Dean. So they stood there together, Cas's wings arched around them both.
... and, too, Cas could feel the way Dean had just sucked in a surprised gasp of air. The way he'd just frozen still. Something had startled him.
come off, that it couldn't even shift from side to side, as if it were stuck somehow, anchored to Cas's back. It was only a fleeting impression, but it seemed to break the playful mood. Again Cas abruptly grabbed both Dean's wrists in his hands, this time pressing Dean's hands up over Dean's head. All his body weight was fully on Dean now, heavy and solid, almost crushing Dean down to the heather like a wall of muscle. Again that wild scent came to Dean's nose. There was a powerful impression, then, of Castiel as one of the lean wild muscled creatures of the tundra. Like the wolves, or the foxes, or the falcons that went soaring by. Something alien and strong, and very, very wild, was crouched over Dean, willingly, eagerly; between Dean's legs, grinding now against Dean's crotch, leaning heavily against Dean's torso (and now, nibbling at the side of Dean's neck). This time Cas wouldn't let go of Dean's wrists, and he had Dean
Dean's so distracted and tense now, and also so exhausted, that he forgets all about muting the sound. When he powers on the TV there's a blast of deafening Spanish so loud it makes him jump, and it takes several agonizing seconds to find the mute button. Those few seconds seem like years, but finally Dean finds the right button, jabs it desperately, and at last a quiet silence settles over the room once again. Dean darts a guilty glance over at the bed, but, miraculously, Cas's eyes are still closed.
"So he really did fly, huh?" says Sam with a grin. "He mentioned that just now, but I wasn't sure if it was, like, metaphorical or what."
After a moment Cas gives a small sigh. He removes his hand from Dean's, and puts his arm back down on his stomach.
Dean paused there, pressing against Cas full-length now. Dean buried his face in Cas's neck again and he let out a long sigh. He didn't move for a moment.
He'd been in the habit of humming some of Cas's songs anyway — it seemed to settle his mind — but now he was trying to learn to play them on guitar, too. Every day at noon, for his lunch break, Dean went up to Cas's corner in the attic and put in an hour's practice on the guitar. (The lunch break never seemed to involve much eating.) He included the entire hour as part of the noontime prayer, chatting to Cas the entire time while he practiced the chords. And every day at the end of the hour, Dean always tried to play at least one song in full for Castiel, picking out one sheet from Cas's stack of songs and trying to play it all the way through without stopping.
