“I need to go out for a minute,” he said, voice low. Sherlock’s eyes were closed. He didn’t respond. “I’ll get Mrs. Hudson to sit in the living room if you need anything. I’ll be right back. Ok? Sherlock?"
“Anderson and Donovan bet you were high.”
“This coming from the man who grows mould experiments in the kitchen sink,” John said, grabbing a clean t-shirt and his pyjama trousers.
“I wasn’t trying to make it interesting for you. This is my holiday, Sherlock, not a puzzle for you to solve. Believe it or not, some things have nothing to do with you at all.”
John remembered,
“But that hook could have been there for years; maybe the last tenants used it—”
Lestrade wanted to object to this on the grounds that he was a grown man who would do what he liked. However, something about Mycroft’s demeanour, his ability to subdue Sherlock, and his umbrella, prevented Lestrade from protesting. There was also the fact, Lestrade had realised last night, that no one had contacted Mycroft about Sherlock’s overdose. He’d appeared at the hospital before anyone had even discovered his connection to the boy in room thirty-four. Lestrade firmly decided against crossing him.
here?” his voice croaked with disuse.
“And you,” she said, looking over at the detective, “well, you don’t belong here at all, do you?”
John looked up, startled.
Mycroft ended the call and, frowning, placed his phone down on his desk.
"The game is on, John! I have an idea! There's information to be collected, people to be tracked down. Not a moment to lose!"
John laughed and Sherlock glowered.
“Look at me,” John repeated, steady.
“Do you actually have
Lestrade watched Sherlock and John get into a cab and drive off.
Mycroft went to the hospital. She was unconscious. The doctors said she wasn’t responding well to treatment.
“All living things die,” Sherlock sneered, “whether you love them or not, everybody knows that.”
“Perhaps a bit,” Sherlock conceded, familiar mischievous gleam in his eyes. He took a step forward, blocking John up against the wall. It was closer than anyone else would have stood, but that was Sherlock.
“Good,” Sherlock replied. “Then I suggest you get on with that and let me continue with my work, which incidentally involves
"How close… should we be standing?" John asked. There was just a thin gap between them.
“How’s that going?”
"Mmm," John said. "Difficult." He slumped back onto Sherlock's shoulder.
They drove off just as the last hues of colour were fading from the sky.
“I have spent the past four hours
Still he wasn’t thrilled about it. John let his gaze travel over the living room, thinking that he didn’t understand the concept of heaven. How could you be happy anywhere if your consulting detective isn’t there with you? To play the violin or burn holes through your tables; to play Cluedo with you or to wake you up in the middle of the night with questions about cirrhosis; to help you on with your coat or follow you around the flat complaining about everything; to push you out into the night after murderers, running at your side?
"Fine. But don't come back here with Risk or some bollocks. Pick something appropriate for our… current mental… functioning…" Words were so funny. John's face hurt from laughing. They'd been laughing all night. Mood-elevator drugs were good for mood elevating.
“I know,” John called back from the kitchen. “I remember.”
completed
He was briefly roused back to consciousness when Sherlock re-entered the room.
A pause.
“No. It’s only a catalyst. It triggers an effect that tricks the body into killing itself. Evidence of the poison could only be found by someone who knows exactly what he’s looking for. And no one knows that, except me.”
He pulled down his trousers wondering fleetingly if this were one of those Bit Not Good things, but responded to himself indignantly that he was not going to sleep in military trousers
He ran, desperate to break through the fog, to see something, anything. He needed to wake up. Where was Sherlock? He needed to hear his voice. But there was nothing beyond the fog. Soft, damp grass and thick, grey fog. He had to try to get out. Why hadn’t Sherlock come to see him? What if— But no. He couldn’t consider the possibility.
John exhaled, “Fine, I give up.”
Sherlock gave him a bewildered look. “Is there a reason you’re brandishing shampoo at me?”
“Jesus,” John said, examining his pupils, “you are high.” He let go of Sherlock’s face and felt a lingering burn on his fingers from the contact. Some drug. No wonder sex workers found it useful. “What were you doing? Eating the lip stuff in the cab?”
John was looking at Sherlock with raised eyebrows. “So this could be it then. This case. It could lead us straight to Moriarty, or at least one of his top players.”
And yet he wasn’t. He wasn’t here at all. The liminal space of a coma. He could take John’s hand and still not be able to reach him.
John listened as the pieces fell into place.
"Ow," John said to the newly empty living room. His neck hurt like hell. His shoulder was stiff. He didn't remotely understand how Sherlock could spend the night on the floor and still jump up as agilely as a child. It wasn't fair. How could a thirty-two-year-old man spend his days crawling around the pavement on his knees and never feel the aches and pains of age?
“Nicked his badge again?” John remarked as they walked through the front door.
The consulting criminal pouted. “All right, all right,” he drew the syllables out with his reluctance. “But think about it, Sherlock. You can’t continue like this”—he slid the goggles back on—“you know you can’t.” He put the snorkel in his mouth and pushed himself off the bookcase into the water.
Moran looked toward Russians. “My apologies for the interruption. I assure you it will be dealt with appropriately.”
“That’s not true,” Sherlock said, unblinking.
“Yes,” Sherlock addressed the ceiling. “Its conversational skills have declined alarmingly. I’d say Alzheimer’s if it weren’t already dead.”
“But boring,” Tweedledee objected.
“Hi,” she said uncertainly.
“Are there any of those people left? I thought you destroyed his network.”
John walked into the wrong room and the nurse there gave him a strange look. He needed to focus. He had another patient to see. He couldn’t think about what he’d done or the likelihood that when he got home Sherlock would give him another awkward speech about being married to his work and, trying at his best ‘polite’ tone, ask John to find a new flat. That would be the worst of it, if Sherlock affected some kind of detached attempt at ‘polite’ with him. They were so far beyond that first night at Angelo’s. If Sherlock pulled anything like that again John might finish the job the attacker had started in the warehouse last night.
“Sure, I’ll just be a moment.”
Now the wrist was throbbing with the rapid beating of Sherlock’s heart; so full of life and energy he could feel it fluttering wildly against his palm. John sucked in a sharp breath at experiencing the sensation his brain had only simulated in dreaming—willing a heartbeat into veins that had been devastatingly still.
was not what he was looking for. He didn’t need Sherlock to wait politely for him at crime scenes, to be considerate and gentle, to text him and ask him how his day was going, to hesitantly confirm his actions were ok with John before he did them, to be patient and understanding with his words. He wouldn’t be Sherlock if he did any of those things, and John wasn’t interested in anyone who wasn’t Sherlock.
Sherlock didn’t respond. She finished unbuttoning John’s shirt and spread it open.
“He’s direct isn’t he?” Bauer said to John, who merely twitched his mouth to a half-smile. She looked back at Sherlock and said, “Well, I think it’s good to be assertive.” She licked her lips unconsciously and he was aware of John rolling his eyes next to him. If John had changed his mind about the necessity of playing polite, perhaps he would be able to properly cringe at the couch now.
John smiled. “Preferable, yeah.” It was the understatement of the century.
His work was brutal; the two years spent sabotaging Moriarty’s network were a torturous test of his physical endurance, which added strain to his mental stamina. And not having John with him only made things that much worse. He wasn’t lying when he returned and told John, “I’ve nearly been in contact so many times.”
“Then why isn’t he—”
It wasn’t until the second day that she realised Sherlock had been intermittently snorting cocaine from the start, and that Billy had been slipping it to him on each of his visits. The only thing that kept her from slapping him across the face and dialling Lestrade immediately was the vague understanding that all of this was somehow connected to John. Based on Sherlock’s manic behaviour, the fact that John hadn’t appeared once in the lab, and despite John’s text claiming he was fine, Molly knew there was something wrong. It was only the thought that John could be in danger that made her hold her tongue.
Sherlock was walking around to the right side of the building and John followed him. When he came to a stop they were standing in an alley that separated their victim’s building from the one next door. They were reconstructed historical flats: Only four storeys high. Sherlock was scanning it from the base up. He replied distractedly, “One black and one navy.”
John demanded, startled into peals of laughter. Sherlock laughed with him and John hoped they weren't loud enough to wake up Mrs. Hudson. God, what time was it? It must be past three o'clock in the morning.
“What is this supposed to mean then?” Sherlock demanded, brandishing the poem at John. “Has he changed his mind? Is he telling me he was wrong?”
John shook his head in feigned admiration. “Lesser men have been trapped at parties for much longer.”
“How good a shot are you?” Sherlock asked in the corridor behind the Leinster Gardens façade.
“Perhaps he mentioned an injury?”
,” Sherlock tossed the word out in frustration. “I can’t think clearly with it in my head." He motioned to the book and teacup floating past between their boots. "Look at this!”
“Amy Elliott died in a car crash earlier this month when her body was flung through the windscreen of Brandon Riley’s car. Riley also died on impact,” Sherlock stated.
Sherlock’s expression remained fixed, but Mycroft observed the twitch of his fingers on the bedspread. “Where is he now?”
“Traditional. You and I have never really gone in for that,” Moriarty said a bit distractedly as he cast his gaze around the library. He whistled. “Wow, what a mess!” His eyes snapped back to Sherlock and they were shining with glee. “This is fabulous, is it not? To think I ever bothered aiming guns at John Watson.” He giggled. “All I had to do was let him
John sat down hard in his chair.
"Nope." Sherlock kept his eyes on the screen in front of him.
Sherlock stood and John looked up at him.
“This is not what I was expecting,” John said as they stepped out of the cab.
“You weren’t looking for him,” John said, standing.
was an interesting turn of events, although not unexpected. As little patience as Sherlock had with people in general, he’d always seemed to have less with women.
“Oh really,” John said, not overly glad to know he’d been drugged.
“Trust me when I say I’m just as disappointed about it as you are.” It was a strange sensation, to be physically so relaxed while mentally knowing death was imminent.
Sherlock sighed dramatically and flopped backward in his chair, tilting his head back. “And…” he said slowly. John waited. “And my skull’s become boring.”
Lestrade had called for the thirty-eighth time since John had been back from the hospital (Scotland Yard needed him for a hundred things, as usual, but most importantly this time they needed his testimony for the Moran case), but he’d been putting them off until he felt John was recovered enough to leave him. And still he’d stationed Mrs. Hudson in the flat as a precaution.
“I didn’t—” Sherlock paused. “I wasn’t aware of the extent to which you would be affected by my absence.”
“Yes, it will be quite upsetting if you miss it,” Moran agreed. “But, on the other hand, the end goal
“It’s not fair!” Sherlock sniffed, already improving his ability to stop his tears, learning not to cry.
John waded back to consciousness after the deepest sleep he’d had in months. He pried his eyes open and slowly registered his surroundings. Green walls, dark wood… He rolled onto his back. Ceiling fan… water damage… Not his and Mary’s bedroom… Not Kensington… Baker Street. John exhaled remembering yesterday’s events. There was no more Mary.
Lestrade and John looked at him blankly.
“It really could be a coincidence though,” John said, doing his best to ignore the deluge of sensory memories, warm skin and the soft press of limbs, threatening to derail his focus. He was feeling lightheaded from the crouched position and possibly from inhaling the scent of Sherlock’s hair too deeply. God, what was wrong with him? He was stone cold sober this time.
John had always had a hot temper. Sherlock, Mary, his therapist, Harry, pin machines…  They all knew that a row with him usually resulted in collateral damage. He’d never hit anyone he cared about (unless Sherlock hit him first, or unless Sherlock pretended to be dead for two years), but there were enough wounded coffee tables and tea mugs to testify that his anger was not something to be trifled with.
“It was surprisingly easy to do once I realised what needed to be done. You fit,” he said simply. “You fit in my life and it turns out my emotion for you fits in my mind palace.”
“Oh, all right, now you’ve done it. I was going to push the button that turns this cab into a hovercraft but now you can forget it.”
“Why are you talking about me going insane as though it’s both impending and inevitable?”
This was his mind; he didn't want John to say things like that. What was making him say that? "Don't leave." He reached out and found John's waist, fingers bunching in the material there. "Whatever it is I'll fix it."
"The girlfriend who died in the car accident. She doesn’t have scars but I want to check her blood too.” Sherlock turned back to Hannah. “In the meantime, we’ll require any information you have on the three corpses."
“Now,” Sherlock continued, “say one night someone replaces Karina’s lip gloss without her knowledge. Same container, same lip gloss, different drug. Not a harmless mood-elevator but a deadly, slow-acting poison. Whoever she kisses that night gets a death sentence about two weeks out.”
“Is he surprised, Boss?” the other voice wanted to know.
John turned to leave but Sherlock caught his wrist.
It was a new level of genius for Sherlock and Mycroft was impressed. He had a good knowledge of chemistry himself, but he’d never been passionate about it the way Sherlock was. Mycroft had never been given to passion of any kind. Generally he viewed it as an unnecessary excess of emotion. But passion was Sherlock’s greatest strength as well as his biggest flaw. It drove him to breathtaking heights, but gave him much further to fall. Mycroft had always been steadier, climbing securely from one place to the next, always in control. The result was that he occupied arguably the most powerful position in England while Sherlock was internet-famous for being the detective in the funny hat.
clothes, not to mention the exorbitant cost of such a practice) had been enough to make John grit his teeth and go himself.
When Sherlock had come back to London John was already living with Mary, already proposing to her. This time he would have to watch from the beginning. The new relationship, the increase in time spent together, John leaving in slow motion, day by day, slipping away. He shut his eyes. Perhaps he could convince John to join the clergy—take a vow of celibacy. Sherlock supposed he was not the ideal candidate for clergy recruitment.
Sherlock’s phone buzzed against the stack of books it was balanced on.
“Are you suggesting it’s a coincidence?”
“What?”
Sherlock grinned. “I can tell you the brand, if you want to know.”
“Oh, the prostitute you think poisoned Rodgers, Parker and Riley.”
John glared. "Sherlock, this is serious. It's going to be humiliating when I step all over her feet."
John rocked back on his heels to get a look at the ceiling. “You knew. All this time you knew I was lying.”
It’s a moving experience to watch Sherlock Holmes at a crime scene. It doesn’t matter how many times he’s done it before, John is never bored. It’s like watching a performance. Flawless. Art heightened to precision. And Sherlock is elegant. He walks slowly, seemingly casual, but John knows it’s controlled. Carefully controlled. Because Sherlock’s energy is electric and John can feel the hum of it in the air. The detective’s bright eyes sweep the scene, reading invisible information. He’s completely engaged; he’s fascinating.
It didn’t matter what Sherlock wanted. He couldn’t stand back and watch his mind palace—his life’s work—be destroyed by tidal waves of sentiment. He couldn’t lose everything he was, everything he had built himself to be—he couldn’t lose it all to intoxicating floods of desire. He couldn’t be Sherlock Holmes without clarity of mind.
Sherlock crossed his arms. "I thought you liked to be included in these little projects."
“I believe he said Switzerland.”
“I did not know.”
hadn’t even had sex with his
he thought, knowing he would never forgive himself if he was too late.
“Oh god, which one is that?” John put his hand to his brow trying to remember the most recent seminar he’d attended for GPs about the latest club drugs in London.
“Wh—” John didn’t get to finish the word.
John cocked the gun and Moran looked up. He smiled, a look of recognition crossing his face. He opened his mouth and John shot him through the forehead before he could say his name.
There were no visible injuries on him, yet Sherlock knew if he shook him he wouldn’t wake. He was here.
“Right. You
John frowned. “Are you ok?”
“Jsi natvrdlá? Podej mi to podělané sklíčko!” he yelled.
"Do I have to?"
“No, it’s new. Very new. That metal hasn’t even seen rain.”
“Ok, Sherlock,” John sarcastically repented, shrugging his shoulders and lifting his hands. “Forget my suggestions then. I’m just saying that even people with average intelligence find ways to entertain themselves. Since yours is slightly above average”—Sherlock made a strangled noise—“I figured you’d be able to think of
Information acquired John retreated to the living room. Sherlock would probably sleep for a while. When Sherlock did sleep, and on the rare occasions he slept in his bed (as opposed to kipping on the couch), he slept late. Sherlock was simultaneously the fastest, most energetic man he’d ever met and the laziest: His endlessly enigmatic flatmate.
“Thanks,” he murmured when Sherlock seemed satisfied and stepped back.
He supposed it was a bit ironic, thoughts of John causing him to reach for his syringe. Because just short of Mycroft there was no one who would disapprove more. He could almost see John’s tight lips, the tension in his jaw, expression a mixture of a doctor’s disdain and a friend’s concern.
. But for some reason, despite knowing Sherlock’s motive, Mycroft continued to allow him to invent new ways to pickpocket his wallet. Perhaps Mycroft’s passivity about this was a manifestation of Caring about his brother’s financial situation.
John wasn't sure he wanted to know what that meant. Not that it mattered. Figuring out what Sherlock was on about before he explained was an impossible task even when sober. In his current state John might as well try to figure out the logic behind Sherlock’s sock index, for all the success he was going to have. (He’d puzzled over it in the past, and had a vague horror that it might have as much to do with thread count as it did with colour and style.)
He looked over and was surprised to see Sherlock glance at him with what almost looked like uncertainty. But it was gone from his face almost as soon as he’d seen it.
“Not very well. They’d been mates for a few years; I’d seen him around once or twice.”
John’s hand skimmed from the scar lightly across his chest and he heard Sherlock’s breath hitch. The effect of the drug, he knew, would intensify the touch. Sherlock’s chest was smooth, virtually hairless. John didn’t think he had ever seen Sherlock with facial hair either. The detective was meticulous about shaving and also (John had been amused to note) just not very good at growing facial hair.
“No, no, no, it’s not that. You always were
, his crack in the lens—
The detective scrubbed his hand over his face. His skin was even paler than usual. When was the last time he’d eaten? With a sinking feeling like cold lead John realised that in the chaos of the ball, the strip club, the cemetery, he had forgotten to make Sherlock eat.
"John, this is Mrs. Avery," she said almost as soon as they entered the ballroom.
seen Sherlock look like that somewhere before… When was it? John grasped for the memory.
But despite everything, here John was anyway. For John to leave Mary—for him to have known the potential for a different life and still to choose to come back to Baker Street—on his own volition, actually
John looked out the tinted window at the passing streets and allowed himself to acknowledge that his remark may not have been entirely sarcastic. Underneath his principal annoyance at being shanghaied, he found the smallest amount of pleasure in the familiarity of the situation. This was life at Baker Street; it wouldn’t be complete without routine kidnappings by Mycroft’s lackeys.
John crossed his arms, listening. Sherlock liked the way John listened. It was much better than the way anyone else listened.
“You didn’t want to find them yourself?”
“I LIED,” Sherlock raised his voice. “There was a different reason why I didn’t contact you.”
“And his shoes,” Sherlock continued, moving down toward the man’s leg. He slipped a shoe off and indicated the back heel. Look at the scuffing pattern, very specific, both heels. Combined with the bruising on the wrists I’d say it was fairly obvious his body was dragged.”
“Sherlock! What are you doing here?” John asked, stepping out and shutting the door behind him. “You look, erm—” John was not at all sure why he had started that sentence, or where it was going. Fortunately he didn’t have to finish it.
“I’ve told you so many times! I thought I would lose you if he told you about me! I didn’t want you to leave. I wanted-”
“I’ll bet.”
“Are you making a point?” he asked as he checked the message.
“Anytime you’re finished,” Sherlock said in a clipped tone, “you may remove yourself from my Nilsen shelf.”
Tweedledee fetched another chair and Moran sat down in front of Sherlock.
But a few weeks later the boy showed up again, and then again some time later. His name was Sherlock Holmes, Lestrade learned, and of course no one listened to him. He sounded insane and he looked like an addict. He
“Really?” It was John asking.
Really real TAB spoilers this time. A Johnlock argument of events. In other words, all the spoilers.
John swung his leg up and
"No," Sherlock said. John believed him.
By the time Sherlock stepped back, and John’s scattered thoughts were able to reorder themselves, he regretted what he’d said. He even got as far toward telling the truth as, “Actually—” before Sherlock interrupted him, asking for her phone.
“Well,” John gave her hands an apologetic squeeze before extracting them from his own and stepping back, “it’s for the best…”
“Would you just answer the question please?” John snapped.
John heard the rattle of the fence. Laughter.
“The cuts were light, thin, which is why the scars are that silver colour. And the location makes them easy to hide.”
Once these arguments came back he couldn’t stop them. John squeezed the pillow tighter, bracing himself for the next memory being swept at him in the flood.
“You shouldn’t have to.”
“No,” Sherlock muttered, distracted.
“Thank you, Molly,” he repeated.
“You know, it’s great when you do the whole ‘waiting until the last moment to fill me in’ thing, but if you’re going to be cutting at me with knives and collecting my blood like a mad—”
The flush at John’s neck deepened and he cleared his throat. “Me, I meant. Er, running.” He shook his head, closing his eyes as if to focus on getting the words out in the right order. “I meant, I think I’ll go for a run.”
Or perhaps not entirely without warning. Sherlock, considering his specific skillset, would have been hard-pressed not to notice John’s weight loss, his stress levels, his exhaustion from sleepless nights over the past year and especially in the last few months. The signs of an unhappy marriage were all there. Sherlock had just preferred not to officially file them, because John was supposed to be with Mary. There had been a wedding. He’d said goodbye to his flatmate and embraced Mr. and Mrs. Watson. He’d known it was for the best, and all evidence to the contrary had been ignored. Yet here John was, standing in the doorway with suitcases and looking at Sherlock and being entirely un-ignorable.
to fall in love with someone of either gender. It’s less likely for someone closer to one side of the spectrum, but it’s not impossible.”
“What about the movers? The guys who put the body in the armoire? Did Lestrade find them?”
John shook his head. “I’m returning it.”
Sherlock’s phone was in his pocket. There was no chance of being able to get to it while his hands were bound behind the back of the chair. No possibility to contact John. Well, he said he would finish this case alone, and now it looked like he was going to. They had enough evidence to arrest Moran for Karina’s death. The drugs would have been a nice bonus, but barring any deus ex machina level intervention, they were going to complete the trade tonight and get away with it.
Sherlock was watching John’s face steadily. “I can’t empathise with you, John. But you’re an idiot if you don’t know you’ve been my priority from the day we met.”
“Sherlock! Erm, hi! I was just coming to—Did they release you already?”
“I suppose you also weren’t aware that the
“All right, Shezza?”
John grabbed Sherlock’s left hand and before he could pull it back ran a disinfectant cloth over the cut. It stung. The doctor wrapped Sherlock’s hand in gauze and Sherlock wished he were dead. Moran was right. He was self-centred. If he were dead he wouldn’t have to witness this: John taking care of him, not yet knowing he was dying and that Sherlock had allowed it to happen—these last precious moments of light before the swiftly encroaching shadow.
“Thank you.”
Mary Oliver, “Wild Geese”
“You promised we’d spend last weekend together. You promised you’d call me last week. You promise a lot of things, John.”
“I thought—” John started.
“No, I’m not angry,” John said, crossing his arms over his chest.
There was a long silence in which John wasn’t even trying to think of a response. Words drifted aimlessly in his mind; his thoughts scattered and blurred. A coherent sentence seemed an unreasonable request.
Happy New Year and happy Abominable Bride watching! If the next chapter's not up on Monday you may assume I've fallen into a Victorian Homles-and-Watson induced swoon, and will be out of commission (probably babbling about needing a blond-haired, blue-eyed army doctor) for the foreseeable future.
Sherlock was sitting next to the window and John was practically draped over him in a slump.
The rain picked up and was coming down heavily by the time they reached a main road where they could catch a cab.
The Englishmen stepped lightly over the bodies as they approached Sherlock.
He’d only seen it for what it was on the surface: a misguided exploration of a case from the past, loosely linked to the possibility of Moriarty’s reappearance. Now he knew what it really had been. It had been a warning. A precursor to exactly what had happened with John in the cemetery tonight.
"So tell us, Hannah, do you have us up at six on trumped up claims as an excuse to meet your favourite blogger and take a 'selfie' in our flat, or is it possible you've actually brought us something interesting?"
John must have looked noticeably pained because Sherlock added, “The importance of history to my work cannot be overestimated. Crimes are rarely original. If I know the antecedent case then I can solve the repeat that much faster.”
John scoffed, “No you didn’t.”
Sherlock reached out and languidly tapped the keyboard. The tab switched to Twitter. Bauer’s latest tweet informed anyone who cared to know that he would be spending the evening in, binge-watching telly. Sherlock unconsciously wrinkled his nose in distaste as he reread it, and John felt a small smile tug the corner of his mouth.
John walked into the bathroom as determinedly as his hangover would allow. He grabbed Sherlock’s shampoo and conditioner. He marched up to the conceited ball of ego in his living room and shoved the products in his face.
They ignored her.
“So this murder, you think it could be the work of Moriarty, or one of his men?”
Look, I’ve got toast. What do I need pasta for?”
“Why haven’t you contacted her?”
"Oh." He got up. "You're really going to—"
Heat was radiating around his wrist as John stood and walked forward. The constant pressure and warmth on his skin was combating the numbness that had nearly overwhelmed him before. The fog swirled and parted as he moved. He held his left wrist where he thought Sherlock’s hand was.
“But please don’t make me do that. I’m not as patient as you are, you know that. I need you to wake up, and I think you will, because since the day we met you’ve been there when I needed you and you’ve done what I’ve asked. You’ve been my flatmate, my blogger, my doctor… the only friend I’ve ever—the only person…”
“Mrs. Hudson,” John cut in.
“We worked everything out so nicely,” Tweedledee pouted.
“You—you redesigned your mind palace?”
But it didn’t prevent her from following Billy out into the corridor the next time he appeared, cornering him against the door and demanding to know why he was giving Sherlock drugs.
Sherlock cringed. “Was that necessary?”
It was a long time since he’d had any cocaine, but he remembered the frankly dazzling speed at which his brain could work when stimulated with the drug. If nicotine was good for brainwork then cocaine was truly excellent. Short-term brainwork, of course. Sherlock also remembered the rather unpleasant crashes coming down from the high, but that was no matter now. He was not going to rest until he found an antidote. It could take days and he would need the drug to keep him going. But no, he didn’t have days. John could be dead tomorrow—Sherlock’s eyes slammed shut as the thought seared his brain.
If Sherlock hadn’t thrown out the receipt, John would have shredded it. It was, by far, the most flattering thing he’d ever worn. It fit him somehow even better than his wedding suit. The cut was slimmer and the material exquisite. It had obviously been tailored exactly to his measurements.
Sherlock flinched, fresh tears springing to his eyes. “Good,” he said, not meeting Mycroft’s eyes but glaring at his chest. “Because I don’t love you either! I hate you!” He ran to his bedroom, slamming the door behind him.
It was evening already when Sherlock was finally walking home. He had spent a fruitless night and day following up leads on abandoned warehouses that could be suitable for storing large shipments of narcotics. He supposed it was a slim chance that the drug deal Mycroft had mentioned in connection with Carl Reeves would involve Moran, or involve him directly even if it involved his gang, but it was worth investigating. Especially when you were avoiding your flatmate (and therefore your flat).
he’d ask it with his forceps and dissecting probe. But gently. The brain that tortured John at night was the same one that chose his jumpers in the morning. The same one that knew how to make risotto with peas and could fire kill shots though a window. The same one that teased Sherlock about his coat and his cheekbones and made them giggle at crime scenes. It was the same brain that had chosen to come back to Baker Street.
“Huh,” John said. Sherlock watched as he opened the fridge and moved the new blood packets to the apparently less objectionable space on the fridge door.
“Upstairs, five-twenty-one.”
as much as my wedding suit, and I know how much I spent on that. I mean, thank you, but I can’t accept it. No way. It’s too expensive. I won’t wear it.”
“I won’t have you sitting in all night watching me like a concerned nanny.”
"All right, how about Pil-lock? Or Bol-lock—"
John had kissed him. Once, lightly, chastely, and then again more firmly, intentionally, but pulling back soon after—not insisting, not asking for anything. The kiss had been brief, like a statement. An affirmation. But it had been tender too—a gentleness Sherlock didn’t expect to be directed toward him. John was often rough with him, pushing back harder whenever Sherlock pushed him. But Sherlock hadn’t pushed him this time.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s a well-written piece.”
“Oh Sherlock, you get bored of everything. When are you going to get bored of sarcasm?”
“Ok,” Lestrade said, clearly working to control his voice, “is there a reason you
John was sliding off his belt. He pulled down his trousers.
Their footsteps were muted on the soft, grassy path between the row of graves. The glow of lamplights from the street tinged the dark around them, but John kept his eyes on the brighter cut of light from the torch as it slid across the gravestones, illuminating each in turn.
“Next time I may just let the strangler kill me,” Sherlock grumbled.
John’s gaze was locked on a kitchen window he wasn’t seeing. That’s right, much more convenient for Mary to shoot Sherlock than to tell John the truth.
John had kicked the sheets off of his legs, lying on his back, upper body twisted in them. He moved again, violently tossing to his right, and flipping onto his back again.
Molly had her number; she would call just to be sure.
Sherlock gripped John’s sheets as another wave of venomous thoughts ripped through him. He couldn’t do this. He wasn’t strong enough. He was weak.
Sherlock lowered his violin. “Do you want me to make a joke by saying it’s something other than a tuxedo?”
“Are you all right?” Sherlock asked, eyes flicking again to the bandage and wondering if his friend hadn’t broken.
They dropped into the seats and Sherlock leaned over, “Act interested,” he said close to his ear, probably forgetting that John was the sort of goldfish who would not have to be instructed to ‘act interested’ in a topless dancer. “We need to look no different than these brainless idiots across from us.”
“Do we have to see his legs?” John tried. “Can’t we just question him about Riley’s scars and get him to tell us what we need to know?” If Tony Bauer was close mates with one of their victims, Brandon Riley, there was a good chance he’d know something about it.
This was the best part. After they made it through a case, scraped and bruised they could laugh about the whole thing over whisky and takeaway. Not that John’s stomach would be up for either any time soon, but they’d get there. They had time now. Eventually they’d get there.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.
“We have to get out of the camera’s range,” he muttered, steering him around the corner.
It had been a longer than usual day at the surgery and when John checked his watch it confirmed the time was already six o’clock.
But even if John wasn’t capable of reciprocating, and even if Sherlock didn’t recognise his own feelings (Lestrade knew the cold logician considered himself above feelings, just as he did everything else), Lestrade could say without hesitation that John Watson had been, by far, the best thing that could have happened to the self-destructive genius he’d met all those years ago. John grounded him, stabilised him, humanised him, made him smile (not smirk). And Lestrade was glad to see it. As obnoxious as the consulting detective was, he truly did care about him. Certainly more than he’d ever admit to Sherlock’s smug face.
“I know, I know…”
When they had made it through the set of steps multiple times in a row without error, Sherlock decided it was time.
“I’ve got you down for March, three years from now.” Sherlock smiled in earnest as he held out his hand.
“Oh, er, hi,” Tony said, looking confused. He was, unfortunately, fully clothed, wearing jogging bottoms and a hoodie.
Sherlock had been functioning and reacting well enough that John was willing to take him home, but he was going to watch his symptoms closely. At the first sign of deterioration they were going straight to a hospital.
“No,” John said slowly, “I want you to explain why it’s in my bedroom.”
Sherlock may have been an Olympic champion at concealing emotions, but John was not. Open, helplessly readable John's every emotion moved across his face in a regular parade of thoughts and feelings. John was looking away but Sherlock saw the pain in his expression plainly.
Sherlock sat back in his chair and folded his arms. “Oh?” he asked, looking up at John through his fringe.
. What do
“Yeah, that’s right, I saw Shezza last night, innit. Oh, and then again, earlier today.”
Mrs. Bennis’s eyes were very large behind her glasses. “Does that really work?”
“To love is to be vulnerable. No one can hurt you if you don’t love.”
"And I need the other half! I went to school for
Sherlock felt the pressure of the water around his legs disappear. He could still hear the sound of rushing water but he didn’t open his eyes. He carried on kissing John. He kissed him like there was nowhere else he would choose to be, and nothing else he cared to do more.
He called Molly.
John stumbled, catching his heel on a raised grave marker and falling backward onto the grave.
John didn’t want to stay in tonight, but he had chosen to stay married to her. He could have left her back when everything had gone to hell. But he didn’t. And he was grudgingly aware that it wasn’t fair to have chosen the marriage and then to neglect it. He either had to divorce her or at least try to make an effort.
John remembered suddenly,
He felt Sherlock struggle briefly with something behind his back and then his hands were on him again, ungloved now, sliding through his hair, burning into the skin on the back of his neck, his face. Firm, gentle, the clever hands of a chemist.
He leaned up on his elbows and had just enough time to see Sherlock jump down from the fence onto the pavement. He went off down a side street, disappearing around the corner.
Sherlock fell backward into the grass on the cliff-side of the path and John landed on top of him, hands at his collar. Sherlock, having trained in boxing and judo, had extensive experience with hand-to-hand fighting and lighting fast reflexes. The second they hit the ground he rolled, flipping them over so that John lay on his back beneath him. John, however, had earned a reputation among his army regiment as the soldier to beat in the extracurricular wrestling matches. He was used to wrestling people taller than him, and instinctually he knew what to do.
“And you forgave him,” Mary pressed on. “Why can you forgive him, but not me?”
Mycroft had almost turned to leave when Sherlock shifted, raising his head and sitting up. Mycroft waited for him to speak, but he didn’t. Evidently unaware of Mycroft’s presence he leaned his weight onto John’s bed and, to Mycroft’s surprise, crawled onto it.
“Talk as though you already know something you haven’t found out yet.”
John walked over to his neglected phone on the kitchen table. Evidently it had been on silent.
The bedroom was about John's personal life. There were bookshelves full of his memories—stories he had told Sherlock and stories he hadn't, the ones Sherlock had deduced. A few photographs of his childhood dotted the shelves; not so many as to be cluttered, but the ones that stood out in his memory from the time—early on when John had first moved in— he'd stolen a photo album from a box of his things in an effort to obtain more information about his new flatmate.
When she continued her voice was more even. “It’s hard enough to find happiness in this hellscape,” she said, glaring out the window facing the main street behind him. “Don’t make yourself an obstacle in the way of yours. Life is too short.”
John made an effort not to laugh. Instead said sceptically, “So what I’m hearing is you need a maid. And possibly an accountant.”
Sherlock was thrilled the results of the experiment suggested John’s preference mirrored his own. He was a little concerned that his love for the German composers might influence the quality with which he played their songs, but he’d been careful from the start to play each piece with as much devotion as possible in order to maintain the integrity of the experiment.
“Actually, yes. If I put them anywhere else they’ll stay there for weeks.”
"Yeah, but—" Sherlock noticed a slight flush around his neck. "I just need to know the steps. I don't need to practice with a partner, do I?"
“It hasn’t been a week,” Sherlock mumbled.
Sherlock had his elbow propped against the car door and his fist in front of his mouth, thinking. He smiled around his glove.
Mrs. Hudson also seemed to be one of the better dancers on the floor. John supposed it wasn't entirely surprising, considering she
journals. The journals toppled into a pile of
John didn’t know how long they stood there like that in the doorway, but finally he pulled back, separating them just enough that he could see Sherlock’s face. The expression in the detective’s eyes made John’s words catch as he spoke them. “Thank you.”
"She says she hasn't been able to reach you."
Sherlock was standing in front of him looking a world apart from the ordinary. One of the beautiful people—his intelligence a palpable energy, the potential for danger woven through his genes.
She stood. “Get the hell out of here! I’m calling the police right now, you freaks!”
He sat down in the chair next to the bed. It didn’t look like sleeping. He was too still, too posed. Sleeping was more random. John lay on his side when he was sleeping. He shifted and moved when he was sleeping. But most importantly he always woke up from sleeping, whenever Sherlock touched his shoulder to wake him for a client or a case, eyes fluttering open, murmuring Sherlock’s name in the form of a question.
"Sorry I'm late," John said, walking up to where Sherlock was standing still. "Here, take this." He brusquely shoved a small brown paper sleeve into Sherlock's hand, not meeting his eyes.
The victim was young and in good shape. Maybe the poor sod had even tried to fight—coming home drunk from the bar, being held at knifepoint, just enough alcohol to convince him to play the hero… The story was fairly straightforward. In other words, not a situation in which he would normally text Sherlock.
Sherlock leapt up from the chair and was at the wall of photographs in a few strides. He pointed to the pictures as he said their names.
The girl was sitting in the hard wooden chair with one leg crossed over her knee, bouncing her foot up and down nervously as John walked into the living room. Sherlock was slouched in his chair, jaw resting on his fist, looking his usual amount of displeased about having anyone in the flat. The girl stood to shake John's hand.
He thought about Sherlock as he walked the half-mile back toward the car park. He wondered if Sherlock had returned from Switzerland yet, and tried to imagine his reaction upon finding the flat sparkling clean and himself missing. He’d be furious about the flat, of course, and it wouldn’t take him long to discover where John had gone. Being flatmates with the world’s only consulting detective meant little opportunity for secrecy.
Sherlock shut the glaring screen and allowed his eyes to adjust to the dark. He sat up straighter to see John’s bed.
“I take it you met Moran last night?” Sherlock watched John's posture relaxing as he realised they were not going to discuss the bedroom events of the previous night.
“Moran easily could have paid them to sit by a specific gravestone all night. I’m not paranoid. Paranoid people wear aluminium foil hats, and I have yet to do any such thing.”
Because the truth was, Sherlock had lied. And he had really hoped he’d never have to explain his actual reason for allowing John to think he was dead.
transcript in her typically flawless way.
Sherlock sighed. Goldfish level: “Where is your credit card?”
For John it was stating the obvious, but with Sherlock you could never be sure. He would do anything himself for a case.
“He’d better be the best shag in England at the price you’re paying for him!” Moriarty called out, flashing his teeth in a wicked grin before replacing the mouthpiece.
John hadn't lived with him since his 'suicide' and he kept forgetting. Why should he use valuable storage space in his mind palace for such disagreeable information? Agitated, he raked his hand through his hair.
“There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact.” John’s eyes flew open at the sound of Sherlock’s voice: deep silk answering his thoughts as though he’d spoken them out loud, reading his mind the way he always could.
Sherlock held his gaze. “I’m not a hero.”
Dark eyes regarded him curiously for a moment. Sherlock shifted his weight, leaning into him, and John could feel a brush of his curls against his cheek. Almond. The scent brought him back to the morning and the living room floor.
He typed furiously for a few moments and John went back to his armchair.
A slew of memories from the past week seeped from his subconscious to his conscious mind: John, leaning back against the wall on the street for support, lightheaded; John, stumbling out of his bed in the morning, off balance; John leaning against the building outside the strip club, dizzy; John standing up quickly after crouching in the cemetery, stumbling again, off balance; John, now, dizzy, almost falling backward…
"Oh, well," she blushed again, glancing at John, "yes, I—" was all she could say before Sherlock spoke again.
Sherlock moved to stand in front of John and took a step closer. He took John's left hand with his right.
“Remind me, Mary, why it is that what
John chuckled after she had slammed the door and they stopped back out on the street. “I’m just imagining the reaction the police are going to have when she rings up to say two people named Sherlock Holmes and John Watson were asking her weird questions.” John looked at Sherlock. “What?”
is insisting we do a waltz for the first dance."
He laughed, giddy from the excitement of the night. Going undercover to meet a prostitute, getting thrown out of a brothel—his nights with Sherlock... Well, he was never bored.
John drew in a breath, attempting to block his awareness of his surroundings like Sherlock did.
John tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hair and was rewarded by his lips parting in a small gasp. John took the opportunity and slid his tongue into his mouth. And
It was late in the afternoon on the third day of John's holiday when he was coming back along the cliffs, having finally slowed to a walk. The day was cool and clear and the sun, low in the sky, cast long shadows.
“What?”
“How do you know she isn’t?” John asked.
Sullivan grinned. “Fuck right we are.”
and the padlocks on his Feelings Closet snapped like twigs, the pain swirling in sickening torrents through his head. Fortunately there were chemical solutions to such problems, and this time Sherlock had no problem indulging in them.
was Baker Street, nothing to take John’s attention away from The Game, away from
“Fine,” Mary snarled at Sherlock, “but don’t think they’re going to let you stay after visiting hours. That’s for family only.”
John rested his hands on his hips. "You could have been nicer to her, considering she just cracked this case wide open for you."
Initially he was surprised that it was John Watson whom his brother deemed worthy of his affection when for twenty-seven years no one else had been. But after just a moment’s consideration he realised it wasn’t all that surprising. A soldier encompasses an interesting combination of obedience and willpower—an ideal personality for his brother, who would require a certain amount of submission to accept his domineering personality, but also a significant amount of backbone to win his respect. Factor in John’s addiction to danger, his bravery (or the right kind of stupidity), the speed at which he’d become fiercely protective of Sherlock (Mycroft had tested him), his cynical sense of humour, his patience and his loyalty, and he was in many ways the perfect companion for Sherlock. Even his shorter height and lower intelligence were necessary, due to Sherlock’s disdain for anyone taller than himself and his proven tendency to clash, sometimes violently, with people of equal or higher intelligence.
Sherlock followed, putting on an air of grave sincerity. “One never needs
“We are high,” Sherlock grinned. He walked to the table in the living room, opened his laptop and set about connecting his microscope to it. He switched on one of his chemical analysis devices. Sherlock had so much lab equipment at the flat; John was fairly sure most of it was stolen. Or at least permanently borrowed.
“Your partner is absolutely gorgeous,” Mrs. Bennis said, blinking at him over her tea.
time.” He remembered the text he’d sent to John that evening:
Sherlock dipped his hand down and John felt the weight of his gun being lifted from the back of his jeans. His eyes fell shut.
“It’s all gone,” he whispered. “Clean.”
John had taken to running along the cliffs each day on the virtually empty paths. He hadn’t run in a long time, but he was in better shape now, thanks to weekly training with the rugby team and the extra time spent at the gym avoiding Mary. Because of this, and because his army training had taught him to ignore physical fatigue, he’d been able to run five miles on his first day out.
“Relax,” Sherlock said evenly, “she’s going to help us.”
She stood up from the chair. “I’m leaving now, John. I’m glad you’re awake and feeling better.”
“I left to sort things out,” Sherlock said as John approached him.
The experiment was simple. John had to believe Sherlock was dead in requirement with the plan to defeat Moriarty. Sherlock would merely allow John to continue to think so. His hypothesis was that given enough time John would get over his infatuation with Sherlock’s work and crime-fighting lifestyle in favour of settling down to a quieter life. Because didn't Sherlock believe the worst about people, and didn't he like to push them toward it? Don’t we all do our best to fulfil our own pessimistic prophesies?
He was sitting in his chair, idly flipping his phone around in his hand. Apart from the increasing number of dizzy spells he wasn’t experiencing any debilitating symptoms yet. He had worked the past two days at the surgery as though nothing was wrong. He didn’t see why not; when the poison triggered the shock-inducing reaction it would happen suddenly. There was nothing preventing him from functioning normally until that time, and god only knew he wasn’t going to spend the days sitting in an empty flat waiting to keel over.
that poncey git.
John handed the phone back to her. He wanted to tell her she was right, that she'd done well, but he knew without question to follow Sherlock's lead. The detective sat silently gazing at her over the tips of his fingers.
“Why did you do that?” John demanded.
Sherlock did not want to talk about the previous night. He did not want to explain why he’d asked John to stay in his room. He did not want to have to talk to John about finding a new flat. Because he’d thought about it all day, in the back of his mind, and the unavoidable conclusion was that Moriarty was right.
“You do
he jabbed his finger at the screen. Molly didn’t move. “
John nodded grimly to show Mycroft he understood.
John crossed his arms, instantly on the defensive. “You nearly died last night; I wasn’t going to leave you here alone.”
It had been the wrong time to take a sip of his coffee. John choked. “Jesus Christ, Harry!”
Pause.
“What the hell was
“So all the girls working at Monroe’s are using this drugged lip gloss?”
Sherlock sat cross-legged on top of a bookcase in the library of his mind palace. He looked down dismally at the water flowing past the top shelf. The books in his library were mostly waterproof; they had experienced ‘feelings flooding’ before, but never to this extent. He couldn’t know there wouldn’t be any lasting damage.
the detective. Losing friends hurt, John knew that, he’d lost friends in the war, sometimes it hurt irreparably but this wasn’t like that.
Using Mycroft’s money, knowingly attracting his brother’s attention, forced him to acknowledge how desperate he was. He needed the chemicals he’d just purchased. Without drugs and without anything else to distract his attention, research was all he had to keep his brain from self-destructing with boredom.
“Don’t you want to check the grass for wires? Every gravestone could have a hidden camera.”
This wasn’t working. He needed John’s responses to centre his thought processes. And for some inconvenient reason, only John’s. All other voices were grating to his ears: either too high or too loud or too nasally or too fast or too slow or too mumbling or too stupid. Vile people and their witless cadences, ugly and full of the ignorant sort of arrogance people effuse whenever they speak about things they don’t understand, which is always. But not John.
He was laughing so genuinely that John couldn’t help laughing too.
“Excellent deduction. I would congratulate you on solving the case, except I’d say you lose rather a lot of points for not noticing there was a case in the first place.”
“Would it make you happy if I tried to take better care of them?”
“Then listen,” Sherlock hissed, gripping John’s shoulders hard enough that the bark of the tree dug into his back. “I couldn’t do it before. My mind hasn’t been set up for anything like—” Sherlock’s gaze wavered from where it had been boring through to the back of John’s head. “I needed to… rearrange. I can do it now.”
Sherlock was more than a little irritated by the time he heard John’s footsteps on the stairs signalling his return from work. Mrs. Hudson had been buzzing around their flat all day like an annoying and silly bee. Tidying, cooking, making tea, fussing over his neck injury, sitting, talking, incessantly talking, and absolutely refusing to go away.
to do it that way, so the idea shouldn’t be too foreign to get used to.”
Could that mean—did it mean—It must, mustn’t it? Sherlock had lay down in his bed, held him. Even for someone as enigmatic as a consulting detective, a gesture like that couldn’t be ambiguous.
“I changed my mind,” John said, walking further into the room, stopping just short of where Sherlock was standing.
“Well, you went to the trouble to infiltrate a terrorist organisation for her. I wouldn’t think meeting her for coffee would be right out. Or, you know… dinner…”
Sherlock took out his phone and snapped a picture.
“But most importantly,” Sherlock was saying, “Moran also owns a funeral home.”
Sherlock straightened up and leaned back. John rested his knee on the edge of the couch and braced himself on the back of it. He looked closely at the scar. The surgeons had done a good job; the ring where the bullet entered his chest had healed as nicely as one can hope a bullet wound to heal. Very unlike his own, which had been done rushed at a field surgery, leaving a jagged, uneven gash on his shoulder.
“Did you use it today?”
And as far as he could deduce (which was regularly even further than Sherlock), his brother never loved anything or anyone again.
John stopped dead.
“And what do you make of that?” John asked, the perplexity in his voice indicating he was unable to make anything of it himself.
“Remember I mentioned a while ago I was thinking of changing the blog’s title? How about
John was startled to find Sherlock standing at his side. It was a strange experience to look down at that head of curls. The child took hold of his left hand.
Sherlock hung his head. If he thought poetry was a fate worse than death, then a poetic death must be unthinkable. His thoughts were clouding. He was losing clarity. It was with considerable effort that he raised his head up again.
“You spend ninety-percent of your time deceiving people.”
The sun was setting by the time he’d found enough cheques to assume there might be only one or two still missing. Considering he’d turned the place upside down looking, he was satisfied with his results. He’d found multiple cheques being used as bookmarks, some among the piles of newspapers, two between the couch cushions, one under the rug, one in the spice cabinet, and one stuck beneath a bag of fingers in the crisper in the fridge. The amount written on the cheque from the spice cabinet made John’s eyebrows shoot up under his hair. Sherlock must have put it in the cabinet for safekeeping. With the parsley and thyme. John shook his head. Sherlock was absolutely hopeless.
Second, he knew he wouldn’t be able to devote the time and
Mrs. Bennis must have noticed his discomfort because she quickly added, “Oh no, I didn’t mean any slight against you. Of course you’re a very handsome man yourself, but I can just tell..." Her focus softened as she gazed off toward the dining room again. “A man like that is difficult. Complicated. You’ll have to fight for him. But he’s worth it.” She looked back at John and gave him a knowing smile. “Men like that always are.”
Sherlock lifted one of the chairs and tested its weight in his arm. John watched him warily as he walked around in front of him. “What are you doing? Sher—”
God, if she’d just shot Sherlock directly in the heart none of this would be happening
He checked his phone: nothing from John. Sherlock hadn’t sent him a message either. There was nothing he could say. At least not until he solved the problem. There had to be a way he could have what he wanted—give John what he wanted—without compromising his mind palace. Why did desire have to be such massive mental real estate? How could he find space for it when his brain was already filled to critical levels with essential information?
Adrenaline surged through him with the pounding of his heart. He felt the flex and tension of his muscles like a blessing as he ran. His body had been aching to work off his frustration through the torturously long days spent recovering. His medical knowledge of convalescence told him that a rugby match was probably not the best move so soon after recovering, but his medical knowledge could be damned for now. He had aggravation wound through him tightly enough to make his head spin and he needed physical action to break it.
“What language?”
How could he not have known? How could he have been so blind not to see what even strangers seemed to pick up in a glance? He’d been stupid, so stupid—
"Mrs. Hudson, what are you—?" John started.
Sitting. Sitting and drinking from the sound of it. They could be here a while, and John was not keen on staring at the weird skeleton skull hovering just inches from his face. He started to pull off his own mask and when Sherlock didn’t stop him he assumed it was ok. Then he took hold of the fabric at Sherlock’s neck and pulled it up, gently pushing it back off of the detective’s face.
Lestrade followed John as he moved to stand next to Sherlock.
“I—” her voice cracked and she cleared her throat. “H-how’s John today?”
“Fancy yourself a hero, Mr. Holmes?” Moran asked.
“They used her real name? That’s a bit ballsy isn’t it?”
“Yeah,” he heard Tony saying. “It’s from the last series; I’m not caught up yet…”
Briefly he wondered which would be crueller for his brother, if John died or if John woke up. Because if John woke up they would have to fall back into pretending, if either man wanted to maintain any shred of his self-constructed identity: John as staunchly heterosexual and Sherlock as superior to love and contemptuous of all forms of affection. Looking at Sherlock curled over John’s body Mycroft sincerely doubted that any such pretence would remain a possibility if John woke up. And what then? Would his haughty brother really condescend to a physical relationship? Or having shattered that delicate friendship—the love they shared so precariously balanced between platonic and not—would they have to say goodbye, knowing self-deception would no longer be an option?
When Sherlock emerged a while later, the DI was deeply immersed in some late-late-night talk show he found on the telly.
“Okay,” he agreed quietly, then, before he could talk himself out of it. Truth was, he craved the comfort of a pull-up tonight, knowing that even though
The single best damn thing in his life- when was the last time they had shared a bed or a kiss or even more than a minute of intimacy? When was the last time they had played?
God, how he
Sherlock held up his hands in a form of peace offering, failing to keep the small grin off his face.
Sherlock usually didn’t call in favors from Mycroft. At least, not favors in the general sense; there was usually a payback of one form or another involved; some case Sherlock usually was too proud to take, or some tiring leg-work.
for you,” John continued unfazed, “but they taste like they are
“It’s about nothing, if you would just leave me the fuck alone, I don’t need you coming back here acting all nice-”
‘But I have to go now, darling.’ John’s mood faltered a little in disappointment. They barley started texting!
He had dignity.
“Good boy,” warmth spread through John’s entire body at the praise, and he couldn’t remember the last time he accepted compliments so easily and allowed himself to bathe in them; when he wasn’t immediately chiding himself for enjoying being the center of somebody’s attention. It seems so selfish when he’s not…
ignore John, even if he went into his mind-palace, his consciousness was too alert; he didn’t manage to be fully absorbed in it.
They’d be fine in no time. And then, they still had the whole day ahead of them to do whatever fun activities John’s heart desired.
But it was a theory, nothing more, an abundance of hypothesizes formed in the safety of his own mind,
But Sherlock felt like they were well on their way.
Back to the matter at hand.
He regretted not bringing his phone with him. Just to send Sherlock a quick text that he was okay.
He walked over to the coffee table and made a big show of inspecting the books (and had to admit, the designs had improved quite a bit since the last time he had bought coloring books for his girls, decades ago).
Sherlock looked up, ready to crook an eyebrow at this strange question (John had made it very clear around four months into their time as flat mates, that we wasn’t interested whatsoever in all the different things Sherlock filed away in his mind palace), but stopped when he saw a little something sparkle in John’s eyes. He recognized it instantly from the night they never talked about and
It was like a very heavy animal- maybe an elephant- had sat down on his chest, constricting his breathing, elevating his pulse. He became light-headed and nauseous from the shock of it. There was a roaring in his ears and a burning in his eyes. For several minutes, he was so overwhelmed with the situation that he could do nothing more than sit in and stare at his own mess.
The tense silence only lasted a couple more seconds, before John’s resolve finally broke. The shift was indicated in his face first, for it crumbled ever so slightly, and then in his posture, for he scrambled in a sitting position and opened in his arms in a- what could only be described as adorable- demand for a hug.
That would be absolutely dreadful, because he came completely unprepared about the proper ways to argue with a loved one. He could be hurtful and cold, and he didn’t want to be that towards John, not ever again.
“You won’t. And you’ll get answers, I promise.”
It would do wonders for the chill and John’s sore muscles, too (not to speak about the soreness of his skin where the wet pull-up had set for an uncomfortably long time (another thing Sherlock tried not to feel too guilty about))...
By the thought of reading, his heart made a happy leap, as he mounted the cab that would take him from Scotland Yard back home. In a heat of the moment decision, he asked the driver to drop him off at a Waterstones not too far from Baker Street, where he acquired a book of short stories, figuring John might enjoy a bit of fiction for a change, instead of the scientific articles.
“I can do it,” he tried to protest weakly, but didn’t make a move to actually remove anything himself.
“Let me see,” he urged, already pulling the hand underneath the cold water-spray from the faucet. John let himself be manhandled, although somehow reluctantly.
“I love you, too. More than I can say.”
Long after all the dishes had been put away, Greg was simply standing in the doorway to the living room, watching the phone conversation. John was talking animatedly- more animatedly than he had ever heard him talk (while being sober)- with his teddy resting on his stomach and his legs stretched out, bare feet swaying in a carefree manner. Everything about John was carefree and at ease in that very moment. Greg still remembered how often he had found his friend on that very same couch crumbled in on himself, muttering about still making two cups of tea, despite the fact that Sherlock was gone forever.
Another shake of the head, this time punctuated with an almost inaudible groan. In an attempt to soothe his distressed partner, Sherlock started to caress over his back; beginning at the top of his neck in even, long strokes down to his flanks and back up again.
However, John was wearing a pull-up right now. Sherlock had never seen him in only a pull-up. After all, today was the second instance that Sherlock saw him while he was wearing a pull-up at all.
A large hand ruffled his already disheveled bed-hair.
John needed this. Sherlock could see it written all over his face. So, he would give it to him. He wasn’t the caring type, but he cared for John; he cared for John
Sherlock glanced at Greg’s face briefly.
And John looked at him like he’d see the whole world in Sherlock’s eyes and he
“Charming.”
“Wanna watch a movie? Maybe have some snacks?” He figured they would not need a big lunch because of the late breakfast; some snacks and an early dinner would do just fine (and Sherlock specifically told him that he didn’t care how, as long as John remained well-fed).
, a pull-up that was still wet and soggy and which had irritated his skin.
“Greg, this is…”
But it didn’t matter.
him. Because being an adult apparently was too much of a struggle these days. How,
This was supposed to be a relaxing and healing experience for John, after all.
that he threw away all the hesitation he learned to introduce in their interactions after John came back home.
“Doesn’t feel right.”
He was fairly sure that he could have managed in half the time, if he hadn’t been so distracted. But he was.
“The…uh… the red ones?”
“Hold on, Sherlock. That’s- Christ, what’s going on?”
But life worked in mysterious ways.
Another half-hour later, he dismissed the silly notion. He wasn’t a child or anything. And Sherlock was smart. He probably figured it out right away, probably even texted Greg to verify his assumption. Sherlock was fine.
he was talking to; the organic end of a conversation obviously didn’t exist in his world.
Greg still frowned when he dialed the number, unable to deny his friend his wish; and not really fully understanding why he did it in the first place. Something about the soft tone in John’s voice…
The way John held his posture switched all the other pieces into place. Sherlock had John only once seen bending his hips in such a peculiar angle. The night when he had worn a pull-up for bed.
His vision was still blurred, but once he could make out the ‘Sh’ he already knew who called him. Of course. Who else?
Please comment and leave kudos and bookmarks however your heart desires. I'm excited to hear your feedback <3 Take care, y'all!!! :3
Maybe he should just go home.
He closed his eyes.
“But, it’s a forty minutes’ drive,” Greg told himself quietly, while scrubbing his hand over his face. It wasn’t the first night he lost sleep over Sherlock Holmes and John Watson, and he’d be damned if it would be the last.
“Can we text Daddy?”
He couldn’t, he couldn’t even remember (but he remembered, almost violently, how absolutely undone John had been the night they had entered their new dynamic; how on edge John had been after ten days with the bare minimum of affection. To think about how he must be feeling now, after
He has a complicated relationship with sleep.
, because I’m me and I’m-“ here he paused and closed his eyes, as if preparing for a slap in the face- “Terrified. Absolutely terrified. What if I ruin this, like I’ve ruined everything else? What if he gets tired of forgiving me?”
It had started out good. Great, actually. After the morning at Greg’s, Sherlock and John discussed some rules and boundaries for their age-play dynamic- a conversation, which John left feeling very reassured and understood by his partner. He had stayed little the whole day before that and felt refreshed in a way he hadn’t in a long time. The desire to be little subsided the following week, with having busy but gratifying work days and lovely date-nights with Sherlock, who poured all his attention onto their relationship, because of the total lack of cases.
“Did you have a nightmare?”
John played with his fingers, at a loss for better things to say. His stomach was in knots and his arms and legs felt tingly, and it was like his head itched for something. John wasn’t quite ready to admit to himself what it was.
“What I need is therapy,” he mumbled. “Fine,” the doctor told the wall, after another second of silence. He shifted self-consciously, twitching violently in shame when the movement caused a quiet wet sound.
What often was perceived as a hot-headed tempter masked a deep anxiety to please, a frustration of not meeting a certain set of expectations, a perfectionist in a complex emotional sense.
The fur against his cheeks grew damp.
needed it right now.
Suddenly, Sherlock’s face was right in front of him, brows knitted together in worry. He was holding a selection out of their impressive collection of rubber ducks (which had started as a joke present from Greg and emerged in a small obsession on John’s part), and despite of being more embarrassed than he had could ever remember being in his entire life, a small spark of excitement welled up in John’s stomach. Bubbles
Well.
He was more than willing to give what he thought John desired- he found it sweet in that wholesome kind of way that warmed you from the inside and out (something, he had been completely unfamiliar with before he had met John all those years ago)- but he wasn’t sure if it was his place to offer. On the other hand, he had initiated the reading sessions, and that was working fairly well.
Right after he spoke, Sherlock closed his mouth and counted to ten, silently begging whatever deity was available to not have added fuel to the flames.
- feeling inside of him made his heart grow and he couldn’t remember the last time somebody had said those words to him, it must have been when he was still a child. A shudder washed over his whole body as he closed his eyes and allowed this bubbly feeling to finally pull him under.
The movement stopped abruptly, which was, somehow, even more worrying.  It indicated that John had been jostled awake by whatever memory and/or nightmare was plaguing him. Sherlock listened for the tell-tale signs of John’s after-nightmare-routine, the one he was still familiar from the days where his friends’ PTSD had been a much bigger problem than it was now. At least, had been. John had been doing better. Now, he was doing worse.
He had been strong, once. A soldier. A
Sherlock felt John exhale long and slow against his skin. “I don’t want Greg to worry. He’s my friend.”
It was a silly little thing.
, you call me immediately.“ Although Sherlock was now holding onto John’s shoulders, his gaze bore into Greg imploringly, screaming ‘I’m trusting you with my precious baby, don’t fuck this up!’.
He blew a quiet breath to calm his own nerves down a bit. The situation was undoubtedly strange and uncomfortable, but only because they were kind of stiff around each other. Although they had been friends for years, it was like slowly getting to know each other all over again.
When they turned from flat mates/work partner/ friends to boyfriends and lovers, Sherlock had predicted a major crisis in one way or another. John- being so concerned with his impression on others- had clung to his heterosexuality as a form of independence from Sherlock, since they had been glued to the hip (him seen as Sherlock’s inferior side-kick) from the very first day. When it didn’t come in the privacy of their living quarters, Sherlock suspected it would occur upon their first public outing as a romantic couple, on the day Lestrade had remarked that they were much cozier than usual. Sherlock had readied himself for solid denial or at least some token embarrassment; but John had just pulled him in by the waist and declared that they “might as well make it official right away.”
“Ah! Now see, here it says: ‘Of all the invertebrates—animals that lack a backbone—octopuses are the ones that seem the most like us. In part, it’s the way they return your gaze, as if they’re scrutinizing you. In part, it’s their dexterity. Their eight arms are lined with hundreds of suckers; this allows them to manipulate objects, whether it’s to open clamshells, dismantle the filtration system of an aquarium tank, or unscrew lids from jars.’ Fascinating.”
Scratch that, too.
In all honesty, he had no idea whatsoever about age-play or littles, as Sherlock had called these things. But he knew John well, and he treasured John’s friendship; he couldn’t imagine not getting along with this side of his friend, as well. He was a bit worried that the statement might have come off as derogatory or as if he was forcing himself into something that was so distinctively theirs. But, yeah. He was a bit curious. What could he say, it was in his nature.
Greg stood up and let his joints pop. Sherlock, however, remained rooted to the spot; seemingly anxious to say something else. Greg waited patiently. It wasn’t like he was in any hurry, at this point.
As if suddenly remembering that this was a ‘weird’ situation, John looked away and blushed bright red. Baby steps, Greg reminded himself.
“You don’t have to,” Sherlock interjected while the lump in his throat grew, but John barely noticed him over his own hitching breaths.
In short, no crisis at all; and Sherlock was a tiny bit disappointed by that. Only because it meant that he had been wrong, obviously.
different. The intimate connection between them was distorted; it was still
However, there was a tension in tonight’s silence that made him uneasy and anxious, so he ignored the possibility of rejection and the increase of awkwardness that would be the outcome of this possibility and headed upstairs.
It was just so familiar and domestic- Sherlock still remembered this version of Lestrade from the days when he suffered through endless weeks of drug withdrawal on the officer’s couch. Gregory Lestrade had been his only friend in the world during his troubled youth. In a way, he owed everything he had to the inspector and his stubborn insistence on not giving up on a young, but severely addicted genius- claiming that he saw that Sherlock was capable to great things if he got his life on track. He had been right.
Eventually, he got up and stalked around the room, for lack of better things to do, and eventually got himself a coffee and some pain killers, just so he would feel occupied with something remotely useful (and not feel like he was left on hold in his own fucking flat).
It was unusual for Sherlock to call.
The divorce was through, the ex-wife was nowhere to be seen, and John was back at Baker Street.
or at least had a strong suspicion, but still. It was different actively telling him from passively accepting that Mycroft was aware of every detail of his life.
Deciding that maybe actions would be favored to words, he bowed down a bit, to place a kiss against his partner’s temple, but John jerked his head away.
Not even fifteen minute later (Heaven knows how Mycroft pulled that off), they were bundled up in one of the black fancy government cars with the tinted windows.
Either way, it meant trouble for Greg, so the DI felt a small thrill run up his spine when he pressed the phone clumsily against his ear.
With slow, deliberate movements (as if not to startle John out of the haze that seemed to have fallen over both of them), the detective reached for his bag and fished for the pull-up without breaking eye-contact with John. His little doctor became slightly droopy-eyed and Sherlock watched with bemusement how his thumb gravitated near his lips (another thing, Sherlock observed John seemed to desire when he was little but hadn’t allowed himself to indulge so far).
“Go ahead,” Sherlock encouraged affectionately. “It’s all yours.”
“John, tell Daddy what’s wrong.”
“Tonight, and whenever you want to.”
It was infuriating.
John meanwhile was becoming a little restless.
The teddy’s fur had the rich color of honey and was soft to the touch, completed with big paws and round button eyes. It was resting atop of some grocery bags (every now and again, Sherlock did the shopping now, another thing John would have never thought possible) in a slightly crooked angle. Without much thought, John made a bee-line to pick it up. He was smiling like an idiot but allowed himself the spark of excitement that bubbled in his veins upon seeing the toy.
“They are
, someone as brilliant and strong as Sherlock put up with him- he didn’t know. He was old and broken and a fucking child- a child that was pissing itself after a nightmare, a child that wanted cuddles and its Daddy’s attention.
The evening had started out so well. He actually had been pretty damn proud of himself. Ella had encouraged him to see his little side as a part of his character, and not as a completely different persona. He came home from the surgery, hearing Sherlock arguing on the phone (with Mycroft, if the level of annoyance in his partner’s voice was anything to go by), when he saw something he knew immediately was meant as a present for little John.
John Watson so broken and vulnerable took him by surprise in the worst kind of ways. He knew that John wasn’t alright. He didn’t know John was so poorly.
“And not broken, like me,” he added quieter, his eyes focusing on his fingers, which he clenched and unclenched anxiously.
The buy made him embarrassingly confident, he was eager to prove that he was a thoughtful partner after all (Insecurity, another concept he hadn’t been familiar with until John hobbled into his life).
This, however, would be a bitter pill to swallow.
Reassurance. Worked every time.
; enjoyed the way his head got a little bit fuzzy, and how Sherlock showered him in attention, and how he could call Sherlock….
They hadn’t been fighting since they started dating. Sherlock wondered vaguely if John wanted to initiate a fight with his actions.
Alright. At least John wasn’t doubting the sincerity of their relationship, which was good, but all things considered, had been the smaller problem to begin with (Deep down, Sherlock knew, John never really doubted them. He just needed a reminder).
And made Greg take notes, like he was some absolute idiot, who couldn’t hold onto the most basic facts. All things considered, that was probably how he appeared to Mr. Genius, the DI mused as Sherlock waltzed to the door.
“John? I’ll finish here. Get some sleep.”
“Be good for Daddy, yes?” He asked softly; in the most tender voice Greg had ever heard him use. It was dramatic, but so genuine that Greg felt a little pull in his stomach. He was getting sappy in his old age.
The detective eyed his partner calculating, but John turned away, denying Sherlock the possibility to deduce him. His palms were sweaty and itching and he felt light-headed, but not the good kind. He gripped the kitchen table for support, making the wood creak underneath his fingertips.
had been confirmed- and maybe he’d been fantasizing things, maybe it had been wishful thinking, maybe he longed for this something to be what he thought it was, maybe he was just imposing this thoughts upon his partner.
‘Oh no, you don’t,’ Greg thought to himself, before he interrupted Sherlock (something that the younger man
He wouldn’t be able to tell Greg
“Right, I forgot, you know everything about everybody and you never, ever, shut up about it!”
They never did… a bath before. Or a shower, for that matter. Or… anything involving water and soap, really.
“Nonsense,” he replied, lifting his partner’s chin so he had to look him right in the eyes. “You’re not broken. You’re
The skin peeking out from the jacket sleeve was dry and ashen, so John hadn’t been sleeping well, either. The more signs of obvious self-neglect Sherlock discovered, the more worried he became.
They played well into the afternoon, enthralled by the games’ charm and each other’s friendly company. The relentless pitter-patter of rain and the smell of pancakes still lingering in the air created a cozy atmosphere. Greg mentally congratulated himself on a job well done (so far). As expected, he and John got along well no matter if big or little and Greg had to admit himself that he was having a lot of fun hanging out with his little buddy (and secretly already hoped that he’d get the chance to interact with little John more often from now on).
“Okay.”
He wasn’t uncomfortable around Sherlock, not anymore at least. Sherlock knew every part of his body (quite intimately; the mere notion made him blush in his current fragile mind-set). They had been naked around each other enough, it would really be kind of silly to be shy around him.
Sherlock didn’t give John one more chance to get another self-depriving adjective out. Watching his man- this strong, wonderful man- verbally destroy himself over mistakes that weren’t even his was much more than Sherlock could take. And God help him, he could take a lot.
But he shouldn’t. He was a grown man. And, worse yet, what if it happened
Sherlock held onto it like it was the only thing that could make this situation better (it was, probably); he let John hug his mid-section and cradled his head securely.
Right.
He bit his lip and willed himself to not slip, although he had been on the verge of slipping for hours now.
Not as long as John would remain right here, in his arms. In his life. In his heart.
Sherlock’s heart
for him, so he could have a companion in overcoming the trauma of the last months.
Ella had explained to him that regular play-session would work wonders for his stress levels, anxiety, and PTSD-fallouts.
When they closed the door behind them twenty minutes later, Sherlock immediately phoned the pizza place, giving John no time to backtrack the shy confirmation he had given about their dinner plans.
The two ‘adults’ at the table engaged in some playful banter that kept John entertained for the remainder of breakfast; their silliness helped him to concentrate on happy stuff instead of dwelling on heavy topics.
, as Sherlock had phrased it.
“Sherlock, I’m feeling so strange right now,” John whined, low against his partner’s neck.
John dismissed this thought immediately) but that wasn’t really the point. Sherlock had a hard time being nice to people. Sherlock had a hard time caring for people. And he had been wonderful to John the past weeks, especially as his… (John sucked in a sharp breath that didn’t go unnoticed by Greg)…
John surprised Sherlock by shaking his head violently, rubbing his face almost painfully against Sherlock’s collarbone.
He took in the form of his partner silently, letting his eyes roam over the tense shoulders, and the back that was turned on him, the heaving chest, the color of these well-hidden cheeks, the fight and vulnerability on his face, the dark circles under his eyes. John looked utterly exhausted. John looked like he needed… comfort.
So, it seemed like he had to jump into another of these delicate moments unprepared and head first.
. Then again, John Watson had always known how to push his buttons. How to touch his heart. How to make him
He would sort the clutter in his mind later on.
Later, though.
“Don’t.”
Part of him wanted to yell at Sherlock to get the fuck out, that he was invading his privacy; that this was way too intimate and that he didn’t want to share it with
“Language,” Greg chided him, which made John blush hotly. Big him was swearing with Greg
While nightmares had always left John nervous and agitated, they had never caused him to cry before. Sherlock could count the occasions he had seen his friend cry on one hand; the ones where John was actually aware Sherlock watched him were even fewer. It was an emotional display that was so unusual for the doctor, that it made the detective uneasy for the split of a second.
Sherlock felt slightly sick with nerves.
“Can we still get tiramisu?”
Greg tore his eyes away from the door to watch John instead; John, whose posture was tense and who fidget with the big wooden button of an oversized wooly cardigan, which Greg had never seen him wear before. Now that he payed attention to it, none of the clothes were ones which he had seen John wear before, hence they must be what Sherlock had dubbed John’s “little clothes”. Somehow, Greg would have imagined them to be more child-like, but it made sense that they were just a slightly different version of what John normally wore. Anyhow, the rich royal blue of the wool made John’s eyes pop and the artsy elephant print with lots of colorful patterns of the graphic tee made him look younger than Greg had ever seen him. It was a good look on him- but Greg bargained it would look even better if John was as comfortable as his clothes looked.
There was no dinner ready.
“Shall we get started on dinner, hm?” Greg’s breath was warm against his hairline and was so pleasant that John started to smile like an idiot. Now that he started to think about his chosen family, he couldn’t stop and the happiness bubbling inside of him started to show all over his face. It was surreal, going from sadness to happiness so quickly, but he had accepted it as part of his little headspace. He tented to feel things much faster and much more intense.
Almost immediately, he blushed a deep shade of red.
There was no way the evening would turn around to… that. Sherlock was probably angry. He surely wouldn’t want to… after John had a tantrum over...pull-ups. A silly, childish tantrum.
he lost control, it wouldn’t matter as much.
Sherlock closed his eyes and smirked slightly, allowing himself another minute or two of just enjoying this moment, before all the guilt he had pushed back yesterday would hit him again with full force. For the moment, he could talk himself into believing everything was fine and that there was absolutely not a huge amount of justified self-loathing coming his way with the speed of a freight train.
John watched understanding cross his friend’s face and wished that the ground would just swallow him whole. It would be easy for Sherlock to mock him in this position. It would be easy to be spiteful and mean.
The detective would give everything in the world to help John through these difficult times, he longed for the chance to offer the comfort he knew his friend graved. Because Sherlock had changed during his time in Serbia; above all things his heart grew much more open and accepting, he was ready to drop the ‘sociopath’-charade to allow himself the feelings for those closest to him, the feelings for
“Yeah….” John began to trace the pattern on Greg’s sleeve with his finger. “But, like, you’re
The doctor, despite the mood he had worked himself into, must have realized that, too, for the first time since Sherlock entered 221 B Baker Street, he looked at him, just for fraction of a second.
John wondered if he was underdressed in his jeans and shirt, but a glance around revealed other men in the same attire. However, Sherlock, with a dark purple designer shirt visible beneath suit jacket, was (for once) not overdressed either. There were a considerable number of men in suits as well—straight from the office to the bar on a Friday night.
“We need to know who owns the club. If this place is what I think it is the person on the books won't be the real owner.”
"Hullo!" John had slurred upon their arrival. "This is Nathan," he gestured at the equally intoxicated young man sitting next to him. "Nathan, these are my…" He broke off laughing.
It was an unpleasant but necessary lesson. And a few months later, Mycroft was rewarded with evidence that his clever brother had internalised it. Their parents asked Sherlock whether he’d like a new puppy and Sherlock shook his head with some vehemence declaring that pets were useless and stupid.
He’d never had to worry about John inhibiting his ability to work, annoying him the way everyone else always did. It had never been like that with John. John was different. He alone enhanced Sherlock’s thought process instead of deterring it; he made him better. And now it would be the same with his mind palace. He wouldn’t shut his feelings for John out; they would transform the space; they would improve it. The silent falling water had a calming effect that would help Sherlock concentrate. It would make him better than ever. The way John had.
“Tony Bauer,” Sherlock clarified. “Are you aware that all of them, except Mr. Bauer, have died very recently? They were poisoned.”
When Sherlock calculated her to be on the top stair he stopped his bow and yelled, “MRS. HUDSON, IF YOU TRY TO BRING ONE MORE CUP OF TEA IN HERE TONIGHT I WILL THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW.” The footsteps stopped, hesitating. "I’LL CONSIDER THROWING YOU OUT AFTER IT,” he added for good measure.
“It’s true,” Sherlock said when they were facing each other, “you are a bit mad.”
She turned around and bent over, fingers grazing the floor. “One night, two weeks ago, she didn’t come home.” She raised herself slowly. “She always comes home. I haven’t seen her since.”
“That’s true.” John said, smiling. He turned his head to look at a point across the car park that Sherlock couldn’t see.
"I told Mrs. Avery you might be kind enough to accompany her for a dance," his lying, conniving landlady beamed.
Sherlock grabbed John’s arms. “Are you hurt?” he asked, eyes running fast over John’s body. He’d heard the second shot as well. “Your arm,” he murmured, whipping off his glove to gingerly twist John’s upper left arm.
John sniggered at his own terrible jokes and when he turned his head sideways he could see Sherlock smiling as well. Maybe the joke wasn't that bad. Maybe the drug was that good.
It was the angle that was the problem.
Afterward he watched Sherlock trying to pretend it wasn’t true. And John being oblivious—relying too heavily on his previous heterosexual history to see things as they really were. There was a point when Mycroft thought perhaps the two of them had found such an unlikely balance that they could remain in limbo forever. But then Sherlock had decided not to tell John he was alive after he died and John got married and Mycroft was forced to remind Sherlock that he had, indeed, told him not to get involved.
“Think, Sherlock.
When Sherlock returned to London after his ‘suicide,’ the first thing he noticed was John’s ridiculous moustache. The second thing he noticed was that John was tired. Purple under his eyes like bruises. Nightmares or insomnia? Either way he estimated the cause was withdrawal. By being unable to work with Sherlock, John had been deprived of regular exposure to danger. Cold turkey. Memories of the war creeping back without better threats to replace them.
"You don't, erm, want me to come with you?"
of all people. She had been the one with the gun; the one in control. She didn’t have to shoot him. There was no one forcing her. There was no good reason— But she did, he circled the scar with his finger, she did.
?” No one told her anything. Really. Nothing.
, he reminded himself sternly.
But how serious was the separation? The presence of two suitcases—overstuffed, which contrasted with Sherlock’s knowledge of John to be a light packer—negated any impulsive, storm-out scenario. Time and effort had been spent packing. Sherlock didn’t need to open the bags to know they’d been packed with military fastidiousness: shirts folded crisply and pants rolled tightly to maximise space. John clearly meant to avoid having to go back to Mary’s for as long as possible. Very serious.
"John, don't marry her."
John opened the door and took an involuntary step backward when he saw his ex-flatmate on the steps, a taxi idling behind him on the street. John hadn’t seen him in weeks; if he’d forgotten even a bit how arresting was the appearance of Sherlock Holmes, he was duly reminded now. The consulting detective was sharply dressed in an exquisite tux, thick black curls styled to perfection, standing on the doorstep with his hands in his pockets.
“If you and Mr. Bradley will just follow me for your appointment.”
Orders from a doctor were one thing. Orders from an army doctor, in uniform, were quite another.
their father’s funeral, let alone help organise it.
But now Sherlock was in John’s hospital room. He was alone in John’s hospital room and he had called Mycroft for help.
“You pulled your punch too,” John pointed out. The spot on his cheek didn’t hurt nearly as much as it should considering Sherlock’s skill in fighting.
Mycroft glared at him. “As I was saying, when Mary came to pick him up she was absolutely furious with you, and John was none too pleased either. Nine days being poisoned by a bullet he took for you, and you didn’t notice? I can’t say I blame him.”
"Nothing."
Sherlock had slept for more than twenty-four hours when he finally opened his eyes again.
“Stop it!” Molly shouted, regaining her wits.
John didn’t bother wondering why Mycroft hadn’t asked for the reason he wanted to know. With Mycroft it was always safe to assume he already knew.
“Find what you wanted?” John asked as Sherlock took off his coat.
“What did you take?” There was a sharpness in his voice that seemed to get Sherlock’s unfocused gaze to clear momentarily.
John raised his eyebrows at Sherlock. “Well I wouldn’t know. I wasn’t there when she said it.”
but it would be insufferably boring.”
But what did his sexual history, or lack thereof, have to do with any of it? Why had his mind fixated on it in the midst of a (hypothetical) case?
John shrugged. “It’s a design flaw.”
“YOUR HYPOTHESIS?” The rising wind ripped the words from John’s mouth.
“You’re a self-satisfied moron, Boss,” Sherlock said.
"Sit," Sherlock said.
He wished he could open John’s head—precise incisions, careful parting of the skull, delicate handling of the soft brain tissue: John’s brain.
“It means I can do this.” He swept forward, catching John’s lips in a bruising kiss.
Sherlock sighed as if such explanations were physically painful for him. “You were asleep when I left and I knew if I woke you you’d want to come with me. I knew Mrs. Hudson would fill you in later.”
“You’ve warned Sherlock about this?”
Molly watched him with wide eyes. He was mad, absolutely mad. He wasn’t speaking English anymore. He was swaying on his feet. He could collapse any minute.
But now—Mycroft unconsciously clenched his jaw—now there was finally something Sherlock was asking for that he couldn’t do. Sherlock’s MI6 big brother who had saved him from bullies at school and terrorists in Serbia could do nothing now but give him morphine.
John took a bite of the bar. He rolled his shoulders, stretched his neck, and something caught his eye. From where his jacket was hanging on the back of the door he could see a piece of white paper sticking out of the inner pocket. He hadn't noticed it before. Wondering whose vital lab results he’d forgotten to submit he crossed the room and plucked it out.
But his answer was always the same, in dreaming or in waking.
Moran looked pleased. “Thank you. It’s a fine compliment coming from an accomplished chemist such as yourself. Chemistry is a hobby of mine; I might have gone into the field, but psychology has always had my heart.”
Sherlock!” John breathed.
John breathed, almost choking on the words.
“Oh, sod off,” John said, opening the door with his free hand.
Sherlock grinned into the microscope. He had many reasons to be grateful that John was a doctor and not an accountant.
He let his hand drop away from the light switch.
John breathed hard through his nose. In, out, trying not to hyperventilate. If Sherlock was poisoned… But no… Something was off. Sherlock’s expression… But of course he would look like that if Moran had just told him the poison Sherlock had himself declared to be ‘genius’ and ‘unbeatable’ was running in his own veins… John held his head in his hands. Dizzy. He couldn’t breathe. Irreversible poison in Sherlock’s blood—no antidote—the idea ripped through him like jagged metal. It
“Weren’t you?” Sherlock asked. “What do the dead men have in common?”
“He’s out tonight anyway,” John said, returning his attention to the gym bag he was packing. “Mycroft basically blackmailed him into going to some function.”
He swallowed hard at the memory. He reached out to touch John’s arm but he hesitated.
Sherlock sat up again. “Stay,” he said, possibly more forcefully than he meant to, because he cleared his throat and tried again. “Erm, please stay.” He looked hard at John, who shifted under the intensity of his stare.
“I was there. He blew his brains out the back of his head.”
And it wasn’t. Mycroft liked to make everything about him (at least Sherlock had thought the solar system revolved around the Earth. Mycroft believed it revolved around himself). Prison might have been the trigger, but the truth was Sherlock would have found drugs anyway. His brain was like a rocket trapped on a launch pad, tearing itself to pieces, and the distractions that the world had to offer—school, research, experiments, even the violin—would have lost their effectiveness with time. He was young, but even then it was inevitable that he would discover the euphoric effects of the chemicals that could save him from himself.
Sherlock hadn’t taken his eyes off of John.
“I don’t have to be surprised,” Sherlock objected. If he was going to be outnumbered he could at least be insolent about it.
. It was intense beyond anything John had ever experienced.
“He’s stopped speaking English!” she said desperately. “I think he’s going to overdose.”
game like Cluedo then?” John said, delighted in having seized this opportunity. “Since it’s much too infantile for a mind like yours.”
"Yeah, ten minutes." The room was pressing in on him, warm, as though it were tucking him in. Nice living room.
"Ok then."
They stood in the centre of Tony’s living room. There was an open beer on the side table next to the couch and
handle the planning.”
Sherlock glanced up at him through black eyelashes. God he was beautiful. John wished like hell people would stop trying to break him.
John finished the whisky and ordered another.
“I don’t know what happened.” She stepped from John’s chair to stand in front of them. “But I believe she was killed.” She removed her bra, and John was forced to notice, despite the inappropriateness in the context of the conversation, that she had nice—he cleared his throat—very nice breasts.
John shut his eyes. That voice. Unmistakable. Inimitable. The rich baritone as beautiful as every other part of the detective. Deep and smooth; the perfect English accent. The man could narrate bloody nature documentaries if he wanted to. John remembered the terror that had stricken him when he thought he was forgetting the sound of it in the years Sherlock was gone.
John woke up on his right side with a dull pain aching through it. The living room floor was not nearly as comfortable as the drug had made it seem. The rug was thin, very thin, and the wood floorboards were pressing into his hip and shoulder with bruising force. His left shoulder was stiff. His back was cold—no blanket. But he supposed he didn't really need one, what with his peacefully sleeping, heat-generating flatmate curled into his front. No, a blanket wasn't necessary when he had—
From the beginning.
John's eyes shot to Sherlock, who merely steepled his fingers together. He would play this close to his chest, John knew. He wouldn't let her know the possible importance of her information.
It occurred to Sherlock that John was the only person who ever made smiles want to break out across his face. He attempted to stifle one now as he said, “John, your courage is truly impressive.”
“I don’t care about my shirts.”
It was around six o’clock in the evening of the third day and Sherlock had been working silently, racing around the room with bloodshot eyes and hair standing up wildly: the very portrait of a mad scientist. He hadn’t spoken for hours and when he did Molly had to do a double take.
“What’s your name then?” Sherlock asked his new guard.
All of these instances had been manageable individually. He had locked each one away in what had been an airtight stronghold, but now… There was a rushing noise in his head; his mind palace was flooding; he couldn’t think... John’s clear eyes were watching him inquisitively, waiting.
Emilia Ricoletti: An old case filed somewhere in the archives of his mind’s library. The woman who shot herself through the head and continued on to commit various murders. In his altered state of mind he’d been convinced that if he could solve Ricoletti’s case then he could solve Moriarty’s. It made perfect sense.
“I’m an amateur dancer.”
But who was Moran? He was Moriarty’s second in command; clever, sure, but in the end just a man. He knew it wouldn’t solve all of Sherlock’s problems, but it would strike a lasting blow against the opposition: the forces trying to hurt Sherlock, the ones John wouldn’t be able to protect him from anymore.
Ever since the bizarre, half-miscommunicated conversation that first night at Angelo’s, John had been trying to piece together the mystery that was Sherlock Holmes’ sexual history. And he had to say, after years of careful attention and collection of various clues, he’d done a right lousy job of it.
Sherlock flexed his hands. “Molly, I think Mary should have her
He struggled to order his sluggish thoughts. Why? Why was he back at Baker Street? He was supposed to be in John’s hospital room. They had moved him here. Why? They wanted him out of the way. Or perhaps there was something they didn’t want him to see—
John’s eyes flashed up at him in annoyance, but he returned his attention to the text. Sherlock waited. John was a writer. Perhaps he could make something of it. Well, he wasn’t a
He breathed deeply, closing his eyes and willing the flood to dissipate, now that it had done its damage. The waves of Feelings seeped down through the floors of his mind palace, back into the depths of his subconscious. There was shocking disorder in the aftermath, but Sherlock could deal with that later. He could function well enough for the time being, now that the storm had cleared.
Sherlock began walking up the block toward the Bauer woman's house. There was the sound of an engine. A car door slammed.
Sherlock grinned.
But no… What about when John eventually tired of Sherlock’s exhausting, morbid work, and then finally of Sherlock himself? Mary had been John’s best life raft. She had been John’s way out, his way back to a safe, normal life where people didn’t kidnap him and strap bombs to him, or stick needles in his neck and try to burn him alive. But now John had cut the life raft loose.
A memory surfaced in his mind: Another time they’d been so close but at the same time impossibly separated. It was the cemetery. John reaching out and touching his gravestone. John had spoken to him. Sherlock was there, just a few metres away, watching. He could hear everything.
“Have your observational skills deteriorated so far? You might have noticed I’m wearing an entirely different outfit.”
“You know he was better off with me.”
“Switzerland?”
But Sherlock was watching them with a blank expression. Calculating, John hoped.
Mycroft, he was told as he stepped out of the limo in front of the Diogenes Club, was waiting for him in a private room. John quietly made his way there. Once he’d safely closed the door behind him he turned toward Mycroft Holmes, who was sitting in an armchair reading a newspaper, one leg crossed over the other. Hair: immaculately combed. Suit: expensive.
“…So what?”
Mrs. Hudson looked at him, blank with shock.
He raked his hand through his hair trying not to remember how John’s hand had felt there, pushing back through until he was falling asleep. It was a surprisingly sedating motion. Sherlock hadn’t remembered. No one had touched him like that since he was very young. He was astonished to find it worked just as well on adults. John must have known that. There were probably a lot of things John knew that Sherlock didn’t about—
John said slowly, controlling his voice, “Do you mean that you called me away from Emily’s this morning to
John hung up.
“Right, you try not doing something he tells you to; let me know how that goes.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes and Lestrade raised his eyebrows. Really, what had gotten into John today? He was concerningly chipper.
The nineteenth century dream was connected to the incident in the cemetery tonight. He knew it was connected, somehow, but the chaos in his mind left him grasping at sense in a storm of discordant thoughts.
Sherlock watched her for a moment and Molly’s blush deepened. “Always, you know I’m always…” she fumbled, “happy to help.”
"You look a bit like an idiot," Sherlock agreed.
“Well, I’m sorry to hear that,” John said. “It was a good friend of yours.”
Sherlock shifted his hands on John’s back, pulling him closer, though John hadn’t thought it was possible:
“Yep, that’s what normal people do,” John cut in.
"I want to apologise in advance, Mrs. Avery," John said. "I think I've fallen down a set of stairs more gracefully than I dance."
“No, no, of course not”—Moran handed the syringe to Tweedledum—“You
“I loved Karina. She was like my sister. We came here to England together. I assume you’re here about her.”
John fumbled, stepping forward and pulling Sherlock toward him when he should have been pushing him back. They collided and John stopped.
“No, nothing terrible”—John returned the smile—“You’ll be seeing more of me.” He took the armful of bags and was glad the place was just around the corner from 221B. Sherlock and his damned fancy, dry-clean-only clothes. In John’s opinion it was totally unnecessary for a person who works primarily in his living room to wear such formal outfits, but then Sherlock had always been a public school toff so what else could he expect?
But Sherlock didn’t stop walking when he should have. He went farther, crowding into John’s space. John’s eyes widened, but he didn’t step back.
John tilted his head down as he often did when he smiled. He chuckled and said, “You’re just getting this now? What other kind of person would spend time helping you pick an upset jar of eyeballs off the kitchen floor?”
Moran leaned in closer. “Because the hero, Mr. Holmes, is not supposed to die.”
postmortem bruising.”
He was glad Sherlock had been on his left, and that he was able to reach for Sherlock with his left hand. He could shoot with either hand better than most marksmen, but he’d received more training with his right and preferred it in a crisis.
"Sherlock?"
“Did you do that?”
John’s good humour lasted until they arrived back at the inn and he discovered Sherlock’s accommodation plan for the night.
Mycroft’s posture was rail straight and Sherlock knew that even if his fighting skills were superior, his detestable brother could make things more difficult than he had time for.
John crossed his arms. "How about this logic? This is my room, that’s my bed, and
He looked at his friend now, in his dressing gown and bare feet, not nearly as tall or intimidating as he seemed when prowling the streets of London in that coat. But still, he was Sherlock Holmes. A unique kind of potential energy radiated around him. John would feel it if he were blindfolded. And even slouched against the kitchen doorframe in his pyjamas, no one could mistake those sinewy muscles, that aristocratic delicacy of bone structure and air of entitled superiority, those bright eyes flecked with such an unlikely array of colours, reflecting a mind as dazzling as the universe.
“Solved another one for Scotland Yard then?” John asked, waiting for what he hoped would be a satisfactory explanation for the abrupt end to his latest relationship. “Another threat to the citizens of London to be eliminated?”
“Home. Need a new strategy now that your bit of gallantry has put a ticking clock on our investigation.”
“Ok,” John mumbled, walking off toward the stairs. “Ok.”
“I guess this means you didn’t get the milk, then?” John asked as they swung open the doors of the school pool and stepped out into the car park. Moriarty and his snipers were long gone. There was no sign he had been there at all.
"Hello, I’m Hannah, sorry to wake you, nice to meet you."
as sex? In the end are you really so obvious?”
you told Mrs. Hudson to babysit me all day,” Sherlock complained, jumping out of his chair and pacing around to stand opposite John. “I suppose you don’t have any idea how aggravating that was.”
John looked annoyed, and when he spoke his tone confirmed Sherlock's appraisal. “Your suicide holiday? Remember? You came back to London and told me the only reason I had to spend two years thinking you were dead was because you thought I’d say something ‘indiscreet.’”
A cold feeling was seeping into Sherlock’s stomach as he realised where John was going with this.
When Redbeard died it was the ideal opportunity for a lesson.
His grey eyes held Sherlock’s mercilessly.
When Sherlock walked back into the flat around four-thirty in the morning he was surprised to see John sleeping on the couch.
“Always so logical, little brother. Where is the logic in pretending?”
From the start.
He stood in the dark for just a second before dim lights flickered, illuminating the enormous space. He blinked rapidly, eyes adjusting to the light. There was a group of men standing just a few metres off. They all turned to look at him.
He shouted the address at the driver, unaware of Mycroft getting into another car behind him.
“No.”
I watched as his hands reached up to the cupboard for two tea cups, placing them deftly on the tray that he had already prepped with a sugar bowl and cream jug. He then picked it up and nodded at me to head towards the table.
“Hmm…” Holmes gave me a curious look as I made a thoughtful noise, and narrowed his eyes slightly, giving more attention to me than he previously had. “There’s simply one thing I don’t quite understand.”
“Holmes?” My voice was barely a whisper.
“That is not what I meant,” he said softly, “but if you insist,” he made a flourish with his hand toward the floor where I had laid out the pillow and blanket, “by all means.” With that he left the room for a moment to change into his nightwear, and as I did so myself, I pondered upon what in the world he
, if I was being honest with myself, I knew exactly what had happened. This strange, steady, and strong affection that I felt for Holmes had slowly grown larger and larger over the months, and I had failed, until this moment, to properly comprehend what it signalled. I don’t think that I have ever loved a man before, but I also don’t think I’ve ever loved anyone in the way that I love Holmes. Previous flirtations with women had been solely that: short and sweet, merely a fleeting moment of attraction, whereas
Holmes gave me a small smile, and the twinkle in his eye that told me he was not going to explain just yet. He gestured to the papers sitting on the table in front of him, as if to say ‘see if you can figure it out yourself’, and I let out a great sigh as I approached him, picking up my latest completed Sherlock Holmes story, which I had entitled ‘the Adventure of the Veiled Lodger’. I took a seat opposite my partner, carefully reading through the story as he smoked his pipe and continued to scrutinise me as I read.
“Well, to be honest with you my dear fellow, I’m not sure what to think.”
“Hmm…” Holmes put on a pensive look before suggesting, in a completely serious tone: “Hypnosis, perhaps?”
I took my spot and we both quietly made ourselves comfortable, each in turn making our cups of tea and settling down with a respective paper to read through.
“Holmes, listen to th-”
For some odd reason, Holmes continued in his, what I can only describe to be, incessant teasing about my unfortunate slip up. I had never considered him a cruel man, but was seriously reconsidering my evaluation of him in this regard, because why else would he find so much amusement in continuously tormenting me? The only silver lining to his teasing was that I felt I could confidently assume that he had not taken my use of “dear” as serious, but rather as an insignificant mistake that was endlessly humorous to him.
It was in that way, that upon leaving Strasbourg, we made our way slowly south toward Geneva, setting a somewhat leisurely pace in order to properly take in the picturesque landscape that Switzerland offered. Soon enough, we found ourselves at the end of our journey, though we of course never made it to our intended destination. We arrived at the village of Meiringen in the early afternoon of May 3rd, wherein we found ourselves presented with the same issue as our first night of travel. It was explained to us that while it was not ideal, the hotel was expecting a vacancy the next day, and that we would only be one night in the room with the single bed.
To my great dismay I was entirely wrong about the curio shop being connected to our current case, and it was while I was trying not to sulk about this fact that some odd detail, that was of no note to anyone else, had suddenly revealed itself to Holmes, and he had at once jumped up and was proclaiming that he had finally pieced it together. I’ve made it clear that I hold a great deal of affection for the man, and when he is in a good mood, I can’t help but also be happy.
I let out a little huff, grabbed the paper off the table, it was now slightly crumpled and maybe a little damp, and read the article of interest outloud to him. When I was done, Holmes had a thoughtful look on his face. He then nodded once, turned again, and as he exited the room called out to me, “Five minutes, Watson!”
He stared at me for a moment, as if trying to figure out some mystery that I had presented him, then, “You
Holmes continued on in his investigation, but he still had that amused and self-satisfied look about him. I scowled in response and averted my gaze. Up until this point, his gibing had always been in private, and it had irritated me, but I allowed it to continue because, well, for lack of a better reason, part of me also enjoyed it. But now? Right in front of Lestrade, where he could have overheard him and gotten the wrong impression? I very much wanted to argue with Holmes about it, but knew that if I did make such a scene Lestrade would expect some sort of explanation. Instead I tried to school my expression, and when Lestrade did ask me what the matter was, I simply waved his question away and made a comment about not sleeping very well the night before.
“Well, what is it?” I asked after a moment, a small frown on my face.
I felt slightly nauseous. Had Holmes deduced this? Was my comment this morning enough to reveal myself to him? It mortified me to not know his thoughts, but I would not even entertain the idea of bringing it up to him. Aside from my disappointment at being incorrect about the curio shop, it had been a good day, almost indistinguishable from any other day with Holmes, with absolutely no mention of my indiscretion this morning. No, he had seemingly dismissed it as nothing more than a meaningless slip of the tongue, and I would try to put it behind me as he had obviously done.
"We're going to have to get off the floor eventually," John lamented.
brain,” John replied tetchily.
I have no idea what brought him back; he should have been dead. So if you lie to me now, there will be nothing left of this fucked up marriage to salvage.
John crossed his arms over his chest, angry with himself for having unconsciously started down this path. “It doesn’t matter. It’s stupid. You didn’t commit suicide; you didn’t die. It’s irrelevant now.”
“What makes you think that?”
The physical exertion combined with the breath-taking scenery gave John a natural high which worked wonders on his nerves. He’d been so achingly stressed in the final weeks with Mary; now he felt the tension leaving his body. He imagined his negative feelings falling away from him as he ran, and he came back to the hotel each day feeling lighter than ever. He used to run to keep in training, back in his university rugby days, and he liked the feeling of getting back to it.
“Yes, there’s a reason!” Sherlock snarled, whipping around to face the DI. “There’s always a reason! I do not do actions without reasons. Frankly it’s astounding that you don’t know this yet. Really, Lestrade, how long does it take you to learn anything? You must’ve spent ten years in secondary school. Miss and Mr. Bauer are involved in my murder investigation. If they have a problem with that, they can file a complaint with themselves, because it’s their own fault for living their inane, stupid lives in a way that has put them directly in the way of
So John had gone about his day seeing patients. He'd handed out the usual diagnoses and prescriptions and encouraging smiles: “You’ll be fine.”
And Sherlock was looking at him, breathing heavily, eyes questioning, unsure, waiting, and suddenly John wanted to do none of those things. He moved forward and ran his left hand through Sherlock’s hair, gently tangling his fingers in the curls at the back. With his right hand he held the side of Sherlock’s face.
It was the last message John sent him. No nagging questions, no insisting on being included. John’s reticence and his patience were two reasons why he preferred John’s company over anyone else’s. John didn’t mind silent cab rides, hours of silence in the midst of pressing cases. He allowed Sherlock to let him in on his own time.
“Forget it.” John gritted his teeth.
John slowly moved his hand out from under Sherlock’s. He tucked his phone away and wrapped his arm back around him. He looked out the window at the streets of the city they both loved, the city that tried to kill them on a regular basis, giving them the danger they needed to survive.
“And that will be a very embarrassing day for me professionally, so you have to understand why I’m taking precautions.”
Standing in the darkened hospital room Mycroft looked grimly at the unconscious and wrecked form of his brother holding desperately onto John’s wrist as though it were a life preserver. The tableau gave him a sense of déjà vu. He’d seen this scene before. He’d seen it the night John shot the cab driver. He’d watched Sherlock realising, understanding—watched his eyes as John was suddenly reinterpreted in his mind. And the look on his brother’s face then, eye’s never leaving John’s—Mycroft knew what it meant. It meant this scene, here, now, in the hospital. Like a premonition, Mycroft had seen Sherlock just as he was now at John’s bedside. But of course there were no such things as premonitions. It was simply the balance of probability. His brother’s work was dangerous; it was only a matter of time before John ended up here, either dead or barely alive. It was incredible it hadn’t happened sooner.
He lifted his head and furrowed his eyebrows at his suddenly tense flatmate. “The Woman, surely you remember.”
Sherlock took another step forward, looming over her. “I will give you one more chance to move."
“Another apt demonstration, John, of why we let
“Say it,” Sherlock repeated. John knew better than anyone there was no deterring a curious consulting detective.
And Molly had understood immediately. Sherlock was in love with him. Of course he was. It was no small feat to hold any percentage of that great brain’s attention, and John did it effortlessly. There was nothing so special or spectacular about John Watson, which made it all the more heartbreaking. Molly had believed the scientist could never love an ordinary person. But when he brought John to the lab she realised that he could; it just wasn’t her.
John uncrossed his arms reluctantly. He walked over to Mycroft, took the envelope, and dropped down into the chair across from him.
“That would be very ambitious of you,” Sherlock said, huffily pulling the plate out of John’s hand. “Are all soldiers so annoyingly adamant about toast?”
Sherlock gave a curt nod.
But this time was different. John was a human time bomb with no visible clock. His presence in the lab would cause additional stress, and without being able to contribute to the science in any meaningful way he would only be a distraction.
and the mind-blowing fact that she has
He had warned Sherlock not to get involved. Of course it had been too late even then. And now… He would watch Sherlock closely now.
John couldn’t help laughing. It felt good. Really good. He took off his coat and he let the thick drops soak through his shirt. When he glanced over he saw Sherlock watching him.
“Oh,” John said finally, “you think it’s a sex thing, like what Irene Adler did.”
But in spite of everything Mycroft couldn’t help feeling a soft spot for his little brother, who looked up at him with wide, earnest eyes and said ‘Mycot’ before he’d mastered the more difficult ‘r’ and ‘f’ sounds.
John stuffed his hands in his pockets and rocked back on his heels. Sherlock smirked inwardly at his own attempt at optimism. No, it wasn’t possible. Because he knew now that if John touched him his skin would burn. If John put his hands in his hair and his lips on his mouth he wouldn’t stop him. He had learned last night that all it took now was a caution-inhibiting drug to ask John to sleep in his bed. What would happen the next time there was alcohol or drugs? The two came up rather often in his work. He might not be able to stop himself from… And he would lose everything.
She walked over to a set of drawers at the side of the room. “She met him only once, like me. He was polite, professional. It’s not so bad to work here.” She pulled open a drawer. “We are well paid, there’s good security, our clients are screened for their health.” She turned and John saw she was holding a long knife in her hand.
“I can’t
back—and it would be just the two of them again like it had been before he died, before Mary… Just the two of them against the rest of the world. This—this moment—was everything he had thought about: out in London in the night, hot on the trail, new evidence, case nearly solved, John at his side, laughing,
“My partner’s in the car. It won’t be a problem, sir.”
She was sitting in John’s chair. Mrs. Hudson had let her in. He would have to have a word with Mrs. Hudson.
“Emily,” he whispered, sitting down on the edge of her bed.
Sherlock didn’t respond.
“So the question is,” John said after a minute, “who invented it?”
Sherlock stood with his arms at his sides, violin and bow dangling from either hand, quite speechless.
“Why would someone
Sherlock looked up at the man. “Pleased to make your acquaintance,” he slurred, trying to blink his vision clear.
“Well excuse me for trying to intervene before she jumped you,” he muttered.
The psychologist’s light blue eyes told Sherlock he was quite surprised to see him, although not entirely displeased. Two lackeys flanked him on either side. They were younger, just in their mid-twenties, wearing suits that were smart but not designer: smaller fish, lower on Moriarty’s ladder. The two of them had a very similar look, though Sherlock observed they were not brothers (the distribution of dominant and recessive traits made the possibility very unlikely).
He decided on Sibelius’s violin concerto. It was a good night for the minor key.
John looked over at him and smiled ruefully. “No, thanks, Sherlock. I’m fine. Have to get some sleep before my shift…”
“We can’t take any risks. Not when we’re this close to winning. They could be working for Moran.”
The consulting criminal removed the snorkel piece of the mask from his mouth. He grinned. “Come on in, Sherlock. The water’s fine.”
“Don’t,” he said. “It’s still sharp.”
“Then stay in tonight, if you’re not avoiding me. Eat dinner here for once.”
“John, you, erm—”
He moved to guide Sherlock into the car, and was surprised to feel some resistance. He looked back and saw Sherlock’s eyes flicking over him. A moment later he felt the detective’s hand in his hair, fingers pushing back through it. Out of the corner of his eye John saw sparks and glints of light falling down around him. Glass, he realised. There was glass in his hair from the shattered window. Sherlock ran both of his hands through again John’s eyes involuntarily fell shut.
to John, the way it had almost happened today… Sherlock’s eyes flicked down at the bandage and he found he didn’t have the words to finish the thought.
John sincerely hoped there wasn’t any kind of afterlife, because he knew that if even the smallest piece of him went on he wouldn’t feel anything but pain for missing Sherlock.
John shot him an annoyed look and Mycroft smirked.
John's exasperation was peaking. "That's my point! My work at the surgery is mine."
He reached out to take one of the petals but Sherlock caught his hand before he could touch it.
“She doesn’t need both of us to go,” John said, aware that he was now probably talking more to his guilty conscience than to Sherlock. “As long as you’re going I’m sure she won’t mind if I skip it.”
He felt impossibly light, almost unaware of the pavement beneath his shoes. As a doctor, John knew the warning signs of fainting. He knew the symptoms of the poison too: hypotension, eventually hypoperfusion. His brain wasn’t getting enough oxygen. He should probably sit down somewhere.
John did the last button and looked at himself in the full length mirror on the door of his wardrobe.
people a bit,” John said, figuring he could at least remind Sherlock there was such thing as a moral compass, even if neither of them found much cause to use it.
“But it doesn’t have to
She loved him and he didn’t love her back. There was nothing left to do but walk away.
He wasn’t aware of the extent to which John would be affected… Was it true then? Did Sherlock really not know? Was it possible he really didn’t realise…
Sherlock smirked. The art of bollockspeak was not lost on John. “Tell us what you remember about the last time you saw Amy.”
By Felix Mendelssohn.”
Lestrade had grinned at the confirmation. So he’d been right. The socks must be important if Sherlock was willing to fly in from Ireland for it.
But the scientist was sleeping soundly, and when John had relaxed enough to assure himself Sherlock was not about to leap up and chuck the flat-listings page at his face, he tilted his head carefully to see Sherlock's hand on the dip of his waist (as though he didn't believe the sensory input that was telling him it was true) and saw slender fingers digging into his t-shirt there, clutching the material.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “You won’t have to.”
John turned back.
Sherlock had his elbows on the arms of his chair and his fingers intertwined. He didn’t speak, so John continued. “Things didn’t get better,” he said. “I thought things would get better but they didn’t.” John finally lifted his eyes and met Sherlock’s. He needed Sherlock to understand this, and not to argue with him. “I don’t want to—I can’t—live like that anymore. It’s over. So, if you’ve got used to having the flat to yourself I can rent my own place, but either way it’s done, and I’m not going back.”
No matter how many times he replayed the arguments, voluntarily or involuntarily, the conclusion was always the same: According to ‘Sherlogic,’ Mary had only done what she’d strategically needed to do at the time. According to non-crazy-people logic, his wife had chosen to murder his best friend rather than accept any consequences for her lies.
John cleared his plate and came to stand behind Sherlock’s chair. “How does it work then?” he asked.
Her next sentences were a rush of words. "It's probably nothing. You're right, I just thought it was—I don't know—I've probably spent too much time on the blog and I thought—I'm so sorry for waking you up and then wasting your time, I'm sure it'll be best if I just leave—"
And wasn’t it possible… The way John looked at him, the way he touched him… Sherlock stamped the thought down before it could go any further. Even if it were possible that John could want to be with him in that way (despite the doctor’s peculiar hobby of announcing his heterosexuality at every opportunity), first, regardless of what he was now acutely aware that he wanted, romantic entanglements had never been an option for him. He couldn’t have his mind palace flooding with Feelings for John all the time. They hadn’t even kissed tonight and still his mind was a disaster zone. It was out of the question; he wouldn’t be able to think clearly; he wouldn’t be able to work; he could lose important documents in floodwaters. He needed to get the mess in his head cleaned up as soon as possible if he wanted his cognitive functioning back on full power.
“And you read and remembered all of the alcohols on the shelf.”
“What?”
God, Sherlock, I won't throw away everything I am just because I met you. I left Mary. My work at the surgery is all I have that's independent from you."
John handed over cash for the cover charges. As a rule, his bloody incompetent flatmate never had cash. He often wondered if Sherlock had ever used a cash machine, and even more often wondered how the man managed to simply survive on a day-to-day basis.
“Yes, of course,” Moran replied.
“You could at least tell me what he has planned,” Sherlock grumbled. “The hero is entitled to a revelation of all the secret plots before he dies. Hollywood says so.”
John had lost all of the newlywed weight he’d initially gained and more. And the nightmares had worsened. Some nights he was back in Afghanistan—in the field seeing his troopmates fall beside him. Some nights he was back on the side street of Barts hospital, struggling through restraining hands to get to the body on the pavement. And still, some nights, to his surprise (it had been so long ago), he dreamed of the pool: the bright red of the sniper’s laser sight on Sherlock’s forehead and then the much deeper red that ran from the same point. He remembered the dream well—a recurring nightmare that had started after the confrontation with Moriarty: Sherlock falling into the water and John jumping in after him, but the pool was vast and the vest full of explosives weighed a ton and it was pulling him down and he couldn’t reach Sherlock’s hand and he couldn’t breathe.
“Get in,” the woman whose name was not Anthea said, opening the door of the limousine.
He was Sherlock Holmes. He was the master of deduction. Seeing things,
“Who knows, maybe it might come in handy for a bizarre case under the sea. Or maybe I’m getting myself a pet octopus.”
“In that case, consider this your warning. Do you think some set rules and punishments might help you, to forgive
John didn’t do anything wrong and John was hurt and cold and-
“Precisely.”
just ask him to leave. Still have the bath. But it wouldn’t be the same without Daddy.
Turned out, Sherlock had texted Greg, after all. Greg made a big show of reading it out loud to John, imitating Sherlock’s tone and intonation in a ridiculous manner, which made the little doctor snort around his mouth full of pancakes.
. Something clicked into place in his mind.
John stared at the rim of his empty glass and wished that he had ordered a re-fill before this conversation.
Life was fucking hard, okay? John Watson deserved some god-damn comfort. And that night, Sherlock Holmes was comfort.
He had John. He had John in a way he never experienced before, a way that left him feel out of his depth most of the time. But he knew, he just did, that he had a responsibility towards his partner, which he disgustingly neglected in the past days. Weeks.
The weight of the situation dawned on John momentarily (and pushed him to age up a tiny little bit), as his eyes flickered between his best friend and his partner.
“So, now, do you want to age up to have breakfast with Greg? Or do you want to stay little?”
Sherlock talked for about half an hour. Greg sat quietly, listening attentively, asking for clarification every now and again. He also watched Sherlock carefully, taking in the different emotions playing out on the detective’s face as he relived different memories.
People made mistakes, all the time.
The shame in his voice held more about big John than little John. It wouldn’t be the first time that embarrassment kicked John out of his headspace a bit.
He gave John a pointed look, which John was familiar with from countless pub-crawls and brunch meetings. He wouldn’t be able to resist the grin tugging on his lips if he tried.
“Please?”
Except, that there wasn’t. Not even two days later, Mycroft came around with a case of ‘outmost importance’- something about a suspicious suicide of some Canadian ambassador- that
Because it was worrying.
They sat in silence for several minutes. The friendly atmosphere had shifted to something tenser, John was getting uneasy because he questioned his harsh reaction the more minutes Greg just regarded him silently. He almost started to feel bad. He had yelled at Sherlock. He had been kind of unfair, not letting Sherlock explain his rationale, however overwhelming it might be.
“He’ll understand.”
And now, it didn’t even matter. Sherlock was back and right there with him.
He could vividly picture the genius laying in bed, going over every little detail of the plans until he felt satisfied and how eager he must have been to call, to check in with him. He was painstakingly familiar with Sherlock’s moods, how little patience he had with things that were important to him.
The process of coaxing him back into Baker Street had been tiring and painful. But he was home, at last.
the final straw. It took all of John’s energy to not just loose it right then and there. It was a pretty close call.
Something had happened between them, three days into the case, and it wouldn’t leave Sherlock alone. It refused to be pushed to the back of his mind, so it hindered his thought-process regarding the case (it wasn’t a big deal, per se.

between them that had been keeping his mind occupied for the past week.
Well.
Instead of throwing a negative remark against the DI’s head, Sherlock just eyed his hands thoughtfully; for a very long moment.
It started with John waking up to a cold bed on a rainy Wednesday morning, with a sticky note attached to Sherlock’s pillow: ‘A five. Back at noon. -SH’.
“You’re taking this better than I imagined.”
And he was amazing, right now.
“It’s so good to hear your voice.” John should have been prepared by now for the fact that sometimes Sherlock could be inexplicably sweet (and a bit of a mind-reader, too), but it still caught him off guard in the best kind of ways. The little doctor lay down on his back, fighting the urge to hug the phone close to his chest. He opted for teddy instead.
Which was precisely the reason why Sherlock loved him madly and was infuriated with him at the very same time.
The door creaked open and Greg hurried to stand behind John, to be a safe presence immediately available, should the man feel upset by his partner’s departure. Separation anxiety wasn’t a new trouble of John’s, and Greg was unsure how it’ll play out once he was in a more vulnerable mind-set. Better have a bear-hug prepared and ready.
“John,” his voice, nothing but a warm rumble. It had an instant effect. John still had his back turned to him, but he stayed at the spot. Sherlock felt his doctor’s heartbeat racing against his palm. “What’s wrong?”
John blinked, his eyes still so unbelievable
“None of that. Spill. You’re not getting drunk over nothing, alcoholism doesn’t suit you.”
John shivered a little but hugged him back with as much strength as he could muster. His breath turned a little uneven and wet, but Sherlock pretended not to notice. Instead, he laid his cheek on top of John’s head and swayed them slightly, to calm his distressed little love down.
Sherlock pretended that he didn’t hear it.
He didn’t know what to type, the heightened emotional state made his brain slightly hazy. So, he settled for a straight-forward approach: ‘Hi D-’ (here, he hesitated over the keys, unsure if the direct address would only serve to worry Sherlock. He didn’t want that.)
“It’s an article about octopi. They’re incredibly intelligent and simply fascinating creatures.”
And it served to make him feel even more miserable. He had been unfair while Sherlock had just tried to be considerate. He missed the mark a bit (

sad. It reminded him of the crippling depression that was still haunting him to this day, of all the guilt and anxiety and weight on his chest, the reason why he was so broken now, so dysfunctional as an adult that he pretended to be a kid to be alright. Well. Looks like the negative thoughts joined in on the fun of making John feel bad about himself.
Greg regarded the tense muscles in John’s back with a frown. His posture was way too stiff to fool anyone he was enjoying himself.
There it was.
. There was something in them that Sherlock had never seen before, but it called to him; he felt it tug at his heart forcefully and in a wild epiphany, he realized that he loved John Watson; that he always had; that he always would; that he would give the world for his selfless, caring doctor, blogger, and friend.
Even then, the big, wet spot and the smell he now recognized as urine were kind of sobering.
slightly different about his friend turn boyfriend (a title that gave Sherlock immense satisfaction to think about. He hadn’t been overly interested in relationships since his early twenties, but John was everything one could desire in a partner and more, so he was proud to say that John was the exception to his ‘relationships are a nuisance’-approach).
“But-“ another quiver of his upper lip- “But I’m-“ fighting for the words to come out- “not a
When his belly was pleasantly filled and his sides hurt a little from laughing so much, John gathered up all his courage to address Greg directly.
John rolled his eyes playfully, muttering “Utter madman” under his breath. He focused his attention back to the telly, but Sherlock felt the slight tension radiating off him, like he was itching for something but didn’t have the nerve to ask. A something that probably was part of the bigger
“C’mon, Sherlock, you’re smarter than that.”
Empty pizza boxes were scattered on the coffee table and someone (most likely John, who was no longer snuggled up against him) had turned off the TV (they had been half-way through
“Pants or pull-up?” The simple question pulled John away from his adult thoughts.
It had just… made sense. It had been a logical conclusion. John’s fear of another accident was heightened in a child-like mindset and the pull-ups provided an easy source of comfort. The sheer thought of accusing John of being

The backlash came right away.
Momentarily, it looked like John was ready to fight it some more, but instead, he surprised Sherlock once again: “I don’t want to hide from Greg.”
about all of this. It was devastating to even think about it. They wouldn’t be able to swallow it, to play it down, they couldn’t ignore it like John tried to ignore the accident- oh! Maybe that, that was there, somewhere, and the reading, too, and everything that had happened between them when John’s eyes had turned soft and young.
Because it wasn’t true.
The atmosphere however, made him stop in his tracks. Something was off. More specifically, John was off. Usually after a solve, John would listen to him ramble while he had dinner ready, ushering his detective to catch up on the missed nutrition, with a smile on his face (Sherlock hated to admit that he became kind of dependent on this kind of doting and that he secretly looked forward to it).
“So humble,” Sherlock chuckled, but started to dig into his own food nonetheless.

he could (hopefully) give him; but as long as John didn’t ask for it, he couldn’t be certain. This was a scenario very unlikely in the near future, considering John didn’t even talk to him at the present moment.
They were so
Suddenly, John frowned slightly to himself.
It took Sherlock ten days to solve it.
This didn’t seem to be the case now, however.
He gave John a triumphant smirk and ruffled his hair. “In fact, being dumb sounds quite lovely! I should try it myself.”
John quickly realized that spending time with Sherlock
“Great-“And Sherlock leaped right into another one of his monologues, which wasn’t- despite being packed with useful information- any less obnoxious in the early hours of the morning.
But still. Sherlock had to know he texted him and not Greg, didn’t he?
“It’s raw, and confusing, and ridiculous but that’s what makes it

‘I have to give my speech. I will call you once I’m back at the hotel. I love you!’
The little doctor just nodded, already rushing to the bathroom with the bag, Sherlock had brought with him last night. While he wasn’t so ashamed of the pull-up now that he was little, he still wouldn’t want Greg to find it in his trash bin.
John blushed a bright shade of red, snatched the pull-up from Sherlock’s hand and trotted towards the guest bathroom.
Sherlock exhaled slowly, deliberately. The thing was, in a spark of the moment decision, Sherlock had decided to bring a pull-up along

John traced the rim of his tea-cup with his pointer finger, feigning nonchalance.

Mycroft was surprised when his brother didn’t call to bargain but to ask for a quick ride home. Mycroft’s usual sharp tone softened considerably when Sherlock explained that they were lost and John was too hurt to walk any longer. Sherlock knew that despite all the terrible things that had happened between them, despite the petty feuds and the childish rivalry- at the end of the day, he could count on his brother. It had always been that way and it would always be that way. Just the thought had been enough to keep Sherlock from losing hope whenever things went from tough to really horrible. Mycroft had his back.

‘There’s nothing wrong with you, John. This is not something that makes you less of a person,’ Sherlock wanted to say.
Because it wasn’t… in their line of work, a decent coping mechanism was hard to find and harder to keep. It was easy to get absorbed in self-destructive habits to deal with the immense stress of their day to day lives. It was easy to become addicted to substances, to bad people, to physical excesses.
In a moment of absolute inward hysteria, John thought that Sherlock would
A warm touch underneath his chin made him look up again and meet icy blue eyes sparkling with kindness.
Something wasn’t… right the way John was fighting him. Like his heart wasn’t really in it. Like he wasn’t really… mad, not mad at Sherlock, at least. He hated that he knew very well how John behaved when that was the case. This however was almost…. Childish?
- shy, and bright, and beautiful. Sherlock pressed his thumb against the upturned corner of his doctor’s lips affectionately. Everything felt so sweet and soft between them.
The reply was almost instantaneous: ‘Hi, lovebug! I’m just fine. Are you alright?’ John thought he could read the ‘If it’s not, I’m leaving to take the next plane home’ in between the lines, but maybe he was just imagining things. Even more warmth than from the hug surrounded him. Just talking to his Daddy helped to ease a whole lot of the anxiety and sadness in his heart. He settled against Greg more comfortably.
“Morning, Daddy.”
“I was busy.”
“You’re welcome, buddy.”
got this. What could go wrong with Disney?
“This part is a bit sad. Do you want to cuddle while watching?”
But Baker Street was far away, and the bed was comfy. He didn’t want to go home. He liked staying at Greg’s. Greg was his friend and he made the best breakfast. John felt comfortable with Greg.
It felt like forever ago, now. And it also felt like a different man, a man no longer lost in pain and sorrow. John looked younger like this,
John’s heart leaped into his throat by the mere notion of this word. He clambered the faint desire it awake right down.
“I just want you to be happy, love.” Not scared, as John obviously was about the whole wetting issue. But the level of audacity which he would have to display for pressuring John into a role, which was so unlike to the one he craved for, sent a cold shiver down Sherlock’s spine.
Hours later, Sherlock awoke feeling groggy and disorientated. After a case, he usually slept like he was dead for an unhealthy amount of time.
“Probably, yes.”
“I thought I was better, but clearly I’m not.”
Sherlock raised an eyebrow in silent question: ‘Is it working?’
. There’s a difference.”
Sherlock felt bad for throwing so many new and heavy things at John, but the situation pressured both of them out of their comfort zones.
that John felt his resistance slip and his desire to just let himself fall into this new, weird, intriguing aspect of their friendship grew.
Regular age-play was a necessity for John’s mental-health, Ella had said. It was something he just needed as a way to de-stress, to let go. A way to heal. Sherlock couldn’t help John with defending his demons. But at least he could have helped in making John
The DI rubbed over his face and softened his voice, allowing it to be the husky, warm timbre it usually was right after he woke up.
Aside from the morning John and Sherlock had spend at his flat, he only had ever seen ‘little John’ once. A smuggler investigation lead them right into the London Zoo, and after the case was over, the doctor had asked in a very small voice if they could stay and look at the animals. Judging by the way he was fussing right now, Sherlock must have died on the inside from nervous energy but had remained cool and collected on the outside in the face of John being little in public (well, semi-public).
“Thought so,” he mumbled and stood up, regarding his partner with an air of finality. Waiting for something, perhaps. Sherlock wasn’t sure. His mind was already miles away.
The DI didn’t expect company and thus greeted John warmly, which made the doctor feel calmer immediately. Screw Sherlock, screw age-play, screw pull-ups. He didn’t need
“Thank you,” he whispered again; his voice wavering now, and heavy with emotion. “Thank you for…”
His partner melted against him. Sherlock had seldomly seen John this deep in headspace. Usually, he would even refrain from using the term “Daddy” at all, much too shy of the (ridiculous) baby-ish implications might come with it. But tonight, Sherlock had a feeling that John really needed it. And, despite the situation, Sherlock was overcome by a warm wave of relief; relief that John still trusted him with this vulnerable part of himself; that the unfortunate incident with these blasted pull-ups wasn’t enough to damage this still fragile bond between them.
Greg laughed. But not
John was happy that Sherlock was happy- being crammed at home made his genius boyfriend crawl up the wall with boredom- although he had to admit he missed spending time with Sherlock, after having him exclusively to himself for a whole week.
If you love them as much as I do, leave some kudos, or a bookmark, or a comment ;D
Dinner went by uneventful and (relatively) clean. Greg occupied himself with the dishes while the little doctor lounged around on the couch, pretending to watch some interior design show on the telly, when he really just waited for Greg’s phone (placed on the coffee table for immediate access) to ring.
John disrespecting his efforts hurt almost as much as the rejection of the kiss earlier.
It was a tone of voice that Sherlock didn’t recognize, that he pretty sure has never heard before. He could tell that John was lying (from the quiver in his upper lip) but didn’t have the heart to point it out; not when John was in too much distress to realize that Sherlock was able to see right through him with a single glance.
“I can do it,” he mumbled sheepishly, before disappearing.
“Is he okay?”
Sherlock tentatively touched John’s hand that was resting on the leather between them, wrapping his own fingers protectively around John’s. The action, however small it was, brought a tiny smile to John’s tense lips.
While he was sure he’d get along well with all versions of his friend, and Greg had found little John absolutely adorable, Sherlock had always been with them. As far as he knew, John had never fully regressed when Sherlock wasn’t around, so it was a big step for everyone involved.
The thing was, he still wasn’t sure what John wanted out of this, ultimately.
So, Sherlock took John’s face in both of his hands and rubbed at the new tear-stains with his thumbs.
The worry in his tummy gave a small tug. John looked down at their clasped hands, and at teddy in his other hand.
It was
“’m not good. I w’s bad. I..I..I threw a tantrum and … and ‘m sorry, Daddy!”
Sherlock turned his head and smiled at his partner, who was nursing a tea and had apparently aged up quite a bit. It looked like he was no longer wearing a pull-up, though his cross-legged sitting position indicated that he wasn’t fully big either.
But there was a key-difference, wasn’t there?
Sherlock tried to sound not as relived as he did and failed spectacularly. “You don’t have to. This is not something to be ashamed of.”
Sherlock started massaging his partner’s scalp. “I’ve had many hard times with Greg, before you came into my life. There were many things I struggled with, many things I was ashamed to be honest about, but… Greg’s always been there for me.”
John only yawned and nodded, leaning heavily on Greg’s shoulder as they both stood up.
- John wouldn’t have to deal with these troubling emotions.
He squinted at his phone while he drank his water, checking for new texts. Sherlock had texted him about two hours ago, informing him that he should keep an eye on John’s intoxication levels. Greg found it weirdly endearing that Sherlock was so invested in John’s well-being. It was strange, seeing the otherwise distant and cold detective so attentive and gentle.
He leaned down, bracing himself with his hands in the grass on either side of Sherlock’s head. Sherlock watched him cautiously as he stayed for a moment, trying to steady himself as a kind of primitive want-take-have coiled through his muscles. He moved a hand to Sherlock’s neck, tugging off the scarf in one quick motion. Sherlock turned his head to the side just slightly and it was all the invitation John needed. He ducked his head, bringing a teeth-edged kiss to the pulse point just below his jaw.
“You talked to Sherlock this morning?”

normalcy had never been John’s cup of tea anyway.
However improbable.
John flexed his hands, walking over and dropping his gym bag on the floor.
“Oh, deary I’m so happy you’re home safe and sound,” she said, giving John a tight hug. He realised with a start that he hadn’t seen her, or anyone except Sherlock, since he’d come home from the hospital. Was that Sherlock’s doing, he wondered, keeping people away until John felt better? There had been no clients, no Lestrade, no cases—as far as he knew Sherlock had never even left the flat until today.
in love. The point of the theory was to spare you pain. But it’s too late for that. You’ve been through it already.”
"John Twatson."
“So?”
"No, no, that's not, erm, we're not—"
“I know. I came early to talk to you.”
"Don't say it."
Not even heroin would be strong enough to help him.
the same way it never had been.
“How well did you know your brother’s mate, Brandon?” John cut in. Sherlock looked over suspiciously. That had been his next question.
“Is that humour?” Sherlock snapped, resuming his pacing.
They went on for some time, each evaded manoeuvre only fuelling the frustration and desperate need to pin the other, to win.
“I never guess.”
Sherlock had let go of John’s arms and John surged upwards, catching the detective off guard and flipping him over onto his back, straddling his waist, reversing their positions.
Sherlock pressed the appropriate buzzer. He looked directly into a hidden camera John would never have noticed, and John watched his face shift to ‘all charm’ when the old woman answered (manipulative bastard). He introduced them as Detective Inspectors Lestrade and Wilkins. A flash of Lestrade’s badge sealed the deal.
"What?"
“No.” She looked at him hard. “I want to tell you it’s ok if you love him.”
“You can’t just use my credit card to buy something like this. I can’t afford it!”
Sherlock dropped slightly down onto the edge of the kitchen table and John stopped with some astonishment. He hadn’t been aware that he was walking Sherlock backward, pushing him back toward the table. He stood between Sherlock’s legs taking a moment to appreciate the image before him. It was like nothing he had ever seen. Sherlock was beautiful, breathtaking: breathing heavily, lips swollen and pink from kissing, pupils blown wide, eyes never leaving John’s face.
Sherlock didn’t turn around. “A mind like hers would be a terrible thing to waste,” he said.
“Well”—she shifted her weight on her feet, suddenly nervous—“I was wondering…” She hesitated. Perhaps this was going to be more interesting than he'd thought. “Well,” she said more firmly this time, “it’s just that my charity, you know the one I help out with from time to time?” She received blank looks from both Sherlock and John but continued bravely. “There’s a ball on Thursday to raise money. The man I’ve been seeing—”
Sherlock yelled at her.
“John.”
He watched in fascination as Sherlock faced the stripper with an expression that would have looked mildly interested to anyone else. But John could see he’d gone away. To his mind palace, he supposed, hopefully to run over the plan for their impending encounter.
