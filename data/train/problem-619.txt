"I missed you," said John.
"No, it's fine. I..." He threw a last glance back at Donovan. "I was just about to leave."
"When I was getting clean the
. And now he will never be able to tell him so.
"Depends."
"Yes, Doctor," Sherlock said, having his back turned towards him to look out of one of the windows.
He was getting up and looked around the room. Silence. No one there. Of course not, Irene had just left. Nervous already? It should not feel like he was doing something forbidden, but he was also about to pry around someone else's house. It made his skin tingle with excitement.
"Right..." said Lestrade, "Right!" like he was being handed a very obvious fact. He must have been used to that feeling already.
, please.”
John’s tongue flicks into his hole and Sherlock almost comes on the spot. His legs fall open even wider, and he feels his fingers clench as they try to hold onto the short strands of John’s hair. He doesn’t seem to mind, is even encouraged by it, and his tongue dips deeper into him. The head of Sherlock’s cock rubs against his belly with every heavy breath he takes, smeared in precome, and he has to, he has to come. His whole body is on fire, his heart will explode in his ribcage, and John’s tongue and fingers are relentless.
"When he told you he was a magician, he did tell the truth. You see," he said, and laid the hand that was not holding the pipe down on an invisible object between them. This object was his tool, the centre from which he controlled the masses in his mind. Right now he formed it, willing to give John just a glimpse of it all. "The world is a complex system full of energy. You can train yourself to see this energy and to use it. You may call it magic or spirits, whatever you like."
When he hears the first bird chirp again, indicating the birth of a new day, he can finally breathe. Sherlock just starts blinking a lot.
"Wait!"
"So, so wait," Lestrade pinched the bridge of his nose to still his spinning head. "Does that mean that this man, this
"And isn't that going to be … you know? A problem? With him believing me when he thinks you got abducted?"
John wanted to feel bitter about being once more the fool with the littlest knowledge of them all, but he saw Sherlock's face then, saw the anger and the frustration over not having read the dark haired woman's true nature. No doubt he concluded that his mistake had led to John's capturing. The detective whirled around to take a look at everyone and raise his voice,
"Something the matter?"
"Should you not ask me what I want to drink?"
The back of Sherlock's tailcoat followed every movement dramatically.
"Bother?" John quirked a brow, and Sherlock gave him a look.
John sighs too, but his sounds a lot more worried rather than frustrated. "What's the matter, honey? Still feeling weird?"
"Janine," he said to the silence.
Walking through the hallway again (dressed this time) he saw how Sherlock flung his coat above his head and around his shoulders like he had just set his wings back to his body. He glanced over at John and furrowed his brows for a moment. "Hm. A bit crinkly, but roughly acceptable."
"Hush now, lie down. You need rest."
" Sherlock exclaimed once he realised what he had said. He cleared his throat, now also taking a seat. "The stage is yours..."
"Make yourself at home," he said.
He would
"Tell me."
"Oh yes, lively, this one."
Not having read the papers in ages, he was on the verge of dismissing the thought. But the title page caught his attention with a headline in big bold letters.
) hand and frowned at it, raising his head from it to look at the hand print, and then back at his hand a couple of times. After some time John came to notice Sherlock’s eyes on him, and how the detective was simultaneously amazed and bewildered by what he was doing.
John took a deep breath, pondering his options. He could insist on it, remind Sherlock of how distraught he was when he thought she was dead, how he composed only sad music and didn’t eat. How he found nothing worthy of his time or attention. Sherlock would be upset that he is persisting this, and would surely give up this ludicrous idea of playing with (
Sherlock shook his head, frowning and looking down, as if trying to choose his words carefully. He finally said, ‘‘Nothing about you is tough to deal with, John’’
His voice turned small. ‘‘You can spank me, but I don’t want you to really be upset with me. Not even in a scene’’
His brother was kneeling, looking at Sherlock calmly and reassuringly ‘‘Little Brother’’ He said, smiling ‘‘Remember Redbeard’’
221 B BAKER STREET
John nodded back, but he didn’t feel any better. ‘‘I don’t feel any better’’
Which earned her a giggle from John.
John carried him to his room like he weighted nothing, nibbling at his neck and whispering praises. ‘‘Beautiful’’, he said ‘‘my beautiful, perfect man’’. He placed Sherlock in his bed and started to remove his clothes, and Sherlock would have helped or even started to take off his own if he weren’t so transfixed by the scene before him.
-You were hurt. I was hurt. He separated us.
‘‘Did I tell you to strip?’’ John said, staring at Sherlock’s purple pants, the contrast between it and Sherlock’s beautiful skin. He moved closer to Sherlock letting his eyes wander, ‘‘I want to lick every inch of you’’
‘‘John… I’m-’’ Sherlock had started, still holding the blowtorch, but John interrupted him by locking his eyes to Sherlock’s, the warning implicit, and removing the object from his hands.
‘‘So that I can close myself of and… not feel’’
John was tired of who he was.
Sherlock’s face turned eager, ‘‘I do’’, he turned around and walked over to John in all-fours.
She smiled, and there was a hint of pity in her face. ‘‘Dad really did you dirty, didn’t he?’’
This year, though, John was
John rolled his eyes, ‘‘I loved him as a friend and respected him as my superior, but I’m not
I was really upset with season 4, and this was the way I found to feel better, so thank you for indulging me :D
John sighed, the weight on his shoulders softening greatly, all thanks to the beautiful man who was kneeling beside him. He bent down to kiss the tip of Sherlock’s nose, trying to show how grateful he was.
‘‘How- How lon-’’ Sherlock was nearly completely out of it, John noted with pride. The words sounded pained and desperate.
‘‘What’s wrong?’’ He said, crossing his legs and taking one of Sherlock’s hands in his.
‘‘I would like to do that at least twice a day, from now on’’ Sherlock mumbled, raising his fingers to trace John’s scar.
‘‘Stop’’ John said, placing an index finger on Sherlock’s forehead. He had a private smile on his lips, laugher lines around his eyes, and Sherlock’s mind really did stop. ‘‘I just came to bring you some water. And, hum, well… ask you what you wanna have for lunch?’’
John swallowed, wiping Sherlock’s tears with his thumbs ‘‘Who… who is Rosie?’’ he asked, his voice small as if he were afraid to upset Sherlock any further.
‘‘My mind is much clearer than it was yesterday. I think being away from the flat helped’’
Sherlock looked at his brother and nodded, inhaling deeply ‘‘I think so’’
Sherlock made a show out of deducing the culprit, making it seem like the case was harder than it really was. John said ‘‘Amazing’’ with a warm smile when Sherlock was done, and Sherlock hid his blush with the collars of his coat.
But the life they led meant danger, and Sherlock’s actions, despite being fueled by love, caused her a level of pain that no even she could have predicted. She had to separate herself from John for two years. Her body knew that it wanted to go back to baker Street despite her mind’s objections, which was infuriating for a woman who had a mission to fulfill. And in all her pain, she managed to forget what John might feel. Sure, she knew that she would grieve, but she ignored – or perhaps miscalculated – how much.
John sighed, swaying in front of the sink of Harry’s too small kitchen. Truth be told, he didn’t even know how he’d end up in Harry’s house. ‘‘I don't know why I’m here’’
John frowned, placing his hand on Sherlock’s thigh before guiding the car to the side of the road an into a stop and looking at said detective. ‘‘Sherlock Holmes, you listen to me. I would never in my right mind not want you in my life. Do you understand?’’
John growled – he literally growled – and bent down to lick a wide strip along Sherlock’s cock. It tasted like honey too. It was long and pink and beautiful and it tasted like honey. John had officially lost his mind. But it was okay, because by the sounds of it, Sherlock was right there with him in the land of the crazy.
‘‘I like this plan’’ He said, right against Sherlock’s lips ‘‘I really do, but I think I have a better one’’
John should have expected this. He should have never exposed Sherlock to that darkness. His feet took him through the suburbs, half aware of where he was going, half aware of the numbers he was typing on his phone. He must have called Sherlock over 60 times by now. John started to wonder if it was time to call the police (or Mycroft and his omnipotent cameras) when he suddenly saw Sherlock, his pale skin contrasting with the lights around him.
Sherlock shook his head, but smiled, ‘‘You want to kiss me’’
‘‘I didn’t know you’d married Dr. Watson’’
John took a deep breath ‘‘We only properly celebrated when dad got a promotion and invited some friends over for a party. I was… seven, I think. Before and after that, neither of my parents ever felt the Christmas spirit’’ John paused, looking thoughtful ‘‘Except when I was 10 and Harry 15. We decided to surprise mom, so we made the food, put up fairy lights, the whole deal. It took us our year savings to do that, since we didn’t ask father for help. Mom couldn’t leave the hospital, but the doctor allowed it for only that day and… I think she was genuinely happy’’ John smiled ‘‘She smiled throughout the evening, which is more than I’ve ever seen her smile’’
John shrugged, ‘‘Well, yeah. But it’s tough do deal with, anyway’’
-If you want me to be – John whispered, kissing Sherlock’s ear and running her nose down her neck. The detective, predictably, was reduced to a blushing puddle of gasps – You smell like honey, baby bee.
nightmare, so that you would stop thinking about leaving.’’
At John’s lack of words Sherlock went down again, hot breath against John’s erection, mouthing along its line. John chocked back a moan.
‘‘All of our friends will be having so much fun, talking about the weather all night long’’ Alice said in the same dead tone.
The loud ring of his cellphone startled him from his discovery. His fingers trembled as he pressed the keys.
Getting out of his mind palace was as easy as opening his eyes. He was suddenly back at the fancy room, and Sherlock – after going for the door and finding it locked - used the boost of courage that his brother provided to deduce every single inch of it. The space around Sherlock had been cleaned to perfection. The rug bellow his bed brushed to erase any trace of footprint. There were pictures in frames all around, on top of the nightstand and other wooden furniture, all of him in different ages. John had been cut off from some of them.
and, in that scenario, taking John’s name. He had
Sherlock nodded awkwardly, his face brushing up and down John’s thigh, and John accidently tugged his hair a little at how good it felt. Sherlock must have noticed his effect on John, because he did it again, more purposefully this time, right over John’s crotch.
Harry pretended to be offended, and John left casting a smile at Sherlock. When he and Harry were alone, they stared at each other for a few seconds, trying to determine who would speak first. It was Sherlock who caved.
‘‘Hm?’’
‘‘What about Rosie?’’ Sherlock whispered, blinking hard to disperse the blurriness from his eyes.
‘‘John?’’
‘‘No, Sherlock’’ He sighed, rubbing his face ‘‘Irene’s password wasn’t my birthday. Why would it be?’’ He looked at Sherlock, who had already turned his attention back to his microscope. He was dressed today, for a change, which John considered a blessing. The sheets were going to be the death of him and Mrs. Hudson (though for different reasons). ‘‘I could just tell you the pas-’’
John couldn’t help but laugh against Sherlock’s mouth. ‘‘You get the trousers and I’ll get the shirt’’
John tugged on his curls, "For you to be alive"
The bell kept ringing in an endless loop, and Sherlock placed both hands against his ears to make it stop, and eventually it did. He opened his eyes, confused, before John’s muffled voice made him look outside again.
‘‘You’re like an angel’’ John babbled, and Sherlock looked down at him, ‘‘A filthy, perfect, little sex angel’’
‘‘Okay...’’
John shrugged and drank, but his mind was focused on the detective, ‘‘So you want to have a relationship’’
‘‘Don’t you too have plates here’’ Robert asked, looking amused.
Just thinking about Mary made John’s spirit fall. He tried to get that good buzz feeling again. John eyed the struggling buttons of Sherlock’s shirt.
Harry was silent for a while, ‘‘Okay’’
‘‘Okay’’ John ignored the small rush along his spine at hearing the words. He squeezed Sherlock’s hand before letting go. ‘‘Let’s take a look at these, then, shall we?’’
John hunched over Sherlock to read its description ‘‘
She was quite the legend. Making it back from a suicide mission by figuring out the real location of the enemy, she had then outranked her previous officer that had despised her for no other reason than being a woman. John's excitement over her being a general now and him having the privilege of meeting her was unfortunately dimmed by the circumstances.
Kate seemed to hesitate for a second, lingering with the thought of protest, but eventually she left the room and shut the door behind her. Irene walked slowly towards him and the smirk around her lips only broadened. "You must be truly magical then, if our good James thinks you can do better than the other pack who all tried to
"What? Spying on criminals, killing witches?" He chuckled, then took one more sip. "No, I don't think so. Real people have ... other real people in their lives. With less magic involved."
"I heard the cab you took here," he explained, apparently reading his mind. "There are nearly no more hansom cabs that would come to a halt just by my front door, and by the time the horse's hooves were slowing down, I knew it could only be you. I went down to open the front door, so you would not draw too much attention visiting this address in particular, dashed back up to start the kettle and had almost exactly enough time left to finish my interpretation of Wagner's Bridal Chorus until you arrived."
The smile turned into an unfavourable grin with every bit of kindness lacking to support any authenticity behind it.
"Smoke bombs," he whispered under his breath before only the seconds later the thick smoke clouds were billowing out, quickly climbing up the walls and spreading across the whole alley.
And Sherlock sobs.
"You see this? The Van Buren Supernova. Ever heard of it? A natural phenomenon of an exploding star, appeared only a few decades ago."
John gaped at her, very much at a loss for words. He thought he had just been taught an important lesson.
"Is it true?!"
Now Molly had left, but Sherlock only saw John. His glass was almost emptied, his smile more tense. He could read how the conversation between him and the lady had gone, but he wanted to hear it from his mouth.
alone!) grabs both of his thighs with such a determination that he could get bruises from it, covering his skin with open-mouthed kisses and starts licking closer to the area that would really be in need of a doctor very soon.
He pulled himself closer and their bodies pressed against each other. John had trouble not to gasp out loud, but tightened the grip around his waist. Sherlock's lips brushed his ear as he whispered, "Dip me."
It took a lot out of his opponent to stay calm. He pressed his lips together, closed and opened his eyes once more. "My name is under strict concealment. I couldn't possibly tell you, even if I wanted to."
Dark, blood-shot eyes, white, wounded skin, digging teeth. In front of him, right in front of him. His heart choked on the shock, his legs lost ground, being pulled down in the dirt so suddenly, with such strength. No escape.
Lestrade was calling, and by that, interrupting. John pressed his lips together, then walked to step into the room in which Lestrade and Donovan were waiting for them. But Sherlock grabbed him by his sleeve and made him turn around again to watch his pink pair of lips mouth the word, "Later."
But what was that odd feeling that was springing back to life and flickering like a relit candle? Could it be hope? A sense to be finally, fortunately arriving somewhere he could belong.
John's heart skipped a beat when the man stepped even closer, driving him back to the other end of the room. With his hands still behind his back, he eyed him from head to toe and started circling him as if the air around John was his orbit and he the earth to John's burning sun. John clenched his fists and sniffed. His instincts warned him of the threat he could be tempted to fight. Of this person looming over him and shifting his weight playfully from the one to the other foot as he was wandering around.
Anthea just looked at him with raised brows, internally rolling her eyes at him, and pointed at the ceiling. Following the hint, John noticed another glass sign right above his head.
"Oh, are we expecting a visitor?"
"Some criminals like to tell a story with the crimes they commit. Sometimes mythology happens to play a part in that, would you believe it?"
And once again Sherlock thinks that Mary doesn't realise how lucky she is.
Sherlock thinks he must have misheard. That it might be possible that this wasn't, maybe, maybe it wasn't John's voice which has just spoken to him out of the dark. But he knows that it was, oh, out of thousands, millions of various voices, John's - and he is more than positive of that - he would always recognise.
John's answer is a sweet, slightly predatory grin. "I'm a soldier. I'm sure I can think of something."
John sighed, then took a deep breath as he thought back while his fingers found the injured skin beneath his collar. "The witch."
"What happened?" he asked, meaning the husband and not at all the sparkling in her eyes that hinted at a trail of danger within.
"How do we communicate?"
He took a deep breath and found that the odour of the garment also mixed with the finest hint of his own sweat. The impact of both their smells combined like that, the fact that he was wearing his gown and lying in his bed all hit him at once, making him feel a little lightheaded. John knew it was not good to think of another man like that.  Although he tried to remind himself that Sherlock was not even that, a man, and that his body had to right behave like this, it did not change how his heart beat faster and his mouth went dry, sometimes leaving him to spit out his nervousness in the form of unarticulate words and phrases when they were close. He had sworn once that something like this would never happen to him again, that it was too foolish and too dangerous, but well. Here he was.
"There's really no need." The corners of his mouth twitched to form a smile.
"Shush." One corner of Sherlock's mouth gave a twitch before he forced his attention elsewhere.
Sherlock was frowning at Anderson, who immediately raised his hands in defence. John was looking at Wiggins. But he would not say a word, and neither would John.
"For what happened back at Wellington Barracks."
He noticed how wide Sherlock's eyes had become once he looked up in shock over his volume. "Would you," he looked around, "keep your voice down a bit?" Despite the still lingering fear of being overheard a grin stole itself on John’s face.
"Sherlock!" John tried to get through to him before the ceiling could fall in on him.
Suddenly, everything was happening too fast. He hurried towards him, cupping his face, urging him with his eyes to look at him. He needed to get him through this now. It was just like falling asleep, he told himself. If he lost him to the trance, he would be gone. Only not just for a night. For ever.
"No, it's- it is all right. I only thought … should you not be up there playing?" John made a rough gesture towards the general direction of the stage, but she already shook her head.
"I love you."
Mrs Hudson burst into the room like the lively woman that she was. Eager to get her answer, she looked around the living room, hurrying on her little heels. At seeing John sitting on the table as though nothing had ever happened, her face lit with relief.
The noises in the kitchen did not stop, and Sherlock was crying out his response over the whistling of the kettle.
The topic changed as quickly as Sherlock's temper. The mask was back and carefully placed on the handsome features of his face, straightening him.
Sherlock nodded.
? I don't
He shakes his head in disbelieve. "What? Why would you say that? You didn't do anything-"
"Knight and doctor, yes."
Skipping the part where he would draw a stupid moustache on his face and put on a bowtie, right up to the moment of
"Yeah, well, great minds think alike you know. Right, listen up, I think I have a plan."
Why? Why did Sherlock trust him with this? He was an alpha, he was just as susceptible to an omega in heat as any poor bastard on the street. Why had he persuaded himself and his friend that this was okay? That he could handle it? This was such a bad idea! Before he could type an answer, the door opened and that sweet smell wiped away his fears.
There was a send of urgency to their movements; John’s rough thrusts and Sherlock’s eager rocking. There was a lingering reminder in the depths of John’s mind, reminding him that this was to help Sherlock through the ‘misfortune that is omega biology’. But there was a lingering hope, for talks when the plague of aestus no longer tormented the usually composed detective. Talk of what this could mean for them, for their future. But, they had to reach that point.
It was the scent gland.
habits under John's care. But keeping hands-off was not in Mycroft's wheelhouse, not with this. "I do trust all precautions were taken, with you being a doctor. We wouldn't want any... lingering after effects of the experience." He kept his tone level and professional, but his eyes glinted as the alpha appeared to tense at the insinuation.
“Sherlock, I’m not going anywhere.” He soothed, his fingers brushing past the man’s prostate to encourage him to relax. “I promise, I’m not leaving you. God, I’d be an idiot to do so.” Leaning to kiss those pretty lips again, merely a peck, then trailed kisses down and
Really, the fact Sherlock was suggesting something so risky should be a telling factor in just how little the man was thinking. If he was quite honest, the thought of testing his resolve to such a degree did worry the doctor a fair amount; especially when every single movement had begun to feel like it was underwater, his head being the most waterlogged of all. But, he reasoned with himself, so long as he stayed in his chair he shouldn't be tempted, right? John took a deep breath, reminding himself that Sherlock could need a doctor close by if this heat provide complications. He could call for help should the omega need it. With that, he rapidly sent his reply.
John choked on a gasp almost immediately and his body lurched to his feet without permission, his eyes narrowed down at the door that should have been shut.
"Christ, Sherlock, I would be fine. I'll find a hotel or something, but I have some groceries here that I'll need to drop off."
if he didn’t think the brunette was gorgeous. Hands roughened by years of labour wrapped around pale thighs and tugged, yanking the lanky man beneath him ever closer and drawing a gasp from bruised lips.
"Sherlock, you and I both know that you wouldn't send me out on a case without you. You make it known I'm an idiot almost daily, that I don't think on the same level as you. Why aren't you coming with me?"
Sherlock's footsteps were slower now, a little more sluggish. His left foot was dragging, almost forming a limp but not quite. John could hear the drag of fingers against the wallpaper, could hear the soft puffs of breath from the brunets nostrils as though the short walk was much more effort than it should be. He was hyperaware of the way the other man hesitated as he neared his bedroom door, lingering with his hands now bracing against the wooden doorframe for support. The eyes scorching into the back of his head shouldn't have brought such a flame to the pit of John's gut. He must have made a sound, a grunt as he shifted in his chair to cross one leg over the other, because the way Sherlock's breath caught in his throat seemed to have a direct line to the fire building within.
.” There was the sound of a cap popping and Sherlock glanced over his shoulder, biting back the keen in the back of his throat as he caught sight of John smearing lubricant over his erection. John was staring at him with dark eyes, his upper lip curling with a silent snarl as his hand worked over his cock. The sight was far more arousing than Sherlock could have ever imagined.
A moan came from the body beneath him and the heat around his cock spasmed, drawing a surprised gasp from the alpha as his head rolled forward. His mouth fell open as he fought the urge to buck into the tightness around him, his breathing ragged as he tried to listen for Sherlock’s reply.
“Alright, Sherlock,” John murmured, leaning over the man’s thin frame so he could kiss him with gentle assurance. His middle finger joined the first, rubbing against the contracting muscles and gently scissoring. To distract from potential discomfort, John’s lips dropped down to Sherlock’s chest, honing in on the man’s dusty coloured nipples. His eyes never left Sherlock’s face, calculating as his tongue encircled a pert bud and his lips formed a seal around it. He suckled, the omega arched into the sensation with a startled sounding
"Wait, you've not gone into heat while I've been living with you? I've been living with you for three years now, Sherlock. How have you not gone into heat?" Already John had an inkling, one that reminded him of Mycroft Holmes' commentary about certain habits the younger Holmes had picked up. "Suppressants? I'm going to guess not the good ones if you haven't gotten hold of any straight away."
"John," the man sighed, running a delicate hand over the hairless skin of his chest and over the expanse of his throat. "Please."
"Don't be insulting." Sherlock growled, though it was as though the venom had been sapped from his voice and replaced with velvet. The omega moved on his bed, just out of John's vision, and uttered a whine as he stretched. "You think I'd entertain the idea of you being here during this if I didn't want this? Want you?"
"My brother visited this morning, now Lestrade is asking to meet for drinks. You
Lestrade trying to contact you!?”
"How the bloody hell did you know that?"
, “- you don’t really...-“
"Of course we did, what kind of man do you think I am?" John growled, bristling in his seat despite the calming look Sherlock was trying to throw at him. God, he wanted to ask the man to leave, but he knew it was an overraction. But it was the principle of the thing! He'd kept Sherlock safe for years! Well, safe-ish. He'd helped him past some of his worst habits, habits even Mycroft himself hadn't been able to break. Surely he didn't think that suddenly John was going to turn into a rabid alpha, bound and determined to never allow Sherlock out of his sight? Not that cases like that weren't unheard of. "Every precaution was taken. I'm still here, I haven't been kicked out. Nothing has changed that isn't for the better, I'd like to think I can say that for the both of us."
idea what you do to me, Sherlock.” John growled softly, the sound deep and rumbly from within his chest. “Absolutely
Their footsteps fell in sync as they ran to the door, John a step behind Sherlock until suddenly he wasn't. It only took Sherlock a second to realise that his husband wasn't behind him, that the door suddenly was being slammed between them and the heavy bolted lock had been slammed into place.
In all of John's life he had never encountered an omega's scent in the midst of heat. He had envisioned it to be much sweeter than this, almost sickly; candy apples and caramel. But instead he was met with the faint smell of honey and the freshness of an autumn breeze. It was pleasant, something that John would have gulped in greedily if he didn't know the true origin of its source. He had to remember that this was Sherlock, who was trusting him enough to test if he could stand being in the flat. And during the first heat he was experiencing after two decades too! Finally he pulled his head from his hands and reached for his phone, deciding that would be the best way to contact the man presumably locked in his bedroom.
"Out of the question!"
The door closed with a click and there was the slide of the latch. John scrambled for his phone.
"Ready to run?" Sherlock murmured, trying to stop his body from giving in to quivers. In all his life he had faced death head on, but now he had John and Rosie. He had to survive this... They both did.
). Both heat and rut bring out a base desire to breed in an alpha and omega, naturally allowing partners to find each other. Unfortunately it is these desires which mean that many omegas come into hospitals in droves covered in injuries while they writhe with the sickly need for an alpha. John had seen it briefly in training, but due to his own classification he was unable to work with omegas during this time.
Sherlock didn’t respond at first, breaking their eye contact in favour of grimacing at the mess on the sheets. He clumsily shifted, nudging John back so he could clear the sheets just enough for the pair to collapse together. “My sheets are ruined.”
"The case can bloody wait!"
"People are going to die, Sherlock! We have to try!"
Both men were perfectly aware that he would have come much sooner, that is if Sherlock hadn't threatened to booby trap the flat door. In all probability it was an empty threat, as he likely hadn't been in any decent state during the week prior to do any such thing. All the same, he occasionally flicked his eyes to his surroundings, in the event of any threat entering the premises to disturb them. That is, any further threat than the alpha that had chosen that moment to come and stand in the kitchen doorway. Still, the true reasoning for his visit was of a much more sensitive a subject than the potential traps Sherlock had left, his eyes narrowing slightly towards John Watson at the very thought. Mycroft pursed his lips and turned his attention back to Sherlock who had yet to turn around, extending the small bag in his hand expectantly.
not trusted? "I don't see how it is any of your concern. But, if you haven't noticed with that all-seeing eye of yours, Sherlock is safe, happy, and survived an unexpected heat completely unscathed. That's all you need to know, right? Are we done here?"
"What the fuck? You know how bloody dangerous that is?!"
How had it come to this?
"Get out of here, Sherlock! While you've got the chance. I... I've got to try and do something!" John swallowed thickly, his Adams apple bobbing as he fought the tears threatening to rise. He couldn't allow the people above to die, not without doing everything.
As always, thank you for the subs, kudos, comments and bookmarks as well as every single read! I hope you guys will continue to enjoy The Demons Beneath Our Feet!
-,” he paused, the sound of a vibration catching him off guard. “Is that your phone?”
" He said through a sigh, using his free hand to pinch the bridge of his nose. The sheer ridiculous of it all caused disdain to stain his voice, eliciting a huff of arrogance from his flatmate. "Care to explain why?"
“Christ, you’re so… so gorgeous,” the words fell from his lips unbidden, a single finger circling the man’s entrance and collecting the next little gush of slick. “And you’re here, with me.” Finally, he slipped in his index finger to the knuckle, shuddering at the tight muscles fluttering around the foreign entry. He could relish in Sherlock’s sounds forever, the little grunts and whimpers he failed to stop, but this was as much about helping his friend than mutual relief. That is what he’d stayed for in the first place, wasn’t it?
"Sherlock, Sh-Sherlock," John wheezed as their attackers fled. His heart was pounding, his mind racing as he looked to the adjoining stairwell leading to the basement. "Sherlock, the bomb-."
, the unspoken plea hung in the air,
There was silence for a moment, this singular moment drawing out and feeling like an eternity. Time slowed, the only thing existing being John's heart rate (when had it suddenly kicked up a notch?) and Sherlock's steady breathing, before the life returned to the colourless streets of London and the reply came.
The Government Official gave a haughty sniff and straightened his posture, turning his head just enough so that he could glance over his shoulder at Sherlock quizically. How ones opinion could change if enough time was given. In his mind's eye he could still see a sixteen year old boy, all wild curls and big curious eyes, vowing that he would never succumb to biology's cruel nature. He could still hear Sherlock's frustrated shouting, could still see the thick tears rolling down flushed cheeks as heat took its hold. Blinking away the memory, he realised Sherlock was talking and tightened his jaw.
There was a grim look of determination in his eyes, dark in the dim light. John's lips were pressed together firmly, his mind set on his task even as Sherlock pounded on the bolted door and shouted his name.
John heard Sherlock's voice hitch, then his throat be cleared as though to cover for it. Something curled in his stomach, his brows knitting together as he leaned against the wall outside of the local Tesco. The anger that had started to bubble simmered and then faded, well placed concern taking over as he mumbled an apology into the receiver.
"The suppressants you requested."
Well, the fact Sherlock was speaking in full sentences showed some kind of clarity. John could take relief in that, though not in the way his thoughts were becoming clouded. He wanted to claim, to see Sherlock through his heat and he knew deep down in his heart he wouldn't want the man for only this heat. This was his best friend, the only man he'd ever cared for to such a degree. One may even argue it was love.
"Talking? That's not so bad, Sherlock. They have to communicate to keep an eye on you after all-" John paused at the look Sherlock shot him and horror slowly began to dawn on his face as the penny dropped. "Good God, they aren't... you know-?"
“Sherlock! Why is Mycroft
Sherlock's been feeling rough; Greg and Mycroft suffer a rough beginning.
From behind Mycroft's head, Sherlock gave the irritated blond a faint smile and shook his head. In a conspiratorial tone he raised his voice, "you know I would have been dealing with the situation myself if there was any issue to be had."
. In Afghanistan he had learned
, “-Christ.”
Mycroft pursed his lips, conceding the point. It was quite an alarming circumstance, but whatever he said to the contrary, his brother was far from stupid and careless. He just had to make sure they had thought through this, what the consequences could be should they be careless or reckless in this affection of theirs. His eyebrow rose just slightly as his brother mentioned ‘unplanned heats’, the further explanation that there could potentially be more ‘planned heats’ in the future plainly obvious. Sherlock had always been far more driven by emotion, but that could very well be his undoing. Mycroft could not pull his brother out of the gutter again, watch him flatline from an overdose, should his beloved doctor abandon him. But from the alpha’s attitude, he could tell the man was quite serious, quite committed for the moment. Well, what was one to do? With a sigh, Mycroft stood as he was directed, leveling a serious look at John that could be interpreted as a warning should he wish to; smoothing out his suit jacket, he sighed and turned to the door to leave. “You’ll be hearing from me fairly soon, I expect."
The brunette couldn't help but chuckle at John's complaints, rolling his eyes and daring to lean and press a kiss to his temple to calm him. He watched the man's expression shift and change, smirking as he rose back onto his feet and went to take a seat in his chair. "I believe that is the closest you will have to his utter approval, John. It would be wise to do yourself a favour and not try to seek any further validation from him."
Have a great day!
I'm so sorry for the slow update! Things have been rather tough but are starting to improve now. I'm hoping the next chapter wont take as long to write!
. A grunt followed, then the order was obeyed; Sherlock’s giving a puff of effort as he settled amongst the blankets and raised his hips in invitation. Spreading his thighs he uttered a low purr in an instinctive gesture, enjoying the sharp inhale of breath behind him.
and the thought didn’t make his stomach twist. No, the very thought caused his cock to twitch guiltlessly.
The question itself was directed to the room as a whole and for the most part no one specifically, though a shapely brow did raise towards the seated alpha in the room.
Despite Sherlock’s silent plea to be claimed, John was present enough in mind to not do anything so permanent. Sure, they may be about to cross any social boundaries previously set between them, but they were far from ready for that kind of commitment. Still, Sherlock’s
use to me. You're as quick as you ever have been." Sherlock glanced into the reflection in the mirror, observing the way John was watching his every move with concern, how Mycroft kept stealing glances towards the alpha with an uncharacteristic nerve. "If you are here to talk, I do suggest you take a seat. I get the distinct impression you have plenty to say in regards to recent... events-"
Before he could step through the door, he turned, finally facing Sherlock fully since he’d arrived. His eyes scanned his brother a last time, but there was something softer about them as he met the detective’s gaze, something that could possibly be a smile tugging at his lips. “Congratulations, brother,” he stated simply and quietly before turning to leave just as quickly as he’d come.
“Sherlock?” John grunted, his tongue feeling heavy in his mouth. Worry shook him from his heated desire, a hand gently rubbing circles into the small of his back. “Sherlock, are you alright?”
John scoffed in disbelief, holding up his hands as though praying to some deity for strength before delivering a proper glare to the infuriating man sat opposite him. After all this time he was
!" Sherlock laughed, shaking his head as he raised a hand to brush the curly locks from his face. "Christ, no. They are
Another momentary silence, Sherlock seeming to be mulling the options over one by one.
Sherlock and John listened out for the front door to click shut downstairs and exchanged a look, Sherlock's one of knowing and John's one of wonder.
As always, thanks for the subs, kudos, bookmarks, comments and reads! Every one is appreciated.
.” Guiltlessly and shamelessly he glanced down, his adam’s apple bobbing as he swallowed back a groan as he saw just how tented the other man’s jeans were.
"We can't get everyone out, John. There's not enough time!" Sherlock hissed, forcing himself into motion though his bruised limbs strained in complaint. "There's no way-."
“Shut up, John.” Sherlock grumbled, lowering his lips to John’s throat and suckling slowly. Delicate fingers trembled as they clasped the bottom of the woolen material that was obscuring his access to John. God, did John know how his scent was driving him crazy? Warm spice and a hint of gunpowder, a scent which only grew more powerful the longer John was exposed to his omega scent.
John tests his resolve.
On the exhale, he reached and pressed his thumb down on the little green phone icon and watched as the screen went to dial. Another inhale, this time the count to two before he raised the phone to his ear and listened to the man on the other line pick up.
"You're looking relatively well yourself, besides the two pounds you have put on since the last time we met." The jab was perhaps rather cruel, but familiarity was the key to persuading Mycroft that Sherlock truly was alright after his heat. With a calm air he strode towards the taller man and snatched the small bag from his outstretched hand, spinning on his heels to place it on the mantle above the fireplace. "Well, at least your connections are of
At this John raised a brow, about to ask a question when his phone began to buzz away on the coffee table. The sound of his ringtone made him jump and he scrambled to see who had texted him, a smile coming to his face that could have quite easily been delight.
supply chain, brother dear. It would do you well to remember that. I do not plan on sharing any unplanned heats, so all is fine." Sherlock walked past his chair and perched on the arm of John's chair, curving a brow in a rather Mycroftian manner that just oozed expectation. "You have fulfilled your duty, you can leave now." He gestured towards the front door to the flat, hearing footsteps that could only belong to Mrs Hudson coming up the steps with the morning tea. "It really is far too early to handle your fussing."
"Sherlock," John whispered, his grip bleaching his knuckles white. "I can't-"
There was a soft sound emitted in reply (Christ, did he just whine?!) and the sound of sheets being shifted about before the reply came.
" There was a pause, the detective clearing his throat once again. "
Sherlock’s hips rolled downward against the glancing touches and a little growl rumbled, not quite as effective as John’s as his cock twitched guiltily against his stomach. But, it was when John looked up into his face did he realise just what an effect he had on the man. Sherlock’s face was flushed, his beautiful curls wild and sticking to his forehead as he shook his head from side to side. His eyes were closed, almost as though he couldn’t stand to watch, but the right one cracked open every now and then and the alpha was taken back by the haze which had clouded his eyes. Those pretty bow lips were parted, no linger able to filter the numerous gasps and sounds that tested John’s restraint to near the breaking point.
‘‘Clothes, John’’ Sherlock mumbled against his mouth, ‘‘Your clothes’’
John’s gaze was nothing but professional as he tried to determine Sherlock’s health state. Whatever he saw must have been troubling, because there was concern behind his kind smile as he returned his eyes to the road.
When Sherlock came back there was no big commotion.
Seven angry sick people, one threat of a lawsuit and three screaming nurses later, John finally emerged from his rooms. He came just in time to rescue Sherlock from a fight with an elderly woman who, in the confusion, slapped John’s face instead of Sherlock’s. The police was called, but John and Sherlock had left before they got there.
sacrifice’’ He smiled, running his hands up and down John’s bicep, and John just kept laughing.
Fact number two (2): In the few times that they were intimate, John didn’t reach orgasm.
John considered his attitude problem, ‘‘Maybe spank you’’
Day 9: Starting a new tradition // 12 days of ficmas 2016
John looked at Sherlock, oblivious to John’s internal monologue, and took a long calming breath. His decision to come to Dartmoor, despite what he had told Sherlock, was more driven by anger than anything else. He wanted to get Sherlock away from all of that, of course, but he also wanted to face their threat once and for all. He was ready to fight and sacrifice all the he was and all that he had.
John became acutely aware of Sherlock’s hands on his knees, pushing his legs further apart. Their friendship had reached a breaking point, a metamorphosis. No longer could it be contained in its fragile cocoon. John showed too much, and Sherlock wanted it. Even if just to satisfy his own curiosity, but he wanted it.
‘‘Last time I saw him he was talking to Robert’’ Alice said, and the Watson siblings froze. They looked at each other for a moment before marching to the living room.
‘‘Goodnight’’ He said, looking at Harry specifically and trying to say
John smiled and pulled Sherlock down for a light peck on the lips.
John closed his eyes for a second too long, looked at Sherlock’s body on top of him like he couldn’t believe he was John’s, and Sherlock rolled his hips again. ‘‘
‘‘My name isn’t Debra’’
‘‘Everything alright?’’ John asked after a couple of minutes. Sherlock nodded, licking his lips and presenting them in a pout for John to kiss, which John did, chuckling ‘‘Sherlock, look at me’’
‘‘Because I need to know what you want and don’t want’’
Sherlock eyed him through the crack of his fingers, ‘‘I don’t know what’s happening to me, John, I can’t... I can’t form thoughts. I feel everything at once. I don’t-’’
The detective felt his bottom lip trembling, but he mustered some self-control to ask ‘‘Isn’t that her name? Your daughter’s name?’’
John nodded back, ‘‘Okay’’ he smiled, raising his hand to trace Sherlock’s fingers, lightly, ‘‘If you are a good boy, I’ll kiss you’’
‘‘Is it here?’’ he whispered, inspecting the area thoroughly. Every patch of skin that was revealed from a button that he opened from Sherlock’s shirt was rewarded with a kiss. He licked at Sherlock’s nipples like they tasted like honey. Which, either John had lost his mind with lust or they actually did.
As if he could read a single word. Might as well have been Greek, written on the pages. Sherlock moved to the kitchen, though the kitchen, and John somehow felt in his bones the sound of his trousers as he walked, of his shirt as he placed teacups and biscuits on a plate. Time was moving in slow motion inside their walls. The air was hot like a star’s collapsing core.
John moaned - he honest to God moaned – at how gentle Sherlock sounded. How truthful. How vulnerable. He moved his hand across Sherlock’s face, into his hair, and started scrubbing, petting, massaging the scalp. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered closed, a blissful expression on his face, and he bent his head down.
It didn’t make it easier. No games of logic could erase that he went to Mycroft for help. That he arranged to get his wife arrested because he couldn’t be sure she wouldn’t try to murder Sherlock again. He could pretend not to want Sherlock, but he couldn’t pretend to forgive Mary. He couldn’t pretend to love her.
John Watson, before the fall, divided his relationship with Sherlock in two different periods: before and after Irene Adler. This was, in high sight, a very innocent way of interpreting things.
John took a deep breath, closing his eyes and taking a step back and away from Sherlock ‘‘Christ’’ he shook his head ‘‘Okay. Let’s hm… let’s take a blood sample, yeah?’’
‘‘A large quantity of this was bought by a Culverton Smith’’ Sherlock murmured, checking all his recent purchases.
‘‘Sherlock’’ John whispered, and it was a question.
‘‘Nghhh’’ Was the vocalization that Sherlock could offer, but he did close his eyes and offer his lips in a pout.
Their mouths crushed in a kiss that was hot, wet and
John thought for a second, ‘‘Because then it means that he doesn’t like Irene Adler’’
Pretend and pretend. It was second nature, at this point. Five years' worth of it. Soon he would get his bachelors and move into postgrad. John Watson, PhD in pretending he didn’t want to fuck Sherlock Holmes.
It sounded like an apology. Fuck, it
‘‘Well, you are. Pretty damn smart, I mean’’
John started pressing kisses all over Sherlock’s face, washing him in praises and affection. They were interrupted when someone cleared their throat.
When they were done, Sherlock laid his head on John’s chest, ear against heart, and was just beginning to drift off when he heard his phone vibrating on the nightstand. The groaned, resigned to see who it was at another time.
Sherlock placed the tea tray on John’s table, kneeling between his legs again. From the corner of his eyes, John thought he could see the detective’s body vibrating.
John watched her for moment, ‘‘What’s the matter?’’
‘‘Yeah, sure’’ Sherlock said, nodding.
‘‘No’’ John wanted to kick himself, ‘‘Don’t apologise. Please’’ He laid on Sherlock’s side, making sure he wasn’t touching him. ‘‘I’m sorry. I went too hard’’
John’s eyebrows raised on their own accord. He looked at Sherlock more fully, something hot settling on his belly that was only partially discomfort. ‘‘Careful’’
) John.
‘‘Why don’t you just ask him’’ one of the women said, chewing a gum with her mouth open and not able to hide the disgust in her features. Sherlock, however, was done being nice to homophobes.
‘‘What are you thinking about?’’ Sherlock slurred in John’s ear, and John smiled.
‘‘Right’’ Sherlock nodded, blinking a bit, lost in thought. ‘‘Right!’’. And he got up and ran to his room.
‘‘And you believed him?’’ John whispered, trying to exclude Robert from their moment. Sherlock stared at him for a while before sighing.
‘‘But look’’ Sherlock played it again ‘‘This isn’t the first time that he has seen these women. Now, I’ve checked, no woman had her face released to the public, only their names, so how could he have seen them?’’
‘‘Is he a famous person?’’
‘‘There are a few faint bruises on her arms and cheeks. Giving the patterns, I would say that her partner used the Hammerlock to bondage her arms’’ John’s face was burning uncomfortably, ‘‘And asphyxiated her by closing her mouth and nose’’ He demonstrated on himself, wanting to die, ‘‘Of course, it’s probably all wrong’’ he coughed out a laugh, finally looking at Sherlock.
John stopped breathing as he read the message exactly 10 times before he accepted that it was Sherlock who’d written those words, and that they were addressed to John. They have never explicitly talked about their feelings for each other, always playing on the edge and never taking the big leap.
very loudly and very badly. All and all, it seemed like the party was going great.
‘‘What did he say to you?’’ John asked in his captain voice, or something as close as he could come to a captain voice with his sore throat.
They decided to have breakfast with Mrs. Hudson, as they didn’t buy anything to eat and their landlady was making something that smelled
Sherlock shook his head, sniffing, before taking a deep breath and saying ‘‘I’m sorry for… for’’ And John interrupted him with a kiss to his nape and a nuzzle to his hair.
The rest of the day went by in a blur after that. Sherlock tried to save away in his mind palace all that related to John’s past: the stories that Harry told to upset her brother, the way he behaved around her and all of the family photos that Sherlock insisted on seeing. John seemed relaxed and happy, and when Harry’s girlfriend (
‘‘You still want too?’’
‘‘My God, Sherlock’’ John moaned. And he pushed himself inside that beautiful mouth, just a little.
‘‘Honestly, John’’ Sherlock got up from his chair, swaying a little. The only obvious sign so far that he was drunk, ‘‘Go marry a woman and have babies and make your homophobic daddy proud’’ And he left, walking into his room and shutting the door with a bang.
He slowed down a bit, after that, looking at both of them, naked, as if unsure what to do. John caressed his thighs with his fingertips, light as a feather, giving him time.
-So… in fact…
‘‘Yes… What about… well… how do you feel about…
an apology.
‘‘Mm?’’ Was his grumpy reply.
Sherlock thought he might pass out, his mind in a blissful chaotic state trying to make sense of everything he was feeling. John’s dexterous fingers were pressing against him, inside of him, as slowly and carefully as he needed them. Sherlock’s hips moved on their own accord, begging for more.
‘‘John’’ Sherlock said. A purposeful and calm sound. The answer.
John was standing by the door as Sherlock put on his coat and scarf, arms crossed over his chest and a smile on his face. ‘‘
) collection of rocks fell on the floor. With a long suffering sigh John knelt, bending to reach bellow the bed, as was greeted by the sight of a wooden box.
‘‘Yes’’ John moaned, trying to wedge his hands to open his zipper without interrupting their procedure.
‘‘You’ll see him yourself in three days’’ Harry answered, her tone and face grim ‘‘He insisted on spending Christmas with us’’
‘‘I HATE YOU, HARRY’’ John yelled back, which startled Sherlock even more. He fell to his side of the bed, giggling. He turned and saw John’s murderous expression, which just made him laugh even harder.
‘‘I’m fine’’
John turned to Lestrade, who had both his eyebrows raised and a hand covering his mouth. John nodded, agreeing. He didn’t really know to what he was agreeing, but he agreed anyway. Lestrade composed himself, and nodded back.
But it was so much easier to believe that he wasn’t enough. So easy to let all his insecurities take over and hide away in his mind palace… to believe that John would be better off with someone like Nile, or anyone else who hasn’t hurt him the way Sherlock has. Images of his ‘suicide’ pop in his mind, how John reacted to it.
‘‘Right’’ John said, placing his hand on Sherlock’s wrist to try and soothe him. A cab pulled in front of them, and just as John was about to enter, Sherlock stopped in front of him.
Sherlock hadn’t been moving, before, but he froze, very obviously, at her words. John felt Sherlock’s eyes scanning his face for a reaction. John looked up at him, and smiled. It must have been a horrible sight, because Sherlock frowned.
‘‘You’ve trusted me with your vulnerability today’' Sherlock said, his voice assured as if he’d been thinking incessantly about how he wanted to fraise it, ‘‘So I want to give you some of mine’’
‘‘Because you never had to please him. I am him. I look exactly like him. I was a soldier, I fought in the war. I am him’’
‘‘I don’t want to go home to Mary’’ John felt like throwing up.
At tear fell from Sherlock’s eye. ‘‘Of course, she will’’ He whispered back, he opened his eyes briefly, then closed them again, ‘‘She already loved her daddy’’
, Sherlock’s mind supplied.
‘‘What don’t you understand?’’
John decided, as he shampooed his hair, that nothing would ruin the nice mood that he and Sherlock were in. The apprehension to be in the same room as his father was still there, but it was only a small part of how he felt. Sherlock was there, he was his, and it had taken them a pretty long time to get there. John put on his beige jumper, the one he knew Sherlock liked best, and went downstairs with a smile on his face. It was only when he reached the kitchen that he realized that something was wrong.
‘‘Yes’’ Sherlock said, crushing their lips together, and John chuckled though the kiss.
He tried to explain to her that everything was being taken care of – and no one died – but only John was able to properly calm her down. Lunch was delicious, of course, and John raised his head in between bites and asked, completely serious ‘‘Oh, by the way guys, I can’t remember which holiday we’re having in a few days… What’s the name again?’’
‘‘That-’’ Sherlock shook his head, taking a few steps back, ‘‘That was horrible, John. That was the most horrible thing I’ve ever heard in my life’’
‘‘It was more than okay’’ John whispered, taking a few steps closer to the bed.
‘‘Okay, hear me out’’ John stepped back and pointed at one of the three stages ‘‘You could go up there and dance on that pole for about 30 minutes. Then, when you’re done, we’ll carry on with your plan’’
‘‘Get the leftovers from Mrs. Hudson’s kitchen’’ Sherlock told John ‘‘I’ll stay with him upstairs’’
Sherlock looked at him for a long moment, his posture slowly relaxing as he believed John’s words. His face was still apprehensive, and John wanted nothing but to kiss him better.
There really was something that he wanted for Christmas. It wasn’t something ambitious as managing to disinfect the kitchen. He looked at John, who appeared to be writing a testament, then he looked at the little girl in front of them. He wondered if John grieved for the child that never existed.
, Sherlock thought. And even though he was unable to say those words out loud, John seemed to have understood.
. Years of pent up emotion and affection prevented them from having any sort of finesse in the act. Sherlock just knew that he needed John to touch him in all the right places, to tug and push and pull and
‘‘Perhaps the methods are rubbish without the experience’’
Sherlock looked breathtakingly beautiful - confused, eager, caring and excited.  He looked like absolute capitulation. His mask of indifference completely abandoned. How people could believe that this man was a sociopath, John didn’t know.
‘‘Honestly. That pole is just… standing there. Waiting to be danced on’’ John said against his ear, and Sherlock wrapped his arms around John’s neck, laughing.
‘‘It’s Mr. Watson, now’’ He said, a cordial smile on his lips. The owner, Mr. Fletcher, raised his eyebrows.
Sherlock sighed ‘‘Poison, dull’’ and was about to hand up.
And John, who was looking for any reason to stay, thanked Mycroft in his mind, even as he scoffed at him as he walked out.
Sherlock had the presence of mind to laugh at him. Which just wouldn’t do.
Sherlock didn’t say a thing as he removed his shoes, made his way to the front of John’s chair, and knelt down, sitting on his bare feet. His head bowed low, his palms on his thighs.
it, you had
John gripped the dumpster, eyes already shut so tightly that his head was starting to hurt. He counted the seconds, reaching 57 before Sherlock exhaled loudly.
‘‘Yes. Quite nasty, but nothing I wasn’t trained for’’
kiss you here?’ Sherlock would have asked if she still possessed the ability to speak. Instead she raised John’s chin softy and bent her head, making sure to worship every inch of John’s torso while she was at it. John, in turn, caressed Sherlock’s hair humming her approval.
The cab had stopped, and John left Sherlock to pay for it. He had just enough presence of mind to see a hurt expression on Sherlock’s face. He went for his room quickly, and decided the patients at A&E needed him five hours earlier.
‘‘No’’
John watched him pout around the filter, waiting until he released the smoke before taking the cigarette and taking a drag himself. He hated it, but this is what he did. If he looked at Sherlock’s hair, he pretended there was something there. If he looked at Sherlock’s neck, he pretended to care where his scarf had gone. If he looked at Sherlock’s lips, he pretended he wanted the cigarette between them.
John shook his head, feeling like he had descended into madness, ‘‘Alright’’
Sherlock’s eyes widened, almost imperceptibly, and he didn’t make a move to take a sip.
‘‘Your hatred cannot change the fact that Sherlock and I were meant for each other, that we will spend the rest of our lives together’’ John said, which made Robert raise his eyebrows, with an arrogant expression. He smirked and silently left, taking his time to go down the stairs and finally closing the door behind him. ‘‘That was easier than I thought’’ John said, turning to look at Sherlock with an amused expression, which made Sherlock giggle.
‘‘Then why?’’
to know’’
‘‘You were right’’ Sherlock whispered ‘‘It’s paralyzing…’’
‘‘I’ve wanted you for so long, too’’ John kept a rhythm to his grinding, aware of the pressure he was placing on Sherlock’s legs, moving down to suck and bite on a nipple.
, he thought to himself,
‘‘Want you to show me a scene’’
Sherlock thought. ‘‘John, ask me so I can say yes’’
‘‘Doctor Watson, where are you going?’’ Mycroft said, effectively making John’s smile slip away.
They stayed in bed after that for a while, kissing until they drifted off and waking up to kiss more, until Mrs. Hudson yelled, asking for their help to make the supper.
he repeated in his mind like a mantra.
‘‘John?’’ Sherlock’s voice was small, like he was on the verge of tears, but John soon came back with a medical kit.
‘‘It was a terrible plan. Either that or I’m a genius’’
‘‘But... I haven’t been good’’
‘‘I love to dance for you’’ Sherlock responded, smiling ‘‘We could make this our Christmas tradition’’
‘‘I can’t help it’’ John whispered, burying his nose on Sherlock’s curls, before something out the window caught his eye ‘‘Sherlock?’’
win – She said emphatically – Because we are together now.
John moved his fingers to take Sherlock’s pulse, and wasn’t surprised to find it elevated. Those were, certainly, things that Sherlock couldn’t control. Couldn’t make his pupils dilate and his pulse elevate just to play the part. Just to pretend to want John.
‘‘I don’t-’’ John stopped and pursed his lips before pressing them against Sherlock’s forehead, keeping them there as he continued ‘‘She wasn’t mine. The baby was David’s, and he named her Elizabeth’’ John pulled back to read Sherlock’s reaction, then kissed his forehead again ‘‘How about we get you out of this tub and into some clothes, yeah?’’
‘‘It’s okay if you don’t want to… kiss me and things like that in front of your dad’’ He said in a quiet voice, his face cast down.
‘‘I do believe that Mycroft is involved in this, somehow, but not willingly. He told the story about Redbeard and this person somehow equated my feelings for Redbeard to the ones I have for you. Maybe they are trying to convince me that a life caring for you is a miserable one, whereas a life feeling nothing at all is better’’
But his sobs were far too loud in that large room. Sherlock didn’t even feel his mind wandering deep into itself, falling until the doors of his mind palace locked themselves shut.
‘‘The game is called ‘deductions’, not ‘questions’. You liked him, but he didn’t return your feelings’’
Lestrade went with them, but in the end it was John who did all the fighting. Mark Wilks, as it turned out, was not as clever as he once had been, trying to take on the most capable of army doctors by himself. Once back at Scotland Yard, it didn’t take long for him to confess, and Lestrade walked out of the interrogation room with a frown.
John felt like he’d been slapped, like his father’s genes were burning him from the inside out.
‘‘H-W-A-T'’
‘‘I’ve told you many times that caring is not an advantage, Little Brother’’ a hand was pressed on Sherlock’s head.
Sherlock blushed a bit and murmured ‘‘Where would you have slept?’’
), but John shook his head, raising his hand slowly to retrieve a small white berry.
And he would never let Sherlock be cold ever again. Just as he knew that, if he ever fell apart, Sherlock would be right there to offer him his heart.
‘‘Of course, it does’’ John murmured, finally pressing his lovely lips against Sherlock’s, convincing the detective of his worth ‘‘You are so loved, Sherlock, just the way you are. Did you know that? Do you know how
‘‘John, look at this’’ Sherlock pointed at the screen, trying not to think about what Lestrade might have said, and backed the video a couple of minutes so that John could see the man answering if he had or not killed the girl.
, Sherlock thought, tears springing freely from his face,
-Can I kiss you here?
‘‘Can I kiss you again tomorrow?’’ John whispered. Sherlock opened his eyes to the adoration in John’s. ‘‘And the day after that… and the day after that…’’ he continued, punctuating every sentence with a kiss to Sherlock’s lips.
‘‘Is that all you got? That’s what the master of manipulation came up with? You’re losing your edge, Robert’’ John sounded tired.
Nothing conclusive came from the blood tests, and they resorted to the secret files kept in the Baskerville database.
‘‘Out with it’’ John said, his tone harsher than he intended, and Sherlock turned to look at him, innocence laced with smugness on his features.
And then it dawned on John. Sherlock wasn’t just inexperienced on sex. He was inexperienced on love, too. On care and affection, on trust and kind honesty. He probably had never been kissed.
The thing with villains, is that is not only the law that they fear. The boogie monster has many faces.
‘‘Its symbolic and literal at the same time. Literal because if we’re going to solve crimes, might as well do it looking very good’’ Sherlock said and John laughed ‘‘And symbolic because… we share the closet… the room, you know? And we-’’
‘‘A text would be bad, right? I should call her’’
John was pulled into a hug. The Watsons were, historically, not huggers. The last Watson that hugged John had been his mother. Right now, he could have sworn he smelt her fruity shampoo. John cleared his throat, because the Watsons weren’t criers, either.
‘‘Jesus Christ’’ John said, a moan and a laugh.
Sherlock let out a breathy and humorless laugh, shaking his head ‘‘John, I almost set your girlfriend on fire, I purposely threw water on that posh woman and, indirectly, slapped you in the face three times’’. John laughed again, but Sherlock continued, very serious ‘‘and, since the cases were the reason you wanted to stay in the first place…’’
‘‘...yes’’
Sherlock sat down back on his feet, looking down, but still smiling lightly.
‘‘Can I make you something?’’ Sherlock whispered, then he cleared his throat, but he didn’t let go of John.
The smoke got caught in John’s throat, because of course if did. John coughed and soon he was overcome in hysterics.
, Sherlock thought as a thrill went through him. He turned to his side, watching John’s blurred movements with his peripheral vision, and was just about to drop his towel when a yell from the living room startled him.
‘‘I love to watch you dance’’ He murmured, pulling Sherlock closer to pinch his arse.
John looked at him, searched his face for any insecurity, before leaning in and stealing Sherlock’s lips in a stronger kiss. He was just as gentle, but it felt like a different kiss entirely. John was skillfully shutting down all of Sherlock’s brain functions, making his toes curl and reducing him to a moaning mess. John’s fingers eased the zipper of Sherlock’s trousers open carefully, and all it took were dexterous fingers teasing through his pants for Sherlock to find his release.
Sherlock was startled by his question. Or, perhaps, he was startled by John’s change of tone, from a friend to a captain. He blinked a few times, opening his mouth to (probably) argue.
Sherlock inhaled deeply, biting his bottom lip before saying, ‘‘Why?’’, very softly.
Sherlock’s cheeks hurt from smiling, his heart was beating fast and his eyes were watering. Is this how being loved feels like? He thought, getting up for a quick shower and to make the wild curls in his head look presentable. He suspected that John loved him after their encounter with Irene Adler, after he offered to sacrifice himself so that Sherlock could live.
‘‘S-H-E-R'’ He said, smirking. ‘‘You knew because you’re a dominant too’’
‘‘I didn’t immediately start taking drugs, after my… near overdose’’ Sherlock said, a big part of him afraid of John’s judgement. The doctor just looked at him, waiting for him to continue ‘‘I only started after you… said that you didn’t want me in your life’’
‘‘Ugh, we
‘‘But I know it was an autistic child’’
‘‘Don’t’’ Sherlock murmured.
‘‘John’’ Sherlock groaned as he kissed down Sherlock’s neck and pulled the hem of Sherlock’s jumper up to be removed. He closed his lips around Sherlock’s nipple, making him moan ‘‘John’’ again and again, a shiver running through him every time his fiancé…
Sherlock felt his heart skip a beat. All of the air left his lung as John got up and walked to stand in front of him, looking down at his lips.
He’d killed his little girl.
(2) Sherlock had crashed John’s last date with a possible next girlfriend and spilled water on her:
John pulled Sherlock’s chin up, gently, and that emotion flourished on his face. He was nervous, fearful, insecure... and then Sherlock mastered his features back to smugness.
‘‘Yes’’ a beat of silence ‘‘But do you?’’
Sherlock took some time to answer, not knowing which of the billion requests on the tip of his tongue to use, but eventually went with a simple ‘‘My head hurts’’
John smiled, caressing Sherlock’s ear, and leant forward to press a kiss on his forehead. Their eyes locked as John pulled away, the air around them was thick with all the words unsaid, all the feelings unaddressed. In the end, it was Sherlock who broke the silence.
‘‘How is it any worse than the other reasons why you choose to have sex?’’ Sherlock sounded petulant, genuinely curious. John wanted, rather insanely, to smooch his cheeks together and kiss his pouting mouth.
‘‘Yes, I think it could work’’
‘‘Now, just from the twenty six, Lestrade came to a conclusion which, even though it wasn’t the right one, was a useful one’’ He pointed at the screen ‘‘
John shook his head, getting up to sway by the sink again, feeling like he was going to be sick at any minute, ‘‘What does he have to do with anything?’’
He raised an eyebrow, ‘‘I’m surprised you don’t know already’’
John pushed in a little, surprised at how easy his precum made it, and Sherlock yelled, jerking back to fuck himself on John’s cock just as he came with a shout.
John chuckled walking towards Sherlock in a jokingly sexy way, and it only served to make Sherlock more flustered. ‘‘Do you…’’ he wiggled his eyebrows ‘‘
‘‘Redbeard was not… my dog?’’ Sherlock asked. Which made Mycroft frown.
By the time John stood by the threshold Sherlock was already up and by the window, her back turned trying not to let her weakness show.  She was wearing her pink silk dressing gown and some sweatpants (John’s sweatpants, to be exact. She stole a bunch of John’s clothes), and she hugged herself to try to master some composure.
‘‘You need to be more careful with burning things, Sherlock’’ he had said with a resigned expression on his face, as if he were used to living with someone who constantly almost set people on fire. Amanda (or whatever her name was) had just slapped John in the face and left the flat forcefully shutting every door she could.
John was infinitely relieved that he went to Harry, now. He could never be sure if Mary’s behaviour was all in his head, or if he was coming up with reasons not to do it. Harry put on a pair of fluffy boots and a dressing gown, taking her keys in her hand.
‘‘What do you need?’’ John’s voice was gentle without him even having a say on the matter. He’d almost added a ‘love’ at the end of his sentence, for Christ's sake. He wasn’t used to seeing Sherlock this... distraught. He knew he felt that way, sometimes, but Sherlock had never allowed anyone to actually see it. It was equal parts fascinating and disconcerting.
‘‘I-’’ John blinked a few times, then he stopped, taking in a huge breath, ‘‘Oh’’
He’d always fantasized that his first kiss with John was going to be hot, demanding, even if undeniably loving. That Sherlock would memorize every inch of John’s body with urgency, and John would respond in kind. Instead, John Watson held his face like he was something precious, kissed his lips like they were a gift bestowed to him. He exorcised Sherlock’s demons like it was nothing, like loving Sherlock was the only certainty he had in his life. Reality was so much sweeter than his dreams.
Sherlock’s jaw set, and he grabbed John’s hand again, ‘‘We’re leaving’’ he announced, and moved quickly enough that John couldn’t hear a reply from the detective inspector, only partially registering the surprised look on the officers’ faces as they passed their desks on the way out.
John had been sitting on the floor in the hallway of the morgue waiting to identify the body of his wife when he turned to Sherlock and said, quietly ‘‘Is it okay if I move back to Baker Street?’’, his face so open and vulnerable that Sherlock had to take a deep breath before nodding and holding John’s hand.
the symbolic side of this present’’. John finished looking through the clothes and shut the closet, looking at Sherlock a bit nervously before pulling him to sit on their bed. He took a deep breath and cleared his throat. ‘‘My gift for you… well. It can be as literal or as symbolic as you want, really. Whatever makes you happy will… make me happy’’ he cleared his throat again ‘‘I’ve been… wanting to ask you this ever since I came back. Ever since that day…’’
to take John name. And to be married. To
Sherlock shook his head, looking down at John fondly ‘‘She’s alive, somewhere. And I never had feelings for Irene Adler’’ There was a beat of silence, but he continued, almost shyly ‘‘Why are you asking me about her?’’
‘‘Who, as it turns out, leaves in Barking Rd’’ He got up and put on his scarf as John picked up the file and ran to tell Lestrade what they’d discovered. Sherlock bit his lip, hope spreading through his chest like fire.
Sherlock stared at him, agape. He tried to look down at his kneeling form, John’s hand on his chin stopping him ‘‘If you can’t tell what I want then you are clearly impaired, John’’
There was a ginger man by the name of Ed Shewan – not to be confused with the ginger musician Ed Sheeran – that had killed his dog and blamed it on his ex-wife. He ran the dog over, using his ex-wife's car, then fixed himself an alibi and everything. The ex-wife, a blond woman by the name of Taylor Mayden (her maiden name) came to Sherlock in need of help.
Sherlock looked at it and felt the dread blind and suffocate him. He was placed on the chair closest to the fire, and handcuffed to it.
The whole thing was absurd, and, despite what might have been expected, John didn’t feel smug about guessing Irene’s password before Sherlock. This disruption of their dynamic was bleeding into other aspects of their lives. Sherlock had been actually doing what he was being told, cleaning when John told him to, storing his samples properly and away from food. It freaked John out so much that he’d stop asking for things altogether.
John shook his head, caught in a whiplash at the change of subject. He thought Sherlock would want to pry open his friendship with James, but no. He drank, ‘‘I mean yeah. She drugged you. It was awful’’, he bit his lip, trying to figure out if Sherlock mentioning her was important. He raised his head, thoughtful, ‘‘You would marry Irene Adler, if she lived here’’
‘‘It’s alright. It’s the Robert effect. Let’s just focus on going home and getting some sleep for now, yeah? I shouldn’t have pressured you’’ John murmured against Sherlock’s hair, to which Sherlock nodded.
‘‘Oh my GOD, did someone die in here?’’ Mrs. Hudson screeched with her impeccable timing. John seemed to have been stung into motion, quickly entering the shower box and effectively ending whatever it was that happened between them. Sherlock grumbled as he put on his clothes, cursing Hudders.
This was that moment when everything fell in their right tracks, when planets aligned and the universe let go of its chaos and confusion. When everything finally made sense. John felt at the brink of something holy, a nirvana which, at last, couldn’t be misattributed to alcohol. Of realizing that the genes of abusive fathers weren’t definitive, that even someone as ordinary as John Watson could worship and be worshiped by a soulmate.
Sherlock laid at the bed for as long as he could, but when he heard the Watson siblings fighting and yelling at each other, he decided it was time to go down and help. Sherlock made his way to the kitchen; where everyone was, and sat down to have his breakfast. Alice was staring at her mug with contempt.
John widened his eyes, speechless.
Ed Shewan had sacrificed his dog for his freedom. John Watson had sacrificed his baby.
‘‘What do we need answers for?’’
‘‘Why?’’
Harry’s smile dropped and her eyes widened, ‘‘Wait, what?’’
John raised it, ‘‘If this is stupid you are allowed to hit me with it’’
It took a desperate message from Lestrade for John to finally remove his head from his arse and go to Scotland Yard to tame an insulting and verging on maniac version of Detective Sherlock Holmes.
… business cards’’ And realization dawned on Sherlock just as a blush came to cover his cheeks.
‘‘They’ve always tried to stick to the traditional event: fairy lights, presents under the tree, Santa is coming, that sort of thing. I believed he was real until I was five, and stopped when Mycroft called me stupid’’
’’ Alice said and Sherlock blushed adorably again.
‘‘What’s wrong, love?’’
John swallowed, ‘‘And it isn’t fair to Mary’’
‘‘Yes’’ Sherlock moaned, letting go of his cheeks to raise his chest, looking at John more fully. He ate up every inch that was revealed to him, actually swallowing and biting his lip when he focused on John’s cock. ‘‘It’s bigger than I imagined’’ he frowned, as if disappointed in his own inability to deduce the exact length of John Watson’s penis.
‘‘Sherlock, you cleaned the flat. I didn’t even think you knew were we keep the broom’’ John smiled, his eyes shining with mirth and what Sherlock could only describe as affection. The detective lowered his head.
‘‘You need to accept that sometimes things won’t go your way’’ Sherlock whispered to himself, splashing some water in his face ‘‘You have no right to be mad and John has given you no reason to be jealous’’
John smiled from ear to ear, wrapping an arm around Sherlock and kissing his cheek, casting a wary eye at the man beside them. ‘‘Hello, love’’ John whispered, and Sherlock, at that moment, thanked all the gods for having such a jealous boyfriend who saw everyone as a threat.
Sherlock,
He got up from his bed, changing from his pajamas to normal clothes and picking up his keys to 221b on his way out. Technically he wasn’t allowed back at Baker Street per Mycroft’s orders, but John was never good at following rules anyway. Besides, John hadn’t seen Sherlock for over 3 months, ever since the Tarmac. He checked his phone one last time before getting in his car, confirming that there were no new messages, and driving away.
’’ Sherlock breathed out, even though he was smiling. Mischief took over Sherlock’s face and John though he was going to be tickled too before Sherlock yelled ‘‘I’m showering first’’ and sprinted to the bathroom.
(See the end of the chapter for
Now, eleven days before Christmas, Sherlock’s army doctor stood under the threshold at Baker Street with a suitcase in his hand and a question written on his face. Sherlock offered him a soft smile and a quiet ‘‘Welcome home’’, which John responded to by biting his lip and looking away.
‘‘You were perfect. Ever since you were a little boy, utterly perfect. I admired your intellect, your wit, your brain’’ Moriarty whispered, nuzzling at Sherlock’s ear, which made the detective sick to his stomach ‘‘I
‘‘You… you-’’ Sherlock frowned, unable to keep himself from looking at John up and down ‘‘You are wearing your uniform’’
‘‘Sounds romantic’’ John smiled, and Mrs. Hudson shook her head in a weak denial, nervously talking about what they planned to do there. She was only interrupted by the phone and Mrs. Turner on the line, which made her leave for the other room.
Sherlock returned quietly. So quietly that John only heard him when he was behind him, breathing down his neck. John dried his hands and turned to look at him, only for his eyes to fall on a neat stack of envelops.
John kept at that for some time, eventually going to the other side of her neck, but soon murmured:
‘‘I mean… London’s economy is horrible after the Brexit, so there’s that’’ John’s hands tightened on the steering wheel.
‘‘I don’t know about you, but I am quite done with you being drugged up’’ John murmured against Sherlock’s neck. The detective was lying on the bed of an ambulance, where some doctors were taking his vitals.
‘‘You, John Watson, are pretty damn smart’’ Sherlock smiled, making John chuckle (again, giggle). The doctor just remained silent for a couple of minutes, so long that he thought that Sherlock was asleep, before having the courage to whisper:
The morning of the 22nd was spent with lazy kisses and love making. Sherlock could become addicted to this, having John on top of him, breathing hard against him as John slowly lost control of his rhythm. Sherlock loved how John said his name at those moments, how he bit Sherlock’s lower lip, how his teeth grazed gently where Sherlock’s neck met his shoulder.
) brought him closer to run his fingers gently through that mop of curls.
On their drive home Sherlock mumbled an apology for ruining John’s date, and John had just said, without turning to look at him, ‘‘You needed me. It’s fine’’ even though he knew Sherlock didn’t need him for such a pathetic case. Not even Sherlock was needed.
John rubbed his face against Sherlock’s clothed erection, mouthing along the line, tipping his tongue into the wet stop right at the front. He got lost on it, completely out of his mind with how arousing just the thought of having Sherlock like this was. Amazed that he could do this. He started to tug on the hem of those ridiculous purple pants, but stopped when he heard a different edge on Sherlock’s moans, felt more force to his tugs.
Regent’s Park was empty safe from a few children playing together. John grabbed Sherlock’s sleeve and indicated a bench with his chin, mentioning them to sit there. Sherlock watched the sky slowly becoming orange and pink from the twilight before John asked for his attention by clearing his throat.
. But wasn’t John Watson the most beautiful woman she had ever seen. They had met only a couple of weeks from that day, when Sherlock interrupted what would have been a marriage proposal, but it still felt like ages ago.
) asked for help to buy Christmas ornaments, he volunteered.
that I’m gonna leave you alone with him’’ John said, which made Sherlock smile and hiss him again.
‘‘I am majorly pissed at you’’ John whispered, his lips against Sherlock’s back ‘‘Very’’ he continued ‘‘A lot… But that’s nothing that a quick explanation wouldn’t solve’’
‘‘Are you?’’ John whispered, unconvinced.
With Sherlock’s permission, he would be doing that indefinitely.
, love. Look at you’’ John moaned, and Sherlock wanted to hear more. He pulled John up and laid him down, straddling him like the day before and rolling his hips against and all around him.
On the other hand, John could give in and do it. Have him.
‘‘I fucking love it’’ John laughed. Shaking his head, ‘‘Always wondered how I would die. Who would have thought it would be from Sherlock Holmes talking dirty to me’’
The smell coming from the dumpster made him retch some more. He had half a heart to jump inside and be done with it.
John blushed, frowning, ‘‘Okay’’
A small part in his brain pondered.
‘‘Yes!’’ Sherlock bellowed, staring at a naked John proudly,
‘‘What? Yeah, yeah, I’m fine’’ He closed box and put it back below the bed, but placed the ‘‘Sherlock Watson’’ card inside his wallet without thinking as he left the room ‘‘I’m going to your place right now, I just had to… pick up a few things’’
‘‘Good to be back’’ He said, his voice thick with an emotion Sherlock was too afraid to decipher. ‘‘I’ll put this upstairs, then, shall I?’’ He said, raising his suitcase before turning around and doing just that.
John laughed, amazed. ‘‘You’re amazing’’ he said, quietly, not looking at Sherlock. ‘‘His name is Adam. He had a tummy ache, and his parents were just yelling at him to be quiet. It was horrible to watch’’. He shook his head.
‘‘I’ll be fine’’ He said with confidence ‘‘Besides, it will only be a minute’’
Sherlock bent down to lick John ear, ‘‘Well deserved, I would say’’ he murmured against it.
Sherlock nodded ‘‘Why would someone go to all the trouble of making me imagine the things I did’’ then he looked at John ‘‘What is your theory?’’
‘‘I don’t like
‘‘The Mark Wilks I knew was blind’’ He said, shaking his head ‘‘We didn’t even consider him a suspect’’
Once they were comfortably tucked in John’s bed there was not much that they could do but cuddle and kiss, since Sherlock was hurt and tired. John was lying on his back and Sherlock on John, and it was perfection. So kiss they did, and it felt like a conversation, an apology and forgiveness.
Sherlock was still looking at the table. He shook his head. He guided John to his chair, never letting go of his hand, then moved around the kitchen to get water for both of them.
That Sunday morning, on the 18th of December, John woke up before the love of his life. They had slept on the same small bed, Sherlock’s face pressed against John’s neck, John’s arms around Sherlock’s body. He carefully pulled back to look at him, his clever detective with his pale white skin, dark curls and rosy lips, angelic in a way that took John’s breath away.  He still couldn’t believe that he could do this: be so close to Sherlock, be able to touch him, kiss him and tell him how much he loved him.
