"Well at least he tells the truth like we tell him to." Steve smiled as they headed downstairs. "I tell Peter how cute he and you are all of the time. Don't I, bubba?"
Steve started to move just a tad quicker, humming out soft moans as he did so. "'m not wantin' to torture ya, babe. Just want to go slow with it." He noised. "D'you not want that? You want something different?"
"Looks okay. A bit nauseous, but that's expected," Tony murmured, picking up his cup, "We're in for a long night, though. Especially if he throws up on the bed."
"Ah, cheer up, Bruce. You get to be in Stevie's story too, don't you worry," Bucky grinned, leaning against the door frame, "I'm guessing mine'll have to do with my arm, right?"
"Leave Steve by offing yourself will doom him and the boys. When a soulmate loses the other to death, the other feels like they are slowly dying too. And it could be
"You're very welcome." Steve said warmly, scooping up another spoonful for him and feeding it to him. "How's your head feeling at the moment?"
"Hon, I'm too conceited to let you damage the goods," Tony laughed, leaning down to smooch Steve's temple, "Everything's alright, baby. I promise."
"Come along as well, babe! Your opinion is definitely requested. You have an acute eye for these things from a different perspective." Raavi explained eagerly, motioning for Tony to sit as he took Steve behind the changing curtain.
Steve raised a slight eyebrow at him in curiosity. "What is it, Tony? Like you said, it is still your birthday. So what would you like?" He asked with a grin.
"See? He thinks you're perfect, too. As a brother and a teether occasionally." Steve joked lightly, smooching Peter's cheeks.
"Oh lord." Steve hummed, eyes raking the body before looking to Natalia. "What is it that you found to call it peculiar?"
He shouted as he came, coating the top of the desk in thick, white stripes. Steve groaned as he felt Tony come, clenching around him as he rode out Tony's orgasm. Didn't take much longer before he came as well, choking out a moan as he did and resting his head along Tony's spine. Tony laid there and panted for a good minute, feeling well and truly fucked.
He quickly put the new band-aid over Peter's IV mark, scooping the boy up and kissing his cheek before going to grab Wade.
"I'm careful." Peter rolled his eyes and got the griddle up onto the counter, setting it up before plugging it in to heat. "You worry t'much, Papa."
"I gotcha, babe..." He breathed, starting slow thrusts. His hands came up to massage Tony's hips softly as he moved. "Just relax for me, huh?"
. It was... Bad. At four I was already building circuit boards from scratch, making mini bots out of my alarm clocks and whatnot. I thought I could make Howard proud, but it just-- backfired."
"Oh my god," Tony rolled his eyes, putting Peter on the floor, "Go wash up, baby bear. Papa bear and I will get breakfast started, okay?"
"Yes," Riley interjected, "I've worked with a surgeon in Wales, and the body was most definitely cut open, not torn."
"That one should probably stay private." Steve said quickly, light pink on the tips of his ears. "Not sure how guests would feel about that, y'know. But all that other stuff sounds good. The house will look good when it’s decorated."
Steve nodded, tugging Tony's boxers down to his ankles. He lubed up his fingers again and moving to slick up his cock with a groan. He lined himself up and pressed in slowly, going in up to the hilt.
"We'll be back in a few hours. Three tops, if we don't fall asleep," He hummed, lacing their fingers together, "You have our numbers--"
"I... I haven't even told you why I am here." Steve said carefully, keeping eyes locked on the other.
"Well, kid, you're definitely sleeping with me, but not for a raise. Are you suggesting I sleep with all them?" Tony hummed, putting his feet up on the desk, "How do you plan on resolving this issue of yours, Steven?"
"Don't cry, Sammy. You'll get ta eats big people foods soon. Jus' not yet." The boy explained, handing the boy his teether again.
He put the stuff in the back of the car, then buckled Peter in, buckling the baby seat next to him before climbing into the driver's side. Steve double-checked everything before climbing into the car and buckling up.
"It won't mess up your teeth. Uncle Buck is just jealous because he has buckteeth," Tony replied, whisking Peter over to his high chair to give him his binky.
"Okay." Steve agreed, cleaning up the plates. "Peter and I can play with DUM-E and do some other things while you work. Does that sound okay with you, Peter?"
"Honey, I can show you the definition of pain." Tony grinned, leaning up to smooch Steve's jaw, "We'll do some pain tomorrow. After you're all rested up. Or tonight."
The baby giggled at the kiss, hands reaching to cover his face and feet kicking a little as Tony changed him, almost like he was bashful.
They stayed that way in sated contentment for a moment more before Tony gave a stretch and moved off of the bed, earning a dismayed noise from Steve.
"You only paid for MIT because mom had to persuade you to, and the only reason I am here is because YOU wanted me to come here and learn Business Management!" Tony yelled. "Why do you think I took the chance of hacking in and changing my major?! Because I didn't want to do that! That's what YOU wanted! That falls absolutely NO WHERE in my lines of interest, and you would know that if you ever paid one shred of attention!".
"We're not, honey, we're both young and chipper," he murmured quietly, rubbing Peter's back, "We're not going anywhere. Promise."
"Hadn't been stretched in a while." Steve pointed out, leaning with the touch with a soft mewl. "'M tryin' to relax, love. Promise."
He kissed the head of his cock before licking a stripe on the vein underneath, easily taking him into his mouth. The blond groaned behind the gag, legs twitching upwards a bit as Tony worked. He snaked his hands up into Tony's hair, stroking it gently in praise.
Steve moaned from the bite and feeling Tony clench down around, coming hard into his lover as his hips continued to twitch forward, riding out the high.
"Mmm, I love you so much." Steve whispered happily as he wrapped himself around Tony sweetly, latching on like a limpet. "My perfect man. So perfect to me."
"You're getting there. Emotion-wise, you have gotten so much better. So don't be embarrassed, baby." The blond purred back, kissing at his neck again and running his hands along Tony's sides.
He gave the blond a look before going upstairs, thoughts swirling in his head. A shiver ran up Steve's spine at the look Tony gave him, trying to keep thoughts away until he had Peter dropped off.
"If you really want to work on it that bad, you can work on it the day after tomorrow." Steve explained, tucking Peter in and kissing his forehead. "Tomorrow, you and I are going out for a father/son day of our own. How'd you like to go to the aquarium?"
Looking around at the place, Steve was right. There were little things here or there, but other than that it looked like it had when the tower had been completed in its remodel.
"I wanna see 'im, too." Peter whispered, getting on his tippy toes to see just enough. "I knew I was gonna have a lil' brotha, but he is
"I didn't exactly have a father figure to learn from myself, either." He murmured with a sigh. "Your's was words I can't say with the baby present and I didn't ever get to meet mine. But I think we do great, considering all that. Especially you."
Tony hummed happily, taking Steve down as far as he could, swallowing and scraping his teeth down his length. He pulled off to take a breath, gently tonguing the slit before kissing the head and taking Steve down again.
"You want to know something that makes this absolutely perfect to me?" He asked softly, earning him a nod from Tony.
He looked up at Steve with a watery smile, happy tears brimming in his eyes. Steve stared back surprised but happy, looking down at the baby.
"Where do you think he learned it from?" Steve stated, amping up the face. It really did upset him that Tony wouldn't tell him enough when it came to the man's wellbeing, so the face was warranted.
"Sorry. I just wanted to be sure." He said quietly, stroking Tony's head gently. "Need me to get you anything or do anything to help out?"
He glanced over the rest of the history just to be safe, sighing in relief when nothing obscene came up.
"Most of them do absolutely nothing," Tony admitted with a laugh, "They're just prototypes for the final machine, that'll have all the coding and shit put into it. Except that weird looking one in that corner. That's the first robot I ever built. His name's Dummy, and he's really friendly. Just stupid."
"I'm sorry, baby." He said gently, kissing the top of Tony's head. "Did I do something to trigger it?" Steve asked with slightly concern in his voice.
"I'm calling him right now," Tony interrupted, reaching for the phone before Steve smacked his hand. He grinned, bringing his legs up.
"Jeez. All this for wanting to kiss you?" Steve said with a pout. "S'not very nice, Mr. Stark-Rogers. Not very nice at all."
"Oh my fucking-- gimmie," Tony snatched them from Steve's hand, gaping as he rolled his fingers over the beads, "Wow, Brucie, you went all out, didn't ya?"
"Your Daddy has a point." Pepper chuckled, ruffling Peter's hair playfully. "Besides, I call you sweetie too, Petey Pie. But Tony, relax and be patient. You're almost worse than a kid when it comes to presents on Christmas." She explained, pouring Tony a mug of the coffee made.
"Shhh, no no no. Boys, it’s okay. It’s okay." Steve tried to calm, taking Peter into a hug while Tony held Sam.
"Almost, Papa and I have to run out and get some supplies," he told the boy, tucking his bangs back, "Aunt Pepper's gonna come and babysit you for a little bit. That okay?"
Tony visibly looked relieved in that, taking a second to hug to redhead before stepping back to Steve.
"I aim to please," he purred, "I tried to pick stuff y'might like. If this is the reaction I get, I'm
"It'll be okay, Peter. Papa's got ya. We'll get you cleaned up and taken care of, all right? It'll be okay."
"Unless you plan on doing this now, I'm going to sleep on the floor," Tony laughed, kissing his nose, "It's not nice to tease those of us that can't resist."
They were interrupted by Steve coming back with four teacups, each steaming hot as he placed the tray on the coffee table.
, there's no point in giving yourself a sore throat," she murmured, sifting her fingers through his hair.
Sighing, Tony put him down, not at all surprised to see the boy quickly gather his math stuff and run off.
Tony sighed happily, leaning back against Steve and letting himself sink into his husband's warmth. "I'm the luckiest man in the world," He murmured, reaching up to rub his eyes, "So fu--frickin' lucky."
Steve came back with a warm bottle, but kept quiet in the doorway as he watched Tony interacting with Sammy.
With a laugh, Tony took Steve's hands and gently kissed each knuckle, then moving to his palms and wrists, the crook of his arms and to his neck, whispering praises over his porcelain skin.
Steve smirked at that, starting to piece the bed together. "Trust me, there are no facets of my life where I am a slowpoke, you. Nor do I choose to rush anything." He hummed, lining up the drill. "Thanks for the boost though, Buck." He chuckled warmly.
"Where is Mr. Stark?!" The eldest looking had questioned. "We need his assistance. It is absolutely awful!"
"I'm still giving him notes. He's not the best at knowing what to do when someone is sick." He murmured after he was off the phone. "He'll be here in ten minutes, okay? Take your aspirin and drink your water before then."
"You may not remember because it was after your talk with your dad, but I said I wanted to talk to you." Steve said matter-of-factly. "Do you remember that?".
"I thought you were younger. You looked like you were, but you can never really be sure. Okay, your turn.".
Steve was halfway through raising his hand before he cleared his throat, setting the hand back in his lap.
"Tonight we'll go back, and I want to collect a few samples of my own," he decided, "I'll have you look at them, maybe try to re-culture the tissues?"
Steve smiled back at Tony, surprised as he looked at the sheets. "Silk? Oh wow..." He hummed, opening them up and putting them onto the bed as he felt them in his fingers. He laid out the comforter onto the bed as Tony came back, smoothing it out.
Of course they did," Tony replied, sucking down his milkshake, "Peter's good for them. Right?" He turned an eye to Steve once the car stopped, immediately unbuckling himself to run up to the front steps and knock on the door.
"Then we can take it out for now and heat it up later. Because it’s already been cooking." The blond chuckled, patting the man's arm. "If it’s too early to eat, then what is it a good time to do, then?"
“That’s odd. U always joins you for bed,” He pondered, “She has been acting a little out of sorts lately, hasn’t she? Even then, she is always with you for bedtime…”
"Let’s get you those saltines, okay? We'll go in the kitchen to eat them then we'll tuck you back in." Steve soothed, carefully carrying the boy downstairs.
"Oh! Um, right now I guess we're just going to talk, and depending on the subject I am going to sketch out your different facial expressions to later decide which ones to use for the project.".
"Mhm, squirt here's never getting paint ever again, but other than that," Tony drawled, "He's been good."
Tony resisted the urge to chuckle at that last statement. The whole experience was something Steve really wanted, and even though he had only known the merman a short time, Tony wanted to give him everything.
"You're such a romantic," Tony laughed, "We could do front silhouettes and put our soul marks on the black in our favorite colors. Put a big letter in the middle of it with a heart on it."
Tony lightly blushed as he looked up at the super soldier, who was wearing a smile that just radiated warmth. Tony cuddled up more in towards Steve's chest, finally feeling a sense of safety and warmth around him. The two stayed like that in comfortable silence for a while. Tony had thought Steve might have fallen asleep, so he broke the silence.
"Much better," He murmured, leaning up to set his raw ass on the cool of the desk, "Sir, if I could, I'd suck you off and let you fuck me over your desk to earn my extra credit."
"S-sir--" Tony dissolved into babbles and groans, whining as he rolled his hips back. "I'll be too busy wondering about your panties, Sir," he breathed, putting his head on the desk and taking a deep breath, "God, Steve, you're so fucking
Tony worked fast, considering Bucky only lived a few blocks down. He made sure lube and condoms were in each nightstand and desk drawer, that the bed was made and the desk clean--
"You'll have to take me to see it, sometime." Steve interrupted, hearing all he needed to love the idea of this house. "It sounds beautiful, Tony. It really does." He grinned, giving him a quick peck on the lips.
"You stay right here." Steve insisted, swatting Tony once lightly with his hand. "That's where you were found. That's why you were sent to the principal. So obviously you were caught."
Tony caught on and thought about it. He gathered a collection in his mind and filtered out memories he didn't feel comfortable sharing with someone he barely knew. Finally he settled on one he was willing to share.
Steve went lax against the desk, panting and toes twitching as he started to fall from his high. He breathed heavily, trying to relax and reaching upwards to grasp at Tony.
Tony melted over Steve, giving himself a moment to come back up before pulling off, flopping down on the bed next to Steve.
Steve scooted back and sat on the floor, laying against the wall as he still watched his boys happily.
"Greedy," Tony scolded lightly, smacking Steve's backside as he walked back to the desk, "Clean yourself up, then you can have fun with me."
responsive. He couldn't help the pride that welled up in his chest from the knowing that he was the reason for Steve here with him like this.
"How's 'bout you stay here. I'll find Papa, den we come and gets you." Peter explained, running off to help Steve fix Tony's present.
“Awe, c’mon Cap. I know you can get hit by two trucks and walk it off no problem. What’s three more gonna do?” Tony teased gently, earning another groan from the other. “In all seriousness though, I don’t blame you for just wanting to lay there unmoving. Your whole physical form shifted species in less than a minute, and last I checked, that is incredibly painful.”
The next morning, Tony was woken up by small scuffling noises from somewhere in the room. He cracked an eye open and fumbled for his glasses, rolling his eyes at the bear raiding his sock drawer.
The boy put his hands up over his eyes, to which Tony felt a little piece of his heart chip. With a sigh, he scooped the boy up, rubbing his back.
"I know honey," Tony apologized, helping Steve in before turning the hot shower on, "Only teasing, buttercup. Sit down, and I'll wash your hair for you."
He pulled Tony close again, running one hand down his side and the other one that was slicked up reaching around and prodding the man's entrance.
Walking into the living room, his jaw tensed at the obviously half-cleaned room, a pang of sympathy for Steve in his chest.
“Steve? Have you seen U? I can’t find her for bed,” Tony said nervously, moving to the side a bit as Dodger— Steve’s Sylveon— walked into the room with them “She isn’t on our floor and she isn’t in the playroom with the others.”
The next two weeks flew by in a whirlwind of doctor's appointments, arrangements, yelling (Clint), shovel threats (Bucky), and a hell of a lot of congratulation cards. With the way things had been before, Tony wasn't sure he'd ever
Tony whimpered and laid himself over Steve's lap, trying to quell the arousal already building in his stomach. He put his head on the bed, clutching at the sheets while he waited with butterflies.
much today." Tony answered with his signature smirk, drying his hands from the dishes. Seeing the blush that crept up the blond's face definitely made it worth it. "But yeah, a movie sounds like a good way to wind down from today. Something light and mind-numbing would be great."
Steve hazily rolled out of bed, off to give whoever was knocking on it a good what-for for waking him up around 3:00 AM. As he opened the door, Steve was surprised when he discovered this specific person at his door.
"Um...." Steve said a bit nervously. "If you think you can handle it, munchkin. But we'll have you do it on the couch, okay? Just in case." He explained.
He carefully started to apply the ointment across Tony's chest, shaking his head softly. "This is going to be so scarred no matter what gets done, but we are still going to help what we can."
As they worked on signing the papers, Steve couldn't help the excited energy buzzing in him. He tried not to cringe when he caught a glimpse at the price (although Tony had tried to hide it from him), but he tried not to worry about it, skimming over the papers carefully before signing. Once the signing was complete, Tony happily took the house keys from Babs, nodding as she rattled off the rest of the liability paper. He thanked her and shook her hand before taking her out to her car, waving as she drove off.
"Otay, I can do dat. I'll teach 'em letters an' numbahs," he rattled off, an excited glint in his eye.
"I know it does, baby, I know the exact feeling," Tony murmured, grabbing the bucket, "Close your eyes, please."
"Speedy there, aren't ya?" Steve chuckled, finishing his breakfast to put away his dishes. He grabbed their coats and made sure Peter was bundled up good before scooping him up again and heading to the car.
Peter nodded and Tony gently bounced the boy on his hip, dancing him around the room while Steve went and got Sammy. Tony smiled at the happy baby, leaning over to kiss his cheek.
“Not to the enemy, no. But they’re our team.” Steve replied curtly “Besides, they might as well be informed since there isn’t really anything we can do about it for at least three months, and we can’t keep it hidden that whole time. There is just no way.”
Steve’s eyebrows twitched upwards, staring Tony square in the eyes then looking at his glasses. He nodded softly in return, moving around on the bed and doing as he was told.
"So, what would you like to do first now that I'm officially yours, Mr. Stark-Rogers?" He whispered playfully, raising a brow.
Satisfied with the answer, Peter nodded, sitting back. "Den why don'tcha feed 'im?" He asked innocently, getting a laugh from the adults.
Tony trudged through the snow, dragging his currently out of order armor behind him. He hoped to find somewhere to shack up soon to get out of this wintery mess, but all that was around were trees. Loads and loads of trees. Tony kept walking along the side of a road he had crashed nearby, but stopped as he saw something that clearly wasn't a tree. It was a person, and not just any person.
"Hey, you were a baby once too, munchkin. And you were no doubt just as gross." Steve chuckled, holding in a louder laugh as Tony snorted in sleep from Peter wiping his hand on the man's shirt.
"We can try to go tomorrow, yeah." Steve said, scooping Peter up as they headed to the car. "Maybe we can get Daddy to come along too, if we go."
He shooed Steve away, still hobbling slightly as he went back to gather everyone up to get dressed and go over to the kitchen.
Peter turned around and shushed them all quietly. "Dis is da part where he tries ta steals Chris'mas!"
"Months from now. I wanna spend time christening," Tony snickered, pulling his phone out, "Ready to move in? Or d'you wanna take a day?"
Tony could hear his voice breaking as he screamed, tears trying to well up in his eyes. He fought them back as well as he was able.
"This statement is true. Peter said he was okay with it, because if they were being bad, Santa will give him their gifts." He chuckled, leaning in to smooch Tony's cheek.
"What has gotten into him?" Steve asked almost forlorn, running a hand through his hair. "Ever since he started school he has been like this... What happened to out sweet boy? I miss him..."
“Well, you can sleep over tonight with us if all goes well, if you want. Get paid back on that heat, ‘cause furry Cap is like a huge furnace.” Tony offered up, grinning wider at the second groan coming from the blond.
"We should give Sharon a get well basket." He said softly. "She... Depending on her condition, she may not remember, but to say that we did. And that we thank her."
Steve hummed, shaking his head lightly. "Your Daddy is smart. Thinks he's real smart." He sighed, feeling the partial block. He didn't know what he was blocking, but he knew it couldn't be too good. But it didn't seem too bad either if Tony was only partially blocking.
"First off, about you slamming doors," Tony frowned, "You can't go around making loud noises like that. It hurts Sammy's ears, and startles him so he cries."
"Wanna make love to you. Slow and relaxed. Let me work you out from all the stress you have dealt with lately." Steve explained, gently setting Tony onto the bed. "Will you let me do that to you?"
"Fine. But I'm not gonna like it." Peter huffed softly, eating the veggies first to get them out of the way.
Steve hummed into the contact and the closeness, wrapping his arms back around Tony with a happy hum. He kissed the top of his husband's head tenderly with a smile.
"We have to get sheets and stuff, man. I'm not letting you fuck me on a plain mattress. You know how hard that would be to clean?"
He took a deep breath and clenched his fists, anger and protectiveness thrumming through every nerve in his body.
"Well, I'm not gonna deny it," he mumbled, embarrassment flushing into his cheeks, "I.... I'm having trouble."
"It’s the Hans Yurich Department of Renaissance Arts. It’s the huge building down near 45th." He informed, buckling into his seat.
Steve kissed back gladly, soft smile on his lips when they parted. "Now that is a good morning kiss." He hummed, kissing Tony again. "And I agree on the spanking thing. You and me. Unless a really dumb thing."
"Y'so good t'me," he murmured, dissolving into light laughter, "Honey, my legs are going to give out, you fucked me just a little
"That's enough time to catch up a bit on our personal time." Steve sighed, carding his fingers into Tony's hair lovingly. "And we can do whatever you'd want to do."
"Damn, still so tight, baby. Even after almost a whole hand?" He huffed, a slow burn already working up his spine.
"Oh no, I'm getting out his little doodles, and his baby clothes," Tony giggled, "Oh god, he's going to think we're both
"Surprise," Steve said with a grin, petting Tony's hair back from his forehead. "Do you like it, love? Bruce helped me out a bit, but the idea was all me."
Steve silently nodded, kissing Tony back before getting off of the bed. He stripped out of his clothes and went to the nightstand to grab lube and began slicking up his fingers. He crawled back over Tony again on the bed, reaching down and carefully pressing two fingers at Tony's entrance.
“Understood. All right, fellas. Let leave and get to work so we don’t assault Cap’s nose with so many weird smells.” Nat addressed, ushering Sam and Clint out of the lab. She looked back at Bucky, raising a brow as he stood in place.
"I'd hope so," Tony mumbled back, kissing at Steve's neck before the theater lights dimmed, "I love you, I love you, I
"De advenchas of Cap'n 'Merica, Iwon Man, and Spidahman," He announced, opening the graphic novel, "Storwy an' art by Steeb Stark-Wogers."
Steve chuckled softly at him. "Well, I'll just have to buy you some so you can practice, Anthony." He laughed, smoothly filling in the rest of the silhouette. "I can help, if you'd like me to?" He offered softly.
Sammy giggled happily and grabbed his teether from the blanket while Peter leaned over and grabbed one of his books, opening it on the floor in front of him.
"Or go up to a bed, like normal people," Tony mused, raising an eyebrow, "That and I'm concerned for any glass and stuff that might be on the floor."
"You even told me you were tired when you got out of the bath." Steve pointed out, kissing the boy's forehead. "We have plenty of time tomorrow to do things. We cuddle and read more tomorrow or play. But right now is bedtime."
Maybe he should look up things? Just to see. But he was going to ask Tony about it first before he did. Just so he knew about what he was going to do.
"Otay..." He murmured back softly. "I'm sorry Daddy." Peter murmured with a small sniffle as Tony left.
"Mhm." Tony kissed his cheek before sitting down next to him, rolling out the blueprint paper in front of them. "Whatcha thinkin' for the wall?"
He leaned down and smooched Peter's face before going to Sammy. "You be good and have fun too, okay Samwich?" Steve whispered with a smooch on the top of the baby's head. "Love you, boys."
He smacked his fist on the table, glaring at the broken machinery in front of him, not aware of how loud he actually was.
"Never need to rent. Plenty of space for guests, though," Tony laughed breathlessly, "We should buy it. There's a room on the second floor that's perfect--"
Steve felt his heartstrings tug just a little hearing Peter starting to cry, sitting up with a stretch before hugging the boy close.
“Y-yeah--" Tony threw his head back and gasped, slowly jerking himself off in tempo to Steve's thrusts.
talk to him. Set him straight that this wasn't what he thought." He said quietly, taking Tony's hand as they ventured upstairs.
" I dunno. I'd have to see some of your work before I can just let you draw me. I don't just want some weirdo who has no skill drawing me and making me look bad.".
"We are proud of you for showing Sammy though, Peter. Just do it with our permission from now on." Steve said with a small smile.
"Shhh, honey," Tony soothed, relief blooming in his chest, "He didn't know, bubby. It probably freaked him out to see doodles on the walls." He glanced over at Bucky, grateful to see him nod. "See? Everything's okay, sweetheart, no need to cry."
"Oh my god, kid, just don’t suck my blood, got it?" Tony warned, letting Sammy chew on his finger again.
"I know you're gonna go out and fuck that boy again, Steve. I would teach you a lesson, but if you want me to stop, I will." Tony pulled his hand away again.
"Alright, I know you're excited for presents," Pepper laughed, pushing Tony gently toward the kitchen, "You're a bit excited, sweetie."
"You lived that close and what made you finally meet was a mistake in the post?" Peggy said, surprised.
Tony beamed happily and gave Steve a quick kiss before sliding down into his seat, buckling happily.
"He'll have to start sitting up before that, though." Steve pointed out. "Let’s get him doing that first and his tooth in and we'll deal with that when we get to it."
"All right. But it’s not my fault if he starts crying. He's really attached to Peter." Steve admitted, reaching to pick the baby up.
"Don't be rude. Besides, that would just be our room, and you guys wouldn't be going in there anyway." Steve smirked, scooting closer to Tony.
"Almost done," He soothed, lifting the boy up onto his step stool, "Can you brush your teeth for me?"
"How much would it cost me for the summer?" The merman asked, knowing the summer season would be starting shortly. It seemed the perfect time to explore and enjoy the warmth of the land.
"A-ahh, Steve," Tony moaned against the desk, vision going white from the heavy stimulation, "Baby, not gon' last much, fuck--" He kept it together for a few more thrusts before he came, screaming Steve Steve Steve over and over again.
He smirked, taking two of the flutes to pour the sparkling juice, one for Peter and one for himself.
"It’s not against ya, Daddy. Its s'posed to help ya." Peter said, immediately covering his mouth as if he just gave a big hint to the secret.
"Then we'll go once we feel like moving," Tony decided, "It's a gorgeous place, Steve, it really is--"
"Mmm, once the cabin holiday gets here, it'll seem like the days are minutes," Tony hummed, grabbing the other half of the gifts, "Speaking of that, I need to go get stuff for the trip. Secret stuff."
"If you want to be sorer, keep it up," he hummed, "Do remember we bought a riding crop and leather paddle, dear."
"Hey now, I hear those tones under that, he loves you just as much," Tony hummed, leaning over to kiss Steve's shoulder, "
"In case-- I don't want to get into a situation where I start withdrawal and Peter-- I don't want him to see me like that," Tony replied quietly, "Eventually, I'll be able to get rid of it, but for now, I want the temptation aside."
Peter tried to huff but it came out as a sniffle; he knew Steve was right, so he let himself be washed up, still slightly teary as he was helped out and wrapped a fluffy towel around himself. With a sad sigh, Peter sat on the edge of the tub, shivering when his feet touched the chilly tile.
"Okay. We'll go on a date," He murmured, looking over at Steve with a soft smile, "But that means you're planning it and stuff."
"It showed up when I was about sixteen. It’s the words your soulmate will say to you when you first meet." He explained. "Daddy's is close by his neck."
"Sometimes, I don't know if there is, Steve," Tony replied, voice cracking slightly, "What if the soulmate thing is all jack? What if-- what if we just happened to meet, and this--" He waved his hand, "This was all too fast for us? What if we fell too deep--" He took a breath, tears stinging his eyes.
"Call your husband and father a nerd. I'm appalled. Well, I'm your nerd, so you are stuck with me." He stated, sticking his tongue out.
"Yes, my liege." Steve spoke dramatically, laughing as he scooped Tony up into a bridal carry and brought him to the bathroom.
Nodding, Tony kissed Steve's ring hand, sniffling before being able to settle down. He coughed, drew the covers up around them, and promptly fell asleep against Steve's chest, snoring loudly. Steve smiled to himself hearing Tony snore, holding him close in a form of comfort. Tony obviously had some damage when it came to people caring for him, but Steve truly did love him dearly, and would do whatever to make Tony know that. He left a feather-light kiss on the man's cheek before shutting his own eyes and drifting off to sleep.
"Ring--back of nightstand drawer," Tony groaned, thumping his head back against Steve's chest, "Hurry up,
"I think it’s definitely fridge-worthy." Steve grinned happily, seeing the boy beam at the praise. "We'll put it up when we head downstairs in a bit."
Tony cried out as he came in Steve's hand, completely covering it and his chest in his come; he leaned back and breathed hard, nuzzling at Steve's neck while he kept pounding into him.
Tony leaned in to continue, kissing up along the blond's jaw and nipping gently at the skin. He moved them so Steve was slightly straddled beneath him, his lips kissing and latching softly onto the other's collarbones.
"Mmm, you made me into a sap," Tony happily returned the kiss, reaching up the brush away the wetness at the corner of Steve's eyes, "But it's all worth it, y'know."
"When they come over tomorrow, ask Buck if he can take the kiddo for a week," he whispered, stroking Steve's cheek, "If he says yes, I'll get the cabin set up for us. Romantic getaway, the whole shebang."
"I-I'm sorry sir, but he just makes me feel so amazing. I can't help it." He breathed out, laying his head on the desk.
In the dead of the night, Steve packed a few mementos to take with him in his satchel. He wanted to have something to remember Peggy, Fury, ... and Bucky by in case he didn't return to the sea for a long time. He would miss them, but this was something he needed to do.
Steve made a small, almost mewling noise from the attentions, leaning forward into the touch before he finally replied.
"You're right, you don't have to, but Papa and I have seen how good you are at taking care of Sammy," Tony hummed, "You'll have a break soon, pipsqueak, and we'll have a day of just us, okay?"
"Tony, be nice. He's already doing advanced work for a seven year old. Let him go his own pace." Steve stated, still watching as Sammy chewed on him. "Really, how you enjoy this is a mystery to me."
"Understood." Steve said with a nod before being OK'ed to leave. With a strong flick of his tail, he swam out of the chamber.
"We shouldn't need to go back, though." Steve said quietly. "It’s our time alone. And we are going to enjoy it. I won't worry anymore. Promise. Will just worry about us having fun."
"It would appear so." Steve chuckled warmly, smooching Tony's cheek as he passed to set the table. "At least you won't be for too much longer since breakfast is served!" He said dramatically.
“I’m sure there is probably some information out there on werewolves that will actually be helpful.” Natasha suggested with a thoughtful hum “Just have to try and sort the fact from fiction while we gather information.”
"So about that spanking me thing, definitely think we should take care of that first," he muttered, "Then have fun sexy times."
Steve sighed a soft breath, looking to their hands. "I just miss my ma, is all." He said quietly. "With the accident of your's and helping you deal with that, and then...some of the ways you treat me when we're just relaxed... I just get reminded of her more and more." He shook his head softly. "I'll be fine soon, though. It'll pass. So don't worry about it, okay?"
He smirked behind his pipe, going to stand in front of the large bay window to watch the sun rays cast over their small London town. Later that day, Stark and Rogers traveled down towards the morgue location Mr. Wilson had given them.
"Really, I'm lucky I found Tony." Steve said softly with a smile. "If our mail person hadn't mixed up with our apartment numbers, we might not have met for even longer." He said softly.
Tony looked around, thinking he heard an owl really close, but he didn't see one. Oh well, better talking to a hidden owl than talking to himself, right?
"You are spitting everywhere, close your mouth when you chew," Tony laughed, "And don't talk with food in your mouth, silly."
Ms. Potts gave a small smile in acknowledgement, then looking over Steve's shoulder at Tony with narrow eyes.
"You're so beautiful, Steven, so beautiful," Tony hummed, scooting down to press kisses along the blond's cock.
Tony just huffed, sticking his tongue out at Steve. "You're a tease," he complained, "And a total sap. Sappy Steve."
. I can't go on a date without stammering, I can't even be sweet with you without dissolving into a little puddle of emotions," Tony grumbled, shivering at Steve's kisses, "I just-- I can do the most intense sex, but confessing feelings and being romantic-- fuck, I'm allergic to
Peter nodded and really tried to get through the movie, but once the machine guns came into play, he ended up burying his face in Steve's chest, whimpering as he curled up in his Papa's lap.
'Captain Steve Rogers.' He replied back with a soft smile, giving a firm shake of hands. 'Its a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Potts.'
"Don't worry, I'll help you out munchkin." Steve assured, smooching the top of Peter's head. "So. We all ready to go, boys?"
"I'm bad at coloring, Steven," Tony complained, filling it in, "I was never a coloring book person as a kid."
. I could probably rent out the room The Shining was written about," Tony replied smugly, "It'd be a hell of a honeymoon, that's for sure."
"Petey-Bear!!! You saved me from being a monster! Thank you so much!" He chuckled, booping Peter's nose happily.
"No, you are mean. Time out for meanies," Tony huffed, still not looking at Steve, "I'll will put you in the corner, Steven Rogers, and I will leave you there while I play spin the bottle with Clint and Bucky."
Sharon laughed, leaning back in her chair, "Mister Stark-Rogers, I'll have you know that while it’s a generous offer, the fact that my child will be in good hands is enough for me. And, speaking of baby classes--"
Sammy giggled, happily burrowing into Steve's neck as he was carried downstairs. He perked up at the sight of Peter, reaching out for his brother.
"He's been up since the day before last. He has been nothing but Coffee- Fueled since then. He was pulling an all-nighter working on a project over there.".
"Then why are you blushing then? And using your phone as a distraction?" Steve asked curiously, cocking his head as well.
"What's wrong, Tony?" He asked softly. "I mean other than your injury. Knowing you, I know that's not what this is about, babe."
"Trust me, I would not rip your dick off. But I would be very upset with you for a while. Took me forever to save up for that." He said softly, kissing at where he had smacked.
He cuddled the boy close and sat down on the bed, kissing his cheeks. Tony rocked him back and forth, singing under his breath as he did so. He waited for Peter to calm down before pulling back, wiping the last of his tears away.
"Mmkay. You're driving," Tony hummed happily, trailing after Steve to the car, "Can we go get milkshakes first? I'm craving a milkshake."
"It was fun. Saw a lot of interesting fish there. And the penguins were cute, of course." Steve explained softly. "Peter spotted it at the gift shop and he was good, so I thought why not?"
"I love you, too." Steve whispered back happily. "But you make me happy and warm just being you." He kissed sweetly at Tony's neck with a hum. "I appreciated what you do, though. So very sweet of you, babe."
"But you would think there would be some form of evidence left behind. Yet the police could find none." Riley pondered. "That's why we've come to you, Mr. Stark.".
“We're gonna switch a lot, but when we talk to my parents, I'm gonna need you to really help me," Tony mumbled, focusing on relaxing his muscles, "I usually can control, and I enjoy it, but, y'know. I love you being rough and I love you writhing under me. That's another thing, though. About me being submissive."
"Bad. No eating until after we say grace." Steve scolded playfully, carrying the potatoes to the table. "We'll talk about our trip after dinner."
"First night in our house. Not in an apartment. We don't have to go back and forth between each other's apartment all the time, and we can just... Be.".
Tony tested the bonds, feeling his cock jump at how tight the silk was. "Yessir," he replied softly, leaning into Steve's touch, "I'll behave..."
Steve sufficed with that answer, resting his head in his hands on the shore. Tony simply thought that made for a wonderful mental photograph.
"You're such a cheesball, Stark-Rogers," Tony muttered affectionately, scratching at Steve's scalp, "I love every moment with you, baby." A tiny smile wormed its way onto his face, leaving a light blush in its wake.
Sammy just looked back confused at his Daddy, noising gently and making grabby hands at Tony's hand again.
"For some reason that doesn't seem normal." Steve chuckled, moving to nuzzle Tony. "Remind me to never go to the guest house at all, by the way if that's the case. I honestly never thought of Bucky as that kind of guy. Who knew?"
"You just love takin' it slow, don't you baby?" Tony hummed, flicking Steve's abused nipple before hopping off the bed, "If you want it slow, I want you to be all pretty for me."
Steve nodded softly, bouncing the baby in his arms. "No, you're right. They should get to see them. And they're just a block away. They'll... They'll be okay. And we could use just a little us time, right?"
"A...a what?" Steve asked softly, not sure what that term was. Tony had never used the term around him before.
Steve nodded. "Yeah. We were starting to nap together on the couch but then I heard something and had to cover his ears." He explained. "He's napping in his bed now, though."
"We will. We'll bring you some back." The blond responded, picking up Peter and smooching at Tony's cheek. "We'll be back, love."
Steve blinked for a moment at Tony's statement. "That was random... But yeah, a puppy sounds good. Always wanted a dog." He hummed softly, kissing at Tony's lips. "Any type you are thinking of?"
"He already thinks he's a superstar," Natasha sighed, gracefully hopping up onto a kitchen stool, "World's Best Marksman."
"Glad you love it." Steve smiled fondly, smooching Tony gently. "Peter, you can play with Daddy and your transformer while I make breakfast, and JARVIS can wake the others up so they can eat and open their gifts as well." Steve hummed as he headed to the kitchen.
"Love you..." Steve whispered, leaning into Tony's hand with a light blush on his face. "So good to me..."
The first thing that happened was hand placement, the genius moving one of Steve's hands down to his waist and taking the man's other hand in his own, interlocking their fingers.
"No, shh, no growing up," Tony muttered, burying his face in Steve's neck, "I can't-- I can't think about growing up yet, 'cause then I'll just think about the inevitable and I don't-- I'm not ready for that."
"Love you, too. Very, very much." Steve kissed back happily, cupping Tony's face as he heard a small gasp from Peter.
Tony nuzzled into Steve's neck, letting himself rest there for a moment. Which, inevitably, turned out to be a horrible idea. He let himself slip, for only a second, and he felt everything crash on him at once: his responsibilities, his failures, his past, his own stupid,
The stylist settled the blond into a beautician's chair first thing first, the waving over a woman named Tatianna who leaned Steve back to settle his head into a sink to wash through his hair.
"He was in the service when I was little, so I didn't get to see him much anyway. But something happened, an explosion they told us, and he never came back home.".
"My paper from Bio 401," Tony mused, flicking through his old notes, "Damn, Pete. This is some advanced bedtime story, baby."
"I think it'd be okay," he finally said, rolling his eyes at Peter's whoop, "Just keep the volume down, and only a little bit of the movie. Not too much violence for you, young man."
Peter whined softly and cuddled Sammy closer, clearly shamed and embarrassed. Tony sighed softly and got off Steve's lap to sit in the hammock, tugging Peter into his lap.
"God, he is so cute," Tony murmured, "Steve, my heart is dying from how cute this child is." He clutched at his heart dramatically, falling back on the bed.
"No, you resemble that," Tony shot back, smooching Peter's forehead before turning to the man, "How's your bow doing? Holding up?"
"Shhh," Tony soothed, putting his hand over Steve's, "It's okay, sweetie. It's alright. No use worrying about it now."
"Mmm, maybe explaining. Definitely taking you," Tony snickered, booping their noses together, "Let you pick out stuff you want to try. Sound good?"
He raised an eyebrow at Steve, taking another draw of his pipe before blowing the smoke at his partner.
"I remember that thing." Steve said softly. "That was one of the first things we tried. The end result was great, but the during was teasing."
Steve whined again, covering his head with his pillow.  "Please don't..." He stated rather pitifully through the thick feathers of the pillow.
"Mhm. Once the kitchen is cleaned up, I'll help you move over," Tony hummed, smooching Peter's forehead, "It won't take much time at all, and then I can show you how to play games on your laptop."
Tony angled his hips downward, gasping as he felt Steve tighten around him when he brushed his sweet spot. Even so, he kept his pace slow, shivering at Steve's nails down his back.
"Daddy won't leave you out here, Peter. That'd be mean." Steve explained, lightly giving Tony a scolding look and sending a thought with it.
I added more to the original first chapter, so if you read the first chapter before the edit go back and read the rest before reading this chapter!!!
"And it’s not like I should call you Tony in front of the boys. To them, you're not Tony. You're Daddy." Steve stated, setting the table with a smirk. "Besides, when Sammy starts talking, do you want him to call you Daddy or Tony?"
"Steve, looking like that, you are gonna be the death of me one of these days." Tony nearly moaned, crawling up on the bed in front of the blond and looking the other over. The nervous flush clearly ran down Steve's body, almost all the way down to his toes.
"For now, let's just stick to being young, kinky, and in love," Tony laughed, climbing on top of Steve, "Speaking of kinky--"
Peter pouted up at Tony, but snuggled into him anyway, eventually crawling in under the hoodie, poking his head out with Tony's.
Tony smirked and popped the rest of Steve's buttons open before moving down to his jeans, using only his teeth to open the button and pull down the fly, kissing at his cock through his boxers.
"I like to roleplay, what can I say?" Steve huffed a breathy chuckle. "And you are my smart, young Sherlock."
"Yeah, yeah." Steve smirked, reaching to palm Tony gently through his boxers. "Because this is the 'no sex so we have a place to stay before meeting the parents and not smelling like sex' room."
Steve hummed softly and nodded gently. "As long as that's something you want to do, then I don't mind if we do." He said. "I just need to go to the bathroom real fast."
Steve slipped into the bathroom for the moment, pulling his phone out of his pocket as soon as he closed the door and typing up a text.
"You might like a dog. Steve wants one, but my allergies are kinda prohibiting that," Tony laughed, moving to grease up Bucky's inner elbow, "I'm thinking to surprise him one of these days with a hypo-allergenic one. Or a hairless one. God, he might cry over a hairless dog. Bad idea."
"A bowl for you, munchkin," Steve said with a grin, then turning to Tony. "And I'll trade you a bowl for a baby."
"Well, maybe you could tell me about it, and I will tell you yes, no, or maybe?" Steve offered. "That way we can sort of have some ideas of what to try."
"Well it might do you some good." Steve chuckled, hugging Tony. "It’s just me, anyway. You shouldn't have to be so flustered, babe."
"He was talking about thank you letters for us and Santa for today." Steve explained, holding Peter on his hip. "He had a good day and enjoyed his gifts."
Before Tony had gotten the rest out, Peter's book was put away and the boy was snuggled under a blanket and into a pillow. "Well, not quite that comfy--"
"He really is. He great with science and math, but also likes to take pictures. He takes pictures for the school paper." Steve explained with a grin at Peter.
Tony laughed and followed them upstairs, letting Steve get comfy with Pete before crawling into bed. He slowly stroked his fingers through Peter's hair, resting up on his elbow.
"We came up to make squirt a quick lunch." Bucky explained. Sounds like a good time going on up here."
Tony nodded, flitting out the door to start his tasks before Steve could argue. The blond sighed as Tony went on his way, a shiver running up his spine as he curled up under the blankets for warmth. Curled up in a ball and encased in his cocoon of blankets, Steve quickly fell to sleep.
"Shhh..." Steve quieted him softly, slicking up his fingers and pressing two in to stretch him a bit. "Ask, and ye shall receive."
"Yea, I know," he mumbled, picking at the buttons on Steve's shirt, "I jus' wish dat Sammy weren't so needy. I miss you an' Daddy."
"Yeah, yeah, no need to look at me like that, pipsqueak," Tony rolled his eyes fondly, settling back in the hammock so Peter could curl up on his chest, "Any other demands, Bossman? Or you just want story time?"
Back in Peter's room, Tony rolled his eyes at the sound of pattering feet, waiting for the boy to come back.
Steve shook his head. "Peter has a lot, and we want you guys to open yours before we let him rip through." He explained softly. "You don't mind that, do you bubba?"
"Peter, I know you're excited, but you're not allowed to break Daddy's ears." He laughed, taking the boy in his arms instead. "How about we let Daddy get his hearing back and you and I can start on dinner, huh?"
Peter just ate the rest of his food, diligently eating all his carrots and peppers. Steve couldn't help the little bit of pride he felt watching Peter just eating. He always finished up his food and rarely complained on the taste of something.
Tony went quiet again, eyes closing as he thought. "I'm gonna call around tomorrow," he eventually said, "And find a therapist. Take a couple months off, and see if I can get it together. I'll make this work for you, Steve. I'm going to try."
"Ah. Okay. Good to know then that sushi can be put back on the menu." Tony said with a playful smirk, taking his bite of the fish."Probably would be more of what you're used to, since its just prepared raw fish-- Steve, this is actually
"Oh?" Steve asked softly, nuzzling against Tony's thigh. "Please do enlighten me on this idea of yours."
"I am to make a three piece art series. It can be any medium I want to use and each piece has to evoke an emotion of sorts.".
"Having stubble and growing a beard are different. It gets so patchy at first." Steve murmured softly as he ate. "I'll start trying to grow one to see what it’s like, I guess."
He put Peter down on his stomach and laid down next to him, starting to hand-write the algorithm for the new Starkphone update.
"With Tony's track record, I'll see y'all at the wedding," Clint snorted, effectively dodging Natasha's smack. He turned to grin, smile fading at the look on her face. "Yep, yes ma’am, we're going, bye, Steve--"
He sat up, face completely flushed and cock twitching with need. Steve leaned up, moving closer to Tony and leaning in to trail kisses down his chest. He trailed them all the way down to below Tony's waist and started to kiss along his cock.
Tony bit his lip, putting a hand on Steve's knee before backing up slightly, unbuttoning the muscle shirt and letting it slip onto the floor. He watched Steve carefully, knowing he couldn't miss the nipple rings. "Well?"
Peter eagerly climbed up into Tony's lap with Bumblebee, animatedly talking about the toy while he snuggled up to his Daddy, head resting on his shoulder.
"Back up a second." Tony interrupted for a moment. "Did you just admit to a handsome guy- i.e. me- being apart of the reason you went to a sea witch to become human?"
Steve blinked again, watching Tony carefully as he clipped on the collar. "I'm supposing the talk of pets reminded you?" He asked softly.
Steve leaned down to capture Tony's lips as he finished pushing in, kissing him deeply as he started to move. He hummed breathlessly against Tony's lips, the starts of friction feeling fantastic.
Tony prostrated himself at Steve's feet, gently pushing the panties to the side to kiss at Steve's cock, easily taking the head into his mouth the suckle lightly. Steve made a soft whine in reply as Tony suckled, trying to not look in the mirror.
"Love you." He whispered softly as Tony walked away, falling straight to sleep once more. He snored slightly with his nose stuffed up a bit, snuggling into his pillow.
"S'okay. Not much of a bother." He panted, kissing Tony back as he pulled out, falling to the side with a content hum. "We should probably clean up, y'think?"
"Yeah. Aunt Natasha braids Uncle Bucky's hair to get it out of the way sometimes," Tony explained, finishing off the braid and tying it up with the band, "That way if you get sick in the night, you won't get it in your hair."
"That 'lady' is my friend Peggy. We've been friends since middle school." Steve explained, slightly a jab at Tony for assuming. "And yes, I would love for you to meet her. She hasn't seen me in years and I would like her to meet my family."
"Nah, maybe more like a loose-cannon superhero. Super Villains never really get a chance to win. They do have some pretty cool facial hair though.". Tony started to over-dramatically stroke his chin with his last statement, leaving Steve in a small fit of  laughter.
"No internet, and it only has learning games on it. Jumpstart, Clue Finders, stuff like that. And it automatically shuts itself off at 7PM," Tony grinned, "I'm not that bad of a parent, Barton."
"All right. See you later, Bucky. Thank you." Steve hummed, watching him leave before making sure the room was all set up before locking it as he left.
'"Yeah. Yes, I am. Very much. Which is why I am concerned that you stopped." Steve pointed out, flush clearly evident on his cheeks from the previous heated actions between the two of them. "Did I do something wrong?"
"I never got up that early for Christmas," Tony shrugged, leaning into Steve before breaking off to grab his pajamas, "It was... Not a good holiday for little-me."
"I think--" He hefted Peter up to his chest, putting his hands under his backside to steady him. "--that it's an excellent idea."
"But just looking at you, you seem to be the exact opposite of that." Bruce continued. "You're alright by me.".
"I know sweetie, its okay," Tony hummed, leaning down to kiss the boy's forehead, "Why don't we get that ice cream I promised you? It might help you feel better."
A three part series. Ms. Wyatt told the class to do a three part art series for their project for finals. The theme? Emotions. The Medium? Anything they so chose to use, as long as it is reasonable.Okay, that was easy.
down, mini monster." Steve grinned, sitting up and scooping Peter up to head to the table. "And that means eating all of your dinner."
Steve was in the middle of setting Sammy down for his nap when he felt a twinge of pain through the bond. It was often, since Tony often burnt his fingers as he worked, so he didn't worry too much.
"I think that's an absolutely great idea. He'd love it." Steve enthused quietly, but it raised a question. "How would we get this all set up without him knowing about it?"
Steve made a quick noise at his hair being tugged, adjusting to Tony moving with him. He hummed low as he tried to take in a bit more, bit by bit, mindful of Tony's thrusts so he didn't gag.
Tony really couldn't help the whimper that leaked from his throat, biting his tongue to try and keep his cock from twitching.
Steve was playing with Sammy as they waited in the dining room for Peter and Tony. He only knew the others had shown up when Sammy was throwing kisses over Steve's shoulder.
"Pretty much that, yeah. Dating is kind of like finding the mate you want to spend your life with. There is a lot of trial and error with it, and if you feel like they aren't meant to be your mate, then you try and find another and see how it works out." The engineer tried explaining in the best way possible.
"Yeah we're home, but Peter, baby, you hurt your nose. It’s bleeding." Steve said worriedly, setting their things down and patting Peter's back to let go. "Let’s take care of that, then we can say hi, munchkin, okay?"
"Man, I love you." He professed, running hands gently across Tony's chest. "So gorgeous and perfect for me. I wouldn't want anyone else."
Tony winked, climbed out of the car and popped the trunk, grabbing his suitcase and the (slightly) smaller sleek suitcase.
He whimpered, pushing back into Steve's hand. Steve smacked one of Tony's cheeks, running his hand on the curve of his ass.
"Are you, munchkin?" He chuckled, smooching Peter's face. "Y'sound a little asleep still, baby. Once you wake up, we can get some ice cream, huh?"
It took a couple days to get everything sorted and packed, but they were ready by Friday afternoon, car packed and ready to go.
cried watching Steve take the baby, such a small thing in his husband's strong arms. Quietly, Tony thanked the nurse and took the small bag from her, making last confirmations before heading back to the elevator.
ANYWHO! This chapter took a bit longer because it itself is a bit longer. I am honestly making this all up as I go along with a couple set points in my mind, so I am cranking them out as I write 'em (heh- heh (ｰ ｰ;) )
"Can't be too loud," Tony moaned softly, wrapping his arms around Steve's neck, "Y'feel so good, baby, so good--"
"We were beat, man. Sorry," Tony chuckled, not at all surprised that Peter leapt up to go see Bruce, "Did y'all sleep well?"
Steve rolled his hips and thrusted in a careful rhythm, focusing on making sure Tony felt good. He bent over the man as he moved, kissing sweetly along the brunet's neck and spine, trailing down nice and slow.
"Hey, on the way home we have a little surprise that might make you feel a little better, okay?" Steve offered with a small smile, rubbing Peter's back. "We'll grab Sammy and head home, bubba."
He quickly changed the baby and put him into the outfit, setting Sammy on his hip once he was done. Tony hummed softly and bounced the baby as he walked back to his room, not surprised to see Steve putting the carrier on the floor.
Steve chuckled at that. "You no doubt have a rather vivid imagination. I'm sure you can think of something entertaining." He grinned back. "I, on the other hand, will have to try and not think about anything too vivid while I'm working. Might cause trouble."
Steve simply responded by scooping Peter up in one arm, heading over to Tony and pulling him into a hug with them. He smooched both of their faces, mess and all, sputtering out a bit of eggshell after kissing Peter's head but all with a smile.
Sammy whined gently as he patted his hand on Tony's lips, almost as if he tried to will the muffin back out of Tony's mouth.
"It's open," Tony called, not bothering to look up from his welding station, "There's food in the fridge if you want any, beer on the second shelf. I'll be a few minutes."
"We can bring them over later when they are done. You don't have to drive back out here, Tony." Natasha insisted, coming up to gently pet Peter's head. "You get to feeling good soon, little spider." She whispered, kissing the boy's cheek.
"You are nearly ten minutes late, Steven." A man with an accent said as he walked towards the front doors towards them.
Peter gasped and clambered out of bed, grabbing Tony's hand so he could drag him back to the bedroom.
"Do you honestly feel that way?...After these years, do you really doubt that what we have is something special?" He whispered softly.
“U! Baby, Daddy’s sorry! I was so worried. I thought you had followed me outta here early. Are you okay?” Tony gushed, reaching out to pet U’s fur.
"Sorry! Let me start over. Y'see, I'm an art major here on the campus and I was looking for a subject for my final project coming up. Then I saw you sitting here and- sorry if this sounds weird- you have a great facial structure for drawing. So, I was wondering if you could be my subject matter...". Steve began to trail off near the end out of slight embarrassment.
"Uh huh, sure," Tony rolled his eyes, leaning up to rub his beard against Steve's chin, "I just have a Van Dyke, that's all."
"I'm a perfect angel, no worries." Tony smirked, giving Pepper a quick hug before she'd leave. "I'll call later. We'll schedule a lunch together and chat." He explained, waving as the woman left the room.
Steve sent out a grinned across the table at the group, glass in hand. "On the count of three. One, two...three!"
"Yeah. Please do," Tony wrinkled his nose, rolling his eyes, "And pack them a bag, just so they don't use their own stuff."
"I hate getting flustered and shy, you ass," Tony grumbled, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach, "I might throw up from all this lovey dovey stuff."
Now, he was 26. He was a freelance artist living in a decent apartment only due to the money from his regular job, and had yet to meet his soulmate. The words hadn't been spoken.
"Do they let you visit the baby and everything after birth? Like, without breaking a contract or anything, that is." He asked softly. "I mean if you want--if you want-- you can visit it if you are allowed. I would think it’s only fair, so--"
"I know baby, but they're both gonna go through it," he explained softly, gently kneading Steve's scalp, "It's one of the problems of adopting siblings, love. He's going to be okay once Sammy gets here, and it'll all turn out, you'll see."
"So, based upon your dream, what thing are you wanting to try next?" He asked with a small smirk to his lips.
Steve sighed at that, but nodded. The boy had no idea how right he was. Tony never really tries to be careful with himself. Only really when he is with Peter and Steve.
Tony gave him a side glance, but figured he was being his stupid chivalrous self as usual. Opening the door, Tony was met with loud shouts of
"You married me, can't back out now," Tony teased, sitting up on his elbows, "Y'know, when you put it like that, maybe I'll work on a fucking machine. Like, a dildo on steroids. I could give it a motorcycle engine to
"Well then, while that’s chilling, what would you two like to do?" Steve asked. "It'll be just a little while before it’s done."
"Welcome to my humble abode." Steve said somewhat blandly. His side of the room was less than bland however. There were papers covered in sketches EVERYWHERE, with a few small painting canvases in the mix. Tony just stood there looking around, trying to take everything in.
He waited for Pepper to come over so he could put his face in her stomach, wrapping his arms around her middle.
"I'm gonna braid your hair, baby," Tony hummed, scooting behind Peter, "Just like Uncle Bucky, okay?"
Sammy made a huff noise at Tony, babbling as they moved to the spot the blanket would go to. He whined when they stopped, intently watching Tony.
"He is persistent when it comes to sitting up on his own, though." He hummed. "Persistent like his old man."
He sadly watched Steve open the door, not knowing how thin and pale he looked under the fluorescent lights of the workshop.
He couldn't help his burst of laughter, leaning up to smooch Steve. Steve snorted a laugh after the smooch, raising a brow as he slipped his fingers back in and got back to work.
He knew he was probably bruising Steve's hips from how tight he was holding him, but Tony used the leverage to slam himself against Steve's sweet spot over and over again.
He snorted in laughter, almost rolling off the bed. Steve rolled his eyes, grabbing onto Tony before he rolled off the bed and holding him to his chest.
"If you can't handle the kisses, stay out of the sweater." Steve joked as he calmed down, reaching to pet Peter's hair in apology.
"I'd never try to kill you. You're too precious." Steve laughed, patting Tony's back to try to help. "And all right. I can be patient," he hummed sweetly.
"Oh, trust me babe. I know you do." He grinned, moving to nip and suck a dark mark on Tony's neck, just above his collar line.
"I want to marry you," he blurted, "As soon as possible. We'll go to the courthouse, and we can do the fancy ceremony later if you want, but I-- I really want to be yours. Completely. God, I've needed you so much in my life, and fuck me if I'm gonna push you away." He paused. "...Again."
"I love you," he replied, curling up in his blanket, "I miss your warmth, though. Miss some other things from you since we've always had people over--"
Tony hummed in agreement, jaw grinding as he actually started to pay attention; Steve's warmth made him melt, keeping his anxiety at bay. Steve held onto Tony's hand as they watched, flinching slightly at a few of the jump scares in the movie. Not scared, just surprised as the movie went on. Tony clenched and unclenched the hand not held by Steve, eyes flashing at predictable jump scares. He burrowed more into Steve, more than happy to just sit with him.
"Anthony Stark!" Steve said in faux appall. "I can see that the swats will not be enough. I'll have to up your punishment."
Tony bit down on Steve's shoulder, burying his groans in the other's skin; he gasped roughly, coming hard between their chests.
"I'm behavin', Daddy. Jus' huggin' Auntie Peppah." The boy explained, getting picked up by the strawberry blonde.
"Sap," Tony mumbled, kissing Steve's eyelids, "I love you too, you big goof." He purposefully ignored the second part of the whisper, knowing the familiar twinge in his heart that conveyed his disbelief.
Tony raised an eyebrow at the seemingly well-wrapped gift, eyes widening slightly as he pulled out the boxes of bandages.
"'Jamas firs! Cuz sup'heroes wear da undies on da ou'side. Like Sup' Man!" He said excitedly, toddling over to Tony again.
As soon as Tony fell asleep, Steve quickly followed. He was out like a light and basically sleeping like a rock, soft snores escaping as they napped.
Steve sat on his bed that night sketching out ideas for his next piece. He must have been doing something funny because he heard Clint chuckle from the other side of the room. Steve looked at him confused.
Peter banged his fork on the table till Steve came into the room, making grabby hands for his dinner.
Steve breathed carefully as his eyesight was temporarily taken, his hearing sense sharpened slightly and hearing Tony clatter things around on the desk. He took a deep breath, prepping himself for whatever Tony would start out with.
Peter bounced back to the couch, grabbing one of Sammy's spit bibs to lay over his lap, patiently waiting for Steve to bring the baby over. Steve headed onto the couch, carefully passing Sammy over to Peter.
"Wow, Steve, you've really bulked up since I left," She hummed, an amused glint in her eye, "But nobody wrote me to tell me you'd gone and changed your last name on me! I think I startled your poor roommate."
"I know babe, I like seeing you squirm," Tony hummed, easily slipping in a finger, "You're so gorgeous like this."
Sharon laugh quietly, nestling back in her pillows. She went to speak when a knock at the door interrupted them, and a nurse walked in.
"That’s what you get for trying to make something from comic books a reality." He sighed, petting Tony's hair. "I'll give you a massage and some aspirin before bed."
"Pete, there's a blanket on the couch if you wanna curl up under it. It'll block out the noise," Tony offered, watching the boy scramble to immerse himself in the fluffy blanket before turning back to Bucky.
He started to run off, turning to yell at the blond. "And I'll definitely be back to see you, handsome!"
Steve tensed up at the intrusion at first, unused to the feeling and wincing softly. The rubbing on his hip and Tony's voice was comforting, though. So he was thankful for that. It took a moment for him to relax and get used to the feeling, but when Steve did, he nodded to let Tony know he was okay.
"To prove it even further though, I actually have something for you." Steve explained, reaching under his pillow. "It’s, uh, not as great as the one you gave me, but its sentimental."
"Well, Sammy is a baby. So I baby talk him." Steve explained, reaching to play a little with Peter's hair. "And although you aren't a baby, you are still my baby, Pete."
"Uh-huh. M'hungry, though," Peter replied, reaching up to play with Sammy's outstretched arm, "Why's you an Papa an Sammy up so early?"
"No wonder he's been so chewy lately. He's teething." Steve said happily. "We'll have to get him some teether toys."
Tony laughed, cupping his face and pulling him into a kiss, too caught up in the happiness to realize how forward he was being.
"....And in other breaking news, Weapons Designer Howard Stark and wife Maria Stark were involved in a combusted pile-up out on route 17. Authorities have not pulled a survivor from the pile up; though there has not been an official statement, it is obvious that no one could have lived through the blaze that engulfed the automobiles. Their son, Anthony Stark, is expected to take over the company---"
"Fuck," Tony wheezed, arching his hips up to give Steve more access, "P-please, Sir, I need you so bad--" He tried to roll his hips back onto Steve's fingers, whining softly.
night since you returned from the front lines," Tony murmured, kissing the edge of Steve's lips, "And we know not to assume, Steven. That's not proper in my line of business."
Tony took a breath and relaxed, moaning loudly as he came down Steve's throat; he shook slightly, toes curling as he started to swim in the high.
Steve leaned over and smooched Tony's cheek. "I've got it all sorted out, don't you worry." He hummed confidently. "Who's to say I don't already have a cake made for you at home?"
"Yeah, ba ba yourself," Tony rolled his eyes, standing with Sammy, "Time to put you to bed, chatterbox."
"But finding that missing piece helps. And does wonders, Tones." Clint pointed out. "Being completely open to your soulmate is such a help and comfort. It’s the best first step.".
Steve took down every bit that Tony gave him that he could, a strand of saliva from his mouth and a bit of come at the corner of his lips when he pulled away. The blond breathed a bit heavy, licking the mess from his lips as he stared down at Tony.
"You can say that again," Tony grumbled, defensive mechanisms starting to take over, "Of course. It's not even about the stitches, is it? It's the goddamn fact of what you know about me and you don't--
"But you do lots of good stuffs." Peter explained, looking at his father surprised. "And you do it all really good. I've never see ya mess up."
Steve grinned back at the man, raising an eyebrow for a moment. "I might just take you up on that offer sometime. Especially if you aren't opposed--" he hummed.
"Why are you taking Sammy out of his crib? Without Daddy and I's permission?" Steve asked gently, crossing his arms as he looked at Peter
I couldn't see you again yet. But it wasn't your time. Not then. But now you can rest. Now you can come with me."
"Whoa, buddy. Don't get ahead of the game, there." Steve chuckled, swooping in to grab the griddle before it could fall and hurt Peter somewhere. "Gotta be careful with that, Peter."
"That's good. But calm down, Tony. You got him here. You did good, baby." Steve whispered, giving Tony a kiss for comfort. "We didn't know and sadly one of the only ways to find out allergies is to be exposed to it."
"Maybe I love a lot of things, but a lot of those things involve you, so--" He shrugged with a dopey grin, smooching Tony's lips.
and leaving Steve to raise those kids himself." He seethed. "You are so much fuckin' better than your father was to you. And people only end up like their parents if they let themselves. And
"I know, Tony. I--I know..." Steve whispered softly, tears welling up at the corners of his eyes. He couldn't stand not being able to help Tony when he hurt like this. He hated he couldn't fix it all.
"We know this movie by heart, sweetie," Tony chuckled, pulling Peter into his lap so he could cuddle up to Steve, "We didn't miss anything."
"Poseidon can be afraid of a shark if it was fierce enough. Or big enough." He murmured, sneaking Peter a cookie as well.
"I can't--I can't help but imagine your cock, Sir," Tony mumbled, trying so very hard not to laugh, "I can always tell that days you don't wear underwear, 'cause it’s really evident in your trousers."
"I love you." Steve breathed happily, continually caressing Tony's skin. "You are absolutely precious, babe. Gorgeous." He moved down to suck softly along Tony's collarbone with a deep hum.
"I know, I know, but still," Tony frowned, "I--It didn't-- Come on. You and I are going to sleep together. Right now. Because I love you." He grabbed Steve's hand, attempting to drag him back upstairs.
"Sorry we keep talking about Sammy so much. You don't have to pretend that’s not what’s bothering you..." Steve said softly, reaching to stroke Peter's face.
Tony gaped at the clearly graphic drawings on the walls, jaw open as he started at Clint scrubbing off a particularly large penis. "
"--In here is a couple places that past couples have gone to, as well as daycares and babysitting services if the need arises. Personally, I'd go to Miss Lewis for the classes. She's a very solid, strong woman who knows what she's doing."
"Ooo, that’s a good size welt." He murmured. "Lay down, I'm gonna get something cold to put on that, okay? Wait right there." Steve explained, running to find the kitchen.
"Our own stamp on our place." Steve hummed. "I'm happy you had the idea to do this. I love it. I love you.".
"Alright, it looks like its bedtime for you. Want you to sleep in an actual bed, not the couch." Tony huffed gently, before scooping up the other in his arms.
"Oooh yeah--" Steve moaned out, grabbing carefully onto Tony's hips and wriggling his hips further up into the heat. "Mmm, y'already feel perfect, baby--".
"Oh, Tony..." Pepper said softly, wrapping an arm around him. "I know the circumstances aren't great, but I'm happy that you got your soulmate. Glad you had someone here with you." She said, kissing Tony's forehead as they walked into the room.
Steve could do no more than huff a small chuckle, still trying to fall from his high. He simply moved to curl around Tony the best he could in his stated, nestling into the crook of Tony's neck. Tony hummed softly as Steve curled up to him, tugging a blanket over their entwined bodies.
"Sorry, I gotta bounce. I forgot I promised I would play Test Subject for my roomate today also. I'll see ya tomorrow?".
"And if for some weird reason we aren't soulmates in that sense, we are still soulmates in the other. And I would never want to leave you. Ever
," Tony laughed and buried his face in Steve's back, rubbing circles into his abs, “Let’s go, babe."
As he walked inside the mansion, it felt strangely quiet. He tried to listen for a TV on in case Steve still had been watching movies, but there wasn't really any noise. Maybe the blond was asleep?
dinner." Steve clarified with a hum. "You were very good with waiting and very sweet with your baby brother. I'm proud of you, Peter."
"Yessir-- Sir, please--" he arched up into the touch, moaning breathily, "Please, please, Sir, need it--been so bad lately--"
Steve just continued by kissing along the back of Tony's neck and his back, leaving them all soft and sweet with a grin on his lips.
"M'kay..." He sighed, shutting his eyes as Tony cleaned him. "And t'morrow, we'll invite your mom over and clean up f'her."
"You're a saint." Tony lifted his head off Steve's lap so he could get up, rolling over to watch him. "You're so gorgeous, oh my god," he said softly.
Steve huffed a small chuckle, watching Tony just completely nod off. He brushed through Tony's hair softly as he shut his eyes for sleep. "G'night Tony. Sweet dreams..."
Steve hummed happily in response. "Yeah, he is. He'll be a great older brother. He can teach the baby so many things about what being a kid is all about."
He kissed down Steve's cock before suckling the head, easily taking him down his throat. Steve gasped as Tony took him in, falling back against the desk to hold himself up.
Steve smiled at the compliments fondly. "Just takes a good recipe and plenty of practice. Thank you." He hummed, taking Tony's hand and rubbing it back softly.
"Sounds good." Steve hummed, kissing Tony's lips. "And it’s good to know I smell like something tasty, at least." He chuckled before leaning up to stretch. "There was a great blank wall in the studio, but we can find another space if you'd like it elsewhere in the house."
“Please don’t. I feel like I got hit by five trucks consecutively.” The blond grumbled into his pillow, refusing to move from his lying position anytime soon.
Steve's brain was buzzing with positivity at the thought, and if it was true, Tony probably could hear it. "That would be amazing if it was, Tony. But why would it just now start happening?"
"No need to beg, love." Steve hummed, removing his fingers. He moved Tony where he was laying back on the bed, pulling him into a heated kiss before moving to slick up.
Down in the lab, Tony ripped his goggles from his head, staring at the contraption in front of him. The upgrades had been easy and were already sent off, giving him ample time to work on Project Firefly. Grabbing the device, Tony carefully set it on the floor before stepping onto it, grinning as the metal boots quickly climbed up and clicked into place.
This is set 5 years after the previous chapter, so Steve is about 25 while Tony is about 23. Steve has become quite popular in the art world while Tony makes money as an inventor and engineer.
Steve laughed softly at that, kissing gently at Tony's neck. "Both these statements may be true, but I know you love it," he purred.
Tony moaned loudly, scratching at Steve's back. Steve gasped out at the nails down his back, shaking his head softly.
"That is one of the most adorable things I have seen." He grinned, heading over to the duo. "You are so sweet to him. Its precious."
"You're the artist, honey. Wherever you think is good," Tony replied, cracking his neck before shuffling out of bed, "And I
“Bruce does yoga. I bet he could give us lessons if we asked," Tony murmured, pushing his empty plate away, "Remind me to write down 'wood floors' for the house. I've always wanted a room with floor-to-ceiling mirrors with a wood floor."
"I just can't help it, Sir." Steve replied, blush growing brighter. "I'm just a glutton for your punishment, I suppose.”
The text binged only a minute to later, to which Tony turned off the computer and headed back to the bedroom.
"Is it okay if I pick them up tomorrow? I wanna get him home," Tony asked, gently taking Peter into his arms.
Tony laughed, curling up to Steve's side. "We can take a shower later and continue this," he snickered.
"Peter, will you wait out here for a couple minutes? I need to talk to Daddy in private for a moment, okay? Then we'll go to bed." He promised, smooching the boy's temple.
"Who says I tried to be subtle?" The blond murmured behind his blush at his partner. "I realize subtlety is not my expertise, but I didn't expect you to see the answers. You rarely ever do."
"Don't know about that, but he is. So smart for his age, but still has a child's mindset." Steve hummed. "I'm perfectly fine with that, of course. He should be a child right now."
"It is. He was a good brother and a...dear friend to me for many years." The eldest murmured. "It is deeply tragic to us both."
"God, you worry me. Don't fall over, please." Steve chuckled nervously, following close behind him until Tony made it closer to the bed.
"Spoiled. Spoiled rotten." Steve whispered back with a small twitch of a smirk on his lips. "Well, you go and make Peter breakfast like you said you would and ask him about going to Bucky and Nat's, and I'll text Bucky about it while you do that. Fair?"
"Well, he certaintly is a cute one, Mr. Stark. Just a bit scrawnier than I thought your type would be, eh?" The man admitted with a hum, making a circle around the blond.
He nodded, scooting past Steve to practically bolt up to their bedroom, stashing the his secret gift away before laying everything out on the desk, fingers gently running over the silk ties. Steve chuckled as he headed upstairs not too long behind Tony, slinking into the room slowly and closing in on Tony.
"I love you too, Steven," Tony breathed, tucking his head under Steve's chin, "As cheesy as it is, I love you to the moon and back. Which is over a hundred thousand miles of string. Probably more. I love you more times than the speed of light, than the size of Andromeda, than any calculation I could do to give you an infinitely large number--"
much. Love you very much..." Steve responded sweetly, nuzzling his face gently. He trailed kisses down along his husband's neck, sucking softly in different places.
"He just really likes your beard, Tony. He might just tell you're you by that." Steve chuckle softly as he made the plates.
"Laid? Papa wasn't laid by a chicken, dummy," Peter interjected, startled by the laughter from the adults, "What?"
"Sammy's sleeping right now, but I'm sure he'll join us later," Tony laughed, scooping the little bear into his arms, "Yeah?"
"Take one day at a time, sweetheart," Tony murmured, "They'll be babies for a while-- no making me cry right after that, god, Steve, you know just how to poke at my heart."
"What, I can't kiss my son in public?" Steve grinned, booping their noses together for good measure. "C'mon, we'll get ice cream, the shark and the penguin, and go from there."
"Well, I mean, little kids can't bathe by themselves, Steve. Not safe." Tony rested his head on Steve's shoulder, hand on Steve's abdomen. "I love this place," he murmured.
“I could look at you walking like that forever," Tony hummed, standing up and letting the water drain, "God, you're adorable." He took a towel from Steve, giving him a quick kiss.
Tony made another 'bleh' noise, laying down so his face was in the covers. "Mm-mm," he replied in a negative muffle.
The brunet twitched his hips up into Steve's hand, trying to set a quicker pace which thankfully the blond caught on to. Moans and soft 'Atta' boy's left his lips as he felt that familiar heat begin to build in his lower belly, thankful noises following as Steve continued to quicken.
"Sometimes bubby likes to be by himself. He's getting near the age he doesn't wanna always hang out with his Daddy and Papa." He said softly, blowing kisses back at the baby.
Tony shrugged again, letting an awkward moment pass by before stepping out of the room, comforted in hearing Steve's footfalls behind him. He signed himself out and made his way to the garage, looking for a familiar car. Once Steve got him in the right direction, he curled up in the passenger seat, still quiet as ever.
"We might need to wait until Sammy is a bit bigger, Pete." Steve stated with a sigh. "Then we might get a small to medium sized puppy."
"S'kay. Unca C'int tawks like dat all d'time wiff Unca Buck," Peter replied, breaking off a piece of his cookie, "I don' mind."
. Steve thought through the bond, humming deep in his throat as his nose brushed against dark tufts of hair.
He smooched Steve's lips and stood from the mattress, padding over to the back of the garage to drag out the collapsible gazebo, easily setting it up over the mattress. He blew out the candles before climbing back into bed, snuggling back up to Steve.
"Chocolate lube and silver nipple rings," Tony grinned, "I didn't think he'd actually get me those, but hey! It's all good."
"I know we have to get married first. I'm just excited for it." Steve grinned back at him happily. "I never thought that I would get the chance to do all of this until I met you, so yeah. I'm very excited."
Tony pushed himself away from his work, grabbing his phone and staggering to the steps, tromping up from the basement to the kitchen to get a drink. He carried his large glass of ice water up to his bed, smiling tiredly at the blond awake in bed.
He scooped the boy up in his arms and smooched his cheeks. "Let’s get you cleaned up and cozy. We'll be back, Daddy." The blond smile, taking the boy to the bathroom.
Steve's lips were then pressed against Tony's, the kiss soft and a tad hesitant at first but then becoming a little more confident. When they parted, the soldier moved a hand to cup Tony's cheek, smiling back to him fondly.
Steve nodded back, humming in thought. "If you'd like it, then we can try the power play thing sometime." He said quietly. "And the couch sounds fun. Definitely was quite a way to wake up." He chuckled.
"A lot can happen in two seconds. I just worry because he's so little and new to the world and fragile and--" Steve stopped when Tony gave him a look as they set the bassinet back up. "I know. I'm a worry wart. But I can't help it when it comes to family. "
before that feeling lets off. Now how do you think the way those boys would be raised would be effected by the sudden death of one father and the perpetual mourning of the other,
"Good. I'm already planning things, so after Christmas, Clint and I'll go bear the crowds and get some stuff. Do you prefer champagne or white wine?"
"I can tell why Pepper would've been mad." Steve said with a weak chuckle, moving Tony's hand to his cheek and nuzzling it gently.
"You can just call me Tony, by the way. Mr. Stark is my dad." he explained. "Oh! And the bot's name is DUM-E."
"We could see if the others would take the kids one night? So we could have us time." He offered as a suggestion.
Tony just kissed Steve harder, trying not to laugh at the boy's protests. He only pulled back when he felt his lungs start to beg, and even then, Tony peppered Steve's face with little kisses.
"Oh, you will." Steve warned with a smirk. "I know I'm going to take some any chance I get." He pointed out, sitting next to his family. "Unless Sammy ends up being oddly quiet, there will be plenty of naps had for Daddy and I when chances arise."
Tony buried his face in Steve's chest, trying to envelop as much of the man in his arms as he could.
"This'll be more comfortable than that couch for this. Plus the en suite's in here to help clean up afterwards." The brunet hummed, undoing his tie at least and kicking off his shoes. "Okay, Stevie. You don't have to undress completely, but I do need you to take off your pants and underpants for me, okay? Then up on the bed, above the covers."
"You teachin' me how ta draw?" Peter asked curiously, grabbing a pencil. "I figured Papa'd do that."
"Aw, Tony." Steve said with a warm chuckle, wiping at the tears at the corners of his husband's eyes. "It's going to be a step up from what we had to do with Peter, but we will be damn
"As far as I know, that's his only problem. Being sticky." Steve hummed, starting to scrub Peter up carefully. "Are you okay other than that, Petey?"
Tony whined loudly, whimpering as he snapped the panties off from his hips to sink completely onto Steve. "Baby, please, fuck me," He moaned loudly, rolling his hips back, "Please, Steve, need you--"
"Nat, Clint, and I's marks would've matched if I hadn't lost my arm. But I remembered the writing." Bucky answered softly.
