(See the end of the chapter for
When Dean got out of the hospital he took his keys and started Baby and went straight to college. The class started around 5 minutes ago so he's not missing to mush. A little bit later he parked his car at one of the only spots left. He is running in the building looking for his class, he didn't remember what building he had to be in so he took a look at his phone where his classes are all lined up, of course that was because Cas told him to do that. He was in the correct building but he needed to go the other way, so he did that and looked for his class.
Dean was cleaning his room and getting the extra bed ready. Cas was going to sleep in his bedroom so it had to be a little bit cleaned up. Sam was helping his mom in the kitchen. Mary was making a list for Sam to get for Chuck. Cas had send  list of some thing that his dad would need. He could also not eat everything because it makes him sick. Mary made a special Christmas dinner that would not give Chuck any problem. When the list was done Sam took his keys of his car and went to the store.
"Hey Dad, how are you doing?" ... "That's good, I have a question about thanksgiving. Do you remember my friend Dean?" ... "Well he want's to invite us for thanksgiving. What do you think about that?" ... "Okay Dad I will tell him that, do you have something else to talk about?" After that Dean didn't really payed attention to the phone call.
"You guys ready? We go in, kill them and then we run to the car and leave. It's a busy street here so we have to be fast." Dean said while making himself ready to go in.
When Castiel and Gabe got back with the drinks Charlie and Dean were talking, "Take you drink lady and gentleman." Castiel got the feeling Gabe is already drunk. "What do you two think, what if we go to my place after the party and get more drunk?" Gabe looked at him and then back at Castiel. "I don't know, Cassie what do you think?" Gabe said concerned, "I'm not going but if you want to it's fine by me." Gabe nodded. "So, who's going? Charlie, Gabe and what about you Dean?" Gabe asked while turning to Dean. "I'm not going, I'm going to bring Cas home when he wants to go back." Gabe nodded. "You don't have to Dean, you can go with them I will call a taxi or something. You don't need to throw away fun because of me." Dean was angry at Castiel for saying that. "Cas don't be ridiculous, I don't mind bringing you home." Dean looked really annoyed. But Gabe started talking so they al started talking.
"I don't know what's happening and I think it is wise to call Rowena. Maybe she can help."
30 minutes later and Castiel was still unconscious and Gabriel couldn't stay in the room much longer so he went to grab some coffee for them.
Dean laughed a little, Castiel didn't understand he just did something stupid and Dean is laughing? "Thank you, I never found it special but maybe I'm thinking about it now." Castiel laughed "You're welcome" he said. Then the professor walked in, Castiel hoped he wouldn't show up at al because he would like to know more about Dean.
Dean made his room ready before Cas and Chuck would arrive. He didn't like cleaning his room but now he couldn't just leave his clothes on the ground or somewhere that isn't his closet. Dean went downstairs to grab a drink but he's going to wait with the beer, that's for later. He just sat down in the cough and their was a knock on the door. Dean went to open the door, now they can start Christmas. "Hey Cas, Cuck, welcome." Dean let them in with a big smile. "Hey Dean, how are you all doing?" Cas asked while putting down his bag and taking his father's. "Hey, we're good Cas. What about you two?" Mary askes coming out of the kitchen. Sam was on the stairs, he was in his room talking to Jess probably. "We're good, thank you. The only thing that changed is my hair." Chuck always had to make a joke about something, Cas had warned Dean that he would joke about his hair or his cancer. "I thought I saw something different." Sam joked, "Well food is nor done yet, what if Castiel and Dean go upstairs and put the bags in the rooms and we can talk a little bit in the kitchen while they talk upstairs." Dean and Cas took the bags and went upstairs.
He was thinking if he should leave the Cassie in but it was to late, not that it was a problem. He went to sleep after that hoping Cas had a good time today.
Dean listened to Cas and he was really good in doing this kind of stuff. Maybe he is right. If I quit now that money is kind of burned away. When Cas finished Dean nodded. "Thank you Cas, because of you wise words I will stay. But if I stay I have one question because I don't think I could make it otherwise. "Dean you know you can always ask me anything." Dean nodded. "Would you mind help me study? Like we can video call or just a normal call and in the weekends or something at one of our places? If you don't want to that's okay, I understand." Cas laughed, "Of course I will help you. I would love to do that and I can  also help you with subjects that I don't have because it's not that hard. We can make like a list for when we just call and when we come over." Cas was excited because Dean knows how mush Cas loved it to help people, maybe it would be better if he would study to become a teacher. "I would like that Cas, thank you." "It's no problem Dean."
When Dean looked at his phone to check the time it was already past midnight. "Hey guy, thanksgiving is over, it's 1:56AM. We didn't even heard all the stories yet." Cas now looked at his phone looking at the clock. "God yes, if you don't mind dad I would like to go back to the hotel. I'm not used to going to sleep late and I'm going to feel that tomorrow." Chuck stood up.
"Why do you care more for her than for me?" That was the thing he asked them. They didn't knew what to answer because it came out of nowhere. Then I said "It's because they blame you for your mother's death." It came out of me without thinking. "Why?" It was the only thing he could say, he was looking at his feet. "Because she died short after you where born, you know that but I also told you that her death is not your fault. And you know what, if they can't treat you like their grandchild then we will leave now." When I saw their faces I knew I should leave and we did and the best part of the story is that my sister came with us because she cares for Cas and knowing that our parents blamed him for something that he didn't do is just sad. It's kind of sad but if you look at it, it is kind of a nice story because my parents called later but I was like a year or 2 later. The said sorry and told us that they where stupid." Castiel took over. "They still say they are sorry for blaming me but I don't care. I had a good bond with my aunt and niece. I survived without them and they say they care but I know they don't"
When the class ended Dean stood up first. "Do you mind if I come with you, I don't really know anybody here and you look like a nice person to know more of." Castiel was surprised but also he kind of hoped Dean would ask something like that. "Yes sure, I'm meeting with my friends in 10 minutes, you can come and meet them, but if you don't want to that's ok to." Castiel said that while he was putting his papers away. "I would like to meet your friends, are they all so nerdy like you?" Dean laughed. "Charlie is also kind of nerdy but in a different way, she like star wars and more but I don't know a lot about it. One thing never call me nerdy, I'm just interested." Castiel said that with more confident then he ever had. Dean started laughing, "Ok, sorry for that. I like it, my brother is a little like you but you're smarter." Dean walked trough the door and waited for Castiel to walk out.
And with that Castiel stopped texting Dean waiting for him to arrive.
Dean was sitting in front of the door of the building, looking at the street. Cas made his promise true and he arrived shortly after the phone call. "Hey Dean, you really just locked yourself out of the building. That's not really smart you know." Cas couldn't hold his laugh while saying the words. "Very funny Cas. I'm not the one who just left without saying anything." Dean looked at Cas. "I didn't wanted to wake you up, it was really late last night. And you slept on the couch that is not really nice." Cas opened the door and they went inside and went to Cas' apartment. "I don't care, I don't need a lot of sleep. Normally I have enough with four hours." Cas placed the bags on the table. "Okay, sit down and eat while it's still warm." Dean sat down at the table and they started eating. Cas was right when he said he had food for the whole day, maybe even for two days.
Castiel opened the door of his apartment, he took of his shoes and went to take a shower. While he was showering he was listening to music. When he was done he putted on his pajamas and went to the kitchen to fill a glass with water. He returned to his room with the water and took out his phone and texted Dean.
Dean was happy for Sam he met a girl that's amazing.
They took there weapons and ran towards Baby. They putted everything in the trunk and went to their seat in the car. Dean behind the wheel, Sam shotgun and Cas in the backseat. They had a 4 hour drive in front off them so they got comfy.
Sam nodded and left to go get a bed ready.
Everybody took there colour and they started playing the game. Like Mary said she wasn't the best player but she was doing pretty good. The first game Sam won he was lucky that he build his village's at good spots. They where gonna play another game. Mary was getting better at this round, now it was Chuck who was having a bad game. This game Castiel won, he was a really strong player this round. Before they stared the next one Mary stood up, "I'm going to start making lunch, when I'm done you guy's will also be close to the end." She went to the kitchen and the boys cleaned her spot. While Mary was making lunch the boys where playing their last game of the day. This one was a little bit harder, nobody was having a lot of luck. The game took so long that Mary was already done with lunch. They weren't going to eat before the game was finished. Mary was helping Chuck a little bit and because of her helping he won the last game.
That night Castiel and Dean made a list for what day they will call and what they they meet and where. After that they where going over some stuff they saw in class today. They order pizza and ate while watching tv. "Do you think we are still going to be friends after college?" Castiel asked all of the sudden. "What? Why are you asking that? Of course, I would be stupid if I let a friend like you go." "I don't know it jus popped in my head and I was thinking about it for a while. Because Gabe kind of asked the same question but a little bit different. He ask if we would still be close friends if we would go to college. Back then we weren't sure if we would be in the some college. It just popped in my head that's all.
Dean arrives at his apartment 5 maybe 10 minutes later. He kicks out his shoes and he makes some coffee. While he's waiting he thinks how lucky he is with Cas as a friend. He cares for his friends more than anything, of course his dad but that's normal. Dean is thinking about something but kicks it out of his memory when his coffee is ready. When he is studying he's thinking to call Cas but that would be weird.
They where walking down the street in the moonlight on Christmas. It was a cold night but then again it was December so it's not that weird. "We have to go trough the woods for a little bit, it's not far anymore." Cas nodded and followed Dean trough the woods, when they where at the and of the woods there was a river. "Here it is, when it's night and there are no clouds it's the best. We're really lucky that that's the weather now. It's really beautiful." The went to the edge of the water. "It's really beautiful here." They sat down and listened to the wind trough trees.
After dinner they watched tv, there wasn't a lot except Christmas movies. After watching the second home alone movie Chuck went upstairs, it was getting late so everyone went upstairs. They said goodnight and went to their bedrooms. Mary was the last one to go because she was making sure every light and candle was out.
Dean and Sam where still fighting the vamps. They didn't knew Cas had been hit with a knife.
Castiel saw on Dean's face that he didn't want to do it but then he sawDean walking towards him. Dean took his arm and pushed him up against the wall. Castiel looked in the emerald green eyes of the handsome man and he could see that Dean doesn't want this. The he sees Dean bald his fist and bring it to his face but before he does that his lips say 'I'm Sorry' and then everything gets black for Castiel.
"Yeah yeah no worry. Just be careful in my baby."
"Yeah thank you Dean. Goodnight."
Dean sat down at a chair from the table. "No thank you dad. I came to get something for the extra bed, I think we forgot it. I hope you don't mind that I can't stay long." John sat down next to him. "No no, it's okay. Is somebody coming over? Probably no your girlfriend because she would sleep in your bed." Of course dad thought he was funny, I should've known he was going to do that. "No dad, it's a friends from college. He's staying here with his father. His father is going to sleep in guestroom and Cas is going to stay in my room on that extra bed you took with you when you went on a leave with mom." John nodded. "Ah yes, are they going to stay a long time because that bed is good for 1 or 2 night but not for a whole week. That boy will not be able to stand up, that bed is not the most comfortable thing." Dean didn't knew that. "Well they are going to stay till after New Year. I think that it will be a lot of fun to see that happen. Cas is not one of the bad boys, he's a nerd like Sammy. Do you know where the blankets for that bed?" Dean stood up. John followed.
"That's special, I like it, special is better then just a normal boring name like Sam. My brothers name is Sam but I call him Sammy, he doesn't like that." Dean laughed a little bit with that. "Dean is also a special name." Castiel said "I like you name to;"
Dean noticed Castiel opening his eyes. He stood up and called his name. "Cas, Cas can you hear me?" Castiel looked up at him with confusion. "I'm sorry Cas, I need to tell you something."
Cas putted his phone down and went to sleep. Before he was asleep he heard his phone, he got a message. And with that he knows Dean was safe and that he could go to sleep without any problem.
"Hey Cassie, hey Dean." Gabe took Castiel's hand and they went to take some drinks for the group. "How are you Cassie, you're at a party that not something you do a lot." Gabe asked, "I know I never really liked parties, they are so wild and busy and some many people. I'm not going to stay long I guess I'm already freaking out." Gabe took Castiel's shoulder, "Hey Cas no worry, just calm down, I'm here for you ok. Please don't have a panic attack here." Castiel laughed a little bit, "I will try my best. Let's get the drinks to the rest."
When Castiel arrived at his apartment he felt happy, not the feeling he was accepting to feel after the first day of school. He started working till it was 10PM, he only paused to eat at 7PM. He had some texts from Gabe asking how the rest of his day went, Gabe had left school around 2:30PM, Cas was still in his class till 3:15PM. He also had a call from Dean, asking something what they did last year, he didn't understand it. Castiel thinks he did understand it, he just wanted to talk to him. But Castiel doesn't think that for very long because their friends, friends talk so its normal, I guess? When Castiel is done he calls Dean. "Hey Cas, why are you calling? Are you studying?! God you really are nerdy, sorry interested." Dean laughed because of his mistake but Castiel feels like it was on purpose. "No, I just finished. What are you doing and do you understand the thing what you asked me earlier?" Castiel thinks he's stupid for asking. "Yes thank you for that, before you called I was planning to go to sleep, but if you want to talk that's ok for me." Castiel smiled a little bit, "No, I will let you go to sleep. Goodnight Dean." Now he feels stupid because maybe he waked him. "Oooh... ok good, Goodnight Cas." And the line went dead after that.
Castiel as getting ready for class when he got a text from Dean.
Dean answered quick
Then Castiel said it was almost 8:00 AM so they had to go to their classes. Castiel started the day with English. They al went their separate ways to their classes. When Castiel arrived he sat down more in the back. He was texting Gabe while he was waiting for his professor. He knows almost everybody in the class from last year. But then someone he didn't know walked in, he was wearing a leather jacket and a necklace. He looked trough the class and then looked at Castiel.
He saw his brother wipe his eyes.
Dean looked around and saw a chair, he took it and putted it next to Cas' bed and sat in it. He looked around to see if Sam was back but he was probably still calling Rowena. So he took the opportunity and took Cas' hand.
When Dean arrived Cas and Chuck weren't there yet. He took the blankets and went inside. Sammy was also back and his mom was still in the kitchen but she changed into other clothes. "I found it, dad helped me with it. I had to give you and Sammy a hug from him." Mary looked up, kind of shocked, just like dad. "He did? Was he drunk?" Why does his mom keep thinking that if dad says something nice that he's drunk. "No mom he wasn't. Why do you keep saying that every time he says or does something nice, it doesn't mean anything." Mary could see Dean was upset, "I know, I'm sorry but it's just that it happened some times when you visited." Dean nodded. "I know but he wasn't, he looked like he saw a ghost when he opened the door but after that he asked me questions and helped me find the blankets." "Okay, now make that bed ready, it wouldn't take long before they will be here." Dean went upstairs told his brother he has a hug from dad and went to his room.
(See the end of the chapter for
The last things he hears is the worried voice of Dean.
Sam and Cas both nodded. When they went inside there where 5 vamps, easy kill. What they didn't knew was that there was a with ready for them to come in.
When I got there I saw John and Dean walking. I went over them asking what was going on. They they showed me, his hear was stuck in the dried cast. So we went inside told hem what happened. They made the cast wet again waited a little bit and got it out of the hair and they gave Dean a new one. John had to shave his head because the stuff that a cast is made of was in his hair and he couldn't get out.
Dean was 6 so he wasn't really for dinosaurs anymore. After Sam got busy with his gift John gave Dean's present. His present were tickets to a concert from AC/DC. John always loved older music and so did Dean. In the first place I didn't wanted my son to go to a concert but the concert was when he just turned 7 so he would be a little bit older by then. Dean was really happy with it. So when they were getting ready John gave him a AC/DC shirt. Dean was so happy that he got his own shirt he ran down the stairs to show it to me. But he wasn't looking where he was going and he fell. He ended up going to the hospital, he had a broken arm.
Thank you for reading.
The next day Dean was the first to wake up. He stood up and went to the kitchen to grab himself a cup of coffee.
Dean pulled up at the house. His dad's car was at the driveway. He took a deep breath and stepped outside the car. He knocked at door. After some time his dad opened the door. "Hey-a dad, how are you?" Dean asked while his father was looking at him. It looked like that his had seen a ghost. "Hey, Dean. I'm, I'm good, thanks. How, how are you?" Dean smiled a little, he never heard his dad stutter. "I'm good dad. I came to get something but I didn't know you were going to be home. If I knew I would've brought something. Can I come in?" Dean asked while his father still saw a ghost. "Yeah, yeah of course come in. Don't worry, do you want something to drink?"
so he said it back. After he reacted to all of them it was time to look at the one from his father.
While heir were driving Dean was humming to the music, Castiel was just listening to both. The drive to the grocery store was short, Castiel was happy that Dean helped him to get there because when they arrived it's start raining really hard. The both of them rushed in the store to get to a dry place. "You're lucky I brought you here or you would be drained." Dean laughed a little bit but was also breathing heavy from their small run. "Yes, thank you for that. Now let's go and grab food and something to drink and then we can go back. I don't like really grocery shopping." Castiel stared walking.
"Who has space left for the dessert?" Mary asked because otherwise it was going to be to late. "I do!" Dean was the first one, he knows what it is and of course he keeps space for it. "I can too but just a little bit." Chuck was the second one and he stood up to help Mary. "I don't know, I think I'm going to pas mom. Sorry." Sam was full, everybody understands it because dinner was really good. "I have a little bit space left so I will have a little bit. Can I ask what it is?" Castiel asked because if it was something big he couldn't eat it, he already ate to mush. "You will see Castiel. No worry I think you have enough space left. It will be served in a minute." Dean was laughing because he knows what it is but he knows Cas is going to like it because it's his favorite.
When Castiel went in the bathroom he changed, after he changed he checked his phone. He has some texts from friends. He texted all of them back and started brushing his teeth. It's weird to celebrate Christmas somewhere else, almost his whole life it was just his dad and him. He like's it that it's different now. He picks up his stuff and went back to the bedroom. When he entered the room Dean was sitting on his bed looking at his phone. "Something wrong?" Castiel asked, "No it's nothing. Just got a text from my dad. Didn't expected that." Dean putted his phone down. "Well maybe that's going to be the new thing he does. Maybe when you visited he missed it." Castiel took his bag and took out his charger. "Yeah maybe."
'What if I ask my mom if she finds it okay that Cas and maybe his father celebrate Thanksgiving with us. Then I could be with Cas and his father. I would meet his father and he would my brother and parents. First we go to say hey to dad because he's still my father and then we go to mom. Sammy is going to be home then so he is going to be happy that Cas and his father are with us.' Dean snapped out of it when he heard a noise coming from the tv, it started playing again. He stood up and tuned the tv of. He looked over to Cas, he's still sleeping. Dean took Cas' blanket and putted over him.
The moment Cas walks into the room Dean knew something was wrong. Cas was unsteady at his feet and was looking weird, like he was at a different world.
"Yes but it's not a story like the one Chuck just told." "That's no problem. I would love to know a little bit of Dean's past." Mary nodded. "Okay this one is a funny story I believe. Dean was 6 years old, Sam was almost 2. They were playing together when John came home. John had a surprise for them. We told them to sit down in the cough. We gave Sam his present first, it was a dinosaur packet. He loved dinosaurs a lot and it was something that he could discover his own dinosaur when he would play in the sand.
When they were done Dean had to ask Cas about thanksgiving. "Hey-a Cas, I have a question?" Dean didn't looked at Cas until he spoke up. "You know you can ask me anything Dean, is there something wrong?" "No no, nothing to worry about I was just thinking, maybe you would like to spent thanksgiving with me and my family and of course you're father." Cas stayed quiet for a long time, Dean was afraid he scared Cas with asking.
When he looked at Gabriel he saw something that he wouldn't expect, tears. "Dean, I don't know what to say, I know Cassie is not going to like it but he likes you too, in that way." Dean looked shocked, he didn't knew that. "Listen, I will tell the nurses that you are allowed in his room so you can be there when he wakes up. I don't know how long I can stay in that room looking at my little brother." He nodded. Gabriel went to a nurse asking for his brother, she said the doctor will be with them soon and after that they can go to Castiel.
Dean was really nervous to meet Cas' father because he doesn't know what he looks like and he doesn't know what to say to him. He hopes that Chuck is going to tell some good stories about Cas when he was younger, he does hope his mother isn't going to do that. Dean and Sam are helping their mother in the kitchen. "Dean can you put the oven on please, otherwise the turkey isn't going to be ready when we're going to eat the rest." Dean nodded "Sure, no problem." Dean putted the oven on and went back to making the cranberry sauce, his mother didn't really trust him on one of the big projects.
Since then they wait until they know it's a friend. Dean got out of his daydream when he heard a knock at the door. He went downstairs and saw his mom and brother ready for the company. He opened the door and saw Cas standing there. Next to Cas was a man around the same height as Cas and they looked a lot alike. "Hey Cas, Mister Novak nice to meet you." Dean said while he let them inside. "You don't have to call me Mister, just call me Chuck. And it's nice to meet you to Dean." Cuck gave Dean a hand and Dean nodded.
"Ok, let's grab a six-pack of my favorite beer and we can eat pizza and watch a movie if you like?" Dean grabbed a soda. "Sure, but we can't get drunk because we have classes tomorrow. What movie would you like to watch?" He was looking at Dean, what should they eat? "I don't know, what do you think about the hunger games? It's lame but I really like it, sorry." It looks like Dean is blushing, Castiel has never see him blush like that before. "I haven't seen the hunger games before, it looks so cruel. But I can't really judge something if I haven't seen it yet." Dean was grabbing his beer and some other drinks. "Are you going to drink al of that? You are going to be sick after that amount of sugar, Dean what's wrong?" Dean looked worried at Castiel. Dean looks at Castiel, "Nothing, I was just thinking about something but it's nothing to worry about, really Cas. What do you think about a good steak, I can make it together with some fries if you want?"
“Angels? Okay. I still don’t see where you’re going—”
“That’s a lot of work to blame yourself.” Castiel tried a thought experiment. “Would you accept it if I told you it was my fault?”
He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
Dean approached slowly, forcing himself to remain calm for his brother’s sake. Entering Heaven was a frightening event, and he didn’t want to make it any more frightening.
“You know what’s weird?” Dean asked, then answered himself. “Not having days.”
“Well, Chuck always was a liar. They could all be rebellious little shits.”
. The whole Warrior of God thing... That’s a… good look on you.”
“No, but I would have forgiven him,” Dean said. “And I wouldn’t be here feeling like shit for sending my own father to Hell.”
“You’re avoiding Sam. You’re avoiding Bobby. You’re avoiding Mary. They’re all worried about you. They don’t know I’m here. When they ask for me, I don’t go to them because that’s what you told me to do—”
Rage broke down into sorrow. Dean came to be seated on the ground, sobbing, certain that his best friend hated his guts. His best friend whom he loved in every way a soul could possibly love. He could curse and hit things all he wanted, but at the end of it he was a coward, and he hated himself.
“Why?” Castiel asked.
Jack looked toward his fathers and raised his hand in a cheery, awkward wave.
Sam repeated the spell from before, Dean slammed down another vial of blood, and a rift in the empty opened before their eyes. Through it, all three could see the dilapidated barn.
“That went well,” he muttered in bitterness. This was some Heaven, all right.
Sam blinked rapidly, as if trying to clear his vision. He and Castiel had grown old, together. “You’re so young.”
After a few more drinks and more than enough despair, he gathered the courage to force another conversation. He had to. He felt like shit. More importantly, Cas felt like shit. He might not be able to help himself, but Cas was something he could actually do something about. Helping him was an objective, and having one of those wouldn’t hurt.
Castiel lowered his head and looked up with the self-aware face he made when he attempted humor. “Only as old as you feel.”
Dean wasn’t having it. “Truth or Dare?”
Dean was ghostly pale now. “I don’t think so, Sammy.”
“Treachery!” Charlie made her voice as dramatic as she could. “Only elves can wield bows with such accuracy. Ack!”
Castiel spoke simply. “Free will.”
“...Yeah. There is.”
Both men hugged her, and Dean excused himself. He needed out. Now.
Dean wanted to say something that would make Cas stay, but all that came out was an irritated “You can go.”
“Perhaps.” Castiel paused. “Perhaps freedom is a length of rope, and love is what keeps you from hanging yourself with it.”
Dean stepped even closer, to where their faces almost touched. “I know, you doofus.”
Sam swung his own door open and joined his brother on the side of the road.
Dean bit his lip for a brief moment, then let it out. “Dad’s in Hell.”
“Really.” Dean remembered something Castiel had said.
Dean’s mind replayed Cas, Charlie, Bobby, Mary, and now Sam all telling him he deserved good things. It replayed him telling his father the same. He tried hard to believe it again.
Dean answered by letting go of Castiel’s waist and raising their interlaced hands above his head.
Dean didn’t bother to take the Impala. He thought about the bunker and he was there, standing in its vast entrance, alone.
“Why can’t I rest?” The shadow hissed at Castiel. “
That caused Dean to break into hard, honest laughter.
Castiel didn’t let his objection get side-tracked. “I don’t have everything I want, Dean.”
Sam nodded. “Hi, Cas.” He then took a step back to let his brother and the angel have their moment.
Castiel eyed John with a scowl, but obliged, dropping him to the floor as hard as he could.
Castiel reached out and touched Dean’s arm. They transported outside and the sky around Dean went blindingly bright, as if he stood at the epicenter of a nuclear blast.
“Yeah, yeah. You just want to join the battle. Fine.” She pointed to a wide grass field. “The orcs are thattaway. We’re attacking shortly. You two need costumes.”
Dean pointed out an unfortunate fact. “I sold mine too.”
Dean’s voice was soft and raspy as he struggled to breathe. “It’s okay.” He reached a hand up to Cas’s and their fingers became entwined.
“I’m thinking Purgatory. I’ve got some unfinished business with vampire mimes.”
It didn’t work that way. It could never work that way. Pleasure gave way to pain, and fear, and Dean froze.
“I can’t heal you,” he said sadly.
Dean didn’t get such a graceful landing. When he let out a groan of pain, Castiel turned to find him lying on the ground with a piece of rebar jutting out of his chest. Dean’s hands fumbled at it as he registered what happened.
Dean forced a small smile that quickly turned pained. “Hell, though…”
Dean took a deep breath. “You know, I resented you most of my life. I mean, I loved you and I missed you. But you got to be dead. You got to be free. Now it turns out death doesn’t change anything.”
your question?”
They hugged.
Dean broke down at the admission, despite having not admitted anything. "It's my fault."
If John was going to keep getting in the way of that, he could stay in Hell.
. You wear yourself out already?”
Dean searched his vocabulary. “A pot of what? Cas, you gotta cool it with old testament talk...”
. That’s who I am. I took care of Sam. I’m taking care of you. I gotta take care of him.”
“No offense, Cas, but you always do.”
“Cas? Cas?” Dean’s voice rose with each repetition. “
When he was safely inside the Impala, Dean fell back into the seat, hard. He let out a deep, uneasy breath. He reached for the steering wheel, his hands shaking.
“Well, yeah.”
,” Cas warned.
Dean defensively raised his voice. “So what if I have? There’s no monsters to fight up here. What the hell else am I supposed to do?”
“So, uh… You wanna take Jack’s advice…?”
“You dragged me out of Hell. Of course I’m obligated to you.”
“Okay…” Sam muttered.
“You named your kid after me?” Dean asked.
“You sure? You don’t want to meet your nephew?”
“Well, I—”
A bright voice came from behind Naomi, instantly recognizable.
“I understand why—“
“I’m aware of it,” Castiel said. It was one of many things Metatron had ‘gifted’ him.
“I’m fine. I can’t exactly die again.”
“It does if you want it to. You’re free now.”
“That all you’ve got?” Dean asked.
Lectures from a monster.
“Well... if you’re gonna pray and not get a response, maybe it should be to someone you need to talk to?”
Dean slowed his horse. “The plan is… I’m not gonna worry about a plan. All of this—” He extended a hand toward their view of distant hills. “—is better than I deserve. I’m just gonna enjoy it til it all comes crashing down.”
“You’re
. You’re the only thing I have ever chosen, Dean, and I choose you without hesitation. To live and die with you would be apotheosis to me.”
Dean also knew that Sam needed to hear what happened before someone else tried to check in with John and ended up spreading the news. Mary was out of the picture, so it fell on him.
“I don’t know.” Dean, getting an idea, squinted. He knelt down next to Castiel and put a hand on each of his shoulders. A gentle shake. “Cas. You gotta wake up.”
“That’s him?” John wondered. He looked at the angel with hatred. “Who the hell do you think you are barging in here—”
Sam pieced the story together. “And Lee never came around again because—”
“Angels can’t harm souls that belong in Heaven,” Naomi said. “Believe me, it would be a lot easier to convince Castiel if I could hurt you.”
“Stop.”
Dean spoke with bravado. “
“I’m bad at Heaven,” he said. “I’ve only ever done things for other people. Even if I know what I want, I never let myself have it. I make everything a mission. You remember when I spent a year with Lisa and Ben… It wasn’t me being happy. It was me pretending to be happy because I told Sam I would.” Dean swallowed. “I need you to know that’s not what this is.”
“Am I in your way?” Castiel asked.
not happy. I’m trying to be, but I want more. I’m just—”
Dean scoffed. “Let’s just watch the movie, man.”
“Driving you away.” Dean swallowed. “Forever.”
“Yeah. I have never been gladder I died young,” Charlie said.
,” Dean said.
“What? Why not?”
“It’s not weird,” Sam insisted.
Out of ideas, Dean knelt down on the porch and prayed softly.
Dean grimaced, not sure what to expect.
“What?” Dean blinked a few times.
Sam leaned forward and put his hand to his chin. “Actually…”
Dean shrugged. “I wager there’d be a lot of dead bees.”
“What do you think the word ‘love’ means?”
Sam doted on life itself. Dean had never heard his brother so excited to describe anything but serial killers and lore. An entire lifetime’s worth of dogs were each “such a good dog.” The Impala just would not die, even by the time she was transferred to Sam’s grandkids. And, oh, the grandkids. Those were the best things ever, according to Sam. It was also strange to hear from a Sam who looked like a man in his thirties. Apparently in Heaven, everyone looked the age they wanted to, which raised some questions about Bobby choosing to be an old curmudgeon, but this wasn’t the time or place.
By the time the song ended, Dean’s lips were on Castiel’s for the first time. They came together softly. The electricity that normally filled the air when Cas appeared now moved between their lips. The warmness Dean felt every time he was around his angel concentrated itself in his mouth. He’d kissed hundreds of people, but none ever hit him like this.
John didn’t believe that, and neither did Dean. They sat in silence for what felt like forever.
“Thank you.”
Sam, already heading toward them, pulled out his phone and dialed 911.
Castiel swatted it away. “You’re unbelievable, Dean.”
“Yeah I do.” Dean only had so many coping mechanisms, and humor was as good as any.
Dean cut him off. “No. There’s no excuse. I was an obsessed bastard about keeping Sam safe, and I didn’t even think about you. You never needed me before, and I told myself you could handle it.”
That was a nice new anxiety to add to the pile. Dean swallowed.
songs?” Castiel asked.
Everyone showed up. Eileen, Jody, Donna, Charlie, Garth and his children... In all, there were probably a hundred hunters, some of whom the Winchesters had only met once. But Dean had made an impact on all of them.
“You know this is the reason they make books that are
“No. Why the hell would it be your fault?”
John shook his head. “I should have hit you harder.”
“Jesus,” Dean muttered to himself. “I, uh…”
“If we’re being generous,” Sam said.
“Well, I’m sorry I made you uncomfortable.”
“Don’t people typically dance to
Before they’d stepped even a few paces forward, a barrage of rubber-tipped arrows flew toward them, bouncing off their armor.
“Tell me.”
“The other Cas. The one you’re basically married to?”
“Yeah. We are.” Dean looked Cas over. “You sure you’re good? No angels in your airwaves?”
“Ooh, were you a criminal or something?”
“What happened to you?”
It continued long enough to provoke Cas into speaking. “So... what did you want to talk about?”
He knocked on the door of an adorable, cream-colored farmhouse with a wraparound porch.
“Welcome back, boys,” Ellen said.
“Thank you.”
“Uh… Lee and I hit it off. A lot.” Dean paused to steel himself. “We started making out and, well… Dad came back early to find his son knocking boots with a good ol’ country boy. He… he was furious.” Dean stopped and his eyes lost their focus.
Sam was angry, but not at his brother. For Dean to turn his back on family, something horrible must have happened. His face softened slightly. “What did he do this time?”
The entwined hands became more and more soaked with blood. Time moved so slowly for Castiel now. But there was no point in articulating what he was feeling. He did what he could do: let Dean feel his presence and know that he was loved. He simply kept one hand with Dean’s, and used the other to stroke the side of his face. It was
“If Chuck could be a D-list author and God at the same time, you can be our kid.”
Dean scowled. “No, I’m not surprised. I’m
He hopped in and started the engine. The radio was playing “Carry on Wayward Son.”
Charlie put a hand up in surrender. “Okay. Okay. But—”
His mind reminded him that he would always drive the people he loved away. He moved to a nearby bookcase and toppled it, sending texts sailing across the floor. It wasn’t cathartic. That didn’t stop him from finding the next bookcase and doing the same. Another chair. Another bottle. It was all pointless.
Castiel turned to Dean. “This plot is convoluted.”
“This is what it’s all about,” Dean said.
Dean shook himself back to reality. “Why?”
“Do you trust me?”
“Dean—”
Dean’s mind wanted to reply with something sassy, but his mouth could only gasp.
Sometimes, when he was playing fetch with Miracle or developing a new recipe in his kitchen, Dean felt a sudden warmth in his chest. The same feeling he had when he kissed Castiel in the Empty. He chalked it up to sentiment.
“Yeah.” Dean faked a smile. “Forget I said anything.”
Castiel knew he’d never have it if they didn’t deal with this. He tightened his grip on Dean’s hand. “I’ve got you, Dean.”
“Because it’s my Heaven, and it’s what I want to do. What I’m not gonna do is sit there while dad dotes on you and his grandkids and treats me like the piece of shit I am. I don’t need it.”
“Well, you don’t have to worry about that.”
Castiel glanced down at himself. “I’m wearing the same outfit you are.”
of years old and I’m still afraid of my father. I worry
“Jack,” Dean corrected.
Castiel crowded his ornaments in a small cluster near the tree’s base, a loose interpretation of a carbon atom. By all conventional standards, it looked terrible and left the rest of the tree more bare than it should have been. But by Dean’s standards, it looked great because Cas did it, and because it was hilarious.
Bobby waved a hand in surrender. “I get it. I won’t tell no one. Not my business. You’ve got a lot to navigate. Anyone asks, you’re just fine. You’re on a... spa retreat for the soul.”
Dean noticed that Cas was hiding his hands behind his back. He tilted his head in suspicion. “What were you even—”
Dean didn’t linger in the applause. He hurried off the stage, and Castiel followed close behind.
Dean interrupted with a heavy sigh.
“Are you supposed to steal questions?” Castiel asked.
“You sat in the bunker for
Dean gestured outward. “Then why are you here?”
“He’s at peace, Dean. You heard Jack.”
“Cas?” Dean wondered.
The more human Castiel became, the better he got at sarcasm. “Yes, and that was clearly effective.”
“You see me as an obligation?” Castiel’s face fell.
The record player moved on to “You Don’t Fool Me.” They paid it no attention. Dean moved a hand to Castiel’s cheek, as if he needed to hold on or he’d lose him again. They kissed harder, their tongues colliding in something they’d both wanted for longer than either of them knew. Cas reached for Dean’s shoulder—
“I’m not particularly adept at it,” Castiel said. “But yes. To some extent.”
“I have a question. It may be insensitive.”
“I do have power, though.” Jack snapped his fingers, and she disappeared.
Sam was hurting, and it made him hurtful. “Wow. Guess he really meant a lot to you, then.”
“Yeah, okay.” Dean sulked.
“This isn’t about you. I’m very happy with our arrangement.”
His brother pried a little. “Anything you want to talk about?”
Castiel tried to offer help. “I can take those memories from you, if you want.”
If their positions were reversed, Dean would have had some choice words for their situation and the utter unfairness of it. But Castiel understood it. Help would either arrive on time, or it wouldn’t. It was out of his hands. Unsure of what to say, he rambled a little. “Apotheosis is... I was trying to say that... I feel more divine with you than I ever did in heaven, Dean.”
Sam sighed. “I’m never telling Charlie anything ever again.”
He stayed. There was nowhere else he wanted to be.
Dean intentionally kept his eyes on their arms or feet as he guided Cas. He didn’t know what would happen if he looked into the angel’s eyes while they were doing something as intimate as dancing. Actually, he had a good idea what would happen, and he wouldn’t allow himself to go there. For the first time in forever, he was enjoying himself. Just being with Cas was enough. It didn’t need to become any more complicated. That’s when he would ruin everything. He told himself it was exactly like Cas said: “Happiness isn't in the having. It's in just being.”
He set out from the bunker knowing the visit would probably turn out to be a mistake, but he wanted to see his mother.
Sam sat down on the floor next to him.
“Now—”
“I don’t feel good about this. At all.”
“You know…” Sam started.
“So the universe would be fine if he himself didn’t have it for a bit. If there were something we could hold his power in for just a little while…”
Castiel reached up and touched the side of Dean’s face. The lights on the tree twinkled in the reflection of his damp eyes.
“Because what?” Castiel asked.
Castiel raised his eyes to meet Dean’s.
“You know why.”
loved him.”
brother and not
They stood in the Dean Cave, playing foosball. Cas scored a goal.
Dean mingled. He caught up with Ellen, Joe, Ash, Rufus, their original Charlie… It was nice. It was something Dean needed to heal. But it wasn’t Heaven. After a while, he’d had enough.
were amazing.”
Dean shook his head in disgust. “That’s not fair.”
Dean took another deep breath.
,” Dean huffed.
Castiel kissed Dean’s forehead, then wrapped him into an embrace. They disappeared from the field.
Dean eyed Cas, who was halfway through a PB&J and had managed to drip jelly down the front of his trenchcoat. Completely ridiculous, but devastatingly charming just the same.
“Bitch. What’s up?”
Castiel had felt young Dean’s pain and fear, and he felt it needed to be returned. John was already dead, of course. Cas couldn’t kill him. But he could batter his soul until it begged to be returned to Hell where it belonged.
“So what was your plan? Be in love with Cas and just never tell him?”
“Nice,” Dean said to no one.
“Have you ever made pie?” he asked.
. Even when there’s no reason you should. Even when there are countless reasons you shouldn’t. You care what happens to everyone. That’s not a flaw. It’s why I love you. But what is a flaw is thinking you need to
Dean exhaled. “I have more than I thought I did.”
“Pfft.” She gestured that she was over it. “I snuck away. That’s not on you. Plus... No shuffleboard!” She didn’t hesitate to move on. “So here’s the sitch. The shadow orcs are up to their old tricks, and they’ve taken four followers of the Moon prisoner. We have an alliance with the wood elves, for now, to get them back because we have the Tome of Regret that the wood elves need to revive their dead who fell in the Battle of Yonder with the Warriors of Yesteryear—”
“It’s
“Well, we never finished that game of Sorry…”
“It means my life is immeasurably better for having you in it. It means I would give anything to keep you in it, and that I put you before all others.” Castiel smiled, then let out an amused snort. “It means I’m a terrible angel.”
“One last hunt,” Sam replied.
Dean scrunched his face and thought for a moment. “Eliot.”
Eileen tilted her head and offered a sharp look. “Seriously?”
Castiel frowned. “I don’t know a single angel who looks like that.”
He rounded a corner and bumped right into another, shorter soul.
“So should you,” Balthazar said. He took a sip. “To be fair.”
“Yeah, okay.”
“I’m glad I couldn’t hear it,” Eileen said. “It hurt enough to watch.”
That hit hard, even if the premise that led to it was a lie. Dean, hoisted by his own petard,  responded only with a sad look.
“I can’t just sit here.”
“Well, you
“That’s Heaven for you,” Castiel said. Miracle scampered over and nuzzled his leg, so Castiel looked down at him. “Good dog.”
The angel reached for him. “What’s wrong?”
John shrugged his shoulders. “Were you protecting your brother or what?”
He placed the rolling pin on it, then guided Castiel’s hands to either side. He then put his own hands over the angel’s. Dean tried to ignore the electric feeling when they touched. He’d touched Castiel’s hands before, but it had always been in some dangerous scenario or another. This was different. It was comfortable. It didn’t hurt that Cas was literally touching his soul.
Castiel gave her a sad look. “Charlie, about your death—”
At some point, Dean drove to his parents’ house. John was away, as he had been for most of Dean’s life. Mary handed her son a cup of coffee and they sat in the kitchen talking, for hours, about what they’d been up to since they’d last seen each other. Soon, this became a regular occurrence, and it felt good.
“Not like that…”
For the first few years after Dean’s death, Cas, Sam, and Eileen lived in the bunker.
Dean looked up at nothing in particular. The stars swirled in the sky, as they always did in Heaven, but the novelty had worn off. He took a deep breath.
“I’ve been living with him. I know. The man I married—the man who should have been your father—died when I did. He was there in the old Heaven. I’ve been trying to bring him back, but...”
Dean sank deeper into the couch and exhaled. “Aw, crap.”
. I was a
“Good.” Dean faked a smile, then turned and continued calling out “CAS?”
“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Mary said.
“I haven’t heard from you in a while and I wanted to make sure you’re okay. Bobby said you were on a ‘spa retreat,’ which sounds a lot like a lie you’d tell him to say.”
Dean gave weak smile and an even weaker nod.
“You can have that,” Castiel said.
Sam’s voice dripped with sarcasm. “Yeah, okay.” He changed his tone and looked directly into his brother’s eyes. “We won, Dean.”
“And I’m a soul,” Mary said. Smart enough to recognize that she was longer beholden to human physics, she disappeared into thin air and reappeared behind Castiel, jabbing the angel blade into his stomach. She knew Cas, and she didn’t want to kill him. But she had to stop him and figure out what was going on. She had to protect her damaged little family.
Charlie put a hand to her mouth. “Aww. You’re dead and you’re gay panicking.”
He’d rearranged a table in the bunker to seat six. On one side, he sat next to Cas. Across from them sat Sam and Eileen. At either head of the table sat Mary and Jack. There would be more gatherings, with more family and friends, but following the last few years of his life, he needed this one in particular.
Dean scoffed. “I’m still figuring this out, Sam.”
Dean bit his lip. “I’m saying it too much, aren’t I? I don’t have a blueprint for—”
“Change back, man. Don’t make me drive horny.”
Castiel smiled at Dean’s enthusiasm, then his expression turned to one of concern. “Are you sure you’re ready to get out and mingle with other souls?”
“It’s complicated,” Dean repeated.
“Oh, it’s real.” Dean grinned. “It’s very real. Charlie just texted me about an event going on right now.”
Dean’s intentions weren’t the only thing Castiel questioned. The former hunter’s taste in movies was deeply, deeply concerning. The angel knew this, having endured hundreds of movie nights at the bunker on Earth. He’d seen
“Excuse me?” John was put off.
When Charlie couldn’t get him to stop, she yelled. “Hold!”
Dean broke away and crossed his arms. Every bit of suffering Cas had endured thanks to the angels was his fault, and the guilt of that overwhelmed him into a confession—
“Do tell,” Eileen said.
“I was under the impression you wanted a more difficult question than the one about pie.”
glad to hear that.”
Dean signed “sorry,” to Eileen’s surprise.
No words. Dean could only form tears.
Dean chugged half the bottle of beer, then smiled. “Never have been.”
“Why do you like pie so much?” Castiel asked.
“You should be. I know I am,” Dean said. “The way I treated you and Jack on Earth…”
“No. I don’t.” Dean knelt down and looked into John’s eyes. “I’m an angry, drunk sack of crap, but I’m not like you. I don’t beat the shit out of people I’m supposed to care about.”
“Well, I don’t quite know the deal with angels, but I’m guessing Sam’s alive. As for you... You’re in Heaven, Dean.”
“You didn’t tell me anything.” Sam reached for his brother’s shoulder, forcing him to meet his eyes. They were glistening with tears. “
Dean tried to delay the impending conversation with small talk. “This is a, uh… nice house you have here.”
Dean raised his brow. “
“My past is... complicated,” Castiel said. “And I lost the only person who could understand it. To be with anyone else would be to maintain a charade.”
Some time after their Truth or Dare session, Dean and Castiel were sitting in the kitchen over half-finished plates of pancakes when Dean asked a question that wasn’t prompted by a juvenile game.
“Cas?” he asked. “You here? ‘Cause all I’m seeing is the nuke scene from T2.”
. And he turned out just fine. In fact, you should listen to him.”
Dean shook his head. “Hell no.”
Dean rubbed his temples. “I’m tired, Sam. I’ll be fine when I get back to the bunker and get either a good night’s sleep or some coffee and pie. Or all three.”
Sam shook his head, amused. “I’m pretty sure I was asleep.”
.” Castiel apparated to Dean’s other side, fully clothed. He pulled a blanket over Dean to provide some small comfort.
Dean lied and told himself he wasn’t just inventing an excuse to touch Cas. He told himself it was all about the crust, which to be fair, turned out great. They eased it into the pie tin, filled it, and began crimping the top crust.
Dean looked at her and shook his head.
"Have you ever watched the bees?" he asked.
“You mean in Heaven?”
“Okay…” Mary eyed her son with suspicion. Dean had tensed up and sat rigid in his seat, an unfamiliar look on his face. Nervousness maybe, or fear? In appearance, Dean looked every bit the middle-aged man he’d died as, but in that moment he had the posture of a guilty teenager.
“Well, that wasn’t you, was it?”
Castiel walked over to the counter and stood across from Dean. He slumped forward and looked into the hunter’s eyes, heartbroken. “Dean. Stop.”
“I have nowhere else to go. You don’t need to flatter me.”
“I… Kind of. Yeah.” Dean braced himself.
“Are you okay?” Dean asked, shifting. “You look like you’re gonna either bend me over the counter or murder me.”
There on his porch stood Castiel, just as he remembered him, trenchcoat and all. Castiel looked up into Dean’s eyes.
“I don’t know,” Dean said.
“If I’m gonna be my dad, I may as well do the fun part.” Dean chugged.
“That’s sweet. Also a little weird.”
Dean lowered his eyes and stared at the scuff mark on the floor. He’d thought about how this reveal might go with any number of his friends and family, how it might change how his loved ones saw him. Bobby, he’d always thought, would be fine. And if Dean didn’t tell him, Bobby would soon figure it out. It was better to control the situation.
Castiel chimed in, in disbelief. “You want to hold Jack’s power in an artifact so he can get drunk without affecting the universe?”
“For not taking care of you when you were human.”
Sam pressed onward. “Do you trust yourself?”
Dean’s face turned to stone. “You proud of that one?”
“I’ll bet.”
Castiel turned away. “I suppose it doesn’t.”
“What is your plan?” Castiel asked. “We can’t ignore them forever. I don’t want to, and I know you don’t either.”
“I can’t…”
“No, it’s not. It’s... life.”
“How does Heaven have a
“When did you realize you loved me?” he asked.
Dean looked over at Cas, in the passenger seat.
“Is it not frustrating for you to start having sex and never finish?”
Bobby half-shrugged. “You go to Hell, you have a few orgies, you become a demon. Then you either don’t care that you’re in Hell or you pop up on Earth, get ganked, go to the Empty and sleep forever. Could be worse.”
“I can’t believe you never told me,” Sam said from behind.
In the time it took him to ask that question, Dean had finished. He grabbed another bottle.
Eileen got a job teaching at a school for the Deaf.
Castiel, dusting off his hands, turned to look at him.
Castiel shook his head. “Really?”
“So… Is this Heaven or Hell?” Sam asked.
“I wanted to get here sooner, but there’s a lot to take care of.” He looked at Naomi. “Like you.”
Claire, meanwhile, was busy hitting on Jo at the bar.
For a few pop-filled minutes, Dean Winchester was unencumbered by grief, doubt, and shame. If he weren’t dead, Dean could have been a professional singer. He hammed it up for the crowd, leaving the people who knew him stunned and those who didn’t thrilled.
“Yes. I am.” Castiel took another sip.
To make matters worse, he knew Cas felt the same way. Because of him. He remembered a fight he and Cas had once, long ago. He remembered what the angel had said then.
The angel followed him down the hallway. “
“He’s dreamy. You’re obviously into it. And you’re dead. There’s no world to save. There are zero obligations keeping you two apart...”
Dean answered that by grabbing the angel and pulling him inside. Dean hadn’t had this in far too long, and Cas hadn’t had it ever. They each took a quick moment to breathe. Then they moved in unison, their breath and hips alike synchronizing.
. What did you do?”
Castiel didn’t let him joke his way out of the conversation. “What does it mean to you?”
loved me. And then it sucked him and Billie in. The end.”
They didn’t discuss it further.
“I’m not sure, I…” Sam tried putting everything together. “You’re not thinking it’s your fault, are you? It sounds like he said his piece and now he’s content.”
There it was. This, Dean reminded himself, was why he’d wanted to stay in the bunker in the first place. There, he could control his words. Cas wouldn’t push him on this. Other people presented variables like... this. He silently cursed Charlie's name.
“I don’t understand. It’s been five years. Why now?”
“I know you do. No offense, Dean, but you’ve said that before. And then you kicked me out on the street when I was newly human and confused and most needed your help.”
That night, Dean drank like he hadn’t since he first reunited with Cas.
Sam and Dean sat down at a table, and Ellen set two beers in front of them.
“You’re not the only one trying to change,” he said.
Castiel raised his voice in turn. “
“Well, we have eternity. I guess we’ll see.” Castiel squeezed Dean’s hands. “In the meantime… Try not to be so hard on yourself, Dean. You don’t owe anyone but yourself anything.”
“What do we do?” Sam asked.
Dean gave a pained smile. “I told you this would all come crashing down.”
was able to end it. Your ‘son’ may have removed the tools we usually use to get the job done, but... I’ll end it again.”
Castiel didn’t care about John. He cared about his son. He scanned their new god for signs that anything might be wrong. “Jack... how are you?”
Castiel appeared, a bigger mess than before. He stumbled as he landed next to the other recliner. He braced himself against it and snapped, “What now?”
“I don’t know what I’m supposed to do here,” Dean said.
As Dean considered that, the generic rock ringtone again came from his jacket pocket.
As they made out, Dean’s hand slowly moved from the angel’s shoulder down his firm chest, then drifted to his shorts. Dean unbuttoned them. Overwhelmed by the desire to put Cas in his mouth, Dean pulled away from Castiel’s face and let his head fall to the angel’s lap.
“PB&J?” he wondered.
“Have you ever seen
With a crowd of LARPers looking on, Dean put a hand on either side of Castiel’s face and pulled him in for a kiss.
Sam could see his brother struggling, so he joked. “You mean, other than in Hell?”
“Cas, let’s just go,” Dean said, tugging him toward the door. Avoidance was another fine coping mechanism, in his mind.
“Because of
“I found Cas,” he said softly.
Castiel didn’t choose one. “What would comfort look like to you now?”
“I don’t know if it’ll help to hear this from me, but it’s okay to let yourself be happy,” Charlie said. “Nothing else really matters here. Heaven and all.”
“I know, but you shouldn’t have had to. I’m sorry.”
“Dean’s the angel’s bitchboy,” John sneered.
“There’s no follow-up questions in Truth or Dare, Cas.”
“I put her in the dungeon. You didn’t think I’d…” Jack’s eyes narrowed, and he spoke with assurance. “I wouldn’t.”
“With me and John? Yeah…Of course.”
“He doesn’t need to be
“Dean…”
“If you insist.” Castiel smiled and adjusted his armor before storming across the field. The marshal hadn’t said anything about using telekinesis to shirk arrows. Some elves were about to be in a world of pain.
Castiel hesitated, then spoke into the air, not quite at a shout. “Milk duds.”
“Of course,” Castiel said.
“You should know better than anyone that angels aren’t equipped to write their own path. We want God’s. We need it. Do you know how many angels are suffering right now? Do you care?”
“Not really. No. But it’s Charlie, and if there’s anyone in Heaven less likely to be weird about…
“Millions. Jack resurrected all of them. It was... necessary.”
Castiel was silent.
“He’s not—”
Dean was no melittologist, but he tried to connect the dots and ask about his angel in bee terms. “You think...
“You’re concerned now?” Castiel squinted and unleashed drunken, unhinged sass. “Are you sure there isn’t something else I can help you with?”
From then on, he prayed nightly.
“Well, supposedly God created everything and I’ve seen it all, as far as life goes. There was never any reason to visit the parts of the universe with nothing in them.”
“I didn’t think you were,” Sam said.
“No idea,” Sam said.
“I love you both. I have to go, though. I have like a million more angels to deal with.” He waved. “Have some great sex.”
“Anyway, he and Castiel both said they have the best funnel cakes in Heaven.”
The shadow scoffed. “There’s not much of that left.”
“Right.”
Castiel objected. “
Her voice broke, and she pulled back. “It does. When we were alive… All those times I spoke about missing John and—”
He couldn’t believe he’d said it, or that he believed it.
Sam looked into his brother’s eyes. “Hell’s not as bad as what you do to yourself, Dean.”
Charlie cancelled her hold with, “Lay on!”
. It’s not like we don’t have the time.”
Dean didn’t know when it happened, but Castiel was holding his hands in support. He looked down at their hands, then back up at the angel’s face.
Dean knelt down next to him. “I’m sorry. Back there—”
“I figured you had angel stuff to do, man. Guarding souls or whatever.”
“How many times have you seen your brother? Your parents? Bobby?” He gestured toward the Roadhouse. “You just came from there, so I assume you’ve seen Ellen and Jo. Maybe Rufus? Ash?”
“I know.”
“Shut up.”
Sam and Castiel were left sitting on the ground in shock.
“Good.”
Dean guided Cas onto a chair. “Tell me how I can help.”
“No kidding.” She didn’t hesitate. “What’s the deal with you and Castiel?”
“Sorry. Like I said, there’s a lot to fix. And the angels will not stop talking.” Jack stared at Castiel, and snapped his fingers again. “There. That should be better.”
“What he’s made about? Probably the time I caught him getting fucked by some little flamer, so I knocked some sense into him.”
Castiel had heard enough to understand. “He hurt you.”
. If Bobby can get in here, anyone can get in here. If anyone can get in here…” He trailed off, not wanting to think about it. His brain didn’t care. It taunted him with the fact that the bunker—the little spot in Heaven he’d claimed for himself—didn’t belong to him at all. It also registered the words Cas had just said to him, in horror.
“Milk duds?” Dean wondered. “
Dean squinted. “Bobby?”
Dean thought about it. His ever-present sense of dread was ever-present as ever. On some level, he was still certain that Heaven would come crumbling down around him. But there was Cas, knelt down on the ground contemplating bees. Dean smiled.
family. You and Sam and Jack… Mom. Bobby, Ellen, Jody, Charlie… Everyone.”
“—Now you can and you’re just gonna sit around drunk and moping?”
Dean dramatically set down his copy of
“There’s nothing wrong with Cas,” he said.
“I think so.”
Castiel put on his bad joke face. “Dean, he’s three years old.”
Jack’s eyes lit up. “You think we can have another movie night?”
everyone.”
“You did what?”
“That’s the Dean I know.”
,” Dean said. “Not gonna.”
He formed a fist and punched Baby’s door. It hurt, so he did it again. He did it over and over again, dropping closer to the ground with each hit. By the time his knees were on the ground, his hands were bloody.
“If you believe that, you’re stupid,” Dean said.
“What’s up, bitches?” Charlie, beaming as ever, greeted each of them with a hug. She scanned Cas with wide eyes. “Still hanging onto that vessel, huh?”
Dean growled his response. “Yeah. It did.”
Castiel smiled. “I’m good.”
The passage of time also varied with emotion. As on Earth, it went by more quickly for souls at ease. For Dean Winchester, each moment since his arrival had dragged, almost to the point of torment. One bottle after another marked the passage of time as he drank and waited in a facsimile of the bunker that was much colder than he’d remembered.
Dean shook his head. “How are we supposed to call this a win when Cas is trapped in the Empty?”
Naomi ignored the human. “Like it or not, Castiel, you are...influential. Others see you choosing a human and... well, we’re hemorrhaging angels. Next thing you know, we’ll be overwhelmed with nephilim. That’s not going to end well for anyone.”
Naomi sneered. “You don’t have any authority here, nephilim.”
Dean put Baby in park.
“How old was Sam when you died?” Castiel asked.
“How is Deanmas different from Christmas?” Castiel wondered. “Other than the date.”
Dean stood up and walked to the door.
Dean held out his palm. “Meaning?”
“What?”
“But why?” Castiel’s voice came out pained. “I killed you.”
Even more than that, he liked the plausible deniability of using his own collection. If he chose from any song that had ever existed, he’d choose a song that made him think of Cas, and then he’d have to explain why. Then there was the distinct possibility that it would end up being a Taylor Swift song. No. That wasn’t happening.
“Yeah, well… I’ve got time to figure it out,” Dean said.
“Well,
Dean looked up at him. “I’m dead. You’re gonna have to carry on without me.”
“You thought you could fight your way through, like you do everything.”
Castiel approached and placed a hand on the shoulder where his handprint once lingered. “I don’t understand it. You are
Castiel was left confused as to how someone as lecherous as Dean Winchester could fall asleep during a movie with so much nudity, and why Dean would pick such a movie in the first place. He gave up trying to figure it out. His eyes turned from the horrors on the screen to the beautiful human resting in his lap. He placed a hand on Dean’s shoulder and watched him sleep, hoping that—at least in dreams—Dean’s soul knew peace.
The angel’s eyes shifted as he worked through his thoughts, softly but still audible. “I always leave because I’m afraid I’ll ruin things, but…”
“You know what’s weird?” he said. “I am.”
Castiel shot him a don’t-make-me-smite-you look.
Dean blinked. “That’s not painful, right?”
Bottles clanked all around, and everyone began eating.
... are happy?”
“He seems like he’s doing okay, all things considered,” Sam said.
Dean gestured away from the picnic. “I’m gonna…”
“Good.” Dean shifted and sat facing Cas, legs crossed.
“Ow,” Sam complained, rubbing his side. “What a dick.”
“—No.” Dean’s face turned nearly as red as the flower. “Why?”
“Then you’re at least gonna talk to me. I’ve been talking to a brick wall over here.”
One by one, the beach cleared of people. Night came, and eventually Dean and Castiel were the only ones left. They lay on their blanket, looking up at the stars. Entire galaxies were visible, and their ever-changing positions were unlike anything on Earth—the universe’s best view.
Castiel tilted his head. “Do you want me to be?”
“I’m not sure what else I would wear,” Castiel said.
.” Sam couldn’t see the dead-eyed stare on Dean’s face, but he could hear the irritation in his brother’s voice.
“Another angel? Yes,” Dean said.
Dean scoffed. “Peace when you’re done, my ass.”
“Cas—”
Those words resonated with Dean, who’d been starving his entire life. Not for food, though there were definitely times he’d gone without. For something else. He looked at Cas longingly, then sadly. “Cas—”
“So let me get this straight… I’ve danced before and you haven’t, but you’re going to teach me?”
Dean kept riding ahead, unaware. He didn’t make it far before he realized that his angel was gone. He glanced back and saw an abandoned horse munching on some brush, with no rider.
“Then why do you believe yourself that you should feel like shit, and not me and Cas when we say you shouldn’t?”
Castiel stared at him, stone-faced. “
“No, he’s out with Bobby. Do you want to call for him?”
Sam turned around and smiled, looking exactly as Dean remembered him. “Dean.”
The shadow’s tendrils pulled a glowing strand from Castiel’s body. It only took a moment. Before the three could even register that they were moving, the Empty had tossed them back out into the barn. It was night, and it was cold.
“God damn it.”
“Yeah…”
“Yeah, I can think of a few,” Dean said.
“You didn’t know.”
follow up.”
“Since the dawn of—”
“But have you seen it?” Dean prodded.
“What’s going on?” Dean asked.
“Have you visited mom and dad?” Sam asked.
He smirked. “I’ll do you a favor and take the girl part.”
When he was alive, Dean had pictured one particular moment that never came: a family dinner. A celebration of conquering every damn monster that ever came their way. A toast to beating God at his own damn game. Now the moment was his.
Castiel continued speaking through his thoughts. “Maybe I deserve unhappiness for what I did to Heaven. I can’t think of anything you did to deserve eternal sorrow, but…”
Mary’s voice lowered. “John. What did you do to my son?”
“You can’t tune them out?” Dean asked.
Dean offered a dead-eyed stare. “Oh. Okay.”
Dean pointed an accusing finger at him. “Hate crime.”
Dean reassured him. “It’s not that.”
Option One: Listen to his brother and his angel. Accept that John was supposed to go to Hell and that an error had been corrected. He knew it was what he should do, but this option involved not holding onto shame and guilt. It seemed impossible.
“I don’t know. I went to bed and woke up and you were here.”
“You know you don’t have to wear that trench coat
“I, uh…”
“Vamp nest.” Dean couldn’t hide his shame.
Dean thought about it, and it didn’t take him long to decide. It was Christmas.
“Cas!?”
biggest fear?” Dean asked.
“You know you can talk about what’s going through your mind when—”
Dean blinked a few times. “Okay? I’ve been dragging this around for a decade, and the best you’ve got is ‘okay’? I’m not saying you need to throw me a parade, but...”
“If we don’t talk about this, you’re going to do something stupid. Because—”
He lied, of course. His thoughts drifted. The TV in front of him was the one he, Sam, and Cas had used to visit the world of
“Oh, I
“You too.”
. You heard Jack. He brought everyone back. The monsters are gone. We finally get to live real lives. This is huge.”
, you know?”
“You told me what?”
“Right,” Mary said.
Dean steered the Impala onto the shoulder and brought it to an abrupt stop.
“You don’t think you deserve to be saved?” Dean stepped in closer. “I’m here about what you said before this thing took you...”
“Huh?” Dean blinked a few times, refocusing on the road and trying to figure out how far he’d driven. It didn’t work. He had no clue.
Castiel shook his head. “Each bee has a different job. Some of them build combs. Some feed their brood. Some protect the others. Some remove their dead.”
Castiel’s brow furrowed. He continued conversing with Claire, but kept a suspicious eye on Dean as he walked out the front door.
“Cas?” Sam wondered.
“Cas?” Dean leapt from the chair and sprinted over.
Mary leaned in closer to her son. “Dean… You seem off. Is there something you need to talk about?”
Dean was in love. He knew it, and he hated everything about it—especially himself. He didn’t know what else to do but hate it. There were two options again: sit there and suffer, or try talking through it. He took the first option for a long while.
First came a welcoming hug and a brief explanation that they really were in Heaven and that, yes, Dean had checked. Yes, he was sure it wasn’t really Hell. It wasn’t a scheme by Chuck or Lucifer or anyone else. It was what Bobby called “the Heaven they deserved.”
Dean eyed the tree and began carefully placing ornaments, spacing them apart and making sure to put some around the back.
“Dean?” Castiel asked.
From then on, when Dean went to visit Mary, his father was always away. He didn’t know whether it was John’s doing or support from Jack’s angels, but either way it was a relief.
,” John said, hitting a mocking tone.
When Cas was weird, he was really weird. Dean shook his head. “I’m sorry. I don’t get it.”
“Truth,” Dean said.
“It’s beautiful here,” Castiel said.
“...Yeah.” Dean swallowed and took a quick breath. “We met when I was fifteen. Went on a bunch of hunts together. Hell, he was practically part of the family for a while there...”
“What then?” Sam asked.
“No killin, though. It’s as peaceful as you make it.”
“I can make it stop, Castiel,” she said.
“Tell me you didn’t die on a rusty nail,” Dean said.
“You mean he never responds?”
“Let’s try something,” Dean said.
“I’ve seen you in love before,” Sam said. “It’s been forever, but yeah. I didn’t put it together because it’s Cas, but…” His memory recalled a decade’s worth of long glances, strangely close touches. They weren’t just on Castiel’s part. He’d seen Dean staring at that angel like he was a piece of pie. “...You
good to me.”
Dean looked up. “What?”
“Yeah,” Dean said.
“You are worthy of more than I could ever give you.” Castiel stared deeply into his eyes. “You really have no idea how happy I am just to be here with you.”
“Tell you what. You pick the song,” Dean said.
“What he
Castiel was surprised to see him approaching, but smiled. “Dean. I think I won—”
“Dean, you don’t have to make this about mom or anyone else for it to matter. What he did to you is enough.”
A flapping sound and Castiel’s voice interrupted him.
“It’s not that I don’t want to,” Dean said. “It’s that I
“You missed three turns in a row and almost drove us into a truck. Pull over. I’m driving.”
One moment, Dean was on the floor of a barn gasping for breath. The next, he stood outside Harvelle’s Roadhouse. He tapped at his chest, searching for the rebar. Nothing. He was healed.
“Pride is a sin, Dean.”
Dean eyed his bare legs. “Yeah, didn’t help.”
“You sure?”
“So were you ever with another—”
Dean couldn’t hold his tongue. He loudly blurted, “I deserved to be
“Dare,” Dean said softly.
Sam’s face scrunched. “What is it?”
Dean didn’t reply in words, but his eyes answered yes. He needed Cas to understand, but he couldn’t talk about it. He reached for the angel’s hand and pulled it to his forehead, begging him to use angelic cheat mode.
“I did know that. Yes.”
Castiel sat next to him. “Dean, do you want to invent a holiday?”
Castiel, the enormous cosmic wavelength he was, sat starry eyed and smiling as he listened to the man for whom he’d moved Heaven and Earth.
“Cas is my friend. You’re my brother. If you think I’m not going to help you both find happiness, you don’t know me.”
"This is gonna sound weird, but—”
When everyone was done eating, Jack looked at Dean and Cas and blurted a thought out of the blue.
calls—and I start to wonder. This ain’t healthy, sittin’ around boo-hooin’ in paradise. You should be out there enjoyin’ people’s company, findin’ a soulmate, some—”
“What you did eats at you. I want you to forgive yourself for it, and for anything you’ve ever done that makes you feel that same way. Because—whether you want to believe it or not—you always did your best.”
This chapter and the next dive deeper into John Winchester's abuses and the number they've done on Dean (including suicide-adjacent thoughts). I don't think anything is particularly graphic, but I'm desensitized. If reading about these things might trouble you, skip ahead to Chapter 17. Context clues will get you through.
“Yeah, okay.” Dean rolled his eyes.
At first, Dean left hash marks on his bedroom wall. Deep scratches that broke through paint and hit drywall. One scar for each day. But he soon found that what had been a day for him could have been an hour, week, month, year, or decade for someone else. Time in Heaven was that fluid.
Dean pulled him in closer, as if he could do anything to protect one angel from another.
“Dean, the windows are rolled up.”
Dean responded with confidence. “Abso-freakin-lutely.”
Dean ignored him and barreled into the kitchen. He pulled a sixer from the fridge, popped open a bottle, and chugged.
“Oh, you’ll be the first to know,” Bobby said.
While Sam made the call, Castiel instinctively put his hand on Dean’s chest. He was human now, and they both knew it, but he felt he owed Dean an explanation anyway.
“Well, I’ll be damned. You do still exist,” Bobby said. “Rufus and I had a bet goin’.”
“Because that’s what I do. Right.”
“...Yeah.”
“It’s not?” Castiel asked. “How long have you been here?”
“You’re welcome. But you’re not the one who prayed for me.” He turned to Dean. “I put your father in the Empty.”
“Well, let’s hope those hunters Sam and Eileen trained up are good at their jobs, then.”
“Bingo. The souls can interact now. Can even get into fights with one another if they’re so inclined. I’ve seen a few scraps between first, second, and third spouses about who gets what...Turns out liquor works just the same here.”
Dean put a hand on Castiel’s shoulder. “Are you okay? You’re getting a little deep in the bee metaphors. Is this whole thing… not doing it for you?”
“What?”
Bobby looked him in the eyes. “Are you? No one’s seen you around. Maybe Charlie, but she was real tight-lipped about it.”
“There’s not.”
“Me too,” Dean said. He finished the beer.
“I’m serious. You can’t be happy if dad’s here, and you can’t be happy knowing he’s there. It doesn’t matter if he’s in Hell or Heaven’s dungeons or Purgatory or anywhere. It’s not your responsibility, and you have to let it go, or there’s always going to be something stopping you from having what you deserve.”
Dean gave an affirmative shrug and resumed walking.
“That wasn’t a werewolf… It was dad.”
Castiel was nearly in tears himself as he listened to this clumsy, heartfelt confession.
“Yeah.” Dean held Castiel’s hand.
“Yeah.
Castiel looked into his eyes. “Is it me that you want here, or do you just not want to be alone?”
.” Bobby turned back to Dean. “
Then Castiel did what he was best at. He stood there, awkwardly, unsure how to proceed. This was their happy ending, but he wasn’t sure he’d earned it. Part of him expected the curtain to fall back and reveal he was in Hell. Dean took a step toward him, and Castiel took a step back. He stared intently at Dean, looking for some sign that anything was amiss.
“Are you sure?” Dean asked.
Dean nodded.
Some anonymous angel told him where to go. The destination was a bridge that looked familiar, but Dean couldn’t place it. Until he saw Sam standing there, a shadowy, freakishly tall figure in the middle of the bridge, staring down off the edge. It was from a case. The first case that took Sam away from Stanford and led him on a fifteen year journey with his brother.
Sam’s face scrunched. “Dude. I’m eating.”
“Look at them.” Castiel gestured to the thousands of bees crawling across the frame. “They each understand their purpose. With an almost inconsequential lifespan, they divide their labor to create a deeply complex society.”
“This looks great,” Mary said.
Dean signed “not good,” then spoke. “I’ve got all the time in the world. It’d be rude not to.”
?” Sam smiled on the other end of the line, as if his brother could see him.
“Yeah, well. Screw those dicks,” Dean said. “You’ll be alright.”
“—I don’t want to talk about it.”
Castiel responded teasingly. “I was never a human child, so no.”
“I’m not sure that’s a real word.”
“Thank you, Doctor Phil.”
Dean, still buzzing from his close encounter of the celestial kind, took a deep breath.
“Not at all, Dean. I love you too.”
. You’re still dead. The marshal hasn’t called it yet.” She reached for his ankle. “Hey!”
“Please don’t leave…”
“Watch your step, Sam. It’s one OSHA violation after another in here.”
This wasn’t the angel Mary knew. She rushed toward them, trying to get him to stop. “Castiel!”
“When I lived as Emmanuel, I danced at my wedding.” He paused, then made a coy correction. “I don’t suppose that counts.”
“Right…” Dean trailed off.
“This’ll do.” Dean grabbed a record, stood, and took it to the record player. As he adjusted the needle to where he wanted it, he looked back over his shoulder at Cas. “Lose the trenchcoat.”
Loud cursing came from the corner where Bobby and Rufus stood playing pool. Ash provided color commentary as Jody and Donna looked on, eating cake.
Sam noticed, and he shouted from across the barn. “Dean!?”
“Not anymore. That Cas-looking fella fixed it up.”
The angel could have easily escaped. Instead, he put up just enough resistance to let Dean know he strongly disliked the idea.
“Merry Deanmas,” Dean said.
Contrary to popular belief, Dean loved reading. He just never had time for reading much of anything but lore until now. He and Castiel had started a book club of sorts, but even if Metatron hadn’t bestowed knowledge of a book to Castiel, it took the angel almost no time to read one in its entirety. So he had a habit of interrupting Dean when it was “taking forever” for him to finish something. He strode into the bunker’s library with purpose.
“Don’t move,” Dean said. He’d re-formed a disc and set it in front of Cas.
“You too. C’mon.” Bobby pulled an awkward, stiff Castiel into a hug.
“I’ll wait here,” Castiel said.
“Castiel?” she asked.
“Is it frustrating for you?” Dean asked, avoiding eye contact.
Castiel squinted. “Who taught
Dean’s reply was as unenthused as a reply could be. “I know. Go us.”
“Yeah? How?”
Castiel tilted his head. “They’re bees, Dean. Bees can’t feel happiness.”
“Movie’s starting,” Dean said, bailing out of the moment.
Dean crossed his arms. “What do you want?”
Sam and Cas were mid-conversation when Dean stumbled toward them.
“Why would I do that?”
“There’s more important things than being
“Because sometimes it takes a while to hit. Because grief isn’t something that just happens and you get over. It comes and goes. Sometimes you’ll be fine for years until one day you can’t even get out of bed because it’s so overwhelming.” At that point, Sam was talking about himself. “All you can do is carry on.”
“Better than you’d think,” Dean said. “I’m, uh… figuring some things out, Sam.”
Castiel couldn’t understand why Dean thought he would.
“Just because?” Sam rolled his eyes.
Dean’s face hardened. “Drop it.”
. He can handle a little rejection,” Sam said. “Or—”
Castiel zapped the pastry residue from his hands, and Dean gestured at him. “Come on. You gotta wash your hands. Authenticity.”
.” With what little ability he had to focus, Castiel defended Jack.
, right?”
“I am,” Castiel said. “Happiness is separate from wanting. What I want...what I really want... is for you to be happy.”
“I don’t know if you’re listening, Jack… But I need help, and you sort of… know everything. I know it’s not fair to put this on you. It wasn’t fair to put being God on you in the first place. But if you’re listening, and you can get here…”
“You have to do it, right? Those are the rules?”
“You’re kidding me,” Castiel said, out of patience.
Dean brushed him off. “I can’t.” That wasn’t a lie. His throat tightened just at the thought.
“Like my
Naomi sighed. “Do you know how many times you’ve ‘fallen in love’ with one of them? You don’t, because every single time we were able to end it.
“So was you trying to work through your feelings.”
Dean didn’t mean to let those words out, but they came anyway.
Castiel avoided looking directly at Dean as he replied. “Anything is a meal if you’re hungry enough.”
Castiel needed to hear that, and it helped him. He also needed an answer to one question.
“Dean—” Cas tried to rope him back into it.
“What?”
Nothing but silence.
In the time it took Dean to blink, Castiel was in his Moondoorian plate armor.
There was a flapping sound, and Ellen looked past Dean. “The angels, genius. You think you’re the only one being tailed by feathers?”
,” Dean warned.
Castiel stared at his blood-soaked hand. “Nothing. There’s nothing to do.”
He prayed to Jack, a number of times. Just to see how he was doing. Just to have some company. Jack was someone he could count on to take anything he said at face value. But there was never a visit, never even a response. Dean worried about that. He worried they’d given Jack too much power and too much responsibility. He worried that his son was in trouble. He worried that the new God was dead. He piled all of that onto his ever-growing pile of fears and resentments. Eventually, he gave up praying.
“What did you do?” Mary asked John again.
“Dean, not everything is your—”
“Truth or Dare, Dean.”
Castiel, of course, couldn’t sleep. When he was human, he never developed a taste for it. Now, he pined for the ability as he lay next to Dean, watching the sleeping hunter’s shallow breaths.
“Then what’s wrong with you?” Sam asked. “When we were alive, you wanted to see mom and dad forever—”
“I don’t like that I’ve said things to you… I’ve said things to
Mary stood with an angel blade, and threatened him. “Stop it. Or else.”
“You’re not dying, Cas. You’re grieving.”
With the room otherwise empty, Mary went to Dean and wrapped her arms around him. Dean accepted her hug, but put no effort into returning it.
“Let’s hit the lore then.”
John glowered at the pair. “Oh. I get it.”
“Nothing against any of you, but this place isn’t paradise for me yet.” He pulled his keys from his pocket and walked out the door. On the way, he turned to Bobby. “I’m gonna go home and rest. Let me know when Cas or Sam gets here.”
“Chuck said I’m the only Castiel who rebelled. I somehow doubt the others are reacting well to a nephilim seizing Heaven.”
“Don’t be.”
Dean moved in front of Cas and placed a hand on each of his shoulders.
“Dean—”
The angel scoffed. “I think it’s more likely that neither bees nor angels can properly feel anything. They may be better off with a set purpose.”
“You got me.” Dean shook his head briefly, then put on a smirk. “But just so you know, I’m gonna rock your world some day.”
“Okay. But after that, I’m calling Charlie and Kevin and we’re doing
Castiel rolled his eyes, and got back to the only thing he figured he was good for: helping the Winchesters. “What’s wrong with Sam?”
Dean pretended not to understand. “What do you mean?”
Dean didn’t see that. He was too absorbed in Cas’s lips, using his own to say three words before he could verbalize them. Dean let go of Castiel’s face, and dropped back slightly into the angel’s arms. He watched Cas’s eyes return to blue, in awe.
Sam snickered. “You
“No I can’t.” Dean reined in the game. “Truth or Dare?”
Castiel landed in the middle of the room, face down, partially embedded in the flooring. He pulled himself out, rolled onto his side, and pressed at his temples with both hands.
“Pick one.”
“I did handle it.”
to come back.”
Those were the words Castiel needed to hear. “Of course.”
“I have no age, but for your perspective, somewhere in the millions of Earth years…”
“Like what? Being strong? Getting revenge? That’s your bullshit,” Dean said. “Not mine. That’s not who I am. That’s never been who I am.”
Castiel sat in the corner of the room on the floor, his head buried in his hands.
. I want to know how long you and I have been living here in Bryan Adams’ playground.” He thought a little too hard to make that reference, and the opening piano to Bryan Adams’ “Heaven” began to play. “Ugh.
Baby roared as they bounded down the highway, and Dean was happy to hear her again. This time, she wouldn’t end up parked outside his parents’ house with a shaking, sobbing driver. No, this was what she deserved.
“Right.”
“Yeah. Sorry about that.” Dean shifted, desperately wanting but unable to say something else.
Dean knew people who deserved Hell, and he spoke with confidence. “You wouldn’t have.”
The figure was unmistakable, but it didn’t reply. Castiel sat, watching silent waves in a silent lake.
Dean felt like he owed an explanation. “I’m not avoiding you, Sam.”
“It’s okay.” Dean squeezed him tight, feeling his warmth. “You’ve got me now. You’ve got me forever.”
No part of Dean wanted to sit outside watching bees, but every part of him wanted to make Cas happy. And, frankly, the angel had put up with enough of his bullshit that he could tolerate the bee thing. So they left the bunker and went outside, where Castiel had created his own apiary.
That night, he did something he hadn’t in what felt like an eternity. He knelt beside his bed, clasped his hands, and closed his eyes. “Dean. I know you’re not an angel or God and that you most likely can’t hear me. But if by some chance you can, I want you to know that I’m trying. I’m trying to live a life you’d be proud of me for. Life... human life... is... not easy. I just wish you were here to help me.”
“You can tell me anything,” Castiel said.
Castiel reached out, grabbed Dean’s beer-holding arm, and pressed it to the counter. His eyes flashed white. “Stop.”
Sam stared wistfully at Ellen, and Dean waved a hand in front of his face. “You okay?”
“Fine.” Dean rolled his eyes. “One
Castiel had possibly the strangest bedside manner of any registered nurse, but there was something hospice patients found reassuring about him. For those who were religious, he shared stories of his faith (modified, of course). For those who weren’t, he provided simple comfort.
Castiel set the chicken eggs and butter next to the dry goods.
Dean mimicked him. “
What Dean wanted—what he really wanted—was his angel. Not to take care of because he was some familial obligation, but for himself. To have. To love.
“Then I’d prefer you didn’t.” There was only one Dean Winchester, and another would be a grim reminder of what he’d lost.
“I’ll bet,” John said. “I can’t wait to meet her.”
Sam lagged a few feet behind, calling out just the same.
Dean retrieved the ball. “Think about it. How old am I?”
The angel didn’t budge.
“My dad could do a lot of damage as a demon,” Dean said.
There was no reason they needed to burn the body, but Sam assumed that Dean would want a hunter’s funeral and Castiel was utterly indifferent because it wasn’t Dean anymore.
Dean scoffed in disbelief.
Castiel huffed. “
“No. I’m calling
Sam’s annoyance was audible. “Yes,
Dean burst in through the front door, shouting “Cas!”
Mary tried to cut the tension. “I was just telling Dean about some of the things people do to pass the time here—”
“I don’t like doing it this way,” Naomi said.
Castiel spoke about his greatest flaw like it was an asset. “I mean it. You’ve fallen in love with the most uncontrollable being in the universe, and I will stop anyone who tries to ruin Heaven for you—even if it’s
Sam rubbed at his temples for a moment, in a way that said
“Okay.” Dean pondered for a moment. “Can you even taste pie?”
“It varies. Some say I’m so defective I couldn’t have been created by God. Others plot to kill me. The word ‘abomination’ gets thrown around a lot. Some have taken to changing my name to Casbehem.”
He had to do something.
“I don’t need you to. I mean that.”
Option Two: Have his father removed from Hell and put back in Heaven, ruining his and Mary’s afterlives for all eternity. Not great. Not an option at all, really.
“Wait—” Castiel started.
“What’s going on?” Mary asked.
For a good while, the flutter in Dean’s chest was a welcome one—a lightness of being, a once in a lifetime moment, something cosmically beautiful. It ebbed and flowed with the movement of their lips. Then the flutter became a heavier and heavier weight. it came crashing down, and Dean went from floating on air to feeling like he could sink through the floor. His stomach clenched. His neck stiffened. He pulled away from Cas, panting.
Dean grimaced. “Not hits. Just... us.”
Even if that were true, Dean was very, very good at hurting himself. But it wasn’t. There was someone else capable of wounding him. Dean reached up and removed the angel’s hand from his face.
“No,” Sam admitted. “And it sounds like he went out on his own terms, so…”
Dean thought about Taylor Swift, and jumped right into it.
“If this were about the pie, I could just imagine a pie. No. It’s about the process. We’re making this thing
Over and over in Dean's mind, Castiel told him that he loved him.
“It wouldn’t make it okay,” Sam said.
“Like you did with Taylor Swift?” Sam scoffed. “Sure.”
. A comfort movie and comfort food. He told himself it was everything he needed.
“Uh… Let me preface this by saying Cas and I are sort of…together.”
angry. Not with you, but I am angry,” Castiel said.
“You don’t want him to use his true form,” Dean said. “Trust me.”
Sam eyed the bunker’s many bookshelves. “Are those the same as they were on Earth?”
did you manage to get yourself killed in under a week, but you couldn’t even bother to see me until you needed something.”
“How long?”
They could have simply appeared on any of Heaven’s beaches—or generated one in their backyard for that matter—but that lacked the pizzazz of a true beach vacation. Dean loaded the Impala with an umbrella, beach towels, and a cooler full of road food, and they set off.
“On Earth I could. Not in Heaven.”
it (with Cas’s help, of course).
Castiel begrudgingly removed it, and was left standing in a suit with no tie.
Castiel leaned sharply and suddenly forward. His face scrunched as he tried to tune out the voices in his head. He let out a soft groan.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea,” Mary added.
In every moment since a certain love confession, Dean lived at least partially in a state of panic. That his father wasn’t there lessened it, ever so slightly.
“You know what I meant.”
Dean brushed a tear from his eye and tried to move the game along. “Truth or Dare, Cas.”
Dean agreed with that. “I know.”
Sam snorted a happy little laugh.
“Jack?” Dean wondered.
Dean stared at the bottle. El Sol. It was absolute dogshit. He opened it and chugged.
“I love you. Not because I have to. Not because I owe you. Because you’re you. Because you’re weird and you’re cute and you make the worst jokes I’ve ever heard. Because I love the way your brain works. You make a better person than most people. You’re kind. I mean, you gave me a damn flower. You know how insane that is?” Dean chuckled a bit. “I love you.”
Castiel let out an amused snort. “Well, Dean. I only say things I believe.”
Part of Dean’s mind was screaming at him to answer with affection. The other part—the part that won—panicked and threatened him. He brushed off the question, bolstering his self-loathing in the process.
“I’m sorry for your loss,” she signed.
. I have powers. You don’t.”
?” Dean wondered.
The roaring engine of an Impala sounded, just outside the front door. Not Dean’s Impala. Another copy. Dean’s heart sank and his stomach tightened as he stared at the entryway.
Taking Taylor’s part wasn’t much of a favor. It left Cas with the rap portions of the song, and he stood tense and awkward as he spoke his way through Ed Sheeran. Dean faced him, mouthing along to the words and encouraging him with a smile. Cas couldn’t help but smile back, even as a small part of him wanted to commit a smiting.
“I don’t disagree with him,” Ellen said.
“Yeah. Charlie and I went LARPing,” Dean said.
“Are you sure?” Castiel asked.
Castiel appeared puzzled. “For what?”
“You think he knew what would happen with... us?”
“I’ll see you soon.
“It’s more fun to shout it.” Dean hopped onto the couch next to him. “You should try it.”
There was no practical reason to use phones in Heaven, but many found telepathy awkward and used whatever means with which they were familiar. For Dean, soul-to-soul communication manifested in his cell phone. There were no cell towers, obviously, so they were still communicating telepathically, but this way felt… normal.
Dean took a few steps backward and let himself fall onto the sofa. Cas followed and sat next to him, but not close enough to smother the horrified human.
“I don’t know if I ever will be,” Dean said. He scoffed at himself and lowered his head, thinking about just how pathetic that seemed. “I’m...stuck. I know I should be able to get over it. I’m too old for freaking daddy issues—”
Confusion slides down Charlie’s face as she frowns. “Cas? But what’s he gonna be able to do?”
in that way.” He glowers at Dean, who leans back in his seat with a grin.
Sam's phone lights up as they cross the border from Kansas into Nebraska, an unknown number but a familiar name.
“Here you go!” Dean says, his voice about an octave higher than it should be. He chucks the clothes across the room, a hot flush creeping up his cheeks as he whips himself around so he can’t see Castiel anymore. Fuck, he’s such a fucking asshole, checking out the
“About what,” the man grouses, pulling a blanket tighter around his shoulders.
Cas sighs again. “Well, with my waning magic, maybe I should start going. I can’t keep hoping or expecting magic to fix my apparent health problems.”
Castiel nods. “I would assume so. The old Death once told you he would reap God one day, right? It would be… helpful, I think, to know that Billie isn’t lying to us about killing Chuck.”
He leaves before any of them say anything. Can feel Sam and Eileen’s eyes burning a hole in the back of his neck. Cas hasn’t moved a muscle. Arms still crossed. Still keeping a pillar between himself and Dean.
Dean nods. “Don’t blame you,” he says. “Do you know what he was trying to do?”
Ninety minutes later, Dean blinks and collapses back against the couch, laughing so hard he feels like his lungs are about to explode. “Holy shit, that was… that was incredible. And bad. Incredibly bad. Please tell Isaac to burn that DVD when you give it back to him, because that movie is a crime against humanity.”
Dean feels like he’s just bitten down hard on a lemon. “Aw, come on, that poor werewolf is probably way more traumatized by this whole thing than I am. No, I’m not gonna press any charges. Just slap a band-aid on me and I’m good!” He looks at Cas, pleading. “C’mon, dude, don’t you want to go get coffee?”
Throwing a couple of bills on the table, Dean stands up and shakes his head, gesturing for Cas to stand too. “Dude, it’s no problem. We’ll figure it out, one step at a time, yeah?”
“Do you remember what happened?”
“If she doesn’t yet, she’s getting there. Actually, I think we both are.”
Cas stays there for a moment, until Dean is twisting and begging him to move, trying to push back against him. Only then does Cas shift his hips, driving back into Dean and making them both groan, loud. Dean brings his legs up around Cas’ hips, the only way he can hold on as Cas holds his hands in a bruisingly tight grip. It takes him a minute to work out a rhythm, but when he does, it’s perfect: just on the right side of hard and fast, and Dean knows he’s going to feel it in the morning.
Zachariah growls and then runs back towards the waves, turning into a silver-gray blur as he swims off. Castiel watches him go for a moment, dropping the blade to the ground as he kneels next to the fallen body of Uriel. He bows his head, his shoulders hunching forward as he closes Uriel’s unseeing eyes, murmuring a soft, “I’m sorry, brother.”
“Am I doing something wrong?” Cas asks, confusion seeping through his tone.
“As far as I can tell, Cas is as human as they come,” he explains, shoving his hands in his pockets. “Other than the healing factor, which you know has been historically documented among some witchlines.”
Dean licks his own lips, involuntary, and watches Cas’ eyes focus on the motion; can’t miss the way Cas’ gaze stays there. His mouth feels dry, the air in his lungs thick as he keeps staring at Cas. He waits for Cas to sit back, to move away. Waits for the walls around them to rise once again. Waits for one of them to chuckle defensively and make a dumb joke.
“Without her knowing?”
Instead of eating, Cas pushes scrambled eggs around his plate with his fork, expression rapidly shifting between nausea and excitement. Watching him from the kitchen, Dean sighs and sets down his (first) mug of coffee with a clink against the countertop. “Dude, you’re so nervous, you’re about to make
“You can,” Cas mutters, his other hand on Dean’s hip, thumb rubbing slow circles over the skin. He fucks his fingers deep into Dean, spreading them apart inside of him, and Dean feels his balls tighten, arousal coiling tight at the base of his spine. He grips Cas’ forearm, heat and anticipation electrifying every sensation. Cas tucks a kiss behind his ear, bites softly at the lobe, before pulling back and sitting up. His eyes look otherworldly as silver light bathes the room, and something in Dean’s chest shifts, digging into the space behind his ribs, catching in his throat.
“Hey, if you’re into this kind of stuff, that’s great,” he tries to deflect, keeping his tone light and easy. “But make sure you’re taking care of yourself, you know? You’re a nerd, not a superhuman,” he jokes.
Another two weeks slip by in a haze of work, sleep, and alcohol. Charlie calls him at one point, offering up her services to track down Cas, but Dean declines. Cas made it clear that Dean couldn’t do anything to help with whatever is going on, so what would be the point? He’ll get over it eventually. Hopefully.
“Dean?” Sam asks, voice bleary. “What are you doing up?” He sounds exhausted. He sounds
“Probably not worth it, then,” Cas sighs, slumping back against the car seat. “I guess I just need to get used to it. In a few years, I probably won’t even remember that it’s gone, since I don’t remember what the source is.”
For a moment, Dean stands frozen, unable to react, and then he’s reaching out, pulling Cas into a rough hug against him. Cas gives a startled
hard. Even Sam’s hair looks lank and unwashed, which is completely out of the norm for him.
Before he closes the door to his bedroom, he sees a glimpse of Castiel carefully smoothing the blanket over his legs on the couch before laying down, like it’s new to him. Quietly, something aches in Dean’s heart.
“Is there any pain?” he asks, pressing just above Castiel’s ribs. It’s a rather nasty bruise, and Castiel recoils.
The blonde woman, Rachel, is pulling a long silver blade out of her sleeve, and Dean headbutts her, a sick crunch coming from her nose as she cries out and stumbles back, blood dripping from her nose. Dean’s forehead throbs painfully, but he kicks the knife away, and it skitters across the sand, glinting in the moonlight. Cas is still kneeling on the ground, hands gripping his hair, and Uriel is coming up behind him, another long-bladed silver knife in his hand. “Cas!” Dean shouts again, running and trying to tackle the large selkie to bring him down.
He and Cas had devoured the burgers that Dean grilled, and then Cas had gone back into the lake. He was enamored with swimming, apparently. Seemed to glean hours of amusement from moving himself through the water, swift and accurate like an arrow. Maybe he’d been an avid swimmer before he lost his memory. Dean had spent a while in the lake as well, part of it floating on an inner tube and just relaxing, but Cas hadn’t gotten out when Dean had.
He thinks about Cas’ pink lips wrapped around him, those blue eyes staring up at him with heat and purpose blazing in their depths, and sucks in a breath. “You fight dirty,” he accuses. His jeans feel tight. Goddammit.
Another push. This one rocks him hard; only his unmoving legs stop him from crashing to the ground. There’s a light growing all around them, pushing away the darkness. Dean can hear something in the distance: the faint background hum of electricity, a voice saying his name.
There’s no answer.
“What about my magic?” Cas says into the silence. Everyone looks at him in clear surprise. “Dean said I must have some, when he was helping me. Could that be tracked back to someone who knows me?”
Out the small window he can see blue skies dotted with perfect white fluffy clouds, palm trees swaying in a soft breeze. It’s the middle of September but looks like the perfect height of summer here; it also means the beach will be pretty empty, all the kids back in school. Dean grins, already planning an epic beach cookout for the two of them. A bonfire, hot dogs, lots of beer, some s’mores -- yeah, this’ll be amazing. Maybe even worth the flight.
Dean can feel his heart hammering away in his chest as he comes down, his breathing loud in his own ears. Castiel is slumped over him, warm and heavy and alive, and Dean’s come is sticky and gross between them, Cas’ cock slowly growing soft inside of Dean, and it’s going to be uncomfortable if they don’t move soon, but Dean can’t. Can’t make himself push Cas off, push him away.
?” Dean demands, and gets a baleful glare in response. “I’ll go get the cayenne.”
“Just say it a few more times, maybe I’ll actually believe you,” Dean mutters. He plugs in several of the cables, though none of them go with the unknown purple port. “Okay, so here’s a basic rundown of what these lines mean, you listening?”
Cas can tell her himself.
There’s a warm, fuzzy, aching feeling somewhere deep in Dean’s chest as he lays down. “Yeah, you too.”
There’s a pillar between them as Sam explains that he’s the Harry to Chuck’s Voldemort, somehow, that
Cas shakes his head. “No, I was just standing behind the counter reading a magazine and watching the news, like I usually do. There was some news report about a lake in Nebraska being completely sucked up by a waterspout, and then my head felt like it was splitting open.” He pinches the bridge of his nose, letting out a soft exhalation. “It’s been so long since my last headache, I’d hoped that they were done.”
“It’s not important,” he says, ignoring the way Dean’s gaze hardens. “What’s important is that you know about the key to Death’s library.”
Dean hums, biting his lip in concentration. Nothing feels broken beneath his touch, which is odd, because Castiel has definitely sustained some sort of abdominal injury -- he’d been clutching his sides when Dean had found him, like he had a fractured rib. “It’s possible you bruised your ribs, on the bone itself,” he muses out loud, “but I can’t confirm that without --”
She juggles everything unsteadily for a moment, then rights it all as they walk back to Cas, who is scrolling through the movie suggestions with a look of intense concentration on his face.
“That’s why she’s the best at what she does.” Dean hands him the envelope. “Okay, you do the honors.”
By some miracle they don’t trip over any furniture, and then there’s a door at his back that it feels like Cas is trying to kiss him
There’s a space between them that Dean put there, he knows. Or, he didn’t do it exactly--Cas did it, by leaving, by letting the bunker door slam shut behind him--but it’s a space that Dean forced into existence, that he shoved between them because it was easier than acknowledging what was already there.
“Hm. Yeah, maybe.” Dean sighs and rubs a hand over his face. “Alright, let’s get out of here. Do something actually fun with our day off.” He’ll text Sam later. Maybe tomorrow. Give them both some time to cool off. He tries to tamp down on the sour feeling of worry spreading across the pit of his stomach, with mixed success.
When he comes back out, Dean has about thirty seconds of functionality to consider the fact that he has royally fucked up, and then his brain just completely shuts down, because Cas is shirtless and in swim trunks, and holy shit did Dean miscalculate. Cas’ legs are muscular and long, and somehow he already seems tan, even though Dean
, the wood scraping roughly against his shirt. Dean fumbles for the knob, nearly falls on his ass when it suddenly turns and opens and Cas pushes them inside. He vaguely notices they’re in his own room, bed neatly made, basket of clean laundry that needs to be put away sitting in the open closet.
“Dean --”
“What did you have in mind?” Cas asks, cocking his head to one side, curious. Dean gives him a real, if still slightly strained, smile this time.
Without a word, Dean offers his hand in the space between them. Cas takes it automatically, the skin-warmed metal of the silver band around his finger catching against Dean’s palm. In the backseat, Jack watches them, his own hand clenched around his patchwork elephant.
Except Dean. He always stayed.
The ringing cuts out, replaced by Sam’s cheerful voice. “Sorry, but I can’t come to the phone right now! Please --”
Dean tries again, “Sam, seriously --”
“To get Cas into the system somehow. Get him an ID and whatever else he needs so that he doesn’t have to spend the rest of his life holed up with me if he doesn’t want to do that.” He very carefully ignores the way his heart stutters at that thought. “Doesn’t have to be anything elaborate, and I’m not talking pulling off a major heist to fill Cas’ bank account or whatever. Just… enough to let him live, you know?”
“Okay, we’re looking for 186 Davis Drive. Make a left at this light up ahead, and then the next right.”
, and Dean’s head hurts, the grief he’s been ignoring for the past several hours since he heard Cas’ voicemail beating against the base of his skull.
Three hours later, they land in San Diego, and Dean nearly starts weeping with joy. He pretends he doesn’t see the way Cas winces and stretches out his hand once Dean lets go of it.
Cas makes a humming noise next to him, and then his large, warm hand is back, spanning across the back of Dean’s neck and massaging lightly. “He’s your brother and you know him best, but maybe you should listen to him. He’s a smart young man, and he knows he can go to you for help when he needs it,” he says.
“Who said that’s a prerequisite?”
Castiel believes him. There’s that trust again.
“I’m sure he didn’t say it like that,” Cas offers, his mouth a small moue of sympathy. “I’ve texted him once or twice as well, though he’s slow to answer me sometimes.”
“Okay,” Cas says, easy, steps back into Dean’s space and touches his face with his big hands, cradling it, making Dean stand back up, like this is the next obvious logical step, like he isn’t turning Dean’s world completely upside-down with one word. Like this is something he wants to do, giving
, he just isn’t sure how. And then it clicks: he ran into this guy outside of Rowena’s office months ago, right after he’d set up the monitor for Sam. The one who had asked Dean about getting an appointment for some bullshit. Was
There’s silence on the other end of the line. Charlie says, “Okay, Dean. I’ll talk to you later,” and her voice is soft and tired, and Dean closes his eyes, but takes the out, because he’s weak and awful like that.
“Jack told me about Billie’s plan,” he explains, watching as Dean’s eyebrows fly to the top of his forehead in surprise. Nausea roils in the pit of his stomach as he spills Jack’s confession, but he forces it down. “She’s weaving a spell to… to essentially turn Jack into a bomb, one which will take out Chuck and Amara at the same time.”
With a smile, Dean says, “I love you, Cas,” and the truth of it feels like coming home. Screwing up his courage, he steps forward and kisses him, hands coming up to cradle Cas’ face, memorizing the feel of soft, slightly chapped lips against his own, the way Cas’ stubble scratches against his cheek. A large hand tangles in his hair, another hand landing on his hip, holding him with a reverence he’s never felt before this moment.
Dean groans and rubs the heels of his hands into his eyes, pushing hard enough that multicolored lights burst behind his eyelids. “Alright,” he says. “I need a break. Anything but this right now.” He stands up and stretches, listening to the pops in his back. “Want a beer?”
Sam sighs, “I’ll show you,” and heads back towards the workshop, limping faintly. Dean follows him automatically, glancing at the firmly closed door to Rowena’s private office for a moment. There’s a faint purple light emanating from underneath the door frame, but Sam pays no heed to it, so Dean ignores it as well.
Dean jumps forward, brandishing his fist of keys, but the “Nice try, motherfucker!” he was about to shout dies in his throat. Because there’s no feral child, no crafty mugger lying in wait on the other side of the dumpster to accost him.
“I --” Cas pauses, frowns. “I’m experiencing a rather pronounced sense of déjà vu at the moment.” He looks around the street like he expects it to become immediately familiar to him. “Maybe I’ve been here before?”
“Alright, spit it out,” he says, rubbing a hand over his face. “What’s this about?”
Desperate, he takes out his phone and calls Sam again, listening closely for Sam’s ringtone. If he still has his phone, then there’s still a chance…
As Dean heads into the kitchen to grab some beers, he hears Cas ask, “Oh, are you magical as well? Or nonhuman?”
“A soul?” Dean blinks, confused. So Cas… wasn’t in the Empty? He’d gotten out?
“Who said I don’t want to?” Dean mutters, grabbing another bowl and dumping some packaged cookies into it. Gotta have salty and sweet for movie night. He can practically hear Charlie’s expression as it crosses her face.
“Dean,” Cas rumbles, and fuck, Dean can feel it in his
“Well, I guess as long as I don’t mention anything specific to the actual project itself…” he muses. “It’s more the application of the research that’s under an NDA at the moment, not the research itself.”
A faint blush colors Cas’ cheeks, but he continues to eat like there’s no tomorrow. “This is very good,” he praises after finally swallowing down the last bite.
“You just want any chance you can get to flirt with Rowena.”
The tip of a silver blade pierces through Uriel’s throat, his eyes going wide and mouth dropping open in surprise. He lets go of Dean, who falls to the sand, ankle rolling with an unpleasant snap underneath him. Dean yells but looks up, vision clearing enough to see Cas pull the blade from Uriel’s throat with a sickening sound, eyes alight with a righteous fury that makes them burn from within.
But Sam turns to him, and Dean relaxes a bit, because he knows his brother can sometimes rein Rowena in when it comes to her more daring and, uh, dangerous ideas. Except Sam opens his big mouth and asks, “How did you figure out Castiel has magic? You don’t have any witch-sight at all.”
Dean gnaws on his lower lip, guilt pooling in his stomach. He knows the exact look of disappointment and worry that’s probably clouding Charlie’s face right now, and he hates that he’s the cause of it. “We’ll hang out soon, I swear,” he says, trying to assuage both of them. “When I’m not as busy.”
A small, whimpering cry rises up into the dawn light from the altar, and Nick shushes it, holding a finger to his lips. The cry quiets immediately. “Don’t wake the baby,” he mocks, shaking Dean like a ragdoll in the air.
Castiel nods, so Dean slips into his darkened bedroom, rummaging through his drawers for an old pair of sweatpants and a shirt. He pulls out a stretched-out gray AC/DC shirt and folds it over his arm. He hesitates for a moment, hovering over his underwear drawer, before he decides he’s not willing to let a stranger wear his boxers. Just a little too weird for now.
The paperwork is quick.
He drops her off at a local bed and breakfast before driving off, merging onto 70 and pushing the Impala as fast as she’ll reasonably go. He turns north at Green River and skirts past Salt Lake City and Ogden several hours before sunset. Stopping at a gas station in the middle of nowhere on the border of Utah and Idaho, he grabs a couple of energy drinks, popping the tab on one and grimacing at the sugary acidic taste of it as soon as he gets back in the car.
“Yeah, they’re tricky like that.”
“He’s fine.”
The man blinks, eyes struggling to focus. “I --” he says, then pauses, frowns. He’s quiet for a few moments, mouth struggling to shape an answer. “Castiel,” he says finally.
Things are quiet in the bunker that night, just the low constant hum of the bunker’s systems running in the background. Dean hasn’t tried looking through the multidimensional telescope or whatever Mrs. Butters called it; part of him is a little afraid to. Jack brought everyone on
Dean’s heart flips over in his chest. He winks at Cas. “You’re not so bad yourself,” he says, trying to mask his flush.
Something starts hissing in the background on Sam’s end, but it quickly stops. “The state has us looking into it on the side. Nothing too strenuous or time-consuming. And actually, it’s been really helpful with my own stuff, it’s given me some interesting insight into shifting physiology and cryptozoological phenomena.” Excitement strengthens his voice. “So get this: there’s an incredible amount of energy that goes into these form transformations, which is obvious since fully-shifted werewolves experience intense hunger in both their wolf and human forms immediately after the shift. But it’s been really hard -- next to impossible, really -- to observe that energy transfer and expenditure while it’s in progress. But for the first time, a couple of hospitals and other places were able to get
“Something we wouldn’t have to worry about if we just flew to Kansas,” Cas says, but the smirk on his face lets Dean know he’s joking.
Cas frowns. “No, I guess not. But how would I know what being a serial killer feels like?”
him so thoroughly that the very atoms of the universe forgot his name. No. This is just the face you were hoping to see, isn’t it? When you slipped across that dream-line and into my space. Breathing so fucking loudly.” Those familiar blue eyes narrow in an inhuman rage that makes Dean take another step back.
“No movement. Looks like he’s in a more industrial area.”
Sam makes a quiet noise and shifts next to him, and Dean knows his brother’s eyes are probably huge and sad right now. “He… managed to be happy? While Billie was chasing you guys? How?”
“If I tell you, it’ll only put more of a target on your head.” He pauses, eyes trained on a point past Dean’s head. “Remember when you told me about all those people who showed up at the hospital, struck blind at the same time? Or when that half-shifted werewolf attacked you/”
Dean takes a step back, startled. “You’re not Cas,” he says, stupid, because of course this isn’t Cas, Cas is dead -- this is just something wearing his face. “Are you possessing him?”
“Always, Dean.”
It feels like some sort of epiphany.
Four hours later, he watches with a smile as Sam gathers Eileen up in a fierce hug, his gargantuan frame engulfing her, relief running through every line and muscle of his body. Eileen accepts the embrace with grace and no small amount of puzzlement, gentling Sam’s frantic kiss with a soft hand against his jaw.
! He probably did this, too, ‘cause he hates me!” Dean splutters. His ears feel bright red.
“It’s not that hard, I can show you how to make this if you want,” Dean offers. “I just add a couple extra ingredients to some basic pancake mix.”
God, that makes Dean wince, because Cas has been cooped up for weeks on end while Dean has gone to work. Sure, they’d gone through nearly every season of Dr. Sexy that Dean owns on DVD, and had plenty of hangouts with Sam, and sometimes Cas even let Dean take him back to Benny’s diner, where the two would make thinly-veiled threats towards one another while Dean wolfed down hashbrowns and pie. Hell, Dean had even signed up for a library card and then given it to Cas, who had taken to spending hours on end browsing books and reading them at a pace that made Dean dizzy, but it was clear he was getting restless for more. Dean can’t blame him, either, especially as they’ve moved into the summer months and the weather is getting nicer and nicer outside. Cas is a fiercely independent person, and it must really sting to have to rely on Dean for so much.
“Hello?” he calls down the alley, and he’s half-convinced that he’s about to take a rabid raccoon straight to the face. “Is everything okay?” He moves slowly into the shadowed, narrow alley, listening for any more noises.
“I can’t believe this,” Dean mutters, but he can’t help the pleased smile that tucks itself into the corners of his mouth.
The man looks up at him, blue eyes going more and more unfocused. “I won’t harm you,” he says, the words rasping out of his throat like they’re being dragged over a cheese grater. “Just… please.”
“Dude, save that for gas, you’re gonna need it.” She hugs him tight, tucking her face against his chest. “Be safe, okay? Get everyone back home.”
“Kind of hard not to when you toss and turn all night.” Cas’ tone is light, but it makes Dean’s heart drop a bit. Cas is a light sleeper, and he and mornings do
It seems incongruous with their current situation, but for the first time in a long time, Dean feels
Sam steps back to let Dean in, his answering grin tired and weak. “Thanks for coming, man. How’ve you been?”
Now, with Cas sucking an aching bruise to the hollow just below his collarbone, arms wrapped around Dean like he’s afraid to let go, Dean can’t believe he ever thought pushing Cas away was a good idea.
“Dean…”
The muffled sound of spray hitting tile is all Dean can hear for a moment, and then a deep, low singing joins it. It’s hard to make out over the hissing of the pipes and through the wall, but Dean swears Cas is singing Led Zeppelin. Maybe “Stairway to Heaven,” though he’s not sure. Cas’ soft baritone weaves in and out with the water, a kind of soothing white noise that makes Dean’s eyes feel heavy and sends his mind drifting back towards sleep.
Dean frowns down at the popcorn bowl, unease making a space for itself in the pit of his stomach. “Sounds like some intense stuff, Sammy.”
“Castiel?” Dean raises an eyebrow. “Is that an old family name or something? I don’t think I’ve ever met a Castiel before. You got a last name?”
“With me,” Castiel growls, and Dean’s eyes snap to his, mouth dropping open on a whine as Cas’ hips slow down, still spearing hard and deep into Dean. “I want you
“I don’t --” Castiel lets out an explosive sigh. “I can’t remember. I have no idea.”
“I can see how that would work,” Sam says, slow, like he’s working out the logical leaps in a puzzle. “But in order to run the tracking spell, we’d need a physical manifestation of the magic, wouldn’t we? How would we get that?”
“You can try,” he says, trying for a confident smirk in return. He’s always been a master at fake it ‘til you make it.
“What does it feel like to have magic?” Cas asks, and Dean startles and flips a pancake too quickly, smushing it into a weird shape in the pan. He curses, trying to poke it back into something that is more pancake-shaped than an amorphous blob.
Castiel looks like he’s about to nod off again as Dean walks back into the living room. He’s made himself at home on Dean’s plaid couch that has definitely seen better days, leaned back against it like he’s taken many a nap on it before, the blanket falling down around his shoulders.
“Okay, so part of what I’ve been researching lately has been older mythologies, folk tales, and cultural legends from around the world. Things like rapid healing outside of witchlines, and certain types of curses, and selkies and other mythological creatures. It’s been really interesting to dig into these older ideas and concepts and look at how they’re, you know, culturally and spiritually important to the people and places they developed from, and also how they may not be as mythological as we think they are,” he says, gathering steam. “There’s some fascinating work that’s been done on selkie lore versus mermaid culture and sightings from similar time periods among primarily Celtic communities. And after hearing firsthand from you guys about Cas’ rapid healing, Rowena and I are going through all of this stuff with a really fine-toothed comb.”
“Yes, and I like it.”
It was Castiel’s turn again. He reached a hand toward Dean and turned the human’s blushing face back toward him. “Truth or Dare?”
Dean pulled at Castiel’s hands, bringing him closer.
He wondered at what point it would be awkward that he’d waited so long, and if he’d already passed that point. Eventually, he took his thoughts to their logical conclusion: Fuck it. Time was fluid. He could pretend he’d only been there a few minutes and he hadn’t been dodging the best friend he’d ever had. Or
Dean reflected on Sam living life to its fullest, while he’d done nothing, and decided—once again—that John had been right. He really was a disappointment, and he wouldn’t be able to hide it. The question that would prove it was coming, any minute—
and rose from his chair. He walked over to Cas and waved a hand in front of the angel’s face.
Castiel spoke directly and softly to her. “You should return to bed.”
“It sounds bad when you put it that way…”
“Dean.” Castiel put a hand on his shoulder. “It’s not.”
Charlie looked to where Castiel was the last man standing in a field of fallen LARPers. Dean’s gaze followed hers, but lingered on Cas long after Charlie had turned back to him. He was lost in thought. If she was right, and this could all end any moment, he wouldn’t want to spend his time hemming and hawing and wallowing in self-hatred. He might not have been able to do anything about that last one, but the first two?
“I’ve heard the stories. You’re friends with vampires. With demons.
Dean went into crisis mode, began rambling, and revealed more about himself than he intended. “You’re right. It’s not different, and I’m not trying to be controlling. I just, uh… I like spending time with you and I’m not trying to rush through it.”
“Hang on. Just hang on.” Sam had begun crying. He’d seen his brother die before—hundreds of times, actually—so he knew what was happening. It couldn’t happen again. He couldn’t let someone who had sacrificed everything for him time and time again die. Not now. Not when they had finally gotten real freedom. He grabbed Dean’s free hand with both of his own.
Dean was absolutely infuriated.
Once he was in it, Dean never left the angel’s personal space, not that Castiel had ever really understood personal space as a concept. With Dean so close, Cas could feel a difference in his breathing. It was quicker, sharper. And Dean’s face had flushed. Castiel wasn’t an idiot; he knew what these things normally meant. But Dean Winchester was anything but normal.
Sam dropped to the ground next to his brother and put a hand on his shoulder. “An ambulance is on its way. You’re gonna make it.”
“No. Wait.” Mary turned to John. “What did you do?”
The pantry was fully stocked and nothing would ever expire. Dean started rifling through it for flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, ginger—
Castiel looked down at Dean. “So am I.”
“Jack’s power is everywhere, right? In everything?” Sam asked.
Dean’s stomach dropped. “Yeah… This is suddenly not fun at all.”
“You seem awfully sad for someone who just got to paradise.”
“I wanna get drunk,” Jack said.
The fury left Dean’s eyes, replaced by dread. “I don’t give orders…”
“No.”
with some friends.”
“Then what are we gonna do? Resurrection spell?”
The shadow that controlled the Empty did not like commotion. Nearby, the blackness began swirling upward into a vortex, until it took the shape of a towering, faceless human.
“Your time isn’t limited anymore. It doesn’t matter.”
“I thought you were gone. You can’t do that to me. You can’t—” Dean stopped himself, unable to believe and unwilling to show how worried he really was.
Those damn voices—well, one voice repeating itself—got to him. Again. He withdrew and backed himself over to the driver’s side, his mind shaming him both for trying to blow Cas in the first place, and for not finishing the job.
“Wait here,” Dean said.
“I’ve never been in a wedding,” Jack said.
Dean’s tone softened. “Cas?”
“This is hard.” Jack frowned. “I hope the dungeon gives them time to think. I don’t want to leave them there forever. I want them to be happy.”
“I know I haven’t been here, and Cas is in the Empty, but you still should have been able to find something to live for. It’s the after
Dean kicked the nearest chair, the start to an explosion of self-directed rage.
Castiel confronted his tormentor. “I only want to be left alone. I have no intention of raising armies or interfering in any way.”
Castiel thought for a moment. “I did before I actually met God… Chuck. Now I like to believe there’s more. We know there are alternate universes, after all. And I...”
“I’ll be right back,” he said.
“Yeah, well.” Dean also took a seat. He glanced around the room at empty beer bottles, strewn about. It reminded him of himself, and he grimaced. “Are you… Is everything going okay here?”
“You’re not my family,” Dean said. Even though he meant it, he couldn’t watch.
“Would I what?”
“I love you.” Castiel said the words and meant them, but his face didn’t match them. It scrunched in pain.
Charlie ignored his attempt to interrupt. “What if they throw him in the dungeon,
Dean took a sip of coffee. “Not exactly. I have some idea… I just don’t know if...”
He knew they would be, but Dean still didn’t like that answer. Everyone else, it seemed, was casual about what he’d done. He wished he could be. He wished he didn’t give a shit what happened to John Winchester. But John had raised him in a way that made that impossible.
Castiel chuckled. “I know what you meant.”
“Of course I care,” Castiel said.
“Hello, Dean.” A deep voice came from the driver’s side of the Impala.
Dean jumped out of bed and transformed his pajamas into jeans and flannel. “Who else can get into the bunker?”
“Sam’s out back,” she said.
“You said you did your research.”
Dean rolled his watery eyes. “Yeah, other than in Hell. The summoning spell's supposed to work better if it's a place significant to him. I'm just hoping this is one."
Sam clarified. “My son, Dean.”
“You’re not… Okay, so your last visit didn’t go well. I get it. But dad loves you. He’s just… dad.”
The brothers posted up and spent the next hour getting things just right. Circle of archaic symbols scratched into the dirt? Check. Vial of Jack’s blood ready to be smashed in the center of it? Check. Castiel’s old trenchcoat to tune the spell to him? Check. Ominously large leather-bound book containing the spell? Check. A spare vial of blood and some handwritten notes in their pockets for the return trip? Check.
Bobby overheard that. He stepped toward Dean and didn’t mince words.
Castiel was himself once again, and he didn’t hesitate. “Truth or Dare, Dean.”
Dean wanted to object, but he couldn’t come up with anything compelling. Cas was right.
Castiel looked at his own box with hesitation. “How do you know where to put them?”
Dean saw the caller ID and answered with sarcasm. “Who’s this?”
Castiel stepped in close to Dean and looked into his eyes. “For millennia, I was a tool of God. I got to choose
“How about an angel?” Dean thought up a hokey, fancy robe-wearing, angel-shaped topper and presented it to Cas, seeking his approval.
“Yeah, I wish you wouldn’t. I wish you’d just be angry.”
...you love. I just want you happy. Enjoy your eldritch horror. Hell, better that than spendin’ a year with a one night stand ‘cuz you’ve got mommy issues.”
Dean shrank a little in embarrassment. “Sorry.”
“I don’t want to,” Castiel said.
“Likely,” Castiel said. “I don’t know the answer. I just like to come here to think. About bees.”
A box appeared in his lap. He acknowledged it with a slight glance.
“I’ve been here the whole time you were asleep.”
“You met me when I was literally
“What is it?” Sam asked.
“You’re trying to drive me away,” Castiel said simply. He released Dean’s arm and stepped around to his side of the counter. “Because it’s easier for you to wallow in self-hatred than it is to admit there are things beyond your control. You did this with your memories of Purgatory. And with everything we went through with Michael and Chuck…Self-determination means more to you than ever.”
“I don’t understand,” Castiel said.
Dean shook his head. “I don’t know. I just want to celebrate
Dean raised his voice. “Don’t apologize to me.”
Castiel spoke matter-of-factly. “In Hell.”
The shadow moved within inches of his face. “Go to sleep.”
Bobby stood and walked down the stairs toward Dean.
Mary squinted. “You know?”
Their eyes were closed, mostly, but they met briefly and Dean saw that Cas’s were glowing white. He gasped a little, in awe.
. Sam and I are in the Empty. We’re here to get
, okay?”
“Okay...You’ve seen him then?” Sam asked.
Dean caught himself noticing how perfectly the plates fell on the angel’s shoulders, and dodged eye contact. “Yeah. Yeah.
He eyed the angel’s glowing wound, then Mary, reaching down to retrieve the angel blade.
“That’s not my decision.”
“Yeah,” Dean said.
“Your folks are around. They don’t live too far from here. I don’t know they’ll be thrilled seeing you get here so soon, but they’ll surely wanna see you.”
“Then…” Castiel trailed off, at a loss.
“I don’t need a guide.”
Hearing that Jack was as kind as ever softened Dean’s demeanor. He stepped toward him. “You know you’re welcome here any time, right? You don’t have to wait for one of us to pray.”
Halfway through the terrible movie he’d seen dozens of times, Dean fell asleep leaning on Cas’s shoulder. The angel grabbed a throw pillow, set it on his lap, and moved his shoulder to let Dean fall onto the pillow. Dean let out one sleepy groan, then went quiet and still.
Castiel corrected him. “Because
. Look around you.”
With three words repeating over and over in his mind, tears fell from Dean’s eyes. “I can’t do it. I'm barely keeping it together right now… Just… Stay here. Please. I’m about to lose it counting the damn walls in this place. Can you just… stay?”
Finally, they arrived at their destination.
Dean left and didn’t return. He didn’t go anywhere at all. He retreated to the bunker, surrounded himself with alcohol and pie, and wasted time—however many bottles worth.
.” Deflecting, Dean swung the driver’s side door open and hopped out. “I gotta whiz.” For Miracle, he added a finger point and “stay.”
They found themselves on their sides, facing each other. Like in the car, Dean couldn’t stop himself from leaning in to kiss Cas. Driven in equal parts by instinct and by a desire to prove himself, he jammed his tongue into the angel’s mouth and slid a hand down his swim trunks. No hesitation.
“And what makes you think I’m here to see him?” Dean smiled.
Dean had the eyes of someone barely keeping himself together. He looked straight through his brother as he spoke.
“What?” Dean wondered.
“Yes.” Dean didn’t elaborate.
“Well, maybe dad should have gotten himself an angel boyfriend.”
Dean spoke sternly. “It’s complicated.”
Dean drove himself back to the bunker, to drink some more.
Dean shrugged at the concept of time. “I honestly don’t know.”
“Cas—”
“Cas?” Dean tapped his shoulder.
“...You know what? It’s nothing,” he said.
“He’s scaring them,” Eileen signed.
One corner of the room emptied of miscellaneous effects, and a seven-foot-tall balsam fir appeared in their stead, adorned by a glistening gold tree skirt. Dean thought about clear lights, and the tree became festooned with them. A bit lazy on his part, but no one liked stringing up lights. Next, he thought about tree ornaments, and a box of classic, blue and green glass ornaments appeared in his hands. Another box appeared in Castiel’s.
“Cas?” Dean reached out and pulled him into an embrace.
“I didn’t know you were coming,” she said.
Dean knelt before a tattered box on the floor, digging through his record collection.
“When you forced me to sing Ed Sheeran.”
“This is one of those fake battles you told me about?”
Someone even drunker than Dean turned the Roadhouse into a karaoke bar, and if there was one thing an intoxicated hunter couldn’t pass up it was karaoke.
“I kinda do.” Charlie shrugged, then changed the subject. “Oh, so get this. I invited Sam, and he said he was busy
“Dean?”
“Okay, bad example. How long do I sleep? Why do I sleep? When is my birthday? When is Sam and Eileen’s anniversary? When is Christmas?” The more questions he asked, the more it felt like an existential crisis.
Castiel pulled Dean’s arms down from his shoulders and held them, low.
Dean had never spoken about this to anyone. There was no one in the universe it would be easier to speak it to than Cas, but Dean still paused to secure his resolve. “One time... my dad was on a hunt, so Lee and I went back to dad’s hotel room. I mean, Sam was twelve. I wasn’t gonna bring him back to the room with my little brother in it...”
As they entered the barn, Dean stepped around a loose pile of rocks, only to nearly step on a board with an exposed nail. He kicked the board aside.
“Come on, then.” Dean grabbed his arm and pulled him toward the kitchen.
“No.” Dean gently removed Cas’s arm from his shoulder. “You’re not gonna do that to some poor…” He shook his head. “You aren’t the problem. Don’t ever think you’re the problem.”
“Okay, now drum up some apples,” Dean said.
“Sucks, doesn’t it?” he said to the fictional creature.
Dean took a drink, then smiled. “I’m sure I will.”
“When I said I love you?”
From above came a whooshing sound. Dean caught a brief glimpse of black, swirling tendrils—the same ones that had taken Cas—and shut his eyes. There was a cold, surprisingly metallic touch on his exposed arm and within seconds he felt himself become engulfed.
Dean’s face went redder than when he’d been given that rose.
Dean let out an exaggerated, fake laugh, then wiped all expression from his face.
And Castiel had to protect his. Slightly annoyed, he reached behind his back, pulled out the blade, and tossed it to the floor. His wound shrieked and emitted a burst of glowing light. He ignored it to continue pummeling John, whose face was so smashed and covered in blood that it had become unrecognizable.
Dean pulled away and looked into Castiel’s eyes, which were again filled with life. “I’m saying you were wrong about what you can never have. You can have me. You...already have me. I love you. I, uh...I’m kind of making this up as I go along. I don’t have the words to tell you how much I love you. I just do. And I want you to come home.”
“Tell me I don’t give orders.” Dean was pleading now.
“What are you talking about?” Castiel asked.
The angel didn’t let him interrupt. “—And that’s without deducting the years he was too young to remember or any of the times he ran away from you and your father. He lived nearly twice as long without you as he did with you.” He dug in deeper. “You just aren’t as important to your brother as he is to you.”
This story would only end with Dean miserable and alone if he let the past dictate it, and he wouldn’t. He refused. He stared at the lamp for a moment, then returned it to its place. With a thought, he returned the rest of the room to the way it had been. Then Dean walked over to the table, calmly pulled out a chair, and dropped onto it.
.” Far too pleased with herself, she improved that statement with a pun. “
Blood dripped from John’s mouth as he spoke. “You wanna hit me, Dean? Hit me.”
Charlie lay on the ground, half pretending to be dead. She turned toward Dean. “Psst. Hey.”
Around the table, rolls were passed and polite conversation was exchanged. Dean never stopped smiling.
Just outside the front door, Dean stood clenching his fists, willing himself to go inside. The light emitted by an injured angel was unmistakable, and it was the final push he needed.
“—As for sex...If that’s something you’re ready for, yes. Absolutely. But if you’re pushing yourself because you’ve set expectations and you think you have something to prove… You don't. There’s nothing you
Dean exhaled sharply. “Yeah.”
They did. The jokes were objectively terrible, but seeing Dean laugh hysterically at them made Castiel smile, which in turn made Dean think the angel liked the movie. This was the cycle that had led to Dean suggesting bad comedies over and over.
“I dare you to forgive yourself.”
Dean found that annoying and charming at once. He watched Cas watching him, anticipating an answer, and he felt compelled to give one. “My family. My
“Sam? I’m gonna need you to just tune out any prayers I may or may not have made to Cas...”
All of these options sucked, and he’d at least grown enough to know that.
“Really?” John asked.
“Obviously,” Dean said, annoyed.
Charlie glanced around to make sure no one was watching her, then scooted across the ground to get closer. She lay on her side, head leaned on her arm, angling for some good gossip. “I mean.” She tilted her head toward Cas, who was fending off four knights with a foam sword, then back to Dean. “Are you guys...together?”
Dean shrugged in acknowledgement. “Yeah, I did do that.”
“You’re not ready. That’s okay.”
He couldn’t finish his thought, let alone articulate it. Dean didn’t know what he’d hoped to accomplish. Mary had never been there the way he wanted her to be now, and it was unfair to expect her to be.
Dean squinted. “You’re not surprised by what he said at all?”
“Yeah.”
Some time after making his eighth mark on the wall, with no concept of how long he’d be waiting for his brother, Dean made the decision to visit his parents’ house, the one that once stood in Lawrence. It now stood, like everything else, exactly as far away as he wanted. For now, that was a short drive.
Dean cut him off. “
For Dean, each breath was a greater struggle. With Castiel to his left and Sam to his right, he spoke to both of them. “I love you.”
“Claire told me it’s a term of endearment,” Dean said.
“Yes,” Castiel said. He stood behind Dean, watching the scavenger hunt.
“Oh, and uh…” Dean snapped his fingers, and they were both in aprons, Castiel’s tied awkwardly around the trench coat he never took off.
“It doesn’t matter,” he said.
“Yeah.” Dean braced for a very angry brother. “Mom and I sort of… let him.”
“I’m sorry, Dean, but you’re not involved in this conversation.”
Then… Nothing. The Empty truly was empty. Vast blackness in every direction. Sam and Dean stood on nothing, looking at nothing, bracing themselves for a fight. None came. Human beings were so utterly insignificant to the Empty that it didn’t even register their presence.
Dean cracked an egg and leaned in to drop its contents into the bowl. In the process, he brushed against the angel’s chilly arm, and felt the cold run up the length of his own. He eyed the crust as it came together, walked to the sink, and came back with just a bit of cold water. He brushed against Cas again as he poured it into the mixture. His arm wasn’t cold in the sterile way the bunker was cold. It was a popsicle in August. It was diving into a lake. It was touching a snowball with bare hands. Dean felt alive.
It suddenly struck Dean. The enormity of an actual cosmic being—one with this much power, who had existed since creation and had seen stars form and burn out—falling from Heaven and directing its energy into baking and decorating trees with him. Into
Castiel replied with a weary nod.
Dean scowled because Sam had a point, but he continued anyway. “Because it’s Cas. How many times has he died or wandered off? He always comes back. He always
Dean stood, pulling Cas to his feet as well.
“No you don’t,” Sam said.
Castiel listened intently, and Dean watched him with the same enthusiasm. This was all so utterly insignificant, but the angel observed like it was the only thing that mattered. Dean became lost in thought, wondering what it was like to see the universe through Cas’s eyes.
“We love you,” Castiel said.
“Don’t be. You’re perfect.”
Castiel repeated something Sam liked to say. “Ignoring trauma doesn’t make you healthy.”
Mary thought about coffee, and two mugs of it appeared. She slid one to Dean.
“Don’t do that,” Dean warned.
Dean could feel his anger bubbling again—unwelcome, but present as ever.
“If we can use my powers to keep dough chilled, why can’t we use them to peel apples?” This was genuine curiosity. “Because you thought up the first idea and not the second?”
“You ready?” Sam asked.
Sam noticed that Dean didn’t share his sense of urgency. “—Or not?”
was stupid. I figured I was feeling some cosmic mojo and it was a mistake. Because what would a celestial being want with me?”
Castiel smiled. “Something like that.”
“So you’re Bobby Bobby... Not like... Imaginary Bobby?”
One after another.
“—Dean?”
“Forget about it.” Dean took a drink.
“You mean on another planet?” Castiel wondered. “No. I’ve been to Heaven, Hell, Earth, Purgatory, and the Empty.”
“Yeah?” Dean wondered.
“The internet,” Dean said. He did not add that he had practiced with a lamp.
The voices didn’t seem to be coming from anywhere. Sam and Dean faced each other, confused, where three paths met.
“Yeah, I think I might have been wrong,” Dean said.
“Dean—”
“I take it that didn’t go well,” Mary said.
“Drop it, Sam.”
come back. I could have kept fighting, and you and I could have really lived, and you wouldn’t be stuck with angels in your outfield.”
All Dean could say was, “Huh.”
“Good.”
angel.”
Castiel stared at Dean, whose face conveyed absolute terror at his accidental slip.
Dean blinked a few times as the hamster wheel in his brain spun in circles.
Castiel stood in a flour-covered apron, bewildered, trying and failing to crimp edges. That Dean stood behind him, with his arms wrapped around his waist, only made Castiel more flustered.
Dean sighed.
Dean wiped his eyes. “Oh what?”
“I want to know what happened to Cas,” Sam said.
The peaceful ride presented an opportunity for introspection, one that Castiel seized.
Castiel was attuned to this, and he stopped. “Dean?”
“You always do.”
“And I appreciate it,” Dean said over his shoulder.
“What?” Dean snapped.
“This is creepy as hell,” Dean said.
“No. We’re free to do as we please—
Castiel shook his head. “No. He left me alone here as soon as you arrived.”
Castiel’s hands glowed as he chilled them and mixed. “Aren’t there machines that can do this?”
?” Castiel spoke in exasperation, the irony of his next statement not lost on him. “Do you need anything else, or can I go?”
“I’m fine,” Dean said. His tense body language said otherwise.
“I’m sorry.”
son?”
“I don’t,” Mary said, perplexed.
Dean clawed at every bit of the angel he could reach, wanting nothing more than to feel every bit of him. He told himself he could do this, like it was some final obstacle to fixing himself. One act to wash away decades’ worth of trauma and repression.
makes it sound weirdly dirty. Second, what’s all the bee stuff about then?”
Castiel stood. “Yes. Things created here resonate with me in a way Earthly ones don’t. It takes some concentration to understand the flavor as a whole, but—”
Dean shook her off.
“The other Dean?”
Sam shook his head. “Are you already convincing yourself how this is gonna go wrong?”
“I know, but we don’t want to do it if it’s going to hurt you.”
Castiel tilted his head. “Don’t mistake my calmness for indifference, Sam. I lived for four hundred million years before I met your brother. I gave everything for the
“Okay…” Dean said.
Dean bit his lip and looked away, embarrassed.
Dean shook his head, thinking about how this was the worst cover story ever and hating himself for not just telling the angel that he wanted to see him. “No. It’s weird, right?”
“Ash figured out how to hack into anyone’s shelter. Nice place, by the way. I figured I’d come check in. You know, make sure you hadn’t found a way to
“I didn’t say I wouldn’t,” Castiel said.
The angel emerged from behind a tree, confused. “I’m right here, Dean.”
“I do.
“I’m sorry,” Castiel said. He opened his trench coat, pulled out an unlabeled bottle of something, and took a deep swig of Heaven’s finest 200-proof liquor.
“You know that metaphor doesn’t really work when I have a brother named
The couple ran down their vibrating stairs to find a glowing, furious angel floating over the foyer floor—one Mary recognized in an instant.
Dean rolled away from the stars to meet his gaze. “But if he was telling the truth, I’m even luckier than I thought.”
For a brief moment, Dean set his hang-ups aside to reach over and touch the angel’s shoulder. A question had been eating at him, and their conversation had finally made it relevant.
, while Castiel’s was modeled after an actual horse he once met in 12th century France. There was nothing special about that horse, but he’d enjoyed its company.
While the angel’s presence was the same as ever, his appearance was not. Dean faced a Castiel who had seen better days. Tousled hair fell over a tired face. A five-o’clock shadow surrounded chapped lips. His signature tie was missing, revealing a half-buttoned dress shirt. Castiel was absolutely worn out.
Castiel added, “That’s not a negative judgment.”
“Well, we are weird,” Castiel said.
“Me too,” Eileen signed and said.
Bobby set the pick. At Dean’s request, Bobby had invited John to have a drink with him, in the name of reconciliation. When Dean first proposed the plan, Bobby had used the phrase “son of a bitch” half a dozen times and swore he wished he could fire a rifle in Heaven. But in the end, he’d agreed, for Dean’s peace of mind.
“Yeah. What if I never get over it?”
“You interfere by
. There are over 7500 varieties of apple.”
The angel narrowed his eyes. “Not when you ask me to stay.”
“You don’t have to lie to me to keep me here,” Castiel said.
“You have nothing to apologize for.”
?” Dean asked.
Castiel moved in close and put a hand on his shoulder. He spoke so that only Dean could hear him. “You don’t need to put on a front—”
Sam shook his head, trying yet again to come up with a way to get through to his brother. After a moment, he took a different angle.
Dean snapped away the plates and pancakes, then stood. “Just, uh… Ground rules since you’re you and I feel like I need to explain this. There are no real weapons. You fight like you’re trying to have fun, not actually trying to kill someone. Can you do that?”
shoulder—and grasped tighter than he had since he stole Dean from Hell.
“What?” Dean whispered back. “We’re dead.”
“Yeah. I know,” Dean said.
John ignored that, and looked at his son. “How’d it happen?”
“I died younger than you did, you son of a bitch.” Dean had finally started speaking, and he couldn’t stop. “I died because you made me carry the whole world on my shoulders, so I could never stop hunting, never stop chasing cases that
“They don’t remind you of any other flying creatures secure in their purpose?”
Mary tried to help her son. “Dean has a date.”
“I know you can’t.” Dean sat down on the couch. “It feels like a while, though. It feels like something to toast to, or...”
“Cas, are you sure you wanna do this?” Dean asked.
In no time, they were naked. Castiel rolled on top of Dean and began worshipping every inch of his body with tongue flicks and kisses.
From there, they took their time chopping fruit and cooking it down. They also took their time rolling out the dough, which was much more intimate than Dean had ever imagined baking could be. At first, he demonstrated on a separate rolling pin. But Cas kept rolling with angel strength, leaving a tissue-thin bit of dough stuck to the counter. Nothing pie-worthy.
“Right now? Ellen and Jo. Ash. Rufus. A few random folks traveling through.”
“...I want to be worthy of your time, Cas. I mean, there is no time anymore, but...”
With a look of amused suspicion on her face, Eileen signed “thank you.”
“You really took your time getting here,” Dean said.
Dean spoke softly. “I took your advice and called Cas.”
“Like, in a good way.”
Sam, Eileen, and their kids moved out of the bunker and into a farmhouse a few miles down the road. Castiel needed the bunker space for another purpose: fostering as many children as he could. He’d known what it was like to live with no guidance, and what Dean went through with abuse and neglect. So he filled the bunker with wayward sons and daughters and showed them all the love he could.
“Dean, are you in love with Castiel?” Charlie asked.
“Don’t apologize,” Dean said. “There’s no reason my bullshit would be on your mind. You’re ancient. You’re like...a hundred years out from dad’s death. You play
Dean eyed the building. “Who all’s inside?”
“You’re in Heaven,” Castiel said. “I’m an angel.”
Dean resisted the urge to say “because it’s
“Heaven sucks,” Dean said.
Dean moved across the field toward the angel, with purpose.
“No, but you follow your brother when he’s lying to you.”
Mary stood resolute. “
Mary noticed the tenderness from the previously rampaging angel. She repeated herself, louder. “You knew Cas was coming here, Dean?”
“I left you alone with a nuclear toddler—”
“The one you had to kill in that bar?” Castiel asked.
Dean walked back to Castiel, knelt next to him, and watched the bees.
“And what?”
Castiel snapped a finger and the apples’ peels disappeared from existence. He knew that would get a rise out of Dean, and that’s precisely why he did it.
“For what?” Castiel wondered.
He grabbed John by the throat, and strangled him as hard as he could without destroying his soul’s form. Still holding him by the neck, Castiel slammed John into a wall.
Jack was already gone.
Dean was within inches of his face. “So?”
Dean answered apprehensively. “Eighty five.”
Castiel, unsure what he’d done to make Dean cry, pulled him in close for a tight embrace. He needed the hunter to know that—no matter what—he was safe and loved. He felt Dean’s desperate fingers digging into his back, forcing him to stay.
“Eileen will be along shortly,” Castiel said.
Sam squinted. “They were drunk.
“I think so.”
“So what are you saying—?”
Sam looked back over his shoulder to speak to his brother. It was a demand. “Go talk to Cas.”
It was such a simple question, without a simple answer. Dean stared at him for a long moment before he finally gave in and spoke. “You remember I told you about my friend Lee?”
have a wedding. You can honeymoon in Purgatory again.”
“What are you talking about?” Dean motioned to the tree, then at himself. “I’m thriving.”
A chorus of “Hold!” came from all around.
Naomi’s face became hyper-focused for a moment, lost in concentration as she communicated to the other angels. It returned to normal as Castiel removed his hands from his face and let his body relax. Dean helped him to his feet again.
“You two are gross,” Claire said.
“Well how do I fix it? What would Dean do?”
Dean sat on Baby’s hood, in front of the Roadhouse, sipping a road beer. In his mind, the debate that had been turning over since he arrived in Heaven became more and more heated. He’d failed at talking to Mary. He’d failed at talking to Sam. Dean considered that maybe his brother was right and it was time to call for Cas. The deep unease in his gut told him he wasn’t ready, but there weren’t many options. It was this or suffer in silence.
“He brainwashed you into hiding his mistakes for him.”
“No.” Dean tried to soften his tone. “No. I mean… You and Jack rebuilt it, right?”
Finally, Dean stood up. “Yeah, uh…Good to see you, but I was just getting ready to leave…”
“I forgave you a long time ago. Were you listening when I confessed to you?” Castiel had tried to absolve Dean. Clearly it hadn’t worked.
There were no things to hunt, so it was this. Saving people. The family business.
“Yeah. I have for a while now.” Sam dropped the gloves and stood to walk toward his brother. “What’s wrong? Where’s Cas?”
“You sent your old man to
Dean bit his lip and turned away again. “Cas made a deal with the Empty. If he ever experienced ‘true happiness’ then the shadow would take him. So…” Dean paused and took a breath. He turned back toward Sam, his heart racing. “He told me he loved me, Sam. Like...
“Have you ever played Truth or Dare?”
Castiel turned away from the stars and toward his human. “That’s a nice thought. But if the other Castiels didn’t rebel, they probably don’t have you. I do believe you’re the one who brought that out of me.”
“There’s no reason you shouldn’t be able to turn angel radio off, right?” Jack wondered. “That seems like a free will thing.”
“I know. But there was beauty underneath and it’s only gotten more beautiful with time.”
Dean’s stomach sank. “What?”
Dean sighed. “We raised a weird one.”
“Cas is alive,” Dean said. “Jack brought him back.”
.” Sam gave his signature look of disappointment. “Have you been sitting around waiting for me to show up so we could relive your glory days?”
The flickering intensified, but again returned to the park and the bench. Dean’s eyes watered as he stared at dream Castiel’s blank expression, with eyes that had none of their signature compassion.
“Well, don’t they know he doesn’t want them being dicks?”
Dean brushed it off. “I’m too pretty. I’d steal the spotlight.”
“Thanks,” the brothers said at once.
“It’s a little weird, Sammy.”
“It’s not about the plot,” Dean said.
Castiel scored again. 5-0. End of game. “Why?”
He didn’t mean for it to come out so demanding. He never did.
Faintly, in the background of everything, they could hear Dean’s voice in place of nature. Not this Dean, but another Dean.
Dean had been completely convinced that Cas was about to call him out on his half-flirty bullshit. When he didn’t, Dean’s expression and tone drifted toward confusion. “What?”
“You can. That’s the point.”
Dean looked down at the ground and shook his head, then looked back up at the earnest angel. Cas hadn’t budged. Part of Dean wanted to extend this standoff, but another part was as flattered as it was flabbergasted.
“It wouldn’t matter,” Castiel said.
“Try… something’s totally fucked,” Dean said.
“Nah. You both deserve some kinky, non-wrinkly sex. I know better than to get in your way. It’s Heaven so, uh… I’ll be around. Don’t really have a choice.”
“What?” John asked.
Dean made a contemptuous little snort, be he thought about it.
Dean lifted a lamp from a table, ready to smash it like he had everything else. But he observed the wreckage he’d been taught to make and stopped. He didn’t want splintered chairs strewn across the floor. He didn’t want broken glass under his feet. He didn’t want the life John had raised him for.
