. Who needs him anyway? All he does is feel sorry for Castiel and wallow in his insecurities, even when Castiel is willing to accept him the way he is, nothing more. Castiel has been managing himself, all alone, before Dean stepped into his life. What difference will it make if he leaves?
man struggling with his sexuality. He’d sounded strangely hesitant about it. It's best not to ponder over things like these, he decides. He likes Mr. Green as a friend. And he wants it to stay that way.
You and I, we're different people. You're young, sweetheart, you have so much ahead of you. You, Cas, you'll grow, you'll discover. You're not even thirty yet, for crying out loud." Castiel's lips twitch with annoyance, but Dean continues, "
Castiel digs into the pocket of his jeans, retrieving a bunch of keys, one of which he shoves inside the keyhole to his front door. Dean pulls away for a few brief moments as the door creaks open and allows Castiel to lead the way.
I’m not worth it, Cas.” A hiccup accompanies Dean’s words, muffled when it drifts across the wall, but Castiel hears it in the utter silence between them.
"I don't know what's happening, Dean." Castiel croaks and his voice is low and strangled, muffled over Dean's skin. Dean wants nothing more than to push away anything and everything that has been bothering Castiel, that has been hurting him, but he doesn’t know where to begin, so he simply resorts to rubbing a hand over Castiel’s back.
Silence fell upon them once again, and Castiel wondered if Dean wanted to say something more, perhaps sing more praises and hymns in the name of Lisa, or perhaps he wanted to leave this conversation, leave Castiel and the awkwardness between them. Perhaps he did. Perhaps he always had wanted to get Castiel off his back. Perhaps he was enjoying his time without Castiel.
Another finger joined the first two inside Castiel's tight, tiny pucker, and Dean smiled, resting his forehead against Castiel's chest as he continued to finger Castiel's hole with the blood on his fingers. As repulsed as Castiel
Dean smiled, and held his hands out, urging Castiel to come closer. The catboy smiled, and with a soft giggle, walked into Dean's arms, dropping the rag and the duster at Dean's foot, as he fell against Dean's chest and wrapped his arms around Dean's neck, scooching his ass until he was sitting snug in Dean's lap.
"And that's something you need to work on, but it doesn't mean I'll stop liking you," Castiel argues back, and
"Yeah, erm, you must be Castiel? I've heard so much about you from Ms. Mosely." She chuckled, and even her breath smelt of strawberries.
"Gonna' make sure you're always happy, always smiling," he continues with a moan, and his lips wrap over Dean's nipple as he scoots back, dragging his taint over Dean's cock as he does so, evoking a loud moan from the latter. Grabbing the lube from beside him, Castiel coats his fingers in the cold gel, and dips them between his thighs, rubbing them over his hole and pushing his fingers in with a loud grunt. Dean's lips drag up his navel, kissing at the freckle next to his nipple, and reaching down to slip his dry fingers inside Castiel's wet hole.
Part of him is aware only Dean has the power to change his decision, and until Dean does so, no amount of convincing or pleading will make him stay.
When Castiel had moved into a noisy suburb of Central Lawrence one winter morning, he had never expected a boy with dark, clustered freckles, apple-green eyes and three broken teeth to show up at his door and beam at him, introducing himself as Dean Winchester. Castiel, timid as always, had initially found Dean too intense for him, since the boy was always off getting himself into trouble, but soon enough, the two boys were inseparable. Where Dean was, Castiel had to be, and where Cas was, Dean was. Having been through elementary, middle and almost all of highschool together, since they were in senior year now, the two of them had been friends for longer than anyone else.
"Stop making fun of me." Castiel’s words sound whinier than he means them to, and he crosses his arms over his chest. Of course, this isn’t the first time Dean has mocked him for his vocabulary; he’s always saying something along the lines of, ‘
Gabriel had to leave for work. His diner in the downtown was facing an issue with legalities, and Michael had a conference meeting in New York that evening. Both of his brothers would return late, somewhere in the night, and Castiel had the house all to himself. Had it been any other occasion, the house was certain to be filled of the sounds of two young, seventeen-year-old boys playing video games, laughing, fighting, and snoring until evening, but today the house was silent. Pin-drop silent.
That makes sense. Dean moving to New York to detach himself from the memories back home, now it makes sense— This must be why he couldn’t answer Castiel the day the first spoke, because he wouldn’t have wanted to be revisited by those memories.
bit more vigilant, he'd have realised Dean had already known who Castiel was. He'd already known he was being followed day and night.
"Dean, I'm gonna' come—" Castiel warned, and much to his surprise, felt a broad hand wrap around his little cock, pumping and stroking him.
Which is why, sat here on a crowded love-seat, in Benny's farmhouse, which was dark, only lit with glimmering neon lights, music blaring loud enough for it to shake the ground, and the room reeking of alcohol, vomit, and sweat, Castiel sipped at his paper cup, which had been filled with some beer, some water, a strange combination, and it tasted disgusting, but somehow, as long as Castiel had something to sip on every now and then, he didn't mind. Benny had his arm wrapped around Castiel's shoulder, and clearly, he was looking for fun. Castiel hadn't known Benny swung that way, but in a very earnest and drunken way, he had confessed to Castiel about wanting to fool around with another boy, and Castiel, having had a little too much of the diluted beer, had smiled and accepted. Anything to distract himself from Dean.
He recalls waking up in a white, bare room, his back on a foreign bed, an insulin tube in his wrist, and, most glaring of all, the large, white plaster over his face. It hurt, son of a bitch, it hurt. There had been a flurry of people around him, some whom he knew, some whom he didn't. Nurses, medics, his army friends, talking to him about shrapnel, and blood, and God, and miracles. He recalls, just as vividly, staring at himself in the mirror for the first time after the surgery, the urge to hide his face, to scream, to wrap a cloth around it and never see it again, the emotion rising in his mind, his heart beating faster, the tears spilling over his face
Sam pauses for a moment, pulling back and rubbing at his own hand as he regards Castiel on the bed. Dean simply tugs at the hem of the blanket across Castiel's thigh, and pulls it up to the angel’s chest, unable to help himself as he runs his fingers through Castiel's hair with a gulp.
curse, the thing you love the most, from the true depths of your heart, or in Dean's case," she pauses, a knowing glint in her eyes, "-the
"What do you want me to say? It's two in the morning, you're back at my doorstep, after three months of being MIA, you reek of blood, which I know for a fact is not yours, and you're here to spend the night. What can I possibly say?"
With a fond roll of his eyes, he turns back. Alicia is near the coffee kettle now and she sends him a knowing glance.
"My sweet, lil' kitten, just what did you think you were doing with those panties, huh? Bending over to show them off, walking around with your ass so ripe and tasty, did you want me to see you?"
"Oh," Dean hummed, as if surprised, but a moment later, his fingers returned to Castiel's cock, and Castiel sighed in relied, tears spilling to the ground as his face fell against Dean's shoulder. Dean's hand soothed his back, murmuring in soft, coaxing words, "-good boy, so good for me, so good."
He’s the complete opposite of Dean. Dean will shout, Dean will hit, punch, knock over things. He blazes with rage, but only for a few minutes or hours. Cas isn't like that. He keeps things inside. He lets them simmer down, but never fade away. Dean has seen this in the few words they spoke about Castiel’s childhood. About his parents.
Growing stillness envelopes them and Castiel breathes in deep, letting his shoulders go lax as he lounges back against the wall.
A long pause, and Castiel wonders if the man has walked away. Before he can dismiss the thought, though, he hears the faintest of chuckles behind the wall.
"Hey, uh," the alpha said, and Castiel couldn't remind himself what he had originally turned to the alpha for. All he knew in that moment, was the pair of deep green eyes gazing into his.
"Is that why you married me, Cas?" Another finger jabs at Castiel's waist, and Castiel can't contain himself anymore, as he lets out a chuckle, "-'cause you hate me so much?"
There is something so inscrutable about the expression on Castiel's face, as if he's at odds with himself. Part of him, still in awe, wants to smile, Dean can see that, but part of him, still coherent, knows where they stand, knows how things have been between them, and it restrains Castiel from smiling. He's angry, yes, but there is affection lacing his emotions, and God, it's almost too easy to see the adoration in his round, blue eyes.
A rich laugh drifts across, and Castiel narrows his eyes onto a random tile on the floor, attention focused on Dean as he speaks.
"Cas?" Dean asked, pushing the door open, but Castiel held it ajar, his heart pounding, his breath constricted, his chest tight and heavy— it was nauseating, the scent of fruit and sugar emanating from the couple, and he wanted to turn away and hurl his guts out, but in answer, he simply raised an eyebrow. Dean's eyes narrowed as he studied Castiel, and Castiel felt his skin on fire under Dean's attention, but he quickly cleared his throat and caught Dean's attention.
"Fine, I'll... I'll send over some documents. Please make it quick, Dean. And if you get calls from the council, let me know. Also, for God's sake, check your goddamn e-mail."
In response to Castiel, Dean simply nods, and lets Castiel's fingers explore— watching much more intently than feeling— as Castiel unbuckles Dean’s belt, undoes his jeans, and pulls them down to his thigh. Castiel pauses for a moment, as if hesitant and unsure as he stares down at Dean's boxers, but Dean rubs his thumb across his cheekbone, and with that, Castiel seems to melt into the touch. His fingers pull Dean's boxers down, and his eyes widen as Dean's cock springs up in his face.
With that, Castiel turns away, taking a step forward towards the entrance to his apartment, but a hand on his shoulder stops him.
Dean beams at Castiel's words before slapping the top of the car, a distinct glint of adoration in his eyes.
Wide eyes regard Dean, and he watches as Castiel opens his mouth, about to argue, but the loud sound of a throat hitching behind them draws their attention, and both men turn to Sam, who teeters on his feet a few steps away.
everything is nothing but a flurry of colors, of lips, of sensations Dean feels for the first time, and wants to feel for years to come. It's as if the single brush of Castiel's lips has revived Dean from a death he's never known, as if Dean will never need anything else in life, except Castiel by his side, touching him, kissing him, melting so pliant and giving in his arms.
"Obviously not. You need at least seven hours, or six at the very least, to let your body function. That is unless you’re a superhero, in which case I'm sure you don't."
And now, with his angel in so much pain, crying, groaning, shivering in Dean's arms, Dean can do nothing but lay with him, and run his hands through his hair.
As Castiel turned towards the door of the bedroom, deciding to let Dean rest and venture outside, he was reminded absently of the day he'd found out he was expecting. It had been a few weeks of constant nausea when Dean had scolded Castiel for not taking good care of himself, and booked him a meeting with an omega-medician. Of course, even when Dean had scolded him, his voice had never raised. He had simply held Castiel firmly by the shoulders, looked him in the eye, and told him,
Then she mutters something Castiel doesn't really catch, maybe something he would have if he wasn't busy glaring at her, and she giggles and walks away. A hand, Dean's, slides over his on the table, and Castiel compels himself to tear his eyes away from the woman as she disappears behind the counter.
"I can't do that," Dean says after a pause, and although the answer doesn't surprise Castiel, it prompts another tear to slip down his face.
"Alright. I have a class to attend," Castiel sighed, and stepped away, wondering if Dean was glad he didn't have to speak to Castiel anymore.
He simply doesn't feel the need for a partner. Besides, if he ever got down to wanting one, he's sure he'd have to search far and wide to find someone who understands him. It's a typical excuse for people to say so, but Castiel means it. Vanity means nothing to him, what
“Fine. Fine. You want me to forget you, right? I won't wait for you to leave; I'll start right away."
The utter defeat, the helplessness. This isn't Castiel. If there is something Dean has learnt in the two months he spent with Cas, it is the fact that Castiel is someone who will always keep smiling, keep fighting, keep being optimistic, even when the weight of the world is caving him in. Through the exhaustion of work, or the harrowing incidents with his family, Castiel never loses hope. And to hear someone as optimistic as Castiel sound so dismal only has Dean aching with guilt.
, and rub his cute nose when the dust troubled him, how he would hum the tune to Dean's favourite song when he washed the dishes, how he bounced on his feet as he tried to wipe the top of the windows, how he swayed his hips when he mopped the floors, how he bent over the desk to dust it, how he smiled to himself when something was squeaky clean.
Dean's chest is heaving with quick breaths, his eyebrows furrowed, his veins flaring and all he can see is red.
There it is, that childish pout on Castiel’s face as he leans back against the counter across from Dean, his eyes roaming anywhere but to Dean.
"These marks on my neck, your release inside me, our swollen lips— you have branded me as your own, Dean, and although I know the relationship we share with each other is odd in nature, forbidden too, dare I say, I can't help it anymore. Ever since we were younglings, we've shared everything with each other. For you to hide things from me now, especially after we've become one in the most intimate manner possible, it hurts me."
"I know, Dean, forget about it, I, I... I'm sorry I brought it up. We're looking at the negatives of things, which is not a good habit, let's— let's look at the, the," he fumbles, fiddling with a scraped nail on his finger as his eyebrows shoot up, "
"There are seven billion people in the world, Dean. There must be someone. You'll find them one day."
"So," Garth started, clearing some of the thickness in the air, "-I've heard ya' wanna turn this ole' place into a hotel."
“I’ll be right here,” Dean says, and Castiel walks over to his bookshelf in his bedroom, eyes scouring the various paperback books, finger dragging along the spines of a row of books as he purses his lips, narrowing his eyes until his finger stops on a particular book.
Using Castiel's pliability to his own advantage, Dean gripped Castiel by the hips and plowed into his swollen, red hole, their gasps filling the air, before at last, Dean felt the pressure in his gut pop, and he paused, still buried deep inside Castiel when he came. Thick, hot semen filled the tightness of Castiel's ass, and Dean felt himself grin as he wrung his orgasm to its fullest.
Castiel paused, and Dean felt him give up on pushing Dean away. He stood rooted to the ground for a few minutes, and Dean drowned his lungs in Castiel's fruity scent. Somehow, it seemed as if Castiel was contemplating something, considering something very deliberately, but Dean couldn't be less bothered.
Now she would wear it around the school each day, when she would pull Dean down to kiss him before class, when she would run to hug him during lunch, when she would sit on her bench and pass notes with Dean that made her giggle, when she would sit in Dean's lap on the bleachers where they made out— she would own it. She would own Dean.
He bit down on the fabric of his shirt as Dean's large, veined hands slid up his chest, sending shivers down each nerve in Castiel's body. His thick, long fingers pressed into one of Castiel's perky, stiff nipples, and toyed with the bud, squeezing it and pulling it, before Dean ducked down, his eyes glinting red before changing back to green, as he wrapped his tongue around a dusky nipple.
allowing Dean enough time to move his own mug aside. A moment later, his jaw is being held in Castiel's soft hands, gentle lips brushing against his own, and as if on cue, Dean's hands slide around Castiel's waist, pulling him in, closer and closer, the faint, bitter taste of coffee dancing on their tongues, paired with something so uniquely
"Are you stupid? Or are you deaf? Or are you blind? Can't you see it for yourself? How much Cas wants you? Can't you see it in his eyes? In his voice?"
Silently, Castiel grabs a clean wash cloth from behind Dean, wets it under the warm water, and drags it down Dean's chest. His green eyes flutter open at the touch, and fix onto Castiel, whose eyes follow the movements of his hand on Dean's chest.
Dean grins at the last bit, leaning back against the counter as he swallows down Blue's words with a sip of beer.
"Ah, Blue, I can't get enough of your voice. It's becoming a vice for me. Your voice is my vice." Green laughs again
"Oh, uh, my apologies if I'm prying, you just mentioned it earlier, and I thought it had something to do with me, since I play some music at night before I go to work."
"—He warned Orpheus that for no reason must he look back while his wife was still in the dark, for that would undo everything he hoped for. He should wait for Eurydice to get into the light before he looked at her," The Empty continues. Dean however, struggles squirming and grunting, as he feels his lungs being crushed, his skin being burnt, and his nerves ablaze—
"Yes alpha, need your fingers inside me. Need your tongue," Castiel moaned and heard Dean groan out loud. A glance behind showed him Dean was palming himself, the tip of his cock nudging against Castiel's round, meaty ass, and a few seconds later, Dean let go of his cock in favour of running his thick fingers down Castiel's taint. Castiel felt his cock twitch at the touch, but he willed himself to remain put as Dean slid a finger through the slick dripping down his thigh. He gathered some up between his fingers before bringing it to his lips, and Castiel watched, gaping, as Dean sucked those fingers into his mouth and let out a vulgar moan.
"No way, did you make this yourself?" Dean asks, and Castiel nods in response, only to remind himself Dean can't see him.
Jack straightens up, a guilty look crawling across his face, and Castiel smiles. Of course, he hasn't. But Castiel doesn't quite blame him. After all, he's got homework and assignments
"You should some time. There's this play at the theatre downtown, about a queer man struggling with a new relationship and the ghosts of his past, and although the plot seems bleak, the monologues, the direction, it's all simply beautiful. You could watch it someday, if you ever want to watch a play. It's a truly moving story, if you ask me."
"Good boy," Dean hummed, and at once, his hands were gentle where they cradled Castiel's jaw, and a soft kiss pressed against Castiel's forehead. The fingers on his nipples returned, delicate and insistent, as they massaged Castiel's nipples, squeezed them and pressed them, all tenderly, and Castiel felt himself float closer and closer to ecstacy. His cock leaked thin, clear pre-come, and his hole quivered with the need to be touched.
"That seems way more believable than the prospect of me finding someone actually decent to date, if I'm being honest."
Dean watches for a moment, awestruck, as Castiel opens his eyes and straightens. They glow bright blue for a second— the way they always do when Castiel is using his grace— and Dean finds it hard to tear his gaze away from the sight, but then Cas is pushing down on his fingers, and Dean realises— something slick and wet coats his fingers, and he snaps his eyes up at Cas in question.
The scent of the ocean, salty and yet airy; the scent of heaven— rich and inviting; the scent of comfort.
"Dude, did you see Adler's face? Back in class? When you pointed out the correction in the equation, man, that was awes—" Dean's words broke off, and Castiel glanced back at Dean, who had been trailing him around like a lost puppy, but he wasn't walking. No, he wasn't talking either, he was frozen. His face was turned towards the side, and Castiel watched the movement of his eyes as they rolled to the side, and at last, Castiel's wandered over to where Dean had been staring.
—Dean, and pressed to his side, Lisa. They were sparkling, Dean looking charming as always in a rich, green button-up, the sleeves of which tightened around his biceps, and Lisa in a short, black dress with a pair of fuzzy, red, thigh-high socks.
Without the obstruction of a wall muffling his voice, Castiel's voice is clearer, much deeper, and it reminds Dean of a glass of neat whiskey.
Castiel considers it for a moment before smiling. Stepping back, he reaches for Dean's hand as they walk into his bedroom. Castiel switches on a dim, yellow light which illuminates the room only partially, and Dean allows his eyes to wander around. Castiel’s bedroom is minimal. Book shelves on both walls, a large queen size bed, and a few paintings hung on the bare walls.
In the library, seated side by side, a bottle of whiskey shared between them, Sam and Rowena sigh. They share a gaze, before breaking into a smile.
Castiel's heated, moist hole swallowed Dean up without hesitation, and Dean gripped the boy's hips to steady himself as he rocked his hips forward and pushed in, feeling Castiel's constricted, fleshy walls open up around his cock until he finally bottomed out.
"Man, you don't know how good it feels to hear that," the man says, prompting Castiel to laugh, and the sound is loud enough to drift across.
"Oh, you can come in. You don't have to be so formal," he says, and Dean nods. Thankful for the heat inside the house, he zips his hoodie down, pushing it off his shoulders to bundle it in his arms as he walks into Castiel's kitchen. He feels a little shy in the back of his mind, but the moment Dean is in the small room, Castiel is regarding him with a soft smile.
Castiel jumped back, his heart pounding in his chest, only to find a woman, short and aged, with spiky white hair, dressed in a sober-colored midi dress, standing at the base of the staircase, watching him. The scent of tangerines, laced with something quite distinctly
The movement seems to draw Dean out of his slumber, and his eyebrows furrow before he breathes in deep, loud breaths, and shifts on the bed, tightening his arms around Castiel. His vivid green eyes flutter open, still hazy with sleep, and a fleeting second of confusion strikes him before he gives a smile.
"I'll miss you too,” he hums, “-But it's just a few hours, Mr. Green, and you need to be sleeping. Why don't you try some cold milk?"
Benny laughed, and his breath reeked of alcohol, but Castiel didn't pull away, instead letting himself press into Benny's warmth as he hummed.
Dean planted his hands on the marble counter on either side of Castiel's hips as he thrusted in, as deep as he could physically get. Around his cock, Castiel's wet, heated flesh opened up, swallowing him in inch by inch, and Dean felt himself slip into a trance where he could comprehend nothing but Castiel.
." Sam sighs and folds his arms across his chest as he leans against the wall beside Castiel's bedroom door.
"One, I don't understand your intense concern about my dating life. Two, how do you know about Grindr? Actually, don't answer that, I feel stupid for simply asking."
With every passing word, a smile grows on Castiel's lips. When he finishes reading, he folds the note with as much caution as he can and sets it down on the coffee table before reaching for the package. The letter made it clear Mr.Green has sent him a book; now the question eating away at Castiel— which book is it?
Silence meets Dean's ears, and he knows he did cross a line. After all, the fact that his neighbour is sharing this with him doesn't give him the right to preach to him.
“I- I’m sorry, I was being too preachy. Sorry, sorry, I shouldn’t have said that, you don’t need to feel liable to answer—"
He ignores him, and picks up his feet as he begins to walk. He's thankful for the momentary distraction, but his mind still wanders back to Castiel.
Fresh, steaming hot coffee drizzles into Castiel's favourite honey-bee cartoon mug, and he shuffles over to the side of the counter, grabbing a creamer for his beverage. The warm, bitter-sweet aroma of rich, unadulterated coffee drifts through the air as Castiel rips the creamer packet open, pouring it into the mug as the last few drops of coffee drip down from the machine.
Castiel let out a petulant whine, before fisting the bedsheets and rocking his hips back on Dean's finger. Soon enough, one finger was replaced with two and the stretch inside Castiel's ass grew larger. His rim burned from having been pulled open for so long, but he had no intentions of stopping, not even when Dean let out a string of curse words and added a third finger.
It was a man, with short, spiky blondish-brown hair, a chiseled face, bright apple-green eyes and dusky freckles. He was dressed in a plain, crimson-red plaid button-up, paired with dark-washed jeans, and his figure was firm. Muscular arms and bodies which screamt of his strength, and held in his right arm, a blade. Not just any blade. The First Blade.
love is stronger than the love Orpheus had for Eurydice. The conditions remain the same. Castiel shall follow behind you, every step of the way, but one glance, even a tilt behind, and the angel remains lost in the depths of the Empty forever. However, if you make it to the portal, the two of you together, the angel is yours. Forever."
"Cas," Dean called out one morning when Castiel was at his locker, grabbing Castiel by the arm, urging him to turn back. Castiel glanced at Dean, before turning back to his locker and rummaging through it.
In a split second, Castiel felt something in his neck crunch, and then, it was complete, pitch-black darkness.
He sips his coffee, pursing his lips as he leans back against a support beam, one he's adorned with pieces of abstract art he'd bought at an auction last year.
"Now, one of you, turn him over and try to wake him up. It's crucial that he remain conscious, even if not awake," Rowena says, and Dean notes how Sam doesn't even make an effort to move, knowing already of Dean's initiative. Dean, to Sam's credit, does move at once, and walks over to the bed to lean down over Castiel, his hands slipping under Castiel's shoulder while the other runs though his hair.
"You're probably the only person I know who doesn't want to move into his own house. What has New York even done for you? Come back, Dean, please."
"Have nothing else to do," Castiel breathed out, and let his head fall back against the cold, stone ground.
"Out here?" Castiel asked, as he pulled away, dizzy with Dean's scent engulfing him, hands still wrapped around his mate.
Dean's eyes slip shut. There's an urge rising up in his throat, to let out a sob he's been holding back for long, one he's been trying to suppress all this while.
Dean paused for a moment, and Castiel bit the inside of his lips to refrain the laughter bubbling at the back of his throat. Dean's green eyes went comically wide, and his mouth dropped open. Castiel couldn't contain himself any longer as he let out another laugh.
Dean glances down at his duffle bags, then up his own chest, before facing Castiel with an amused grin.
Moans spilt past Castiel's lips as Dean's hands wandered up towards the zipper on the back of Castiel's space-suit, the other curling around Castiel's head to protect him from the metal door. Castiel curled his back into Dean's touch, feeling the zipper slide down, slow and tempting, and Dean pulled away from their kiss, instead diving into the depths of Castiel's neck. A whimper escaped Castiel's throat, and he felt himself squirm in Dean's arms with need and arousal. His cock grew heavier, and strained against the fabric of his suit, when at last, the zipper unraveled, and Castiel felt his suit fall open from the chest below. The musty air in the room kissed his skin, leaving goosebumps over his flesh as he let his head fall to the side to allow Dean to suck marks into his skin.
Castiel feels the hair on his arm stand as Dean’s voice filters through the silence, allowing Castiel to focus on nothing but the grit of Dean’s voice.
The door to Castiel's room clicks open. Dean leads the way for Sam and Rowena to follow, both with a bowl of funky-smelling pulps in their hands. The room is dark, only illuminated by the soft, orange light at the corner, and Dean eyes Castiel, who is still fast asleep on the bed, his back to Dean, but somehow, he appears smaller, weaker than he did in the morning. The blanket is tangled between his legs, and he's curled up against a large, thick pillow.
"And you promised you wouldn't ditch me," Castiel mutters, "-guess we're both breaking some promises."
"But I'm going to be bored without you." Green whines, loud and clear and it draws a chuckle from Castiel.
Dean groaned, loud enough for the sound to echo through the shack, before he slammed in deep and hard, and his piping hot come filled Castiel's ass. Silence filled the room for a few seconds, as Castiel cried— so close to orgasming, yet ruined in a split second when Dean stopped— until Dean spoke up.
There's a concern in Castiel's eyes, so genuine and unconcealed, it warms something inside Dean's chest as he gazes into Castiel's baby-blues, squeezing his hand around the angel's.
"Could be the tun—" A sharp glare from Castiel shuts Jack up, and Jack purses his lips, a peculiar amusement glinting in his eyes as he watches Castiel struggle with the instrument.
The bow slides against the strings, and a note, heartbreaking and morose, unfurls in the air, breaking through the silence. Dean wants to shut his eyes and immerse himself in the sound of the violin, each note better than the previous, but his eyes stay fixated on Castiel, on Castiel's face, the furrow of his eyebrows as his intense blue eyes move along the strings, the parting of his lips as he sucks in a silent breath, the slide of the bow, the curve of his fingers on the neck of the violin.
"You know what?" Castiel's words break into a laugh, and he grins, trying to refrain his amusement from hindering his speech. He presses a hand to his mouth to muffle his laughter.
Some nights, when it's just the two of them, Dean often sits with Castiel in the kitchen, their thighs pressed, and a bottle of whiskey in front of them, their face close, eyes drowsy, and breaths mingling. In moments like those, Dean finds himself wanting to be even closer to Castiel. Closer in way he's never wanted Castiel before. Closer in a way he's never wanted from anyone before.
Dean gives an indignant groan.  "The air conditioning, it doesn't work. I've been sweating all day."
Pain courses through Dean's body, subtle yet unbearable, as he hisses, and digs his hands into his head.
Passive green eyes stare off into the distance with a cold, frigid glint. It's unusual of Dean to remain so silent, especially after they make love, or find themselves in the midst of it. But Castiel is nothing if not devoted to Dean, and he knows Dean, better than Dean probably knows himself. He knows what every twitch of his lip means, every shallow breath means, every passive stare means.
"Niccolò Paganini. He's one of the best violinists of all time. People say he sold his soul to the Devil to play the way he does. He had fingers so long, he could play three octaves at once," Castiel says, and Dean laughs.
"I'm close—" Dean mutters into Castiel's ears after a long silence, as their bodies rock together and writhe together on the bed in pleasure, and Castiel nods.
"Of course, Dean." Castiel smiles, and their eyes meet for a brief second, before Dean is pulling him down, under the guise of stealing a kiss, but in truth, he slips his cock inside Castiel so as to distract Castiel momentarily from the discomfort. Castiel catches on, and heaves a sigh inside Dean's mouth, resting his forehead against the other's, as he adjusts himself to the feeling of sinking down on something.
"Don't you ever feel like pursuing your art? Not everyone can do that, but Blue, you're really special. Haven't you tried joining different orchestras or, I don't know, whatever thingies those musicians join? I mean, the pay wouldn't be as good, but at the end of the day, you'll be doing something you love, right?"
"Because if you weren't," Castiel cradles Dean's jaw in his hands, "-you'd be much happier about the decision you made. Rule of thumb, Dean, the happiest choice is always the hardest one. But I don't blame you. You've been through enough, and you don't need the guilt. So, go, before I kidnap you and imprison you in my one-room apartment." A wet chuckle falls past Castiel's lips, and though he expects Dean to smile at the jest, he doesn't. His eyes harden, something along the lines of guilt blooming within them, and he pulls away, his hands sliding down Castiel's arms to hook through his fingers, before Castiel pulls his hands away.
"Just please," he called out, hoping Dean could hear him, "-go away Dean. Leave me alone. You're not thinking—" Before he could finish however, Dean was walking over, no, he was marching over to where Castiel was standing, and in a split second, he grabbed Castiel by the front of his t-shirt, and pinned him against the tree, their faces close enough for Castiel to lean in and taste Dean's lips again, but the cold, rigidity of Dean's gaze had Castiel rooted to the ground.
"Yes, and you stepped in my way, and blocked me. The curse hit you, and yet, you kept saying you didn't feel anything. What about it?"
"Hey." A voice drifts along from behind the wall, only muffled in the slightest for today has been quite educational for Castiel, especially in terms of the thickness of his walls. Good to know if the building ever collapses, he'll be dead in ten minutes flat.
"Dean," An exasperated groan accompanies the sound of Dean's name, and at once, Dean turns to Castiel, who Dean discovers now, is shivering, and to his anguish, Castiel groans, his weak, pliant body curling into itself as tears roll down his face.
"Jesus, not another quote, you walking thesaurus of a man," Dean groans, causing Blue to laugh. His voice fills Dean's ear like a harp as he catches his breath and continues speaking.
"Do you know why I'm here?" she asks, and cups Castiel's sullen face in her hands. Castiel shakes his head, reminding Dean of a young, naive child, and his heart aches to see his love so battered and agonised.
At once, Castiel pulls away, and his hands brace the side of Dean's face as he stares down at him, eyes studying every inch of his face, lips trembling and eyes intense.
, that wasn't the best-case, that was, erm, that was the, erm, third case scenario. Not best. No reason to be best. Simply a possibility. Not like Dean has been thinking about it for years. Not a chance.
And Dean? Dean doesn’t even care. No, he doesn’t have a single clue. But that doesn’t mean Castiel is going to tell him. Because the moment he tells Dean what he’s feeling, he’ll just make it worse. He’ll ruin the friendship he already has with Dean and he’ll make it painful and awkward for them both, more so for him, since he’s the idiot who is in love with a man he’s never seen, never met, only heard, only
Dean hummed and chuckled around Castiel's nipple, pushing his tongue flat against the nub before licking a thick, fat strip down the pinkened flesh. Castiel's cock grew heavier, and his toes curled as Dean crept an arm up towards the other nipple, rolling the nub between his thumb and his finger, pulling it and pinching it, stretching it away from Castiel's skin, sending a wave of arousal and pleasure crashing through Castiel's body, drenching his nerves in pure ecstacy— ecstacy Castiel knew was forbidden.
?" Round, intrigued eyes peer down at Dean, and for the first time since the morning, Castiel somehow resembles his usual, curious and naive self.
. Not like he's going to see Dean. With a sigh, Dean lets Castiel lace their fingers, and he feels the tug of Castiel's hand towards him.
Fallen as he was, Castiel nodded, now devoid of every shred of self-respect and dignity. Oh yes, he would love it. It was dirty, filthy and so utterly human to give into his carnal needs.
"Fuck, Castiel, you're so fucking gorgeous, shit, I can't even keep my hands off you for a second—" Dean growled, the sound reverberating through every inch of Castiel's flesh. Slick pooled at the bottom of his underwear, seeping through his pants and dripping down his thighs. His senses could comprehend nothing but Dean, as the alpha somehow managed to manoeuvre them into the backseat of his big, black car, and shut the door behind them. Castiel's sling bag fell to the floor of the car, and the sweater-vest Dean had pulled off him was thrown to the front seat without much care.
Castiel was used to seeing Dean bruised and battered. Used to seeing the man he loved soaked with blood. Usually someone else's.
And Dean decides, screw it. Screw everything that's been holding him back, every doubt, ever fear, every insecurity. He isn't doing this for himself, no, he's doing this for Castiel. Dean
With a heavy sigh, Castiel pushes his phone away, only for it to vibrate with a loud buzz on the wooden table. Alicia throws him a glance at the sound of the vibration and Castiel swipes the phone back into his hands, staring down at it.
A shiver ran down Castiel's spine, and although the look on Dean's face was quite promising, he doubted Dean would ever go through with something against Castiel's consent.
"Asking questions, are we? How about I make you a deal? I answer your question, you answer mine. Sound good?"
In the blink of an eye, Dean's face smooths out into something inscrutable, and he pulls Castiel close to bury himself in his shoulder, a loud sob breaking through the silence between them.
With one last glance out the window, Dean picks up his pen and writes in big, bold words that stretch across the page:
With that, Dean pressed his lips to Castiel's, and Castiel whimpered, expecting Dean to pull away, instead—
"Course you do," Dean sniffles, and swipes a hand across his nose. Castiel sighs, but his arms slide around Dean's neck, pulling him in until Dean's cheek is pressed to Castiel's chest. Both men shut their eyes, and Castiel presses his lips to Dean's hair.
"But," he starts, and Castiel slings his backpack over his shoulders, slipping his white sneakers on as he waits for Green to finish. "
The lighter falls to the counter next to him and the paper drops from his hand into the sink until not a single trace of it, except for the char on the sink wall, remains. That too, dwindles away the moment Dean twists the tap and a stream of water gushes out, sucking down the drain what was once a confession of Dean's love.
A loud, mocking gasp travels across the wall, and Castiel presses the back of his palm to his lips to control himself.
At once, a silence crawls between them, and Castiel stares at him with such wonder-filled eyes, Dean finds it hard to refrain himself from stealing another kiss off his adorable, puckered lips.
The filthy promises, paired with the feeling of comfort and arousal engulfing Castiel had him turning over onto his stomach. He quickly spread his legs apart, putting his pink little hole on display, and heard Dean gasp behind him.
With Dean's cold, green eyes staring into his own, drawing him in and yet, pushing him away, Castiel realised something.
"M-master," Castiel gasped, and arched his back as Dean dipped his hand under the frilly, black skirt and rubbed the lace fabric of the pantie over Castiel's hole with a thick, long finger. At once, Dean felt slick dampen the fabric of the pantie.
"I need to, buddy. This is for you, alright, so you can get better soon. I'll be around if you need anything. Now come on, let Rowena help you."
hurt, Dean." Castiel breathes out, a soft, lewd smirk lingering at the corner of his lips as he drags his foot down Dean's neck and presses it into Dean's chest.
In twenty-three minutes flat, Castiel is packing a container full of ravioli and roasted vegetables and leaving it outside the door of Mr.Green's flat and once back inside, he knocks on the wall.
"Oh," Castiel says, his eyes wide and eyebrows raised, before a soft, red blush spreads across his cheeks, "-is it...uncomfortable?"
of course they knew what would follow soon. The last few months, as much as Dean hates to admit it, had been strained. He abided to every whim and fancy of his father back in Lawrence. He cared for him for as long as one can for someone as stubborn as John Winchester. But his mind had been at turmoil, doubts itching within him every second of every day, weeks and weeks of sleepless nights, hours and hours of prolonged silences, and if by chance sleep ever did lull him away, the thunderous explosions in his memories would shake him back to consciousness.
A sharp silence meets Dean's ears in response and he sighs, popping the cap open before pressing the beer bottle to his lips. He puts the call on speaker and sets his phone down on the counter. Gulp after gulp after gulp, he downs at least half of the bottle in a single go and hisses when the bottle falls away from his lips.
What Castiel hadn't realised all the while he had been distracted by his pondering, was that Dean had rid them both of their clothes, and now he had Castiel lying naked and smooth and tempting right under him, with his tiny omega cock bouncing against his stomach.
Funny how the universe works. How it plants people in your life who make you feel invincible, only to uproot them when you need them the most.
Dean laughs at Castiel's use of finger quotes, finding the action surprisingly endearing. His laugh subdues into a brief smile and he nods his head, taking a sip of his coffee.
"I don't know what to do." he whispers, his bottom lip trembling, and Sam, hearing him speak for the first time in so long, stares up at him with wide, wonder-filled eyes.
It leaked a large string of thick, white pre-come at the tip, and Dean gathered it across his fingers, only to spread his pre-come over Castiel's tight, pink puckered hole. Castiel hissed at the touch, letting his head fall forward, when at once, Dean's long, thick tentacled tongue snaked around Castiel's neck and squeezed it. A loud whimper felt past Castiel's lips as Dean choked him with his long, snake-like tongue, and yet, he found himself giving in and arching his back as Dean's fingers, simply two of them, thrusted into his tiny hole.
His head is dizzy, pounding with the slight traces of an oncoming headache, thumping deep inside him. He wants to hold Dean, the same way he did last night. He wants to stay in his arms, wake up with him, go to bed with him, kiss his stupid, salty mouth, listen to his favorite rock songs with him, hear his signature ‘
Dean's hands retreat from him, from his face, from his waist, and at once, Castiel yearns for the touch, only to be met by Dean's disgruntled huff as he rolls over onto his back.
Castiel's face remained pressed against Dean's bulge, but somehow, Castiel wasn't simply aroused, he was amazed.
,'” he finally says. “You're my friend, Castiel, of course I'm going to bother, of course I'm going to give a shit about you."
"Hey Winchester," Benny called out, drawing Castiel out of his trance, and he tore his eyes away from Dean, instead letting them wander down to the ground. He untangled himself from Benny's arms, scooting away and putting a good few inches between him and Benny, "-c'mere brotha, it's been days."
The rim of Castiel's hole burned with the stretch, aching in pain unlike Castiel had ever known, and yet, he craved every second of it, as he held his legs up for Dean, like a perfect little slut, and let Dean thrust up into his tight, wet, heat with a loud string of curses.
for being super supportive and just an amazing freakin' human being and helping my (kinda clueless ass) with corrections and advice. It was so fun having you with me on this journey, K. I'm so grateful to you.💖
With a sarcastic roll of his eyes, Castiel dislodges from Dean, and grabs his hand, dragging him out of the kitchen and into the living room, where he urges Dean to sit down on the sofa. Dean watches as Castiel grabs a slender violin case from the shelf across him and unlocks the case with utmost care. Although it's no surprise how delicate Castiel is with his violin, Dean does find it quite endearing, since Castiel always treats everything with such sensitivity.
"I wish I could have said it when you needed to hear it. I wish I could have been just a little bit braver."
A silence ensues between them as Jack continues to down the slice of pie, gulping before he speaks up.
"Why? S'our home. We can do anything we want," Dean mumbles, nibbling Castiel's ear lobe between his teeth as he noses at the side of Castiel's head. His fingers graze over one of Castiel's sensitive nipple, and Castiel lets out another moan, arching back into Dean's touch, mouth dropping open in pleasure. As if on cue, Dean brings the hand inside Castiel's shirt out through his collar, and hooks his thumb over Castiel's bottom lip. His narrow, lust-hazed eyes track every moment of Castiel's body— the heavy contractions of his chest, the twitching of his fingers, the furrowing of his eyebrows, and most of all, the sliver of his pink tongue that dashes out Castiel's lips to swipe a lick over Dean's thumb, showing just how aroused he is by Dean's touching.
They walk, rather, Castiel drags Dean towards the door, until they're inside the elevator, pressed up against a corner with Dean's hands on Castiel's waist, Castiel's hands on Dean's shoulders, their faces diving in for a kiss, and another, and another.
"Like shit." Castiel grumbles, and Dean snorts, glancing up at Sam, who has a half-smile on his face.
Round, blue eyes peer up at him, soft plush lips parted with uncertainty, and messy black hair swaying in the breeze greets Dean. Unable to swallow the lump in his throat, Dean finds himself speechless as he stares at the man in front of him.
Jack laughs, unfazed by their affectionate banter. He turns around, reaching up in a brief hug before pulling away.
. And he hates small talk. Dean finds himself liking his unique conversations with Blue. Maybe it’s worth a shot.
Castiel's gasps and moans filled the air, paired with the sound of Dean growling at the back of his throat. His fingernails had grown sharper, his skin greener, and his body bulkier. It shadowed Castiel completely, and the feeling of having someone, or rather something, as big as Dean manhandle him, it spiked the arousal in his veins. His nippled perked and rubbed against the cold metal as Dean laved his tongue over Castiel's neck, lathering Castiel's skin with drool as Dean sucked large, purple marks into Castiel's skin.
"You know what, I surrender. Mint chocolate it is." He laughs for a few seconds, before continuing, "Jeez, I feel like a kid high on dopamine."
. They hang in the air, a sword looming over Dean’s neck as the ticking of the clock in the room intensifies, only reminding Dean of Blue’s persistent silence.
Castiel chuckles, and Dean's hands slide over his waist, pulling him close as he massages the back of Dean's ears, at his nape, and over his head, stepping back to let the water pour through his hair and wash the shampoo away.
I hope you all enjoyed this one! I'll be participating next year as well, hopefully. Let me know your feedback in the comments and don't forget to leave a kudos! Once again, thank you to my beta, my artist, as well as the moderators for allowing me to enjoy this new experience so much! Love you guy!❤✨
A loud, exaggerated sigh drifts across the wall, and Dean grins, scooping more noodles into his mouth.
"I'm sure the pup knows already, just how amazingly wonderful his father is." Castiel let out a soft grunt as he stepped onto the final, top-most stair, and Dean chuckled, still holding onto Castiel's waist to help him.
So, this is what he has been missing out on these past several weeks. Part of him does enjoy their moments spent in anonymity, but another part of him, seeing Castiel move so seamlessly in the kitchen, yearns to spend more time with him like this, to hold him, wrap his hands around his firm, warm body, to kiss the soft skin at his neck, to be the only one to make Castiel laugh, to make him smile, and
A hand snaked around Castiel's waist and over his cock, stained red with blood, and it stroked Castiel's cock in a hot, tight grip, until the sensations became too much for Castiel, and he orgasmed, his come splattering against the wooden-plank flooring, and his cock went soft and limp. The cock inside his ass— Dean's cock, slipped out with a wet squelch, and thick, white come dripped down Castiel's ruined, red hole. It quivered and gaped for a moment as Dean pushed some come back inside, before another stream of come slipped out.
There is palpable warmth exuding off Castiel's skin, and it almost tickles the hair on Dean's arm, but before Dean can think of it, Castiel turns, and it appears to take him much effort to do so.
About seven to eight performances later, Jack is playing the tune quite well. The tone, although a bit sharp to the ear, has improved quite a bit from the moment they began. Castiel makes a mental note to teach him about better body language in the next session, for they only have about ten minutes left now, and these ten minutes are simply for a cool down. Castiel believes excessive practice tends to warp one’s judgement. The larger the breaks one takes, the better one is able to listen to music with a different perspective each time. He follows the same principle for his own practice.
In retrospect, every past response has always been to blame the circumstances. But when Blue puts it this way—
Castiel obeyed, turning around wordlessly, and bending over the countertop. Dean watched, awestruck, as Castiel spread his legs open and grabbed both cheeks of his ass in his hands to pull them apart. The thin fabric of his pantie sunk into the narrow depths of his ass, and the lace rubbed against his pucker beautifully. Dean's eyes tracked every inch of his skin with a predatory gaze, and he dragged a finger over Castiel's thigh— up his netted stockings and over the round, plump flesh. Dean grabbed one of the cheeks in his hand and squeezed it tightly.
"I'd actually prefer if we didn't watch anything tonight. Maybe we could just talk. About anything you want. Play some music, maybe, is that alright?"
There’s truth to his words, so Dean quirks his bottom lip, nodding his head as he takes another swig.
Castiel asks, for lack of better words, as he grabs a cotton swab and soaks it with disinfectant. Dean hisses at the first touch of it to his bruised skin, and reaches up to cover it from Castiel, who only pushes his hand away, meeting Dean's eyes with a single pleading look.
, only for them to leave, settles like a boulder on Castiel's chest. It's a bittersweet feeling, if he's being honest, for he has found a friend like no other friend he’s had before, and he knows now, how dearly he must cherish his time with his friend. Still, the foreboding feeling of being left alone in a few weeks' time nags at Castiel.
Mr. Green will simply laugh, taking Castiel's ominous warnings in good spirit, before yelling out a loud ‘
"No, no, the tuning can't be wrong, I did it myself about ten minutes ago. Jack, pay attention to the notes, please. Play it from the top."
"You know, all this time, people kept blaming the circumstances I was in. They blamed my seniors, they blamed the times, they blamed everyone but me, trying not to burden me with their opinions. Never once did I expect a stranger to put me on the spot and tell me, maybe not to my face, but nevertheless, about the blame being my own."
A finger to his lips, Cas's finger, has him shutting up at once, pin-drop silent, and his eyes glance down at the finger on his lips, before snapping up to meet Castiel's again.
, and thrusts into him, his pace inexplicably fast, and Castiel moans as he nails his prostate with every other thrust. The space between their bodies allows Castiel to reach for his own cock, as he strokes and tugs at it, before Dean is pulling out, leaving his hole gaping and empty, and Castiel's shut eyes flutter open to settle on him.
There it was. Castiel's sob story. He'd learnt to ignore his feelings, push them down, not ponder upon them.
"No." The prince breathes out softly, and Dean hums to himself. Cautiously, he glides his hand higher over the Prince's leg, watching his highness with a sharp, lewd expression in his eyes.
"Oh, that wouldn't be very nice ov' me." Garth chuckled, and hitched his frayed jacket closer to his chest. His eyes met Castiel's, and he sent Castiel a polite smile, before glancing down at his stomach. Castiel felt conscious for a moment, before Garth's eyes lit up.
A silence follows their words, and both men simply take a moment to drink in the feeling of laughing with each other. Castiel is right about to speak up, ask about Dean’s plans for the day, when the loud, prominent ringing of Dean's phone travels from the other apartment.
"It's homophobia, of sorts, but against bisexuals. And when you internalize it, you're convincing yourself what you identify as is wrong. You look for ways to brush your doubts and your feelings away, you try telling yourself what you feel is fake, or what you feel is a phase, or that you can't be attracted to more than a single gender, and that's the worst kind of hatred, Green, because it eats you from the inside out.”
"All was well. Nothing could separate the two. They lived for each other, they would die for each other. Nothing but pure love, trust and forgiveness prevailed in their hearts. Eurydice loved Orpheus to the ends of the world, and Orpheus, in turn, loved her enough to
The elasticity between them snapped at last. Dean surged forward to press his lips against Castiel's. Castiel let out a delicate moan before going pliant in Dean's arms. His hands slid up to wrap around Dean's neck, while Dean slipped his thigh between Castiel's legs to rub it against his growing erection which strained against the lacy fabric of the panties. Not a moment after Castiel had let his head fall back, Dean was pressing his lips to his jaw and across his neck, sucking bites and nips into his tender skin, and Castiel was a moaning, crying mess against the counter, his cock leaking and wetting Dean's thigh with pre-come.
Pants and gasps fill the room as all three men rush over to each other. Dean gives Castiel a hand, and pulls him up, before tugging him towards Sam, whose chest heaves as he stares down at the body on the floor, the gun in his hand lowering.
Rowena's demeanour changes at once, and she leans forward on the chair, her intense eyes flickering between Dean and Sam.
Still unaware of Dean's presence, Castiel continued to hum under his breath as he glided across the kitchen floor, grabbing mugs and whatnot, but Dean could do nothing but remain rooted to the ground and
It’s not like Dean would lie to him, especially about something as serious as this, and Castiel stands by that. He only feels a bit startled by the fact that all of this occurred in the span of a few days, and somehow, he ended up being the
Silence follows his words— a heavy silence, where Castiel has things he wants to say, and he knows Dean must be curious too, and yet, he can’t convince himself to speak. It frightens him for a moment. This bizarre hesitance. Why can’t he say anything? He’s read Dean poems before, various poems, so how is today any different? There’s a sudden, he doesn’t know how to explain it, a sudden
"There is no home base and there are no dates. Shut up." Castiel flushes red, and shaking his head, rises from the sofa and stretches his arms out, lips falling open in a large yawn, as he squeezes his eyes shut. Dean grins.
Heats were rare for Castiel, given how he'd been using suppressants for more than half of his life, ever since he'd started studying at a beta-dominated university. Although suppressants worked best for the time being, when it came to the long-term effects, they were devastating.
make me feel, nothing could ever come above it. So, yeah, Cas, ‘m gonna’ stay here, and I don't know what I'll do, if I'll have to sell the house, or if I'll have to get a new job, but I don't care. I'm going to stay here, and I'm going to make you happy every damn day. I'm going to make sure you never, ever get hurt again."
When morning comes, a few hours later, Castiel wakes with a sense of ease and calm. He hasn't slept so well in days, especially not without Dean by his side, and he awakes well rested. With a broad grin on his face, he reaches out for Dean. But his hand falls upon the naked bed, sinking into the mattress.
"That's not what you should be sorry for." Dean's voice had dropped to a whisper, and yet in the silence, it was louder than Castiel expected it to be.
The man gives an exasperated sigh, and Castiel picks up traces of a troubled mind. Although he can't see the man, he can hear him, and that is indication enough for Castiel.  "It's... It's complicated."
A heated flush spreads across Castiel's body, and he sucks in a sharp breath, breathing in the musky scent of Dean's flesh, before leaning down and pressing his tongue flat against the tip of Dean's cock. For the first time in a long while, Dean lets out a noise— a loud, hissing
"Is this how you speak to your teacher?" Castiel feigns an offended gasp, leaning back into the soft cushions, as he crosses a leg over the other.
Dean felt his heart squeeze and he smiled, stealing a quick peck off his catboy's lips, before pulling aside his panties and thrusting a finger into Castiel's tight, young pink hole. Castiel cried out for a second, gasping Dean's name as he held onto Dean's shoulder, feeling Dean twist and plunge his finger deeper inside him.
And with a haughty laugh, Dean popped his jeans open, and let his cock— a huge, fearsome thing slap against Castiel's tender, plump asscheek. He stepped in closer, until his cock nudged against Castiel's hole, and rubbed the leaking, pink tip against his taint.
"Dean," he whines, surprised at the neediness in his voice, as he leans down, meeting Dean halfway into a soft, languid kiss. The dry touch of Dean's lips against his own isn't by any chance, new, but considering the time they've spent apart, his lips feel foreign, inviting and tempting, and somewhat different. Dean tastes of whiskey,
The moment Castiel's foot stepped across the threshold of the manor, a gust of wind— cold, bleak, sharp— coursed through the door and punched Castiel straight in the gut. Something odd, something strange lingered in the air, and he reached for Dean's arm on instinct, squeezing it to call for Dean's attention. Dean paused for a moment, and Castiel turned to tell him how uneasy he felt, as if something was churning inside his chest, but seeing Dean's face, he paused. Pure, unadulterated joy was written across Dean's face and at once, Castiel couldn't find it in himself to tell him. Rebuilding the manor from the ground up, owning the credits to creating one of the most luxurious hotels of the new world— it was everything Dean could ever dream of.
In a brazen show of assurance, Dean steps forward and laces his fingers through Castiel's. The action has Castiel fluttering his round, expectant eyes up to Dean's, and his lips turn down in a soft frown.
Castiel noted how Dean shifted his weight from one leg to another, how he avoided Castiel's eyes, "-Just, erm," Dean swallowed, "-I wanted to tell you that, erm, I'm dating Lisa now."
A heavy silence follows Castiel's query, and for a single moment, Castiel can do nothing but shut his eyes.
"So good for me Cas," Dean coos, smothering Castiel's face and nape with soft pecks, and lingering at his neck to leave another nibble, "-come for me baby, I know you want to."
"I'd rather cry in the silence of my room than down here, Mr. Kreschner," Castiel says, rather bluntly.
Castiel felt himself flush at the praise, his cheeks tinting pink, and he looked away blushing, still burning up from his heat, still slicking profusely from his hole, and yet somehow, he'd never felt more at peace than he did now. At last, Dean's hand in his head stopped moving, and he glanced up at Dean in question, a small hum escaping the back of his throat, but Dean in turn, simply pulled his cock out of Castiel's mouth.
"You're gorgeous, Castiel," he says, not bothering to mind his insolence, since in answer, he gets a soft whimper from the prince, who looks away from Dean with crimson-red cheeks, "-and shy too? I thought you wanted this..."
, Castiel scurries into his bedroom and pulls his closet open, releasing a bundle of clothes poorly folded tumbling to the floor. He pushes them away, back into the closet, before grabbing a pair of jeans and a sky-blue tee-shirt, one Jack had once complimented him on. He'd said it matched Castiel's eyes. Without another moment wasted, Castiel changes into his clothes, splashes some water on his face and brushes his fingers through his hair in an attempt to pass as presentable, before grabbing his wallet, keys and phone, and stuffing them into his pocket. He downs the remnants of his now lukewarm coffee, and, as expected, around half-an-hour after Dean left, a knock echoes on the wall in the living room.
It's a weight bearing down on Dean, pushing him into the earth, deeper and deeper. It drowns him, holds him under water, compels him to breathe in a lungful of water. It's a boulder, crushing Dean down as it falls from the sky. Dean can't hold on. He can only fall. He can only crumble.
"Oh, by the way, Castiel, you know a good joint to grab some grub on the way? I'm starving. I've been driving here for hours, just to buy this little devil here," Dean said, glancing at the watch on his wrist, before digging his hand into his pockets to fish out his wallet. The picture of a blonde woman and a young child sat snug inside it, but Castiel knew better than to pry deeper.
"You won't leave?" he finds himself asking, over and over again, still shaken, still in awe of Dean standing in his arms, unbudging and firm, his lips kissing each inch of Castiel's face.
He yawns, so wide it makes Castiel chuckle, and he turns onto his back to stretch his arms out before grinning, rolling onto his side and burying himself within Castiel's arms, nosing at his neck, hands sliding around Castiel's waist, under his shirt and over his bare skin, pulling him closer.
Castiel continues upon Dean's silence, and though he doesn't mean to scold Dean or admonish him, his voice is higher, firmer, and he feels the regret unfurling on Dean's face.
"No, I don't think I'd like to be in a relationship that lasts a day and a half." Castiel frowns, and a soft look gleams within Dean's eyes as he takes a pause.
"Go on, baby, I want you to come all over your skirt. That's what a dirty little girl would do, wouldn't she?" Dean growled, and snapped his hips until he was pounding into Castiel with all his might, his orgasm creeping closer and closer. Castiel's hands fell back to grip the edge of the counter and his legs fell open wider around Dean as he knit his eyebrows together and rocked on the counter with his toes curled . Dean watched as his cock came in thick, white splurts and painted his skirt. The come stuck to the fabric, and Castiel almost went limp, but Dean hadn't finished with him.
Silence hung between them, and the only sound filling the air belonged to the sound of their gasps and pants. Castiel paused for a few seconds, before hooking his fingers through his panties and pushing them down. Dean watched as the lace rolled down his smooth, slender legs and his thick, meaty thighs, before pooling around his ankles, and then Castiel was turning around.
"Uhm," Castiel hummed in thought, now brought back to the present, realising he was here to hunt for music, not ogle at green-eyed, dark blonde-haired alphas. Perhaps he must have frowned or grimaced because the alpha's eyes widened.
You see, Castiel had not seen many alphas in his life. At school, there had been more betas, and well, the alphas were always kept away from the omegas, for biological reasons, of course. By no means was this Castiel's first time being attracted to an alpha, but it was the first time he had ever felt something ring so deep inside him, that too, in the span of such a short time.
Sitting in a corner in his room, since all his furniture was packed up and transported a few days ago, his phone in his hands, thumb hovering over Castiel's number, Dean glances at the time on the screen. It's already past eleven at night. It's a Saturday, which means Castiel doesn't have work, but it's also Dean's
"Sure. Hey, uh..." Dean's voice has changed, in the way Castiel knows it does when he's trying to change the topic of their conversation. Castiel braces himself. "
Dean shrugs and looks between Sam and Rowena. She composes herself and shuts her eyes, her eyebrows furrowed as she tries to recollect something. She mumbles something to herself, before fluttering her eyes open and settling them on Dean.
A loud wail echoed through the room as Castiel's eyes widened, his jaw dropped, and his body curled into Dean's touch. His hole, his poor, tiny pink hole, now gaped around Dean's cock, and Castiel cried thick, fat tears when he felt Dean's cock bottom out inside him. Deep. So deep. Too deep. Absently, Castiel grazed a hand over his stomach, and found it bulging with Dean's fat cock plunged deep inside him.
met Castiel's nose, and he let out a deep breath, reaching up to press a hand against his chest, where he felt a slight ache, as if something had been punched into his lungs. If Dean were to find him, he would surely admonish him for scaring himself in his state.
"Oh, uh, anywhere is fine. As long as we're together." Castiel smiles and notices how Dean's eyes linger on him for a few seconds before he turns with a hum. They stop at a car, black and very...
"I met Mr. Kreschner downstairs. He told me." Castiel pauses, disbelief still lingering in his mind, before he asks, "
"I like your laugh,” says the voice, and Castiel falters, a warmth washing over him as he tucks his hands behind his back
"I got you, angel," Dean says, his voice barely a whisper as he noses against Castiel's head, nibbling a hickey at the soft flesh over Castiel's neck, rocking their bodies together— his chest pressed flush against Castiel's back— and pressing a trail of kisses down Castiel's shoulder. He lets go of Castiel's hands, and as expected, Castiel doesn't bother pushing him away, instead, he reaches back to grip Dean's thigh, all the while Dean loosens the knot of the apron at his neck, letting it fall to the ground as he kisses over the smooth skin at Castiel's nape.
Castiel huffs and furrows his eyebrows, narrowing his gaze at no one in particular, as he reaches for the pegs. He tightens the first peg, only to find it tuned right, and moves onto the second one, once again grinning smug to himself when it's on the right pitch, and moves to the third—
In the distance, he can spot the faint illumination of the golden rift hovering in the air. Relief floods his veins.
. How he laughs like a child. How he speaks with the wisdom of a saint. How he gets pouty when Dean teases him. How every time Dean hears him speak, he never wants him to stop. How every time he's concerned for Dean, his voice heaves with emotion.
"I know you're not sure of what you feel right now. And I get it, if I was in your place, I'd be scared too. It's strange, being in love. Giving yourself over to someone. But this isn't some ordinary dating thing, Dean, and we're
Dean watches, rooted to the ground, dumbstruck, as Castiel lays back down, bending his knees above the sheets, and spreading his legs apart. Dean's eyes remain fixed onto the sight as he watches Castiel's silk robe fall open and expose his smooth, golden flesh. Flustered, Dean shifts his gaze away, towards some mundane space under the bed, and continues.
Fear rose through Castiel's being, but with the growl escaping Dean's throat, and the way he grabbed Castiel by the hips and hauled him close, it was quickly overtaken by arousal.
, he thinks, as he transitions into the chorus, an effortless, easy transition, and a smile graces his lips as he draws in a breath, letting his body go lax as he plays the song to completion.
him. It was dry— there was nothing to lubricate its way in, and the feeling of it felt nothing short of a hundred needles piercing into Castiel's skin, and yet, part of him preened at having swallowed the intrusion inside. That was when he realised.
thumping in my veins. They’re the best for a reason, am I right?" There is excitement thrumming in the man's voice, and Castiel smiles to himself. He doesn't really know if the man is right, but he's believes him anyway.
Castiel was supposed to be at the Winchester's place, helping Mary with the pies in the kitchen while John and Dean set up the table, and Sam, Dean's brother, followed after Castiel like a puppy, eyes wide and tail wagging when Castiel taught him about a new scientific discovery. Michael and Gabriel were supposed to bring over meat and wine, and gifts for the Winchester family, and they were supposed to eat lunch together, laughing and chatting. Castiel and Dean were supposed to head up into Dean's room, and fall back on the bed, their bellies bulging with food, with Castiel always falling asleep on Dean's arm and Dean waking him up when it was evening.
the positives of our situation, alright? We have a month left. Thirty days. That’s a lot. Especially if we make the best of it."
Castiel rolled his eyes, already finding himself annoyed by the alpha, and yet, equal parts amused, and shrugged.
"Dean, I need you, please—" Castiel moans into their kiss, and his eyes flutter open for a moment to watch as Dean's lips drag down his neck, nipping at a mark he left on Castiel's neck. All Castiel can do is thread his fingers through Dean's hair and urge him on as their eyes slip shut and Dean moves up once again to capture Castiel's lips in a soft, prolonged kiss, where he nips at Castiel's bottom lip, drags his tongue over the seam of their lips, and works his hands at Castiel's waist.
"Shut up," Castiel mumbles, and when his eyes shut, he finds himself at peace, at ease; finds himself falling into tranquility, one he finds only with Dean.
Somehow, with the coherence in the alpha's words, it seemed Castiel was the only one so heavily affected by the lingering tension between them.
"Cas. Be honest with me. How much did it cost?" Dean asked, anger seeping into his voice, and Castiel stepped back, slightly afraid of Dean's reaction.
"So good for me, Cas, how about this, you answer another question and I'll do something about this," Thick fingers grazed against Castiel's leaking, throbbing cock, and he gasped, burying his face deeper in the refuge of Dean's arms, finding himself unable to move or speak, as Dean wrapped his palm around Castiel's cock, and stroked it in lousy, slow thrusts, driving Castiel closer and closer to the edge he'd been teetering on.
When Dean turns back to Castiel, he half expects the angel to be sullen, to be disgusted, to be– anything but glad. However, the look on Castiel's face is that of partial confusion, of blank amusement, as if he thinks Dean is playing some stupid, cosmic joke with him.
"Dean—" Castiel shouted, his eyes going wide as he bit back a round of tears, and dropped down into a crouch to gather his notes, "-I said no. I won't help you."
so easily. All he knows is one moment he's sulking Dean's upcoming departure, the next he's chuckling, head falling back against the wall.
"I was just..." Castiel starts, his hands running down Dean's shoulder to link with his palms. His eyes wander behind Dean to the park they'd walked through the night before. In the daylight, it appears much livelier. "-I was going to ask you if you had time for a walk?"
"Hm, a little birdie told me there's this guy next door to me who loves hamburgers. Thought I'd leave some out for him."
"So...? Are you sure?" Castiel asked. If Dean was telling the truth, which somehow he looked like he did, that meant Dean was Castiel's—
for Cas, or whatever. Maybe the spell was wrong, maybe it hit Castiel before I could stop it, maybe–"
"'Course I did. Look what I had waiting for me. Can you believe how stupid I was? Giving this up?" Dean gives a wet chuckle, and Castiel nods, his emotions getting the best of him as he lets out another sob, squeezing Dean's cheeks in his hands as he nods.
Castiel answers, and walks into the dark kitchen to grab Dean a beer, cautious to remain silent, lest the sound wakes Sam. He has a history exam the next morning, he needs the best sleep he can get.
Dean is in the bedroom. Fast asleep. He'd fallen asleep quite early the night before, considering the fact that out of the two of them, Dean was the one who'd been facing issues with his insomnia. Of course, Castiel wasn't complaining. The weight in his arms was something he never knew he'd crave so much.
Castiel pulls away, sliding his soft palm over Dean's jaw, thumb grazing over the dark red cut across Dean's lips, eyes following the action until Dean winces, and Castiel pulls his finger away.
"Mhm, I guessed. And why'd you need to be, huh? Bet your pretty omega hole hasn't ever been fucked before has it?" Dean scoffed, and bit down on Castiel's nipple, eliciting a loud moan from the omega, "—do you know how much you
He slips a hand around Castiel's waist, pulling him in until Castiel is stumbling into his arms, and slides his hand under Castiel's shirt. A palpable shiver courses through Castiel's body at the touch of Dean's cold hand to his warm, supple skin, and he curls his back into the kiss. Castiel's hands end up gripping Dean's shoulders, and Dean decides to show Castiel just
Dean's self-restraint melts away at the sound of those words, and without another thought, he slides his hands under Castiel's chest, and embraces him from behind, folding his arms over the prince's chest and stomach protectively as Dean kisses the side of Castiel's head, and pants into Castiel's ears. His hips move on their own accord, snapping back and forth, and his senses lose comprehension as he feels the tight, wet heat of Castiel's insides wrap around his cock, constructing his cock and sucking it in.
Twenty minutes later finds them jammed into the side of a booth in a bustling diner at ten-fifteen in the morning, and Castiel can barely hear himself over the chatter in the diner. There's the scent of various different spices, most prominently oil and meat, and with how hungry Castiel is, the scent only causes another rumble to shake his stomach. The diner is wide and spacious, white tiles on the floor, and a bright red paint on the walls, with weird, rock band murals. No wonder Dean likes this place.
"I hope you enjoyed today." Castiel smiles as he regards the young girl, his student, standing below him, her blonde curls falling against her shoulders and framing her face as she grips her pink, princess-themed backpack to her chest.
Castiel’s eyes find Dean’s, and he traces his fingertips down the side of Castiel's arm, a wistful expression passing between them as they gaze at each other.
"Fuck, so close, omega," Dean groaned, his head falling back as he rocked into Castiel's mouth, his hard erection thrusting against the back of Castiel's throat when at once, Castiel felt Dean's broad hands wrap around his cock, stroking him to his orgasm.
For a single second, the warmth of Dean's arms was all Castiel would ever need, for the rest of his life.
"Bigger than an apartment flat. It's a suburban house, Cas, just in a not-so-suburban place in Lawrence.
"Well, it's… it's a part of me, and I know that, but it's a part of me I've tried to ignore for a long time. I mean, back when I was exploring everything, I'm talking back in the nineties, early two-thousands, bisexuality wasn't really considered a real thing, y'know. You were either straight, gay, or trans. I guess I always knew I liked men, maybe not more than women, but yeah, still. But I ignored it when I was in high school. Ignored it when I was enlisted. Kept ignoring it."
"But... But..." Castiel's voice weakens. Then, as if something changes inside him, he slumps down, shoulders going lax. He breathes in a deep breath, eyes wandering passively over some thread on Dean's shirt, before he purses his lips and sighs.
Castiel falters, eyes bulging out their sockets as his mouth drops open. He shifts his weight onto his other foot, struggling to find an appropriate answer
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to disturb you, you just seemed quite distressed which is why I thought you might need some help."
Dean's eyes drop down to Kreschner, who claps him on the shoulder once before turning and meeting Castiel's eyes. Castiel's breath hitches. How does he even know where Castiel is? Has he been watching him the whole time? He walks with his cane and limps over to where Castiel is standing, but Castiel couldn't care less as he watches Dean send him a smile, a sad, broken smile, before slipping into his car.
A sharp hiss rang through the room as Dean sliced a delicate, precise cut under Castiel's collarbone. The cut reddened, before blood trickled down the expanse of Castiel's chest. Dean however, seemed unfazed, as he swiped his fingers through the blood, brought them down to Castiel's back and then—
Right as he's walking out the door, his eyes fall upon a slip of paper, a flyer of sorts, and a fun idea pops up in his mind.
His fingers tugged Castiel's trousers down before he crumpled it up and threw it over to the front seat, all the while licking a stripe of spit down Castiel's chest and stomach.
"Sorry, it's just... I had an argument with my parents this morning. I was tired, it was a hectic shift, I was sleepy, and my mom was being her usual, nagging self."
"Mr. Green, I talk to you every minute I'm free from work. Is that not enough?" Castiel chuckles, and hears Green give an unsatisfied whine.
How had he come to this, he wondered, not for the first time in a long while, for he'd lost count of how many hours he'd been hung up on the ropes. Hours, days, weeks.
Castiel hands the violin back to him, and sits down at the sofa.  "We practiced the first verse on Tuesday, and you know the song is short, the verse is repeated. But what matters is your technique. I want it to be smooth, alright?"
but Dean. It was Dean's name for him. Kept with love and affection. Oh, how it pierced Castiel's ears now.
and Castiel jumps back, eyes wide as he glances at the wall in front of him. "Was that... Was that the wall?"
"With great faith, Orpheus began his journey out of the underworld, joyful that he would once again be reunited with his love. However, as Orpheus was reaching the exit of the Underworld, he could hear the footsteps of his wife behind him. He wanted to turn around and embrace her
"Eight years? Buddy, I was in boot camp when you were in high school learning 'bout cooties or whatever."
"That's certainly very dedicated, Mr.Green. But I believe there's something from your side, a promise, you have yet to fulfil."
: the touch of Castiel's soft palms on the side of his face, his lips, passive at first, then guiding Dean into a more vigorous, fervor-filled kiss, their bodies swaying against each other as if drawn by the wind.
Somehow, the knowledge of Green's forthcoming departure twists a chord inside Castiel's heart. Sure, he's only known the man for three days, and yes, he's never seen him either— he doesn't even know a name— but the mere thought of finding someone who
"Master, oh please, I'm going to come," Castiel gasped, and Dean thought he'd combust with how fucking horny he was. In response, he simply grunted, and continued to fuck into Castiel's wide, pink hole, watching the flesh open up so invitingly for Dean, as his cock slid in and out in measured, long thrusts.
Deep, blue eyes wander over Dean's chest, and all Dean can do is breathe. He brings his hand up to cover Castiel's on his chest as he shakes his head.
Dean, who once was nothing more than a mere interruption in Castiel's life, but has now become a part of Castiel in ways he finds himself unable to explain.
"What can I say?" Garth asked, as he waddled his way up the stairs, "-it never felt like a home to me. Usually, during the war days, the people would use this place as a guest house. Spend the night here before traveling on. It was convenient too. In the West, you've got the county, so there's the buzz of people, plus you've got the stores and the market. On the North, you've got the roads leading out of the county, into the rest of the country, and on the South, a few blocks down from the street, you've got the church—"
But Castiel doesn't sound alright. He sounds indifferent and his eyes don't meet Dean's. The word is hollow, as if he doesn't believe Dean at all, as if he's accepting a truth he
"Well, y'know," The alpha scoffed, assuming a much confident position now as he straightened his shoulders and lifted his chin with a nonchalant shrug.
"Dean, go—" Castiel shakes his head with a defeated grin, and pushes Dean away, their eyes meeting. A glimmer of mischief twinkles within his eyes.
The sound of a content hum drifts across the room, and Dean fiddles with a loose thread on his trousers to compensate for the silence.
He drops a small string of spit over the prince's rim, massaging the saliva into his hole as Castiel cries out softly, his hole twitching and clenching around Dean's cock.
Frantic, scared for his life, Castiel ran towards the door, pounding his fists on the metal door as hard as he could, broken screams bouncing off the metal as he yelled out.
He walks out his bedroom, making a detour through the kitchen to grab himself a mug of coffee, before knocking against the wall in the living room.
Now that seemed to take Castiel aback, and he paused, feet coming to an abrupt halt as he stared ahead at the alpha, his eyes green and inviting, and Castiel felt himself flush under the alpha's insistent gaze.
He rests his chin against the rest, and runs his bow against the strings. The melody at his fingertips is smooth, soft around the edges, his hand controlled over the bow due to his years of experience, as he glides the bow against the—
"W-why would you think I'm moving in a week?" Dean asks, but his voice is weak as if he's been caught doing something wrong.
Dean pressed a thumb to rub the back of Castiel's ear, watching as Castiel recoiled and purred, grinding down on Dean's fingers, a picture of raw sensuality, as Dean grunted to himself and shoved his fingers in deeper so they brushed against Castiel's prostate. The catboy gave a loud, needy whine and arched his back, squeezing Dean's shoulder as he rode Dean's fingers, hips rocking rhythmically as he let out a loud, high-pitched noise, straight out of a pornographic film, and Dean's cock perked with interest.
"I play about six instruments in total. The piano, the violin, the guitar, a bit of flute, and well, different variations of the same instruments. Like ukuleles, cellos, and all."
"I mean," Dean's breath hitches in his throat as he looks up, meeting Castiel's tender eyes, and at once, he feels the weight roll off his shoulder.
"Well, dearie, it's rather simple. I'd say, the simplest cure ever. But for poor, emotionally constipated Dean, I think it would be rather tough."
Castiel doesn't hesitate, simply walks over to stand in front of Dean, who slides his hands around his waist, hyper-aware of the sudden intimacy between them. God, if he doesn't touch Castiel right now, he might combust.
"And you won't even meet me? Why not? I've always tried to be respectful of you, I've always tried so hard to, to respect your space, and I've tried so, so hard to be a good friend. Now that you're leaving, won't you meet me, not even once?"
Dismissing his thoughts, Dean ducks into the refrigerator, grabbing a bottle of beer and uncapping it with the bottle-opener magnet on the fridge, before pressing the rim to his lips and drinking the first sip of the chilled, bitter drink. A soft rustle behind him catches his attention, and he glances back at Sam, who enters the kitchen with slow, hesitant steps. His eyes are narrowed at Dean, and his lips turned up in a confused frown.
It couldn't be Green. After all, Castiel had trusted him. Every time Castiel had wanted to complete a task alone, Green, or perhaps Dean, had trailed him around, protected him, stood up for him in the discussions when anybody suspected Castiel, and Castiel in turn had stood up for Dean. There was no way Dean could have done it. Dean had been with Castiel every moment. How could he possibly have done such a cruel thing? How could he betray Castiel? After everything they shared, after their friendship, after Castiel had trusted Dean with his
Castiel groans, his breathing stuttered and shaky, before he turns his head back and looks into Dean's eyes.
"We're gonna' make all of that pain go away, okay baby? But first, I'm gonna' have to punish you. Dirty little omegas need to be punished, don't they?"
Castiel sighed, and rolled his eyes, slipping his hands into Dean's jacket, and wrapping his cold fingers around the warm coffee paper-cup.
Jack has mastered most of the piece, Castiel wants him to perfect it. He knows Jack is his finest student, fingers working with ease at the strings when he plays, which is why Castiel nagged him about enrolling in a state wide talent hunt, the winners of which are promoted to members of a highly respected and cherished orchestra group, New York City Orchestra.
childish and unbelievably endearing. But Castiel now finds, he seamlessly fits into Castiel's routine, and has become a part of his life in ways Castiel could never have imagined before.
Although confusion sparkles in Hannah's eyes, Dean feels nothing but excitement and anticipation thrumming under his skin at the prospect of seeing Castiel at last. Hannah nods solemnly, and pulls the door open for Dean to enter. He walks in, still in attention, his posture straight and rigid and his gait sharp. Hannah swallows thickly, before mumbling something along the lines of 'good night, your highness', and shows herself out. The door shuts behind Dean with a firm thud, and at last, Dean's eyes wander over to the front of the chambers.
Dean halts for a moment, everything disappearing as if at the click of a finger, and he questions, for the first time in years, if what Blue says is true.
A glance at the clock in his living room shows him the time is half past three, and he turns his attention back to the ash slipping down the drain in his kitchen sink. Stepping away, he walks to his fridge, pulling the door open and leaning down with disinterest. Even before the door opens, he knows the fridge is almost empty. He hasn't had the time to shop for groceries since he moved here a few days ago. But it doesn't bother him as a problem, for Dean recalls surviving on less than nothing in the torrid streets of Kabul. Absently, he grabs a box of leftover Chinese takeout from the night before, and grabs a paper fork for himself before sticking the box in the microwave.
A finger drags down his back and dips into his ass, dragging down the taint before reaching the tight rim around his hole, and it punches a gasp out of him. Castiel leans down lower and meets Dean halfway for a kiss. This time, their lips crush against each other, noses pressing, breaths heaving rapid, and wandering hands drifting over each other's skin.
"Tell me why you didn't come over for Christmas then?" Dean shot back, his eyebrows furrowing together as he locked his jaw, and tightened his arms around Castiel's waist. There was no point in lying.
"Are you still fucking me or have you come to your senses?" Castiel asked, and Dean should have bent him over and spanked his ass bright red for the insolence in his voice, but it could slide this once, especially when Dean grabbed him by the hips and pushed him up onto the countertop.
Something warm unfurls within Castiel's eyes, an overwhelming want, only paralleled to Dean's, who sucks in a deep breath, the air between them so thin, their breaths mingle, the scent of the minty mouth wash Castiel used dancing across Dean's tongue, and Dean feels Castiel's skin dot with goosebumps under his hand on Castiel's waist.
Silence follows Dean’s words, before he hears Blue gasp, quite audibly at that, and then, in the sincerest, most wonder-struck voice Dean has heard, tone filled with childish curiosity, Blue asks, "How do you do that?"
"The face is borrowed. I'm renting it for a while. However," Meg moves closer, as if levitating towards Dean, or perhaps, it is Dean who wanders close to her, although its hard to tell, and he watches as her face disintegrates into nothing— pitch black— before reintegrating into—
"I like talking to you,” Dean says. “Somehow speaking to a stranger is far more therapeutic than it would seem to be."
"I'm sorry, Cas," he hiccups, and before he can speak any further, Castiel's hands frame his face, pulling him up until Dean's face is only an inch from Castiel's. He watches as deep, round blue eyes flicker over his face, from his lips to his eyes, to the lines on his forehead, to the dimple at his mouth.
"Dean," Cas says behind him, but the word is flat, choked out, as if someone is pretending to be Castiel, imitating him— but it isn't Castiel.
There's underlying desperation to the man's voice, one that curls something warm inside Castiel, and he lets his head fall against the wall.  "Maybe tomorrow afternoon? When I wake up?"
Dean asks, expectant and waiting, and Castiel notes he hasn't even touched his own burger— strange considering how big of a foodie Dean is.
"If ya' follow me for a minute, I could show you the bedroom. But please feel free to use any room you'd like. After-all, yer' gonna' be living here for a while. The house's yours."
Sighing, Castiel puts his wallet away, but not before grumbling about it. They slide out of the booth and turn towards the glass door. A few long moments later, they're seated in Dean's car without surprisingly, having spoken in the past few minutes. Of course, the silence isn't as torturous as it had been a few days ago, but it does itch under Castiel's skin.
"I hate you," Castiel sighs, a pout gracing his lips as he folds his arms across his chest, refusing to spare Dean a look, "-I was so scared I was going to fall off, you idiot."
"Dean? I thought you were– wait, what's going on? Why are you guys cuddling?" Sam's eyes go wide, and he seems to have jumped to a conclusion as his face falters, tinging visibly red, as he shuts himself out, and followed after comes his muffled voice from the other side of the door, "-Oh-oh-oh my god, I'm so sorry– I'm, I'm so sorry."
"No, no, dad would never do that. He was strict, yes, and disciplined, Jesus, but he never hit us. Never once. Not my mother, not my brother, not me. He cursed me, sure, hell, he even told me I should've been dead in a blast, and sometimes I think a slap to the face would have been better than the things he said to us, but no, he never hit us. He did, however, find my attraction to men, and I quote, ‘
"Stop that right now or I'm gonna' fuck you so hard into this leather you'll be leaving this car with my pups in your belly."
A few tears slid down Castiel's face, and he wiped them away quietly on the back of his hand as he shut the bedroom door, and turned around the face the empty, palatial manor. It must have been quite a beauty, Castiel mused, back in its time. Although now, it was nothing but stony ruins. And yet, somewhere within these stony ruins, there lay something beautiful— something
When Castiel knows Dean is close, he wraps his fat pink lips around the throbbing, red tip of Dean's cock, and he hollows his mouth around the length, pressing his lips tight, creating a tight, wet heat for Dean to thrust up into. The thrusts start out rhythmic at first, and Dean's bruised knuckles, now covered with fading ointment, thread through Castiel's hair, holding his head in place, as Dean bucks his hips up, moaning and spitting out curses left, right and centre. The thrusts become sporadic after a while, and Castiel's name graces Dean's lip, a prayer, as he comes inside Castiel's mouth, the salty, musky taste of semen flooding Castiel's tongue. The hand in his head falls loose, and with no hesitance whatsoever, Castiel swallows the semen down, arousal thrumming under his skin.
"You forgot the kitten." Green adds, his voice a tad bit higher than a whisper, and Castiel groans with a mighty roll of his eyes, finding himself smiling not a second later as he moves around the house to grab his wallet.
"Alright, play whatever you want. Besides,” Dean admits, “-I've been meaning to watch you play since the moment I knocked on that wall."
Castiel simply raises his eyebrows, unable to answer with the burger in his mouth, and Dean pokes his puffed-up cheeks, to which Castiel simply rolls his eyes. Once he's swallowed the bite down, Castiel imitates Dean's previous actions— wipes his fingers on a napkin, and meets Dean's eyes to regard him with an expectant look.
"Not my fault you're a scaredy-cat," Dean retorted, as expected, and somehow, the tension between them felt easy— as if things had never changed between them.
"Dude," He started, voice as sincere as can be, only furthering Castiel's confusion, "— you say stuff like that, I might fall in love with you."
"Dean, may I..." The prince starts, sending Dean shy glances from under his coy eyelashes, "-may I see you as well...?"
"Fine. Move in with me back in Lawrence. Get another job as a nurse there. Start a new life with me. It ain't easy, baby, it's hard work."
before his nickname. Of course, they’re well past the formalities now; it’s been almost a month since they struck up their peculiar friendship.
—" Castiel sneezed suddenly, ducking his head to the side and burying his face over his shoulder, sniffling and rubbing at his nose on his shoulder, when all at once, there were hands on his back, and something draped over him.
angel so dishevelled, so hurt, so agonised, "-I don't know what's happening," Castiel sniffles, his bottom lip trembling, "- everything hurts, Dean."
The intrusion at Castiel's hole thrust up wildly, and Castiel gave out a loud scream as it pushed up
"That should teach you," Dean chuckled, and his black eyes now peered into Castiel's hooded, dim blue eyes, "—I'm gonna' fuck you with the blade, as hard as I can, then I'm going to come in your hole and choke you until my name is the only thing you can breathe in, is that clear?"
Benny had invited Castiel to a New Year's Eve party, and Castiel had acquiesced to come. Anything to distract him. Twenty-fourth December was the last Castiel had seen of Dean. After he had walked out the door, enraged and seething, Castiel had decided it was best if he distanced himself from Dean. He even made sure to ask Benny, although discreetly, if Dean was coming to the party, and Benny had shook his head, saying Dean had business to attend to. The relief pouring through Castiel's veins at not having to see Dean should not have felt as sweet as it did, but Castiel knew his place now, and he was alright with where he was. His place was in the background of Dean's life, as it always had been. His place was away from Dean. Being away from Dean meant making Dean happy, and for Dean to be happy, Castiel would do anything.
"I don't understand,” Blue asks and Dean allows himself the time to pop a few more peanuts in his mouth. “-Is that supposed to be funny? It sounds quite hurtful." With an indignant hum, Dean continues.
"Where's your car, alpha?" Castiel asked, much to both of their surprises, and at once, he could smell it.
With hesitant hands, he reaches for the light panel on the side of the wall, and by touch alone, drifts his fingers over the different switches, before pressing one. A dim orange, light in the corner of the room begins to glow and drowns the room in a dull, yellow illumination, and at last, Dean can see the contents of the room as they are, but what catches his attention the most is the body on the bed, wrapped up in thick, weighted blankets with its back to Dean.
A rich, thick laughter reaches Dean's ear, and at once, his heart quickens. Must be a blessing for anyone to hear this man's laughter each morning.
‘cause I'd have taken up the case, but all I'm saying is look, it's not like you have anything to do in New York, right? Back in Lawrence you have Bobby's garage, you have people who know you, people you can rely on. And you're a veteran, so double kudos to you. What's the harm in moving in? You have a week or two. And it's closer to California too, Dean."
"Oh god, yes. I think everyone in a radius of ten metres is going to have to wear some heavy-duty ear plugs— unless they want to hear a bunch of kids play the violin as brashly as possible."
"Well, not really. It's only been a day or two. Besides, I hate small talk. Why do I need to go over to some stranger's house to talk to them for absolutely no reason besides compelling them to acknowledge my existence?"
"I guess,” Dean trails off, "All the pining we could have saved if we'd just, gotten our heads out of our asses."
thing, alright? I can't. Tell me, honestly, if you did something like that, could you forget? Could you step into my shoes, look me in the eye, and say ‘
"Well, I'm going to save it. Besides, it's not like you can come in here and take it away from me." Castiel bounces a shoulder to himself, a teasing edge to his voice. He's testing how far Green wants to go with his promise of remaining anonymous.
"My nipples and my hole," Castiel answered softly, bringing one hand up to pinch a nipple, while the other reached down to rub a finger over his soaked rim.
"Look, man, seriously, I don't give a shit about the tuning. I'm just trying to catch a nap for a while. So, please, get it over with."
The sound of his breath filled the dark, pungent room. The odour of sweat and slick mingled together in the air, drenching the room in a whirlwind of pheromones, and in the midst of it all, lay Castiel, rolled over on his stomach, pushing his ass up in the air behind him, legs digging into the soft, damp mattress under him as he thrusted three wet fingers in and out of his soaked, tight hole.
"Good," Blue notes, and then there's shuffling over the line before the call ends. Strange, Dean thinks, how Blue ended their call so abruptly, but a moment later, his doorbell rings. He pauses, allowing Blue time to leave, before walking over to the door and twisting it open. True to Blue’s word, a warm container of rice and curry sits at his door. The moment Dean pops the lid open, the aromatic scent of spices hits him right in his senses and he hums.
Somehow, Dean wants to spoil him. Wants to keep him close, wants to smother him with kisses and drown him in affection.
"I mean, I lay down, you get on top of me, and you know." Dean waves his hand around with a quirk of his lip, and expects Castiel to understand, but he doesn't. Maybe that reaper April was bad at sex, maybe Castiel is simply unable to understand, but be what it may, Dean is going to teach him. Even if it takes him all day, the fruit of his work will be sweeter than any damn pie.
Love. Castiel has never been in love before. It’s never bothered him, not having a lover, but sometimes, when he catches his thoughts wandering, he does imagine a future filled with love. With someone to stay beside him. With someone who chooses to love him, above anything else. With someone who means everything to him, perhaps more than everything. He thinks of cold mornings and warm blankets, and sunny afternoons and lively chatter, of rainy nights and comforting arms.
"Oh, it's just some coffee, and some pie. Dean, my friend, he loves pie. Besides, I thought I'd check out the new bakery."
Castiel whimpered, and hid his face in the depths of Dean's neck, chest heaving with loud pants as Castiel struggled to regain his breath. Dean's hand ran up and down his back, rocking him gently and kissing his forehead as he coaxed Castiel with soft shusshes.
teasing. He has thought about it before, how Castiel has the perfect cock-sucking lips, and hey, he's only human, okay? He's got urges, and sometimes he indulges in fantasies. Harmless little fantasies. With a loud, unexpectedly needy moan, Castiel sucks Dean's cock into his mouth, head bobbing as he hollows out his cheeks, and grabs the base of Dean's cock in one hand, the other hand rolling Dean's balls.
before Dean's thrusts stagger, and then Dean is coming in thick, white stripes, sheathing Castiel's inside with hot, guzzling release.
Dean shakes his head, but puts Sam on speaker and scrolls through his G-mail account, dozens and dozens of unread e-mails filling his phone screen.
"Let me go," Castiel sighed. He didn't turn back, rather, he couldn't. He couldn't face Dean. Perhaps Dean knew that, which is why he walked around, hand still gripping Castiel's wrist, to face Castiel himself. Even then, Castiel kept his head hung, not wanting to meet Dean's eyes, as Dean stood before him, waiting, uncertain, hesitant. A hundred unspoken words buzzed through Castiel's mind, and perhaps if he had drunk a little more of the bitter, diluted beer, he would have been able to say them out loud.
"Because I don't think the marks you've left in my life will ever disappear," Castiel answers, sliding his arms around Dean's neck as he reaches up to pull Dean down into a brief kiss.
It isn't until he's in the kitchen, grabbing a water bottle before slipping into bed, that he hears a knock on the wall
Castiel shoved his tongue into his cheek, biting on his lip to hold back another round of tears as he averted his gaze, keeping it fixed to the floor, while silence crept between them, strange, off-putting, distant.
Castiel's face was coloured with a beautiful scarlet blush, his eyes deep and disoriented, his hair tangled and tousled, his lips swollen from having been biting them, and his neck sweaty and glistening. Damn it, Dean missed out on
"Ah, Saint Castiel? Never heard that either," Dean snorted under his breath, only causing Castiel to chuckle louder, earning himself a sharp glare from the store owner.
"You think," the alpha growled, his breath panting hot against Castiel's throat, his canines sharp and hovering over Castiel's neck, right over the frail, smooth flesh, and Castiel felt himself leak in Dean's lap, staining Dean's skin with his slick, "-you think you can just come in here," Dean panted, "-act all cute and submissive, show my your hole, show me your neck, show me your pink, little nipples, and not leave with a mark on your neck? You brat, you
