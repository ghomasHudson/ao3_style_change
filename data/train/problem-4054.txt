Dean’s shoulders tensed. “You keep the nightmares away. You know that.”
Claire met her eyes. “Yeah, I think we are.”
Castiel raised an unimpressed eyebrow that Dean couldn’t see. “I rebuilt you, Dean.”
“Ye need to talk abou’ it?” Rowena asked softly.
"That's not—"
to.” Sam shuddered.
"Always am."
Castiel smirked at him from the seat to his right.. “Are you not entertained, brother?” he whispered in English.
I always swore to you I'd never fall apart
She smiled at him. "Alright. I'll feel better once I see Sam, I think. I know they said he's doing better but…"
episode?"
"And I wouldn't have to juggle so many social interactions. And the plan wouldn't be so damned complicated."
Dean frowned.
And, as all good things, Patroclus came to an end.
Dean ground his teeth, jaw muscles flexing. His thoughts were getting mixed up, and there was no way to sort them.
There was concerned mumbling in the crowd.
"Can I help you?" Jody asked, eyebrow raised.
“Don’t promise that.”
Patroclus followed me up Mount Pelion when we were young, he in human years and I in angel. He stuck close to my side, jumping into the underbrush to pick a fig or a date, returning with a large smile and sticky hands.
Sam blinked. "You're with Cas?"
"Yeah."
“Sorry I’m late!” Rowena said, ducking down to grab some paint as she went to her spot beside Gabriel. “I was busy plannin’.”
"Also phase two started while you were sleeping."

"Yeah."
“We’ve got a lot on our plate.”
Michael narrowed his eyes. "You're stalling."
“They make me happy. They remind me that not everything is the past. That there’s good in the future, too.”

Maggie laughed softly. "What's even the average lifespan in this line of work? Thirty? Tops?"
Castiel knocked on the door softly, and a tear slipped out, unbidden.

“I’m mad.”
“Congrats! It’s a boy,” Charlie exclaimed, firing up the machine. “You can go play catch later. We’ve got bigger fish to fry right now.”
And though he couldn’t
“Woohooo!” Dean cheered loudly, no doubt waking up everyone else in Jody’s house.
Rowena clicked her tongue. "Let the man eat somethin' healthy for a change. It would do him some good, if ye ask me."
Rowena made a dramatic thinking noise. “Hmm, so, Gabriel, ye, an’ me. All of us. Together.”
He turned in surprise. “What? How?”
There was so much she could say, so much they could talk about. The three younger adults had fallen asleep in Sam's bed, Sam himself in a chair beside them, his red-rimmed eyes keeping watch.
Mary and Bobby exchanged a look. "Why?"
"Yeah. Yeah it is."
Castiel grimaced, hand against another doorknob. "I know."
The pain stopped, and he opened his eyes to a table for two.

Claire hung her head and sighed. "Oh my gosh. We're not sleeping tonight."
"What happens now?" Maggie whispered.

Cas watched in fascination as Dean’s eyes flickered back and forth between black and green, his hands leaving Cas’s shoulders and going to grab the tree above his head.
Finally, he said, "Hey, Wena?"
“I was… wrong. To push you away like that.”
His usual retort died on his lips. "Kinda sorta not really?"
“Unfortunately.”
Castiel smiled through his reddened cheeks. “I feel perhaps I should tell you we can’t…
And Castiel’s hands were holding his, and Castiel’s forehead was pressed against his own, and Castiel was singing to him. For him.
"Maggie can draw again if she wants—"
“Let him go find a life for himself, outside of me. I… I dragged him into this mess when I went to Stanford to find him. Maybe he just… needs an out.”
“To have and to hold…”
"I'm not God, Cas. I won't judge you."
"Everyone. No one. It's very complicated. You've met the god Osiris. Technically, anyone who worships and believes in him is right. But also, anyone who worships and believes in God is right. Or Jesus. Or anyone. At the same time, the only people who were there at Creation are unreliable at best. Perhaps it was a big bang, and then no one is right."
And, oh. Oh, dear God. Dear universe. Dear everything.
"I'll be good."
Gabriel looked to Rowena, who returned with a glance that said she was just as worried as he was.
“You said no?” he repeated, bewildered. “Why?”
There was relief across their faces as Gabriel looked back to them.
"Of course."
to use the bathroom anymore. I think he just…
And wasn't that a strange memory? It played in her head as Sam quietly started on eggs, afraid any noise would break the tentative peace they had formed.
Dean was silent a long time, cheek pressed against the flowing hair on Castiel’s head. “Honestly?”
Gabe shrugged. “If she will not stand with us, perhaps she can still help us by figuring that bit out.”
Dean ran his fingers through Sam’s hair. “Where’s my little brother, huh? That toddler running around and getting into everything his little hands could reach? The one that wouldn’t do anything without me?”
“You’re my—” He cut himself off, seemingly dazed. “You are. My family. I just— Mom?”
"Not biologically. We adopted my brother Lucifer's son. His name is Jack."
As long as someone'll bleed"
Sam sniffed and looked up to see Claire's blurry face.
"I'm fine. You figure out what all's different?"
Castiel pressed his hands to his head, feeling like he was being forced out of his own vessel.
When He said, 'John, go do my will!'"
Claire stared down at the box, frowning. “How will we know when it’s here?”
Sam sighed. "Believe me or not. It doesn't matter yet. We know this will work now. Or at least, this part will." Sam looked back over his shoulder as if listening to someone before glancing back at Dean. "I've got to go, Dean."

"Somewhere ya can't get it." Donna smiled down at her mug, thinking. "Maggie doesn't like big things, does she? We could do a picnic."
against these tactics! War crimes! War crimes, I say!”
"You askin' me to marry you, Claire Novak?" Maggie whispered.
Claire looked up from where she was reading in the library. "Er, hi."
"Please?"
Castiel looked around at everyone, and he was the only confused face among them. “I don’t—”
Rowena's lips twitched down minutely.
"No, that can't be right." Maggie pushed her hair back wildly. "I still remember what Hell is!"
“I sure hope so. Look, Sam and I are at the coffee shop. I’m in the bathroom right now, but I don’t know how long I can keep him here. I’m gonna try to convince him to go to some flea markets with me.”
And then there was Blue.
"Excuse you?"
last night?!"
“I am afraid so. You married a criminal. These are my criminal ways.”
Gabriel rolled up his pant legs and stepped into the mud with Maggie, copying her movements.
He looked over at Michael, awe still in his eyes.
"Death."

Claire asked like she wanted to hear him admit it.

And then a sleek, golden wing placed itself between Castiel and the others.
anyone. Well, no, that’s not true. I dated Patroclus but that’s another story.”
Gabriel looked down at the object in his hand. “What is this?” he asked in horror, though he truly already knew.
“Yeah. He tried to pretend to be you.”
Gabriel held him close, rocking him gently, because things still weren’t okay, and because maybe they’d never be okay, and because this was his brother’s child. His brother, the one he raised, the one he loved. Castiel had loved this child more than life itself, and Gabriel knew the feeling.
“I suppose we had a few. Just as Sam and I had some.” Castiel glanced at Dean. “Though it might be against the social code for me to explain
“Olympus?”
"Aye. Seems Moose has lost his kingdom."
Michael tilted Dean's head up with his foot, grinning at him. "How are you so sure?"
He stopped.
“It’s all the kale.”
Castiel looked down at their hands, and then back up to Dean’s face. “You…?”
No, when I was created, God and Amara stood side by side against the nothingness, hand in hand. They loved each other, often speaking in ways my mind was not made to comprehend. Their tongues would weave worlds in a breath, and blow them away in another. There were many trials until Earth was formed, as you know it. It took both no time at all and forever.
It hurt the soles of my feet. It burned in its gentleness. For I knew why I was there, and the forgiveness of the land itself began to tear apart my resolve.
Sam thought it over, staring at the back of the computer. “So I have to go to their past. To keep it all straight. And
The next day was cold, so Sam thought James might like a small sweater. He went to the old lady that lived down the lane and asked if she had such a sweater. Lucky for him, she did! While he was there, she taught him how to knit. He ran along to the tree and helped James put the sweater on before showing him all he had learned that day.
“Yes.”
“Dean!” Castiel warned.

“Hey,” Dean said. “What’s up?”
He shifted beside her, and she felt the dream shift to another memory, a new one. Her head was laid on his arm, and it was cold outside.
Sam shook his head enthusiastically. "No, no no. Bad choice. Very bad."
Wanna be found"
and we will fight for one another
let him relapse.”
"Ice cream and old cartoons."
"He's doing his best," Dean told her, mind refusing to stay quiet.
“Huh. Did you ever date an angel?”
The rain poured.
Sam pulled out a chair for him, which he took. “Haven’t seen you around in a few days,” Sam remarked.
“No.”
He shook his head. "A week, max. The portal should be good to go by next Wednesday."
Give me something new, scrub."
"Come in!" Jack yelled from his perch on his bed, overheating laptop before him. "I went ahead and started the next season of Adventure Time without you. Sorry not sorry."
Gabriel let out a deep breath, looking to Rowena. “It’s just that…” he turned back to Sam, “Rowena and I… we’re gonna live for a really, really long time. And you’re still human, and we haven’t talked about that yet.”
I may have failed, but I have loved you from the start
“Yes, but it is not absolute. Things can change.”
"Umm, I have a spell book here somewhere. We're gonna need Charlie, too. Mostly because she'd kill us if we made one without her."
"Alastair?" the voice asked, incredulous, horrified.
Cas opened his mouth to respond, but Dean plowed right on through.
“Once,” Castiel responded. “Long ago. We used to sing praises of God.”
Michael put an encouraging hand on his shoulder. “Haeliel is correct. All past transgressions have been forgiven, but this does not hold for future ones. There will be a fair system of trials, and a fair punishment.” He turned to Naomi. “Do you understand?”
Claire hid her blush, coughing awkwardly. “Hey, enough of that sappy shit. It’s almost time.”

"If this fire goes out, I will keep you warm
Dean would always pick me up after school and we’d walk back to wherever we were staying. It was usually just him, but after a while his friend Mark would come along too.
"Last I checked."
"Of course."
Dean turned to Cas, head resting on his bent arm. "Nothing, actually," Dean said, surprising even himself.
"I miss him," Dean whispered.
Maggie hid her giggle as Jody rolled her eyes. "Sure, sure. Did you two write your own vows?"
"What are you—"
"Where did the time go? That's how old Claire is, too."
I don't want it to.
Oh, oh, you can dream about it every now and then
"You call him that, yes. Christ isn't really a name though, per se. It means 'anointed one'. And he prefers Josh nowadays."
Dean regarded Sam suspiciously.
"You deserve better," Dean whispered, head pressed against Sam's, eyes misty.
Michael threw him off, grabbing the knife and lunging.
Rowena chuckled softly. "Aye, that's what happened. Well, why don't ye go first, and I'll follow?"
Donna's hand was firm in Jody's.
"That's my half-brother's name! But he's in Hell now."
Maggie shrugged. “Maggie, probably.”
"Ooh baby
When Rowena knocked on the door, it was Jody who answered.
"Even me beatin' ya at Mousetrap?"
waste of my time."
Cas’s voice was quiet as he said, “I suppose it is.”
He chose you over Dean then. So why not now?”
Maggie settled herself beside Claire. “Yeah, gosh. It’s been so long, I can’t even imagine living without Sam or Charlie or Jack. Even Gabe and Rowena have become staples.”
She huffed, glaring at the pan as if it would just flip one itself.
"They… they do?"
“Ephphatha,” Gabriel whispered, and then he touched Sam’s ears.
"Yes."
Michael looked at him frantically, breathing hard. “Look at what I’ve done! Look around you! I’ve damned you! I’ve damned us
Jack didn’t even see him move.
"You can't use this against me."
“The only one who understood you? Who understood truly what you
“Does fate exist?”
"I'm not— I don't understand," the voice said, something like hope tinging it.
He shrugged. "I could sense mischievousness," he said as way of explanation.
Dean hissed, falling to one knee. “You think he
"No…"
“Michael told me we’ve been down here three thousand years, and I believe him. So I… I wanna know how long ago I forgot you.”
"Gabriel?"
“Dean,” Castiel said, arm reaching out for him.
"Then we'll do a mix of stuff. Then everyone can have something to eat."
Claire fidgeted, suddenly unsure, and Jack grabbed her hand. “Yeah,” he told Sam. “Do you… like it?”
"What was that?" Claire whispered.
Dean wondered how many pounds of pressure it would take to flatten himself, how deep he would have to bury himself to know he would never arise and have to face that sentence again. “So then… that’s it.”
He walked on as Castiel’s shoes stopped.
Jack held his hand out dutifully as Charlie carefully painted his nails a deep purple.
Dean held him tighter. “If I go down, you’re going down with me!”
And it
“Aw, c’mon!” Dean said, grinning. “What’s the point in having a husband if he won’t band up with you against your little brother?”
Jack tilted his head to the side, looking so much like Cas it hurt. “But what happened?”
When was the last time he had
I just want a slow dance with you
"You lost three dads."
When this love is over?
And suddenly there was anger in Castiel's heart, a clench in his jaw. "I want to talk about you, Dean, and what exactly you think you've been doing."
Cas laughed softly, hand tracing soft patterns on the inside of Dean's elbow. "Jesus is why I like bees."
"Maggie's birthday is next week," Jody said instead.
"With boundaries of imagination."
Michael smirked and leaned in close. "I can tell you how long you've been down here," he whispered.
Sam nodded again.
“We are
It wasn't a bated sort of quiet, the kind of quiet that was waiting for something terrible to happen.
Maggie shot her an unamused glare.
Dean did not believe in fate, but he was very much tempted to.
Castiel hesitated, before sighing and releasing him. "I don't want to upset you, Dean. We are not enemies."
"He stole your memories."

“Hope it has two bathrooms.” Sam rolled his eyes, taking another swig. “Sharing with Rowena and Gabriel is the
“Claire I’ve seen you take down a monster. You can flip a pancake. Just, go easy on yourself.”
I chose
"You can?"
Cas didn't say anything.
"And it's okay if you're mad, too. Or confused. Or even relieved. They're all valid.
Jody shrugged. “I don’t think it’s fair to say yes. My entire town was hit by a…
“Yes,” she spit back.
The corners of Castiel’s many mouths twitched. “Tell my brother I said hello.”
"Do you miss me?"
Claire ran back down the aisle with a laughing Maggie still in her arms, back to the Bunker for more cake and booze and partying. Jody and Donna desperately tried to keep up, but they were young and in love, and nothing could stop them.
Dean stepped out of the bathroom, towel-drying his hair. “Hey, Cas. You find a movie?”
Something's just about to break
"Charlie!" the barkeeper yelled out. "The usual?"
And Castiel saw the road diverge before him. "I— I don't know."
"Of course I am, man! How thick-headed do you think I am?"
She stopped.
Jack followed her out into the hall. “Why is the floor always so cold in here?”
Jack dropped down, breathing hard. Gabriel didn’t say a word.
Jack winced. "We're sorr—"
I named at least ten thousand 'Gabriel' and another five 'Castiel' before he told me I had to be more unique.
“Hey, that could work!” Claire frowned. “I uh, I do suck at art, though.”
“And now?”
There was a record player and some records, and Jody grabbed the first one she saw. There was the familiar crackling before the music began, slow and warbling.
"Does that make me evil?"
Cas gently ran his fingers through Dean’s hair, brushing the tangles out tenderly. “Please?” Cas asked.

“Why are there still fish? If they evolved, why didn’t they
"You'll what? Trap me? That worked out so well last time. Please, do try again. It would be entertaining."
“That’s… awful. What are we gonna do when he gets back? He won’t know us.”
"One of the best albums of all time."
“Like taxes.”
"What?"
Castiel wiped them away gently. “Do not be sad. I imagine we are not here for long. Please, tell me about your life. It’s been — well, I suppose almost three years for you.”
And it won't leave me alone
Sam stared down at the pile he had made. “I know.”
we can go on with the plan.”
Castiel forced his own arms down, eyes wide as he stared at the soft face across from him. "I apologize. I uh... I had a nightmare, I think."
Dean snorted. "Hey, Cas."
I told him goodbye, held my hands against the mist of his face one last time, and returned to Heaven.
Donna smiled wide at Sam. “We found Dean and Castiel!”
And Sam’s arms were stronger than he remembered when he hugged back. “I missed you, too.”
"Uh, Cas. Also obviously. You know, you're not giving me many reasons to be scared of you."
So she knew it was a dream, and that didn't change anything at all.
"No." Sam let out a sigh. "He didn't tell anyone. Mom called saying he was acting strange and by the time I got there…" Sam trailed off. "I guess Cas figured it out."
“Happy birthday, Sam!” Claire said, gesturing behind the crowd.
Castiel mashed his forehead against Dean's, eyes squeezed shut. He didn't say a word.
Jody shrugged and led the way, grabbing a coffee mug off a table as she passed. "Do you know what happened?" Jody asked, taking turn after turn.
"Don't worry about it," Dean grinned up at him, pulling his knife out and beginning to carve.
A half-formed face cracked open a malformed eye, to stare into faces holier than Heaven could ever hope to be.
Dean pulled back in a useless attempt to look into his eyes. "And this is what you want? Not what you feel you have to do?"
Dean collapsed on top of Michael, pressing him down. “Does that
Charlie skidded to a stop beside Sam, wasting no time in screaming out, “GABRIEL!”
Dean breathed out a laugh. "That bad, huh?"
"Yeah?"
"Sam?" he called out to the empty space.
“Icing.”
“Do you want kids?”
Maggie watched Claire cycle through some shows and movies. "I haven't even heard of half of these."
Cas gave him a soft smile. "Well, don't let me ruin the first quiet moment you've had in years."
Sam examined Dean, with his wet hair and torn clothes. “I didn’t know that.”
"— my closest friend."
"Hey, Jack. You after the bird?"
Blackbird on my shoulder
Dean’s fist collided with Michael’s nose, eyes blazing in fury. “Take. Me. Back.”
of you can hear me now?”
"Yes! But. But." Claire pointed at him. "She's on a midday Sam jog right now. And this is a Sibling Dream Team thing today. We make the plan, then
Sam half-laughed in confusion. “You… I’m sorry, I don’t understand.”
The arm still thrown over Dean's eyes ended in a thumbs-up.
Jack grinned at them, removing his wing. "Don't come crying to me when you get sunburnt then."
"How long have we been here?"
“But Castiel is wonderful,” Dean pulled back, wiping his eyes off on his sleeve.
"Cool. Cool cool cool." She rubbed her hands across her jeans, antiseptic and soap coming off. "Good luck with the computers then."
"Hey Cas?"
At first, there was nothing.
Dean looked around again at each one before furrowing his eyebrows and looking at Gabriel pointedly.
He ordered two drinks and walked one to Castiel, ice audibly chattering as his hands shook like every bit of electricity that had ever been between them was raining down from the heavens onto him: the half-finished lightning rod. His edges were melting when he managed to clatter one glass down onto the stained wood.
"What did he say?" Jack whispered.
"Are you… Are you taking this seriously? At all? Do you understand that I could kill you?"
die then. He’ll see you kiss me and that’ll be that. He’ll just drop dead.”
"I'll see you soon, okay?"
“Hectic?” she offered.
Dean could not see in the darkness, and he was tired enough that his emotions played across his face. Cas wondered if he knew how he looked, eyes almost closed, eyelashes fluttering, lips parted, cheeks flushed. A thumb pressed at the corner of Castiel's mouth, and he took a shuddering breath.
I'm not sure how long we would stay out there. Long enough that I was stronger on the return flights, strong enough eventually to take the meandering routes home. We would swing by stars and float through those just beginning to form.
"Everyone is back, huh?"
“I’m ready.”
Sam began unpacking the bags. "Any reason why not?"
(See the end of the chapter for
And Cas could feel the tremors in Dean’s arms, hear the harsh rise and fall of his chest.
“WHY?!” Dean demanded. “HE’S COMING FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU’RE HIS
And I'm thinking of August, too. About the dying leaves, falling to the ground. They've only just turned in August. And we don't try to staple them back onto the branches. We don't mourn them. We let them go, because that's just life. Things die. Things leave us. It's just how it is.
“Deal.”
“You know how I know?” Dean continued, grabbing Michael’s wrists and wrestling the book away. “Because you’re

'Because I didn't want you to go through this alone.'
Sam shook his head silently. He didn't say a word.
But the idea of… the mere
And try as Charlie might, she could not tear Sam away from where he held Jack tightly, paper-thin red lines growing into gouges across his body. Wings stuttered against Sam, and he merely held on tighter.
“Do you know how to swim?”
She wanted to just keep living in the altered memory, to talk about taking forms and driving people mad, about Jimmy and Castiel. To repeat the past and maybe just stay in it, stuck in this loop forever.
Jody frowned. "I don't really know. Everything was fine. We were all in the kitchen, Charlie had made some joke, and everyone was laughing. I mean, even Sam was smiling, and Lord knows he doesn't do
Michael pushed Dean against the wall harshly, grabbing the collar of his shirt. “You trapped us all down here with your idiocy! You’ve stopped entire apocalypses! I
If Dean squinted, he could see every facet of Castiel, stretching up into the sky, thousands of faces and yet all focused on this one, small butterfly.
"Mmhm," came the muffled reply.
Maggie and Jack were silent, staring at the flowers as if they could see the molecules in them.
I think Sam actually made a goal or two in the few games we got to stick around for.
Dean reached out, eyes wide and heart hurting for some reason he couldn't remember. "Wait—"
mostly of sorrow so profound it presented itself in ancient dialects, syllables that rounded the walls and cowered in cracks; inflections that caused the very air to tremble. His mouth split at the seams as his eyes burned gold.
“How can you
"I understand."
The ocean shushed him softly, and he just kept screaming, face red and sand sticking to his tears. "I slept in your stupid fucking bed, because it smelled like
what?"
No answer.
Sam grimaced and took a big gulp of chocolate. "I hated him for a long time. But… I got older, and it was so long ago that I just… I stopped caring at all. He was driven, and brave, and single-minded. But none of those are good things if your kids aren't among your interests. There's a reason Dean raised me, and it's that our real dad never did."
Night fell, and Sam left to go home.
“We’re playing Winchester baseball!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I won’t leave this time,” Cas promised, pulling Dean to his feet.
"Hey, Mary!" he called out, climbing up the pool ladder to show her his screen. "Check out your son!"
Cas moved his hand slowly against Dean’s face, into Dean’s hair. “And you saw through that?”
Charlie shrugged her backpack back on. "Your choice, but hiking in a dress sounds like hell. I'd decide quick, too, because Sam and the sheriffs aren't too far behind."
Let August be August, Sam. Take a breath, feel it in your lungs, then let it go.
And if Maggie didn't know any better, she would have thought both Jack and Claire needed immediate medical attention, because both were laughing so hard that only squeaks were coming out. Jack fell back gracelessly on his ass, finally sucking in air and laughing loud enough to disturb some birds.
She focused her attention on the books. “Hm.”
Jack elbowed her, grinning. “Look at Maggie’s! Hers isn’t anything in particular. It’s just pretty swirls and colors.”
Happy Halloween!
Dean hid his laugh. “One, but I guess you can borrow it.”
He laughed, and it was breathy and glorious as tears fled his eyes. “Castiel,” he whispered, hands going out to touch his face.
“I’m just a bit pissed is all. We’ve got bigger problems.” Jack watched the ball hit a tree and explode. It should have been satisfying, but it just made him angrier.
Had Dean been witness to all of this, he would have smiled and asked Sam where the sudden bonding time had come from, but the answer would have been simple:
Dean Winchester. It will do nothing more than drive you to insanity if you attempt to keep time." How funny, how wonderful a word that
"Sam'll be glad to hear that."
I should have been terrified. There was nothing beneath me to capture me, only the endless swirling vortex of creation. But I loved it. I would shriek with laughter, and Gabriel would swoop down to catch me.
“I think having you in my life increases the volume of it,” Dean told him seriously.
Maggie turned in the flea market to see Sam holding up a very old, very scary doll.
Gabriel was off somewhere with Maggie, teaching her about homunculi and showing her how to form them.
This wasn’t his room.
"One rumble for yes, two for no."
“Yeah we… busted him out of the — you know.”
“Hmm,” Cas hummed thoughtfully, pretending to think. “Half an apartment, most of a heart. What about your life? Is there space for me in that?”
"I'm a slut for queerbaiting," Claire deadpanned.
"Sam. The general attractiveness of vampires has increased tenfold."
"I was actually just talking to Jack."
Claire shivered slightly, the cold air having dried their sweat almost too fast. She held the coffee to her face, just like Cas used to, and Sam jerked his head away.
"What?"
Castiel smiled softly, and Dean hung his head low and stifled his coughs.
Soothes the soul and calms the pain
Dean frowned, eyebrows furrowing. "What about?"
or at least it’s not behaving that way. Sometimes I visit you and we’ve already talked six times. Sometimes, like today, I think, we’ve only talked once.” He glanced up. “Is that right? This is my second visit?”
“Cupcake phase!”
“I don’t
Sam was really happy, because he thought he had lost his beloved pet. He climbed into the tree and spent the day with James, chatting with him and telling him all about his friends.
I’ll spare you all the apologies. There’s nothing I can say to make this any better. I know that. But I still wanna apologize for one thing: this letter. I have no right to write this to you, but I am. I have to. I have to know you understand all these things I only recently came to terms with.
crying in my arms, Dean. People who did nothing wrong. And I took them to Heaven but that doesn’t make it
Maggie giggled. “Ah, no, no. Nothing fancy. It doesn’t suit us. We’re just gonna wear our normal clothes.” She smiled fondly at the thought. “It’s about the event, not the way we’re all dressed.”
“Why don’t you just ask me, then? I promise I won’t judge.”
Castiel rested his head on Dean's shoulder, examining their new position.
That Rainbow Connection
“Sure, but they never stop to think about it.” Rowena huffed through her nose. “Christ, it’s too early for anythin’ poetic. Sam, the difference between ye and bad people is that bad people never wake up wonderin’ if they’re bad people.”
"Maggie!" Sam whispered. "C'mon, we can get one more!"
“If I had a glass, I’d toast to our girlfriends.”
Sam nodded. “I know. No more lies, okay?”
"Of course I do. We've known each other for over a decade. Sam was my best friend."
was I always there?!” Castiel placed many heads in many hands, wings turning sharp and razor-like. “I don’t understand! He should remember Lisa! He should remember being a demon! Those weren’t me! I wasn’t

And there was so much Sam wanted to say still, but he couldn’t. “I love you, Cas,” he finally said.
Rowena whispered to Jack, "Thank ye for takin' care of him."
How could you not know?"
"I have to apologize."
"Dean!" he could vaguely hear Castiel saying, hands on his back.
Gabriel glanced back at her, pulling his single earbud out. “Oh, nice horse, Claire!”
Dean rolled his eyes and huffed, pulling out a chair and sitting in it backwards. “What do you want, Michael?”
“I meant whatever question you’re trying not to ask.”
"And Sam didn't feel so lonely," Dean whispered, "because he knew he had family waiting for him. And James didn't worry, either, because he knew Sam was in good hands. And though they never saw each other again—" Dean's voice hitched and he cleared his throat, "they always, always remembered each other. The end."
"Thanks." She patted the ground beside her, beckoning to him. "I figured we could use some new flowers for the ceremony."
“Dammit,” Dean whispered, feeling horns solid and yet intangible again in his hands. “Fuck, Cas, kiss me again.”
The ingredient pantry regarded him silently.
“I know.”
Charlie jumped down on the other side of the rock, and Rowena cursed under her breath before quickly changing into the clothes, stuffing her dress in her large purse.
"Sammy," Dean whispered. "It ain't about you, okay? I'm happy, and I want you to be happy, too."
"You want to know why you know me, Dean?!" Castiel yelled, pushing Dean back against the wall. "You want to know why you
It's been a long day without you, my friend
“See ya around, Sammy.”
"God left us," Jack supplied.
"See ya later, Matt," Charlie threw over her shoulder before stepping inside.
The sound was coming from all around him. It wasn't clear, though. It sounded like it was coming through an old walkie talkie, or like someone was playing an old home movie outside the coffin.
"What, no fighting? No excuses?"
in you. He saw
"I… We've only talked once, Dean."
Not really, of course. God forbid someone truly ever die in Hell. But there was water coursing in and out of his lungs, and there was a silent presence beside him that refused to be ignored.
A year passed, and I hadn’t heard a word.
The question came so out-of-nowhere that Maggie froze. “I um… No. No, I don’t. I’ve seen too much to… do that to a kid.”
he thought.
Dean rolled his eyes. "I guess."
"Sam."
Sam closed his eyes a moment. “Hey, Cas?”
Sam grinned at her. “How do I look?”
His nose broke against Michael’s collarbone, and Dean laughed, low at first, steadily building.
, Cas. It’s just… kinda cute.”
“Sam,” she said softly, kneeling in the sand beside him. “If this doesn’t work, I want ya to know we’re all here for ya. And that ya did your best.”
"Ha! Bishop to E4! Your queen is mine and you can
She looked up at him, eyebrow raised. “How did I know if I was lesbian?”
anymore!"
"Ah, what a brave fellow, this Icarus," Maggie told Claire, gesturing as if she were on a stage. "He would melt his own wings if only his two friends did not pinken in the sun."
"Sam?" he tried, baffled.
Somewhere, far off, a bunting sang.
"Wait," he heard just as the door was almost closed.
He looked around the den, at everyone doing their own things. Claire had her face smushed into Maggie’s shoulder. Maggie was smiling in her sleep. Gabriel was— painting, it looked like, in a little notebook. Jack made a note to ask him about that later. Sam was researching on his computer and Rowena was doing the same in a book. Sam’s hand was playing with Rowena’s gently, with no real motive in mind. Charlie was playing some game on something handheld, earbuds plugged into her phone. She was smiling.
Sam looked at Dean, leaned against a chain-link fence outside a school.
"Maggie Elizabeth Evans," Claire mumbled against her lips, "you wanna just go to the courthouse tomorrow and get married?"
Maggie slid into the passenger seat beside her.
Sam rolled his eyes, matching Dean’s pace perfectly. “Dad won’t be home until, like, two in the morning. You know that. We’re gonna have fun.”
“Uhhhhhhhh,” Gabriel said, eyes wide.
Dean smiled at him tearfully. "Yeah. Just thinking."
“It will be a garden scene, an’ every plant will have a special meanin’.”
Cas looked at Dean, worry quickly etching his face. "Are you okay? You're crying."
Sam’s eyes widened. “Wait, wha—”
"And the questions keep coming."
Sam laughed softly, still overcome. “Yeah, I can.”
And what could Castiel do but oblige?
"I… yes. She is."
"And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon
“At Castiel.”
Your other brother
“I am! We’ve been friends for a long time, and it just… became the next logical step.”
Where I'm bound
"Yes. It's my favorite, as you may recall."
Maggie turned her head to see Charlie staring determinedly at the door.
"Not quite." The toddler grinned at him, dark and maniacal, and it twisted grotesquely into Michael. "Welcome to the Twilight Zone."
"Eventually." He picked up a stick and absently traced sigils in the dirt. "I figured we would let things settle first."
"Don't need to. Your breathing is too regular. Sam used to try and pull the same shit." Dean gently kicked at Cas's shin. "Why don't I tell you a bedtime story?"
From some old movie going back in time, you and me
"Slow dance with you
Dean latched onto his brother, face shoved into his neck, sobbing.
phase two, exactly? I mean, I know what Sam said but… Charlie said there was more to it."
"That just makes you human, Dean. It's nothing to be ashamed of."
“The side quests are so pretty!”
Castiel looked to Jody expectantly, but she closed her book and gestured to Dean.
"It's 8-4-7, today."
"Get the
“I promise you. We are safe.”
It was not darkness. It was merely nothing at all. God and Amara were but warmth in the universe’s bosom, thoughts not yet thrown to the wind to germinate. Beings were forming at arm’s length, babies born into the cosmos. Powerful rulers and terrifying villains.
Maggie was on the screen. Mary remembered her well, how brave and cunning. She was biting her lip and grinning, and in the background, was—
Dean knelt before her, trying to catch her eye. “I didn’t want to. It was the only way I could keep you safe.”
“I’m the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.”
Michael smirked down at him. "Why are you weeping, Dean?"
Castiel felt his chest tighten and held out a hand, resting it softly on Dean's cheek. "That's because you should never have had to be a demon."
holding Mark’s hand above the table and I was just thinking that Dean was only ever cuddly when he slept.
Gabe scooted over until they were pressed side to side. “Whatcha got planned, babycakes?”
Sam sighed and opened the door for him. "I know. I'm sorry. But no one else can be in there. It's just Jack. He's the only one who can do what is necessary."
“That is past,” Castiel informed him gently.
"'M awake," Jack mumbled, pushing himself up with a lot of effort.
She was kissing his face, his cheeks, spouting words Sam couldn't catch, crying.
Castiel paused for a bit, rubbing slow circles on Dean’s hand. “I think the best way to describe it would be a river, for humans. It pulls you one direction and you follow it, unless something stops you. It is affected by the physical realm, as well.
Sam made some noise of acknowledgement, beginning to fall back asleep.
Everyone stopped cold as Gabriel, the Prodigal Son, glared them down.
Dean was tumbling out of his chair, falling to his knees, and Sam followed, hands firm. There was splitting pain and a rush of information and Dean's eyes were rolling back and his lungs were screaming for air and—
"You did," Gabriel assured him. "You believed it with everything in you."
Sam stared at him with big eyes, mouth open. “Dada,” Sam finally announced.
“Same as the last fourteen times ye’ve asked.”
Sam narrowed his eyes. “Gabriel.”
“How can you brush me aside so easily?”
Charlie and Donna were in the lab, pinpointing the exact location they needed.
That’s not all.”
“Claire and I are gonna have a wedding. Three days after this is all done.”
you tell me this now! After I have spent a year away from you! After I have lain awake more nights than I have slept thinking about the way your lips curl when you smile! Thinking that you let me walk because you
Dean nodded. “Good. Good.” He let out a shaky breath. “This feels too normal. Like we’re avoiding everything.”
"Sam!" Maggie admonished, grinning. "You're going to get us kicked out of here."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean made some noise in the back of his throat as his legs bent, thighs framing Castiel. "Fine, fine. I was— I was wrong. Jackass."
“I don’t know,” Dean confessed. “Why would I do that?” He grabbed at his own hair, loosing Castiel’s hand. “Why wouldn’t I be excited that you saw Sam? Why did I know that wasn’t you? I tried to kiss him,” Dean babbled, eyes wild. “I kissed him and I knew it wasn’t you. How?”
She didn't correct Claire's style. Claire would get hit, take a mental note, and adjust herself. They fought in silence, sweating until both shed their shirts, uncaring and unforgiving.
"Don't just fight me," Charlie mumbled, twitching the soaked stray hair out of her eyes. "Fight your demons."
There was a long pause. “I know every scar on your body,” Cas whispered. “I rebuilt you.”
“May I ask how? Michael is a rather formidable foe.”
them!”
Dean was silent a while. "What if I let you hold me for ten seconds?" he said quietly.
Michael grinned openly at him, crunching a few remaining shell fragments under his heel. "Dean?"
"Drilpa?" Jack tried, anxious.
“How many visits does it take me to trust you?”
Castiel's mouth followed his, ached to fully kiss him. "Tell me this is a terrible choice," he whispered.
(Dunno why I said that. You won't stop reading. Never could quite get ya to.)
Cas pulled back to stare into Dean's eyes. "Dean," he said in all seriousness, "that's not statistically possible."
“You’re hiding something from me.”
Ya know, I always knew that kid had a future. I think I told him congrats when he got accepted to Stanford. I helped him pack his bag, too, I think. I'm not sure. That whole day was a blur. I remember feeling numb, really. And he and Dad fought, and Sam left, and the next thing I remember I was crying in the bathroom.
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
(See the end of the chapter for
“WOOHOOO!” Claire echoed, flipping the pancake again and again.
"Castiel," Sam said, suddenly understanding.
“If we don’t hear from you every week, we
Sam kissed his forehead. “Hey, short stack.”
“All of them. Which you would know if you had spent more time listening to me and less time staring at my lips.”
Sam sat the bacon down immediately and tried to stand in the way of the projector. “Okay, nothing to see here!” A baby him smiled on his shirt. “Where did you even
That first lungful of water wasn’t necessarily pleasant, either.

And you chose me too, you
“We’re married.” Dean avoided Sam’s eyes. “I don’t remember everything. But I know him in my soul. I should’ve told you a long time ago that I—”
“I noticed.” Something here felt off. Something felt wrong. “Are you okay?”
"I'd like to hold on," Cas found himself saying.
Dean lifted his head and squinted at Sam. “You’re ah… You’re really good at being Sam.”
Maggie looked at Claire again, something different in the air. “So we’re at that point, huh? Where we talk about stuff like this?”
I — gosh, I asked them if we could
Castiel leaned his head back, as if he could see through the solid casket surrounding them. “I assume we are near the bottom.”
“You’re not a bad kid, you know that?”
Dean pressed his forehead just under Castiel’s shoulder, on the top of his chest. “I’m only allowed to ask how long we’ve been down here once, right?”
"Well, look down yonder, Gabriel
“I don’t—”
"Mmm."
Daddy said the river would always lead me home
Dean searched for his eyes, couldn’t find them couldn’t
"My name is Castiel, and I am an—"
"Do what?"
“Wash up before you touch this,” he told her, hitting the answer button.
"Yeah, see? Not so hard."
“Until death do us apart.”
The toddler ran into the room, smiling wide. "Bean!"
“It is going to be quite a mess down there for a while,” Michael said, walking into his room.
turn me in to the IRS.”
"Maybe a little."
"C'mon, man, take it easy on me! I'm no good at this mental chess thing."
“You know her well.”
"How do you think everyone else is judged?"
“Of course. You know they would’ve been down here.”
Dean mouthed, 'Oh' before nodding and resuming his previous position.
River of unhappiness
Cas rolled his eyes. "More like the most intense high of anyone's existence."
“Decorating,” Castiel responded just as quietly.
Jack perked up at that, looking brightly at Rowena. "Pancakes?"
“Yeah?”
The foot soldier nodded his head in acceptance of this. “I merely did not wish to lie,” he said. “I am worried. I am willing to see what happens, though. I sincerely wish you do prove me wrong.”
Sam held his arms out at full length. “Give me your face.”
More silence.
“You shouldn’t have stowed away, buddy,” Dean whispered, knowing it was too late, unable to stop the smile on his face.
Dean's hands were shaking as well.

” Sam continued, “that means there’s
Michael held onto Dean’s wrists, not in fury, but rather seeking safety. “He loves me,” Michael repeated desperately.
Jody smiled at them both. "Dearly beloveds, we are gathered here—"
"Ah, yes. Let me just— go outside and grab one. From the bottom of the ocean. Of course."
“Yeah?” Gabriel responded, examining the contents.
Dean's cheeks turned slightly pink. "There, yeah. Way better. But it's also about the delivery. If you just state it like a fact it ain't as powerful."
The weight
"For something that happened so long ago?"
“Cake!” Jack yelled, running towards the kitchen.
"Sam," she breathed. "What happened?"
life? What did you do while I was gone?"
“Hey, idiots!” Claire yelled at them, grinning. “C’mon!”
“Ready.”
Cas went to tap Dean's head lightly before stopping himself. "You have an archangel trapped inside you. You are in here to spare the world his wrath."
There was a moment, and then Castiel was
Castiel felt free, wings wide and untethered. They stood outside the Bunker, staring up through the atmosphere, invisible.
Michael stepped to Raphael, laying a hand on her shoulder. “Then we shall dismiss for now. What is the verdict of this meeting?”
"I'm not gonna get high off a picture of a fucking
Charlie’s hand slipped, and there was purple on Jack’s fingers. “What? Why would you think that?”
“That means in this, too. Believe me, I know what you’re going through.” Dean gave him a sad smile. “I’ll offer whatever comfort I can.”
find them and—
Dean placed his hand over Castiel’s for a single moment before clearing his throat and looking what direction he thought might be up. “Um, what’s your favorite star?” he asked, changing the subject.
Castiel laughed, fingers tracing Dean’s face. “That’s not a thing.”
“Cas?” Dean said weakly, backing away from the hand at his collarbone. “What do you mean?”
"You're insufferable," Castiel told him, matter-of-fact.
"Yes but I uh… I'm really bad at it." Sam examined Jack briefly. "Do you want me to teach you?"
“Oh, I’m sorry. I wasn’t aware that you were piloting this abomination. Please, direct us to the surface.”
Castiel shook his head. "This last time I died and returned, I could remember everything. And of all the things I remembered, Patroclus was the brightest."
Cas hid his smile, brushing off his tuxedo. “I could say the same of you.” He looked at his shined shoes for a moment. “I am… sorry that I am not Jimmy, but—”
Sam gaped at her. "I have never.
And I got the blues
(Turn away)
“Love,” Castiel corrected, spat out, like he was angry at that fact, like he wished he could punch Dean in the stomach and leave without looking back. “You are Hell, Dean Winchester.”
“Oh god,” he said, feigning wiping away a tear. “Imagine that. Imagine your job being ‘wolf guy’ or some shit.”
Cas glanced around their slightly-decorated box and smiled. "Yeah," he whispered back. "It is."
Dean’s head rested on Castiel’s shoulder. “Is this okay?”
"And why wouldn't I? Imagine. He wakes up, and your dead, lifeless corpse is here. Decaying. Forever. And he can't escape."
The hand on his cheek moved to his ear, and there was a puzzled hum. “Strange. It almost feels like— nevermind. Sam, my friend, what are you doing here?”
“I’m full of surprises,” Cas teased. “And I’m afraid you are, too. Shall we shower?”
"He was four years older than me," Sam said, eyes twinkling at Jack's confusion.
"Sam," she said, "something happened to Orion."
"Good. It's tryin' to look out for us all." She clapped her hands. "No matter! We'll need its help to find all of these items."
Dean’s expression softened. “Do you really think I could ever stop missing my baby bear?”
Donna smiled softly. “I did like Castiel a lot. I’ve met him a few times. He always seemed like the quiet, gentle type.”
“I’m afraid so.”
Your hand grips hand
They fired round after round into his chest, but, to no avail. The man stood before Dean, who now held a knife.
"Remember when thirty seemed so old
"Hey," Claire said. "I'm back. Sam wants to go on a picn— Um… is that an egg?"
"I…" Gabriel stared deep into Sam's soul. "I was not the only angel to wake up out there. They are my brothers. I want them back. I want to restore Heaven."
"Valid."
"It means there are monsters out there that can hear us, even here. So maybe there are three phases. Maybe four. Maybe nineteen. The point is, if we want Dean and Castiel back, we can't talk about it."
Come get a little known
“What is your point, Gabriel?” Raphael asked.
“You found a
"I need you," Castiel whispered, voice breaking.
"It's Michael," Apollo said, pointing far, far down into the sea at a black dot. "He's after Dean."
“Dean,” Castiel warned, pleaded amidst the new feelings crashing against their sides.
so weak, Castiel. You want this, don't you?" There was a scrape of teeth against his jugular, a press of tongue, a hand trailing down. "You want
"... So this is what humans mean when they say they have butterflies in their stomach."
Fergus nodded absently. "In that case, if it's not too much trouble…"
"What's your plan?" Castiel asked Sam softly, the rain having stopped.
Cas closed his eyes. "I'm glad to hear that."
"... Can I tell you something?"
Dean shook his head. “I gave up everything for him. He gave up everything for me. Our happiness, our mental health… It’s not… It’s not healthy.
They all grouped around the garage, divided into two teams.
“Talk to me, kid,” Gabe said, leaning down to grab the next from a bucket. He was still healing, and it bothered him to no end.
Maggie popped open the glove box, thumbing through old cassettes.
Charlie yelled over the sheer force of wind in the garage. Every hand was on deck, pushing and pushing at the lid, fighting against a force older than time itself.
“And I’m gonna pre-apologize for how I’m gonna act next time you see me. It’s been… a very long time since we’ve seen each other.”
can call it today.”
“Mm, good point. Why do I care?” Gabriel mused aloud, throwing another baseball. “Something something something family. Something about you reminding me of a certain little brother of mine. Something about not being a shitty person. Humor me.”
All the laws we once obeyed, they have betrayed us
"It's just..." Cas began to drawl his words, "That's a mighty soft move, for a man who just killed two cowboys."
Sam tugged hard at Dean's shirt. "Then come home!" Sam screamed.
Dean felt the crash of water against the sides of his box – his coffin. He heard the sound get muffled, felt the cold water flood in. His heart hammered. He had done well not to think of this, up unto this point. Now, he wished he had thought some more.
"I'm not sure, to be frank."
Dean's face lit up. "Finally! A way to track time! Well, unless you're just lying about the days, too." He shrugged. "I have no idea how long has passed."
renaming intercourse?"
“We both grew up too fast.”
They sat in silence for a while as Sam found the coffee cups.
I'd save my last wish and go whoop Sammy's ass at soccer.
And I think of you"
"I said I quit."
It reminded him, somewhat, of creation.
“Whatever you asked of me,” Dean found his soul saying, commandeering his lips for the task.
"Then why—"
"You are," Sam told him. "You're coming back."
a party in the front.”
Castiel laughed softly. “Yes, I remember hearing about that.” There was electricity in the air, a stillness. “Wait…”
Gabriel looked around. "How do we know if it worked?"
"This isn't up for debate."
“Your eyes,” she sobbed.
Gabriel tossed a ball to him, which he promptly threw against a tree.
"That's the wager," Dean attempted to grumble. In truth, he could only be secretly pleased that Cas won. It meant he got to pull him in for a long, slow kiss, the kind he used to dream about giving.
Jack took his hand easily. “Someone like Maggie?”
There were hackles raised, wings spread intimidatingly. Here was the rebel, the traitor, the scourge.
Dean huffed out a breath. "That's a bit… That's past my imagination's paygrade. Can't you just show me?"
“I barely know you.”
Dean groaned, his head pounding. “It’s your own damn fault you’re down here! Don’t go blaming me!” He kneed Michael in the groin, but nothing happened. “If you hadn’t
“It was your hymn,” Castiel responded.
Gabriel paused before smiling softly. "Yeah. That's it. It's the only title I've had that I actually liked."
"Thanks."
Castiel stared blankly at him a second before a smile graced his face, and he covered his mouth as he laughed.
"Lots of music!"
Driving in your car
Castiel mulled it over. “As romantic as it would be to point out that, since the world reuses so much organic material, every human has lived entire other lifetimes… I think the answer is no. We found each other here and now, against all odds. This lifetime is all we have.”
Jack barely noticed the pink blush on Charlie’s cheeks, instead drifting to look at her pride flag. “So you’re lesbian,” he deadpanned.
"Yeah, he keeps running away from me." Jack shrugged, wings bouncing. "I'm sure it's these bad boys."
Perhaps I would not have to take lives tonight.
“And that’s true. You were all ragged and rough and worn, but still with those beautiful blue eyes.” Dean chuckled to himself. “You know I used to call the sea blue? And the sky? Precious gems, paints, wallpapers… But, looking at you now, I realize I have never seen blue before this.”
Cas was suspicious, he knew. So was Sam. But this whole thing would blow over soon, anyways.
Charlie switched to black. “It means you don’t feel romantic or sexual attraction.”
“You should know I don’t care,” Dean teased lightly.
He thumped his head back against the door, refusing to think about what he now knew.
“How much further?” Sam gritted out, eyes narrowed against the biting wind.
Naomi glared Raphael down. “No,” she said. “I will fight this. The souls in here do not deserve to visit the Earth. I will make sure this plan does not work.”
“Dean!” Sam called out, laughing over his shoulder. “Get your ass in gear!”
Sam nodded, grinning. "My date never showed up so he and his friend Mark took me instead. We went and got milkshakes after we had stayed there for like, I dunno, an hour or so. It wasn't the best of parties. Then Mark took us to neat hidden places around town."
“This entire world is interesting,” Bobby admitted, looking for screws. “Nothing constantly lookin’ over your shoulder, nothing huntin’ you. It’s relaxing.” He handed Jody a few screws. “I like it here. But I am sorry about your Bobby. Mary told me you were friends.”
"Oh, Sam." Rowena gestured to the shadows of tents outside. "They're what changed."
Dean growled, wriggling his best to try and loose Castiel.
“I did what he told me.”
Donna jogged in after her. “Heya! We’ve got some great news.”
Dean searched Sam's eyes for something
Maggie yawned, leaning over to check her alarm. "It's 4am."

“Oh, it went fantastic! We went and saw a movie, threw popcorn at each other, and—” Charlie paused in her painting for a moment. “And other stuff. It was a good night.”
I'm coming too!"
The last time that you touched me
And Dean was on the ground, curled up, and hacking his fucking lungs up.
“Proof of what?”
"You can't get out," he ground out.
And I waited.
Cas desperately wished to reach out, twine fingers in short hair and figure out if Dean's eyes would flutter open, if his lips would part gently in the dark, waiting. "When I," Cas started, voice lower and more gravelly than intended, "When I worshipped God, I fought for him. I defended him and I swore myself to him. I think..." Cas licked his lips, as if they could ever be dry at the bottom of the ocean. "I think I've been worshipping you for years."
They both leapt up, weapons at the ready. The sound only grew stronger, the wind blowing more fiercely.
Dean leaned in, speaking low. “I was thinking down the hall.”
"Orion," he told her, pointing up at a long line of straight stars. It wasn't Orion, but it was, in that moment. "Most kids, they learn the big dipper first. I couldn't pick that one out until I was twenty. But Orion — Orion I could always find."
understood forever! Not when you sold your soul! Not when you got into this
"What do you want from me?" Sam finally whispered.
Shelter us
“You do,” Castiel said resolutely. “But even if you didn’t, his actions are not your decisions to make. He’s going to find a way to cure you of the mark. He
She laid back in the grass, hair spread out. "Summerland," she mused thoughtfully.
Sam rubbed the back of his neck. “We can’t have it listening. All we have is the element of surprise.”
“You never have easy answers, do you?” Dean rested his forehead against Castiel’s.
Castiel squeezed his eyes shut and thought of every reason this couldn't happen.
Dean looked up at a toddler Sam.
“Then why stay here? To taunt me? To torture me?”
“Hey, Gabriel?” Maggie asked, doing tai chi over the mud hole. Every graceful movement of her arms sent the mud swirling slowly, mixing and mixing.
Sam frowned, upping the pace. "No."
“It still looks like a horse, then.”
Dean could only nod, chest heaving, back arching.
Castiel looked down a moment. “Dean?” He held out a hand, which Dean grasped. “There is another option.”
"Bear?"
“I… I suppose so.” Gabe traced a finger over Sam’s cheeks. “You’d really wanna visit a couple of crotchety old immortals in your perfect afterlife? I’ll be honest, most people didn’t even
“I don’t… I don’t know if I approve of that plan of action,” Castiel said, laughing softly.
I'd give up all I had just to
"Hakuna matata," Dean responded, absently pushing his fingers through Castiel's hair.
Claire giggled over her margarita, leaning heavily into Jack, who was laughing at something Maggie said. Everyone was milling about somewhere or another, divided into small groups whose boundaries did not stay confined to their circle. Charlie kept leaning over from her conversation with Donna, Jody, and the very cute Daisy to poke Rowena’s side and offer some joke or another.
“It’s not
Fergus shrugged. "No one knows. Of course, I was rather hoping the angels knew."
“That would explain the WizRock shirt.”
“Is that what the kids are calling it these days?”
She held out her hand. “Hi, bi. I’m lesbian.”
Maggie laughed softly. "We change as we grow older, I think. Teenage-me was a different person altogether. Teenage-me just wanted to see twenty."
Dean still
It did not go that way.
Castiel frowned. “It does?”
Castiel ignored him. "And for two, Revelation often… overpowers humans."
When Castiel’s fingers lost their battle with Mother Nature and instead lost themselves in Dean’s hair, the answering moan was enough to tighten them, to pull forward, to respond likewise.
“...Yes.”
"Okay." Sam reached out and grabbed his book, careful not to disturb Gabe. "I'm assuming you will be napping here?"
As it settled easily into the cardboard box, she felt just a little of the weight on her shoulders leave.
Rowena eyed her wrinkled pajama pants. "Not likely," she responded, giving Jody a terse smile. "I'm here to help Sam and Jack. It seems somethin' happened here last night, but no one will tell me what."
Once it was just him in the void, he sat back in his chair, head in his hands. So much was running through his mind. He felt like his thoughts were on fire, like whatever liquid his brain was suspended in was boiling.
I remember how soft the dirt was.
"No, shut up. I get it. Really, I do. But this is ridiculous. Of
Old words echoed in his mind, words from a tearful, joyous grasp as the Ma’lak box slowly sank beneath the water.
Sam breathed out slowly. "I don't know what to do now."
Claire nodded wordlessly as the world blurred around her.
"I don't know," Sam responded. "I don't think our plan is going to work." It felt like he was kneeling in a church, confessing his deepest sins. "I don't know if I ever truly thought it would."

“Alright. In that case…” Sam cleared his throat and announced, loud and clear, “It’s time to save Dean and Castiel, and
"I'd worship you," he breathed.
Gabriel’s eyes were wide, glancing back and forth so quickly colors were blurring. “I don’t… What is… What is all this?”
it doesn’t make it
"Sam."
“We’re both criminals,” Castiel told Dean’s mouth.
"Do I?"
When night fell, Sam went home again.
"I hear he actually has a thing with Rowena!"
“Hey, Mags,” Jack said, leaning back on his free hand and watching everyone.
Sam looked at his phone and jumped. "Fuck almighty! How long have we been asleep?"
“I don’ think so.”
"I know last night is taboo for a while, and so is everything else for tonight, but sometime I wanna hear about what your life was like."
"What's so funny?" Dean asked, ears ringing.
"Okay well, I
Rowena went wide-eyed. "Hell is

“Now,
The first thing that I'd like to do
This world doesn't matter
“Then how do we know Cas is even still out there?!”
"How much longer do you think?"
The old lady came up to see what all the commotion was about.
“Because you two are
They walk me to the park just down the street where I agreed to meet Isabelle. And we’re waiting and waiting, and Dean and Mark are swinging on the swings a bit, and like, thirty minutes go by. Then an hour.
Mary snorted. “You’ll always be my baby, Sam.” She kissed his cheek. “You have some amazing children.”
"Pure luck. And it still is."
Dean’s eyes softened. “Thanks, Bear.”
"I remember doing the Time Warp
“Guess everyone’s off doing their own things,” Sam said, kicking his shoes off at the door. “I’m gonna go shower.”
Dean furrowed his brow. "What, so soon? Isn't this supposed to be endless?" He snapped his fingers. "Ah! I got it. This is gonna be a recurring thing, right?"
"An' me, too," Rowena mumbled, carrying her drink after them.
"We climbed trees just last week!"
“I— I, I adopted Jack.”
Something that wasn't there when he stepped foot inside this coffin.
Claire sniffed. "Quite the day, huh?"
Dean shouldered him. "C'mon! It'll be fun!"
Gabriel's hands were gentle as they brushed down his wing, restoring it meter by meter.
Claire tried and failed to flip a pancake again. “This is impossible!”

Everyone but him.
"The same thing I wanted from Castiel. I want you to try."
But, as all good things must, it ended. Heaven's army, disguised as soldiers, came to drag us onto the battlefield.
"And you would practically be fusing with me in the middle of an empty room!"
"I don't… I don't understand…"
His hands tightened against back and he pulled desperately, trying to get Castiel to just
Sam ignored her, ears red as he waited for the coffee to finish.
I don't know how long has passed since I've gone. I don't know if it's been days or weeks or years. I don't know when you'll find this. I hope it wasn't immediately. I hope you've had time to come to terms with it all, and this is that final piece you need to truly move on.
She schooled her smile. "I could go for a pancake or two, yes."
"Castiel."
"You really..." Cas swallowed harshly, finding his anger draining. "You really should've thought about that before coming down here."
“Dean,” Castiel placed a hand against his cheek. “I’m not John.”
Don't be afraid Cecilia
"I can try."
Castiel looked at what had been Dean’s chair, the only thing in the room covered in dust. “You don’t mean the way things were just a few days ago, do you.” It wasn’t a question.
“I would, too,” Donna responded. She looked back at her screen, pressing more buttons. “I can’t imagine forgettin’ Jody. That sounds like Hell.” She sighed. “It woulda been nice if we had Dean’s memories somewhere in these old computers. Then we could just give them back.”

Donna’s eyes lit up. “Hey, me, too! What’s yours like?”
Their eyes met in hellish heat, Dean calm and Sam enraged. They stared each other down, neither one wavering.
He would scoop me up and fly on his back, me crouched on his chest.
Dean jerked awake, vaguely aware of Castiel fast asleep beside him. It was cold and scratchy in the room. There were too many sounds: the heater, the Bunker settling, the muffled noise of a TV somewhere far off.
I came to a post without blood and steeled myself. I did what they asked of me.
“Dick.”
The sand was difficult to trek through, pulling at their legs. And it was hot, absolutely
"Of course. You've been working very hard. Perhaps you should take a break?"
" Dean cut himself off, wincing. "No. I should've done better to let you know how much I love you. We all should've. You don't ever doubt that, okay? No matter what happens down here. We all love you, Cas. We just... We don't say that a lot. We weren't raised to
"Worry. About me. I'm doing alright."
Castiel’s arms were circling Dean. They were strong and warm and loving, and Dean wished to never leave them. “Yes?”
“I can turn invisible, if you do not recall.”
I was not made to acknowledge pain. I was a soldier, made to withstand the brutalities of demonic war. The wind was not to sway me.
Jack wished he understood.
"Dean," she said softly.
I was too young to fly for very far or long by myself, so Gabriel would hold my hand as we flew, carrying me when necessary. We would fly out to the edge of the universe.
He was sleeping.
Charlie touched the void curiously, hand coming back dripping with black. "I don't think it's a problem just yet," she finally said. "I just think this is phase two."
Gabriel had his legs across Charlie's lap, doodling in his sketchbook as she played an old game on a handheld.
"I— okay, yeah, that's fair." Claire shrugged. "I jumped around too much after Mom died. Never stayed anywhere long enough to go to prom."
Claire grinned. “Oh, haven’t you heard? Maggie and I aren’t getting married until tomorrow.”
"Want some bourbon?"
that you will love me?”
"Actually… I came here to ask you something."
Jack threw his arms out dramatically. "My son!"
Claire pointed. "Uh, no. I'm the
“He left me,” Jack finally said, for the first time.
He didn't.
"What's the real problem, huh? Because I'm helping you. Rowena is helping you.
“He… He thinks he’s in Hell.”
“Bitch,” Gabriel deadpanned at Sam, sending him into giggles so loud they had to pause in the healing. “You want a kiss with that? You know I’m happy to oblige.”
Cas waited patiently, slowly intertwining their fingers. “May I ask what it is that is distressing you?”
Sam yawned. “I figured… when I die, iffin’ I go to Heaven, I can just mosey on down here to you two.”
“Yes.”
I said goodbye to my love then
"Oh, ya know. It goes where everything lost goes."
Michael bared his teeth, eyes filled with hellfire as he brought the book down again, again. “Fuck off!”
With a very human glance up through eyelashes, Castiel reached out and undid one of Dean’s shirt buttons.
“Dean,” Castiel said back, puzzled.
“Samster, what would make you think that?” Gabriel asked, lifting his head to see him better.
and Bobby!"
Jack shrugged one shoulder, then the other. "Well, it's mostly just preparation for phase three. Trial runs, resource gathering, stuff like that."
Sam snorted, laying his palms flat on the table. “You’ve really lightened up since you got here.”
"I'm tryin' to, but
Wait no that's dumb. I'd wish Michael was out of my fuckin' head, then I'd wish that we were back on dry land, and
Rowena caught them uneasily. "Er…"
If there was five more minutes of air
And Claire was out for the count again, sitting on the leaf litter and completely useless for anything but laughter.
Claire gasped in air, still chuckling, and responded, "Aye, tis I! His blood runneth in my very veins!"
"Time passes different depending on space and gravity and since you two were at the bottom of the ocean—"
"We were, once," the voice breathed, so low Dean was sure he wasn't meant to hear.

“Ach,” Rowena growled. “Jest talk to him already, would ye? Christ, ye two are worse than Fergus!”

So, they took me to prom.
“It never will be,” Gabriel whispered back, shaking. “Nothing will ever make it okay. But we can’t hold onto shit like this, Jack.”
“Hello. I was just checking in to see how things were going over here.”
(yes I very purposefully did not put a song for this one)
“He left us all for Dean. That’s not… That’s not fair.”
“An enemy.”
"It used to help Sam. Just... trade roles with me for a bit. I'll tell the story today."
"Whatever your first plan was. The one you changed for me. I'll do it."
Dean paled. “Uh, Cas, buddy? You’re not really helping me calm down.”
'You,' Castiel thought. "Michael," he said aloud.
Michael’s hand flew out, gripping Dean’s throat like a vice. “DO
Sam nodded resolutely. “I know. And I know I’m gonna have to fight with him. But I’m prepared for that.” He watched her fingers trace over his own. “Also, I’ve been thinking.”
Claire rolled her eyes but did as Dean said, giving the pan a hard jerk and sending her pancake into the air.
Sam gave him a small smile. “I’ve grown up a lot.”
Gabriel ground his teeth, focusing on putting one foot in front of the other. He couldn’t remember the last time he had felt this weak. The four homunculi had taken it out of him entirely, but he refused to not be present for this.
Maggie did grin this time, arms slowly trailing out to the sides. “So who is Jack gonna call Dad?”
Sam took a deep breath in and out, closing his eyes.
"Of course I do," Cas said like it still hurt his tongue, like
And he was coughing hard, but it didn't hurt anymore. His lungs were numb. He could feel flowers forcing their way past his lips, and his coughs were no longer making any sound.
Sam smiled, the pain in his heart subsiding. “I’m so happy for you two. When I was little, and I’d go to Bobby’s, I’d sit around and imagine how things would’ve been different if you had met him first. And I guess, now I’ll get to find out.”
And what difference does it make
Dean was letting out small sounds, sounds that Cas wasn’t sure he had ever known humans could make, sounds that seemed to ring out across space and time. Dean fumbled for Castiel’s free hand and dragged it down to his dick, pleading.
Castiel’s fists were tight in Dean’s shirt, and his chest was heaving with desperation before the switch flipped and he pulled Dean back the way they had come. “I have a hotel room,” Cas said very seriously.
to be brave.
Jack laughed and lunged with a tree branch of his own, and Maggie parried.
"— oh okay the story—"
"Hmm." Jack closed the computer, leaning over to a drawer and rummaging around. "I
“One more thing.”
He laughed, staring at its amber depths. "I'm in stasis," he admitted, playing with the spoon in the cup.
Dean listened to the soft scratching noises Castiel was making.
"Without a doubt," Claire responded, flipping through potential shows on their pirate server. "What do you wanna watch?"
For so long, Dean had wondered what Castiel tasted like. He had thought honey, or mint, or gunpowder.
And he would throw a fig skin at me, laughing. "You definitely aren't a god, either."
Castiel let out a slow breath. "I had a lover."
“Everything.”
to it’s just…”
Dean's eyes finally focused, and he could see Sam quietly bawling into his shoulder. "I c-an't," Sam forced out.
Sam puckered his lips like a fish and pressed a quick kiss against Dean's mouth. "Dad'sh like you," he said, face still squished.
“You know,” Castiel began, hand slipping into Dean’s hair, “I rather miss your cassette collection.”
"Was it important?"
Sam gasped awake in the lab, tears still trailing down his face.
“That’s Sam,” Dean said, recognizing the ringtone. “He… won’t quit trying to call me.”
"Then I'll keep a lookout. Anything else?"
They went around the pool like that, until they had come full circle.
There it was again. Something… not quite right. Dean felt it, felt it shift, turn sideways, and…
Sam laughed, even as a few stray tears slipped down his cheeks. “Hi, Mom. I’m Sam Winchester. I’m your son.”
Gabriel took it numbly. “I don’t understand.”
about you, don’t you?”
Is to save every day
"No. Don't. Don't 'Cas' me. When there are people around, this?" Castiel pushed his palm roughly against Dean's stubble, nails scraping back down. "This isn't okay. But it's okay if no one is around to see? Tell me you're not ashamed of me."
But he had to go
going to fuck everything—”
Claire motioned before heading towards an open door. Maggie followed, taking careful note of the sickly red glow emanating from it.
“Matches,” Charlie replied, leaning over to point at Donna’s screen. “This program has been running different combos of Castiel and Dean’s signatures since the last time we saw them. Now, we’ve just gotta send each one through to see if we find any matches. And, when we do— boom. Location pinpointed.”
Castiel’s fingers danced over the mark on Dean’s arm. “This is what killed them. You are merely the vessel.”
Sam shut his mouth.
And then he'd be let out, back to the rack, knife in his hand and someone else's soul before him.
"Dean," Castiel warned.
Sam grinned wide at him. "Well at least that box is helping you come to terms with your emotions."

Haeliel stepped forward to her and Michael, Gabriel following closely. They joined hands in a ring, all except—
"You down?"
Castiel caught Gabriel's hands as they finished.
“Okay.”
"Fuck. Yeah, yeah you said this was gonna happen. You've only visited once before, right?"
Dean furrowed his brow. "Alright, Purgatory I've heard of. What's the Empty?"
Rowena observed him calmly, still slightly huddled in her blankets. “Yer upset about somethin’, Samuel.”
Castiel laughed softly, head dropping and chest heaving. “Okay, Dean,” he whispered to the hot air between them. “But there will be no turning back.”
“I get it.”

to know.” Dean kissed him gently, still lost in the mental haze that was Castiel’s love. He kissed him again and again, until he had almost entirely forgotten what they were talking about.
am I supposed to do? Huh, Dean? What am I supposed to do?!" Tears stung his eyes.
"Claire--"
"Should we tell Sam?" Claire asked, feet shuffling in worry.
I've been on my own
"All the souls and monsters should be there," Maggie whispered.
"And since there's nothing else in here to relate it to, Tombstone wins!" Cas was silent, so Dean poked him. "We can even start at the gunfight if you want."
Maggie jolted, like she just remembered something. “Uh, oh. Shit. Um…” She raised her hand timidly.
“Yes. Please, I want to understand.”
It’s cheesy, man. It’s so cheesy. I feel like a teenage girl writing this but I don’t know how else to say it. I would say I love you, but that’s really damn understated. I’ve had this stupid fantasty since I decided to jump into that box. And it’s eons down the line, and the sun eats the Earth, and I like to sit back and think about seeing the light again. And you wanna know the first thing I would look for? When I’m in Heaven or Hell or Purgatory or wherever?

"We should charge them rent," Dean told Castiel's lips.
“I missed you, too, Bear.”
Gabriel rubbed his thumb against the back of Sam's hand. "You won't be okay until you try, will you?"
Bobby was beside him, and the night was cold and unforgiving. “You sure you did the ritual right?” Dean asked, carving the table absently with a knife.
"Deer. Any kind, really. They were the first animal I encountered when I returned to Earth. I landed in the grass, and there was a doe with her fawn, staring at me. They didn't even run, just watched me silently."
"Wait, Kim Possible is still a thing here?"
Castiel pulled his trenchcoat tighter around him. "Hello, Gabriel," he said distractedly. "I was wondering if you might tell me where Dean is. I cannot seem to—" He stumbled, leaning heavily against the shelf and closing his eyes tightly. "I can't seem to find him."
Gabriel’s hand tightened protectively on Castiel’s wrist.
“I imagine you pretending to be bad at singing has something to do with you feeling like you are unworthy of attention.”

is an important cinematic experience.” He poked her fake elf ears. “And you fully agree.”
Jody rolled her eyes fondly. “We don’t need anymore Winchesters.”
“Take a seat,” Gabriel said, patting the ground beside him.
“Oh, how very adventurous of you. Are you sure it’s safe?” Cas teased. “Perhaps we should stock up on rock salt and grab the Colt.”
Maggie shrugged one shoulder, then the other. Everyone was sent into another chorus of laughter.
“Will be fine. And even if they’re not, it’s okay.” He found his arms filled suddenly and completely with Charlie, who was shaking.
Tried my hand at prayer
"What are we gonna make?" Donna said suddenly, pushing against the silence.
Mary half-laughed, shaking her head. “I’ve always been a hunter. What am I gonna do now?”
Castiel took a deep breath. “And what did you say?”
Dean rolled out of the way, yanking an iron poker out of the fireplace. “We both were parents by the time we could string together sentences.” He parried the strike, kicking Michael in the stomach.

idea?"
she read aloud. "A heterosexual romance. Thaaaaaanks."
When Sam and Rowena pulled back into the drive, Sam immediately shut off the car.
“Time doesn’t exist.”
Sam watched as Claire and Jack both kicked their shoes off as well, running barefoot after Maggie into the woods. "That's fair," he told her softly.
"Cas-"
"Do you know anyone who
How I wish it had not been so.
Sam matched it easily. "We're all a little weak. And we all have stuff to work on. And… maybe you three hurt my feelings a bit, but you were right. I've pushed everything else aside, just like my dad used to do. And I don't wanna be him, so I'm taking steps to fix it."
WARNING
The bird didn't move.
“You’re on.” Maggie paused the game to smile at Claire. “Today was a good day, huh?”
Gabriel cleared his throat and Rowena blushed madly, both reaching for the bowl of salve again.
Rowena ran her hands over Sam’s fingers, leaving green light in their wake. “And yer sure about this?” she asked, watching him carefully. “Last time Dean had his memories back, he wasn’t too keen on ye rescuin’ him.”
She knew it was a dream. Sorta. She knew it in the way that she knew gas powers a car, or that a circuit controls the lights in a house. But when she would turn the key in the ignition, or flip the switch, she didn't think about all the different things that happened.
"Easy there, Dean. What's the hurry? You don't have anywhere to be."
Jack bawled.

And then the door snapped.
Dean's fingers tightened in Sam's shirt. "You were supposed to go live a normal life. Play soccer or something."
“I’m sure the IRS will be giving us a call any day now.”
"No one in the history of time has called intercourse 'fusing'."
Castiel watched him, watched all of him, and shook his head, coming to stand so close to him that Dean could feel the electricity in his bones.
Sam listened as bare feet plodded into the room. “Heya, Rowena. Sam.”

“You’ll never take me alive, coppers!” Dean responded with a ridiculous accent, grin widening at Castiel’s laugh.
Wonderin' if you have any sign of life
"He is not there anymore." Castiel pressed absently at his own ears, like he was trying to muffle the noise.
“We owe three million in back taxes,” Dean said, lowering his voice like a television announcer.
Michael said calmly.
"Stay away from large vines."

, and
The floor was cool against his feet, and it was the first hint of respite he had found.
“You’re not in trouble,” Sam said, trying to shove him playfully but instead high-fiving the air beside him.
“...maybe.”
"I… I like it. I've never been a dad before, though. I wouldn't know where to start."
Dean looked so… small, so desperate. Castiel traced the lines of his face reverently.
“Oh, yeah. Ya like it better here?”
Everyone waved from the grass as Jody and Donna’s car threw dust up onto the road, far into the distance, until they couldn’t see it anymore.
Maggie tossed her hand upon her brow. "But at what cost, dear audience? The innocence! Hath it gone to the wind? Doth he know too well now the ways of this world?" She grabbed Jack's hands entreatingly. "Oh, dearest of dears, do speak unto mine ears. Answer me this: doth thou still haveth love for the cocoa?"
“Claire wants you to walk her down the aisle.”
“What? My grace?”
There was a place in his chest that hurt, that ached every time he glanced at Dean, floating silently beside him.
“Cas,” Dean warned, eyes half-lidded.
Gabriel looked away, hiding his smile.
He looked around at the books at the head of the bed, at the bedside table, at the bed itself. No, this wasn’t his room at all. His room must have moved.
Dean rolled his eyes. "You said you're an angel or something, right? Can't angels like…

now. And you're not getting away from me."
"Thank you," Castiel said quietly, turning back to the hall. "I believe I'm faring better than Dean is, still."
Dean, and it's your ticket out of—"
The truth is, a lot of times I let Dad get to me. And I thought that I was worthless, and that nothing I did was any good. But then I'd see Sam. I raised him, ya know? You do know that. I know you do. I'd see Sam, and I'd know I did at least one thing right.

"Because we are stuck down here
Cas snorted. "Especially that one. It's a rare thing, you winning a game against me."
Jack made some sound somewhere above him, and the fluffiness against his face moved some. Sam yawned.
Charlie’s smile was blinding. “She’s the sweetest! She’s a bartender and she teaches me how to make really cool drinks. And she
Mary shook her head. “No. Neither of us had very good endings to our marriages. But we’re together, for as long as the world allows. And that’s that.”
“Right.” Gabriel leaned down and grabbed the last baseball. “Ready?”
Sam sat still as Charlie carefully washed the blood off his face.
Gabriel pulled him inside, closing and locking the door behind them. He pushed Sam onto the bed, and Sam put up no resistance. Just stared at the ceiling, unseeing.

Dean picked him up, bewildered.

Jack grasped desperately at Maggie's hands, eyes wide and serious as he said, "Mine love for the cocoa is overshadowed not by the grain, nor drink, nor still. Mine love for the cocoa is deepened just by my love for—" Jack paused, trying to think up a rhyme, "the pickles of dill."
Dean let out a breath and laid his heated head on the cool table, willing away the cold knife that felt lodged in his heart. That wasn't how he wanted it to go. That wasn't how he wanted to lose Sam.
maybe next time, I should just shut you up.”
"No, Sam. I mean, I see why you feel guilty. But… don't. You're right. I would prefer to stay with Dean. Both or none."
"Because I have followed you into the dark more times than I dare recall."
"G'mornin, Sam," Rowena mumbled. "What time is it?"
“And I’m supposed to, I know. I just don’t know how. I don’t
Sam’s entire world swirled.
The angels saw Castiel first.
Jody muffled her laugh with her hand. “Claire, be nice to your grandpa.”
Dean stabbed Michael in the stomach, gasping in a breath as Michael fell off of him, holding his midriff. “He knows everything, huh?” Dean asked, voice raspy. “He’s God, and he’s all-powerful, and he knows everything?”
Castiel began to tell him of other experiences, but Dean wasn't listening.
“And a flag.” She held up his nails for him to see. “The aro one looks a lot like this.”
“Just?”
Jody secured the last screw and grinned at Claire. “Maybe you should listen to me more, then.”
"The demons, Sam. We're all human again." He cleared his throat awkwardly. "Need help with the groceries?"
Sam looked around for Castiel, finally spotting him beside Claire and Maggie, engrossed in the adorableness of baby Sam. “You’ve been staring at me all afternoon.” Sam said, turning to Dean.
"Meeting up. It's not gonna work and it makes everything harder and you deserve better."
"Anytime he was in the area, yeah."
Claire raised an eyebrow. “I think

Dean still got butterflies when Cas touched his hand, when their fingers brushed against each other. Dean still held his breath when Cas was speaking softly, afraid to miss even a letter. He still blushed when Cas played with his hair, when Cas smoothed down his shirt, when Cas let him fall asleep tangled up with him.
Sam shrugged. "There's a cassette in the glove box that has an aux cord attached. You totally can."
Dean's hands were on his back, trailing slowly ever-downward. "Castiel, I am dazed, right now. In a few minutes I'm likely gonna freak out over the fact that I led an entire other life I can't remember, a life where I

Castiel jumped slightly. It had been deathly quiet for ages. "I… what?"
Ao3 wigged out and added this same chapter like six times so I'm sorry to anyone that thought I was doing some major updating today lol
"I mean, yeah, basically. I'll be back soon. In a few days or so."
“Okay.”
Something soft and quiet settled in his stomach. This felt too much like a midnight vigil for his tastes. “Hey,” Sam told the air. “Missed you, Dean.”
Before you ask: yes, this is the
Rowena sat a bottle of bourbon in front of him. "Drink up," she said. "I imagine ye've got quite the story to tell us."
I could tell the truth but that would be a lie
"From what I heard, he told God that the Plan was a load of, and I quote, 'actual horseshit' and that he would rather live with the humans than spend one more minute under God's guidance."
“Yeah.”
" Dean's hand trailed up Cas's chest, lips moving to his neck. "
"I find that hard to believe."
Sam's smile faltered. "I love you, too, Dean."
Sam smoothed out the bed, admiring his handiwork. “There,” he said, smiling back at his mom. “Perfect.”
New beginnings.
having this discussion again. Water is wet. It is the literal
“Enough for what?”
Dean saw Sam and stopped cold.
Dean looked up from where he was trying to make a grocery list, with all the misspelled words and backwards S’s. “Heya, Sammy.”
“Ye’re terrible at flirtin’, Sam,” Rowena chided.
Castiel pulled Gabriel’s forehead against his own. “Her time will come. You and I? We have to move past this.”
Sam sighed. “Well…”
"You know how to dance?" Jack asked, smiling wide.
“You said you loved me.”
"What did you do?" It came so quietly, so sincerely, that Castiel almost didn't hear it.
"Here's Castiel's smile." Smash.
"I wish I could just forget all of this and move on."
"Hey Jodes," Claire said, grinning. "We gonna get this show on the road or what?"
“How long have you been wearing it?”
A single hand went up.
There were too many stars in the night sky. No crickets chirped, no car horns sounded. There was nothing, really, but her and Dean.
"Obviously."
“I realize now that Purgatory was not when I fell in love with you. It was just when I figured it out.” Dean touched his own chest. “See, every time I’ve looked at you, from when you first barged into that barn to when you came back to me, I’ve felt it. Right here, in my chest. I’ve always loved you, Castiel. But, even as I say that, I can look at you. Here, in front of me.” Dean held Castiel’s face in his hands, eyes shining with love. “And the way I feel now? I don’t think I’ve ever been so entirely gone on you as I am right this moment. I keep thinking I know what love is, and then you smile, or you laugh, and I realize it’s more vast than I ever imagined.” He thumbed away the few stray tears that had rolled down Castiel’s frozen face. “I would like to spend the rest of my life exploring the vastness of us.”
Dean was suddenly aware of their proximity, of his own face heating up. He quickly pressed his fingers back against the etching. “I’m sorry,” he mumbled.
"Stop talking."
“Want some coffee?”
That flash of beautiful, deep indigo had brought tears to Dean's eyes, vision swimming with all the shades of blue again before they vanished just as quickly. He had forgotten how beautiful blue was. He had forgotten how beautiful
"Just
They turned around to see her with her hands in her dress pockets, head tilted slightly.
There was a loud clunking noise, and both looked up to see Castiel trying to stack objects back onto a nearby shelf.
"There were a few."
“I told him we were alone,” Castiel said, mostly to himself. “I told him you couldn’t be real.”
Mary gave him a sad smile, tears threatening to spill. “Maybe we should start over,” she whispered.
And Sam smiled at him, sad and apologetic. “Because he never stopped thinking about
“I mean, my life’s pretty shallow right now, Cas. It’s a lot deeper when it’s got you in it.”
mean, Dean? When you say you care about… me?” Michael observed Dean in the dark, taking a deep inhale through a borrowed nose. It felt good to stretch. It felt good to be

"Michael's gotten to you. You know I'm not ashamed of you. I introduced you to Bobby, remember? I told him we could trust you. I'm not ashamed."
"You can only ask once."
I have been doing nothing but sinning for you since I met you.” He moved one hand to Dean’s hair, pulling their foreheads together. “I have rebelled against Heaven, I have killed my siblings, I have all but denounced my Father in preference of you. I have committed all these holy atrocities, but the markedly
Dean’s eyes finally opened, searching for Castiel fruitlessly in the water. “I said no.”
Rowena grinned around her bottle. "Perhaps we should get Samuel to bed, yeah?" she asked Gabriel.
Gabe shouldered him. “I came to tell ya that tall, dark, and handsome over there has been eyeing you all morning.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"He—? Oh. Oh! You mean Dean."
Dean smirked. “Very well.”
Dean snorted. "True voice? What, even gravellier than this? Or do you sound like Minnie Mouse?"
“He told me he could tell me how long I’ve been down here.”
There was no response, and Castiel squeezed his own eyes shut.
“We are not. You should kill me.”
Charlie’s lips twitched. “I won’t tell anyone,” she promised.
I would've given anything to see his face covered in fig again, to see his eyes light up with life.
Sam gritted his teeth and tossed the balled-up towel into a corner. "I really wish they'd all leave. We could visit them instead. It's dangerous here."
and he seemed content to keep it that way.
Dean froze. "What?"
"I just… I'm going out for a run. Thought you might wanna join?"
“Donna, actually. Jody will be my maid of honor. Jack is gonna be Claire’s.”
Patroclus got stuck somewhere in the Veil. I would see him, sometimes, and I would talk to him, and beg him not to go. He promised he wouldn't, and he'd fade, and he'd fade. He grew less happy. His smiles were rare.
Charlie went back to painting his nails. “How old are you, again?”
Sam tightened his hold on the two of them, pulling them tight against his sides. “It ain’t perfect if it ain’t got y’all,” he breathed before falling asleep.

"There's an egg on my bed. What do I do with this?"
“I didn’t say anything.”
Oh, but hold your breath
"Is this… Is this
"Slang," Cas repeated slowly.
“And you said you don’t have a reason, just justification.”
Gabriel groaned and smushed his face against Sam's neck. "How the fuck did I fall for you?"
“What about—“
Sam absently swirled his mug, smiling. "Ya know, Dean definitely was my brother, too, though. And he was a little piece of crap a lot of the times, but sometimes… sometimes he'd let it slip in public that he loved me." Sam leaned in conspiratorially. "He took me to my junior prom."
Claire grinned. “We’ll have to get you to play Red Dead next. You’ll love it. Ya know…” Claire opened one eye, “if you ever finish
"Your body is just acclimating to the—"
He was way smarter than me.
Another angel raised their hand. A foot soldier, Raphael recalled.
Dean closed his eyes and took a shuddering breath. “You sure?”
"The-..." Sam furrowed his brow. "Wait, no. Dean, I'm real. This is real."
“Like guys. Dean, I know.” Sam gave him a soft smile. “I’ve known for a long time, okay?” He held Dean’s face in his hands. “If it makes you feel more accepted, I like guys, too.”
"Yeah?"
When silly thoughts go through my head
"Are you gonna be okay?"
"Ellen?"
He pulled back, eyebrows raised. “It’s not?”
"O' course I'm in."
He just couldn’t— understand.
“I don’t know if I agree with that.” Dean looked at Sam, really looked at him. “You’re different than I remember.”
Charlie poked him, bouncing on her toes. “Sam.
Jack sighed loudly. "Are all children this stubborn?"
Gabriel pushed Sam softly with his foot. “You’re an idiot,” Gabe told him.
If he didn’t focus on it, his guard would drop, and he would smile. Or, god forbid,
“... I know.”
Sam sat up, rubbing his head. "How long've you been here?"
(See the end of the chapter for
He laughed softly. "Yeah, maybe." He rubbed his free hand over his face. "I do need to go grocery shopping. We don't have any junk food for Dean."
Cas squeezed his eyes shut and nodded.
And she wanted to say
Dean couldn’t help but think of a fake memory, a Michael memory, with Sam sacrificing everything for him. “This isn’t some big deal, is it? You’ve been enjoying life these past few years?”
Gabriel faltered.
Rowena and Gabriel exchanged a red-cheeked look. "It's about time you got to bed Samster," Gabe said, pulling Sam away from the center of the room.
holding his stomach, forehead resting on Dean’s shoulder, laughing so hard tears were running from his eyes.
A smile tugged at Claire's lips. "You want to have a sleepover?"
“You’re thinkin’ of Daddy? He should be back in a few days—”
“A midwife named Clara."
Charlie raised an eyebrow. "Alright, Donna I get. How is
But it was not the disc.
"Ah, there's my brother." Sam gave Dean a gentle push back into his seat. "You're a lot calmer than I thought you'd be."
“Knock three times so we know who it is.”
There was an unearthly screech.
"Oh my god oh my g— I never thought I'd see you again I thought you were
Charlie grinned at him. “Right back atcha.”
He was a kid again. A kid sitting on the pavement outside, sniffling about a scraped knee. And Dean had come over, crouched down and smiled at him before patching him up gently.
Castiel!”
"Claire, Sam."
His lungs screamed, but he couldn't.
"Did you cut your hair? Wait no it doesn't matter. Look, we can't keep doing this, man."
Castiel traced Dean’s fingers with his own. “And I kind of feel that you’re
“Sorry,” Dean grumbled, throwing the knife aside. “Touchy, touchy, huh?”
Could he read any farther? Did he dare? This was a relic from a different life, a different world. Things had changed.
“Of your ugly mug? No way in Hell.”
"I don't
Cas raised an eyebrow, glancing pointedly at the gravity-defying, female-presenting boobs.
Gabriel shrugged, face red. “Look, I won’t be able to fix your eyes for a few days, minimum. This might be a Rowena problem.”
But this was the big one, right? Sam was turning forty.
Everyone followed, tossing a grin and a wink at Castiel and Dean. They’d get to talk to them soon.
Raphael stood up and held out her hands, and all chatter ceased. “Brothers,” she said. “Much has changed. God is gone, and based on the testimonies of Castiel and Gabriel, he is never coming back. It is up to us to figure this all out, and we are wasting time. This is new, and there are bound to be mistakes. It is how we deal with these that will define us.” She looked around, power emanating from her eyes. “All those adamantly opposed to opening the borders, raise your hand.”
Charlie smiled a bit and Claire whooped.
“Okay,” Gabriel whispered back.
Dean responded, letting the name roll off his tongue. He shouldn't be doing this. Why was he doing this.
"The animal?"
"I raised you. I love you. And I'm not letting this happen to you."
“Oh yeah?”
Dean furrowed his brow. "Yeah, of Cas. Not… this."
Maggie scrunched her nose at Claire. "You're a bad influence on him."
Dean cursed as the pain doubled.
"Only one thing can get out, so yes," she told him. "Though I still am off the case until things get better around here."
"Hey Sam?"
Sorry for shorter chapter, but there was
The lovers the dreamers and me"
Dean blinked back some tears and looked at the ceiling, clearing his throat. "Sam," he called out to the empty Bunker, "I know you're doing this, and I want you to know it's a super shitty thing to do."
(See the end of the chapter for
He ran down and watched as Castiel stood up to face him.
Dean gently punched the ceiling. "But besides all that, I really wanna hear your voice now."
that demons and angels don’t really have a refractory period,” he purred, kissing Castiel’s jaw, his throat.
"You've been here all day, huh?" Gabe asked, toeing the water. "We were looking for you, ya know."
There was a lurch in Dean's stomach, and suddenly he was sitting at a table for two in the middle of nowhere. Literal nowhere. And across the table from him, smiling wide, was Sam.
Castiel.
“You’re a little bitch but you’re also the best brother ever,” Dean told him matter-of-factly as the treehouse came into view.
Dean closed his eyes tight, breathing heavy. "Take care of him for me," he whispered.
Naomi, of course, erased most of this from my memories.
"I'm done underestimating you humans. Your brother says he's going to get you out — well. I believe him. I am getting out as well, and the only thing
Castiel kissed the top of his head, thumb stroking Dean’s naked back slowly. “Yes and no.”
“Our dice suck.”
"Already on it," Claire said, running into the hall. "Charlie!" she yelled out. "Wanna come watch some movies?!"

Castiel paused. “Valid point.”
Dean punched him in the jaw, and Michael laughed.
"I am
Bobby pointed his beer at Gabriel and Rowena. "What about them two? They ain't future Winchesters?"
“It’s about time, eh? And Claire's grown up a lot, too."
"Ye've got…" Rowena pointed to Gabe's mouth. "Ye've got my lipstick on yer mouth."
Castiel didn’t watch the movie. He buried his face in Dean’s chest and thanked the universe for letting him have this.
This just ain't livin'
I will not kiss you (kiss you)
she whispered.
"You know, if we had conversed like this on shore, this situation might not have ever happened."
“Charlie, Charlie c’mon
"Gotta go!" Maggie said before the call cut out.
Want to see life
There was a darkness to the room, an ominous, nameless horror.
"Shut the fuck up and just take your damn seconds."
"The lot of ye, I swear," Rowena cursed under her breath. "I expect a full report on what happened since the last time I was here, Samuel." She eyed him, and the rust smeared across his face. "But later. Perhaps, for now, we should all eat?"
If I had one, I'd be there now. One last bit of earthly comfort and whatnot. But I'm here, at my desk, with my bags packed for Mom's behind me.
"Just making sure you're okay," Gabriel told him, leaving the room.
Dean shook his head and looked back to his phone. “I’m… scared,” he admitted, memories of a room of corpses coming back to his head. “I know he’s just trying to help but I don’t— I don’t know that I deserve to be saved.”
"It's a
“Claire loves you. Maggie loves you.”
"Hmm. What's that?"
And Dean couldn't look at a little kid and say, 'You're old enough to take care of yourself,' so he didn't.
"Sam. Sam!" Dean looked around from his seat on the floor, finding himself alone. "Dammit, Sammy."
Dean glanced around for anyone else, but it seemed they were alone.
Rowena and Gabriel were at his side immediately.
like you! She's
Donna yawned in the kitchen.
They took off into the cosmos for the afternoon, leaving all worry behind.
“You should be able to breathe fine now,” Cas told him, nose brushing as he nodded resolutely.
Sam shook his head. "I keep thinking that if I just look one more time I'll find something I haven't yet."
"You're stronger than this."
“Is praying actually gonna do us any good?”
"Hey, Cas," Dean said, stretching. "What's your favorite thing about humans?"
Cas cleared his throat, glad Dean couldn't see his blush. "And you're aware that we can never um,
And it was the most awe-inspiring thing Dean had ever seen.
“Take you, Dean…”
He winked. “More than met him.” All the blood left his face as his brain caught up with his mouth.
was gone.
She shouldered him playfully. "Sap. What about you? Got any plans for the future?"
one day?”
Dean tugged on the door. "I really, really want to see Castiel."
Claire’s head shot up. “What is that?” she asked, feeling like her entire body was covered in sewage.
Donna bumped Jody with her hip. "Maybe, but we're doin' it together."
"Alright, Teddy Bear."
if he was honest. Castiel tasted like war, like deathly heat and gunpowder and metal. He was reminded jarringly that this wasn’t just
Gabriel said, eyebrows raised. “I don’t recall you ever asking
Dean pulled back, eyebrow raised. “Don’t tell me you cry all over me you big sap.”
“He loves me,” Michael responded, and the voice was small and uncertain. It was… child-like. “He’s my father, and He loves me.”
Jody grinned at him. “You’re a good man, Sam. We love you. Don’t forget that.”
And Dean was laughing underwater, lungs filling with liquid as he held Castiel close.
"Jody was kind of our mom when uh, Mom wasn't here. I don't want her getting hurt."
"Opening it?"
"We've been busy."
When is the last time any of ye
“I wish. Fucking time travel, dimension travel. So much bullshit here.”
Dean sucked in air through his teeth, hands going to his head. "What the fuck—"
“What are you building?” Maggie asked, disentangling herself.
Sam saw her and promptly tripped over a tree root.
Dean turned around to see Sam, sitting at that damned table again. “So…” Sam started.
Castiel sat beside him. “The past is the past.”
"I'm not the king of Hell," Sam responded curtly. "Where did all the souls go?"
"You're Apollo! You're a god!
Gabriel grinned, kissing her again. "Perfect."

“Fuck fuck fuck fuck,” Dean stammered, legs shaking where they gripped tight to Castiel.

I wasn't meant to make friends. I was to go down and help win the war.
I laid down my spear.
“You’re getting there, anyway.”
Cas huffed and looked absently at the bees he had carved.
There were no more words, so Gabriel sighed and went back to the pool, sitting at the edge.
"Awful. Terrible. 0/10. How about we go get food?"
Cas did not reply, and Dean nudged him gently.
Maggie walked up behind Gabriel, covering his mouth with her hand sloppily. "Keep it in your pants, Gabey," she slurred, leaning against him.
Gabriel pitched another.
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean raised an eyebrow. "Well, now I have even more questions."
Dean clamped his mouth shut.
"Jack, why don't you fly on up there and roost?" Claire teased him.
It was a rush for him, I think, to pretend he was God. Like a child in his father's shoes and coat. Too big on him, but very cute, nonetheless.
"Bad dream?" he asked, handing her a donut and some coffee.
"It's okay, I should've looked at the screens more. I was just so excited that I— it doesn't matter. What's done is done."
Rowena smirked. “Can’t imagine that. Though, I’ve got to ask… Why do ye even have that?”
Dean yelled, fist colliding with Michael’s jaw. “Why are you so fucking hellbent on keeping me away from Castiel?!”
"Wait, wha—"
Michael grabbed his face, pulled it in close. “I
Cas shuddered at the weight of the beginning. It wasn’t a salutation. It was a statement.
"Maybe I want you to." Dean's heart was racing. He needed to stop. He needed to stop
"I know. I'm kinda hoping we get Dean and Cas back and I don't have to progress any further."
"He whispered to Sam in— well, it was an old language we made up when we were kids."
"You really want to?"
Sam yawned on his shoulder a while later, sitting up in his lap. "Dean?" he asked.
Dean sucked in a shuddering breath, hands held out as if they were covered in blood. "I don't... I don't know."
Jack looked at him with wide, red-rimmed eyes. “What?”
Mary sighed. “We’re gonna have to hunt him down again, aren’t we?”
Dean's free hand rested on his hip.
Sam leaned back against the counter. "It's just a long story, and you've had a crazy day, I'm sure. We can go over it later."
"And where's that?"
“I can’t,” Castiel told him softly. “But we can go to the lake together.”
Claire laid the book face-down, pages open and got out of the comfy chair. "Where are we going?" she called after Charlie.
"And I get that that probably makes me a terrible person, but the thought that maybe I didn't have to really exist in the world and couldn't cause any more problems just… gave me some peace. Like this. I don't really exist in the world anymore."
When Charlie landed a hit on Claire's sternum, it was Sam bossing her around.
"Are you really gonna leave?"
bunting. It's just a bunting. Common little shits."
"What?"
Dean shrugged. “I dunno, man. Angels are weird.” He pointed to Fergus, who was sitting beside Castiel. “So are you in charge of him now?”
But you did
"Name it," he would say to me, flying lazy circles around the newest heavenly body.
"Very funny. You know what I meant."
“Dean,” Castiel breathed, afraid to wake from whatever beautiful dream he was having.
Gabriel turned on his side, head pillowed against his arm. "I don't know what you're asking."
"The borders. Heaven. Allowing those already there to come back to Earth sometimes, if they want to."
"Talk."
Or run for your life?
voice in my head telling me not to hurt you? Why do I
They were not the only ones whispering among themselves. It seemed as though everyone was either in agreement or willing to give the plan a shot. However, to avoid becoming what they had just managed to escape, everyone had to talk.
“He called me Dad…”
"I feel content," Dean mumbled, catching Cas's lips with his own briefly. "There's nothing I have to do down here. There's none of the stress that was always on my mind outside the water. Anything I could be stressed about doesn't matter, because I can't do anything here. It's… freeing."
It was later.
I thought we could handle it, but the kitchen incident just proves that we can't. Claire got hurt. Like,
Michael screamed, throwing Dean across the room, crashing him into bookshelves that rained down heavy volumes onto him. “I’ve already told you! You
I'd keep you safe
“Castiel,” Sam breathed. “I didn’t… I never thought that I would…”
I pulled you out of Hell once, Dean. I can do it again.”
Castiel told them to run, to let him fend off the enemy.
There was static in the air. “Gabriel?”
“It’s… a mess that I would have to use grace to clean up. Which I don’t necessarily have an infinite amount of.”
"It's been a bit, dude. They stopped making mine."
Ahem. Anyways.
“I’m currently working on learning the curve of your mouth, so we can come back to that in a bit,” Dean breathed out, leaning forward to capture his lips again.
Dean didn't know anymore.
I just legit couldn't wait to post this one so enjoy
Castiel looked at all the wires, the tubes, the monitors. “I… I knew he had been obsessed but… this is…” He looked at the table for two in the middle of the room. “I don’t have words.”
All the patience, all the yearning, all thrown back in his fucking face with this… this
They were the tears of never getting to say goodbye.
“You wanted to know about fate,” Cas prompted, pulling back just slightly.
“Like you said, you’re family,” Dean told him. “And we don’t leave family behind.”
Title from "Flies on the Butter (You Can't Go Home)" by the Judds
Castiel stood up quickly. “Yes. It is. How many souls left?”
“Bones and fleshy bits, that’s me. Human to the core.”
Castiel laughed softly before relinquishing himself to Dean’s mouth.
"And ye've got dried blood all over ye. But no wounds, it seems. Angels are an odd bunch, I'll say."
Sam looked at the slide under a microscope, sighing heavily.
"We waited
Dean listened to the soft noise around them. Echoes of some far-off creature, the occasional light
“Eh…” Charlie punched a few keys. “Hopefully this is right after your first visit. But it may be somewhere around the fourth. It’s really hard to tell. His mental signature only lines up sometimes, and time works differently in infinite contexts.”
"I mean we kinda like. Held hands a little? And he played with my hair. I dunno, the whole dynamic is different than I'm used to."
Dean didn't even reach up to pry Michael's hands loose. He kept his own hands pressed to his chest, hiding Castiel's memory from this hell. "Michael,
"Sam has had enough," Mary said, laughing as she took the drink and gave it to Bobby.
"Okay, George."
Maggie shrugged. "I guess we'll stay here. Maybe one day we'll move. The future is—" she waved her hand in the air, "— unwritten."

Jody worked on drilling pilot holes for the screws. “The Bobby from our world practically raised Sam and Dean. It’s kind of interesting meeting another version of you.”
“Michael,” Dean commanded, forcing him to meet his eyes again. “God doesn’t care about any of us.”

Dean fumbled his free hand around for something,
“Nope, nuh-uh. We’re married. You married into my three million dollar tax debt. Live with it.”
Sam flashed her a grin. "Meet ya there!"
Dean kissed his hair, then his forehead, his nose, his lips. “Not quite tired yet,” he whispered. “How about a movie?”
Who told me you came back to the Bunker alone. Who told me Dean was too fast for us. Who told me my son was gone.
Bobby went about attaching nuts to the back. “Did your Bobby get you into the hunting game?”
"Are you just doing this to get back in our graces?"
He felt fevered, delusional. He didn't know where he was going, simply that he
She could hear his feet running down the hall and wished he was strong enough to fly. He rounded the corner quickly, coming to a halt inside the door.
"Please," Dean pleaded. "It's the only beautiful thing left here. Say it again."
“I can drink to that.” Sam cleared his throat. “Initiating countdown?”
Jack turned around to face him, stopping in his tracks to see Gabriel sitting cross-legged at his feet.
Or the cow that hopped the planets, while straddling a spoon
“Oh, what’s that?” Gabriel snarled, rising in his chair. “You’re

"And Heathcliff didn't deserve as resonant a line as that."
Castiel was adjusting his tie in the mirror, wishing that Dean was there to do it for him. He missed Dean more than he could articulate, more than he could fathom. Every waking moment for a very long time, Dean had been right there. And now there was a hole in Castiel’s world.
“Definitely. It’s always nice to see everyone again.” Claire smushed her face against Maggie’s stomach. “Mary looks like she’s due any day now.”
Gabe gave him a soft smile. "Hey. I'll protect you. Just like old times."
(See the end of the chapter for

He tried. He really,
Sam’s head dropped. “Oh, thank Amara,” he mumbled.
Gabe raised an eyebrow. “It is. I don’t see what that has to do with anything, though.”
Okay so, you gotta understand. Sam was the dorkiest fucking kid you've ever seen. He carried around these big-ass books and he'd actually

“Sure it is! The cupcake phase! Where every couple is all cuddly and lovey-dovey and shit. The beginning of almost any relationship.”
"So we…" Maggie hid her face. "We got rid of Hell. And Purgatory."
Castiel looked at Sam’s smile, his relieved aura. “It’s… cold.”
"There's no light, no light in the sky
Jack reached down and grabbed an abandoned ball, throwing it as hard as he could into the woods.
“I do not deserve your kindness. I have done nothing but cause you grief. I

go dressed like that.”
Slowly, Dean's muscles unwound, his hands coming up to ghost against Castiel's waist, body melting against Cas's. "Okay."
"M fine," Sam said, grinning and leaning his head back against the plush chair they had dragged in.
Dean hooked a leg around Castiel, pulling him flush against him. "I even tried to teach you about personal space!"
“We were building your room right next to mine, just in case you ever missed me in the night and decided to come snuggle.”
“Gimme a minute. It’s hard to lock onto his mental signature.”
So they took me out for milkshakes.
Castiel sighed, looking around Dean's old room. There were people outside, family who loved them and missed them.
Neither moved for a moment.
The best part of the day, by far, was baseball.
I was just a kid
That keeps us star gazing
“Hey, hey. Shh, I’m here. It’s okay,” Dean said softly as he tried to pull Castiel away from every bad thought in his head.
Dean was breathing hard, palms pressed against his eyes. “R-remember,”
"Ye have every right to be sad," she told him. "It's hard to lose someone ye love."
“Why wasn’t I good enough?”

Charlie pursed her lips. “Uhhh…. Sure? We can go with that.”
When she punched in those numbers, the jukebox swung open, revealing a long hall.
In a forest lake, Sam put a worried hand over his heart.
Bobby looked up at her. “I’m sorry to hear that.” He went back to his job. “I remember that. My wife came back, too. That wasn’t too long before the Apocalypse happened.”
"That's the most times I've heard you say 'love' that weren't about food."
Sam jumped, immediately on edge. “What? What happened? What’s wrong?!”
"Who else?"
“Do we even have a place here anymore? I know they’d all say so, but…” Dean trailed off, feeling suddenly vulnerable and unsure.
“Sounds like you had a fun Midsummer’s Night.”
"NO! I want you to—" Dean's shoulders dropped, the anger punched out in a sigh. "I want you to be happy. And this ain't it, chief."
“Ancient things?”
"Dean used to tell me that story late at night, when we were waiting up on Dad to come home. He was always — He's exceptionally good at stories, isn't he?"
Sam frowned. "Uh, no. That was us. We rescued him."
'Elo', btw, is Enochian for 'God'
Sam shrugged one shoulder, and then the other. “So… don’t call you, then, is what you’re saying?”
if there's no one beside you
"This is not what I intended
"You're very cute. Do you wanna do something later?"
"Yeah, I figured. You might wanna do that."
Sam smiled. “Good. Dean was… really glad to see me. He actually cried a little. Is everything else ready?”
"And what's your excuse for Claire, then?"
Sam huffed. "Considering you're impeding your own rescue, I'd say 'pretty damn'." He cleared his throat. "But uh, ya know, congrats. It's about time, really, and I'm so glad you two could talk things out."
to go.
Castiel looked at the constellations Dean had carved in the coffin lid. “Humans call it time. Your perception is so small. You think it moves in one direction, and you think it controls everything, that it wilts and decays you. It does not. What you call time is actually more accurately called
and called
"I know."
"Sleep, then. I'll be okay without you for a while."
Dean rolled his eyes and put his wrists against his head, hands spread out wide.
Fergus motioned to himself. "I'm human," he said as if it explained everything. "Hell is— well, Hell is gone, as far as any of us can tell. Which means no one knows what happens to…
Dean smiled, shoving Cas playfully before settling back down. "Not gonna say I don't wanna bone you, Cas, because I do. But it's… not as big a deal as it once was, I guess. And I'm sure I'll be tempted to make it super gross in here sometimes but… do you know how
Dean regarded Sam for a while. “I think I believe you.”
"You wanna know how I kissed
"They have a blue head, dark but not muted. Their belly is red, and their wings are marbled green and purple and softer, un-nameable colors."
"Of course. Be safe, Claire."
one.”
Claire kicked Sam in the leg from her place in Maggie’s lap. “Hey, move your ass! I’m enjoying this!”
Dean looked up at him with wide eyes, pleading.
off of me!"
“Why do I know that you smell like ozone? Or that you wear the same size shoe as me? Why do I know that your hair is dark? That you like guinea pigs? That losing you would be the worst thing that could happen to me?” The earth shifted around them, and Dean was pushing Castiel roughly against the wall. “Why do I hear my own
Lucifer, right? Not… Satan?"
Dean growled at him, eyes blazing. "So what?"
Michael's eyes met Dean's and, for the first time, Dean saw fear there. "Then I'm a monster,” he whispered.
"So."
"Relax, Dean. I expect nothing of you."
Maggie watched her fiance with a loving expression. “We’ve talked about it,” Maggie said softly. “We’re not ready just yet but… someday, maybe. If we find the right troubled teen.”
He dialed a familiar number, holding his breath as it rang.
So, tell me
Castiel stretched one giant wing out over Sam, shielding him from the rain. “Yes.”
He immediately groaned. “Dear god, please no.”
“Would you have believed me?!”
Because tonight will be the night
They pulled up a while later at a bar.
"No. You're much more important than God."
Dean let out a sigh of relief. “Okay. Good.”
This is goodbye.
"Claire did that one," Gabriel explained quietly.
But now nothing but the water
"Who is Dean Winchester without his Cas?" Dean joked, biting his tongue in the process. "Sorry. I... missed you."
Dean's lips were soft, unbelievably soft, as they parted against Castiel's.
"I was thinking about deer."
"What's so special about lately?"
“Oh yeah, baby. We are ready to go.”
"Where did he go?"
He took in the biggest breath of his life. His lungs ached with the force of holding it.
"Something not as lame."
Didn't say goodbye, now I'm frozen in time
Sam rested his cheek on Gabriel's head. "Yeah? He's a good kid."
"Down the streets I walked with you
Cas smiled, softly running his hands across Dean's back. "That so?"
Gabriel kept twitching his ears as he doodled, sometimes frowning, sometimes rolling his eyes.
Castiel snapped.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat.
It… You have to understand. I thought… I was told I was doing God’s work. I still don’t know if that’s true. I’m not sure that it is, anymore.
Dean spit blood out of his mouth, grinning. “You were never gonna kill God.”
"There's so much backstabbing," Dean whispered to no one in particular as he watched his two favorite mom blogs duke it out.
“So terrible things could be lurking out there in the dark and you’d have no idea.”
“Did the angels ever sing?” Dean asked, eyes half-lidded.
“Blame myself? For my own son thinking he had no other choice than to lock himself away? I did. For the longest time I did.” Mary sighed, resting her head in her hands. “But it wasn’t my fault. I know that now. There’s nothing I could’ve done.” She met Sam’s eyes, and there was something lovely in that gaze. “And I know now that you were having the roughest year of your life. And that I didn’t pick up the phone either. And maybe this all is just proof that we need to work on our relationship. I’m having a baby soon, Sam. I haven’t even had them check to see what it is. I want you and I to be okay. I want this kid to have a normal life.”
Charlie snorted, opening her backpack to reveal a sleeping bag of her own. "What's the tent situation like, guys?"
Sam looked up from his work when Gabriel walked into his room.
Maggie's lips were soft and sweet, and they tasted like new beginnings.
And there was a mental image of a lake, of Castiel disappearing beneath the waters, of a drenched trench coat.
When Castiel pulled a demon knife out, Dean saw the desperation in his eyes, the trust, and knew this was no last-night-on-earth fling.
why doesn't he come down and smite the ever-loving fuck out of you?"
Sam’s eyes followed her hands, to the pristine pool filled with clear water, covered in—
For love, for dreams in the night
Sam found himself unable to look away from the two young, smiling boys on the wall. “Headed out?” he repeated. “Where are you going?”
Dreams are often made of memories, as this one was. She remembered sobbing, and texting Dean.
"Mm. That's a sad story."
"Rowena. I need a spell."
"Impressive," he said, trying to keep his voice level. "Where did you learn that?"
how hard it is to move on when your dead father comes to visit you? When you can see his face but it's not— it's not him, right? He's not going to sing you another lullaby. He's not going to give you a hug when you make a good grade. He's not going to ground you for acting out. He's just a fucking stone-faced angelic tax collector. It's not him." Claire took a shivering breath. "But it's his face. And it's his voice, kinda. And sometimes it still acts a bit like him, and for half a second you forget that your dad is dead, because he's standing right there in front of you. And you want everything to be okay again, and you think it is, but then the veil lifts and it's all fucked ten ways to Tuesday again. But you can't forget. Because if you forget… then there's nothing left of him."
Just to spend them with you"
Dean snorted, tasting blood at the back of his throat. “Yeah, sure. ‘Kill’ God.”
Dean’s hands hovered over Castiel’s hips, unsure.
“Afraid not, Sam. An’ I can’t send ye on supplies runs, either. Ah, hello, Gabriel.”
"All my agony
“How can—” Jack’s voice cracked. “How can these all be the same thing?”
She wanted to ask if he was broken inside, if he was angry, if he called Cas to ask for help. If he called Cas again. And again. And again.
"Can we skip the wholesome episodes?"
“Yeah? How’s he doin’ this morning?”
Michael stared curiously at Castiel, wings tucked loosely against his back.
He chuckled. “I think I can manage to get us there.”
Gabriel smirked. "Plus it's a girl."
Claire adamantly refused to look at the gathered crowd, at Donna taking a video on a
Gabriel would flap his wings once, mightily, and send the clouds cascading in every direction, swirling and creating new forms and shapes. We would name them as we saw them, as nothing was named yet.

“What do
"Four hours, I'm sure," Rowena cut him off. "But ye can thank those feathery beasts over there for that. I imagine Jack will remain half-asleep until we find a way to put those back on the plane they came from."
Michael paused. “Wait—”
"Make up your mind."
"Yeah," Maggie agreed. "Should we—"
Maggie offered up a smile. "We should have a Bunker prom."
He examined his nails in awe. “What’s the ace one look like?”
“I’m excited,” he whispered to her. “Have you decided on any names?”
So, Sam had kept it under wraps. He didn’t really want to celebrate. It felt somber. It felt… dead.
"I think you'd better watch your fusing mouth."
Charlie pressed a few buttons and turned to look at Donna fully. “I know. And I don’t know. I guess we’ll all have to regain his trust, tell him our stories. But Castiel will help us too, I’m sure.”
"We're camping," Claire told Jody firmly.
Cas laughed, shaking his head. “Then we shall both change clothes and be ready for a wedding.”
Dean was starting to accept the fact that he was likely stuck here indefinitely, under some new torture or another. Stuck in some small box with a demon. See who breaks first.
"Dean!"
Dean jumped, trying to push Michael off his lap.
"Do you ever feel heavy?"
Dean was thinking of Sam.
Sam hid his smile. “Yeah? Well, what if I asked Gabriel out, too?”
"And do not speak my name. We are not
Castiel ducked his head.
The cries increased in force, past the point of yelling, past the point of screaming. "
“What a horrible villain name. That’s like… gay-neighbor-next-door name. Manager name. Not
“We can be friends, if you’d like,” Dean offered, well-aware that shoving down his feelings for Cas would be even harder than it once was, with the memory of honey and moonshine still dancing on his tastebuds from chapped lips and roaming tongue.
Sam's hand went over Dean's mouth. "Hey, hey. It's okay. Don't try to talk. You've been down there for three years, Dean. Dean. Dean," Sam trailed off, saying Dean's name like it was a word once forbidden, like he couldn't believe it.
“So still no clue how long it’s been for him?”
I was a careless child. I did not watch where I stepped. I rarely looked down at all. My head was held high, always turned towards my creator.
I’ll see that you don’t get wet
PS: You once asked me what being a hunter ever gave me. It gave me you.
Castiel slipped the ring on, beaming. “We’re married now. I think that means it’s mine, too.”
Jody shook her head good-naturedly. “Then I pronounce you Mr. and Mr. Castiel Winchester. I would say ‘kiss the groom’ but… you two have that covered.”
"You don't know? You're telling me you've been alive for what you're claiming are millennia, and you've never once sat down and thunk it out?"
"I can. Here's Castiel rebelling for you." Smash.
And Dean was much too far gone to argue, and if Heaven itself said he was beautiful, then it must be so. “I love you too,” he managed around the gasps that threatened to replace his vocabulary. “I sh-should’ve followed you.”
I'm just thinkin' all these thoughts up in my mind
Charlie mussed her hair as she passed. "Unfortunate."
“Because y’all are family,” he said decisively. “And y’all need me.”
And he
“You guys showered without me?”
"Am I the last of my kind?
“Very well. Then your services will no longer be required. Leave Heaven. Feel free to return if you have a change of heart.”
And I just hope you know
“I did, too. And he loved you. So, so much. He loved you so much, Jack. But he knew Sam would love you the same, too.”
"Dad?"
"Where— Where's Cas?" Dean asked, looking around the room. He wanted to see Castiel. He wanted to hold him tight and never let him go.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah. After this.”
Maggie turned the bird to face her, frowning. "Are you a girl or a guy? One cluck for girl, two for guy, three for fuck you."
There was a low rumble, like Cas was about to say something but then thought better of it.
The next ball was slower. “Interesting.”
I can’t forgive myself for that. For what I did. Innocent people, Dean. They were just…
(See the end of the chapter for
He wanted to scream, again, again, until Dean woke up and remembered him.
"Donna's kitchen," she said softly. Sam's hand faltered on cracking an egg before she continued. "He was making breakfast for us, and he flipped the pancake like this. And I told him he was a show-off, so he did that stupid grin and asked me if I wanted to learn how. I said yeah."
"Good idea!" Jack scooted out the door to the hallway. "Keep that child warm!"
itself.
I know I don't say it often, but I'm proud of you.
Raphael nodded back at him. “The final topic to discuss is Hell, but it seems we have no former demons here.”
Jack nodded to himself, going back to watching her paint his nails.
in you? Who would have noticed you weren’t okay
But Sam rocked Jack in his lap, head buried in his shoulder as he sobbed, and sobbed, and sobbed,
"You... I'm sorry?"
His eyes flicked black, green, black. “Cas,” he begged.
"Thine? Mine what?" Maggie questioned, slicing at him with the branch.
They peeled out of the garage ridiculously fast, Claire's hair whipping out the bottom of the helmet, the wind bitterly cold on her arms.
