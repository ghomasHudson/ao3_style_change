Sam digs his grubby fingers into the bowl of chopped ham left on the counter, and he’s really fucking lucky Dean’s pretty much done with his and Cas’s own ham and cheddars because come
Dean thinks, and dives into the kiss with everything he’s got, hand coming up to knock that stupid navy cap away and get a hand in Cas’s hair. Cas gives as good as he gets, one hand curving around Dean’s cheek as the other grabs at Dean’s thigh, barely above the knee but startling a moan from him just the same.
” He cocks a hip to lean against the front counter, the boy’s characteristic brazenness beginning to fade as he studies Castiel, a thread of concern entering his gaze. “You okay?”
sorrow; the luxury of ignorance afforded to those who live the civilian life, Marine father or no. Dean reaches over and writes,
Cas looks down again at his hand. He thinks of Dean batting it away, a wild look in his eyes. Perhaps, and he settles in the misery of it, perhaps Dean had been afraid of him. It had only been the two of them in that field, and unless Dean had developed a sudden aversion to wildflowers and grass, Cas was the only thing there to fear. It’s an absurd thought, but Cas has no other explanation.
Cas says, “Dean.” Again, he uses Dean’s name like it’s a whole sentence, like it’s a sentence worth saying. Dean closes his eyes like that would somehow affect his hearing.
Dean doesn’t get it, but Dean doesn’t have to get it. He just has to listen to it, and appreciate it, and respect it.
Dean’s an hour into the drive when he realizes he didn’t ever actually text Eileen. It takes two before, leaning over a gas pump, he realises he never said goodbye to Cas. He hovers over Eileen’s name in his phone — surely that should be easier than figuring out what to say to Cas — but now that he’s out on the road, he’s struggling. He doesn’t want Eileen to assume that he doesn’t think she can handle the hunt. Still, he needs this hunt. He can’t go back to the bunker.
“Oh, I get it!” Jack exclaimed and Dean wasn't listening. He was very interested in a stain he’d discovered. Probably going to need to bleach the counter. “It's like another love language!” and Dean snorted, because the kid was right, but also because the conversation where Jack had discovered love languages had been hilarious, as was the ensuing chaos.
Castiel shoots him a deeply unimpressed look, which has an exponentially more powerful effect at this short of a range. Dean feels the strange urge to tug at the edges of Cas’s dark hair, just where it peels off of his neck, to do anything to wipe the vaguely irritated look off of his face. Push it into real irritation. Get him to swing.
It would be easier. But Cas never asks. He never sinks his hands into Dean’s chest, just curls soft fingers into Dean's hands or cups them around Dean’s cheek. It’s Dean who sways into Cas’s grip, whose hands linger for extra seconds. If he was more whole, he could give that to Cas, and then, at least, he’d know that Cas was getting something out of this.
No. Wait, no. He's not going to do that. There isn't going to be a next time. Cas isn't going to keep making mixtapes for him.
Cas had also asked Dean not to get in the box. Cas had also searched for a cure for the Mark. Cas apparently wanted Dean to live — that was the only thing he asked for.
Dean grimaces. “Yeah. Big, ugly, monster dogs — but basically look like dogs.” Face carefully devoid of any discernible emotion besides mild curiosity, he continues. “You don’t know what hellhounds look like?”
She untangles herself from his arms, dabbing under her eyes like she’s correcting makeup she’s forgotten she’s not wearing. “Thanks,” she says with a watery smile.
Dean can't make himself say, “Of course. I'd listen to anything you'd give me.” He can't make himself say, “This may be the nicest thing someone’s ever done for me without the world being in the balance.” And he definitely can't make himself say, “Hey, so I love you, and you love me, why don't you just come to my room and stay and stay and stay?” He's firmly ignoring the part of him that's cheekily suggesting, “Hey, so I know the cure for love starvation.”
It’s angry. Fast. Loud enough to drown everything out. Dean is briefly grateful before the battery begins.
Cas frowns down at the table. It’s their first fight as a couple, and he’s not even sure what they're fighting about.
Eileen is overcome with a rush of affection for Dean, colored with a strange sadness. The tension she’d felt before vanishes completely. Sam and Cas were right. Dean is a good man.
Sam's a better person than Dean. Cas, too. Either one of them would know what to do here. But Jack doesn't have anyone else here. He just has Dean. So, Dean says what he wishes someone had said to him and hopes that it's okay.
Dean stares into the chili and frowns. Cas seems happy enough with the way things are, and it’s not like Dean’s going to start busting out something like
Okay, that’s not entirely true. It’s clearly a mixtape: the same dark cassette style, the same clear cover with a paper stuffed in the slot, the same rawboned script listing track titles and artists. There’s an additional paper in the back slot that wasn’t with the previous two mixes. It has writing on it, very small and very nonsensical, but that's a minor enough difference that Dean is ignoring it for now. He pops open the plastic cover on the cassette and, yup, the cassette even has the same writing on it.
, who clawed some sort of real happiness out of all of this and doesn’t need to listen to Dean whine about a relationship that he may or may not be in.
Okay. Fantastic. This isn't a romantic mixtape — it's just music that Castiel likes. Stuff that makes him think about what they've been through. That's good. That's a relief. Dean sips his coffee and rewinds the song one more time so he can just…enjoy it without panic. It's catchy.
Dean’s mind fills in everything he’s looked up about her, every time he checked to make sure that she was okay. Married 5 years ago, no kids (which he remembers from late night conversations — Cassie never wanted children, and Dean never wanted to bring a kid up in the world he lived in. He’s not surprised that she never changed her mind). She won an award about 2 years ago for a series she did exposing scandals in the private prison system. Her mom passed away 3 years ago, but Cassie is still vibrantly, brilliantly alive.
In the hunting community, the Winchesters have a reputation for being master tacticians. Dean in particular has the reputation of making the tough calls and getting crews out alive, while still getting the job done.
He puts the nachos in the oven, grabs a beer from the fridge, and leans against the counter to look at Cas’s note: “6. DDU-DU DDU-DU by BLACKPINK.” Weirdly, Dean could have guessed that. The other says, “6. Justifiable arrogance.”
It's a lovely song, Dean thinks, because he’s capable of objective thoughts, and then he thinks it's a terrible song, because Dean doesn’t want it.
He taps out lyrics clumsily on his phone so he can figure out what songs he wants to listen to later, basically transcribing half of the next song on the set list until he realises he’s probably just going to want to listen to all of it.
God, is Cas being so weird because he thinks Dean is gonna throw him out? Dean can’t blame him, but Cas has a place here as long as he wants it. Even if he doesn’t want it, the room will always be there.
None of this is the problem. This is the third mixtape that Cas has given him, and Dean is good at rolling with the punches. He can adjust to new circumstances. Dean is good with change. Hates it, but he’s good with it.
Dean thinks it's the fact that he’s so prepared for the worst that it takes him a full second to actually hear what Sam says. In those seconds, Sam works himself into a panic.
The grocery stores might not be open when he gets there, but it’s better than being here. Better than opening his mouth to let blood and dust spill out.
“I’m fine, Sam. Just —” Cas has no reason to lie. Sam has always been a good man, and he knows Dean the best of all. Perhaps he can help. “I am thinking about Dean.”
Cas supposes that's the problem at its core. Dean makes him feel, swiftly and intensely. At the beginning, it had been terrifying — the rush of confusion when he glanced at his charge, how looking in Dean’s eyes tugged at something in his chest. Then, it’d been exhilarating — an addiction. Over time, it had softened, not such that the feeling became less intense, but such that Cas grew accustomed to its intensity, almost comforted by its familiarity.
“Castiel and I had a long talk, once we set up heaven.” Again, Dean really should query what 'set up heaven is,' but when he had opened his mouth, Sam had sent him the biggest fucking bitch face, which basically screamed 'Priorities, Dean,' and Dean's not so dumb that he can't tell when Sammy is right about something. “And I was talking to my mom and Mary, y'know, because I wanted everyone's opinion! And I'm proud of what we did in heaven, but I wasn't uh…I wasn't happy. 'Specially once it was done. There wasn't much to do but minor fixes and checking on people, and it was nice! It was really nice to talk to people, but I wasn't happy.”
Cassie says, “You got married? That’s wonderful!” She sounds genuinely happy for him, so Dean shoots Powerpuff Hunter Barbie a glare and commits to it.
Jack and Cas had been persona-non-grata in the bunker, because even when Sammy tried to bring them up, Dean had felt his windpipe close and his mind roar with white noise. They didn't talk about Jack and Cas. They didn't. Dean couldn't.
Cas had also carefully explained that Jack was allowed to be angry at Dean, to be hurt by what Dean had done, to need Dean to say things more explicitly.
It’s not that Dean is blind. He knows Cas is not a perfect person. He knows Cas struggles with feeling weak and directionless at times. He knows Cas once had regrets, decisions he wasn’t proud of. He just didn’t think Cas
But here is the thing. Cas said it was music that made him think of Dean. Cas is in love with Dean, and Cas made a tape of music that made him think of Dean.
Eileen has plenty of friends. Some civilians she keeps in touch with, a few hunters she checks on regularly. She’s never had friends the way Sam and Dean seem to though, people they pull into their orbit, who they weave into the fabric of their universe.
‘Hey, can I —’ no, wait. Probably better to go with ‘hey, I’m gonna —’ no, wait. He has to let her know she can say no.
You can take the kid out of Law School, but apparently you can’t take Objection, Relevance? out of the kid.
“Can I show you something?” he offers, once Jack's breathing returns to normal. Jack's curiosity appears to conquer his desire to stab an emotional knife into Dean's chest because he reproduces Cas's exact quizzical head tilt and says “Sure?” in a voice that's all Jack.
Dean sneaking flowers into Cas’s coat. Dean cooking for Cas, smiling softly at him, nudging his shoulders to point out funny things on the TV. Dean shattering the plastic dividers of the gun range, deploying harsh words at his loved ones, harsher ones at himself. Dean pushing Sam out of the way on hunts, Dean refusing to let Cas heal him after Cas cracked his zygomatic bone with his own fists. Dean taking Jack on drives, on fishing trips, Dean explaining in soft tones what he knows. Dean with his gun in Jack’s face. Dean mourning Jack’s death. Dean taking Claire and Kaia to a concert so they’d feel safe. Dean never feeling safe with anyone else.
Dean’s hand reaches out, searching for purchase and landing on Baby’s hood. He’s still in the garage. He hasn’t moved. He hasn’t run. He’s in the bunker. He’s in the bunker.
. He sloughs off the anxiety, the confusion, and everything else to focus on what's in front of him.
Dean actually can't think about Cas making the tape. His mind jumps away from that thought like it’s red hot and could burn him.
Dean hadn’t minded being the monster that he was when it meant that he was strong enough to put down greater evils. These days, the fact that he put that gun down is sometimes his only reminder that he has a chance to change.
He’s not surprised at all by the tonal shift as the song ticks over, having grown accustomed to Cas’s disregard of genre, beat, and sometimes even volume as the songs came through from the last track. The female lyricist’s voice is light and pleasant on this one, and it becomes readily apparent that this is another love song.
Dean’s never told anyone this, but some people don’t make it off the rack. Not every spirit who goes to Hell becomes a demon. Some souls simply break and fade from the torture.
His heart was in his throat when he’d touched down in the field, full of fear, angel blade in hand. He’d been prepared to fight off whatever poor idiot had caught Dean unawares, but there was no one there.
Dean sighs. It's a long breath expelled more than anything else. “Because, Jack. I want you to understand. I've made mistakes. Big mistakes. Mistakes bigger than you could even imagine. But, Sam and Cas — ” he falters here, but plows on because this isn't about him. It's just not. “Sam and Cas, they still need me, and they forgive me. Just like we still need you.”
Dean wakes up the next morning with the sun — a quick way to orient himself to ‘not in the bunker’ — and he catches an hour of silence before anyone else even plays with rising. The first thing he does is grab the walkman from where he had abandoned it in the passenger seat. He slings the headphones around his neck but doesn’t hit play.
“Oh, good. Wouldn’t want you to be not good.” Dean says, because who the fuck cares about words right now? Cas is blushing. Cas’s cheeks are dusted red, and his eyes are bright, and he’s smiling, and Dean is going to spend the rest of his life figuring out how to make that happen again.
Dean hears the thrumming beat of the music, thinks briefly about Castiel seducing him in other ways, and gets to Cas’s clever fingers unbuttoning his dumb collared shirts before he’s shooting the whiskey back like it was a cheap shot in a bar with a low hygiene rating.
It surprises her how intense the feeling is. How consuming. And Sam’s worth it. She can feel that in her new bones.
“Uh, yeah.” He tries to think about what fucking moment in his life he could have found the time to get married and can’t come up with anything, and says, “Couple years now.”
And Jack, because Jack really is only a 3 year old at the end of the day, even if he has all the knowledge of the cosmos crammed into his noggin, starts crying.
There are no bones to burn here. Nothing he can kill to make it right. Just Patience, miserable, and Dean, useless.
Fuck it. She has a few hours before Dean gets here. She can visit the first dump site. If Dean wants to see it himself, he can go on his own time.
God, Dean wants to go home. He just wants to go home. He wants people to stop dying. He wants Cas to forgive him, and he wants Sam to be happy, and he wants Jack to have the childhood he deserves.
Dean chokes on coffee. Kaia’s hand flies to her mouth, but Dean doesn’t know if she’s hiding a gasp or a laugh.
“Of course I love you, Dean.” Of course, he says. Sure. Because it’s so fucking obvious. “But that kind of love, that kind of certainty? I’d never experienced it. Until, suddenly, one day, you lifted your love and folded it over me.”
He’s thinking about Claire, nearly a werewolf, and Kaia, nearly abandoned in the bad place. He’s thinking of his gun pressed against Kaia’s forehead and Claire saying “Dean Winchester is a monster.” He’s thinking about being able to let go, and how pathetically, stupidly grateful he is that Kaia and Claire are able, at least sometimes, to put down what they carry.
“You like pie of all kinds, and you love your family so much that you taught Castiel what it means to have a family. You said that pain had meaning, but work to always lessen it for others. You drive a cool car that you fixed yourself, and you have given your life for this world more than any human could be asked to. You liked my bird idea and you took the time to answer my question.”
Cassie laughs. Nudges Dean and says, “Hardly. But let's be honest. You don’t want me to answer that in front of your girls.”
Dean repeats the song because he still has five hours to Jody’s cabin, and that's plenty of time to listen to 18 songs.
He continues about his week. He does his chores, he answers a few phone calls. He teaches Kaia and Claire a good trick for decapitating creatures that are taller than them, a thing he hasn’t had to do in a long time, but still remembers from when he was 12. The grill out goes off without a hitch, which is to say 100 things go wrong, but they’re all stupid little things, and people are laughing and talking over each other. Jack turns out to enjoy learning to grill, which is wonderful, even though he’s extremely bad at it because he gets distracted by talking to people and forgets to flip the burgers. Dean and Sam do actually end up going on a hunt that week, but it’s literally half a town over.
Eileen wakes the next morning to sunlight streaming through her window. It makes her regret the existence of the sun, the morning, and life itself.
He flips to the other paper, glimpses “9. You rise.” in Cas’s pencil-thin handwriting and ignores his shame to read “10. Your heart is good.” around the echo of
“Weighted” is where he lands, like the vests that Jack had discovered for dogs afraid of thunderstorms. A comforting weight, something grounding, real and ubiquitous. No, not grounding per say. Like spreading your wings and finding that the wind contains enough strength to simply lift you. A force of nature heavy enough to keep you airborn. Dean’s love takes weight from Castiel, but instead of banishing the heaviness, wraps it around him like armor.
Dean thinks of tiny moments — sipping coffee with Cas while Michael raged in his brain, driving down the open road with Cas while the Mark screamed in his blood. He thinks of big moments — praying to Cas in parking lots, in Bobby’s scrapyard, from his knees, his hands grasping pale bark in Purgatory. Praying to Cas, even in the beginning, when he didn’t expect an answer. Even at the end, when Cas was dead and in the Empty and he knew he’d never get an answer again.
Cas smiles and doesn’t step back. He just sort of stands in Dean’s bedroom, staring at Dean, smiling. He tilts his head to the side thoughtfully. “I always did have a cause, though. Hopefully he forgives that.”
But Dean’s fine. He’s not broken. He’s just slow-playing it. Playing a little hard to get. That’s valid.
Just one song. Cas’s angular handwriting taunts him with “Tus Pies (Your Feet) - Nahko And Medicine For The People”
him. If it was some sort of sex thing. If Cas, with his smoldering voice and his piercing eyes, had sat down next to him at a bar.
Cas, because he’s a nonsensical wavelength of eternity packed into a tax accountant with blue, blue eyes, says only, “Oh.”
See, Dean knew he had been forgetting something in the emotional turmoil of the first tape. He was supposed to sit Cas down and explain that he wasn’t worth all this...stuff. The fresh fruits and the stupid cooking challenges, Cas letting him explain movies and shitty jokes, the soft touches that Cas drops on him, and definitely not the fucking mixtapes.
If Dean had been braver, smarter, better, he’d have been able to do something. Or say something at least. Instead, he’d been silent, and he’d done nothing.
Dean’s phone buzzes with a text reply from Sam, and that makes it easier somehow. Not only is Sam alive — he’s also good. Sam is building a happy ending, and Dean doesn’t want to change that. Dean’s stupidly proud of how Sam turned out. He might not need his big brother anymore, but Dean had been there when he did. He can’t undo his own story without undoing Sam’s.
It’s a bit like driving with Dean in the Impala, while also being absolutely nothing like driving with Dean in the Impala.
Even when the famine had come, when her aunt struggled to feed her own children, the girl was protected and loved. Alone in the universe, the first of her kind, beloved by her family, honored by her people.
Castiel sits across from Sam, who is ensconced in the library like a fish in water. Despite purportedly researching components for a spell that has intrigued Sam, Cas is mostly enjoying the silence and quiet camaraderie. Sam appears deep in thought, while Cas is happy to simply skim through books. The one he’s currently enjoying has interesting ideas about blood warding that would be groundbreaking if they weren’t all based on a flawed understanding of physics. Cas smiles to himself. Humans have always been such fascinatingly curious creatures. Even starting from faulty assumptions, the author arrives at some clever conclusions. Cas mostly enjoys his zest for the subject.
God. He’s such a girl. He doesn’t need Cas to cuddle him and paint his nails. Sex alone would be good. More than enough.
Dean slams the computer shut, and stifles a wince when it snaps closed with more force than he intended. Sorry, Sammy.
It’s new, and it’s uncomfortable, and Dean hates it. But if anyone deserves his best effort at this, it’s Sam. ‘You’re my brother and I love you’ feels enormous and impossible, but Dean spent 40 years in hell for Sam, and he’d spend another 100 just to give Sam this, so what is 10 seconds of gut-wrenching, excruciating panic?'
He tries to figure out how he could be giving Cas what he wants, and he comes up with nothing. The song goes on to its end, sings out
“Cas,” he starts gently, and Cas spares a moment to marvel at this. After everything, the Winchesters are both, at their hearts, gentle people. What a beautiful thing the Winchesters are. “You know you’re family. We love you, too.”
But then, why stop at a Dean who isn’t a weapon? Why not go all the way back? Why not return to Dean who was never in Hell, who doesn’t look at a person and know exactly how he’d string them up on the rack? A version of Dean who was stronger, smarter, better — who managed to get himself and Sam out of Dad’s crusade. A Dean who works as a small town mechanic with a hotshot lawyer for a brother, who managed to give Sam the innocence he deserved. A Dean who knows more about Jess than what she looked like and when she was born because he’s a Dean who knew her, a Dean who never let Yellow Eyes sink his claws into Sam. A Dean who managed to keep Sam safe.
Four words slam realization directly into Dean’s gut. Jack's been walking around with a tangle in his chest labeled
Dean thinks about their first kiss — the way that Cas had trailed his hand burning hot up Dean’s thigh, the way Cas had gone soft and shy as Dean began kissing him just to kiss him, forgoing the frantic need to press skin to skin. He thinks about softening, drawing out that blushing Cas, but Cas wants him now, needy and desperate. Cas wants him panting and barely able to catch his breath. Cas wants him.
Castiel has the good grace to pretend to consider that. “You could no sooner change my love for you than I could will myself to stop. It is as much a part of who I am as my grace. It could be separated from me, but it will always, inexorably, be mine.”
Cas opens his mouth, and Dean’s not going to lie: he’s very interested in how the fuck Becky became involved in Dean’s tragedy of a love life, but priorities. He remembered what was actually important to talk about. Unlike Castiel, Dean knows how to respond to the right part of a question.
Dean lets out a short ugly laugh. Powerless, but alive. Maybe Chuck will understand what it means to be human after all.
It seems he has nothing in him but emptiness and anger. He listens to I See You and A Better Son/Daughter, thinking only about Cas leaving. Dean is too angry and too childish.
All of a sudden, Dean misses Benny like an aching limb. The way he always does but always ignores. Benny hadn’t needed Dean to tell him what Cas was, what he meant — he just understood. Benny had never judged Dean for who he was. Hell, Benny had even liked who he was. He’d understood. Benny, who’d had his back from the beginning, even before Dean knew it. Benny, who hadn’t blinked at any request that Dean made of him.
“Zadkiel,” Cas’s voice always sounds like it’s coming from deep in his chest, instead of his throat. “Does that answer your question?”
Dean lets himself relax a little. Cas does know him. He doesn’t see Dean with weird rose-coloured glasses. He does know Dean.
His own torturing had been more measured. He’d leave his victims alone for years, knowing they’d beg for his knife when he came back. He’d once peeled the skin off someone's face, and they’d thanked him.
Dean feels fire lick at his heart. His stomach knots, his fists clench — but no black descends, no emptiness. Just Dean, his rage, Cas, his love. Cas’s love is winning this fight by a landslide. Dean’s anger is turning inside out, morphing into despair, the gripping panic that he can’t save Cas from this. Cas won’t even let him try.
Most of the time though, Dean just cooks. It’s always something different, but any time they’re all in the bunker, Dean makes dinner, breakfast, lunch.
Jody quirks her eyes at the whiskey and glass as she goes to clear it from the table, so Dean says “tiny bit of angel business” as an explanation, which he should have known wouldn’t slide, because suddenly everyone is trying to get clarification and making sure everything is alright.
That Dean, maybe. That Dean had a chance of looking at Castiel with half a hope of saying something back. That Dean might have made loving fun.
In the silence between his own tattered breaths, he stares out at the beautiful field and wishes desperately, selfishly — for once, for one time, to not be alone.
Dean puts his beer down. Another thing that Dean had forgotten from the first mixtape is that Cas will transition seamlessly from heartfelt love confessions to shit like this.
Right now, Dean is chopping garlic with the practiced ease of someone who uses knives every day. Sure, maybe that’s not what they usually use knives for, but practice is practice.
Sam seems to take pity on Cas’s confused expression. “Don’t worry about it. Also, probably don’t move any mountains. I’m sure that would come back to bite us somehow. As for Dean, well…he’s Dean, y’know?”
“Actually, I had an idea for a spell. Can I run some thoughts by you?” Sam says, maybe 3 minutes later. Cas lets Sam distract him for the next few hours, until Dean walks into the library.
Cas moves to stand before him, scowling lightly and saying, “I’m not going to heal you if you hurt yourself with your ridiculous games,” which is when Dean realises the problem.
Claire and Kaia are sitting in stunned silence, but Cassie laughs easily and says, “Oh Dean, you really haven’t changed.” Dean doesn’t open his mouth to say how deeply, disgustingly not true that sentence is, but only because Dean’s seriously contemplating a vow of silence after the nightmare that just came out of his mouth.
” It’s not so much a question that punches out of Dean as it is a breath of wild disbelief. Dean doesn’t do Cas the disservice of pretending not to understand what Cas means by that — not when Dean still drives around the city if he can avoid it. “What about Detroit made you think white picket fence and 2.5 kids?”
Leaning forward in his chair, he rests his hands in between his legs and dangles the beer bottle at his fingers. He feels his shoulders rise up, and then he pushes them back down.
“Jerk.” Sam says, as Dean reaches the door. Dean hesitates in the doorway, adopting the biggest shit-eating grin Sam has ever seen.
reminds Dean, not of the misery of not knowing what in his life was real and what was a consequence of Chuck’s twisted games, but of the fact that they are free now. But it’s
“I could go,” he volunteers, almost instinctively. As soon as the words leave his mouth though, he gets a rush at the idea. That’s perfect. It gets him out of the bunker, it gives him something to do, and it puts him far away from Cas without making it look like he’s trying to get far away from Cas. Plus, Eileen’s not into touchy-feely crap, and she has excellent instincts. She’s great to hunt with. As far as Dean’s concerned, anyone who’s willing to take a swing at God for Sam is a great person to kill monsters with.
She takes her time wandering to the door, but as soon as it’s open, Dean bursts in, talking a mile a minute and signing just as quickly.
“You don’t — you don’t have to. You can dress however you want, Cas. That’s what being comfortable is,” Dean says. If you let things like this sit, they can get twisted up.
Dean knows that he’d never approach Cas, because he doesn’t approach men — he doesn’t. Maybe Cas would see him across the bar though, lights low enough that Dean became something that he wants, and he would approach Dean instead. Cas can be relentless in pursuit of things that he’s after. Maybe, just maybe, Cas would decide that what he wanted was Dean. And Dean — Dean wouldn’t say no.
Cas is standing up and straightening his right sleeve. Dean sticks his hand in his pocket and rakes his nails across his thigh in a desperate bid to calm down.
Wait, a spare? Does Dean wear reading glasses? Eileen gingerly swaps her sunglasses for the newer pair, squinting in the sunlight.
Dean feels his foot push down a bit harder on the gas, the road flying underneath him, heartbeat rising to meet the speedometer. Listening to the tape play out, he examines each revelation.
“The Winchester Prank War is a time honored tradition, Cas. Sam retaliating is half the fun,” Dean squeeks out. He’s proud that it comes out nearly normal. His mouth does a funny thing on Cas’s name, but embarrassingly, that's probably normal enough not to attract notice.
Wait, that’s not right. He has to move his hand. He has to open the fridge. He has to get beer and go and sit out there, and talk with his family, and he has to do it with a smile.
and Dean is laughing so hard he actually ends up sitting in the parking lot for a solid five minutes. He doesn’t even let the song end, just rewinds the whole tape and starts driving home.
Dean manages a stuttering step back, twisting slightly away. Mercifully, Cas doesn’t follow. The half inch of extra-space gives his brain clarity, as does dropping his gaze. To the floor, he says something that probably should be said to Cas’s face, but we take what we can get.
He lets the song play through. Castiel is in love with him. Dean is in love with Castiel. He's never going to be able to listen to Taylor Swift again and not think of Castiel in the passenger seat, grumpily putting on a cheap cowboy hat and rumbling, “I'm your Huckleberry.”
Dean fishes the walkman out of his pocket, places it on the table, and realises he has absolutely no reason not to sit here and just listen to music.
His knees are curled to his chest, and he's in his bedroom, and he's in the store room, and Jack said
‘Eileen is the fucking best,’ Dean thinks, and finds himself signing “You” “best” at the same time without so much as a conscious thought. Eileen smirks, and they retreat into silence for a few minutes as Dean shovels cold eggs and coffee into his mouth. Nerd squad has started talking about magic, which is when Dean normally has to intervene. Left to their own devices, Cas and Sam would come up with an experimental form of magic and use it right there in the bunker, but the conversation sounds safely theoretical for now, and Sam seems…
He can't even tell if the singer is supposed to be him or if it's supposed to be Cas. Is Cas saying that he'll wait for Dean? Is he saying he wants to be a better person for Dean? No, that's absurd. Cas is already one of the best men Dean knows. Is it a time limit? I'll come back to you in a year or so, and if you're not the person I thought you were by then, I'm going to leave you again?
It's so clearly an us-against-the-world song. It's so obviously about carving their own path, so obviously Team Free Will that it's actually just comfortable. It's not even a love song. It's just a
For some reason, for some idiotic reason, Cas loves Dean, and Dean can’t even pretend that Cas hasn’t seen him at his worst, that he hasn’t treated Cas terribly. Still,
Hilariously, Dean seems to have a reasonably strong grasp on transgender. He seems happy with non-binary, though he didn’t have the words for it before. Eileen knows he’s great with gay and lesbian — she heard all about Charlie the night that Sam sat in her kitchen and carefully, painstakingly went through all the friends they had ever lost, like a procession he felt determined to march through. Eileen's kitchen is a confessional — they both do their time there, listing out sins for the other to forgive.
His phone buzzes with a text from Claire: a picture of an extremely old dude feeding the pigeons captioned, “This you, old man?” He shoots a picture of the literal baby from the box of clementines he bought and captions it “Claire?” before sending it her way. Kaia sends him a candid of Claire laughing on the side of the road a few moments later, so he figures it lands.
Both men carefully talk around their father, who by rights should be a part of the story of Sam attempting to sneak a dog home in his backpack, but Eileen doesn’t comment on it. Eileen knows the story, but the way Dean tells it still leaves her in stitches.
He straightens up and looks around. “Hey, where’s Donna?” He can’t help the concerned look he sends Jody. She’d probably tell him if something had happened, but in this line of work, vigilance is not even paranoia. It’s just common sense.
Dean tries to beat back the feeling that he just managed to steal a cookie from the cookie jar without getting caught. He’s allowed. It’s okay.
Here, alone in this room, Dean allows himself to admit a terrifying truth: he loves Cas, and there is no place he’d rather be. He lets himself be weak for just a second.
“Is that bothering you?” Dean’s mouth says, and his hand gestures at the sleeve that Cas is fiddling with.
It was like Dean had realised, factually, that he’d never be happy again, but because Sam had asked him to stay, he’d accepted the condition and moved on.
Now that he knows the game, Dean obviously joins in. Together, they manage to get Eileen a deck of all Wild +4s, and Dean successfully slides 5 or 6 extra cards into Sammy’s hand.
Dean rips the headphones off. He can distantly hear the voice lifting softly out of the headphones and hears
It's just a song about living in the moment and holding onto the people you love, underscored by a sick guitar riff. Dean can get behind that. He can even get why Cas would put it on a tape for him.
He doesn’t get why it feels so strange to be doing something he’s done his whole life. His thumb presses play.
So, everything is pretty much normal. Except that Dean carries the walkman with him everywhere, and when he gets angry or tired or can’t remember why anyone keeps him around, he slides the headphones on and lets 18 songs stand as proof that someone loves him on purpose and wants him around. He knows Cas catches him singing along to it in the kitchen more than once, but he just smiles fondly.
But then, punching Sam himself. Pummelling Cas. Unleashing on them both. Jack, who he threatened to kill and nearly did. Kaia, too. Kids he scarred. Hundreds of children he didn’t save. People he put at risk. People who died for them. Ellen and Jo. Benny. Crowley. Charlie.
So, Cas loves him, but Cas doesn’t really want him. Dean pushes the pedal like that angers him, but it doesn’t. It can’t. Dean already knew that.
Dean rolls his eyes. “Neither does torturing the other perfectly good food in the fridge with whatever that —” he gestures to the shelf before him “— concoction is.” Sam rolls his eyes and Dean lets the bickering carry them back to the table.
“You seem good. Lighter,” Sam says. Dean knows he’s thinking of those post-Chuck weeks when Dean had wanted so badly to be happy, so badly to enjoy being free, but had just felt hollow and empty. He’d gone through the motions, but just barely. Ate just enough not to starve, drank just enough not to die. He’d obliterated himself to dreamless sleep most nights, pushed for hunts halfway across the country, dragged Sam up and down the interstate without rest.
Cas had explained to Jack how to turn it off, how to block out those frequencies. Cas can stare directly at Dean’s soul for hours, but only after years and years of practice. At first, Jack had seemed pleased, but he’d quickly slipped back into melancholy.
He doesn't think about Cas walking into the lake. He doesn't think about the river in Purgatory, and he doesn't, he especially doesn't think of the black goo sliding down Cas's body like a loving caress.
After digging a little deeper, since the first search isn’t always right, he comes away with 2 thoughts. 1) There are a lot of websites dedicated to flower meanings, and 2) Cas dropped some Baby Blue Eyes on Dean’s bedside just to let Dean know he had won the race.
Dean lets the next song begin and listens to its gentle strumming, trying to let his heart calm, trying to empty his chest.
“Oh boy, Dean. Your life is just a mess, isn’t it?” Claire is smiling evilly, and Dean consoles himself with the fact that the books are not in print anymore and just not that popular. She probably won’t be able to find a copy. Probably.
He’s not going to lay in Dean’s bed. Even if Dean does manage to seduce him, Cas will just leave after.
“For you?” Dean says, knowing his confusion shows in the hesitancy of hands and the questioning of his voice.
Next time he's in need of a weapon to defeat an unspeakable evil, Dean's got to remember to check the local Target.
Dean is good in bed, is the thing. He knows that doesn’t make up for anything else, but it was always enough for a few months at least. He knows how to give a partner what they want. Knows how to kneel between someone's knees until they forgive everything else.
On his second listen, Dean finds the song much nicer. It’s sweet, even. Dean finds himself tapping the rhythm out on his thigh with his fingers.
Dean returns to watch the carnage unfold, making quick excuses for Patience’s absence. It’s a fun night, but by the time he crawls into bed, he’s still thinking about the impossibility of knowing an entire ocean and the absurdity of asking it not to be water.
Claire shrugs like it doesn’t matter to her, which is how Dean knows it does. “Nah. It’s whatever. He can just pop in whenever he wants. It’s not like he doesn’t know where I am.”
Patience wins the second round of Uno, but the game takes 2 and a half hours. She’s a cat with a canary about the victory, so Dean is surprised when he finds her standing aimlessly in the kitchen 20 minutes later.
Eileen’s phone buzzes with a text from Sam: “Ew. Also, does that Marid head have a bomb in it?” Another quickly follows: “Hey, La Croix isn’t THAT bad.” Apparently the villain having an entire fridge of only Peach-Pear La Croix is not enough to put Sam off his kick.
Dean opens his eyes. He catches his reflection in the rearview mirror, but he averts his eyes. That Dean is a fantasy. Instead, there’s just the Dean whose anger drives teeth and knives into everyone around him, whose useless hands can shoot with deadly accuracy but can’t reach out, whose heart is shriveled in his chest.
Alistair had found it hysterical, that few souls became Demons at his hands. Dean hadn’t cared much either way at the time.
Dean also grabs Cas’s hand in the middle of movie night and holds it. Jack had picked, so it was definitely some Disney movie, but Dean can’t recall a single thing about that night other than the pull of Cas’s knuckles between his fingers.
She looks back at the neatly stacked papers on her desk. Not a lot of things about this are making sense. Hopefully, tomorrow will help. Right now, the net is too wide. The autopsy reports are horrifyingly lacking in detail. Eileen is struggling to find anything that connects the victims.
Cas’s hand reaches out to pry Dean’s hand off the walkman, and Dean is frozen by clement fingers dancing over his clenched fist. Cas is so close to him right now, crowding Dean between the desk and Cas’s bright, unblinking, blue eyes. There is barely any space between them, and Dean’s heart is caving, capsizing, coming apart at the seams. Cas’s gaze cuts up from the walkman to catch Dean’s face, and all Dean can think is
“I mean, the kid drives me insane sometimes, but I’m glad he’s back.” Then, because he extremely doesn’t want to say
He shoots Mackey a follow-up text telling him to let Dean know if he needs anything, earning a quick 10-4.
Claire regards him with pinpoint seriousness, says “thanks, old man” and drags Kaia into a messy kiss. She screams “Best Girlfriend Ever” and rewards Dean for keeping an eye on them by spilling half her drink on his lap. Dean, despite only strategically nursing the same beer for the past 2 hours, can’t even muster any jabbing response.
Is he doing to Jack what James is doing to Patience? Is there any way to overwrite telling your kid he’s a monster? Putting your gun in his face? Turning him into a bomb?
It doesn’t have to be big things, Dean thinks. Cas is happy, and for some crazy reason, Cas heard a song go
A horrible heat builds behind Dean’s eyes. He closes them like that would protect him at all. Like anything could protect him now.
The ritual worked though. Alicia came to, twigs transmuted to flesh and blood, blinking away confusion.
Dean doesn’t. Cas is one of the best things that’s ever happened to him. Cas never damaged anything that Dean hadn’t broken first. Apologise. Apologise, Dean.
And smashes his finger into the rewind button till the tape restarts to Fitz and The Tantrums. He needs to think.
It had been hard enough, Dean realises as he walks back to the car, before. When Dean could maybe say ‘I love you’ to Cas like he might say it to Sam or Jack or Bobby or Charlie. But, now, if Dean manages to squeeze ‘I love you’ past his sharp teeth, he knows Cas will hear the whole truth. That Dean is
, but there’s no music on the rack. There’s no sound but his screaming, his begging, his weakness, his shame.
Cas has been worshipped before, prayed to, feared, respected, liked. He’s been all those things, and he will be many more. But cherished. He’d never been cherished before. Cas’s stomach squirms strangely. Unbidden, he finds his fingers pressed up against his lips again. He remembers Dean’s gentle caress of his face, the slow and soft pressure of his lips. Cas remembers the look in Dean’s eyes when he’d pulled away.
You make loving fun. Dean has a fleeting moment where he remembers Dean, before Hell, before everything — heck, before ruining Sam's life at Stanford. Just him alone on the road, Cassie's gentle finger prodding his chest as she said, “Stop making me laugh, I'm trying to seduce you,” like Cassie's laugh hadn't been one of the most beautiful things about her.
Cas wonders if he should point out that Sam, too, has tried to protect Dean. That Sam’s love for Dean has saved him more than once. Dean cherishes it above everything, but Sam continues speaking as if that thought doesn’t even occur to him. “But the thing about Dean is — he doesn’t understand how amazing that is. He just thinks it's what anyone would do. It’s like he only sees the negatives. Sometimes it’s like he’s doesn’t even hear the compliments, just stupid shit people say when they’re angry. If he can twist something to hurt himself, I don’t think he knows how to not. You can’t let him misinterpret things. It’s hard sometimes, but you have to find a way to talk to him in his language.” Sam rubs his hands against the carving again, fingers tracing the sharp D.W with a soft kind of reverence.
He’s not in Hell. He’s kneeling. He forces his eyes open, glimpses rabid eyes in the gleaming of Baby’s trunk, curls his hands around her silver. He’s home. He’s not in Hell.
He gets behind the next song, and the song after that. Keeping Claire and Kaia in his eyeline, he’s soon winding his way to the merch table. They're selling vinyl records, which implies good taste, but they also have a shirt featuring the Powerpuff Girls, which implies weird taste. He buys two of the Powerpuff ones for Claire and Kaia because he knows it’ll make them laugh, and then he catches a black shirt that sports a coffin and says “Let It Bury Me.” He buys that immediately, because he knows Sam will make a hilarious face when he catches Dean wearing it.
he thinks as he pops the tape out of his walkman and into her deck. It starts at the beginning again since Dean fell asleep with it on last night, so he skips to the last song he remembers and lets Hymnals play as he pushes Baby down the highway. The normal store is only 20 minutes away, but as the song plays, Dean toys with the idea of driving and driving and driving.
Dean knows he’s a shade too quiet as they sit around enjoying afternoon beers, but he thinks he’s able to play it off as just being tired. Sam asks him about the concert (or maybe it was Jack?), and Dean drags something from his chest that must pass muster. Words are getting harder. He doesn’t bring up Cassie, and no one knows to ask, so he’s saved that ordeal. He drinks exactly 3 beers, carefully slow. He lobs out an extremely dumb reference to something he knows Jack doesn’t understand, and lets the conversation derail into Cas and Sam trying to explain it. Individually, extremely smart people. Combined, their explanations have a way of taking new and unforeseen idiotic turns. Dean rubs his hand against the paper of the beer, and keeps half an eye on the clock.
Dean and Eileen mostly kick mud around on the side of the road, staring into harsh sun, before hopping back in the Impala and driving to the house of the unlucky soul who found the bodies.
“Given how you feel,” Sam begins. He’s giving Cas the eyebrows that indicate he is speaking lightly about something that makes him wish to speak heavily. “You should know that Dean...Dean always looked out for me, right? Even in ways I didn’t understand. Even in ways I still don’t, I think. I feel like I’m always discovering new hits that Dean took for me, and I know I noticed too late, I didn’t — I know. Dean didn’t have anyone who did that for him, not —” he looks up, giving Cas a surprised smile “— not till now.”
“You’re my brother,” he chokes out. “And I love you.” Sam’s face reorients with concern. Great, Winchester. You tell your brother you love him so rarely that he immediately assumes something is horribly wrong when you do.
Since the options are to stare moodily at the lake while working in silence or stare moodily at the lake while listening to music, Dean slides the headphones onto his ears. At least the work is nearly done. He listens to House on Fire one more time, since that's where the tape starts. Dean finds it easier to listen to now, using the nail gun to punctuate the beat. Then, he listens to it again, just because it’s the right kind of music for back breaking work in the sun. He catches
“It...did.” He offers because he’s useless, and that's all he has to offer. The comfortable silence between them takes on a sour aftertaste, air stale on words Dean isn’t saying and that Cas deserves to hear.
The rest of the day is normal. The gang decides that library cataloguing will follow lunch, with free time after that. Dean, who almost forgets, grabs Mamma Mia off the counter and hands it to Cas with a muttered, “I thought you might like this since uh, ABBA.” Cas declares a movie night the way most people declare a battle plan and, well, that's the rest of the day sorted.
for her English elective, “Cosmic Loneliness: Technology, Religion, and the Pursuit of Free Will,” which honestly sounds fascinating.
Eileen coos gibberish at the pup while Dean stands at her shoulder. She shoots Dean a look of affectionate camaraderie, appreciating his attempt to protect her from the terrifying monster, even if the monster was a fluffy baby. Hearing something, the dog jolts upright and runs back towards the house. Dean signs a hasty apology, mumbling something that Eileen can’t make out as he turns his face away. This catches Eileen’s attention. Dean rarely forgets.
Still, Cas had been scared. Worried. It wasn’t like Dean to let his emotions bubble so clearly to the surface, to cry so unreservedly. Dean wore his heart on his sleeve, but those sleeves were carefully tucked under galvanized vambraces, covered in blood warding drawn in Dean’s own careful hand.
Sam’s never read much Vonnegut. Listening to Dean and Patience exchange interpretations, he wonders if he should.
“What, Sam? You want to go do hippie shit in a forest. As long as I don’t have to come with, I couldn’t care less.”
Dean pulls on dark jeans, a black shirt, and a blue plaid flannel. It’s not until he’s sliding his gun into his belt that he realises this insanity is even affecting how he dresses.
Cas is looking at the black metal bending in his hand when he says, “The first tape made you very happy.”
He swallows his coffee wrong and coughs. He rewinds the song. And tries again — and then he puts his coffee cup down, because he can't drink coffee right now. He can't breathe because
The stand off had been tense. Alicia, confused and pleading, as Sam held the gun at her. Max standing damningly quiet beside her. Max had stared into Dean’s eyes, not even bothering to raise his weapon, as if he was fine to die like this. As if an extra year had been worth it.
Her phone vibrates with another text, but it’s not Sam (or, she supposes, Max with Sam’s phone). It’s just Dean texting that he’s ready to go, and does she want to take her own car or come with him?
Dean pauses the song. Drinks the rest of the glass. Realizes this is his third glass, and he doesn’t want to get blackout drunk alone in Jody’s cabin when the kids might return at any moment. Considers switching back to beer, and then just gets water.
Eileen is frustrated, not so much with Dean as with her concept of Dean. He’s been…well, he’s been perfect. He stays carefully within her line of sight, quickly follows her lead, and happily agrees with whatever she’s feeling. He’s remained bright — almost optimistic — as they run into stone walls. He’s clever with solutions and quick with work arounds. He’s professional, efficient.
For a brief moment, he tries to imagine what's on the tape. Cas is a weird dude for sure, and he can't imagine he listened to any music and thought of
Claire rolls her eyes and punches his arm instead of saying hello, taunting, “You old people gonna spend all weekend talking about your weird soap opera?”
Dammit, back to the flowers. Dean looks at the mixtape in betrayal, wondering when an Angel of the Lord giving him a mixtape became comforting instead of mind boggling. Okay, so, the facts are as follows: Cas snuck into Dean’s room while Dean was sleeping. Cas then gave him a mixtape and a smattering of blue flowers.
A/N: hey, ever wonder what would happen if Dean listened to deeply emotional slam poetry recordings?
“I’m bisexual,” she says aloud, simultaneously repeating the movement. He probably just doesn’t know the sign.
They high five a lot. That’s how they greet each other now. It’s halfway between an inside joke and pure idiocy. Still, inside jokes — those are things you have with friends.
He can do that one more time. Cas might not be right, but Dean can at least listen. Cas probably knows him at least as well, if not better, than his Dad had. Plus, Cas has the infinite knowledge of the universe or something crammed in his dorky little angel brain. He’s a smart guy. If he’s saying he knows who Dean is, Dean can at least try to listen. That’s an achievable little goal.
Dean fumbles into his bag, pulling out the papers with Cas’s delicate handwriting. X Ambassador chants
reverberates in his ears before his mind slides off the music. The edge of the bed dips under his weight as he tries to figure out what he’s feeling, why killing the Aswang and the Marid didn’t lift the load from his bones.
Dean watches Jody out of the corner of his eyes, sees the quiet, fierce pride with which she regards them. He thinks about how casually she can reach down to kiss Kaia on the forehead or nudge Patience’s books down, how she tells Alex she’s proud of her, how she tells Claire that she loves her: how she gave these girls a house, and in short order, a home.
They pass an alarmingly large McDonalds before pulling into the woman’s carefully manicured lawn. Eileen shudders at the sheer amount of water that grass takes to maintain. People have the weirdest priorities.
But Sam’s not a kid anymore. He doesn’t need Dean’s approval for every little thing. “Yea, everyone’s fine. He’s inviting me to a lunar ceremony.”
Cas had known the meaning of heartbreak before. He’d watched Chuck take Jack from them. He’d watched Dean march off to die. Even so, he had never felt such a physical shattering before that moment. Not until Jack, curled up miserably, looked at him with tear-stained eyes and asserted that Dean hated him.
Dean gruffly rubbed Jack's head, tossing his hair (which honestly was getting a bit long. Like, what, they don't have barbers in Heaven?) and saying some bullshit about cooking dinner.  He'd been thinking they had stuff for grilled cheeses — might not have enough apples, but Jack's the only one who likes grilled cheese with apples in it, and Dean was pretty sure they had one or two good ones. Then, Sam said some absolute bullshit about settling Jack into his room, which made no sense for a number of reasons, the first of which was that Jack is maybe (he really should get clarity on this) God and doesn't need help settling into his room. The second was Cas and Jack's rooms had both sat carefully untouched, so all of Jack's stuff was still there. Finally, and most importantly, their departure left Dean and Cas alone in the foyer and Dean simply didn’t know how to Do That right then.
Dean’s hand clenches the paper so hard, he may have ripped one of the edges. He takes a steadying breath. He recalls all the times he was at rock bottom, all the ways he gave up. He remembers failing and failing and failing.
Dean lets out a sigh so big it appears to startle Cas into looking at him, which has the benefit of meaning that Cas is looking at him, and has the disbenefit of meaning that Cas is fucking looking at him.
One hunt and he’s exhausted. Listen to some bullshit poetry and he’s sobbing. In the garage, in the kitchen — Dean’s coming apart at the seams. No wonder everyone is moving onto bigger and better things. It’s not like Dean has a ton to offer. There’s nothing he does that other people can't manage. Hell, half the stuff others do better.
He can feel his neck burning splotchy with blush. His ears are probably a horrendous pink. Cas ducks a little to catch his eyes, and Dean looks at him and feels the heat on his face tick up.
Eileen turns, shaking her head, marveling at how that man and the man who just high fived her are the same.
so stuck in his head that he’s doing something between dancing and laughing as he glues googly eyes to Sam’s bed, mirror, ceiling, floor, and a couple of his guns. The rest he pours over Sam’s sheets and his desk. He puts exactly one set underneath the toilet lid.
When he walked in on Sam educating Jack at the kitchen table about whatever fun human topic they were discussing, he didn’t think much about it but to smile at Jack and squeeze Cas's arm as he slid past to grab coffee. It wasn't until he heard Cas's deep voice lift up in query that he even thought to pay attention, though in his defense, he was still without coffee.
Dean looks contrite for a second, so she knows he heard her, and says, “It’s really not my fault. Remember that weird moment with Dr. Sexy and Dr. Hart at the beginning of the season? Well, they revealed that —”
Wildly, this reminds Sam that the only person to ever set a curfew for him was Dean. There was also a weird period when Sam was somewhere between 6 and 10 that Dean got strangely militant about bedtime. Sam’s not complaining — sleep is important, as are routines. Distracted, he answers honestly. “No. I want to go.”
“I heard your prayer.” Cas says, tying an anchor around Dean’s heart. Dooming it to drown in the turbulent ocean of his chest.
? He went from fighting tooth and nail for his survival, for everyone's survival, and now he’s standing on a dock that he built, talking on his cellphone to an angel of the lord about the other baby angels he’s adopted to teach free will. He’s seen Cas stabbed, and human, and near death, but he panicked like a two year old getting their blanket washed while Cas is fully powered up, surrounded by siblings that love him. Dean realizes with a weird unsettling hiccup that there probably isn’t anything left strong enough to kill Cas, at least not without making some serious noise.
He thinks of the way some part of Cas’s second mixtape had twisted Dean up inside, and Sam saying, “You can’t let him misinterpret.” Cas’s smile widens on his face as he comes to the clearest logical conclusion.
See, because, the next song isn't a fun happy bop. It’s…it's beautiful, and loving, and way, way, too much. It's got the same heavy atmosphere as The Peacock Dance, but the female vocals hammer lyrics into him that are much harder to ignore.
So, Dean's hand sort of…stuttered out. God, it was even shaking a bit, but hopefully no one could see, because Cas had said goodbye. Cas had said goodbye forever, but he was here, right here in front of them. Dean's hand squeezed around Cas's bicep like it would make him more real. It didn't help, because somehow Cas's smile became impossibly wild, and Dean couldn't look at that and think he was NOT dreaming.
“What? Cas, I don’t need a mountain moved.” Cas finds himself strangely disappointed by this. He hasn’t had a reason to truly flex his wings since he got them back. He thinks through the garrison. Perhaps he should teach them some aerial combat. There are no threats, but it doesn’t hurt to be in practice. Eliam in particular might enjoy it. Jack hasn’t done much flying. Cas will take him next time they’re both free.
Jack, bundled small against Cas’s chest like the child he remains, had turned pliant in Cas’s hug and said, “How? How can you know? He said —” Jack’s voice and body shrank smaller. “He said I wasn’t family. And in the 4 days that we’ve been back, he — he hasn’t said that it's okay.”
And it’s hard not to do things when they so obviously make them happy. Ruffling Jack's hair always has him shyly grinning. A quick squeeze to Cas's bicep (and yeah, that hadn't stopped) always makes him smile.
“Eliam is very pleased to be the older sibling, and thanks you for this charge.” Castiel says. “I am myself pleased with how well you received my brother. You handled yourself very well.” A beat. “It was nice, what you said to Zadkiel.”
The simplicity of that, and the truth of it. That they did find each other. That Cas, who has wings that let him fly away, always comes back. That Cas has flown, driven, and walked his way back to Dean whenever he could.
Sam laughs at his face, which Dean can only assume is screwed up in disgust. However, he also hip checks Dean away from the sink to do his own dishes, so Dean forgives him immediately.
Dean taps out the rhythm on the coffee mug and smiles to himself. Cas made him a mixtape. Castiel, angel of the lord, sat down and made him a mixtape of weird instrumental music and songs about free will.
Dean slams his bedroom door behind him like it has any chance of stopping any of the members of this house from barging in if they want to. He intends to stalk over to his desk where his own laptop sits, collecting dust and possibly not even charged. He's stopped halfway across the room by a glint of metal atop his bed sheets.
He looks to Jody and Donna for support, but Jody just holds her hands up in the universal signal of ‘I wash my hands of this bullshit.’ Donna is looking at him like he knows where the closest vampire nest is and she wants to know, too.
Sam’s countenance takes on a wry smile. “And then Lucifer again, and finding a way to deal with Michael, and then, uh, the whole thing with, well – God.” Dean snorts.  A barebones if accurate summary of the shittaccular last decade of their lives. “Like, usually, when we’re hunting, there’s some big horrible thing that we’re gunning for, even when we’re just cleaning out a vamp nest or something, and now there’s...” Sam stalls out.
“Uh. Heaven, I guess.” Sam shifts his attention to Dean when Dean speaks. The Winchesters communicate with more eyebrows than Cas thinks are strictly necessary.
Cas is in a male vessel, which might be a problem — sexual compatibility may not be a requisite for romantic love, but it’s probably important to Dean. The thing is, Sam’s pretty sure Dean
If nothing else — if he hadn’t been able to save anything else — this, the shrieking laughter, the sun's heavy rays, the youth and the life: this alone would have been worth it.
Dean makes Cas all feeling and impulse. Dean is terrifying choice married to total will, and Cas burns under him. Dean’s anger punches out, and Cas can’t seem to stop himself from punching back.
“4.94441 by 172.48046.” Dean tries to do some mental math about where those coordinates are and just gets not in America.
They literally split up 5 minutes ago. She and Dean had a nice relaxing car ride and decided to call it for the night when the witness provided no further leads. Eileen is already having nightmares where she has to live in Tulsa, Oklahoma for 6 months until another body drops.
The song turns on and Dean can't help but smile. Ella Fitzgerald makes him think of the ratty jukebox at the Roadhouse, and the memory is old enough now that it's faded sepia rather than grime and blood splattered across vivid color. Cas is a classy dude. Of course he likes the old classics. He and Ella would probably get on like peanut butter and jelly.
“Aw, you can admit you were excited to see me,” Dean jokes, as he opens the Impala’s back seat to grab his duffle.
Dean knows he’s the more experienced one, but it doesn’t matter — not in the face of Cas’s single-minded focus. Cas picks him up like he’s nothing. Dean’s brain short circuits and remains offline, even as he’s deposited on the desk. Cas is unstopping, and unstoppable — a hand in Dean’s hair, tugging him closer like Cas plans to devour him whole.
The rest of the hunt is Sam and Dean in the car arguing whether or not Eileen would like the objectively very pretty but also recently extremely cursed item of jewelry. Dean’s stance is that the ex-curse is a bonus. Sam’s stance is that Dean doesn’t really understand women.
Dean would thank God that this song isn’t a Death Star on the level of Angels of the Get Through, but God’s an asshole, so he’ll refrain. If he starts crying in front of Eileen, he’s leaving the car and putting a bullet in his brain. He knows he’s barely keeping it together, but there are some things too pathetic to come back from.
Hey, Dean’s not going to complain. Cas didn’t have to fix it, so he’s more than welcome to shatter it again. An endless cycle of making something whole to destroy it. Could be fun, Dean thinks, if it wasn’t such an obvious metaphor.
Cas makes eye contact with him once while Untouched is playing, and Dean has to duck his head as the blush spreads across his cheeks. He glances up at Cas a moment later, expecting something — annoyance, maybe — and is blindsided by a look of such complete fondness that Dean doesn't even realize that Khooneye Ma has started playing. Cas steps closer and simply says, “Thank you for the movie, Dean.”
Dean frowns. “If you don’t want to hunt, or be involved with hunting, you know you don’t have to be,” he starts, but she waves him off impatiently.
Eileen feels her heart lift, a cage of fear she wasn’t aware she’d been hiding in quietly unlocking around her. They make the invisible visible.
That’s the worst thing, actually. Cas is in love with him, and that, obviously, hasn’t changed. Cas will walk out of a room, or Dean will storm off, and in seconds, Dean feels Cas’s love settle on his shoulders. Between breaths, he freezes, immobile beneath blanketing love. It’s just a fact now. Cas is in love with him. Even breaking up hasn’t changed that.
" Cas says again, plaintively. It's full of need and want, and Dean did that to him. Dean’s mad with power, trying to get his hands everywhere at once, overwhelmed by the feeling of Cas at his fingers, the smell of him, the way Cas doesn’t close his eyes but stares down like Dean is some venerated altar.
Sam only brought that thing into the kitchen to throw it away, but in the face of Jack's boundless enthusiasm, he now has it carefully cradled in his lap). Dean’s distraction lulls him into forgetting to panic when Castiel sways into his space, whispering in his ear that he thinks that Sam may be getting “unwisely attached” to his blueberry cow. He laughs softly and whispers back, “Well, you want to take it from him?” as Sam tries to talk Jack out of naming the two Pillow Pets Blue and Purple.
Dean looks out at the lake, where Patience and Kaia are facing Claire and Alex in a rousing game of Chicken while Donna laughs so hard she may honestly be taking in water.
“Right. Obviously,” Sam says, and he’s laughing. Cas can tell. “Look, it’s not. Dean’s is. If you...huh.”
He’s still smiling a few minutes later when he reaches to flip his computer open. Something catches his eye. He freezes.
Dean scrambles and heaves himself upwards, turning away as quickly as he can. Cas can’t see. Cas can’t see him like this. No one can know. He turns his face away.
This time, it’s Eileen's turn to blink in confusion. They stare at each other awkwardly, Dean confused at Eileen's confusion.
She’s not trying to be mean to him. She just keeps getting distracted by the insanity of this conversation. Dean is over forty. Dean has punched God in the face. Dean basically raised Sam, who has a complicated relationship to his body on the best of days. Dean has a non-binary son. Yet, no one explained to him what bisexuality was. No one ever told him that was okay.
“It’s not that. I maybe wouldn’t have chosen this life, but — but it’s my life. I’m psychic, Dean. I can’t exactly leave the supernatural behind.” Patience stares down at her cup, drumming her fingers on its side. “I don’t think I’m explaining this well.”
“I have a gift for you,” Cas says, and Dean is still a bit recovering from their greeting, so he doesn't say anything in return, just opens his eyes questioningly.
It’s not even a big kiss. It’s barely a meeting of lips, but Dean will be damned if it’s not one of the best things that he’s ever experienced.
Dean doesn’t have a problem with queer people. He loved Charlie fiercely, and Sam knows he still calls Jesse and Cesar just to talk shit and check in on them.
“Yeah. Sorry, just zoned out for a second.” Sam signs ‘Sorry’, but he has no idea how to translate ‘zoned out for a second.’ Luckily, Eileen lip reads insanely well. Fortunate, given Sam’s struggles with sign language. The grammar trips him up more than anything — he’s not used to thinking about words like that — but he does get signs wrong, too. He’s never going to live down the time he tried to say “It’s a Japanese spirit” and somehow signed “It’s a vagina ghost” instead.
Cassie’s hand comes out and rests on Dean’s, her wedding band glinting in the harsh light of the diner. When he makes eye contact with her, she has a soft smile. It’s another thing Cassie and Cas share: a kind face.
No. He’s kneeling, Sam collapsed into him. Dean’s hands are slick with Sam’s blood, desperately trying to plug a stab wound that won’t stop bleeding. He’s kneeling, and Sam’s fists are beating him with distant eyes. He’s kneeling, and Cas’s fist is breaking his bones.
He fishes out his phone to read Sam’s response — “Don’t see it.” followed by, “Maybe it slid under the seats?”
Some things about Cas are as similar to Dean as Dean’s own hands, but Cas is a vast, evolving landscape, a being utterly
Dean has exactly 5 seconds to panic while he tries to figure out what he's going to show Jack before he's ripping off his flannel shirt and rolling up his left sleeve.
Cas is at once the most familiar thing to him in the universe and the most strange. Dean’s never going to understand all of Cas, never going to know perfectly what makes him tick, never going to understand the total landscape of Cas’s being.
The song continues — gentle, kind even. The words are like a kiss, or a hug. A hand cupped gingerly around his cheek. Some painfully soft thing that nonetheless slides under Dean’s clothes, peeling off anti-possession tattoos and emptying him out inside. Hurts.
Then, because Dean has always known exactly what to say to Sam, he adds, “I want you to be happy. I —” He falters, but perseveres. “I don’t necessarily get it, but this magic thing, if you want to pursue it, I’m not gonna stop you from being who you are.”
He’s rough. He can even be mean. He’s got dark corners. But, Dean loves his family. He loves his family so much, he sloughs off prejudices he should otherwise have because he looks at the people around him purely to love them wholly and completely for who they are.
“No. Uh — no. You look great. Comfy.” Goddamnit Dean. “I just meant — you don’t, uh, you don’t have to, if you don’t want to.” Dean casts for something less disastrous to say and somehow lands on, “You should dress for you, y’know? However you want to dress.” Dean catches the edge of Cas’s smile and averts his gaze before he says something stupid, like ‘it’s beautiful how your smile starts in your eyes’.
Dean flips to the other paper, convincing himself that it’s allowed. Cas’s angular script reads “14. Resilience.” Dean feels the weight harden into iron within his chest. The anchor of his heart finds purchase and pulls down.
Eileen asks him if he’s going to finish his eggs, so he pushes them away in disgust. She laughs, but when she takes a forkful of them herself, she grimaces at the taste. She looks at the plate in confusion, clearly wondering how they managed to fuck up something as simple as eggs.
Instead Dean says, “I know you want to yell at me about going off on the kid. Just get it off your chest now — I got shit to do.” Dean stills himself into a perfectly casual stance. It’s not like anything Sam says is going to surprise him.
People are going missing in Tulsa. He shoots Eileen a simple confirmation and doesn’t think twice about it.
This step takes more time because it requires convincing Dean that he wants to set up with a sniper rifle instead of knocking on the door, but the challenge is mostly finding a nest Dean thinks is appropriate. Dean has been happy to do this hunt the Eileen way, but he also has opinions about what makes a good nest. Eileen doesn’t mind. She’s not the one taking the shot.
rounds the corner, smiling wide; rumpled and stupidly gorgeous in Dean’s own Blue Öyster Cult tee, bare feet peeking out from under a pair of worn, slightly too-long jeans.
The man barks a laugh, seemingly startled into it. Castiel sways another few inches left. “Easy there, homeslice. I’m not here to hurt you.”
Gabriel breaks first, tsks and looks away with an absent sort of nod. “Okay. Yeah, sure. Of course you did.” He sways to the right, then a half-step left; a need to move with no real place to go. “And let’s say you do get it back— What exactly is the plan, here? What do you think you can do?”
The man abruptly stands, and Dean’s initial excitement fades as he realizes the guy isn’t just surprised Dean knows ASL, he’s
Cas looks his fill, gratifyingly greedy. Dean thinks he knows how Cas feels; still can’t fully believe this is whole thing is real. It’s a little bit scary and a whole lot of hot and Dean needs something – anything, anything Cas’ll give him – inside him as of right the fuck now.
“I promise to respect you in the morning,” Cas says, exaggeratedly sincere, and pulls him down for another devastating kiss.
Dean safeties the gun and tucks it into the holster taped under the war table. He drags over his tablet and sits, intent on going through the morning news.
Jess only smirks and slips a hand down the front of her jersey, comes out with a silver flask. Both brothers bark a laugh. “I’ve got it covered.”
Cas’s eyes narrow in on the cup in Dean’s hold. A moment’s hesitation, and his hand slowly lifts, placing the note to the counter and sliding it towards Dean.
“Hey, that’s on you,” Dean says, pointing an accusing finger. “You know how Mom and Uncle Bobby get after a couple glasses’a egg nog. The fuck do you even put in there?”
Whatever it is, it’s coming from the bunker’s gym, the door cracked and light spilling from the bottom. At this hour? Dean steps to the door, pushes it open and it’s Cas, standing back to the door and hands braced to the far wall. He’s shirtless, pants low on his waist and shirt, jacket, tie and trench a pile at his feet. His legs are braced in a wide vee and his head is bowed, shoulders tense, and Dean can’t help but notice the distracting flex of muscle, surprisingly toned, as Cas’s hands clench and unclench from fists against the wall.
“Dude, shut up,” Dean grumbles into the mouth of his own longneck. Eileen sends him an exasperated look from her armchair sat adjacent to Sam and Dean on the couch. Expert lip reader or no, not even Eileen can make sense of Dean’s mumblings when he falls into his deep-rooted habit of covering his mouth when he’s stressed or embarrassed. Dean’s been working on it.
“Only when there’s nothing good on cable.” The Trickster turns, knocks a foot to the newly-installed baseboards. The runes and sigils engraved on their backs begin to glow; an eerie, fire-red blaze of power visible straight through the wood. “That’s some impressive warding you’ve got there. Was gonna pop in, pop out – you’d never even know I was here. But you’ve got even
the cup informs, along with an atrociously lopsided sketch of a fresh cookie, though Cas probably got the gist.
Days of research and worry, and Dean finally dares to leave the relative safety of the panic room. Only a few days more before the restlessness and quiet and
“The coffee was excellent,” the man compliments, which Dean accepts as his due, because of course it was. “My sister and I were glad to discover you,” he continues, a hint of slyness re-entering his expression.
“Dean,” Cas repeats on a growl, taking full advantage of Dean’s momentary distraction to sneak a hand around to palm at Dean’s ass, canting his hips up as much as he’s able with his legs still effectively pinned and getting a whole lot of nowhere. “You interrupted me.”
long while. If there was a power so great any which where on this great green Earth, I would know. Try again, mate.”
Dean dares to feel a spark of hope, deep in his chest. “Three thirty,” he says, then breaks out in a grin, wholly unrepentant. “Usually.”
Dean grins, leans back for the room to clap Castiel on the shoulder. “Should’ve told me sooner, Cas!” Dean exclaims, ignoring Sam’s pointed look his way at his sudden exuberance. “I’ll show you the ropes.”
“Your damnation was Heavenly prophecy,” Castiel imparts. Best to say it plain. “You are the Righteous Man. The Michael Sword. Dean, you were meant to start the Apocalypse.” He drops his eyes to the floor. “I couldn’t let that happen.”
. It’s how they ended up here in the first place, isn’t it? Dean can bullshit with the best of them; sell it under
”) “You’re gonna damn well learn how to use it.” The hunter reaches under the seat to jerk at the lever, sliding back the whole of the front bench and badly startling Castiel with the unexpected jolt of movement. “And, hate to break it to you, but this town’s really not that big. You just got yourself kicked out of the only joint that’s got the professionals at work.”
Dean cracks a laugh and again knocks at Sam’s leg, fondness and pride welling past the point of containment. “Wow. Just…congrats, man.”
Castiel looks to Gabriel, now sitting opposite, arms crossed and slumped tiredly to the kitchen table. Castiel again lifts the bottle, an offer, and Gabriel rolls his eyes even as he conjures a second glass to rest between them.
lighting up the screen, thumbs open his messages. He holds the phone low and close, containing its glow as best he can in the soft and warm spaces between his body and the covers as he navigates to his saved text drafts.
“Daisies,” Cas says, low enough that Dean almost doesn’t catch it over the surrounding din of evening shoppers. “For purity, and…” he trails off and a smile steals its way onto his face, small at his mouth and obvious in the eyes and somehow more expressive than he ever was as an angel. “New beginnings,” he concludes, hand falling to Dean’s clenched at his sleeve, gently pulling him away to thread their fingers together, easy and sweet.
Juan accepts Castiel at his word, and Castiel steps forward to smooth a crumpled piece of paper to the counter. “Please, I realize it’s late and this will take time, but I must receive these marks as soon as possible.”
” Shouting, now, and Castiel very nearly rolls his eyes. He’s fine, then. “What the hell were you thinking, Cas! It could have killed you!”
“Yes. In Roman myth, Jupiter – the king of the Gods – became infatuated with a young woman named Callisto. When Juno, Jupiter’s jealous wife, learned of the affair, she went into a rage and transformed the beautiful Callisto into a bear. Now Jupiter, lover or not, was not well known for his compassion, and that may have been the end of it – Callisto resigned to her fate. But, you see, Callisto had a son…”
The Smiting itself is beautiful in its intensity; a fierce and terrible cacophony of light made physical, impossible heat and the roar of power so great as to easily drown out the screams of the Damned. Castiel hears them, regardless.
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean.” Cas says, serenely sipping his newly-acquired beverage. “If you wish to hunt, then I will come with you. If you wish to return with me to Chicago, we could do that, too.”
And with that, she gives a single sharp nod, seemingly satisfied to have put yet another unruly waste of space rightly in his place. Another round of titters ripples through the room; giggles and whispers and unsubtle side-eyes, blood in the water. Dean sinks deeper in his seat, the hard edge of the chairback scraping roughly up his spine.
Castiel huffs a laugh at Gail’s effusiveness, and tips his head to indicate the colorful cluster of jam and jelly jars along the bench. “Unfortunate, yes,” he says, overly sincere. “Though I’m glad to see your loss of stock hasn’t negatively affected today’s turnout.”
“The Big Dipper is, in fact, an asterism. It consists entirely of the seven brightest stars of the larger constellation Ursa Major. ‘The Great Bear.’”
The door opens under Dean’s hand and he stumbles back, reentering the blank hallway and shutting the door tight on Cas’s troubled features.
That catches Dean so off guard it takes him a second to work through it, surprise and disbelief. “Seriously?”
Stupidly Cute blows a sigh and starts rifling through one of the books he’s laid out. “Yeah, no, it’s weird,” he says. “Usually if they’re this animate it’s…you know, their anger.”
, okay. He’d made up his mind, and he’d have gone whether Cas had stayed asleep or not. No reason to wake the guy, right?)
“Today I’ll have the raspberry vanilla latte,” Cas says, with an air of determination and an odd sort of emphasis on
“I much prefer the parks,” Castiel hums as he begins to browse through Gail’s stock. He picks up a jar of spiced pumpkin butter, squinting dubiously at the hand-inscribed ingredients label before gently placing it back on the stand. “How are the hives?” he inquires, sure as clockwork.
Dean casts a look around and realizes he’s walked in exactly the opposite direction of anywhere he knows to be, nowhere near the park on Hale or the 7-Eleven off Main or the pizza place exactly halfway between the school and the apartment, the one with the $1.00 slices and a Ms. Pac-Man tucked tight in the corner. There’s no reason to wander too far, nowhere to be, and Dean spots a diner, across the road and a street down. On an impulse he makes for the squat square of a building, wide windows and corrugated roof, the same unassuming silhouette of a hundred, two hundred all-too-similar highway stops that have come before.
The ingredients of the summoning burst into flame, unexpectedly high and bright, and Castiel raises an arm to block his eyes from the sudden searing light. The roar of the fire quickly dies, and he cautiously lowers his arm, blinking away the dancing red-yellow-white orbs obscuring his sight.
“I have to go,” the man says, vowels falling flat in his rush to get out the words, and Dean is stunned to hear the evidence of what he suspected. “I’m sorry.”
Cas breaks away with a hoarse, greedy noise and attaches his lips to Dean’s jaw, leaving Dean to blink dazedly at the ugly, water-stained ceiling and attempt to gather his thoughts in the relative reprieve.
The village reeks of death and desperation; the area in ruin. Many previously habitable buildings have collapsed under the strain, and the ground itself is more slurry than traversable earth. The food stores have long since been lost to the damp, the livestock soon to follow, and the people forced to leave in a futile migration East. Castiel surveys those who’ve remained; some in hope of Salvation, many simply too sick to travel.
“You speak to me of fear, injury, loss and loneliness. You once detailed to me the process behind hot-wiring a vehicle! You have no
“I love you.” Cas holds out his arms again, this time in obvious invitation. “And you want me.” Like it really is just that fucking simple.
The Trickster, now only a step away, rolls his eyes at Castiel’s expression. “Relax, I put them back where I found them. Eventually.”
The hostess giggles. “Not a problem. Your server will be with you shortly!” She steps away, headed back the way they came. Dean turns to the table and settles more comfortably in his seat.
It takes a distressingly long time for Castiel to work past the frantic whirl of his thoughts to parse out Gabriel’s words.
Cas’s hands come up to tuck Dean away and straighten his pants; Dean’s hold on Cas’s shoulder shifts to help pull the angel to his feet. They stand together, both grinning like idiots and suddenly it’s the easiest thing in the world for Dean to sway forward and catch Cas’s swollen lips with his own. It’s soft and sweet and stupidly awkward because they’re still fucking smiling but it’s good, it’s right, it’s
“Yes,” Castiel intones, seeming to have collected his cool now that they’re talking business. “It must look exactly the same. That’s very important.”
much to look at. The focus is obviously the tattoo, a bold flaming pentagram in black, but there’s something about the rest of the shot – a smattering of freckles, the shadow of collar bone, the tight stretch of neck that meets the curve of one toned, bare shoulder – that seems
Castiel’s fists unclench in painstaking increments. He takes a slow, fortifying breath. “My name is Castiel Ja—”
Castiel runs a finger down Dean’s cheek, all reverence and awe and practically glowing in his happiness. “Yes,” he says, soft and sure. “That’s what I want.”
At that, Sam can only look pointedly to where Dean’s been bouncing his foot from some unknown agitation for at
Castiel feels the bite of nails into the meat of his palms, the small pain a grounding and welcome sensation; a damping rod to his fear. “I know many things the Winchesters do not,” he says, halting, entirely unsure what is safe or unsafe to reveal in a situation such as this. “Theoretical knowledge, at best, though I’m glad my efforts have proven…” he eyes the feathers littering the floor, “effective.”
Sam keeps talking, some nerd thing about shadowing in the courtroom but Dean barely hears him, focus momentarily consumed by the feel of Castiel’s warm, broad-palmed hand held in his own. The hand slips away and Castiel smiles, small and secret, before turning to slide into his seat at Dean’s side.
Dean’s nose scrunches in marked disapproval. “That ain’t right,” he says. “God invented soap for a reason, buddy.”
“And you’re driving,” Dean says, turning back to face the bar, reluctant smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “Hell no am I leaving Baby in a fuckin' lot.”
Crowley takes one look at Gabriel and the woman then stumbles, a single sigil at each of the room’s four corners flaring to life. A man gone to take a step only to find his shoelaces knotted as one.
Castiel slowly, carefully, draws his coat back up around his shoulders. He steps forward, feet whisper-soft and following the barely-there hum of sound, the familiar cadence of the TV advertisement for a local divorce attorney. He peeks cautiously around the hall wall and immediately spots the man, his head clearly visible over the back of the couch he’s sat on.
Dean stops those particular thoughts right in their tracks, not giving them the chance to spiral, but can’t help the “Cas—” that breaks free, stripped far too bare to fit the moment. He lifts a hand to find Cas’s face; one finger trailing the line of his jaw, the whorl of his ear. “Tell me what you look like.”
“Yeah, I think so,” Sam goes back to clicking around on the laptop. “I mean, there’s a lot of activity here. Leaving messages, moving things, showing up in and around the house, the whole nine yards. It’s almost sad,” he pauses, frowns. “She’s really obviously
The hunter runs a critical eye over the angel, taking in the loosened tie and half-open shirt, hair that’s moved past its usual windswept and straight into ‘fuck me’ mussed. None of which Castiel has bothered to set to rights since they left the club, Dean notes with some amusement.
(“Sam,” Cas hisses, crouched at the back-rear tire of his pickup and peeking out over the bed. “He’s coming back.”
Cas smiles, crooked and small but his eyes give away the game, lit so bright with his happiness Dean might just burn up to see it. “Good,” Cas says, then, in one smooth move, slips his phone out from his jacket pocket. “Now, can I get your number?”
The guy squares up to Dean front-and-center, and Dean’s halfway to an apology when he catches Dean’s eye and holds, not looking angry so much as calculating. He reaches out and calmly retrieves the mocha from Dean’s hold, still hovering awkwardly over the counter between them.
“The cow jumping over the moon!” the boy says, perking up slightly. Mary laughs, then sucks in a short breath as she drops a hand to her belly, rubbing circles. The Dean in her lap sits up excitedly. “Is the baby kicking, mommy?”
Off comes the boot and Dean straightens, arching out his back in a stretch and shuffling forward to clear the entryway into the living room, Gabe hot on his heels.
“Dean, this is Cas,” Sam continues, completely oblivious to the fact his brother is apparently suffering a minor stroke. “Castiel Novak. He’s a junior partner.”
Dean snorts indelicately into Cas’s hair, bringing up a hand to smooth it or ruffle it or just to have something to hold onto, who the fuck knows. But whatever his intention is, it’s derailed by the fact that his fingers get tangled in the goddamned blindfold he’d somehow forgotten was even there.
proximity to the university, Juan’s usual clientele tends towards nervous co-eds and stoned grad students. Not, if he had to guess, 30-something businessmen.
“Monsters are real, the world’s a goddamned scary place, and oh yeah, I’m a dead man walking. Nice knowing you, pal.”
“Dude,” says Sam. He leans in from his seat, and his chair — cheap, sun-brittle and one of many lining the wall — creaks and cracks under the man’s considerable weight. Sam seems unconcerned, and Castiel pushes down his sudden alarm. “Was it true she had her brother assassinated so that her son by Caesar could take the Ptolemaic throne?” Sam asks, bright-eyed and eager. “No, wait, did she really kill herself with a poisoned hair comb? No,
a pretty face, Dean notes, brain catching up with his body; both on the redhead and her man, the striking blue eyes and the unusual, still sense of focus.
The Trickster snorts. “Believe me, this is the most well-protected fortress against all things weird this side of the equator. Which begs the question,” he fixes Castiel with a piercing look, “who the
“Stop,” Cas barks at the wall, not quite angry but something close enough, and then the air goes thick and electric-sharp and there’s that noise, again, louder than Dean’s ever heard but there’s no mistaking it.
Stupidly Pretty – Dean, apparently – casually flips his companion the finger. “Shut it, Sam,” he quips, but nevertheless drops the hand holding his cell to his lap. “Just showing Cas what
“You train your operatives well,” Castiel says, infused with false calm. The demon quirks a questioning brow. “The first, she held out to the end. The second, though,” Castiel trades the ceremonial blade for a clean, folded scrap of cloth. “Only a few words of the Old Enochian purification, and he was remarkably happy to share all I’d needed to know.” Castiel drops his eyes to begin wrapping his palm with the cloth, stemming the now sluggish flow of blood. “I killed him quick,” he assures, and again meets the demon’s considering gaze. “The third was just insurance.”
They see the news, and not five minutes later Ruby shows up to basically rip them a new one. Dean doesn’t want to hear it, leaves Sam to herd Ruby outside in favor of sitting on his shitty motel bed, with its shitty cowboy patterned comforter, head-in-hands, punishing himself further with the continued murmur of the local coverage of the morning’s events.
Castiel, who had marginally relaxed upon registering the intruder’s identity, again tenses at the other’s demand. He guardedly steps around the desk, one hand out in a placating gesture. “Dean,” he cautions.
Terminator. TNT. 6 tonight. Tune in and we can educate your alien ass because honestly, HOW have you never seen this movie?
Dean feels carefully over the package’s contents – thick fold of bills, small bundle of protective herbs, and an iron obfuscation charm which should prevent anyone at the post office from looking too closely, not unlike the one they keep in the Impala to avert unwanted attention. He tucks inside a slip of a note –
“Beer run,” Dean declares, standing some five minutes after the first pitch. Sam starts to go for his wallet, awkwardly rocking to the side to get a hand underneath him, and Dean waves him off. “Nah, I got it.”
Dean snorts and rolls his head towards Castiel; who is, of course, staring right back. “It ain’t just me, buddy. If we’re talking Humanity’s Greatest Hits, sex is pretty high up there.”
“Hey,” Sam says, breaking the sleepy silence, “hand me my phone, would you? We haven’t checked them in, like, a week.”
Both Sam and Dean rubberneck up to the jumbotron, where there they are, Dean and his brother cozily leaned into each other and framed by an obnoxious, sparkling pink kiss cam heart.
in a way Dean’s definitely not imagining and, in an unexpected flurry of motion, Cas’s free hand swings up to smack unerringly to the brand on Dean’s shoulder. And Dean, Dean’s world
Castiel frowns down at his chest, hand dropping to the undone buttons of his shirtfront. “She…” he says, low, and hooks his fingers into the fabric, drags it open to expose more of his chest and, yeah, this time there’s no mistaking the hitch in Cas’s breath as his nails scrape over something small and round and dark, still mostly hidden in the shadow of fabric.
The bouncing stops with a noise of disgust and Dean levers himself off the bed, stalking over to the mini fridge to snag his fifth beer of the night. He passes Sam with a grumbled, “Whatever,” before settling back in to pretend to watch some shitty episode of
Cas pulls away, and Dean’s cracked whimper of urgent protest turns into a belly-deep moan as Cas sinks down on him, once again taking Dean into the perfect damp heat of his mouth. Cas’s free hand goes to Dean’s hip at the same moment Dean’s drops to brace to his shoulder and then Dean’s thrusting recklessly into him, chasing down every ounce of pleasure Cas’s mouth can give.
There’s a lot of things that hide in the dark, Cas. Nightmares are real, and it’s our job to kill them.
“No, not at all!” the woman says, a smile back in her voice, and she steps forward to offer Dean her elbow. She slowly guides the way through the small indoor space of the café and back outdoors, the smell of greenery and gardens and the twitter of small, fat birds hopeful for crumbs.
Dean pulls out the chair and gingerly sits, collapsed cane tucked into his lap. He grins up towards the general direction the hostess should be. “Thank you, sweetheart. ‘Preciate it.”
And this chick, Dr. Hart, is this super hot cardiovascular badass who’s like, totally trying to poach Dr. Sexy.
– for Dean and humanity. And that’s something Dean’s still having a hell of a time wrapping his head around. Dean knows he’s done fuck-all to deserve it, knows he’s the last guy you’d want to hitch your hopes on. Hell, he’s already failed once, at that goddamn convent – always just that bit too little, too late.
Dean is suddenly pulled from his thoughts when Sam, lounging in bed, grabs the remote and mutes the television; the low babble of the evening news easily ignored except in its absence.
Whoever’s sat in the booth adjoined to Dean’s ordered bacon and eggs, pancakes and a side of hash. He knows because he saw it delivered, two plates to hold it all. He knows because he can
“Wait, just…wait. You did some digging, right? I get it, no way you’d buy what I’m selling if you didn’t. So how ‘bout this. We ran into another shapeshifter case in Milwaukee, back in…uh, January, I think. Look into it, okay? The news reports that clued us in on it
“Fuck,” Dean curses, but doesn’t tell Cas to stop; instead turning to drop his head to his hands clenched tight on the steering wheel. Gathering his thoughts, the hunter runs through the – unfortunately few – available options for dealing with a horny angel.
“Dean,” Cas says, rasping, the tinge of a plea, and lays a cautious hand at the crown of Dean’s head, fingers threading through Dean’s hair, grounding and good. Dean’s lips part, a long, shaky inhale of breath and he thrills to smell something dark and sharp and male, stronger by the second. Blinding anticipation builds in Dean’s chest as the heady scent of arousal overwhelms his senses: skin, and salt, and damp and—
, like Dean about to get clocked one by her possessive boyfriend is the best thing that’s rolled around all year.
“Broccoli,” the man states, eyes still to the menu but now with a thoughtful air to the tilt of his head and lilt in his voice, low and smoky-rough.
Shitty lie aside, Dean’s thoroughly confused look around the breakfast café and subsequent distrust of their food is frickin’ hilarious.
, Dean knows he raised him better than that. “He did good,” Sam replies, chipper. “I took it pretty easy on speed, but we got in way more distance than I thought we would.”
Cas immediately moans into it, rumbling deep and, hello, uses the grip he has on Dean’s hair to tip his head straight back, opening him up for the kiss to go hot and dirty and perfect, Cas taking absolute control. And Cas isn’t fucking around, kisses like man starved, a man at worship; decisive and
” Dean says, stricken. “What the hell are you talking about? Angels? Prophecy? The goddamn Apocalypse?” He makes a wild, sweeping gesture in Castiel’s general direction. “And you— What, you really want me to buy in that you’re, you’re a—”
“If you say so.” The man tucks away the pen and notepad into the recesses of his apron, says, “The name’s Sonny. Holler if you change your mind.”
” she gasps, and Castiel must restrain himself from recoiling further to hear the creature speak his name. “I-I know you, and you— You know me, you do,” she continues, frantic. “My name is Ruby, and I’ve been helping Sam, Dean.” Ruby. Castiel stares into her wide, frightened eyes and recalls all Dean’s told him of the demon who’d freely offered her assistance on a number of the brothers' hunts. “I swear, call Sam, just call him, I’ve done nothing but help—!”
Shit, Cas, I’m such a dick. I had to stash my phone for a few days. I’m back, we’re okay, and everything’s cool.
Castiel is behind his desk, mindlessly filling out the day’s paperwork, when a soldier bursts into his chambers with such violence Castiel is instantly on his feet, alert and ready to face whichever new threat or crisis has chosen to present itself.
Castiel makes the cut, firm and swift, but can’t quite help the punch of air that escapes him as he does; this body (he, himself,
“Damn right,” Gabriel huffs, tipping his head to the back of his chair to smile wide to the ceiling, or maybe the universe at large. “So, what’s next?”
A slight, brunette stranger pokes her head out around one of the tall dividers of the common workspace. “Hi,” she says, chipper tone belied by wary eyes, “can I help you?”
Dean’s left alone to the quiet, eyes to Cas’s abandoned pile of clothes and brain slowly ticking away.
, Cas who is nothing if not frank and honest and true – at least where it matters, at least where his own thoughts and feelings are concerned, because he never learned any different, never learned that people know shame and hide certain parts of themselves for fear of being burned – and the next thing Dean knows his hands are at his belt, frantic in his need to grasp at what’s being freely and knowingly offered by the literal angel at his feet.
“Well, yeah…” Sam says, tone swinging from teasing back to concern. “But that’s a really big time commitment. Not to mention you’re not exactly…qualified, you know? Shouldn’t he sign up for an actual class?”
The redhead reaches the door and shoulders it open, and the next second they’re gone, down the street and away. But there was absolutely no mistaking it, not a chance. The look to Dean, right as the man walked out the door. The barest moment, there and gone; the spark on something bright, teasing and triumphant.
– warring with the sick, physical dread that rises with even the thought of having to endure a single minute more.
Sam jerks like Dean just hit him with a cattle prod. “Oh, um, this is Jess. She’s one of our court reporters.” Jess leans forward to see around Sam’s massive frame, long curls falling loosely over her shoulder. Dean does the same, offers a small wave. “Jess, this is my brother, Dean.”
Cas’s hand immediately comes up, curved around the back of Dean's thigh and fingers tight to halt any burgeoning thoughts of retreat.
“Wow. Yeah,” says Stupidly Cute, turning away from the laptop and calling Stupidly Pretty’s attention from his phone. “I think Cas is right on this one.”
“I’m…hah, fuckin’ peachy. You said— Shit, Cas, you said you wanted to hear, right? You wanna listen?”
Dean fumbles for the latch on the glove compartment and digs out his and Sam’s cells. He blindly tosses back the Blackberry – “
Cas comes in at mid-day, same as almost every Wednesday for the past four months, because Cas insists team meetings are best endured following a liberal dose of caffeine. Because Wednesdays are Cas’s weekly storyboard meetings. Because Cas is in marketing. Because these are things, apparently, Dean now knows.
“May I come in?” Castiel asks pointedly, and Dean seems to shake out of it, stepping back to allow him access to the room.
Dean’s eyes catch on Cas’s hand, white-knuckled on the pen he holds, and Dean doesn’t really know what to say, here. He only knows what he’s heard from the news – knows that over a hundred American military and civilian lives were lost in the attack, and that the survivors were very much in the minority – but he honestly hadn’t given it much thought past the initial shock; the acute sympathy for lives lost, the
Dean makes to pull his way up from where he’s ended up folded into Castiel’s chest; clumsily pawing at Cas’s shoulders for leverage until he can more-or-less faceplant into the top of Cas's head, lazily nosing at his hair and pressing soft kisses to the tousled strands. “Was awesome,” he says drowsily. “You’re awesome.”
Juan pulls back and raps a knuckle against the counter. “So, you know what you want? Or do you wanna look at some of my books?”
” Dean says. “Four months, then I’m gone. I should’ve never—” he swallows hard, and can only hope the dark of the late hour conceals his white-knuckled grip on the wheel. “I should’ve stepped back as soon as the deal was made, should’ve never dragged Cas in.”
Dean’s palm skims Cas’s chest to rest flat against his left pec. His thumb lightly brushes a peaked nipple and Cas’s breath catches so gorgeously Dean does it again, then again, smile hidden into the curve of Cas’s shoulder as the other man’s hips involuntarily twitch forward, half-hard cock a sweet press into Dean’s abdomen.
“I’m glad you agreed to meet with me tonight,” he says. “I would very much like to get to know you.”
He has had no healings today, an unusual break in schedule as his name and rumored miracles spread farther by the day, and Daphne is currently out of the house, her own work and social obligations to attend to.
“Cheese,” Dean suggests, drawing the sharp attention of two separate shades of piercing blues. “Just...drown it in cheese, dude,” he continues, hesitant, suddenly afraid of overstepping by gracelessly tramping over the time-honored customer/server tradition of playing deaf and dumb to any and all chatter spouted in his general vicinity. He powers through in a nervous rush, “Better than broccoli salad any day.”
– “dark, with eyebrows to match.” Dean’s hand drifts, thumb smoothing the arch of one brow on his way to burying his fingers in Cas’s soft hair. Cas chuckles, chest rumbling at Dean’s back. “It’s a mess,” he confesses, then, with exaggerated accusation, “I blame you.”
Juan smiles, a slight flush creeping along his bronze cheeks. “Yeah, dude. I’ll do it,” he says, and Castiel is struck again by the kindness of this almost-stranger, the gratefulness he feels for it.
Dean attempts to bury his fluster under the busy work of ringing up the order and exchanging payment but, judging by the return of the man’s smirk, doesn’t much succeed. “Name?” Dean manages, and can only hope it doesn’t come out quite as strangled as he fears.
Dean keeps Cas’s gaze, not sure what he's looking for but must find, regardless, because he then asks,
, long and loud and his knees nearly give but Cas holds him steady, doesn’t let him fall. “Cas—” Dean gulps in desperate pants of breath and Cas’s hand never slows, “—tiel, Castiel, oh, fuck, Cas, I’m gonna, I—” and he does, comes so hard his vision sparks and oh, goddamn it, in his fucking jeans, to boot.
Both brothers turn towards the voice and Dean spots a young woman, waving from the second row off the rail. She’s beautiful, Dean notes, blonde and beaming, wearing white jeans and an oversized Dodgers jersey. Sam stumbles over his own feet on the next step down and a few things click into place.
Cas’s lips split on a grin, and he snaps playfully at Dean’s fingers as they fall to tap at his teeth. “I have a wide mouth,” he says, accepting the prompt. Then, with a thoughtful air, “Wide features in general, I suppose.” His own hand rises to wrap around Dean’s wrist, thumb warm at his pulse, holding him in place. “My lips are pink. Perpetually chapped, as you well know.” The lips in question graze Dean’s fingertips as Cas speaks, teasing and light. Dean shivers, and the fingers circling his wrist tighten in acknowledgement.
dissolved into an epic screaming match over all the risks Cas had taken since they’d talked last and Spanish Inquisition levels of interrogation over why Dean thought it was okay to sell his soul for Sam in the first damn place.
Cas responds, because Cas always responds to Dean, by sliding his hand to Dean’s cheek. Dean steals a few more seconds of peace from Castiel before speaking.
“Do you know when I first understood what it meant to be a family?” Dean doesn’t have to pull his hand away because Cas has released it. Without Cas’s support, it falls limply to his side. He puts it back on the desk, leaning back to buy himself a few safer inches. He can still feel the soft puff of Cas’s warm breath lingering over his knuckles. Retreating to the other side of the planet wouldn’t stop Dean from feeling the gravity of Cas’s pull.
This is true. Dean is glad he’d left a batch in the kitchen that night, otherwise he’d never have gotten a chance to try them at all.
Dean had been miserable. It was like his mask lay splintered across Cas’s chest, so Dean had pulled anger over — over something. Cas sometimes feels like he knows every nook and cranny of Dean’s heart, but other times, Dean is an incomprehensible tangle of features and feelings.
Sam looks down, and his face is all hard resolve. It’s him when he’s twelve saying, “I know dad’s not coming home,” and it’s him at 17 saying, “I’m going, Dean, you can’t stop me,” and it’s him before shooting Madison and before choosing to remember Hell.
Dean blinks, and feels his smile freeze on his face. He keeps his expression exquisitely still. Zadkiel is saying half the words like they’re experimental to his own tongue.
. He fishes out the paper to make sure he didn’t miss some explanation beyond what his brain is giving him.
Eileen likes to make fun of Sam for his atrocious signing, in such a way that Sam knows means she likes that he’s learning it. This time, Eileen responds with, “Good memory!” signing along.
Her relationship with Sam is going to get a bit awkward if she murders his brother in the middle of a crowded diner. What a hell of a way to go though. Definitely better than the last time.
over the music without freaking out, and he's even able to smile about it by the time Left Hand Free comes on.
Back to his headboard, Dean resolves to listen to the rest of the mixtape. Give Cas a better review than a stuttered “thank you” and put this whole thing behind them.
Dean killed him. Dean killed Benny, and Charlie, and every other person who would care enough to listen to him talk about this. Dean killed them. Dean killed them, and then he rode off into the sunset and went to concerts and diners and listened to mixtapes and drove around in the skin of a man instead of a monster.
“It was complicated,” Dean volunteers, just to give Claire a reprieve from Cassie’s probing eyes. He regrets it immediately when her gaze settles on him. God, it’s weird to try to find words to explain this situation to people. He tries to land somewhere close to the truth. “Cas was in the hunter life at that point, and he didn’t want Claire in danger. He doesn’t want to take the place of her father, but we, he uh, he cares about her a lot and wants her to be happy — whether that's with him or not.”
Dean, who probably used up all his words for the month at the beginning of the conversation, says next to nothing for the rest of breakfast. Then, Cassie is waving them off, as she needs to go to some meeting, and Dean is grabbing the waiter to get her a muffin, because Cassie had clearly gotten distracted by them being there and hadn’t eaten anything. Cassie laughs her beautiful laugh, and Dean spares a quick second thinking again how happy he is she’s alive, and then she’s gone like she was never there.
Dean is 2 hours away from the bunker, which he figures has got to be far enough, when he pulls over to fuel Baby up and fumbles the mixtape out of his pocket. The second mixtape.
Dean’s love is a dying thing, is what that means, and it’s not like Dean doesn’t know that. Dean’s love is good for dying. But Cas won’t let him do that. Cas is never going to stay — death will take him, or he’ll leave — and Dean can’t do anything about that. Nothing Dean says is going to make a difference. Why even say anything at all? He can’t change it either way.
Dean retreats to his room, takes the 2 seconds it requires for him to pack up, then sits on the bed, smiles, and slides on the headphones. Penny and Sparrow picks up and fades out from where Dean had paused it.
He walks the glasses over to the kitchen and puts them in the sink. Lets Kaia’s half step away wash over him.
, tiny and small. Dean does the only logical thing: he grabs the headphones in a meaty grip and chucks them full force away from him.
The lyrics of the next song come on almost immediately, and Dean feels his focus sharpen at the plaintive tone. The music picks up with the chorus. Dean tries to listen to the words, but he’s focused on how sad, how desperate it sounds. It’s somewhere near “the price was my life” or the aborted “you bastard, I believed in —” It’s
Dean's halfway through a sentence about trigger discipline when Jack gets excited about something and is shoving the gun into Sam's face while talking about wavelengths or some shit, and Dean is yelling at him before he can even think to have another response.
“Dean.” Cas said, and he was staring, and Dean knew, he just knew that this time it wasn't Cas saying his name to start a sentence. Dean's name WAS the sentence. But thank Jack for Jack, because Jack cut in before that sentence could get worse.
Last time, she’d been terrified, in pain, alone. This time is different. If she dies, she wants to be thinking about something beautiful. Something comforting.
A thrumming contentment resounds in Cas’s chest, and he recognizes it: Cas is happy with who he is. He’s made mistakes. Catastrophic, irrevocable mistakes. Nevertheless, looking at this — at the beauty of Heaven and his part in constructing it — he can’t help but be a little proud.
Dean’s not sure there is any version of him that could know Cas and not love him. He knows it's selfish. He gets that it’s too much. For a little while though, Cas had wanted him, too.
But all he can do is pull his eyes up from the horror before him, a desperate prayer. His only reply comes from the marionette strings holding Cas in place, wrapped around his neck, twining around his torso. Dean grasps at words, fighting desperately to tell Cas to fight, to
A few minutes of doing nothing later, he’s in the kitchen pulling out ingredients for lasagna because it’ll stay warm for whenever the girls get back. Not that it matters, because Donna’s truck pulls into the drive right as he’s taking it out of the oven.
Altogether, Dean’s a little surprised when he looks up from doing the dishes and finds Eileen sitting on the counter regarding him. It’s just him in the kitchen, so Dean pulls his hands out of the sink, dries them on a towel, and turns to look at Eileen with a questioning gaze.
Dean replays the song, over and over again. If he could memorise the words, he could find a way to be this way, to open his mouth and say
Dean’s left hand spasms around a phantom limb. He thinks about the way Cas's eyes flash when he's angry. Not with grace, just with beautiful, righteous anger.
Cas, because he’s a real fucking asshole, says, “I cannot...check in on you?” Dean, who knows he’s already lost this fight before it begins, just goes for it anyway.
and wonders, for the first time, if there is a version of his life where he gets this. Can keep this. Wonders, hopes, prays that Cas will wait for him long enough that by the time Dean gets there, Dean will be the kind of person who deserves it.
Claire conducts a slick hand off to Eileen while walking past her towards the snacks. Dean’s weirdly proud.
Sliding into Baby after breakfast, Dean promises Sam that he'll remember to grab lightbulbs from the hardware store, as well as Cas's weird quince paste from the artisanal bakery he's obsessed with. He asks Jack if he has anything to add, and the kid dead up asks for a stuffed unicorn plushie he saw on a TV ad, so Dean sighs and says he'll try.
Patience laughs out loud at that. Dean shoots her a wink. Alex rolls her eyes at him, but it's with clear affection. Eye rolling is basically a declaration of love with these girls.
Benny, who’d risked his life so that Dean could have Cas. Benny, who had let Dean send him to his death so that Dean could have Sam.
He keeps his eyes closed and pretends he’s driving, that Cas is still here, sitting shotgun, staring at stars. What would happen if Dean could turn to him and whisper, “No one has ever held me while I cried before,” if he could breathe, “Thank you for letting me be not alone for five seconds.” His mouth can’t form the words, but in his imagination, Dean turns to Cas and says, “I’m sorry I got angry. Sometimes I’m not sure I know how to feel anything but anger.” He drives them both somewhere beautiful. He says, “I love you,” and it doesn’t feel ripped out or stolen. It’s just another fact. Dean’s always been good about saying the facts. Dean smiles at Cas, and Cas smiles back, draping massive wings behind Baby. Maybe he could fly faster, but he wants to be in the car with Dean. Everyone is safe, and happy, and Dean is whole. Somewhere in the distance, their destination is a home. Maybe a beach. Maybe nothing but open road.
No, wait, they’re actually gone. He looks back to Cas, who is wringing the reconstituted headphones between his hands, twisting them so hard that they may actually snap again.
This is maybe the most romantic thing that's ever happened to him, and Cas just casually dropped it in his lap.
Dean gets a fitful four and a half hours of sleep. His thoughts are too loud, his bed still too big. He’s still thinking about Patience, trying so hard to be the perfect daughter but unwilling to give up on who she is. He’s thinking about Jack, who only ever wanted Dean’s approval and barely gets gruff words. He’s thinking about how young they both are, how bright and beautiful.
Sam feels something unfurl in his chest, but it catches. He remembers ‘If I didn’t know you, I would want to
He doesn't even have lungs anymore. He's just a flayed open chest and a shaking hand gripped tight around a coffee cup that should be a gun.
But Cas loves Dean back. I mean, Sam knew Cas loved Dean. They were best friends. However, there’s ‘best friends,’ and then there’s ‘moving whole mountains to make you smile.’
Her hand stops halfway to the ignition. There’s a box on the passenger seat with a note hastily scribbled atop it.
Dean’s hand reaches out on autopilot and pauses the tape. He climbs out of the car and walks into the craft shop, pulling the lyrics apart in his head.
He’s obviously not thinking straight, so he mistakenly reads thirteen, even though he hasn’t listened to it yet.
Eileen slams her hand on the detonator. The grenade inside the Marid’s head explodes, sending Isabelle crashing against the wall.
From over his shoulder, he feels Cas step closer to his bed — dithering like he might sit down. God, Dean desperately wants Cas to sit down. Almost as badly as he wants Cas to leave. Neither as badly as he wants to figure out what’s wrong with him, but close.
She can’t finish the sentence, now hiccuping quiet sobs, but Dean hears it anyway. If it’s not bad, why can’t her father accept it? If he can’t accept it, it must be bad. Her father is a good person. They can’t both be right.
“He’s tough as nails,” Dean agrees, since it's true. “And you’re right, he’s smart. Although, you wouldn’t believe the dumb ass plans he comes up with sometimes. I swear he’s never met a problem he didn’t think he had to solve himself.” Wait, that also kinda describes Cassie. Does Dean have a type?
Dean rewinds the song as he drives. It’s a sunny day, and the singer's voice carries a heaviness that makes Dean start when
The tail end of the song catches Dean so off guard that he doesn’t even think to stop the tape before the next song can start. The tape softly warbles out
Thankfully, Sam has his weird magic orgy retreat and Jack has book club, so Dean will be free of their eyes this weekend.
But Cas’s soft lips brushing against Dean’s knuckles punch his eyes open, rip open his chest, and leave his breath trapped in his throat.
Sam, for some reason, mumbles, “Well, it’s certainly convinced me,” as though Castiel wouldn’t be able to hear him speak under his breath while sitting directly across from one another. Cas can hear a sink dripping, in a bar, in China if he wishes. Unfortunately, hearing it does little to explain it.
It is, of course, way louder than he expects, so the first few beats are a scramble to lower the volume of sparkling synths.
His breath comes out in one long push. The first track is exactly what he thought. Some instrumental nonsense.
“First of all, never ever take romantic advice from Becky. She dated Chuck.” God. She really did date Chuck. Yikes. Poor Becky. Dean should send her a fruit basket or something. Would that be weird?
Dean wants to say, “I don’t want to stand between you and the things you want.” He wants to say he’s happy that Sam has found some modicum of peace, how he thinks Sam would be a great leader, that the hunter network is a great idea. He wants to tell Sammy how proud he is of him, and all the work he did, and how goddamn smart he turned out. The words get jumbled in the cavernous hollow of his chest because he sees it so clearly — Sam would be fantastic. Sam would be a great mentor. Dean can see what Sam will be doing, and how great he’ll be at it.
He doesn't even notice the careful quiet behind him. Jack's face beams so hard it might split open, Cas's eyes soften, and Sam's mouth morphs into quiet shock. Dean is too busy measuring flour to notice. He tosses a careless, “Hey, we just doing strawberries, or do we got other stuff people want in their pancakes?”
“Cleaning fee will probably be a bitch, but weirdly,” Eileen twirls a knife, “I don’t think it’s going to be a problem for you.”
He leans against the table, just next to where Patience is seated, and waits. She curls her hands around her mug.
He thinks about looking for a hunt, but Sam would bite his head off if he even considered going out solo. Instead, he grabs the bat phone and swings by his room to snag Mixtape 3 before sliding into the Impala.
Dean had gotten up off that floor, but he hadn’t wanted to. In a weird, perverse way, it had been good that Chuck had been alive and a threat because nothing less would have been enough to get Dean off that floor.
Sam can stuff his dumb crime podcasts where the sun don’t shine, though. Dean still has fucking taste.
The song settles, but Dean is scrambling to pull the headphones off his ears, trying to catch his breath. He keeps hearing
Dean rips the headphones off his ears, tossing them into Baby’s passenger seat, but he can still hear
So what if it’s too late now? So what if Cas is already gone? Dean can still become this version of himself. Still make himself better. Cas deserves that. Jack deserves that. Sam deserves that. Even when they all leave. He keeps going.
Does Eileen want to come? She’s been on the road for a while, and she’s getting a bit tired. On the other hand, accompanying Dean to kill a nest of four vampires won’t take much work on her part. Dean could probably handle that nest with his eyes closed.
It’s not that he believed that Dean would love lightly, but he had nonetheless been caught off guard by the wildness of receiving Dean’s affection. Dean’s soul is so bright with love. Even tarnished and tattered in Hell, it had shone like a beacon. To have that directed at oneself — Cas isn’t sure how he was ever supposed to repay that gift.
“He’s really bright,” Jack had reiterated, and Cas had waited patiently while Jack tried to select the appropriate words. “He’s so full of love, and he still hates me.”
Dean doesn’t even pause. Doesn’t rewind. Just drives faster and lets the next song play, his mind roaring with Cas’s voice, “I’ll be the one to watch you murder the world.”
Dean fast forwards and ends up halfway through Sleeping At Last’s cover. A thought briefly bursts through Dean’s growing uneasiness. Why a cover? Why not the original song? Where the fuck is Cas finding all this stuff? Why is Sleeping At Last’s voice so fucking clear and easy to hear?
Dean instead of killing Dean immediately. He feels a chill of horror at the idea of long fingers pulling at Kaia’s shirt instead of his.
Then, the night encircles the four of them watching Mamma Mia, making commentary and occasionally pausing to explain things to Jack and Cas, who both seem very confused about why she would care about the identities of her biological parents. They have a spirited debate for all of five minutes before they realize they're all saying that biology isn't the important factor and go back to watching the movie.
Because Cas didn't want that. He's in love with Dean, but he didn't want Dean. That's the only reason Dean could think of to not tell him sooner. To never plan to tell him.
The first song is peppy and upbeat and weird, which doesn’t surprise Dean at all, but mostly because he’s come to expect anything at all from these tapes. By the end of the first verse
Cas comes to look at the screen by standing way too close over Dean's right shoulder. He leans down to look. “A case?” Cas's voice is a pleasant hum.
Other times, it’s like a car accident at high speed or a fall from a great height. Sudden, terrifying, lashwise. Like today. Dean’s voice had come to him, high and thready, barely formed, a desperate edge to it that Cas had never heard before. The longing — Dean’s longing — had slammed into Cas like a physical force.
“Right! Well, Castiel and I talked, and I wanted to be here, and he wanted to be here. Here is what makes us happy."
She wasn’t even that drunk yesterday, but the combination of an adrenaline crash and the alcohol she did drink has left her feeling icky and sore. She packs the motel in a lackluster daze, most of her time spent making coffee and scrolling listlessly through her phone.
slams him right back to the floor of the fucking store room, with nothing to show that Cas was ever there except a bloody handprint on a jacket that he can't make himself wash or throw away.
But isn’t James trying? Doesn’t he love his daughter? He thinks about Patience saying ‘he doesn’t, at least not in the way that I need.’ James was willing to fight a wraith to keep his daughter safe. Isn’t that love?
Dean returns to himself in parts. First, his breath — loud and ragged in his ears before it settles. Then, his skin — the scratch of his cheek against Cas’s crumpled trenchcoat, the warmth of Cas’s embrace. Enough parts slot into place to identify the absurdity of trapping Cas underneath him to sob like a child. He thinks that it’s warm, safe, nice.
Donna’s very serious “better you than me” is somehow more terrifying than hundreds of threats levied at Dean in the past.
Uh, his metaphorical pants. His actual pants are absolutely staying on. Dean is going to stay fully pantsed. Dean glances at the clock. It's 2:15, there are 2 more songs after this one, and right now Castiel is driving him insane via Janelle Monae. The song ends, and Dean panic pauses the walkman with such force that he's worried he’s damaged the button for a second. He doesn't know how it could get worse, but he's somehow horribly certain that it will. In the silence, he thinks that Castiel actually never rebelled against Heaven and this is actually a horrible long con meant to drive Dean insane enough to say yes to Michael.
That afternoon, Jack had asked about love languages. The ensuing conversation had been disastrously chaotic, with Sam and Dean contradicting each other multiple times, Dean starting jokes that were inappropriate, seeing Jack in front of him, and stopping halfway through. Dean had made fun of it as hippie crap, but he’d also carefully answered all of Jack’s questions (another sign of affection that Cas pointed out to Jack later).
Sam’s frown persists. “You should really stop buying him that junk.” Dean should, but he won’t. He leans against the map table. Sam looks down at his phone.
Cas holds him, gently. Dean feels Cas all around him, safe in his grip. A warm weight encircles them, as if to hide them from the rest of the world. The last of Dean’s barriers shatter.
Like that, it’s settled. Dean has a hunt. He fishes out his phone to shoot Eileen said text, leaving to pack with a “witch me luck!”
“Castiel says nicknames are a sign of affection.” Dean flicks his eyes back to Cas before letting them settle, presumably, on Zadkiel.
Eileen does smile, and Dean marvels at how alive it makes her. She narrows shrewd eyes at him, then begins to sign back, though more slowly than she does with Cas. They shoot shit about nothing over breakfast. Dean has to stop multiple times to painstakingly finger spell words he doesn’t know, but it’s an easy conversation. Sam and Eileen called dibs on a salt and burn a couple towns over. Eileen said there was a nice dinner place nearby, and apparently that's what dating another hunter looks like — salt and burn for breakfast, fancy Indian fusion for dinner.
“Woah. Dean,” she says, her voice is casual, like Dean isn’t anything for her to fear. Dean draws in a ragged breath, knows he has to respond, knows he has to say something. Tries to remember how to lower the gun.
Dean would untangle his relationship with Jack in his own time, now that he was free to do so. Cas had complete faith.
Cas and the Winchesters against the world is familiar ground. Cas and Dean versus Dean’s demons is, too, in it’s own way.
The offering barely pulls half a smile across Patience’s face, which is better than Dean expected. She takes it as permission to put a healthy serving of whipped cream on her cup as well though, which Dean counts as a win.
Sam had stared at his brother, and only saw an abandoned well of sinking black. He couldn’t find Dean anywhere in the void. Sam had realised then that he was wrong when he thought Dean was just waiting to die. No. Sam was looking at a dead thing merely playing at being alive. So, he’d done the most selfish thing he could. The only thing he could think of that would work.
Dean has to tell Jack to go put Purple in his room so they can all have lunch, and Sam gives him a bitchface thats either “fuck you for this dumb cow” or “fuck you for agreeing to the name Purple because now I have a stuffed cow named Blue” or maybe just “fuck you.” However, Sam also barely waits for the nachos to cool before stuffing his face, so Dean knows he's forgiven.
The song is weird, okay. And Dean's trying to not go with the logical conclusion here that this song makes Castiel think of Dean because it's about how Dean
They make it to their destination in record time, not that their destination is much of anything —  just a strip of road where some of the bodies were found. The scenes are too weather torn and tire trod to be of much use, but they don’t have any other leads.
That’s, I mean, that’s gotta be about Cas being human, right? The strangeness, the isolation? C’mon, ‘grieving the loss of myself’ — what else could that be?
Hymnals peters out and the next song is one that Dean knows. Fuck, everyone probably knows it. It's fucking ABBA. It's Lay All Your Love on Me.
“Why?” Eileen asks, with a simple curiosity. Dean blinks in confusion at her, trying to figure out the question. Why is Cas teaching Dean sign? Or why is Dean learning sign? He figures it’s obvious, but luckily the answer for both questions is the same.
He’s really not looking forward to Hell. He occasionally wishes that he wasn’t going back there when he finally kicks it, but he hasn’t historically had success with getting out of it. He’s going to be better this time, though. He’s not getting off the Rack. He’s not going to be saved. No one’s coming to cure him. He’s going to hold out until it breaks him into dust.
When Eileen had texted Sam about this case, she’d thought there were only 6 victims, but when she’d dug into disappearances, there’d been one every 6 months for 10 years. That’s 20 potential victims, only 6 of which had been recovered. Whatever they’re after is definitely covering its tracks.
Kaia asks Cassie a question about her jacket, which is clearly an attempt to get the conversation anywhere else, but Dean is too grateful to call her on it. Cassie, mercifully, allows the conversation to move on.
But. Cas isn't human. Well, he's not human anymore. Sure, he'd had sex with April. Unbidden, Dean's mind pulls up Cas and a woman, in bed, and he spends another 10 seconds dragging his brain away from ascertaining if Cas had used his strength to pull his partner flush to him, to spread her out on a bed, to devour her…or if he'd let her set the pace, if he'd looked at her with wide blue eyes as she'd lowered herself onto him, and — goddammit.
Dean had tried, is the thing. Dean had tried to push Cas out of his life. He had let his anger fester between them, the only force strong enough to excise the part of him that desperately and pathetically wanted Cas around. It had almost worked. Almost.
His hands, rough, shove Cas away. The wind bites cold as he rips himself to standing. Cas’s blue eyes blink up in stunned confusion, and Dean feels a wildness settle. He clenches his fists like he has any chance of control.
Sam, briefly, toys with the idea of saying yes. Claiming that there is a hunt, then pretending to spend the weekend with Eileen while going to the lunar ceremony instead.
Dean turns the paper over on the table as the song starts to do something vaguely interesting with what Dean is pretty sure is a marimba.
Dean feels like an idiot, and he doesn’t want to say anything stupider, so he takes a big swig of his beer and looks away. He feels a bit warm, sitting in the sun as they are.
“Cassie, meet Claire and Kaia.” Dean says. Cassie, who already introduced herself to them but is a good sport, smiles and waves “Hi” again.
So, here it is. Once, a blue moon ago, when Dean felt Cas slipping through his fingers, when he knew he'd fucked up too much for them to ever be good again, he'd made Cas a mixtape.
“Sure, and I’m a trapeze artist named Marion.” Who the fuck? “Just text whatever you’re thinking about or don’t, dude. This wishy girly shit’s embarrassing. I’m embarrassed for you. You’re already dating.”
they sing, continuing with a painful clarity that Dean couldn’t block even if he knew what was coming
like that's not the final rune on the Ma’Lak box that Dean should climb in to throw himself to the bottom of the ocean.
Things go a little easier after that. Well, things between Dean and Eileen. The case continues to frustrate. A few hours later, Dean lazes on her bed, throwing out increasingly ridiculous ideas for her to catch and toss back. Clearly, they don’t have enough information to figure it out, but they’re enjoying trading lore and shooting the shit.
After about five minutes, Dean catches Eileen’s attention. “So, you’re bisexual,” he says, signing the same.
“Sure. But...you know where the guest rooms are, if you just wanna crash. Cas can take you wherever in the morning, if you need.”
He thinks about little goals, about creating yourself. Cas’s insistence that he’s better than he thinks he is. He thinks about fire.
“He is warded from sight, Zadkiel.” Cas responds, and yup — that frown of his is definitely growing.
Sam responds, “Looking sharp!” which is both embarrassing for him and also not helpful, so she sends him a quick smiley face with its tongue sticking out. Thankfully, Sam follows up with, “They’re tempered with Holy Oil! They make the invisible visible.”
to love him? Dean is the hammer that shatters fragile glass things like love. Dean takes good, lovely things and twists them until they snap.
Dean worries that he may actually be getting a bit of a sunburn as he feels growing heat on his cheeks, so he grabs the walkman and stuffs it in his pocket as he retreats to the shade.
Well, Dean certainly made a mess of that, didn’t he? Cas probably thinks he’s pathetic now. Dean is kind of pathetic now. Dean’s been kind of pathetic all along.
So, that was weeks ago, and things at the bunker have been normal. Good. Family dinners, hunting stupid shit, saving good people. Cas and Dean have fallen easily into a new normal, which is basically their old normal, but Cas doesn't hide what makes him happy and what makes him unhappy. It’s maybe a bit weird to adjust to this Cas, who is quietly pleased all the time — but for the first time ever, there isn't a great big evil to hunt, God is dead, and they are free. What's not to like? Finally, they have the time to enjoy their freedom. And Castiel and Jack seem to prefer using that freedom to hang around the bunker, watch weird television, and hang out with the Winchester brothers. This makes them happy.
Dean listens to his heart screaming through Bring Me The Horizon until he can’t anymore. He’s safely away from everyone, surrounded by wildflowers and weeds, so he lets the song loop one more time. If he’s going to detonate, better to do it here.
It’d come to a head two months in. Sam, exhausted and worried, couldn’t figure out why the fuck Dean had given up when they were finally free. Sam missed Jack, and he missed Cas, and he wanted to talk about it, but Dean wouldn’t let them. Dean barely spoke outside of work. On hunts, there was always something more pressing.
Cas had been aware. He’d known, of course: movie dates, secret smiles, late night chats. Cas had Easy A downloaded into his brain. He is familiar with the concept of dating. However, he hadn’t confronted the depth and strength of that emotion, and hadn’t prepared himself to be the object of Dean’s love.
, which Dean had happily sung along to not five minutes before. Here, in it’s softer repetition, hearing it again as if for the first time, Dean is struck by a thought.
Did Sam put Dean up to this? Does Dean have some ulterior motive? She thought Dean and her got along well. Eileen definitely enjoys Dean’s humour (and his cooking).
Claire mouths ‘a romantic?’ at him. Kaia chooses ‘Still?’ Dean realizes that these three meeting is actually the worst possible idea.
He’s freaking out. He knows he’s freaking out. Hell, Cas had apparently fallen in love with Dean while Dean was kicking him out of the bunker and beating him to Hell and back, so it should be pretty hard to mess this up.
Eileen fidgets. A cold wind sweeps over Dean’s shoulders and down his back. He loses several seconds reminding himself that there’s no way Eileen could know. Hell, even if she somehow divined the song playing, she wouldn’t know it's from Cas. Just in case, Dean settles more comfortably into Baby and accelerates. They’re so close to the motel. He can fucking see it.
“Don’t you understand? Can’t you see?” Castiel says, and Dean truly has no idea what Cas’s point is here. Like sure, Dean is willing to die for Sam. That’s hardly a secret. Dean doesn’t even think that was the first time Cas had run up on that character trait.
Dean. All of him. Cas knows who he is. Hell, Cas has taken the brunt of most of Dean’s flaws. Cas has paid the most for Dean’s mistakes.
Her phone lights up before she can work herself into a genuine concussion. The message is from Sam, so she opens it without thinking. For some reason, the video starts on Max. His smiling face fills the screen before the camera tilts over his shoulder. Eileen can see Sam, eyes furrowed in concentration, light flickering at the end of his finger tips in a fuzzy haze before slowly coalescing into the shape of a revolving rose. Sam’s eyes snap open. He startles himself with a delighted laugh, losing focus and scattering the light. Eileen can almost feel the rumble of his chest from here. She grins.
The heart drags itself down Cas’s arm in a trail of mangled flesh and blood. Dean glimpses a pale strip of bone before the teeth, unrelenting, sink through that as well. He can hear the crack of it breaking above his ragged breathing. He tries desperately to say something more, to break through to Cas, but he doesn’t have any more lines.
Dean had gathered Jack’s departure and Cas’s death, transforming them into a happy ending for Sam. Dean made himself live again because Sam had asked him to, casually leaving his own happiness out of the equation.
Dean swallows air, gulping oxygen. It’s not working quite right. Dead air sticks in his chest. Stiff fingers around his heart. Steel hook in his shoulder. Stagnant nothing in his —
“If it would help convince Dean, then yes.” Cas says, and then, because he figures seeking clarity has never been a bad choice with these boys, he adds. “Would moving Everest help convince Dean?”
There is no reason to be like this. There is no reason to act like this. Dean fumbles out the paper, looks down and reads the song titles, and realises two things. 1) He’s not sure who Sleeping At Last is, but he hates them. And 2) there is only one song left.
“Your signing is pretty good,” Eileen says, signing along. Dean snorts a laugh, because he knows talking to him in sign is probably a bit like talking to a foul-mouthed toddler for Eileen. She’s slow and careful in all her signs, which Dean appreciates, but he doubts it’s fun for her.
Benny, who’d smiled at him when he told him about Cas, who’d never asked so Dean would never have to say no, who’d just been there and been there.
“Dean.” Cas says, and it’s with enough grave importance that Dean feels his hands flex. Cas’s follow up of “I fear you may be getting visitors” does nothing to put Dean’s mind at ease.
Sam — because Sam is a good man, but not always great under pressure — says, “Uh, thank you? Is that...relevant?”
“Dean? Are you alright?” Cas says, his blue eyes never leaving Dean’s, like if he stares hard enough, he can do something before the black slides over them completely.
They used to gossip about Dean in Hell, said the Rack was waiting for his return. Eileen’s not positive what the Rack was, but it was only spoken of in hushed, reverent tones —  the kind that were never a good sign in Hell.
He can’t go to the bunker, and he can’t stay in the soft beauty of the field. He can’t do anything but sink lower into the driver's seat. When that's too comfortable, he pops in the mixtape and lets the love he destroyed pipe out of Baby’s tape deck.
The next song starts, and Dean doesn’t stop it, desperate for any distraction. He can’t look at “You Were Worth Falling For” in Cas’s handwriting anymore, so he flips back to the other and reads “8. Fire Fire by Flyleaf.”
Dean smiles. His mind flashes to the googly eyes covering Sam’s room. The song ends, and Dean rewinds it with a new appreciation. He goes a bit too far and catches the end of I See You, but he waits it out. When Rhumba for Peregrine starts again, Dean sees what Cas was trying to say perfectly. It’s the perfect song for sneaking into Sam’s room and putting hair dye in his shampoo. It sounds like sneaking around motel rooms and sticking weird things on Sam’s sleeping face.
Jody’s cabin is backed up against a lake. Dean, Sam, and Jody had spent a weekend here after the end of everything, coordinating locations and making sure everyone had made it back from Chuck’s final temper tantrum.
She makes some inane comment about the car in the driveway, and Dean graciously allows the change of topic. He immediately chips in with a scathing comment about the car’s safety rating, and then they’re off, ripping apart the architecture, the gardening — everything they lay eyes on. Eileen lets Dean make her laugh with his overplayed indignation about the shutters of all things, and by the time they get to the front door, she’s so busy trying to not make fun of the house to the owner’s face that she doesn’t even have time to dwell on dying.
Dean and Alex slice up fruit while Jody throws together sandwiches, and lunch is a happy affair, punctuated by the cryptic network of rituals that seem to govern the sisterhood of the household. Then, without really agreeing to it, everyone is heading off to nap, read, or pack.
Cas extends a quizzical head tilt. Dean spits out a rough, “It was all nothing,” fleeing the room. He's not sure if he means it about the cases or about his useless and bloody hands.
“Yeah, Zad? Your flighty angel sibling? The one you’re apparently letting walk you into Scylla’s mouth?” Dean replies.
“Cas would be right about that.” The corner of Cas’s eyes crinkles, and Dean feels an easy smile steal over his own face. Zadkiel’s face morphs into a new expression, but it's clear he’s new to emoting in a human body because it tries to do too many things at once.
Sam’s horrified bitch face is at least half the reason Dean makes puns like this. Disgust is it’s own reward.
She responds to goodbye texts from Dean, who left earlier in the morning to deal with the vampire nest, before getting sucked into Instagram reels just long enough for her coffee to go cold. She microwaves it while she packs up the room, tossing items around just long enough for her coffee to go cold once more.
“Your love is a selfless thing.” Cas cuts Dean off, again. Dean frantically revisits the part of the conversation where Cas had assured him that he didn’t have another deal. “I do not feel that way for you.”
Dean’s baking bread and making something that smells delicious, so Sam doesn’t push. Dean’s been cooking a lot recently. Sam’s not complaining, since he’s a great cook. Actually, he’s an amazing cook. Sam and Cas have a whole journal dedicated to his cooking experiments.
Jack doesn't have anything he needs to protect himself from except for Dean. Everyone around here is just too stupid to let the kid do that. Dean lets out a sharp breath through his nose. He reloads his gun with bloody fingers, checks to make sure that the safety is on, and holsters it.
God, she’s acting like a 12 year old having friends over for her first sleepover. She wasn’t this nervous the first time she had Sam over to her apartment. She never has anyone over at her apartment. How is this somehow worse?
“This isn’t a geometry problem, Cas. There isn’t a transitive property of Dads. He’s your kid, and he needed you around. Good fathers don’t abandon their children.” Dean feels something spasm across his face. Good fathers don’t abandon their children. It had been true when he said it. Simple, even. It stays true as he thinks about it. Bobby had loved them, but it hadn’t been the same. It didn’t make Dad not being there — when he was dying, when he didn’t know what to do, when Sam had questions Dean had been too young to even pretend to know the answers to — better. Good fathers don’t abandon their children. Dean’s left hand tightens on the walkman, straining to clench into a fist.
“I —” But what is he supposed to say? How does he explain that he gets it? He absolutely gets it. He doesn’t think he’s worth that, but God, he understands it. Cas thinks of Dean as family on par with Jack, and Dean is never going to fault someone for trying to save their family. Cas continues, past the sound of Dean choking down another useless sentence.
It's not graceful when he deposits Jack into his bed, but it is functional — and functional is the Winchester way.
to feel that way. They’re brothers. They’ve bled for each other so many times back and forth over the years that, honestly, he has no idea whose blood is whose anymore.
Jody and Dean finish their beers. She tosses him another. The silence stretches long and comfortable.
“Any time,” Dean says, but he misses the mark for glib by a couple hundred miles. Cas’s eyes flick to Dean’s mouth when he speaks before sliding back to meet Dean’s gaze. Dean’s mouth goes dry, and he swallows against nothing.
Dean whirls around, making eye contact by accident again. “What?” He’s trying to figure out why Cas is apologising to Dean of all people about being a rebel with a cause. That’s in Dean’s top 3 favorite things about Cas. Right in between Everything and Everything Else.
They’d been in that horrible slog of grasping at some kind of normal for months, and then Jack and Cas had shown up.
He’s also saying, “You can’t argue with me, because I see you. I know who you are, and you can’t claim that I don’t.”
The stake out to find the Marid is awkward, but luckily, they find it chilling in the basement loft of Isabelle's stupidly big house. Eileen and Dean had entertained the idea that perhaps the Marid was being held against its will, but the 4K TV and disturbing number of funko pops put that theory to bed. Still, Eileen gives the Marid a chance to explain itself.
Cas could have said “You love violence.” Instead, he said “Loving Violence.” The capitalization is bugging Dean, too. Cas had been meticulous in his grammar this whole time. What, he just mistakenly capitalized the second word? Cas- “I don’t get words wrong” -tiel? Hell, even ‘Violence loving’ would have made sense.
Dean hears someone call out to him, telling him to hurry up. Sam. It’s Sammy. Dean needs to say something back. Dean needs to open his mouth, so he can say something back. Dean needs to get it the fuck together, and make words like a grown ass adult.
Sam doesn’t have a response to the dig about his dancing, mostly because he can’t really argue, so he shoots Dean a glare.
But that last time — Cas sliding into the Empty, pleased as punch to love Dean out loud for one brief second and then abandon him for eternity — that had shattered him.
Fuck. Castiel really. He really — Castiel is in love with him. He's just…undeniably, 100 percent in love with him. Castiel is in love with him.
Then, Cas is turning away from the phone and saying, “Dean says that he thinks the purple magpies are a lovely idea,” because Cas is a literal son of a bitch, but also because Cas loves to mess with people by pretending to be a literal son of a bitch.
Eileen shifts, unselfconscious in the passenger seat, fingers pausing. He knows she’s just found the army man crammed in the ashtray, so he keeps his posture light and his eyes forward. Sure enough, her eyes dart to him seconds later, so he looks back and gives her a wry grin. She smirks, continuing her exploration, bolder now that Dean’s all but given her permission.
that. He could continue being his useless idiotic self if there wasn’t all this fucking pressure to not mess anything up.
Cas doesn’t pull the paper out right then, but he does make eye contact with Dean, probably drawn to his smug smirk. Dean winks. Cas blushes, just lightly, and Dean thinks, ‘Oh yes. We’re definitely going to kiss again.’
He pushes out his breath to read the explanation for Angels of The Get Through: “11. You never stop trying.”
Dean pulls out all the stops for breakfast. He seems to be in a great mood, which is how Sam knows that something isn't right. Dean’s never in a good mood before 8 AM. Not without 3 cups of coffee or getting laid.
Somewhere higher up, his phone starts buzzing again. Dean’s brain is too muddled. He’s thinking about Sam dying, and Cas leaving, and Sam leaving, and Cas dying. He’s thinking about how all of those have always been his fault.
Alone. Dean is alone. Anger buffets his chest, trying to push out the despair, leaving bruises on the inside of his ribcage.
This dingy motel is probably past saving, but it won’t hurt to clean up a little. She organizes her notes on the case, too — makes her thinking abundantly clear, shores up as much evidence as possible. If Dean’s gonna take over her case, she’s gonna at least make sure all her ground work gets put to use. Not that she’s going to let him take over her case, but she’s seen Dean with Sam on a case. There’s never a discussion of who's doing what. Dean says things and expects to be listened to.
Dean is not upset. He’s not angry or panicked or anything. He’s just calmly taking the next exit off the highway, and parking the Impala.
Cas drew Jack to his chest and folded his wings over them both, desperate to give the boy some kind of comfort.
It's a beautiful song. It has a heavy weight to it. It makes him think of Cas’s capacity to be utterly still and utterly dangerous at the same time. Cas’s ability to walk into a room and draw all eyes to him. Even now, after everything, Castiel is a commander of Heaven's armies. He carries a weight about him.
They’ve been eating in silence for a bit, Dean turning something over in his head, Eileen turning Dean over in hers. A different waitress fills up their coffee cups.
They sit in a somewhat uncomfortable silence. Cas isn’t sure what makes the silence sit so wrong. He reasons that it’s probably the way Sam is staring at him, like he might perceive Castiel’s true form through sheer force of will if he could sufficiently resist blinking. Cas knows Sam to be a very capable man, but that seems a little out of his depth.
Awkward cohabitation with the ex is new territory. Dean’s been avoiding the mixtapes — desperately clinging to when Cas wanted him in a place where Cas could catch him is mortifying. Plus, he doesn’t want Cas thinking this is a Charlie in Straw Dogs sorta situation. Dean’s fine with the break up, it’s just…an adjustment. He’ll adjust. Yea, he’s still carrying the unfinished tape in his pocket. So what? It’s not like he’s listening to it.
“Yeah,” Sam says softly to the table, like it's the only thing he can trust with his secrets. “Yeah, he does.”
He can’t look at Cas right now and say that he forgets half his reasons for living every time Cas goes. He can’t explain how, the last time, he had slipped right past depressed and grieving, careening into emptiness right alongside Cas. Like Dean’s whole heart had gone with him, sleeping in that inky black nothingness. He can’t let Cas know about tying the curtains around his body and wondering whether or not there was going to be enough left of Dean for Sam to bury. He can’t let Cas know about spreading his ashes and wondering if he could decompose in that field, too. He’d left Baby running because some part of him had known that if he parked her there, he’d lay down and never get back up again. He can’t let Cas know how much it had destroyed him to lose Cas, to not be able to save Cas, to have never had Cas in any real way, to know that he didn’t have a right to how much he couldn’t function without Cas.
It's obviously the wrong thing to say, because Jack starts crying again. Dean thinks he might say something like “I messed it all up,” but Jack's also grabbing onto Dean tighter and muffling his words into Dean's chest, so Dean defaults to slowly rocking him and waits. Clearly talking wasn't the right strategy, but Dean has to try something. He can't let the kid cry all night.
Wildly, Dean continues with the sign for “man” before she can launch into whichever tirade she was going to pick.
The song is a plea for someone to live. The song is Sam and Cas begging Dean to give them more time before he throws himself into the ocean. Cas killing Billie instead of letting the brothers make good on a dumb deal. Sam and Cas and Bobby pleading with Dean not to say yes to Michael, to give them more time to devise a new solution. Cas reaching into the bowels of Hell to save Dean.
just as the sun is peeking up over the trees, shooting beams of free light like knives cutting through the air, and he smiles.
Dean knows how to be a gentleman, so he slides over and invites Cassie to sit. He almost asks if her husband is with her, and then realises it would be creepy to reveal that he knows that she got married, so he just asks her how she’s been.
For a while, the only sounds are those of Dean bustling around the kitchen, heating milk and collecting mugs. Hot chocolate only takes a few minutes to make, even adding fancy spices as Dean does, so he’s handing Patience a mug and squirting whipped cream onto his own in no time.
“Okay, Sam-brina, jeez. Don’t get your panties in a twist.” Dean lifts his hands in a placating gesture. “So, you’re all gonna get naked and dance in the moonlight, is that what you’re angsting about? You nervous because you were born with 2 left feet?”
One last song. He can power through it and go back to never thinking about this again. He can finish this and then paste on the Dean Winchester that Cas likes. He just has to finish this tape, and then he can smile at Cas and say he enjoyed it and tell him to stop. He can make himself someone different.
“He loves you very much.” Here, Sam looks at the table, like this is a truth of which to be ashamed. Cas knows Sam well enough to know that Sam isn’t ashamed that his brother loves him, so he must be ashamed of the emotion this sentiment elicits.
Cas vanishes in an explosion of sound, the fluttering of wings giving way to total silence. In the space of everything Dean didn’t say, in the hollow emptiness of the muddy field, Dean hears
Dean, at least, has the decency to wait until Cas is all the way down the hall before he starts laughing.
Sam throws up his hands placatingly. “Hey man, I didn't think anyone would be up before me. Figured I'd get to them after my run.”
The song settles to an end and Dean doesn’t rewind it. He can’t find the revelation he’s supposed to have. He just listens to the fading song and drives.
