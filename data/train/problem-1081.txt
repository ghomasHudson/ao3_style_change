Time to head back home comes too quickly, even after taken three extra patients. He sends a quick text to Sherlock explaining he’ll be late but doesn’t get a reply. Deciding some fresh air could only be good, John gets out of the bus two stops before Baker Street, walking the last few streets. The living room window is open when he stops in front of 221B, the sound of two distinct voices making its way outside.
John growled, the sound making Sherlock shiver before they were kissing again. Agreeing to share this room may in fact be the smartest thing Sherlock had ever done.
“I’ll let you know when I make the arrest,” Montgomery finally declares, stretching in his chair before patting John on the shoulder. “Watson, thank you for the brunch and the details this lad never seems to want to share.”
"I don't know," John teases, moving to kiss his nipples now. "I quite like this." Sherlock makes a frustrated noise, tugging harder and John finally rolls back on top of him. He kisses Sherlock tenderly, not moving yet. "Tell me, alright?"
“I feel like I’ve been apologising all evening,” John says after a moment, “but just one more time, I promise.” He glances at him, and Sherlock waits patiently. “I realise now that even if it meant you found me, this whole twitter business was maybe a bit too much. Harry convinced me to do it after I couldn’t stop talking about what happened; she’s actually the one who came up with what to say.”
deduction that made it all so much more real. I hated that I felt alone, truly alone. And I hated you, John. I hated you for having chosen her, for having married her, for having made me watch.
"Anyway," Lestrade continues. "Once we had the four files together it became obvious that our friend here likes to reenact murders from horror movies. He also chooses his victims carefully. All male, his age and most importantly, virgins."
“Be together?” John supplies, lips stretching into an even wider smile, Sherlock’s own smile lighting the entire room.
As I told you before, I am not going to keep secret any of the things this other John wrote. I actually believe he wants me to tell you, or at least, I know I wouldn’t have minded. So let’s start with the obvious, the one fact that’s even more unreal than this whole other universe thing: this other John is married to you.
XX67: I know, John. I’ve read your letters a dozen times already, and I’m probably going to need a dozen more to actually believe what I’m reading it’s happening. That you wrote those words.
“No, listen to me.” John cut him off. “You can’t believe people that would say that about you, alright? You’re so much more special than that.”
“Thanks.” I say to Victor, turning to continue my journey to the milk cooler. A hand on my shoulder stops me.
John stood outside the school, tapping his foot impatiently as he waited for Sherlock to arrive. They had texted over the summer, and John missed his little friend more than words could say.
“Sherlock…” John tapped on the door to their shared room, pushing it open to see him sulking on his bed.
“Right away, love.” Mary hummed, sounding a little distracted. “Don’t worry, you’ll be home by Christmas!”
"But...I'm his lab partner," Sherlock's deep voice swam through his consciousness, and he looked up at Sherlock from where he was sitting.
"Is it true?" John asked after he had calmed down. "That thing you can do, where you look at someone and know everything about them?"
"Vampires, you say?" Watson mused. "Why, I think they make for an entertaining story. Why do you ask?"
Mike smirks at the list, nodding in approval. “Get rid of these, and Victor is no longer king.” He says cheerfully, causing Greg and I to grin back at him. “Time to destroy the Plastics.”
It was John, his tan skin a stark contrast for Sherlock’s. It gripped his wrist, as if he had gone to throw Sherlock’s hand off, but stopped mid-movement. Sherlock stared at the hand before looking up, gasping audibly when dark blue met silver.
“You’ll love it here, Johnny.” A feminine voice said from behind him, and John turned quickly, a smile on his face. “You’ve always wanted to live in London.”
John looked up, grinning at Sherlock’s reddening cheeks. Christmas was far more than passable for him, it was clear.
“Yes, but he did not summon you.” Molly replied, raising her eyebrows at him. “He was an innocent party. Why didn’t you take Harriet Watson’s soul?”
The man shook his head, a small, quick jerk that caused his curls to bounce. “You are important, John Watson. More than anyone realises.”
Sherlock gritted his teeth as the car rammed into them again, then he picked up his speed, barely managing to keep ahead of his pursuer.
“Simple.” Sherlock said, sucking in a breath. “Your haircut is that of a military style, and you hold yourself as a military man would. You are tan, but not below the wrists, so you haven’t been on vacation. You were invalided, shot in the shoulder, but you have a psychosomatic limp.”
"Do what, Molly?" Sherlock asked, feeling broken. "Tell him that I'm in love with him? I kidnapped him, for god’s sake. He was polite and everything, but I can't do that."
“Oh, Sherlock. You play marvellously, as always.” She sighed, pressing a hand to her heart. “But I need to ask you a favour.”
“You really want me to believe that you are a demon?” John asked, barely suppressing a giggle. “That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.”
"Ah...it's a rude version of 'go away', I suppose," Sherlock replied. "Most humans dislike when I observe things about them."
John thought, looking around quickly to make sure no one was watching him. A small smile flitted across his face when he confirmed the fact that his smaller than average size and seemingly normal appearance kept people from observing him.
“Fair enough.” Sherlock replied with a smirk. “Though I trust you’ll take my words to heart, Detective Inspector?”
“I think you’re on your tenth biscuit.” I say in wonder, shaking my head as Sherlock stuffs a whole one into his mouth, grinning through the crumbs.
"You can't stick around for one last goodbye?" Their father, Siger asked as he came through the platform, a black and yellow Hufflepuff tie peeking out from the collar of his jumper.
“I am not positive if I know anything.” Greg replied, “But I must go, and so must you. There is an American daredevil whose time has come. He shall be an interesting man to meet.” And with that, Greg vanished, leaving a very annoyed Sherlock behind.
"Of course I do," John said, clutching the confession picture in his hands as he tried to ignore his instinct to flee.
"I do believe this restaurant is open to the general public," Mycroft said, gesturing around vaguely. "And though I loathe to admit it, the general public does in fact include myself."
"Probably," Jim replies cheerfully, and for a brief second I see something flash in his eyes. It doesn't stay long enough for me to identify it, but it causes my heart to pound quickly.
“Of course.” Sherlock said, looking rather proud of himself. “I won’t require you to be at my bedside. I rarely sleep as it is, and hovering can get annoying. Therefore, you have your own room.”
I arrive at St. Bart’s, surprised to see the place swarming with all different kinds of emergency personnel. I wonder if Sherlock went and got hurt, but before the fear can fully form, I spot the tall brunette arguing with a police officer.
Otto smiled slightly, reaching forward to grasp Sheol’s highly embroidered tunic, pulling the taller man closer.
"Oh? Oh!" John flushed, his eyes widening with realisation. "Christ, we've been friends for months and I never...I mean, the boys will really like your curls."
“Hi, I’m John Watson.” I say with a grin. Sherlock grimaces at me as if I’ve made a fashion faux-pas. Which I might have, I don’t really know.
Sherlock hadn't spoken with John since he had gotten sorted, but that was to be expected. They weren't in the same house, or in the same year, so their paths never really crossed. So when John pulled Sherlock aside in the library, it was most surprising to say the least.
“Quite.” Sherlock comments, a smirk on his face once more. “And you make an excellent assistant, John. Even though we never managed to get in to look at the crime scene. I do believe we’ll have to do this again.”
Sherlock turned away from Mycroft, encouraging him to leave. Sure enough, he heard Mycroft's soft footsteps walking away, followed by a hushed click of the door. Sherlock was alone.
I look over to see a beaming Jim Moriarty and an amused looking Sebastian Moran. I give them a weak smile and clear my throat.
“Why not?” Sherlock smirks, pocketing his mobile. “You’re my assistant, and I am trying to solve a murder.”
“I…who are you?” John blurted out, blinking at the form in front of him. Righteous anger poured from him, and John couldn’t contain a shiver.
"Don't be so dramatic." Mycroft rolled his eyes. "I was going to say that sentiment is a weakness, but it can also be a strength."
Lestrade nodded slowly, the glassiness in his eyes having nothing to do with the alcohol now. “Of course, master.” He breathed, baring his neck.
“If he had hurt you worse, he wouldn’t have left this room,” Sherlock mutters, giving my hand a squeeze.
Siger beamed at him as if he had paid Sherlock the highest of compliments. John knew that Sherlock’s family loved him, but it was clear that they didn’t expect a lot of positive comments about him, even from his apparent boyfriend.
Classes started the following day, something Sherlock had waited a long time for. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays he had Potions and Transfiguration with the Hufflepuffs, and Charms with the Slytherins. History of magic, Herbology and flying lessons were shared with Gryffindors.
“Hardly a bed.” John muttered, swinging his legs back up onto the metal slab, earning a small grin from Purple. The light shifted from red, to green, then finally settling back into its soft yellow once more. He wasn’t entirely sure how a light could measure all his vital signs, but everyone seemed to be a bit nutty, and it appeared that the best option would be to go with the flow.
The rest of the drive had been fairly uneventful, and it wasn’t long before Sherlock was pulling up to his family’s winter estate. He unlocked one of John’s pink cuffs, quickly locking it onto the steering wheel of the car before he had time to react.
“Victor is nice.” I repeat for what seems to be the millionth time since I’ve met Greg. “And I’ve been to Victor’s house before.”
“We brought you gifts!” Abel burst, his face in awe. The Shining One responded with a low chuckle that reminded Sheol of his own laugh.
Sure enough, the boy named Henry looked as though he were about to doze off. I walk away from him quickly, choosing to sit next to the two boys instead.
thinking about?" Sherlock asked, and John bit back a grin. He knew that it was impossible to keep secrets from Sherlock.
"I thank you for your confidence, but I'd rather not risk it, if it's all the same to you." Mycroft gave Violet a quick hug. After a handshake with Siger, he was on his way. He disappeared through the crowd so quickly that Sherlock would have thought Mycroft aparated, had he not failed his test earlier that year.
"I have had enough for the day, Molly," Sherlock said, sounding weary. "I came to you because I thought you would understand how I felt, this...unrequited feeling."
"Yes!" Tom said emphatically. "Molly talks about Sherlock quite a bit. He's always been so alone. She's tried to set him up before, but to no avail."
"Yes, thank you," Sherlock said, "That doesn't change the fact that a blind date set up by a previous girlfriend is statistically likely to end poorly."
“No. God no.” John sighed, unable to look at Sherlock now. “I’m embarrassed cause…well, first of all, you are
For being the world’s most observant man, it had taken him an extraordinarily long amount of time to deduce how he felt for John Watson. The praises that fell so easily from his lips left a permanent warmth in his chest, and he had mistaken it for platonic fondness.
“He’s a terrorist.” Mycroft said. “The most dangerous human in the country, quite possibly the world.”
As if answering his unasked question, the group came to a halt in front of a great lake, small boats lining the shoreline in front of them.
And the people wouldn't leave no matter what John did. He tried banging on the glass, glaring at them, and splashing them, but they only seemed to enjoy it.
“No.” Sherlock snorted. “The nearest inhabited building is over fifteen kilometres away. You’ll be walking for ages.”
It's at that moment that Victor slinks up behind me, looking unbelievably smug, as usual. "You have the absolute worst taste in boyfriends, John. Everyone who likes you ends up dead."
Sherlock cursed, climbing out of the ship and inspecting it for damage. A few scratches curved along the front of the pod-ship, but otherwise, it seemed unharmed.
With that parting comment, Sherlock was off once more, his Belstaff swirling dramatically behind him.
"Your help isn't required." Sherlock replied, standing up and walking towards the door. If he had turned to look at John before leaving, he might have seen hurt cross his face.
It takes almost a full minute for me to comprehend what I am seeing, and by that point Sherlock has stopped struggling, and is now snogging Victor quite enthusiastically. And it’s not as if I can look away. The sight is so surprising and terrible that I can’t stop watching, but what really gets to me is how much it
“If I had known that all those bruises and cuts came from ghosts and not fights-” Ann began, promptly cut off by her son.
“Yes, they do exist.” Sherlock replied. “Something that shouldn’t be so unbelievable, as you’re currently living with a demon.”
John laughed, rubbing a hand across the back of his neck. “Right, of course. I’m John Watson, by the way.” He removed his hand that was on his neck, holding it out for the other boy to shake.
“Is this him?” She asked John, pointing at Sherlock, a frown on her face. Without getting an answer, she turned to Sherlock, glaring fiercely. “Listen, buddy, I don’t know who you think you are, but you’re a horrible person.”
“He has a few spare clothes here, thank goodness. I think Siger’s clothes should fit you just fine. You seem to be about the same size.”
Sherlock turned in his seat so that he could watch John closely. If he was going to get punched in the face, he might as well see it coming.
“I know, you can’t possibly manage without me, Lestrade. Unfortunately, I’m a busy dragon.” Sherlock said, sounding smug.
"Ta. Yeah, I have. I'll be out quick, I promise." John said, entering the bathroom and shutting the door with a soft
It was a nice picture of John. While he wasn't smiling, he stood there looking pleased, a beaming Mary on his side.
"I confess that I didn't expect you to overtake me," Sherlock said in delight. "I have a proposition for you."
John woke up nearly two hours earlier than he intended, and he groaned, rubbing his eyes with his fists. He was exhausted, and finding out you’re sharing a room with a ghost was never fun. Sure, he had had ghosts popping in on him when he was living in his family’s old house, but at least his room was his own.
"You're wearing a collar, aren't you?" Anderson said with a smirk, though any bravado was lost in the rapid creeping of his scales.
“Well, you were never dating Victor in the first place.” He retorted, and Sherlock choked on his cigarette smoke.
“Yeah, of course.” The employee scrambled to get a piece of paper and a pen. “Hooper is still in town; that much I know. Holmes went to some cottage for Christmas, and won’t be back until the day after tomorrow.”
"Listen, I don't know what you did to piss off a Slytherin prefect, but you had better be careful. He seems dangerous."
Sherlock felt momentarily stunned. This strange being was being…kind to him. It was something he was unused to, and he wasn’t sure how to respond.
The whole charade was barbaric, and he had half a mind to pull John out of the whole situation. He had been unable to visit John these past three sun cycles as it was, and now he was actively trying to get himself killed. Sherlock hated every moment of it.
London had been abuzz for the past few months, every newspaper declaring the marvellous discovery: Mermaids were real, and they had captured one.
The rest of September and October passed in the same manner. I found myself getting closer to the Plastics, as well as Mike and Greg. My popularity skyrocketed until girls would hang around my locker, trying to talk to me, and I got great grades, making my mum and dad proud. But the best thing was my friendship with Sherlock Holmes. Even though there was a distinct lack of murders, Sherlock continued to come over to my house, stealing my laptop for research purposes. All in all, it was a good beginning to my first year in a London school. I was even invited to Victor Trevor’s annual Halloween party.
Obviously, he had a sleek, black roll along suitcase, nothing that could even remotely be compared to John’s dusty, military backpack. Still although they looked as different as night and day, literally because Sherlock was as white as if he’d never seen the sun and John himself had put on quite the tan, the soldier was confident enough for the night to take an interesting turn. As they reached the room he let Sherlock in first again.
“And with all this, you should be able to make your point without any chance of any lawyer finding flaws.”
“I…” Sherlock begins before clearing his throat. “Even if I care,” he starts again, looking anywhere but into the DI’s eyes, “there’s not much I can do.”
It takes another second for Sherlock to realise he’s nervous too, and desperately trying to hide it. Holding back a smile, Sherlock breathes in slowly and gets to his feet, moving towards John without saying a word. He reaches for his hand first, lacing their fingers softly until John’s eyes are finally back on him. They don’t say a word, barely breathing. With a tentative finger, Sherlock traces the lines around John’s eyes all the way to his mouth, tracing each lips slowly. He feels John’s exhales against his own, and they both look away when their eyes meet, the distance between feeling like too much and too little at the same time.
Sherlock leaves her in the hall, heading for his laboratory and placing a dozen jars of honey in a box. “Should I carry it for you to your car?” He asks when he comes back.
Sherlock searches for his hand, bringing comfort in the ways he learned over the past few months. He laces their fingers together, waiting until John’s eyes find his. He slowly raises his other hand to cup John’s red, cold cheek, pulling him close enough for another kiss. He lingers there, lips warm despite the freezing air.
Sherlock rolls his eyes but there's something soft and trusting on his face that makes John's heart miss a beat.
Sherlock sighs again, eyes finding Rosie's sleeping form in the mirror. "You’ve met my mother, she can be…. " he trails off, teeth grazing his lower lips, and John watches in silent. "Let’s just say that when she has her mind set up on something, it’s impossible to make her see otherwise."
"Isn't it?" John can't help but ask, another nervous laugh escaping him. They remain silent for a long moment, Rosie dozing off on Mrs Hudson's shoulder and John tries his best to regain some composure  by watching her. "Do you mind taking care of her tonight?"
"You're not an idiot, no matter what I say, and you know relationships aren't what I’m... best at," Sherlock begins carefully. "We've already established that framing Horsen was easier thanks to the whole virgin angle, but it also means that..." he sighs, falling silent.
“I guess I’m going to need something to do too,” John sighs, looking up at the sky for a second. “I’m tired of the clinic, and besides, I’m sure the closest one is a long way from here.”
“You haven’t read them then?” John asks, turning to look back at him. Sherlock shakes his head, eyes finds his again. “Do you want to read them together?”
John noticed the faint glow in Moriarty's throat, realizing immediately what the dragon was about to do. He reacted instinctually, knocking Sherlock out of the path of white-hot flames, his hair getting singed as they both fell to the floor.
“Are such drastic measures really so necessary?” His master asked petulantly as they began to walk. John considered not moving before deciding that being shocked for simply being stubborn wasn’t really worth it.
“Naturally. We’ve captured one of their leaders.” Mycroft replied smoothly. “A doctor by the name of John Watson.”
He manages to find Stamford in the third empty classroom he opens the door to, “I need John’s number,” he announces immediately, and Stamford frowns at him.
“I’m not a cop, and never will be.” Sherlock said, smiling when John frowned at him in response, “I’m a Consulting Detective.” It was the first time that he introduced himself as such and for a moment Sherlock feared John’s reaction.
This is by far the hardest thing I’ve ever done, and I joined the bloody army, so I’m not going to linger much. I’m following the advice of another me, and even though there is a good chance you’ve already deduced what I’m about to say, know that these are the things I’ve kept to myself only all this time. Secrets I’ve never shared, ones that I’m about to tell you now:
Sherlock can’t help but smile, shaking his head, “What were you expecting? Getting older didn’t make shopping more interesting.”
He catches sight of a pirate and a cowboy exchanging whispers in each other’s ears quickly, and he orders a glass of water without looking away. He needs to remain focused, and alcohol isn't an option, no matter how tempting. He tries to guess what Sherlock might be saying now that they aren't glued together anymore, and it doesn't take a genius to guess he's deducing the three men sitting not far away. He watches as Matthew laughs, and laughs some more while Sherlock smiles at him, and John freezes. He knows that smile, has seen that smile before, has once said that he could tell Sherlock wasn't a machine just because of
Anton Smirk is boring, ordinary and a compulsive cheat. He has no reason (no reason at all) to play this game on me.
"They do," Sherlock replies, looking uncertain for a moment, eyes darting down for the briefest of seconds. "You'll like it, I assure you."
It takes another two days before Sherlock has to face the consequences of his mistake. He had barely managed to fool himself these forty-eight hours, lying awake on the sofa and pretending that he was only going through what happened at the pub to figure out when and how their suspect had escaped them. He did not think of the shade of John’s hair, or the feeling of his breath against his cheek, because really, it isn’t helping. He promptly pulls away his fingers each time he began to stroke his lips, and ignored each shiver running down his spine whenever he let himself drift too far into memories of John’s taste.
“I’m standing by my word, you can have the bed.” he smiled and put his backpack down next to a small couch. “I’d just like a shower and later I’ll be fine with this couch. So get as comfortable as you like.”
They both laugh, John being suddenly reminded of his still aching erection. Sherlock gasps, his entire body shuddering.
“I’m coming,” John says quickly, offering Sherlock his most reassuring smile. Sherlock nods, and John’s eyes fall to his hand, open in an inviting gesture that could either be ignored or accepted. “Lead the way,” he smiles, lacing his fingers back with Sherlock’s and not saying another word as they climb the few steps to the flat. If John had been expecting anything about the place someone like Sherlock would live, he can say without doubt that it wasn’t this.
John’s fingers tighten around his cup and Sherlock notes the quiet, sharp inhale through his nose. John is still looking at the fire. Sherlock finds himself hoping he’d meet his eyes again.
It takes a moment for John to reply, surprised by the look of pure joy on the boy’s face, “Yes, I am.”
John doesn't reply, giving the DI one last nod before leaving. He looks around in case Sherlock had waited for him there, but catches no sight of darks curls or long coat. He slides both hands into his coat pockets, the prospect of all there is to come now making it hard to focus. He returns two or three smiles from officers he can't remember the name of, and climbs the stairs down to the main entrance with a brand new ache settling in his chest. He stops dead when he notices Sherlock smoking outside, his back turned to him and his head falling backward, as if he was staring at the stars.
. He doesn't say a word, walking to the doors with the strange sensation that the remains of the life he built within these walls are slowly crumbling down. "I..." he whispers but decides against it. "Goodbye."
Soon only their breathing is filling the room, and Sherlock isn’t sure he’ll ever be able to speak again, or move for that matter. With so much to feel, so much to catalogue all of the sudden, he knows for a fact he might need years to remember the exact feeling of John’s ankle against his own. He does his best not to move, not to disturb the fragile arrangement they came up with that it takes him another full minute to notice John is talking.
And really, remaining sitting there, sulking, isn’t going to improve the situation in the slightest. He’s not even sure how long he has stared at the union jack pillow, but when he finally snaps out of it, night has long since fallen. He glances at the clock, two hours and thirteen minutes since John left for his date. Sherlock sighs, one hand coming to ruffle his hair. If the date had gone bad, John would have come back already, probably in a bad mood but nothing good tea couldn’t have fixed. But no, John is still out there, and really, there are things Sherlock wishes he could not deduce after all. He closes his eyes, sighing a bit louder. It was rare for a first date to go this well lately, John always coming back either truly hoping for a second one, or resigned and ready to move on. Sherlock, obviously, rather preferred the second option, but he knows perfectly well that someday the first date will turn into a second, a third and then much more.
John looks down at his mug, swallowing with difficulty while trying to repress a smile, “He said so once, yes, I remember.”
"I need to go check on Rosie," John declares when they finally park in front of Baker Street. Sherlock isn't looking at him, having let go of his hand now and started at the window the entire ride, and John can't help but feel as if the situation is once again slipping through his fingers. He breathes out slowly, handing the money to the driver before saying, "Shouldn't take long."
"Just look at the two of you," Rosie mocks gently, bumping John's shoulder while laughing. "I'm only here for the weekend, I have to go back Sunday afternoon."
“Jason Marks” John panted slightly, the sprint having left him just a bit short for breath, “You would do good if you just stayed still now.”
"Yes," John moans, the lack of pressure on his erection welcomed. He looks down just in time to catch Sherlock staring at it, licking his lips, and another groan escapes him. "You," he says, sitting up to reach for Sherlock's trousers.
John closes his eyes, still smiling. It only occurs to him as he drifts off to sleep that he is much, much too relaxed.
Sherlock nods lightly, pushing the door closed as soon as he outside, and John resists the urge to storm back in and demand a real explanation. He listens as footsteps echo inside the flat, from the door to Sherlock's roo- no, the bathroom. Another pang of jealousy makes him shake from head to toe, and without thinking twice about it, John is taking out his phone and climbing down the stairs hastily. He ignores Mrs Hudson calling his name on the way out, and only stops once he's on the pavement, inhaling deeply.
Six days ago, a version of myself from a different universe sent me a letter. Well, I say sent… I found it under a lath in my bedroom. Still, I had it expertised and there isn’t any doubt, the handwriting is mine. Plus this other me proved himself, and despite everything I ever believed in, this is truly happening.
Sherlock was on his feet in seconds and walking to the flight attendant’s desk, the situation too familiar and not making Sherlock smile at all.
John hesitates, not exactly sure what to say next, what there is even to say at all. He looks down at his hands, teeth worrying at his lower lip as the words Horsen spook on a loop inside his head. "Sherlock," he whispers, "Horsen, did he..."
“They didn’t get past the door, yeah,” Montgomery sighs, “but I still have to take care of it, make sure these idiots don’t try again.”
I’m going to continue writing these letters, and each time, I’m going to reveal just a bit about my world. I’m hoping it will help you learn more about yourself.
“If you say so,” Lestrade replies, typing quickly before setting his phone back on the table. “Now, we wait.”
"Too bad," the man sighs, not moving. "I don't know why I thought a halloween party in a club would be a good idea anyway."
“So,” Tom finally says, a bright grin on his lips. “I haven’t seen you in a while. Any changes in our quest?”
“I’m sorry Sir, but the weather condition are forcing us to stay on the ground for an undetermined time. You are welcome to go visit our boutiques or-”
Sherlock frowns at him, concerned for a instant. He leans closer, almost close enough for a kiss, John’s mind supplies.
John nods, "Sherlock asked me to remain close and wait for his signal, so I waited by the alley before interfering."
Sherlock sighs, “Do we really? They’re going to be all over Rosie anyway. We just have to act like we always do since it convinced them already it seems.”
“Meaning I will be standing around waiting for you to work your magic? Problems if I ask some questions then? I’ve had quite enough of waiting around silently and it’s my vacation time after all.” the soldier smiled.
Not just one kiss, even if the first one was beyond anything I ever dared to imagine. No, he kissed me four times. Four. Each kiss different from the previous one, every one of them absolutely perfect. I couldn’t care less about experiences or previous data, if I get to kiss John - and only him - from now on, then I won’t ever complain again. Just kiss him. If he lets me.
The owner of the first shop he sees almost sound sorry when he sees him come in, "I only have a Batman costume left in your size, or a pumpkin but you don't look the type to wear one of those.”
They remain this way for a long moment, their arousal growing between them but neither of them doing anything about it yet. John wonders if he should ask again, if he should make sure one last time that Sherlock is aware of what they’re about to do means, but a sharp, uncontrolled thrust of Sherlock’s hips against his own makes him realise there isn’t much he can do now to change his mind.
“Yes.” Sherlock agreed and they both entered the restaurant, choosing a table not too far from their suspect. “Sit in front of me.” Sherlock ordered John, the doctor complying without question.
I’d rather stop now, their private affairs having to remain just that despite our close connection. I’ll explain the fourth universe in my next letter.
So, yes, I know, it won’t be easy. And yes, there are things you’d like to keep to yourself; I lived them all too. But trust me, it will only feel
Refusing to spend a moment more waiting here, he grabs his phone, Sherlock’s letter and goes to get Rosie from her room. She’s still half asleep when he puts her in the car seat, and he drives to the daycare quickly. It is still her period of adjustment, but John figures that three hours should be enough to find Sherlock, make him listen to what he has to say and hope for the best. He kisses her softly, feeling this same knot down his chest whenever he has to leave her, but he heads back for the car with one last smile. He’ll be back soon enough, and hopefully, only to go back to Sherlock afterwards.
John watches him leave the room, out off words. He remains lying there for another minute or two, trying to process what happened exactly. Curiosity getting the best of him, he ends up hurrying to put on an old jean and a shirt, climbing down the stairs all the way to 221C. A tall, tan, handsome man is waiting there, looking at him and smiling.
John rolls his eyes, not daring to ask how Sherlock would describe Baker Street in a middle of a difficult case. He watches as Sherlock turns the painting around, letting out a small cry of victory as he takes out a needle hidden there. "Poison?"
His phone ringing brings him back to his room, and he smiles as Rosie’s name on the screen, “Hello, sweetheart.”
Sherlock seems to be only able to moan his name, demanding another kiss with hungry lips devouring his, and John can only gives in to more, more, more. With his head spinning and heart racing, he licks into Sherlock's mouth, learning his taste, make it his only. It takes a sharp thrust of Sherlock hips and their erections brushing more firmly for John's mind to come back online, and with a reluctant sigh, he slows down the pace of their kiss until he can pull away softly.
Sherlock beams at him, unfolding his napkin. “Glad to see you’re impressed, that’s what I was aiming for.”
Sherlock nods, unable to formulate any coherent sentence that wouldn’t involve the three different shades of blue in John’s eyes.
Sherlock opens his mouth a few times before finally saying, "I deduced your jealousy the moment you saw Horsen. You've always been jealous, whether it was aimed at clients, officers or even Moriarty. You've always been horrible at hiding it."
"I..." John begins before shaking his head. "I thought I had something to do here, but turned out I don't."
Shower, as it turns out, doesn’t help at all. He should know better now, his jealousy having always been
"What we did," John corrects him. Sherlock smiles, fingers falling back to the sofa. "I'm sorry I married her."
John knows he’s only looking to buy more time, but when Sherlock nods, he can’t help but feel relieved. He takes his own letter and goes to sit in his chair, waiting for Sherlock to sit down too before opening it. He listens as Sherlock does the same, and breathes in deeply before letting his eyes fall on the single line written on the page. He doesn’t try to hold back a warm laugh, all the tension leaving his body, and he looks up to find Sherlock’s questioning eyes on him.
It could be due to Rosie’s recent state of health, but then John is used to dealing with sick patients all the time. But his patients do not sleep at his home and wake him up in the middle of the night. Still, it isn’t the first time Rosie is sick. Shouldn’t he be used to it by now?
He wakes up to a hand shaking his shoulder and a body half on top of his. For a tangible moment, he wonders if he’s still dreaming or not, memories of warm skin and heated kisses lingering in the back of his mind. But then, John’s voice fills the room, hoarse and full of hunger, “You were dreaming... moaning.” John’s hand slides to his neck, shaking. “Saying my name.”
Sherlock glares at him but it only makes Lestrade smile even more, “You want to see him again, yeah? That’s what this is all about?”
In each universe, everything goes the same until… until that moment. So each Sherlock, each John felt the same, and so… And so it could have happened. I could have kissed John after we came back home. He could have kissed me.
"Yes," Sherlock replies, all trace of previous embarrassment gone. "He changes his name every time, and looks for his victim on the Internet. It took me days to find his identity for this year, and then weeks to gain his trust. I couldn't use a fake name myself since our plan included a proposal, and besides, he obviously loved the challenge."
Sherlock reaches for him before he can think twice about it, one hand coming to settle in the crook of John’s neck, fingertips brushing hair. “I haven’t deleted a single thing when it comes to you, John. I’ve kept it all, the bad and the good. The times when I could barely hold back from pulling you into my arms, and the times when I found myself thinking maybe it would have been better if I had never met you. I’ve kept it all, right here, and I don’t plan on ever forgetting about it.”
“Not the only one, no,” John replies, refusing to let Sherlock think so. “Leaving is running away from the problem. Quentin was being just as stupid trying to deal with his own feelings by dating other people, exactly like running away.”
Sherlock knows the words are about to spill out before he can do anything about it, “Afghanistan or Iraq?”
“Earlier, you said a lot changed since that first dinner,” John says in a murmur but Sherlock can hear each and every nuance in his voice perfectly. “What did you mean by that, truly?”
In less than a minute, John is getting rid of his own pants and settling back between Sherlock's legs, the friction making them both whimper. John seals their lips again, catching all of Sherlock's moans and panting breaths. It takes them several minutes before they begin to move again, rocking against each other slowly, so very slowly. John knows they need to take their time, that Sherlock will be overwhelmed quickly and that they'll probably need to cool down from time to time, but he finds that just stopping what they're doing now is too much to ask.
part, but every time I tried to, something held me back. I can’t exactly say what is it in this letter, I’m not sure I could find the right words to do so anyway.
Sherlock doesn’t look away from him as John replies, “Perfect. We’ll be going now, can we have the bill?”
John doesn’t reply, not sure which words would come out of his mouth if he did, and Greg seems to get it. He turns to Rosie, asking her about her toy, and John thanks him silently. His eyes find his phone again, fingers drumming on the table. He only has to pick it up, just pick it up.
“I have his full name,” Sherlock replies, already going back to the deduction he made about John at the pub. It only takes a second before he makes the first connection, and he takes out his own phone quickly. “He went to med school before enrolling, and the best school in London for that is Bart’s.” Lestrade hums next to him, watching him work it out in silence just like he’s done so many times on crime scenes. “Now, there’s one person I know who studied medicine at Bart’s and fit John’s age, so I only need to find the class register and right year, and see if there’s a John Wats- There, found him.”
He lets go, abandon his heart and body in John’s hands, trust him with his own fear and overflowing love.
By now, John was sitting on the edge of his chair, leaning towards Sherlock and their feet were touching. Sherlock hadn’t said anything when John had placed his right foot just next to his, their legs brushing each time one of them moved. Just when Sherlock feared he was about to fall out of his chair,  John sat back completely, his drink forgotten by his side and his legs hanging open. Sherlock caught him looking up, his eyes darting to the mistletoe before looking back at Sherlock, or more precisely at his lips. Sherlock held back his breath, following John’s tongue as he licked his lower lip once again.
“John!” Sherlock cried out loudly, an edge of desperation in his voice that just made John want to take him apart even more.
“I am still not sure today how I would have reacted if you had kissed me that night,” Sherlock replies, searching his eyes. “I was trying really hard to impress you and make you move in, but at the same time, I was realising it might be more complicated than first planned to live with you. You were a mystery to solve back then, still are today really, and most of that came from the fact that you were making me experience feelings I didn’t understood.”
John takes one last step toward him, his answer being breathed directly against Sherlock’s lips. “Then we can’t prove your research wrong, can we?”
“I’ll take that as a no,” Lestrade smiles. “If you tell me right now that was just that, a kiss, then I’m out of here. But you gotta be sure!”
“Oh please,” Sherlock replied, rolling his eyes, “If I were a terrorist I would be cleverer than that.”
"Don't tell me," Lestrade sighs. "We needed to record him, but more importantly, to catch him in the act. Tonight was a success, thanks to Sherlock's planning."
John takes the time to breathe in deeply, "I don't know, Sherlock. I don't know because just talking about it makes it hard to breathe right now, and there are still nights when I can hear the sound of your body crashing onto the pavement, so I don't know."
He gets out of the bathroom only to stumble onto Sherlock in the hallway, looking absolutely breathtaking.
Sherlock stares at him for another minute, his entire face relaxing as he replies, "I just... wasn't sure you knew I was awake when you... told me."
"In an alley, flat on your stomach," John replies, the two of them staring at each other for a second before bursting into giggles. Sherlock's continues to hold tightly to John’s hand as he leans backward, putting a safe distance between them again, and John looks away to regain some composure before saying, "Come on, let's go."
And I just "can choose to ignore them" if I want to. He is an idiot? Am I an idiot in all those universes?
“You must have make your parents life hell as a teenager,” John says. “I’m sure your mom had a lot of stories.”
"Your turn," Sherlock finally says, having apparently taken back control, or doing a good job of pretending to.
John closes the few steps that separate them, cupping his head with both hands, "We don't need condoms. I'm clean and don't plan on sleeping with anyone else either."
“Is that your way of asking how many people I had sex with?” Sherlock smiled before crying out as John hit his prostate again.
“You’re not,” he whispers, another shift of their bodies bringing them closer together. “You won’t.”
). Is… is that what you want too? Because in your letter you said… I mean it was quite obvious that you…
. Sherlock could take care of it quickly, invent a convincing lie and get inside the staff area without any disturbance.
“Still,” John says, bumping his shoulder against Sherlock’s arm, “it’s part of your past. Interesting.”
Mrs Hudson stares at him for a long moment before giving in and letting him pass, "I'll keep Rosie with me downstairs," she declares, already walking towards 221A. "It'll be easier for all of us."
John traces the lines around Sherlock's eyes slowly until he looks back at him, "The stag night," he whispers.
John hums, leaning back against his chair and letting his lips stretch into a smile when Sherlock stands up. Music fills the air, and with his eyes never leaving Sherlock, John lets all the love he feels for this brilliant man submerge him once more. Only when breathing properly gets harder and harder does he allows himself to close his eyes, letting the music lull him to the edge of sleep.
Rosie fights him over the coat wearing, apparently not wanting to let a plain piece of clothing hide her still ever so fascinating dress. But John is already locked inside his own head, leaving her with just one sleeve on as he sits down on the sofa and lets out a loud sigh. "This is ridiculous," he whispers to the room, placing his head in his hands. How could he have thought this was a good plan. There was a high chance Sherlock wouldn't be home, and an even greater one he won't agree to even talk to him. No one simply knocks on the door for trick or treating after more than a month of complete silence and expects a positive response.
Sherlock shakes his head, his heart on his lips and his entire body getting used to this crushing feeling of
He calmly but surely pushes away every pair of hands reaching for him, every chest being pressed to his back, and ensures that no one comes to invade his own space. Song after song, he lets himself forget about it all. Sweat is pearling on his forehead, his shirt and jacket sticking to his skin, but he doesn’t stop. He can’t stop, not until all thoughts of John are being pushed out of his head. First, his smile as he walked downstairs, already dressed perfectly. Then, his hands moving from newspaper to phone to clean dishes. Finally, his voice, quiet as he said goodbye. Slowly, letting John go, just for a whi-
“Right over there,” Sherlock says, pointing towards their left, “is where I used to come when I was a teenager.”
It’s only when the lights are being turned off that he opens them again. Sherlock is lying on his side, facing him, but still too far away.
Another ten seconds pass before Stamford digs into his pocket for his phone, keeping his questions to himself and Sherlock silently thanks him. He always liked this about Stamford, his ability to stop talking when he knew he wouldn’t get an answer. Barely two minutes after pushing the door open, Sherlock leaves with John’s number in his phone and his head spinning just a little. He waits until he’s outside to inhale deeply, his fingers still closed around his phone. He stares down at it, heart pounding as he unlocks it and opens a new message.
“And by the way, talking about shared room, those were really complicated situations,” John says, laughing.
Sherlock wants to tell him this is ridiculous, that he has no doubt he’s going to be a gentle, soft, caring lover and that he hasn’t trusted anyone like this before, but he finds himself unable to open his mouth. John doesn’t need to hear any of this, he realises as he watches the concerned lines around his eyes, but something else entirely.
Sherlock had barely managed to hold back his moan as John had switched their position, the mere thought of riding him making Sherlock shiver with anticipation. His eyes never leaving John’s, Sherlock took hold of John’s cock and positioned himself just above it. Biting down at his lower lip, Sherlock slowly bore down, making sure John could see his every emotion as he breached him. Sherlock wince slightly at first, the head of John’s cock hot and so very hard against his entrance. He placed one of his hand on John’s chest and continue to impale himself down on this gorgeous cock, stopping only when he felt John’s pubes brush his bare arse. His second hand gripped at John’s knee and Sherlock undulated his hips, getting used to the feeling. He continued to look down at John, taking in the way John licked his lips and the hunger in his eyes. He felt John’s hand coming to rest around his hips, his fingers digging into Sherlock’s skin and he understood the message quite clearly.
He plucked a few things from his bag, mainly some new underwear and a jeans. There would be toiletries supplied by the hotel and either way he was used to the bare basics. He didn’t even think about grabbing a shirt when he entered the bathroom. Neither did it come to his mind as he showered, enjoying the spray of the hot water, the nice bathroom around himself and the blessed absence of hurry.
John holds back all the questions rushing to his head, and settles for the easy one: “Cases too boring for him?”
“I didn’t,” Sherlock replies, actually quite impressed with the fact himself, and leans down to kiss John, quick and smiling.
“Sherlock, shhh,” John smiles, kissing him quiet. “There is absolutely nothing to be sorry for. You can’t plan everything, sometimes it just feels good to follow what your body wants.”
They are a beautiful, messy mix of lambs and breath and heart He doesn’t care, doesn’t want his own body back. John can have it, all of him, every pieces and scars and secrets. Sherlock gave them all up to him a lifetime ago, during quiet evenings spent in their chairs or hours spent running around London. This, right now, their bodies slamming together in a melody Sherlock can never fully understand, this is all that matters.
“And you’re the one you chose to tell me about this whole charade at the last minutes,” John replies, knowing it would get a Sherlock’s full attention.
“A whole week to solve this mess,” Greg sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. “I guess I forgive you for sneaking out of my party.”
“John introduced us at the PUB a few months ago,” Tom explains. “He asked me if I had met you yet, and he had that smile of someone who knows, so we ended up talking.”
“Should we call Lestrade?” John asks on their way out. “Quentin seems to be really worried. This might be more serious than we thought.”
Sherlock slides into bed as quietly as he can, John’s sleeping figure barely percible in the dark room. He remains on his side of the bed, knowing the feeling of his still too cold body will only wake John up. He looks at him instead, eyes getting used to the darkness. John’s hair are growing longer and longer, causing him to curse every morning by the mirror and yet, never taking an appointment to cut them. Sherlock doesn’t tell him he prefers him this way. He’s pretty sure John already knows.
Sherlock’s reaction is immediate, moaning loudly as he throws his head back, and John can only stare down in wonder at him. He rolls his hips once more, feeling thrills of pleasure running down his spine, and the hand on his back now holding tightly to his shirt. Any doubts of being able to come with just some frottage fades away quickly, each and every moan and shiver from Sherlock making him harder.
John takes a deep breath, “Well, the very first night I slept in this bed, I was already wondering whether or not I could have invited you in my bed.”
I’m planning on talking about each one in my future letters. That way you can choose to ignore them if you want to, or read them all to discover the life you live in some other part of the universe. I must confess I didn’t understand the purpose of any of it, these other versions of myself were completely different from me. We share some memories but that’s all. We each made our own choices and they influenced our life one way or another. And yet here I am, writing to you. What can you deduce about that?
“No,” John stops him, grabbing his arm and making him turn around before taking a step backward. “Shit. Sorry, I didn’t meant to- Fuck.”
"I figured that was it," John replies, unable to repress a relieved chuckle. "I take it you got what you wanted?" He asks, kneeling next to him to take over, having no remorse in adding a bit more pressure to the hold.
“Yes, it wasn’t.” John laughed, the lines around his eyes crackling and Sherlock found himself unable to look away. “Well, at least they didn’t kept us in there for too long.” John continued, “Even if it means I need to find a hotel for the night like all the thousand other passengers in this airport.”
joining you, you silly boy.” Ann Watson said, smoothing John’s hair down. “I’m just not as…alive as we would have hoped.”
“That’s not what I’m thinking of.” I say, shivering. Sherlock understands my meaning, and he grabs my hand, kissing my knuckles.
-The daredevil I am referring to is Evel Knievel, who died on November 30th, 2007 from pulmonary disease in Florida.
John lowered himself to one knee, unable to keep the grin off his face as Sherlock turned to look at him once more, his eyes shinier than they had been a few minutes ago.
“So…Victor.” Mycroft mused aloud, a knowing glint in his eye. Sherlock rolled his eyes, diverting the subject.
“Ugh.” Molly wrinkled her nose, grabbing the metal cup they used to steam milk, pouring skim milk into it. “You’re bringing
“Black, no sugar.” Sherlock said absently, his phone that had begun to vibrate pulling him from the haze of the break up.
Not that it mattered. Even if Sherlock did follow sports, he would be too distracted by a drenched John running around to be able to pay proper attention.
Sherlock leaned over, placing his lips on John's. The Mer went still, his eyes wide in surprise, and his lips remained frozen against Sherlock's.
“I figured I would buy the wedding band early in lieu of an engagement ring.” John ran a hand through his hair. “If it’s not enough, I can go buy a n-mph!”
“Likewise, I’m sure.” John said. It was at that moment that something caught his eye. Without thinking, he turned to scold Sherlock for following him to school, but it was obvious right away that the ghost standing there wasn’t Sherlock. The ghost was tall, most likely taller than Sherlock. His hair was blond, artfully mussed, and he wore ripped jeans that were more of this century than the breeches of Sherlock’s. The real difference, however, was the look on his face. The rage and jealousy as he stared at the two of them would be unfathomable on Sherlock’s face.
“Please, you cannot die.” Sherlock said, his throat constricting rather suddenly. He hadn’t realised just how important John had become to him. “You have to live, John.”
John rolled his eyes, looking down at his hands. “I’m not proud of their deaths, if that’s what you’re alluding to. But that dragon had just killed my best friend, Bill Murray, and I was so
“Yeah, sorry about that.” Victor didn’t bother to sound sorry at all. “But I only told you that so we would have sex. I don’t
“Are you supposed to be a cat?” A particularly dumb girl asks. She had introduced herself to me weeks ago, but it was one of those names that half the girls you know have. I knew it was a Jennifer…
“Sherly!” Victor chirped, ignoring the full-bodied wince that always accompanied his horrible nickname. “Listen, I have some bad news. I can’t make it to your parents’ estate this Christmas.”
“What? What is it?” Sherlock asked, surprised when realisation dawned on Greg’s face. “What do you know?”
“You made me look like an idiot! Of all the stupid, rude things you could have done, this has to be the worst. I mean-”
“Oh, ever since I was young, really. I’ve always wanted to help people, but medical school was expensive, so I joined the army to help pay for it.”
John had never been one to follow the rules, even as a young Mer. The other Merfolk watched with dismay as John treated the rules like a checklist, hopping from one activity to the next.
"More so than the teachers?" John asked, his eyebrow quirking with mischief, causing his stomach to do a rather interesting flip.
“Yes, I do.” Sherlock confirmed, turning to look at his servant. “That means I have no use for you anymore. You have served me well these past six years, and I shall honour you for them.”
"Anything for you...Tom," He said, steering Sherlock toward the corner table. John stepped in a moment later, his mobile pressed against his ear.
The never ending stream of panic washed through Sherlock’s mind as he raced to Afghanistan, heading for a camp that he knew well. ‘
"Stop, it wasn't him!" I say, feeling a bit hysterical. Sherlock averts his eyes, looking embarrassed, but DI Lestrade looks at me in sympathy.
"Mr Holmes, you have stolen government property," The man said, taking a step forward. That was all the motivation Sherlock needed for his next move.
"Oh no, Sherlock. I wouldn't do that if I was you," Jim says. "Another step, and Johnny-boy here eats a bullet."
The lie falls easily from my mouth. It was the best thing I could think of in such a short amount of time; a secret boyfriend should easily distract them. It wasn't a complete lie either, judging by the way Sherlock had kissed me only the night before.
“Are you out of your mind?!” Sherlock demanded, snatching the gun out of John’s hand and tucking it into his greatcoat. “I thought you put all this nonsense behind you.”
“I know you’re a transfer student. Your father served in the military in either Afghanistan or Iraq. Unsure of which, but it doesn’t matter at the moment. You’re the second child, you have an elder brother who’s already left for university, living far enough away that you rarely see him. Most likely out of the country. Your ambition is to be like your father, a hero in the army. Most likely a medical doctor out there.”
“Sorry about that.” I say as soon as I close the door. Sherlock just chuckles, flopping down on my bed without invitation.
"Because I won't leave you alone until you do," Irene replied, looking devious. "And if you don't want to break your secret admirer’s heart, you cough it up. He'll be here any minute."
“No. Just tell him what you told me.” Greg smiled, looking over John’s shoulder at something. John followed his gaze, his breath stuttering at the sight of Sherlock, standing there, looking incredibly annoyed.
John hummed in agreement, falling silent as the professor entered the room. Jim and Sebastian might have been good together, but it seemed that Sebastian wasn’t quite ready to let go just yet.
“No, mummy.” Sherlock shook his head. “I don’t want to live on Holmes anymore. I don’t want to be a prince.”
"Well, this is a cause of celebration!" Jim say happily, clapping his hands together. "You were just complaining yesterday how awful he was, so it must be a relief to get rid of him."
“That wasn’t very nice.” I cluck, crossing my arms over my chest. Sherlock just gives me a smirk, mirroring my posture.
Sherlock didn’t reply to John, choosing instead to lead him into the large manor, closing the front door behind them with a kick of his foot. “Come along, they’re in the sitting room.”
The Wall had been around for as long as the students of St. Bart's could remember. Originally a blank expanse about six feet wide, the white paint was nearly eclipsed by black scribbles. Students whose parents attended St Bart's often heard stories of The Wall during their time at school, and more than one student confirmed that their grandparents had also used The Wall. The faculty had given up the fight long ago; the only maintenance they did any more involved painting over the scribbles at the end of the year, letting students start fresh the next school year.
“Patient 6745 has awoken.” One of the ‘doctors’ said, a woman in the back. She was reading what appeared to be a medical chart. “He suffers no long term effects from the localized rebinding. His cognitive processes are nearly at full working order, though some sections of his brain are still warming up from the three day sleep.”
"No," John interrupted. "I'm not going to let one ghost keep me away from school, especially when I haven't done anything wrong."
“Worry not, Abel. I am sure The Shining One will love your gift.” He reassured him. Abel just nodded, a look of determination spreading across his face.
It was there in the hot Afghani sun that Greg found him. It had been a long day for the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers, and the doctors at the camp were busy trying to rescue the soldiers that had been shot during the small scuffle between themselves and heavily armed locals. Sherlock had managed to take two of the men before Doctor Watson showed up, making it impossible to retrieve any. Sherlock sat outside the camp, watching the men walk around with little interest. He would be in the medical area, but John seemed to catch glimpses of him more often every day, and the idea of a mortal being able to see him without his express permission made Sherlock wary.
Suddenly a hand reaches out to stop Abrahams. The newcomer holds Abraham’s arm gently. “Do not sacrifice your son, Abraham. There is a sheep in the bush over there, a gift from The Shining One. Sacrifice the sheep instead.” Sheol realises that this is an angel as well. He is different from Mycroft, his hair is silver, and the kind smile on his face puts everyone at ease.
John groaned, stopping in his tracks. He peered down the road as if to confirm Sherlock’s claim before turning to the car.
He walked calmly to the passenger side of the car, sighing when he saw the blond trying to untie the scarf with his teeth, to no avail.
"I wasn't allowed to say anything," Mycroft replied. “You were supposed to find him on your own. And you refused to speak to me for over a thousand years.”
The room was silent for a moment, and John refused to look at Sherlock even though he could feel his eyes on him. Finally, Violet smiled.
“I…what?” Sherlock looked down at himself, as if to figure out what John was talking about. “I may have grown a few inches…”
His wrists were bound in handcuffs almost instantly, and Sherlock grabbed at them, surprised by their texture. They were unbelievably soft and fluffy.
Another car appeared, just managing to miss Sherlock as it swerved towards him. Sherlock flashed him the bird before losing them in traffic, trying to find the best spot to free John.
"You want your wife back." The demon sneered at the scraggly looking blonde woman. The state of her sobriety was questionable, though she appeared to be better off than anyone else in the pub. "And you are attempting to sell your soul for such a request...how dull. Unfortunately for you, your soul is worthless. Goodbye, Harriet Watson."
"Why won't you tell anyone?" John interrupted. "That's all the other humans could talk about all day."
When John had arrived at Bart's two years previous, he had been flattered to find his name pop up on the wall almost immediately. Of course, this earned him a bit of a reputation with his new rugby team that he certainly didn't earn. But, like all things new, the novelty of John faded and so did the wild gossip.
"First of all, you're hardly broken down," Sherlock said. "And secondly, all you'll have to tell him is that it's my fault. He'll believe you. He's met me."
Thrilled by his new name, Sheol looks upon his new companions. Their skin is the same deep colour as the bark on the trees, their hair a rich black. Startled, he sees green leaves on their bodies, so he looks at himself to see if he grows leaves as well. His skin is not the warm brown as the others, but an icy white, smooth and unblemished. He is not adorned in leaves, but is fully naked for the man and woman to see. Unembarrassed, he examines himself closely, taking in every detail about himself.
“I wanted to see you, to make sure you and your family are alright.” John said, sitting down next to him. Sherlock gave John a small smile, his stomach doing all sorts of gymnastics. Perhaps it wasn’t too late to tell John how he was feeling.
“If any of those things include my jumpers, you can forget about it.” John warned. Sherlock didn’t answer him. He merely laughed, then vanished like a puff of smoke. John groaned, running a hand through his hair as he stared at the spot Sherlock had been just a moment ago. Sherlock was…charming, to say the least. If he didn’t watch out, he might actually find himself
A glimpse of curls caught my attention, and Sherlock appeared at my side with Mike in tow. Any annoyance at Victor fades at the sight of him.
He entered the owlery on a Saturday morning, frowning at the vast array of owls to choose from. Some turned away when he offered his letter to them.
Professor McGonagall stood before them, a three legged stool with a dirty looking wizard's hat next to her. It sat completely motionless for a few moment before a large rip at the rim opened, and it began to sing:
John was looking over at him, a warm smile on his face. Sherlock blinked a few times in surprise, elation filling his sternum like a balloon.
Sherlock made his way to Bart's, knowing that Molly would still be in the lab. She often stayed late to finish up her work, and she rarely had social engagements.
Of course, Sherlock never did meet up with Victor later that night, because a third body had been found. Sarah Sawyer had been killed earlier that afternoon.
"It's not like I dated any of them," I say, ignoring Victor. "What would their flirting have to do with anything?"
Sherlock looked over at him in surprise, and he was shocked to find out that John was telling the truth. John grinned at the whole family before peeling off his borrowed jumper and putting on the brand new one. It looked good on him, though Sherlock probably wouldn’t admit it out loud. The dark blue hues brought out the blue in his eyes.
"Just as my son was born a human, so too were you," The Shining One replied kindly. "Sherlock needed to find you, and you needed to understand what it was like to be human before you took on the full weight of your responsibilities."
She offered the book to Sherlock, then pulled it back, leaving Sherlock’s hand hanging in mid-air. Then she gave the book to John, who grabbed it reflexively.
I can almost hear the identical smirks from the men over the phone. The excitement is practically palpable, and I swear I hear one of them rubbing their hands together diabolically.
Sherlock couldn't stop the lazy grin that spread across his face. Usually he had better control of his transport, but John's very existence seemed to be doing odd things to it.
The sorting hat took its time before declaring her a Slytherin, to which the table on the far left burst into applause. Irene hopped off the stool, and looking relieved, she joined her fellow Slytherins.
“Jim Moriarty. Hi.” The boy said, grabbing his hand and shaking it enthusiastically. “A pleasure to meet you.”
"I never specified what 'going well' meant." Tom said. "I personally think this is going splendidly."
“You’re an arse.” John said weakly, trying to fight the fog that was taking over his mind. “A big, giant arse.”
“It hardly matters.” Sherlock replied, leading John into the underground, masses of dragon’s with their human pets milling around them. “I don’t
John was undeniably good at Quidditch, scoring several points right away. The Ravenclaw keeper couldn't keep up with John, who swooped through the players as if he had been playing forever. A few times Sherlock caught himself cheering with the Gryffindors, not that he was the only one; several Ravenclaws were getting elbowed by their neighbours for the exact same reason.
“Oh, we’re enjoying having you here!” Violet said, her smile wider than Sherlock had ever seen it. “Now come along. We haven’t eaten lunch yet!”
, yes.” John said, grabbing the front of Sherlock’s shirt and pulling him into another kiss. The kettle continued to whistle, only stopping when it ran out of water. Sherlock and John barely noticed, paying attention to nothing but the two of them as the kissed the night away.
"I did," Sherlock grumbled. "The servant died of gunshot wound. Very few dragons will use a gun, as it's a human weapon."
John spent the next few hours cleaning. The amount of junk that Sherlock had built up over the years was completely ridiculous. John swept, scrubbed, and dusted until his fingers were numb, and the job wasn't even close to being done.
"Me either, thanks," Victor said, looking up long enough to flash her a smile. "One of the prefects gave me some Christmas sweets already."
Sherlock worked quickly, taking advantage of the clueless crowd. Taking a small coin out of his pocket, he jammed it into the latch so that it would close, but not lock. Then, he stepped away, continuing his path around the room like nothing happened.
"Damn it," Sherlock muttered, slowly speeding up to weave around the light, early morning traffic. The car followed seamlessly, keeping enough of a distance to not arouse suspicion.
Sherlock smirked to himself, walking around the tank slowly as to get a better look. The tan flesh of the creature blended seamlessly into the green scales of his tale, which flashed brightly in the light. The creature's torso was corded with muscle, and Sherlock could see translucent webbing between his fingers. There was some old scarring on the right side of his caudal fin, and Sherlock frowned as he tried to place the scarring pattern.
"Sherlock?" John interrupted him softly. "I would very much like to kiss you again, if that's alright with you."
"Oh look! It's Hogwarts!" Molly said, effectively cutting off anything else Jim wanted to say. She pointed at something just behind Sherlock, and he turned to see a castle looming above the lake.
On this day, August 31st, in 1990, a child by the name of Robottko was born. It was decreed that every year on her birthday, she shall update every fanfiction that is a WIP. So, it is with great honor that I present to you this update.
“No.” Sheol said, his eyes going wide. “You were my soul-mate, you can’t have died. Please come back to me.”
"Sherlock, John, I need to talk to you both. Now." Lestrade sounded sharper than normal, and he looked exhausted.
“You have been keeping him busy.” Greg snorts. “He’s been complaining to me this entire week about you.”
“All alone?” Sheol asks, raising a dark eyebrow. “I would much rather you and Abel come with me. The adventure would be all the more exciting.”
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock replied, watching him now. He had been ignoring his hunger throughout the exchange, but he could not deny it any longer. Watson’s blood smelled delectable, and he knew he had to have it. “I shall not keep you. It was good to meet you.”
The next day at lunch, John sat down next to Sherlock at the Ravenclaw table, causing a majority of the Great Hall to stop and stare.
"That's alright," Sherlock said, a small smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. "There's a nice Italian place on Northumberland Street. The owner owes me a favour."
John frowned at the way he stressed boyfriend, as if they were still dating. "Look, you need to move on. This isn't good for you."
Scowling at himself, Sherlock made his way to a side door that blended in with the wall. He turned the knob discreetly, please to find the door give way. A quick inspection showed that it locked from the inside, and that it led immediately outside.
“Why should they have? It’s common sense.” Sherlock replied. “They knew you would attempt it, and so they put it in as a precaution.
Sherlock cut him off with his lips, pressing them desperately against John's. The kiss lasted only a moment, but it felt like nearly a lifetime before he pulled away.
“It doesn’t matter right now.” The man said stalking forward and invading John’s personal space. “What matters is how foolishly you’re acting. You were going to attempt to take your own life.”
Sheol tried to get between the brothers, placing his hands out to keep them at bay. The black gloves the Shining One gave him contrasting with his white arms. “Friend-brothers, please-”
With a sick feeling in his stomach, Sherlock unwrapped his second gift. He knew what it was, but he desperately hoped that he was wrong. He never
The room was almost completely full of policemen before Sherlock fully grasped the gravity of the situation. One moment he was enjoying John’s smile, and then suddenly the room was packed with two dozen or so of Scotland Yard’s finest, several guns pointed at each person seated around the dinner table.
Sherlock's mobile began to ring, halting John's hesitant speech. He sighed, shoulders slumping as if in defeat.
“I am the prince of the planet Holmes.” Purple smirked. “Twenty years ago I was exploring your galaxy when I discovered your planet. I was drawn to the small island you call Great Britain, where I discovered you. I decided then that you would be mine.”
"I proved that while the murder was being committed, Angelo was all the way across town burglarizing a house," Sherlock explained when he saw John's shocked look.
“You are trying to throw away yourself because of one idiot king?” Mycroft asked, his eyebrows raising. “He was never your soul-mate, Sheol.”
Of course, that was easier said than done. Sherlock checked everywhere he knew looking for John: his flat, a coffee shop he frequented, and a Chinese place down the road, but John wasn’t there.
"You took ages." Sherlock complained looking up from his prone position on the bed. "I was starting to think you-"
John gave him another hard look before scooting out of the booth. He strode towards the door, not paying any attention to Sherlock who had rushed to scurry after him.
"Yes, well, other times it’s not." Sherlock sniffed. "Now, this has been marvellously fun, but I've got cases to solve."
“My pleasure.” Irene replied. “I was going to ask if you wanted me to use them on you, but it looks like the old saying is correct: all the cute ones are gay.”
He had received his first human at the age of ten years old. The slave, a human named Greg, was promptly declared a complete bore, then given to his elder brother, Mycroft. Mycroft already had a slave, of course. A pretty girl that Mycroft had named Anthea had been serving him for seven years already, and Mycroft had stated on several occasions that Anthea could do the work of twenty slaves, and that he would never need a second one. Sherlock could tell Anthea was pleased when Greg came to work for Mycroft, however, though she never would have admitted it.
"I play the violin," Sherlock offered with a shrug. "Sometimes I don't talk for days on end. Potential boyfriends should know the worst about each other."
"Something about not appreciating him enough, or something." Victor rolls his eyes. "I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention."
“Yes, I suppose you can.” Mycroft looked amused, and he pulled out the phone, handing it to John. “Just don’t let Sherlock see. He’s the keymaster, you know, and apparently he’s taking his job
“You are hardly an authority figure on the subject, but I thank you for your support.” He says, and though the words should be offensive, there isn’t any bite in them. I grin at Sherlock.
A great majority of the dialogue was taken from ‘A study in scarlet’ by Arthur Conan Doyle. I wanted to portray how Holmes and Watson originally met in 1881. George Lestrade is intended to be Greg Lestrade’s grandfather. It would also explain why Sherlock can never remember poor Greg’s first name.
“Well, this one can.” John sighed, rolling his eyes. “I can also punch you if need be, so stop ignoring my questions.”
“Not a curse, Sheol. A gift.” Otto corrected as he had many times before. “And I don’t care about the risks.”
It was the second weekend after classes started that found Sherlock up in the owlery. Mycroft had been pestering him since they arrived to write to their parents, and Sherlock had refused just to spite Mycroft. But he found himself rather homesick, so he took up his quill and penned a letter to his mother.
John climbed down the ladder when Mycroft entered the room, raising an eyebrow at the scene. “I feel as though I missed something.”
“Mycroft?” The officer who had first spoken asked, looking surprised. He took off his protective helmet, silver hair catching Sherlock’s eye.
It wasn’t long before they were pulling up in front of the estate, and John half expected to see Sherlock peering out the window. But no one came running out to greet them. John grabbed the new stockpot, accompanying Siger inside.
"But it wasn't him," I repeat. I won't let Sherlock take the fall for something that was clearly my fault, which is why I did the only thing I could think of to save him. "It was me."
After stopping by the main office to grab his information packet, (a bright green packet with 'St. Bartholomew's Academy stamped on the front) he milled around, trying to get his bearings. The college wasn't overly large or anything, but it would still be easy to get lost if he wasn't paying attention.
“Making out.” The other says with a hearty chuckle. I cough in mortification, heading for a different seat.
Everything we try doesn’t seem to be working. Sherlock still seems to be totally in love with Victor, so much so that he barely talks to me anymore, and the idea of turning the Plastics against Victor seems to be fruitless. A month after the Halloween party, and all we had managed to do was make Victor’s hair smell minty.
is terribly old fashioned. At most, I'll only be able to text you." Sherlock looked up and John, confused as to why he was so put out. "It's not as if your summer will be dull. You can talk with that Sarah girl."
"Gustav!" A boy wearing a blue and bronze Ravenclaw scarf made Sherlock jump. His skin was a dark brown, and his black hair was perfectly coiffed. "God, I am so sorry! He's usually so well behaved. Are you hurt?"
"I...what?" John frowned, sitting up so he could better see Sherlock. "Sherlock, it's only the second day. I
John smiled at him. It was a nice smile, and Sherlock wouldn't mind seeing more like them from John. Sherlock smiled back, gesturing towards John’s paper.
“Fine.” John huffed. He strode over to the car, opening it up with as much anger as he could muster, plopping down in the seat.
"Fine, if you won't stay away from school, the least you can do is stay away from that boy," Sherlock said.
The car had barely come to a halt before Sherlock and John were piling in, leaving a respectable distance between them. They had only known each other for an hour; they hadn't even gotten to eat dinner. So why did Sherlock feel so melancholy about losing John?
"Hello," I say politely as I try not to breath. The guy smells like he bathed in beer before coming here, and not the expensive stuff either.
A blond haired boy stood in the doorway to their carriage, clad in a red and gold Gryffindor jumper and a kind smile.
"The angel of life." Mycroft's voice stole Sherlock's attention, and he turned to look at the angel. "He's been working a long time on him."
"That I would have much more success in relationships if I didn't constantly try to date gay men," She finished, looked harried. "Yes, you've pointed that out numerous times before."
Sherlock blinked, looking around the Gryffindor common room. He had snuck in around 3 o'clock that morning, unable to fall asleep.
John wakes up with a startle, heart pounding with every loud “No” coming from downstairs. A quick glance at his nightstand - 03:08 - and he’s out and rushing downstairs. The living room is dark, the kitchen even darker and he directly heads for Sherlock’s bedroom, getting ready for anything that might be happening in there.
“You do know you can tell me anything, right?” John replies, wondering how long it will take them to stop being so careful around each other.
Sherlock kisses at his neck, slowly, tentatively, and John’s entire body shivers. His own pleasure is being shattered into million pieces, months and months of dreaming of
Sherlock follows him to the exit, not letting go of his hand, and he tugs them toward the locker to get his coat. John remains silent and close, their bodies pressed side to side, and Sherlock doesn’t bother putting his coat back on, waves of heat coming off of him. They stumble outside, not exchanging a word, and John manages to hail a cab quickly, pushing him inside after him.
John pushes the door open, his breath catching at the sight of the double bed perfectly made. He wonders if Sherlock takes care of it himself, if he comes to this room regularly to clean everything and make sure the sheets are perfectly made just in case he showed up.
John doesn’t reply immediately, throat suddenly dry and his fingers tightening into a fist at his side, “Oh, I see.”
“I’ll pass if you don’t mind,” John says immediately, the mere thought of watching Vicor flirt with Sherlock all evening making him sick.
“I was serious when I said I didn’t mean to bring it up,” John whispers, suddenly afraid to break the atmosphere settling around them. “I’ve had dates that were just about sex, and this is far from it.” Sherlock’s eyes search his for a long moment, and John lets him read there whatever he needs to find. “You are breathtakingly beautiful, Sherlock, and I’d be lying if I said I don’t want you, but I want so much more than that too.”
They stare at each other in silence, and when Greg does leave, John finds himself wishing he hadn’t. Even Rosie has stopped mumbling, chewing on her toy and watching him. Strangely, everything seems to slow down as he phone beeps with a new mail, and when John finally,
Another full laugh dies off into a kiss, slowly turning more and more demanding. John, ever so careful, turns them over to settle back between Sherlock’s open legs. They kiss for a long moment, arousal building up again. Trying to be as gentle as possible, John takes his time to properly prepare Sherlock, getting everything he needs and pushing one finger after the other inside him without ever looking away from his face. Sherlock, surprisingly, turns out to be an open book, emotions dancing in his eyes with each thrust of John’s fingers. The constant
XX67: Yes. Having all the time in the world doesn’t matter if we’re not spending it together. Day and night.
“I have no idea what I’m supposed to do, and I’m fairly sure people aren’t supposed to lie fully clothed in bed with the person they desire, but I trust you to tell me, to show me,” Sherlock confesses, the ache in his chest giving space to something much warmer. “I’m just as scared, because I could ruin this all in less than a second. Could be ruining it all already.”
Sherlock doesn’t reply, not exactly sure how he could explain what went through his head at the time. John stares right back at him, and for a long moment, they don’t say a word. Sherlock wonders if this is how dates work; feeling helpless and on the edge of either combusting or running away. Inhaling deeply, he allows himself to let his guard down once and for all: “I didn’t.”
John lets his own closed, bringing their lips together in a ghost of a kiss, barely a caress sending chills down his spine. Sherlock breathes out, loud, against his skin. John can feel his smile the next time he leans in, pushing more firmly against his mouth and earning a quiet moan in return. He pulls away, just far enough to be able to feel that one second when he goes back for more, absolutely certain that Sherlock will be there to give it to him.
He leaves the clinic at exactly six pm, deciding a cab will be faster than the subway. He checks his phone a dozen times, open a new text message twice without ever typing anything before finally pocketing it again. Leg bouncing, he watches the building blurring away, teeth worrying at his lower lips. Another eternity passes before the cabbie finally parks in front of Baker Street and John is out in a matter of seconds.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispers because he can’t recall having said so today, because John needs to know that he’s there too, all the way.
I’m going to talk to you about January 30th 2010, or more precisely about the night you spent lying awake in bed. That was the night you considered doing something stupid, or so you thought. That was the night you wondered what John would say if you showed up at his door and just said,
Horsen lets out a small laugh, "Your jealousy is pathetic," he breathes, eyes fixed on Sherlock. "Watching the two of you earlier made it all oh so much better."
It was later, after I had gotten home and swapped the large green t-shirt for a more comfortable jumper that I got a text.
Sherlock stayed silent for a moment, annoyed that Greg was correct. Angels could be difficult to deal with on the best of days. “And of the ‘R’ and the ‘K’?”
"Sherlock." John said, his mind reeling quickly. It was more of a statement than anything else. The smile Greg shot him made him feel strangely proud.
The officers continue to ignore Sherlock, and they lead me towards the doors. The handcuffs bite into my wrist, but they're the most comforting thing since I learned of Oliver's death this morning. If Sebastian wanted me out of the way, then this would do it.
"I have a present for Sherlock, too," John's soft voice says at last, and Sherlock turns to blink at him in confusion. He looks upset, but not for himself. Though why John would be upset for Sherlock, he would never know.
“You don’t really have a choice.” Sherlock sighed softly, looking at the blue scarf pointedly. “You see, I need a boyfriend for the weekend to impress mummy.”
"Your jumper," Sherlock replied. "You've repaired it a few times. The stitches aren't a simple whip-stitch; they're surgical in quality.  Of course, they could be from a previous partner, but you've only recently come back. Difficult to maintain a long distance relationship while in the military, and you've also indicated that it's been a while since your last date. Also, Molly Hooper mentioned you were a doctor."
Kublai Khan’s military began to fail, and he sank into a deep depression, eating and drinking far more than he used to. His time was coming.
“Right. Thanks for all the help, but I think I should be fine now.” John said, turning so his legs dangled off the table. Immediately, the light overhead his table that had been shining a nice, yellow went bright red. Startled John looked up, trying to figure out why the light had changed colours.
“Yes, I accept.” John replied, striving for a calm, collected tone. He was failing miserably. “I will give you my soul in exchange for my sister’s.”
“Oh hush, Sherlock.” Violet sighed, patting his shoulder. “This is the attitude you always had with your childhood…er…well, they weren’t friends…”
“Sherlock Holmes,” He answers, his brow furrowing at what the speaker tells him. “What do you mean, someone died? Victor…no, I don’t care that this means your father will be out of the house all evening, I…oh.”
"So, what exactly is it you do?" John asked, keeping pace easily with Sherlock. His cane moved in time with his steps, but John didn't put any weight onto it at all.
“Oh, shut up.” I say with a roll of my eyes. My mobile chooses at that moment to beep, a welcome relief from Sherlock’s scrutiny. “One moment, I have to take this.”
“Right.” Lestrade sighed, and he went over, handcuffing Mycroft in a regretful sort of manner. “Because you are accomplices in this crime, we have to take your whole family in as well.”
Of course, he should have predicted that gravity worked different on this strange new planet. He expected it to have been stronger, so his pod-ship came crashing down in a loud bang.
"Because the evidence is adding up against you," Lestrade said, pulling out a familiar Sig Sauer P226R. John's breath caught in his throat as he looked down at the gun, trying not to remember the last time he had held it.
“You’re actually going to go look?” Sherlock asked, raising an eyebrow in John’s general direction. Not that he could see him, of course. The lack of outside lighting made it difficult to see.
John surreptitiously slid a hair grip from a nearby dragon’s hair, holding his breath until he was positive she had not noticed the missing hair-piece. He grinned as he fiddled with the hair grip, expertly unlocking the high-tech collar.
Sherlock never did make it to the interview, and while a large portion of the blame fell to the fact that he stopped by the crime scene, the blame rested in the fact that he didn’t really want to go. Oh, he had promised Father that he would attend, but he hadn’t wanted to, so when he looked at his phone and discovered that he was already fifteen minutes late for the interview, it wasn’t with a heavy heart that he turned to go to work instead.
"But you didn't even finish your coffee," she protested, but Sherlock waved her off, leaving quickly through the front door. He needed to put as much distance between himself and that paper as possible.
“Victor is cheating on you, though.” I shake my head. Sherlock doesn’t look remotely surprised by my revelation, however.
"Yes." He admitted, sounding almost guilty. "Not with that ring, obviously. That's the wedding band, not the engagement ring, but I was going to propose, yes."
!” John interrupted, clawing at his hair. Mary was silent for a moment before speak, her tone scornful.
“What do you think?” The voice of his father distracted him, and he looked over to see that his father looking a bit disgruntled. The cabbie, on the other hand, looked beyond pleased. It was obvious to see who had won
John turned to find the source of the voice, and swallowed thickly when he saw him. The man was six feet of gorgeous, lean muscles, dark curls, and mischievous smiles.
“That is…acceptable.” Sherlock sighed. John took that as permission, and he left the house, his coat still wrapped around his lithe frame from earlier.
“God, where could you possibly have gotten to?” Sherlock muttered, walking through Hyde Park quickly, feeling where John’s soul had travelled not too long ago.
“Moved here from Afghanistan. My dad was in the army.” I explain quickly, “We lived there for four years…so since I was 12.”
"Right, hi." The man, John Watson he could presume, smiled wryly at him. "Blind dates...bit different in my day."
Victor tied the letter to Gustav's leg, guiding him out the window. The owl took off, quickly disappearing around the curve of the tower.
“Er…no. A vampire.” I say slowly, raising an eyebrow at the blond. She gave me a startled look, and I wondered if my costume was that ineffective.
DI Lestrade gives me one last smile, then he's down to business, his pen poised over his notepad. There are notes scribbled everywhere, even in the margins, and the little bit that I can read upside down doesn't make sense.
“A play off ‘Sheol,’ naturally.” Sherlock’s voice was bored, “I adopted a few letters from my past…clients. Now, you didn’t call me here to discuss my name choices, did you?”
"I've got a cane," John replied. "I got kicked out of the army because of my limp. I think that constitutes as broken."
"You tried to jump into the tank," John said, looking up at Sherlock. "You would have if I hadn't stopped you."
I breathe a sigh of relief when no one follows me. Jim and Sebastian would take care of telling Victor about my fake boyfriend, and in a week I'll tell them that we'd broken up. Until then, Sherlock and I would be busy trying to figure out who was killing the students around me, and how we could make them stop.
“I saw your family, and I saw them hand me a book.” John replied. “And I saw you get jealous about it.”
“I just…I don’t know.” I stutter slightly, trying to figure out a way to repair whatever damage Victor had done at that stupid Halloween party. “I miss going on cases with you.”
Jim swayed a bit in place, and John wrapped an arm around his waist to keep him upright. This only served to annoy Sebastian, and he picked up the speed.
“Later!” Mike says equally as soft, and the two of them dart off down the hall. I watch as they leave, sighing to myself before turning back to Victor.
John groaned, rubbing his hand over his face. How do you tell someone that their dead boyfriend is planning on killing them?
“The things I said in this message,” he begins carefully, “I should have told you like this, face to face.” Sherlock opens his mouth as if to reply but apparently decides against it, looking much more panicked all of a sudden. “I meant every word, Sherlock.”
“Madeleine owns the house for years, she used to be a chef but decided to open her own restaurant and chose this particular setting.” Sherlock gestures around the room. “In her own house. Only four table. Very private. Very good food.”
“It was nice to meet you,” Victor says, coming to shake his head and by doing so blocking Sherlock from John’s view. “Until next time.”
John smiles, looking at the severals pictures of the two man all over the walls, “How long have you two been flatmate?”
