"Ahhhh Dean" I let out a moan as his finger brushed against my prostate. I felt him smirk against my neck while he kept abusing my prostate.
"Now why would I want to do that not only am I getting married to him against my will but I'm also a demon helping people isn't my thing"
"Ok, if you say so." he rolls his eyes at me. I walk around him to go sit down on the chair next to him
"I don't know. Some people are desperate like there family is in danger or someone they love is dying. there are also the people who want revenge on someone or they just want money"
"Dad's right. It's getting late and Cas needs you right now."  Oh my god. Cas! I run out of the room as fast as I could before acknowledge Sam's statement. I run over to me and cas's side of the castle bumping into a few maids and butlers on the way. When I get to the door I hesitate before going in. I mentally prepare myself for what awaits behind the door.
"You think this is easy for me. I was just told that I have to have a kid on the way before the end of this year" He sits next to me
"Dad its not pointless they act like they're better than us, when we are just as good as them maybe even better, but I guess you're right. Just be smart about this." and with that he walked off
"Ok, let's go to sleep" I tighten my arms around him to try and protect him from whatever is going on in his mind right now.
I open the first one and inside there is a necklace that has inscription on it and it says 'through the fire'. It was always a phrase that we said to each other when we were going through rough times. Like when my  mom died and when Michael and Lucifer left.
After lunch dean left to go do some training so I went to the library to do some light reading. When I enter the library it is empty, which is great because I like absolute quiet when I read. I pick out my book at I go to sit on the couch. I open my book and just as I start reading I hear a voice calling my name.
"Yeah, yeah. I know we both hate angels, we both sleep around, both great fighters blah blah blah. Sure but if you think about it those are just the traits of every demon. Alastair, you're not that special. Which is why no one will miss you" his eyebrows raise
"He is going to say the exact same thing. He has more important thing to do. So just go back to the dungeon and do what you do best and go torture some souls"
"You looked so peaceful, I know that ever since dad told you that he was marrying you off, you haven't been getting enough sleep. Plus I like to see that frazzled look on your face.
I was woken up by my stupid brother yelling in my ear. Saying something about me getting hitched and all that. I got up and brushed my teeth and got in the shower. While I was in the shower, I started to think about my future and this marriage arrangement. Were me and dean going to see other people. Would we be a real couple. Do I have to sleep with him on our wedding night? Oh god I hope not. Ugggggghhhh this is so complicated. I stopped thinking before I started crying. Even though that's what I did  most of last night or at least until I fell asleep. I step out of the shower and put on my clothes . While I'm brushing my teeth I hear my chambers door open.
"Then when? When will you be ready to talk about it?"  he says in a eerily calm voice. I could tell he was trying to stay patient with me
" Hmm Castiel. Such a pretty name. I'll keep that in mind" I let go of his collar and he drops with a groan. I turn around to go back to my room to wash the blood off me.
"So...I heard you got married... to an angel. Angels are such pretty things. I bet he is a screamer just like the others I've tortured." He says with a stupid grin on his face. I clench my fists
I chuckled "Rough month" I say taking a sip of  whatever was in my cup. "Yeah I heard you got married last month. Is it going that bad?"
I was at the cafe waiting for John I was early so I had time to order a coffee. Around ten minutes later I saw a demon dressed in a black expensive suit. He looked around and when he saw me he walked over and he held out his hand for me to shake, I shook it and told him to sit down.
I wince when I start to walk over to the bathroom. I started to blush a little at the memory of last night. I turn on the shower and wait for it to warm up.  I look over at my jewelry box. I know the morning after pills are in there waiting to be used. I'm silently debating with myself on whether to take them or not. I know John has been breathing down Dean's neck for an heir but on the other hand I'm just not ready for a child. I open the box and pull out a pill and grab a glass of water and swallow it.
"Stop smelling me and go to your meeting" He pulls away a give me a peck on the lips and slaps my ass
" your right. I wanted to see how you and castiel adjusting to married life. but judging how you guys are sleeping in different bedrooms, I guess I got my answer."
I see Gabe's eyes start to water and before I know it we were crying in each others arms wishing that there was something else anything else that we could do but there wasn't.
"I know about you deano. You sleep with anything that breathes and then you leave and never call them. You get into a bunch of fights especially when you are drunk. Which I'm sure you are drunk like 70% of the time. I know that due to your mom passing you are afraid of commitment. But let me make myself clear. If you ever and I mean EVER cause my brother any pain or strife, I will smite you. That is not a threat, it is a promise." He says in a serious tone and judging by  his nick name" the trickster" I'm sure that this is one of the times that he is not joking. Before I can respond he leaves with my cookies and a glass of milk .
I walk into the bedroom that is 3 doors down and set down my pillow and blanket( the room has blankets but I don't know when was the last time they were cleaned ) I don't bother to read any of my book because I am too tired. I blow out the candle and go to sleep.
" Well dean you better get used to the idea. Because sooner or later it is going to happen." I turn and move towards the door when I feel a hand grab my arm.
"Fine." I said curtly, I wasn't in the mode for small talk I had a long day, it was late and I want to go to bed.
"Are you saying no?"  As soon as I said this the guard came over unlocked him from the wall but kept his chains on, he then gave me the keys and goes back to his post. I yank alistair out of the cell and down the hall.
I laid down in my bed thinking about that awful dinner. I mean I have and my fair share of awkward and boring dinners, but this one takes the cake.
"Dean murdering someone takes a toll on your mental health" I'm starting to lose my patience with him getting in my way. I have every right to do what I'm about to do to that sack of shit that hurt Cas.
" Ahh. You sure you weren't just looking for a fight?" He says while taking a bandage and wrapping it around my hand.
"Yeah, neither does heaven. I know one other option but I don't think that it would work, I mean unless you have a son or daughter "
I walk out of my room thinking about what does my father want with me. He usually talks to me about serious matters about the war or if I did something wrong. It's usually the latter. I haven't done anything to bad the past few weeks I usually keep to myself in my room during the day and go out and party at night. I'll get into the occasional bar fight but nothing big.
"Aww leaving so soon dean I was hoping to get to know you, I mean we are family now" I turn around and see lucifers red eyes train on me
"'He who crosses must pay if chosen to'. You crossed me, so you must pay" he gets up and charges at me, but he is then held back by an invisible force. The force pushes him back to the ground. Alistair looks behind him and sees glowing blue eyes. I crouch down next to alistair and point at the eyes that are coming closer and slowly becoming a figure with wings
When dinner ended Castiel and Gabriel excused themselves and shortly after ,Me and Sam did the same and We went our separate ways to our rooms.
"Castiel do you know how demons and angels  seal their bonds? They have to mark them. From the inside, if you know what I mean."
"Please. PLEASE. Don't do this." I sob against his hand, but my pleas fall on deaf ears. He flips me over on my stomach and pushes my arm at an awkward angles against my back.
"Dean, it's a simply statement. What's not to understand!?" I see sam starting to get red in the face. I don't like where this is going. The last time I saw sam this upset was when he found out I was getting married to Cas or when I used his favorite book as a footstool when I was younger.
"Dean,Please." He takes his head out of my neck and looks at me. His eyes aren't their usual vibrant green but much darker.
"If you want to make a good first impression you can help them unpack maybe even meet Castiel." My dad says in a suggestive tone.
"I'm not stupid, Dean and I would appreciate it if you didn't treat me as such" he says while crosses his arms
"Y-Your highness" the one with light blonde hair bows down. He hits the other one on the arm to do the same.
"Deano, for what do I owe the pleasure?" he smiles at me eerily. I look towards the guards then back at alistair
I lay awake for awhile thinking about dean. He literally just killed for me. I feel like I barely know but on the other hand I feel like I know him inside and out. which brings me to the question of the day
"Hold up. You didn't shoot him on sight?" I was furious. This man tried to rape MY husband. He tried to force him into something didn't want and something he wasn't ready for. Ya' know what? I'm glad that Sam didn't kill him because it gives me a chance to kill him first.
I look in the mirror and tighten my tie .I hear the door open, I look to see who it is and it's my father
"What are you doing?" I look back at him. He is standing with his arms crossed while tapping his foot on the ground.
"Mr. Winchester with all due respect. Dean and I aren't ready for children. Don't you think it's a little early to start thinking about this?"
Crowely bowed his head and left me and the angel alone. The angel had blonde hair and cloudy blue eyes and had little cuts on his face,but the rest of his body was fine aside from his dirty cloths.
"It's my right. I'm allowed to so technically I'm not getting my hands dirty if I'm not doing anything wrong"
"Yeah, you can go faster" he nods his head and starts to speed his thrust up. The pain fades and is replaced with pleasure. He thrust directly into my prostate and I instantly start to feel myself growing closer. Dean snakes his hand on to my cock and starts to jerk me off.
"Do you know how to draw an angel warding" he nods "Good put some extra on the cage" I let go of him and walk out before he can respond
"Dean just because you are able to do this doesn't mean you should. You are a prince you are supposed to keep your hands clean"
"Thanks babe. I've just been working non-stop" I sit back down and put my head on my desk. I hear cas pick up the papers I were signing
I see dean getting closer and closer until I'm at the alter. I feel Gabriel let go of my arm and whisper something in my ear.
When I get out of the shower, I put on my clothes and pack the rest of my stuff and head out to the east wing to move into my new room. I hope Castiel has already left.
"You are going to move into the Winchesters a week before the wedding. and we are leaving tomorrow morning so we can get settled in and then we will have dinner with the Winchesters."
"Please, I bet it will be at least 2 months. I mean one of them hates angel and is very stubborn the other hates demons and is a total stuck up prude. Id be surprised if they even start liking each other in 3 months let alone 2."
Now all I need to do is send it."Donna!"I yelled and around 5 minutes later a blonde women comes in"Yes my lord?" she says "I need you to send this letter to heaven ASAP."
I didn't really feel like talking to anyone but I should cherish the time that I have with him because I don't know how much time I have left here.
"Ok let's start. I assume you guys don't have any vows for each other." both dean and I shook our heads "Ok, then, Do you Dean Winchester  of hell take this man to have and hold and to be true and faithful til death you part"
I walk into my dads study due to being called there.I haven't talked to my father since he told me that I was getting married.
I was lacing my combat boats. I had an early morning of training troops and unfortunately my father would have my head if I was late. I am already on thin ice with him. Why? I don't even know. It seem nothing is good enough for him. But alas that's just John Winchester stubborn ,mean, judgmental and a bunch of other "wonderful" qualities.
"Castiel. you don't recognize your own brothers voice?" I look around again and I see someone appear right in front of me.
"The cage is the highest piece of security ever. It hols lucifer in by all the warding and is coated with holy oil and much more"
I enter my room and I see cas sitting on the bed reading his book. he looks up at me when he hears the door close and he gasps. He quickly gets up and walks over to me
"You know, alistair? I am so tired of piece of shits like you who think they are better than everyone else. You go around thinking you are entitled to everything and everyone." I get up into his face "Well guess what you can't" I stand back up and roll up my sleeves
I got into my car and I started driving from Charlie's house. I was speeding because I had to be there in 20 minutes and I had to change into something that didn't make me look like a bum. I mean I wanted to make a good first impression. I pull into the parking garage and run to my room. I enter my room and there is my bitch of a brother waiting for me.
It was actually pretty easy to avoid the them. I went out with my friends during the day and I partied at night. I had only seen Castiel once while I was moving some stuff into our new room. When he looked at me I put my head down and he just left the room.
Dean was a very attractive man. He dark golden hair,  beautiful freckles scattered over his face and back ( I got a glimpse while he was changing), his arms were very muscular, most likely from all the training he does. Dean also smells very nice, he smells like his apple cinnamon soup. His eyes. they are just gorgeous, In heaven green eyes are seen as special and rare. They also mean good fortune.
"Dad!" he says in a raspy voice. he clears his throat " We aren't talking about this right now. We just got married last month. It's too early to talk about kids." I decided to speak up at this time
"I don't care what you do. I just wanna go to sleep." I start walking back to the castle with sam by my side.
"You're gonna get it" I see out of the corner of my eye I see his fist raise and I close my eyes but the punch never comes. I open my eyes and I see sam pulling alastair off of me.
"Well it was stupid idea to try and steal on the princes wedding night when there would be guards everywhere."  before belphegor could say something back another voice cut him off
I walked along side of dean until we got to the dinning hall. he opens the door and we see deans dad there reading some papers. he looks up and takes his reading glasses off.
"Just having a bit of fun. Ya know where I'm from there is nobody as pure and beautiful as you." His eyes scan over my body. "Oh, I'm going to have fun ruining you." His hands start to go to my belt. Oh no this can't be happening I think to myself. I bit the hand that was on my mouth as hard as I can.
"No it is not normal for him to have his powers, how did he visit you" I started pacing around the room. Cas closed his book and looked at me .
I opened the letter with my expectations low due to the hate mail that we have gotten from hell in the past,But I have never gotten any letters from John winchester except when he sent me a letter telling me that King Henry(johns father) saying that he was taking over hell and taking his place as king.
It's been years going around in circles . Ambush after ambush.Not only was I tired of it but I just plain out bored .So I decided enough was enough. I was going to do something regardless of what my fathers wishes were. This wasn't his fight any more, it's mine so his dead ass can stick it where the sun don't shine.
I walk out into the kitchen and open the pantry and get a bunch of cookies then I go to the freezer and get a gallon of cookies and cream ice cream.
"You ready?" I nod and we walk towards the door. I look at the ball room one last time,before I turn around and start walking towards me and Deans new home.
What do I think about dean? Well nothing really, probably because he DIDN'T TALK THE WHOLE ENTIRE TIME! Other than like 3 words, unless you count stuttering. I know I wasn't any better than him at the talking part, I have heard about the Demon Dean Winchester always speaks his mind and always flirts with everyone even if he gets turned down. Maybe he was drunk or high. Or maybe he was nervous as well. I mean I was so nervous the only thing keeping me from puking or passing out was the fact that would draw attention to me and right now I already have enough attention on me. One thing that really stood out to me were his eyes. I mean woah...those eyes were the most beautiful shade of green I have ever seen. It was like a mixture of forest green and granny smith green.
"but that was all work stuff" Uh oh there is something wrong the last time he was thins nice was the day before my engagement and when he told me
"NO! You said that I would never have to worry about that.You said that if I decided to get married that it would be my choice to whomever I marry!" I say starting to yell. He was about to talk, but I cut him off.
"The last time you acted all girly was the time when you finally got Tessa that reaper to sleep with you."
He gets up quick and punches me back. I recover quick and I grab his shoulders and keep them in place while I knee him in the stomach.  he holds his stomach as he drops to the ground. I grab him by the collar and look him in the eye.
"Dean, we will worry about Alistair later. Right now you need to calm down." The fuck did he just say? How dare he say that?
When I was 4 years old my mom died. She was killed by a demon, she was out picking up supplies on earth and she was kidnaped tortured and she was killed in front of my big brother Michael. After that Michael couldn't stand the pain and guilt of him not being able to save her. So he left he went to a little cabin in the forest on earth to live alone.
The rest of dinner was silent or at least me and Castiel were. We didn't even look each other in the eyes. It was so awkward. How was I supposed to spend the rest of my life with this awkward little dude, who probably wouldn't know a relationship if it came up and bit him in the ass.
"Just curious to who finally tied him down, but I guess I'll go back to singing" Before he could start singing gerald spoke up
"Well I wonder why I won't, probably because you are a selfish bitch. You know, dean there are two people in this relationship, if you don't give then you don't get."he says while making angry hand gestures
I took him outside behind the castle, there I saw some servents hanging out there and staring at me and alistair. I walk past them into the forest behind the castle.
"Thank you. Now Cassie doesn't have to live in fear of him anymore" He picks up alistair and slings him over his shoulder almost like he weighs nothing, sometimes even I forget he is an archangel
"Same as the last time you asked and the time before. It's the same as life before except someone you barely know is always there. Ya know?"
"If you say I told you so I swear when I get out of here you will be the first I kill"  Mark held his hands in surrender
"Well I'm gonna go change in the bathroom and you can change out here" I don't wait for him to respond and I grab my pjs and head to the bathroom.
Things have been really good between Cas and I. That little makeout session we had turned into a budding romance. From stolen kisses to blowjobs and handjobs. Things have been really good the only issue is my father. Everytime Cas walks into a room I see my fathers eyes go straight to his stomach , give us knowing looks or he smirks at us. It's really creepy that my father is so involved.
I pushed those crazy thoughts to the back of my head and turned the corner and opened the doors to the throne room. When he walked in I saw my father reading some contract thingy that I didn't care to ask about. He looked up at my and smiled nervously.
"Let me pass" I say in a commanding tone. They move aside. I open the door and walk in to see the cage that holds lucifer. I see 2 guards by the cage just chatting away.
"If I see or even hear that you were around Castiel. I won't hesitate to kill you. I won't even blink." he looks at me with a smile on his face
Samandrial nodded his head and healed himself and put on the new change of cloths and he flew away with my letter.
" Alastair. What's up. thought you were in lockup for going a little too crazy on the torture. I say with a smirk
"We could do a peace treaty, but that would take months to draw up and I don't know about you, but hell doesn't have that time."
"I'm sure your not here to call me a hoe. So if I may ask why are you here" I say using my best manners so this conversation can be over with
"See if you were actually listening in school then you would know that there is one more and that is.."
I stood there frozen as I tried to process the information that I had just received. After a couple seconds I start to smile and laugh my ass off. After a couple minutes of uncontrolled laughter. I finally compose myself so I can say something.
"From who?" I asked curiously I mean I don't want to send a letter to chuck ,when he doesnt even want peace.
"See that? That's the archangel gabriel. See in heaven they have a similar rule to ours although on some level theirs is worse see, if an angel did what you tried to do then they get castracized. Which sucks because they have to live the rest of their lives as a dickless angel." I look at the mortified look on alistair's face and chuckle "So when I told gabriel what happened. To say he was pissed is an understatement but he is an angel so he can't some down here without permission so we made a deal: When I found you I will let him in so he can play around with you for a while and not the fun kind." I look up and see gabriel with a cold look on his face.
I woke up and went to the bathroom and got ready. I put on my best suit.I mean I have to dress to impress. I ate breakfast with my kids (Gabriel and Castiel) age in that order I have two other sons (Micheal and Lucifer), but they left due too the war and Gabriel wants to leave heaven, but he can't stand leaving Cas.
"Oh your still awake I thought you'd be asleep by the time I got back" dean says while untying his boots
"Well who the super duper lucky angel that got to marry dean winchester. WAIT no let me guess." he paused to think "Anna"
I gasp when dean rolls us over so that he is on top. He tugs off my sleeping pants and reaches over to the nightstand drawer for the lube.
"Yes, me you and Gabriel will stay a week and after your wedding Me and Gabe will leave" When my father says my wedding, my stomach drops I still can't believe that this is happening.
"You think your so much better than me huh? You think you can just sit up there on your royaltiy cloud singing preaches? Well news flash pretty boy, we aren't that different" Oh that's one you hear a lot too
When I finish changing and getting ready for bed. I leave the bathroom and let Cas brush his teeth and do what he needs to do. I look around the room. The maids did a pretty good job getting the room ready for me and Cas's arrival. I'm pulled out and of my thoughts by the sound of the door opening, I see Cas walk towards the gas lamp
I look at my clock and it reads 9:30 am. I have some time to kill so I think I'll take a shower and go hangout with Charlie and Benny. I told them about the arrangement and Benny was sad and Charlie was upset to say the least. They told my that they had heard about Castiel. They told me that he was a shy and to put it lightly.. a prude. I mean total virgin
"You would do it if it was mom" He immediately backed off if I was being completely honest I expected and punch but when I looked at him I almost saw understanding
"listen I'm going to have to cut this short I have some business to take care of. See ya later Cassie"
"I don't think it's too early to think about this. If you think about it could take you a while to conceive. I don't know if you two know but demons and angels, they're energies don't mix very well. plus there could be miscarriages or unfortunate birthing accidents."
"Yes" Dean bent his head down to kiss at my neck. While carefully inserting a finger into my hole. At first it felt odd and kind of uncomfortable. Then his finger started to move around like it was searching for something.
"Oh come on dean we both know that it's not even a legitimate marriage I bet you guys haven't even done the deed. I bet you are going crazy from the month of celibacy you have been going through"
I pace my bedroom waiting for dean to comeback. I heard from Sam that Alistair was captured and I was happy, hell I was ecstatic. In heaven he would've been dead for attacking royalty but I guess it's different here because turns out the person who was victimized chooses what happens or at least the person who is in higher power chooses. In this case I guess dean is the higher power out of the two of us. It's because he is going to be king and because I married into the kingdom that automatically makes me below dean on some level. It doesn't bother me because dean treats me like an equal and he doesn't order me around like a slave so...no complaints here.
"Dean, sit down next to Castiel." I nod and walk over to the sit next to Castiel. He hasn't looked at me ever since I walked in he is just staring at his plate. We sit in silence Until Gabriel breaks the silence.
"Take care of him or else." He says while shaking deans hand and possibly squeezing it judging by dean face.
I was in my room reading some book about angel biology.It was stupid and more importantly kind of boring. Any way I was on chapter 3 when all of a sudden I get a knock on my door
"I hate rapists" before he could respond I shot him right in the temple. He falls down with his knees bent under him and his eyes wide open
"If I let you in, I just want to fly below the radar. Ya know? Live in the wild, alone and unbothered"
I was feeling a lot lighter after the hug. Maybe it was the first time in a month since I have had physical contact. Or maybe because it was the first time that me and dean have touched (Other from the night on our wedding)
"Dean!" I tell his name. I feel him come inside me painting my insides white.  I feel him get off of me and move over to my side. I struggle to catch my breath. I move to rest my head on deans chest while he buries his head in my hair. We sit there in silence not because it's awkward but because there is simply nothing to say.
Garth is a scrawny little dude and way too nice to be a demon if you ask me. The dude once started tearing up when he accidently stepped on a caterpillar.
"Dean, when are you going to get over this? What's done is done there is nothing you can do. So be a grown-ass man and take it. Who knows maybe you'll fall in love with Castiel.
"I thought you were supposed to be mischievous and chaotic. Not cold and cruel" He directed that comment towards Gabriel. Gabriel looks up at me and he smirks
I was out with a couple of friends at a club. I was sitting at the bar that was in the club,when I heard a familiar voice beside me.
After a couple minutes of making out I break the kiss to catch my breath. Dean starts sucking on my neck.
"Miss me?" I put on one my pristine white satin gloves, it's a whole thing when you take a life when you're a royal something about keeping clean, I pull my gun out from my back pocket to examine it
Things went back to normal. Well as normal as they can get. Me and castiel actually get along pretty well. We get up do our own thing and I stay out later partying. And doing what I always do. The only thing that is different is that I haven't gotten laid since Cas and I got married. It's not that I couldn't get anyone to sleep with me it's just that I thought that it would be disrespectful to Cas if I did. We may have gotten married against our will on short notice but I still have to respect the vow I took.
"None taken, I mean I was born a demon so, it's not like I chose to be here. But most of the people that come here are decent they just sell their souls to us in exchange for something"
" I know, I know, but what choice do I have huh? None. I'm trapped and there's nothing, I repeat nothing that I can do. I'm freaking out because I'm going to be living with a demon, sleeping in the same bed as a demon and I have to have sex with a fucking demon. How do you think that makes me feel? I wish that there was another way, I really do, but there isn't. There just isn't."
Anyways I would like to schedule a meeting so we can discuss ways to make peace. If you would be so kind to at least consider meeting me.
"Let me pass" I say to the 2 guards who immediately let me in. I walk into the cell and I see alistair chained to the wall
"Yup, Listen dean I don't like it either but its happening and there is nothing that we can do about it . So we might as well accept it." He said and then left. He had a point but how was I even supposed to accept the fact that I was getting married against my will.
"This is your fault belphegor if you hadn't tried to steal from the kitchen then we wouldn't be on guard duty for this stupid cage." Gerald pointed at belphegor
"That would take to long,Cas. Heaven and Hell don't have that kind of time,I'm sorry but this is happening."
After I finish getting in my sleeping clothes  and dean is finished brushing his teeth. We both crawl into bed. I blow out the candle that was on my nightstand and get comfortable under the covers. At first we face away from each other on our own sides of the bed. I turn over to face him, I grab his shoulder to signify that I want him to face me. He turns over a faces me with confused and sleepy eyes. I grab one of his hands and put it around my waist. I turn around and scoot my back into his chest and he wraps both of his arms around my waist and sighs contently.  I fall asleep feeling safe and content.
When my father passed I got the kingdom ,of course. His dying wish was for me to win this war and make the angels our slaves and I've been trying to do that but it's harder than he made it look. Angels are stronger than demons ,but not as strategic ,demons have been topside more than angels have been so it was easier for the demons to ambush the angels ,but like I said those angels were strong as hell.
Alistair is a huge jackass. (he is only 5 years older than me and he looks like he is in his 50s.) he works in the dungeon tortures souls and hostages etc. But man does he have a temper. he has gone to lockup for numerous thing like: murdering his own kind, aggravated assault, sexual assault, over doing torture, kidnapping and theft. We are demons not barbarians we kill everyone but our own, unless they deserve it. But we draw the line at assault, especially rape. To do that to someone is a very big line to cross to demon kind . We may be demons but we aren't evil monsters.
"Lord Winchester? It is time to wake up. May I come in?"she said in a soft tone. I rubbed my eyes and look at the clock on the wall. It reads 8:02. I don't know about you but that is pretty early.
It hit me how much I miss home. How much I miss my own bed, pillows and blankets. I miss the quiet maids that would always smile at me. The chef would always make me extra honey buns and he would never bat an eye. I miss everyone even my dads handmaiden who I'm 80% sure kinda wanted to kill me in my sleep.
"I can't even with you right now." Then I stood up and walked out of the room. When I got out of the room. My face was frozen and everything was blurry. I felt like I was about to puke from the news I just got. How could he do this to me. I just basically saw my freedom disappear. First I was shackled to my family and now I will be shackled to some dude who I'm supposed to marry. This is crazy and I don't want to spend anymore time thinking about it.
I was in my room making out with some chick. Caitlyn? Cathrine? Cassie! that's what her name was. Any way a guard comes knocking on my door but i just ignored  it . Then this dud didn't get the gist and knocked again.
There is smut in the chapter but if you don’t like that then you don’t have to read it. There are references to what they did but it isn’t crucial to the plot. I put * at the smut start and end points
I read the letter and when I finished I was ecstatic this war could finally end.I decided to write john back.
"Cas? Cas?!" Sam. I remember asking him for a book on gardening. Alastair pushes my face into the ground and shushes me right next to my ear. I push the back of my head into his nose hard enough for me to get my face of the ground and scream.
"I'll pass considering how cas doesn't want to be by me, quite frankly I don't really want to be by him either."
"Whatever, you still have to meet him. I expect you at 7:00 pm we are having dinner with the Shurleys. You better behave" He says his peace and then leaves. I'm sitting on my bed debating if I want to go meet Castiel and his family. I decide not to because I will meet them tonight at dinner.
"You smell like cheap perfume and sex." I turn around and I see Castiel leaning against the door way. He isn't wrong, I do reek of Lisa.
"What do you mean you caught alistair trying to rape Cas? That makes no sense." I look at sam with disbelief and confusion. I don't know what prank he is trying to pull but it is not funny. Now, putting salt instead of sugar in your coffee,that's funny, but this? Dude he need to work on his joking/pranking skills. I look over at my father who was in the room when Sam just burst in yelling "CAS WAS ATTACKED IN THE GARDEN" which caught me off guard. Dad is wearing the same expression as I was. Maybe he was a little more confused as to how this happened
" A smart choice? I have heard of this Dean Winchester.All he does is eat, sleep and hook up with everyone. Cas, let's not forget the fact that he hates and I mean HATES angels.He won't treat you with any respect, he won't be faithful, hell he might even make you his slave or worse his fuck toy!"
"Jesus, did Cas cut your nuts off or something? 'The birds are chirping so I can tell it will be a good day' dude what are you on?"  I turn away from him feeling my face start to heat up
" Castiel. What I meant was I don't want to sleep with you because you inexperienced in that field" I move to the foot of the bed to pick up my cloths.
I walk into my closet That is half packed up due to the fact that I have to move into my new room with Castiel. Luckily I don't have to sleep in there until the wedding night. Ugh just thinking about that makes my stomach drop. I get dressed in a suit and my hair looks decent. I open my door and I see the clock in the hallway and it says 7:01. Crap I'm late. I speed walk to the dinning hall . When I get to the double doors I hesitate before opening them. I finally open the doors and I look around and I see my  father and another man around his age who was sitting across from my father. I saw a golden haired boy how sat next to sammy . The golden haired was sitting across from a midnight black haired boy with great sex hair. I stood awkwardly by the door for a few seconds when I heard my father clear his throat.
He takes some warm water and dabs it on my knuckles to clean off the blood. Then he pours some alcohol on the clean side of the cloth and starts cleaning the wound very gently. I look at his face and I see his brows furrowed in concentration with his tongue  sticking out a little. he finishes my right hand and moves on to my left hand
About 5 hours later while I was getting ready for bed when I heard a flutter of wings and I turned around.It was Samandrial.He nodded his head and said that he delivered the letter to chuck,and with that he left.Now all that I could do was wait.
"I came to tell you that it's time for the ceremony to start. Sam is waiting for you by the door so he can walk you down to the alter." I look at myself once more and I sigh. This is it. The rest of my life starts soon. I thought to myself. I walk out of the room and walk down the hall and I find Sammy playing with the cuff of his sleeve. When he looks up, he looks at me and smiles
"ok, well I am trying to fix that.Do you know where heavens door is?"  I asked in a kind but serious tone. Samendrial nodded his head.
I hated leaving Cas this early especially after last night. But I left a note so hopefully he will understand.
"You're right." he releases his arms and looks at me. I look into his beautiful baby blue eyes for a moment. While he stares back at me. Then he breaks eye contact with me
"Thank you" It's like he new what I was talking about because I feel his arms tighten around me and whispers a soft "You're welcome" we stand like that for a few minutes until he pulls back and looks in my eyes
I spit out my tooth paste and turn towards in and say "Oh, Hello Dean" I say. We stand there awkwardly for a few seconds , then he decides to speak.
"There is no reason to be angry when you did that action out of the love in your heart." I see his breath hitch when I say love. I know dean has trouble with his feelings. These last few weeks have been proof of that. It's not like I've been any better, I haven't been very open with him either. But we communicate in different ways and sometimes that is enough.
"Do you want me to walk with you? Or tell dean?" I didn't feel like answering him. Right now I just wanted to sleep off all the bruises I have.
"Hello, Mr. Winchester.You have a busy day today. You have to finish moving into the East wing.  You have to over look some preparations for the ceremony and you have to get ready for the wedding." I can't believe the wedding is  here already.  I'm not surprised that this week has gone by fast. Due to the fact that this week has been solely based on avoiding the Shurleys.
"Hello? It's me, Dean."  I internally groan when  he tells me who he is. I have had 1 soul mission this week.  And that was to avoid Dean. I will be spending the rest of my life (which is pretty much forever ,I might add) I should get one last week of freedom.
" I don't know. Me and bess were in love before we got married. But even when we first met it wasn't awkward, we had just...clicked"
Dean waits about a minute or so before pulling out softly until just his tip remains. He slowly thrust back in. I'm sure he can tell by my face that I'm a little uncomfortable.
"Nah, I'll see him soon enough. Plus I think you two have some things to talk about" He winks at me and flys away
The rest of the night was just a blur to me. All I did was put on a fake smile and talk to a bunch of people that I didn't know. The only thing that I did pay attention to was castiel. All he did was keep his head down and stand next to me. I guess I get why he was doing that considering how he didn't know anyone and how everybody there was a demon except for his family.
This is so unfair He promised, he promised me that I would never have to do this. I hate this, I hate my stupid father, I hate this stupid war with these stupid dumbass demons. I hate the fact that I'm in this situation. This war isn't my fault, so why am I fixing it ,why am I the one who is paying the price. Why is this my life,my reality.
"No. No I can't. Do you know why? Because I'm getting married to an angel and not just any angel I guess. I assume that this angel is chuck's kid if he even has one."
"I don't belong to dean, and if you excuse me I have to go" I tug my hand out of his grip and walk away. As I was making my way to the door alistair grabs the back of my neck and throws he down
"Cas, you feel so good" I hear him gasp into my neck. He thrust into me one more time. Which is enough I send me over the edge.
After hours of thinking of what to do,I decided that the best thing to do was to write the king of heaven,Chuck Shurley. So I head to my office and started writing.
"Bullshit! You slept with someone else. You know I'm fine with you partying, drinking even getting high. But I cross the line at cheating."
I smile at the note and lied back down. I should get up soon. I would like to check out the library in person for the first time in a while. I have no problem with Dean bringing books to me but I just prefer to go in person.
" No no, Gerald you are  the crazy one Dean Winchester is like a sex god and he isn't bad to look at. plus have you seen his fighting skills? Id like to tackle in between the sheets if you know what I mean." he winks at the other guard.
"Good, So I wanted to talk to you guys about something" uh oh. I feel like I know what he is going to say
I peek inside the room and I hear the shower turn off. I'll be in and out. He doesn't have to know I was here.
I wake up and look at the grand clock in the corner of the room and it reads "9:00" which is usually the time I get up. I swing my legs over the bed and make my way to the bathroom. to freshen up
A couple hours later I finally feel ready to come out of my room just because I had convinced myself that food was the best way to make myself feel at least a little better.
"Hello sir I'm not sure if you know me my name is Samandrial, I have a letter for you from the king of Hell John Winchester." Samandrial said.
"Uh, yeah" he turns off the light and climbs into the other side of the bed and faces away from me. I lay down and blow out the candle that is on my bed side table and I close my eyes  into a dreamless sleep.
"Dean! It's me open up" I hear my brother and I'm relieved that it's not my father. I stand up and wobble a little, due to a head rush. I open the door to see sam. He is holding a glass of water and some pain killers. It kinda creeps me out how he always knows that I'm hungover.
By the end of the day with the help of my brother, I am finished packing. I looked around the room ,the room was empty aside from the boxes filled with my books and my suit case filled with clothes and my necessities. As I looked around I felt the tears threaten to fall. I ask Gabe to leave so I can be alone. He nods his head and leaves
"Oh, ok. See ya ." Then he left. I let out a breath that I didn't know I was holding in.  I hear another knock on the door
"Yeah but Cas and I aren't ready for that" All I could do is nod along with dean. I don't really know what to say at this point in time.
I was sitting in my throne room reading over the war stats when all of a sudden the doors flew open revealing a small blonde hair blues eyes angel .
" You call this small? Dean you have blood all over your hands and you face is bruised. You also have somebody else's blood on your jacket" he says while gesturing to me and the jacket
"Ready as I'll ever be, I guess." I say before taking a deep breath and opening the door to the chapel.
"Well ,Cassie the kids these days call it 'the morning after pill' it took me a second to understand what he was saying until I finally understood what he was talking about
"Hey, I don't mean no harm. I'm just saying from personal experience. Virgin angels are delicious and loud. I remember one time I-" I punch him in the face before he can say anything else. I may dislike angels but I would never stand for anyone who talked like this.
"I'm a adult dad. I don't have to go to your stupid lunch if I don't want too." He steps forward and looks me in the eye
"No, I think that you would be a great parent. I think that we don't know a lot about the Winchester's and how they are as a family.I just want to make sure that not only you are ready to have a child but dean is also." he says while putting a reassuring hand on my shoulder.
"I do. But you don't have to do this just because of what I did for you" I shut him up with a kiss. I reach for the bottom of my shirt to tug it off and throw it in the floor.
"then you are going to go to heaven and deliver this letter to King chuck and when you do you will report back to me and tell me that you had done what I asked, then you may go free.”
In this chapter there is mention of Rape/torture. Please don't read if easily triggered. I will mark the beginning and end of the chat with *
"Ok, first Dean I do NOT have to explain myself to you, and second you already know why. This war has gone on long enough and we are losing resources and a lot of people over this pointless war" I said in a serious tone.
"It's Sam" He gives dean a bitch face and sits down next to his father. Just as sam sits down the butlers bring in our food.
In demon law there is a rule "He who crosses must pay if chosen to" which basically mean if you try a hurt what's mine then I hurt you back harder. In this case Cas is my spouse in the eyes of the law he is mine and alistair tried to take him in the most violating way so I take what's his: his life. In hell people who are born demons mate for life. By mate I don't mean bite on the neck, I mean marriage and inside marking (sex without condoms). Now cas and I haven't done the sex part but we are still married.
Y’all… I have a newfound respect for people who write smut cuz it’s pretty hard. Like the reason it took me this long to write this was because I was procrastinating. But alas I know people enjoy so here ya go. Have a nice day my lovelies
"Ahhhh, and your going to meeting with the king of those fluffy winged dick heads because....?" he said in a snarky tone.
"I'm sorry dean but Sam isn't joking.Sam please leave so I can talk to your brother." My dad said on a sad/ serious tone. As sam was leaving the room he smiled sadly at me while patting me on my back. I started to get a little anxious for what's to come.
Sorry this took a while I had writers block. But I’m happy with the outcome I just wish it hadn’t taken so long. I hope you enjoy if there are any errors pls tell me. Thanks for reading😊❤️
"Thanks I mean, you picked out the suit. You seem to like to have a lot of control over my life" I say with snark
Gabriel chuckles "oh my sweet baby bro, of course, you can get pregos, your grace takes care of the baby" Hurt starts to wash over me "I don't understand do you think I wouldn't be a good parent?" I ask with a frown on my face.
"Let's just say that's not an option" he says in a low voice. Just as I am about to ask him what that means I hear the doors open.
I walk into my bedroom and see cas there reading a book. God does he ever put a book down and look around, like how interesting could those things be.
"Relax it's not like they do anything. we hear that dean is still a total slut. and that castiel is a total prude. Some demons even got a pool going on to see when they will finally do the deed. I bet in about a month" Gerald said
"Well, um before I tell you I just want you to know that I love you and I'm doing this for our family and kingdom and if there was any other option than I would do that option."
"the ones that went missing were guarding lucifer's cage and they were their the day before we put him back. coincidence?"
" Yeah but Sam is very tall and I hear they base size off of height if you know what I mean" Yeah I've heard enough. I clear my throat and both of the guards look at me in shock and embarrassment.
"I'm not going to say sorry for something that I'm not sorry for. Like I said last night castiel I have needs, you won't satisfy my needs so I went elsewhere" He shrugs and sits on the bed to the  cuffs on his shirt.
"I can't believe you would this to him, I know you and dean had your disagreements but I didn't you hated him that much"
"Why do you give a fuck about who I sleep with, Cas ? I have needs, Cas and you won't give them to me." He scoffs and start walking towards me.
"Okay. Tell him I'm coming. Just let me go bring this to cas" I point at the book in my hand. He bows  his head and walks out of the room. I get up and start walking to cas and I's bedroom. When I open the door to our room I'm greeted by the sight of Cas sitting next to the fireplace. At this angle his face has a healthy glow despite the fact that he is always in doors. He looks up at me with his vibrant blue eyes. still blue, still Castiel.
"Wow. How many people are complete bastard while there living? 50,000 souls come here per week? What the hell how hard is it to be a decent person." he looks at me a nervously smiles "No offense" he hands me back the paper
"I..uh don't have either."I say in a low voice. Gabriel was about to say something else, but his father gave him a warning look and he shut his mouth.
"Hey." I let him know that it's just me. He doesn't answer but he relaxes into my arms. "Sam told me what happened." I tell him hoping he will talk back to me, so I can know that he is at least listening to me. "Do you wanna talk about it?" I see him shake his head.
"I don't need to. I shoot you with this, you're done for. Now for the last time. Get lost."  I see alastair leave the green house. After a couple seconds to make sure he is gone Sam lowers his gun and puts it back in his coat pocket and run to me
"Okay. the angel. As I was saying dad told me to tell you that the Shurley family are coming to stay with us next week so we can get to know them before you and the angel get ya know, hitched."
"Yeah, yeah of course. Speaking of which I see him over there" he points to a standing table .i see my father talking  to a couple people. He looks over to me and excuses himself before walking towards us.
" I wanted to talk to you about last night." he says still standing behind me. very closely I might add.
"I got the book you asked for. You know you are a real chick" He takes the book and playfully swats my arm with it.
Hi it's me the author. I just wanted to let you know that there is attempted rape in this chapter. I know some people are triggered by it so I will mark it with a #. Please don't read if triggered easily you don't have to read it to understand the story fully. Most of the chapter will be in Dean's POV.  Oh there is also some violence I will mark the spot with a # when it start, Pls don't read if easily triggered this is a heavy chapt. Thanks for reading :)
"the guards came looking for you. they didn't say that you had a meeting. I just had a hunch" he pokes me in the chest "You just confirmed that hunch" I stand up and walk towards him
After I leave Dean's office I go to the garden to do some work. I decided to plant some orchids and roses. Roses were my mom favorite flower on her birthdays or anniversaries my dad would always get her roses.
Woah. that was intense. I have never been kissed like that. I get off of deans lap and I stand up and walk over to the wardrobe to change. I turn around and take off my shirt and grab a new one. I hear dean get up and walk over to the bathroom to go brush his teeth.
"We need to talk about heirs" And I was right. I look over at dean and I see his mouth open and his cheeks are red.
'Am I ready for the next step' I want dean and I know he wants me judging by  how hard he gets when we makeout. I know what I want and it's him all of him. I roll over to deans side of the bed and move to straddle his hips. He groans in his sleep then he opens his eyes looking at me with a sleepy confused face.
"How do you think I am, Sam, Huh? I'm getting married to a stuck up angel. Oh and not just any angel. a prince of heaven"
"I'm still pissed at you for cheating, but I will get over it eventually. I know that you think I'm being unreasonable but in heaven marriage is a very serious thing that we don't take lightly arranged or not. And adultery isn't tolerated. I ask that you respect that at least. or if you do sleep with other people. try and hide it better than you did  last night" I look at him in the eye and he nods.
"Oh god no, he goes way down into the pit. We just have him up here for maintenance. you know just to make sure everything is working correctly and to clean the cage"
"great, I'm a full grown adult who still gets bossed around by his father." I mutter before making my way to the bathroom to get ready.
I was in my throne room and may I say that I was bored out of my mind. When all of a sudden I heard a flutter of wings and I jumped in my seat.
"Oh for fucks sake His name is castiel" Belphegor yelled. Lucifer looks stunned for a second then he full on smiled.
"I want you for you, Dean. Now shut up and kiss me"  he surges up and kisses me. I grab the hem of his shirt and tug it off. I run my hands up and down his toned chest and I pinch his nipples and he moans into my mouth and reaches a hand down into my pants and starts to stroke my cock. I throw my head back exposing my neck to dean.
"I understand. I said the same thing to Castiel. All he does is study his ass off every day preparing for his time on the throne ,but what choice do we have if we don"t do this ,then there will be no kingdom for him to rule."I said
"I just wanna go to sleep" He says quietly. I can hear the pain in his voice. I wish he would talk to me so I could help.
"Woah, woah, dean-o beano it's just me." I turn on the light and Gabriel was standing there with MY secret batch of cookies.
"What he did to cas took a toll on his mental health. He is living in fear whenever I'm not there. He tries to put on a brave face but I know he is suffering. I'm doing this for cas."  I shrug his hand off my shoulder.
"No time for  chit chat you are about to be put back in the hole were nobody can reach you. What did your brother say about your proposition?"
"Of course ,brotha" Benny says . We talk and order some food and drinks. Of course I don't order and alcohol because I have dinner with some important people.
"What the hell are you doing?" I yell. He starts walking towards me and he puts his hand over my mouth
"Listen cas i'm not gonna lie and say this will be easy and that everything will turn out perfect, but I will say that everything you go through I will be there right beside you. because like it or not we are married and from the moment we said " I do" your shit became my shit. Whether it was our choice or not" I bring my head up and look into his eyes and he looks into mine. I see his eyes briefly glance at my lips. I subconsciously lick my lips and he grabs the side of my face with both hands and closes the space between us and I feel his soft lips on mine
"Too many" he sighs and gets up and walks over to the mini bar and takes out 2 glasses and pours liquor in them. He walks back over to me and hands me a glass
"Ahh so your dean's pretty angel" He smiles and squeezes my hand tighter. I let out a nervous chuckle
After Cas leaves I feel more at ease. Me and Cas have come to a understanding and I call that progress.
"You heard me, you talk about two people in a relationship when you have put no effort into this relationship. And me sleeping with her I say that I got more then you could ever give. I say with a smirk.
"Castiel, me and John have found a way to stop this war by con-joining the kingdoms,but to do that I have to marry you off to the Prince of Hell,Dean Winchester."
"Is that a threat? Because one thing you should about me is that I don't respond well to threats ." I look down on him and wait for a answer. He straightens up and looks me in the eyes
