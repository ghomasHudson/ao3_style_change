Dean made it all the way to the car without bothering to stop and ask himself where he was planning to go. He wrenched the door open, threw himself into the driver's seat, and slammed the door behind him.
“Yes. I read about it in one of the Men of Letters spellbooks.”
When they’d listened to the entirety of In Through the Out Door twice over, he slapped a hand at the stereo, turning the radio on instead. He wasn’t sure what he had been expecting, but he was disappointed regardless at the watered-down, sugary pop song currently playing on whatever station Sam had had it set to. He went to change the station, but was stopped by Cas’ hand unexpectedly on his.
He would do the same, if he were Cas.
Castiel didn’t respond, only looked at him as if he wasn’t fully seeing him, and Dean noticed for the first time that the collar of his trenchcoat was stained with blood, and the angel looked troubled and exhausted.
“Can’t stand what, Dean?” Cas finally succeeded in piling Dean into the backseat of the Impala, and now he stood in front of the door with the sunset turning the sky the color of fire behind him.
“When you’re not here,” Dean said.
“Ugh.” Dean visually searched the interior of the Impala, coming up empty. No green clothing, nothing green on the dashboard. “Dude.” His eyes lit on another vehicle. “Is it that minivan? It’d better not be, that’s teal. And also ugly as hell.”
“I think I’ll go seek revelation. We might have some further orders.” At that, Uriel turned on his heel and disappeared in a whirlwind of feathers.
Dean groaned. “Those other trees? Look, if it’s a tree, I’m guessing it.”
Still watching him, Cas mused, “You know, as an angel, I didn’t think I was capable of feeling love, or emotions in general, but I do. I think I always did. It was something they tried to take from me, I think. But I feel it.”
Cas guided Dean onto the bed and then stopped and just
He left without looking back and waited in the car, the key already in the ignition. A minute later, Cas got in, looking confused and hurt.
Watching him, Castiel’s chest ached like he had been stabbed. He knew, somehow, what he should say – what he had to say – to convince Dean. But he couldn’t seem to find the conviction in their truth. He thought again of the box he carried his doubts in, battered and unsound. He needed to close it. He didn’t believe in this order, it was true, but he shouldn’t need to believe in it to carry it out. He shouldn’t
Dean continued to snort-laugh, wiping tears from his eyes. “Nothing, nothing,” he chortled, shaking his head.
“I’m not drinking that. I want a sandwich.”
Castiel hesitated, picking up his burger and setting it back down twice before wiping his hands on his pants. “I hate Pontiac.”
have the juice to possess someone else days later. It didn’t make sense.
“Can’t remember the last time he looked that upset, ‘cept maybe when he and Lisa broke up.” Bobby looked down at him, suspicion high in his eyes.
“Hey, are you still going out tonight with that guy you’ve been talking to?”
Dean looked up when he heard footsteps enter the main living room, needing a couple tries to get the blankets out of his face so he could see. His arm, holding the half-empty ice cream container, appeared from the depths of the burrito, offering his treat to Castiel. Plopping down next to Dean, Castiel took the ice cream and the spoon, sitting a safe distance away from Dean on the couch.
“Then don’t leave me behind.”
Dean rolled his eyes good-naturedly. “Gimme a break, I was busy.”
“Th—that’s not what I’m saying, I just think you lay it on a bit thick.”
“So, as long as we’re communicating and everything… you don’t want me gone?”
“Oh my god!” Dean doubled over, letting the flashlight beam bounce. “He’s probably at home, drunk by now, isn’t he? He’s not even conscious! Oh man, does the school know about that, or are they just ignoring it?” Even through his acute sympathy, Dean couldn’t help laugh about it at the dude’s expense.
“So, you think I should what… drop out?”
“Gotta keep you safe, sweetheart. After you sign this… you are my property,” Dean looked up at him from under his lashes, smirking. “Sort of, anyway.” He chuckled like he was making a joke to himself.
Aiming for Cas’s apartment, the ride was silent. The town wasn’t very big, so there wasn’t much ground to cover, but this silence was brutal. Dean could feel the waves of anger and frustration coming off of Cas from a foot away.
Dean rolled his eyes. He used to do worse than bully kids like this in high school.
“Mm—Dean?” Cas blinked a few times, adjusting to the morning light. He winced as he likely felt all the places he was being held together by thread and plaster.
“You know that’s not it, Cas—“
The metal ladder Oswald had propped up against the catwalk was still there. They were lucky it hadn’t toppled to the ground amidst all the chaos. Dean got Cas positioned enough to start climbing down, even though Dean was pretty sure Cas’s leg was broken or near-broken. He’d have to rely on sliding down once he got close enough to the ground.
It wouldn’t hurt to move things along in the case, not really. Dean’s father would insist that they hit the road all the sooner to get to the next job, the next city, the next atrocity. His insides writhed at the thought of having to leave Central City and Castiel behind, but Dean knew it was for the best. “Might as well. Gotta tie up the loose ends, right?”
that made him twitch violently. “D-do it again—“ Cas managed to get out. Dean snarled and rubbed triple-time over that same spot, working through the hand cramp. His erection was so hard, it was painful. His boxers were barely on, but they stretched obscenely. Cas was so tense beneath him, head tossed back, sweating, and making this amazing
“Yeah, there’s more work here in the midwest than in big cities, though.” It was true; Dean saw a lot more of the Great Plains than either of the coasts. He couldn’t even remember the last time he’d seen the ocean. He hated the mountains the worst. A million places to hide, and it was usually cold.
Dean ran his hand through his hair, ruffling it. “You have to know, I’m not mad at you for wanting to quit before we got to the main event. Okay?” He turned back and walked over to the couch, sitting close to Castiel. “I mean it. I’m not mad about that. But I need to be able to trust you to safeword if it gets to be too much. Otherwise, I’m gonna be in constant fear that I’m overwhelming you and that… don’t make me do that, Cas.” His eyes were pleading with Castiel to understand.
“This must be where all the cool kids drink.” Dean gestured around to the dozens of older men crowded around tables and the wide oak bar at the front. Like thousands of others bars, The Independent Club had that unique smell of spilled beer and stale sweat practically pounded into the wooden planks that made up the floor and walls. Also like thousands of other bars, it had the same kind of clientele. Over 50, graying hair and beard, potbellies hanging over large belt buckles. Perfect for catching a game of pool or cards.
“Not if I’m being honest, no.” Castiel gripped Dean’s hand a bit tighter.
“I’m not laughing.”
Cas let his tongue trail Dean’s cock and lavished the head with attention. He kept a hand at the base of his cock to fist whatever wouldn’t fit in his mouth. He went straight down again and hollowed out his cheeks as he sucked, resulting in a drawn-out breathy moan and a string of profanity from Dean. He pulled off with a pop and slicked his hand up and down Dean’s shaft.
Sam let a teasing smile play across his face. “Come on Dean. What kind of sugar daddy are you? Can’t let your sugar baby walk into the first day without an apple for the teacher.”
Cas stood above him, with strict orders to
“Don’t you think if he was going to serial kill you, he’d have done it by now? He’s got a lotta ground to cover. This is LA. He’s gotta move quick if he wants to make even the slightest impression on the LAPD.” Dean nodded towards the fridge where their salad sat. Cas had insisted on a salad to go with the carbo-load that was Dean’s favorite and famous Spaghetti Night. It was a rare thing for Dean to allow so much green at a meal, but Cas was always somehow able to convince him.
“Let’s start with your hips, Dean. What people refer to as your hipbone, is called the iliac crest, and yours is particularly nice,” Cas latched his mouth onto Dean’s naked hipbone and sucked hard, so that when he pulled away, there was a nice bruise already forming. Dean moaned, desperate for more. “It’s very strong and the muscle around it is very impressive.”
The way Mr. Winchester threw his keys in a small table in the foyer and toed off his shoes made this impressively ornate house seem much more livable, like this wasn’t for show; this really was the place Mr. Winchester came home to every night and sprawled out on the couch to relax. Maybe he even wandered around in his boxers in the morning, scrubbing the sleep out of his eyes. Castiel got caught up gawking at the Matisse on the wall that couldn't be real, for god’s sake, before remembering himself and hustling into the living room just off the foyer.
“She is like family. Pretty damn close anyway. She and my mom were really close before she died.” Dean didn't look at Castiel, but a muscle jumped minutely in his jaw.
“Cas, I’m serious. You
“He works in a bookstore, for your information.” Dean still sounded snippy. Sam figured he better tone it down if he wanted any juicy details. The contract hadn’t actually been all that telling of the dynamic of their relationship. All Sam knew was that Dean had a guy tucked away somewhere that he (apparently regularly) showered with gifts, in exchange for blow jobs. “What are we thinking for tonight? The Camaro or the Impala?”
Castiel threw one last smile, hopefully apologetic, towards Randy before he followed Anna out to the car, handing her the Vanilla Coke.
“We’ve got too much pasta around here anyway for just us.”
Castiel blinked about a dozen times and once more for good measure and shrugged. The man sighed and trudged out of the bathroom, a heavy set to his shoulders. Castiel scrambled off the counter and adjusted his clothing. He swung around to face the mirror, and scrubbed his hands through his hair. He pulled out his phone and dialed the number he had memorized, simply by staring at the page on which the number was written all damn day.
But it sorta did? He was used to things not working out for him, romantically or otherwise. He’d meet someone, have fun for a while, but one of them would come to their senses and realize it wasn’t going to work out and hit the road… usually him. It wasn’t often he was hung up on a person like this. And he’d never been so hung up on another man. He was out of his element here, and it stung to know that he’d fucked this up like he does every other relationship he’s come across.
“I’d ask which mantle, because you have like, three.”
“Castiel.”
“Dunno,” he said. “James woulda worked fine, I guess. You look like the kinda guy that has a unique name though, you know? Not like Jeff, or Mark… something cool. Not to pressure you, or anything. If you don’t wanna give me your name… s’cool.” Mr. Winchester started humming off-key to the song on the radio. Castiel wasn’t sure he recognized this one, but he did recognize that Mr. Winchester couldn’t carry a tune to save his life. It was endearing, in a way. This attractive man, who was down-to-earth despite being as rich as he claimed, singing badly was tugging on Castiel’s heartstrings in a way he’d been trying to forget was possible in his current situation.
“I know you don’t. That’s why I’m ready.”
When he does make it out of the cavernous place he calls home, he drives. Even though the traffic is as terrible as it ever is, he drives through the streets, barely knowing where he is. He keeps just enough of his head to avoid hitting anything or anyone, but he just goes. Sometimes he’ll walk around parts of the city he never got the chance to see. He spends a lot of time at the Pier now, smiling politely at the families crowded around a camera, and generally avoiding all puddles of melted ice cream along the way. He likes the view of the water, of the boats, of the view of his own house from afar. It’s nice seeing the place like everyone else sees it; an enigma across the lake, shrouded by trees and privacy. He always keeps watch for someone familiar with dark hair and a wry smile, but he never sees anyone worth noticing. He wonders if there’s anyone like that in the city anymore, or if they’ve cleared out by now.
“Do what.” Dean drummed his fingers on the glass counter. There were very few people under the age of 65 eating here at this time. Dean supposed more of the younger crowd hit up the Dairy Queen or the Subway he saw on the way into town.
“Then why are you here? If you care so much, you’d let him move on, Winchester.”
Cas waved cheerfully. “Just checking in on Kevin. Nice to see you, Melody.” He stopped at Melody’s desk, placing his elbows on the countertop. Dean stepped up awkwardly behind him, not sure where to look or what to do with his hands. He was usually the one with the plan to get past security. It didn’t look like they’d need to, here.
“Dean.” He sounded flat and emotionless to his own ears.
“Miss, you work for Mr. Winchester, don’t you?" Vivienne started, thrusting a microphone in her face.
Dean’s lips were sweet and hot against his, and Castiel pressed himself closer, aching to be melded to the man above him. Dean must have felt the same pull, because he couldn’t seem to keep his hands in one place. He swept them all over Castiel’s body, from shoulder to hip, leaving what Castiel thought must have been scorch marks with the heat and tingles his hands left. “Missed you. Missed this.” Dean whispered against his lips, when they were free. “Missed you so much, goddamn Cas.” Castiel nibbled on Dean’s lower lip, really sinking his teeth in when Dean shoved his warm cock against his own. Dean gasped, all the air in his lungs leaving his body and filling up Castiel’s with so much light, he thought he might burst.
Cas shook his head. “No, I’ll go with you. I want to help.”
“Can a hat hold DNA?” Cas asked, looking up at the far wall. “Kevin mentioned Oswald was wearing a bowler hat.
“No, no! I—just...” he whipped his head around and shrugged. “Just never tried it before. ‘As all.”
Balthazar had set the paper down. “Well, I… certainly hope you can meet the two week deadline, Mr. Novak. We wouldn’t want to bar you from entering this institution.”
“Did time there, sure. But… no place like home.” Dean finished with a tight smile.
That made Dean stop finally. He glanced back, pain clear in his eyes. “About what?”
Dean rolled his eyes and smacked Cas on the ass. “Been wanting to do that since I met you, dummy. I’m glad we had this chance to finally straighten out that I’m the only one for you.”
He swung around again. “Aren’t theaters supposed to have like… a ghost light or something? That’s a thing, isn’t it?”
“He asked me out to dinner.”
Castiel couldn’t believe this. Just. Could
Unwilling to face an interaction with innocent passerby two times in one night, Cas had pleaded to let the issue rest until the next night. Dean had acquiesced, more interested in the beer Cas offered him before heading back to the hotel for the night. Today though, after another today of school, after pretending to mop while Cas had his “meeting” with Adler, they were back to the ghost-hunting gig and out here doing what Dean did best. The EMF reader had come out again, and they had followed its shrill sound to the middle of the football field, because
“Dean, I really need you to fuck me.”
“Are you worried you’re going to hurt me?”
Castiel liked Sr. Guerrero enough, that he sometimes stopped in to say hello, even when he wasn’t working, such as now, while Dean was at a meeting with his design team. He had told Castiel that morning that the meeting shouldn’t be more than a few hours, that he planned on telling the design team to just go with blue and stop the all-out feud that was tearing their department apart. That had been at nine this morning, and this was now three in the afternoon. Castiel imagined that there would be a story about a hilariously dysfunctional work team when he saw Dean again.
Dean tried to warn him. “That’s not—“
“Yeah.” Dean got up and turned towards the bookcase, picking up titles and setting them down. “And you date.” He said without turning around. He doesn’t sound angry or upset. He’s just stating a fact.
It took a few seconds for Dean to find his voice. “Do you really want me to order you around?”
Castiel wasn’t sure he’d ever had this much room to himself in his entire life. He walked further into the room and joined Dean at the window.
Castiel was on the verge of losing his mind. He was sure he must sound positively stupid with the breathy sounds that were leaving his mouth. Dean seemed eager to catch them all though, he didn't stop staring at Castiel at all. Castiel had to close his eyes to keep it together, to keep from losing his mind entirely, but Dean kept his gaze trained on Castiel’s face. Their faces were close enough to kiss each other, but Dean did not. Castiel wanted the heat on his face and lips like the heat from Dean’s mouth this morning, when he kissed him before he left for work. It seemed like Dean wanted to kiss him, but he was restraining himself, almost as if he was waiting for—
He turned up the charm. “I know it’s short notice, but we were wondering if the owner was available?”
You're almost there! If you've made it this far, be prepared for a last chapter full of fluff, smut, and (probably) some kissing. Who knows.
Sighing, Castiel drew his arms into his sides, shuffling in the opposite direction of the man. Just because he sucked dick for rent money didn’t mean he couldn’t be selective when he wanted to be.
She turned to him. “Same old, same old, I guess. A little birdie told me you went and got yourself promoted.”
An hour in, Dean really had no idea what was happening in this show. The kids weren’t very animated on their lines, and had a tendency to stand completely still when they weren’t actively talking, so Dean’s grip on the story and conflict was tenuous at best. The parents on either side of him seemed to be about as engaged as he was, though. One father had be prodded awake every so often by his grumpy looking wife, and by the expression of the other couple, they were regretting allowing their child to be part of this production. He couldn’t say he was paying the best attention to the show, though. He kept his eyes out for Cas, scanned the audience and the wings, but it was too dark to see much. He tried to remember where Cas said he’d be standing, but that was a while ago, before their fight. It hadn’t seemed important at the time.
He stood up, looking around. Running a hand through his hair—longer now than it had been in a  while—he sighed. He’d just had it in his hand. And the nearest art supply store was at least an hour away in Lawrence. Damn.
“I’ll tell him that.”
Dean’s face lit up. “That’s your work on that building downtown. With the swirls and the—the… that blue you like. You got like a huge tube of it at that art store.”
A smile stole across Dean’s handsome face. “Likewise, Anna. I’m still terrified of you, but… I can see why Cas likes you.”
The bedroom door slammed in the same second that Castiel’s back hit the mattress, and he felt himself sink into the memory foam like an old friend. Dean followed soon after, caging him in. They were pressed together as much as they could, Dean’s hands going to his face and stroking across his cheekbones.
Castiel’s face brightened, bringing about ten shades of light into his already luminous eyes. He gathered the slew of papers across the Impala’s hood and hopped in the passenger seat. Dean swore silently to himself, before getting in the driver’s seat.
Dean rolled his eyes, pushing himself onto his back. “I didn’t know it was such a priority.” He glanced over at Castiel.
Oswald shrugged. “This body isn’t really built for destroying a theater properly, so it got a bit damaged. It won’t make much of a difference though in the end.”
“It’s completely within the parameters of what you agreed to. And don’t worry, I had Sam look over all the details of the contract. He laughed at me for about ten minutes… but it’s all good.” Dean looked at him earnestly, excitement obvious in his green eyes. Castiel trusted him, no doubt about it, but he could feel the anticipation building into a ball of nervous energy in his stomach.
“I know. Tell me the bonessssss.” Dean wiggled his fingers and drew out the words like a stuffy old lady. Cas laughed, despite himself.
“Where did you go? You were going to that bar down South, did you meet up with that guy from the site?”
“Well, I’m sorry you drove all this way, but I’ve moved past it.” Dean looked up, his expression clearly wounded. Castiel was lying through his teeth, and he knew it, but he couldn’t let himself be weak to this man again.
Castiel backed up a step, keeping his eyes carefully away from Dean. He wondered if Ms. Williams was watching from her window the strange scene unfolding below. She’d probably corner him by the mailboxes tomorrow to ask for details about the strange man in the black car.  “Come upstairs.”
Castiel leaned back on his heels when he was upright again. “Have you seen Dean?” The words came out in a rush, bordering on unintelligible with their urgency.
Nodding vigorously, Cas unlatched himself and threw back the last of his beer. They scrambled out of the booth and pushed each other out the door, running into a scandalized man with a fedora at least old enough to be Dean’s grandfather. Dean took Cas’s hand, steadily ignoring the fact that he hadn’t held another man’s hand in his life, maybe ever. He tugged Cas out of the bar, around the corner of the building, and practically dragged him to the dark corner he had left the Impala in. He pressed Castiel up against the side door, pushing in close between his feet. Every direction he could possibly go, there was Cas. Pulling away to breathe, only to get dragged back in by his shirt. Pushing forward to get another hit off of whatever cologne Cas had clinging to his neck, to get tugged gently back up to his lips. Dean didn’t know where to put his hands to get the most access. He couldn’t get close enough, and yet he was wrapped all around the man in front of him. Dean felt like a live wire was zipping through his veins, and yet there was no brain activity to tell him to slow down or take it easy.
Missouri looked up and smiled. “I’d be willing to bet. It’s down the hall and down a flight on stairs on the left. You can always tell what kind of mood he’s in by what volume the music’s at. The more likely you are to lose an eardrum, the better he feels.” She walked into the bathroom to change towels and breezed out the door again.
This was humiliating. Everyone probably knew that he was waiting on a blind date, one that was clearly very late. He glanced over at the stranger in the leather jacket again. He was supposed to be here for Balthazar… but Balthazar wasn’t here yet.
Castiel spoke, “Don’t worry about me right now. I’m a nobody, compared to you. They won’t care about me at all, other than the fact that you paid me.”
Castiel let himself collapse on the couch. “You can sit.” He indicated the other side to Dean, who gingerly took a seat as well, as if unsure of his welcome.
Castiel jerked involuntarily and Dean whispered soothingly to him. With the light blocked out, Castiel could already feel his other senses heighten immeasurably. His skin seemed to buzz and his ears picked up the minute sounds of Dean’s quiet breathing.
Cas met his eyes, something cautiously hopeful there. “Dean, are you asking?”
“Hey Cas… w-what are you doing?”
“This is like that one time you tried to tell me that that one Zeppelin song sounded ‘aubergine’… it’s just colors to me.” Dean chuckled and pressed a kiss to Castiel’s temple. He walked back over to his work bench. “Navy sounds good, though.”
Dean didn’t have time to grace Castiel with a witty retort of what else was thick. The hostess returned with a balding man in his early sixties at least. The man stuck out a wrinkled hand, dotted with liver spots, for Dean to meet. “Ron Kaiser, owner and manager. How are ya?”
“M’not upset. I just missed you.” Castiel tried to push forward again to get to Dean’s mouth, but Dean folded him into a hug instead, wrapping his big arms around Castiel’s frame. Despite not getting quite what he wanted, Castiel melted all the same into Dean, hands clutching so tight in Dean’s dress shirt, he was surely wrinkling it. Dean shushed him, like one might to a small child. Stupid, Castiel thought to himself.
Dean’s hand sped up again, leaning into Castiel as hard as Castiel was leaning back into him. Castiel was sure that they would topple over at any moment. His fingers scrabbled around Dean’s hairline, digging in at the sensations that were ripping up and down his spine. It always felt good with Dean. Always, always, always—
“I’m going to take a shower.” Cas pulled away suddenly, and Dean blinked back to the reality of lying under Castiel, both of them still naked and touching a million different places.
“This place is enormous.”
Andy snorted good-naturedly. “Naw, best steaks outside of Omaha, if you believe it. Used to be an old hotel, though. This town’s got enough history to be haunted, just on that restaurant, even without the help of the school.”
Cas stands there for a while and then says a very soft "hey" that makes Dean look behind him. "Morning, sunshine", he says, unapologetically unironic, and carries on making the pancakes. Cas walks towards him, hugs him from behind and Dean leans into it so unsubtly he is now diagonal instead of vertical. Screw subtlety or restraint, he's wanted this for years. He turns his head back and they kiss for a while, smiling the whole time, and only stop when the smell of burnt batter reaches them. They detach from each other so Dean can throw the ruined pancake away and start making another one, saying "you need to stop, look, you made me burn a pancake. Your fault". But as soon as another one's on the pan Cas has his arms around Dean's waist again and his chin in the crook of Dean's shoulder, and Dean's not standing as diagonally as before but he's close. They stand there like that for some time, gently swaying side to side in silence. Dean may or may not have turned the heat down on the stove so it would take longer until he had to move.
"Yeah why wouldn't I be. It's Cas."
Cas runs his fingers through Dean's hair very softly with his calloused hands as Dean is waking up.
long time, and I'm really happy for you guys." He breaks eye contact with Dean to smile at Cas, who smiles back at Sam and nods. He gets up from the table and they all hug, and Dean is so relieved he leans back against the counter for support. He doesn't want to care about what anyone else thinks, he's just so happy he and Cas can finally be together, but at the same time...it's Sammy. He takes a deep breath. Cas puts an arm around him, kisses his shoulder and rubs Dean's back for a brief moment, as if to say "told you it'd be fine". They suddenly notice the smell of burnt pancakes in the air. They all laugh at that and it sounds like a laugh of someone who's getting teary eyed but trying to hide it. All three of them.
Dean felt his jaw tighten. It hung awkwardly in the air between them for a tense moment before he reached out to take it. Cas’ fingers on the handle brushed his in the exchange, impossible for Dean to avoid, and the contact made him jerk, sloshing coffee up the sides of the pot. He turned ungraciously on his heel to grab a mug without thanking him.
At any other time, in any other circumstances, Dean would. In a heartbeat. And for a moment, he considers it. But he only has to imagine it in his mind for a split second before realizing that it’s not what he wants right now. He’s interested in wallowing in his self-pity, not trying to hook up.
He spied a potential weapon – a heavy-looking ceramic picture frame behind the shifter that must have fallen off of the bookshelf. How to get to it without the shifter noticing?
“Do you give up?” Cas asked soberly.
When Sam only rolled his eyes, Cas mutely held it out to him instead, offering it like a sacrificial lamb.
He wouldn’t end up kneeling on the ground with a mouth full of blood again, incapable of doing anything besides –
Dean reached across the table without thinking, drawn by the movement, to touch his hand, tracing the blue map of veins that showed under the thin skin on the back. He focused on the sensation of Cas’ skin under his fingertips, and when the buzzing noise in his brain had sufficiently subsided, he took a deep breath and said, “I love you.”
His eyes were very blue over their clasped hands, lit with a smile Dean felt against his own skin. “Let’s go home.”
He was sweating through his shirt, cold and clammy but overheating at the same time, hearing the shifter saying those words again and again:
The name awakened a previously repressed knot of dread in the pit of Dean’s stomach. “She did the spell. She rose the witnesses.”
He’d told Sam that he and Cas were dating. But to everyone else – including Cas, and including Dean himself, they were “friends with benefits.”
"He's going to another country," Dean admits into the midst of it. "France." He laughs. "Who even wants to go to fucking France?" He’s wondering at this point if Benny’s regretting his decision to talk to him yet, but he seems to be persevering, which Dean appreciates.
He had the strangest sensation that going back to the motel room would dissipate whatever mysterious force was allowing him to tolerate being confronted with so many emotions all at once, however, and there was one other thing Dean still wanted to know before this bizarre day was over.
“Nothing,” Sam said, too quickly.
Sam grudgingly said goodbye. Dean hung up. He took in another lungful of cold air, trying not to think about it, and went back to the room.
“We’re going to Kevin’s party. You want to come with?” Charlie sounds a little too cheerful. Garth nods along. “Games, snacks, alcohol,” he lists off.
Then he heaved himself out of bed.
Everything. Everything he’d said while he was borderline delirious and more. And he still did, even.
Dean heard the squeak of a chair as Sam sat down, as if settling in. “And how do you know?”
With that done, he surrendered himself, eyes closing, to the electric current flooding his body from Cas' current ministrations at his collarbone, only to register a noise of agreement followed by the pressure of Cas' mouth disappearing. He made an unhappy noise and blinked his eyes open to see Cas straightening up, shrugging his coat back over his shoulders from where Dean had haphazardly yanked it down, and then he was taking Dean by the hand to lead him away from the car. Dean trailed along behind him like a lost puppy, pliant and breathless.
Dean pulled back to look him in the face, his hands trailing down Cas’ arms to hold onto his wrists as if he might disappear. Before he could say anything, Cas had brought a hand up to touch Dean’s face. To rest his fingertips on Dean’s cheekbone, the pad of his thumb on the delicate skin under Dean’s eye. Dean leaned into the touch with a shuddering breath, and Cas’ fingertips drifted down to brush over his lower lip, tracing its outline. His eyes were dark, rapt, and Dean was holding his breath, unable to speak, as Cas leaned forward to replace the touch of his hand with his mouth.
“Can’t have any coffee.”
“Dean,” Cas said. He said it as if his name was a prayer rather than a greeting, breathing it out on a sigh.
Cas looked up. His hair was in his eyes, sweaty and going in several different directions on his head, and his blue eyes were clear and light. He had stubble on his cheeks, a dark contrast to his pale skin. Dean thought he was beautiful.
As predicted, Sam brings him up, ten minutes into the conversation.
“Dean?” Cas asked.
Dean saw Castiel’s face, impassive from high above him, bathed in light on one side but shadowed on the other. Blank, unrecognizing. He raised the blade. It glinted in his hand as if winking at Dean.
But Castiel had orders. He broke the eye contact first, and Dean looked away too, turning around to glare at Uriel. “I want to talk to Cas.” He paused. “Alone.”
"Sure," Dean agreed immediately. "Ice cream?"
He groans, peering at the separated, oily bits of expired milk now floating on the top of his coffee, and pours it down the sink. Just great. He goes to pour another mug of coffee before realizing, obviously, they still don’t have any milk of the non-chunky variety. He gives up, leaving everything right where it is, and considers simply going back to bed, perhaps trying again tomorrow.
“I know. The thing is, Cas, I looked up the spell and it’s not, like, a love spell or anything.” Dean felt his face grow warm and he surged ahead, talking faster. “It just made me – uh – unable to have inhibitions, apparently. I couldn’t stop myself from saying or…or doing anything. So I just wanted you to know, I guess, that I didn’t say anything I didn’t mean, I just didn’t, you know –
His face was a mask of stony anger, but it was rippled with fine cracks. Castiel saw through it as easily as if it were glass, observing the fear, guilt, and confusion boiling underneath, barely contained. His eyes narrowed.
He looks down to see a few empty beer bottles rolling away, having just knocked them over as he got out of bed. Apparently his drunk self had placed them next to his bed to make them as hard to avoid as possible? He isn’t sure. One of them had broken in half upon impact with his foot, taking its revenge in a shallow slice across the top of said foot.
When he leaves the dorm, he’s not sure where he’s headed, and for a moment, he turns in the direction of Cas’ dormitory, his feet itching to move him towards it, to close the distance between them. But then he turns away, and his feet carry him in a different direction instead, towards a destination that he’s not entirely surprised to find is the campus bar – the only place serving alcohol this time of night.
Unfortunately, the plan didn’t work out that way – the shifter was faster than him, catching his fist easily out of the air and using the momentum to pitch him forwards into the wall on the opposite side of the room. He hit with another bruising impact, his already injured side screaming. What the hell was taking Cas so long?
“Can you just come here? Just lie down next to me?”
“You’d better finish the soup in the fridge by the time we get back,” Dean warned him as he left.
“Yeah, yeah, okay.” Dean rolled his eyes. “So I take it you’re feeling alright?”
They’d both met Cas before. Several times, actually. Usually he came over when they weren’t home, just for the sake of privacy, but Cas had slept over more than once.
He felt like something inside him was finally coming loose – some knot of self-hatred and repression that he hadn’t been fully aware was present, but which he was now relieved to feel come undone.
Despite this, they nearly got lost trying to find the house. Nearly.
“Jump-started the apocalypse,” Dean finished. He couldn’t bear to look at him. He kept his eyes trained resolutely on the bloodstains on Cas’s coat.
The shapeshifter raised their – Castiel’s – arm over their head, and for the first time Dean noticed the long, wickedly sharp piece of glass in their hand – a shard from the broken coffee table.
He closed a book and picked up another. “Yes.”
“It’s your eyes,” he said, as casual as ever.
For that matter, he’s not sure why it even feels like a lie, when it’s really technically close enough to the truth to be functionally true. He figures that it’s more the fact that he knows Cas doesn’t consider their relationship to be anything more than that “friends with benefits.”
“Nothing.” Dean closed his eyes, feeling like he was reciting lines from a play. “We fought, and then Cas just snapped out of it.”
Sam sighed, exasperation and exhaustion fighting on his face. “Okay, whatever, man. Look, all I’m saying is, it’s Cas. Just talk to him. You two always work things out.”
? Either you're not as nice as you look, or he’s blind. Or stupid."
“Cas,” Dean breathed. He was distantly aware of the vampire taking off, taking his chance to escape.
He wasn’t sure what exactly it was that he wanted until Cas leaned in and kissed him, and he realized,
Dean looked skyward. Subtlety was not Cas’ strong suit.
Dean plunged ahead regardless. “In 1887, a Man of Letters performed an exorcism on your grandmother. Do you know how he did it?”
Over Sam’s weak noises of protest Dean said harshly, “Cas will go.”
After Cas had given him the next dose of the antidote – Dean had been too exhausted to complain this time – he’d insisted Cas get off the uncomfortable chair (Dean knew it was one of the shitty ones from the kitchen) and get in the bed. He had noticed, despite his hazy state, that Cas was starting to nod off every once in a while, his chin touching his chest and his eyes closing for a couple seconds at a time before he woke with a barely perceptible jerk.
After what seemed like forever, he knocked again, more impatiently. As soon as he did, he heard the slide of a deadbolt and the rattle of a chain, and then the door was opening a crack to reveal a woman’s pale, lined face, her eyebrows drawn together in a V of distrust.
Part of the deal Jack made to get Castiel out of the Empty was the condition that he become human, so his grace would dwindle a little bit everyday until he was fully human – it could take years, apparently. In the meantime, Sam and Dean were happy to try to prepare him for a lifetime of being human. For example: how to brush his teeth (toothpaste goes ON the toothbrush), how to cook (alternatively, how to order takeout), how to fall asleep (no, you don’t literally count sheep), the wonders of caffeine (and why it can totally replace sleep, according to Dean), and how to shower (well, Cas can figure that one out on his own).
He needed to know, needed to ask, and yet he found himself struggling with the words, as if some long-forgotten self-preservation instinct was belatedly kicking in. Finally he forced them out through numb lips, wincing at the pain in his throat. “Is it true?” Cas looked at him sharply, as if Dean’s voice had brought him out of his reverie. Dean swallowed hard and continued, “Did I break the first seal? Did I start all this?”
Still, when he finally managed to fall asleep, his dreams were a blur of images and feelings, confusing and disorienting; sunlight glinting on silver metal, dirty feathers, and Cas’ mouth.
Good evening folks! I hope you enjoy this update; it was a lot of fun to write. Leave a comment or kudos if you liked it, as I love/thrive on positive reinforcement!
Dean spends a lot of time alone these days.
Another pause. “Are you sure?”
Her grip was firm when she shook Castiel’s hand. “Anna said not to mention anything from the news, but I just want you to know that you shouldn’t take the media seriously. They twist anything out proportion.”
From there, it was quick work getting Castiel out of his pants and onto his front on the couch. Dean crouched behind him, one foot on the floor to balance himself, and the other tucked up underneath. He had produced lube from somewhere Castiel couldn't bring himself to care about and was now running his hands over Castiel’s ass. Even in his wildest masturbatory fantasies, he had never gotten so far as to stick a finger or anything up his own ass. Clients sometimes liked to offer to do it to him, but he had never taken them up on it.
“Paying his rent, paying his tuition, and anything else he might want?”
Charlie frowned, “In a manner of speaking, I guess—“
Anna had to give Castiel some credit, this man was handsome. Anna had flipped on a few lights when she came in, hoping against hope she wouldn’t see any naked male ass in her living room, especially her roommate’s, and she could see just how pretty Winchester’s face was. He was tall with broad shoulders, full lips and a strong nose, balanced with an even stronger jaw. And those eyes were
Judy the Librarian looked up again, scowl broadening the longer he talked. She sighed and put down her book. “We have a limited amount of microfilm available, but we’ll need to wheel out the machine for it and it’s in the basement right now. What are you looking for?”
“Yes, Balthazar,” Bela pursed her lips. “I’ll have his head someday too, if I can manage it. The fashion department at the Institute really started churning out some atrocities when he took over, didn’t he? Such a pity... a fine establishment.”
“I don’t think I’ve went off that fast in at least a decade. Maybe more.”
Decisions are made, and consequences are realized.
Dean could relate.
and Dean Winchester, billionaire entrepreneur and the All-American poster boy for Midwestern living, was on the ground.
Castiel huffed, “I don’t think you’re weird, it’s just—never mind.” He crossed his arms and looked away, smirking to himself.
“Gonna turn it on now, lemme know if you need me to stop.” Dean whispered into his ear, nipping at the lobe,
Mr. Winchester’s face breaks into that heart stopping smile again, before flagging down the waitress for the check.
“Are you going to bed?”
“You know, I grew up about an hour from here.” Dean finally turned around, hands in his pockets. He looked like he was trying to make himself smaller in the space around him.
Castiel turned away to face the window. “Can we go?”
Castiel thought his mouth was better suited for other things entirely.
Kevin waved politely and started clearing his homework away for his visitors. “My mom was here earlier today. You’re the first teacher that’s come to see me, though!” He said, cheerfully. “Marie from drama club came on Saturday though. She was… kinda broke up about it, actually.”
Dean pulled back, panting. “We should leave.” The blue in Castiel’s eyes was nearly swallowed by the black of his pupil. Dean could see his own reflection there, and he saw that he wasn’t much better off. “Right now.”
Dean could say no. He could laugh it off, and go back to his beer. Maybe even find a girl at the bar and part ways amicably with Cas here and take her back to the hotel. Fuck out his confusion in a way much safer to his relatively limited experience.
Dean rolled his eyes. “You know exactly what I mean, smartass. Don’t make me spell it out for you.”
Dean slammed the trunk and shouldered his duffel bag. “I’m gonna check in and get some sleep. Maybe start tomorrow morning.” Castiel hadn’t been too chatty on the way over here—all fifty feet of it—but Dean was starting to think he could stand to be away from the dude for a little while all the same. It was clear the guy was interested in what he did, but he really wasn’t in the mood to field questions. It could be tough for some guys after they find out all the things that go bump in the night were definitely real and wanted to hurt them more often than not.
Face hidden in Castiel’s neck, Dean’s voice was muffled. “Why does that turn me on when you say you’re gonna come all over my car?”
“Fuck, honey, just look at me.” Dean’s voice was husky and shaky. He was close, and he knew it. He needed to make Cas come first, though. He resumed his previous task of an inelegant handjob, but now that he had Cas’s attention, he pulled out all the stops, trying every trick he knew he liked when someone else was touching him. He tried to smirk down at Cas’s staggered expression, but he wasn’t sure his was any more put-together. Dean leaned down, his other arm shaking at the effort of keeping himself up. He kissed Cas like his life depended on it, but it was more like the two of them panted into each other’s mouths, eyes wide open. Staring at each other, memorizing the other’s face in this moment.
Dean shrugged, taking another pull of his beer. One of the cooks hollered from back in the kitchen. Ellen stood to leave. “Take care, boys. And really… I got a phone.”
Like a champ, Cas shrugged off her hand gently and patted it with his own. “I’m actually going to Grand Island next Friday for a conference. Sorry.” He looked contrite enough for Dean to start shifting on his feet. This was getting more uncomfortable by the minute.
Dean stopped reading again. “Do I like hunting ghosts in high schools in small-town Nebraska?”
They could have stopped the conversation there, just chalked it up to an awkward question asked over too many beers. But now, Dean had to know. The question was buzzing in his skull like a mosquito.
Castiel’s hand slapped him lightly on the back. Dean’s skin was sweaty and he was sure his own wasn’t much better. “Because you’re a raging slut, just like I am?”
“You’ll... be on your way.”
time.
“No idea. I don’t wanna pry too close into someone else’s business. ‘Specially since it’s a friend-of-a-friend situation, ya know?” Sam can practically hear her shrugging.
Dean knelt to the ground again, shuffling in between Castiel’s knees so that his calves bracketed the man in front of him. With his legs spread slightly like this, there was no way Castiel could hide the fact that he was very turned on by the mere act of Dean taking off his clothes.
“This all belongs to the theater department?” Dean marveled. He picked up a realistic stuffed parakeet that he was convinced could fly away any minute.
Castiel rolled his shoulders back and turned towards the handsome stranger. He felt a genuine smile, not just his customer one, bloom across his face to meet the man’s widening grin as Castiel came towards him.
“Oh, LA has its ghosts. Fewer people go missing or die as a result of those ghosts though. And anyway, I prefer it out here.”
He kept replaying the conversation over and over in his head.
“I just— “
His dad’s voice finished that thought in his head with a word that made Dean cringe.
Castiel grabbed the napkin and wrote down the name. He looked up, light flashing off his glasses. “Lonnie Oswald. You think people would have talked about him more. That’s pretty dark for a high school.”
"…but what's your pinky called?"
“You’re asking for money?”
Anna stood again and went to retrieve her bag from where she dropped it when she entered the apartment. “Nah, I’m starting something here, I can feel it.” She pulled out her dance gear and tossed it in the laundry basket sitting near the kitchen. They’d have to drive down to the laundromat in a few days. She turned back to Dean. “I’d like to visit, though. If you can bear letting Castiel out of bed for a while. He promised he’d come see me in the Gala at the end of April. It’s when we graduate. Well—when I graduate, I guess we’ll see where Castiel is at in terms of credits.”
"I-uh-....yes. Eileen, this is my dad." Now she's confused too.
When Cas got out of the Empty, Dean was right there waiting for him. He didn't give Cas a chance to say anything and started talking like someone who had a speech rehearsed but had suddenly forgotten it, all jumbled sentences that felt like he was dancing around a word he was afraid to say.
"Mmkay. Nice to meet you Eile-"
When Cas saunters into the kitchen, he doesn't walk in for a while, he just leans against the threshold of the kitchen door and stays there for a while, watching Dean from behind him. Sometimes Dean catches Cas looking at him like this and the fondness in his eyes is almost unbearable. Being loved like this is almost overwhelming for Dean, he feels like he's being given more than he can handle, so much love that he just holds in his hands afraid it'll fall because he doesn't know where to put it. He fears he simply has nowhere to put it, that whatever place everyone else has for that has disappeared with time for him. Cas assures him it's just hidden, and it'll appear with time. He says he's seen it, held it in his hands. That reassures Dean.
Castiel shrugged. “How much do you really care?”
“Uh. Ouch, Cas.” Dean held up his hands.
“Trust me sweetheart, you’re never gonna have to buy another paintbrush or canvas again. I’ll get you what you need.” Mr. Winchester stood up and stuffed his hands in his jacket pockets, still impeccably put together at the late hour in his leather jacket. “And you know what I want, so… it’s yours if you want it.”
Dean agreed. Overhead, a tinny bell sounded, driving the throng of students bustling down the hallway. A few said hello to Castiel as they passed. Soon, they were left in an empty hallway.
“Wait,” Cas leaned back. “Is he—? Gross. Look.” He turned the laptop towards Dean, twisting the dumb fabric placemat that was sitting on the table with it.
“… get out.”
Castiel’s hands wandered back up to Dean’s face, brushing back his sweaty hair and tracing across his cheekbones. He spread his legs more so Dean had no choice but to fall further into him. He shushed Dean, internally thrilling to the raw want in his eyes. “Come on, Dean. Come for me.”
“Are you at his house now?” Anna asked, her voice sounded strange.
Castiel shook his head.
“You clean this entire place? It’s huge.” Castiel marveled.
“I shouldn’t have come with you—I
Castiel ignored the threat of a new car.“Even if you want to treat me like a boyfriend?”
“I dunno if you’ve heard of refractory periods—“
Castiel laughed. His phone buzzed again.
He drinks a lot when he thinks about that envelope.
“Yes, that’s Trevor,” Cas said carefully. “He works at the dance studio and lets me sit in on rehearsals to draw sometimes. He’s very nice.” He can’t get a solid read on Dean’s response to this. He also didn’t know if he wanted Dean to be upset or indifferent more.
The man laughed and put up his hands. “Okay okay. I’ll give you one thing, your voice certainly doesn’t sound like you’re sixteen and three-quarters.” His eyes twinkled like he knew he was getting under Castiel’s skin and enjoyed the process.
The man’s voice stopped him. “And who are you going to go for next, hmm? Maybe that guy over there that looks like he eats little things like you for breakfast?” He glanced over across the bar by the window where a man easily three times Castiel’s weight sat, surveying the bar with beady black eyes. “I’m sure he’s real willing to take care of you.”
He ripped the cover off, and barely spared a glance at the sapphire-blue paint job of the expertly restored roadster, before hauling himself inside. He jammed the key in the ignition and turned the engine over. He looked over his shoulder to throw the car in reverse and back out of this stupidly big garage. He pointedly ignored Dean, leaning against the Impala, and his carefully blank expression.
Dean had to rub his eyes and lean in close to see what Cas was looking at. He had blown up a small section of the grainy obituary and adjusted the contrast of the screen. He felt a bit like a old man historian looking through Dead Sea Scrolls. Just barely legible, in loopy handwriting, was an entry by
“It’s just something you said before and it was probably just in the heat of the moment and everything, but I have to know—“
Castiel felt a blush creep up. He grinned. “Beats me. But you know… while I’m here…”
“Shit.”
“Cas! Hold your horses, man. I just walked in the door,” Dean chuckled, though clearly still worried. “Mind telling me why you’re in my garage, covered in paint and tears, trying to rip my clothes off?”
“It was disobedience.” Cas looked uneasy. “He was working against us.”
"No," Dean gritted out, trying to ignore the sense that he was falling through empty air. He doubled down, casting around wildly for an argument. "This is about – about you not having my back on a hunt."
Keeping his eyes down, he rested his fingertips in the hollows between Cas’ knuckles, applying gentle pressure. “I’m sorry I’ve been such an asshole about it. I think…” Cas’ hand flexed, but he didn’t move or speak, both of them looking at their hands.
“Of course,” said Cas, nodding. “Did she ever talk about anything strange – an odd experience, perhaps? Or England?”
They inched along on the highway for ten more minutes – with the occasional car honking and motorist cursing – while they played “I Spy”, separated from the outside world in the Impala like an oasis in a desert.
So that was how Dean had ended up letting Cas into his dorm room, waiting for the other foot to come down just as he had been waiting for this whole time, during this whole damn thing. It was like he could see its shadow above him, zeroing in on his head as it came down. And then it did.
Things were still awkward after the events of the previous day, albeit at a more tolerable level, and Dean kept waiting for the restlessness to kick in, the itchiness, the annoyance. But – despite the inherently rage-inducing exercise of moving two feet forwards every few minutes – it didn’t come. He chalked this up to looking forwards to eating a cheesesteak once they got to Pennsylvania, but he had a nagging feeling it was something else.
Cas heard the fear in Dean's voice and his face twisted in confusion, sidelining the anger for the moment. "Is this about the shifter taking my form? Because I'm
“Uh – yeah.” His hands felt numb. He wasn’t sure what to say. “Uh, that’s – great. That’s great, Cas, I’m happy for you. Have a baguette for me or whatever.” He winced.
Outside, evening had fallen, the sky turned a deep, starless indigo, and the rain had let up, the cool air welcome on his hot face. The damp pavement glowed dully with the flickering light of the neon motel sign.
He had closed his eyes, wetness running down his cheeks now, when he felt the touch of a warm, dry hand; he opened his eyes to find Cas was leaning across the gap between them to place his hand over Dean’s own. He didn’t say anything, didn’t even look Dean in the eyes, which he was grateful for. Dean didn’t move for fear that Cas would move his hand or disappear, and they sat that way for some time, neither of them saying anything, until Dean’s breathing had evened out and the tears had stopped flowing. Then he struggled to a sitting position in bed, wincing at the pain in his…everywhere. Dean pretended not to notice Cas remove his hand.
Uriel? Dean was shocked. “Was it the demons?”
Dean rolled his eyes. “You’re just mad ‘cause you can’t read a map.”
He didn’t feel anything as Castiel brought the blade up and then back down again, tracing the same path through the air like a planet orbiting the sun. Dean’s eyes followed it with a kind of passive acceptance, recognizing the inevitability of its destination.
He opens his eyes, squinting against the sunlight. It’s Charlie again. This time with the addition of Garth, Dean’s other roommate.
It wasn’t that Dean didn’t want to
Dean shifted in his seat.
Dean stifled a giggle, shaking his head. “Nothing.”
“Well, we’ve still got lots of old files to look through back home. I bet we’ll find something in one of ‘em.”
"Dean - "
He knew that not a lot of the other students knew much about Cas’ family, let alone had met any of them, and he'd taken a naïve pride in it.
He knew they should talk about it, but the thought of it made his heart race, his hands sweat. He was afraid he would ruin everything. That the way things were when Cas came back – easy, happy – would be lost, or that, even worse, Cas might leave. Dean didn’t think he could take it if Cas left. He’d already been gone for so long, and who knew what Cas might get up to if he left? What he might end up doing, out there in the world as a brand new human? What if he started a life, started a family?
. The word seemed to hang in the air between them. Dean shrugged, trying to avoid it. “Don’t worry about it.”
him, because he did. That was the problem.
Castiel raised his face to Dean’s and Dean found himself momentarily entranced by the curve of Cas’s cheek, the fan of his dark eyelashes against his browbone. He shook himself mentally. “Why do the angels think I can save all those people?” His voice trembled slightly, as if to reflect the feeble spin the room was beginning to take on.
The trunk of the Impala was open, the contents rifled through and messy. Dean slammed it shut and leaned against the back of the car, feeling again like he was going to puke, tasting acid at the back of his throat. He willed himself not to.
Cas pressed another kiss to his mouth, gentler now but with his hands still moving, still pulling Dean’s body into his. Dean felt like he was approaching the point of becoming overwhelmed, his skin feeling like it was on fire from Cas’s touch. His breath was coming in gasps, his heart racing. His legs felt unsteady.
Sam nodded excitedly. “What if they accidentally cured a demon?”
to hate you, and I
The sky was getting dark by the time they got back to the Blue Moon Motel, the air thick with tension. Cas slammed the car door and Dean followed suit, his head buzzing with a white noise that threatened to drown out all other sounds. He had the impression of a pot of boiling water set on a too-hot burner, about to overflow, and as soon as they were inside the motel room, Cas was already whirling to face him, the lapels of his trenchcoat flapping wildly. He was the angriest Dean had ever seen him – like a painting of holy wrath come to life.
He’d sort of expected it to scare him away, to be honest.
Cas wanted to look away, but instead he said, “This is too much to ask, I know.” He knew his words weren’t enough. “But we have to ask it.”
“No,” Cas said finally. His cheeks were flushed in the pale yellow light of the parking lot.
“Dean? Are you awake?” It was Cas’ voice.
, even if that guy was an angel. Even if that angel was Cas.
Speaking for the first time since Dean had arrived, Cas added, “It’s similar to a collection of case studies. Each section is a different experiment.”
They settled on the couch after clearing off some of the larger items covering it. Adelaide made no move to help them.
Dean dismissed this with a wave, and a shot of whiskey. He gestured exaggeratedly to the identical shot in front of Cas. Cas sighed deeply and downed it as easily as if it were water.
And then he couldn't think of anything else but the feel of Cas' hands on him, hungry and surprisingly insistent - in his hair, on his arms, slipped under the hem of his shirt to trace slow fingers over the sensitive skin at the small of his back. Dean shuddered at the touch, gasping something that could've been words but was probably just Cas' name against his mouth.
“How did you…” Dean stopped. “Wait, what the fuck, you don’t even sleep.”
“Patrick.”
Castiel ran a hand through his hair. “That’s what I'm trying to figure out, I guess.”
“Thank you for coming to my show, Ms. Talbot. It’s an honor.”
“Good.” Dean said, smile apparent in his voice. He removed his hands from Castiel’s body and walked away, his footsteps hushed on the thick carpet.
That stopped Dean. “You dated her?” He wasn’t sure why that stung a tiny bit.
“Yeah? I know you want to come, you’re dying for it, aren't you? So good. Come on sweetheart, let go for me. You’re gonna feel so good when you do, come for me. Come all over my hand, I can see how bad you want it.”
sure that Cas was some kind of demon or something, because the way he reached down and grabbed Dean’s ass to grind into him was some kind of evil and ten kinds of hot.
Scooping his hand through his hair, Dean looked around at the other patrons of the bar. Ellen looked over and raised an eyebrow. “Jesus, Sam, no. He’s super legal. Could you keep it down—“
“Was he absolutely sure you wanted him to leave?” She asked, gently. “Did you tell him to leave?”
Cas shook his head, scoffing. “No. No, it was great. But I have to see more of your first time with a man, Dean. Fuck me.”
“So, what do you consider a ‘first time’? Just so I know what to avoid.”
“I know—“
“I just—Dean, me too.” Castiel stared at the man beneath him for a moment longer, before pressing his mouth solidly to Dean’s.
“We still don’t have a good place to burn these.” Dean pointed out. He wasn’t crazy about starting a fire in the parking lot of the motel, and he knew he’d have a trooper on his ass in about twenty minutes if he tried to drive out to the country to do it. With so much open space and farmland, almost everyone was looking out for each other’s property.
He looked around and ducked into the nearest Starbucks. The place was reasonably empty for being four in the afternoon. He settled at a table just as he turned his phone on. He set it in the center of the table, and just waited…
Dean picked up both tubes again and squinted at them. “That’s so weird. They’re both black… but like… not.”
“You have a lot of bones in your hips,” Cas whipped Dean’s pants behind himself. “And your legs,” He laid himself somewhat akwardly between Dean’s legs so that his face was level with Dean’s cock. “And basically all over, Dean.” Dean’s eyes seemed to get wider and wider with every passing second. He let his head drop back against the chair.
Thunking his head on the mirrored wall behind him, Castiel pushed himself to his feet. Anna sashayed over, bouncing her eyebrows the whole way. “Sooooo? How did that go? You two looked cozy.”
“You’re supposed to safeword if it gets to be too much.” Dean’s tone sounded flat and he wouldn’t look at Castiel.
“Yeah, I’m really feeling the sincerity.” Dean said, snark heavy in his tone.
Dean's story.
What most people also don’t know about Dean Winchester is that he genuinely enjoyed his earlier days of his company more than his current ones. Sure, it sounds a little strange, who wouldn’t love the power, the prestige, the fine clothes, everything that comes with being one of the richest men in the bustling city of Chicago at the relatively tender age of 30? But the truth is that he misses the days when he and his secretary, Charlie, were operating their business out of a washed out storefront on the south side of the city. Most people wouldn’t even have believed that man, the one who had given up his parents’ fortune, made in the arms industry, to start this company with only his two hands (four including Charlie’s) and the $15,000 he’d saved from his own accounts since leaving college.
“Yeah, just couldn’t sleep.”
“I feel even more uncultured than usual, not being able to tie a tie correctly.”
Dean tilted his head and let a smile spread across his face and he slowly looked Castiel up and down.
The other man was getting impatient though, it seemed. Cas hitched his hips forward, pressing them together all along their fronts. Dean gasped as he felt exactly how into this Cas was too. The feel of another man’s cock throbbing against his, even through a few layers of cloth was overwhelmingly sexy, and as Dean laid his head back to the feel of Cas’s teeth along his carotid artery, he couldn’t help thinking that it was a damn shame he hadn’t been able to show up to the hospital that morning and show off the big ol’ hickey on his neck that was already there from the previous night to put Melody in her place. Maybe now he would with a matching one on the other side.
Castiel grabbed his hand again and pressed it firmly to the back of his head. He didn’t give this privilege to many clients—hardly any—but this was something he trusted Dean with implicitly. “Show me how you like it. Tell me how to make it good for you.”
Dean rapped on the desk for attention, brought by a middle-aged woman coming out from the back. Her eyeliner was thick around her eyes, caking into her crows feet.
For the person that wanted "sweaty, greasy, garage sex", I'm so sorry about the cop out. It's coming, I promise...
bulge at the front of his slacks, and walked over to click the lamp off. The room was cast into darkness, lit only by the light-up sign from the grocery store across the street and the changing stop light on the corner. Dean barely managed a nod of thanks, for understanding his weird hangups, before Cas sank down again in front of him, palms trailing up his thighs like brands, scorching the surface and leaving light in their wake.
“What if he asks for the expense report?” Castiel fretted.
“They
When the server came back with the menu, Dean gave it a cursory glance before asking for the tiramisu and coffee. She smiled and made good on her promise to have it to their table in five minutes. With the plate in front of him and the fork in his hand, Castiel stopped and looked up at Dean.
Bobby, Missouri, and Dean talked amicably over their breakfasts, making conversation about their plans for the day, like a normal family, like there wasn’t an extra guest at the table who gave blowjobs for spare cash in the back alleys of Chicago. Castiel would feel like he was intruding, but Dean made sure to include him as well. Missouri, who Castiel got the feeling was more like a mother to Dean than a housekeeper, asked if he was in school and he talked for a bit about his projects for class. Dean paid attention the entire time like he was genuinely interested in what he had to say, and even asked his opinion on the Paul Gaugin exhibit in the Field.
“I will.” Castiel promised.
“Oh yes,” Missouri said, snatching up Castiel’s discarded t-shirt and dropping it into her basket. “He’s got about five cars down there that I know he’s working on. The boy comes to breakfast with grease under his fingernails, and bags under his eyes. It’s not healthy.” She replaces his t-shirt with a clean one from out of nowhere. Castiel can’t be sure, but judging from the size, he’s pretty sure it’s one of Dean’s.
“You’re a new custodian?” She asked. Definitely a pack-a-day type if Dean had ever met one.
“Cas, if you can hear me, you gotta take the reins.” Dean tried shakily.
Alfie looked around. The walls on either side of the gate were tall, with ivy climbing up. He’d read somewhere that ivy actually destroyed the stonework, even though it looked cool and historic and whatever other shit the layout mooks went on about while designing photoshoots. “Capture the architecture, Alfie!” “We need more of the Gothic influence, Alfie!” God. Alfie was tired of hearing it. Maybe if they waited around long enough, the ivy would crumble the wall and they could get into the estate without the psycho with the shotgun coming after them. Alfie fiddled with the lens cap and wandered away from the group.
Hey folks! Sorry this wasn't up earlier; I recently had a parent get hospitalized, so this had to get pushed back a bit. Thankfully, it's only a day late!
possessing Adler—and who knows how many other people on his mad killing spree in the theater over the years. Whatever mojo he had, he was clearly made of something stronger than your average Casper. Dean profiled out Oswald as best he could on the worn pages, trying to include everything he and Cas had dug up. The timelines seemed to fit nicely together. When a death had occurred in the school, the principal or drama teacher never seemed to stick around long afterwards, and were usually replaced. If Oswald was jumping from person to person, he’d be able to stick around for a damn long time.
Dean’s broken in to a lot of places. He’s broken out of more, but that’s usually the easier part of his gig anyway. The school itself didn’t look like it had the cutting edge of security, but the old busybodies with their craning necks and suspicious squinting at newcomers down at the grocery store on the next block could complicate Dean’s life a lot more than any hackable security camera. Even so, Dean knows what he’s doing. Pick a vulnerable spot—a propped open dock door, open window, anywhere that’s not the
“No, but I know the worst thing is feeling like you’re annoying someone you like, and I didn’t want to put him through that. I texted him last night.” Cas went back to his book. It was one thing to talk about his love life with his best friend and roommate. It was quite another to dive deep into his deep-rooted issue with finding a suitable replacement for... someone he actually wanted.
“What’s the advice?”
Dean hesitated. Might as well be honest with the guy. “I really am here because of a haunting.”
Anna’s big blue eyes narrowed in suspicion. “You’re going back to him, aren’t you?”
“Hey, just because they’re not doin’ so hot anymore…” Dean’s actual smile dropped off his face.
Well, if he would even talk to Dean, that’d be a miracle in itself.
“Um…” she glanced towards the hallway, unsure, “Mrs. Denney already took my money box. I don’t know…?” She stood up, like she might go find a teacher, which was the last conversation Dean wanted to have right now.
“We probably want the prop room. All of the stuff we’d pulled for this show, we’d had to get new or rented.” Cas explained as he walked through the roll-up door, Dean on his heels.
“Oh, you like that don’t you?” Castiel raised an eyebrow, enjoying the change of power here. It wasn’t often that he was the one in charge of… well, anything.
Food did sound good. He hadn’t eaten all day and he wasn’t looking forward to a whole night of being hungry. “No funny business?”
“So, you were yelling about something when you came in.” Castiel prodded her for attention.
“Is there something you want me to be doing right now…? Do you want a drink?” Castiel fidgeted with his belt loop. All this not-talking-or-getting-down-to-business was making him feel antsy and out of his element.
Dean raised an eyebrow. “You don’t look at me like that. Like I look at you.”
“What the
Cas took the book, flipping through it quickly before dumping it in the box on the table marked for give-away. “The kids like being able to spend time with the teachers, too. It’s a rite of passage for them.” He folded the flaps shut and taped up the box with efficiency that Dean absolutely did
“He will if he goes back to his office. I took that folder right off his desk.”
“Does he know?” She asked. Dean opened his mouth and glanced around uneasily. “Sorry, that’s personal.” He shrugged, but chose not to answer. In all fairness, she really did not want to know the finer points of Castiel’s love life. “Just promise me you aren’t going to keep him locked away in that huge-ass fortress of yours.”
Cas laughed too, “I’ve had years more practice, don’t sweat it.” He tilted his head, still smiling, before heaving himself off the couch and pushing back into Dean’s space on the floor. He laid over Dean’s body and crowded in close for a kiss. “Not that you should, anyway. That was thoroughly” he pecked Dean’s cheek, “absolutely” his other cheek “satisfactory.”
The deputy frowned. “What’s wrong with him?”
From there, Castiel’s awareness focused on bits and pieces of the experience, too caught up in the heady lust between the two of them to stay tuned in for long. Dean’s tongue swiping across his chest, his own hand pressed to the sheets by Dean’s strong fingers, thrusting upwards into Dean’s heat and hearing both of their breathing stutter.
“Oh come on, busting out of gates in a car, cruising around town with a billionaire you’re secretly banging. Isn’t this every teenage fantasy you’ve ever had?”
He understood. Castiel understood perfectly well. The Graduate Gala was the one event that pulled in 70% of the funding for the next year. Students about to graduate, as well as alumni, put in pieces to be auctioned off. Only the best were chosen for auction, and it was a huge honor to even be featured. Castiel had been considering putting in his painting of eyes meant for Dean’s living room, just for the honor. “So, what does that mean?”
“So,” he started, looking Castiel up and down in a way that made him feel the need to hide and preen simultaneously, “Something happened between yesterday afternoon and an hour and a half ago that made you change your mind on the whole sub thing. You wanna tell me about it or should I guess?”
“And you know, right away? Who you’d like to kiss?” Dean asked like there was any possible way Cas would turn him down.
“Probably do it again?”
Weird.
Castiel tried not to smile, but declined. “I try not to drink on the job.”
Unless it made everything worse, and Dean decided he didn’t want to mess around with a pathetic virgin anymore. Dean’s tongue slipped down his shaft and then back up as Dean pulled off. He lapped at Castiel’s slit, causing Castiel to arch his back, hand coming up to grip at the back of the sofa. He was whimpering now.
“Oh come on! It’s cute! With the—“ Castiel mimes swinging a hula hoop around his narrow waist, “Classic crowd pleaser. And with the tassels?” Anna shoves a laughing Castiel into the bushes, but helps him up after. In all truth, Anna could make any routine seem effortless and beautiful, she was a wonderful dancer.
“Slowly, put it in and get me wet.” Cas whispered against his lips, coaching him through opening him up. Dean was an excellent student, and before long, Cas was keening for it. Dean was ravenous for the sight Cas made underneath him, not even daring to blink for fear of missing something. His calf muscles were cramping something fierce, and he was sure Cas must feel the same with his thigh muscles held so tight. With three fingers in now, Dean passed over a spot inside—
He took a deep breath. This was just another encounter. Just had to bite the bullet and take it, to get it over with. He didn’t even have to like it, as long as the experience was there. Maybe then he could text Dean and tell him he was ready to make a deal, and properly earn it this time.
“I’ll stay.” Cas whispered. Dean’s face broke into a huge grin. He reached over and clicked off the desk lamp and settled down with Cas against his chest. Dean’s breath ghosted over his forehead.
He turned around. “Dean—“
“If one of us signed that paper, the deal was off. No questions asked.”
Dean had to change his suit. Castiel had to have Dean retie his tie.
Cas pulled back after a second. Dean was sure he looked as shell-shocked as he felt. He waited for Cas to laugh or something, but Cas’s eyes didn’t open. “I’m sorry, I—“
Cas sighed. “I know a pity fuck when I see one. I just want you to know I’m not expecting you to... reciprocate how I feel—or anything.” He finished, suddenly bashful again.
Dean sank back against the chair. “Son of a bitch.”
But it was the way Cas said it that got Dean so bad. They had been fine! They both knew what was happening, both agreed that they would ride it out while he was in town, maybe even part as friends. Sure, Dean would be more than a little sad to see him go, but he had his job. And who knew? Maybe Dean would have even blown into town again to see him? Just a quick pop in to say
If it were possible, Dean blushed even harder. “Yeah, I get it—so you see why I feel so stupid trying to… to save you from this, right?”
Dean chuckled and stepped away from the two drama teachers, intent on heading towards the gym door that had been propped open to let some cool air into the stifling gym. It might not be very populated, with the size of the drama department, but the air handlers were still woefully ill-equipped to de-must-ify a group of teenagers.
As he pulled out the first large folder, a thinner one fell out from behind it. Dean stooped to pick it up, and flipped the top open. He frowned at the first page as he straightened up.
Cas was nowhere to be found. The bed was messed up, like someone had been sleeping there, but its former occupant was nowhere to be found. Dean sat up and rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He heard shuffling behind the closed bedroom door, and got up to investigate. He was still in his boxers, and was very much dealing with a case of morning wood. He didn’t get too worked up about it though. Not like Cas hadn’t seen it already. He checked his hair in the round mirror that hung on the wall above the dresser to make sure it wasn’t too crazy. He definitely had a hickey blooming on the side of his neck that he’d have to tease Cas about later. But, he supposed, Cas would probably just get back at him with the bruises he knew he left around Cas’s right nipple.
Sam raised an eyebrow. “Oh, you’re a seasoned sugar daddy?”
The way Bobby’s face darkened told Castiel that 1) that was the wrong answer, and 2) Bobby knew better. Castiel sighed, slumping where he stood.
They cooked dinner together too. Cas admitted that pasta was about the breadth of his culinary skill, so Dean gallantly offered to make cheeseburgers, showing Cas how the broiler in the oven could be used just as well as a grill. Dean was then treated to the absolute
“And no one thought this was weird? Seriously, what is it with this town?”
“Right,” Dean said quickly. “So it’s not a big deal.” He turned, towel slung around his hips and stepped out of the bathroom into the bedroom. He crossed to the dresser and pulled open a drawer, fishing out sweatpants and t-shirts for the both of them. He handed both of these, along with some clean boxers, to Castiel, keeping his back turned through this interaction. He stepped into the boxers, and quickly pulled the sweats and t-shirt on, shielding himself from view and from the tension Castiel felt creeping around.
Dean shushed him soothingly—if slightly condescendingly—and took him deep down his throat, down to the root.
Dean’s gaze grew heated. “You were so good, too. Kept reaching forward for me… I’d be happy to do that again if you liked it.”
“Exactly. If you really loved what you do—“ Castiel looked thrilled at his own brilliance.
"What's it called though?" Cas rolled his eyes.
Then Dean shifted the vibrator so it smoothed all over the head of his leaking cock and all chances of keeping quiet flew out the large bay window.
“I Spy,” Dean repeated. “I pick something I see and I tell you the color, and you have to guess what it is.”
“You should show me some respect,” Castiel said quietly. “I dragged you out of hell. I can throw you back in.”
“It’s crap, is what’s wrong with it.”
, though what
“No.” She looked between him and Cas, her eyes narrowing. “Why are you asking me so many questions about my grandmother?”
Sam shrugged. “He’s waiting in the car.”
“Fuck you,” Dean said, at a loss for anything else to say. It felt like his mind had gone blank, whirring rapidly but not going anywhere.
“That’s not what I mean,” he said absently. “Uriel is dead.”
They made it barely an hour before hitting a traffic jam on I-70. There’d been some kind of accident somewhere along the highway, and two lanes of traffic were closed, resulting in a long line of vehicles all jammed end to end along the road like a queue of shiny, multicolored insects.
He sensed the eye roll before Sam answered, “Yes, the soup is being eaten.” Dean shifted the phone to his other ear, eyeing a cat strolling down the sidewalk on the other side of the parking lot.
“I forgive you,” Cas told him simply.
. He's going to France tomorrow, it's over." He had said the words with an air of triumph, expecting this bit of information to prove Sam wrong, but as soon as the words leave his mouth, he realizes his mistake.
“Dean?” Cas repeated. He was kneeling next to him on the cold floor.
There’d been a thunderstorm last semester. The whole day had been humid and claustrophobic, storm clouds rolling in from the west, until the first peal of thunder rang out and it finally began to rain, much harder than it’s raining now.
Cas tilted his head. “What’s so funny?”
“Nope.”
Dean wasn’t listening, his sandwich aspirations forgotten. It seemed like the world was dissolving into silver sparks again. Dean thought he could feel them settling down on his shoulders, his hair, and on Castiel’s eyelashes. He reached out to touch them but at some point along the way his arm got too heavy and he ended up simply placing his hand on Cas’s cheek. It felt nice. Soft, despite the drag of omnipresent stubble. Dean thought that he could probably pull Cas down to bring his face level with Dean’s, which for some reason was something he wanted very much to do, but now he was finding it difficult to move at all. Which was a necessary component of the whole operation, Dean observed placidly. Instead, he just stared into Cas’s lovely blue eyes from his current position on the floor.
The next three hours seemed to pass in fits and starts, time feeling alternately viscous like honey and as slippery as mercury. Cas woke him up three more times to drip antidote into his mouth. Slowly Dean began to become more aware of his surroundings, feeling more like a person, his head clearer.
They were both quiet for the rest of the drive.
He found himself getting lightheaded quickly, but he still didn’t break the kiss. In the end it was Castiel who broke it, putting his left hand on Dean’s shoulder and pushing until Dean was forced back a step, panting.
“What? Yeah?” Dean squinted at him.
Cas closed the book and stowed it in a bag next to the table, replacing it with the coffee. He looked oddly pleased as he peered into the steam of the coffee. Dean wondered why, but frankly he didn’t mind the change; he didn’t think he could stand another tense, uncomfortable car ride. He felt himself relaxing in spite of himself.
Cas was standing, was heading for the door. “Goodbye, Dean.”
Dean just had time to share another look with Cas before the rattle of the chain came again and the door swung open all the way, revealing an older woman – in her seventies, Dean guessed, with short, graying blonde hair. She wore capri pants and long sleeved white sweater. A thin silver wedding band gleamed on her finger.
Dean relaxed incrementally. “It’s fine, dude. You said it yourself, it’s not worth the risk if they can use it to track you.” Cas lifted his eyes to meet Dean’s, and he felt the breath catch briefly in his throat. He added, “I mean, it’s not like the angels would just leave me alone if they caught us. They hate me just as much as they hate you.”
It was only when he felt the blood rising in his throat, hot and thick and choking, that it finally began to hurt.
“S’ok, Cas, I’m ok, I’m fine.” Dean sat up. His head felt like it was full of something fuzzy. A wave of dizziness rolled over him and suddenly the world exploded into a shower of silver sparks. Oh, he was not fine. He was – he was…he was mesmerized by the way the lights overhead reflected on Castiel’s hair. “Cas?” he murmured, dazed. “When did you get so beautiful?” Holy shit, it was like a halo.
"Good."
Dean and Cas both laughed in the quiet of the kitchen, Cas’ hands slipping away from Dean, and then the moment was gone.
“When you – ” Dean stopped kicking the wall, surprised. “You talked to Cas? When?”
Now, as Dean watches Hatchet Man chase a screaming teen down a hallway, he decides that, yes, that was it. It was that campy horror movie they’d watched together that had ruined everything.
She rose to her feet, gripping the underside of the heavy glass coffee table and sending it flying towards them in one smooth motion. Dean had a moment to be dumbly incredulous at the strength of the old woman, and then he and Cas were scrambling to get out of the way of the blunt edge of the table sailing towards them. It clipped Dean’s leg, making him hiss in pain, and shattered upon hitting the ground, sending glass everywhere.
He pulled away from Cas to catch his breath, realizing as he did so that he was trembling all over, unable to stop it.
He staggered back from the force but managed to stay on his feet, and seeing his chance, he immediately threw himself forward, aiming a right hook at the shifter. Only silver would really hurt them, but a good blow to the jaw would disorient almost anybody, he reasoned.
“Okay,” Dean said slowly. He was grudgingly impressed. “Okay. This is something.” He took a contemplative sip of coffee. “So… how do we do it?”
"I don't have time for your fucking riddles, dude,” Dean says tersely. “I have things to do today."
Behind them stood Cas – the real Cas, lowering Dean’s Colt with shaky hands. “I found the bullets,” he said uncertainly. “Are you okay?”
After they hung up, Dean noticed Cas was looking at him strangely, fidgeting with the cardboard sleeve on the coffee cup.
“Yeah.”
Dean wasn’t sleeping well. He needed something to do.
“Okay.” Cas shrugged, unbothered. “I’ll pick another one. Silver?”
Cas blinked at him owlishly from the passenger seat. “What?”
“Oh,” Cas said, sounding relieved. His hands were still again, but he was markedly not looking at Dean.
The shifter was advancing on him, their face a mask of anger and hatred, holding something now in one clenched hand at their side. “Really?” they spat. “You’d punch an old lady? Do you have no morals?”
The song wasn’t as bad as it could’ve been, he figured. The singer was alright. He zoned out listening to it, his eyes on the highway.
He gets up to close it with a groan and then collapses back into bed, trying to go back to sleep. But he’s awake now, and still cold to boot, so he gives up after a few minutes and drags himself out of bed.
Cas hesitated for a second, prompting Dean to jerk his head violently at the door –
“You’ve been catching up on sleep for - ” Garth starts to say.
“Cas,” he breathed, almost unaware he was saying it.
“For what its worth...” he said haltingly. “I would give anything… not to have you do this.” He knew as he said it that it was the first wholly true thing he had told Dean Winchester since they arrived.
Dean is pissed off now - or at least, it feels like he is. His heart is beating too hard and too fast, and his face feels hot, while his hands feel oddly cold. He’s sweating through his t-shirt.
"I – " He broke off, hesitated. “Yeah." He averted his eyes in order to stare at the lightbulb in the lamp on his bedside table. It left blue afterimages seared into his vision when he looked back at Cas. "Yeah, I'm just checking with you."
“Everything’s fine,” Cas told him. “Go back to sleep.”
Sure, the sex was good, but no one would stay with a guy like Dean purely for good sex. And certainly not someone like Castiel.
“You’re supposed to say ‘with my little eye’,” Dean interjected.
. Dean had watched him for that entire first class, this gorgeous dark haired guy with perfect notes and careful hands. At the top of his notebook page was the name
Dean had to tilt his head up to look at Cas from the bed, unintentionally baring his throat to him, but somehow he felt like he would be content to just sit there forever, watching Cas look at him like that.
Cas tilted his head. “Why?”
“He was the demon,” Dean echoed.
“Doesn’t hurt anymore.”
“You were dreaming,” Cas whispered in the dark. The bed lowered as he sat down, careful to avoid Dean, even wrapped up in blankets as he was. Dean could just see the outline of him in the dark, a faint silhouette against the window.
“I mean – wait, how’d you know I wasn’t straight? Not like this is a gay bar.” His face warms as he speaks, although he’s not sure why.
"Fine."
He considers it for a moment, then goes back to his laptop. He wants to watch a movie.
“So, what’s the deal with the heaven stuff? The, uh, trouble in paradise?” Dean took a moment to chuckle at his own joke, then threw back another shot, grimacing a little.
“Oh.” Cas looked thoughtful, his eyes travelling absently from Dean’s pointing hand to his face, studying it. “I see.”
She studied them suspiciously for another second, then seemed to come to a decision, pulling back to shut the door in their faces.
.” Trying to regain some sense of control over the situation, he added, “That one wasn’t fair.”
“What?”
“France? Seriously?”
Castiel looked. He saw the same thing as Dean, he thought. Life. Innocence. Joy. He wasn’t supposed to value these things. He was a soldier, built for carrying out orders. Values, emotions, opinions, and least of all, doubts – these had no place in a war. He knew this. But he felt it all anyways. “Can I tell you something if you promise not to tell another soul?”
to see him. Every part of him – every flaw and insecurity and broken piece, everything he tried to hide.
“Sure,” Dean responds, still thinking about how he’s going to obtain coffee.
“Damn,” said Sam. “You’re being, like, optimistic. What did Cas do to you?”
on the world and you tried to become God, and whatever fucking else, and
“Cas…” Dean started. “The things that I did…” His voice trailed off. He breathed in shakily, lips trembling. “What I became… You ask me to open that door and walk through it? You will not like what walks back out.” Cas knew he didn’t just mean the door they stood in front of.
“I know. Rowena says the spell the witch used was a very simple curse with a simple cure. We have all the ingredients here.”
Cas leaned down to kiss Dean again, climbing onto the bed with him to do it properly. “Come here,” he murmured.
All told, it took them no fewer than three breaks for kissing to get back to the motel room.
When Dean wakes up, for a moment he feels the ghost of arms around him, the warmth of a chest pressed against his back.
Blankly, Dean opened his mouth, but no words came out. His limbs unfrozen, he pushed himself painfully to his feet, ignoring Cas’ offered hand, and stumbled out of the house. Cas watched him leave, looking bewildered and hurt.
Dean bit back a laugh. “None of the above.”
“You still alive over there?” Dean asked by way of greeting, trying for casual and falling short.
Cas' eyes were oddly bright. Softly, he said, "It's okay." He closed the door again, settling into the seat, seeming more relaxed than he'd been a moment before.
“The one between the kitchen and the main room.” Dean groaned; his head was killing him, and now his stomach felt like it was trying to escape his body. “I want a bigger kitchen.”
The next morning – which was really only a couple of hours later – Dean was struggling his way into wakefulness once again. He had all but forgotten his dream, although an undeniable tension lingered in the air between him and Cas.
Dean raised his bottle in a salute. “Always do.”
It was Cas’s turn to narrow his eyes. “You don’t know the half of it,” he muttered conspiratorially.
Note: I have no ill will against the Art Institute of Chicago. I think it’s an amazing place, and I would willingly spend a week wandering around it if I could. There’s an amazing feeling of seeing so much history and passion encompassed in the walls of one building. Chicago itself holds so much wonder, and I was so glad to be able to take part in it. This story is a love letter to some of my favorite places on earth. Also, the Institute is running an exhibit on the Golden Era of Chicago fashion right now, and I like to think Bela got her way and kicked Balthazar out to get it underway.
Still, he was happy that Anna’s talent was being recognized. “That’s great! See, I told you you should be teaching, instead of up on a pole.” Anna thwacked him again in the chest, but it was much more halfhearted this time. She knew it was true.
"Yeah I do. If she's the one I'm thinking of… geez Cas, she's a real witch."
Dean was positively
Castiel watched as Dean took his fingertip vibrator and set it ever so gently on the very tip of Castiel’s cock again. He jerked and gasped as Dean slid the fingertip over the head in circles. The circles got bigger, completely encompassing all of Castiel’s cock head and he heard his own breathing kick up into a heavy panting. He tore his eyes away from his cock and looked up to see Dean drinking in his facial expression with rapt attention. Dean smiled softly when he saw he had Castiel’s attention and leaned in to suck a kiss to the shaft of his cock.
He shuffled forward on his knees, running his hands up Cas’s slacks until he got to his fly. “Please, Cas,” he whispered. He reached in between the flaps of his pants and stroked him gently through the navy boxers underneath. Cas’s cock was hot and so,
“I think he misses when he had to keep the coyotes off his farmland back in Kansas.”
He turned his gaze purposely towards Dean, cranking up the pleading and adding in just a hint of batting his lashes. “Please come upstairs?”
Castiel wasn’t quite sure what Dean was doing over there this time, however. It seemed that he was always working on a new project, either for himself or a friend. Castiel thought that perhaps in another life, Dean could have made a living from restoring old cars and fixing broken ones. Whatever Dean was working on today, it was mostly covered by a sheet. Dean didn’t offer to show Castiel, and Castiel didn’t pry… too much.
“So ghosts are real?”
Castiel raised an eyebrow. “The Lincoln Manor? What’s there?”
“Well—it’s one thing to break into my boss’s office…” Castiel trailed off.
“Thought you were gonna get lucky on your date?” Dean raised an eyebrow teasingly.
Castiel assured Dean he would be fine in the garage if he was allowed to stay, and tolerated the quick kiss to his forehead before heading down the hallway, leaving Dean to his business dealings.
The man looked away, uneasy. “I… he’s been—giving me a lot of leash, so to speak. Probably more than I deserve, but I’m handling it.”
“Fuck, Cas. Do whatever you want. I don’t even fucking care anymore, just touch me.” Cas chuckled and sucked a kiss to Dean’s hip. He didn’t know what had gotten into him, but he didn’t care. This was obviously doing it for Dean and watching him unravel was getting dangerously addicting.
Dean’s heart sunk. “I… can be gone. Sorry, I didn’t…?” He fumbled and started to pull away. He was sure his pants were on the floor beside them, but his shirt might still be out in the living room. He was stopped by Cas tightening his limbs around Dean’s.
“You’re so close, sweetheart. I can see it. You’re all hot and bothered and you’re ready to come for me like a good boy. You gonna do it?” Dean shifted the vibrator so it trailed down his cock. Castiel felt so hot. His abdomen was tight and coiled, ready to blow like he had never felt before. It was always like this with Dean. He always felt so out of control and dizzy and wonderful. He didn’t know how he was expected to ever let this go.
“Yes, Dean.” Cas sounded like he was smiling.
“Thank you, Dean, but scientifically speaking, it has to be me. I’m the only constant in this string of nearly identical outcomes.” Not much else could explain it. Cas was just... bad at love. Bad at being in a relationship. Bad at getting on with his life.
” he said in his thick accent.
“Are you kidding me—alright, hang on,” Dean straightened up and walked over to the fridge. Castiel craned his neck around to make sure he wasn’t going anywhere, but he only pulled a bottle of water out of the fridge and returned to sit next to Castiel, still giving him plenty of room. He reached down and handed Castiel’s pants to him, with the silent order to put them on that Castiel didn’t dare ignore. When he was dressed, he immediately scooted closer to Dean, who sighed and put his arm gingerly around Castiel’s shoulders.
Dean sighed, coming back down the stairs. He set the briefcase down again and dropped the shirt on top of it. He came up to Castiel and wiped the tears away. Castiel wondered what he must be thinking of his sub right now, having to clean him up of tears twice in an hour.
The woman bounced her eyebrows and turned back towards the painting. “Forgive me, that’s not why I’m here. This piece is amazing. Is it a...?”
“Don’t laugh,” he warned, “but the name of the play is supposed to be curse on the theater if you say it out loud.”
Castiel swallowed, trying to control himself. He didn’t want to look too eager and risk Dean thinking he was too forceful to be a sub.
Dean hesitated. “It’s different coming from you.”
The light was starting to come in from the window, dimmed only slightly by the curtains that were drawn haphazardly over the glass. The slight noise from the highway just outside was already starting to come through with the rising of the morning. Dean sighed. They probably had to get up and get moving, didn’t they? Had a whole bag of hats to burn, ghosts to expel, messes to clean up.
“Then it’s set.”
“Well,” Castiel pretended to think about it, like he wasn’t already planning on agreeing to whatever this man wanted. “I’ll need some space to work.”
Dean reached out and picked up his hand. He cradled it between his own hands, pleading clear in his eyes. “I was hoping against everything you’d ignore me and stay. I didn’t know where you’d gone. Had no clue.”
“How many?”
last semester, it happened to my cooperating teacher as well. They let me have the reigns in February because he had suddenly come down with mono or something.”
“I signed it because I was done dealing.” Dean said, patiently. “I wanted to give you a choice. To keep what we had going, or do something else.”
but it wasn’t a reading he was familiar with. Pulses of energy, here and then gone in a flash. He held it different directions, trying to fine-tune the location up on the stage. It was stronger over on the south side of the stage by where the teacher was standing. Very strange.
Behind them, Jo got back in her piece-of-crap car and thumbed a few more words in her text.
“Okay,” Cas sounded strange in the close, tightly-packed room from above, “I think that’s the last one. We know it has to be one of these, because they just cleaned out the costume room last May. Although—“ he jumped down, hitting the carpet with a dusty
He took it and quickly zipped up his case. “Thanks… hate losing those.” He made the mistake of looking Trevor in the eye, warm green—bordering on hazel. The wrong shade of green, but close enough to be… problematic.
Castiel frowned. “I haven’t got a woman.”
Sarah turned around, sympathy clear in her eyes. “He’s still not himself?”
