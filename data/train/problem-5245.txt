. He didn’t understand why his brain even put together the similarities between gay actors and Cas – Cas was one of the least sexual people he knew. The guy had had sex, what, once? In how many millennia? It was wrong of him to even equate Cas in the same
a little odd. “Okay, I’m game. You get the lamb’s blood and I’ll get the FBI jackets –“
And that was how he found himself watching gay porn on a crappy motel tv with his dick buried in Suzie’s (Sharon’s??) enthusiastic mouth. It wasn’t even the good kind of porn, with two chicks – this was full throttle, strap yourself in and hold on tight, dude on dude action, and it… wasn’t awful. Of course, he was mainly focused on the full,
“It’s got Cas!” Dean forced out again, gritting his teeth. His chest was starting to hurt again. “I just tried to call him and that – that
It felt different, now, than the last time they had cut through the overgrowth to the building beyond. Dean didn’t know if it was the later hour, bathing everything in a rich, inky darkness, or whether it was because he was alone with the knowledge of the true nature of what he was up against, but he found the hairs on the back of his neck start to prickle as he ascended the stairs of the porch – this time making sure to avoid the creaky boards. The air was still, dead, as he reached out and gingerly pushed the door open; like last time, it swung in on rusty hinges with barely any force at all.
Just as with the basement, he pressed his back firmly into the wall as he scaled the stairs, leaving him free to spot repeatedly between the hall below and the landing above. Both were impossibly dark; he gripped the lighter in his hand all the tighter, but didn’t flick it open quite yet. Instead, he reached out and felt his way through the blackness, taking as much care as he dared with each step. He’d never live it down if he died
It had been easy, then, to fall back into the little rhythm of their group. When Dean had gone home that evening – and he’d realised he was starting to think of Bobby’s house as
“Don’t touch your balls,” Cas replied, and he was – shit, he was
“How big are they? And what colour?” Paxton’s voice filtered through again. “Could be a cave swallow’s nest, but they’re more likely snake eggs.”
He couldn’t even blame the surprise in Cas’s voice; it wasn’t exactly like he made a
“It knows I took its egg,” Dean admitted. “Said I had something that belonged to it.”
“Make it seem like they’d drowned to cover up the drained blood?” Dean muttered, and then shook his head. “It’s sloppy, that’s for sure.”
“Second of all,” he powered through, ignoring how his voice wavered. “Even if I had… done
“We fell for it, initially,” Cas shrugged one shoulder, “and the local law enforcement seem stumped.”
Dean paused, bottle halfway to his lips. “Okay, maybe it
But he was an idiot, and they both knew it. When it came to Cas, he was the biggest idiot in the world.
“Okay,” Dean agreed, watching as his brother grabbed a jacket to cover the blood on his shirt and made for the door. “Beer and pie.”
To keep himself from staring, he turned to his burger and immediately started pulling it apart, searching for the tomato so he could get it as far away from him as possible. Only… there wasn’t any tomato. He glanced up at Cas, who was watching him with a prickle of concern lining his face.
time jump,” Sam greeted, completely oblivious to what had happened in the minutes since their last call. “And please don’t tell me you’ve called to apologise for being an ass, because –“
“Your turn,” he gestured to the table. “Show me what you’ve got.”
“Well,” Sam started, having apparently found the page he was rifling for. “Get this: after we last spoke, I started going through some of the catalogues in the basement – you know, the really old stuff. I thought, with the weather manipulation, maybe you were dealing with an old god, or something like that.”
And then he stopped mid-sentence, a horrifying thought occurring to him. The guy had been in their kitchen because he’d been
“You’ll have to find him quickly, then, won’t you?” the stranger replied, voice thick as honey in Dean’s ears. “All that power, all that grace – how’s a boy supposed to resist?”
Emmie squealed out a laugh, but all of a sudden it had seemed very far away, as though Dean had been listening down a tunnel. Drew had frozen up beside him, and when Dean had risked a glance at him – heart suddenly thudding in his ears – he looked unsure of himself for the very first time. It was strange to see uncertainty on his face, Dean thought faintly – it didn’t look right.
Dean could only watch, as he dragged himself through the destruction, while they disappeared from view. It seemed only fitting, then, as his heart shattered in his chest, that the rest of the wall would take that moment to topple down, collapsing inwards directly on top of him. Something sharp and heavy struck the back of his head – and then he was gone.
“Wow, that was
– but close enough that the numbing agent would start to do its thing and make the whole area feel a little less tender.
“Not a cave sparrow, then?” Dean hummed, and grinned when Paxton rolled her eyes.
He wasn’t gay.
“Of course,” Cas replied without preamble, and Dean couldn’t help but grin.
… and Dean had found himself thinking… well
Dean didn’t twitch at
The flamethrower was heavy in his hands as he traversed the rickety stairs, back pressed against the far wall at all times so he could see both where he was going and where he’d been, but the weight was welcome in the absolute silence of the world around him. He found himself clinging a little harder than was strictly necessary, metal and rubber digging almost painfully into the meat of his hands, but the pain grounded him against the fluttering of his heart.
him hold his hand – and Dean could only imagine what they must look like to the other patrons. With every fibre of his being screaming against it, he forced himself to pull away. He tried to be casual about it, to not make it a big deal, because it wasn’t,
“Okay, okay,” Lilah announced, holding her drink high above her head. She’d had an almost shark-like grin on her face as she exclaimed, “I dare you to kiss Drew.”
“Another -?”
“Sure,” the sheriff nodded, and then gestured to the ranger beside him. “This is Anna Paxton, head ranger for the park. I’m Bill Davis from the county sheriff’s office.”
“I’m still not really sure how this will help your investigation,” Paxton confessed as Dean straightened again. “But feel free to take a look around. There are marks on some of the other trees just ahead, and there are some broken rock formations a little further still.”
“Lead the way.”
“Sure,” Dean replied with a jerk of his head. He definitely had a headache. “If you’re not interested in whatever that person is proposing –“
“I can assure you, it was a complete fluke,” Cas replied sincerely, and allowed himself to be hip-checked as Dean swept past him for his turn.
But he was cut off by a voice that decidedly
It felt like hours had passed by the time his feet hit the landing; his eyes strained against the darkness, clocking the closed bathroom door and the fact that the bedroom door was ajar, and almost tripped over something strewn across the floor in his haste to cross the hall. His feet tangled, catching him off-balance, and for a gut-wrenching second he was sure he was going to fall backwards down the stairs. He threw a hand out, almost blind, and a small gush of air left him when he caught what felt like the bannister in his grip. He clung for a second, catching his breath, while he furiously worked to get his feet free of whatever had trapped him.
The storm was still raging, was the first thing he noticed, quickly followed by the way the light from Castiel’s phone danced across his face where he laid, propped up against the head of the bed. He hadn’t turned any of the lights on; he
“With the same four puncture marks on the inner thigh?”
He quickly ran through what he and Cas had found since they’d last talked, from the victim connections to the house itself. Sam hummed through it all, and Dean could hear him flicking through some kind of book on the other end of the line.
, looking for sex!” Dean snapped firmly. “Now turn that thing off and go to sleep.”
“How do you mean?”
The problem, however, was that his brother could be just as stubborn as him when he really wanted to be. Almost a month had passed, and Sammy was still giving him the doe eyes whenever he didn’t think Dean could see him. It was the worst when he and Cas were near each other, so Dean had had no choice but to take a step back, distancing himself in case he accidentally let anything else slip that might further whatever argument Sam seemed to be putting together in his mind.
But in the same second, Dean knew that could never happen. Cas deserved to be with someone as good as him, as whip-smart and as beautiful, and Dean wasn’t any of those things. Everything he touched turned to shit, and he couldn’t –
Castiel nodded, body wracked with fine trembles, and Dean couldn’t decide if they were from cold or shock. He didn’t ask, instead went back to his task of gently, methodically cleaning his friend up.
Still not bad.
find defecation arousing.”
probably wouldn’t be the word I’d use to describe it,” Cas replied, folding his arms across his chest in a way that Dean recognised as defensive. “But don’t feel like you need to inquire, Dean. I know my taking male lovers makes you uncomfortable –“
“Just…” Dean had to take a deep breath to settle his thudding heart. “We are not having an in-depth conversation about kinks in a diner at ass-o’clock in the morning, so here’s the lowdown – some people like weird stuff, y’know,
“Experiment?” Cas offered.
“Front door was wide open, but
“Dean –“ Sam started, voice heavy with annoyance.
“- you know I only accept apologies in the form of that baked quinoa and feta salad from the veggie place in town that I like, and –“ Sam stuttered to a stop, Dean’s words apparently only just registering. “It
God, Dean was so in love with him.
“Cas did some research – she was the last living member of her family,” Dean swallowed heavily. “Why? What… what happens if the Impundulu can’t be passed down?”
Dean couldn’t help his smile, but decided not to comment on it.
Cas huffed, a noise Dean had come to recognise as fond exasperation, and continued, “I only mentioned it because there was a dog at the nurse’s station. The nurse said he was a therapy dog, but I was unaware that canines were capable of completing the necessary psychology examinations in order to qualify as a trained therapist.”
He should have known that curiosity eventually killed the cat.
“Alright, ladies,” he announced, letting Sam and Castiel into the motel room before him so he could be the one to lock the door behind his aching body. “Arms up.”
. It still felt wrong, even though Cas
, because he wasn’t attracted to men. He certainly wasn’t attracted to
Castiel frowned, thumb still tracing soft lines under Dean’s eye.
Dean couldn’t help the bitter huff of laughter that left his throat, and had to look away for a moment. “Nobody wants that job, pal – trust me.”
“We weren’t –“ he murmured, barely watching the road as he idly followed the egg rolling around on his dashboard. “It wasn’t like that. It’s not like we stopped being
Dean didn’t think about how close their asses had been to touching, because that would be ridiculous.
“Last minute decision,” Dean lied again, eyes flicking back to the body at their feet. “Just crossing the Ts.”

“Well,” Bobby shrugged, calm as a cucumber. “We can always try again tomorrow. Not like I couldn’t use the help in the ‘shop.”
because he was too afraid to hold onto him himself.
too well, and they both knew it.
“Or, two,” he continued, unable to stop himself now he’d started – why had he started, again? “You can turn the charm on a little, go buy that guy a drink, and save yourself from that shitty motel mattress for a night.”
. Either one of them could probably have held Dean down and done whatever they wanted to him –
But his feelings didn’t matter, because Cas deserved someone better – someone beautiful, like him. It hurt – God, it hurt like hell – but Dean could let him go if it meant he was happy. Cas deserved to be happy.
“Talk. To. Him,” Sam reiterated, pausing between each word for effect. “Before I knock your heads together.”
“Jesus Christ, Cas,” he heard himself croak, and had to snap his eyes shut for a second to keep himself from falling apart. He clutched the vial to his chest, feeling the small amount of grace fluttering around inside, and desperately willed himself not to think the worst.
“They’re…
He was just beginning to think it was a stroke of luck that he wasn’t particularly claustrophobic when, out of nowhere, the floor suddenly opened up and he toppled down onto a cavern floor below. He landed heavy on his arm, and pain, sharp and jarring, zipped all the way up his body. It wasn’t broken, he decided gingerly, but it sure as hell was going to leave a bruise.
She just had to learn to be okay helping him out in the way he wanted, not the way she wanted.
The last thing he wanted to do was to put Lucifer in danger, but he was getting the feeling that Raphael would not let them leave until either Dean or Mia prayed to him, so Dean took a deep breath and shut his eyes, praying in his mind, telling Lucifer they needed him to come.
He gently reached his face, stretching it and feeling it. It lacked a wrinkle or two, and some unkempt facial hair was now back to being mostly shaven. He both desperately needed and morosely feared a mirror at the current moment.
"No!" This time Raphael did stop to turn and face her, Dean moving slightly out of the way. "I tried to save him. He had been searching for the Colt for years, and he arrived at my collection here four years ago, right after God released Purgatory. He had… bad timing, and it got him killed."
Lucifer noticed this every single day. Sure, Dean didn't really break character every day, some days he was genuinely happy, and others he was able to wear that genuine-happiness mask around everyone without wavering, but Lucifer knew the truth.
"What do you mean?"
Dean's blood chilled. A car accident sounded like just that, an accident, but there were too many factors involved in his own disappearance for him to believe that was true. He suspected that Chuck might find a way to hurt Max, and suddenly Max gets into a car accident? That couldn't be a coincidence.
"I've never heard of a way of locking him up. Obviously, I want to, but it's never been a possibility before," Lucifer said quietly.
"It's incredible, Kev." Dean gave him a reassuring pat on the back.
The archangel hesitated. "It's been three years." He waited in case Dean would interrupt him or tell him not to go there, but the hunter simply continued staring up at the stars above them. "Do you… do you resent us?"
Dean nodded stoically toward her, unable to read what the switch in her tone indicated. "Yes, so now we have a solid plan to get me out of your hair for good."
The words came out of Chuck's mouth so nonchalantly. Like what he was saying made sense and could have even been predictable. This was in no way predictable; there had never been a moment where Dean had predicted this.
Raphael and Lucifer stood across from each other, neither making a single move for a long time.
She nodded solemnly. "I should have expected such. That ugly bitch dethroned me! With Chuck and that bloody archangel lance on her side, those spineless gits left me in a second! Except for my prized boys," she cooed at the demons standing around Dean and Kevin.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Please, I don't know how he reacted when you first saw him, but when I came in, he stared at me like he saw a ghost. That doesn't scream 'fine'." Sam leaned across the table. "Tell me, Cas, I wasn't there, but how normally did Dean greet you today?"
Max apologized, said he found something weird in the farmer's shed and told him what he did. The farmer was incredibly apologetic, horrified by his actions.
Unbelievable. Dean spun around and grabbed the end of the gun, smacking it to the ground. "Seriously, Jody? What the hell was that for?"
"I think it does!"
“No… no, this can’t… no,” Ruth continued her rambling. Chuck was completely speechless, staring at himself in abject horror. Ruth ran to Dean and ripped the box from his hands, trying to pry it open. Sam and Cas knew firsthand that it was futile. “Come on… dammit!” Ruth tossed the box across the room and into the wall, earning a loud crash but no damage to the box.
Lucifer smiled at him. "No, but that doesn't really matter, does it?"
He felt another hand just above where his knee sat on the ground and looked up from the fixed point on the floor he had settled his vision on to meet Kevin, the third figure to reach the floor with him.
“Chuck,” the man said with a grin, and now the Mills finally understood Lucifer’s fear and apprehension.
Forgetting about Mia, Dean strode past Sam and Cas and wrapped Jody in a tight hug. It was less suspicious than when he hugged Sam and Cas the other day because he usually hugged Jody when he saw her, but he was squeezing extra tight.
He was well aware of exactly how much worse it had gotten over the six years; it was like one giant downhill slide.
Chuck did all he could not to roll his eyes, something that didn’t shock Dean at all. “Do your job, Ruth, and then maybe I’ll send you home.” Chuck sent Lucifer a smug glare that made Dean's blood boil. Chuck was powerless, so where did he get off being as cocky as he was? That son of a bitch didn't stand a chance against any damn angel in this room, hell, Cas could probably take him in this state.
“Sure, I just missed you,” Sam snarked, and then paused. “And the, um… Garth didn’t need my help, after all.”
He hadn’t known what to say. His face felt hot, flushed from the alcohol he had chugged, and all at once it seemed to settle over him, making him feel loose and calm.
“Another -?” Cas started, and then sighed. “I suppose it’s in the same excellent condition as the ones here?”
“You mean other than four dead bodies? No, no strange activity –“ Paxton paused. “Wait, does strange weather count?”
With one last, deep breath, he opened the door and stepped out of the bathroom. Steam followed him out, momentarily cloaking him in a blanket of warmth, but it soon dissipated as he wandered further out into the dark bedroom.

for them – fought with them, again and again – and he’d even moved into the bunker when Dean had asked. Confusing feelings aside, Cas was the best friend Dean had ever had – the only friend, if he really thought about it – and the idea of losing him to some faceless hunk was a little more than Dean thought he could bear.
was still here, he was giving away his position, his only element of surprise –
“You want to scatter the balls quickly,” he murmured, lining the cue up. “It, um, it makes it easier if they’re not all clumped together.”
He was still wearing the same clothes, Dean realised immediately. It didn’t mean anything, of course, but it seemed to ease something dark and boiling inside him a little, because surely that meant for certain that he and Cas hadn’t…? He found he couldn’t really finish that thought.
“Garth asked for me personally,” Sam cut him off again, not unkindly, and Dean had to force himself not to curse. “Something about needing someone tall –“
The first thing he noticed was the bloody handprint, perfectly formed against the aged wooden surface. Dean knew that handprint, he realised with a sickening jolt, because the same one had been seared onto his arm as he’d been pulled from hell. He’d know Cas’s handprint anywhere, and seeing it in blood made his chest constrict painfully. Had he been pressing his hand to a wound? It appeared, from the scuff marks on the floor, like the table had been disturbed; had Cas been pushed against the surface? Had he had to throw his hands out to catch himself?
“You aren’t going to eat your pancakes?” Cas asked.
He was about to give up, at least for the moment, when the call finally connected.
Instead, he swallowed a lump that was threatening to form in his throat, and asked, “What time is it?”
Dean panics, Cas has a rough time, and shit really hits the fan.
“No, that’s – I’m okay, Cas, I just… I think I’m having a panic attack.”
Cas wasn’t angry, Dean noted distantly, only tired. Resigned. His expression, a tangle of defiance and hurt, made something in Dean’s chest twist painfully. The problem was that he didn’t
“I’ll see what I can find at the morgue,” Cas decided with a bob of his head.

“I think it might be a case,” he told him by way of explanation, sliding into the seat opposite. “Hikers have been washing up on a riverbank next to the Red Bluff Campground over in the Mark Twain National Forest.”
“You okay down there?” Paxton’s voice drifted down to him, and he clambered to his feet, rotating his arm out to alleviate some of the pain.
Dean let himself be led through the semi-circle of onlookers and stopped short at the sight that met him at the bank of the river. The sheriff and a park ranger were crouched, heads tucked close together, over a body. Or, Dean thought distantly, what was
Cas grimaced, and despite everything, Dean found himself chuckling under his breath.
St. James, Missouri was a last-ditch effort at civilisation before the road hit miles and miles of national park. A spattering of houses nestled firmly into the grassy landscape, sliced in two by a withered high-street with a gas station at each end. It boasted a winery and golf course, obviously to lure nature tourists into using the town as a base, but as they drove down the high-street, the place seemed pretty empty in the dying light.
wasn’t worth the pain that was weighing Cas’s shoulders down, the sadness that made his lip tremble.
And yet… Dean’s stomach had other ideas. It grumbled loudly between them, reminding him once again of how hungry he was. He felt his cheeks heating up a little when Cas stared at him, and shrugged.

All he knew was, when the screaming gurgled to an anguished stop, all human pretence had gone from the creature’s frame. As the Impundulu rose up to its full height – inky black wings stretching the full length of the room – Dean knew they were very,
The bluffs loomed ahead, rusty and imposing, and Dean stared up at them for a moment, awed. A bird cawed somewhere ahead, out of sight, and he felt suddenly very connected to everything around him, and ridiculously small.

“Hey, Paxton?” he called, glancing up only momentarily. “You got a flashlight?”

to him about it, because that would mean admitting he had had the tab open near constantly since he had found the damn thing, and had therefore noticed when it had been taken down. It wasn’t like he was even
“You – I don’t –“ Dean couldn’t seem to form sentences.
They both knew Dean couldn’t do that, but he’d appreciated the sentiment all the same. With the ice broken, they had spent the remaining drive chatting amicably, Dean interested to know what cars Bobby would be working on in the ‘shop that day, and by the time the conversation came to a natural end, they’d been sat out front of the school for close to fifteen minutes.
As he continued to eat, the bar around them began to fill. It was obviously letting out time, because a lot of the patrons still had work uniforms on as they sauntered through the doors – store workers and labourers, and a lot in between. By the time Dean had mopped the last bit of sauce up off his plate with an onion ring – which he had put a huge dent in, too – the place was buzzing with conversation and laughter. It didn’t seem like quite so much of a dive now it was so full of life.
“They were in the kitchen one morning,” Sam replied with a shrug that was entirely too nonchalant for the
section of the library, and… I think you’re dealing with an Impundulu.”
“I don't know if they will work,” Cas murmured as Dean showed him a half empty bottle of aspirin. “I am still an Angel –“
“If none of that works,
And… Dean had a boner.
“That is odd,” Cas agreed quietly. “And they’re all appearing in the same place?”
frowned upon?”
“In-app messaging system?” Dean almost didn’t ask.
“Other things?” Dean asked, daring another glance at Cas; he appeared deep in thought.
“Not the house, exactly,” Cas admitted, but his expression was one of grim satisfaction when he pulled up the last article. “This one is dated only a couple of weeks ago. Laura Danes was drunk driving when she lost control of her vehicle and crashed through the local cemetery. As well as being charged with a DUI, she was also charged with property damage when her car destroyed a number of graves – one of which belonged to a Miss Gloria Brown, who –“

“We don’t have time for this, so I’ll make it quick,” Sam sighed. “One, you’re my brother and I love you. Two, Cas is my brother and I love him. Three, you’re both
about that night for over twenty years, but as he pulled back into the motel parking lot that afternoon with Cas in the seat beside him – the seat he had been sat in that night, as John had screamed at him – he couldn’t seem to
“I…” Dean glanced over at them, finding his appetite had very much disappeared. “I’m not hungry.”
“I am able to heal any infections I might catch,” Cas hummed, and Dean very nearly choked on his own spit. “Unless there is a chance of pregnancy, I usually leave the decision to my partner.”
, with other people made him want to scream – because Cas wasn’t
He felt ill. As quickly as he could, he pulled his underwear and pants back up, ignoring the stickiness and the way it made his gut clench, and reached for the trackpad to click away, erase all evidence of what he had done, and then possibly throw the whole laptop onto the nearest freeway.

They had vaguely introduced the idea of condoms and birth control after the mishap with April and Cas’s angel blade comment, but hadn’t gone any further than to slap a box of condoms in front of him and point him in the direction of a sex ed website. Dean hadn’t been able to stomach the idea of having The Talk with Cas then, and he was certain he still wasn’t ready to have it now, either.
“Holy crap,” Paxton whispered, more to herself than, Dean thought, to him. After a moment of simply staring, her brow began to furrow. “Wait, is it… tingling?”
The next day, even as Bobby had pleaded with John to let them stay, they had loaded up the car with their meagre belongings and been on their way without so much as a goodbye. Bobby and John hadn’t spoken for a long time after that, and Dean had certainly never seen any of his friends again.
he couldn’t read his thoughts – only his prayers.
“You okay?” he asked automatically. “Did I hurt you -?”
“Fine,” Dean snapped, and then rubbed a hand over his eyes when the kid physically jumped. “Sorry. I guess we’ll take a king.”
, he thought to himself, silently clambering into his own bed.
“It’s not much further,” Paxton promised, guiding him down a track that began to lead them away from the creek and deeper into the trees. “You’ll know it when you see it.”
Dean nodded again, already moving in the direction Paxton was pointing. Just as she had said, a little further up the path he found more trees with similar scorch marks to the one that had fallen, and a little further still he came across an outcrop of huge rocks half-buried amongst the trees. He could hear Paxton shuffling around behind him, but paid her no mind as he approached the rocks. Here, too, there were obvious signs that lightning had struck, and he ran his hand over the surface of the nearest stone, turned black from damage.
“You have the address for the motel, right?” he asked his phone, propped against his thigh.
, was Dean gone over him.
Cas made his next shot, and didn’t mention the fact that Dean had been waxing poetic about him, so he forced himself to relax again. He could still feel the guy watching Cas, his presence like a beacon in the din of the bar, and found he didn’t really like the feeling one bit.
“Like pins and needles, right?”
“Be careful, Dean.”
Apologies for no update on Friday - real life shit got in the way. Hope this 6.2k doozy makes up for it :D

“Dean,” Castiel insisted, grabbing Dean’s hand before he could get too far away.
. His dark hair was rumpled in almost the same way, and his frame was identical (though Dean had
thinking about the fact that Cas was making hook-up house calls now. Dean hadn’t exactly kept track of Cas’s comings and goings, just sped through their security footage in search of unfamiliar faces. Had he completely missed the fact that Cas had been leaving the bunker and not arriving back until morning? Had he been doing that while he’d also been bringing people back home, or was it a new thing?
“Found a cavern,” he called back up the tunnel. “Looks like it goes deeper than we thought.”
him – with such unwavering focus that he had to look away again, just for a second, lest he did something stupid like start crying.
He forced himself to take another couple of deep breaths, pressing his hand to his chest in the hope of alleviating some of the ache that was building there. It didn’t work, but he felt a little more grounded as he continued to breathe.
No, not empty – everything was still in its place – but the room was definitely void of any other living creatures. The only evidence that the space had been touched at all since he’d last been there were a number of lit candles that had been placed on the bench against the back wall. Stepping down from the last, shadowy stair, Dean moved silently across the room to the workstation. He felt the heat of the candles wash across his face the closer he got, head ducking down as he tried to remember what he had found there before. Whatever it had been, he knew it wasn’t what was sitting there now.
Dean shook the ranger’s hand, nodded his head in greeting, and pulled his badge from his pocket again. “Dean Morello, FBI. You want to tell me what the hell is going on here?”
could feel the bad vibes – he was surprised Cas hadn’t popped a nosebleed or something.
“Dean? Are you okay? I don’t understand what’s so funny –“
There was a bar on the edge of town with a parking lot where they left Baby. The sun was beginning to disappear beyond the horizon as they set off towards the house, and Dean realised, with a pang, that he hadn’t eaten anything all day. His stomach growled in frustration, but he ignored it – there’d be time for food later.

It was a goddamn
And, of course, because Dean’s life was just awful, that was the exact moment their waitress appeared with Dean’s stack of pancakes. She stared at them for a moment, plate half outstretched, whatever pleasantries that had been almost out of her mouth caught in her throat.
Only, that hadn’t been what he’d meant to say
“Does the permission count if I texted it to him?” Cas asked, effectively cutting off every train of thought Dean had ever had.
. That doesn’t answer my question, Dean!”
He had never really worried about Sam because he always kept tabs on him, and he knew that he hadn’t been seriously hurt before they’d even set foot back in the car. Castiel, however, had taken a beating, and angel or not, he had been suspiciously quiet the whole way back to the motel. Sam had sensed it as well, he thought – it’s why he’d made himself scarce.
Holy shit.
“People?”

“You weren’t
“I’m not… angry,” Dean disagreed, though it sounded weak even in his own ears. “I just… up until an hour ago I didn’t think you had sex
“You think I didn’t jump in the car the second I got off the phone with you last time?” Sam asked, and now he was actually paying attention, Dean realised he could hear the sound of an engine in the background.
“Yeah,” Dean agreed, because he knew all too well how good the stuff was. “These are gonna need stitches, I think. I’ll let this stuff do its thing – patch your side up first – and then I’ll come back to it, okay?”
And just like that, Cas hung up on him. It was a relief, honestly, because Dean knew from experience that he would have kept rambling until he physically couldn’t speak anymore, digging himself deeper and deeper into a hole that he was already struggling to pull himself out of.
He had meant it to sound reassuring – to make Cas feel better about whatever it was that seemed to be bothering him so deeply about this. When he finally chanced a glance across the car, however, he realised that he must have made a terrible mistake. Cas’s eyes, usually the warmest blue, were icy as he stared to the road ahead. His jaw was clenched tightly, as though he was afraid of what might come out of his mouth if he wasn’t careful.
He had
The drive was pretty uneventful, up until them having to stop for gas. In an attempt to settle things once and for all between them, Dean had let Cas play his dumb pop music for a couple of hours; Cas’s smile more than made up for Beyonce tainting Baby’s stereo system, and though he tried to stifle it in the ten and two position on the wheel, even Dean found himself tapping along to the beat before too long. If Cas smiled a little brighter when he did it, well… Dean just pretended he hadn’t noticed.
But that was just how
He was
Dean hummed. “The record tell you how she died?”
Cas rolled his eyes, but his smile, Dean hoped, was fond as he swivelled on his feet and disappeared through the door. Dean stayed silent, watching the space he had filled, brain a jumble of completely intangible thoughts.
“Which is in…?”
Sometimes, it was hard to imagine any part of his life he did have control of.
“Where’s Cas?” Sam asked instead, because he was an asshole. “Did you talk to him -?”
Slipping the vial into his breast pocket so he could feel the gentle hum against his chest, he steeled himself once more. A last glance around the room offered no more clues, but he still wasn’t certain his spotty knowledge of spells would have helped even if a clue had smacked him directly in the face, so he had to stow his dumb ass and push forward.
. “I think the worst has passed. Yeah, I’m good. I’m gonna come get you, okay?”

“A demon ward,” Cas provided quietly. “Whatever’s in there, she wanted it protected.”
“Well,” Castiel frowned. “Once the…
Dean sighed and ran a hand through his already sleep-crumpled hair. Sam was right, though he was loath to admit it. He couldn’t keep up as he was, pushing Cas away because of his own insecurities. He was a grown man – he was capable of pretending he hadn’t repeatedly jerked off to his best friend’s sex tape without his permission, even if it killed him.
Fully prepared for that to be the end of the conversation, he reached out and started the car. She purred to life around them, and Dean felt immediately soothed by the gentle rumble. Beside him, Cas sat silently, and when Dean dared a glance before he pulled away, his expression was hard to read.
“Sure,” he’d agreed, realising that he was smiling, too. “But only if there’s popcorn.”
? What if he decided to move out, to shack up with this guy that Dean had never met, knew nothing about –
Castiel’s shoulder. Cas, to his credit, just stared forlornly at him as he pushed himself off the bed and back down to his knees. His side wouldn’t need stitches, he decided swiftly; the wound wasn’t wide enough to warrant them, and was already beginning to clot. Instead, Dean forced the last of the gel out onto his fingers and repeated his movements from moments ago, tenderly massaging the medicine around the worst of the redness and infection. Cas sighed beneath his touch, a tired, grateful thing, and Dean tried not to think about what it meant too much. He was obviously just glad for the relief – that was all.
“Kick its ass, kid,” Bobby replied.
“What?” Dean almost gagged on his sip of beer. “Sam, no, I – I’ll go help Garth and you and Cas can –“
, by any standards. It stung a little that it was even being implied. He was
And ring.
“Right,” Bobby had nodded, a smile ticking up the corners of his mouth. “That work in the ‘shop will keep.”
Before Castiel could say anything else, he pushed himself up and out of his caring grip. He still had to stitch his back, and then he was going to lock himself in the bathroom for a

“No wonder his gym bag smells like wet dog,” Drew had huffed, making Lilah laugh all the harder.
Already moving towards the side door, Dean pulled his phone out of his pocket and fired a quick message off to Cas.
“Yep,” Dean nodded, though he knew she couldn’t see him. With a final glance around the cave, he secured his hold on the egg and headed back for the tunnel. “I’m coming back out – I’ll show you.”
Perfect.
When Dean thought about Cas, his chest ached. He missed him like a limb, like he was an extension of himself, of Sam, of their little family, and when they were together the grand vastness that was life never felt quite as daunting. Cas was like the sun in that respect, drawing Dean into his orbit and anchoring him within reality. Of course, he was also the single most infuriating being Dean had ever encountered in his life, but even that seemed to somehow fade into the background under the warming beams of Castiel’s light.
Cas startled, but his smile was soft as he turned to Dean. “It’s almost five. Are you feeling better?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. Ever since their conversation in the car, Cas had been suspiciously quiet, and when Dean stopped to really look at him, he realised the angel looked about as exhausted as Dean felt. There was a weary slope to his shoulders, and the bags under his eyes were more pronounced than usual. Though he knew better, it was still sometimes hard for Dean to think of Cas as anything other than invincible, but now? The guy looked around ten seconds from passing out.
Dean has a well-deserved nap, Cas is a researching genius, and a startling discovery is made.
And Dean hadn’t known if it was the sheer surrealness of the situation, or the alcohol in his gut, or the soothing warmth radiating from Drew beside him, but before he’d really thought about it, he’d chugged his drink and exclaimed, emboldened, “Dare.”
“I think…” he started, and even his voice sounded more even –
, because it wouldn’t do Cas any good if he went barging in with no plan or weapons.
It was the girl who spotted him first; her eyes widened, and she withdrew her hand quickly as Dean stormed towards them. Cas cocked his head to the side, turned away from the counter to see what had spooked her, and had the audacity to
“He’s definitely picturing it,” Sam snorted, and Dean kicked him under the table.

Around them, the early morning rush continued to flurry through the diner. Dean stared at his mug of coffee, letting the ambient noise wash over him as he only half listened to whatever it was that Cas was talking about.
“Yeah, I bet she did,” Dean muttered under his breath. Then, louder, “Alright, Casanova, you done here?”
“Drink,” he repeated, and Castiel did as he was told, popping the pills into his mouth and chugging the water afterwards.
Dean was supposed to argue. He was supposed to force himself up, to keep going, so they could get this damned case figured out and he could get some breathing room from Cas before he went and did something idiotic like kiss his stupid, beautiful face. He was supposed to ignore how tired he was, how holding himself together was draining him, and act like everything was okay.
“Okay,” Castiel agreed.
before. Bobby had also, after taking a long look at them both, bought them each a pair of sturdy boots, as well as a handful of new t-shirts and pants. Sammy, after years of Dean’s hand-me-downs, had even gotten a couple multi-packs of new underwear and socks. It was the most money anyone had ever spent on them, and Dean had tried to decline, but Bobby had been insistent. Plus, Sammy hadn’t stopped smiling as he’d paraded around the store in his boots, which he had refused to take off; Dean didn’t want to be the reason that smile disappeared.
was an infinitely more accurate description.
They’d all burst into laughter while Emmie spluttered around her drink, cheeks visibly heating as she attempted to come up with an answer. Dean had known it was futile – she’d told him herself about her crush while they’d been studying in the library one afternoon during a free period – and when he’d glanced at her, he could tell she knew there was no getting out of it.
Dean just didn’t think about it – any of it. Whenever a stray thought popped into his head, mainly consisting of Castiel’s smooth skin or husky, sex-addled voice, he immediately shut it down and stuffed it into a little box in the back of his brain. It wasn’t one of his healthiest coping mechanisms, he knew, but definitely the most effective.
He was

He lined his shot up, not aiming for potting anything so much as just getting himself out of the situation Cas had unwittingly put him in, and managed to successfully chip the ball straight over Cas’s and into his own. If Cas made a small noise of surprise, well… Dean had already decided he wasn’t showing off.
. That was… Dean’s heart really needed to give him a break.
Only as he said it did Dean glance away from his face and begin to realise just how much trouble they were in. He had seen the blood, of course, but he hadn’t really
“Even the lightning,” Paxton kept going. “I know it has to hit somewhere, right – like,
“Don’t know,” Cas managed, eyes scrunching closed again in agony. “It – my angel blade –“
He’d be shy, he reasoned, hand inching faster on his dick. Unpractised. A little nervous, maybe, but very enthusiastic. Guy was practically a virgin – Dean imagined his face would flush crimson just from a tongue in his mouth, blue eyes wide and breath heavy, and Dean would make it so,
“Okay, junk doesn’t matter, gotcha,” Dean cut him off, voice little more than a squeak, and Castiel frowned.
“Well, that’s when the trouble really starts,” Sam murmured. “When its tied to a witch, she has control. There aren’t many first-hand accounts, but most of the lore seems to suggest that, if the witch is benevolent, the Impundulu would be, too. They don’t have to kill – they can survive on cow’s milk and still retain all their power.”
“Yeah,” he’d replied, already preparing to build his walls back up.
Funny, how a single word had the ability to momentarily shut down every possible argument Dean could think of. He forced himself to keep his eyes on the road, even as he spluttered for an answer.
“I’ve
A few feet down the track they were met with an incline, and Dean was man enough to accept Paxton’s hand when she held it out to pull him up the slope. The path was a little muddy from heavy use, and his shoes were already ruined – he didn’t want to add a dirty monkey suit to it when he invariably ended up on his ass.
“Boo,” Drew grinned, and placed the boombox – playing a song Dean had never heard before, because it wasn’t classic rock – on the floor beside them. Then, instead of finding his own seat, he’d unceremoniously wedged himself into the same seat as Dean, plastering himself along Dean’s side.
He was right, but it was still a lead, and Dean refused to let anything deter him now they finally seemed to be getting somewhere.
Dean swallowed a sharp intake of breath, glad that Cas couldn’t see the way that his cheeks were heating up. He had to clear his throat to steady his voice before replying, “You, um… you’re with company. I didn’t – sorry, I can call you back –“
In his mind, Dean knew what he was doing as he spread Cas out on his bed, naked and wanting. There was no shame; no panic as he kissed him, and no regrets as they rocked together. Cas deserved it slow, deliberate, each thrust of Dean’s cock inside him a searing reminder of exactly who was pleasuring him. He’d make sure Cas came first, watch intently from above as he fell apart around him, and only then would he take his own pleasure, wrapped in Cas’s arms, heads pressed together, sharing the same air.
“Like lightning tickling my skin.”
There weren’t any more witnesses at the campsite. Even the boys who had found the body had nothing else to add, and Dean got the distinct impression that their mother was about to rip his head off if he didn’t back off, so he didn’t push for more information.
There was also a sizeable hickey just under Cas’s ear, Dean realised with mounting horror, in the juncture where his neck met his jaw. It was all Dean could do not to imagine the scenario where that had occurred, and Cas’s state of mind thereafter, not to heal it.
Settling onto his bed, he paused for a moment before hitting the play button. This wasn’t the first time he had found porn actors who looked like Cas, but it always caused a little bubble of unease to form in his throat regardless. Watching strangers going at it was one thing, but watching strangers that looked like people he cared about? That was a whole other kettle of fish.
Was he a bad person if a small part of him – just a tiny, little bit – wanted Cas to crash and burn, if only so Dean could be his shoulder to cry on?
It had been fine – nice, even – until Cas had woken up, pulling Dean from his floaty place of half-sleep with him. He’d immediately frozen, body thrumming with tension against Dean’s own, and it was only as he’d rolled quickly away that Dean had realised the thing poking his thigh
Dean, to his credit, was too tired to do anything but let it happen. Cas was incredibly strong, and had him tucked under the itchy blankets in no time, like he weighed next to nothing at all. It was better than being out in the open, Dean decided, instead of letting himself get fixated on Cas’s strength; the springs were more irritating, but a lot of that was negated by how warm and loose he felt, cocooned.
After another moment of wide-eyed staring, the girl leaned right back, clicked her tongue, and began to ring up their items. While she did so, Cas turned to Dean with a frown, though he thankfully didn’t say anything.
“Hey, you see where my buddy went?” he called over to the barman, gesturing to the seats they had been sat in. “Little shorter than me, dark hair, trench coat? He was… talking to another guy.”
That wasn’t Cas’s voice. Dean felt his stomach drop out of his ass, and he staggered a little bit on the spot, because that
It was pretty bad. His shirt, which was usually pristinely white, was wet with blood, stained from Cas’s armpit right down to his belt. Dean hissed with sympathy, and was grateful when Cas at least didn’t fight him as he began to unbutton his shirt. In any other moment, he might have been embarrassed, undressing his friend like this. His fingers shook a little as he pulled each button free, but that was just adrenaline wearing off, and maybe a little bit of fear. There was no room for embarrassment here – Cas needed him, and that was all that mattered.
It was lonely.
Dean’s breath caught in his throat. Cas continued to stare at him –
Had he even been in his right mind?
had no issues with it, and he felt slightly ill at the thought of any random perv getting their rocks off to Cas’s face, his mouth, his ass, his cock.
They fell back into an easy rhythm, Dean forcing their almost-kiss and not-quite-moment to the back of his mind with all the other traitorous thoughts, and he found himself relaxing again. He liked spending time with Cas – there had to be a reason why his feelings had developed, after all. Cas had a quiet solidity that was grounding like little else in Dean’s life was. He was funny, despite what the other angels often said about him, and intelligent in a completely different way to Sam. He was easy to get along with, rolling with the punches of their crazy lives almost as easy as breathing –
“Holy
“Yeah, this is quite recent,” he hummed, ignoring Dean completely as he slumped into a chair across the table. “Thought I recognised that guy.”
“Hey, asshole!” he screamed, hoping to coax the thing away. He was breathless, exhausted, but it didn’t stop him from pulling the machete out from the back of his pants. “Fuck you!”
He set it against a nearby wall, not even short of breath as he lifted it with ease, and then levelled a gaze at Dean that seemed to ask
. Basically, it turns into a hot dude and charms you away so it can kill you and drain your blood.”
Dean didn’t push for further words – didn’t really want to talk about it – so he rummaged back in the first aid kit to give his shaking hands something to do. He found what he was looking for quickly, and felt a mighty side better when he realised there was still some left.
for cuddling.
“Can I get a room?” he asked. “Two twins.”
And, just like that, they’d fallen back into the somewhat-routine that was staying at Bobby’s house. That night they’d eaten pizza, and Sammy had watched cartoons on Bobby’s beaten-up tv, and then Bobby had forced them both to bed at a reasonable hour. In the morning, Dean had made breakfast while Bobby called to enrol them in the local school system; it was close enough to the start of the year that they hadn’t missed too much, but not close enough for them not to stand out as new kids – but that was the story of their lives, Dean had supposed.
“Rest,” Cas murmured, hand a soothing anchor in Dean’s hair. “You’re exhausted. I can continue our research for a few hours while you sleep.”

Because yes,

“The waitress seemed uncomfortable,” Cas noticed unnecessarily. “Is defecation during intercourse frowned upon?”
“Great, thanks,” Dean replied. “And in the meantime, I guess I’ll sweep the area, see if there’s anything hanging around that the locals might have missed.”
Whoever Gloria Brown had been, she was clearly wrapped up in some
“Are there any points of interest in the local area?” he asked Paxton once he had re-joined the crime scene.
Dean was definitely having a stroke. He had to be – there was no way he had just heard those words coming out of Cas’s mouth. Castiel, Angel of the Lord,
“I didn’t – we didn’t,” he gasped, shaking his head even as Dean moved closer to softly wrap him in his arms. “I don’t
“Catching on the embankment as they float downriver?”
“You should have said something sooner,” he huffed, already peeling Castiel’s trench-coat and jacket away from his injured side.
Dean frowned and flicked carefully through his phone – now he was out of the forest, he saw he had three missed calls.
– that was the real question, wasn’t it?
It wasn’t any lewder than the other videos he’d scrolled past. If anything, the angle – blown wide and to the side – made it less so. Peering closer, Dean squinted to take in every aspect of the photo. The Bottom was tanned, as they usually were, with sun-kissed hair and dark eyes. His hands gripped the bed sheets tightly, head thrown back in obvious pleasure while the Top’s face was obscured, buried between ample cheeks. From the side, it kind of looked like – but no, that wasn’t possible.
“I agree,” Cas replied. “I’ll see if I can find any more information in these reports and call you back.”
The blood-curdling, inhuman scream that ripped itself from the creature’s throat was unlike anything Dean had ever heard before – and he’d had some pretty bad reactions to his jokes. Grimacing, ears throbbing, he staggered to his feet, going straight for Cas, only to be thrown backwards again when the creature threw out a hand – no, a
He couldn’t ignore the fluttering in his chest that stopped him from opening the bathroom door, though, and had to take a moment, eyes closed, to remind himself how to breathe.
Dean wasn’t like that. He was all clumsy action and stunted thoughts. Words often clogged in his mouth, which made him feel stupid, which made him feel angry, and the whole process looped and looped until he had to kill something to quieten the screaming in his head. Emotion was even harder to comprehend; it was easier to avoid feelings as much as he could, and where he couldn’t, he was infinitely better at showing rather than telling. Cas knew that about him – he had to, because Dean didn’t know where to even
His junk making his mind up for him, he threw caution to the wind and hit the play button anyway. It immediately felt more amateur than any of the stuff he usually perused; he felt a little weird that the people could be
Because the longer the whole thing dragged out, the more of a scam it had seemed – only, Dean was fairly certain he was the only one who had been able to see it. Sammy had settled into normal life with frightening competence, and Dean had dreaded having to remind him that none of it was permanent – so he hadn’t. He’d let the charade carry on for a while longer, but in doing so had managed to inadvertently distance himself from the only people he logically knew he could count on. Bobby had noticed, he was sure, though he hadn’t said anything about it.
His voice cracked – actually
“Fire,” Sam replied immediately. “Or poisoned milk.”
“You’re a good friend, Dean,” he told him sincerely, and Dean had to swallow the bile that was quickly rising in his throat.
Dean bobbed his head again, eyes drifting back to the body. He didn’t know why, but something didn’t seem right – less right than the glaringly obvious. “No signs of struggle?”
And there was a guy coyly watching him from across the bar.
“Realising that your little inscriptions can’t save you from all of my tricks?” the creature rumbled, deep in his chest.
“Goodbye, Dean.”
Only, distancing himself seemed to put Cas on edge, which he hated almost as much as Sam’s baleful expression. He spoke to Dean with increasing snippiness, and made a show of leaving a room whenever Dean entered it; his hurt gaze bore into Dean’s back, though Dean refused to reach out and sooth him like he might have done before this whole mess. They didn’t really touch at all, anymore, and Dean was quick to pull away if they did, lest Cas realise that the shame over what he had done was etched into every fibre of his being.
"Also, I'm not going to tell them about the last six years."
“Okay, we’re here,” Lucifer said with annoyance after Chuck was finally satisfied with where they ended up. Luc flew him to over a hundred locations on earth in the last hour before he was happy. Now they were on a bench, sitting and watching a playground. It was dark, the middle of the night, and empty. Incredibly unsettling.
Dean and Lucifer were lying side by side, staring up at the stars between the trees and listening to the familiar arguing of Kevin and Mia a few feet away.
"I'm with Dean," Mia chimed in. "Fruit was on the table. The blood was just a bonus, and locking up God seems a bit… unreachable."
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean wiped the tears out of his eyes and brushed off his clothes, clearing his throat and trying to re-ground himself. "Sorry, it's just…"
"The problem was, last time the calm was two years of peace," Dean reminded him.
"I feel so guilty," Jody admitted as Sam joined them. "I wish I could have done something different, she reminds me so much of Claire and Alex."
Cas sent him a sympathetic smile. "Fortunately, I got something from Mia last night," he admitted, having decided not to mention his late-night rendezvous with an angel he previously assumed was dead.
“You had no -!” Dean spluttered, head snapping back up. “You were happy for him to –?”
“I know that, Dean,” Cas replied with a roll of his eyes, though he only paused with his attention on the message for a single moment before he tucked the phone away in his pocket without replying.
Maybe working a case, just the two of them, would be good for them.
The table was electronic, and only released the balls once Dean had fished around in his pocket and stuffed a couple of quarters into a slot on the side. Cas watched him quietly, cue held by his side, with an indulgent smile on his face.
Dean had already grabbed the left leg, gently shifting it each way to get a look from all angles. It felt like an empty plastic bag in his hands. “Puncture marks.”
“Thank God no-one was out here when it fell,” Paxton sighed, coming up behind him. “Would have been more than four bodies to contend with if there had been. Lucky enough that nothing has set on fire yet.”
“Um…”
“So?”
“I don’t… I think so?” Davis shrugged helplessly. “I’m sorry, it’s been a crazy couple of weeks – I didn’t notice.”
Cas, thankfully, followed, but he was still frowning by the time they were back on the road. He had the extraordinary ability of being able to turn a frown into a living, breathing thing, and within ten minutes of setting off it felt like something dark and heavy was crawling down Dean’s throat.
The body had been moved into the back of an ambulance in his absence, and the forensic tent had been erected in its place. Campers were beginning to gather by the police tape, quite possibly alerted to what had happened by Dean’s sniffing around. He refused to feel bad about that – it wasn’t his job to wrangle nosy civilians away from crime scenes.
weird.
“According to Sammy’s research,” Dean nodded. “There’s a bend in the creek just north of the campground – seems like they’re all washing up there.”
Dean’s legs very nearly gave out. He managed to throw the hand that had been on his dick out to steady himself, otherwise he would have smacked his head on the shower wall. His chest was still heaving, ass clenching now-painfully around the fingers that had stilled inside. He withdrew them, slowly, and grimaced at the emptiness that was left behind. For a moment, he waited for the panic to set in, legs still shaking as the water washed away any evidence of what had happened. He’d just fingered his ass while thinking about his best friend – his best friend, who was clearly in
twenty-four hours.
Dean liked it. Liked Drew. He made him feel calm, safe, and not alone. His smile was infectious, his sense of humour wicked, and Dean hadn’t been able to believe his luck, that he could call him his friend. Hell, that he could call
“I can’t wait that long, Sam,” Dean shook his head, feeling a little nauseous at the thought. “I can’t just leave him that long.”
Dean Winchester was a man of many rituals for someone who swore they had so little faith. He always took the bed closest to the door in motel rooms. He always unpacked his clothes and laid the next day’s outfit out, no matter how little time he and Sam spent in any particular place. Every Thursday, no matter where they were or what trouble they were in, he fieldstripped all of his weapons and made the adequate repairs before doing anything else.
Dean stared at the chocolate syrup oozing from his pancakes, and then gingerly pushed the plate away from him. “Please don’t make me have this conversation with you in such a public place.”
. If you’re into the same thing, great! Have at it. If you’re not, you’re allowed to say no – you’re
Dean frowned. “What, like an animal got to them?”
But Dean had to admit, being overly friendly could be a serious one-night-stand faux pas. It depended on the expectations, of course, but he couldn’t imagine anyone who was cruising for a quick fuck on a hook-up app was really interested in anything past a nut-and-duck.
“Yes!” he grinned, and dared a glance at Cas. He, too, was smiling. “See, I potted a striped ball first, which means I have to pot all the striped ones now. That means you’re spots. If I accidentally hit a spotted ball, or you hit a striped one, your opponent gets an extra shot.”
“Do you have panic attacks frequently?”
Someone, or some
No, but seriously, I know I'm an asshole. I'm officially announcing that there probably won't be an official posting schedule from here on out, but that I WILL NOT leave the next chapter as long as I did this time. I'm hoping?? for one chapter a week from here on out, as a general idea.
“So!” he announced after a moment of awkward silence. “Not that I don’t enjoy our little…
Nothing even changed, to begin with, which was the most frustrating part. Dean still woke up at noon every day, thereby missing any chance encounter he might have had should Cas decide to bring anyone else home – which he hadn’t, incidentally. Dean had started paying a little extra attention to the security camera facing Cas’s door as he did their weekly check-throughs – purely for Cas’s safety, of course – and had been strangely pleased to see the corridor had remained empty of strangers ever since he’d found the video.
“It might deter anyone from wandering in until we can decide what to do about the basement,” he shrugged, and Dean nodded.
Dean was searching for more injuries before he could even finish his sentence. The rest of Castiel’s front seemed fine, mostly, if for a couple of bruises under his left pectoral that had to ache; it was when Dean reached out and carefully tugged until Castiel fell into his arms that he realised there were deep puncture holes in his back.
This didn’t mean Cas was dead, he told himself fiercely. It
**TRIGGER WARNINGS**
With a rattling sigh, Castiel rose onto unsteady feet, and only then did Dean realise he was hunched, protecting the right side of his body.
“Clever,” he purred, taking another step further into the room. “Though, I’m sure your angel would have appreciated the same treatment. A pity.”
Tensing automatically, Dean brought his gun back up and edged through into the hall. He made sure to spot every door, every possible place something could attack them from, but found himself relaxing incrementally when he spotted Cas at the end of the hall, past the stairs, obviously unharmed.
“So you’re telling me,” Dean grimaced, and had to rub a hand over his eyes again, “that Gloria Brown was boning some giant vampire bird?”
. His ass clenched sharply again, unexpectedly, around his finger, and he couldn’t help the moan that fell from his lips.
“Yep.”
The following drive to Dean’s new school had started silently, but Bobby, who always seemed to know what Dean was thinking, had eventually murmured, “You just focus on yourself, boy, and let me worry about Sam.”
He’d taken an egg from the cave – hadn’t even thought that maybe it might be missed. He’d taken an egg, and this

There was no lock on the bathroom door, because of course there wasn’t. With a sigh, Dean grabbed a relatively clean towel from a pile on top of the toilet and laid it on the sink, along with his clothes. The water pressure was dogshit, but at least it was warm, and he found himself immediately relaxing as he stepped under the sputtering spray. He spent a few moments just stood there, letting the water dribble over his face and neck, while his mind wandered idly to the case.
“You’re going for number six, right? The green one?” he asked quietly, and Cas nodded his head. “Okay, you wanna look over it to where you want it to go. Middle pocket?”
“Dean,” Cas cut him off, and Dean clapped his mouth shut with a thankful sigh. He held his breath for just a moment, worried that Cas would say something he wouldn’t have a sensible answer to, but after a long moment he just sighed heavily and continued, “So… the case?”
“Yeah, I drove in college, Dean. It’s been like ten years!” he argued, but nevertheless he did so while putting the car into gear. Kevin understood why Dean had put him in the front, he needed to be in the back, making sure Raphael stayed alive, and everyone knew that Kevin was horrible under pressure.
Unbeknownst to her, Mia's moment of complete transparency did accidentally spill something, specifically the fact that she said they'd had this deal for the last six years.
"Oh. I understand that…" but he couldn't finish what he had to say.
Dean cocked his head. "You… don't want to tell people about the angels? Why the hell not?"
Thanks for reading the first chapter! I already have the next couple written so it won't take long to update. Please comment letting me know what you think so far and/or predictions you already have! (The tags and fic summary sort of give things away but the bigger twists of the story won't happen until later of course) thanks so much :)
The words were enough, by some sort of grace. Cas's challenging stare fell, and Sam turned away slightly, satisfied with the conclusion and not really wanting the lengthy explanation because he knew it would just make him feel guilty. It almost made Dean feel worse, they trusted him enough to leave well enough alone, but that was tough because he knew he was lying to them.
Dean raised his eyebrow, aware Max couldn't see him, so it was only for his own benefit. "Odd's the job, Max."
“Well, Kevin it’s-”
“There was a flash drive found at the scene of Dean’s car accident,” Cas explained, just accepting the fact that there were probably a lot of secrets on this thing if Mia stole a picture from Jody and it happened to be something that could be explained by the video. What the hell did that have to do with anything that was currently going on?
But Mia just had to ruin it as she stabbed at her bacon and decided to start talking and ruin Dean's peace. "You know, I was wondering, maybe you guys could take me on a little road trip."
"Dean!" Both Cas and Sam shouted at the same time. Jody had her hand in her pocket, probably having brought a concealed gun.
"Well Mia, I'm sorry to tell you, but that holy water wouldn't have done a thing. She wasn't a demon."
Waiting an awkward moment to put her head back where it needed to be, Ruth charged Luc again, this time with more thought and precision. That may have been the downfall of Dean’s little change of heart, but he needed the focus to be off of him, from all eyes in the room. Specifically Chuck’s.
Lucifer still looked unsure, but he gave in. "Alright, well, at least promise that when you pray to me for a lift home, you'll come to this same spot, not an inch closer, and you'll preface that you guys are fine in your prayers."
"Tell me about that one," he said to Luc, just as he had said it to Cas so many times.
Raphael smiled brightly at the hunter. He had just met these two humans, but he was pretty impressed by both. This was not how he thought his day would go when it started. "That would be perfect. There's just one problem…" his face fell, not wanting to disappoint the new humans. "I don't have the Seal of Solomon. I don't even know where to find it."
With the speed of a trained hunter, which of course he was, he fired off four quick shots in succession, hitting his target each time.
"Forgot what? Me?" This time Dean could hear the unmistakable sob in his voice.
He sighed; he knew he wasn't getting out of this one. "Well, I want to sleep on a mattress. Eat frozen food again. Have access to the internet. Take a shower that's not in an old boy's locker room with ten other dudes." He glanced over at Mia. "But that's the fun stuff, the little perks. You know what it is I really want."
Dean didn't move his arms, a small blessing for Castiel, but his joking nature dissipated.  "Right, yeah, she's not coming back with us. She'll be fine, she's a grown woman, and besides she's already spent plenty of time with us in the bunker, and done me plenty of favors already."
Raphael narrowed his eyes at them. "I know who you are, Dean Winchester, but you are not the you that you're supposed to be. You're from somewhere else, aren't you?"
"Yes, it's interesting, isn't it, the 'paralyzing God' part." A tall woman with black curly hair was standing beside them, having definitely not been there a minute ago.
Chuck raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. “Really now? You think Dean Winchester and your little gaggle of traitors are more important than getting rid of my powers?” When Lucifer didn’t answer, Chuck added, “no, it’s okay. Speak freely.”
Dean had the box, Raphael was apparently with them, and Mia had her father. He didn’t need to worry about Chuck getting his hands on what was most important, so he had nothing to prove.
"You have nothing to apologize for! I just want to know what's wrong." He looked over at his friend with as much sympathy and compassion as he could muster. "I know you loved your brothers, Luc. So why don't you want to see one of them now that you have the chance?"
But Raphael agreed that it was for the best, and it was clear that the newly reunited brothers didn't want to spend the evening apart.
"Fine!" He let out a weighty sigh. "It was conflicting. Seeing them again made me sadder than I expected and happier than I expected. I was so confused, and it didn't feel real. At least not until…" he trailed off as he noted what he was going to say was personal and slightly embarrassing. Mia's smile was growing and growing like the child she was. "Okay!" Dean put his hands up in surrender. "Until I was hugging Cas, is that what you wanted to hear?"
She rolled her eyes. "Yes, impressed. But so is Mia. And she cares about you too much. She wants to have adventures like you've had."
"Did you ever find out what it was?"
Meanwhile, Mia and Kevin had been whispering amongst themselves about a particular something that Dean hadn’t even realized he needed to address now.
Still without a word, Lucifer put his hands over Max's body, and the healing light radiated from them once more. All of the visible injuries on the young man seemed to fade away, and his body eased up, looking more settled and relaxed, though he was still asleep.
“The bodies were all completely drained of blood, Dean.”
“Not… frowned upon,” Dean replied with a sigh, because there was no way this was going to end before Cas got the answers he was looking for, apparently. Best to rip the band-aid off nice and quick. “It’s just… an acquired taste, I guess.”
“Whassis -?” he mumbled, body already tensing as if anticipating an attack, and paused only when he felt a soothing hand rake through his hair.
And so, of course, he had to be an idiot about it.
“Yeah,” Dean nodded. “Hopefully, this will all be over by the time you get here.”
Cas had gotten under the covers, sure, but he was still propped up against the pillows with his phone in his hand. He startled a little at Dean’s voice, cheeks glowing pink under the synthetic light, and glanced away as though he was embarrassed.
“What are you doing?” he asked, voice gravelly.
removed his shoes and outer layers, and Dean stared for a moment at the cute, smiling bumblebees that adorned his socks.

“I was escorted through paediatrics on the way to the morgue,” Cas cut over him immediately, and despite everything, Dean felt himself huff out a shaky laugh.
–“ Dean found himself spluttering, grasping for straws of an argument he didn’t really know how to make, because he didn’t really know what the tight feeling in his chest was supposed to mean.
Another pause, and then, “Did you say

“This is where it was proposed the shopping development would be built,” he explained, and quickly flicked back to the articles. “Now read the address of the graffiti and attempted burglary cases.”
Cas shrugged, but his lips ticked up at the corners as he replied, “This is a small town, Dean. I expect they thought that was rather exciting.”
Idiot,” he sighed, knocking himself on the head with his phone. “Complete

parents I’m at
The handcuffs popped open, and Cas’s arm immediately dropped to his side. Dean spared no time in moving around the bed, having already spotted Cas’s pants draped across a chair in the corner, and was back at his side in a matter of seconds.
“Well, does anyone live in the house now?” he asked instead, but Cas shook his head.
of forgetting how to breathe, after all.
He shifted uncomfortably, torn between the ache between his legs and his moral compass. He remembered, once, that he’d spotted an actor that kinda looked like Sammy – he hadn’t been able to jerk off for a week after that. Why, then, did he not feel the same repulsion when it came to actors who looked like Cas? He’d guiltily jerked off to a couple of lesbians that reminded him of Donna and Jody a couple of times, but at least they were
He threw the blade, as hard and as fast as his shaking hand would allow him, and held his breath as, with a slick, sickening sound, it buried itself deep in the creature’s side. Everything slowed for a moment, as though all the energy in the room had coalesced on that single point of contact between flesh and blade, before the creature slowly turned its head to look.
“Of course not,” Dean replied as he hooked the flamethrower’s leather strap over his shoulder, snagged a machete to stuff into the back of his pants along with his trusty .45, and slammed the trunk closed. “I’m gonna pretend to play nice, get Cas out of there, and
There were no lights on in the house; that, he could be sure of. The thought of Cas, alone and enchanted in the dark, made his stomach twist painfully, and he swallowed back the bile that was threatening to rise in his throat. That thought was enough to spur him into motion, and he moved quickly towards the Impala. It was simple enough to open the trunk one handed, and he immediately started rifling through the various weapons stashed inside with his phone still pressed to his ear.
drive to pass some time, it was to find Dean and Castiel soundly asleep, curled together under the covers of Dean’s bed.
“You think?” Sam replied sarcastically.
There was no food in the cupboards and the fridge was turned off. The lights, when Cas flicked the switch by the door, spluttered for a moment, but eventually came on overhead. A small table with two chairs was tucked into one corner, and Dean idly ran his hand over the wood; it came away completely clean.
It was a lose-lose situation, but if Lucifer could spare anyone in any way, then there really was no real choice to be made, was there?
“His family,” Mia finished with a sigh. Of course, her father would pull the family card, he wouldn’t be much of a father if he didn’t. “So, we’ll do it together?”
She promised if anything went wrong that she would pray to Raphael or Lucifer, and they decided to fly her and her father out to a boat in one of the Great Lakes; that way, they wouldn't have to deal with monsters. Lucifer found a particularly large and fancy boat for the two of them and piloted it out to the middle of the lake so that they wouldn't even have to risk monsters between the land and the boat.
So he fell into another bout of restless sleep, and when he woke, it was light again, which didn't bode well for him, considering Lucifer left at sunset.
Dean walked slowly back into the main room, achingly aware of the lack of Luc's presence on this earth. The room was empty, all except for Castiel who was leaning over the table and drumming his fingers.
"Hey, Cas," Dean said softly, again as to not wake his sleeping brother just as he had on the drive over. The angel turned to him and Dean pointed out the windshield at the most brilliant and vibrant night sky he'd seen in a while. "Tell me about that one," he requested.
When Dean woke up the next morning, he saw that he was curled around his alarm clock, holding it in a death grip. He wondered how the hell that happened but wasn't too surprised. Dean had always been someone who liked to hold onto something while he slept; he just never could have stuffed animals as a child because there was rarely any privacy in a motel room, and he knew his dad would think less of him.
He had no luck in his efforts to find a way home. Lucifer had been very disappointed to tell him that there was no way he could find fruit from the tree of life required for the spell to open the rift. The tree had been destroyed years ago, and if anyone had fruit from it, which he had been sure some did, they went underground when Chuck cracked Purgatory.
"Angels. They came in and killed so many people. Raphael and I managed to kill most of them, but some got away."
(IMPORTANT) also the reason I get new chapters out so quickly is because I've already written WELL ahead of what I post...I have it almost completely finished I just stagger the updates, so if you would like me to post it all at once or even more frequently, like two or three chapters a day, let me know!
Sam was right, unfortunately. Dean didn't reemerge after showing Mia her room; he went into his room and locked the door. He wasn't acting like himself, and it made Cas a bit uncomfortable. It didn't seem right; it seemed so… fake. He had been hoping to get Dean back and have nothing happen to him. He was hoping Dean was going to stroll through the door with his broken leg trailing behind him, telling some long, convoluted story about how he wanted some air and got sidetracked at a bar.
Ruth shook her head at him. "You think you know everything, don't you, Castiel? You are in for a bitter surprise once you realize that you know absolutely nothing."
"Fine!" Dean threw his hands in the air in defeat. "But Mia, you've never met Cas, sure, I've told you detailed stories, but you've never actually met him. So I don't know how you've convinced yourself you have the highest authority on his feelings." God, this was a weird conversation; it just felt strange to have to even consider Cas might like him back and even considering that consideration made him feel like a little girl!
Cas let out a dry laugh. "Lucifer? Ruth, he's dead. He's been dead for a couple of years now."
Cas shook his head. "None of what we happened here today was okay, Jody," he snapped back, though it wasn't aggressive. He let out a tired sigh. "When did I stop holding Dean accountable?"
Dean woke up with his head leaning on the Impala's back seat window, feeling the familiar bumps of the road. The sky was dark, and he could see shady trees passing them from a distance slowly.
“I… don’t know what to say,” Cas responded honestly in lieu of just admitting it aloud. Now he had all but confirmed it, he just wasn’t sure if saying yes was something Sam was expecting, and he wanted to be sure Sam suspected it before he said it. Obviously, Sam was expecting it though from his lack of a reaction.
And what exactly had Dean done to deserve his admiration, respect, loyalty, and devotion? What had he done to earn it from Mia? Or Kevin? Shouldn't everyone be holding him at the cold distance that Jody held him at?
"If they do what you always wanted, which was putting you behind them and moving on and being happy, then you would feel bad showing up again and having them barely recognize you." Lucifer turned slightly to stare at him. "Because you have changed, Dean. I know you have because that crazy, feverish, broken-legged stranger I met would never have the compassion or patience or empathy you have now. Maybe that's why your dream ended with you back in the cabin, with your broken leg."
Dean decided to roll the dice. "I don't think you will?"
"Well, maybe he forgot…?" Cas attempted to defend, but his voice didn't come out as sure as he intended.
Castiel sighed, it did sound a bit ridiculous when Sam worded it like that, but he was clearly still in denial about it all. ‘What do you want me to say, Sam?”
Castiel nodded back firmly and put his hands over Max's head. He felt the familiar brutal tug that his powers required these days, and he began to strain himself, working his way into Max's mind to bring him back up and out.
“What, is the base my cage? Are you going to lock me up forever and just let Chuck’s power come back, let him kill my family?”
Dean looked at them thoughtfully. "Not necessarily…" he pondered, more for himself than anyone else. "Back in my world, I created something that I could recreate that would do what you're describing."
Through his watery gaze, he saw Luc and the survivors all huddled around him, looking scared.
Dean looked away from the camera again, clearly shouting out to someone. “Hey, Raph!” he called. “Come here and say something for Mia’s birthday!”
Dean raised an eyebrow at her. "The Bomb?"
Pushing aside any and all worries, and unable to really hear anything that was just said, Dean threw the door to the bunker open, and it slammed against the wall with a loud, dramatic boom, cutting anyone else off from asking Mia any probing questions.
"Wait, so what-" Max interrupted him but got cut off mid-sentence. There was silence from his end.
“I’m sorry Kevin,” the Jody on the video interrupted with a laugh. ‘What exactly am I supposed to say here?”
Dean had taken this time to train the survivors in the base. There were a few really talented survivors among them who were able to help him, but no hunters.
Dean immediately knew what she was. An angel. He knew how they held themselves, how they dressed. And her gray business pantsuit was par for the course.
"Dean, what's wrong my love?" He asked with concern as he stroked Dean's scalp, running his hand up and down his head beneath his hair.
Dean whipped his head to him, tears welling in his eyes but not slipping past, probably trained and conditioned not to over his lifetime.
Dean woke up with a pain in his neck. He blinked a few times and tried really hard to focus on where he was.
"Dean, what's wrong?" Cas' voice was threatening, but not to Dean. It was the kind of voice that was ready to fight anything that was hurting him. "Is it me?"
It had not been the first thing Dean wanted to hear in the morning. He had now been at their base for two weeks and began to settle into the comforts and sense of community it provided. Though none of them were quite skilled with their weapons, Dean finally understood why Sammy loved those Apocalypse World hunters so much. It was nice to have people around you with a shared goal.
The archangel gave him a sad little smile. "This was Michael's. When he broke me out of the cage, we got the chance to catch up for three days before our father caught up to us. He said that the centuries he spent with me locked in hell were this... prison of torment. This necklace was given to him by a child while wandering the earth, and he admired it for its simplicity. The child gave it to him, and it was the most valuable thing she could have given. So Michael gave this to me. He said it symbolized the most important thing he could give to me." Lucifer kicked the grass as he walked. "Sometimes I wonder if my brother would be alive had I just played into Chuck's game."
“Mia.”
"Mia?" Dean's voice was soft and understanding, and it pissed her off.
“I honestly don’t know how much more I can tell you,” Trinity opened. “I really can’t explain what I saw, but I swear, one second they were there, and the next, poof!”
Dean and Kevin both shared an exasperated look. "Want to let us in on this, you guys?" Kevin asked desperately, hating being left out of the loop.
“10-4, I’m on route,” a female voice responded, a little bit clearer than the first voice.
“When I came to again, it was sometime in the day, and I was alone in that cabin, and I watched as Lucifer walked through the door.”
"You said I'm different. Is it bad different?"
Was he? He gently felt for his face, the movement of his arms causing Dean to finally back away from him, giving him space. He felt the slightly wet trail on his cheek.
The ground wasn't merely flat and endless; it tapered off about two hundred yards out. From his position and what he could hazard to guess about his terrain, it was a rather steep drop. Maybe too steep. He couldn't tell if it was a hill or a cliff caused by some natural destruction.
Well, it was too late now. She was deep in it, and so was Dean. For both their sakes, the best thing to do here was to just let the cards fall where they may.
Mia plopped herself in one of the two chairs to the right of the bed, it's back facing the window. Dean did the same in the chair beside her, making pained grunting sounds as his body moved as though he'd been through a rough fight only moments ago, and he sat with his legs slightly sprawled with the worst posture he could manage.
As time was going on, Dean wasn't "getting used to it"; it only made every day harder and harder to go through. Lucifer knew because that's what it was like when he was in the cage, and he was locked in there for centuries.
The four of them walked inside her house, Sam immediately plopping down on her couch while Jody relaxed into her chair. Dean sat on the very edge of the couch, very close to where Mia awkwardly stood in the corner right in front of the closed door as if she was going to bolt any second, and Dean was prepared to follow. Cas also stood awkwardly for a bit, having never been to Jody's house before, but eventually settled on the other side of Sam, closest to Jody, placing Sam in between himself and Dean.
Dean wasn't in the cabin anymore; he was lying on the cold cafeteria floor. He blinked his eyes open and saw a familiar face looming over him, looking terrified.
“You were driving me nuts!” Sam defended, and Dean had to thunk his head back against his headrest lest he say something he couldn’t take back. “You’ve been acting weird ever since you found that stupid video, and Cas was doing that scrunched up face he makes when he’s sad and trying to hide it, and you are both
? He wasn’t gay, so how was it even possible? In any other world, in any other moment, he could have easily written it off as a mistake, as confusion, but he knew, deep in the heart of him, that that was a lie. It was a lie, because even now, panting and spitting bile into the dirt, he ached for Cas’s touch, his words, to soothe the pain away.
“So…” Dean grinned, and risked slapping Cas on the shoulder – friends did that, right? It wasn’t too obvious? “You ready to go break into some dead lady’s house?”
“Not sure,” Dean replied honestly, as he reached out to start Baby’s ignition. “But it’s pretty weird.”

Without another word, or even a goodbye, Sam hung up.
, Dean supposed was the polite word for it.
“I hate this,” Sam muttered. “I should have set off sooner.”
The bathroom in this particular motel was small, but the sink ran clean and cool, and there was a small stack of clean towels by the tub, and that was all he needed. Wetting the towels, and then scooping up their first aid kit as he hurried back into the bedroom, he dropped his supplies on the end of the bed and surveyed what needed to be done.
Suddenly Dean was alone in the field. And he really was alone. He saw nothing but wheat around him for miles, and no other being. Perhaps that was a good thing because it meant there were no enemies to worry about.
After another hour or so of walking, Dean let out a frustrated shout. Mia and Kevin had not stopped like he asked and had instead spent the entire trek arguing about literally anything that their topic morphed into. For the first time in a very long time, Dean was disappointed to have not run into any damn Purgatory monsters.
Dean nodded, though he didn’t entirely agree. True, this place was a shelter in a pretty fucking horrible storm, and he thought it could be pleasant to come here and roam the halls, but his six years here were pretty awful. Sure, he loved Mia, Kevin, Luc, and Raph, but that didn’t erase all of the scary, sad, terrifying, almost paralyzing moments of grief he felt, both for his home and for Jody.
"Have you felt it before?"
In an instant, Dean felt a rough hand on his wrist that yanked him forcefully away from Lucifer's grip.
Castiel sat shotgun as Sam laid out in the back, sleeping yet again as the sky turned black.
"Dammit!" Ruth kicked one of the cafeteria tables in the base, and it flew across the room, hitting the wall with a sickening crack. "How the hell can we be too late? How the hell did they even find Michael's key?!"
“Hey, Raph, you’re going to be okay, okay?” Dean said with a calm and soothing voice, refusing to let himself sound scared. “We’re going to find Luc.”
"I did fail my father, but it taught me that I didn't need to listen to everything he said because he wasn't always right. Sammy did get hurt, but we always got through it, and it made us stronger brothers. And I'm not alone. I have Sam, I have you, Luc, Mia…"
He closed the door behind him and put his hands on her shoulders as she pulled back. "It's okay, Mia. Everyone was really worried about you. Your mom was going crazy."
Chapter titles are titles of songs by Josh Pyke that fit the mood/theme of the chapter :)
When she was little, her mother used to take her to a park just like this one, a park with lots of trees and a view of the lake, and they would sit on the bench watching the birds and the people, and they would name them and make up little stories about them.
Chuck, the Darkness, archangels, prophets? Dean Winchester indeed led a busy and unfortunate life. One that Lucifer was almost excited and scared to get to know a little bit more.
He remembered that day, a Leviathan had ripped him apart, and Lucifer came to his aid, and the two talked about their lives for the first time. Lucifer had shown him that simple necklace when talking about his brother.
Kevin smiled when he looked between the two of them as he led Dean back up into the halls, leaving Lucifer behind at the entrance to the cafeteria. He had known Lucifer for a little while, not very long, but long enough to see that he wasn't exactly one for friends. Lucifer never told him anything about his past or his family, only that "Satan" was more than a bit of an exaggeration.
Lucifer shook his head, breaking from his mood. "I know I could blame myself, but I know whose fault this was. Chuck isn't just the one who… destroyed…my brother, but he's the one who made Michael sacrifice himself for me. He never would have saved me if Chuck hadn't put me in the cage and lied to them about it."
Sam and Dean were in the kitchen, packing up some leftover chicken to take home with them, and Castiel was standing in the open doorway in the next room, staring outside, lost in thought.
She bit her lip guiltily. "Okay, that was low," she admitted. "But I don't think it was unfair. I stopped fighting monsters, which is what I really wanted to do, and for most of six years, all I did was read and decipher books and journals just so I could get you here. I made that sacrifice, Dean, and I get that expecting you to do something in return is selfish, but I am selfish. And I've earned the right to be selfish."
When Sam came back with the Impala, the three of them plus Mia and Kevin went back to Dean's room to finish movie night.
“Yeah, he was, and he was doing it as gently as he could, so I can’t say with certainty that the man was dead.”
Max bit his lip and studied the girl for a moment. "What do you want me to do, fake-witch?"
"Because I've had some practice being scared, Kev. I've been scared since I was a kid. Scared to fail my father, scared Sammy might get hurt, scared that my entire life would be spent alone. But things aren't always black and white."
But his words seemed to suffice for now, as Jody leaned back in her seat, folding her arms. Clearly, this wasn't sitting right with her, but she had nothing to argue for. What could she say? That she wanted Mia to be her daughter? That wasn't really the problem at hand here.
"Hmmmm," was all Dean said, his face still pressed into his mattress, refusing to stand up.
Dean rolled his eyes and decided to play into Mia's little game because though she was doing it out of this childish matchmaker-y obsession with Dean and Cas, he did actually want his reunion with Cas to just be the two of them. "Sorry, Sammy, Mia's kind of rude," he said, sending her a death glare, "but she's cool. And starving, she hasn't eaten for like two days."
He grabbed his knives and his gun and tucked them all into his waistband. He hobbled over to his boots and jacket tossed on the floor in front of the fire yesterday and put them on, repositioning the placement of his knives to his jacket pockets.
Chuck clapped. "I see someone's done their due diligence. Tell me, what are all of you doing here?"
It was what he wanted to do when Cas had been hurt in the same way, to sit next to him and pull him into his lap and shush him and soothe him and never, ever have to hear him ask him to just leave him there to die.
Third was Cas: horror. This one was the worst because it was so simple. Cas believed Dean was telling the truth and didn't need to see the proof or understand why to be upset about it.
Jody took in a deep breath, still watching the sunset. "Castiel, can I tell you a story?"
Three people sat on a triangle made of their cots on the ground, their legs inside the confines of the shape they made as they chattered away, stopping to look at Dean coming through the door.
He had been entirely willing to take Dean to a hospital when he first broke his leg, but Dean refused. Sam would not often offer the hospital as a solution, so he wondered if maybe that was a sign that they should have gone regardless.
Dean picked up the pace a bit just out of curiosity, but he still took his time getting downstairs just to annoy Kevin; after all, it was his favorite pastime. When he did finally arrive in the cafeteria, everyone was there. Literally, everyone. All of the remaining thirty-five survivors, including the two resident archangels.
All three of their arms shot up.
Lucifer.
Dean scratched the back of his neck awkwardly. “Yeah, well, that’s not what happened.”
How low had he fallen when the most intriguing man he'd come across was fascinating because though he may hate his guts and fear him violently, at least he knew what he was? It was a bit sad, but so was everything going on.
"I'm sorry…" was all Lucifer could manage in response.
He didn't remember anything about the night before, just seeing Cas telling him not to sleep on the stairs and then fuzziness.
The gun was proof Dean trusted her. She would not let that trust go to waste.
Sam cleared his throat and stood back up, awkwardly smoothing the wrinkles in his jeans. "Well, we should go; Dean and Mia are probably in the car already." He paused before exiting the room and turned back to Cas. "There has to be something else, right?"
"No need for that, Castiel," the voice was that of a woman's; it was deep and smooth. He turned slowly to see a woman in a suit with brown skin and jet black hair that was curled beautifully.
Nor would it be simple to explain that Mia promised to do whatever Dean asked of her, and he wasn't sure Jody would like that one at all.
How did this stranger know who he was? Sure, the teams back at the rescue bases knew him, but he would recognize any of them. He had definitely never seen this man before. He could understand if the man recognized his vessel, but not Lucifer himself. This was definitely a human, not an angel or a demon, so how the hell did he recognize Lucifer for who he was? He would understand if he recognized him by name, he knew that survivors spread the word of the archangel Lucifer, but there was no way he could recognize him based on appearance.
"What?!" Sam was concerned now, but mostly angry at his brother. "Dammit, I thought I didn't see the Impala, but I was distracted by dropping the damn eggs; I didn't think about it." He slammed the bag of carrots violently down onto the counter. "How many times have we told him not to leave the bunker with his leg like that?"
“Did he tell you anything? His name?” Sam was obviously hopeful that this person was Dean, but the phone call indicated two other men in the car with him, so the one Trinity met could have been either of them dragging Dean out of the car, though the driver seemed more likely considering their discussion of the other man’s state.
After a few minutes of dazed sitting, he realized he was underneath a table. How long had that been happening? Why was he under a table?
He glanced down at himself for a moment, as if taking himself all in again. "I called you to come look at that… light thing, and I was chased out by a farmer… and he… he acted strange after a while…" it was clear that Max was slowly piecing his memories back together. "You… oh my god, Dean, what the hell happened? Are you okay?!"
"I was Michael's sword in my world too, but I never said yes to my Michael. In case you couldn't tell, I have a tough time trusting archangels." He jabbed Lucifer in the ribs, and the man loosened a bit, laughing.
But that didn’t happen. In fact, the archangel pulled the hunter into a HUG of sorts, and Dean was just smiling casually as if this happened all the time.
"Maybe not, but I've met you. After everything you've told me in the past few days, about your crazy life and death experiences, and everything you've been through with those two, I know how much you'd be willing to sacrifice for them. And I've only known you a few weeks now, and I'm already terrified of the idea of you getting hurt, let alone dying. So I have some idea of how they feel about you, Dean. Because if what I feel, what I worry about when it comes to you, is even a fraction of how much they've poured into you, then they're probably back home, ripping apart every corner of the world looking for you. And believe me, I will make sure that you are still alive when they finally rip open this world and find you. Or I'll be damned if I don't find a way to get you back to them, ALIVE."
The archangel fretted over the boy in the bed without prompting and understood exactly what he was here to do. Max seemed to have many broken bones across his arms and cuts and bruises lined with butterfly bandages or stitches on his face. It was obvious that he was in a pretty bad state, and it honestly looked like he survived a bomb going off.
Lucifer reached out a hand to touch Dean's leg, but he regained his senses and scurried backward, crashing into the table behind him. Lucifer could clearly see that his distress wasn't just the blood loss he was suffering from; there was something about him that scared this human. He frowned a bit. Scaring humans was the one thing he'd been trying to avoid all this time, and yet even when he saved one and showed no inhuman signs, they still feared him just based on sight.
"I am still your father, and I am still the-"
"Sam, take a moment and consider exactly how much time has passed in your life."
Sam turned back to Max again, biting his lip. This reminded him of when his hunters from Apocalypse World died on his watch. It had hurt, and it felt like it was all his fault, and Max was his responsibility too.
Chuck threw his hands in the air as Lucifer crossed the already minimal distance between them to rest a wary hand on his arm as to whisk him away from the Mills as requested. “Touchy touchy! But alright, Luc-i-fer,” he stressed the name before the two disappeared in a blink, leaving the Mills alone in the park.
“Mia.”
Dean immediately regretted his decision. He didn't need to spin around to see that the rift had disappeared, stranding him here.
(You should listen to the songs for each chapter! They were my inspiration for the story!)
"Nope."
Mia nodded slowly. “I’ve never seen the footage before, but yeah. This will explain everything, at least, enough.”
"Yes, fine. Promise."
"I'm… glad to hear that…" Jody's voice was level, but it still betrayed her confusion and surprise.
They didn't exactly have a plan besides getting the key ring off of Ruth, who was still sitting on the throne, holding the lance, and insulting and bickering with the demons that were flitting around the room aimlessly. It was so disorganized that not a single demon noticed the six unwanted people constantly poking their heads in and out.
Sean nodded with him. "It would be nice to keep one of you around, at least until we don't have monsters to worry about anymore."
Dean rolled his eyes. "You mean, were we talking about the fact that I told Cas I was in love with him?"
