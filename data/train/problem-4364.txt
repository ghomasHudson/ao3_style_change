Dean has their bodies flush, his arm pushing against Cas harshly. Dean is so close Cas can feel his heavy breath tickle his lips. Cas holds his glare, lust exploding at the look of anger on Dean’s face.
The memories of the accident are rough to relive as Dean thinks of how to tell Cas what happened. And although he’s recounted events to several different people by now, he’s never revealed to anyone the full events. It’s painful, but Dean works through it for Cas, “I was on an unfamiliar route the other night through Colorado, ‘cause I decided to take some stupid side contract... Anyway, it was raining pretty hard, and there was a rockslide - hit my trailer. The debris blew my tires and I lost my brakes going downhill, so I used a runoff. Rig got totaled... So did I, I guess.”
Dean nodded. Coach Singer patted him on the back and Dean went to sit with the rest of the team. Castiel made to move too, but Coach Singer stopped him, “No, Castiel you’re top. Raul, we need to go over your bottom set for next week.”
Drex tried to stifle a laugh and Dean felt defeated, “Oh, fuck you guys…”
Just like at the end of every practice, the neutral match against Castiel was the last of the day. And, like every time, Castiel won.
Castiel nodded and looked at Dean. Coach Singer continued dismissively, “You two get on the bus now, we better get going.”
Dean’s eyes are still closed, ducking down to lick Cas’s throat, “I could tell, baby.”
Looking down, Dean notices his slick fingers and hand partially inside Cas still has a lot of lube on it. Dean wonders sinisterly if Cas can take another surprise…
“Thanks,” Castiel poked at his vegetables with his fork.
“Um,” Castiel looked over to Dean, catching him looking back. Dean looked away. Castiel smirked at Anna, “Sure.”
Cas feels his vision dim with lust at Dean’s confirmation and the last words Dean asks don’t matter anymore. So as an answer he begins to unbutton his own pants, kissing at Dean’s mouth again with a newfound thirst.
“Got an early curfew from your folks?” Dean asked, taking the peas back.
The gym’s door closing echoed through the silent gym. Castiel blinked as he was gripping over Dean, both of them laying on the mat. He lost his concentration as he noticed they were the only two left. Castiel wondered how long he and Dean had been practicing.
Dean’s breath caught and tried to measure his heart as he put on a poker face, turning back to Coach Singer and Castiel. He didn’t dare let his mind wonder if the Coach had just noticed what he’d done. Or worse, had somehow known what they’d done last night on the gym floor. Instead, Dean smiled nonchalantly to an ashamed looking Castiel and scowling coach as he approached them, “What’s up?”
They came naturally to Dean: “You liked blowing me?”
” Dean repeated, growing actually aggravated.
Cas’s dick jerks in Dean’s hand and his own cock responds, grazing the skin on Cas’s ass. Dean pushes his fingers in further, feeling the warm rings of Cas’s insides hug his knuckles. Dean loses his contact with Cas’s neck as the man hangs his head. Dean notices that Cas’s hands on the shower wall in front of them have turned to fists.
“Shhh!” Dean hisses, “Keep it down.”
“No,” Castiel replied quietly, “I don’t want you to stop.”
Something starts to come out of Dean’s mouth but Cas is already turned and all but running to the back again.
“Alfie!” Anna chastised and picked Samandriel up as he started throwing punches.
They all laughed. Jo looked at her card and lit up, “Eight! Dean, you’re my mate.”
Luci sauntered over, flung open the refrigerator and pulled out a beer, commenting condescendingly, “Jesus, how long does it take to cook chicken? Commercial breaks don’t wait for dumb girls, kid.”
“Oh,” Dean examined the ceiling, “You can go, if you want. I’ll be fine here.”
Dean sighs and looks up at the ceiling as if to pray, “Actually, probably not.”
“So can I take you home?” Dean finally asked.
There was a silence that fell between the two. Castiel wondered if he would ever be a good conversationalist, biting his lip and watching the sun filter in through the leaves above through his one eye, not knowing what to say next.
The figure in front of Jack is looming over him, wearing a dark beige jumpsuit with black printed lettering. The figure has short, dirty blonde hair, and a scar that reaches from his neck to his cheek.
“Hey, fag!” Asmod yelled, running up in front and knocking the notebooks Castiel was holding out of his arms. Castiel looked down at them, scattered on the tiled floor. Al shoved his shoulders, yelling, “We’re talkin’ to ya!”
“Well, chill out, would you?” Claire kindly suggests.
“What?” Castiel said as he entered the space.
Dean disguised his groan of trampled hopes by rolling onto his side towards Castiel. Again on his back, the layer of cold ice under the hand towel was actually extremely soothing. Dean’s eyes easily found Castiel’s after he sighed in relief, smiling softly, “Thanks.”
Dean’s breath hitches and his voice is muffled by Cas’s skin, “Goddammit, I’m close already.”
“Mm,” Dean replied, exhaustion beginning to really take its toll as he scooted under the covers.
He deftly reached for the forsaken pillow behind Castiel’s head with the hand that was now free. Replacing his body with the pillow was tricky, but after he was able to lift Castiel’s arm without waking him, getting out from under his grasp. Castiel moved his legs up to the smaller mass, and Dean pulled his legs away when he had the opportunity; unfortunately, the quick jolted leg movement had Dean tumbling off the side of the bed.
Hannah puts her hand on Cas’s shoulder, “Why don’t you just go and look for him? He’s probably just scrolling on his phone upstairs.”
But Dean would definitely be at this night practice, and that made Castiel’s heart race more than any sport’s competition.
A laugh escapes Cas, amused at Dean’s spontaneous dramatics. He looks back up to Dean and catches him staring back, totally absorbed.
Dean instinctively pushes up on his arms as his voice comes back to him.
. Well, it was. I screwed that up, though.”
Cas’s arms pull Dean in closer. He hears Dean inhale, and he holds him tight against his body. Cas holds his breath, not sure how to put into words what he’s feeling.
He thought about something he had overheard today… He swallowed and said, “I heard Amanda confessed she liked you today.”
A silence fell between them; Castiel felt raw.
“Hm,” Meg hums as the bartender drops off two more, “And does this ‘problem’ happen to go by the name of ‘Dean’?”
Dean nods and a smile spreads across his face. He pushes his face back into Cas’s neck, and Cas hesitantly closes his eyes again.
Castiel looked stunned for a moment - and to be honest, Dean felt surprised at the rush of words that had just punched out of him as well - before all but closing his eyes to hide, replying: “I don’t understand… Why do you even like me?”
Cas is asleep by the time the showerhead turns on.
“Hey,” Dean’s voice shook Castiel to attention. He lifted his head from the hand he’d been resting it on and looked around him. Most of the other kids were meandering out of the class. Castiel’s eyes found Dean standing next to his desk, backpack slung over his shoulder casually.
Castiel sniffed, “What do you want to do?”
Cas rolls his eyes, “Will you lock that door? I don’t want anyone else wandering in.”
Dean can only raise his brows to that. He studies the kid and doesn’t quite know if he returns the sentiment. The only time he thought about children were those two years with Lisa and Ben, but that felt like a lifetime ago, and he’d ended up royally fucking that situation up too.
“Mhm,” Dean feels awkward.
Sonny was eager to drop off Dean, Ash and the other teammate that lived at Sonny’s with them (a lightweight a year younger than Dean, although he kept forgetting his name because they didn’t have much in common besides wrestling and Sonny’s). Sonny acted all mushy and proud when he needlessly helped them unload their meager belongings, and Dean acted like it didn’t make him feel good. They all waved as Sonny drove away in the truck, then turned to go drop off their luggage at the bus.
“So, that’s the only bedroom,” he said, pointing at the last door. “And as you might have guessed, there’s, um, only one bed.”
Especially when he recalled his unfolded laundry basket, right out in the open on the couch.
But he froze once more at hearing Dean’s laughter.
Sam frowned for a second, but he nodded.
“Yeah, so was entering this damn place,” pointed out Dean, still feeling bitter.
As their fingers touched.
Crowley let out a deep sigh. “While I’m all about acquiring information, it’s not very hard to know who you are. There’s a warrant for your arrest sent throughout the galaxy. What I find interesting about this, however, is that while everyone is evidently more concerned about Lord Dean Winchester falling off the tracks, nobody seems to be asking too many questions about the elusive James Novak. Which is almost a pity, really, as they might realize that you are not James Novak.”
“This is weird, Cassie.”
“I—I just do. Doesn’t matter. You brainwashed him and ensl—whatever.”
“Are you panicking now?”
After clearing his throat, Dean said, “Um, actually, we’re—we’re off right now. So, if you guys want to come over sooner—whenever you’re ready, that’s fine too.”
“Didn’t look like nothing.”
“I swear.”
And based on his conversations with Gabriel, he wasn’t the only one.
Richie hesitated a moment and then said, “I know it’s bad of me to ask, but I—I just wanted to know how Dean was doing.”
“That’s because Sam’s not here, actually. He’s—”
And while anyone else would have been turned down after such a suggestion, as it was within Castiel’s right to have this discussion privately between him and Naomi, Bartholomew, being nosy as he was, had always possessed a talent to slither himself into matters that didn’t concern him. Be it personal or professional.
“I do. This is just for precaution if things get complicated with your exit. You might find it useful in the near future,” said Crowley.
Castiel tried to believe Dean, but given the intense conversations he had overheard in the past few days, he wasn’t overly convinced of that fact.
Dean frowned, glancing around the shop. Castiel, understanding his confusion, added, “This is my brother’s shop. I’m simply helping him out this weekend for the holiday rush and in return he takes care of the whole meal. Well, most of it.”
They had almost reached the cabin, when Castiel asked, “Um, Dean? How are we going to last in that cabin? I only packed clothes and your bag is smaller than mine. I’d be impressed if you manage to survive without food. And what about the horses?”
And if Dean was surprised to see Castiel there, that was nothing compared to how stunned Castiel found himself to be once he shifted his eyes and noticed Dean not even a few feet away from him, staring at him.
Castiel had to repress a groan at the realization that his son and his
Brushing his thumb over Dean's hand, Castiel weighed on his words. “If I were to say yes to this suggestion, then what? We just text and talk like before?”
Gabriel: Awesome.
“He was adamant.”
“Not the way Dean does it. You can’t know, but when you’re not here, it’s always ‘Cas said,’ or ‘the other day with Cas,’ to ‘I can’t wait to tell Cas this.’ It’s so obvious.”
“Hell no,” said Rufus. “This ain’t on you. Don’t you go feeling guilty that some ass-hat totally crossed the line, you hear me?”
of you are supposed to be here,” Chuck added looking at Castiel. “So, why are you here? Gabriel, what are you up to?”
“Are they open?” asked Gabriel.
Sam’s heart was jumping in his chest and he felt dizzy for a second.
“So many things I want to say right now,” muttered Sam.
But he was his usual self at least. His posture was less tensed, he was smiling and the moment Castiel started the car, Dean put the radio back on, and was happily humming along it.
And that would only be likely when hell froze over.
And unfortunately, just as he had expected, it seemed that he wouldn’t be spared from his grandfather’s annoying comments. As annoying as that may be, it didn’t change much for Dean on that particular day.
“Dean, you don’t—”
And it was shaking.
Which is rather sly of her, and I like it.
“Dean?”
Replenished after their meal, perhaps a little too much for Dean, Castiel suggested they take a walk nearby. Dean made a mini face of disapproval.
Castiel: Leave to date him?
Sam had the perfect come back for that comment, but he judged that this particular moment wouldn’t be the best time to use it. Thus, he stayed silent, which did very little to help the situation.
Mr. Redfield left the kitchen, and once Dean assessed that Mrs. Middleton was focused on helping Ash clean his hands and face—he had thought it funny to draw on himself a moustache made of batter—Dean slid down his chair with extreme caution, making sure not to fall or attract unnecessary attention to himself. Just before turning the corner leading down the hall, he glanced behind him one last time. Celeste was playing with the plastic cookie cutter, while Donna was eyeing the timer on the fridge, determined to ensure the cookies wouldn’t burn.
Dean stopped breathing.
“Yeah, I meant—nobody would have held it against you if you hadn’t shown.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean swallowed hard and tried to not get carried away with the imagery.
While Dean couldn’t deny that it was a good effort, and that Chuck was actually a pretty good singer, he wanted to put an end to Gabriel’s shenanigans.
But once again, Castiel surprised him.
Following Michael’s disturbance, Castiel and Dean somehow returned to the room in a haze, dragging their feet, to mull things over.
Dean frowned at him. “We can do that? Like even our reservations and stuff? It’s in my name.
“Or you with the mark.”
Feeling somewhat intimidated by them, Dean briefly glimpsed back to the spot where his parents and his brother had been a moment ago.
“Liar.”
“And I’m super aware,” he continued, cutting him off, “that this says much more about me than it says about you.” He lowered his eyes a moment. “As you might have noticed, I have a thing about lying. And when—I just assumed the worse. That you were—because that’s been my general experience so far when it comes to lying. But I should have given you the benefit of the doubt. And as for why you didn’t tell me the truth right away, I get why you did it. I’m—I’m just sorry that you felt like you had to do that to feel comfortable, and I feel even worse that I apparently proved your point.”
Castiel swore he even caught them whispering briefly.
During most of the afternoon, the ham had been cooking in the oven slowly, and by the time Dean had returned from his walk with Whiskey, the smell was more than just mouth wavering.
“Okay. I believe you. I just—please don’t do that again.”
His heart was light, the lightest it had been in a very long time, and he owed it all to Gabriel.
Intrigued as to what Dean was thinking of, Castiel nonetheless reasoned that he should content himself with the fact that the matter had been dropped, at last. And wanting to ensure that it stayed that way, he then questioned Dean about
“May I ask what happened to him? He mentioned a fire but nothing about his shoulder.”
Desperately fidgeting on his seat, as though he couldn’t make up his mind to remain on his spot or run off, he finally crossed his arms over his chest and stared down at his plate awkwardly.
“Exactly what I said,” he blurted out. “Dean, he—he won’t go for the obvious. Even if we tell him, even if Cas tells him, he’ll probably resist. He has to come to the conclusion himself and act on it, which will be difficult because he’s—”
Sam put his phone away and reminded himself that he still had quite a few things to take care of before calling it a day.
Dean was having a panic attack. “Where were they? Before?”
An awkward silence roamed about and Gabriel’s phone buzzed. Sam grabbed it from his nightstand and handed it to Gabriel.
Once everyone had emptied their plates (and drinks for some), Gabriel was ready to pursue the rest of the day.
“We did. So much that a few months back, we started looking into it. There’s a lot of things that don’t add up. And it dates further back than we initially thought. Long story short, it looks like we have more than just one mole. The ranch is okay, it’s safe, but…That’s always been Granddad’s baby. He’s had many other businesses, a few overseas in fact, but the ranch…it’s his. And while it expanded, he managed to keep it exactly how he wanted it. I think that’s why we stand out so much. We constantly have offers to buy and to invest, which is why many of our current investors often felt that we should go bigger. And the most obvious move to do this would be to make it a public company instead of a private one.” He lifted his hand. “I cannot press this enough that this was the last thing Granddad wanted for the ranch. He’s been pressured into it for years and he always put his foot down.”
Sam sighed. “Probably not. No.”
“No, I—see that’s another reason why I didn’t want to say anything. I knew the moment I’d say that it would sound like—I don’t want you to think you aren’t a priority or that this whole thing is bad timing. This is about me really sucking at handling everything all at once.”
Dean and Jack stared at him, surprised.
“No. Not yet. You need to drink this.”
Sam groaned. “Dean, no. I told you. This is not a good idea.”
“I told you, I fancied a talk.”
“What?”
He hurriedly started to pick up a few items of clothing on the floor, when Sam said, “Don’t worry about that. We’ll sort it out later.”
“You’re saying I ignored it? Or just…repressed it?”
Max froze and briefly squinted at him.
So, he continued implementing patience and focused on acclimating himself to the house and the nearby town of Tulpa.
The bag now finally empty, Dean hung it by his jacket, and took the opportunity to fetch the letter and package in his pocket, having been looking forward to that part the most.
“Cas, I swear I’m okay. I’m just tired.”
“Jess,” Gabriel leaned back on his seat, “not only are we going to be there, we are also helping making it happen.”
“That’s because that’s not the route I took this week,” explained Dean. “I had to use a sleigh to carefully carry the hay, and because of the hills, I had to take the scenic route. Don’t think the horses would have been super happy with me otherwise.”
“Same, Sam. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”
“Hi.”
And like the ties, to him, it meant something.
massive incompetence.”
“—comes around like magic and you do nothing?”
Now lying on his side and looking at Dean’s back, Castiel reached out to Dean’s shoulder and gently squeezed it. Castiel instantly felt Dean quiver at his touch.
“Really?” said Sam, intrigued.
And then, to make matters worse, the SUV went full speed and hit the Mustang in the back.
“There was a few parties at the hotel last year. That was—pleasant. And I—um…”
Something that he might regret and kick himself afterward for having done so.
Stunned, Dean apologized for the bump, as he regained his balance.
“Trust me,” he said, laughing. “I’ll grab your drink and find us a table.”
“Yes. Nothing’s wrong. We just—come by. We have something planned.”
His eyes were closing.
Gabriel: WHEN DID THIS HAPPEN?
“Of course. You don’t have to read it this instant.”
Castiel turned to Dean, who was looking around, seemingly judging the place. The moment he realized Castiel was staring at him, Dean rubbed his neck and cleared his throat.
And now, with nothing else to do but fret over poor Dean, lying at his side, Castiel had been granted an opportunity to ponder over his last few days with him. To reflect on how his initial impression of him had been wrong. How he loved hearing about his childhood. Of how proud Dean was of his brother, who he unfortunately didn’t get the chance to see very often. Of how he always spoke respectfully about everyone, in fact. Even his roommates, Spengler and Zeddmore, who were obviously a little annoying to him.
He knew staring hopelessly at it wouldn’t do much good, and yet, there he was, doing it.
Dean opened the door and let Castiel in.
Jack nodded.
And remained perfectly silent.
“Seeing you like that and having to burn—we had a funeral. We burned your body—vessel—whatever. I had to stand there, watch you burn and say goodbye and I—I was so mad at everything. And all I could think was that it was his fault. Jack. I know
“Yes, and—I also meant to ask about this—what is this place exactly?”
The only reason why he was going through with this was because he genuinely loved Garth and Bess, and wished to express his support to his friends.
And then, someone near them screamed so loudly, all four of them jumped, only to realize it was Becky, who was making her way towards the stage like a woman on a mission, as she called out Chuck’s name.
“On your behalf! Because you made him—because you made
“Cas, please, just—” He paused when he felt his phone buzzing, but then continued, choosing to ignore it. “Just let me explain—”
Much like room I had had the chance to quickly explore, standing in the luxurious foyer, they deduced that the place was extravagant. And not in a good way.
And then he exited the apartment and Dean had to digest the fact that his grandfather had actually said something truly caring.
Sam: Don’t say no right now. But think about it.
Dean couldn’t do anything but stare at him. He felt so stupid. Beaten.
Feeling his bottom lip tremble, Dean shook his head desperately, as it was the only thing he could master to do.
“Dean, hold on—wait—” pleaded Sam, as he started lifting himself from his seat.
He came to a halt and stood still in the middle of the front lawn, feeling numb.
Keeping his mouth shut, Dean held his breath, bracing for the pain to come, but nothing happened.
For the next five minutes, Castiel gave a detailed account—much more detailed than the one he had initially given Dean on that night—of what had happened inside that house.
Opening his mouth, he then rejected Lucifer’s grace into it and sealed the bottle.
“And what about Dean?”
When he stood up to leave the cafeteria, it finally offered him an excuse to glance back at his table.
Castiel remained unconvinced and made sure his face conveyed it as he squinted at him.
“Nah. I mean, even if I knew for a fact that we could do something in the following week, I feel like we would have missed it. It would still be cool, but you know.”
And for the past minute or so, they both had to witness Dean’s frustration rise as he attempted to add cherry tomatoes and shredded cheese with great effort. No matter how Dean tried to keep them in place, most of the shredded cheese kept falling next to his taco and the tomatoes were simply rolling off onto his plate.
A complete bliss.
While he knew they still had plenty to discuss about this subject, he felt that they had addressed what had been urgent and wanted to yield the conversation to another direction.
Craving for more, Castiel seated himself for better access. He twisted his torso and leaned in to kiss Dean’s ribs. His hips. Even the side of his ass, to which he heard Dean moan loudly over his cock.
And while Enochian51415 had not elaborated too deeply about his family,  he had mentioned a brother. Not by name. Only his "younger brother." Michael Milton had three siblings, two brothers and a sister. All younger than him. But every time Enochian51415 had mentioned it, Castiel always had the impression he spoke of one in particular.
Gabriel lifted an eyebrow. “Changing the topic of conversation? Really, Cas? I invented that.”
“Then why did you immediately leave? Feels suspicious.”
“Me?” snorted Dean. “How in the world could I have ever managed that? The ranch is my life. Always has been. The responsibility, the pressure and the hours don’t really leave time for anything else.”
With his tongue.
Dean nodded shyly, agreeing with Sam’s point.
Dean swallowed hard, suddenly feeling trapped.
It turned out to be great idea. Not unlike when Dean had done so briefly at Castiel’s apartment, he shared a lot of information concerning their skills and characters, which really helped Castiel shape them in his mind.
“Castiel, wait. I wanted to ask a favour. Since you’re here, do you think you could play us something? It was your father’s idea and we made sure to set up the orchestra next to the piano.”
“Wow. That was convincing,” said Gabriel.
Sam had no idea who they were, either.
“Bad break-up?”
Because that was what he wanted.
If not permanent.
“I could wake up Dean right now, but somehow I feel like that’s not going to help anyone. Least of all Dean.”
While Henry asking him to be there for Dean, stating that he valued his skillset and also wanted to help him because of his family, were all good reasons for Castiel to be part of Dean’s life and aid him with the ranch, none of this actually explained why they needed to be married in order accomplish this, however.
“But, um, if we do a quick recap,” tried Dean, “my favourite part is when you said you loved me.” Castiel’s heart jumped. “That happened, right?” asked Dean.
“Pleasure. Doing my duty as a civilian, that’s all, Sheriff.”
And while nothing appeared to be missing, the scene before him was of small comfort.
“Um, technically, we don’t. This was for my tools. Before I moved here, I had access to a private garage, so all my stuff could be stored there. Considering that the storing place here is in the basement, rolling this outside is kind of annoying, especially in winter. So, I got a box for my tools, and sorta turned this into a nightstand. Until now,” he said, smiling brightly as he sat next to Castiel. “You hungry?” And finally, Dean revealed the breakfast he had prepared for them
Usually, he could maybe get through one or two replies per day. Four if he wasn’t too tired. The most he had done in one day had been six messages, but it had occurred only once and it had been on a night when he had battled with insomnia.
“I wasn’t actually,” said Castiel. “That was just earlier. I know it’s not what we had agreed on, but we could still do something this afternoon if you want?”
“Next time we go to the park,” said John, “we’ll try it. Or even when we visit Uncle Bobby. He certainly has the open fields around his house for it.”
He should have refused Castiel’s proposition.
“You know me and names,” Castiel said. “Other than
Shortly after that, he spotted Castiel emerging from the front door. He wasn’t running or even trotting, but his pace seemed slightly faster than usual.
Dean.
They were courteous and to the point. But above all, they utterly ignored what had happened when they had woken up.
“I mean it, Cas.”
That being said, Castiel grew disappointed that he still hadn’t heard from him by mid-afternoon, which was when Castiel had to leave for his shift. He tried him once more, and as he arrived at the bookstore, he finally got an answer.
“Same.”
They ate their dinner quickly, welcoming the food warming them up, and soon after, Dean joined Castiel in the living room, where they took care of the rest of the decorations together. They installed wreaths, Christmas lights throughout the living room, and placed some of the ornaments in the bookshelf, all the while drinking homemade eggnog, as they hummed Holiday songs. To which Dean had created his own lyrics—some had even been dirty ones—and Castiel had to admit that they were actually funny and had asked Dean to teach them to him.
He then realized Gabriel was staring at him. Not just looking at him, but fully examining him.
Dean stopped dead on the sidewalk at the thought.
That was not the answer Dean had wanted, and Sam and Castiel were worried that Gabriel would push him a little too far.
“Oh. What then?”
“Bloody hell, Cassie. Spill it. Who was that dashing man you were with? What is going on?”
His arm played dead.
With his mouth slightly open, Dean squinted at him. “You’re telling me other crap happened in-between Seattle and Juneau?”
“That I will probably be grounded for the rest of my life now?”
“My plans for the holidays?”
I mean, he too had thought about it for many years. Even despite everything.
Castiel frowned. “What?”
Wanting to change the subject, Dean said, “I prepared you a plate. There’s Aaron’s special porridge. I thought that would be the best bet for you. There are also waffles with fruits, and Eggs Benedict if you feel up to it. I know you like those. There’s a bunch of other stuff, but I think this is the best for now. Sounds good?”
“Miss Knight. And we’re old friends, so to speak.”
r things.”
“And what was it?”
He swallowed.
And yet, nothing.
Almost serious.
“Yes, sir. And what about you? What are you doing here? Enjoying your stay?”
And I then exited through the hatch and rushed to the palace, tackling down every dark smoke coming my way.
For intimidation purposes. You know.
“What happened with Dean, Cas? I know it’s about him.” Then, after a short pause, he said, “It is about Dean, right?”
And if he accepted, it would then lead to the one place that, let’s face it, he had been desperately trying to avoid since Castiel had reappeared in his life.
“No. I tried to call him too, but I’m only getting voicemail.”
“And you. What they—what’s going to happen once…”
Despite the mess, Dean, after he and Castiel had put most of the curse boxes back in their designated spots, quickly noticed that at least two curse boxes were missing.
Castiel frowned.
Moved by the beauty of it, Castiel glanced at Dean to see what he thought of it.
Now, Dean knew that Castiel was right. But like I said before, given how royally screwed up they both were, it would sound ridiculous to say that this messed up situation was in fact not Dean’s main problem in that moment.
“I’ll get another one for you, Dean,” said Castiel. Determined to help him, he stood up, which did nothing to help Dean's discomfort.
“What?”
“I don’t remember this being here,” said Castiel, turning to Dean.
Watching Dean at the stove, Castiel then gathered that perhaps he had been a bit harsh in his assessment of Dean’s personality.
“That would be great, Dean. Anything you want. I know Jess would be thrilled to see you.”
Castiel, with the saddest eyes ever, shook his head slowly. “No, Dean. I wasn’t lying. I have never lied about that. I always maintained that I hadn’t harmed you. And I meant it.”
Although he kept his eyes on the crowd, Dean had no problem believing that Castiel was intensively staring at him in that precise second.
“He left before I could do anything,” he said on the verge of tears. “That’s why I left the party. I was trying to find him. But…” his voice died down.
“Exactly,” said Castiel, with a grim look on his face. “Is this why you came here? Because you feel like you owe me?”
“That’s because only us know what happened. And we didn’t make a point of spreading it.”
Needless to say, since he had arrived at the lake-house, his free time had exponentially increased. And while he had taken it easy during his first week, the rainy days had helped him get back into it.
Every day.
“Our little innocent angel of a brother, drunk off his ass like a perfect delinquent.”
“You did? That was a while ago. Is there a reason why you sent me this now? You waited until after the bachelorette made her move?”
Not long afterwards, Rufus came back accompanied by Jody and one of her officers. They helped Castiel and Dean back on their feet.
And there it was.
“That’s not the point, Sam. That wasn’t the deal. Your father and I agreed that you boys, all three of you, could go if you stayed together and look out for each other.”
“There’s still the most obvious way, Cas.”
While the tub was slowly filling up, he stripped off his clothes and sat in it.
And it worked.
Under Castiel’s intense stare, Dean could tell that he was weighing his options: continue with the good thing they had going or go even further.
morning, I knew—or rather suspected—that it was about her.”
“Terrific.”
Dean moved his hands on the wheel.
There was far more that Dean had wished to say, but he kept his mouth shut, worried he would simply repeat his faux-pas of their previous night.
Dean had shared his confusion regarding these two points—particularly the aspect of his age—after the council had announced to him privately that he had been selected.
Castiel, sipping on his orange juice, reflected on the matter. He watched Dean take the last bite of his toast and then something occurred to him.
“Cas, don’t—I don’t go anywhere,” blurted out Dean, still panicking under Castiel’s gaze. “I—after what people are saying—like I trapped you. And you’ll be stuck with me and it just can’t—”
Dean immediately extended his right arm, opening his hand, demanding his keys back.
“Cas, I don’t know how to say this without sounding like a dick, but you being here or not, it doesn’t change anything. Just like me helping you out or not.”
He took a deep breath and said, “Promise you won’t laugh?”
So, reluctantly, but with the firm belief that it was for his best well-being, he stayed away.
He was convinced it was a terrible idea. This wasn’t his style, and as far as he knew, it wasn’t Sam’s, either.
Balthazar: I’m gonna need visual proof.
Their last conversation. Castiel’s terrifying state. Castiel’s goodbye.
So much so that Dean almost grew anxious of his reply.
Dean shook his head. “My father was a blacksmith and Mom manned the shop when she could.”
Even if the gym was literally on his way home and that it was a very short distance.
“He doesn’t get the right to end you. Or to let you go. Not you.”
Given his first impression of Dean, Castiel had been floored by how open and trusting Dean turned out to be with him on their barbeque night.
Castiel gathered that Dean must have had reservations about his decision, but he hadn’t commented on the matter with the exception of encouraging Castiel to work wherever he would feel comfortable, just as he had promised.
Nothing.
He wasn’t feeling sick, either.
Dean trembled again.
Dean flinched. “What? No, Lisa. No, you didn’t do anything wrong. God. No, I’m the dirt bag here, not you.” He took a breath. “Look, honestly—and I really mean, honestly—when I heard you were single again, I was thrilled. Going out with you was—I couldn’t believe my luck. I told you that on Wednesday and I meant it. But, um,” he paused, clearing his throat, “something happened. And everything just got—I should have told you. I didn’t because I thought I was just freaking out and I—I guess I was afraid of what it really meant. And I was afraid of thinking I’d miss out on the chance to finally be with you. I knew I would have kicked myself if I—so I didn’t say anything. And now I ended up ruining everything anyway.”
“That doesn’t worry you?”
Broaching that particular topic reminded Castiel of Sam’s odd comment regarding Dean’s previous roommates. He wondered if yielding the conversation in that direction was a wise decision or not. After all, what mattered was that they were both (and apparently Sam as well) content with the housing arrangement.
Just as Castiel had expected.
Dean lifted his eyes at him.
“Oh, I know that. But then again, as those two adorable knuckleheads keep repeating to me, if it’s pointless, what do I have to lose if I tag along?”
While Dean was cleaning out Elliot Ness’ stall, Castiel was brushing the horse’s coat and telling him about their afternoon, notably that Dean had fallen on his butt no less than five times, which made Dean chuckle as he finished his task.
Small, but practical.
Castiel gave Dean some space, as he had pledged to do, and hadn’t brought up anything regarding their fight, what Dean had said, or even Henry’s letter.
They had been on that street before.
Dean lifted his eyes to the mirror to meet Castiel’s.
They finally made it past the table and stood in a corner by themselves. Dean faced him.
And although he wanted nothing more than the warmth of Dean’s touch all over him, he knew if he didn’t keep his composure in check, all this would be done and over quickly.
“Morning,” said Dean, grinning from ear to ear. “Why didn’t you wake me?”
But after some time, Castiel wasn’t so sure that was the main issue after all. Dean was constantly in a bad mood whenever Mr. Adler would show up at the ranch. What particularly alarmed Castiel about Mr. Adler’s visits, however, was that Dean always made a point that Castiel would be extremely busy and far away from the main building whenever the man would show up.
“Dean,” he said, trying to wake him up once he was back. “Dean, get up.”
Aware that he needed to elaborate, Castiel looked at Dean again and said, “No, not because it was—I mean, what I did. Like… how—” And he let out a deep sigh, and then said, “Dean, I, um, I bit you.”
“Nope,” said Gabriel, happily sipping on his coffee. “Sam didn’t tell me anything.”
His sole comfort, save perhaps his very brief conversation with Dean, had been Gabriel’s daily texts. Which always made him smile.
“Well, that would have meant incompetence on their part and they are very proud people.”
“You can send it to her yourself if you want,” said Castiel, almost amused. “Or better yet, do you prefer calling her?”
Sam shook his head again, to which Castiel nodded in acknowledgement.
“I’m okay. I think. But somebody was here. They were in my room and they ran out. I think they went out by the patio door in the living room.”
Dean was about to protest, but Castiel showed him his tag behind his ear. The gatekeeper sighed and gestured for his colleague, who had creepily managed to slide himself right behind Castiel and Dean, to come take a look.
The goddamn moment when everything changed.
He nodded.
“What happened to your suit?”
“The Winchester Ranch is not the only place where things are brewing.”
“We’ll be there.”
His eyes snapped open.
. Which was better than most. Starting from there, I followed the breadcrumbs.” Crossing his arms over his chest, Gabriel then added, “As for why he is simply tracking you instead of gunning for your heads, I’m sure he has his reasons, but he wasn’t in a sharing mood regarding that part. I have a feeling that he’ll introduce himself soon enough.”
With nothing else to do but stare at each other awkwardly.
So, he tried to act as normally as he could.
In other words, Castiel had woken up before the
“So, based on the schedule,” he said, observing one of the numerous convention’s advertisements displayed in the room, “what would you like to do? What’s the next panel?”
“What are you doing?”
Dean came to a halt. “How? I don’t have a car. We can’t possibly succeed doing all this in an hour without a car.”
Sam made a face.
He knew this was him, but he didn’t recognize this man. Even thinking back on his lowest points in life, he couldn’t place him. This wasn’t self-righteous, demon blood junkie Sam. This wasn’t even soulless Sam. While some of the details were often still fuzzy on the latter, he nonetheless knew there was a difference. The Boy King wasn’t pretending and he wasn’t impassive.
And again.
Sam and Jessica were still nowhere to be seen, and he kept an eye on Madge’s and Stacey’s location, fearing another ambuscade.
Castiel then broke the kiss to catch his breath, as Dean tried to keep his shit together. After a moment of respite, during which Castiel did nothing but stare at him as though he was assessing Dean’s state, Castiel reached for his hand.
And then Castiel continued folding the paper.
“She’s okay. According to Jody though, she was a bit confused about her whereabouts and that, um, apparently created a situation.”
“Not really. It has an impressive rep, that’s not the problem.”
“No?”
Dean hopelessly stared at Sam, as though it was his fault, but Sam, holding down a grin, shrugged and said, “I think you should take it as a compliment, Dean.”
Dean promised.
Castiel eyed Dean’s lips like never before.
“They’re good. Sam’s a lawyer and lives in town. He’s taller than all of us. And Dean is living on the land, working endlessly on the ranch. He’s helping run the place.”
“Well, if you are truly asking for my input, then I say it depends on how badly you want to remedy this situation. We could do nothing and then be hunted down. Or we could try to find out who did this and why. I can’t promise it will change anything in the end, however, but that option is the most hopeful one.”
And Dean gently rested one hand on Castiel’s.
Following his lead, Dean began unbuttoning Castiel’s shirt, while not missing a chance to press his mouth to Castiel’s skin every time he could.
The kitchen, the living room, and dinning room were all in this massive open area. The living room’s impressive large windows gave view to the woods. A large fireplace with heavy-looking grey and brown stones was occupying the corner of the living room. The seemingly state of the art kitchen contained two ovens, a substantial dark sink, and a large kitchen island with marble countertops of a bronze and white color. There was a long and rustic table in the dinning room, which was situated right next to the living room.
“All yours.” Dean cleared his throat and gunned for his clothes.
Dean let out a short laugh.
Not wishing to betray himself, Dean had let Castiel answer that one, which had been a simple “No,” and Zachariah had simply nodded and moved on to other things.
“Why is the big boss so nagging about this?”
She was standing at the counter, studying the computer screen. She looked up. Her mouth pursed up, and after glancing around quickly, she noticed a costumer was busy looking at one of the flower arrangements on the left side of the shop, so she went back to her computer screen.
He immediately reassured himself with the plan of catching up with his friend during the afternoon break.
He shook his head.
That was when Dean opened his bedroom door. “Cas? What’s happening?” he asked, not quite awake. “Still trouble sleeping?” He rubbed his face, trying to wake himself up.
Thus, listening to the same Christmas music cassette tape, they passed the better part of the afternoon amusing themselves by building gingerbread houses.
“No, no hesitation,” said Sam, cutting him off as he shook his head. And then he added, running his hands on Gabriel’s thighs, “Not about this.”
“When Granddad came back from his trip and told me he ran into you, he had that face like, sit down Dean and let me tell you what your old pal has been up to so far. And I was expecting the
No return address was listed, but the address and his name were handwritten on it. And based on the stamp, Castiel had a pretty good idea what it contained. He thanked Hael, put the letter in the inside pocket of his jacket and left.
Gabriel froze with his cup in hand.
Castiel was genuinely hurt and saddened at the news. Seeing Dean standing in the lobby was already an unexpected event for the day, but learning of Henry Winchester’s death affected him. Even if he hadn’t properly seen the man in so long, knowing he wouldn’t be able to do so ever again was a painful notion.
“How about we go for a walk. We can go to the stables to look for your phone.”
Everything else had been burned, broken, torn down and so on.
You know, for hygienic purposes, of course.
And after letting out a deep sigh and stroking his dog’s head, Dean said, “I hope so, too.”
After the Impala had slowly turned onto the dirt road, it eventually came to halt, in-between the two houses and facing the lake.
And he knew perfectly well he wasn’t the only one struggling with it.
Once there, they stood quietly, side by side, taking in the view of this spot of madness.
That and the fact that he had lied to Castiel the whole damn day.
on the same street he had parked his own car, they headed in that direction slowly, side-by-side.
“How is this my fault? It was your idea to watch it,” said Castiel, grinning at him. “Where are you at now?”
“Huh. Well, now you know. And you’re invited, of course.”
Dean swallowed hard.
Because at this point, Dean was convinced that Castiel was simultaneously a blessing and a curse for him.
“And maybe he’s just making it clear that he doesn’t want to see me,” he said, handling the broom a little more harshly than needed. “You know, like what he told me.”
“Of course. I don’t mind at all. I’m just—I wasn’t expecting that. What do I owe you? I’ll take care of Dean’s too.”
Castiel, smiling, shook his head. “Dean, no.”
“What?”
“Hatred?” said Gabriel, making a face. He let himself fall into one of the cozy armchairs, where a hot cup of tea was waiting for him on the side table beside it. “Cas, come on. I’m sure he doesn’t hate you. Upset with you? Sure. But
Aware that simply putting his phone away would in no way make his friends stop harassing him with questions, however, nor would it solve anything for him either, he resolved himself to answer truthfully.
“Me? Why? I’m fine.”
“How? I—I mean you no offense, I know who I’m talking to, but Gordon is…he won’t back off that easily.”
that and you know it. The demon blood was me barely tapping into it. And it—it wasn’t the demon blood that gave me powers. That was just Ruby manipulating me and taking the shortcut to it because yellow-eyes was gone.”
At the very least, nothing too embarrassing had occurred yet, and every time he had woken up, Dean was either sound asleep next to him, or already up and about.
Listening. Hoping to feel it resonate through his chest.
Gabe: Maybe he’s doing the exact same thing you are and he’s just waiting for you to confirm you feel it too. How about that?
The moment he had taken his seat back and shut the car door as quietly as he could, he asked Dean, “Did you see anything unusual?” There was a hint of distress in his voice. Castiel fixed something inside his jacket that Dean couldn’t properly make out from his vantage point, and then retrieved his phone and began typing quickly. “Dean,” he repeated. “Did you see anything?”
“Why? I’m—”
Confused with their stumble, they both let go of the bat, which rolled away from them.
And soon after, once Castiel had finished with the lights, Rowena handed him a warm cup of apple cider in return for his help. Wrapped in a thick shawl to keep herself warm, she hung a lovely wreath on her front door. She then stepped back, standing next to him, admiring her work.
Dean let out a short, nervous laugh, with his gaze shifting between Sam and Castiel.
Meanwhile, the Ghostfacers, though obviously confused about their surroundings as well, turned their attention to the convention’s schedule.
“I’m fairly certain it does,” said Castiel, amused.
“Good. Now, before I let you go back to your snack, do you want me to tell you in what attire Kevin arrived at the firm today? I wasn’t going to say anything, but it’s actually funny and I think you could use a laugh.”
He wasn’t sure if it was simply his nerves, or because Dean was still hesitant.
Dean, trying to appear indifferent, shook his head.
They both thanked Sam and Jessica for the ride.
But only twice, and he had not been able to interact with him on either of these occurrences.
But knowing that he had to act straight away, for he had no desire to let Castiel slip through his fingers after what had just happened, Dean turned towards him and reached gently for his arm.
“Don’t think so, either. Cas won’t come back here.”
Dean let out a small laugh. “Wait, you—you don’t watch it?”
cause
They had nothing else, so they decided to follow through with the tip.
Nodding, John gestured Castiel to take a seat next to him. He pushed the cookie plate towards Castiel. “Mary’s exhausted. Long hours on her end, too. Sam stayed and watched TV briefly, but he eventually went to his bedroom as well.”
After everything, no way he was sitting this one out. Especially not if he knew where they would be.
So, Dean carried on down the street on his way to his house, praying that it was where Castiel had set off, ignoring the best he could the biting cold on his skin.
Doesn’t that warm your heart or what? I like it.
“I could eat. And I know you certainly can.”
“Yup,” said Dean proudly, taking hold of the pair of gold boxers with printed mistletoe. “That was last year’s present. As a joke, but still.”
Dean shook his head, laughing. “All right. I’ll warm you up.”
Gabriel gripped the ladder, but then let go of it and turned around to face Sam. “And what do we do if Cas shows up?” he said playfully.
I know, even if you need staff to help you around the house and everywhere else, that simple fact does not make a prick out of you. Everyone needs help. Totally agree.
He was tempted to check his phone to see if Hannah had replied. He had been rather occupied since he had texted her, which had left no opportunity to verify.
Dean came to a halt. He bit on his lips.
? I’m—how are you not melting?”
Around lunchtime, however, they decided to go out. From the hatch beneath the floor, Dean retrieved two pairs of skis, poles and boots.
The man was wearing a nice suit. The kind you don’t wear in that type of place or you will stain it.
The pilot gave him a sympathetic look and said, “I know. We were supposed to be spared, but Mother Nature turned on us, as she often does.”
“Come on. Start talking or I’m going to start guessing and I have a big imagination. And a filthy one, at that.”
Dean let out a snort. “For your entertainment, though. Right?”
“Damn it. Bring him back!”
“Cas, you—you don’t look fine.”
“There’s just not much to tell. It’s a job. I go there. Do the work. And they pay me.” He repositioned himself on his seat. “Why do you ask?”
“Fuck. Ye—yes.”
“Right.”
“I thought it was time for a rematch.”
Dean shook his head. “No, don’t stop. I mean—just—”
“What?”
They decided they should each take a shower, and then Castiel would make them something to eat.
Hope you are well.
“Oh no. I’m in trouble,” chanted Dean. He drank the rest of the glass, as Castiel had instructed. Dean shivered. “I’m cold.” He attempted to stand up, but almost fell.
“Of course. We go how you’re both comfortable with. This is your call on how we handle this with Jack. And I’m following your lead. I’ll be there with you if you want. And if you prefer to talk with Jack alone, to see how he is, that’s perfectly fine too, obviously. I—and if—if we need to slow down, that’s fine too, okay? ”
So, he comforted himself that Jody was there to watch over Mary, and until they reached her side, he tried to not let the feeling of victory get the better of him.
For a couple of hours, it felt almost normal, so much so that Dean had fought the urge to reach for Castiel’s hand on more than one occasion.
He knew Castiel had understood.
“Cas started to run out of clean clothes a couple of days ago and we cannot reach the washing machine downstairs and—anyway, Mom suggested we share with Cas in the meantime. And today she handed him Dean’s favourite shirt. And Dean doesn’t know.”
“You mean the personal quarters of the Levis on the station?”
“May I suggest an approach to your method? Since you’re shy.”
And knowing how Dean felt about that particular subject, Castiel worried about his reaction.
“Dean, I’m not lying. I don’t—” began saying Sam, still puzzled.
He wasn’t sure how much detail he would give her, but he knew that he ought to put an end to it.
“Depends if you were exclusive or not, and I’m asking because I seem to recall a familiar face who returned once or twice.”
“Cas, can we just—can you please forget everything that happened? Can we just pretend like yesterday never happened and just go back to how we were before?”
“Yup. Sam says hello.”
As subtly as he could, Dean pulled his underwear’s waistband upwards, so as to reveal enough of the fabric so Castiel could discern the angels. And the moment he noticed Castiel’s expression change, Dean knew he had succeeded and quickly fixed his clothes and coat.
“I just—I don’t—” Dean cleared his throat, eyeing Castiel’s lips.
“You didn’t,” he told Dean. “It wasn’t your fault. It was mine.” Dean frowned as he watched Sam lowering his eyes to the ground. “The only reason why Gordon caught me was because I…I sneaked out of the apartment. I shouldn’t have. And I only did because I—I was mad that you just kept to yourself and I—it was so stupid.”
“What’s wrong?” he repeated, now incredibly worried.
The place was packed. Apparently, Gabriel had not only invited the entire school, but probably a few others as well from nearby towns, plus every one he had ever met in his life. Dean wondered how in the world he was going to find anyone in this sea of people.
Gabe: In that case, I’ll do everything in slow-motion.
He looked ahead, down the hallway, knowing that he should ignore the Boy King.
Even if they still didn't know what or where they were.
But he wasn’t with his parents and the grown-ups overseeing the party that day had been very clear: no wandering off from the lane, except to go to the bathroom, which had to be accompanied by an adult.
Jack shrugged.
He spread his legs slightly and bent over the couch. His stomach against the cushions, he lifted his butt as much as he could, while Castiel applied a generous layer of lube over his cock and some around Dean’s butthole.
Dean quickly climbed off the bed with the idea of sliding underneath it for safety measures. But he barely had time to stand up before being hit with a massive headache. His legs momentarily gave out and his knees hit the floor. It was so powerful, he nearly hurled.
Dean was evidently freaking out. Not only because
“Did you ever hear of the story where Michael locked Lucifer and Naomi out of the house for the night? Because it is not only worth hearing for the comic aspect of it, but I think it could help us.”
Some of the town’s most notorious inquisitive minds.
“Told you what?”
“Gabe? What happened?”
Castiel shifted on his feet. “I’ll restrain from apologizing again because I fear I’ll simply embarrass myself. But, please, know that I really didn’t mean to deceive you. Or offend you. And if—”
“You seem surprised and upset,” said Dean, studying his face.
Made of soft woven silk.
“Dad, you’re already here. I—I’ll take the bus and go myself. Or I’ll help you today and deal with this tomorrow. I could—”
He bit his bottom lip, thinking. “Are you leaving?”
Castiel bit his lips and turned on his heels, following Zachariah.
“This,” she said, gesturing to the room, as she smiled at him. “It feels like you.”
And then, there was the gift in question.
“I know. I had to do something extreme. Maybe Cas will have to take everything off now. His coat, sweater and shirt.”
He then slid his hand along Dean’s ribs, down to his waist, caressing his skin. Feeling the goosebumps, and Dean stirring his legs, Castiel grabbed the bottle of lube and applied quickly another layer on his cock to ensure Dean’s comfort.
Silence.
Castiel was worried. He didn’t like unexpected guests. No one had ever asked for him by name. Nearly all his friends worked at the hotel, therefore leaving no surprises there, and the few others he had outside of work had no reason to show up unannounced.
Without saying goodbye.
Cas: Don’t hold your breath, but I’ll think about it.
“So how has it been with Cas at your house?” asked Gabriel, after taking another bite.
“What kind of gift were you thinking of?” she asked, utterly invested.
So he turned back his attention back to Crowley.
Castiel.
“I don’t want to hear it,” he firmly said and do I dare say, fucking stubbornly. “It’s way too late for that. Look, you kinda saved my bacon today, so fine. But don’t think I don’t know who and what you are. I remember very well. And you were still in that cryo pod for a reason.”
Or even a scratch on him.
Castiel held his breath and instantly felt his heart pounding. Trying to remain calm, he slowly lifted his eyes, and saw Dean, standing in front of him.
He swore loudly.
“Right. Thanks.” Dean patted Benny on the shoulder and hurried through the crowd with great difficulty and extreme annoyance. He eventually reached the staircase and climbed to the second floor, hoping Castiel would still be there.
Castiel turned around abruptly, surprised to find Jack in the kitchen with him. “Hey. What is it?”
Startled, Castiel opened his eyes and found Dean staring at him.
Until he heard someone whistling.
She froze. “You want to find Lucifer?” She let out a small nervous laugh. “Castiel, I thought—you always maintained that what happened wasn’t your fault and—”
That was when Castiel, in light of what Gabriel had just told him, suddenly had an idea.
“S’okay,” he said, wrapping his arms around his neck.
“We can walk around and look for the both of them. Maybe they aren’t far and we can find them before curfew,” suggested Sam. “But the only problem with that is that if Cas shows up at the house when we’re out looking for him—”
“She kept checking the clock in her kitchen. And eyeing the living room window. Not the front door,
Just as he was about to open the door, he heard Castiel say, “Good night, Dean.”
“I could lend you one of mine if you want? It would fit you. But I tell you, there is absolutely nothing wrong with yours.”
She turned to Castiel and said, “Keep an eye on that fool. He might stand a chance that way.”
“Dean. Wait, he—I think he might be right.”
“Don’t,” Dean assured him. “It’s no problem. I swear I don’t hold it against you.”
The fact was that the crisis had been averted, yet again.
“Is he, though?”
,” said Gabriel. “You said you would help me with my errands and putting this thing together. That was the deal.”
Benny stopped everything he was doing feeling Dean’s stare on them.
The only other possibility, reflected Castiel, would be a family member.
Sam: Dean freaked because I knew something he didn’t.
Frowning, something was still bothering Jo. “Why not ask Rowena? If anyone knows who he is, it would be her, no?”
He had done so in good faith.
“Why?”
There was a pregnant pause. “Sorry, the what?”
“Uh-huh.”
“Thank you for the lift home.”
Dean’s eagerness almost made Castiel laugh. “There’s no hurry. I’m not going anywhere.”
“Here. It’s all here,” said Dean. He cautiously extended his left hand towards Sam. “Now, just—let go of him and we’re out of here. Okay?”
“All right, son. It usually takes us four days. Come back any time after that.”
Dean lost his balance for a second as his left knee gave out.
He’s a bit slow in the morning.
But after a quick introduction, I was glad that it wasn’t like that at all. And what they requested of me, the location of Lucifer, was an absolute shocker.
,” said Gabriel, kissing her hand.
“Don’t laugh, but I was watching
Dean shook his head. “No. I—I know I need to be alert. So, thumbs up for coffee.”
“Actually, I’m covered for that part. I still have my duffel bag in my trunk. I—last night, well, I’ll explain later. The important part is that I can properly participate.”
He cautiously watched the street, and while there wasn’t any suspicious activity, Dean couldn’t shake that awful gut-feeling that something wasn’t right.
As the fourth hour was coming to a close, however, Dean woke up briskly, gripping the blanket.
It was a beautiful day with the sun shining high and the perfect weather for an outdoor activity.
Awkwardly, Dean had pointed in Castiel’s direction. “The one with the blue shirt.”
But to Castiel’s disappointment, Dean didn’t show up for dinner. Castiel tried calling him, and sadly all his calls were directly sent to voicemail.
Sam: I know!
“Tell me.”
either, Dean was simultaneously furious and happy about it.
“What happened?”
And once Castiel had finally settled next to him, Dean had made sure to keep his eyes on his brother and Gabriel, desperate to hear what was going on.
“No, I mean, I knew.
Their teacher, Zachariah Adler, who insisted that his students call him Mr. Zach, was, despite what his self-appointed nickname may have suggested, a real asshole. He had a strict no-speaking policy and demanded absolute focus from his students.
Winchester. And just where do you think you’re going, young man?”
His heart stopped.
And that, surprisingly, he had been looking forward to meeting Dean.
Nearly craving.
“Really?” said Dean. “I—wow. I’m sorry, I don’t mean
“Ugh. Sam!”
“Cas, what would you prefer? Being honest and finally knowing or just continuing to pretend and be left guessing?”
“I can’t say. The fact that I could before and that being here had its limits then is not reassuring.”
“Assholes, then,” said Dean.
Whatever this was, however, Dean had never reacted to it as strongly as he just had before.
“Wait, I don’t—what is this? What book is this from?” Sam asked Gabriel, as he leaned to his ear.
Then they carried on outside towards the stables slowly.
I know the hardest thing to do is to let the people we love go for their own well-being, as well as for our own. But do not think that their decision—or circumstances forcing them—to stay away automatically implies their lack of love for you.
“Yes, of course. No question there. I’m even surprised he didn’t split it in two with Sam. But Sam, of course, is fine with it considering I’m the one who works at the ranch. And like I said, we’re really lucky. We won’t want for anything. The, um, the only thing missing is the ranch. Technically speaking, he left that to me as well. There was just one condition attached to it.”
“Why didn’t you just bring him to his room?” asked Gabriel, puzzled.
“Lisa.”
“Oi! Really, yes! You think I’d blame my mischief on your sweet angel?”
“Where to, Cas?”
“That now Dean knows the truth,” said Gabriel, after clearing his throat. “Which was what you wanted. Right?”
Yeah, so not at all what they had expected. In fact,
“Freshly pressed orange juice?” he offered. “I was just about to make coffee too.”
One woman installed herself cozily on Castiel’s lap and started kissing his neck.
“Hey, Cas,” said Dean. “
Once home, Castiel had been in charge of setting up the board games, while Sam had dropped a million pillows on one of the couches. He had then pushed some of the furniture in the living room around to gain a lot of space, just like he and Dean used to do in the days when forts were involved.
“Yes. Everyone is very charming and patient. It’s almost unsettling to meet so many people eager to not only work with me, but simply talk with me at all.”
Sam had said all this rather quickly, and Castiel couldn’t help but notice that Sam was blushing by the end of his little proposal.
Dean bit on his lips and shrugged. “I—I don’t really feel like it.”
Just like his brother, though unbeknownst to him, Dean had had an overwhelming couple of days before Christmas.
“You could have let them be in the hot tub,” said Sam to Gabriel, amused. “Pretty sure they, um, wouldn’t have missed us.”
And Castiel shook his head. “But you don’t know that, Dean. I—”
“What do you mean?”
wouldn’t slack. Giving Samuel a reason to complain, or worse, become suspicious, wasn’t Dean’s intention.
when he had gotten Castiel’s phone call just a few days ago.
For any of them.
?” he said, lifting the phone. “Sorry, but you just lost all credibility here.”
“Daddy had a weird morning.”
As I am writing this letter, I will try my best to remedy this as soon as I can. But in case I didn’t succeed as well as I hoped, or for whatever reason I may have failed, Dean, don’t be afraid to go for the best scenario, even if it doesn’t seem likely. You don’t owe me anything. You do not owe anyone anything.
“Hey!”
Castiel and Dean, after glancing at each other, advanced at a slow pace towards him. And glared at him.
Just by looking at him, Dean knew he had voiced what Castiel had feared saying out loud.
“Or course. See you both very soon,” he snarled.
“Anna is right. It was just what the evening needed. It’s quite a pity that Gabriel did not grant us his presence,” said Amara. “I ought to have a serious discussion with this boy about what he owes this family.”
“You don’t say anything anymore,” he repeated. “Not just about your new job, but about
“But did you ask her out before that night?” asked Dean, not letting him finish his sentence.
It took Castiel a few seconds to react, but shortly after, Dean felt his strong arms wrap around him tightly. Castiel deepened the kiss with ardor, opening his mouth, and welcoming anything that Dean was offering.
“All right,” he said, after he had reflected on the matter, “I’ll tell you who did this to me. Dean. He did it.”
His heartbeat was increasing.
“So, what do you suggest we do now?” asked Castiel. “Pretending that we are indifferent is evidently futile. But this is dangerous. We may have been lucky so far, but that won’t always be the case.”
And tried to ignore that little voice inside his head telling him he had made a mistake.
On his arrival, Castiel let out a sigh. He jumped in the shower. He changed himself quickly.
“Hey! Sorry, Sam seems to have lost the ability to speak. Might be my fault,” he said, not looking remotely sorry. “So, you’re Dean! Hello! Good to put a face to a name,” he said, waving. “And a voice,” he added, winking at him.
Dean’s hands migrated to the front of his pants, and after one look at Castiel for approbation, he unbuckled his belt and pulled down his pants.
“Sam? Everything all right?”
A curse box appeared at Asmodeus’ feet.
“Dean?”
“A party?”
“A friend.”
“Easy, asshole,” said the guy holding Castiel. “We don’t want him dead.
Beaming at Castiel like a fool, Dean said goodbye once more before leaving the shop. He didn’t complain once on the way to the house.
He listened, and through the blowing wind, and the branches brushing against one another, and the snow grazing the ground before being lifted into the air, he then heard it.
“Saw them how?” asked John.
“Thanks. Same.”
“Sam, could you—a little privacy, please?” He handed over one of the bags to his brother, hoping for him to leave them alone.
There’s no clear knowledge how this change came to be, but my guess is that something dramatic happened a few centuries ago, and well, um, let’s just say a lot of the guests probably asked for a refund.
Castiel lowered his eyes for a moment. “That’s not why I’m here, Dean. Breaking the Oath won’t accomplish anything except severing our bond and I don’t want that. Because of so many things, I feel tethered to this mountain. The same way you are because of our bond. This is why Hunters slowly disconnect with the outside world. I’m the reason. I change the Hunters as I once did all those centuries ago. So, before you get any ideas, do not feel guilty. And instead of seeing yourself as my guard, think of it as simply being my companion. That’s much closer to the truth of how I feel about you and the Hunters’ purposes than anything else.”
“Okay. I—I’m not sure how, but I’ll make it work.”
Curiously enough, because he didn’t look the type, Balthazar was well known at the hotel for his so-called skills in dream interpretations. Being a bartender, and a charming, cocky one at that, this helped him tremendously cozying up to the customers.
Unless Dean was planning on being crass, Castiel deduced that if he had brought someone home, they wouldn’t have stopped in the living room. They would have simply headed to Dean’s bedroom.
The only problem was
. I never did. And aren’t you—that debt has been settled anyway so why  are you still harassing me for it? And what the fuck are you doing with my brother’s phone?”
Sam and Dean cut themselves on their arms, dropping some blood, while Castiel did the same for his grace with a small incision to his throat. Despite the fact that he gave just enough for the spell to work, and not nearly enough to cause himself permanent damage, Dean still flinched when he watched him do it.
Perhaps more than he would like to admit.
Dean froze on his spot.
“It annoys me. What’s so complicated to understand about that?”
anything
Almost as if he was purposely avoiding deep topics and wanted to keep things simple.
And then, despite Castiel calling his name, Dean took a step towards Deanmon and rested his gun directly against his forehead.
Dean knew that this was John’s attempt to give him his space in the hope that it would allow him to simply say once and for all what the hell his problem was, instead of having to extract the information from him.
Dean nodded. “That’s true. That’s…at least you tried.”
“The only way you could hope for this outcome, I think, is to ask them for permission. But as you might have guessed, not everyone is in a position to be asking for favours, never mind seeing them be granted. You must have a good opportunity and the track record to go with it. So, as I said,
“My parents passed away years ago. Car accident. And it’s just us, no grandparents or uncles and aunts. So, Sam and I usually try to make a point of doing something for the holidays together, but it’s getting more complicated every year.”
“If I had changed my mind?”
Following the instructions that he had been given earlier that day, Dean continued all the way to the end of Host Street and took the back alley to reach the secondary entrance of
“What do you—” Sam had begun saying, which Dean appreciated him trying to play dumb, but he knew that now was not the time. So, he pulled on his arm gently, shot him a quick look, and then looked at his grandfather.
Castiel froze. “How did—”
awaiting them back home.
And once everything was in order, they slowly made their way back inside. Dean only lit up one small light on his nightstand. More than that would have almost felt aggressive to their eyes in the calm state they were both in.
“About what?”
His eyes then fell on the multiple frames resting on Jack’s dresser and Dean, curious, stepped over to have a closer look.
Dean had felt a pang to his chest at that thought.
But this change wasn’t solely visual. It was so in terms of the overall vibe of his home, too.
“That’s…I’ll do my best.”
Dean had to suppress a frown. “Yeah. You didn’t know that?”
His job. Hannah. The city. The ranch. Dean. Student loans. Marriage.
With their elbows touching.
"Technically, I didn't call him. He called me."
“Cas, I’m fine. You need sleep,” repeated Dean.
And from the looks of it, Venandi had even brought friends along with them to join the party.
While admiring the bright orange sunset reflecting on the still lake.
“He didn’t,” urged Sam. “Dean, I swear to you, nothing is going on with Cas and me. Never has.”
Dean snorted. “I don’t think I can.”
“Dean—”
“Okay, and then?”
Dean swallowed. “Anything else? Like when I pick you up or when I wait for your appointment to be done. Any advice? I just don’t want to fuck up.”
, noticed Castiel.
“No freaking way. What? This is—this is—”
A fact that amplified his apprehension of the night to come.
“You—you don’t understand. I—no. Don’t make me. I—why are you trusting him?”
“Considering Jack, you mean,” laughed Castiel. He paused a moment. “Kelly and I never dated. And it had never been a ‘friends with benefits’ situation, either. It wasn’t what either of us wanted, too. It was platonic.” He took a short pause. “Except for one night.”
“Cas. I know you’re there.” He felt a finger poke him on his side.
Feeling suddenly exposed, Castiel anxiously looked around him as though he needed to monitor any additional potential threat.
The taste of Castiel’s lips. The sound of his graveled voice breathing his name. His soft skin pressed against his.
“That’s because I know how this place operates.”
Dean took a deep breath.
Two long, dark horns sprouted from Deanmon’s head. Actual horns.
And while Castiel knew that he had the right to express his sentiments to Dean, and that he probably should if he didn’t want to kick himself until the end of time, he also understood that after everything Dean had gone through, it would almost be selfish of him to do so.
Thank you for reading!! Sorry for the intermission of Sam and Gabe's night lol. Part two will be tomorrow and we needed a mini update on Dean (and Cas) lol.
Sam: Last night.
Castiel studied him for a moment, and then smoothly eased his chair closer to Dean’s. He mildly lifted his hand, and barely grazing his skin, Castiel ran his fingertips on the back of Dean’s hand. To his wrist. His arm. And by the time he reached his shoulder (which was his right—uninjured—one), his entire hand slid past it, up to his neck.
Isn’t that fucking great?
And everyone became silent.
? And what do you mean by ‘other rules?’”
Sam and Dean knew better than to protest.
“I just—it feels like a trap and I don’t like it.”
Castiel nodded and Dean presented him another fruit he had retrieved from his jacket. Just as Castiel was about to extend his arm slowly to Dave Mather, the horse in the next stall neighed loudly at them.
Wondering if he had misunderstood.
Castiel, now satisfied that Dean was indeed enjoying himself, continued rolling his hips at a steady pace. His fingers tightened their grip on Dean’s legs, and moans were escaping him at the blissful sensation of sliding his cock into him.
Their first stop was at a luxurious townhouse, near downtown. As soon as Dean parked the vehicle in front of the house, Castiel opened the door and told Dean he wouldn’t be long.
Without commenting directly on that detail, Castiel asked Dean what he liked the most about these options, and why he had picked them, hoping to confirm his hypothesis. Dean immediately blurted out an incredible amount of information concerning each and every place. From activities they could do, to how delicious the food was supposed to be. His main focus point, however, seemed to lie with the hotels. Their quality of service. How spacious the rooms were. What the hotel offered. Every destination was paired up with a specific hotel, and Castiel rapidly understood that Dean hadn’t chosen a town to visit and then looked up the most appealing place to stay. It had been the other way around. He had chosen the hotels first, and then researched the towns.
Enough to give him hope that Dean shared his feelings.
Yes, the man had just made a joke.
He went to bed, upset at the idea that he had, indeed, ruined everything, and that the sooner he accepted it, the sooner he could perhaps get over it.
“We were never really close. We had our moments, but…Michael, last time I heard, was in Japan. That was random news I received last summer, I think. I know Anna is somewhere in France. She’s married and lives with some Englishman who…I have no idea. She’s very vague with the details. No one has any idea where Gadreel is. He tends to move around a lot. He’s not…Gadreel has had issues. But the fact that we don’t hear too much from him is oddly comforting. It’s when the news come rolling in that it is cause for concern. And Lucifer, well, we all know where Lucifer is. And he’s going to stay there for a quite long while. Twenty to life, depending on good behavior or overcrowding issue, I suppose.”
Or just raided the place like maniacs?
Hurrying up the stairs, with Whiskey trotting behind him, Jack then said, “Come! I’ll show you my room!”
Dean made a face at his suggestion. “It will fit.”
But in not sharing his experience, not mentioning him by name to anyone else, and the fact that no one knew he even existed—not in that way, anyway—made Dean feel like his whole experience and love for him was cheapened. He knew it wasn’t. He knew it didn’t take anything away from them and that what they had was real.
“What happened?”
As was usually the case, his journey back took longer. Climbing up the mountain demanded more effort than going down. Dean took a few breaks along the way to catch his breath. His left leg, which had been aching a lot more lately, hadn’t simplified his task, either. Nor did the bag of supplies he was carrying back with him.
“Prisoner 401918 did?”
Castiel politely did the same and heard Dean call his name.
Gabriel: And why aren’t you trying anything with handsome roommie?
That last one hadn’t been a scenario. It had happened and Dean wanted to experience that moment on an infinite loop.
“We can stay if you want.”
After a good half hour of riding, Castiel was positive they had passed every additional property (old or new) on the land, and since Dean remained silent on the subject, he then gave up trying to guess where Dean was taking them and simply enjoyed their outing.
“Thank you, goes right to the heart,” said Dean. He slid his arm under Castiel’s, pulling him away from them, and said, “If you don’t mind, my husband and I have some other people we need to thank.”
Dean’s expression had been unreadable. Namely because he didn’t seem to have one. He wasn’t shocked. Nor joyous. Nor angry. Nor confused.
“Which means no one would expect me to be here.”
“No, never mind.”
“Look at it this way,” said Crowley, “even if you had stayed, it seems that drama was inevitable and you would have suffered the same—well, a similar—fate.”
Castiel and Mary were seated at the table.
“I—I don’t know. I’m—we get along, no problem, like you said. But—” Castiel paused again.
But still nothing.
Nothing. As if it had never happened.
“And what you want should be considered too, Dean.”
“I am so gonna fucking regret this,” he groaned.
He was still wearing the same pickle green jacket and he appeared to be unharmed.
“No,” sighed Dean. “I just—I thanked him, but refused. Obviously. I told him of my holiday plans and that I had no intentions of changing anything. And we talked and—well, it seems like it’s…done now.”
When Castiel emerged from a deep and restful sleep, the sun was already up. Without opening his eyes, he immediately knew Dean was awake. The absence of his snores told him so.
“Get comfy, boys. I’m just getting started. Now, shall we?”
He reached the door and found himself face-to-face with Castiel.
Castiel bit his lips, and after a brief contemplation, he said, “I—I have—are you free this Saturday?”
Once their meal was over and that Sam and Castiel had cleared off the table, Mary thanked them for their help and shooed them both away from the kitchen and dining room to take care of the rest herself.
Even if none of it had been their fault.
“So, you—you—look I know we…it’s not like—nothing had actually happened between us, but what were you planning on doing? I mean, if Ishim had never showed up.”
Dean snapped his fingers, while faintly shifting on his feet and nodding to the beat.
“I was going to. But you were talking with all your friends. And I hadn’t seen you since the day you left. It would have been weird. I didn’t know what to say. Except maybe congratulations, but that sounded too—and then I realized that I had to leave.”
And did nothing.
Satisfied that their parents weren’t paying attention to them, Sam said in a low voice, “Look, I’m sorry, Dean. I—I get how this seems to you and I—I’ll explain some things later, but for now, please, listen to me. I promise you that nothing happened between Cas and me. Nothing. Cas wasn’t here last night. I didn’t even know what had happened yesterday until you said it to Mom and Dad. Cas himself didn’t say anything about it when we—Gabriel and I—spoke to him briefly last night.” Dean frowned and was about to ask questions, but before he could, Sam added, “We just spoke to him on the phone once we couldn’t find either of you, but he hung up pretty fast. And the coat—the only reason why Cas’ coat is here is because we found it on the bathroom floor when we went to look for him.”
“And what about whoever you’ll hand me over to?”
What could he possibly tell them?
“Dean. What’s up?” She picked up one of the mini-boxes of chocolate and said, “Want one? I’m supposed to make sure everyone who passes by gets one of these. Freebies.”
“How are your cooking skills?” asked Dean.
The only things Dean wished to end were the shady jobs and Sam’s—and therefore his—restriction to this city.
“Yes,” he finally said. “I’d like that very much, Gabriel.”
And yet, Dean took the time to browse the place. To look at his pictures and drawings on his fridge. To examine the pile of second hand books by the couch, waiting to be read.
Fearing a trap, Dean had simply shoved the card in his jacket pocket and put the matter out of his mind. With the chaos at the garage, he already had enough problems to deal with. He wasn’t in a hurry to add another to the list.
He also informed him that he had administered a mild sedative to Sam for the pain.
“There’s nothing to explain. Everything is actually pretty clear.”
He had remained exactly in the same spot. He hadn’t moved an inch, even when Castiel had slid next to him for a better view of Gabriel and Sam.
His eyes set on Dean, and his smile brightened, nearly making Dean blush on the spot.
“December starts tomorrow and it’s already insane. And answer the question.”
Not to mention the state of crisis the firm had found itself in over the week.
Finally meeting Sam’s eyes, he nodded at him. “I—I just don’t understand what happened. Who—who were they?”
After helping him out with some quick cleaning up, Castiel threw the cloth into his dirty laundry basket, let his towel fall to the ground, and slid himself under the covers, against his warm body.
And then he played the last note, and just like that, it was over.
“What now?” said Mary.
Castiel remembered Mary leaving the ranch every other day in the morning during the summer.
“What the hell,” breathed Dean.
“I agree that individual interaction would be a better advantage to get our points across,” said Castiel. “But since Gabriel is waiting for us, with Chuck and Becky, in the dining area, I suggest that we take the opportunity to collectively try right now. It is under my understanding that sharing a meal is the perfect setting for a discussion.” And then, as though he realized what he was saying, he added, “Even if Gabriel is evidently not human…”
“You’re welcome the whole day, I—I don’t know if—”
Gabriel, squinted at him. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s what we are doing right now.”
Missouri looked at him, curiously. “You don’t know who and what he is?”
Castiel frowned. “You mean, rethinking everything?”
And Castiel nodded, biting his lips.
“How long have you been standing there?”
“You are crazy,” said Castiel, laughing. “Dean is officially going out with Lisa now.” He let out a sigh that made Sam feel for him. “I don’t think I need other proof than that.”
And a note waiting for him.
“It is. And you know it.”
“You need to eat. I’m hungry. And I need a shower,” argued Castiel, as Dean was kissing his neck. “You’re invited, you know.”
The temptation of simply reaching out.
But he also didn’t want to pry. Dean was entitled to his privacy—something he had not often been granted from the rest of the town.
Dean shut his eyes with anguish, inhaling deeply.
The main one being that, to the best of his knowledge, Dean Winchester had no interest whatsoever in serious relationships.
The second the curtain fell behind them, a brunette woman was being handsy all over Castiel’s chest, who had zero issue with it, while Dean was gently trying to protest against the black-haired woman who was running her hands over him. Because he’s proper like that.
“Right.”
“My brother Sam,” said Dean, imitating him. Castiel nodded, having expected Dean’s answer. “I’d like to find something for Bobby, my boss. And a couple of my friends. Nothing extensive.”
Castiel.
They stayed in that fashion for some time, until Castiel hoisted himself on his elbow to look at Dean properly.
They had broached the topic of their first holiday on a few occasions during dinner. Unfortunately, these discussions never ended with a precise plan. They mostly just talked around it.
“I hope he’s worth it, Cas, because you’re pretty much done back home. I ran into Naomi when I was at the Lazarus. She asked me if I knew when you’d be back. I thought that was odd considering you told me you had applied for a six months leave. And I told her that and that I was under the impression that you two kept in touch.”
“Not that I’m reproaching you or anything,” said Castiel, “but there were
Certainly more times than he would like to admit.
“What for? I—why do you say that?”
“We’ll make sure that you can see your friend after the match, okay? But not right now.”
After their short drive from the station to Tulpa, Dean parked the truck in front of a cabin, which was three cabins down from the general store. Pilot Lafitte, or Benny, as Dean kept calling him, thanked his friend for the lift and wished them both a goodnight, before turning on his heels promptly.
“I think so, too.”
“And as I keep repeating to your poor puppets, what does it matter? Besides, you’re one to talk,
I took in the heavy décor of the thick drapes, columns and ostentatious paintings of himself. I mean, poor Lucy was evidently trying to compensate for something.
Dean nodded. Everybody knew that.
If you ask him today, he won’t admit it, but I know these things, and that’s what he thought in that moment.
“What is it?”
There's still a lot left to happen. Ahem.
“What’s going on?”
think about that when you run off to your dear brother and his angel to save your skin.”
Nevertheless, he didn’t comment on it, simply sighed loudly and asked them if they had chosen their cereal already.
“Yes.
“How did you manage to get me out of cryo? Had you ever operated one of those pods before?”
Everyone else seemed to know each other and blissfully occupied themselves with their toys.
Dean swallowed hard, and his eyes were red, though no tears were visible.
“But—”
“Did you just arrive, Dean? Sam’s downstairs.”
And they were all over Dean’s newly acquired wall.
, but you know—then, yeah. I might get a bit upset.”
Dean grew fond of his company.
“Dean?”
And then Dean felt the pull in his heart.
They also thought they would be able to admire it best while sitting on the couch.
Smiling warmly, she turned back to Dean and continued with the check-in registration.
Relief spread throughout his face.
Sweet, with a distinct taste of cinnamon, but not too overpowering, and a perfect flaky, buttery crust.
And so, less than ten minutes later, carrying a tray filled with four hot chocolates, Castiel pushed the door open, aided by Jack, as they were eagerly greeted by Whiskey.
“I know. How can you make it bad? It’s like he’s doing it on purpose.”
“Sure thing, honeypie.”
“It—it might be more than just cover for me with Samuel, though.”
“Count me in, then.”
The elevator doors opened behind him, and after glimpsing them, Sam asked, “Can it wait? I was just—I have—”
Plus Rowena, of course.
Thank you for reading! Hope you enjoyed it!!
Touched at the gesture, Dean continued gaping at him, and spent the next few minutes listening carefully to every note, and feeling every movement and emotion, until the tune came to an end.
He was seated quietly in his office, lost in his thoughts, when he came across a drawing that had been tucked at the bottom of his lunch bag. A drawing that depicted him and Jack flying a kite in a wintery scene (which Castiel had deduced by their seemingly winter attire and no flowers or grass had been drawn).
“I want you to leave.”
“Unless, you have an even better suggestion?”
“Well, yes. Although, Garrison, Co. is not
“Yes, what?” he said, putting the phone back to his ear.
Amused at his brother’s weird interest, Dean shook his head. And while he had other questions regarding Sam’s opinion on Castiel’s presents, his train of thought took a turn when something else occurred to him.
Balthazar made a point of checking up on him on a daily basis, and often insisted on Castiel meeting him so he would have fresh air, instead of keeping himself cooped up in his apartment.
So, the young brothers had had to leave their home, their friends and everything else in Lawrence to move to Samuel’s place. A crummy and compact two-bedroom apartment in Chicago. It was situated right above Samuel’s dry-cleaning business, next to a convenient store, on a busy street.
“Not really. Well—okay, that’s not true. I do have plans. Family is expecting me, and so are many of my friends, but everyone is scattered across the country. And not unlike you, my schedule is a lot, so I always end up making a decision at the last minute.”
Unlike Dean.
He had to.
Even if neither of them had voiced it, Dean was convinced Castiel was thinking the same thing he was.
Flashes. Of tingles. Exploring hands. And soft breaths.
“Oh,” said Zachariah. “Oh,
And staring at him, Dean said softly, “Cas, you can stop by anytime you want. And stay as long as you desire. Your place or my place…in a crowd or just us two…Spending my time with you is—being with you—that’s all I want.”
Sam had been right on one account.
“And nougat on top, right?” asked Ellen.
“Really?”
Resolute to avoid it for the rest of the evening, he shut off everything in the house, took a quick shower in the hope that it would make him feel better, and wearing only thin underwear, he dragged himself to his bed with the firm intention to not leave unless for an emergency.
A woman with long brown hair, and wearing a red cocktail dress, was now standing by the table.
Dean took a deep breath and looked in front of him. “Sam, please, don’t take me for an idiot.”
, he thought. So, he contented himself that the other matter had been dropped.
“Well, part of it,” said Gabriel. He was comfortably leaning on the wall.
Rowena smirked at him.
Don’t worry. We will get back to that. As you may know, secrets usually don’t stay hidden for too long.
And still, as the week slowly passed, he still hadn’t heard from Dean. Nor had he seen much of him, either.
Dean gawked at him. “You remember that?”
“So many things. We still don’t know who was responsible for Cas and Dean’s thing on Purgatory.”
He took notice of his attire. Sliding one hand on the soft fabric of his shirt, he smiled at the sensation. He then turned his attention to Dean, who had simply remained on his spot, unable to do anything else but stare at him. Again.
That was when things got interesting for Team Free Dark, however.
And the idea of a goodbye kiss crept into his mind. But the thought that his first and only kiss with Dean would have been the one of a goodbye kiss, depressed him immensely.
Castiel smiled at the corner of his mouth and said in a low voice, “You want more?”
Sam bit his lips and his eyes turned to Castiel.
“You didn’t,” said Zachariah. “It appears that you both didn’t want to miss this meeting. Which is encouraging considering the circumstances.”
“Right. Not long.” He picked it up and looked at the food again. “How did you—”
Dean’s first thought was to employ caution, and therefore, patience.
Jody wrapped this up quickly afterwards. She asked a few more questions concerning the general security of the ranch and then left to meet Rufus and Garth, who were waiting for her at the front desk. She informed them that she would most likely be back the next day and that if they remembered anything else, they should call her, and that she would do the same if something turned up.
Spending time alone with Castiel, after everything, was definitely high on his to-do list. He had been genuinely happy when Castiel had voiced the desire to go with him.
He heard the elevator doors close behind him, gave Drexel a nod and rushed to his boss’ office.
“I’m fine. I’m enjoying my time. The work is hard and very different than what I’m used to, but I love it.”
It wasn’t until he was deciding which color of icing should he use to decorate the walls, that he realized Dean was still observing him.
“I don’t think it is. Obvious. In any case, not to me. How could it be? The moment I think it might be true, something happens proving the opposite. It’s what always happens. It’s what’s happening right now. Then I simply tell myself it’s because I wanted to see it that way.”
Of course, even if it was raining, he reasoned that he and Castiel could still follow through with their plan. The festival would most likely carry on. But the storm wouldn’t make the experience very pleasant for them and they certainly wouldn’t be tempted to stay for very long.
Seated at the table after their dinner, phone in hand, Dean was about to start calling to cancel everything when Castiel shared an idea.
His journal was now a research log, where he noted every hint he could find from the other journals, from random memories about the legend, or pieces of information Castiel had told him about his life, in the hope he could find some kind of loophole to free Castiel from this situation.
He congratulated his friend once more, and added, “It was nice seeing you. Thank you for volunteering this month again.”
But Sam could not stop laughing, so much so, that he soon disappeared from the frame, still roaring with laughter.
“Whatever it was,
First, one Sunday, in early June, Dean was stunned to be turned around, due to an “emergency” when he presented himself to Zachariah’s office for the weekly briefing.
He jolted when he realized Benny was standing next to him.
Dean was sitting at the edge of the tub. His arms were crossed over his chest. His eyes were puffy and red. And he was desperately trying to even out his breathing.
Dean shifted in his seat.
Dean turned towards Castiel.
Shivering all over, Dean bit his lips hard, suppressing a deep moan.
Castiel momentarily frowned until he understood Dean was inquiring about the phone call.
His friend nodded at his comment, while the scarecrow stared at him with puzzlement.
“That okay?”
to know this.”
That was more or less the point, thought Castiel, he
Surely, it couldn’t be the same car.
“It’s fine, Dad. It’s one game. Don’t worry about it. There will be other ones.” And Dean had meant it. He wasn’t very upset about that. During this whole week, football had almost felt like a nuisance more than anything.
“Dean.”
And his armor.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but—I—your eyes, not your tongue, will help you with that.”
Whatever they might be.
“Cas?” said John, as he was heading towards the hallway.
He repositioned himself on his seat, put the cup aside and fetched his water bottle from his bag, took a sip and was ready to continue.
But Castiel and Sam weren’t just dancing and playing the game next to each other.
Dean sighed. “It’s just, that detour is gonna take us forever. And I—”
me. Not to mention the rest of the galaxy,” he said, nodding at their mug shots flashing on the monitor. “You must have really pissed her off. I’m just an innocent bystander right now.”
Dean took another step.
“Yeah. That’s—like, what? Less than an hour away from Pontiac?”
“Not long. A few months.”
“But I—Samuel, he—” Panicking, Dean tripped on his words.
They quietly gobbled down their snack. While Dean would have had more than enough room for a second helping, the salami-ham sandwich would sustain his hunger until morning.
,” said Lucifer, suddenly changing to a more playful tone, “perhaps he’s having the most carnal dream of
you also managed to put that massive jerk back in his place in the most civilized manner. I’m glad you did because I was about to lose my cool after what he said.”
They were free.
“Not embarrassed, right?”
Yes, pub, not
“And finally, Gertie is soon going to be a big sister,” said Garth gleefully.
Like, he did not see that one coming and he legit thought they were fucking with them.
He held Dean firmly by the hip with one hand, pushed in just a speck, and then paused.
“We need you to come with us. Calmly. I—I don’t know what kind of situation you got around here,” he said with the kindest eyes he could master, “but if you come with us, we can get you out this station. We won’t hurt you.”
Waiting for Dean to open the door, Castiel stood beside him on a porch that surrounded the entire house, and was garnished with a pair of nice, comfy-looking rocking chairs and even a swinging love seat.
Which made Dean like him even more. If that was possible.
Castiel’s mouth opened. He glanced around in turn, assessing a potential threat, and then returned his attention to Dean, stepping closer to him.
People, he always had thought, weren’t as good liars as they claimed to be.
“And what about Dean? Is everything okay between you two?”
And something told Sam that this was their way of letting them know the location of their big finish.
“I didn’t say he knew exactly where you were. I said he had a vague
And that was truly frightening.
Pleased, Dean opened the bag to get a quick look. The first item he found was of a circular shape, wrapped in a cloth. Something Dean hadn’t included in his order.
“We can access the cabin through there. The window is right next to the pantry, so we can check up on the horses without leaving the cabin, too.”
“Who’s that?”
“Belphegor wants to come, too.”
Dean, walking to his booth, trying not to drag his feet, passed by toys’ department and spotted his friends, Charlie and Jo, looking at the board games.
“Yes. I highly recommend it. Not that the one we have is anything less spectacular.”
He cleared his throat, and advancing slowly, he said, “Hello?”
There was a short pause. “It’s the rule. So, yes, of course.”
The brave
Which was rather impressive. He could see the lights of skyscrapers in the distance, as well as the ones from the cars and the “L” moving around.
He wasn’t sure what to think about Dean sending them back to him, either.
She held her stare with a piercing look, probably trying to detect his bullshit. “If you mean what I think you mean, there is only one way to ensure this.”
Stuck inside his own mind, he attempted to focus on the massive trees and greenery surrounding him.
Guessing what Dean was reflecting on, Castiel then said, “We can just get take-out somewhere and eat in the car for ten minutes. I think we can manage that, no?”
And quite frankly, for a very brief moment, Castiel lost himself to the kiss and forgot everything around him.
“You should get that,” said Castiel. He then tried to walk away from him, but Dean clutched onto his sleeve.
“No one serious in high school. Neither during my studies. I’ve had a few flings here and there, but I told you, my family background eventually catches up to me. I’ve always made a point to not get too attached. What about you?”
He had no intentions of forcing anything. But he hoped that, by simply doing so, it would convey his intention.
“We can still play later on, but…since some of the daylight is still here, would you be okay if we just sat by the lake and talked?”
Uriel and Zachariah exchanged a look.
And little did he know that massive changes were coming his way.
Castiel was the one playing at the piano with the orchestra.
“Mr. Roman and Miss Knight, so nice of you to be here today,” said Dean, who suddenly appeared next to him.
“So, I—I just don’t think it’s in the cards for me.”
Dean cleared his throat and said, “I’m fine. But the conversation would help. So, like I said, where are you from? And what brings you here?”
“So, she’s lying?” said Sam, unconvinced.
Thus, Sam opted to spend his time at the library to get rid of his other homework, and out of habit he installed himself at the same table where he and Castiel usually sat.
“Dean?”
“We might need him,” argued Dean.
Sam ignored the fact that he could feel his cheeks getting warm. “I wouldn’t go that far.”
Cas: Guess all you want.
Castiel stopped breathing and immediately looked away, trying his best to hold back his tears, and feeling as if his chest had been ripped open.
“I’ll take care of it. I’m the one who asked.”
nice.”
It put that
“All this time you thought I had left without saying anything on purpose?”
“Sure.”
But given the company and that his mother insisted on him staying within her sight, he knew he most likely wouldn’t be able to do so until the baking was done.
Silence.
“It was obvious that I was not Dean’s priority in all accounts, so I made myself scarce.”
With his back leaning against the door, Castiel had nearly fell in, thus pausing his speech, when Dean had opened the door swiftly.
Leaving the Gordon debacle aside for a moment, Dean couldn’t get over how the last hour had been down right trippy.  And not the right kind.
“But it is a strong possibility,” said Ketch, as-a-matter-of-factly. “Given that he is staying.”
Dean nodded. “Why?”
“Dean, you sure?” he asked, out of breath.
They met no issues on their way to Turbulentus, which was a pleasant and refreshing surprise to them.
Like the fact that they were apparently in the honeymoon suite.
Gabe: Dean has been eye-fucking you since I don’t even know anymore.
“What—what do you mean?” asked Sam.
I was just surprised to hear it from Sam. But know that you can tell me anything. And I really mean anything, even if it’s awkward.
After Dean had left, Castiel was not able to be very productive. His mind was everywhere, unable to focus properly. He found himself staring at his screen blankly, reading the same sentence four times in a row and still not making any sense of it.
“No,” he said, taking another sip of his cider. “I know you wouldn’t. But then it means that…what? If you didn’t tell him, then it implies that he figured it out himself because I’m not sheltering him at all from my drama like I thought I—and where on earth did he come up with that expression?”
You need to know that being apart doesn’t necessarily mean indefinitely.
Have a nice week everyone!!
“Cas?”
“You tell him, Richie.”
limited options to help them. Castiel appreciated that the witch attempted to discourage the boys from this sudden confrontation, especially when he mentioned that Mary, whom he had joined, had been asking about them. Using Mary had been a bit cruel, but also clever, thought Castiel.
“You can use standard wrapping methods, obviously, though the store would like to be a little more creative. They offered a few patterns that you can follow here.” Dean retrieved the thin file he had been handed on his first day. It contained a multitude of schemas of different wrapping methods. He had since practiced a few of them when he had been bored.
“Okay, okay. I—I will. And I was just trying not to be too insistent. I will have to work with the guy for the next few weeks.”
At some point during the night, Castiel lost his burgundy coat and let people body paint on him. Which was a spectacle that Dean found extremely hilarious to witness at first, given the confused expression of the angel at the practice. But soon enough, especially when Castiel was also rid of his shirt,
And he was indeed still wearing his briefs.
Castiel’s phone buzzed, and once he saw who was calling he smiled and lifted his phone to show Sam.
It was as though the moment Castiel had made him aware of his clothing, everything became unbearable. His feet felt like lava, jeans were now the most uncomfortable clothing item invented and he could feel the sweat practically dripping down the back of his neck.
“Perfect timing,” said Dean. He opened the door and found Alicia smiling at them on the other side.
He remained still for as long as he could, and then breathed on Gabriel’s lips, “
And even before Gabriel had reached the end of his sentence, Chuck snapped his fingers.
“Then where? Where were you?”
“Didn’t like it anymore,” he said quickly.
Jack smiled and shook his head. And needing no additional information and still holding his father’s hand, Jack immediately marched towards the Winchester’s Pet Groomer.
Gabe: Just tell me one thing.
Dean blinked. He had said it in such a matter-of-fact way.
“Thank you, but that will obviously not be an option.”
“Oh, well. It will come back to us. So, tell me Dean, care if I try one of these wrapping patterns? And maybe we can trade the funniest stories we have about the customers of this place from last year? I’m sure yours must be interesting given the job in question.”
That was when he noticed the sound of the shower running in the bathroom.
. But Castiel had insisted on waiting for a special occasion to wear them properly, and he decided that now was the time.
“I’ll be there,” said Sam, without a moment of hesitation, which left Castiel astonished.
Having someone speak highly of him was not something Dean was accustomed to, but to hear Castiel defend him to that degree after his conduct, made Dean feel far worse than he could have imagined.
“Did you know Dean,” said Ketch, “prior to the event on Purgatory7172?”
“Now, discretion is key.” Zachariah took a dramatic pause, and while his tone didn’t change, his stare turned slightly more serious. “Not only during his appointments, but for your arrival and departure as well. Especially your departure. Sometimes, it might need to be done rather quickly. Like if Castiel’s visit attracted the wrong kind of attention. You know of whom I’m referring to, don’t you, Dean?”
Castiel nodded. “Does that happen often?”
It was slow progress, but progress all the same.
He had begun this painting back in September on a night when Michael had been feeling particularly blue about their situation, and having no other means to help their issue, undertaking this painting had been the only thing Castiel had thought of to convey what he had felt.
Nonetheless, since Castiel was troubled by that possibility, Dean turned off all the lights, but the Christmas ones, so they could enjoy it with their minds at ease for a moment.
“You wouldn’t be the first, Dean. I’ve worked for the Garrisons for a while, and I’ve seen up close what the pressure of the job can do to a person. And it doesn’t matter what the task description is.”
Screwing up his plans once more.
“Did he say something?”
“Cool. When did this happen?” asked Sam again, only this time, there was an accusatory tone attached to it.
Castiel clenched his jaw. She freed herself from his hold and walked slowly away from him.
And after exchanging long warm stares, they had to go back to work. And even though Dean would have preferred continuing to speak with Castiel, as this was only a too brief account of what he wanted to happen, he was still glad of what he had gotten.
“Sorry,
“Me too.”
“Yes,” said Dean. “And you’re gonna need one too. Trust me.”
If that wasn’t disturbing enough, Godstiel, floating mid-air, spewed black goo that reminded them of the Leviathans. But the gooey mass, which was ever-growing and covering the ground at an excessive speed, remained connected to him.
His eyes bounced from Castiel to Dean, and a faint smile appeared on his face.
When Dean let out a distinct moan, which resonated all the way down to Castiel’s groin, Castiel began pushing himself downwards, while delicately running a hand along Dean’s side, making him quiver.
Trying to not lose his composure, and reminding himself to not immediately draw conclusions—no matter how hopeful they might appear—Castiel decided that accepting one drink wasn’t implying anything and that there wasn’t any harm in it.
“Can I ask—I know this is—this is really none of my business…”
He also believed that the fact that his father had caught him snooping around the presents every morning since they had been put under the tree (or every opportunity that had presented itself afterwards, really), might have had something to do with that too.
For now, he was simply grateful for the extra time, even if he knew nothing would come of it.
And waited.
“Huh. Might have a point there.”
“I want my keys.”
“Yeah, but it was my idea to watch it together.”
It would be important to note that while Sam pursued his attempt to cheer Dean up, a
And yes, the
“Welcome, Mr. Novak. Please take a seat.”
Castiel looked at Sam, absolutely petrified. “No,” he said, shaking his head vehemently. “I can’t.”
“Oh, you mean like this?” said Castiel, pointing at his tag behind his ear. “Look, it was just to get us in. We got in. Now we need to follow through with part two: get what we came for and get out. None of this will—um, matter once we leave.”
So, Dean was to go on his own and had shared the strong possibility that he might spend the night there.
Once they had finished recounting the night’s events, Metatron and Zachariah appeared to hold an entire conversation between them, simply by exchanging a long look.
“Given the information, you shouldn’t really have a problem convincing them to accept you buying them out quickly and fairly. However, it will require you to break your piggy bank. And then some. On the other hand, you could avoid spending too much with some of them. If some of the information I have would become public, it would most likely mean jail time for some people.”
Dean’s left leg nearly gave out. He reached for Castiel’s hands and pushed himself against him, feeling Castiel’s erection against his ass.
“You are?”
“Sam, I swear, that’s what he told me.”
If Dean was troubled a moment ago, that was nothing compared to how freaking perturbed he was watching Castiel sticking his hand into some mysterious, smelly, and evidently painful solution.
“Dean, I—I don’t know what to do.”
But his patience and carefulness seemed to pay off in the morning, when he received the text for a new meeting time on that very night.
Panicking, Castiel swallowed and said, “I’ll vouch for him. You won’t get any trouble from him. From us.”
He spent the rest of his day quietly. He worked on his responses for a few hours during the afternoon. And went for a short walk when it appeared that the rain considerably subdued.
“Wait, what?” said Dean.
Cas: Why? Sam, what happened?
“My present?” asked Dean to Castiel.
Once seated though, they both beamed at each other.
Unfortunately, only Rufus and Jo, sitting at the bar, with the Ghostfacers not far from them, were to be seen.
“I know
Castiel had to remind himself to not get carried away and mistake the kindness Dean was showing him for actual wooing.
Castiel nodded and smiled at him not knowing what else to say. “I’ll have to break them in,” he said, as he took back his seat next to Dean.
And as he watched Dean hurrying down to the truck, Castiel was sure he had caught Dean wiping off tears.
“What do you mean?”
“Nothing.”
“I know the game is cancelled, but I thought you still had a date with Lisa tonight?”
“Why?”
The trio was standing over an unmarked tombstone. Godstiel was holding a metallic urn, while the Boy King and Deanmon were delicately placing three skulls on top of the stone, as though to form a triangle.
The trio, left to themselves, took a moment to discuss.
But he stayed still. Not for long, but long enough to give Dean time to be lost in the moment, to breathe in his scent, wishing that Castiel’s hand would venture a little higher than his knee. So much so that Dean legit reached out to Castiel’s coat and tugged him closer. And totally slid his other hand underneath it, easing his hand to his lower back.
“So, Cas. How are you, really? At the ranch, I mean.”
“Lucifer,” uttered Sam, as dread spread in his stomach.
He wasn’t the only one enjoying Gabriel’s treat. Becky had even given him an approving nod after tasting it, and Castiel—quite surprisingly—reached the bottom of his glass at a speed which impressed both Chuck and Dean.
“Answer the question.”
Dean laughed. “Um, I—I’m not—not exactly like a chauffeur.” And then, frowning, he added, “I think. I—we didn’t really get into those details yet.”
But this? The fleet and allies? No.
“Shut up.”
“Oh, no. Sandy hair is definitely my thing. I just have my eyes set on another one already.”
Finally, Sam, though he hadn’t yelled, managed to hush everyone with a direct and sharp, “Hey!” Now able to hear himself think, he said to Dean and Castiel, “Maybe one of us should fill them in, while the others sort this out,” as he tapped on the table.
“I had a call this morning. Potential investors.”
Gabe: IS THAT SO?!
“No.”
“Answer my question.”
When the trio finally reached the throne room, the Boy King was surprised. Without the presence of his siblings—and of other low-life demons attempting to make themselves relevant, thus practically offering him the throne—it seemed that Asmodeus had gained a boost of confidence.
“I can’t do it. I’m sorry, Sam, but I changed my mind.”
“He didn’t offer you anything?”
And not only Gabriel’s.
Castiel frowned.
Deep.
And even though none of the subject matter could remotely be considered deep or even intimate, Dean didn’t care. He was having a terrific time.
Castiel blinked. He hadn’t expected that. He nodded, digesting the information. “Good.”
“Yeah. I mentioned briefly what the options were. Everyone is happy with what we selected. That being said, I think if we leave without some powdered mini donuts, Donna is gonna murder us.”
And not that I would ever dare offend Mrs. Moseley, because that lady is amazing and kind of terrifying, but I need to severely hurry ass with this story so we are going to skip forward a little.
“Just—um, time is of the essence,” Dean had said, looking nearly embarrassed. “I know it’s crazy and quick, but I don’t have a choice. It’s about the people there too. I hate to say it, but I need an answer ridiculously fast so I know which way to go.”
books, right?” Dean had lowered his voice at the word “archangel.”
“You going too, Charlie?”
Finding it encouraging, Castiel then cautiously shook his shoulder, trying to wake him as gently as he could. “Jack? Jack, can you hear me? It’s Castiel.”
“Not really, no,” said Gabriel. “I like people who have style. In all sense of the word.”
Where he could finally apologize without rambling. Or worrying that Sam might hear something that was best kept unknown to him. Or being interrupted by whatever dramatic event was about to be dropped on their heads.
“Morning, Dean,” said Castiel, looking at Richie’s car backing up on the dirt road.
“If you do what you’re supposed to, there shouldn’t be any trouble. And it would mean more money.”
“What did you get me?”
“Really? At night?”
“Oh my God, please. Shut up, both of you.”
“So when do you suggest we do this?” said Gabriel, absolutely beaming at him.
“I’m not telling him. How about his husband tells him?”
I'm on
“Put the delightful Mrs. Winchester on the phone, please, and I’ll see you and Sam in an hour.”
This question brought Dean a worrisome thought. Exciting, in parts, but worrisome.
He shed his coat and walked towards her.
“Awesome. Wait,” he added, frowning, “you said something about them stealing something. Why? What makes you think that? They could have done all this just to slow us down. I mean, all those weapons gone is royally pissing me off, but there wasn’t anything unique in there. Just regular weaponry. I can’t see what would have been worth stealing.”
She slightly scowled at him like she didn’t trust anything that came out of his mouth.
And thinking of their brothers was a helpful distraction, as they walked side by side, hand in hand.
She hesitated a moment and then, after taking a deep breath, she added, “Would it be totally crazy if I asked if you were free tonight, also?”
So, our boys were staring at Crowley; one was intrigued and the other one freaking out. I don’t think I need to tell you precisely which one was perturbed.
Castiel tilted his head. “Near the Preacantarix system?”
“Thanks, Gabe. That was…surprisingly insightful. I appreciate it.”
Of Dean and everyone mocking him.
And when Dean still wasn’t speaking, which was worrisome to Castiel, he said, “And what about why you're here, Dean? We said that—why are you here?”
“It’s because I’ve been wanting this for a long time, too.”
Castiel thought for a moment. “What are you dressing up as?”
Dean lowered his gaze and found Castiel’s eyes.
Nor anyone listening to the news—probably in disbelief of its content, thought Dean.
“I—I don’t really want to talk about Lisa, right now,” he said, looking at Castiel right in the eyes with no intention of diverting his gaze.
Dean stopped dead at the sight of the car.
“I meant to ask,” said Castiel, “how is everything with Lisa? You must be looking forward to tomorrow.”
Which greatly amused Castiel.
Haunting.
And while this evidence hadn’t revealed the identity of true guilty party, it certainly attested to the innocence of Dean and Castiel.
“I’m just—what’s in it?”
Crowley only smiled.
By the time they had reached the bottom of the hill, Dean had nearly crashed into Jack and Whiskey, who had come to a halt not far from the Impala, and Castiel had slid right off his saucer and was now face first in snow.
“But then, if that’s the case… when we… it means—I thought he stopped me because he was with you. If he’s not, then that means—that means he just doesn’t—”
“Yes. You? Am I killing your arm?”
Trying to keep his composure and wishing to not ruin the moment, Dean weighed how to approach the situation.
“It seems that we are leaning towards accepting,” said Castiel.
I behaved like an idiot because I was afraid that I would repeat my past mistakes. And I ended up not giving that person—that amazing, selfless and beautiful person—the credit they deserved.
Clenching his jaw harshly, he picked up his school bag, wishing he could teleport directly to his room instead of having to pass by the living room first.
“Gabriel,” said Sam. After one look at Dean, he typed something quickly and hid his phone back in his pocket.
Dean cleared his throat. He left his suitcase at the entrance next to Castiel and went exploring the rest of the room. He slid a door at the other end of the room, not far from the bed, and turned around, looking relieved.
A basket of clean laundry appeared to be half folded on one of the couches.
Which had been when they had decided to leave the pub, and Sam had happily accepted Gabriel’s invitation.
“I realized the host and prime donor of the evening is Mr. Roman.”
Dean nodded, turning his head towards the road. Both hands on the wheel, he let out a deep sigh.
“You’re telling me I missed an entire
“Everybody does.
One loud groan. His entire body spasmed as he disgracefully gripped the edges of the tub.
Which was rather surprising considering how much Castiel stood out from everyone else.
Sam fought the urge to tell the news to the cashier once he arrived at the counter. Feeling giddy, he suddenly craved something sweet and ordered a box of cookies with his second sub.
And thank you to Landrala who is always supportive as well!
Warmth.
It sounded like he was.
“You need to understand what this place was for—when I said it brought back bad memories, it’s not of you, Dean. It’s about my family. The memory of when everything shattered for me. It always follows me, but being here, where it all began…These past months, you made the place far more bearable than I thought you could. So much so that when—when Hannah—it just brought it all back. That I can never escape this. That’s how I feel right now. And—” he shifted in his seat, “and you need to know that it’s—it’s not just you. This is complicated for me too. You’re not—it’s not in your head. I’m just—I’m confused about many things.”
And the rest of his sentence died in his throat, the moment his eyes fell on his new co-worker.
He was glad to have met Dean and he was relieved to know that someone nice, just as Donna had promised to him, was a few feet away.
“There’s many ways you can set it up,” said Gabriel, looking at the instruction pamphlet. “I wasn’t sure which one you’d like but you can choose. It’s by the same company that did my fireplace at the bakery.”
Dean frowned.
Castiel laughed. “
Sam frowned. “What? No you don’t. I—I thought you were looking forward to it. You said that you would—”
Even if he knew that he had perhaps been needlessly harsh with him.
“Excuse me?”
is a tad over selling it, but yes. She’s the one I told you about this morning—and last night. It’s—it’s complicated.”
Sam had been incredibly depressed at the idea of spending the holidays without Dean.
The cold started to bite his cheeks and fingers.
“Dean? Do you want to sit down a moment?”
“How long have you been here?”
As Dean cautiously made his way across the dining area, with Sam and Castiel following him closely, fearing that he might trip because of his boots, he prayed that Gabriel would move on to their next outfit quickly. The tight jeans and top were already granting him curious looks as it was, and the boots were simply insufferable.
Although it had been done quickly, looking at the clouds out of the window, Castiel felt overall good about his decision.
Sitting on a very uncomfortable chair at an overpriced café, for someone of his limited means anyway, Dean swallowed hard. Still holding the phone to his ear, he lowered his eyes as he felt his heart growing heavy at the news he had just heard.
“Sam, come on.”
That was it. No hospital in sight. No factory. No theatre or coffee shop. Bookstore. Gym. Not even a school.
And so, for the second time in less than ten hours, they knocked on Anael’s door. This time she didn’t make them linger and immediately let them in.
Still hesitant about this option, Dean didn’t resist this time, however.
Jack bit on his lip.
“Dean? Are you okay?”
And there he was.
“The one on their side of the house?”
“You don’t want to vex her?” snorted Castiel. And given the glare she shot him, he probably should have kept that one to himself.
“As your mother said, we have no objection if Castiel needs to stay over. This is hardly the first time this happened, and he’s always welcome. Sam, it was very nice of you to extend the invitation to his brother as well, and I agree that he can stay with us if he wishes to do so.”
Dean gawked at him for a brief moment. He gently put down his drink, and after doing the same for Castiel’s drink, staring at him, he stood up, and he reached for his hand.
They stared at one another awkwardly.
Dean’s eyes widened. “Cas, no.  You can’t—this is—I’m—this is my problem.”
Assessing that Castiel was resolute in not uttering another word, Gabriel glanced at the door and listened to make sure he didn’t hear anyone walking around in the hallway. “Cas, come on,” he finally said, once he was reassured that nobody would barge in. “Look, real talk, okay? No jokes. I know this isn’t my business, and I won’t force anything out of you. But I have the right to say that I have eyes, and from where I’m standing, yours are desperately locked in on Dean.”
Which, as a matter of fact, he very much was.
And before Dean could do anything else, another Sam lifted his hand and closed his fist in a dramatic manner, while staring down at Dean.
There was a short pause, and then Castiel said, “While it wasn’t the outcome we had hoped, it also could have been far worse.”
“How?”
“Innocent. Right.” Oh, Dean.
He kept replaying in his mind the scene he had witnessed, over and over and over and over.
But when it came to knowing what color shirt Susan Thompson, the Pierpont Inn owner, had been wearing on the second day of their stay, Dean had to admit defeat. He was also speechless about how some people were answering these challenging questions with such ease, that it made him wonder how many times they had read the books.
did.”
He took a deep breath and turned around to face him.
Castiel was laughing. “I’m terrified.”
“It was rough,” admitted Dean. “Not seeing you. Not even knowing if—it’s been a rough couple of months.” He slid himself closer. “But that’s why it makes me so happy that you're here.”
All three of them were examining Castiel from head to toe. Plump Dean even reached out to the collar of his coat, taking in the texture of the material.
Once they had both reached their limits for burgers and hot dogs, they decided it was time to attack the apple pie.
Gabriel looked like someone had just hit him. “How did that happen?”
“I—no, I’m an accountant.”
His only problem was the weekend.
“It’s a long story, Dean. I’ll explain. Later. We, um, we still have to deal with this,” he said, pointing at the soldiers putting themselves back together.
Gabriel: You’re living with him because it was the practical choice. Based on finances and location.
“Look, you already made out with him and you liked it—”
“Cas, trust me, okay? Who cares what he wants? Who cares what he has to say? What they all have to say. Father. Michael. Hell, everyone.”
It was in moments like these that Castiel struggled the most about their arrangement. These memories, which were often bittersweet, left Castiel wondering if they weren’t complicating the situation even more.
This was good news.
“You okay?” she asked, helping him with his books.
A few awkward minutes passed, during which both of them remained silent, waiting for the other to elaborate, until the man began hoisting himself up onto his elbow.
“Better, I suppose. But he’s sleeping. And he needs it.” Donna nodded. “The more he sleeps, the better he’ll feel when he wakes up.”
“Still. Just—just talk to friends. Check up on the info I gave you. Sleep on it. And I’m here if you have questions.”
Dean bit on his lips.
But despite his opposition, John had proposed and Samuel gave Mary an ultimatum.
“You’re welcome.”
“Why?” Sam stiffened on his spot.
“Why haven’t we heard anything from you since, then? Does it have to do with the fact that—oh, I don’t know—you’re letting him use you anyway he wants? Fuck, Cas! Father might be a crazy stubborn asshole, but at least he didn’t get fucked into it.”
“I promise,” said Dean, lifting his hand. “I mean, I might make fun of you a little bit, but just because this whole thing is a bit crazy and you have to admit it.”
“I—I was just thinking that maybe I should do the same. Maybe I should get him something.” He cleared his throat and awkwardly looked to his left, even though nothing remotely interesting was happening there. “Maybe that will, um, help clarify a few things that I—yeah.”
Dean swallowed. He pulled Castiel towards him by his shirt, rested one hand on his cheek, grazing the corner of his mouth gently with his thumb, and after a short hesitation, they kissed again. Castiel slightly opened his mouth and Dean took the initiative to slide in a bit of tongue. Dean heard himself moan, as he tasted Castiel’s tongue. It was sweet, like peach, from a drink he must have had earlier, no doubt.
we landed.
“Cool. Is he nice?”
“And the second one was this other kid who lived down the street. He was a little older than Sam—even me—and I have no idea why, but Sam always liked him. And his name was Gabriel.”
“What do you mean?” asked Sam.
And after whispering a few things into Dean’s ear for the next couple of minutes, Castiel slowly began nudging him out of the kitchen, and all the way to his bedroom.
So, he drove home in a haze, with a thousand questions and sad thoughts swarming around in his skull.
Armed with the most powerful celestial being and a ruthless killing machine made the task of invading the place far less complicated than he had believed.
And neither option was acceptable to him.
“Yes, Dean. That would be amazing.”
“Okay, good.”
Gabriel looked down.
Castiel shrugged. “I just feel like it.”
Rowena did as well.
With their imagination running wild.
“Really? You’ll do that?”
While he appreciated the sentiment, Castiel squinted at him, as this hadn’t been his question.
Hell, or even all of the above.
Dean was moaning.
And the only thing that made the afternoon tolerable was that he knew they wouldn’t be able to sneak around without his knowing that night.
Not worried in the slightest of what had happened.
. Like she had zero doubt it would happen. Even in our unusual arrangement, she was positive of that fact." Castiel paused shortly. “And then...well, you know the rest, I suppose. There were complications during childbirth…”
And although it had been one of the reasons why Dean had chosen that fake location, it hadn’t been in the sense Samuel was implying.
“The next place? You—you mean the doc, right?”
“But,” repeated Castiel, “if we do that we won’t have access to the brunch buffet. The one I know you inquired about. The one you personally called the hotel to ask questions about on the
A lot had happened since the incident in Dodge City, but the guilt of it had still been overwhelming to Jack. And no matter how he wished it to be differently, had it not been Patrick’s phone call, thus offering an opportunity to help save Mary, Jack, despite loving Sam, Castiel and Dean, would have left them.
“So, um, Dean? I’m curious.” Castiel shifted on his seat, changing his whole body position. Dean, now officially worried, braced himself for Castiel to reveal that he had known all along about Dean’s massive crush on him.
Gabriel: TELL ME EVERYTHING
“Okay,” he finally said. “And what does that mean?”
Smiling kindly at him, Castiel pointed near the couch and Dean excused himself.
And heading full on towards them.
“I—yes, but—”
“You’re very welcome, Sammy.”
“Do you mind if we stop at one more place before going back home?” Castiel asked his son.
As they walked down the section of games, watching kids rejoicing around them, Castiel couldn’t help but notice himself constantly staring at Dean and genuinely being happy to see him smile. Like this was his gift to him and nobody else.
No. The real Santa was yet to come.
“Me? I—what?” He turned to Chastity who looked at him shyly. As he was processing the information, more confused than ever, he began saying, “But that means—I—”
“Cas, what—”
“You think he would go to that far?”
“Gabriel is perfectly fine where he is. Leave him be,” said Castiel.
“Give it up for 423!” yelled Roman cheerfully.
“No Wi-Fi,” he laughed. “We barely have radio range.”
And then, the moment he grabbed them, a shock went through his whole body as he realized which keys he was holding.
They ate a delicious early dinner (spaghetti and meatballs), and Castiel was convinced that, after their tiresome afternoon, they would both crash with full bellies.
Startled, Dean jolted at the sound of Castiel’s voice. He hadn’t yelled, but his tone had been so firm and raw, it had hit Dean like a punch.
“You heard me. You do not need to know anything, Dean, as it’s none of your business. Cas helped me with something today, as he always does, by the way, so I thanked him for it. That’s it. I don’t even need to tell you this, but here it is. As for what it concerns, that’s between Cas and me, and it will stay between us until we decide otherwise.”
Not far below, there was a small, quaint cabin. Given the location, it was obvious why this cabin wasn’t one of the options to rent. It was too far from everything.
Distracted by Jack’s state, Rowena’s enchantment faltered for a moment, enough for Godstiel to free himself from it.
. “And you left without saying goodbye! Thanks. Nice.”
“The cabin used to belong to my dad. Almost…ten years ago now,” he said, tilting his head, pondering on the matter, “yeah, about that. Almost ten years ago my dad moved here and became the town’s mechanic.”
“I’m not sure. I don’t have my prime source anymore—”
“That was very nice of you,” said Castiel to his son. “Now, go upstairs. I’ll be there in a minute.”
“You said there was more than one reason for helping us. What was the other one?”
“But everyone is already at the house,” said Sam, following his directions. “Including Ellen and Bobby, and they were the ones who were supposed to arrive late.”
Sam pushed his mug, stood up and rested against the counter next to Dean.
They remained in that fashion for a long time, until Gabriel took a deep breath and shifted slightly towards him still.
The rest of the night flew by far too quickly for Dean. Just as Castiel had suggested, they headed to the next restaurant they could find, only two doors over, and consumed delicious ramen noodles with beers for the next hour.
And with one arm wrapped around Dean’s stomach? Also possible.
to ask such a delicate question.
Later in the evening, Jessica and Donna managed to convince everyone at the table to go on the dance floor. Resistance had occurred, especially from the Winchester brothers, but soon enough, everyone reached the dance floor.
“That must have been quite the day,” said Castiel.
Until Dean asked, “Are you?”
That was an excellent question, which neither Dean or Castiel had an answer for.
Eagerness.
But that was irrelevant for now.
“Dean,” said Sam, laughing, “you just agreed to meet Lisa after practice to go on your date. Won’t Lisa prefer this happening with just the two of you?”
Castiel opened his front door and gasped when he found an unexpected visitor standing before him, with a fist lifted, as though he had been about to knock on his door.
“Dean? How are you feeling?”
Panicking, Castiel was torn about what to do. But he knew he had to make a decision now or he would regret it.
“Wait, the weekend and—so…you aren’t on your vacation?”
