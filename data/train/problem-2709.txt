He was so used to his stomach doing flip-flops when he was cuddling with Dean that he almost didn’t recognize the first time his pup was kicking.
Castiel didn’t waste any time dwelling on the disadvantages, though. Yes, Dean was never going to return his feelings, but Castiel didn’t need him to in order to be happy. They had become good friends over the years—the best of friends, really, and Castiel had found his happiness in just being.
Besides, Castiel had won. He had finally found Dean’s perfect match. If Gabe had come to gloat, he had come to the wrong angel.
Dean tried to exude a calm and reassuring scent even though he was kind of freaked out to see Cas like that. Stroking over the omega’s back, he promised in a gentle voice that he was safe and that everything would be okay.
Once they were fully clothed again, they were discussing their options regarding their predicament. The FAQ page of the National Center for Mating Affairs was helpful, but it did not offer the answers they had hoped for.
On the contrary, he really liked watching Dean sleep, wondering what he might be dreaming about. The alpha looked so peaceful and beautiful that Castiel couldn’t help but snuggle against him and sneak a whiff from his scent gland.
Since Jimmy’s fighting technique was seriously lacking, Dean had offered to give him lessons in self-defense to make him feel safe at home, even though Jimmy said that his ex should have no way of finding out where he had moved.
Dean just gaped at him. Jimmy was direct, he’d give him that. “Oh no, I wasn’t hitting on you,” he quickly clarified. “I’m into omegas, no offense. I just thought, you know, we’re neighbors…” he trailed off, leaving Jimmy to fill in the rest.
Dean rolled his eyes at how utterly clueless Sam was. “Don’t be ridiculous. I see him almost every day.”
Dean sat back a bit, licked his lips, and said, “Okay.” He licked his lips again and then repeated, “Okay. I was thinking about what you said about… you know, just saying stuff, so, I guess here goes. I thought a few days away for your pregnancy heat would be nice. So, I looked around, and if you’re not still set on that whole alpha service idea, I could book a cottage for the week. I found a nice one mates recommend for spending their mating cycles, and I figured you paid last time, so it’s only fair if I got this one…”
Sure enough, Dean said, “Okay, whatever. Hope your ass is ready for some action ’cause I won’t go easy on you this time.”
Here was the sweetest omega coming on to him, and Dean would like nothing more than to kiss him and scent him and
A few careful and tentative licks followed, and Dean tried to keep it in, he really did, but… “Cas!” he moaned again as a warning.
“Still me,” Castiel answered automatically before what Gabriel said really registered. “What, really?” He hadn’t even been alerted yet.
The reason it was so easy to follow all of the advice given in the book was simple, yet it had taken him until now to figure it out. He wanted this family like he had never wanted anything before. He wanted Cas as his
The way Cas’ eyes flitted away from his told him he wouldn’t get rid of the watch just yet. That was okay, though—the rash thing had mostly been a joke anyway.
Jimmy didn’t seem to think so, as he just squinted at him, took another swig from his beer, and then asked, “Was that a question?”
Depravity and filth? Somehow, Dean doubted that that was what rut smelled like for most omegas. Otherwise, no alpha in rut would ever get some tail.
Before Castiel could come up with something to reply, Dean’s hands were sliding down to his hips, adjusting his position for easier access.
him. Was that what was usually done here? Who had ever heard of an alpha being knotted? He could knot him all he wanted—his sperm wouldn’t find an egg to fertilize. Even the more hardcore alpha porn videos hadn’t featured knotting.
Fortunately, he seemed to have gotten there in time. When he knocked and poked his head in the door to Sam’s office, Sam waved him in, friendly as ever.
“No, I don’t need any help! And I’d appreciate it if you’d stop sending omegas I’m supposed to mate my way. We’ve talked about this! I don’t want this destined perfect mate bullshit!”
So, when Dean said that he was ‘game’ (which, he assumed, meant he was willing to go through with it), Cas could have jumped up and danced across the room.
Leave it to Cas to make scenting his arm even more intimate than scenting his neck. It left Dean electrically charged, and before Cas could notice the goosebumps that tingled up his arm, he quickly pulled it away.
Castiel was relieved. He really hadn’t wanted to stop seeing Dean. By day, he continued working as a cupid, and in the evenings, he could still visit Dean on earth.
Dean had told him that he missed him almost every day when they had been Skyping, but what if Dean had realized that he got by just fine without his scent-bond partner? This time, it was two weeks and two days. Maybe next time he wouldn’t see Dean for even longer.
Jimmy just blinked up at him, the mark on his neck an angry red from where Dean had licked and nibbled and bitten at it. It kind of looked like a hickey, but of course that’s not what it was. It was simply a sign of Dean’s victory in this strange kind of alpha fight.
Even more of a surprise was the fact that Dean seemed to have actually listened to him. When Castiel arrived at the address, it wasn’t a motel. Dean had invited him to his home.
He was rewarded not only by his cock twitching in his hand, but also by the scent of a fresh gush of omega slick. Damn, did his dick want to slide through that slick! But he wasn’t supposed to think about mounting Cas and sinking into his wet heat, so he tried to focus on what he was doing. He spit into his hand and then wrapped it around his dick again, jerking himself a bit faster.
Dean rolled his eyes. “Yeah, don’t look at me like that, I know what you’re thinking. But Sam’s gonna help. I’m just the one responsible for picking up the ingredients.”
He should have fucked him all of those times! But there was nothing to be done about it now. Instead, he made sure that Cas would feel
With a sigh, Dean put his head into his hands. He didn’t even know where to begin with this lesson in what was appropriate to talk about and what was not.
Dean was stroking Cas’ stomach again, a reminder of what they might just have created if they were really lucky. He shouldn’t get his hopes up, though. It took some mates up to five heats to conceive.
With all available magic concentrated around Anael to lure the witch in, they could do nothing but wait for her to attack, hoping their plan would work.
Some lucky omega out there got to touch and scent Dean, and then Dean would come home reeking of that omega, and Castiel just wanted to cry.
Inexperienced at bringing someone out of a nightmare, Dean let his instincts take over. He nuzzled behind Jimmy’s ear, soothing him by scenting at this intimate place. At the same time, he pulled Jimmy’s head against his own neck, letting the other alpha scent him right back.
“I’m glad you’re finally caught up with what’s going on here,” Cas said. “But maybe the discussion of what to do next can wait until you don’t have your dick in my ass.”
Unfortunately, that meant he couldn’t pull Cas aside and ask him to hang back when everyone got ready to leave. They hadn’t exactly had an opportunity to be alone because Dean had forgotten all about his plans with his friends.
That admission had to be rewarded, so Dean let go of Cas’ wings to use one hand to play with the oil glands again since he knew how sensitive they were.
tried dating, it had ended in disaster. No alpha wanted him because he was too ‘weird.’ Trying to pass for normal was exhausting, so it was just easier to stay home and watch a documentary or go out with a friend, someone he felt comfortable talking to and who didn’t mind if Cas wasn’t in a chatty mood. You couldn’t have comfortable silences with strangers, and uncomfortable silences were the worst.
Cas’ concentrated frown as he tried to understand Dean’s various explanations made him laugh, and they spent the second half of Tombstone chatting about this and that rather than paying attention to what was happening on screen.
After brushing against his prostate once so that Cas almost bucked off the couch, he deliberately avoided touching it again until the alpha was a desperate, squirming mess. Yeah, he had him just where he wanted him.
With one more powerful thrust and a grunt, Dean’s knot caught, locking them together before warm spurts of semen started flooding Castiel’s hole.
Which reminded him, they might need some more omega slick. After all, an omega’s ass was made to withstand a rough fuck marathon during an alpha’s rut. An
Dean smiled at Cas’ babbling. The omega tended to do that when he was caught off-guard, and it was kind of cute.
That mission seemed easy enough, but keeping his erection did pose some challenges after a night out drinking. The fact that he was more excited about going to bed than about what was happening here might have been a red flag, but he chose to ignore it in favor of the familiarity of an omega’s channel squeezing his dick rhythmically.
He could feel the shudder that went through Dean at that one word. The moment of triumph didn’t last long, though. Dean let his teeth graze Castiel’s exposed neck, teasing his mating gland, and Castiel closed his eyes in ecstasy, his hole now soaking wet and ready to be used, his belly aching for Dean’s seed—or at least his touch.
(Okay, and maybe also “I kinda like you,” and “You’re awesome,” and “God, I just want to hold you close forever and never let go.”)
The pleasure was culminating, overtaking him, and the most sensual orgasm he had ever had washed over him and left him weak and vulnerable.
But berating Bees wouldn’t solve anything. Time to get into problem solving mode. He looked at the side bar, trying to find if he had any information about that pining sickness or how to cure it. He didn’t find anything. “What do I do? I don’t see an option here for ‘cuddle time.’”
Dean closed his eyes so that he didn’t have to look at the two people on screen going at it anymore, but could instead see that image of Cas more clearly before his inner eye, naked and writhing in pleasure beneath him.
That pretty much left him with giving Dean The Look. Bedroom eyes were absolutely a thing. Trying his best to look like an omega an alpha might want to cuddle more intimately, he blinked up at Dean and bit his lower lip—something he had seen omegas in movies do. It usually worked out for them.
He tried holding it in by biting his lip, but in the end, he let the “Love you!” slip out. It was, after all, something you would tell your mate while making love.
“Probably shouldn’t have started off with that,” Dean said and hurried after him. “So, apparently, we’re in some kind of cuddle relationship?” he asked once he had caught up with him and was once more blocking his way. “Which I was completely unaware of, and I wouldn’t have cuddled with Inias if you had… you know,
Just like that, he was back to scenting, hugging and kissing him, and the next thing Castiel knew, his character was naked right there on the field, face down and ass high up in the air.
Naturally, he did end up with a load of Dean’s spunk in his ass, but that couldn’t have been the alpha’s only reason to visit him since he stayed the night.
Having purchased the full package, he was allowed to mark this omega, so he joined him in the nest and began biting at his neck. Mating was off the table for obvious reasons, but some bites and nibbles around the mating gland would serve the purpose of sending a clear message to the next alpha in rut Cas would service: They should go look for another omega to knot and dump their load into. This one was off limits.
It started off simple enough, with Dean’s arms around Cas’ shoulders, his chin resting on Cas’ head in a sort of lying hug while Cas was snuggling up against his side, their legs intermingling. Simple, but hella comfortable. Cuddlibi really knew what they were doing. In some of the cuddle positions, Cas would wrap himself around Dean until he couldn’t really tell where Cas started and he began.
Still, if this continued, things could get awkward, so Dean quickly thought of the most unsexy thoughts he could think of. Luckily,
“It does if combined with article 52 paragraph 3. Wasn’t this huge company in Iowa sued out of existence because of it?” Sam raised his eyebrows at Castiel as if expecting him to agree with him.
He managed to hold his tongue throughout the drive home since he really didn’t want to get into another argument and have Cas break up with him
There were exceptions, of course. Family members or close friends might scent each other without sexual intent, which was probably why Doctor Fuller had suggested these two groups as candidates when he had first brought up scenting therapy.
You gotta play the hand you're dealt, though, Dean had learned that the hard way. This might be his last chance of getting to have Cas in that way, and he wouldn’t spend it wishing for something he couldn’t have.
Dean shrugged, all casual and ‘no big deal,’ which told Cas that he had a stupid idea that would end with them being arrested for trespassing just because of some stupid dare to enter a supposedly haunted house. But who knew—maybe one of Dean’s crazy ideas was just what he needed.
There was a reason he had chosen to become a paramedic. Saving people, helping them. He hated seeing someone in pain. And while Cas hadn’t been in pain, he had smelled sad. Lost.
Once there was nothing left to prepare, they played some board games they had found in one of the cabinets, and Cas got all excited when he found a game of Twister. Of course, Dean gave in—there was no way he could say no to Cas’ big, hopeful eyes—and it actually turned out to be a lot of fun.
“Gabe,” Cas cut in to put an end to their verbal exchange. “Can you wait in the kitchen and give us some time to get dressed?”
That—didn’t sound like a ‘See you later, gotta go.’ While Cas was stumped that this didn’t turn out the way he had expected, Dean went on, “Lowers stress levels, boosts your immune system, keeps you in a good mood…”
“Oh no, this isn’t a mating bite,” Castiel quickly corrected him. “This is just…” How to delicately put it? “…a normal bite,” he finished a bit lamely.
Cas had no idea how to react to Dean’s presence right now. He could barely hold it together as it was, and here Dean was, all concern and… looking like he could make everything better with a simple touch. Maybe a hug if Cas was lucky. If not, then his presence seemed like enough to loosen the knots in his stomach.
The last few times, he’d had to take care of it by himself because omegas weren’t very keen on helping an alpha through his rut if it was just a one-night stand. Rut sex was something omegas only wanted to engage in if there was some commitment to go along with it.
Would you look at that, Cas’ face could get even redder. Seducing this omega was going to be so much fun!
In order to control his emotions and not come across as a total wuss, he focused on asking the doctor, a small, bespectacled beta with kind eyes, all of his questions.
“A bit too nice,” Dean murmured and when Cas tilted his head at him, he reassured him, “I didn’t mean
If anyone asked, he was just doing what his doctor had told him to do: letting his omega out a bit more.
This time, Jimmy had been scared as well, but right now, he had gone back to sleep, his terror over, at peace once more.
“I think it would be more authentic if we lost our shirts,” Castiel suggested. “You’d have better access to my neck that way.”
supposed to be here. “Dean—are you…” Castiel started, but that was impossible. He had been fine just a few minutes ago when Castiel had visited him in his dreams.
without Mike’s permission. Without paying Mike for any of the touches. That’s what it had always been about. Cas had brought in a lot of money and of course Mike would be mad that he had lost that income when Cas had managed to escape. Cas couldn’t even imagine what kind of punishment Mike would think up if he ever got to him.
Okay, maybe Dean should be supportive and whatnot, but this was ridiculous. As far as practical jokes went, this one wasn’t even funny.
Since Castiel wasn’t his real mate, he could do nothing but fake a smile and say, “Have fun,” even though he hoped Dean didn’t have fun, not even a little bit.
They were in their pajamas, ready to finally spend the night together without any interruptions when Cas was showing him his favorite cuddle position, and that one was… some advanced cuddling technique right there.
For the most part, Cas made something up on the spot, but he really hoped that Dean wouldn’t research it further and find something that contradicted what Cas had told him. He might actually misinform Dean for all he knew, which was probably not fair to Dean, who was just curious about his friend’s sexuality, but what was Cas supposed to do?
Castiel rolled his eyes, but he did pay close attention, just in case he found himself face-to-face with the human—
Benny looked from Hannah to Sam and then to Anael. “I say we listen to the hunter.” There was a sentence he thought he’d never hear Benny say. “Best plan I’ve heard yet.”
He couldn’t believe that his heat was already over! Whenever he was alone, it sure seemed to take a long time.
After a while, Cas said, “Hang on,” his brows furrowed as if he was trying to work out an equation, and then his hand was
Castiel’s brain short-circuited. Or maybe it was his heart. Probably both. He wanted to say so much at once, but what came out was a simple, “I can’t.”
Alphas got through their ruts alone all the time. What could go wrong if he didn’t go out to look for an omega for his next rut?
Dean grinned at Jimmy, but he didn’t look amused, so Dean let his gaze drift across the room, trying to find something else to do.
It wasn’t like they hadn’t done their fair share of scenting over the years—as roommates did. They were, after all, extremely scent-compatible. It would have been weird if they
Castiel looked at the knife curiously and then pulled it out and held it out for Dean, who looked at it as if this was a trap before taking it back without ever taking his eyes off Castiel.
That made the alpha go wild. He thrashed around underneath him, arousal peaking, so Dean did it again, biting harder to keep him in place so that he could deliver another punishing thrust.
He helped Dean up, who was smiling brightly and then squeezed his arm softly in an invitation to put it around him because he was going for a hug. Or a side hug at least, putting his own arm around Cas’ shoulder to draw him towards him so that he could kiss him right on the cheek, keeping them connected like that for a long moment before he let go again.
So, he whispered, “Don’t hurt me,” and began moving again, pushing the rest of the way down and thus taking the entire length of Dean’s cock into his body.
But there was no turning back now. With a flick of his wrist, he disarmed Dean while still holding the hunter back with his magic, arm outstretched. No more pretending. This was who he was.
If Cas didn’t want a rim job, maybe he also wasn’t big on being fingered. Plus, this was foreplay, which Cas had said he didn’t need.
When Cas had admitted that he didn’t know any of those songs, Dean had looked at him like he was from Mars. The next time, he brought a mixtape with thirteen of his favorite Led Zeppelin songs. Apparently, it was a gift.
Dean and sleep did not get along. He rarely got more than four hours a night, and those four hours were usually filled with nightmares of patients he couldn’t save dying a gruesome death.
“No way, man,” Dean interrupted him. “We’re not taking any risks here. Half an hour a day? I’m totally there. If it’s ‘at least’ half an hour, we should probably better make it an hour.”
From then on, Dean tried switching it up, changing positions, spooning him from behind and letting his hands roam all over the omega to cuddle him more ‘actively.’
A few seconds ticked by in silence and then Cas let go of Dean’s hand, which promptly fell down onto the table between them.
They were currently staying at an inn. While their characters were asleep, they had time to plan their next step on their journey. Unfortunately, the shaman hadn’t been of much help in finding the spirit of the old Viking whose treasure they were after.
He just wished he had gotten a last cuddle. The last time they had kissed, he’d had no idea they might have to go their separate ways so soon.
In any case, Dean had never really thought about what an omega in heat was like (apart from watching the occasional heat porno, but he knew that that wasn’t reality, no matter what Charlie said). He had not expected
It had been Cas’ idea to get mated outside of his heat because while in heat, they might both feel the raw
At that moment, he hated that Cas looked great as always. Of course, Dean had to look like some kind of loser who was drinking himself to sleep over his lost love.
In response, Cas pushed his ass up higher, making Dean falter in his rhythm because the slick channel was gripping his cock so tight.
Dean had to bite his own lip to keep himself from moaning Jimmy’s name. Unfortunately, Dean couldn’t see everything because the window wasn’t big enough to give him an unobstructed view, but just
Pinching the bridge of his nose, Dean sighed. The beta didn’t look like it, but maybe this was a shakedown.
That shut him up and finally, he got with the program. They stumbled their way to the bed while Dean frenched Cas for all he was worth.
He remembered what Cas had tried to tell him earlier and realized that Cas must have played with himself before Dean arrived.
He had thought Impala’s comment earlier about ‘giving his omega a fuck’ had been a joke. How was that going to take care of his very
Remembering how much Cas had liked a tender lick to his scent gland, Dean got bold and let the tip of his tongue dart out for a quick taste.
It turned out Dean hadn’t thought this all the way through. This was the omega who had been inadvertently teasing and taunting him for
“I don’t have time for this,” Cas decided as he got up and gathered up the plates. “I actually have to go to the bookstore.”
Although probably not anymore. Cas had probably thrown all of his stuff out. Because he never wanted to see or talk to Dean again. Which, you know, not that Dean cared or anything.
Only when Dean arrived at Cas’ place that day, the omega wasn’t in the best mood, so all the courage Dean had gathered on his way here kind of left him.
“But you’ve slept with that omega chick. April something.” And yeah, sure, that had been a disaster, but it couldn’t have turned him
By the end of his heat, he had four more bottles for Gabe to sell. Since heat slick was more expensive, Gabe had tried to get him to provide it for ages. Up until now, Castiel had refused. It had seemed too intimate in a way.
That made perfect sense. Cas rocked into Dean’s mouth and was so close to spending himself down his throat when—
But then Cas’ hand slipped further to his wrist and pulled his arm up over the cover. Oh, he just wanted to check the watch. Not that Dean was disappointed or anything.
There was no way he would give Cas up that easily, so there was really only one thing for Dean to do.
Pacing back and forth in an attempt to keep his alpha from going stir-crazy, he continuously glanced at his watch. His rut brain came up with images of Cas, on his knees, bare ass in the air, ready to let Dean have his way with him.
Castiel had only visited them a few weeks back to trade for some rarer herbs. Everything had seemed so normal.
Since hanging around after the others had left would raise suspicion, he left with them, looking back at Dean one more time, trying to figure out if he was mad that Castiel had ruined his get-together with his friends. Dean wasn’t looking at him, though. He was rather good at pretending Castiel was nothing special to him. Certainly no secret mate. Or anyone he would ever look at with lust in his eyes.
“Why are you smiling? Didn’t you hear me tell you that I’m mated to the biggest assbutt in the universe?”
Dean was so glad when Gabe finally packed his things and went back home. He hadn’t known that scent-blocking someone was a thing, but Gabe definitely excelled at it.
Even just knowing that he’d get to have unprotected sex with an omega in heat seemed to placate his alpha to some extent, seeing as the next few days, he was more docile than he’d been in months.
Some strange instinct made Dean knot him too. Of course, he’d never even thought about knotting an alpha, but right then, the urge to go all the way had been impossible to fight.
long time. Nowadays, he never got more than a couple hours of sleep at a time, too scared of the dreams that haunted him or of being found by Mike’s pack.
Unfortunately, even his nonverbal communication skills seemed to need some work because Dean let up and looked down at him with a worried frown on his face. “’m I hurting you?” he asked.
“No, I’m telling you. He conveniently bumped into me and then at home I realized the pack of gum I had in my pocket was missing.”
When Dean’s nose brushed against his own scent gland, he tilted his head to the side in a very un-alphalike fashion. But his omega really needed to show Dean’s alpha the respect that he deserved, and he had wanted to show a sign of submission again ever since Dean had gone for his neck at the gym.
Castiel remembered the beam of magic hitting Anael square in the chest. In a way, the magic of the witches who had lost their lives had saved Castiel’s.
The omega was rather forward. That alone would have been enough to turn Dean off from pursuing anything. He was an alpha. He liked the chase. The way Cas stood his ground and Dean had to nudge him a few times before he showed him the long line of his throat… now,
It had been vacant for a few months, so Cas wasn’t surprised when one hot summer day when he was just about to open his shop, he saw a couple of workers outside the building.
idea! They’d just stay scent-bonded. Of course, Dean knew that there was no way he’d find someone else he’d rather be scent-bonded to, but there was no reason to point that out and freak Cas out. After all, if it was up to Dean, the omega would totally be stuck with him for a long time.
This seemed to spur the alpha on. He pulled halfway out and then thrust back into him roughly. Castiel tried in vain to suppress the groans. There was no mistaking what was happening to him right now. He was being fucked by another alpha, pulled back onto his cock with each thrust like some omega.
“She was human, you see,” Cas finally continued, “and I used to feed on her hugs. That was like candy for us. Anna and me. And one day, I hugged her goodbye.” He paused for a moment before adding, “She died that same night.”
Yes, he wanted to be close to his pup, and yes, he wouldn’t mind fucking Cas from time to time. But it was more than that. So much more.
Waking up next to Dean that morning was different, even though they had woken up next to each other before on multiple occasions. But this time, he woke up to Dean’s protective arm around his waist, and the claim on his neck reminded him of what they had done last night.
Cas was just getting ready to implement said plan when he looked at Dean and saw the alpha slowly blink his eyes open.
Tonight, Dean had invited him over, which was a first, but he assumed Dean didn’t want to always be the one to make the drive.
Being cuddled up to a sleeping Jimmy on the couch, the TV flickering, but muted, Dean finally felt his alpha calm down.
“What the hell?” In typical hunter fashion, Dean was reaching for his weapon, but Castiel held him back.
For an omega, she had a rather high sex drive and Castiel simply didn’t care much for mounting omegas. He did it more out of obligation than anything, but secretly, he was glad when it was over.
able to share a bed platonically. Alpha bros did it all the time. Granted, most of them were teenagers at slumber parties, but Dean’s bed was plenty big enough for it not to turn into some weird gay thing.
He looked over at Sam for help, but Sam was just stuffing the last book into a huge bag and got up. “Seems like you have this under control,” he said.
kind of intimacy, and scenting seemed like a good place to start. He was still very confused about everything that had just happened here and he needed something else from the alpha now that the rough fuck was over.
“You can use Justin,” Hannah offered, which wasn’t the fastest method of communication. It was better than nothing, though.
Unimpressed, Cas rolled his eyes. “You can stop the posturing, Dean. I’m not here to take your non-existent omega away from you.”
Great. Trying (and most likely failing) to scent a stranger wasn’t high on his list of things he enjoyed doing. But it didn’t seem like he’d get around it, and if it got Sam to sign off on whatever meds or surgery he needed to get his sense of smell back, he had no choice but to go along with it.
Perfect. Now he had complete access. He made sure to use gentle, slow strokes and caresses as the book had suggested.
gland—sent a tingling jolt of electricity to every nerve ending in his body. Of course, being kissed by Dean
Castiel shook his head. He had been here before, that’s why it was familiar. Two years flew by. Sometimes, it might simply seem like yesterday.
Oh yeah. That one had been Cas’ fault, too. Damn, but that omega was driving up his expenses for electronic devices.
There was a lot of laughter and exuberance, and halfway through the evening, Castiel realized that he was actually having
“There is nothing to deal with. He’s a friend who thinks this kind of prank is funny. I’ll just give him a quick call.” Only his cell was back at the bunker. Which was probably the reason Dean hadn’t tried calling him. “Does anyone have a cell phone I could borrow?”
“Bad news?” he asked, nodding towards the busted cell phone next to Cas’ keys on the little table beside the door.
Stepping back wasn’t really an option for Dean here. He was an alpha, after all, and he’d been standing here, in his own bedroom, mind you, first. “Cas… Do you mind?” he said instead, motioning towards the narrow space between them.
clueless? How could anyone not know that cuddling with someone else was a deep betrayal of trust once you had developed such an intimate cuddle relationship like he and Dean had?
Castiel clutched his chest. “What an unexpected outcome! I am indignant on my behalf because I had no idea and I am utterly blindsided by this astonishing turn of events! Who could have
“You’re taking this crap with you when you leave, by the way,” Dean said to Sam as he motioned to the mess of papers on the table.
Mission ‘get this omega ready to take his cock’ was a go. First step: make him crazy with wanton lust so that the inside of his ass was nice and wet.
It seemed like he had removed his foot from his mouth because Cas’ scent turned calm, and he returned to snuggling against him.
“We can try for the first time after five months,” Castiel summed up what the webpage said. “But it probably won’t be successful then.”
The scenting and teasing and fondling felt so intimate that Cas’ omega desperately wanted to submit to his mate.
in heat, and if they kept this up, Dean would most likely send him into heat early again. So, he reluctantly pulled away.
Cas’ scent was about to turn distressed again, so Dean leaned in close, making sure Cas got a whiff of his scent, which always managed to calm him down.
The reason for the affectionate behavior was obvious: It was a way to prevent Castiel’s character from developing another case of pining sickness.
At first, Cas hadn’t really understood the words Dean had said, but the tone of his voice in combination with his scent had been enough for him to return to reality much faster than usual.
He continuously had to keep his omega from snuggling up against the alpha, maybe scenting him a bit while he was at it because Dean’s scent was all around him and driving him slowly insane.
“No kidding,” Dean grunted, hips bucking helplessly into the air, now that Castiel’s mouth was no longer on his dick.
The day before, breakfast had ended in a hot make-out session, and today, the conversation was stilted at best.
Heaving a silent sigh, Dean pulled back some more, almost falling off the side of the bed, and that’s when Cas’ eyes opened and locked with Dean’s.
Castiel put his hands into his trench coat pockets to search for something he could pass off as ‘Dean’s thing,’ but he came up empty. Neither his keys nor the pack of gum seemed to fit the bill.
, though. At least the irresistible smell that movies and books were always on about had been spot-on.
Dean, who had his arms wrapped around him and was in the process of peppering him with kisses, stopped short. “Uhm…” He scratched the back of his neck. “No. Cuddle hour is for free.”
Dean stopped fucking into him and even let his dick slip out of Cas’ hole, ignoring the omega’s wail of protest.
He liked playing with an omega’s hole, teasing the omega mercilessly until he was truly desperate for Dean’s cock. Since Cas was in heat, his ass was already leaking some slick, which Dean lapped right up, ignoring Cas’ squeaky “Dean!”
Damn, maybe he shouldn’t tell his little brother every little detail about this arrangement he had with Cas.
“I didn’t mean like that!” Cas said quickly as he snatched Dean’s hand and put it back on his chest. “I like that.”
But I also have 10 commenters who commented 10 times or more. 💕 A huge thanks to all those commenters who have kept this story going! ❤️
Cas smiled at him and it was the challenging quality to his smile that had Dean decide that he would not back down. Not this time! He was the alpha and this was
Cas didn’t start searching for his things, though. He was back to staring at Dean, and when he had finally figured it out, he said, half question, but equal part statement, “You really miss him.”
They had fucked their way through countless sexual positions, scenting each other almost aggressively, but they had yet to kiss.
Dean smiled at that. “Yeah, it’s my lucky shirt.” The smile turned more into a smirk before he added, “So, you’re saying chances are I’m getting laid tonight?”
“Yeah, me too.” If all went well, they might only have one more week to go until he could hold his omega in his arms again.
“Do you like me cuddling you like that, Dean?” Cas asked, which meant he didn’t have Dean’s dick in his mouth, which in return made Dean raise his hips, chasing that warm, wet feeling.
On his way home, his cell phone pinged and when he saw that Dean had sent him his rut calendar, he had to smile.
He definitely didn’t think about the alphas he’d fucked when he was beating one off. But thoughts of the blue-eyed alpha came at the most inopportune moments, which was starting to get annoying.
Decision made, Dean said, “You know what, we usually give out our cell phone numbers if an omega wants to request the same alpha again. Leaves the phone lines at MEAT open for new clients.”
The thought of inviting Dean to mark him gave him a thrill, the tingling sensation of being head over heels for this alpha spreading throughout his entire body as always in Dean’s presence.
, who still didn’t have a clue that continuously bumping Dean’s scent gland with his nose was generally considered a come on, so he figured he was safe.
Still deep in his thoughts, he startled when Dean, who had just finished his dessert, casually took Cas’ hand—right there on the table in plain sight.
was that the mating hormones kept Dean from hooking up with anyone else. Normally, for every alpha he fucked at Purgaytory, he would go out and find himself a few omegas to bang to balance things out.
“Whoa,” Impala said, and Castiel couldn’t agree more. “Looks like your omega is getting ridden hard.” There was a teasing quality to his words again, but somehow, the comment also sounded a bit out of breath.
“My alpha is going to hate this,” Dean said when Cas told him what was about to happen. “Not being able to help his omega in heat.”
It probably meant that there would be no sex tonight because clearly, they needed to talk about things—what was Jimmy comfortable with, did he even
Being a great kisser was probably a prerequisite for working at MEAT. It sure left omegas all weak in the knees.
And even though they’d apologized to each other, their fight officially over—Dean didn’t really feel a lot better.
Dean didn’t know if he should laugh or cry. As if there was a chance in hell he would ever voluntarily leave his family.
Oh. Yeah, okay. The scent of an alpha in rut probably turned Cas on. Who was Dean to take that away from him when Cas was about to let him use his ass for his own personal pleasure? It wasn’t like Dean would scent back or anything.
There were a few fairies from Fairy Valley, a vampire, a couple of other witches—among them Hannah, of course—and some other creatures, all standing in a big circle around an angel statue who went by the name of ‘Anael’ and was the leader of the MCAK.
That was it. He had postponed thinking about it long enough. Since his friends hadn’t been very helpful, he decided that the internet would probably be able to help him make sense of what was going on.
Trying to ignore the growing tingling in his own neck, he brought his teeth out to play, nibbling all around Cas’ mating gland in a way he knew the omega loved. Cas would so be giving in long before he would.
Since he still had his eyes closed, the scent was the first thing that told him that Dean was, in fact, angry about that revelation. He knew it. Opening his eyes, he extracted himself from the intimate embrace and sat up in bed, his back against the headboard, to make it easier for Dean to leave.
—his hand was moving. The one that was still on his dick. It was a very light fondling. Cas was only tracing the contours of his cock through his pants, but in combination with his tongue down Cas’ throat, Dean’s dick hardened like no one’s business.
“I’ll pick a motel that’s closer next time,” Dean relented, which wasn’t exactly what Castiel had meant, but Dean had already turned around and walked out the door without a backward glance.
So, of course, they would keep asking Castiel to bring his mate, and he was slowly running out of excuses for always leaving ‘Mandy’ at home—apart from the fact that she didn’t exist.
Castiel tried to remember if hunters were after fairies, too, but Dean just sat back on the blanket they shared and rummaged around in his backpack.
Every instinct in him was telling him to make a nest for Cas, give him foot rubs and make him dinner, kiss that cute omega all over… Yet, he could do none of those things!
Meanwhile, the annoyed frown on Zachariah’s face grew more pronounced. He pointed a finger at Castiel and said, “Don’t leave the building. I’ll be right back.”
Just in time. Dean had been overcome by the urge to take Cas into his arms, encircle him, cuddle him, make him feel safe in Dean’s embrace. This was more than a desire to scent mark. This was… something else. A longing for a deeper connection maybe.
Wobbling on his feet a bit, he realized that the only alpha whose protection his omega craved was right here in front of him.
“So…” Dean cleared his throat. “Just so we’re clear that I’m the higher-ranking alpha.” That’s what this exercise had been about, after all. At least it seemed important that
With one swift move, Dean just pulled him right onto his lap, Cas’ legs on either side of his thighs, and kissed him roughly.
It also begged the question: Was that something he had done with Balthazar, too? Cas had said they hadn’t fucked, but maybe he didn’t count blowjobs.
“Well…” In order for that to work, he had to know more about that curse. “I would have to examine the… cursed area.”
That brought Castiel up short. How could that be? There was simply no way Anna would have broken his heart. Dean was the perfect match for her, she was supposed to be madly in love with him too. (Who wouldn’t be?)
Castiel couldn’t help but smile wistfully. His friends didn’t banter with just anyone. They seemed to have accepted Dean and Sam, considering them as worthy.
He turned around to reach for the water bottle on the back seat. Time to stop being a jerk and be helpful instead of upsetting the omega who was carrying his pup.
From his time with Michael, he had gotten used to prepping himself beforehand so that it wouldn’t hurt too much. Using a lot of lube helped a little since he had problems getting slick enough, even during his heats.
Now, how would a person look at Dean who wasn’t in love with him? Less staring, probably, so Castiel looked away and around his shop. That didn’t seem right, either. He couldn’t talk to Dean without looking at him, so his eyes found Dean’s again and he gave him the look you were supposed to give a person you were about to curse. That should work as a convincing ‘I’m not in love with you’ look.
So, he asked, a bit awkwardly, “Does it cost the same if I want you for an additional hour for just… just being here, no sex? Just… lying here together?”
So, here Castiel was, for his check-up a few weeks after the accident, no idea what Dr. “Call me Sam” Winchester was thinking. He had a smile on his face and had been nothing but friendly towards him, but Castiel knew for a fact that people who were smiling on the outside weren’t necessarily smiling on the inside, too.
Lately, he had caught himself staring at Dean’s biceps or ogling his bowlegs during their workout. That, he could deal with. After all, he had been attracted to Dean from the get go, nothing new there. It was just some physical attraction because, let’s face it, Dean was without a doubt the single most attractive alpha he had ever seen. Now, though, it seemed to have become about more than physical attraction and that, Cas could not risk.
That might be the reason why he kept to himself. Alphas who were attracted to alphas were still harassed even today.
here,” Dean said as he dropped the burger onto his plate, ignoring Sam’s pointed look of ‘You should know better.’ He was the host tonight, and by Dean’s own rules, that meant it was burger night. “Cas is getting impatient.”
Occasionally, Cas wondered why Dean never initiated one of those make out sessions. It was always him who had to start the kissing. Once he did, Dean was immediately on board, returning the kisses enthusiastically while his hand found its way under Cas’ shirt, but if Cas
“Aren’t you a bit old for getting into alpha fights?” Sam asked, disapproving. “And with one of your best friends, what’s that about?”
“Just for the record, any other omega, I’d have won for sure,” Dean said while they were still lying in bed together, snuggling in order to calm their alpha and omega down.
He knew they were only teasing. Still, there was nothing else to say but, “Fuck you, I’m an awesome friend.”
He tried glaring at Dean for good measure, but the position he was in didn’t really lend itself to intimidation tactics. Maybe he should bare his teeth in the universal sign of ‘back off!’
“You didn’t smell anything at all, even when scenting an alpha?” Sam checked, scribbling something on his clipboard.
Castiel’s eyes flitted to the name embroidered on the alpha’s jacket, ‘D. Winchester.’ If he had his sense of smell, he would have picked up on the familial relation between the two Winchesters immediately. He couldn’t wait to get it back so that he could make sense of the world again without having to play detective.
spot again, and Castiel’s dick started shooting come everywhere as his knot desperately tried to knot something that wasn’t there.
He hardly noticed Dean, Sam, and Benny jumping out from behind the pillars to attack the witch, who started flickering back and forth between both worlds. Castiel might have seen some of that fight before, once, in a vision.
Since they weren’t teenagers and couldn’t just start full-on making out, they did a lot of hand flirting. They’d intertwine their fingers, Dean’s thumb would lightly caress the inside of his wrist, and Cas was sure he could feel his pulse fluttering because… well, he was an omega in love, and having Dean touch him always made his heart do funny things. Nothing new there.
There was a sad tilt to his mouth and he wrapped his arms around himself to brace himself for the answer.
Dean’s clothes magically vanished too—Bees must have gotten rid of them—and when he clicked on the omega again, there were some new actions to choose from.
Just the thought of it reawakened the butterflies in his stomach. Since this was just a game, it was the perfect opportunity to sleep with his crush without alerting him to the fact that he had even developed a crush on him in the first place.
He splashed some water on his face and took a few deep breaths. He felt like he was going insane with the need to scent Cas back. Well, and if he was honest with himself, he wanted to do more than scent, too.
Not so bad? Yeah, okay, Dean would take it. Maybe one day he could convince Cas that he was more than a ‘not so bad’ mate. That he was, in fact, a mate Cas would like to stick around. And then they could stay fake mated forever.
As soon as he realized how creepy he was being, he dropped the blanket like a hot potato and sat up.
Lying in bed, his back to Dean, he wished he hadn’t reacted that way. He felt cold where he could be held by Dean’s strong arms instead like the night before.
Zachariah didn’t seem happy that Cas had made him wait a few minutes before answering the door. He seemed even less happy when he scented the air, no doubt smelling Dean. Cas just hoped he didn’t smell anything else—like what they had been up to.
That was why Cas was currently sitting in front of his bedroom mirror, trying to use a red pen on his mating gland to make it look like an alpha had nibbled on it. It turned out, faking a hickey was more difficult than one would expect.
“Wanna go for a deeper massage?” Dean asked, his tone all alpha seduction while he rubbed his cockhead up and down Cas’ crack, spreading and smearing the slick across his hungry hole, which was fluttering in excitement. It hadn’t had an alpha’s cock in there in forever and
It turned out that the alpha had cooked for him, and so they enjoyed a nice meal together before the scenting even started.
Cas had kept staring at Dean while they had both chased their orgasms, not letting him break eye contact for even a second. It had worked too—Dean had basically ignored that skank of an omega he’d been with in favor of watching Cas.
The alpha’s fascination with angels and wings suddenly made so much sense. Of course, his perfect mate would be a fallen angel.
Dean’s explanation made perfect sense to Cas, who had nodded along, surprised at how much research Dean had done on this topic.
He fucked him for a long time after that, slow and deep, until Cas was a whimpering mess, begging for release. Only then did Dean pull out and take Cas’ cock between his lips, slowly laving the head with his tongue. He had barely begun to suckle gently when Cas’ whole body seized up and he came with a strangled sound.
Fascinated by how much oil was leaking out of the glands when he massaged them just right, Dean used one finger to try and tease one of the glands open until he could push the fingertip inside.
As it turned out, Sam had no good news on Friday. Apparently, Zachariah was well within his rights to promote Michael over an unmated omega. Even though that was pretty much what Castiel had expected, on some level, he had hoped Sam would find him a way out of this situation.
This was the best opportunity he’d get, so Dean took a deep breath of his own and went for it. “There’s something I’d like to know, but I didn’t know how to ask. So, here goes, I guess. What kind of intimate cuddles are you comfortable with? I mean, I liked what we did the other day, but I have no idea if you’d maybe enjoy it if I did that for you, too. Obviously, I wouldn’t want you to do it just for me in case you don’t enjoy it…” Okay, now he was official babbling, so he cut himself off.
for it, plunging his hands deep into his feathers, mumbling the occasional “wow” as he was inspecting Castiel’s wings.
Against all efforts, he had to have drifted off eventually anyway because he startled awake when a heavy arm was flung across his chest. It was still pitch-black, but feeling for the edge of the bed, he ascertained that yes, he was still very much on his side of the bed. Dean was the one who had rolled over in his sleep and was now crowding Castiel.
“Should I inspect your penis to look for traces of the curse?” Castiel offered because lately, they had only ever had sex, but he had made no other attempt to help break the curse. And while all the sex had been great, he wanted Dean to sleep with him because he
“Thank you, Dean,” Castiel said as he got up to get dressed again. That wasn’t really all that easy with his wings in the way, so he finally tucked them back into the ethereal plane, which worked just fine now that Dean had groomed them and they had apparently gotten what they had craved.
Their encounters took on another, more intimate quality from then on. The fact that Dean was now allowed to scent Cas as thoroughly as Cas scented him also meant that it was easier for Dean to stealthily scent-mark the omega, doing his best to continue to protect him.
And that’s what he held on to once he was back home. Of course, Cas didn’t bring it up again, so it seemed like Dean would just have to suck it up and lust in private.
“You’re not allowed to let strangers scent you,” the one with the expensive black suit and balding grey hair told Jimmy, his voice unnecessarily harsh.
Cas rolled his eyes at that. “That had nothing to do with you being an idiot and everything with your subpar driving skills.”
“I mean… sure,” Dean said because Cas was probably the person he was closest to in the whole world, even including Sam. Not that he could put it in as many words. Or any words, really. But Cas had to know that.
Well, if Dean wasn’t allowed to scent, he’d at least get a taste! Cas’ dick in his hand grew even harder, but Dean was pretty much just holding it at this point, not offering any friction.
baring it, but seeing if he could elicit a reaction. Alphas usually reacted to omegas baring their necks. Of course, Dean wasn’t an omega, but it would stand to reason that Jimmy, who was into alphas, would react to an alpha baring his neck in a similar way.
But Dean’s instincts were going haywire. There were so many things he wanted to do all at once: reach out and wrap Jimmy up in a comforting hug, look for danger, rip whoever made Jimmy smell all scared a new one…
Inias was the first cuddlibus apart from Cas and his sister that Dean had ever met. He would have been curious to see him and Cas interact, but Cas was nowhere to be seen. He didn’t like meeting new people, so he was probably holed up in his room. It reminded Dean of back in the day when he had occasionally brought a one-night stand home. Cas had never been around then, either.
Also not on their list, and something Dean was thinking more and more about: kissing. Maybe Dean should have suggested it, but he had chickened out. He really didn’t want Cas to turn him down. Better to not ask at all than ask and be denied.
After that one midnight call, it became a tradition that at the end of their evenings together, he would sing to the pup. That was a bit strange since there wasn’t even a pup bump and the fetus surely wasn’t capable of hearing anything yet, but the alpha had a beautiful voice and Cas liked listening to it, so he just enjoyed Dean singing a different song to their pup each evening.
, that means we figure this out, right?” Dean finally focused on another aspect after reassuring him that he would never hurt an innocent witch.
Sometimes, Dean would accidentally brush against him when he left. The alpha wasn’t even aware of it, but he occasionally left his scent on Cas. It almost felt like being scent-marked, and it felt
His revelation that he enjoyed submitting to alphas was floating through Dean’s mind. Since they were both on board, it was high time that Dean made him take his cock.
Ever since Dean had stopped picking up omegas for his ruts, he was having a harder time managing them. But he just wasn’t in his twenties anymore (and just barely still in his thirties), so the whole ‘fling to get him through his rut’ thing was getting old.
Dean faltered in his jackhammer rhythm when he realized that his knot was starting to form. This hardly ever happened when he was with an alpha, but he just went with the flow and pushed the knot against the alpha’s rim with each new thrust.
It went to voicemail, which was to be expected, but what he hadn’t expected was hearing the message,
After a typical alpha standoff with some back and forth and a lot of glaring at each other, Dean was allowed to stay.
There was even a ‘find lost mates’ site, but there were just alphas looking for their omega mates and the other way around. Still, Castiel made an account and posted his story. When the only response he got was homophobic people telling him that alphas couldn’t (and shouldn’t) mate each other, he logged out again.
Cas, stubborn omega that he was, rolled his eyes. “I am not going to kiss my own arm,” he said, unimpressed.
“I already apologized. I was unaware humans are so particular about nakedness. I don’t know why—you’re clearly very attractive by human standards…”
But then a distressed scent hit his nose, and Dean was immediately on high alert, ready to fight an intruder if need be.
As soon as Cas’ eyes landed on Sam, he faltered in his steps and said, without inflection, “Sam. You’re here, too.”
“Anything goes,” Dean reminded him, and yes, sure, that had been the agreement. “You saying you want me to fuck you now?”
A little bit of research told him that Cas would have to scent an alpha at least two to three times a week for about thirty minutes. Dean would have to fill out a questionnaire about what kind of scents Cas had (or hadn’t) picked up on. It might take a while for Cas to pick up on anything at all, but once he did, they’d have to move away from the scent gland and Cas basically had to relearn how to scent.
Jimmy opened his mouth, and Dean could see from the frown on his face that he was about to say something Dean didn’t want to hear, so he made sure he was quicker.
“Look, Casanova, I don’t care if you’re some hotshot alpha. I bet I’d be able to kick your ass either way. Now, we both know that Cassie can use a good lay, so have at it.”
Once that piece clicked into place, running the numbers was very easy. The solution, however, was devastating.
He had tomorrow off. If he drove through without taking any breaks, he could totally make it to Purgaytory for an alpha fight and back before he had to be back at the garage.
There was an awkward moment when they said goodbye where Castiel wanted to tip Dean and the alpha looked at him with wide eyes and declined the money.
As soon as Dean had parked the car in front of Cas’ house, the omega got out with a terse, “Thank you for driving me.”
Dean complied by sliding a finger into his ass and going straight for his prostate. One of his favorite games was seeing how wet he could get Cas before he mounted him. He liked teasing Cas to the brink of orgasm a few times using his tongue and fingers until Cas couldn’t take it anymore.
It had been instincts more than anything that had made Dean lean in. Sleep-tousled Jimmy looked really adorable after all.
He now knew why it was doctor recommended. For one, it seemed like they really did have the best-looking, best-smelling alphas like advertised. And not just that—the alphas really knew what they were doing. Dean had no doubt had tons of heat sex because he knew just how to touch him to make Castiel’s omega feel… things he’d never felt during a heat before.
Of course, the claiming bite should have made that clear, but Cas had been the one to ask for it. Hearing it confirmed that it meant to Dean the same it did to Cas was a whole other thing.
to call Dean for another appointment. He had missed his scent like crazy. But Dean had made it perfectly clear that he didn’t want to smell his scent and Cas knew he had to rip off the band-aid before it was too late.
bad. Being separated from his scent-bond partner would sure be difficult on the both of them. It was a good job, though, which would pay well.
The last time after they had been intimate, Dean had gotten out of bed as soon as his knot had gone down. It had been more of a ‘Thanks for the fuck, I’ll be on my way’ kind of thing. That seemed to be Dean’s style. He didn’t seem like the kind of man who would hang around for too long. He had appeared out of nowhere—it was just logical that he would disappear just as quickly.
Cas didn’t stop urging him on, and when Dean leaned down to go for a deeper angle, he realized Cas wasn’t mumbling ‘fuck me’ after all. It was “Love me!”
Okay then. It wasn’t like Dean had any objections if it meant he got to hold and scent Cas in return.
After Dean’s rut was finally over (Cas had counted the days), Cas had been happy to find no trace of omega scent on Dean when they next met up. Of course, Dean probably scrubbed himself clean of any lingering scent, but Cas’ omega was satisfied anyway after inconspicuously scenting down Dean’s arms, his hair—pretty much any place he could safely get away with.
Of course, licking at Cas’ neck hadn’t helped that situation one bit. It was actually kind of fun. Even though it wasn’t his dick in Cas’ hole, he still had the alpha in a submissive posture, what with his neck bared and all.
“No—hear me out! All I can think about is biting you again.” Wait. That came out wrong. “Also, y’know. Your lips are kissable.” There, better.
Now, he needed a plan for how to proceed from here. Drunken half-assed confessions clearly couldn’t land him an alpha like Jimmy. Of course, he deserved more than that. Dean would have to make sure Jimmy knew he wasn’t just some kind of alphasexual experiment for him.
There was a short pause in which Dean was pretty sure Sam was rolling his eyes again. “Have fun pining,” his brother then said.
The scent of freshly-made waffles and hot maple syrup did the trick and lured Jimmy out of the bedroom just as Dean was finishing setting the table.
Dean, for his part, kept holding on and then tentatively rubbed his cheek against Cas’, asking for permission to scent him in return. All rational thought had left Cas the moment he had received that text message, so he granted permission by tilting his head ever so slightly for Dean to find the best spot to scent.
And then it was happening; Dean was actually leaning in—slowly, carefully—to nuzzle against Cas’ neck.
Cas had stood with his back to a mirror, looking over his shoulder to gauge how bad it was on multiple occasions and… it looked pretty bad. Michael had made sure other alphas knew exactly whose property he was. Plus, alphas paid more if they were allowed to leave marks.
“Dean,” he begged, not knowing what he was begging for, but knowing that he could trust Dean to provide it.
“Who needs a doctor when I have my own cuddlibus right here?” Dean raised his eyebrows for emphasis, but Cas never got his attempts at flirting with him and this time was no different.
While Cas would give anything for the little pup growing inside of him, Dean’s scent was something he couldn’t provide. Well, he
This time, though, he couldn’t bear to watch it unfold. Maybe it was because now, he knew how it felt and no longer had to wonder what it was like. The tingling sensation when he looked into your eyes. Flushed cheeks and racing hearts. The electric spark when he touched you. That unexplainable tug, that magnetic pull drawing you towards him.
Now that the adrenaline from going to heaven, fighting angels, and being revived wore off, Dean could let himself relax and scent back and—oh God, but Cas smelled delicious! Utterly fuckable! No longer just in
His hands were shaking like a leaf and it was only when he looked at them and saw a drop of water land on the back of his hand that he realized he was sobbing uncontrollably.
Cas loved squirming around underneath Dean just to feel the hardness swell even more. As a response, he’d feel a funny flutter in his stomach.
The sheet vanished and the next thing he knew, Dean was pulling his ass cheeks apart and pushing a finger right into his ass!
“And you get me something of his to scent,” he added as a condition because the alpha’s scent was what made slicking so much easier.
Cas opened his eyes and looked right into Dean’s. He licked over his lips again. Then he said, “Okay,” and pushed his shirt up to expose his breasts so that Dean could see those pert nipples standing at attention already.
Dean opened his eyes wide, slammed the laptop shut and almost fell out of bed as he scrambled to use the bedspread to cover himself all at the same time.
Nothing mattered but having his alpha right here with him, who accepted him and all the baggage that came with him.
He dropped his bag of groceries when the alphas were in attacking distance, and took off as fast as he could. Trying to outrun an alpha was a bad idea, but his flight instinct had kicked in without consulting his brain first.
Dean hadn’t exaggerated. Castiel could feel the bunker’s magic from a mile away, and the second they entered it, he knew they would be safe here.
He should quit. Playing rut companion certainly hadn’t been planned as part of his midlife crisis. He’d finish this call and then he’d quit.
“Sex on the floor,” Dean clarified, which was just stupid. Castiel had tried to get to his bed, after all.
His scent deprivation had never seen it coming, but if he had ever suffered from it, Cas had definitely finished it off.
“Don’t you have better things to do than hang out in my ‘boring shop’?” Cas said when he saw Dean approach, but Gabe could be tenacious when he sensed that there was a possibility to embarrass Cas.
to bite him and mark him against his will, just because they had been in the mood to take an omega who was drugged out of his mind and in heat.
Finally, Dean’s knot went down and once he slipped free, he still continued to stroke Cas lovingly because all of his instincts told him to love the crap out of this omega. Of course, by now he’d gotten used to those instincts, having had them for a while.
Cas had liked getting his belly rubbed when Dean had done it before at the cabin, so he shrugged, faux-casual, and said, “Well, if the book says we should…”
. “Uhm… your arm,” he decided because that was always a good place to start. “The inside of your left arm,” he specified.
Anna took one look at him and the blanket in his arms, and yelled over her shoulder, “Cuddle pile!” before pulling him into a hug.
Twenty minutes gave him time enough to prep himself and change the sheets. They had to be reeking of heat. Where the day before, he had dreaded the encounter, he now had a weird flutter in his chest that almost felt like he was
Cas shook his head, unable to suppress a smile. He could read between the lines. That was clearly Gabe’s way of telling him to go for it. “You’re ridiculous,” he stated nevertheless.
Tonight was one of those nights where he really needed to release some of that pent up sexual energy. That’s why he chose a video and let it play on his laptop while he was sitting in bed, touching his dick and imagining that he was the alpha in the video about to fuck that omega until he couldn’t take the pleasure anymore and looked up at him with golden eyes.
“You’re so awesome,” Dean told him as he pulled out of him with a little plop and flopped down beside him for some additional cuddles.
But of course, Cas didn’t understand what the big deal was, and just tilted his head and blinked at him before pointing out, “I was paying you a compliment.”
. I didn’t fall in love with you because you’re tough and strong and can fight my battles for me. I fell in love with you because you’re kind and compassionate and caring.”
The weirdest part? Even though he was in heat, it didn’t hurt. Maybe that was because Dean’s scent was too distracting.
“Uhm… Kinda hard to explain. Basically, you want nothing more than to stay with the person you’re scent bonded to all day, kiss them and scent them. And when you do, there’s this tug behind your navel, you know, the one you get when you ride a roller coaster. It’s like you’re high on their scent, and just being in their presence makes you all happy and shit.”
In the end, he went for an old classic because he knew Dean appreciated those. He made Anna trip and fall right into Dean’s arms in the middle of the cereal aisle so that the alpha had to steady her, which made her apologize with an embarrassed laugh. Dean told her not to worry about it, turning on that charming smile of his that always used to make Castiel’s heart do funny things inside his chest.
“Oh my God. Tell me that you’re the alpha from MEAT and not just a new neighbor who moved in next door?—Wait, am I allowed to scent you? There was no box for ‘scenting.’ Sorry, I’ve never used an Alpha Service before. You
Dean texted back his congratulations. He was truly happy for Cas. And also kind of for himself because
‘Want’ was a dangerous word because yes, he wanted that more than anything. It wasn’t something he could just admit to Dean, though.
The way Dean had covered Cas’ body with his own should have made him feel boxed in and claustrophobic. Instead, it had made him feel cared for and—he could at least admit it to himself—it had been arousing. Lying trapped under an alpha’s strong body should make him panic, not get turned on.
“Making progress,” Dean informed Benny, and then, to show him that there was no weird almost-scenting going on in his gym, no sir, he added, “Wanna join?”
Only then did Dean realize that he was sporting some serious morning wood. He hoped Jimmy didn’t think he had been coming on to him—which was so not what he’d been doing.
This had to be what having a mate would feel like. Cas laid his head on Dean’s chest, and listened to his heartbeat, surrounded by the scent of his alpha. In response, Dean put his arm around him and squeezed his shoulder.
But it seemed like he needed to get new good luck charms because Dean looked at him intently and said, “Why did you drink it?”
until Castiel’s omega was a satisfied mess and they had lost count of how many times each of them had won. Neither of them brought up that little fact, though. It hardly seemed important.
First things first. All Cas had to do was sneak out of bed, change his underpants and pajama bottoms, get something to cover the scent and pour it all over the wet patch on the mattress. That was as good a plan as any.
He could just imagine Cas’ beautiful eyes blinking up at him… God, he would look so pretty taking his cock!
, but it had been fun last time, so why not? So, Dean pulled out, manhandled Cas onto his belly and pushed back into his hole from behind so that he could fuck into his undoubtedly sore ass a couple more times before knotting him.
Cuddlibi sure seemed to know how to make an alpha go insane with lust. Maybe that was what Cas was feeding on right now.
And what his instincts wanted him to do was get frisky with Cas. His dick had been hard and ready to fuck for some time now.
Maybe he was the kind of human Gabriel’s approach worked better with after all, even though Castiel would never admit that in Gabe’s presence.
Okay, so Dean might have offered to share, but when he had said that, he hadn’t expected Cas to blatantly flaunt his… his nakedness in front of him!
Oral sex had been on Cas’ list of no goes because Dean’s sperm was supposed to be deposited in his ass alone. But that didn’t mean that
And before Castiel knew what was happening, Dean ducked down again and gave his scent gland a gentle lick, too. A completely normal way to say ‘Congratulations, I’m happy for you!’—among boyfriends and mates, that was. Apparently, among paramedics as well.
But he did manage to remove the spider without killing it, so Cas thanked him with a chaste kiss. Of course, he regretted it as soon as it was over and Dean was looking at him all wide-eyed, so he quickly mumbled, “Thanks,” and averted his eyes.
There was a lot Dean would be willing to do to see Cas smile like that more often. On top of that, the scent of happy pregnant omega was overwhelming.
So, he kept his platonic kisses to safe places, watching Cas’ eyelids flutter, which made him kiss both of his eyelids, too, unable to resist.
Oh God, this son of bitch knew just how to get to Dean. If this beta was trying to barter with him, Dean would be sure to get a good deal out of it, though.
“Of course, I am looking forward to getting my sense of smell back. But these last few months, I realized that scenting isn’t just about the ability to smell someone else. I like the way you’re so close to me, and the way you put your arm around me. I like feeling the vibrations of your voice and listening to your stories. And I really,
(Dean had done some research and humans were able to touch cuddlibi without consequences. It was a full-blown cuddle session that would leave you a bit drowsy. And even then it was nothing a short nap wouldn’t cure.)
“I know. I’m not feeling like it.” He was still just as restless as he’d been ever since the last alpha fight. If this wasn’t what his alpha had been craving—then what the
Since they were still naked in bed, Cas half on top of Dean, the scenting led to Cas undulating against the alpha, which led to him rubbing his dick against Dean’s, and somehow, they both came together one last time, even though it would do no good since Cas wasn’t even in heat anymore.
So, they stopped for the night and continued their little ‘getting to know each other’ game the next evening.
When he had the omega right where he wanted him—snuggled tightly against him and lazily scenting along Dean’s throat in return—he let his hand drift up to his neck, softly fondling the tender skin there. That elicited a shudder from Cas, which made Dean hide a smile. Half of the fun of snuggling and scenting with Cas was in how responsive the omega was.
Since reasoning with Uriel wasn’t working, Castiel tried to wiggle out of the straps, but to no avail. He would usually just use his powers, but this room seemed to be blocking them.
That made the top of the list of sentences you weren’t supposed to say to a patient. But of course, Cas hadn’t been just any patient for quite some time now. And he probably wouldn’t even be his patient for much longer anyway.
,” Cas mumbled. Gabe would so get an earful later. Telling Dean to have sex with him? What was he thinking?!
“Lit candle and pine needles,” Dean countered because even without scenting Cas, those elements were right there on the surface.
He shivered and tried to forget about the scent of alpha near his rut, but then someone was at his door and Cas froze in fear.
Dean’s alpha rejoiced at that. This was it! He had this alpha in a vulnerable position and they both knew who was the stronger alpha here!
Their lips were almost touching now, and Dean’s eyes dipped down to Cas’ chapped lips while his tongue involuntarily darted out to wet his own.
“What percentage is it at?” Dean asked, hoping for a low number so that they’d have time to figure this out.
Dean was just stepping out of the shower and Jimmy, back to him, was toweling off, when he caught a glimpse of the alpha’s back.
It was sort of a relief when Bart came back, but by that time, it had gotten late and this time, they didn’t take no for an answer when they told Dean to go back to his own house for the night.
Then it was time for his cock to make its way inside that hole. He rocked against Cas a few times until the head of his cock caught on his rim and he slid home, all the while maintaining eye contact because this wasn’t just any old fuck.
To be fair, it hadn’t just been that he had watched his omega take an alpha’s dick—it had been that it was
Dean could still pretend, though. Falling asleep with Cas cuddled up against him gave him almost everything he could wish for. And soon enough, he would get to sleep with him while he was in heat. It would be very easy to pretend then that it was more than it was.
Jimmy’s eyes found his and bore into him in the way that was typical for him. Since he didn’t say anything and his expression gave nothing away, Dean added, “I mean, I get how that would give you nightmares.”
All of that meant that he had trouble following the conversation because he was too busy pretending not to be in love with Dean. Pretending nothing had happened between them. Pretending he didn’t have butterflies in his stomach and couldn’t wait to be alone with him so that they could make out some more.
“Uh-huh.” Dean stepped closer still. “Where’d I bite you?” His breath ghosted over the back of his neck, making its tiny hairs stand on end and sending goosebumps all the way down his arms. “Here?” He placed a small kiss on the nape of Castiel’s neck, hardly close enough to his mating gland.
“We will have the results in half an hour,” he declared and packed his things. Then, he left together with Zachariah.
“Didn’t think that you were.” Dean took a sip of his coffee and added, “Kinda thinking it now, though.”
The next moment, Castiel heard his voice inside his head, praying to him so that only Castiel could hear, “My body’s back home. Quick, go heal me!”
“What about free will?” Dean went on. “I don’t want to settle down with someone just because some winged fortune teller decided they are my ‘perfect mate.’”
“How often do human grooming buddies groom each other?” Castiel asked, wondering if maybe grooming each other once a day was normal for humans.
Instead, Castiel did what he should have done to begin with: concentrate on his charges and going back to his hands-off approach that had worked for him for thousands of years.
When their eyes had met, the tingling their eye contact usually provoked had gone to his belly and then lower, triggering another bout of heat. He’d thought that he’d had the worst of it behind him, but watching Dean watching him while he was in the throes of passion was too much.
him?! Dean stopped short, keeping perfectly still, letting the victorious grin slowly slip from his face.
Dean’s nose twitched and he smirked down at Castiel. He knew very well when Castiel’s heat was due. Not for another month. “Fucked you into heat, huh? That’s gotta get me some extra points.”
Okay, that might come across as a bit suggestive, which was why he added, “Fully clothed,” which somehow made it worse since now he had drawn attention to the image of them cuddling
Huh. He never would have taken Jimmy for the type. Weren’t enhancers used to attract omegas? Or maybe other alphas in Jimmy’s case. Either way, Dean never would have guessed that Jimmy was self-conscious about his scent.
submit… That’s where it was at. The moment he pushed his cock into their tight assholes and then proceeded to show them what it felt like to be mounted by an alpha was what had Dean come back to the club every time he was in the vicinity. And sometimes, if it’d been too long, he just got into Baby and drove the multiple-hour drive there just because.
Zachariah took his time staring Castiel down, which should have been the first red flag, but Castiel had never once seen Zachariah smile, so his closed-off expression wasn’t exactly indicative of bad news.
Caring, selfless, and loving was a whole other side he had kept hidden and only showed in the presence of his brother and his friends. It was in the way he looked at Sam with pride in his eyes while boasting about his brother’s work at some important firm. Or in the way he affectionately nudged Charlie while claiming that she was like the annoying little sister he had never wanted.
Transitioning back to the real world after this amazing week, during which Cas had been able to pretend that he meant as much to Dean as Dean did to him, wasn’t easy.
Cas could take that as ‘I don’t mind staying’ or ‘I don’t mind the scent.’ Both worked just fine, even if it was an understatement either way.
Since he now regularly took Cas with him when he went to bars, there weren’t really many opportunities for him to hook up either. The longer he went without bedding an omega, the more sexually frustrated he felt, which meant more solo missions for him while perusing his favorite porn site.
Great. Now Dean wanted to know details about the vision that Castiel had masturbated to multiple times since his last visit. The one that still made him lick his lips involuntarily. (He wasn’t proud of it, but the vision had been the best porn movie and it certainly hadn’t been easy to ignore.)
He quickly finished with, “So, anyway, your scent helped. Thank you,” and hung up before he could do something stupid like ask Dean to come over.
They just lay like that for a while, the silence comfortable in a way that was only possible with someone you trusted and knew well.
“Bee,” Cas repeated a bit louder. “It’s a pet name,” he then explained. And after another beat of silence, “I’m showing affection.”
Yet, here he was, throat dry, ass drenching wet, staring at the screen where Impala was pushing him into the bushes a few steps away from the path, getting rid of his clothes with one click.
That was as close to the word ‘jealous’ as he was willing to get, and it totally counted as a secret.
Dean’s alpha was finally sexually satisfied. After days of sexual frustration that could have as easily been
“Sex?” he would ask with a raised eyebrow, ignoring the choking sounds coming from Sam, who was sitting at the dinner table with them.
Cas was a strange dude. What kind of an alpha was popping a knot while taking it up the ass? Sure, Dean had known Cas got aroused when they were having their alpha… thing. Hard to ignore the heady, musky scent that drove Dean’s alpha nuts with the need to
Dean bit out and he sounded strained. It was obvious he should have called for an omega a lot earlier than on the third day of his rut. Most alphas called on the first day and typical answers to the question ranged from ‘just started’ to maybe ‘four hours.’
Of course, there was no way Dean would allow Castiel to lean up and steal a kiss—even though there was a strange, almost soft look in his eyes that made Castiel’s heart thump erratically in his chest.
Right. Because Dean—sexiest alpha alive—was going to see his imperfect body. What had Gabe gotten him into?!
Dean didn’t feel like correcting him and just shushed him instead because the moan was actually not as sexy as omega sex noises were supposed to be and maybe they just shouldn’t be talking.
At least, the angel had promised Dean he’d be back soon to tell him if he had gotten into trouble because they had ignored some heavenly rule where angels and humans weren’t supposed to get it on with each other.
Dean had tried flirting with Bees before, but he usually didn’t get much back. He’d be lucky to get an ‘I don’t understand that reference.’ Mostly, Bees didn’t even notice that there
And then Castiel had to watch Dean leave yet again, this time aware that it wasn’t just some stranger, but his actual
this to be the end, though. He’d have to go back to his own odorless place in his odorless world, and the thought alone was enough to make his gut wrench.
“Oh. Okay. Well, good,” Dean finally said. That’s the best apology he could come up with on such short notice, and Cas would just have to make do with it. “So. What’s new?” he then asked.
Then he lowered his voice and spoke, his mouth inches from Cas’ ear, “I’m gonna ride you so hard you won’t be able to even
When Dean was still just standing in front of the bed, Cas looked up at him and asked, “Do you still want to do this?”
Yes! There Cas went, baring his neck so prettily. Obviously, his instincts in the presence of the alpha who had fathered his pup were working just fine.
“Yeah?” Dean smiled at him and his hand found its way to his stomach, resting there over his shirt, still asking permission.
Like a complete idiot, he blurted out, “I’m actually engaged to be mated.” After a beat of silence, he added, “Sir,” as if that could save him now.
Guided by the feeling of being watched, Castiel looked past Dean’s shoulder, and there, in the distance, illuminated by the moon, was a woman.
No way was he letting Cas call for another alpha for his next heat. If anyone got to knot him again, it would be Dean!
He glanced over at Cas who looked unnaturally pale, and that’s when he realized why the omega had wanted Dean to pull over.
This is the first timestamp, just an excuse for some fluff. I’m all over the place because of the show coming to an end (and how it’s coming to an end), so I had to try and calm down with some happiness for our boys. I hope you like it and I’d love to hear from you if you did. 💖
“You know, do your thing.” He twirled his fingers to illustrate his point. “Hug me to sleep or whatever.”
Cas felt his face heat up at the comment about their ‘nest.’ Yes, he might have gone a bit far yesterday when preparing the bed for Dean’s return. It really did seem more like a nest.
His pre-heat coiled low in his belly when he watched Impala’s long prick being pushed all the way into his omega’s ass.
Great, Dean’s dick seemed to really like bossy Cas. Seriously—how did the omega miss how turned on Dean was?!
“Yeah, you’re doing a bang-up job with that.” Dean rolled his eyes and then just left without saying goodbye.
“In my defense, you’re really cute, and you were all enthusiastic about… helping me out, so I kind of kept coming back for more.”
And then there was the bite mark on his mating gland. It had felt so right in the heat of the moment, but now that he was back home, it started hurting.
“Only because it gave me some really good pointers on how to make you feel good.” Trying to make sense of everything Cas had just revealed, he added, “Hang on. So when you say you need me ‘like that’—do you mean like
He was still sitting on the bed when Castiel was fully dressed. Now it was his turn to figure out how inter-species grooming worked. Sitting down next to Dean, he decided to just try his best. Without waiting for instructions, he simply reached out and let his fingers run through Dean’s hair in an attempt to smooth it. He couldn’t possibly go through it one hair at a time, could he? Did he have to look for broken ones?
Finally, Balthazar told him to stay calm, that he’d send someone to pick up the cell phone (even in its broken state) so that they could take a look at it and try to find out what they could, and that he’d send a security detail just in case.
Now, all of a sudden, Dean had agreed to go along with his impulsive lie about having an alpha, giving him back hope that everything would work out after all. But of course, the mating bite was what Zachariah wanted to see—proof that Castiel wasn’t just lying to get the promotion.
The Magical Creature Alliance of Kansas only came together here once every five years. It had only been two since their last assembly. There had never been an unscheduled meeting before.
“Yes, I will. Talk to you later,” Cas said to whomever was on the other side of the line, and then he hung up and motioned Dean inside, explaining, “My brother. Just in case you’re thinking about robbing me or killing me—he has contacts in the police department and he’ll call the cops if I don’t call him back in an hour.”
Stumbling over that last word wasn’t his smoothest move, but he got through all of that rather casually given the circumstances.
Making sure he kept him pinned underneath him, Dean leaned down to nose along his neck, accepting his surrender.
Inevitably, naked cuddling led to stirring feelings of arousal. There was one part of Cas’ body he hadn’t touched yet, and his alpha really wanted to.
In order to prove it, he initiated a round of scenting, trying to pick up on the different components of Dean’s scent again because they were simply impossible to name, all he could do was scent.
Since Dean’s logic was so much better than anything an eight-year-old cuddlibus could come up with, Cas frowned deep in thought.
The press of the swollen knot against his rim reminded him that knotting was likely not part of the deal since Gabe probably hadn’t paid for it.
Dean fucked him through his orgasm and then picked up the pace to chase his own. His heavy balls were slapping against the omega’s ass with each thrust, and then Dean pushed in deep for the last time and emptied his seed into Cas.
“Okay,” he heard himself say, even though his mind kept repeating ‘bad idea, bad idea, bad idea.’ At least, the chances of this ending in a jail cell for the night were slim.
Cas tried his best not to panic and instead settled on anger. This was all Gabe’s fault! Cas had let news about their new arrangement slip and then Gabe had said that Dean was trying to get into his pants and that Cas better buckle up because he was going to get fucked. That’s where the confusing dream had come from for sure!
Dean had never cuddled with an alpha before. Not with one he wasn’t related to in any case, and even then not since he was a pup. Well, it wasn’t like he and Jimmy were cuddling right now either. It was more of a holding each other thing. But it still felt less weird than he would have imagined holding an alpha would feel.
That got him a frustrated sigh. “Dean—this is actually not a good time for me. Does this look right to you?” He frowned down at the shirt cuffs, which looked impeccable.
“I told you. I had trouble falling asleep.” That might originally have been a little white lie, but since karma was a bitch, it had turned into the truth. A quick glance at his alarm clock told him that he’d only had about three hours of sleep. Way too early to have a pissed off omega in his room.
Another rule he had a hard time remembering was that he wasn’t allowed to go back there too often. Maybe once every few weeks. So why the hell was he itching with the need to get into Baby and make the drive back even though he’d just returned home?!
While fucking into him, Dean also liked to hold hands and intertwine their fingers, which was intimate in a way that made his omega feel wanted, and not just in a sexual way, especially when Dean stopped moving and brought his hand up to his mouth to kiss his knuckles gently.
“Yeah, she had amnesia after the plane crash…” And off Dean went, explaining how the characters were related.
Alphas, on the other hand, didn’t have so many rules about sex and commitment. Better yet: Only an alpha could really understand what it was like to go through rut. The solution was so simple Dean couldn’t believe he hadn’t thought of it sooner.
Then there was a very tentative tickling, as if Cas was just taking a small sip. Even so, it still felt more intense somehow. Remembering that he was supposed to cuddle Cas more actively, too, he resumed stroking his hip and then moved his hand up his side.
If praising his cuddle technique made Cas smell like that, Dean would make sure to tell him how good it felt as often as possible.
A dry run with Cas still out of heat might be a good idea. Maybe he could pass it off as just another form of preparation for Cas’ heat.
Cas’ tongue had retreated, and since Dean didn’t want him to think what he was doing was unwelcome, he encouraged the omega by baring his own neck a bit.
Dean should totally ask him if anything was off-limits. Like… was dick cuddling allowed, too? That would be an awkward question, though, which was why Dean simply tried not to move too much.
His spacious office that seemed bigger than Castiel’s entire apartment was just one more tactic to let people know how important Zachariah was.
“Oh, come on! I already came inside you. Believe me—my dick is satiated and doesn’t have anything to say right now.”
Oh. Well, it was very hard to turn that off, too. His alpha instincts were difficult to suppress. Of course, an alpha in love would try some courting techniques on the omega of his affection.
?” He’d never heard of cuddlibi feeding off anything other than cuddles. But then again, he had recently found out that he didn’t know all that much about his best friend’s species. Apart from what Sam had told him. In any case, he was still finding out new aspects all the time.
Letting Dean’s alpha do what his instincts were telling him to do was great. Cas wasn’t sure he was worth all of this trouble, but Dean kept reassuring him that he
The other alpha had clearly won the fight, so there was nothing left for him to do but acknowledge it by baring his neck in surrender. It was mostly an omega instinct, but alphas tended to do it while in the presence of a stronger alpha, and Castiel had seen some of the alphas in the porn videos do it shortly before they got mounted and fucked.
The reason for those uncharacteristic cravings was obvious: He was in the presence of an omega in heat. His alpha had never been allowed to breed an omega before—that was the whole reason he was here. So naturally, he would have all these instincts bubbling up. Naturally, Cas’ scent would make his stomach do somersaults.
Luckily, months of getting to know each other and sleeping together (platonically) paid off and he instinctively knew what to do to settle the alpha. Now that he didn’t need to suppress his omega instincts in Dean’s presence anymore, things were so much easier. His thoughts didn’t need to circle around suppressing his omega side for fear that Dean might find out.
Laughter could be heard over the officer’s cell phone. Cas would have to get his brother back for this later. Gabe had known that Dean was harmless. It had been
They successfully finished two challenges, which revealed a hidden path that would lead them to the lost kingdom of Easthallow.
It took him a second to figure out that this was the real Cas, lying there beside him, kissing back in his sleep. And it wasn’t just some kind of chaste sleep kiss, either. Nope. Dean’s tongue was in Cas’ mouth, tasting the sweetness within and sweeping intimately over Cas’ tongue, taking no prisoners.
, which he had felt in Dean’s presence before, but this was different. He was right where he belonged... in his alpha's arms.
But it wasn’t like he knew a lot of alphas. Dean was Sam’s brother and his name had probably come to mind because he’d heard a lot of stories about him from Sam, who was really proud of his alpha big brother.
The alpha mumbled something about alphas and omegas sometimes losing control shortly after an omega’s heat. Castiel didn’t quite understand, but he wasn’t about to ask. Not when he felt all these things he’d never felt before.
Now that they had been introduced, Dean would accompany his smile and wave with a “Heya Cas.” and Cas tried really hard not to blush when he replied with “Hello, Dean.”
They would be in the middle of cuddling after another round of vigorous fucking, Dean’s dick still inside of him, and suddenly, Dean would just start fucking him again until his asshole got flooded with yet another load.
Cas was a bit sad… that he didn’t get to ogle the hot alpha anymore. Okay, and maybe also a bit because he missed the friendly smile that reached Dean’s eyes since he always seemed happy to see Cas.
Since Cas was the only cuddlibus who had ever fed on him, he had assumed this nice tingly sensation was just what it felt like when a cuddlibus fed off the cuddles you gave them. Turned out that it didn’t necessarily have to feel that way. There was almost an uncomfortable pull once Inias started feeding and Dean clamped his mouth shut and hoped for it to pass.
He sunk down against the closed door, trying to do the breathing exercises his therapist had taught him.
That had clearly been the scent of an omega! He hadn’t seen anyone come in or out of the house, but it wasn’t like he had kept tabs on it. Maybe someone had come by while he had been out last night. Maybe he had still been there, in Jimmy’s bedroom, when Jimmy and Dean had had their… weird thing. Somehow, that thought didn’t sit all too well with Dean.
Castiel doubted that—chances were the percentage of people who had ever done that was very low and mostly consisted of criminals—but just then, the person on the other side of the door started knocking, and a voice was yelling, “Dean? You there?”
“Hey, Cas, slow down,” Dean’s amused voice penetrated his mind, and when had Dean’s hands found their way to his hips? Must have been when Castiel had crowded him.
Raphael was standing in front of him, arms crossed, his wings with specks of pink just as Rachel had described, which probably meant that he wasn’t in the best mood to begin with.
“Yes. Can you… insert your finger first again?” Castiel asked as he shrugged out of his bathrobe, the only thing he was wearing.
He finally fought the restlessness by getting all the blankets he could find and arranging them on his couch in a way he knew Jimmy would find difficult to stay awake on.
Since they weren’t watching a movie this time, Dean just started talking about his day, which was relaxing in its own way, and soon, he got Cas to talk about what had happened in his life these last few days, too.
After, he didn’t really know what to do or say. Their characters were knotted together on the bed, Dean’s virtual spunk locked inside Bees’ asshole—what did you say in a situation like that?
There was a trace of scent blockers left, but most of it had been washed off by the cold sweats, leaving Dean yearning to scent Cas, too, to make sure the omega really was okay.
Castiel had been sure that the phone call would put an end to… whatever it was they had been doing. Somehow, it had seemed to go far beyond faking a mating bite.
“I still have most of my books here,” Sam replied in the meantime, but Castiel didn’t pay him any mind, too busy holding eye contact with that alpha. “Castiel, this is my brother Dean,” Sam’s voice registered somewhere in the back of his mind.
Once Castiel was the one who had the other alpha pinned, he made sure that Dean wouldn’t be able to get free.
The omega wolf stepped up to his wolf and… Dean leaned closer to the screen. Was Bees licking at his muzzle?
Cas was sitting there, gobsmacked for a second. Of course he’d had sex dreams before, after the event, but those had been nightmares. Dreams of running, being caught, being unable to stop some faceless alphas from pushing into him and hurting him. He had never had a dream where he had
He shouldn’t have been so curious. If he hadn’t been so curious, he would still have the fantasy that his feelings were reciprocated.
Maybe Dean hadn’t known what he had said yes to. He probably hadn’t thought about the fact that he’d have to bite at Castiel’s mating gland until it looked like an alpha had… well, mated him.
It started out as a harmless way of messing with him. Drawing a dick on his face was an awesome prank (not a childish one like Sam later told him), and totally worth it when Sam saw Cas the next morning and did a double take. Plus, Cas squinting at him in that Cas-like way was always a bonus.
“Thank you,” Castiel yelled after her belatedly, hoping that she knew her help was greatly appreciated.
He was just changing into his pajamas when Cas walked right into his room, already in his PJs, and slipped into his bed as if he belonged there. (He totally did, but that was beside the point.)
He took a left turn and there—vanishing around the corner was someone. It had to be him! The mystery omega!
Then there was the night of multiple rematches when Dean spent the whole night in Castiel’s bed because as soon as his knot went down, he just fucked him again and again and
Soon, they didn’t just go for walks, but did other things, too. There was the time they went to a drive-in movie because Cas hadn’t understood some reference and Dean deemed it necessary to educate him about DeLoreans. According to Dean, he had to make sure Cas knew all of these things so that he could teach their pup about ‘the important things in life.’
“You not taking her up on the implicit offer?” Benny asked after she had wandered over under some pretense yet again before hurrying back to her own group of friends.
charge! If he had given up his life in an ill-advised attempt to save him, Castiel would be responsible for his untimely death.
If Castiel had to feel like this every night (or even just some nights), he might just admit to Zachariah what he had done and quit his job just so that he could get away from all of this.
Dean revised his theory about Cas not being compatible with lots of alphas. Maybe some boyfriend had been rough with him during his rut.
Alphas wanted to fuck and knot omegas—everyone knew that, and Cas had learned that the hard way. The fact that Cas had slept next to an alpha more than once and hadn’t woken up in the middle of the night with a knot in his ass was only because Dean was such a sweet alpha. Cas trusted him not to give in to any breeding instincts.
Whenever Cas was low on grace, he would resort to human ways of recharging—which meant that he would keep falling asleep.
It took some convincing, but eventually, the 9-1-1 operator believed him when he said that there was no emergency, he was wide awake, thank you very much, and Cas had just overreacted.
The omega mentioned an alpha who had come on a bit strong at the bookstore a few days earlier, and even though Cas downplayed the whole thing, Dean immediately connected the dots to Cas’ restlessness that night they had fallen asleep together.
He wished Cas had ticked the box for ‘rim job’ because at this moment, he’d give anything to taste that delicious-smelling slick.
Wait—what was that scent? He leaned back, getting ready to scent for it, but he was distracted when Jimmy fell right out of bed.
That… made sense actually. Was it really so different to fucking an omega? Sure, there’d be no slick, and the alpha might pop a knot. But there was always synthetic slick they could use and the knot… well… that would need some getting used to, but he had one himself, so he’d be able to figure out what to do with it.
After having talked about what he had gone through, Cas was very clearly exhausted, leaning heavily on Dean, his nose occasionally bumping against Dean’s scent gland.
Don’t get him wrong. It wasn’t like Dean was into alphas. He just liked the power rush of making them submit to him. And the ultimate submission was when they were taking his cock.
Castiel turned around to see what he was looking at, but there was nothing there. “Are you alright?” he asked Dean when he turned back to him.
In response, Dean simply used the hand between his shoulder blades to push him down with gentle pressure, which sent a thrilling wave of anticipation through his body.
As per their no small talk rule, they were getting to know each other on a deeper level than it would normally be possible for two strangers who had just met. Dean quickly learned that he had a nerdy little omega on his hands here. But that was okay since he got to tease Cas mercilessly. Pull his pigtails, as it were.
1. He could tell Zachariah on Monday that they had broken off the mating. In that case, it would be pretty obvious that he had made up the whole ‘engaged to be mated’ thing in the first place. Additionally, he would lose the job opportunity to Michael.
Probably the latter since Dean’s attempts at fishing for information had turned up nothing but a, “Oh, that’s just Balthazar.”
Dean should drive home and catch some z’s himself. Getting an omega through his pregnancy heat was no less tiring. Awesome—sure, but he had come so many times that he definitely had to recharge, too.
Dean was reading in ‘How to Take Care of Your Pregnant Mate,’ but he didn’t want to read it to Cas, which made him wonder what was in there.
Dean’s alpha really liked seeing the omega all sleep ruffled and vulnerable. Add to that the alluring scent and he couldn’t help but nudge Cas onto his back.
Right in the middle of the kiss, he could feel the prickling of an oncoming vision, no doubt facilitated by the magical night. He pulled away from Dean and braced himself, expecting to feel pain and fear, once again living through the attack by the hunter.
is Gabe?!” Dean asked, who probably hadn’t liked the idea of parading around in his PJs in front of a stranger and had used the same tactic to cover himself.
“No. In reality. They locked me into a room I can’t fly out of. I think someone is approaching that room.”
