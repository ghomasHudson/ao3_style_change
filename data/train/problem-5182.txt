“I really hope you know what you are getting yourself into with that kid” he froze, fury knew. The bastard was pulling his leg.
He kept telling himself that he was only looking out for a student after an episode of panic attack.
“Good, come on, give him to me" steve let go and watched as she pulled Tony effortlessly towards her , his head lolling forward oblivious to the exchange around him.
“Stane?” she asked her voice like steel and Tony quickly pulled the blanket back up and Steve’s hand wrapped around him again.
“no honey, not yet. Is something hurting?” bruce was still running his hands over tony looking for something.
“Stop thaat" Tony whined curling into a tighter mass. Steve sighed and pulled the covers off before shaking Tony harder and called out louder
He trailed his kisses lower along Tony’s chest and down towards his navel stopping there to give tony time to adjust to the feeling . Tony shuddered under him and his breathing was picking up.
The next time Tony woke , it was much more calm. They had reduced his pain medication and he woke groggy and tired
Somehow the mood through the class was rather gloomy , maybe it was the rain or it could possibly be because Steve had not felt so low in a while .
steve resisted the urge to kiss him. It was the last thing Tony needed ,besides having Tony sitting on his lap was not particularly helping either, but at the moment all Steve wanted was to make Tony feel safe. Safe enough that Tony would never hesitate to come to him for help again.
Tony was on his knees, his hands clawing at his shirt collar. His hair was matted to his forehead, Steve could see the sweat glistening there as he gasped for breath unaware of their presence. Steve had a very good idea as to what was happening but he had to make sure first.
Tony’s trembling didn’t stop even after a few moments and Steve gravely wondered if he had made a terrible mistake. Tony had asked if they could do something more intimate just two days back and Steve did know he was still far too young. But seeing Tony dressed in uniform had taken him by surprise and Steve had been holding back for so long now.
Clint smiled brightly at that knowing that phil was saying he was in on whatever they decide to do and having Phil help them was in itself like a victory.
“let’s leave that in okay.” Tony shook his head no “off" he said, though it sounded muffled through the mask and then his attention immediately  switched over to the mask as he pulled it down and steve let him as he took the cup of water nat handed over with a small straw.
“who was he steve? Just tell me.” He asked his eyes boring into Steve’s until Steve was forced to give up the answer. He internally chuckled his emotions awry at the moment, thinking about how Bucky always stared him down from doing rebellious things during pre-serum times.
Steve reached for Tony, holding onto his upper arm “that reaction said otherwise. What’s going on?” Steve asked in his no nonsense tone.
“Shh hey honey you are alright Tony.” He said as he used the other hand to pull his gown down to cover him up just in time for natasha to burst into the room.
"Language" steve said as he licked his lips tasting the ice cream that Tony had eaten. He knew Tony was nervous and worried, there was also the fact that he absolutely did not want to talk to Steve about what was happening with him for some reason.
The day was over a lot faster than any of them were ready for it to be. Tony was alternating between being Brave and being scared, even if the latter was only for Steve’s sake.
“Steve, what is the fascination you have for this new kid, I don’t get it.” She said breathily as she pulled on Steve’s shoulder to get him to spin around so they can change sides.
“I have your paper with me, think it will help if we go over it together?” he asked hoping tony would let him help but he shook his head quickly and said a short
Obadiah had said no one had ever laid a hand on the boy . He had blatantly lied about it, now Steve was wondering why he had kept the boy away from his past. There had to be an ulterior motive. He took deep breaths as he walked back and forth along the corridor outside his finger worrying at the back of his neck.
”does he know you are at school?” Because if he didn’t, Steve knew where exactly the blame would fall but tony nodded and Steve was relieved.
“Am sorry" he mumbled and Steve almost reeled back at the apology not knowing what it was for. He wrapped his arms around the teen, one arm going to the nape of his neck and curling there.
"TONY!" that's not part of the lyrics to black sabbath? I turned around to see banner waving his arm for me to come over to his desk. "J,kill the music"
When Steve avoided her gaze she reached over and laid a palm on his forearm and waiting until he looked up.
Rhodey and another classmate was literally holding Tony still between them as he squirmed trying to get out of their grip , tears brimming as he shouted at then to let him go.
Then there was tony, he came sauntering in along with fury, discussing something about the clean up crew. It looked like he had head home taken a shower ,cleaned up nicely . He looked his usual charming self under the suit he was wearing which covered most of him obstructing any view of injuries he may have sustained. He looked a little pale, his breathing raspy , which was highly suggestive of a chest infection he was already developing from his dive into the ocean. It had been about five hours since his fall , but with Tony’s compromised lungs he was always at a greater risk of developing lung infections.
“Tony, I want to ask you something, come here” he said pulling his closer and Steve layed down on his side ,propped up on his elbow, facing Tony and brushed his fingers through his hair before reaching into the neck of his shirt and pulled the dog tags out. He played with them in his fingers for a few seconds before he saw Tony’s curiosity.
“Sorry, my schedule changed. I have a class after yours” he gave him an apologetic look and Tony looked momentarily sad but shrugged it off quickly enough.
Natasha came in with ice chips and held it out for Steve to take as she silently settled down beside them lost in her own thoughts. Tony surprisingly didn’t fuss about the IV and did mostly okay as long as Steve was there next to him . He fell asleep quickly after steve force fed the ice chips to him.  Natasha broke the few minutes of silence they had sat in after watching Tony sleep
“I had somethings on my mind” he said nonchalantly and Tony frowned at him and just as Tony opened his mouth to ask him about it Steve kissed him senseless, he had missed this and Steve was not missing the opportunity.
“are you sure you want to take up the responsibility of caring for twenty teenagers Mr.Rogers?”the principal said raising his eyebrows skeptical as ever.
“I have to be home in an hour! Steeeeve put me down!” he gave up his grip on Steve confident that Steve wouldn’t drop him and used his hands instead to push on Steve’s head away from tickling him.
“You won’t even touch yourself now?”  but tony didn’t smile he looked sadder in a way and that did not seem right for someone who just had an orgasm.
“ there’s a reason it’s called a hall pass Mr.Rogers.” Steve had heard from the other professors just how much of a smart mouth Tony can be but this was the first actual non class based conversation Steve had had with the boy and was finally starting to understand what they meant by that.
“that’s not how school works though” Tony pursed his lips at Steve , and pulled out a neatly folded slip
Steve knocked on the door, before opening it. Tony was still sitting at the edge of the bed , but he had changed into the scrubs that were much too large for him. He looked adorable to say the least as he battled with exhaustion his eyes closing every few seconds.
Tony looked up at Steve, their eyes locking as Tony gave a wavering smile “I will see you tomorrow in school then?” Steve shook his head no and Tony looked taken aback, his breaths turning into soft gasps
“I know what I am doing" he said and the used one hand to tuck Tony’s face against his neck and spoke quietly to him
He pulled his gown up careful to keep him covered below the waist so he could see the expanse of Tony’s chest. His coffee brown nipples were perked up from the cold of the room and Steve bent down to drop a kiss to the center ,just above his heart.
"Did you take something?" He asked trying to stay calm as Clint turned back to ask the agents to give them some space, leave the room to them.
Within a minute all three of us had our blood flowing into the bags settled by our beds. It was a surprise however that mine got filled well before either Clint or tasha's bag could get filled even halfway. They were both undoubtedly upset, clint sulking like a ten year old. The nurse cleaned up my arm after pulling out the needle and taped a small iron man Band-Aid on it . I smirked lifting my arm up to show it to tony, but he had his chin resting on his hands looking down.
“I want you to stay here till I come back. Can you do that?” Steve said to him and waited for him to respond but all he got was a nod so Steve waved to the agent who had initially called him out of his meeting and beckoned him over.
“Yeah but a doctor can't magically heal a cut either.” he retaliated and Steve just wanted to hide from this boy rather than try to answer his questions.
And Steve knew, he knew it was the wrong thing to say , he knew he should have instead said ‘no Tony, this is not like that, besides I am eight years older and you are sixteen, a child’
He caught a cab, telling the agent to wait for Tony and drive them wherever they wanted to go and then back to the tower. He hadn’t realized he had told the cabbie to go to his apartment instead of the tower until he was already standing in front of it.
“what’s going on?” steve startled at the new voice behind him and natasha walked closer looking more close to sleep than awake. But who was to blame her,  it was still three am.
“That doesn’t make me feel any better either. Can’t they send someone else? Why cant Clint or tasha go?”
“I am going to touch your hand , is that okay?” he asked but made no movement to do so until Tony shakily nodded his head. He reached over and gently grasped one of Tony’s wrist and tugged it free from its hold on his collar and placed it on Steve’s own chest
He nodded, “he was injured a few days back, he refused to tell me how it happened. Only mentioned that it happened outside of school and that he didn’t want stane to know. Is he being targeted by someone? Do you have eyes on him?” Fury shook his head lightly
“I know I am disgustingly dirty but I am not moving” he said tightening his hold on Steve and he could practically hear the pout in his voice and he chuckled
This week's mission for the team had come down to one thing- to make sure tony took his daily shots of iron, and to make sure he was eating and sleeping right. The blood test had come back positive for iron deficiency anemia. Bruce had explained that his hemoglobin was on borderline to severe. Tony was still fatigued but he was definitely doing better after Bruce gave him some oral iron supplements. He was yet to forgive us for the blood draw. Tony was a tricky patient, but together they managed. The genius brain of his had only one thing missing, he didn't know how to take care of himself. Bruce had initially suggested that tony take a few days off from his work. But everyone knew tony had the most work amongst the team .Between balancing his company and working with fury, developing weapons for the team he had little to no time for himself.
“is everything alright? Did she say why she wanted to talk to me?” Steve asked him now a little concerned considering the fact that pepper did not have his number, how was she contacting him?
“They wont let me take it out, tell them I don’t need it" he slurred. His voice had slightly higher pitch to it and Steve wondered just how much morphine they had pumped into him .
"He didn't hurt me, he was getting handy so I just left and then called pepper and rhodey. It's not their fault -I ..I made them come-"
He felt Tony stiffen against him and then say a small “sorry" to natasha while she continued to glare at him but Steve had a distinct feeling that he was missing a piece of conversation between the two of them.
“Why is he here?” steve asked as he felt a chill run through him when he remembered how Tony had said he had wanted obie with him because he was scared. He knew Tony hadn’t been thinking right then, he was bring sedated and he was terrified. But he hadn’t allowed himself to think what it meant that Tony would still feel safe if obie was with him. Had they made a terrible mistake and forced Tony into a situation he was not okay with?
“I got you sweetheart, lay down for me okay?” He used one hand to push Tony back so he was laying down and Steve made sure to explain every part of what he was doing. Tony’s hands were shaking and he looked more and more uncomfortable by the second.
“Because you decided to take a stroll in the middle of the night" he said searching Tony’s face for any indication of remembrance.
“What if natasha hadn’t come in at the time she did?” Steve frowned , he hadn’t really thought about it . Mostly he was only worried about Tony.  To be honest he found rather impressive that after what tony just went through he was still worried about Steve. He didn't know how top describe the feeling , the flashbacks don’t just feel like memories but like he was physically reliving it. He shuddered at the thought of having to explain what it feels like to someone else especially Tony-
“How did you manage to buy drinks? Did they not ask for an id?” they both looked at each considering if they should tell him or nnot and rhodey finally conceded
“What?” he asked his fingers restless around the screwdriver he was holding. Natasha gently placed all the items on the counter and came up next to Steve who had Tony trapped in his arms.
“Only a little, but I’ll be really gentle" he said and Tony gave him a bewildered look “you are going to do it?”
“When was the last time you slept honey?” she asked and he made a distressed sound and natasha didn’t push him. Instead she turned to Steve to tell him him to lay down with him. And withing seconds he had Tony in his arms and his face facing away from both of them ,tucked into Steve’s chest.
I sighed to myself as I tried to think of any other signs of sickness his boyfriend had showed in the past few days.
“Steve" Tony all but whimpered his feet kicking the air helplessly. He knew Bucky was somehow enhanced just like him, so he knew one wrong move on his part and he could snap Tony’s neck in a second.
“and what exactly is this thing that the nurse can’t help you out with?” Steve was suddenly curious and not just about the injury but about why Tony didn’t want to go to the school nurse.
“oh, okay, just give me a sec" tony said easing off his jacket before handing it out for me to take.  I folded it neatly and placed it on the chair he was sitting on before heading over to thor who was already eating away all the snacks. “you know thor, the snacks are for after donating  blood" I said grabbing some juice and biscuits that had jam between them.
But his heart sped up when the door to his bedroom creaked open and Tony,  a very disheveled , grease stained Tony peeked his head inside trying to adjust to the darkness inside. He apparently didn’t notice Steve was awake and he carefully tip toed his way across the room and pulled on the covers by Steve’s feet before climbing in. Steve held back his laughter as much as possible as he felt his hair tickle the skin on his chest as Tony carefully snuggled his way up until his head emerged from the other side and Steve quickly closed his eyes pretending to be asleep.
“Okay, I am going to the men’s room , finish your pizza and I’ll drop you home" he said emptying his pockets and placing his phone and wallet on the table next to Tony so he could pay the waiter with it when Steve was gone.
Steve was out of the door within seconds,  but he forced himself to stay rooted outside the nurses office
“I said I was sorry ,don’t be sad” he said trying to make Steve smile using his fingers. Steve caught his hand and gave his fingers a kiss.
his mind was reeling , there was still some pressure on his chest and it took him a few moments to realize that someone was laying against his chest. He moved a shaky hand to wipe his face off the water and then finally turned to the voice that pulled him out of the nightmare.
“He’s small, and tender and I am afraid I’ll hurt him. He doesn’t know or understand the damage I could do to him” she wasn’t surprised to hear his answer
I dropped the wrench I was holding in my hand and walked over to him,to see what he wanted me to look at. Banner and me occasionally asked each other for insight on our projects we are working on ,it has sort of become a ritual.
He took his bike keys heading out of the tower , school was an extra twenty minute ride but he didn’t mind. Once he got to school , he was disappointed that Tony wasn’t in his morning class. He was distracted throughout the whole class unable to focus.
tony for his part, scrambled backwards on the bed until he hit the mound of pillows. “I am fine thank you” he said, looking panicked.
“it will activate only when it senses severe distress. Until then no matter what scanner they use , they will not detect it. Distress includes if you are severely hurt or drastic changes in body temperature.”
“Okay” Steve conceded easily enough because really when has he ever been able to deny Tony anything.
“First thing, we need to make sure Tony is as comfortable as possible. I think we all know his phobia about hospitals and this is not a minor procedure, he is definitely terrified. Steve you need to talk to him before we get him to the medical bay. Make sure he knows what he is in for. Clint and thor, you guys go down there , try and spruce up the place to seem as less hospital like as possible. Maybe add another few beds, so we can all be there.”
“That they need to monitor his urine output and that we are to feed him as much fluids as he will drink once he’s  awake and some pudding if he is up to it" he said settling down on a chair after he had pulled it close enough to the bed.
"All better now!" I declared as I gave them an explanation "the shower was too hot,my blood pressure probably dropped"
“Right now, he needs you more than you think" was all she said before she left him standing there with nothing but a brush of her fingers against his arm.
“Its not been a very good birthday" he said softly and Steve pulled his face into his chest holding him close and rubbing his back.
He stood there for a few minutes collecting his thoughts in the comforting sound of Tony and nat talking in the background.
“I am sorry, I know the timing of everything is bad but we will figure it out” he said and when Tony desperately clung to him it pulled at Steve’s heart strings.
“Good?” he asked as he raised himself up higher onto the bed closer to Tony’s face and then pulled them both upright.
“ I don’t want to stay here, I can let you take care of me at the tower.” He tried to sound adamant but it came out more as a request. Steve rolled his eyes, atleast he had won part of the battle.
“Captain, Stane is here. And he does not look happy" Steve nodded taking a deep breath , he released his hold on Tony and carefully slipped out from under him.
“Yes , I..” he fixed his glasses “it’s not everyday I get to see my student like this" he said smiling shyly and Tony was looking a little embarrassed himself as he pursed his lips and avoided looking at bruce at all.
Steve hadn’t been sleeping well off late and not that it did much to him, the serum and all, but he still felt off balance.
He had an arc reactor lodged in his chest and had very stubbornly refused to let anyone near him after that. He is afraid , steve knows that. But Steve wants to be there to help him through it, but ever since Tony found out that, that thing is keeping him alive, he has been very distant from anyone and everyone. Including steve. It hurt , but steve understands that Tony is going through something major and if this is how Tony needs to deal with its he will let him be for the time being.
“I know I am always talking about doing lewd things but Steve I don’t-" he started saying not able to take his eyes off the bottle of lube.
“this is non negotiable, we need to be really careful here on Steve.” He said not caring as he stripped tony of the sheets and his fingers and carefully peeled off the bandages.
He also picked up the hospital gown along with the other supplies and carried them over to the table he had rolled over next to Tony’s bed. Bruce had already told him that would have to monitor his urine output because he would be on some pretty heavy medication including angiotensin receptor blockers which would affect his kidney function as well.
“I need another shirt" he said pulling on the fabric holding it away from his body. Steve groaned when he realized there was pasta sauce in his hair as well.
Steve was getting worried that he was going to pass out “sweetheart” Tony’s eyes snapped up as he melted against Steve “can I put this on you?” He didn’t move away this time and Steve took it as an affirmative and held the mask over his mouth and nose.
Steve missed him, he missed holding him and caring for him, missed that little smile he gives only around Steve when he was incredibly shy and he missed being wanted by Tony.
“Tony, we cant push this off any further” he sighed getting exasperated. “I know, I will tell you I promise. Wait for me today after school?” he asked getting up from his chair leaning over to kiss Steve again.
It didn't help that I was in a crappy mood all day, I was frustrated because I didn't know how to handle the situation with Tony. He has zero self worth and that was the problem. His burns from the battle are extensive, they needed attention. And Jarvis had said to check his blood counts again which only worried me even more. I don't even know if I am mad at Tony or at myself for not being there when it happened. But I know I am currently exhausted from being mad. Tony needs me right now and here I was sulking all day. Deciding to go make it up to him, I headed down to the lab knowing that Tony had intended to work on his armour all day. I stopped at the glass walls, watching Tony from behind wearing the boots of his Armour. He was moving rigidly like he was too sore to be moving at all. He stopped abruptly looking up and directly at me, smiled and waving for me to come in, immediately masking the pain. Jarvis must have told him I was waiting at the door.
And surprisingly enough , Tony was the last to leave class today . He casually walked towards Steve’s table once everyone had left, his bag strapped over one shoulder as he pulled out a yellow slip handing it over to Steve who took it from him curiously.
“you are with child?!” he exclaimed bearing all his large white asgardian  teeth and Clint and natasha burst out laughing , Clint almost doubling over his seat. Thor looked at then confused while Steve glared at natasha.
“Uhm you said it will hurt a lot that day and how am I supposed to know if that’s okay or not?” valid question, steve smiled at his genius
“Hey, he’s going to be okay. You just wait and see before you know it his smart mouth is going to be running through the school hallways again" steve told her and while she appreciated Steve’s effort it only made her cry harder and natasha glared at him before going to comfort her.
“I have a really good metabolism I guess” he said with as much confidence he could muster and tony just stared at him through narrow eyes for two whole seconds before muttering a “huh” and looking away.
“okay, now" he said sighing and carding his fingers through Tony’s hair “are you feeling alright? Tell me honestly please” he asked him and Tony leaned forward against Steve’s chest cuddling.
“wait, you knew my dad?” Tony was on in his knees, suddenly excited and Steve sighed rubbing his palm over his weary face.
“I am sorry, whatever I said I was clearly not thinking straight and I will apologize to Bruce I promise -" steve squeezed his arms a little to gett him to stop
“He is a minor!” steve has always know Bruce to be a patient man but this scared him a little . To see bruce get angry so quickly ,and he was angry at Steve.
“Yeah, that’s it buck. Let him go , he’s just a kid. It’s just s kid.” He coaxed and suddenly Buckys eyes lost that glazed look and immediately let go of Tony who Steve saw out of his peripheral vision fall to ground unable to brace himself , still wheezing.
“Don’t put pressure on his chest, he is still on morphine, he won't realize even if it is hurting him" steve nodded as he carefully lifted his lover into his arms but instead of carrying him like he normally does , steve picked him up bridal style and held him close .
“Tony” he said waiting for him to look up but when he decidedly ignored him Steve took a deep breath before taking a step closer and leaning on the desk behind him
He took a deep breath, shook his head to clear his mind “okay pepper you did a good thing by telling me” he said trying to calm her down as he followed her quick steps to the men’s room. His heart dropped ,however, when his eyes fell on the brunette.
Because what they were suggesting was just absurd. He would know if his sweetheart had something lodged in his chest, because there would be a surgical scar or something. Also, tony would have told him. Not to mention,  tony was a healthy kid, save for the off late exhaustion which was obviously attributed to stress.
“Tony? Wake up sweetheart.” He whispered but Tony was dead to the world. So Steve shook him a little and called out a little more loudly . He did not expect Tony to react so violently to be woken up though, because one second Tony is sleeping and next second his eyes are wide open panic marring his facial features as he flailed his arms almost tripping over his own chair. Steve looped an arm around his back catching him in time.
“Just because stane thinks that, it doesn’t mean we agree with him. Howard entrusted shield with his technology and he definitely would have entrusted his son to you.” Steve felt like an asshole now remembering how he had spent his afternoon thinking about his hands on the tony.
“No tony, go to the nurse, you are a big boy. You can handle it” he said and tony frowned at him shaking his head. Steve groaned internally before relenting and Tony’s face lit up.
“Just for tonight and we can talk all you want tomorrow okay?” he told his kissing the bare skin st the junction of his neck and shoulder. Tony shuddered at the feeling and Steve warned him up by running his palms along his arms.
This was going to be hard to tackle. What if tony was really sick? I moved my hands to his arc reactor just to reassure myself that he is okay.
He waited till everyone had taken their seats and scanned the class to re familiarize with all the faces.
”you knew , you both knew.” He accused the two assassins who promptly pursed their lips “tell me Natasha , is this why you told me this would be dangerous?”
"steeeeeve" he whined reaching out to grab for me but I was already out of reach. I turned my back to him and started walking towards the stairs and I told him without turning back "its movie night, if you want to claim any popcorn you better be quick"
Looking up I saw the rest of the team smiling at Tony as he tried to button his shirt up again ,I slapped his hand away “leave that be, you don’t need a tie to donate blood.” A couple of laughter went around the room. Thor was now handing tony a pack of pop tarts , I only just realized that he must have been done as well, didn’t realize it in the chaos.
“bruce found this last night and was going through it ,simply out interest when we connected the dots.”
He was not entirely sure if that was a good idea right now but he gently tugged on Tony’s arms until he came with and leaned forward against Steve.
“You are really alive" Tony mumbled softly and Steve held his breath as he let Tony process the information on his own.
“That’s just fucking great!” He screamed and Steve winced at the tone even though he felt he deserved it. Before Steve could say anything Tony continued his words clear cut and anger filled
“Hmm” Steve nodded, “ I will make sure you get to meet them soon” he tightened his grip as Tony slowly started listed against his chest supporting most of his weight.
“My friends!” came the thunderous voice as thor walked in to take the seat beside Steve. He just plopped down and slung a leg over the side turning towards the rest of them , he had no regard for his safety or maybe it was because he  could fly.
He reached there in record time and found pepper and rhodey sitting at a booth but no Tony. Walking over to them and they both sprung to their feet looking at him with all the guilt in the world.
“Cap, how you still sleeping man?” either there was a massive earthquake or someone was shaking him.
Steve held his breath unconsciously as he felt him stir at the light touch but sighed as nimble fingers latched onto his shirt.
“That is harassment and good luck talking to my parents since they are dead!” There was brief second where after he said it where tony looked smug at Steve’s shocked and guilty expression before he turned and left the restroom slamming the door behind him.
It took a moment for Steve to realise that tony was talking about the laceration on his cheek which was mostly healed , a small thin line of red remained.
“Couple of reasons, we need to talk about your housing situation and then figure out what to do about stane.”
“how?” Tony asked as they prodded at the bruises on his torso , Steve was distracted and didn’t catch the meaning of what he asked as his eyes lingered on the finger shaped bruises on either side of Tony’s torso where Steve had grabbed him before the blast.
It took some time for Steve to confirm why Tony behaved that way. He never seeks any physical attention and neither does he initiate it unless prompted to.
“you are up!” steve exclaimed mostly from surprise and she shrugged pulling her hair in a bun “kid is a furnace" she said and Steve frowned going over to see and he found that Tony’s cheeks were indeed flushed and he placed the back of his palm against his forehead to actually find it a bit warm.
He ended up sighing every few minutes, his anticipation building up as he waited for the kids to move on to the next exhibit, Suddenly wondering if they were all in on it and decided to trick him by spending more time than necessary on the same floor. He berated himself for even going that far in thinking and quickly joined the students to keep himself distracted if not engaged.
“Hey, what’s the body count?” he rasped as he sat up and Clint handed him a water bottle. He drank greedily and placed the bottle down.
There had been many days when Steve had come to class with bruises and cuts post battle but no one had ever noticed that they were gone just as fast as they appeared.
“It’s fine, there is nothing she can do for it” he clipped through gritted teeth. Steve would think this kid would be more great full to Steve , after all steve was sitting on the bathroom floor with him to help him.
He knew he couldn’t go all the way, atleast not the first time and Steve didn’t actually have to, halfway in and he hit his prostrate and Tony was whimpering in pleasure rather than pain. He held still waiting for Tony to calm down and start tracking again
“sure, why do you ask?” ofcourse he was not okay. He had just found out that his now seventeen year old lover had a bad heart and that there was something lodged in his chest to keep him alive. What’s worse? Tony was not letting him do any kind of coddling.
Bruce slammed his phone shut and turned to face Steve eyes wide and this was a reaction steve could handle
“hey" he called out softly and Tony finally pushed his way in shuffling to the foot of Steve’s bed. Steve would have laughed, if his mind was not still feeling fuzzy and shadowed.
“I was hungry, and then when I came to find something to eat and then I saw this poor thing struggling and I had to help you know ?”
“Okay" he shuddered a little as Steve trailed his hand down his neck , his back and finally settled just at the bottom of his spine.
“I have some errands to run, you guys go ahead.” steve nodded “tony, remember what I said , don’t stay up all night again okay?” steve frowned at this , had tony not been sleeping?
“Steve get over it, you had a momentary lapse . Happens to everyone” Clint said breaking his train of thought handing over some fries that Steve found too greasy for his liking.
“Thanks" he said as he reached for the other one and Steve braced for the reaction “you got me underwear? Steve what the hell" he said pulling them out his nose twitching as he held up the pink ones.
"take off your suit Tony" oh yes, the suit, this was going to be painful. I walked over to the station as jarvis said "sir you may want take a mild analgesic first" Bruce turned to me alarmed.
Steve doesn’t remember anything else, only remembers how Tony was mumbling about being scared and despite everything wanting obie with him here.
I was so hungry by the time I reached the tower, the traffic had been grueling. The cleaning process for the day had been exhausting in every which way. It was estimated to be wound up by tomorrow evening. Which Meant working without a break for hours together. Tony had sent out his entire stark clean up crew. But looking at the scene, even that didn't seem enough.
Tony on the other hand was resisting every step of the way as Steve pulled him along with his fingers wrapped around his wrist.
steve carefully pried his fingers out of Tony’s, “I am going to show you okay?” He said pulling his shirt over his head and Tony’s jaw dropped , there was a resounding pop as his lips parted. He reached his hand out hesitantly letting it hover over Steve’s chest, the angry scar running across it.
“He fell asleep as soon as the good nurse helped clean him up but he hasn’t woken since but they told me it was nothing to worry about and that I was never to bring him food again.” The last part was said with a hint of sadness and Steve felt the pity himself. Thor loved sharing his love for midgardian food.
The elevator dinged loudly, an indication from Jarvis that I had been too lost in thought to get out of the elevator on my floor .I grumbled some more (I was doing that a lot more than usual today) before exiting the elevator only to trip over an excited dummy who had apparently been trying to get my attention since the elevator opened. I patted the robot on his arm and walked around him to my desk with the blueprints for the mark 50.
“Do you want to watch a movie?” Steve asked still holding onto a squirming Tony with no effort at all.
It was stated clearly that the company was to be handed over to Anthony Edward stark when he turns twenty one and until then for the company to be run under the management of obadiah stane. Ofcourse that made sense, stane was Howard’s business partner after all.
“Tony , “ he started softly “when you came to my apartment the day after I came from my mission and saw Bucky , what was your first thought?” and Tony gave him a confused look
Tony for his part shook his head and Steve moved to put him down on the bed but Tony refused to let go.
Fury looked like he wanted to discipline a child who had spoken out of turn but he bit his tongue and instead said “I expect no information to be held back today"
"not in front of the lady" Tony pouted. I sighed this was going to take longer than they thought. "yes, because you are a shy kind of person" Natasha said already reaching for the hem of his shirt. She was all business, she knew there was no point beating around the bush. He swatted at her hand and removed the shirt himself.
Tony was standing near the bed, swaying actually ,as he waved his arms around frantically trying to keep the two doctors around him away. It seemed like they were trying to force an oxygen mask on him and Steve could see why. He was hyperventilating, and looked terrified as they finally got him to sit down.
“Yup, I just..” he trailed of sighing “I..” Tony was struggling to say whatever it is he wanted to and Steve turned his head towards tony his lips brushing against Tony’s cheeks and ears
He heard the key in the lock on his front door and was immediately on his feet to intercept Bucky this time , but he remembered Bucky was still in the shower. He didn’t know if he should be worried about that, it had already been forty minutes since he first went in.
“Uhm, I hope this will do I couldn’t find anything else in your size” Tony said walking in. He had already changed his hair still wet and hanging limp across his forehead. He dropped a pair of sweatpants and a matching shirt which was brand new and as Steve opened the packaging he saw the bright logo of SI.
“Since the tape of you dying, Tony was an absolute wreck and Bruce was here with him the whole time” right, he had missed a lot In those three weeks.
“don’t go anywhere!” tony said leaving the room as everyone rolled there eyes. But the moment he left the concern on everyone’s face was back full blast.
“Cap,” he felt fingers tapping on his cheek and he wanted to slap it away but realized he couldn’t mo over his hands.
“I know you cant forgive me, but I want you to know that I am very grateful for this.” Bucky started and Steve head snapped up at the all too familiar tone of goodbye.
“We should do an x ray" bruce said finally and before Steve could reply Tony came sauntering in ,hair dripping wet all over his shirt and face and sat down next to Steve reaching for the coffee.
“It will burn” he said lips pursing and Steve chuckled as he patted his hand and continued to help him up.
“stop, hey nobody is making you do anything. If what you really want is to go home then I will drop you home.” He iterated so Tony would understand that he wasn’t going to hold him hostage here like he was apparently thinking.
“He was wearing a uniform, complete with a tie” Steve said looking her in the eyes knowing he is now currently a deep shade of crimson daring her to comment.
He was halfway through his second plate of something before he realized that Tony had actually not touched anything and was just smiling at him watching him eat. Suddenly self conscious he placed the plate back down and frowned at him
Tony looked absolutely miserable sitting in the corner, his face was flushed and he looked a lot younger than his age. He shuffled a little trying to get comfortable before giving up and slumping back again against the wall.
They had spoken about protection detail for Tony and what would happen when they got back and how they actually couldn’t just take tony away from stane because he was his legal guardian. So until they had proof of the aabuse and report it to child services or Tony legally turns eighteen they couldn’t do much. And Steve knew very well that Tony would deny any claims of abuse in front of other parties that did not include the avengers.
"If I don't hear a proper excuse and apology from the both of you then detention will be the best thing you are facing today" he stated firmly. Steve could be very scary if he intended to and he knew that. It's sort of what kept his students in line and the fact that he hardly behaved strict with them is what made him popular among the students. He would like to keep it that way though, but these kinds of incidents seemed to bring out the worst in him.
“Wow" he said in awe as he ran his fingers across Steve’s pectorals and then to his surprise he leaned forward and kissed the skin just below his right  nipple.
“she will be alright" he said and Steve felt awful for not consoling him , but really  it was kind of his fault.
Bruce nodded, looking around to make sure no one was listening and then leaned in a little closer to Steve “a few months ago before tony joined this school, a bunch of suits showed up. Called themselves SHIELD.” Steve stopped chewing. “They told us that the boy was alive and was kept under witness protection because his parents did not die in an accident but was actually a murder.”
“You good?” she asked and he nodded once taking in a shuddering breath as he tried not to jostle Tony too much.
Tony looked like he had been slapped , his eyes darkened and he shrunk a little lower in his seat. Steve sighed , he really thought he had done a decent job of letting him down easy.
“Tony sit down, food is coming. Clint and thor are on food duty" he told him firmly and Tony sat down giving her an apologetic look.
Steve dropped a kiss to his forehead before carefully easing out to change into the clothes  natasha had brought them all from the tower this morning. His hand was mostly healed, just a little sore.
“It was his idea actually,  he said he thinks he can improve on it, and that means he would need constant access to it.” Now that did make a lot of sense but Steve felt uncomfortable at the idea of Tony toying with the thing keeping him alive. Not that he was not capable,  but Steve still saw him as the much younger boyfriend who cried because he had a catheter inserted.
clint sighed and reached under the table producing another cake , a smaller one but still just as calorific as the first. Thors fingers sparkled with electricity at the excitement and everyone laughed as Clint explained that he had actually anticipated this.
“Why don’t you take a nap and then we can take a walk" he asked as brushed his fingers through Tony’s hair ,but Tony was not having it.
“You are so perfect for me sweetheart” he whispered in his ear and Tony shuddered his fingers digging deep into Steve’s forearms like he was hanging on for dear life.
“yeah, why?” Tony said eyes flitting across the open space as if expecting something to happen fingers still playing with his tie. Steve fought a smile as he reached up slowly stilled his fingers and Tony frowned at him “what is it?” he asked slightly irritated before the heel of his right leg started tapping rhythmically on the floor. If someone saw Tony now they would assume he was on some sort of drugs and Steve chuckled lightly at the thought . He continued frowning at that and Steve tugged on his wrist and pulled him in the direction of his classroom.
“ it’s steve, can you open your eyes for me? I have some water for you to drink, just a little bit , come on baby” Tony shuffled a little and Steve held him still , keeping him from falling .
“Phil, please I need you to make this go away" steve said pushing the envelope back to him and apparently seeing widow cuddling with Tony was all he needed to know that this was serious, he pocketed the envelope and continued sipping his coffee.
“Steve I know you , you always do the right thing no matter what the consequences . Why are you hesitating?” bucky asked
“okay, so we will start with Ms.Romanoff and Mr.Barton and then do yours captain.” We nodded our agreements.
It didn’t take much for Tony to come undone whole body shuddering a moan ripping past his lips in Steve’s arms spilling warm and sticky over his fingers and the perfect ‘o' that formed in Tony’s lips as he as dropped his head forward onto Steve’s chest was enough to get him over the edge too.
“I didn’t tell him anything,  I swear! You have to believe me-" he said with a shaky voice but Steve cut him off quickly before he could work himself up
Steve spoke softly to him , keeping his mind engaged as they waited for the few seconds it took for two nurses to come in. They got to work quickly, and Tony was put on an oxygen mask instead.
He knew natasha does not joke about these things. He knows bruce would never make fun of somebody's medical plight but Steve couldn’t do anything but laugh.
Tony shuffled around a little while before giving up and finally opening his eyes. He found steve immediately and Steve didn’t dare open his mouth unsure of exactly what Tony needed him to say.
Steve shuffled back again pulling with him so Tony was sitting on Steve’s outstretched thighs straddling him hands playing with Steve’s shirt. By now Tony was looking more and more child like , his uniform rumpled and tie hanging loose around his neck.
“Yes,” he confirmed without a moment of hesitation but the weight of the question of the status of his relationship with Bucky hung in the air heavy and tense.
“Tony” Steve tried again as he followed Tony out the bedroom and watched him scramble around to get bag and shoes.
“I have a couple of friends willing to help me out , I think it will be good for the kids. History is as it is a dry subject. They need a change sir.”
“How?” he himself had not known for a long while , bisexuality was not condoned in the forties but once he got a fresh start, steve didn’t plan to let that window slide. His family now, clint , natasha , thor and a few others had been so good to him that he often forgot how hard it was in the forties.
He knew exactly why it had come out so hurtful, steve had been angry at Tony at how he had pushed him away in the moment where steve needed to know that his lover was okay , but the worry he had had that Tony was going to spiral to a bad place after so much had been dumped on him had kept his anger at bay .
He had eaten a good dinner and woken up at sharp five am to do his morning run. He was feeling good and levelheaded as he swiped his card at the base watching the door slide open for the millionth time.
Steve stayed back in the gym , a few rounds with a punching bag would do him some good to at least let him take out his anger with stane and his best friend.  Three broken punching bags later, Steve left feeling calmer. That night Steve slept with his phone right by his pillow, hoping to not receive any kind of distress call from Tony. It terrified him to think that even after knowing he had let Tony go back there. Sleep came with difficulty,  and it was not restful whatsoever.
“Good morning" steve said with the best smile he could muster and Tony smiled back tentatively as he tried to stretch.
But he understood the next moment why she had done it when Tony took a step closer towards Steve and the weight on his shoulders lifted.
He sighed , letting the frustration of not getting any straight answers wash over him and brushed his hands on his pants ready to get up “I will call your parents to come pick you u-“ Steve didn’t finish his sentence before he was startled at the sudden movement as tony sprung up from the wall so quickly that Steve actually sat back down in astonishment.
“No you don’t!” He argued and Steve was surprised at the tenacity in his voice “I don’t want to be treated like a child in this relationship.  I am not stupid and I don’t need you to coddle me and protect me.”
“sweetheart” he said softly and Tony frowned at him a pout starting to form and before it could reach it’s full potential Steve captured those lips with his own.
“I got you sweetheart, you just need to take a deep breath. Do it with me , do you feel my heart?” he said gently pushing Tony’s head against his chest feeling Tony shake in his arms.
He had really wanted to see tony first , but natasha was right, he needed to rely on the team to help each other and trust them.
“That’s all right, we will always come for him. Right buddy? Now let’s see that little injury of yours”
“The nurse” Steve barked out a laugh, as tony looked at him incredulously at his obviously inappropriate reaction.
“is it getting better?” Tony only frowned at him , as he pulled on Steve’s hand until it was out of his pants and held it there
“Can we take it out now? It burns” he whispered his lips to Steve’s ear and Steve glanced at bruce who mouthed ‘no' and Steve shook his head and kissed him softly on his cheek and turned him carefully so he was turned towards Steve.
“look at that baby, you are really responsive to me huh?” and Tony whimpered bucking his hips forward towards Steve’s hand that was still barely touching.
“Well, this is the worst of it. It stopped bleeding but it is really sore though” Steve said pointing to a long scar along the side of torso that had been the source of “blood everywhere” as Tony had put it.
“Please?” he asked softly and Steve wanted to concede to that tone but the curiosity and worry won over. He pushed tony a little further back on the table and firmly held him there with his fingers wrapped around his upper arms.
“why?” tony asked , betrayal and anger combined with his labored breathing came out more as a gasp. Steve approached tony slowly his hands in front of him , and carefully took hold of Tony’s hand waiting to see of tony would allow it. Once he was certain tony wouldn’t push him away he wrapped his hands around the genius pulling him to his chest.
“Who is scary?” For a second Steve was sure tony was going to whine at all the questions Steve was asking ,but he seemed to realise it himself and stood up straighter
He knew she didn’t just mean his distractions causing injuries, there was a tone to her voice he couldn’t place. He nodded nevertheless catching his breath.
The whole team was sat down in the common room, only tony was missing .I had promised not to hover if he ate his entire breakfast this morning. That was the only push he needed to polish his plate clean. He had finished eating with little fuss and had gone down to his lab immediately after and was yet to emerge. Bruce had made sure to eat lunch with him today in the lab.
“Steve calm down, we are on it" clint said as he sat down face in palms. Nat gave him a little nudge with her good foot and he looked up
“I have been stressed lately and  running helps me. I thought you would join me this once" at this Tony’s suspicion reduced and he instead said “I have my own shoes, you didn’t have to buy me these” and this time Steve was the one doing the snorting
“Why are we out here?” he asked his face changing expressions every few seconds and Steve thought he looked drugged, well actually he was.
“But you just got here” he said looking mildly irritated because peggy had pulled the thin blanket up over his chest trying to settle him.
“I am fine , good actually. Needed the sleep more than I thought.” He received nods from them before he realized he didn’t even know what time it was
As soon as he pulled the door closed Tony all but sagged and whimpered and Steve lifted him and seated him on the examination bed.
“I didn’t know kissing can be this good" he said and the innocence went straight to Steve’s dick. He growled slowly, gently pushing Tony off his lap and smoothing his clothes. This wasn’t the place or time he told himself,  besides Tony is still a minor.
"This is not going to be possible on this budget, you will have to give us more wiggle room on this one." Steve argued.
"You okay?" I asked him quiet enough only for him to hear. But am sure both the super spy's heard as well because I noticed them turn their heads ever so slightly towards tony to see his response.
“when are you leaving?” he asked instead and Steve assumed he was skipping whatever class he had now.
Steve knew what natasha was doing, easing the atmosphere. She knew him well enough to have figured out that something was very wrong just with Steve’s tone on the phone and would have been all over it asking questions if not for Tony tucked into Steve’s arms.
“No, I realized only when I saw you walking him to your car yesterday. And tony doesn’t seem like the person to kiss and tell so I think your secret is safe with me.” Steve smiled gratefully at him albeit it was a sheepish one. The bell rang and Steve headed to class to find Tony sitting in between pepper and rhodey in the last row. He looked up as I shuffled in clearing my throat to alert the students. He pursed his lips and looked back down opening his book as the others did.
“I have one too, so that we can stay connected wherever you are" steve didn’t have the time to  appreciate so he gave him a quick kiss and left him standing on the bed ad he toyed with the other device in his hands.
“Its like an infinite power source, but limited to a small outlet. So it will fit into the reactor well.” Tony said and he knew there was a lot more to it and that Tony was dumbing it down for him.
One moving to my hair and brushing it back, I arched into it feeling heavenly. A couple more pulled me into a supine position on the couch. Finally!
“I don’t want the shot” Tony said immediately eyeing the syringe and Steve laughed whole heartedly as tension lifted off his shoulders knowing that Tony was finally willing to talk.
“Can you get someone to draw some blood? Let’s figure out what this is.” Clint said to Phil knowing he will take care of things on that end.
“Give me one good reason why and I don’t want to hear about there being nothing anyone can do for it” he said glaring at the kid, his tone had turned authoritative and it made tony stiffen in his seat.
“I do remember things , just not why or whom" bucky explained to Bruce who also had seemed very interested in his metal arm.
“I should be asking you that" he retorted but Tony glared at him and Steve figured Tony was not upto any more questions at the moment
He hadn’t even realized how fast time was flying since he was back, realized it was because he finally had some time to relax and do things at his pace.
“I am okay though, the armor took a hit , a minor leak in the chest plate. Jarvis is working on the fix right now.” He said after steve gave him a knowing look that he was expecting an actual answer. He reached up placing the back of his hand on Tony’s forehead before brushing it against his cheek feeling for a fever. His face was still pale and slightly flushed but his temperature felt normal . Tony sighed leaning into the contact closing his eyes before catching Steve’s hand on his cheek and holding it there.
Well that was something Steve hadn’t expected , he hadn’t even realized after a while that Tony hadn’t bought it up and because he had already decided that they would talk about it tomorrow and tonight was going to be just him and Tony.  But he hadn’t told tony any of this, so he wondered why Tony hadn’t brought it up earlier.
“our job, mine Clint and tasha’s are dangerous Tony. There is always one innocent person who gets hurt and we don’t want that person to be you.”
“There would be a scar, something to indicate major heart surgery.” He argued and then remembered Natasha’s fingers brushing over Tony’s chest like she was looking for something “that’s what you were looking for just now, and you did see that there was nothing there"
“You know Mr Rogers, It would be really helpful if you shared with the class as to how you gained super healing abilities” Steve almost dropped his phone, eyes going slightly wide as he gawked at tony who was looking at him expectantly.
time and noticed they all looked just as concerned."I am not sure Thor,but I think he is just tired from yesterday's gala and the SI meetings .He really needs to take a break"
“He wanted to go home, I let him go" he earned a dubious glare from her and he shrugged his shoulders pulling one of the files towards himself.
Steve startled but he knew they had to talk about this. But he also didn’t have a good answer for him.
He got up and cornered Tony against the wall and held him still. Tony tried to squirm his way out but Steve held him firmly in place and waited for him to still.
Steve was grateful that these two were the ones Tony was comfortable with. He has known them for the few years he has been teaching and Steve knows that they are good kids.
“unlike some of us, I actually went to the doctor" Steve said trying to divert the conversation and focusing on Tony.
“Tony, did steve hurt you? Tell me the truth” he asked knowing Tony at the moment wasn’t capable of screening what he was saying.
“I am just tired I think" something was really amiss if Tony was even admitting this. But steve brushed it off and kissed him softly on the lips , but what he intended to be a quick innocent kiss quickly turned into something more heated as Tony put all he had into it.
Thor and clint had done an exceptional job at trying to make the hospital room more homely. It looked nothing like a medical bay , save for the bed with the railings and a few things attached to it.
that was something Steve had not considered even, that tony had seen the weak side of him. To everyone , even tony captain America would be this hero and Tony had witnessed the fall of the captain and that would have jarred him.
“Steve?” he heard a voice call and he turned his head towards it, to find bruce and  natasha already dressed and ready for the day at his door.
“No. You don’t get to do that, you have been AWOL for the last three weeks, there hasn’t been a second I have stopped worrying about what is going on with that heart of yours. You told me no coddling and I agreed to that. What I didn’t agree to is for you to cut me off completely and then walk in again and expect everything to be okay . So either you tell me what is wrong or I am sleeping on the couch today.”
"I will see you at three tomorrow." Fury said dismissing them all. Just as he left the room, his eyes immediately fell on the commotion happening in the room opposite to theirs. The one where he left Tony.
Two hours later, found them all relaxing at the tower eating Clint's pizza, on the common floor. Clint and Natasha lived here and while steve was offered a place of his own at the tower he had refused it in favour of his apartment. He liked the independence but he also did spend a majority of his time at the tower with his teammates.
"It would be better for everyone if you backed off rumlow" Steve said hands casually in his pockets as he stood by the wall of the now closed door.
“you tell him this, he will make it his mission to do exactly the opposite. Bruce you know him, this will take him down faster than the news of the reactor did”  steve said, tony groaned at the noise , trying to turn onto his stomach but the equipment made it impossible
“show me the injury, please” Steve said turning to Tony but Tony only moved farther away from Steve into the couch.
“I…we …no!” Tony sputtered as he tried to pull away from Steve but he was just held down more firmly by steve as he chuckled
Steve let his head hang down again , giving up on looking up at the two. His neck was aching and he needed to brace himself for what he knew was coming. He had seen it happen during the battle at new york.
“Can I touch you?” Tony nodded jerkily and Steve quickly reached out to unbutton Tony’s top few shirt buttons and pried his fingers away holding them to his own chest. He took an exaggerated breath prompting tony to do the same
Tony was now struggling to breathe and Steve pulled Tony’s back against his own chest and bent down to bring his lips to his ear
“Pepper says I have to apologize for the way I behaved , I am sorry.” Again , Steve was taken aback.
It was well worded and had all the right arguments. Turning the page back front to look at the students name, he was shocked to see it was Tony’s paper. That came as quiet a shock especially after how disinterested Tony had seemed in his past few classes.
“Tony, hey you need to answer Steve buddy. We need to know what you took” Clint chided gently and Tony looked at Steve and then Clint and then at Steve again before he mumbled something that sounded like rumlows name and Steve saw red.
“Here’s the thing, we had an agent monitor Tony’s mansion since you were gone. And he said no delivery was made.”
“What now?” Tony asked finally relaxed that it was out in the open and that he didn’t have to hide it anymore .
"um think I am going to lay low today " I told her as I settled on one of the bar stools nursing my drink. That was enough for pepper to understand I didn't want to be disturbed. Bless pepper, she definitely knew me better than anyone. She gave me quick kiss on the cheek as she herded the people already lined up to speak to me towards her.
Steve rolled his but agreed anyway. “okay, but we are having this conversation one way or another today. Even if that means I have to give you detention to hold you back a couple of hours.”
Tony being naïve was making this all the more pleasurable for Steve and he was not sure if that was good thing or not.
“Let me just check your laceration on the back while you are here huh? How is that feeling?” he asked as he pulled Tony’s feet up onto the bed and spread his knees apart to see below his butt.
“Hi steve!” he leaned forward for a kiss and Steve gave him one but pulled away quickly leaving Tony to pout
“ let me have a look at that injury of yours" he said pointing to Tony’s midsection. And Tony took a step back
“hey birthday boy, what say we let you drive today?” she said holding up her very expensive car keys that Tony oh so loved so much.
“Thank you" he said politely and sat down at the table where Clint placed some pancakes in front of him
“Honey I need to make sure it’s not something serious" he said gently and gave him a kiss on his pale lips.
“Who are you calling?” Tony asked alarmed “don’t tell obie, ill go home okay? I’ll go back to boarding school please"
It worked flawlessly, expect that I didn't take into account what the reactor would do to me when it had reached a point beyond it energy capacity. So when I fell on to my knees from the jerky electric shocks going through me , an almost naked bruce ran up to me
“he’s going to be fine steve" Steve was disturbed from his thoughts as he sat along side Nat and Clint at the front of the quinjet.
”obie said my parents were murdered and that’s why I have to be protected” Steve froze , watching as tony carefully lifted his head to look at him
He trailed wet kisses all along Tony’s neck and his shoulders before nipping at the skin there and Tony whimpered when Steve sucked on the skin but for the first time Steve didn’t stop and he caught Tony’s hands that were trying to push him away and held them above his head. Tony whined when Steve ran his tongue over the now deep red skin , soothing the pain he had just inflicted.
Tony also seemed to have gotten over his infatuation with Steve, which Steve was very happy about but was heart broken inside knowing he cannot , just cannot feel for Howard’s boy in that way.
“Just somethings here and there, I remember you being there the whole time and maybe a little of Clint and nat and bruce poking and prodding every now and then. I hated it when he cleaned the casing , that hurt a lot”
“Is he?” he started his breath stuttering still but natasha understood him as she did the same as Steve had done before ghosting her hand down across Tony’s pants and she nodded her head “he’s fine. Head to the recovery room by the med bay on this floor. Phil has a change of clothes and some blankets there for you.”
“do you know what triggered it?” Bruce shook his head in negative “his friends said when he didn’t show up to physics they went looking for him and found him like that.”
“I have had worse” he said grumbled and that made Steve want to hold on to him not let him go . But he knew it was important to let Tony make the decisions. Steve was going to help him, but Tony had to be willing to accept it or things could go very wrong.
“Yeah I am tired. Can we go back to my room?” he asked and Steve only nodded , moving to pick tony up.
“Can you give us a minute? And close the door behind you” he asked the nurse who nodded sympathetically at them ,
“ Hey. I am Tony. I am originally from here but was in boarding school up until last year. I am looking forward to enjoying the remainder of my schooling here” he said flashing his teeth and sat back down after a few cheers of “welcome Tony!” “oh man you have so come to wrong place then!” Steve just shook his head and turned the page in his book.
“It’s nothing for you to worry about” tony pushed away from him with a hand on his chest, scowling at Steve.
Thing? There ? Steve knew he was by no means a stranger to sex and he has had his fair share of experience but what the hell was Tony talking about?  Steve didn’t reply , he knew his face looked constipated right now and it was not even funny .
Steve watched in a trance as the elevator closed with the two of them inside and was snapped out of it when Clint clapped him on the back and whispered in his ear as they both stared at elevator “you know what’s going to happen once they hit the floor above right?”
“No!” he screamed as Tony felt hands gripping him under the gown and tried to get away from her but Steve held him in place quickly moving to sit behind him holding his arms firmly folded across his chest as he spoke into his ear
After another twenty minutes of pointlessly idling around his students , they finally decided that they were ready to move onto the next floor and Steve almost sighed in relief and was met with a knowing smile from Natasha. He ignored her, about to walk past her when the elevator opened and a frazzled looking pepper stepped out, her eyes scanning the floor rapidly and relaxed only when it landed on Steve’s own. She made her way quickly to him , ignoring her friends around her who tried to get her attention and stopped so close to Steve, no sense of personal boundary when  he realised that she wanted to tell him something that was not meant to be heard by the others. He frowned and leaned down so she didn’t have to crane her neck up and whisper
Steve gently ran his hand through his hair and Tony sighed turning his head towards his palm seeking the warmth.
As Steve entered the living room again, he found Tony standing by the window looking outside but not really seeing. He startled as he heard Steve shuffle across the room. He swayed lightly on his feet and grabbed onto the table for support but avoided looking at Steve.
“Tony , look at me” Steve said with a firmness that had the hair on Tony’s neck standing. He turned slowly as Steve gently took hold of Tony’s hand gripping his arm.
“we will start with three of you, then do the rest. Who wants to go first?” she was way to chipper,that was for sure .
That's when I noticed it, took in my surroundings properly. There were two syringe barrels, a stethoscope, a thermometer and oh my god! Needles!
“they are horny teenagers Steve, do I really have to spell everything out to you?” he said snacking him on the arm and walking over to a group of kids who were pointing at something.
“You know thor, not everyone is as shameless as you" natasha said and thor glared at her “not everyone have what I have to offer" he said puffing his chest the muscles contracting and Tony was starting to get distracted
He still didn’t look convinced so Steve added “you will even get an actual note excusing you from gym" and Tony cracked a smile at that.
“I need you to answer this for me okay? Is someone hurting you?” He asked carefully studying the emotions that flitted across Tony’s face.
“Shut up, don’t ruin this for me” steve was taken by surprise at Tony’s outburst and his eyes widened just a little bit
“Hey come on Steve, don’t go back there. Look at me” he felt someone shake him lightly and then turn his face to face them.
Steve unfortunately did not have the kind of self control he had been trying to use with Tony today, because he had missed this and it had been a hard couple of days. And that one little kiss made his Cock stir in interest and Steve had to forcefully remind himself that Tony was currently recovering from heart surgery.
“did that feel okay?” he asked as Tony pulled his legs together and closer to his chest and then said monosyllablly “good" his voice was hoarse and Steve reached for the water bottle he had on his nightstand and handed it to him. He took a small sip before closing it and throwing it onto the other side of the bed.
“Mr Rogers" one of the girls sitting behind tony raised her hand after Steve had handed the classes with a note on his absence for the next few weeks.
“I know it seems like there are a lot of secrets people are hiding from you, I know what that feels like. But sometimes you have the understand that they are only holding information back to protect you” tony frowned at him not liking what he was being told.
“I told you NOT to call him" he heard Tony whine from his right side and he turned his head sharply glaring at him and Tony took a step back from the intensity of the glare. He was wearing a sweatshirt around his waist and was holding a small wad of cash in his hand. He looked flushed and completely inebriated.
“I graded your paper today" he said watching Tony’s face for his reaction and all he got was an “oh"
“I think I have some gym shorts I was supposed to stash in my locker,” he said rummaging around his bag and steves face fell as tony triumphantly pulled and held up a pair of shorts.
He sat him down on his bed , and tony was being surprisingly pliant to everything Steve was doing. He even let Steve take of his shirt and pull into the bathroom. He sat on the counter as he watched steve bustle around filling the tub to their liking. He wasn’t exactly sure how how Tony would react but he was going to be selfish just this once.
just as Steve was about to run his fingers through his hair to check his scalp for signs of injury tony leaned forward again , wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck in a crushing hug.
Tony closer to him , his face hiding in Steve’s chest. He could feel his lips quivering against his skin and Steve kissed the top of his head
Steve hadn’t turned around two seconds to place the catheter onto the tray and Tony had already shimmied back into his pants and Steve chuckled at his sudden shyness after everything he had been through these past few days.
Steve was now panicking, he walked swiftly in and out of the adjacent rooms looking for Tony. Halfway down the corridor he suddenly remembered that he had finished his class early. Looking down at his watch he saw the it was only now time for the next period and Tony usually had gym after Steve’s class. He headed towards the gym , fingers literally crossed that he would find Tony sitting on the bench outside as usual. But he wasn’t there , entering inside Steve immediately gave a sigh of relief when he saw Tony sitting alone on the stairs watching a basketball game.
“yeah, I-  tony is refusing medical treatment? You said he was fine” he said pointing to Clint and he received a defensive stance from him
“Steve , you with me?” he heard from his left as he turned sluggishly to face Natasha’s concerned face. She gave him a small smile before reaching out to place a hand on his shoulder which was more grounding than he realized.
He turned around , stripping himself off his clothes down to his boxers and Tony gasped like he just realized what Steve had planned
Steve was glad, to see the many people to keep Tony protected at his most vulnerable. Clint had ushered the two kids out to the cafeteria when bruce had mentioned that they had to clean out the reactor.
Clint figured it out immediately and to make things worse he shouted “tony come get your man, he’s killing the fun outta everything”
“Good, so I need you to follow my breathing and take a deep breath okay?” He said as he placed Tony’s palm against his chest and took an exaggerated breath eyes never leaving Tony’s.
Steve gave an amused smile as he went back to grading his papers. Tony was doing a lot better since they returned home one week back. A lot of things had changed since they had come back . The biggest being that ,in the time Steve had been captured, they had recruited Bruce to be part of a research scientist on shield . Which steve was so excited for because now he had another person he could finally talk to without having to be careful of what he was saying.
“What happened?” she asked as she rolled up tissue paper around her index finger and quickly wiped Tony’s mouti.nh clean with a practiced expertise.
The sudden shock of silence made Steve’s irregular angry breathing sound noisy in the kitchen space. It didn’t being there and yet Steve couldn’t stop it.
“So Tony would have to write stane in, which would mean he had to be good Tony not the other way around" steve said flipping through the other files.
“get your head out of the gutter" Steve said rolling his eyes as he brushed Tony’s hair of his forehead but Tony pushed up on his chest onto his elbows as he raised a suggestive eyebrow at Steve.
The food in front of him was barely even touched as he licked a finger to turn the page on his book. Steve  wanted to walk over there, and feed him knowing Tony would eat everything without even realizing that he was being fed when he was so engrossed in his mechanical books.
“Not sure , they were playing a game and I heard sudden yelling and she collapsed the moment I turned to see" steve nodded
“Here , remove the shirt and hop up on my desk “ Steve said unwrapping the bandage, Tony without a moment of hesitation did as told. He lifted his arms up so Steve could wrap around his torso, wincing as Steve tightened it.
“Its not something you have to apologize for, I just want to know that I am not making anything worse okay?”
“wait, you need to here this first. “ Steve’s breathing had intensified and he tried to calm himself enough to listen to what was being said to him
“I should ask you that. Let’s go have a bath okay? Then we need to head up to shield" he told him and Steve wondered if he had understood what Steve had meant by ‘let’s go have a bath’
“I know you feel it too, don’t lie to me please steve not after yesterday” he was pleading now and Steve was feeling worse than he was all night “you know you are only hurting me more by letting me go”
“Are you okay?” he asked as he took a few steps towards the window because he suddenly felt like he needed to make sure there was no threat waiting outside.
“stane was the first into the crash site, he found tony, crying but very much alive. He took him away for fear of someone coming back to finish the job.”
Steve left a while after , he didn’t feel guilty for coming here when he knew Tony would worry but he actually just wanted sometime to himself before Tony was back. They had planned a dinner at the tower with the team and thor was going to be there too. Clint had vowed to get the best tasting cake there ever is and thor was very excited.
“I am going to be seventeen” he said in an arguable tone and Steve held back a smirk, tony looked barely fifteen what with his boyish face and and baby skin, not that Steve had thought about that when he was feeling him for broken bones.
“Woahhh" he said drawing out the word and leaned forward as if to touch but he pulled his hand back to himself unsure and Steve was actually very glad for that. He did not want to be reacting inappropriately to Tony’s touch at the moment.
“Okay, I got you. You are okay honey" he spoke nonsensical things hoping to keep him calm and pulled the pink material down to Tony’s thigh and his trembling worsened as he tried to curl away from him ,but Steve held him in place pulling him close and giving him as much comfort as he would seek .
“You know I can’t just let what you told me slide right?” to my visibly swallowed before looking down
Tony all but shouted and grabbed Steve’s hands tightly and Steve sighed turning his wrists around and captured Tony’s hands instead.
His friends were casting worried glances at him every now and then. There was a moment when Steve thought Tony had fallen asleep , but he noticed Tony’s fingers clenching and unclenching around his pencil.
“Its going to be okay. We are going to take things slow and we will do it together . One step at a time.”
“Not going anywhere, I am right here.” Tony’s eyes fell shut and Steve eased the mask back over his nose and mouth.
“Better?” Steve asked his own heartbeat finally slowing enough to focusing on other things like the awkward way Tony was listing.
“Sorry – oh uh I mean yeah okay” Steve chuckled before he pulled the covers over them both Tony wrapped safely in his arms .
"tony, we need to wait till Fury gives briefs us about the situation" Bruce said. Well yeah, but isn't it more fun if it's a surprise?
He had almost expected tony to not show up at all the next day in class especially after the constant cold shoulder he had received from him during the rest of their time at the museum. He was relieved however when he found tony in his usual spot at the back of the class between his two friends.
“That explains a lot actually” Tony said pulling his legs up and sitting Indian style on the bed as Steve sat down on the chair beside him.
“ give the kid a rubiks cube. He will be fine” he heard one of the other teachers say followed by a few chuckles and Steve smiled to himself thinking about just how fast Tony would figure that out and be bored all over again.
How had steve slept through this? He ran his hand over his face, clearing the weariness out of his mind as Tony whined and twisted more seeking Steve’s warmth ,but when he didn’t find it, he tucked both his arms between his chest and the bed and settled again.
Thor gave tony a shrug and they both chuckled quietly. Steve could tell they would get along well together.
"Steve said you haven't been sleeping well this whole week. You have hardly spent any time with the team at all. Bruce says you are hardly getting any work done when you are down at the lab. Jarvis told me you have been drinking more coffee than normal just to keep focused. Not to mention yesterday night and of course, let's not forget you fainted! Out of the blue. That's not normal for you tony."Nat said all in one breath it almost made me dizzy trying to process what she had spoken.
“I think it’s best we don’t rush this. If we are going to nail them,  then we need all the Intel we can get. “ Steve and Clint nodded
“It’s okay” he said so softly Steve almost missed it. Steve’s head was reeling, he had never seen tony show any kind of vulnerability and this was all too sudden.
“Pepper wrote it for me , she has excellent penmanship" Steve’s hand froze on the sheet and he carefully thought out what he wanted to say next
“ he should be okay , just give him some time to recover. We have him on saline and need to monitor his urine output. We anticipate he will be waking up soon. Try to get him to drink as much fluids as possible when he does wake up. Maybe coax him into eating something, nothing too solid, maybe some pudding” steve nodded as the doctor continued “we have given him a dose of paracetamol for the fever. That should do, the fever seems mostly due to exhaustion . You guys did an excellent job with the wound so I wouldn’t worry about it" he said smiling at Steve.
“Yeah?” he muttered as he took in his surrounding, he must have also fallen asleep because the last thing he remembered was Tony holding his hand hostage before falling asleep.
so when they standing hand in hand, casing the area based on some intel they had gathered he hadn’t expected to see tony and pepper taking the subway as well.
”you were doing it all this while, now you just know that you are doing it to protect him” she was right but Steve felt awful. If tony had been any older when the accident had happened, he may have even remembered Steve.
“There was a SI launch party at home. Lot of people were there and obie occasionally let’s me drink. And the next thing I know “ he looked down at his pants “I was feeling icky and weird and then rumlow was being handsy so I left as soon as possible. And called rhodey and pepper cause I didn't want to be alone” Steve was glad he had called them but he was more concerned as of why he hadn’t called him
"I don't need to go to medical! I am fine, see?" "I am just tired, and I was drinking at the party, I just need to sleep it off!" I pushed off the couch feeling dizzy almost instantly but I pushed the feeling away as I walked past Nat and Clint into the elevator.
He knew he had to talk to Tony about it or atleast find out where the problem is. He is the teacher after all and Steve couldn’t bear the thought of Tony failing his class. Bruce had offered to help and Steve was ever grateful. He had been engaging Tony as much as possible in the science-y things he normally does and now that he had access to all of shields toys he had been busy.
“Steve , we knew you were alive because we were monitoring the tracker but couldn’t talk about it in front of Tony once we realized that he must be unknowingly carrying the bug"
Halfway through, as simba was reuniting with Nala, Clint got up and expressed his need to use the facilities, and demanded the movie be paused. Thor gave an irritated sigh and paused the movie.
“I am going check you over quickly and then we are going to talk” he said as he went into his bathroom to retrieve his first aid kit. It was stocked well considering his superhero status.
The answer was there right in front of them this whole time and yet nobody had connected the dots. Yet nobody was shocked either , it was just a moment of relief that they had figured it out.
"you can choose whatever you want, as long as it's not a chick flick." Natasha said as she washed her hands.
“legal will have words for you” was all stane said glaring at Steve not even looking at Tony in the face before both of them left.
“Tony , please. Do you want to be sedated?” steve asked finally letting him know what the alternative is and Tony let out a disgruntled whine and glared at him.
Everything was going smoothly, Steve had come to terms with what he had been told. He kept his distance from Tony, not engaging in any unnecessary conversation .
Once he had covered every little bruise with the salve Steve pushed himself up reaching for the tube that Tony was about to throw into the bag,
Before his mind could process what he was doing he ran the edge of his thumb across the rim and prayed to the gods that Tony didn’t feel it because of the numbness from the ice pack.  When tony didn’t react , steve sighed quickly pulling his finger away and forcing his eyes to shift to almost healed laceration.
“I need to know tony, this is not okay. Please show me where he hurt you” tony was starting to tremble and Steve knew he was setting off a panic attack immediately given how tony started breathed faster.
“I need you to take some nice deep breaths for me buddy” tony didn’t seem to register what he was saying , So Steve gently tipped his head back to look at him and he could make out that he was clearly still zoning in and out of reality probably still processing what had happened. It hurt him to think tony had been left alone in this state the whole time he had been unconscious.
“What are you thinking?” he asked as he crouched down to fix his shoes, but steve knew he really just wanted to see Steve’s expression for tell tale signs of something more than just emotions.
“That might not actually be a problem" natasha said grinning “I did some snooping, as to why shield is protective of Tony. Apart from his genius , a lot of Howard’s inventions and tech are all part of shields R&D which means the entire lab equipment rightfully belongs to shield.”
“But I can tell you now that he can go home this evening. I’ll have the nurses do the paperwork and keep you informed. Let us know if you need anything else" steve thanked him and headed towards the room Tony was kept in.
“Tony has been working very hard these past few days, and he discovered a new element , that can be used to replace the palladium.”
“Is he going to kill me like he did my parents?” he asked when Steve and Tony were the only ones in the back of the car.
The next few days Steve could do nothing but think about two thoughts that just kept spiraling back to him no matter how hard he tried to distract himself.
“Unggh" Steve crushed his lips to Tony’s open and panting mouth as he stroked both of them at the same time in his large palm Feeling Tony’s body jerking on his lap .
Relationships were hard on anyone on the team , the work itself was the biggest problem. Steve knew that all too well and has been dealing with it up close with Tony. But for natasha , it was the personal that was hard. It took her a long to trust Steve and he knows her history now and what it must be like to always be ready for betrayal.
Must be a new student then , Steve smiled to himself and walked on to his first class which would begin in ten minutes. Which meant he had ten minutes to get his desk in order.
He muttered a few helpful things and Tony screwed his eyes shut tightly as he took deep breaths. He ran his gently through his hair as he watched his lover suffer through the pain. He knew just how much pain any kind of impact to that region could cause. Remembering rhodey mentioning that he had thrown up Steve left him sitting there for a moment while he could get him some water to drink.
tony didn’t say anything, instead he seemed to be looking for something as his eyes roamed all over Steve. Now Steve was worried that maybe he had a concussion and wasn’t processing Steve’s words.
It took a few seconds but she eventually opened her eyes. Steve grabbed her flailing hand as confusion took over holding it firmly
“Has this happened before?” Curiosity was taking over and Steve needed to reign it in because he knows how defensive tony gets but when he was met with silence he knew it was already a lost cause.
The bell rang shrill and loud and Steve flinched just a touch, it always took a while to get used to at the beginning. In less than two minutes his classroom was filled with noisy banter.
“where is your school bag?” he asked instead and Natasha’s eyes widened as he saw the realization hit her face too.
“I found Tony and his two close friends pepper and Rhodey at the back of the compound while I was looking for some samples to show the kids under the microscope, during the third period.”
“I have to go do my homework” tony said getting up suddenly as soon as the game was over and Clint whined but made his peace with it quickly.
“No! I mean, I will never give up on Bucky as friends but Tony is the only one for me” he was shocked at how confidently that answer came out of him and natasha squeezed his hand
“Color baby?” he asked as his eyes bore into Tony’s,  fear and everything mixed into something that Steve wasn’t able to read.
“My desk is not meant for you to be sitting on” he said after clearing his throat not wanting to startle him.
"Can you let Fury know I will be back in thirty minutes?" The agent nodded uncomfortable at the prospect having to inform Fury.
“That’s all I ask" he said and dropped a kiss to his hair. His hair , which steve was realizing was sweaty and sticky and he needed a bath.
Tony curled into him even more and he sighed , a long drawn out tired whine escaping his lips as he tried to get comfortable again.
Natasha walked over to the refrigerator to pull out a water bottle, taking a sip and dropping the bottle on the counter as she eyed them both carefully.
“Tell me why you think it’s not fair?” he took a moment,  and Steve watched the annoyance flicker across his face at Steve’s question but he held his gaze until Tony gave in.
“Good I am happy to hear that, but I need to tell me if you need help okay? Even geniuses need help sometimes" and Tony snorted
“Okay, I think you are done for the day. Let’s get you home" he said tugging him upright gently and Tony bucked pulling away
"I am leaving tomorrow for the training camp, I'll be back in two days" I said into his ear. I felt his hold on me tighten but he nodded his head. Lifting his head he pouted "Oh no! Whatever am I to do without my boyfriend?" He said in his most dramatic mannerism. Two can play at this game! I trailed my hands up under his shirt slowly and felt the shiver that ran down his spine and I removed them just as quickly.
"You know Tony, it's not very nice if you don't participate in your own party" I turned towards Bruce who sat down on the stool next to me. He turned to the bartender and said "that's enough for him "and cut me off.
“am I allowed to come over to your place?” he asked as Steve checked to see how deep the bruises were.
His classroom was exactly the way he had left it, save for a few new supplies of pens ,markers and papers that were left for him on his messy desk. He sighed looking at the clock at the far end of the room, that told him that he had ten minutes to get his things in order before the bell would ring and his students would be arriving.
“Steve am sorry. We don’t ever have to sex again if that means you won’t be sad. I know you have been really sad ever since” Tony was going to be the death of him. That much he was sure of.
“I don’t want anyone to see-“ Steve ignored him, turning him so that he could get a better look at the bruise.
”I’ll tell you what, I will sit here with you the whole time. You don’t have to sleep, just rest okay?” Tony shook his head again lightly
"Nobody is sticking me with any needles! And no one is calling pepper! What is wrong with you all I told you I am fine."I told them as firmly as possible.
“Come here” steve said pulling him by his ankle , so he was back to laying down and finished his job quickly and finally pulled Tony’s pants up himself and patted him on his thigh.
“You don’t have to go back home today. Natasha will make sure it will be alright, just until we figure things out" Steve said softly but slowly so Tony can really register it in his mind.
“shield medical, he was alert and conscious when we found you" and that’s when Steve realized he was on a shield base.
tony stumbled back a step at how angry Steve sounded but at this point Steve was beyond being bothered.
“What I think” Tony’s eyes followed him as he walked to the dustbin to throw away the plastic “is that fifteen year olds should be kissing other fifteen year olds” tony scoffed
Tony’s breaths were now tethering on the edge of hyperventilating ,Steve gave him a small smile tipping his chin up to divert his mind from his pulsing erection
“Oh you have no idea" Steve said as he his fingers finding a sensitive spot on Tony’s torso feeling him squirm underneath him trying to get away from his touch
Steve closed his eyes for a second taking a deep breath and let it out trying to grasp all the information and really take it in.
Steve took that as a cue to barge into the room taking in the scene , Tony was sat on the edge of the bed two people looming over him ,one holding an oxygen mask as he tried to coax it on Tony but he wouldn’t allow it even though it was clear he was in the middle of a full blown panic attack.
“Steve, you are scaring the boy" he heard from the door and he was jerked out of his thoughts as natasha and Clint came in carrying trays of food and coffee that was still steaming .
"Steve! What are you doing put me-" steve cut him off with a kiss as he walked them to his bedroom while Tony squirmed harder. But he was obviously no match to the super soldier as he was dumped onto Steve's bed, albeit carefully so as to not jostle his injuries.
“Sorry, “ he apologized and Tony cursed him with some very colorful words that Steve ignored in favor of grabbing the ice pack and placing them against the bruised skin.
”I don’t want anyone to see” he said again adamantly and Steve sighed wanting to wrap his arms around tony and protect him from the sights of everyone.
“Steve, get back to the tower, tony is having a panic attack. I am not able to calm him down and I don’t know what happened between the two of you but he needs you . Now" and Steve was running at full sprint back to the tower before bruce was done speaking.
Bruce was waiting for Steve with a tray of food at the cafeteria. It had been a troubling two hours as Steve fought with his thoughts about Tony so this was a welcome distraction.
“you ready to go?” steve asked as he stepped in to find Tony pulling on a fresh shirt over his head.
It was getting frustratingly hard to get any straight answers from Tony, so Steve decided to play the professor card,
Before he could retaliate , the door opened and Steve swore he saw the brunette freeze for a second as his eyes landed on Steve before jerking out of his momentary trance and running forward landing on his knees in front Steve.
“Uhm, if you are busy we can come back later" the girl said , and two others who nodded like puppets behind her.
“Done baby, it’s in. Calm down, take a deep breath" he kept saying as he inflated the little balloon and Tony flinched when felt Steve tug on it to secure it.
“Can you come with me, something is wrong with tony” the urgency in her voice was the first thing that caught his attention and he was acutely aware of the stares he was getting from the others as pepper tugged on his arm to pull him with her, except Steve was an enhanced super soldier currently frozen in place at horror of possibilities, he didn’t even budge at the strength she was using now frowning at him until Natasha shoved him gently, bringing him back to the present “Steve, go with her” she said quietly from behind him and he released the lock in his knees , allowing pepper to pull him along towards the elevator.
“So far the working theory is that stane is dealing with underground weapon sales , somehow came across the guy behind Bucky's mind manipulation and when they captured me last month, stane used it to his advantage to make tony believe that I was dead"
“I don’t want him to know about this, until we can confirm it" he was surprised that it came out as a command , the time making him realize that he indeed needed to step up and take lead.
“Yeah clint , see I am fine. I don’t need this" he said waving the arm with the IV again and both Clint and Steve tried very hard not to roll their eyes.
“What I meant thor, is that Steve is missing his loved one. Who is well little" she said shrugging and pursed her lips.
“That’s good?” Steve asked carefully , he wanted to ask how his five days were. If everything was alright but somehow he didn’t feel like he had the right to anymore.
Steve leaned down and kissed him softly and Tony giggled again “are we going to have sex?” Steve’s face was red as he heard bruce choke and almost drop the yogurt he was carrying .
We were crowded around the snack table talking about why it was important to keep up appearances when the nurse asked “are you feeling alright Mr.stark?” all of our heads whipped around our eyes searching for the danger,it was a habit and no one commented on it. My eyes finally landed on tony, his head was bent forward resting on his hands which were propped up on his elbows on the pillow he had dropped on his lap. Everyone was quiet waiting for Tony’s reply But he didn’t say anything even after a couple of seconds. So the nurse placed  her hand on his back coaxing his head out of his hands so he would look up so she can make sure he is okay. But the moment she pulled his hand out from underneath his chin, tony listlessly tipped forward but she grabbed him by the shoulders looking at us for assistance. I took two large steps towards them and took hold of tony “put him on his back, we should elevate his legs" I nodded tipping Tony’s head back and sitting down beside him before lowering him onto the bed. Natasha grabbed two pillows and placed them under his feet elevating them. Tony had gone pale, his forehead covered with a thin layer of sweat. It was unsettling to see the ever chipper man like this.
”I said what I meant, he was concious and talking while they arrived. I don’t know the extent of his injuries” Steve nodded once
“Thank you” Tony was smiling sweetly at him and Steve’s fingers crushed the pen in his hand feeling the plastic painfully poke at his skin as he returned the smile that had his heart throbbing.
“Tony? Hey look at me” Steve said and that’s all it took for tony to snap his eyes open , eyes wide with fear as his fingers grasped at his shirt uselessly.
“meeting room eight, second floor. We didn’t give him access to the medbay” Steve smiled gratefully at her as she nodded and left closing the door behind her softly.
"He may be right" tony quipped pulling away "but I assure you it was definitely not me" he made a pouty face at Bruce who just shrugged back.
A few minutes of coaxing Tony out of his ruined boxers (which he insisted on doing alone but Steve was too anxious to leave him alone so they compromised on natasha leaving to help Clint and Steve turning away facing the wall) and into a fresh robe that was much too large on him saw them all finally sitting on the large bed lazing around.
“I think I’ll be the judge of that and there is plenty to talk about” he said as he sat on the edge of the table in front of tony who was warily watching him pull out a little flash light.
“He demanded we eat something of flavor and I may have conceded. I was not aware that Anthony was not allowed certain food groups yet and he graciously threw up all over himself" he said his face screwing up into disgust as he remembered. Steve winced at the thought of Tony throwing up with that thing in his chest.
Rhodey looked up at Steve with questioning eyes and Steve shook his head lightly trying to convey that he shouldn’t wake the teen. Pepper smiled next to them and leaned over to whisper in rhodeys ear, he then gently pushed Tony off himself letting his head fall into his arms on the desk and they left silently.
steve wanted to argue and say that he was more than capable of protecting the teen. But there was a a whole new sense to the word protect now that he had confirmed that tony was indeed Howard’s son. He was actually the one year old who had wrapped his fingers securely around Steve’s index finger trotting around Howard and Steve while they were at the mansion.
“So? You did it today anyways” he said frowning already reaching for Steve’s shirt but only to be pushed away
“He is Howard’s son? Stevie are you sure?” bucky said urgently and suddenly his face became pale. Both natasha and bruce moved forward to listen better
“He hasn’t been sleeping , I don’t know how to help him. “ It felt weird to be able to finally discuss about Tony with Bucky. He had held back for so long this felt like a relief to Steve.
“Tony was injured a week back and he refused to tell me what happened only admitted that it had to do with something outside of school, I need to know. Was he attacked? Is he being targeted by someone?”
Tony sat himself down on the bed immediately pulling apart the covers and over his lap and looked around the room
He pulled his fingers out and Tony whined at the loss and emptiness and Steve shushed him and pulled him closer before finally releasing his own hard cock. He hadn’t wanted to scare Tony with his size .
"He's just a kid Steve, he was just standing up for pepper" now steve gave clint his full attention.
“Asshole" tony finally whispered and steve choked on his spoon before setting it on the tray and quickly put the tray aside. He grabbed at the comforter pulling it away exposing Tony’s upper half and Steve leaned down to trap him there and Tony’s breathing got faster as Steve inched closer to those plump lips
Three weeks later, Steve had finally given up , as he realized Tony was just a regular kid, a popular one at that and quiet a bit of a genius.
Steve quickly pulled out some of his clothes that Clint had given him this morning , and managed to get them on tony. They were much too big on him and shorts were too large but it would have to do.
He squinted at the screen to look at the name half expecting it to be tony ,but he was surprised to find that it was actually Bruce.
His boxers were covering the wound already soaked through with blood but Steve highly doubted he would be willing to take them off anytime soon.
He handed the cup back and took a minute to take in his surroundings , everything finally sinking in. The realization was sudden as tony looked up alarmed at Steve.
Brown eyes opened to meet the blue ones only to find that they had turned almost black from lust and Tony found that he couldn’t stop looking into the perfect black of Steve’s iris.
“You were busy for a while, want to tell me what that was about?” he asked as he paced the room for lack of anything to do.
“Shield brother, I am glad you are back. How are you doing?” he asked and for once , he wasn’t sure if it was because their just woke up or that he was aware of Tony asleep that he kept his voice low.
“Tell me what’s wrong” steve shifted them so tony was laying beside him instead of practically on him.
“About what? I told you everything yesterday" he said hesitantly , it was clear he didn’t want to discuss this any further but Steve had to know.
“captain, I will leave the choice of the team to you, it doesn’t matter how it gets done as long as it’s done.” Fury was saying in a meeting at shield. Steve was considering the mission. Shield has been after this guy for a really long time now, finally after five years the man surfaced again and it was their biggest Intel yet.
“Tony,  I need to feel.” He said pleading for permission but knowing it would confuse him,  he hinted by untucking his shirt from the belt and trailed his free hand under the shirt feeling the warm skin as Tony's breath got shaky.
Tony just shook his head jerkily, his eyes bleary. He just mostly looked uncomfortable . Steve contemplated giving him a sedative but decided against it .
“ you are wrong! And I know you feel it too , you say you don’t want to hurt me but that’s exactly what you are doing.”
“Same holds good for almost seventeen year olds” Tony’s face fell for the second time that day and Steve’s hand reached up involuntarily to brush a thumb across the saddened cheeks , but he midway changed the motion to straighten the collar on Tony’s shirt.
“I am sorry, are you really mad that I didnt tell you?”  he mumbled and Steve’s heart broke that even now Tony only cared about making him angry.
Steve literally had to bribe Tony with cheeseburgers to make him sit in the bath, he hated it for some reason and he demanded steve stay with him. But he needed to talk to natasha , so he had taken a quick shower before drawing him a bath and pouring the Epsom salts into it.
The movie was okay, some thing about a guy stranded on some unknown place with lots of violence. Neither Natasha nor me were too interested but we were pretty comfortably settled on the couch in the common room. One hour into the movie, and we could hear the bickering Bruce and Tony walking into the Hallway of the common room.
He looked up at clint locking eyes “what if I forced him into this situation? Tony never wanted to report stane and I forced him to do it . He was uprooted from his own house and we did all that without consenting him.”
“ I was afraid for both of you in that moment . Bucky could have very easily killed you in that second” Tony winced and drew back a little
“That’s not fair" he said and Steve really was confused but he reminded himself to stay calm and listen. Because he really needed to listen to what Tony wanted and not just needed.
Fifteen minutes into french revolution Tony was listing against rhodey eyes closed his pencil slipping from his hand and falling to the ground. If Steve didn’t know the situation, he would have been irritated with the student and probably woken them up in an embarrassing way to make sure that he or she she doesn’t  fall asleep in class again. But for now Steve pretended that he didn’t  notice it and completed his class. Tony didn’t even stir as the bell rang. Thankfully pepper and rhodey were also aware that something was going on between them but they never mentioned anything out loud so far and just gave Steve a questioning look as if asking if they should wake him up or not. Steve nodded his head no , and went back to sit at his desk as everyone quickly packed their bags and left for gym. Tony was anyway excused from gym for a couple of days so Steve figured there was no point waking him up.
Everything hurt and the serum would fix it and then it would hurt again after they would beat him up again. Something didn’t seem right , no amount of negotiation or prying got a answer out of them.
“I really you can call you right?” Steve chuckled getting up as well trying to get the kinks out if his neck.
Steve found tony sitting on his desk, the papers Steve had been grading were now on the floor in a haphazard pile. But Steve was distracted by the way tony sat , his feet barely touching the floor , swinging back and forth as he typed away on his phone hardly noticing Steve’s presence.
“Tony? Sweetheart you are okay , I got you baby, I have you" he repeated over and over until he calmed down enough for Steve to ask him if he was okay
“Here, this “ tony thrusted something small,  button sized at him and Tony yanked it back from him before he could ask what it was and he climbed on the bed and tugged on Steve’s ear before pushing the little device in. Only then did Steve even realize that it was some kind of communication device .
“ I know the serum enhance your healing capabilities,  but do you still feel the same amount of pain as others?” he asked fingers tracing the bruise again with a feather light touch and Steve shivered as his fingers ghosted over his skin.
“is he okay?” Steve asked scanning the cafeteria hoping to find the familiar face and when he didn’t Steve turned to Bruce with worry “he said he is fine, was exhausted. I sent him to math, I think they haven’t been let out yet”
“Should we put something on it?” he asked already getting up and reaching for the bag Clint had got , they had both seen the abundance of medical supply the bag held.
His motorcycle was his best friend, of course apart from Sam and Natasha , courtesy of shield. School was only a good 5 miles away from his apartment. It was just a cozy little place, nothing extravagant and Steve absolutely loved it.
“I am sorry honey. I am leading the mission. I have to be there.” Steve wanted to promise him that he will be just fine, but he couldn’t do that, give false promises. Many times things did go bad, but Tony didn’t have to know that.
“He called to ask me if you were okay. Said he needed to make sure that you weren’t hurt or being held captive.” Steve dropped the phone , as he raced towards the sink his stomach giving in, he threw up until his throat was raw and probably bleeding from the strain. Steve had expected Tony to be angry with him , or even scared and terrified but he most definitely had not expected Tony to be concerned about Steve.
Well that explains it. "why is Steve back in bed sleeping?" I asked Jarvis because I knew Steve hated sleeping away the day light.
“ok guys listen up, this here are my good friends Clint and natasha , they are here to make you guys don’t go crazy" and the crowd groaned as they realized that there was going to be supervision.
“then get him to the medical bay in the tower, we will know immediately” steve nodded as he  trailed out after Tony, worry gnawing on every nerve fibre.
“It burns” he whimpered and Steve reached down with his hand wrapped a palm around it, stroked the slit with his his thumb to ease the burning. The fact that he was not reacting sexually to what Steve was doing told him just how much fear that moment with rumlow had instilled in him.
Steve quickly wiped up his hands and then handed Tony one to let him clean himself up and when Tony just stared at him instead of taking it from him Steve laughed amused
“Why are you up tony?” he asked trying again and then Tony sighed like some sad tragedy had just taken place, dramatic as ever
Tony headed back to the tower once he had accounted for everyone on the team for himself promising to send all his resources to help with clean up while thor steve and Clint stayed back to help.
“Tony? Tell me what’s wrong , I’ll do everything I can to help, you just need to tell me” she said cutting through his panicked haze. Tony immediately Shuffled away from Steve and towards natasha. Steve pretended it didn’t hurt. But he knew why Tony was afraid
tony gave him a confused look as Steve reached up to caress the soft of Tony’s cheek letting his trail trail down his neck and settle on his chest just over the thumping of his heart.
“Okay , If I show you that I am fine will that give you piece of mind? And you can rest for a while after?”
“What happened? Is he okay?” she asked slightly out of breath as she held up a small device that had Tony’s vitals on it.
“Nice place, I like your apartment better though.” He commented as Steve slipped his shoes off and sat on the bed and scooted away from Tony towards the headboard leaning against it .
“Tell me what is happening" he has never lied or kept information from her, it had been very hard to trust her but once he did come to trust  Steve found that sharing things with natasha was the easiest thing for him.
What surprised steve was the way Tony said it, he had begged for it like he didn’t believe Steve would stop and he patted Tony's  thigh ,his thumb caressing the skin there as he waited for him to calm down. He realised this was Tony testing him to know that Steve will really stop if he wanted him to.
"Bruce! you worry too much. I am fine now,as I was fine this morning"I told him picking up my wrench again.
“We want to do it as soon as possible, even tomorrow if Tony is willing” steve felt tony go rigid beside him and it hit steve that Tony was terrified of hospitals and doctors and hated anything to do with them. He wrapped an arm around his waist, gently pulling him closer and kissed his temple.
“I don’t know” the reply came quick and short but laced with exhaustion that no doubt came with the panic attack, with no explanation that left Steve frowning
Tony was out from under the covers in less than two seconds. His face flushed a bright red as he stared incredulously at Steve who by now was laughing so hard he had tears in his eyes.
“don’t be so hard on the kids, Mr.Rogers” nat said smugly as she walked to the little cart by the wall that held the medical supplies while Clint started opening the take out boxes, the smell suddenly reminding Steve just how hungry he was.
