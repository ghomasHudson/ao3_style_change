When Sam and Jess slowly make their way out from their room with almost identical bed-head, Jess has no problem stepping in and taking control of the kitchen for which Cas is eternally grateful.
All day Dean had seemed at war with himself- angry and frustrated now that things were really starting to change. Castiel had- to some degree- anticipated some disturbances in their recent peace, but he’d never imagined this. Not for the first time he wished for the ability to shelter Dean from the rest of the world.
“Dean, you don’t need to be under any undue stress. Especially so soon after the stress you’ve been under the last few days.” Cas says, casting a pointed look at Sam. “I suggest the topic of conversation be switched to something less vexing.”
“Hello Dean,” Cas pants back still smiling, turning his head to kiss the palm of Dean’s hand. But then he’s moving down, clambering down the couch until he’s level with Dean’s belly. Placing his hands back on either side again, Dean watches as Cas looks up to look questioningly at him. He doesn’t know what he’s about to do, but he nods anyway, biting his lip when Cas leans down to kiss his belly lightly and whisper, “Hello baby.”
salad right now, aren’t you?” he teases. “Sam here, is all for ‘going green’ or whatever those hipsters are calling it these days, isn’t that right?”
“Of course, Dean,” Cas says, reaching into his back pocket and handing it to Dean. Having finished with the sheets, Cas picks up the laundry basket they’ve started with all the things they’d dirtied during his heat and heads towards the living room where Dean
Finishing up in the bathroom, he’s about to head back to the kitchen when the door bell rings. Then what are probably four or so fists are banging on the door.
“I’m fine. I told you I was fine before,” he says defensively, crossing his arms in front of his chest.
Sometimes he didn’t need words. Tugging him over to kiss him, it’s a lot softer than he’d imagined once Cas gets with the picture and kisses back. It feels like there’s meaning behind it as Cas reaches up to cradle his face and moves his lips gently against his. It’s the kind of kiss that should come with some kind of declaration; soft words reaffirming whatever is going on between them. It kind of feels like how he imagines mates would kiss.
Bobby waltzed right out the door, leaving Dean confused and gaping after him. Was Bobby seriously going to help that douche bag? There was no fucking way Dean was doing the paper work or anything for him. Uh-uh. Bobby could do it his damn self if he was still willing to take this dude’s business.
One more lick to his quivering hole breaks his resolve, has him abandoning his pride, has his world fucking tilting.
He’s slick enough, he can do it. He wants Cas right now, and he’s going to take him. He’s in control.
“It’s too big, Cas,” He mumbles against Cas’s shoulders, tears continuing to stream, but calmer now, sobs subsiding.
He doesn’t respond. Reaching forward, he gently touches his shoulder that is half way submerged under the water. It’s then that he realizes Dean is sitting in freezing cold water. God, how long had he been in here? Not this whole time, surely?
“Please, don’t be embarrassed, it is perfectly natural- your body is producing a multitude of hormones right now, and paired with the sight of you in an undressed state…” he says talking fast, eyes finally opening to look at him pleadingly, “But the reason I need a moment is due to the fact that my body is reacting…Your scent- it’s more potent after… sexual release. It’s clinging to you now, Dean- almost as if you were in heat-I didn’t want to invade your privacy, but I can’t- I can’t get up right now without embarrassing
“Dean Winchester, you are a horrible person,” Jess shakes her head, the beginning of a smile barely ticking up the corners of her lips.
Dean sighs and rubs at his eyes, trying to prevent the tears he can feel gathering. He’d thought he was over the crying. “Then it’s probably all the alcohol.”
In his mind, he imagines opening the door for who he knows is knocking, and as soon as he pictures those blue eyes, another image flashes through his head.  Those amazingly blue eyes, looking up at him hungrily while sucking his dick at the same that he’s fingering his-
“Yeah,” he answers, unable to stop his own smile from forming. “haven’t puked yet, have I? That’s always a good sign, right?”
Thinking about putting a name towards that feeling scared the shit out of him, but so did the thought of losing him. All through out their time together, Cas had been his rock, a steady pillar for Dean to lean on when things got rough, and he’d never once faltered. Cas has had his back through everything. And at this point, he was pretty positive he couldn’t go forward without the Alpha by his side.
Doing as directed, Dean took a slow breath in, and willed his entire body to relax. When he let his breath out, he could feel Cas’s dick slowly start to push inside him, coaxing Dean to let him in.
“To the bathroom, dude?” he laughs. “No. I’ll be right back. You better get us some bread sticks though, cuz’ otherwise I got dibs on eating your arm.”
Cas slowly gets to his feet-due in large part because his eyes are glued to Dean- and sits as close as physically possible before reverently opening the book onto his lap.
Dean rolls his eyes. “I think the state of my throat right now is answer enough, I guess.  But I think that’s just you, not the heat. You musta been lying that first night, man. And I’m not buying your bullshit anymore. There is no way you ‘don’t do this very often’,” he quotes Cas from that very first night. “Come on Cas. Tell the truth.”
“You-,” he starts, but clears his throat when it comes out wrong. He can’t even look at the screen, let alone meet his brother’s eyes. “You know enough to have realized that he’s better off without me, Sam.”
“Thanks, Cas,” he finally breaks the silence. And he means it. It’s kind of funny how he was so afraid of the Alpha before, but now that they’ve talked more and they’re both completely sober and not suffering from a panic attack, he can tell that Cas is a decent guy.
Don't listen to 'All of Me' by John Legend and think of Dean and Cas. Don't fucking do it unless you want to get super emotional.
Arms encircle him completely, warm breath ghosts over his neck as Cas kisses it, and Dean is sighing again for a different reason as he covers Cas’s arms with his own. Their scents mingle again as they had this morning, but Dean’s still a little bit stressed and he can tell that Cas is trying to relax him.
He’s glad Cas doesn’t laugh at him, only considers the question thoughtfully before answering. “Your pregnancy does make your body a little bit more sensitive, that’s true. But I’m willing to bet that our connection, what we have between us, is the biggest factor in the sexual gratification process.”
“Don’t worry about that,” Cas mutters, distracted by getting Dean naked. When he's finally- gloriously- naked, he grips Dean’s thighs and wraps them around his waist- only Cas’s jeans in the way now. “You’ll be reacquainted with it very soon.”
Immediately, Cas could sense the difference, as he slanted his mouth more to Dean’s, instead of the straight face to face fifth grade shit they’d been doing since Dean’s mind and body had refused to cooperate. Closing his eyes was so much better. Cas’s mouth was so fucking soft, even as he was kissing him like there’d be no tomorrow.
“How could I not be?” Dean asks simply, barely pausing to think about the words. They’re so fucking true. He’s so goddamn lucky, and he knows it.
Cas sets his shirts aside and squats to open the cabinets under the sink, grabbing a handful of washcloths before standing again. Without a word, he soaks them in warm water before using one to wipe gently at the blood on Dean’s face and neck. He’s not quite in Doctor Mode, because the entire time he does it, he’s got that soft look on his face that is distinctly Cas. It takes two washcloths for his face , and another one because of course Cas notices the slow tears rolling down his cheeks and patiently wipes those away too.
Catching the movement out of the corner of his eye as they’d drifted to stare blankly at the wall, he blinks a few times as Cas comes into focus. He has three water bottles and a protein bar tucked underneath one arm, and three wash cloths dangling from the other.
Choking on his next breath, he barely notices when Bobby comes into the room with Benny about ten yards behind him, still covering his nose and mouth.
Cas kissed him like it was going out of style, and Dean was more than on board with that line of action. Walking through the door as soon as he got there, on the couch as whatever stupid ass show played in the background, in the kitchen as they microwaved the food that they were supposed to have eaten an hour ago, and of course, before Cas left for the day. Fast, slow, fevered, or soft, it didn’t really matter. They never went farther than kisses, or shyly taking turns scenting the other, and Dean was super fucking relieved about it.
“Yeah,” she agrees, and then, “Would it be weird if I hugged you? It’s been a long time, Dean, and under the circumstances…”
“Aaaand it’s almost eleven. Shit man, I’m sorry I fell asleep on you… literally,” Dean says, shaking his head. “I seem to be saying that a lot lately, huh?”
“Don’t be a pussy, Dean,” his father’s voice came, dripping with disdain, “take your birth control and we can move on.”
Precome is drooling from the slit, but it’s nothing compared to the slick he can scent coming from Dean. With one hand he lazily jacks Dean, but with the other, he slowly rubs two fingers up and down the seam of Dean’s crack; rubbing the slick into Dean’s skin, spreading it, and inching lower.
Sighing, because this day can not end soon enough, he gets up to get the door again. And of course it’s too much of a coincidence for someone
Dean’s hasty switch of their living arrangements has Cas shooting him a confused look, but Dean only shakes his head. They can talk about it later. Now though, they’re all sitting around the kitchen table while Cas makes everyone coffee. Everyone except him, of course.
“I’m not sure I could explain it to myself actually,” Cas laughs quietly, “but I think the best way to put it would be to say that you’re different. I’ve never met anyone who puts me so at odds. And I’ve never met anyone who has reawaken every instinct I thought I’d never had the way you do. And you’re scent, Dean…”
Smiling at him one more time, Pamela presses the long instrument gently against the top of his stomach before pressing it down more firmly, holding it there a second, and then moving it in a small circle. She switches on a machine or a button or something, and suddenly there’s a static noise coming from close by, and she’s adjusting a large screen for him to see a grainy black and white image.
He was obviously missing something, because this man couldn’t be the same Alpha who his dad had told him about. When he’d first answered the door, he’d had this icy look about him, and Sam had automatically thought;
“Are you ready to get up?” he says, finally. “We have just enough time to eat and change before your appointment with Anna.”
Tears are prickling behind his eyes again, and he drops the bloody tissues on the night stand as a distraction. The blood has stopped.
“You’ve got to be - ” he pauses when Jess smirks at him. Looking down, realizing he’s sitting down, he glares at both of them. “I hate you.”
“I’m so relieved, Dean,” he jokes back quietly into the man’s ear. “And here I thought naming a child ‘Castiel’ was cruel. It’s good to know that you aspire for better.”
Cas raises his eyebrows at that but does a quick assessment for himself, looking like a doctor again as he looks Dean up and down.
“Nothing, I’m good,” is all he can think to say, knowing immediately that Cas won’t buy it. It’s kind of a pathetic lie, and his scent will only given him away more. “I- I just couldn’t sleep last night. It’s messing with me,” he tries to cover. It’s half-way believable, because it’s true. While not the root of the problem, lack of sleep would definitely throw him off in any other situation.
He’s about to check his texts for the thousandth time when he’s rewarded with the door cracking an inch, and a pair of blue eyes looking him up and down. Assessing him.
Cas snorts against the skin of his inner thigh but grabs the lube and drizzles his fingers, so he counts that joke as a win. Even more so when Cas circles his hole twice before sinking his index finger in to the first knuckle.
“You think I’ll still be this popular when this kid is outta me?” he can’t help but ask quietly. He didn’t really have much friends before all this, but that might have been because he was too afraid to let people get close to him in case they figured out his secret.
“Just an hour or so! You’re my only patient at the moment, so I’ll do my best to hurry along the process,” he hurriedly assured.
They lapsed into silence while they waited for the bartender to come back. While emotionally charged and heavy, the silence was comfortable. There was no pressure to speak. When she refilled their shots, the man visibly shook himself before turning himself completely on the stool to face Dean.
Sam laughs at his wording, and that little smile, the one that is all Sammy, makes an appearance complete with slightly watering eyes.
If people are looking at him, they’re looking at Cas too, and if people are looking at them, they’re fucking
Cas looks at him skeptically, and it’s clear he thinks Dean is lying to him. He has every right to think that with the way this had escalated so quickly. They were fucking lucky none of his neighbors had heard the altercation and had come to join the party, or worse, called the cops.
This whole fucking time he’d been afraid to hope, afraid that Cas would be wrong and this wouldn’t work out- he’d fucked up one too many times- and so none of it had clicked. There was a separation between him and what was happening, he knew vaguely what was happening, what he had to do, the necessary actions, but he hadn’t felt connected- not really- to the life growing inside him. Not until this second.
“I’m sorry. Are you alright?” Cas asks quietly, voice coming closer until he feels Cas’s stubble tickling his cheek and then his lips. Cas mouthing at his cheek and then his neck has him closing his eyes and weaving a clumsy hand into Cas’s hair to keep him there.
Dean was so obviously used to dealing with things on his own, choosing to isolate himself needlessly, that when Dean
“I was going to tell you,” Cas sighs as he comes to a stop at a red light, finally turning to look quickly at Dean. “I was just hoping to get out of it. That’s why I was putting it off, in case I found a replacement, rendering it unnecessary to inform you in the first place. But unfortunately, that wasn’t the case.”
way. Omegas couldn’t procreate that way, but he’d figure they would be in love, and would figure it out when the time came.
Like it was fucking nothing! And Dean was no feather either. He was pretty built, sturdy, strong from his days at the garage, so what the fuck?! This guy made him seem like no fucking problem. Okay, so maybe he was too drunk, but he had thought this guy looked lean and wiry.
Shivering, he tries to get under the covers as quickly as he can. He didn’t notice until now, but he’s fucking freezing; and the ice is doing nothing to help. Cas looks at him in concern as he gets into bed slowly, but Dean just shakes his head, he’s coming down from an adrenaline rush paired with his usual temperament of always feeling cold. There’s nothing Cas can do about that.
Reaching one hand to fondle Dean’s balls, and sinking down to suck him down again at the same time, Cas’s other hand slipped between his slit and directly to his entrance. Circling one more time, feeling how wet he was from sweat and saliva, and his own precome from when he’d jacked him, Cas gently slipped the tip of one finger inside his little hole.
This finally gets Cas’s attention as he turns to meet Dean’s eyes mid swing; and they make Dean want to step back. Because his eyes are huge, red rimmed, and dilated in his wrath.
“Hey, Dean?” she says quietly. “I don’t know what’s going through that head of yours, but I just wanted to remind you that both me and Sam are always here for you, okay? No matter what.”
“Yes. But Dean. There is something you should know…” Cas’s voice becomes hoarse, his words breaking a few times as he speaks now. “Despite my talk of family and the relationships I have with them, they are not my blood. My only family died when I was twelve, and I
Right away, Sam’s face pops up inches from the camera, concern and stress written all over his face. It’s like being hit with every single one of Sam’s puppy dog faces at once, which is clearly a concentrated effort.
Without his legs being restrained, Dean is already shifting onto his side the way he usually sleeps, and their bodies curl together seamlessly; two pieces of one puzzle.
“I don’t think it likes you swearing, Dean,” Sam says through his smile, raising his eyebrows at him.
Not including the brand of different he was dealing with right now. Groaning again at his reflection, he wonders where all the time went. It was finally Halloween, and he was supposed to be heading for the address Cas sent him any minute now. Key word being
uncomfortable, dude,” Dean snorts. With how huge he is and his now severely sprained ankle, he’s going to be uncomfortable no matter where he ends up. “Unless I can’t scent you. That’s a big no no, I’m guessing.”
“Yeah,” Dean gasps, completely high pitched and embarrassing. But Cas immediately does it again harder, so he forgets to be embarrassed in lieu of thrashing against the hold Cas has on his hips.
“Well then come here then, you big goof,” Dean waves him over, smiling a bit as Sam’s face lights up with child-like excitement.
Gripping Cas’s head tight to his chest where he’s nipping and sucking and all together driving Dean insane, Dean can confidently say that it’s here. The wave or whatever it is. He’s gasping, clenching his eyes closed in pleasure, and that’s before Cas’s other hand loosely circles his dick.
“Do you recall… Do you recall when I told you that our body’s chemistry would react based off each other’s- scents, emotions…desires?”
“Ahh. There we go,” she says, ducking to catch his eyes. “No more fear. What did you think, I was going to yell at you?”
The thing he’s feared being this entire time. And not only was he going through this for the first time, everyone around him would be as well. Come Monday, he’d have to confront Bobby. And at some time he’d have to see the guys, his customers, his neighbors, acquaintances at the store and what not; there were so many people who believed the façade, and they would all
. He’d been pretending he was something he wasn’t for so long he didn’t know how to be anything different. How to be
“It will fade with time and better scents, beautiful,” Cas reassures him, then hesitates. “Your apartment on the other hand…will need to be thoroughly cleaned and aired out.”
So he was basically on house arrest. He couldn’t go out in public smelling like pregnant, distressed omega. Not that he’d been straying too far from home or Cas’s house before, but he’d at least had the option to.
“Who knew mating would be this messy, am I right?” Dean cracks, winking when Cas levels a glare at him.
“See,” Dean says, turning to roll his eyes at Sam. “He’s one track-minded. This guy is all bark and no bite…
If his dad wanted to act all pretentious and snotty, he could definitely return the favor. He just wasn’t sure he’d like the consequences when all was said and done.
And judging by the hitched breath that comes from behind him, Cas is very aware of the significance.
“Don’t you think you should call him, then?” Bobby’s baffled voice breaks him out of his self-torture. It was a good thing too, since the car was starting to filter a new, more embarrassing scent with his only father figure sitting right next to him.
“No. I went to a clinic a few weeks back. I was having cramps and was moody as hell. They told me I didn’t need them anymore.”
If that were really the case though, shouldn’t that make him happy, or as least somewhat relieved? There was no reason why there should be a huge knot in his stomach, and a lump in his throat making it so difficult to keep pulling air through his lips. He felt like he could throw up. This time, not from the
Right before he opens the lid of toilet he hears the front door creak open, but he quickly forgets about it as he throws up everything in his stomach.
dripping of the man’s scent has him blushing and sets his heart racing at the same time. And not to mention wakes up a certain part of his anatomy he’d thought he’s sated earlier this morning…
“Dean and the pup need some love and care,” Cas says, ignoring Dean’s annoyance, and Sam’s answering bitch face. “But besides that and a sprained ankle, are perfectly fine. Although avoiding stress and strong negative emotions is also recommended,” he adds pointedly.
“You aren’t exactly fond of the hospital, Dean,” he says slowly. “I don’t want to make you more uncomfortable.”
As he carefully begins folding a brand new sheet of the same god awful wrapping paper, his mind still lingers on Cas. That butterflies in your stomach-heart feeling three times too big for your chest-my face hurts from smiling too much-feeling has yet to go away. And with the combination of Cas, Sam, and Jess, the feeling has only gotten that much stronger.
Cas, thankfully, is picking up what he’s putting down. He growls deep in his throat and runs his fingers down Dean’s body until he can grip dean’s hips.
“I wish I could make everything better,” Cas tells him. “I feel helpless. I hate that you’re feeling this way.”
He can hear Cas in the kitchen, probably cleaning up the mess they made at dinner so he figures he can handle the trick-or-treaters alone this time. It’s getting late anyway, there probably won’t be too many more of them. Maybe this is the last group? He would definitely not mind hitting the hay sooner rather than later.
Dean sits back in his chair and grabs a breadstick that must’ve been brought out while he was in the bathroom, content to watch the brothers bicker as long as he’s no longer the topic of conversation. Gabriel kinda seemed like a douche bag, but if this was the “kind” brother as Missouri had said, then he was not looking forward to meeting the other one. Hopefully he didn’t need to.
Dean continues to scent him until they can see and feel the steam rising from the shower. And since they’d already fooled around beforehand, their shower is quick and to the point- he only presses Cas back against the shower wall
“Shit,” he hisses as Cas circles it gently without pressing in, spreading his slick all around it as it continues to trickle out of him steadily. Minutely moving his hips backwards, Dean encourages him to slip the tip of his finger inside, biting his lip when he does.
. The only precaution he could think to take was to double his scent blockers, but even then, his scent was barely dimmed, but hopefully muddled enough not to raise too many red flags at the garage. His game plan was to keep his distance, and to hope that his previously surly and withdrawn attitude kept them from seeking him out. Then he’d be in the clear.
He takes a steadying breath and let’s the heat course out of him. There is a right way to do this, and Dean wants that for Cas. He can do this.
But the thought of letting Cas go right now, of sitting here cold and alone without the familiar and comforting scent of Alpha affection and concern...was physically painful. He’s sitting sideways on Cas’s lap, his knees tucked to his stomach as much as possible, but now he works his arms around Cas’s back from where they’d been tucked against his own chest. Sighing in relief when Cas only shifts a little to accommodate him before holding him tighter again.
As if sensing where his thoughts have wondered, he feels a hand on his shoulder. Opening his eyes and turning his head, Jess’s smile is the last thing he thinks he’ll see.
“I’m here, Dean,” he’s saying sadly, taking in the tears still stuck to his skin, “It’s okay, let’s get you hydrat - ”
“I love you kid, I really do,” Bobby had said, “but I can’t have you in here smelling like this. You’d scare all our customers away, or more likely cause a commotion... And this ain’t healthy,” Bobby scoffed in that worried voice of his, grabbing Dean’s shoulder cautiously. “You look awful. Y’need to get yourself right, boy.”
“No. No, it’s okay,” Jess waves him off quickly, aiming a sad smile at him and holding up her hands.
After they eat breakfast(Dean ate way more than he should have), they all kind of pass out in a food coma while watching It’s a Wonderful Life. Sam and Jess take the floor since everyone insisted Dean(and therefor Cas) take the couch, and Dean ends up tucked in between the inside of the couch and Cas, who promptly starts to snore in his ear twenty minutes in.
After he’d dropped off Cas, he remembered stripping on the way to his bed, feeling so hot and itchy, the thought of clothes smothering him had been unacceptable. In nothing but his boxers, how was it he was still so fucking hot?
him. And he couldn’t blame it on the alcohol this time. There was nothing and no one to blame but himself.
Leaving the bedroom, he goes across to the last closed door in the apartment. Silently, he prays that he will be in there, safe and sound. But if he was safe and sound, shouldn’t he have heard when someone was knocking on his door, calling his name, and then coming in uninvited? Dear Lord, Dean could be dying or dead behind the door, and he’s stuck out here worrying about it!
Cas had been trying- trying to get the pup and him healthy, to help them get sleep, to ease Dean’s discomfort –the little things every day that added up to him trusting Cas like he’d never trusted anybody in his life, whether he liked it or not.
But as soon as his eyes close and he begins to enjoy himself- trying to angle his head better to catch Cas’s lips with his own- he feels the hand that isn’t gripping his own slide down his back.
“How does hot chocolate with banana sound?” Cas hedges hopefully. The guy has it down, patented by now, he’s already pulling out there stash of ingredients they’d accumulated over the last couple of months without even really looking.
“Come on, Dean,” Cas opens door and starts to circle towards him. “You’ll be much more comfortable in a minute.”
“I hope you know I’m not naturally this clumsy,” Dean pouts, slowing the motion of their hips a little so he doesn’t have to pant around each word. “It’s little miss’s fault. I’m usually graceful as hell and a lot more slick.”
“Your server will be right with you, Castiel,” she says, trying to catch his eyes once more before she leaves. But Cas is too busy smirking over at Dean to notice.
“You do,” Sam says gently. “You have a mate and your pup, me and Jess. We’re not going anywhere. You got that?”
“No Cas,” he pants when he finally catches his breath, “I did not hit my head. I just remembered that I’m totally fucked, is all.”
“Don’t leave,” Cas opens his eyes and takes a step forward like he’s going to make a grab for Dean. “If you ever felt something for me Dean, if you ever truly cared- please hear me out. Just because I told you I love you doesn’t mean you have to reciprocate or even that you have to-”
His mouth is so dry all of a sudden that he has to force himself to swallow a few times before he’s able to string together any words.
“So here I am,” his voice dipping as he spreads out his hands, palms up, and eyes crazed. “I came all this way to give you a second chance only to be proven right from the beginning. I can smell you Dean,” John spits, “you smell like a mated whore.”
When Cas comes back in he hands Dean a bunch of paper towels as well as one of his old white t-shirts he’d let Cas borrow when he’d spent the night all those weeks ago. Looking at it now though, hadn’t it been a lot bigger before? Maybe Cas had washed it too many times or something, because it had to have shrunk.
“Did I hear the sound of hungry, dying people?” Gabriel comes around the corner, huge grin in place as he carries a covered dish towards them. “Because a little birdie told me a certain someone loves pie! Pie is a perfectly good lunch, right?”
,” he winces. It’s a force of habit. “So it kind of looks like my stomach has more pudge than it normally would.”
He winks before walking away, and it makes Dean’s stomach churn in disgust. Bringing his hand up to cover his mouth as the need to vomit arises, Dean abandons as he feels it coming. Seeing the restroom sign at the end of the aisle, he runs over, pushing the door open harder than he probably should have as it slams loudly against the wall; he steps as quickly as he can to the largest stall , barely locking it behind himself as he falls to his knees and throws up loudly into the toilet.
“Dean,” Cas moans, working Dean’s cheeks apart to spread him wider. “Jesus- you feel so good. You’re perfect. Perfect for me, beautiful.”
Shivering when he finally realizes how cold he’s gotten while sitting in the living room in only sweatpants and a long sleeve, he leans into Cas’s warmth a little when his waning anger fails to keep him warm any longer. It’s fucking freezing in here, how had no one noticed?
“I know what the stakes are-“ Cas interrupts him icily, shoulders hunching the way they do when he’s upset. “I don’t need a reminder.”
The motion doesn’t cause sharp pain, it’s more like a sore muscle being stretched after not having done so in a couple weeks. When he tells Cas as much, Cas nods, seemingly relieved.
“Don’t be. I’m actually kind of grateful at the moment,” he says, smirking. “Thanks to him, I know exactly what
She was a tiny thing, probably five or six- way too young to be out so late by herself- and her brown curls seemed to be a great source of aggravation as she blew them out of her face and looked up at him expectantly.
The way the water feels against his hole every time Cas moves in and out is making him lose his goddamn mind, and the way he and Cas keep sliding against each other, slipping against the slippery sides and bottom of the tub every time they try to find purchase just adds another layer of delicious frustration to the entire endeavor.
But when he opens the door, he’s momentarily surprised by the lone figure looking up at him through her smeared face paint. The little girl smiles up at him, proudly displaying two missing front teeth, and waves.
“Oh,” is all he says, surprised by how disappointed he is. It isn’t a big deal, he knows Cas has a life outside of him, doesn’t need to see him every fucking day for sure, but… he’s still disappointed regardless.
Gently turning Dean to face him, he finally sees the busted zipper hanging open in the front, the taps open wide and framing his huge belly. Dean’s still holding the
Squeezing his muscles together as Cas strokes his prostate again, he’s not even aware of the shout that passes through his lips or the way it tapers off to wordless pleasure so that he’s opening and closing his mouth against Cas’s shoulder now.
“We needed to do that anyway, Dean,” Cas throws an arm around him and starts to drag him towards the edge of the bed. “Your brother should be arriving in only a few short hours.”
“Yes, Dean is fine,” Cas calls back softly, his voice sending vibrations through Cas’s chest, soothing Dean a little more. Fingers start making their way through Dean’s hair again. “But we need a few moments.”
“Dean...” he tries to inch himself closer to Dean’s back, but Dean leans away. “Dean, please. Why didn’t you tell me before? I’m not trying to imply that this is your fault in any way, I’m just trying to understand.”
Taking a deep breath he takes Dean by the shoulders, and starts to lead him out the door, apparently done with their moment.
Standing there against Cas’s car, arms wrapped around himself and shivering, he watches Cas and Sam step closer to each other , lips moving in a conversation way too quiet and far away to hear. Cas has got his serious face on, eyes squinted and mouth a straight line, but Sam is smiling a little so he’s not too worried.
Castiel’s eyes widened. “So you’ve decided this is a date? What happened to Mr. I’m Not Gay?” he challenged, choosing to ignore the nickname.  Castiel was a fucking mouthful, he probably got it a lot.
“Now don’t throw a fit. But I’m,” Bobby hesitates, looking up at Dean, face hardening. “I’m puttin’ you on the register.”
And logically, Dean knows that this isn’t him. Knows that he wouldn’t be this openly affectionate or relaxed if he hadn’t been riding the high of self-realization from earlier. There’s no way to deny the fact that Dean is usually distant, refusing comfort in an form, so Cas probably knows too. That this little moment of peace can’t possibly last. And this calm and confidence is only temporary, but he might as well take advantage of it before his inevitable melt down.
“Now that Dean has said his peace, I’m going to say mine before you leave,” Cas says softly, eyes anything but. “If you
“And which point was that, brother? The fact that you been lyin to us all about yourself? Or maybe the fact that you are with an Alpha I ain’t never heard a word about before all this?” Benny smiles humorlessly, and Dean is surprised to steel behind his narrowed gaze. “You shut down for weeks- months actually- and then act like everything is fine? It don’t work like that, Dean.”
Dean is all desperation and heat, completely turned on all of a sudden by the man underneath him. There lips are making wet sounds as they meet again and again, stealing the air from between them, and Dean cannot get enough of him.
Cas nuzzles against his cheek, squeezing him tighter. “Now we don’t have to worry about that. I’m never going to grow tired of your scent. You smell so good right now, Dean.”
Things are a little different this time around, he’s huge for one, pregnant with Cas’s pup unlike the first time, so his body has definitely changed. But he feels different mentally as well as physically. He’s not drunk, he doesn’t hate himself- at the moment anyway-and he’s absolutely, one hundred percent certain of Cas.
“Shut up, Sam,” Dean snaps, angling Cas’s head down to feel around the back of his head, running his fingers through his still damp hair. He pauses when Cas winces, lightly brushing against his scalp where there’s a steadily growing bump growing. When he pulls his fingers away, there’s a tiny bit of blood on his fingers.
All he could do was moan in response, as he could feel Cas’s fingers scissoring inside him, opening him up, and simultaneously brushing against that spot, which he figured had to be his prostrate. It’s funny, because up until then, he’d thought the whole prostrate being compared to g spot had been a myth. He was fucking glad to be proven wrong this time. That had probably been one of the most intense orgasms of his life. And that was saying something.
would choose to trust their lives to a huge metal death trap, is all. Anything could fucking happen, and there would be nothing you can do. It’s not natural, man. People were meant to stay on the ground! And I’d much rather drive Baby anywhere I need to go rather than- why are you guys looking at me like I’m crazy?”
“Anywaaay,” Dean continues, obviously trying to recover. “Like being sick. There’s nothing you can do about it. I feel fine right now, I mean I can think straight for once.”
Dean all but whimpers, his breath stuttering in his throat. He feels wild, and out of control, and fucking
“Of course, Dean. Do you honestly believe they would base their opinion of you solely off of your pregnancy?” Cas asks with a note of incredulity.
The feeling of Cas knotting prolongs that feeling, making him feel almost over stimulated, and he whines a little pathetically at the feeling. His words haven’t quite made a reappearance yet.
“You think?” Cas asks, using a single finger to tilt Dean’s chin up to look at him. “Dean, I don’t mind at all.”
He wants to respond indignantly, be offended that Cas is asking such a brutal question, but he can’t. For one millisecond, the part of himself that had felt like this situation was happening to someone else whispered
This time is no different, which makes sneaking into one of his opponent’s hotel rooms increasingly difficult.
He’s still closing his eyes when he hears the door open again. He can’t look up or move as he waits to hear the results of what he could only assume was a pregnancy test taken from his urine. Coming in here today, he
He holds the phone away from him to gasp in as many breaths as possible- trying to take the desperation out of it- but he knows before he brings the phone back to his face that he’s failed.
When he comes back in carrying a familiar pink box, there is more kisses to be had. He eventually gets Cas to eat one with him- a circle one with chocolate frosting, red and green sprinkles covering the top of it- and then the sugar high takes over.
“I told you it would be, Dean,” Cas says softly, still caressing his stomach, “But talking about it, and
Rolling his eyes at himself, he glances at the window hoping to get a better idea on what time it is. It looks much darker than he’d originally thought, and for a second he’s confused on the
Mission accomplished, Dean grabbed at Cas’s hair, pulling his mouth back to his. They could do this all damn night as far as he was concerned. They could make out like teenagers the whole time, and Dean was pretty sure he’d be content. It was a good thing he wasn’t in charge then, because upon having a general direction, Cas was pulling him away from the door and towards the bedroom. Strong arms gripped under his thighs tight, inching slowly towards his ass. But at the moment, Dean did not give one single fuck. Wrapping his arms tight around Cas’s neck to try to keep Cas’s lips, and crossing his ankles where they hung around his hips, Dean let himself be carried. Thank god, he’d left his bedroom door open, because the next thing he felt was Cas none too gently depositing him onto the bed in a heap.
inside of him again, and his eyes fucking shoot open. Quickly slipping out of Cas’s loose hold, he sits up, no longer feeling tired in the slightest, and looks down at his little bump incredulously.
“Issues as in, they’re not working” he deadpanned. “I’m feeling ass-backwards, dude. Moods, weight, all up and down.”
He backs away from her touch, instinctively drawing himself back into Cas, who doesn’t hesitate to wrap his arms around him again. He feels so
is making him feel safe and protected. Not the tub. It’s Cas that wraps his arms around him, he’s not forced to do it himself the way he’s learned to do when he’s alone and finds himself in the tub.
He could clearly see his dad’s face right before he drew his arm back for the hit; starting the spectrum of emotions at guilty, then surprised, then fucking
“I see how it is,” Benny chuckles, eyes shifting from Dean back to the road again. “Good thing I don’t really need you to hold a conversation. I kinda like the sound of my own voice, don’t you?”
Once he’s regained his balance, and he’s sure his knee is clear of anyone’s special bits, he steals the pillow out from underneath Cas’s arm before he stretches out along Cas’s body until his head is cushioned on Cas’s shoulder, and he’s clinging greedily to the man’s body heat.
Cas reaches over to cradle Dean’s face with both palms. “Call me if you can’t sleep. I mean it. Any time, and I will be there.”
Closing his eyes and leaning his head back against the mirror, he listens as Cas looks through his medical supplies underneath the sink. He’d shown Cas where it was when Dean had cut his finger at work a few days ago and Cas had insisted on treating it properly to avoid infection. Such a fucking doctor, he thinks fondly, smiling to himself.
Pulling away and pressing his forehead against Dean’s, Cas sighs softly when he notices their scents have returned to normal. He’s not surprised when a moment later, Dean presses his face into his neck, scenting him, and nuzzling into his space.
Cas has a hard look on his face, not really looking at Dean, so instead of asking him where they are, he leans forward to see the name on the building in front of him.
“Nothing,” he puffs. “After a separation this far into your pregnancy, it’s going to take your body a little while to get back on track. It’s normal,” Cas reassures.
I think what keeps fucking me up time wise is that in my head I'm trying to cram too much into one chapter, and it intimidates me to keep putting it off and putting it off. This chapter was supposed to be longer, but I'd figured y'all had waited long enough. See end of chapter notes though!
“His nightmares exacerbate his morning sickness?” another voice that is not Cas’ whispers just as quietly.
The stretch burns a little- which is normal since it’s a little too soon- but he isn’t lying when he says it feels good. Sometimes he likes a little pain with the pleasure, a fact Cas is well aware of.
“Oh god, Dean,” Cas is whispering over and over, while Dean sobs out a litany of, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
God, he was an asshole, Dean thinks to himself. He can tell how badly Cas is trying not to get his hopes up, thinking Dean will change his mind once he’d gotten some sleep and gotten over John’s attack. All those times he’d carefully shot Cas down when he alluded to their situation was now coming back to bite him in the ass. He wasn’t stupid, he knew how badly Cas wanted this, just as Cas wasn’t stupid either; he knew how much Dean
“We can do it,” he says again, this time more seriously, “But we cannot continue like we have in the past, Dean. You can’t. You know what I’m talking about. It has to change Dean.”
tell me you couldn’t talk? I don’t understand!” Sam says in frustration, confusion level going even further through the roof as the man behind Dean takes a step forward to place his hands on Dean’s waist, and Dean
“Hey, hey, hey,” he warns, taking a step forward. “None of that. Picture. I already showered today. You had your fun this morning.”
Which Dean very maturely responds to by sticking his tongue out, causing both Sam and Jess to laugh before they head for the automatic doors of the airport.
. Who knew being mates would make you so sappy,” he laughs, playfully pushing away Cas’s face. “Could you tone it down a bit, I’m trying to keep what’s left of my shredded dignity.”
“That explains a lot,” Cas says. “But if you are Batman, then what does that mean for the pup and I?” Cas teases, and Dean can still hear the smile in his voice.
He feels like he’s about to throw up again when he comes to the swift realization that he’d been dreaming.
A look of abject relief transforms Cas, and he suddenly looks ten years younger as he smiles back at Dean.
The next few weeks fly by in a torrent of self- loathing and denial. And alcohol. Lots and lots of alcohol.
“Too much,” he rasps as an explanation when Cas looks like he’s about to ignore Dean and get right back to it. At Dean’s words, Cas smirks and gets into position so that he’s kneeling behind him, rubbing up and down Dean’s back softly while kissing his back.
He’s shaking all over at this point. Closing his eyes, he clings desperately to the rings, counting them in his head and realizing that Cas has
“What do you think, ya idjit? I threw his keys into the farthest bush I could find and told him to take a hike.”
“Dean,” Cas says softly, nostrils flaring as he tries desperately not to be overwhelmed by the scent of sex and
Cas’s fingers weave through his hair, but he doesn’t comment when hot tears start to slowly slide down Dean’s cheeks and onto Cas’s neck.
It’s not like he was a recluse or anything, but since he’d met Cas and everything with the pup had gone down, he tended to cling to the comfort of his own space. He’d only gone out in public that one time when Cas had taken him to the store, and that had been a freak’in disaster. He was in no hurry to repeat the process, or have something worse happen. There really was no telling how people would react to him, so why risk it?
Dean tries to fight his grin at first, but he breaks when Cas fucking kisses his ear. Wrapping his arms around Cas’s neck, he lets the crazy Alpha kiss wherever he wants to, only letting go when Cas starts to kiss down his body-knowing where Cas will inevitably end up.
“What’s the harm in trying, Dean?” Cas murmurs, leaning towards him so that his words tickle Dean’s ear a little. “If you don’t like anything we can try again somewhere else. But in order for you not to like something, you’ll have to go inside and see for yourself.”
He doesn’t wait for Sam’s answer, doesn’t wait to think about what he’s doing or what this means before he’s spinning around to face Cas, angling himself in front of him, putting himself between Cas and Sam, before taking Cas’s face in his hands.
“Cas, come on, you can’t go all Alpha on me and then leave me hanging. It’s like a goddamn slip-in-slide down there.”
He gravitates towards the jean material he can see on the top shelf right in front of him. Cas is silent at his shoulder, watching him as he reaches for a pair and unfolds it to hold them up.
“Hey watch where you’re-,” the guy starts to spit at Cas, but stops mid-sentence when his eyes fall on Dean. He backtracks, hands held up in front of him, looking genuinely apologetic now and looking between Dean and Cas. “Oh shit- I am so sorry.”
Cas waits until both of them are ready before tossing them individually. But of course, he has to walk over every single package with Dean’s name it.
“M’okay. Miss you,” Dean mumbles, fighting against his pride and his burning cheeks to get the words out.
Instead of being disappointed, Dean was actually pretty relieved. It must have shown on his face, because the young doctor went from being concerned and unsure of himself, to standing straight with a little swagger in his posture.
“Who is this man, Dean?” Cas grits out, finally catching his breath, and trying to maintain eye contact with Dean. He still has John pinned to the ground, but at least he’s keeping his hands to himself for the time being.
Rolling his eyes, almost surprised to find that there weren’t any hearts next to his name or something gross like that, he presses his name and is relieved to hear the distinct sound of his phone vibrating from underneath his nightstand.
“I’ll see you,” Cas kisses each word into his skin, giving him the strength he needs to get his shit together and get going.
cuddling- he thinks as he tucks himself into Cas’s neck, scenting him groggily as Cas mumbles unintelligibly in response.
for a son anymore, especially one who lets someone else use them as a bitch! I’ve tried everything I could to keep this from happening, but you’ve dug your own grave, Dean.”
Stroking a hand through Dean’s damp hair, he lets the silence blanket them as he listens to Dean’s breathing, soft now that a few minutes have passed.
Sleepily blinking his eyes, confused as to where the fuck he is for a second, Cas comes into focus- staring at him with a soft look on his face that immediately has him straightening up and stretching groggily.
God knows he usually wasn’t, as he’d scheduled himself at work as late as he could, but today was different.
Was that spinach he was eating? There was definitely something green stuck in with all the noodles along with little pieces of chicken, but whatever it was, at least it didn’t detract anything from cheesy overload his mouth was currently enjoying.
He wants to be angry, wants to yell and scream and blame Bobby for what happened with his father, but now that he’s here, he can’t find it within himself to do it. When it really comes down to it, this whole situation was his own fault. He let it get to this point.
You are perfect in every way, and I pity the people who can’t see that. Don’t you know that you are my favorite person?”
There’s a moment of tense silence, both of them right on the edge of saying something, but then Cas sighs and starts to turn for the kitchen.
“I know you’d rather run away from our problems instead of fixing things,” Cas retorts. He still looks winded, like Dean had physically punched him in the gut with his comment. But there’s desperation in his eyes now, and Dean knows what’s coming next before the words come out. “We can choose to fight, Dean.
Alpha, didn’t have any claim over him except this kid inside him, because he was currently fucked up on freaky ass hormones. All he wanted right now was Cas. Every part of him. To scent him, to feel his warmth, to hear his laugh, taste his lips, bite his neck and lick his –
Goddamn he did not see that coming. He was so sure, his mind was so set on having a boy. Now that he knows differently, he feels like he needs to reassess everything, rethink everything. In the beginning he’d been afraid of the idea of having a girl because he’d only grown up and been around boys. The idea of having a girl was so crazy to him, pretty much out of his league and out of his comfort zone in the way of his very narrow life experiences. A baby girl was a completely new concept. He had no clue what he would do if he had a girl.
What he saw was heart breaking. Dean looked so vulnerable and lost, nevermind angry. Yes, only time would tell.
He wants to look away, wants to tuck his head between his knees now that the laughter has completely left his system and the fear is creeping back in, but he suddenly feels himself being hugged within an inch of his life.
“-should I get him a bucket or something?” Sam asks. Dean missed the first part of the sentence, but he’s embarrassed enough about the second part of it that he holds a fist over his mouth to clamp it down and shakes his head.
Breathing a sigh of relief that vaguely smells like vanilla and coffee, he focuses on those two heads instead of the multiple pairs of eyes he can feel turned towards him. There’s people in basically all of the seats, there’s even people milling about around the tables; chatting and talking amicably with the patrons. Sam and Jess are towards the back, tucked in a corner, so he ducks his head and starts forward with Cas following close behind him.
Nodding, he turns to find a chair, sitting a polite distance away from a woman wearing a flip flop dress, and a couple looking two seconds away from making out right here and now. It smelled like flowers and disinfectant in here, masking any one’s particular scent. This was worlds away from the clinic, and he was comforted by the other people’s presence, and not that he would admit to it, Missouri’s as well. He thought she was about to reach over the desk and freak’in hug him or something. And he didn’t think he could refuse any kind of comfort right now. He was too raw.
too easy, Dean,” Jess says smugly, reaching over to high-five Sam. “All we have to do is bring up physical or emotional intimacy, and you’re like putty in our hands.”
“Okay,” she whispers back, hugging the three candies to her chest and smiling sweetly at Castiel before rounding on her uncle. “Can we go home now? I wanna show Cody all my candy!”
Cas turns and kisses the fingers still pressed against his cheek, but doesn’t say anything for which Dean is grateful.
“Fuck,” he hisses. His ass is starting to spasm again. Slick is leaking steadily now, just as it had before he’d come. “Shit.”
“God, fuck,” Dean sighs in relief, covering Cas’s fingers with his own. “Thank god. I remember thinking for a second- at the beginning- that this meant I lost it. I couldn’t fucking live with myself…”Dean trails off.
“It’s okay, little Alpha. You’re doing the right thing,” he reassures him gently. There isn’t really anything else he can say. That’s some heavy shit. And of course, Cas
Shaking his head in frustration now that he’s finally calm enough to talk again, he reaches out to grip Cas’s t-shirt in both hands. “No, Cas. It’s not you.”
After they fill out a shit load of paperwork in an office on the opposite side of the hospital from where Cas works, they’re led by a nurse into a dark room with a bunch of intimidating looking medical equipment.
Cas pauses, looking like he’s trying to find the right words, not noticing how hard Dean is hanging on every single one of them now.
Something dislodges in his chest as he says it though. It had been weighing on him for years and years just waiting to be spoken. It’s actually a relief to have said it out loud, to have someone else know the burden that he’s been carrying around on his shoulders. To know the hate he holds for a huge piece of himself.
He feels so dirty. Exposed. But getting up and doing something about it feels next to impossible. Digging his fingers into his upper arms as another wave approaches, he rolls over onto his back mindlessly, hissing in shock when his mistake has his hole clenching hard at the contact. Closing his eyes again, he feels heavy and uncoordinated as he somehow rolls himself onto his side again, eyes drooping in exhaustion.
Gabriel lets out a low whistle as he looks back and forth between the two of them. “My, my, my. Well, I have to tell you Dean, you are
“You’ll probably notice an increase in activity once you’re fed and feeling better. Since I’m already holding you, did you just want to come with me?” Cas looks down at him, probably trying to gage all the emotions going on beneath the surface. “I can get you set up on the couch.”
This time when he wakes up nice and warm with arms wrapped around him, he doesn’t freak out. Only the position those arms have taken cause him alarm this time. Cas’s arms, which had been at his own sides when they’d fallen asleep, were now firmly tugging him closer from behind.
But it wasn’t stopping he realized in a panic, his eyes snapping open, and his breath coming out in a gasp.
“Help me? By what? Taking off my clothes again? Yeah no thanks, I remember how that ended.” Dean scoffs, trying to stand up but swaying, coming dangerously close to losing his balance and falling.
“Dean,” Cas sighs, kissing Dean’s clammy forehead. “We’ll have to agree to disagree on that one. You’re always beautiful.”
Dean tilts his head back, breathing hard, a soft moan leaving his lips when Cas sucks what will undoubtedly be an impressive hickey. He lets him, revels in it even; the idea of Cas marking leaving a mark on him. It’s weirdly erotic, and as soon as Cas lessens the pressure to softer brush of lips on the mark, Dean is scrabbling for purchase on any part of Cas that he can use in order to reattach their lips.
Cas grabs his chin then and angles him down so he’s able to kiss him solidly. “Of course. We’re a package deal.”
Taking a deep breath- and yes, he could smell another wave quickly approaching- he leans in to mouth at Dean’s neck; tasting salt and sweat and heat and
“Don’t go getting ideas, baby girl. Me and your daddy are gonna be the only men in your life until you’re 35,” he murmurs, then reconsiders. “Actually, make it 40.”
When he is where Cas wants him, he has Dean turn around, pulling his legs to his chest facing away from him. He closes his eyes before Cas can tell him to, catching Cas’s scent and trying to hold on to it as he tenses, waiting for the other man’s touch.
He doesn’t care that Cas is fully clothed while he’s completely naked.  He doesn’t care that slick is getting absolutely everywhere. He doesn’t care about Cas mouthing hungrily at his bared throat. All he cares about is the hard, thick cock he can feel directly pressed against his hole.
“I told you, I’m going to give you a massage. Our close proximity should allow you to scent me as well.”
handle things on my own, and I don’t need you telling me what I do or don’t need. And I for sure don’t need you taking care of me, dude. I’m not fucking helpless!”
Looking down again, Dean presses his face and nose into Castiel’s neck once more. “For you know…uh not knotting me?” Dean says, an awkward hitch to his voice.
“CAS!” he shouts, ass clenching around his thick length, and continuing to ride back into Cas’s thrusts as Cas finds completion inside him at the same time, coming with a hoarse groan.
“Did you really think I wouldn’t notice how scared you were when I told you I love you?” Cas whispers.
He thinks he nods but his whole body is still shaking so he’s not too sure. Apparently there was no off switch after he gets going. He is very tempted to roll his eyes at himself.
But Benny assumed he’d just slept with an omega, thinking his scent was left over from a  female one. His scent must have been muddled enough to give off hints, but not his full blown butterfly shit scent. There was a God. He’d just been given his cover on a silver fucking platter.
Dean closes his eyes and leans forward to press his forehead to Castiel’s shoulder. He must have lost his shirt sometime in the fray, because Dean’s skin feels blistering against his own. They’re on their sides facing each other, sheet pulled up to Dean’s stomach, sharing each other’s warmth and breathing each other’s air. He can feel the little push and pull of air against his shoulder as Dean scents him again.
Not that he thought that his stupid pants splitting as that big of a deal, it was just weird that Cas hadn’t thrown a hissy fit like he normally would. The man was completely over protective and over bearing at times, more stressed about keeping him and the pup safe than he was most of the time.
“Keep telling yourself that princess,” Benny stands up and heads for his own work station, turning to wink at Dean over his shoulder, “Maybe that’ll make it more true.”
Finally managing to get to his feet, he grabs Cas by the hair and crashes his lips to his own, moaning and thinking fucking
It’s not like it really matters- there’s nothing he can do about it now with how big he is- but he still feels a little nervous walking up the three little steps and through the door Cas holds open for him. It’s a small place, just a mom n’ pop joint really, so it’s not that hard to spot a very familiar mop head sitting with a head of blonde curls.
“I want to see you again in a month, Dean, and when I do I want nothing but a sparkling report. A clean sheet, okay?” Anna asks, reaching over to pats Dean’s hand.
“You like when I talk though,” he says breathily when they part for air. He let’s his hands smooth down Cas’s toned back until he has a solid handful of Cas’s ass in both hands. “Don’t you? Especially in bed.”
Throwing his head back in laughter at Dean’s choice of words, Cas’ hands leave Dean’s thighs in favor of running his fingers over Dean’s belly.
“Move in with me, Dean,” Cas repeats fervently. “I want you here everyday. I want to wake up to you every morning. I want to start a life with you.”
“It’s okay Dean. I’m not going anywhere. I just want to try something alright?” Castiel says huskily into his neck. Where there had been concern flooding Cas’s scent a few minutes ago, was now replaced with lust.
Smiling and breathing a sigh of relief, he forgets what he was about to say to Cas. Turning to sit down on the bed, he rubs at the spot he felt the kick, making a small circle with the palm of his hand and using his fingers to lightly stoke the skin.
“What… what you are doing, Dean,” Cas hesitates, clearing this throat, “Is anything but weak. Taking yourself out of a dangerous environment in order to protect something precious- something helpless-that’s showing strength beyond measure. And courage, and love. You are doing everything I can’t.”
“In my uhh, professional opinion, you no longer need your suppressants. Your symptoms should go away once the pills are completely out of your system.”
the slurp as Cas comes up for air. It pushes him that much closer to the edge, and he throws his head back into the couch cushions to stave it off. Cas knows exactly what this does to him, and he’s taking advantage of it.
He could make brownies, chocolate-chip cookies, lemon bars, cinnamon swirl muffins, banana bread, or fucking
“ – CAS. Do you ever shut your mouth?” Dean laughs, slapping a hand over Cas’s mouth. He’s immediately rewarded with a wet tongue lathing over his fingers. “Real mature, man.”
Cas didn’t follow. He took a step back, and stared wordlessly down at Dean. He probably made one hell of a sight too, hair all mussed, lips swollen from kissing, eyes wide with excitement and booze. Probably looked like a needy girl, come to think of it. Waiting for the command to bend over and take it, he thought with a grimace. Hell no. Whatever he was, he would not, and could not be that. If Cas knew what he was, he doubted this would be very different.
Even with how huge he is, he still feels like Cas is dwarfing him, wrapped around him and in him. As the seconds and minutes tick by, he starts to think maybe that’s okay. Just when he’s with Cas.
Cas hesitates before opening his eyes again, and leans back completely against the couch so he’s even with Dean, everything from their shoulders to legs firmly pressed against each other; with both of them staring up at the boring white ceiling.
Dean’s fingers never relax their grip on Castiel’s back though, and he’s certain there will be half-moon crescents tattooed into his skin for days to come. It seems only fair as he remembers the hickies he’d undoubtedly left on Dean’s neck when he’d lost control of himself for a few minutes in the very beginning.
“Please. Don’t,” Cas begs. “Don’t say that. I want him to stay like I need my next breath, but Dean has to be able to make his own choices. It’s what he’s fought for for so long, and what he’s so afraid of losing. We’ve had multiple discussions about this very topic. It would be wrong of me to try and force him into staying.”
“A couple weeks?” Dean tries to think back, but so much has happened since that it’s mostly a blur. Especially in the beginning. That shit was dark. “I was having some
Reluctantly walking over to the crinkled paper covered table, he sat down wishing he could run in the opposite direction of this whole stupid situation. Or take out his still broiling anger on something.
“Well it is. No funny business until after the cup. One quick fuck for good luck, then we gotta get our heads in the came, capisce?” Dean pushes Cas’s head back until he can see his eyes.
Instead of complaining like he knows Cas expects him to do when he’s done, he pulls Cas close and wraps his arms around his back, nuzzling into him so that can get a whiff of that scent. With the pup pressed against Cas, and Cas’s hand moving through his hair, he can’t make himself feel anything other than gratefulness and a cautious contentment.
For coming into his life and shaking him to his very foundation. For making him reevaluate his life, and for making him hate himself even more than he’d already had.
“Why not? Any pup can babble ‘mama’ or ‘dada,’ imagine our pup beating all the other pups at their own baby game!”
Cas growls low in his throat at the thought, but Dean pulls back enough to poke him firmly in the chest. “Hey. None of that Mr. Growly pants. You made your point tough guy, but I can handle myself, okay?”
“If you say so,” Dean says, unconvinced. He turns around a little to help Cas with the door, and that’s how he sees it.
“But how do you know for sure though, that its-not- you know?” he asks, desperate to believe Cas’s words, but at the same time remaining unconvinced. Though Cas’s smile does put him at ease some.
wanted to leave the bed. He was fine as long as Cas wasn’t touching him. Dean was done fighting with Castiel. It wasn’t his fault they were in this mess, and it was Dean who needed to make this right.
He makes quick work of gathering as many towels as he can, only slipping twice in the process to the resounding sounds of Dean’s laugh. But to his surprise, instead of trying to mop up all the water, Cas makes a sort of red carpet-esqe kind of deal starting from the side of the tub all the way to the bedroom.
“How long have you been here, Dean?” Cas asks him softly, other hand moving to push Dean’s sweaty hair away from his forehead gently. Dean feels a little warm, but nothing too alarming as to not be contrived from morning sickness.
“Oh. My. God. Hi! Are you Mr. Winchester? You must be Mr. Winchester!”, woah, she was excitable, “I’m Becky! You just have to sign this real quick, and Dr. Shurley will be right with you!” she said, gesturing with a flourish at the clip board with a lone piece of paper in front of her. “Doctor Crowley insists.”
“That’s what I thought. How do you feel about moving our little group to your apartment? That was the original idea, after all,” Cas suggests.
Sam’s face had gone pale, horror and shock dominating every feature on his face, but Dean can’t understand how he’s surprised. John had never really been subtle with the way he’d treated Dean. Sam was intentionally
“Honestly, dad? I don’t give a fuck what you think. And I don’t owe you any kind of explanations,” Dean says simply, “You tell yourself whatever you want to make yourself sleep better at night, but I’m done. Just like you were supposed to be done three months ago, except I mean it. You didn’t want me as a son? Fine. I don’t want or need you as a father.”
“Dean… I’d like… I’d like for you to help pick out which room should be the nursery,” Cas says hoarsely. “And I’d also appreciate your help designing it.”
Snorting loudly and finally turning to catch the tail-end of Cas’s smirk, he shakes his head at himself and laughs under his breath. “I can’t believe I said that.”
Happy Saturday, ya'll. FYI- every single one of you are freaking awesome. Not just for reading this story. I mean in general. You are special, loved, interesting, unique, and cherished. Never let anyone make you think differently.
“What? No, Cas,” Dean says immediately, eyes snapping open again. “This one is all on me. I did this.”
“You do have a point there,” Dean concedes, lifting his arms so that Cas can pull both of them off, one at a time.
Hearing the click-clack of buttons being pushed or typed or whatever, another image takes shape on the screen as Dean watches with dumbfounded eyes.
“Are you sure it’s me stressing him out?” Dean grumbles but relents as he sits and lets Cas push his seat into the table slightly. Cas takes the seat right next to him instead of the chair across from him like before, and he can’t say he’s complaining as he gets a whiff of Cas’s scent. It smells… happy?
He’s thoroughly satisfied when Dean jerks his head back to look up at him with shock written all over his face He holds his face placid for two more seconds before he can’t hold it in anymore. Snorting slightly as his breath hitches in his chest, the silly sound just makes the laughs comes faster now, come harder. Throwing his head back with the impression of Dean’s surprised face behind his eyelids, Castiel laughs harder than he has in a long time.
At the touch though, Dean’s eyes slowly move from the wall in front of him to look at Castiel, without moving his head. It doesn’t look like he’s completely aware of what’s going on. Nothing registering enough for any emotion to flicker in those green eyes. His eyes remain glazed and unfocused, but at least he has his attention.
“Pretty sure it was either the pup kick’in me or my creeper radar goin off,” he says fondly, patting Cas’s head when it automatically pops up at his words.
“You are mine,” he says softly, finding Dean’s fingers and bringing them up to his lips to kiss. “And I am yours.”
Smiling a little, his anger finally melting a little at little Cas, he moves on to the next picture. Cas is much older in this one, probably early twenties, and two men have their arms slung over his shoulders with Cas sandwiched in between. The one on Cas’s left is blonde with strong features, a barely there smile quirking his lip up as he looks down, while the one on the right seems to be in the middle of rolling his eyes. Cas’s eyes are lit up with amusement, mouth slightly open as if in question. And all these reactions seem to be caused by the man on the floor posing as if he was in
That’s not what he needed right now. If he took some time, he’d just be dwelling on shit that didn’t need to be dwelt upon. Is dwelt even a fucking word? He shakes his head- at himself and to Cas’s suggestion.
It’s the first fucking day of November not December, so why was he already frozen solid? Shivering as a breeze picked up around him, he was actually kind of glad for the excuse to hurry along to his car. As much as he wanted to chill with Cas, he didn’t want to come off as too needy.
“Cas,” he says, still semi-quietly, but with no results. “Cas!” louder now, shaking him harder-but the only indication that the man can hear him is an undecipherable grumble.
Cas is dead serious and waiting for his response, so he keeps the cracks about getting him into position to himself. “Okay.”
“You have your own problems to worry about, Sam,” Dean sighs, “I didn’t see the point in bitching about my own.”
And then she was off, and Dean had to find a way through all of these people. It was tuesday for chist’s sake, why was everyone and their mother here?
Trying not to show how afraid he suddenly is, he asks, “Was this before or after we met the first time, Dean?”
But as nice as getting finger fucked is, didn’t he sign up for “hard to walk the next day” kind of sex?
“But this time, what if we,” he hedges pointedly, raising his eyebrows, “Work up a bit of sweat beforehand, hmm? Wake up early, get some cardio in.”
“What now, Cas?” Dean says, with that lost face and eyes again. At least he looks more alert now, after losing the soaked clothing.
His eyes are on Cas this time instead of his hands, so he gets to see the exact moment Cas realizes what’s going on. Face slack in shock, he whispers, “Dean,” like he’s looking for a life-line, unable to look up as his hands twitch beneath Dean’s- desperate to feel something again.
“Back off asshole,” he snaps, turning to glare at the heavy-set man behind him who had not so subtly been staring at his ass. The dude looked like a fucking dad-wearing cargo shorts and a zipped up sports jacket- but from the lust he could smell pouring off the man, he knew he had to be a fucking Alpha.
The water shifts around them quiet and intimate, dripping off their skin, lapping gently against the side of the tub.
