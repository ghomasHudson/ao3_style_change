“Are you always this feisty at night? Wait, don’t answer that.”
“And don’t get me started on how you look once you’re split open on my cock, and taking it all so hard like a damn good soldier. That ass of yours… It’s incredible when it’s bouncing on my cock, taking it so well.”
• War injuries/talk
“What? What’s wrong?”
If there was a word to explain how heart-broken Cas feels right now, he’s not sure it would even be enough.
“Why the hell not?”
is what he doesn’t say.
Weeks pass by, and Cas doesn’t really see them come and go.
“Yeah, I heard that one before,” Dean scoffs.
It’s there that he finds him; lying on the hardwood floor of his bedroom, eyes glued to the ceiling, his breath a steady rhythm in the silence of the apartment.
“Cas,” Dean asks, tensing again because he knows this behavior. It’s Cas right before he goes catatonic. “Cas, look at me.”
Cas sounds offended but quickly whimpers as Dean makes his way to his ear, nuzzling along his jaw.
So he cracks. The monster inside him is spitting only fire and fury; and he lets it.
Balthazar seems a bit shaken up as Cas recalls the story quickly — Dean found him on the floor, called 911, then Jimmy. How Cas went into cardiac arrest and was revived by the paramedics on scene, in front of both his twin brother and his boyfriend. How Jimmy was beside his bed when he woke up, but not Dean.
“It doesn’t,” Dean says softly.
“Okay big guy, don’t push it,” Dean answers, content to watch Cas above him, his eyes going down the length of his body.
Cas shouldn’t look this beautiful right now, so vulnerable that Dean is transported back to 10 years ago;  time spent in this same car not long before he overdosed. A whirlwind of ancient memories comes back to him like waves crashing on a shore and he has to push them back to actually concentrate on what’s in front of him for the time being.
That there’s nowhere else to run, no one else to find, nothing else that really matters. And that maybe it’s just time to face it all. He’s done running for good this time. He’s done wallowing, waiting, wondering. Done being scared, done trying to figure out what’s real and what’s not.
There was nothing for Cas there, except the sweet taste of ecstasy running through his bloodstream.
Cas rolls his eyes. “Fine.”
“I’ll do my best,” Benny laughs as he lets him go. “I kinda like it here. Might come back once I retire.”
He’s standing in the middle of the room, running gear in place, hair fucked sixty ways to Sunday, and
“What?”
Cas’ hand moves higher on Dean’s thigh at that exact moment, making Dean turn his head to lock eyes with him while Sam explains what’s in both cocktails to Jack.
“Dean Winchester, are you really about to turn down a slice of the best apple pie in town?” Charlie asks as she plops down next to Cas.
All this time spent thinking Jimmy had erased Dean from his memory, had thrown away their pictures, effectively erasing him from their collective history- only to find out that they had been talking all this time. And that Jimmy kept them close- all three of them- to his heart, tucked away in a little box underneath his bed.
“I left because I was lost, and because I was hurt, and because I couldn’t see past those two things anymore without wanting to put my head in the sand. And once I was there, I never looked back because looking back would’ve meant hurting myself again.”
He’s asleep when it rings, which is partly why when he finally grabs his phone on the nightstand to answer, his brain doesn’t grasp the dramatic aspect of the situation right away.
“What are you doing here, kid?” Bobby asks, his voice genuine, almost warm.
But Balthazar doesn’t know. No one except Jimmy and a handful of people he doesn’t see anymore knows. It’s something that Cas has tried so hard to bury deep inside his soul. Because talking about it did more harm than good.
“And you didn’t call?”
They’re silent for a little while before Dean breaks it again as they’re closing in on the end of the river track.
Plus he’s right here trying to behave like a normal human being when Dean pushed him away just hours ago. He doesn’t deserve him. Not that this is new or anything, ‘cause he really never deserved Cas and his gentleness and common kindness in the first place.
Cas’ hand slowly follows the line of the wound up to his shoulder and stops there, finally turning his eyes to lock-in with Dean’s.
At that, Cas stirs ever so slightly. Dean waits patiently, his hand weaving through Castiel’s dark hair tenderly, bathing in the scent of him- that goddamn coconut body wash he keeps buying that Dean pretends to hate but secretly loves, the discreet scent of his cologne mixed with a whiff of smell from the hair gel he uses.
“Yeah, huh,” Cas starts almost sheepishly. “It’s my boyfriend’s, actually.”
It’s subtle, this missing you. I’ve never really been able to find the right words to describe how it feels to miss you, but longing from home comes the closest. Not having you next to me feels like every cell in my body yearning to be somewhere else, somewhere that feels like home. And I’m not entirely sure that feeling will ever go away, but maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be. Maybe these bones were built to miss you, and your absence is the price I have to pay for this strength.
“I miss you.”
about it, but he does. He dares to cross eyes with Cas then, losing himself into those baby blues he used to cherish so much staring back for a time.
Green Team — Navy SEALs training team
Dean accelerates his physical therapy, and as a result gets cranky as hell because he’s exhausted half the time. He’s making incredible progress though, and even starts going on light runs with Cas once every week. The first time he completes a run is the very first time Cas sees him smile that way ever since he’s gotten back to Lawrence.
She smiles at him and against all odds, Cas feels warmth spreading timidly across his chest.
For those who missed it on
Tipsy and flirty. God, that’s both a nightmare and a dream.
He doesn’t really remember how long he’s been here, lying on his back on the fluffy carpet Jimmy brought back from Ikea some random afternoon years ago. He always went to Ikea during the most bizarre hours, arguing that it helped him think. Sometimes he’d spend hours looking at kitchens and random furniture just to come back home with an entire paper written on coronary artery disease development. It was maddening.
“You’re perfect,” he whispers instead, tilting his head up to rest against Dean’s stomach, stifling a yawn.
Benny’s voice is a calming balm on every single one of his scars, including the anxiety that crept through his bones after that close call with Cas
It takes him an unhealthy amount of time to finally click the red button and listen to Dean’s voicemail. So unhealthy that it’s already been 2 hours since he’s received it, and he listens to the damn thing while he’s sitting on Balthazar's couch with a beer in hand.
“Benny you’re rambling, it’s 5 am. Get to your point,” Dean interrupts, stifling another yawn.
He tries a second time, and this time it goes straight to Cas’ voice mail, meaning that Cas either turned his phone off- which for a guy who’s this addicted to social media isn’t even a remote possibility- or dismissed Dean’s call as soon as it came in. Which well… Dean can’t exactly be mad at him after all.
• Mentions of past and present drug abuse
about the significance of today until Cas strolled in the kitchen to find him and his friends gathered around the table for breakfast after shift, and his face fell.
, he’s doing it.
It’s a slight tremor of Cas’ hands on his keyboard that gives how he really feels away. His armor slightly falters and for the first time since Dean walked into his office, he finally turns to look at him.
Maybe I’ll never be able to let you go the way I want to, but every new morning is another day I’m willing to try.
“What if I’m not enough?” Dean lets out, and it feels like such a huge thing to finally get off his chest that the breath he takes after that feels huge.
Dean shrugs, which probably makes a funny picture since he’s sprawled on his back right now. Cas brushes a thumb on his forehead before dipping down to place a kiss on his hairline.
Dean smiles sadly, averting his eyes in the mirror. “I don’t know what’s left to say. I mean, look at me — I’m so damaged I’m barely recognizable.”
Cas chuckles. “For real? You’re staying?”
” before heading to the shower. Benny comes back while Cas is still in the shower, Chinese food in hands they eat together on the coffee table while the Great British Bake Off keeps them busy. Dean watches in awe as Benny and Cas bicker over which candidate is the best, enjoying Cas’ weight against him as he presses closer and closer against his side.
Cas smiles. “Of course. And we’re still on for our weekly Sunday calls, right?”
“I can’t tell you why he did what he did, because I don’t
“No,” Cas says with a smile.
“What is it?” he asks, voice soft and considerate.
is wrong with this car, and honestly at that point
“Cas got run over by a car during his morning run, he’s just been brought up to the ER. Please come as fast as you can.”
Dean and him. They’re here together, and that’s got to mean something.
Dean still stood there all along. He had lost his mom a few months prior to meeting the Novak brothers, and from the top of his 10 years was trying really hard to pretend like life at home was all rainbows and butterflies. Until Cas and Jimmy had finally crossed the threshold of the 10th of Westdale Road and saw first-hand what a disaster John Winchester had made out of his two sons’ life. Dean had been more of a father to Sam than John ever had, handling everything at home while his father spent his time in between bars and hungover on the couch. He hadn’t been dealt a better hand than the Novaks, really.
There’s something unfurling in Cas’ guts, spreading warmth in his chest as he readjusts his position in Dean’s arms and brushes a barely-there kiss into the V-shape of Dean’s neck. He takes the time to let it wash over him, breathes the scent of him — mint shampoo, a faint hint of leather and motor oil, and Cas’ coconut body wash that he used in the shower last night before coming to bed.
“Yeah.”
“Nothing. The usual shit,” Cas says, slightly out of breath as they finally make it into the room. “Jim, it’s nothing unusual.”
To navigate this chapter correctly, here's a timeline and the timestamps:
“What? You can tell me, Dean.”
Dean draws back to look at him with a smile and Cas brings a hand to his face, pushing his hair back from where it’s falling on his forehead tenderly. He needs a haircut, but Cas is not the one who’s going to suggest it yet. He looks more carefree with his hair slightly longer than usual, and Cas can’t even begin to explain how
Dean smiles at him, tears still running down his face and Cas resists the urge to reach out, to touch, to offer comfort. He
But she just nods while taking the money he’s handing her, an easy smile on her face. “That was a no-brainer. I miss him too. He’d swing by every couple of days, hit on a different girl every single time.”
He stops again, his voice shallow. It’s hard for Cas not to say anything, not to tell him that he’s right here, waiting for him to accept his help. That he’s not going anywhere. But he has to listen first, otherwise Dean might not open up again.
Dean saying Cas deserves better. Dean pushing him away even though his entire body seemed to crave his touch. Dean’s sad smile whenever anyone mentioned Jimmy. Dean’s over-the-top self-loathing.
“What stuff?”
I’m so sorry that it took me so long to come clean. I wish I had done it sooner. I wish it didn’t take you almost getting blown to pieces for me to realize what matters. You always were a better friend than I ever was, and I hope you can find it in yourself to forgive me. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow. But someday.
Right there, amongst the ruins of what they once used to be, stands the man he fell in love with all those years ago.
Dean laughs, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend and taking him in for a hug. From the other side of the room he sees both Sam and Balt looking at them and takes this opportunity to mouth “
Jess’ voice chimes in from the doorstep, “Well, that’s for me to decide.”
Even after Jimmy fucked him up, broke his heart, broke his life, Dean still loved him through every line inked on paper. Through every desperate attempt at healing, through every swipe of fingers of every one night stand, through every tear and every laugh.
The scene could almost look normal, if a pile of all the kitchenware that got broken last night wasn’t sitting on the table and if Cas’ hands weren’t covered with cuts.
“Come on, Cas, I promise it’ll taste better with Gouda than any other cheese we’ve ever gotten,” Dean pleads, an apron already tied around his waist and a dash of flour sprinkled inside his hair.
Cas smiles slightly. “Fine. The usual.”
“Nah,” Dean chuckles. “You’re there for work, it’s important, I know it is. I’m just saying, I never thought I’d turn into this needy motherfucker at any point.”
And it doesn’t even matter, because this is
Are your hearts still complete? Feel free to yell at me (or cry) into the comment section and/or on
There’s not a strong enough word in the English language to express how relieved Castiel feels after reading Dean’s text. There’s a smile on his face for the first time of the day, and he thinks that maybe in the end, they’re going to be okay.
At that, Jimmy puts both of his hands on his face again, shame burning as the tears roll down his face. Charlie keeps going, oblivious to Jimmy breaking down.
“Okay.”
He drags his exhausted body through the corridor and finds Cas back in bed, lying in fetal position, his blue eyes staring in the distance.
“I wanted to talk to you, you know?” Dean says, taking the glass to his lips. “Every day during training, after my first OP, or during my first deployment… every time, I thought of you and how badly I wanted to talk to you.”
• references to war and PTSD
Cas keeps scrolling, forcing himself not to react when Dean’s arm wraps around his middle and holds him tightly, his whole body pressed against him.
Anxiety starts rising then, and no amount of hot water or perfect coffee from Jess seem to even slightly tone it down. Even Charlie flying into his arms like a high schooler when they pick her up in front of her newly opened coffee/record shop doesn’t manage to calm his nerves down.
Dean can feel Charlie’s gaze on him as he answers, heavy and thoughtful.
It sends Dean into another wave of hysterical laughter, until it suddenly drops on his stomach and his mood makes a 360. When he answers Cas, he can almost feel the crack going from his mouth all the way down his toes.
It’s a full (exhausting) day later when they’re sitting on the floor of their new living room, remnants of the take-out dinner they’ve just had, that Dean decides to ask something that’s been burning his tongue for several weeks.
He sent a few texts which Dean never responded to, only fueling his despair about the whole thing. And now it’s late at night and Dean’s still not here, and Cas still has no idea where he’s gone. For all he knows he might have fucked off all the way back to Virginia already, and he hates how that makes him feel.
“Alright,” Dean smiles. “It was nice to see you, Cas.”
😬)... I can't wait to see how you react!
, it’s a miracle that Dean manages not to come on the spot. Instead he smirks at his boyfriend and steals one last kiss from his lips before sinking to his knees.
“Does that mean you’re retiring?” Sam finally asks, tearing his eyes away from Dean to look at Benny.
“I really was actually, at first. Then DEVGRU hit me with this,” he says, slipping his hand into his jacket’s inner pocket and taking out a white envelope, the seal of the US Navy visible where it’s printed in blue. “And I didn’t want anyone else to come out here and deliver this.”
He had it good, really. He loved his teammates, loved his job, loved the sense of clarity and purpose it gave him. It kept him busy enough so that he didn’t really have to care for any other aspect of his life. Sammy was safe and cared for, and no one was waiting for him back home.
Cas smirks into his cup, his hand still tracing patterns on Dean’s thigh, probably unaware that the simple gesture is currently turning Dean into a hot babbling mess. Well, scratch that. Judging by the knowing smile on his face, his boyfriend knows
“What?” he whispers carefully.
Nothing less, nothing more. Castiel doesn’t know where this lead and he doesn’t really care, as long as Dean stays by his side no matter what.
“I love you.”
“You know it’s stupid,” Sam sighs, dropping on the couch next to his brother, “you could’ve stayed here. We’ve got room for you.”
There was a time when my whole world existed beneath your skin; when everything began and ended beneath the weight of your touch. I still think about where you might be now, and if you ever found a way to stop the oceans in your chest from claiming every ship that made it close to you.
“Yeah. Told me about your latest shenanigans with Rufus. Or about the time he had to take you out of the Roadhouse because Ellen was threatening to carve your eyes out.”
“It’s fine, I’m just glad you’re here,” Dean interrupts him softly.
“Ah! Mr. Winchester, I assume?” says the tall blond standing before him, smug British accent thick as ever, a smile on his lips.
It’s blatantly insane, the way Dean can make Cas’ mind go blank whenever he’s got his mouth on his cock, the heat around him almost rendered unbearable. The way he makes Cas’ body arch into every swipe of fingers, every touch of tongue and lips on skin. With every swipe of tongue down the length of his cock, Cas’ skin burns, his nerves sparks, his fingers on Dean’s shoulder harden and leave a trail as they drag down the expense of his back.
“What was that for?” Cas smiles against his lips afterward, a hand wrapped around his cup of tea while the other goes to Dean’s thigh. “Did I forget my birthday or something?
Dean tries not to melt, to stay stiff in between Cas’ arms but knowing he won’t get to do this until six months later, it’s proven a little bit more difficult than usual. He breathes the scent of him — sandalwood and honeysuckle shampoo, the discreet scent of his cologne, the laundry softener that the Novak have been using forever.
Sam’s cocks an eyebrow at him, looking more surprised than ever, while Dean grabs Castiel’s favorite cup (the one Jack brought back for him the last time he came back, that says
“I don’t know how you keep convincing yourself that everyone hates you for leaving.”
Two hands linked together by their pinky fingers.
“J-bad, I’m in J-bad,” Dean says, out of breath, “We need to find Jamie, we need to —,”
But Cas doesn’t answer as Dean sinks to his knees in front of him. In fact, it’s like he doesn’t even register the whole other person in front of him, his eyes are glued to his phone.
“Dean,” he moans as the other man gently licks and nibbles at his collarbone, leaving faint pink traces along the way. “
It’s the middle of the night but he doesn’t mind. He just got off shift and came home less than an hour ago, and this seemed like a great timing to sneak out of the apartment without Cas noticing.
“Listen why don’t we… I don’t know, go for a walk or something?”
Cas’ lips turn upwards into a slight smile before he adds, “It’s not like you to say no to pie. I don’t recall this happening… ever.”
If anyone points it out to him, Cas will deny the tears that fill his eyes at that.
Cas huffs, defeated. Eyes going back to the ceiling, “You’ll leave me to it tomorrow, then?”
Dean slips out of their bed again, grabbing his jacket to wear over his worn-out Zeppelin tee, and bolts through the bunker’s corridor until he reaches the entrance door. It’s still dark outside but the sky is clear enough to watch the stars and as Dean steps outside, he immediately finds Castiel sitting cross-legged a few steps away from him, lost in his contemplation of the sky.
I really need you to understand that at the time, this seemed like the only way. Cas overdosed and I partially blamed you for it (I blamed myself too, so I felt like I needed to fix what I still could). I was half-convinced you were one of the reasons he was using in the first place. It seemed like you were always the common determinator for when things went shit for him — he started doing drugs not long after you two got together, and you were always right there when he used. It seemed like you never really tried to help, to tell him that this was wrong, that there was so much more out of life than heroin and being as high as a kite every day. I didn’t realize back then that it was unfair to you. That nothing you could’ve done would have prevented Cas from using. He told me that himself, a few weeks after.
you’re doing this because you somewhat, for whatever fucking reason that I don’t fucking get,
“So I ran, and I never once stopped to look back and think. I never once thought that maybe something wasn’t right, and when I think back… for someone who prides himself on being one of the most elite soldiers in the world, this is kinda laughable,” he tries to laugh again but it comes out as a strangled chuckle. “So I lost myself into my training, into work, into everything that could keep me away from any critical thinking. Only because I knew if I ever stopped- I would be dead on my feet.”
It’s not like he didn’t see it coming. Ever since his walk with Dean this morning he’s been on edge. Constantly checking his phone, debating sending a text or not, forgetting to eat because he’s been trying so hard to do his actual job (he’s halfway through that, too. Two articles have been sent and he still has to work on two more). Even when he dragged himself to the shower, thinking moping under the spray would actually do some good was a mistake. The entire shower time was then spent on pondering whether Dean moving in would be a good or a terrible idea.
There it is.
And that’s probably why there’s an alarm going on in his head as Dean goes for another glass of wine.
to art therapy, buddy,” he says with a smile as they both sit down at the table in front of them, covered with art supplies. “I’m going
,” Cas continues as more tears roll down his cheek. “I’m scared about you leaving all the time because of what happened to us. And I know this isn’t right, I know we’ve been working hard on regaining our mutual trust and this isn’t how it’s supposed to be.”
He burrows even closer, nosing into the crook of his neck, gently pushing into the soft skin under his jaw. Dean smiles weakly at him and a single tear rolls down his cheek slowly.
Cas looks more lightweight, less hesitant. Some parts of Dean still hold onto the image of the Castiel that he found bleeding on the floor of his kitchen last night, but he seems better. Stronger.
The simple mention of Jimmy’s name is enough for his face to fall, and he knows for a fact that his British idiot of a friend figured out
But he can’t help but remember the way Cas’ eyes caught his from across the ED. The way he crossed the room only to wrap him in a hug so fierce and warm it knocked out the air that was left inside his lungs. Can’t help but relive the brush of his lips against Cas’ skin, the way his hands found him and anchored him to reality.
He opens the door and his British friend is indeed standing in front of him. He’s dressed unusually conventional, with a pair of jeans and a red flannel instead of his usual black slacks and button-down.
How can Cas even have the sheer strength to love him still, after everything? And why can’t admit it, when it’s all his entire body and soul wants? He wants to be with him, wants to wake up to Cas curled around him. He wants to try being a better person for him, with him. He wants to heal with Cas by his side. Why can’t he do it?
Dean kisses him then, and his lips taste like the cherry cola he’s had right before the appointment.
seems to shut Bobby up. Dean takes a swig of his already lukewarm beer and waits.

“Yeah but you knew,” Cas responds, his voice breaking, tears burning in his eyes as he stubbornly tries to hold them back. “You knew and you didn’t tell me.”
Cas sighs in response, hoping that answers enough. He keeps his gaze on the outside, but his mind wanders elsewhere. Somewhere where Dean would wrap him up in his arms every day, where his soul wouldn’t feel like it had been ripped to pieces.
“I’ll be right back,” he says as he leans back, both of their hands still clasped tightly together.
The story of how they got a cat, however, is wildly different.
“Right, yeah,” Dean stammers as he lets go of Cas and bends down to get a hold of his duffel bag. “Okay. I uh… guess I’ll see you around.”
“My point is, if I ever turn into something like him, you gotta tell me. You gotta talk some sense into me.”
”. They tell you that it’s a natural process, that sometimes it comes from being under intense stress, or being around people that don’t know about your history and won’t know they’re triggering you.
, and his mind freezes.
“Dean, we need t-to talk about —,”
It’s still early when Dean rises that morning, and Cas is surprised to see him wander in the kitchen before the sun is even up.
Dean went to bed before Cas, and when Cas finally joins him after finishing up an article he had due, he’s already sound asleep on his side of the bed. Which isn’t typical of him, but Cas chalks it up on the massive amount of progress he’s been making in therapy and general physical exhaustion. They both have a lot of things going on and Dean’s sleep is still spotty at best. He brushes a kiss on Dean’s forehead tenderly, making sure not to wake him up, and presses his chest against Dean's back before falling asleep, content and safe.
“I don’t care. ‘Cause guess what? You don’t get to have an opinion here,” Dean answers, voice heavy with contempt as he slowly walks toward the kitchen counter and leans on it. “You don’t get a vote. It’s
Well, this is a new development. He didn’t expect Cas to pick this up immediately, but it’s a breach he can exploit.
“Big plans.”
“You have one of these fancy beers around? Or are we gonna do that on your porch?”
Happy New Year, Cas. I hope you’re doing good. I miss you every step of the way, in every corner of my sad little life. I hang onto your memory like a prayer on a Bible.
“I don’t know. I’m thinking about it. I’m weighing every option, as you’d say.”
He shakes his head, scoffs, tries to regain his composure — and fail, absolutely miserably.
), and first dance (“If your first dance isn’t either Etta James’ “At Last” or “Can’t Help Falling in Love” by Elvis, you’re doing it
. Cas thinks to himself, bracing himself for a true Winchester interrogation as he raises up to his feet and comes to sit on a stool on the other side of the kitchen island.
“We didn’t really use this room unless Jimmy came home wasted and couldn’t find his way to his own room.”
It takes a moment before Dean stops squirming, before his breath starts settling down, and before he stops shuddering. Cas doesn’t let go, keeps brushing a thumb on Dean’s cheek, letting his other hand card through the mess of his hair after a while.
“Not now,” she mouths at him. “Later.”
for this morning and now it’s all gone down the drain.
“Promise I’m not taking you skydiving or doing some dumb shit. Alright? Now go get ready.”
Cas can’t help but shiver slightly, and immediately regrets it when he can feel the curve of a smile against his shoulder where Dean presses another kiss.
“Okay, okay. I’m just saying, this isn’t
“See I knew there was one last mic drop to be made,” Balthazar chuckles. “What?!” he whines as Cas punches his shoulder.
color one, Cas!”) and then wanders around for the rest of the day either at home with a book or a good tv show, or in town running errands for Charlie. Sometimes he stays at the café and pretends he’s still searching for a job and an apartment, but he’s really just there to spend time with Charlie or Sam when he’s on a break. Or even Jess when she gets some time off.
Yet, Dean decides right here and there that his very own personal hellscape is Salina’s Target on the 23rd of December, filled with freaked out parents doing their last-minute Christmas shopping and kids running around chasing each other over the whole store like they're owning the goddamn gigantic place.
The nurse that escorted him closes the door behind him and Jimmy stares at his brother lying in bed.
A beat, and then-
“Cas. Are we gonna talk about how it was, seeing him there?”
And he has no fucking idea what to do with himself.
“I love you,” Cas murmurs, overwhelmed. “I’m not gonna go away again.”
Cas explains,
he whispers.
Dean laughs against Cas’ lips, pulling him down into bed with him and already reaching out to get this stupid running pants off of him. Cas seems content to stay right where he is on top of him, making a mess of Dean’s lips and moaning sweetly into his mouth.
“Go ahead,” he pants, giving the head of Cas’ cock kitten licks, his hands working fast on both Cas’ and his own cock. “Come on babe, give it to me.”
Cas looks at him like he’s seeing a ghost.
That none of this is fucking real. That no one ever stays for him, and that one day it
It’s always like this in the light of day, whatever happens between the two of them. The silent guilt into his guts, the question mark written in golden letters inside his inner forehead. They’re slow dancing in a burning room, and it’s only a matter of time before the room collapses.
And then, barely a whisper as he presses one last kiss against Dean’s mouth. Tenderly, lovingly.
“We’ll be fine, Dean,” he whispers slowly, gently, one of his hands running soothing circles over the fabric of the flannel Dean’s wearing.
I told myself that it was an act of letting go, but the fact of the matter is, I think it was more about denying that I’d lost you. You’re not gone, you didn’t leave, I let you go because I wasn’t brave enough to actually try and stay- to heal and find out who we were, without our monsters circling close around.
“I don’t either,” Cas smiles sadly. “But I think it’s for the best until you- I don’t know, clear your head, make a decision or whatever. I don’t want to stand in your way.”
Dean knows Cas hurts. He knows he’s being unfair because of how much reading the letter shattered him. But that simple sentence thrown into his head when he’s trying so hard to do the right thing just breaks his heart even further.
“Okay. You’d tell me though? If something was happening?”
when he can just voice his concern while being pressed up against him postcoital.
Charlie smiles at him, handing him a box and his to-go cup, and Castiel wonders if he might be making a mistake by mentioning seeing her at the funeral. Seeing as she was literally clinging to Dean’s hand the whole time.
“Dean-” Bobby sighs and suddenly his hands are on Dean’s shoulders.
She has her notebook balanced on one knee, her pen tapping lately against the page. She’s looking at him intensely, her gaze encouraging on him.
Dean gets them cleaned up before climbing back into bed and wrapping himself tightly around Cas, placing a series of kisses on the line of his shoulder before sighing in content as they both bathe in their post-orgasm afterglow.
It takes his phone buzzing repeatedly for Cas to finally snap back into consciousness, and even then he’s not sure his soul is still in his body. He promptly dismisses Dean’s call and reads the last part of the letter he’s been holding for the past 5 minutes.
Benny turns to lock eyes with him, his gaze steady, and Dean instantly knows he’s in fact pretty damn serious.
more than half a plate. You think I don’t notice the circles growing darker under your eyes, or how your shirts are starting to look too wide for you? You drink twelve coffees a day, and you pretend that it’s because you’re addicted to caffeine but it’s really because you don’t sleep the amount of time you pretend to. And if you think I don’t pay attention to the empty bottles that started pilling up the
When Cas lies back on top of him and finds his lips again, whimpering sweet nothing into his mouth, Dean feels like he’s going to explode.
Sam seems to find his voice again after a minute of staring in disbelief at the coffee table as if it could talk. “
“What?” Dean asks, trying really hard to pretend like his heart is not beating at the same rate as a race car right now.
“I swear to God if you tell me you’re not pushing people away I will ask Captain Lindberg to get me to Kansas and I will kick your ass myself, Winchester.”
“If you had left.”
I'm not sure you exist anymore. What I mean is, I've been putting you back together from fragments of memories, moments, torn photographs. The version of you I hold in my head isn't real, and I'm in love with the ghost of your hands in mine.
“Talk to me,” Jimmy begs slowly, a desperate attempt at trying to tear his brother away from his silence.
He knows it’s only coming from a place of shitty self-esteem and fear, that Dean has no intention of taking Cas away from him. But being 4-month free of 16 years of a very shitty life doesn’t erase the trauma that goes along with it, especially when you’ve spent that entire time trying to keep your brother safe. Everyone used to be the enemy. Jimmy loves Dean, but he’s having more and more trouble figuring out if he’s a friend or an enemy when it comes to Cas’ drug use.
“Okay, then.”
That said, I
It takes Dean 5 more minutes to move after Castiel has turned into a blurry point in the distance. He crosses the airport the other way, back to his car, his heart in his throat.
I did however add
It doesn’t matter that they’re at odds ever since what happened after the party. It doesn’t matter that Cas is mad at him. It doesn’t matter that he feels like shit for still loving him after everything. What matters is that Dean finally stops crying, that he opens his eyes to stare at Cas and feel
3, 4, 5. March 11, 2010
And I know it’s got nothing to do with the place, and everything to do with how I’m haunted by the memories of us. You’re still here because I can’t help but carry you with me. You’re always here, in the back of my throat, your name carved into my bones. You have not been gone since the day I left.
Castiel grabs his denim jacket from one of the chairs before retrieving his wallet from the counter.
They don’t talk about what happened with Cas, though Dean highly suspects that she knows part of it. She doesn’t ask, and Dean doesn’t tell. He doesn’t have the heart to, and he’s pouring enough of it to his therapist anyway.
At that point, even in the haze he’d been in for hours, Cas knew his friend was just worried about him and didn’t find it in him to argue. He took the prescription from the doc, let Balt handle the pharmacy run, and shoved the paper bag as far as possible both inside his mind and onto the fruit basket on the living room table.
Dean’s silent for a second too long and Castiel is about to add something when he finally moves his eyes to lock in with Cas in the mirror. The smile that appears on his lips feels so sad that Cas immediately wants to tear his own heart out.
“He said I’d end up in hell, and then he called me a stupid little fag,” Cas finally says as he looks down, his voice so low that Jimmy has trouble hearing exactly what he said at first. “You know, nothing new. At least this time he didn’t try to force me into going to Church to “
“I removed the bandages because I wanted to take a shower but it looks fine to stay that way, I think.”
best sniper his country had known, that feels like a win.
He raises his eyebrow at that, remembering it all, a smirk tugging at the corner of his mouth.
“Thank you for taking care of him for 10 years when I couldn’t.”
Sometimes, when the quiet creeps along my bones, I find myself wondering if I could have done more, if all of it was my fault. Maybe I could have held you closer, or done more to fight the monsters that tortured your sleep.
Mary had complained. Sam had nodded as he watched him leave, keys in hands. And now there Dean is, standing once again in the arrival hall, tear tracks on his cheek, waiting for Cas to arrive. Because if there’s one thing John Winchester isn’t going to take away from his son even in death, it’s the tradition of him picking up Cas from the airport every time he comes back.
“What?” he asks, slightly perplexed.
Dean weaves a hand through Cas’ hair, brushes a kiss on the top of his head and waits for the storm to pass as he cradles Cas into his arms.
Charlie cocks an eyebrow at him, and it’s obvious that she doesn’t understand where her best friend is going with this. Dean clears his throat, straightens his back before picking up again.
It’s not like they actually
It’s not a lie, he would. But it’s not like he has a choice.
“Alright. We should probably get ready. The funeral is in less than 2 hours, and we all need a shower,” she says as she gets off the couch and starts unpacking her bag.
Dean stirs up in bed and immediately tenses up at the utter silence bathing the entire condo into an eerie doom and gloom. Call it a sixth sense or some sort of lucky coincidence, but a little voice in the back of his mind is telling him there’s something wrong with the calm surrounding him, and his heartbeat instantly picks up.
Out of the two of them, the party planner had always been Jimmy, so it’s not like Castiel had any relevant experience. Fortunately for him, both Dean and Charlie stepped up and had spent most of the day running around town to do a food run, and then making a mess of the kitchen with loud giggles and a warm atmosphere that made Cas think that things were okay, at least for a little while. Dean has been nothing but rainbows and sunshine ever since his talk with Bobby, which is also a plus.
“You didn’t tell me he still calls you sweetheart!”
“Are you gonna be okay today?” Cas asks again, fearing Dean’s answer.
“And don’t go fishing around for info either. Especially
But there’s also a part of him that knows that staying will just hurt as much. That Dean doesn’t want whatever’s left between the two of them. That the pieces which got crushed over the past 10 years are past saving.
The former angel smiles at him, Delilah waving at her uncle from where she sits on his shoulder, and Dean suddenly feel a rush of emotions coursing through his veins.
He forgets sometimes, how silent Lawrence is at night. He’s been so used to living in a constant buzz, always surrounded by sound wherever he went that silence has become an anomaly.
The moon is full and bathes Castiel’s face in a dull light, his dark hair sticking six ways from Sunday, the edges of his features standing out in the light.
“I didn’t-,” Dean starts then stops, trying to gather his thoughts. “I didn’t tell you that because I expect you to have done the same. I don’t… It doesn’t matter. I just need you to know why I’m… nervous I guess. It’s not that I don’t want you. God, I want you
It reaches staggering new heights when Bobby casually mentions that
“Yeah, that’s usually what receiving mail entails, Benjamin,” Dean interrupts.
“What are you getting?” he asks, not removing his hand, and Cas absolutely hates the butterflies starting to appear in his stomach at the simple touch but he also
Dean’s hand traces abstract patterns into the fabric of his shirt on his back while the other one card through his hair relentlessly, and that’s it, he decides. That’s Heaven, that’s where he belongs.
This is
Dean is looking at him like he’s the moon, and Cas’ heart doesn’t know how to handle
Must be doing bookkeeping again. Which explains the typical bad mood. Dean stands while Bobby goes for the chair.
He had that look on his face, the one Cas knew meant “
“Well, the plan
“Benny —,”
He finally crosses the distance and sits down next to him on the stair, careful not to distract Holli. Dean doesn’t say anything, just keeps petting their dog carefully. It’s only when Cas’ hand finds him and laces their fingers together, his other one warm on his leg, when Dean turns to look at him.
But somehow 10-year-old Dean had sensed that wariness as soon as Cas had wound up at the table next to him. In the span of 5 minutes it was like Cas had known him his entire life. That very same day he dragged Dean to the cafeteria with him and had him meet Jimmy, and the rest is history.
“Duly noted,” Cas smiles as they both watch Dean at the counter grabbing their respective cup of coffee.
,” Balthazar repeats, watching as Cas seems to gradually gives into panic.
Dean sighs, looking up to the sky. The night is clear and the stars visible, and for a brief moment his mind drifts to a dark-haired man in Lawrence, wondering if Cas is awake too.
Dean hums against Cas’ mouth, tugging at his lower lip trapped between his teeth. Cas hisses at the sensation and Dean quickly let go before kissing him again, and again, and again.
“You’d want to foster?” Dean asks, seemingly surprised.
But habits die hard, and they’ve already come this far with so many of their trauma. Dean knows it’s still a long way until both of them feel comfortable enough to know waking up in an empty bed doesn’t mean you’ve been abandoned.
Dean never really leaves after that. Not that he means to in the first place, but they end up having a talk about it at 3am during the week after Cas’ accident.
I can still hear you telling me that I was impossible to love. That my heart was a caged animal, too scared to let anything close enough to touch it. I knew what you went through trying to hold the pieces of me together, so I told you that it was okay. That not everything is meant to be loved.
To find solace in absolution.
Cas shuffles on top of him to reach for the drawer of the bedside table and pulls out a bottle before stopping, turning back to look at Dean.
For a while they just breathe together and Dean finds comfort in just hearing Cas like that. But after a minute the floor starts being too uncomfortable and he climbs back into bed, hitting the mattress with a bit too much force for the bed’s strength, judging by the way the frame creaks.
“I’ll see you around, kid.”
Cas smiles back at him, trying to ignore the throbbing headache caused by how much he drank last night. Arguing with himself that he probably deserves it anyway he starts eating while they make small talk over coffee.
, he keeps telling himself.
Your name wasn’t always such a sharp thing in my mouth, but time has worn its edges; it added weight to every syllable. Of all the words I’ve swallowed and allowed to root in my chest, your name is the heaviest. But I still can’t bring myself to speak it, to watch it drop like a stone from my mouth and break against the ground.
Come yell at me on
And then Dean speaks again, voice woven with concern.
The world surely needs more Balthazar for the sake of its people.
Cas lets his hands slip from his shoulders to his knees where Dean’s hands are resting, and tightly holds on to them. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he’s vaguely aware that this might be the most important moment in the history of their relationship, but he has to do this. No matter how painful it might be, it’s for the greater good for both of them.
Cas looks back, blue eyes earnest in the darkness.
to fuck up this morning too.
But when Cas speaks, every single one of his words hits him in the guts.
“Hey,” he says softly into his hair, causing Cas to tilt his head up to look at him. “I love you too.”
“You know what’s something I’m still as sure of as the very first day?” Cas asks, looking down on Dean with a smile on his face, hands around Dean’s neck.
But it wouldn’t be fair.
“That was you?!” Castiel answers, pretending to be shocked.
“I’m not saying I think you’re wrong, I’m stating the obvious. He might react badly. But if you
. You’re all of it. And I feel blessed for it.”
“Okay, so I might have kept some things from you.”
Cas sighs into Dean’s mouth as he opens to his tongue, and they trade kisses for a while like that, Cas halfway on top of Dean, Dean’s hands resting on the swell of his ass.
He gathers his brother’s belongings and takes him back to rehab a few hours after instead. The last thing Cas asks his brother is to “
“The point is you didn’t do it.”
Sometimes, Castiel chases his own leads and dives into cases on his own, and yeah, okay, Dean doesn’t particularly like it but he indulges him — because he knows better than getting on the angel’s bad side and he’d rather tear out his own heart than having to go through
“Wish that were you, baby,” he whispers into the phone. “Wish I could see you like that, all gorgeous and all for me.”
“I really am sorry,” Dean whispers into his hair after what feels like an hour of silent and careful cuddling. “I shouldn’t have talked to you like that.”
“And it’s not like this place is going to a stranger either. We’ll be lucky if we’re not here more than once every week once Benny and Andrea move in.”
“But—,“
“I almost did it,” Cas says after a while, his voice still hoarse. “I know you saw it.”
He’s so lost in his thoughts he doesn’t register that he's pulled up to Bobby’s until he automatically turns off Baby’s engine, and the nerves immediately start rising within him.
This letter is the one that comes after Dean's first letter in Patient Love.
to keep getting hit at by approximately a quarter of the entire goddamn bar.
to see someone you can talk to. A shrink, a doctor, a girl… well or a boy, I’m not picky.  I just need you to talk for real, to get some help for that big brain of yours,” he nods toward Dean. “And once all of that is done, yeah. I want you around. I’m not exactly growing younger by the minute and the garage could need a little help.”
Dean gets a hold of his phone then and sends a simple text, being careful of wording it correctly through the tears that run out of his eyes.
“But… why? Why are you telling yourself that you're failing?”
There’s something indecipherable into Cas’ eyes as he answers. “I don’t know. I thought it would be fun. The last party we had here was Jimmy’s Christmas party, I kinda feel like it would be nice to just have… friends over again.” He moves to dump his empty cup in the trash before turning back to Dean. “But it’s fine if you don’t want to. It’s just an idea.”
Dean closes his eyes, relishing the feeling of Cas’ hands slipping his hands down his neck to his shoulder, brushing his fingers against his skin.
“This can’t be happening,” Dean laughs bitterly, looking up at the sky as so many mixed emotions fill him. “After all of this? After the offer, the promise of me finishing my career behind a desk? How they treated me? And now they want me
Massive shit.

, either.
Dean slightly furrows his brows, so Cas clarifies.
Cas nods and Dean’s smile just widens further.
“Oh, come on, babe! Don’t make me suffer through this!” Dean whines again, but Cas keeps his eyes fixated on the road.
“I don’t know what to do, Benny,” he answers truthfully.
Some mortar exploded around us while we were tailing Talibans yesterday. Thankfully it didn’t get any of us, but Barry spent a good amount of time tearing shrapnel out of the skin of my back while Benny and the team kept cackling, betting on the time I’d finally pass out. I clenched my teeth, and didn’t. It’s probably gonna leave scars, but at this point there’s practically no part of my body that’s still clean of battlefield marks. I’ve learned to cherish them. They’re part of who I am, part of the story that makes me a soldier.
who help me with the letter at the end! And a general thank you to
“Hey, he’s going to be alright. It’s Dean we’re talking about. Man could get hit by a rock and he’d be okay,” Charlie jokes, visibly trying to lighten the mood.
And here they are two years after his overdose to the date, and Cas is crying on their bathroom floor with a needle very clearly still inserted into his vein.
Dean swallows. This is dangerous territory and something he hasn’t stated to anyone but Bobby just a couple of days before.
“You’re not,” Dean argues.
I can’t watch you fail trying to love me again.
He looks so concerned and Cas hates the way he feels. Hates that he’s unable to cheer for him.
“I don’t like where we’re stuck at,” Dean says after a while, and Cas can’t help but close his eyes and breathe in the scent of him, knowing it’s not something he’s going to be allowed anymore.
“Cas?” he asks, his voice soft. “Sweetheart, hey.”
“Alright. We got to be gone by 11, we’re picking up Charlie.”
That’s why it used to be so hard to lie to each other. Ever since Cas started using, he’s mastered the art. Jimmy though, that’s another story. He can conceal things from Cas when he knows he’s going to tell him at the end of the line, but this is different.
“Yeah. Yeah, that comes with the job description.”
Happy birthday, Cas. I don’t know where I’ll be tomorrow, if I’m going to be dead or alive by morning, but I know one thing for sure: you will always be the love of my life.
“Yeah,” Dean nods, an absent smile on his lips. “Yeah, we’re really good.”
Balthazar waves from his spot on the couch when Cas turns his head to look around, probably wondering why Dean used the ‘we’.
“What are you doing?” Cas ends up asking, still sitting on the bed.
He’s tipsy, and laughing, and
” or “
“What-,” Cas starts then stops, turning his head to catch Dean's eyes, the white color of the envelope in his hand contrasting with the tan color of his skin. “What’s this?”
“Do you want me to go?” Dean asks as Cas starts opening the envelope.
They’re climbing back into bed when it hits, and Dean has to stop for a second to catch his wind back, on his knees in the middle of the bed. Cas is already on his back, and Dean can feel the weight of his gaze on the side of his face before he regains his composure, but Cas knows. He always does.
“I mean I was drunk and I shouldn’t have… jumped on you like that.”
I had really hoped that being here, away from home and from you would help me heal, help me let you go. And the miles between us did help for a while, but healing is harder to come by than I had thought, no matter how much I try to, and no matter the view from my window.
Jimmy made it clear that this was your choice. That things would be better for you if we stopped seeing each other. Maybe leaving was the cowardly way out, but I couldn’t see how I could stay in Lawrence knowing you were still around. That I couldn’t have you. I would’ve liked to see your face, though. I would’ve liked to hear it from you. At least I thought you owed me that much.
Bobby huffs and Dean hears him come closer, the sound of his steps on the concrete floor of the garage he’d know anywhere.
“No. Not a single time,” he finally says, his voice soft, and Dean breathes again, “sure, it’s been hard, but ultimately… Being here with you, it makes it all worth it.”
After that, everything is fuzzy for him. He remembers the rumble of the Impala beneath him. A hand on his chest, never leaving him as they drove. The quiet hum of a Zeppelin song, the sound of the first few chords of “The Battle of Evermore” echoing against the bends of the car and into Dean’s chest. The hand moving from his chest to trace the line of his jaw fleetingly, thumbing at the cut on his bottom lip and drawing a sharp hiss from his mouth. He sank again, into the cottony comfort of the dark.
? Dude was your best friend. Cas was his twin brother. It doesn’t make any sense.”
Cas sigh. “It feels like letting go of one last part of Jimmy. It’s weird. This place was his for so long.”
“Again, is it a complaint or a praise?” he repeats, delighting when Dean laughs again.
— Dean
— Dean
“God, remember that first time you found me high?” he chuckles.
Dean lies back on the grass, tugging on Cas’ hand until he’s lying next to him. The ex-angel curls up against his side, tucks his head under Dean’s chin, a mess of raven hair tickling his skin as they both look up at the sky, and Dean breathes free for the first time in what feels like hours.
Cas knows that he’s hurt him at the core of his pride, and he knows this is Dean’s knee-jerk reaction to being contradicted. It doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt, especially with the look Dean throws at him before he turns his back on him and makes his way to the kitchen. He starts taking things out of the fridge, presumably to start with dinner, but he all but throws the things on the kitchen island, making a point of making loud noises.
Warm. Reassuring. Dean shivers slightly at the contact. It’s not much but it’s enough to ground him, remind him that he’s not alone. Cas got him.
“Are you ready for your first appointment, Mr. Winchester?” she asks.
I know it’s not healthy, and I know I need to let you go. But I know this in the same way wood knows it’s best to resist the fire. I guess we don’t just get to choose how long we burn, or what the flames leave behind.
that our best friend is lying in a hospital bed because he’s been running around with a death wish that YOU marked him with when you decided to break him apart. And you’re telling me it’s not about you? Think harder, Jimmy.”
“You know,” Dean says after a while, voice slightly muffled from where he’s pressed against Cas’ skin. “I can’t wait to make use of our new bathtub in the house.”
Dean sniffles. The first sound he’s made in 5 minutes.
“I was really concerned when he left a year back,” Benny continues. “I didn’t know if he was going to get the support he needed. Not that I didn’t trust Sam or Charlie, but veterans have a way of shutting down when they leave the Teams. For someone like Dean who loved his job to that extent, I was pretty worried about him losing himself. You know, he’s like a little brother to me. A pain in the ass sure, but he’s part of my family.”
Definitely
“And uh. I guess she helped me figure out some things. Not everything obviously, I think it’s going to take months, maybe even years to go through every trauma I still carry with me. But like, the surface of what’s going wrong the most. And I just… I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know who I am, I don’t understand what’s my place in all of this.”
He replays Charlie’s words from the day before, Cas’ encouragements from this morning.
Dean is busy contemplating into his coffee and moping around in the kitchen when Benny storms in covered in sweat. He doesn’t bother raising his head to look at his friend, too engaged in looking at the steam escaping from his cup and wondering why the
“Benny-”
” she said with tears in her eyes before crushing Dean into a hug), and matching custom made knives for Bobby and Jo.
There’s a bottle of whisky on the floor and Castiel’s hand grips it tight around the neck. He doesn’t move when Dean sits beside him, his gaze fixed on the city lights, but Dean knows where he’s really gone.
It’s been gnawing at him for months, the mere fact of having to put an expiration date on what he qualified his dream job. He’s been faced with enough “
“Did you really forget what day this is?” Cas smiles,
I lied.
Dean doesn’t say anything, only nods slightly again as he rests his weight against Cas, all 6ft of him pressing against Cas’ body. He comes with Cas’ name on his tongue, quickly swallowed by a kiss before slumping against him, his head fitting just the right way into the crook of Cas’ neck.
Not the way he can’t seem to be able to breathe anymore. Not how his heart is in his throat, not how his mind keeps telling him it was always bound to happen, that Dean will always choose to leave over staying. That Cas would never be enough.
Dean had left half an hour before, and Cas had made a point of staying in his office until he was certain the house was empty. Then he ended up having to go to Dean’s room to retrieve a paper ream for his printer. And when he started digging through the closet where all of the Novaks’ supplies and random shit were stacked, a little box fell out on the floor and spilled its content on the floor.
“Dean,” Cas whispers. “Look at me. You’re not your dad. You’re never going to be like him.”
“I understand what it means,” Cas cuts him off. “But does it really work? I know you, I know you have a conscience. I know you’re probably still thinking of these… people at night.”
And so he stares at his best friend in the whole wide world, standing under their school’s bleachers together in all the glory of a Friday afternoon, and his heart lurches at the way the tips of Dean’s dirty-blonde hair looks almost golden framed by the light of the sun. The green of his eyes twinkles with something almost dangerous, something that Cas recognizes for exactly what it is: trouble.
“Arthur is
it feels. Dean complies and takes it all, sucking and moaning while enjoying the assault of Cas’ thrust into his mouth. It’s the thing about Dean, he enjoys a bit of manhandling from time to time and over the past few months Cas has been allowed to take more and more control in their sex life- and he
Dean hands him the paper bag and the cup of coffee, and Cas smiles as he uncovers a white box with a slice of Charlie’s best apple pie. As well as what appears to be a vinyl record neatly wrapped in a white package.

“And yes, I think I should. I just… I need some time to figure out how to do this.”
,” Balt adds, understanding visibly dawning on him. “So you think that it’s possible he got jealous, on top of thinking that your relationship with Dean might be toxic in regards to your drug use?”
Dean never wants to leave this embrace. Never wants to leave this bed either. It’s too good, it still feels slightly unreal.
He thinks of Cas last night, tightly wrapped around him and begging him to stay with all the love he could gather.
“No,” Cas let out, his voice watery and broken up. “You need to stop. You can’t- you need to stop bringing Dean into this, I
Dean hums into the kiss, melts into the softness of Cas’ lips, shivers slightly at the touch of Cas’ hands on his naked chest. He lets his hand wander down the scars on his arm and side. He’s been doing that a lot lately, like a reverence. Dean doesn’t know if he likes it or not, but he welcomes it. He’s been having less of a hard time looking at his injuries in the mirror the past few weeks, and that might be a factor as to why.
“Well yeah, a little. But that doesn’t mean I didn’t want to know how you were doing. You were my kid.” A beat, then. “You still are.”
When Cas comes, it’s with a shout and a moan that Dean swallows with a kiss. He shakes through the strength of it as Dean continues to stroke both of them until he comes over his own fingers with a whimper and Cas’ name folded behind his teeth and heavy on his tongue.
Dean has never been the type of guy for extravagant analogies (that’s always been Cas- the nerd), but if he had to find something close to what it feels like to kiss Cas again, he’d say that it’s like the cosmos is exploding beneath his eyelids.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes, I booked my weekly appointment with Dr. Mayer at Lawrence General. Every Tuesday and Thursday. Don’t worry about me.”
“We talked,” he starts, and stops at the twinkle of interest in Charlie’s eyes before he picks up again. “About… you know, how we broke up. And we found out that Jimmy lied to us. He told Dean I dumped him, and he told me that Dean ran because he didn’t want to be with a junkie. And because both of us are constipated communicators, we never realized until I broke down and told him how much I missed him.”
Dean takes and Cas gives willingly, lost in the sensation but making sure to keep his hands off him, not knowing what this means, not yet. When Dean withdraws just a whisker, wild green meets steady blue and Castiel’s heart is in his throat as he watches his pupils blown wide.
At least that’s what Cas thought.
The doorbell rings just as Castiel finds the strength to drag himself to the kitchen. His sweatpants are hanging low on his hips and his old worn-out Red Hot shirt is doing a poor job of covering his collarbone as he makes his way to the door, briefly wondering who may be foolish enough to bother the Novak household this early in the morning.
“You’ll be alright, right?” he whispered as he traced the line of Dean’s throat up to the bolt of his jaw with light kisses.
Next week we're getting our idiots in love back for some long-awaited (and rather frantic) reunion 💙💚
Beta'd by the ever so fabulous
Dean complies with a laugh as both of them join him at the table, and Benny winks at Cas from above the rim of his paper cup.
”? Or maybe a simple “
“Do you like it?” Dean whispers after a while, his lips still brushing at the corner of Cas’ mouth.
“Hi, Cas. Is it okay if I call you Cas?
“Now you’re overselling it, sweetheart,” Dean smiles as Cas turns his head on the pillow to look at him. “Sleep was overrated whenever I was on deployment or on OPs, but I did enjoy my sleep once I got back home. I just don’t have anything that heavy on my conscience that pushes me to get up early and go
When you were next to me, everything suddenly made sense. All the trauma, all the darkness had a purpose, because even when I didn’t realize it, all of it was leading me to you.
“Hey. Hey look at me,“ Cas answers, cradling his jaw and catching his eyes.
The song has been added to
Of losing Cas over and over again until he couldn’t stand it anymore. And there’s nothing he wouldn’t do to prevent it from happening ever again.
“Yeah.”
“Haha, mock all you want old man, it was actually pretty awesome,” Dean answers with a matching grin. “But yeah, eventually, I’ve thought about it. I just… I don’t know, there’s so much stuff going on between PT, and Cas—,”
Dean follows his line of sight before he answers.
“I miss you too,” Cas answers right away, the softness in his voice sending goosebumps into Dean’s skin. “All the time.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” he whispers against the shell of his ear. “We’re okay. You’re going to be alright. You can let go, I’ve got you.”
“I’m not going anywhere,” he says once he let go of Cas’ lips.
Cas smiles. “Okay.”
Jimmy sucks in a breath. He looks at Charlie.
It takes one smooth take for Dean to lift him up from the counter and press him against the wall, and suddenly Cas has a handful of Dean pressed flush against him and
There it is. The dreaded question. The one that can change someone’s view about you in one single word. Dean had to face it a handful of times, but it doesn’t even come close to how terrified he is that Cas might see him differently after his answer.
Cas sighs before he sits on his bed and draws up his knee to his chest. Jimmy’s entire being hurts at the sight, at how small his brother looks. And he hates it.
“Your goddamn good heart is going to be the end of you someday, Winchester,” Benny grumbles through the phone. “How come I had never heard of this Cas fellow before?”
There are tear tracks on Dean’s cheek and his bottom lip wobbles lightly. Cas’ thumb follows the line of his cheekbone tenderly, letting his fingers graze the sharp cut of his jaw and Dean closes his eyes at the soft touch, exhaling a deep breath. Fresh tears spill from his closed eyes and Cas carefully wipes them up with his thumbs, before leaning close and placing a kiss on his cheek tenderly. Dean doesn’t make a sound, and after a while he lets Cas draw him into his arms and back into bed, and buries his head into Castiel’s chest, still not uttering a word. Cas carefully keeps him close, almost cradling his body against him.
God he loves him.
He can’t help but slide an arm around Cas’ shoulders, unable to let go of the feeling that something terrible could’ve happened. Cas doesn’t comment on it but Dean can feel how he slightly melts in his embrace as he leads them both to his room.
Cas sighs. “Dean is the one who found me.”
Little Creek — Joint Expeditionary Base–Little Creek (JEB–LC), formerly known as Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and commonly called simply Little Creek, is the major operating base for the Amphibious Forces in the United States Navy's Atlantic Fleet.
“And it’s okay if you don’t find it in you to forgive him. It’s okay if you’re mad, and hurt. I understand. But I think it’s better we both know now.”
Dean closes his eyes at that, making a point of holding Cas slightly tighter against him.
“What’s up with you?” Charlie asks as she places a plate of fries in front of him. “Good ol’ hangover?”
Dean had left without a single glance behind, and had only said goodbye to his little brother. Even Charlie, who had been Dean’s best friend ever since they met, learned about Dean joining the Navy via text a week after he had left.
“Okay spill,” he presses on. Then rolls his eyes so hard that Cas thinks he might have brain damage afterward. “Come on, I know this is about him. What’s up?”
He doesn’t even take a second to look at the older man as he gruffs against the wall and immediately makes a bee-line for his brother, cupping his shoulder and forcing him to meet his eyes.
“I don’t really know. Until it stops hurting I guess. If it ever stops,” Dean huffs, his eyes falling to his feet. “I mean, there’s a reason I was offered a desk job or a discharge after all.”
And Dean is home, finally.
He loves him so much that sometimes it’s almost unbearable to feel his heart grow ten sizes just as he looks at him.
Dean slumps into the couch, making a big scene out of sighing. It’s not like he didn’t see that conversation coming. He even expected Charlie to bother him with this way sooner than 3 weeks after settling at her place.
It feels surreal, being able to have a very nice conversation with him after all this time. Dean realizes right there at that very moment that he wished Castiel wouldn’t have to leave.
As usual, find my chaotic self on
"Don't act like you didn't know that already," Dean laughs as Castiel finally allows himself to turn to face him.
He pulls himself away from his pain for a moment, to deal with Castiel’s. One of his hands finds his knee while the other cups his cheek, and
It’s the crux of their story- the ups and downs, the highs and lows, the insanity of it all. It’s how he loves so wholefully and how he breaks so easily. It’s about how all of their broken pieces managed to meet in the middle and fit back together again, with countless amounts of love and hope and care. It’s about Cas being the love of his life, even after all this hurt and wounds. Even after all this time.
I miss you. I miss you so much that sometimes I can’t breathe anymore.
“Be quiet,” Dean laughs around his cock, letting his tongue lick slowly at the slit where precome already drools before sliding all the way down his length.
“No, I’m being serious here. What happened, did Alicia complain about your uptight dressing style again?”
He pretends that things are fine. After all, he’s become pretty damn good at pretending.
This simple sentence acts like a punch to Dean’s gut and he has to retrieve the urge to curse Balthazar.
Dean sighs. Braces himself for what’s to come as he moves in for one last kiss on Cas’ cheek.
“Dean?” Cas growls as he approaches him carefully from behind.
“Maybe, but what’s the alternative? I know you, I know it’s probably been weighing on you all this time. Don’t you
look good. He looks like he’s out of a Rolling Stones magazine, and it’s infuriating.

(See the end of the chapter for
you got blown up, but now my anxiety is just through the roof.”

Cas takes a breath. “Yeah, I guess. Someone called asking for him, and I just lost it.”
But if he learned anything from last night at all, it’s that there’s still hope for the both of them. So he’s going to hold onto every last shred of sanity he still possesses until Dean is ready to come back.
“Thank you.”
Cas opens his eyes again, only to watch as a tear rolls down Dean’s cheek. If possible he seems even more hurt than before, but Dean feels absolutely
“I don’t know why I keep doing it. I know it’s wrong, just like I knew reading Dean’s letters back in September was already wrong. But I panicked and before I even realized what I was doing I had opened it and I was reading through it.”
“Good.”

Dean can feel Cas exhales and little by little his grip loosens, until they’re just resting in each other’s embrace.
“We should head back inside,” Dean whispers against him, “We really are going to catch a cold, and I’m not sure I want to see you get sick as a human for the first time, it’ll be horrendous.”
“That bad huh?” Cas says, slightly amused as he cards a hand through Dean’s hair. “Wanna talk about it?”
Dean looks at him curiously, his head tilting a little, and Cas can’t help but feel his heart grow a size as he recognizes his own gesture in Dean’s behavior.
“I don’t know. I’ll sleep on it, we’ll see tomorrow.”
But then he thinks back of Cas, alone in a hospital bed too big for him, tubes attached to his body, and he knows he has to do it.
Cas laughs and takes Benny’s outstretched hand to get back on his feet before they both head back inside. Dean immediately catches them as they cross the bay window, and a wide smile appears on his face as Cas makes his way to him.
And maybe it’s the alcohol, maybe it’s the exhaustion. Or maybe it’s just been there all along, but it feels nice hearing it said out loud.
They both know.
“Benny, what’s wrong with my mail?” Dean asks a little bit more forcefully.
“Alright, Cas. I know you’re new here, but I
And Cas aches for an entirely different reason.
Benny pats his shoulder as they make it outside, a hand already going to his pocket to take a cigarette out.
He managed to make them dinner with a collection of leftovers from the fridge, much to Castiel’s awe. They really need to get on that grocery shopping problem — they’re bordering the “no more cheese” situation, and Dean’s not eager to discover what no cheese in the house does to an already pissed off Castiel.
Cas’ bandaged hand is on his arm suddenly, and Dean realizes he’s almost shaking.

“What’s going on?”
he always knew. And he tried to play big brother with me, father even. You know, when we moved out of Gallagher’s, after he got in the way of him knocking me down? He did it because he thought that being out of here would solve the problem. You know, in retrospect I think Jimmy never really understood why I did drugs.”
Maybe if I had tried hard enough, I could’ve convinced you to stop, and then we wouldn’t be there. I wouldn’t be miles away from you suffering through BUD/S, and you wouldn’t be suffering through rehab to try and stay clean. Jimmy mentioned it in passing the other day on the phone, and pretending like I didn’t want to know when the only thing I really wanted to do was ask about you was probably the hardest thing I’ve had to bring myself to do in the past few months.
“Last November.”
Jimmy hates himself. He doesn’t think he could ever hate himself more than he does right now.
“You’re gonna go get a shower, and then I’m going to take care of you. Think you can do that for me?”
“No,” Dean huffs. “You?”
The sound of the bullets that fire through the air doesn’t even make him flinch. Jimmy’s picking up a bag of chips — vinegar, Cas’ favorite, because he’s trying to be a good brother even at 3 AM, in preparation of possibly losing him in less than 24h — when it hits him in several places and he collapses instantly, his body hitting the floor heavily.

Dean is silent for a minute, his coffee the sole bearer of his attention. Cas watches him closely, studying the dark circles underneath his beautiful eyes, the way the skin crinkles at the corner of his eyes when he smiles, the soft stubble that’s covering the line of his jaw because he forgot to shave in the past few days. He looks beautiful, but he looks tired. He’s been making progress with sleep but it’s still spotty at best, and no amount of therapy seems to be changing that.
