“And she felt bad about leaving you home alone just working on your novel all night,” Alfie added. Castiel looked at Jody who didn’t deny it.
“We are fixing that. Now.” He pushed the cart around the store, stopping at different aisles and grabbing different ingredients.
Dean nodded, “perfect. Should we keep going?” Castiel nodded and Dean closed the gap between their lips again, gently this time.
Dean frowned. “Why are you always bringing up Bella? I’m trying to talk about us, and all you want to do is talk about her. Yeah, Bella and I have history. I’m always going to care about her.” He shrugged awkwardly. “But now . . . I like you.” Dean looked up at Castiel. “So what do you say?”
They spent about an hour under the tree before Charlie perked up again, “you ready to go look for them?” He nodded.
Castiel felt his cheeks turn bright red and Dean looked far too pleased with himself. Castiel wanted to chastise Dean for suggesting they hook up in the school bathroom, but god help him, Castiel wanted to as well.
“Gosh, Charlie and Dean are so cute together,” sighed Krissy. Jesse sighed looking into an empty popcorn bowl. “What's wrong? Because I sure as hell know that it isn't because of Charlie and Dean.”
“From my perspective there was no fondling of his rear area. Although I did notice Jo admiring Dean’s physique as Kevin retrieve his breath.” The voice came from above and caused at four of them to jump, even Kevin.
people from monsters. He was debating if he was going to kill off one of the characters for dramatic tension later on. When he told Gabe the idea he had laughed and said “wouldn’t it be funny if they just died every single chapter and kept coming back to life like cockroaches?” Castiel had rolled his eyes at that and created a character who got off on watching people die repeatedly for future use.
“Sammy is working till ten at the library, Bobby is on a date with Ellen.” Dean laughed, “looks like we all managed to be on dates. Bobby with Ellen, Sam with books, me with my amazing fake boyfriend.”
Benny sighed, but he didn’t seem surprised. “I’ll sober him up.” He leaned down and effortlessly slung Lee over his shoulder.
Castiel knew exactly what was contained in that letter. He had written it after a middle school dance.
Jo recovered from her initial shock. “Well, you are so gorgeous that it was easy.” Castiel looked at her in surprise, he wasn’t used to that flirty tone from her. He looked between the two of them, were they also dating?
That got a short laugh out of Castiel, “if I told Bella, I would be the butt end of countless jokes. I would prefer to keep it so only my family, you, and Anna knew.”
“Oh yeah, he helped me to find you. Right Castiel?” Charlie turned around stare behind her but nobody was there. “Castiel?” Confusion leaked her way into her tone.
Castiel was never one to beat around the bush when it came to conflict. “I’m sorry, did I do something to piss you off?”
Ms. Harvelle had walked into class with her usual thin lipped smile smile and neat outfit. She walked right up to the board and started writing down the days agenda. Her chalk ended up snapping in the middle of writing down the word Asyndeton. She just stared at it with her back to the kids for five minutes. They started whispering in concern after the second minute of waiting. After the five minutes though she just crouched into a ball and started rocking back and forth. Half choked noises rising out of her.
“Are you worried about Dean taking advantage of you?” Jo asked in confusion, “cause you  know he’s actually a pretty good dude. If you said no he would stop immediately and just sit with you and hang out.”
“Surprisingly easy,” Dean said as he opened the oven to check on the brownies. “She’s beyond pissed that I am dating her sworn enemy. I would wear a bulletproof vest, just in case.
He dropped the sticks that he had been rubbing together aimlessly. “Holy shit Charlie put a bell on you.”
Dean looked down towards where Cas had been pointing to and saw the lump of green moss.”Huh, I forgot about that.”
“Lee can’t keep his fucking hands to himself,” Dean seethed. Lee didn’t respond to that, because he was unconscious.
Castiel nodded, taking a sip of his ginger ale as he waited for Dean to continue. He hadn’t even noticed Bella in the weeks leading up to the field trip. He had been so occupied with the anniversary of his parent's death, pretending he wasn’t in love with his boyfriend, and waiting on early application admission letters from college that he hadn’t even processed that she was around.
those things?” She managed to get the whole sentence out before her lungs decided to get more water out.
As they walked away Gabe walked up to Castiel holding a kitten and nudged him conspiratorially, “chatting you Dean Winchester? Maybe you can dethrone Bella from her perch.”
“Heya Castiel,” Ellen Harvelle greeted him once he walked in, “the usual table?” Castiel nodded gratefully as Ellen led him to a corner booth. “One chocolate shake and a burger will be right up. Joanna Beth is at the school right now, otherwise I would have her come say hi.”
Cas looked to where a girl was playing in all the paints. She was excitedly showing Gabriel how to paint himself look like a field of flowers. "Do you think that if one painted themselves so appear as flowers they might attract bees?"
“Don’t remind me,” Castiel growled. Jo opened her mouth, undoubtedly to tease him some more. Fortunately, she was interrupted by Dean calling after Castiel.
“Hey, Cas,” a voice cut through the blackness. “Cas! Castiel wake up,” the voice commanded. “Hello? Hey, can I get some help over here?”
Castiel stared the note down. So Dean did love him, apparently. That did not mean anything though, he still cheated on him with Bella less than five seconds into the relationship being real. And just because he loved Castiel didn’t mean that he didn’t love Bella more. Despite all this, Castiel felt the flicker of hope in his chest. He desperately tried to squash it down, but it persisted.
"Well my dear Lilith," flashed a wicked grin, "I would call this a pleasant surprise except, oh yeah, I don't like you."
“Cute trench coat.” She smiled and Castiel waited for the end of whatever mean jibe she was about to make. “The sixties called, they want it back.”
Dean looked up in surprise. “Hey.” Castiel geared himself up to apologize again for leaving Dean again to hang out with Bella but Dean interrupted him before he could even start his sentence.
Kevin made a shout from inside the tent so Dean lost his focus on the conversation. “Kevin, you okay man?”
He had only gotten through Jensen telling Jared about their dad’s disappearance when Gabriel marched into his room with a purpose and a set expression on his face. Castiel looked up at him with a mix of dread and confusion.
"This is most certainly the most dumbassed thing he has ever thought of," Dean muttered to himself. He steeled his nerves and walked out with the most sarcastic grin he could muster.
“I’m just gonna get to homeroom, please don’t be late for yours,” Castiel reminded her. She just waved him off and continued to sketch. He smiled and walked out to find his homeroom.
“Cas, what happened? I can’t help if you won’t tell me what’s wrong,” Dean tried to rub Castiel’s shoulder reassuringly but Castiel turned on him angrily.
Dean smiled, “I’m about to fuck the sexiest person I know. Hell yeah, I’m eager.”  He unscrewed the bottle and squeezed a bit on his finger before setting it aside. "Do you still want to?" Dean checked in.
He looked at the others, desperate for one of them to say it was a joke. That this was all faked by them.
“I gotta go see Jo anyways.” Castiel lied as he waved him off. Then he whispered in a voice low enough for Dean to hear him, “go get her.” He turned around and walked away, fighting back the tears in his eyes and swallowing the pain in his heart.
“But Charlie, you should know something,” Castiel said after a second of awkward silence had passed. “I wrote this
He heard the door open up, “Dean,” whispered a soft voice. Definitely not Sam. A soft hand touched his shoulder and he turned his head to see Ms. Harvelle.
“Hello, you are Dean correct?” He approached him at the fire making station. He was working with rock and learning how to recognize the stones.
“Can you walk? We need to swim through the river.” Cas still had his arms around Dean. Dean nodded carefully and began to roll out of Cas’s grasp but was stopped by a flair of pain.
“Dean, you should stitch that while they still need to pack up camp.” Dean jumped at the whisper in his ear, not having heard Cas move.
“Not my fault it was tuna salad day. How was I to know that she would make us clean up after everyone.”
“Gordon? I thought you knew. By the way Lilith, shoddy work on that one. Making Castiel clean up your dirty work.” He tutted his tongue, “was it a little too much for you to handle?”
Castiel went to his locker first, passing by Anna who ducked her head when he walked by to avoid eye contact. Castiel tried not to let it get to him. When he got to his locker found a pack of gum and an old history notebook full of sketches of castles. Thanks to the gum his locker smelled minty fresh.
Dean should have suspected as much. His dad was obsessed with the colt, he probably would keep the bloody thing until he died. His foolish quest to kill Azazel would be the death of him. The council was too well guarded.
“Mr. Novak gave everyone ten bonus points on our test. The only time in his history of his teaching career he has?”
“You know, you’re the one who talked me into coming on this trip,” Castiel reminded him. “The least you could do is talk to me.”
“Dean what’s that?” Jo asked. Dean whipped his head to stare at the trio which were watching them. Kevin was leaning on Charlie’s shoulder dependently and she was barely able to support him. Jo was staring open mouthed at Cas’s hand on his hip.
“We wanna know how far?” One of the girls next to Bella said. “H on A?” When Castiel had no response to whatever kind of code she was speaking in. “H on N? H up and down on P? T on AH?”
"Damn, those sound nice. All they have is a you catch them you beat them policy." Dean pulled his shirt down and stood up, smirking at their appalled faces. "Are you gonna stand there all day or is Cas finally suggest something, cause I'm fresh out of ideas."
“We’ve had sex before though,” Castiel pointed out. Even as he said it though, he knew it didn’t mean anything. This time felt different. This time Dean was caressing his body like he was the most precious thing, this time it felt like making love.
Castiel panicked again, if Anna confronted Castiel then Michael would definitely find out. He needed her to stop walking towards him and eradicate any thought of Castiel still having feelings for her. So, he did the first thing he could think of.
Dean turned around in surprise, “my loves! You have returned! Michael darling, how is your boo boo.” Dean started to walk away from the hole to divert their attention.
Dean smiled, “come kiss me you sap.” Castiel happily obliged. He reached around to dig his fingers into Castiel’s soft hair as wandering hands played with his ass. Dean was only wearing his plaid shirt rather than multiple layers like usual. Cas had taken to hanging up his trenchcoat and suit jacket in Dean’s closet. It made the whole ‘undressing’ thing twice as easy.
She held Michael in a tight hug for a bit. “Please be safe, carry your mace with you, always wear a condom, make sure you always ask for consent. Consent is
“Oh no,” Lilith snickered, “wrong boy. Castiel is the one with a stick up his ass. Michael is just boring.”
Lee’s eyes raked over Castiel’s ‘costume’ and he raised an eyebrow. “You and Dean are still together then?”
” Dean practically growled and he captured Castiel’s lips in another deep kiss, flipping them so that Castiel was on top.
“Er, no?” Sam replied. His eyes were too innocent. Once again, Castiel decided it wasn’t his problem. He nodded and walked away. Sam slammed the door behind him.
Dean looked hesitant. “I don’t know Cas, you had a glass of wine and this stuff is pretty strong. Do you even know what your tolerance limit is?”
“Did you have to pick the furthest college you could think of?” Gabe talked over Castiel’s question angrily, “Who am I supposed to eat lunch with and talk shit about Cassie to?”
“Yeah, I remember.” Castiel’s boots froze onto the skis, and he laid there in the splits for what felt like days.
Castiel expected Dean to tease him for being slow, but instead he started washing all of his dishes. “When you’re done with that let me know, I’m going to wash these and move on to the brownies.”
Dean smiled, “I do now.” He drifted to sleep in the arms of his angel, knowing he would be there in the morning no matter what. In that moment Dean didn’t think of the future. Where he was now was absolute paradise.
Charlie and Kevin walked over quietly and she hugged him around the neck. "See you tomorrow Dean. Don't get yourself killed in the first five seconds."
“I’ve been around.” Castiel’s eyes flicked over to look at Dean, but he wouldn’t meet his eyes. “I saw you guys on the slopes.”
Jo ambled over to him and pushed Castiel away. In one quick movement she untied the vines and peeled away the moss. “I can’t see very well, Dean take off your jacket, and shirt.”
“Well Benny has a girlfriend already so that must be right up his alley,” a snarky voice cut in. Bella sat on the couch across from him while two of her friends sat on either side of her and one sat next to them.
Castiel’s heart skipped a beat and he frantically fought down the blush he felt rising to his cheeks.  “All right,” Castiel said finally, “I’ll go. But the hot chocolate had better be as good as you say.”
Castiel pulled out his pad of paper and began his work on the story, ignoring Charlie’s sympathetic stare.
“Charlie you okay?” She nodded shaky and stared back over the river where the hounds had formerly stood.
Dean slid out an pulled off his condom, tying it off. He threw it somewhere Castiel didn’t see and turned back around. Dean rolled Castiel on his side, wrapping his arms around him.
“Well, what say you,” mumbled a sultry voice. The arms wrapped around his waist tighter and someone’s lips began to lightly trail up his neck. Dean relaxed into the embrace, repressing a shiver.
Charlie continued laughing. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry for laughing. It’s just…” Charlie doubled over cackling, “you think that you are this poor creature in love with a guy that will never like you back. Meanwhile, you keep rejecting Dean every chance you get.”
“Well, I only made the rule because I’ve never kissed anybody, and I was nervous people would see how awkward I was and guess the relationship was fake.”
After seeing Jo’s art portraying everyone as supernatural creatures, Castiel had been inspired to write a series based on supernatural entities in the real world. The original idea was having a journalist documenting supernatural phenomena in the world and writing articles on them, but then one day the journalist found himself caught up in a mess with a demonic entity who was not happy about her revealing their secrets.
“I thought you still had feelings for Anna,” Dean muttered fiercely, fingers flexing on Castiel’s slim hips as he kissed him.
“Good,” Dean replied. He looked back at Castiel and Jo but Castiel ducked his head to avoid eye contact.
Dean chuckled, “so like an eight. Unfortunately we got to move you over to the fire man, so this is gonna get to a nine.” Kevin groaned but let Dean drag him over to Charlie. It took about two minutes so they only had to wait about ten for Jo to return. Dean was thanking the heavens that she had a handful of vines along with a bunch of big leaves.
Castiel nodded, pulling up a blanket to cover their bodies. Hesitantly, he began to run his fingers through Dean’s hair. Soon, he fell asleep to the sound of Dean’s breathing and the music outside.
All the students simultaneously turned their heads to check out who the new contender in the ring was. Well everybody except for Emily who was reading in the corner. When Krissy saw who it was she mildly swooned. She was always a sucker for cute couples. The man at the door with his cool blue eyes and ruffled black hair mixed with a brown eyed blonde who was shorter than him by at least seven inches was a very cute couple.
"Why do you care if I live? If I die you are one person closer to home. I don't see the logic here."
Dean nodded and liked he understood. “Oh, okay.” He sat in silence for a bit. Castiel stared at Dean, waiting for the curiosity to hit him. Soon enough, it did. “Okay, who?”
“Dean, it doesn’t matter to me how you look. I don’t care if you can no longer ‘get it up’ as you would put it. I love your soul. I love your laugh. I love how fiercely protective you are over those who you love. I love how you love star trek and other movies that make no sense to me. I love how you are still loyal to a father who died years ago and forgive everyone for their mistakes. I love how you hate chick flick moment such as these. I love how you love me and I love you.”
“Come here weirdo,” Michael affectionately rolled his eyes as he pulled Castiel into a hug. While his arms were wrapped around him Gabe hugged Michael from the other side.
“Might have gotten into a screaming match over him giving me a B in history class when I deserved an A.” Gabe dropped his smile when Jody put the camera away then turned towards Castiel, “In my defense, Clara Barton is a lot more important than he seemed to think she was.”
When they arrived at Calculus, Dean pulled Cas into a hug. “Sorry I couldn’t drive you today, practice ya know?”
A smooth voice replied, “reaping playing.” The screen lit up to show a black man reading out the names for district one. Dean ate two bites of the lettuce each time a name was called. A couple of people stood out to him.
“Well welcome to my party,” Lee cheerfully patted Castiel on the shoulder.  He leaned forward and gave him a conspiratory wink, “but the real party is going to start later if you know what I mean.”
She nodded and looked over his shoulder at Cas, "don't worry. It isn't just you. I can tell." With that message she turned and deftly scrambled up the tree.
“Well, I was under the impression that on dates the two people usually ate at the same time. And well, you’re the one who wanted it to be a date.”
“You always do,” Dean said softly, almost reverently. The moment passed and he crossed his arms in front of himself defensively, “you didn’t answer my question.”
"She just stepped away to wash the knife. It will be only a minute until her return." Cas tilted his head, "do you need her for something?"
He knew he needed an arrow to make a tourniquet for Kevin’s leg. The knife wound was bleeding heavily and the best way Dean knew to help with the blood flow was to use one. There were twelve arrows there still for some reason. Had Charlie somehow managed to retrieve an arrow from Michael’s hand under his nose? He shook away his thoughts and grabbed one at random.
Dean bristled is annoyance, it might be true but lowering moral wasn't a great idea. "So what, we are the worst team in existence to pair with?"
“Zip up your coat,” she called out as they walked away. Gabe ignored her but Castiel zipped up his coat and watched her car drive off.
The rest of the classes leading up to lunch were uneventful. People kept staring at him and whispering but nothing monumental happened. His phone chirped as he was walking to his locker before lunch
“What?” Castiel asked, completely flustered. “He just kissed me. There was zero dry humping involved. Are people really saying that?”
Jo didn’t quite smile but her cheeks definitely turned a little pink. “That’s good.” She turned back to her painting. “That’s good.” Her voice was soft in a way Castiel had never heard before.
“Are you serious?” Dean gasped in mock betrayal. He snatched the Dorito bag from Castiel’s hand as he shook his head in confusion. “You've never seen Fight Club?” He grabbed the pencil and paper from Cas and scribbled something down. “Another part of the contract, you have to watch fight club with me.”
“I can sew it up if we find something to use for a needle.” She wordlessly grabbed a big leaf from one of the bushes nearby and some moss. She pressed down the moss and covered it with the leaf before tying it to him with a vine. “This should hold until we find Jo. It is just a flesh wound. If we get antibiotics or something soon you will be ok.” He nodded and she went to work on sorting through things.
“Huh...” Dean went over to the over and looked in on the pie and checked his watch. He set the timer on the stove for twenty minutes and turned to face Castiel who was staring at him pointedly. Dean seemed to go through an internal struggle as Castiel’s confidence wavered. Finally, Dean sighed. Castiel braced himself to be berated for even thinking about it.
She lost her angry expression for a scared one. “I don’t know. Kevin grabbed her and went in the opposite direction you went in. I figured they would be ok but I couldn’t leave you alone.”
Jo laughed at that. “I can’t believe that the famous Misha Collins is none other than dorky Castiel Novak. You know I saw Bella reading one the other day?”
He heard Dean pick up the lube again and do things Castiel couldn't see. Castiel could feel the bed move as Dean was getting settled between his thighs. Then a slick finger stroked over the pucker of Castiel's asshole. Castiel's first instinct was to clench closed. But three more tender strokes later, he exhaled and relaxed. He heard Dean's breath go ragged behind him before he felt the new, slow but relentless slide of Dean’s finger into his ass. And this time, there was no stopping until it's all the way inside him. Castiel heard a horrible mewling sound. He clamped his lips closed as he realized it was him.
The next day of training went a lot less productive, to say the least. Mostly because of that snob from district four who insisted on making conversation with him.
Castiel’s mouth snapped shut. How was he supposed to tell Dean that he was here because, despite everything, he was still ridiculously in love with him? How was he supposed to say that despite everything, Castiel was here because he had the faintest flicker of hope that maybe, just maybe, Dean was actually in love with Castiel too? That he had a good reason for everything with Bella.
Gadreel froze and turned around to see, nothing. Jo took advantage of his distraction and elbowed him in the sweet spot.
“I have no clue,” he whispered. He looked down at his top which was once again stained dark with blood.
“Where did you get this?” Dean asked while he looked down at it. Castiel took the borrowed time to think over what he had learned.
Gabe looked up at him in mock surprise. “Oh, haven’t you heard? This is an intervention to stop your moping around the house.”
“Can I just say, you throwing me around like this is insanely hot,” Dean grinned as Castiel threw him onto the bed. He rolled his eyes and leaned down to continue to kiss him.
Bella looked annoyed but she laughed. "Is there anything you wanted to tell the people back at home? To the audience."
Jody was thrilled when Castiel asked her to sign the permission slip. “Oh, Castiel, this is great. Did Dean convince you? You’ve been scared of skiing ever since you were ten and you did the splits and you couldn’t get back up!”
Dean thought back to the room. When he had walking in all the female gamemakers had been buzzing estatically. One of them had actually demanded the removal of his clothing. What he had done involved the paint though, those classes with Castiel seemed to pay off. He got five dummies, one for each career except Cas, and painted the faces of those careers. Then he got to work with he sword, slicing and dicing them to pieces. The gamemakers were silent as he left the room.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows and tilted his head in confusion. Dean had been acting weird since school started, and this just added to it. “I'm sorry, what?”
“Riiiight, okay?” Dean raises an eyebrow and held up his hands in mock surrender. “Sorry man didn’t mean to hit a sore spot. Sammy, come on let’s go.”
“Oh my god that’s awesome,” she fidgeted excitedly, “can you sign my book?” She pulled out a worn copy of ‘The Babysitter’ and passed it over to him. “It would be the awesomest thing ever.” Castiel smiled awkwardly and wrote his name in sloppy cursive inside the cover. He handed it back and she took it with a squeal, running off to show her friends.
“So that is how Mr. Novak knows Dean. She probably introduced him in passing and Mr. Novak made the mistake of talking about the car,” reasoned Krissy.
“I wrote five actually,” Castiel interrupted his sulking, “so don't go feeling too special. Also, not in love with you.”
“No, someone needs to cover our escape and let us face it, you would be useless at this. You cried when Gordon died and he was an asshole to everyone in training.”
“No,” Dean said softly, “I didn’t.” They sat there in silence. The tension that had been between them since the start began tangible at those words. Dean looked up at him and his green eyes caught the light in a way that showed the flecks of gold around the irises. Dean really was one of the most beautiful humans Castiel had ever seen.
"Dean..." Castiel sounded pained. Dean waited for the tears. His best friend since childhood was dead. Only psychopaths wouldn't be upset. No tears came.
Castiel wound his arms around his neck. “Touch my hair again,” Castiel said against Dean’s lips. He felt the corners of his mouth turn up. Castiel leaned into him again to kiss him better. Castiel moved his hands down his back and along his spine, and Dean shivered and pulled him closer.
She looked back in forth between all of them and frowned, “god dammit. Now I ship my teachers with youtubers.”
“It's how Scottish people say fun,” Alfie replied innocently, “right? Like, "You're a good craic." I looked it up.” Jody breathed a sigh of relief that she didn’t need to give her 11-year-old the drug talk.
Castiel tried to not get upset. After the whole ‘kissing Dean’ debacle, she had stopped talking to him and put his home phone number on a craigslist ad saying he was “a sexy single woman looking for a night of fun.” The calls that his dad got afterward made them need to change their home number and get craigslist to take down the ad. Bella ended up suspended and she hadn’t forgiven him since.
“Charlie is a tech wizard,” was all Jo said. She pulled out the last one and hesitated, “maybe I shouldn’t show you this one.”
“I am a fangirl. You are a fanboy. Together we are fan friend. Besides,” she added as an afterthought, “at least we don't write fanfiction.”
“I announce district twelve tributes, Dean Winchester and Joanna Beth Harvelle.” Tessa turned around and made a shooing motion, time to go. The peacekeepers began to herd them in the direction of the rooms where they would say goodbye to their family. Dean knew he had very few people who would want to see him. There was only three slots anyways for visitors so at least he wouldn’t seem pathetic. He was just hoping that Sam at least showed up, his dad most likely would just shake his head in disappointment.
Castiel looked at his brother, his cousin, and Sam who were all staring at him hopefully. The flicker in Castiel’s chest was now a flame, burning him from the inside. He looked down at the letter and sighed.
He came upon Dean sitting in the pool, looking pensive. Thankfully he was in his trunks, Castiel was sure if Dean had been completely nude he would not have been able to think straight. The shirtlessness was almost enough to completely distract him.
“Dean!” Lee sobered up enough to realize he had fucked up. “I’m sorry man, Cas just kissed me. I know he’s your boyfriend but-”
"Pass, maybe tomorrow if I live that long." They sat in silence for a little bit, a comfortable one opposed to an awkward one. Dean looked over at Castiel who was staring at the sky, lost in thought. He let his eyes trace his cheekbones and the outline of his messy black hair. The corner of his blue eyes was barely visible but illuminated in the moonlight. Dean felt the urge to lean against the other boy and shut his eyes but he refrained.
Sam filled them in as they moved the weapons to the trunk of the Impala. He found some news about a series of mysterious deaths in San Francisco that could catch the young huntresses’ attention.
“See, that’s where you are wrong, Chuck. A killer is not who I am,” Dean answered, still refusing to look at him. “I haven’t realized that for a long, long time. You
Chuck knew he was provoking them. He did that on purpose. In the ending he wrote previously, he tricked the Winchesters and kept some of his powers. Now he couldn’t and he really was ready to die. Otherwise, he’d have to live a regular, mortal life. And that’d be unacceptable.
“Are you really just letting me be?” There was despair in Chuck’s voice. “After everything I’ve done to you? You don’t want to punish me, to take your revenge?”
, but right now I don't feel like that's what you're doing.” Chuck looked at the woman sitting across from him. His face was twisted with anger. “I thought having you here would be nice, but now I’m starting to think working with Metatron back then was more fun.”
“So, it did turn out for good, didn't it? The best ending she could have was the one she made herself. People will like that.”
Chuck frowned, but remained silent. He was not going to explain to her in detail why some things did and some didn’t happen. There was no point in telling her he was not as powerful as before and some things were currently out of his reach.
“Speaking of Castiel, why is he not here anyway?” Becky shifted a few pages, as if she thought she missed some of them, and then looked up at Chuck. “He’s been around for, like, 11-12 years? And you didn’t even bother to let him make an appearance.”
Everything started a week ago, when one of a tv network’s employees died of a heart attack during a meeting at the headquarters. According to one of the witnesses, the woman was extremely pissed with some script they were discussing. After that, ‘weird things started to happen,’ said the article. Strange noises, moving furniture, lights blinking. Three days later, one of the company’s screenwriters slipped on the parking lot and hit a wall with a rod sticking out of it. He died in a hospital. Police department called it an accident and dropped the case.
For a long while, Becky went silent. She was just sitting there, observing him with those dark eyes. There was a peculiar look on her face - a mixture of sympathy, confusion and disappointment. “I know now.”
“Yeah, I mean… Didn't you say they're on their own now? And yet you wrote so much. In the previous chapter you made me read,” the look she gave him could easily kill. “You made Jack absorb your powers and they left you powerless.”
The Nephilim took a step closer. His eyes were shining brighter and brighter, as he sucked more and more of Chuck’s power. God fell to his knees, his face full of shock and despair. “Jack, please…”
“I am helping you, Chuck. Looking at you, I see my old self, you know? You got too involved. You have to let it go, Chuck. Instead of writing a fanfiction, just let the Winchesters make their own endings. Just sit back, grab some popcorn and watch the show.”
They looked at each other heavily. There was fire raging in their eyes. Chuck was first to turn his gaze away. He didn’t expect Becky to understand and now felt a hint of shame.
“Yeah, sure,” Dean took a quick glance at the documents and started filling the designated blanks with some random data, discreetly looking around. He noticed a security guard standing in the corner and cameras on the ceiling.
Castiel’s mouth fell open. “How’d you get those? I thought the shop didn’t open that early!” A week into their relationship Castiel and Dean had been on a run and ran by an old fashioned donut shop and bakery. They had stopped there for Dean’s never-ending cravings. They had gotten the donuts as a joke but they were the best thing on the planet, right under Dean’s apple pie.
Castiel’s heart was pounding a million beats a minute as he scooted closer to him, bending his neck up and pressing his lips against Dean’s. He felt Dean’s brief jolt of surprise.
“10, 9, 8,” Dean got in running position. He looked at the matches pointedly, if he couldn’t get anything else he would have that.
He looked up at the clock to check the time and sighed. “Your ten minutes are up.” Castiel stood up from the stool and began to move to walk to the door.
Dean felt Cas hold on tight to his hand as he jumped out of the tree, his knife swinging out to slash at the muzzle of the demonic hound who came sniffing at his ass. He dragged Cas behind him as he sprinted in the direction of the river, or what he hoped was the distance to the river.
“BOOM,” a canon went off. They both jumped in surprise. The sound of running footsteps could be heard from their left.
“Can we go back to you two talking shit about me behind my back?” Castiel asked, "cause that is something that is bothering me
Christmas vacation came and went. He heard back from Duke University and sent his own acceptance almost immediately. In all the drama with the ski trip, Castiel hadn’t noticed the acceptance letter sitting in his email but it had been a nice surprise. Aunt Jody had taken them all to the Roadhouse to celebrate.
Gabe opened his and started laughing. “Jody, I don’t think Cassie is gonna need these.” Castiel looked down into his own and felt his face burn up. Inside were at least four dozen condoms, neatly rolled up, and a bottle of lube.
“They were like that because there, in all of his glory was a man. He had Dark hair and wild blue eyes that seemed to search for and exit. He was obviously on edge but seemed to relax when Dean squeezed his hand.
Castiel nodded and motioned towards the packs, "we need to go hunting too. I checked for food earlier and we have very little left."
“You won’t even let me see them,” protested Dean, “how am I supposed to know you are not pulling my leg?”
Cas kissed next to his right eye and murmured on his skin, “Dean, I saw your soul in hell. I knew every aspect of you and I knew of the hurt you constantly felt. I can still see it when I look you in the eye. These years what with Lucifer possessing me and Sam, the leviathans, the death of much of your family, Amara, those haven’t been easy on you either. Yet here I am, and I am still choosing you. Pain and everything. I am more than happy to lend a shoulder or an ear anytime.”
“Aunt Jody please, for my sake. Stop talking. I promise you I haven't forgotten the speech you gave last night. And the night before.” Michael just hugged him tighter in response.
“Dean!” Charlie shouted a little behind him and he heard Jo swear and bark something at Castiel. He felt strong arms wrap around his back and underneath his knees and his feet leaving the ground.
Benny then turned to Castiel. “You get outta here with your boy before you kill somebody.” Dean still didn’t move to leave, glaring at Lee’s unconscious body. “Now,” Benny ordered in an unusually stern tone. Dean moves his glare up to Benny.
Jody chuckled and gestured towards Alfie, “I’ll tell you if you eat some salad with your grease.” Alfie obediently took a bite of his lettuce. Jody smiled, “It means he likes her.”
She rolled her eyes. “Anyways, in the right corner fighting for team Charlie we have the amazing, the beautiful, the person who is giving me a dirty look from behind camera, Jo!” A blonde girl jumped into the view of the camera wearing a pair of faded jeans and a loose fitted flannel.
Castiel let out a moan at the shocking sensation. He watched as Dean’s eyes went dark. He ripped off Castiel’s jeans and moved back up his body, tugging Castiel even closer so that their clothed cocks rub up against each other, and they both groaned at the sensation. Like Dean, Castiel was already fully hard, his boxers tenting obscenely in the front.
Sam was breathing heavily and glaring at Dean, “why did you volunteer?” He punched Dean in the gut again. “Do you think me too weak for the games? Why would you want to sacrifice yourself?” Sam sat down and put his head in his hands, “You basically sold your soul for me not to go into the games.”
He just started considering giving the intermediate slope a try, just for kicks, when he spotted Dean and all his friends carrying their snowboards. No Bella in sight. “Dean!” Castiel called out, feeling very relieved.
Once they were done Dean pulled out a bowl and put a large slice of the pie on the plate and a generous scoop of ice cream. He motioned for Castiel to follow and sit at the table next to him.
“It doesn’t matter, I already knew that.” Charlie had tried to tell him that a while back but Castiel didn’t put much stock in that. Bella was dating some college guy again so she had probably rejected Dean. “Look, I know Dean didn’t even like me back. I accepted that a while ago, I am just experiencing emotional turmoil after heartbreak which I understand is common.”
Castiel had been thinking about her words while he was traveling with Michael to the airport. He has been so spaced that he didn’t really process when they had arrived.
A couple of minutes later, Charlie and Castiel were sitting on his bed in his room. Charlie had stopped to get them hot chocolate and some gummy bears from the lodge’s convenience store. He managed to get through half his bag of gummy bears before Charlie’s patience ran out.
“Take your shirt off,” Castiel ordered. He was surprised at the authority in his tone as he said it. Dean’s eyes darkened as he backed away, undoing the buttons on the shirt as quickly as he could. At the sight of the wisps of chest hair Castiel felt his mouth go dry. Dean was taking too long.
Dean expected for her to jump the man but she just froze in shock. “Cas? I thought you were with the careers.”
"My dad killed himself and we were starving. School was optional and I was sixteen. Might as well drop out."
“Oh yeah, we’ll take him. Aunt Jody!” Gabe called out. Jody walked over from where Alfie was playing with a puppy.
"I'm fine Cas," he waved away his friend's concern though it gave him faint butterflies. "You should have seen Charlie though, that girl is badass."
Gabriel also got into college, miraculous with his record. With the help of Sam Winchester, he had apparently realized he really wanted to help kids dealing with the same trauma he had gone through as a kid and wanted to be a social worker, then possibly a therapist one day. He was going to a community college to complete his gen ed requirements before going to a state school for a double major in social work and psychology. Castiel had been really proud when Gabriel nervously told him his plan.
Now, the only thing that Castiel could hide behind was his own insecurity. His own doubt that Dean wouldn’t get back together with Bella at any moment. He already knew that Dean used to love him, and Castiel knew that he still loved Dean. He desperately wanted for Dean to say that he still loved him too.
The walked for hours in silence with little activity in the forest. No canons went off at all and no tributes were found. Charlie got hungry and they decided to try to hunt. Somehow Cas came back with a pile of birds and Charlie with a pile of root vegetables. All they were waiting on was Kevin and Jo with water bottles.
“Right. Ex-girlfriends.” A timer went off on the stove that Castiel hadn’t even seen him set. Dean left the scampi to simmer on the stove as he walked over to the fridge and pulled out the dough. He began to roll it out and shape it into a pie crust. They sat in comfortable silence as Dean worked.
“Don't worry Jo, I can assure you that the only reason I am still writing is that my contract asked for one more book like this. After I send this in, I am all done with trashy novels.”
“Same here,” Charlie added. They walked back into the party, thankfully not seeing Lee. Charlie walked with him over to the vacant couch and sat down with him, resting her legs on him and stealing a handful of jelly beans on the coffee table.
“I know, I know, I know. I fucked up. I should have stayed awake. He could have killed you guys while you slept.”
“Bitch.” Dean turned back to Castiel and realized he still had his arms around him. He smoothly slid his arms away and scratched his head. Castiel stepped back, glad to be free. “What are you doing home so early Sammy.”
The process Dean went through to understand what Castiel said was evident and his eyes widened in shock when it finally registered. “Wait, hold on, Milton? Doesn't she date your brother?”
A moment more and Dean's hand shifts on his stomach, roaming up onto his ribcage. The silence started to feel thick and heavy. Castiel knew he couldn't stay like this, leaned against Dean's chest all night, but...
“So I have heard,” he replied dryly. Sam opened his mouth to reply but a gruff voice interrupted him.
“He’ll get bored, he likes sex and frankly it is obvious that you have been holding out on him.” Bella stood up, “and when he realizes that you are a sexless joke, I will be here waiting.” With that Bella walked away, leaving behind a pit of unease in Castiel’s stomach.
Castiel walked forward and ripped the shirt open the rest of the way, spilling the buttons on the floor in the process. Dean chuckled, “impatient?”
Michael had always said that when something is no longer useful, you either donate it, recycle it, or throw it away. Castiel always knew he felt that way about objects but… he didn't think he could feel that about a person. After trying to talk to Anna after their breakup, Castiel had realized that wasn’t the case.
Castiel grabbed his coat and walked out of his room to Dean’s. His heart was thudding nervously as he raised his hand. He knocked twice.
Dean blinked, stunned for a moment, but then he beams. He leaned into Castiel for another short kiss.
“We walked all night to get here. Then we crashed for a couple hours. I went to get water and Lilith jumped me. Miraculously you guys showed up.” He looked to Charlie, “by the way, nice shot.”
The other man kissed him sweetly and held Dean closer to him. “You do know, heaven or hell, I will stand by you right?”
Dean could distantly hear Cas calling his name but all he could hear were the hounds, Jo’s scream. He could only see her peaceful smile, not even afraid of death.
“Fine,” Castiel said. He wracked his brain for a suitable trade-off, “then you have to watch Harry Potter with me.”
Dean was conflicted on whether or not he should support Cas joining or not. On one hand he was the enemy just like everyone else. Also their group was pretty large without having to defend another member or share supplies with. Another thing was Cas could be spying go the careers. Why has he left them in the first place?
Charlie was bubbly and cheerful. She drew Castiel out of his quiet she'll and had them all playing some game she called picnic. What happened was she would say something that started with the first letter of the alphabet like "I'm going on a picnic and I am bringing aluminum foil." Then she had Cas go with the next letter in the alphabet and including what she had said before. "I'm going on a picnic and I'm bringing aluminum foil and bees." ("How do you plan on bringing bees Cas?" "You underestimate my determination Dean.")
“Don’t apologize, I am always excited to be upstaged by my students,” she placed both hands on the desk and leaned forward with a smug smile, “well?”
Castiel pulled away and stared at Dean with a knowing look. There was no way to get out of this one. Dean looked away but Cas turned his head to look back at him with a tender gaze, “Dean?”
Castiel had been smiling but he turned his lips down to a frown. "Do you really not have lawyers? What kind of place doesn't have lawyers?"
After Bella left, Dean came back and gave him his cup which he gratefully drank. It was surprisingly good and had a familiar burn as it went down. He tried to pretend that everything was okay, but Dean had always been able to read Castiel like an open book..
“When he slid into the seat next to her, Jo was shaking her head at him. So was Charlie in the seat on the other side of the aisle.
“Very,” Castiel said darkly. He pulled Dean against his chest, letting Dean feel the swelling of his cock against his leg.
Dean was taking back any critics he had against Charlie being a psychic. The river flowing in front of them was surrounded by bootprints heading upstream. The footprints belonged to two men and a woman for about ten yards before one of the men had left the riverbank, presumably to head off somewhere. The prints were all relatively fresh so they would have had to been walking while Dean and Charlie were asleep.
“Which was technically last year.” Jesse just smiled in defeat while she grinned widely. “But did he really upload?”
“Did you get any more work done for your portfolio?” Castiel inquired as he played with a pile of chalkdust on a table.
And then the great Dean Winchester, king of the school and resident fuck boy extraordinaire, blushed, unable to look at him, and buried his face in the crook of Castiel's neck to finish. Castiel cupped the back of his head. Before he could think, he kissed Dean's temple.
Castiel released Dean's erect cock and wrapped his legs around Dean's waist. "I'm not afraid," he whispered.
“...will depart from Gate 39.” A clear voice rang out over the speaker over Castiel’s head, causing him to jump. Michael laughed at Castiel’s startled expression.
And then he was kissing Castiel back, open-mouthed, soft-lipped kissing-him-back, and at first. Castiel nearly sobbed in relief as Dean put his hand on the back of his head to pull him closer. Despite all of their kisses before and the fact that they had already had sex, this felt like the most intimate kiss they had ever had. It was a good thing that Dean had an arm wrapped around his waist because Castiel was weak in the knees.
Her expression faltered for a second, “I just know they will be there okay. Just, ugh, just have a little faith?”
Castiel stopped and stared it down, not sure what to say. So instead he kept reading. There were several dirty ones in the mix and many things talking about little things Castiel had said or done during the day before which had made Dean supposedly ‘loved’ him. The last note was dated the day before the ski trip.
Charlie grinned wickedly, “I made every single knot they taught us while I listed the characteristics of poisonous insects and berries.”
The pack was a sky blue color which Dean liked quite a bit for some reason. He opened it up and Charlie sorted through. She took out a thermal blanket, a sleeve of crackers, a water bottle, some thread, some nylon rope, a package of bread (Charlie says is from district four), and some iodine. Dean showed her the bottle, matches and lighter he grabbed. He took the bow, it was silver, and the twelve arrows, handing them so her. “I am crappy with those things.”
“Don’t even bother Charlie,” Jo interrupted her, “he volunteered for his brother. Telling him to stop with the self sacrificing bullshit is like talking to a wall. Now if you dumbasses don’t mind Kevin would probably really appreciate your help right now.”
"Please…" Castiel whined, and Dean answered without pause, fucking his finger in and out, tickling with the tip on the retreat only to thrust easily past his thick knuckle in the next breath. Castiel clutched at him, cock leaking out a whole stream of pre-come at the delightful burn of friction as Dean went a little faster. Castiel widens trembling legs. He didn't know. He just didn't know this could feel so good.
Dean coughed, “do you mind if I get something to drink?” Castiel just waved him off as he kept eating. He looked up and noticed the world seemed to be moving just half a second slow. Must be the alcohol. Dean sat down with a glass with a little bit of amber liquid swimming around in it and started to eat his scampi. He wondered what it would taste like.
Dean gave him a half-smile. “Will you give me just ten minutes. Ten minutes to explain everything.” Castiel repressed a smile, so Dean had gotten his message. He nodded mutely in agreement. A wide smile of relief stretched across Dean’s face. He took a step back and held the door gesturing for Castiel to come inside.
Dean looked at himself on the television in horror as he volunteered to take Sam’s place. “Geez, was I really that desperate looking?” He asked Jo.
“That just made it even better.” Castiel sat for a minute, trying to comprehend his apparent fame. Dean started the car and began driving. He cleared his throat, “so why did you ask me for a ride? I know you hate driving and all, but you are still capable.”
Then, one day Dean would write Castiel a love letter. A full one, not just a little note every single day. Only the letter would be read out loud in front of their friends and family and accompanied by rings at the same place Dean’s parents got married. Things would be perfect.
Dean was ignored again as the other boy stuck a knife in the fire. He held up the glowing hot knife and stared at Dean with a grim expression.
“He’ll get bored of you ya know,” Bella said. Her tone wasn’t mean, she just said it the way one might say that it was going to be sunny or that the wanted to watch television.”
“Pay attention, you know what Ms. Harvelle did last time we didn’t. I couldn’t get the smell of tuna off my hands for weeks.”
“Take this off,” Castiel mumbled against Dean’s mouth in between frantic kisses, tugging at Dean’s swim trunks. Dean slid the trunks off, and Castiel promptly swiped the garment right off the bed with an impatient hand. The trunks landed on the floor with a very soft thud.
“Obviously because it was more fun that way.” She slung her arm around Castiel’s shoulder. “It’s going to be an interesting weekend, Novak.”
His hand was still under Castiel's chin and the boy reached up to wrap his hand around Dean's. "Why wouldn't I want to help the boy who puts everyone above himself. Who loves quickly and is brave enough to put himself in the line of fire. Why wouldn't I want to help a righteous man when he is put in the position where he goes against his innate instinct to help?"
The other boy tilted his head, "I hardly believe you believe anybody thinks you are stupid enough to be like that imbecile. Perhaps you have a case of narcissism to your skill set and don't think you need to practice." He held out his hand, "my name is Castiel. I believe I never had a chance to introduce myself when we had first encountered each other."
Castiel shooed her and opened his locker. He opened his bag and put his textbooks away, “since when does being almost six feet tall equate to being hot?”
“Besides, if you wanna get drunk the wine isn’t the way to go. A glass of that will just make you a little buzzed.” Dean started cooking the scampi. He looked up to see the apples all done. “Mix those in a little lemon juice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and butter and you are golden.” Castiel followed his orders, adding what he knew was way too much cinnamon. Dean said it was fine and added two spoonfuls of vanilla extract.
Castiel carried Dean over to the bed with him still wrapped around him. He nearly stumbled when Dean moved his lips to his neck and began to suck a mark into his skin.
But tonight Dean said he liked Castiel. The best thing he could have possibly been hoping for. So why couldn’t Castiel just
“For starters, when Bella heard you kissed me, she went nuts, and if she thinks you and I are a thing, she'll want to get back together.” That made a lot more sense.
“Finding out how you managed to get Dean Winchester to dry hump you in the middle of the baseball diamond.”
She looked at him incredulously, “of course dumbass.” She took off running in the direction but Dean knew she wouldn’t reach him in time. The boy’s voice had to be at least a quarter mile away.
Jo stretched out with a small yawn, “I know you’re all about hoes before bros, but if I were you, I’d be careful. Bella’s a barracuda.”
“I have not the slightest clue. You should go ask.” He teased. She sat up straight, taking him for literal. She started walking in their direction. “Jo wait,” Dean hissed.
“Come on Castiel,” she said good-naturedly when she saw the look on her face, “It's only gonna take a second. Just smile.” He groaned but stood next to his brother and cousin.
“Dean we need to get your jacket off okay?” The hand Cas didn't have on Dean's wound was setting up a fire with the sticks as Charlie tried to start a flame.
Crowley laughed, “oh if I got paid a thousand dollars every time somebody was stupid enough to ask me that, I would have a thousand dollars.” So yes then, great.
“Deal.” Castiel sent a quick text letting Jody know he was staying at Dean’s for the night so he wouldn’t be driving late. Dean nodded and poured Castiel a glass before going back to cooking.
By time what Cas said registered in his mind Jo had his arms behind his back and Cas had his legs wrapped around his body and pinned. Charlie unzipped his jacket and pushed up his shirt. He fought to get his arms free as Jo gasped in surprise. “Dean, why in all hell did you let it get that bad.”
Somebody slammed the locker door in front of him and dramatically draped herself across the locker in front of him.
“Looking at you being irresponsible,” Bella spoke up. They both looked up at the same time. Castiel had almost forgotten that she was there. “How you been Dean?”
Castiel pressed himself as close as he could to Dean, running his hands up and down his body. He wanted more, to touch more, to be closer. He tucked his hands under Dean’s shirt, feeling at his bare skin.
“Yeah, and I have four of them,” Dean reminded him. Castiel thought it over and vaguely remembered seeing the shirt multiple times in Dean’s drawer.
Castiel was dead. He had hit his head when he fainted and went to hell. Because Dean Winchester asking him to pretend to be in a relationship in front of the entire school and his brother’s ex-girlfriend finding out he had a crush on her occurred on the same day were two very strange but specific disasters to punish him with.
“I think you made it know after making sure we were caught making out in the bathroom, the classroom, the cafeteria-”
“Bobby, both Dean and I have tried to explain. Making him eat salad is like making him eat poop. Get him some meat.” Dean nodded appreciatively in Jo’s direction.
“Cas gets to try the first bite,” Dean said as he pulled it out of the oven. Instantly the room smelled of apple and cinnamon.
He just stared at her blankly and pointed towards the roots hanging from the top of the little hole. “Gee, I wonder why is would be a bad idea to light a fire with so many flammable substances.”
Castiel’s climax came to an end, he sagged against the bed as Dean continued to pump in and out of his body. He was unbelievably sensitive all over. He looked up at Dean’s face who was staring at him like he had just witnessed a miracle.
“Well, you wanna adopt him?” Ruby smiled as she asked. Castiel looked down at Luke again and gave him forehead a quick scratch. The dog looked up at him with sleepy happy eyes and jumped up to lick his face, accidentally unbalancing himself in his excitement. Castiel sat down and let the dog wiggle into his lap and lay down, letting out a noise of surprise at how heavy it was.
“Is this a bad time?” Castiel asked. When Dean just cocked his head in confusion he gestured towards the keys in his hand.
Another boy was absolutely huge. He had kind features though. He had long brown hair and eyes that seemed to change color.
“Oh... Okay. Wha…” Dean was bright red and extremely flustered. He kept gaping at Castiel like a fish and stared at him blankly. Castiel looked up to see Anna had frozen where she stood and staring at him
“She was doing to good too.” His shoulders slumped. He turned his head to the living room, “Maybe she is asleep?”
"I like your toy." He said before reaching for his pack. Then he remembered that Charlie still had his knife. Shit.
Aunt Jody smiled at him with tears welling up in her eyes. “That's Road & Track, it doesn't sound that interesting, but if you stick with it…” Jody cut herself off with a choked laugh and pulled him into a hug, “Come here kid.”
He smiled, “yeah. What can I say, I’m a sucker for a good love story. I am sure my friend will agree to let you team.” Jo and Bobby were so going to kill him.
“Tributes step on plates in one minute,” a clear voice rang out through the room. Dean began to panic.
The boy holding him ran away from the wall of hounds, all fighting for a piece of the blonde girl. Dean could see Charlie running side by side with him. After what seemed to be a moment the hounds disappeared from view and water began splashing at his back. They were at the river.
Dean smiled sadly, “yeah. She wanted me to be able to make it for my dad whenever he missed her.” Castiel instantly felt bad for bringing it up. Not many people in school knew what happened to Dean’s mom. Castiel himself only knew because he had been friends when it happened.
“Holy crap nuggets,” breathed Krissy. Jesse was too busy staring open mouthed at the woman on screen.
Dean took his fingers out of Cas’s hair and fumbled with the tie eagerly. Cas meanwhile worked on unbuttoning Dean’s pants.
“5, 4, 3,” Dean looked up to see Castiel staring at him, shaking his head. “2,” what was wrong with him. “1.”
“Relax man, he’s getting to know you. Let him sniff your hand and let him. Er well,” the kid blushed, “her.”
At one point Gabe tried to convince Jody who was still sniffling over Michael leaving. After an hour of arguing Castiel then found himself at a pet shelter on the main street.
“Yeah no, you’re fine,” Castiel assured him. Since baseball had gotten into full swing, Dean had been unable to drive them a lot. Practice before school started on Mondays and after school on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Castiel ended up staying for Dean's games on Wednesdays, per the contract, so Gabe had taken to driving Alfie home on those days.
Turns out he wasn’t. He was also absolutely horrible at trying to be unnoticeable. It was halfway into his fire building training session when the redhead, Charlie, over to talk to him. “Heya Dean. You know me?”
Dean felt himself breath as memories of Castiel enthusing over those dumb flowers with an equally dumb expression on his face. He felt himself blush but kept his knife out in defense. “Maybe ‘cause we are in and arena in a fight to the death?”
“Maybe I should move to France,” Castiel mused to himself. “I speak french fluently, maybe they won’t follow me there?”
At six-thirty in the morning the day of the ski trip, Jody dropped Castiel and Gabe off at school. It wasn't even light out yet. Gabriel was half asleep, blinking at the rising sun.
Dean was equally confused, “I don’t know but I say we take his advice. He did just save us from becoming shish kebabs.”
“Oh come on, girls and guys would go nuts over those pretty blues, cheer up the dying patients and young children."
Before the girls could confuse him further, Dean finally came into view holding two red cups. When he saw Castiel he awkwardly waved one hand and began to make his way over.
Thanks to her, the middle school dance had actually been fun. Afterward, he had been so giddy with excitement over somebody going out of their way to talk to him that he had developed a crush on her. He wrote down about how her words put him at ease and how he could listen to her talk forever.
That left Castiel and Dean standing in the lobby, neither of them saying anything. Neither of them broke eye contact.  Castiel finally spoke first.
Charlie and Jo had met them when they arrived, forming a wall around Castiel to fend off Dean and anybody trying to tease him about the sex tape. He had insisted it wasn’t necessary but Charlie confessed Jo just wanted an excuse to intimidate freshmen.
She glared at him and another wave of sobs wracked through her. "I will go if you tell me what Cas' deal is."
Dean knew that Jo had a small bottle of lighter fluid she had snagged from the center. She was very proud of herself for somehow grabbing the most flammable thing in the arena.
“Hold on. Stop.” Dean held up his hand with a confused look on his face. “I'm not the only person that got a letter?” Castiel shook his head slowly. Dean let out a breath and leaned back. “Wow, you really think you're special, then you find out he wrote two people love letters.”
The boy looked at the man in front of him who was bloody and beaten.  He dropped his knife and walked over to a tree where he curled up into a fetal position. Dean just stared in confusion before waking over to the girls who were crying.
“What’s so funny?” Alfie asked cheerfully. The three boys turned to see their little cousin wearing a crown holding a back from burger king walking towards them. Their aunt was walking next to him and rolled her eyes in annoyance as she followed after him.
Sure enough, it was only an hour later that they could hear the sounds of people crashing through the trees and shrubbery. Gordon froze and reached for his bag, but he was to late to run.
“Yes, I’m being you for Halloween. Watch this.” Castiel grabbed a rule from his desk and pretended to swing at an imaginary ball.
“No running on the stairs!” Jody called after him, then the sound of her walking down the stairs to her office followed her order.
"Joanna Harvelle if we get killed because you can't stand to leave Kevin do you think he would forgive you?"
“Well great, cause Bella was asking for you.” Castiel felt his heart drop in his chest at the reminder. The reminder that what Dean and he had was fake. Castiel ducked his head and he pulled his hand away from Dean.
“Duh,” Dean rolled his eyes “first rule of fight club.” He fished around the bag of chips and shook the last of the crumbs into his mouth. “Man I love Doritos.”
“Castiel Novak,” Charlie grabbed him and dragged him to the back of the classroom to sit down. “Would you like to explain to me how you left out have Dean Winchester’s eyes on your ass in like
The logo disappeared and Dean breathed a sigh of relief along with Charlie. Their friends were alive.
Dean was still watching him warily, Castiel’s heart was racing out of control and it’s difficult to look him in the eyes. He’d never been so scared in his life. Soon enough, Dean was stood in front of him.
After that, Jo was rarely seen without Charlie following her around bragging about being her girlfriend to anybody that gave her the time of day. Castiel saw Kali giving them a sour look at one point but then she rolled her eyes and walked away.
“I don’t know, but I am loving this,” Gabe said excitedly. He ran over towards a small kitten who was playing with a scratching post. Castiel decided to remain where he was while the rest of his family was going around looking at pets that Jody would eventually say no to when she regained her senses.
Dean looked up at him after that, eyes searching Castiel's face. Whatever he saw made him take a step forward, edging slightly into Castiel’s space. They were so close, all he would need to do to close the gap would be take a step forward. He could smell Dean’s intoxicating scent of apples, wood, and something that was just completely Dean. Castiel averted his eyes to the floor.
“Bella and I are in a really weird place right now.” Dean continued speaking, “also I’m not gay, so I don't know what you hoped to accomplish--whoa!” Castiel had stopped focusing as his world got dizzy. Black swirling in his vision until eventually, it was all he could see.
The careers from districts one and two looked like big competition, emphasis on big. The district one man, Michael, had black hair and dark eyes. The man from district two, Lucifer, had sandy hair and an air of mischief.
“Which doesn’t start for twenty minutes,” Dean mused. Castiel looked up at Dean’s wide-eyed innocent expression.
It was rather terrifying, having all three of them charging at once. Dean held up his knife defensively and prepared to be shikebabed. But then he heard a faint swishing noise as a boy dropped down from a tree directly onto Lilith. He could hear her shout in surprise and the other boys stopped mid charge to look. Lucifer and Michael were distracted and stunned and Dean took that opportunity to run to the root and quietly leap over the edge.
In middle school, he and Dean had been best friends along with Bella and Anna. At Bella's birthday party in middle school, she had pulled Cas to the side.
“Okay Kevin, I'm gonna butt boost you on three.” Kevin nodded and held up his hands for Charlie to grab. “One, two, three!” Dean put his hands underneath Kevin’s ass and shoved upwards. Once his torso was over the edge of the hole Dean grabbed Kevin’s good leg and push him up and out by his feet.
“I have no clue.” Dean’s voice felt strained. “ Mutts definitely but the games usually don't set the more powerful ones on groups of allies this early in the games.”
“Wow, that’s ice cold.” The kid smiled crookedly and laughed, “well same goes for me and my brother. But I figured I would hang out with this good boy while I wait for him to change his mind.”
. Castiel thought to himself. He moved close enough to Dean that his lips tickled his ear when he whispered.
After a few minutes, Dean had finished rolling out the crust. He pulled two bowls and forks from the cupboard and portioned out the scampi.
Though Dean was loath to admit it, when Cas looked at him with those big baby blues it caused his stomach to flutter a little. Most likely the wound acting up.
Dean just kept his gaze averted and continued on with his story. “Bella had been harassing me about getting back together, so after you told me you wanted to try this thing for real I wanted her to back off. I went to tell her to leave me and my boyfriend alone, that me and her were over for real.” Dean looked back up at Castiel, “then I saw texts from Sammy freaking out because you caught him with his secret boyfriend so I went there and passed out in his room.”
Kevin frowned, "as much as I hate it we have to kill to get out of here." It was then that Dean felt a piece of his heart break. Kevin was no more than twelve years old and he was willing to kill.
"Maybe he wanted to be alone for a little." She shrugged. He nodded and went to picking at the bandage while she sat beside him on the dirt. Charlie rested her head on his knee and looked up at him. "He never left your side while you were out you know."
"Christ, Angel..." Dean pushed in again, but this time he didn't relent, and with a gasp from both of them, the tip of his index finger dipped inside.
“True, but I figured you wouldn’t want to be home right now.” Castiel knew that Dean was right but didn’t want Dean to know he won so he didn’t reply. Instead, he typed a message in his phone to his aunt.
It was longer than the one he had planted on Dean yesterday and much more effortless than he had been in his panic. Castiel had to admit that, when Dean was actively participating in it, kissing it wasn’t horrible.
Another week later, Castiel and Jo were doing laps for gym class. Despite his jogging over the summer, Jo was easily beating him in the race that they were not having. They had already lapped everyone else.
“I know. I remember.” Aunt Jody then reached down and pulled out two large manilla envelopes. Gabriel took his with a shrug and Castiel hesitantly grabbed the other one.
“Yeah, I don’t think that will be a problem.” He finished his glass while Dean put the pie in the oven and pulled out all the brownies, leaving them on the counter to cool. Castiel waited for Dean to sit down before he took his first bite.
“Ooh, who knew. Sass does go to the man with a perfect ass.” Meg nodded to the district six girl who walked forward and sank a knife into the little girls chest. Dean stared at the little girl, masking his horror with a laugh. Meg raised her eyebrow, “what is so funny.”
“Here,” Dean slid him one of the bowls. “Peel the apples and cube them” Castiel had no idea what that meant and told Dean as much. Dean took out a large knife and a potato peeler.
Realizing what Dean was so interested in, Castiel gave him what he hoped looked like a seductive smile. He reached down, playing with the edge of the shirt. Dean watched, utterly entranced.
The girl holding the remote flashed a glare, “It's loading dumbass. Give me a break. Then she added as an afterthought, “also don't eat all the popcorn. He just stuck his tongue out and threw a piece at her.
Sam flushed bright red, “please don’t tell Dean. He’ll never stop harassing me for having sex on the ski trip.”
Lucifer, Jo, Lilith, Kevin and Dean all stopped to stare at Michael simultaneously. “Brother, if you just said boo boo then I am going to need to rethink our alliance.” Lilith and Lucifer all started laughing, like on hands and knees laughing.
The kiss was pure and sweet, none of the usual heat behind their kiss. It felt soft, comfortable, like coming home. Dean instantly wrapped his arms around Castiel’s waist and pulled him flush against his body as he returned the kiss with enthusiasm.
Charlie smiled in relief, “oh good. But that doesn’t mean you don’t like me in a platonic way right?” Castiel nodded warily in agreement. Charlie beamed, “now that I know you like listening to me talk, good luck ever getting rid of me.”
After school on the bus Krissy was convinced that everyone had gone bloody mental, including Jesse. He was kind of flopping around in his seat repeatedly whispering “oh my gosh Krissy.” He turned to her with wide eyes that begged her to understand, making those weird gasping sounds.
Dean held down one finger, another and as he pushed down the last one he leaned towards his tree and grabbing his hand. “
“Oh my god Castiel,” she chortled, “the first rule of buddy fucking is that no feelings can be involved.”
“Son of a bitch,” he muttered before running after her. “Charlie wait up!” He caught up to her in less than four stride and kept running towards the noise. “I’ll see if I can help, if I shout Poughkeepsie then drop everything and run.”
He looked up and around for a second and made eye contact with Castiel. Dean offered him a half-smile and waved him over before turning back to his work. Castiel steeled his nerves and walked over.
“Just remember,” Charlie said in a cheerful voice, “you are trapped with me for the rest of the period!” Castiel buried his face in his hands in defeat.
“Aquila was a gentle soul who was made to do horrible things. She was slaughtered in cold blood for it too.” Castiel shifted, “isn’t it truly awful?” Dean looked over as Castiel and momentarily lost his breath at the intensity of his blue eyes. “Just because you are put in a situation where you are made to kill doesn't mean you are a horrible person.” Dean got his message.
Dean stood up, “Cas, I am gonna die. Whether it is now or and old age I will die and I will be all crippled. I could lose my sight, have cancer and no longer be strong enough to walk. How do you think it will be for me when you no longer want me because you are still all young and, you?”
Castiel nodded back. “Mm-hmm.” Dean was pissed because of the same reason as always, he didn’t get to make Bella jealous.
“I have no idea what you are saying to me,” was the only response Castiel could think of. Charlie snorted.
Surprisingly enough, Dean had kept the ‘no talking to Bella’ promise pretty well. When talking with Castiel in the hallway he would act like she didn’t exist as she passed by. It was very impressive. Strangely, Bella hadn’t tried to attack Castiel or make his life miserable, but he was preparing himself mentally just in case.
Dean shook himself out of the daze and sprinted forward, scooping up the  matches and  then ran to the backpack and bottle. He shoved the matched in the front as he ran to the shiny object. It was not a knife but a lighter. Dean grabbed it anyways. He knew Charlie was going to kill him when he made the split second decision to abort the plan to stay away from the mouth and ran straight towards the weapons. It only took him a second to grab a dagger and a bow. There were three quivers of arrows and he scooped one up and turned to run away, coming face to face with Anna.
