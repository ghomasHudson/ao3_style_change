“Uh Sherlock mate… hello?” John had noticed Sherlock’s odd way of looking at him as soon as it had started. He was being looked at as though he were evidence at a crime scene and it was certainly making him more than a little uneasy. He was being analysed and it felt like any aspect of privacy he may have once had was long gone. Christ, he suddenly felt bad for the people Sherlock did this to on a regular basis for a case! Swallowing his anxiety, John tried to act normal, which was bloody difficult when you have someone like Sherlock monitoring all of your basic body language and reading you like an open book. Concern flashed through John at that moment, ‘What if he realizes how I feel? No… he wouldn’t believe it even if he did come to that conclusion. Surely he wouldn’t…’ Panic swelled in his chest, Sherlock had never known about John’s emotionally attachment in the past and that had been good but now, if he knew, how would he react. Not well was the most likely answer to this. He would probably tell John about how love was a chemical defect found on the losing side and begin avoiding him. Or maybe he would be disgusted. What if he wanted him to leave? All of the horrific possibilities were too much to bear and before John knew it, he was up and heading to his room, “Gotta dash, can’t be late for work. I’ll wash up when I get home” he called behind him, swiftly rushing upstairs.
“Alright alright, I’m coming” John chuckled.
When they arrived at 221b, John paid the driver as per usual and got out of the cab, looking back to see Sherlock had followed swiftly. Up they went into the livingroom and the abandoned their shoes and coats by the door before both falling onto the sofa. “I’m beat… fancy a cuppa?” John asked, rolling his head to the side to see Sherlock sitting beside him in a clearly thoughtful state. This was going to be harder than he thought. Shifting over, John sat closer to Sherlock, but not close enough that they would touch. The last thing he wanted to do at the end of all of this was spook the clearly concerned detective. It was like approaching a startled deer at this point, he was afraid that one wrong move would send the other sprinting in a panic. “Sherlock?”
Delighted by the reaction he got, John pulled back to admire his work. On the side of Sherlock’s ivory pale neck, there was a light purple mark forming. Now as a medical professional, John knew the dangers of hickeys and should have been repulsed by his own negligence but there was just something so deep and primal about marking your partner. Smiling to himself, he leant back down and licked a stripe from Sherlock’s collar bone, up over the mark before teasing lightly at the detective’s ear, giving it a playful nip and whispering, “What is it love?” he asked.
“For God’s sake John this is tedious! Either kiss me or don’t but for the love of all things Holy, quit this nervous behaviour! You can shag every woman you pull back here on a drunken night out but apparently you are entirely incapable of making a relationship with me the least bit intimate without some constant stream of consent? Is that it? Do I have to approve everything and sit back like some inexperienced chi-...” The next thing Sherlock knew was that he was laying on his back on the sofa, John was straddled over the top of him, hands rested on the sofa either side of his head. Stunned, Sherlock couldn’t even bring himself to speak before John leant down and claimed his lips. The kiss was more than just a kiss, it was like he was being claimed. John’s lips were firm and strong against his own and the way he had moved with such confidence had left Sherlock pliant below him. Moments went by before Sherlock had the ability to bring himself back from the various reaches of his mind, when he did however, he moved himself a little and managed to reach up and wrap his arms around John, pulling him closer. The feeling surging through him was electrifying, it made all of his nerves tingle and as quickly as it had started, John pulled back and smiled down at him.
“Of course. I’ll join you if that’s alright?” he asked, feeling that same flutter for some bizarre reason. Perhaps he was coming down with something? No, he had no idea what these sorts of symptoms were related to, it could be absolutely anything. Instead of trying to deduce the issue, Sherlock simply let go of John, hanging his belstaff up and taking off his shoes as he waited for an answer.
“Sherlock! Get your arse in gear and go get him!” the DI implored, his voice gaining volume as the frustration rose in his chest. “Or do I have to do it myself?”
A few weeks went by, nothing unusual happened and certainly nothing noteworthy. Despite the development in their relationship, things in the flat didn’t change a whole lot. John quickly found himself in the same old rut he had been in year in year out: working some days, completing cases on others, getting takeout etcetera. The only difference now seemed to be the occasional sexual intimacy that Sherlock invoked from time to time but that was for experimental purposes John soon found out. It had been a bit of a blow if he was honest, they were laying in bed one morning and Sherlock turned to him stating something along the lines of, ‘John I want to try a new technique. Apparently the victim of the killer had a specific reputation in the local strip clubs for giving a blowjob with a twist. If i can understand its power over the rate at which…’ John had cut him off there and then. This was hardly the romantic  relationship he had dreamed of. Storming away, John went into the bathroom and locked the door behind him with a bit more force that was technically necessary.  “What did I expect?” he sighed to himself, looking in the mirror at his own disappointed appearance. Any attempt at being romantic for the sake of it seemed to get either brushed aside or rushed along after a while, Sherlock always seemed to find a reason why they couldn’t go out on a date or just cuddle and watch the telly.  From an outside perspective, people would probably tell him that he should have expected this, that he should have known things wouldn’t turn out as he had hoped, but for some reason he had foolishly wanted something more than to become further aid on cases. Ok Sherlock warned him, but even then he had someone come to hope that things would be different. Shaking all of the disappointment he could manage to away, John returned to the bedroom to find Sherlock long since gone. Great, who knew what results this would  bring along?
I’m sorry. -SH
After a while, John backed off, his heart hammering in his chest by this point. He could have leaned in at that moment, closed the distance, God knows he wanted to but at the end of the day what if he did? What if Sherlock didn’t feel that way? There had to be a better and safer way for him to show his affections to the detective without potentially destroying their friendship in the process. How can you tell someone you love them without ruining everything? He knew that he couldn’t just blurt it out, it wouldn’t work. Sherlock would hardly believe him and even if he did, what if he responded badly? John knew his views on love and relationships, they weren’t exactly fantastic. Sighing, he let go of Sherlock and sat himself up, looking down and realizing suddenly that they were both very much not dressed. He peeked under the covers and found, to his relief, that he was in fact wearing underwear. The relief didn’t last long, upon looking down, John saw his stomach sitting a little too roundly for his liking. After the incident with Mary, John had put on a few pounds and it showed. Shame at his physical condition came over him and he quickly put the covers back in place. He went to look away from Sherlock and it was then that his eyes caught sight of the scar on his own shoulder and he winced, pulling the covers up to shield it from both his and the detective’s view. He looked quickly around the room for a shirt and saw one on the floor. Reaching for it, he grabbed the fabric and swiftly pulled it over himself, the baggy design was one he was very grateful for at this time. “I uh… breakfast?” he offered, looking back to Sherlock with a smile. The smile faded though when he realized Sherlock was now sitting up himself and watching him with confusion, his grey eyes looking directly at where John’s scar was now hidden. “Sherlock?” he dared to try and get the man’s attention, his voice cracking slightly.
Thanks for keeping up with it :)
The cab ride had been crushing for John, the silence hanging in the air and his heart feeling like it might beat right out of his chest. Sherlock had sat in sheer silence, staring out at the city streets as they passed them by. He knew deep down that sherlock was probably thinking to start with but… for the whole cab ride? No. Soon enough, when they were a few streets down from Baker Street, John realized Sherlock was talking to him and he looked up carefully, “Sorry what?” he asked, trying to refocus himself and not look like a rejected teenager who was sulking.
“How did you know?” John whispered in awe.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock tried momentarily to compute what was happening but he failed for a few moments before he was capable of processing it. John being so close was stunning, he missed the warmth of the other’s body from those nights they had spent at each other's sides. He missed the smell, the comfort and the safety of being in his blogger’s arms. “I like it” he commented, leaning into the touch and resting his head on John’s shoulder. That was better. He could easily get used to this after a tough case. His mind slid into a comfortable quiet as his body relaxed. Perhaps this wouldn’t be as complicated as he had first anticipated, oddly enough this sort of behaviour had once repelled him and yet now, Sherlock found himself in a state of contentment due to it all. He could think into the psychological reasons for that later on, right now however, he was happy to simply rest there and let his thoughts fal away until nothing was left but John.
John had honestly expected some kind of rejection, he hadn’t expected Sherlock to turn around and want to stay with him for nights on end. He wasn’t complaining in any way, but he was a little concerned as he usually needed some… privacy. He could put that sort of thing on hold for a while surely? At the end of the day, he wasn’t a teenager anymore, it would only be for a while, he could do that. “Sounds good” he managed to say as they arrived at 221b. John paid the driver as always and they headed inside. It was nice to get back into the warm and John shed his coat and shoes the second he could before heading towards his room, “I’m going to lay down, feel free to come join me whenever ok?” he said with a small smile before heading towards his room. He was stopped however by a hand on his wrist and looked back to see a slightly bashful Sherlock.
Time to push on and set the ball rolling.
“I’d rather come in now… if you’ll let me” the detective said a little quieter.
Kissing. John was kissing him? John ‘I’m not gay’ Watson. John ‘I’m not his date’ Watson. Why was he doing that? It made absolutely no sense! Sherlock didn’t even have the time to respond before John spoke and then he felt like a belt had tightened around his heart. There was that word again. Love. The next thing he knew he was still laying on the pavement with John holding out a hand for him to hold. It was as though his reality had broken around him and he was suspended in time and space, but he knew he would inevitably have to move. After a moment of deliberation, Sherlock took John’s hand and stood, “You love me?” he asked, his mind not all there as he tried to analyse John’s expression and posture, searching for a lie. He found none. The revelation left Sherlock feeling like he had been, well, hit by a bus!
Smiling, Sherlock nodded, leading the way but making sure to check the road this time before taking of in his usual sprint, John trailing behind him. The streets of London sailed past them yet again and soon enough, with enough deductive work along the way, Sherlock was able to find the base of operations which linked the killer to not only the homicides but a series of killing spanning over the last 2o years. Lestrade and the team were down within minutes and arrests were made. It didn’t take long to surround and clear out the building and before they could be dragged to the station, Sherlock managed to talk his way out of the paperwork as per usual. He always saw it as a waste of his valuable time to sit down and fill out a bunch of stupid forms. They had their killer and the evidence, what more did they really need to convict him? Before they could be stopped, Sherlock took John by the hand and lead him away, not caring about the whispers and sneers from Anderson and a few others who saw. They were in a cab before too long and on their way home, it was a tense ride however as Sherlock knew things would change from this point onwards, but he had no idea what exactly would be different. How would he cope with this? What if he did it all wrong and ended up hurting John? What if John wanted sex or something? How would he explain his lack of experience at his age? Would John be comfortable leading things or would he expect Sherlock to take control?
“Hardly, you are the driving force behind this… I didn’t think… well… I’m glad I pushed you if that’s the result” Sherlock said with another forming blush making its way onto his cheeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You… thank you” was all Sherlock seemed capable of saying. He was in shock, clearly, though he never liked to admit things like this did manage to get to him. At the end of the day, he had been woken with his hands bound and a gun pointed straight at him, that would be enough to traumatize most people. “Why did you… Your things?” he murmured, his expression looked… lost.
‘Oh you know, just admiring your cheekbones and gorgeous eyes…’
Hours passed. John wandered into the room from time to time to check on the detective but that was all he did. It seemed selfish of him to be angry, he knew this, honestly he did,  but he didn't care. His mind was oddly empty, he felt nothing but guilt and anger however even those feelings were dimmed. After a while of wandering the flat, he settled himself, sitting himself in the living room, John looked around and sighed, cases had been piling up lately, oddly he hadn’t even noticed. Being in this relationship had distracted John so incredibly that he barely noticed anything besides the building resentment he had towards his partner. Was all of this his fault? Could his own desires have blinded him to how Sherlock really was? Had he read one too many online love stories that lead to them getting married and living happily ever after? Should he simply talked to the detective? Would anything have helped them deal with this rough patch? Was it Sherlock’s fault for  being so damn obsessed with cases? No. “It’s all my fault” John whispered hoarsely to himself. Moments passed as the silence in the room was deafening. Getting to his feet, John felt an invisible force pulling him to his lover’s side and moved back to Sherlock, sitting on the bed and taking his hand. Silence. Not something John was unused to especially with Sherlock in the room. This silence was different though,  this silence was empty and cold, whereas usually he can feel Sherlock’s mind moving at a mile a minute.  “I know you wouldn’t want me to apologize but I’m going to. I know you won’t hear me but that’s nothing new…” he felt a near laugh catch in his throat as he said it. “But you warned me things wouldn’t be the most normal. I knew it. I accepted it. Then I got bitter when things weren’t going like I thought they would right off the bat. That won’t happen again. It’s my fault, I wanted too much from you. From now on I will be your blogger again and we can make this work your way…” he trailed off, disheartened at the prospect of not getting the dreamy relationship he had hoped for, but that didn’t matter to him as much as Sherlock’s safety and happiness. “I love you” he whispered, leaning down and pressing a kiss to the sleeping detective’s forehead before getting up and putting the door back in place. Tomorrow would be a new day. For tonight, all John did was get into his pyjamas, crawl into the bed and cuddle up to his sleeping partner before trying to get to sleep, making sure to have one hand on his chest in the attempt to monitor it’s beating subtly until he woke.
When they had finally gotten the opportunity to sit themselves down, Sherlock found himself realizing that all of this would change their dynamics immensely. How would they now respond to each other? Would they have to speak differently? Would he have to use endeerements and sweet talk? It was all a lot to process and before he knew it, John was talking to him and had at some point come to rest right beside him. Bringing himself back to reality, Sherlock knew what John would have asked as per usual, “Yes that would be nice” he commented, trying to look easy as he put himself in what most people would see to be a comfortable position. The moment he looked up at John however, he knew that the other was not fooled.
Taken aback for a moment, John blushed and nodded, “Alright alright… come on, let's get going.” he said, hopping out of bed and pulling himself together. Before running after the madman who had already bolted for the door. His madman. Smiling to himself, John bolted after him, huffing a little as he tried to keep up with the lanky detective. He could swear sometimes those long legs and that thin frame just made it impossible for John to catch up with him. It had to be to do with wind resistance or something because no matter where they were, he always seemed to be miles behind. After what felt like forever, John saw Sherlock standing still down the end of an alley he had gone down. Relief washed over John and he stopped, leaning on the wall after giving it a quick inspection for any odd substances. Catching his breath, John sighed ‘God I’m getting old’ he thought with an internal laugh following it, he looked up and oddly enough, he noticed Sherlock was looking back for him. Straightening up, he made his way over to the taller man who actually looked concerned which was odd, “So, what have we got?” he asked, his breathing returning to normal.
When John saw Sherlock, he had to take a moment to compose himself. The detective walked into the kitchen looking like something out of his own private fantasy collection! He admired the sight before him perhaps for a moment longer than strictly necessary before looking back to his food, “You’ll catch a chill like that y’know?” he said attempting to keep a casual tone while also trying his best to not trail his eyes all over Sherlock’s bare torso. It was a challenge to say the least. He dared to look up once Sherlock had joined him at the table, oh what a mistake that was. Seeing Sherlock like this made John want nothing more than to kiss those cupid bow lips and claim what he has always wanted to… but he knew that wouldn’t work. It couldn’t, could it? Swallowing the lump in his throat, he turned his focus back to the eggs on his plate, “Good shower?”
Sighing, John rubbed a hand over his face as he tried to think how on earth he was going to be able to do all of this with Sherlock. One thing he wanted more than anything was to show that crazy, curly haired genius just how incredible he was and how loved he was but how on earth could he do it in a way that Sherlock could possible feel comfortable with? Looking back to the brunette, John smiled a little sadly, “Sherlock, I know I kind of sprung all this on you… do you want to take it back a step? We can carry on as normal for a while if you like until you can really process all of this” he offered, despite the sadness he felt at the thought. Some people might see this as a retreat or even as giving up before they’d even begun but it was far from that. If they were going to be together,  John was damn well going to make sure that Sherlock was as happy if not happier than he was. How could he force him into something if he really loved him?
The sound Sherlock made when John swallowed him down was extraordinary, he had never heard anything quite like it, it was simply raw pleasure. Considering what Sherlock had told him about previous partners, he couldn't imagine any of them had considered to do such a thing to him, you didn't have to be a detective to see that. From such little physical stimulus, the detective was practically writhing around under John's ministrations. Humming, John trying to focus on the experience, savouring the musky flavour of Sherlock's obvious delight. Since John had fallen to his elbows, it made it impossible for him to pleasure himself in the process but oddly enough he didn't even mind, in all honesty he had barely even thought about it until now. Despite being rock hard himself, John found he was too focused on pleasuring his partner to even care. Enthusiasm stirred inside of him and he sucked Sherlock down, relishing the yelp that came from above. Up, down, up, down, Oh found a comfortable speedy rhythm and kept at it, his mind racing with lust and desire as he tasted the sweet drips of pre-cum oozing onto his tongue.
By the time John left the pub he was tired and swayed slightly from the amount he had managed to consume within the time he was there. It was honestly astounding to him sometimes as to how much fluid the body can withstand! Staggering back to the flat, John felt an overwhelming sense of guilt and dread. He knew Sherlock didn’t take emotional issues well and didn’t really know how to deal with them. Although he had been mad earlier, he felt like quite the areshole now. Thinking back on it, Sherlock had followed him and tried to apologize sincerely, the least John could have done was looked at him. Groaning in frustration, he rubbed his tired eyed before heading into the flat. The stairs were a bit of a challenge but nothing that he couldn’t handle. He smiled a little at the memory of himself and Sherlock lying drunk on the stairs together. ‘If only I had been brave enough…’ he thought a little bitterly. Shaking away the memory, John shuffled up and into the flat. He was a little surprised at the quietness and lack of light, normally Sherlock would be wide awake still at this time, rolling his eyes and John came in in such a state. Ignoring it, he headed straight for his room, he knew this place was safe from that damned criminal and he doubted that Sherlock would have any desire to see him right now. That was until he walked into his bedroom to find the lanky detective curled up at the edge of his bed, the covers clutched in his hands where he seemed to have nuzzled into them. John blinked once, twice, three times. He was still there. Firstly he wanted to wake Sherlock and ask what was going on but he felt a wave of sympathy and decided against it. Instead, he stripped down to his boxers and clambered in to the other side of the bed, nudging Sherlock lightly, “Hey… at least get in properly” he murmured, his voice a little slurred.
Things are looking up and after last night, the morning brings new challenges.
Are the boys capable of closing the distance or will the very thought push them further apart?
Patients came and went through the day, most of their cases were remarkably simple and he was sure that some of the more elderly people simply came in for someone to talk to but he couldn’t blame them. The elderly tended to seem forgotten after a certain point and many of them lived alone with no friends nor family to speak of. It wasn’t until the end of his shift that the mundane world of his world crashed away. Upon piecing himself together and restarting his phone, John felt his stomach drop as he saw a multitude of texts pop up:
Sherlock made a snuffly noise and looked up at John, his eyes half lidded and he expression soft, “Mmmm? Oh… I slept well, thank you” he hummed, closing his eyes and resting back on John’s chest, “You are very comfortable you know? I’m somewhat envious of those bimbos you bring to bed now” As soon as the words had left his mouth, Sherlock’s mind seemed to catch up with him, he tensed and John found himself blushing but that quickly dissipated because the next thing John knew, Sherlock had practically thrown himself backwards and was now on the other side of the bed, “I…. I didn’t mean like that I just uh… excuse me” he stumbled over the words and just like that… he was gone, practically fleeing the room. John had to admit he was almost stunned, he didn’t know why though, Sherlock was always a rather erratic person but something about the way he seemed to bolt out of the room made John’s chest tighten just a bit.  ‘Oh stop it! You knew this would happen anyway. It’s business as usual, get a grip’  He mentally scolded himself, taking a deep breath before clambering out of bed. Stretching, he felt each and every bruise on his back and sighed, “Bastard could have at least pushed us onto the bed” he muttered to himself before heading to the bathroom. The flat was awfully quiet, it was something that John normally craved but for some reason he didn’t like it now. He would be lying to himself if he tried to say the events from the early hours hadn’t affected him at all. In all honesty he had been so concerned with assisting Sherlock that he hadn’t even processed it all yet but he would worry about all of that later, for now he just needed a damn shower and a cuppa.
When John disappeared off to get himself ready for bed, Sherlock found himself going to his own room and simply standing there for a moment. He couldn’t understand why what the other had just said had startled him in a way. It seemed… nice, the idea of physical contact. He had to admit even if it was only to himself that he had rather enjoyed the way they had woken up this morning. Regret came to him then as he remembered fleeing John’s bed in a hurry after blurting out that embarrassing comment. It doesn’t matter how much of a genius that you are, it is always possible to slip up especially when you have just woken from the best sleep you can remember. Shaking it off, Sherlock got himself changed into his pyjama bottoms and slid under the covers. He had retired his duvet to the cupboard for the warmer weather and was more than content under the silk sheet, humming slightly at the coolness of the fabric against his bare chest. Soon enough, he could hear John moving around and he took a calming breath, bracing himself slightly for the company. Was it odd to feel nervous? No no… surely not. After all, he had never shared his own bed with another person. But this was just John at the end of the day. Just John…
“Well you can when I’ve finished” John sighed, “I’m sure you can wait a minute”
Sherlock hadn’t fallen asleep, his mind was far too active for that. He simply laid beside John and watched the other once he was sure that he was asleep. John looked different when he slept, he looked relaxed which was certainly odd. If Sherlock had to describe him on a regular basis he would probably say that the good doctor usually looked like a disgruntled hedgehog. He smirked a little at the thought but the smirk fell when John began to stir. John’s face began to scrunch up and he looked like he was in severe pain, the next thing he knew, John was awake and in a panic. The man apologised and Sherlock watched him for a moment, trying to assess the problem and failing miserably. Ignoring that, he moved over to John and laid beside him, “Are you alright?” he asked softly.
A headless chicken would be the correct description for how John looked as he dashed frantically around the kitchen. He was almost tripping over his own feet but that didn’t bother him, all he cared about at that moment was making sure the eggs didn’t burn while he grabbed the bacon from the fridge. He had to dig about a bit, Sherlock had clearly put a bag of… something slimy… in the fridge. Funnily enough, John honestly didn’t care to discover its contents, especially while he was cooking. He grabbed onto the smoked meat and dashed back to the pan to salvage the eggs which were certainly looking a little crispy around the edges but it was nothing too bad. The bacon was much easier, he could leave that to crisp while he took the time to make a complimentary cup of tea with just a smidge of honey and soon enough there was a basic fry up on the plate and John couldn’t help the smile that took over his face. He didn’t wait around for long however, knowing how impossibly cold a fry up could become in a matter of minutes. Just as he put everything on the tray, there was a small knock on the front door and in came Mrs.Hudson. Usually John was more than happy to see their darling landlord pop her head in to the flat, however he knew he was on a timer. “Mrs.Hudson, how are you doing?” he asked cheerily, continuing what he was doing.
Please. -SH
After a good cup of tea and a healthy dose of crap telly, things were far more relaxed in 221b Baker street. John was sat comfortably on one end of the sofa, his jumper protecting him from the slight chill that always seemed to run through the flat. He was convinced that as lovely as the fireplace was, it was the cause of some of their coldest nights meaning it was also the reason for their heating bill skyrocketing in the winter. Every so often, he glanced over at Sherlock, just keeping an eye on the other man as though while he wasn’t looking, he may disappear or something just as ludicrous. How would they start this? Where would they go from here? Shaking his head slightly, John knew that if he simply sat here, they would never go anywhere, so he shifted over to Sherlock’s side  of the sofa and lightly elbowed him, “So, I was thinking, how about a date this weekend?” He tried to pull off the question with some form of casualness and confidence, despite the fact that for some reason, it felt like his heart was beating out of his chest at the very question. It was foolish, he knew that, but it wasn’t as though he cared. This was Sherlock bloody Holmes, a man who can make women and men alike swoon with a look, for someone like John, he still did the same only it was ten times stronger.
“I don’t understand why… he saved me after all. If he had come home a few moments later I don’t want to think about what may have been. “ he stopped, feeling uneasy at the thought. “Lestrade, you understand emotions better than myself… John has been displaying high amounts of affection lately. He had been getting embarrassed around me and keeps running off… I don’t understand why” he admitted. He watched the DI’s face change at what he said and go from resting to a small knowing smile.
Shaking his head, John smiled fondly as he saw the door shut, he knew it was foolish but it was almost like having a mother around sometimes. Most people would probably find it irritating, but John never did, he found it rather lovely and he always thought about the time before he lived here. The main thing he thought about was how glad he was that Sherlock had someone to look out for him even then. Although Sherlock Holmes was a great man and a genius at the least, he did seem to be incapable of taking care of his transport for extended periods. If it wasn’t for his brother, his landlady and a few good friends, John was sure Sherlock would have perished long ago from malnutrition, dehydration or some other self inflicted state. Rolling his eyes at the thought of Sherlock’s inability to survive like the rest of the human race, John headed upstairs with the tray in hand, pausing briefly to calm his sudden nerves as their boiled up in the pit of his stomach before knocking on Sherlock’s door. This, this right here was the start of something new.  John just hoped more than anything that as the day went on it would show whether or not they could make a whole new chapter of their relationship work or whether it would all come crumbling down around them.
Bit of a swerve in the story but hope you guys like it!
Stirring from his sleep, Sherlock found that he had to fight the urge to hiss at the light that woke him, burying his face in the warmth beside him to protect his eyes. It was only when a familiar voice sounded that he actually became aware of his surroundings again. The warmth beside him was John...and he was burning his face in the other man’s chest. He went to jump back but realized John was pulling him closer, curious. “I...John uh...you uh… morning” he said weakly, wanting nothing more than to face palm from that attempt at an exchange alone. “Are you… are you feeling better?” he asked, hoping to regain his ability to speak the Queen’s english again soon.
Despite the fact John knew he could easily continue right now, he decided against it. Releasing his firm hold on the detective, John smiled up at him softly, his lust being pushed to the back of his mind. He wanted more, so so so much more, but that could wait, they had time. After all, they had danced around each other for all of these years, what difference would a little more delay make? “You are incredible, Sherlock Holmes” he said with utter conviction.
The case went by like lightning and as usual, John couldn’t help but feel the pride swell in his chest when Sherlock busted those murderous assholes. 20 years of killing, he couldn't even imagine the sick and depraved mind of that man. He watch the killed being lead away in cuffs and for some reason all he could think was of the families of those he had killed. Soon enough however, he was being pulled away by Sherlock and as always he followed without hesitation, although he was a little annoyed by the rather disgusted looks from some of the people on the scene. He didn’t miss the small smirk on Lestrade’s face though, it was to be expected really. It was no secret that Lestrade cared for Sherlock and wanted him to be treated well, if anyone could do that, it was John. When they were in the cab, it was oddly quiet, Sherlock was clearly in his mind again however it wasn’t his palace because the emotions were flickering across his features. It didn’t take a genius to figure out what he was so concerned about and John shifted closer so that their legs touched, “Hey, don’t worry… leave it to me alright? You know cases and crimes and all that… this is something I know… Just follow my lead and let me know if you need me to slow down.” he said gently, not wanting Sherlock to overwhelm himself with unestablished expectations.
That stopped John in his tracks, for a moment he had to pause and let his mind catch up with what was going on. Was Sherlock suggesting…? No, no he couldn't be, he clearly wasn’t ready for anything quite that sexual and that was fine but… what was he doing otherwise? Curious, John pulled his pants up off the floor and cracked the door open only to be immediately pushed back. The next thing he knew, Sherlock was in the room and had shut the door behind him. “Sherlock, what the hell?” he asked, stunned by the other’s actions.
I was feeling inspired to get this part of the story in. I think it's important both in the story and in reality that people realise they are beautiful whether they have one scar or a hundred.
Seeing John trying to run actually hurt somewhat, was he really that afraid of Sherlock’s judgement? His thoughts? That wouldn’t do at all. John was always so horrifically brave and selfless, he always protected Sherlock when he couldn't protect himself. Now it was his turn to protect John from himself. If anyone knew what it was to be attacked by your own mind, Sherlock knew. He knew exactly what it was like to have the deepest recesses of your mind come about like dark clouds and swallow your thoughts and obscure your judgement. He had spent years in the dark, his mind eating itself away until he was nothing but a druggie desperate for something, anything to take the boredom and pain away. That’s when Lestrade had found him, he’d taken him under his wing and given him countless cases to keep his mind from caving.  Then John, dear sweet John had come along and things had come to this, he lived a good life, he was clean and he had someone he valued far more than himself. Yet John… here John was crumbling in front of him… it wasn’t fair. Taking a breath, Sherlock stroked John’s cheek lightly with his thumb, closing his eyes as he felt the slight scrape of new stubble. With that, he released John and turned slowly away from him, exposing his back in the streaming light from the window to the silent doctor. “You have no reason to be ashamed John.... I promise you” he whispered, his own shame causing his chest to tighten. He could do this, for John he could do anything. After a moment, he went to turn back, he was stopped by the feeling of John’s forehead resting lightly on his back, then to his utter shock, a gentle press of lips on what he knew to be the largest of the marks from where one of the goons in Serbia had been unfamiliar with how to use a whip.
“Six members of a known drug ring that operate on the south side of the capital were all found dressed in red, laid out in a literal ring with a bullet wound in each of their temples. Very little blood was found by the bodies though, maybe enough for one or two people, not for six... “ he trailed off. “Anyway, they are investigating the scene now, it was only discovered an hour ago, it’s in an underground parking lot near Kennington if you want to take a look?” he probed, closing his laptop and sitting back.
By this time, Sherlock was moaning and whimpering wantonly on the bad. His hair was damp with sweat and he found himself unable to do anything but enjoy the sensation of John's firm lips wrapping eagerly around his now pulsing cock. He honestly could remember a time he had been this hard before and it was a surprise from the start. Normally Sherlock found himself more than capable of dealing g with arousal and other such physical issues but this was intense. It was lust in its most raw form and there was not a chance in hell of him ignoring or controlling it.  John was now moaning around him and suddenly there was a realization. “John! John I'm going to…” he panted. To late. The pleasure of an orgasm ripped through him before he even had a chance to finish his sentence. Automatically, his hands had flown to John's head without his permission and he shoved himself as far into the doctor's throat as possible. His mouth fell wide and his head was thrown back in a silent scream of sheer ecstasy as he came hard, his seed pulsing out of him in waves. Seconds passed, maybe minutes, he couldn't even tell at this point but it didn't matter. As soon as he was able to get control of his limbs again, Sherlock let go of John's hair and pulled back. The sight before him wasn't one he would soon forget. John was slightly pink in the face, there was a layer of sweat on his brow and his lips were parted and slightly swollen. The good doctor was panting, eyes blown wide and upon looking at his posture, Sherlock could tell that was trying to remain comfortable while leaning on a raging hard-on. Getting his own breath back, Sherlock pulled himself into a more upright position and cleared his throat a little, “I believe it's your turn…” he said quietly, licking his bottom lip suggestively. Despite never receiving a blowjob before, Sherlock had given them, although he wasn't quite sure as to whether or not he should tell John this. Considering his earlier reactions to his past, he thought it would be better to avoid mentioning it just now.
“Yeah well it’s not for me Mrs.H. I figured Sherlock could do with having something to eat for a change” he said with an involuntary smile. It’s something  John had noticed some time ago, when he spoke about Sherlock, a smile would always creep up the sides of his lips before he could do anything to stop it. It used  to bother him, these days it didn’t though.
That night, Sherlock didn’t sleep for the longest time, he was simply staring at the man who snored ever so quietly beside him. Love. John had said the word ‘love’. To most people this would mean nothing, they would simply attribute it to the amount of alcohol John had consumed and leave it at that. For some reason however, Sherlock couldn’t let it go. The way John had said it was so casual,  as though he had said it a hundred times before and it had become an effortless part of his vocabulary. His tone had been so soft, so caring, so… John. Looking over up at John’s sleeping face, Sherlock felt himself smile a little, just a slight tug at the corner of his lips. It was nice to see the other man relaxed from time to time. What was this tug he felt in his chest? The smile faded and he looked down curiously, it didn’t feel like a health complication, nor did it feel like a physical sensation at all… yet there it was. A small and subtle tug directly from the center of his chest. Then, it was gone. Deciding that sleep was the best option, Sherlock tried to relax however he couldn’t seem to get comfortable with his mind racing. Sighing, he went to get up but was pulled closer to John for his efforts. The next thing he knew his face was pulled up against John’s chest and the doctor was mumbling in his sleep. Normally such an incident would have caused Sherlock to throw the other person off of him but… this was John after all. How could he do such a thing? Carefully, Sherlock readjusted himself while hoping not to set off John’s apparent constricting response to movement before he fell asleep with his own arms wrapped lightly around his blogger.
A few minutes passed and John tried his best to restrain his need to message over and over again just like Sherlock had earlier. Desperation and panic wouldn’t help him though and he knew that.
Sherlock went to argue but stopped, John was right, “Well then… let’s go” he said, grabbing his coat.
“I’m fine” he said, moving to unbind Sherlock’s clearly sore wrists, pulling the ropes off and tossing them carelessly to the floor, he would worry about those later. “Are you alright? Did he hurt you?” without a thought, while he was speaking, John began to check Sherlock over, looking for any signs of physical trauma and to his relief finding none. It was only when he looked back to Sherlock’s face in the dim light that was still creeping through the windows that he realized where the trauma was. Despite his usually pale complection, the detective looked like a ghost, his eyes seemed glossy and he was looking at John like he was afraid to look away in case he might disappear. “Hey…”
Sherlock was a little stunned at John obvious attempt to make him happy but sacrificing his own happiness yet again.”Why do you keep doing that? Sacrificing your things, your time, your happiness just to protect and help  me?” he whispered.
The relationship starts here ladies and gentlemen, I hope you are enjoying things so far.
“Everything is fine John” Sherlock sighed, turning awkwardly to face the other, “I’ve just been thinking is all, don’t concern yourself so much”
Sherlock was beside himself, the pleasure of seeing and feeling John touching him was more than he could bare. The entire experience was maddening and it was bringing him to the brink of simply letting go of the usual control he had over his transport. He trusted John completely and was more than happy to relinquish himself to him. Closing his eyes, Sherlock went into his mind to analyse all of the sensations he was feeling however before he could even attempt to do that, the next thing he knew his eyes had flown open as John had in one swift moment removed his pyjama bottoms and was now throat deep around his cock. The feeling is explosive, it was as though every other sensation in his entire being had been overwritten by this one individual sensory input. A noise permeated the air, it didn't take Sherlock long to realize it was his own long and wanton moan that had disturbed him. A noise he had never emitted in the past for certain, despite many of the things he had done over his years, nothing even came close to the level of pleasure he was experiencing at this very minute. “Oh John!” He managed to groan, his head falling back as he felt those warm lips slide up his shaft, John's apparently skilled tongue working it's way around and eventually circling the now sensitive head with expert precision.
When he was pulled into a hug of sorts, John was surprised to say the least but he wasn’t complaining. Something about the position made him feel comfortable and safe, as though the world faded away just a little. At first he felt like perhaps he should pull away and say he was fine, that was how he usually functioned when it came to his nightmares but…. He didn’t want to do that, instead he cuddled closer, wrapping his arms around the other man to close the gap but that’s when Sherlock went still. At first John wondered why but then he felt something. Something raised on Sherlock’s back that didn’t feel right. Gently, he ran his fingers along it and came across another… and another. John knew that texture anywhere and he felt ready to kill whoever had done this damage, but he knew right now that Sherlock didn’t need aggression or sympathy. He needed normality and John could give him that. Perhaps a conversation would have been good at this point but it could wait, John simply nuzzled a little into Sherlock’s chest, let out a hum and closed his eyes, “Night Sherlock”
“Hey, are you hungry?” he asked, sensing Sherlock’s slight shutdown. He had managed to suppress his own arousal for the time being, although his own erection hadn’t quite faded. Seeing the detective shake his head, John rolled his eyes, “Alright well I am so I’ll see you in a bit” he said calmly, leaning forward and lightly pecking Sherlock’s cheek before heading out of the bedroom. He had every intention of having something to eat, as soon as he had sorted something far more pressing out. Hurtling into the bathroom, John made sure to lock the door behind him instantly. As quickly as he had gotten himself in the room, his pyjama bottoms had hit the floor and he rested his head back against the door. Despite being able to stop the heat of his arousal from clouding his self control a few moments ago, his restraint was only as good as the next mans. Without a moment of hesitation, John reached down and took himself in hand, biting his lip a little to keep any sounds from escaping as he began to stroke himself slow but firmly. For a moment, he cursed himself for not grabbing his lotion or something along the way but that didn’t matter as his mind began to wander after a few seconds and he felt his fantasies creeping their way in. Sherlock… laying face down on the bed, his wrists tied to the frame and a blindfold covering those intense eyes. His knees are bent and spread apart, exposing him and leaving him entirely vulnerable to whatever comes his way both literally and figuratively. The thought made John harder under his own touch and he gasped as he ran his thumb over the head, holding back a hum as he imagined moving up to the bed and running the head of his swollen cock over Sherlock’s puckered entrance, wondering what noise he would make. Would he be vocal in bed? Would he submit entirely like this? Now wasn’t the time to consider it. Focusing on his imagination, John gripped his cock more tightly and thrusted into his fist in time with his mind, picturing himself forcing his way into that little pucker and claiming Sherlock as his own. A soft moan managed to escape him but he didn’t care, he began to thrust into his hand and felt pleasure building as he thought of the many different noises that could come from the detective as he took John’s cock to the base. John thrusted faster, his breathing picking up but before he could even get himself close, there was a knock at the door. John groaned quietly, stopping his ministrations for a moment to answer, “Yes?”
Thanks for reading :)
Sherlock was grateful for John’s attempt to keep him relaxed and he simply nodded, not trusting his own voice at that particular moment. He felt the adrenaline from the case, the ache in his muscles from the run, the pounding in his chest from the emotional aspect. It was a lot to take in. Carefully, he decided to try something. Normally it would be an act he would consider foolish or pointless, but if he wasn’t willing to do somethings for John, this would never work.  Spreading the fingers on his right hand, Sherlock adjusted the position just enough so that John’s fingers slotted neatly between his own. A simple gesture but one that felt appropriate, granted it was different to say the least, but it wasn’t bad. Actually, it was calming. Immediately he noticed the way in which his mind went quiet and his thoughts diverted from the work and went to John. This was an effect he had felt before, especially at times they had been involved in physical contact in the past.. Looking up, he saw John’s features soften and his lips smiling back at him and something similar to hope fluttered in his chest. This could work.
These two are starting to get to the good stuff but pre-warning, NSFW content in this chapter and the following one. Enjoy!
When Sherlock came, John hadn't quite anticipated the reaction and was startled when all of a suddenly he had six inches of cock rammed at full speed down his throat. It took all of his focus and willpower not to gag. It was worth it, the sight of the usually composed detective dropping every pretense and allowing his body to react in abandon was beautiful. Getting his breath back took a little longer that John was willing to admit but in all fairness he realized that he was only going to lose it again in a moment. “Sherlock you don’t h-.... Fuck!” before John could even begin to protest and pull himself fully to his feet, Sherlock Holmes, a man who stood taller than anyone had fallen to his knees and had engulfed his cock with a near impossible amount of perfection. The heat, the moisture, the pressure it was incredible. Before John realized what he was doing, his hands had dropped into Sherlock’s messy curls and he was gripping them lightly, thrusting his hips rhythmically to match the other’s pace. It was bliss, John found himself lost in the moment, looking down at the man he had fallen for so long ago in awe. Oddly enough, when Sherlock’s eyes locked on his own while those cupid bow lips worked their magic, John’s pent up arousal washed over him and he came within seconds, the dam breaking and cum pouring into Sherlock’s magical mouth in a torrent of pleasure. “Christ!” he gasped out, pulling back and feeling himself wanting to cum all over again to the sight of Sherlock Holmes with lips parted, licking up the traces of pleasure that had leaked onto them. Falling to his own knees, John smiled at the brunette and leaned in, kissing him softly before he tried speaking again. “That was….well it was bloody amazing… thank you”
Sighing, Greg moved closer to John and rested a hand on his shoulder. Noticing the wince, he kept the grip light but noticeable, “John, what matters if you got to him. He’s alright, you’re alright. What more can you ask for?”
‘Oh God, I’ve broken him.’ John though, watching Sherlock as he stood totally still in complete and utter silence, staring off into space. To most people, this sort of behaviour would be disconcerting to say the least, however for John, this was normal Sherlockian behaviour. Whenever the detective went or fell into the depths of his mind palace he could stay like this for hours. When it had first happened, John had gotten so concerned he had almost taken the detective to the A&E however at this point he knew better and simply waited patiently for the taller man to blink himself back to reality and respond. Time went by and John simply waited until he say a small flicker in those blue eyes, he held his breath just a little as the nerves began to creep up inside of his chest but he suppressed them and faced Sherlock head
“Remarkably, sleeping with you seems to relax me” John said with a slight blush.
Upon seeing the marks on John’s face, Sherlock felt a swell of anger towards the gang and wished a slow and torturous death upon each and every one of them, however he was quickly brought back to the reality of the situation when he paid attention to the warmth of John’s cheek, the dilation of his pupils, the way his lips were slightly parted and his heart rate increased under the touch. Signs. All of them were signs of… No.  Blinking rapidly, Sherlock snapped out of whatever trance he had been in and  let his hand drop away. He couldn’t do this, not here, not now.  Before he knew what he was doing , the detective had shuffled quickly out of the crevice, walking briskly towards the DI who was on the scene by this point. His heart was pounding and he panicked slightly, never before had his body had such a profound effect on his mind. He had little things here and there in the past, times where he had walked in when John was shirtless after a shower, times when they had to hold hands and run for their lives, the times he fell asleep in John’s room… Shaking his head, he brushed that aside and decided to get the remainder of the information regarding the ring to the police while he got his thoughts together.
After John realized what he had said, he sat back on the bed.  Normally he would have been mortified if he had done something like that, especially to Sherlock. He had hidden his love and affection for the detective for many years now, the risk of it being exposed should be terrifying, but it wasn’t. Right now, he knew what to do… he needed to stop hiding and running away. He needed to be an adult about this. He needed to tell Sherlock. He heard the other speak and turned to face him with a small smile, “Sher-...” if the universe could hate John anymore it would be astounding, he was cut off by the sound of Sherlock’s phone ringing. As usual Sherlock snapped it up and began immediately running over a few case details with Lestrade. John felt his heart sink and soon enough, he watched Sherlock jump out of bed and grab his clothes.
Are you at the flat? -JW
Smiling fondly at the detective, John managed to eventually calm himself and get back into sorts. He had felt a little light headed from the run but that was long gone at this point. Nodding over to Sherlock, he started down the alley, “Come on then, let’s get this case underway eh?” he prompted. He watched from the corner of his eye as Sherlock followed along, that little smile on the corner of his lips, the one he always tried to hide. It was the one thing about Sherlock Holmes that people always got wrong, they thought he had no emotions. Bullshit, he was just good at hiding them away, most of the time. Looking around the alley, John saw nothing out of the ordinary, so he stepped aside and gestured for Sherlock to do his work while he watched and listened on. He watched in awe as usual as Sherlock pulled up each and every deduction, running through all of the information he collected as though he were reading it off of a screen. It never ceased to amaze John, even after all these years. Sherlock Holmes was a miracle at the very least, a man who could pull someone’s entire life story out of a single item… or an entire crime out of an empty alley. It didn’t take long before the detective had found the answers he was looking for, however this time he didn’t bolt off alone. No. This time, he had grabbed John by the hand and very nearly pulled him off of his feet, before racing away with John trying his best to keep up and not land flat on his face. It was amazing, running like lunatics through street after street, Sherlock moving as if on autopilot, guiding them without a mere second of hesitation, that was until they went for a road and John was the one to slam on the brakes. As they had been running, Sherlock had stepped into the road and the world had slowed to a near halt. A bus had been turning the corner and was inches from Sherlock when John spotted it. He swung them at that moment, Sherlock falling out of the road and tumbling to the ground, John landing flat on top of him as the sound of buses horn rang out. Stunned, John propped himself up, his body still pressed on top of the detective who also had a rather shocked expression on his face. Alive. He was alive. “What the bloody hell Sherlock?!” he snapped, the stun not lasting long.
By the time morning came around, John was awake as always, greeting the sun with a soft smile on his lips. He had slept without an issue and awoke with the still warmth of a sleeping Sherlock at his side. Honestly, how could life be any better than it was at this moment? While the detective slept soundly, John took the time to contemplate on just how things had gone thus far. Considering he had never believed that this sort of thing could become a possibility, it was somewhat incredible to him that this is the way in which their life had come to be. So many people looked at Sherlock with lust, desire, longing and in the case of many, love and adoration but in all the years John had known him, he had never reciprocated the looks back with anything other than disdain, disgust or disinterest. So many people had come to love the man in so many ways and in a way, despite his own affections for Sherlock and the joy he had now being his romantic partner, John had always found himself feeling sorry for the many men and women Sherlock had thrown aside with no tact or care in the past. He had watched people get their hearts broken time and time again, it was quite a depressing sight. Molly Hooper was a fantastic example. Sighing, John’s smile fell as he remembered the various expressions of pain on her face when Sherlock turned her down on the regular, insulted her, forgot about her and the look that flickered in her eyes at the sound of the many unintentionally cruel things he said to her. The one memory that stood out most of all was that Christmas party they had in the flat. The way Sherlock had hurt Molly so badly it speared the hearts of everyone in the room, even his own. He had been sarcastic, spiteful and hypercritical of her appearance yet again and she had just snapped…. Molly Hooper was not a woman who snapped easily people considered her often to be weak, timid and a little ditzy to say the very least but that wasn’t the case really, she was patient, considerate, compassionate and empathetic. Considering the cold and unfeeling nature of the world these days, it was people like Molly Hooper who reminded those around them that it was alright to feel something from time to time. Looking down at the sleeping man in his arms, John shook his head slightly, ‘Even if they had been a couple, he would never treat her the way she wants… there’s only one woman on par with Sherlock Holmes and she’s long gone’ he thought, a pang of jealousy going off in his stomach at the mere memory of a certain Miss Irene Adler. That woman had swooped into their lives and nearly stolen Sherlock right out from under him. Granted John had never revealed his affections at the time and would have had absolutely no right to protest the union but by God he wanted to. Shaking the memory away, John pulled Sherlock in closer and pressed a small kiss to his forehead. The world’s only consulting detective was his now and if they made this work, that is how it would stay.
